That reduced its usefulness to boaters who by definition want what's next geographically. This version is sorted from Source to Sea, geographically.\n\nNote that the text may contain elements from more than one alphabetical entry.\n\nFor the full Dictionary entries in alphabetical order see\n\nDickens's Dictionary of the Thames with a full index; PDF\n\nThe banks of the river are named by Charles Dickens in the traditional conventional way, facing the sea. The Environment Agency have now gone against this and today use the opposite convention - SORRY! - ignorance of tradition ...]\n\nClicking the links will take you to the relevant page on \"Where Thames smooth waters glide\" (where the modern convention is grudgingly used!)\n\nTrip from Cricklade to Oxford\n\nTrip from Cricklade to Oxford:\n\nAlthough scarcely any of the scenery of the Thames above Oxford is to be mentioned in the same breath with the beauties of Nuneham, of Henley, of Marlow, or of Cliveden, there is still much to attract the lover of nature who is content with quiet and pastoral landscapes, and to whom the peaceful solitude through which the greater part of the journey lies, will have a peculiar charm.\n\nIt is not advisable to take boat at Cricklade.\n\nFor some distance below this little Wiltshire town the stream is narrow, and in dry seasons uncomfortably shallow.\n\nTravellers, therefore, who come to Cricklade, with the intention of seeing as much of the river as possible, may be recommended to take the very pretty walk of about ten miles along the towing-path of the Thames and Severn Canal to Lechlade.\n\nfrom Cricklade to below Seven Springs\n\nThe Source of the Thames: As is the case with many other respectable rivers, there is some little doubt as to what is the actual source of the Thames.\n\nSome authorities have regarded a river called the Churn, which has its rise at a place called Seven Springs, a short distance from Cheltenham, as the real source of the Thames; but others, including such writers as Leland, Stow, and Camden, give the distinction to Thames Head near Cirencester.\n\nBetween Thames Head and Cricklade, however, where the Churn and the stream from Thames Head amalgamate, the river is a small matter enough, and it is not advisable to take boat even at this point, as the stream, though navigable for small boats, is still very narrow - in dry seasons inconveniently so.\n\nIsis\n\nIsis: A name frequently given to the Thames until it is joined by the Thame a mile below Day's Lock, near Dorchester.\n\nCamden thus derives the word Tamesis, or Thames, from the junction of the names of the two rivers.\n\nThis fanciful derivation appears to have no foundation in actual fact, but has been perpetuated by the poets who have sung of the nuptials of Thame and Isis;\n\n\"Beautiful Isis and her husband Thame\",\n\nWarton calls them.\n\nIn Julius Caesar's time the river was known as Tamesis, and the Anglo-Saxon name was Temese; very like the \"Tamise ripe\" of other days.\n\nWhether Camden considered that he had sufficient evidence to justify Isis, or whether, misled by the other river Thame, he merely invented the derivation as the shortest way out of a difficulty, is not quite clear.\n\nProbably he followed Leland, as other chroniclers in their turn followed him: a sheep-like practice much in favour in such cases, and productive of considerable confusion.\n\nBut as there can be no good reason why a river for a portion of its course should bear one name, and presently change it for something quite different, it seems desirable that, except as a poetical conceit, the Isis legend should be abandoned, and the river throughout be called the Thames.\n\nthe Thames Head Source\n\nfrom Cricklade to Kemble\n\nCricklade, Wiltshire, on the right bank, distant from Oxford 43 miles.\n\nSoil, loam; population, about 2,000.\n\nThe nearest railway station is Purton, about 4 miles off, an omnibus plying between the station and the town.\n\nThe fast trains from Paddington, distance 82 miles, perform the journey in two hours and a quarter, or thereabouts.\n\nThis is a straggling and fairly picturesque little place on the Thames and Severn and North Wilts Canals, and it is here that the Thames, at its junction with the Churn, begins to assume the appearance of a navigable river.\n\nThough in itself a small place, Cricklade is the centre of a number of other parishes which have for many years united in returning two Members to Parliament, the constituency at the last general election numbering 7,473.\n\nthe present Members are Mr.M.H.N.Story Maskelyne (L.) and Sir Daniel Gooch (C).\n\nCricklade is a pleasant little town, clean and well-paved, but has not been the scene of any particularly remarkable events, since it shared the fate of so many of the other Thames towns and was plundered by the Danes in 1015, and now contains few objects of interest, except the church of St.Sampson, a very handsome building, with chancel, nave, and side aisles, and a remarkably good square embattled tower, with parapet and four pinnacles.\n\nThis, which is said to date from 1400, was built of stone from the same quarries as supplied the materials for the construction of Cirencester and Gloucester cathedrals, and which are now exhausted.\n\nOn the north side of the tower are carved a pair of reaping hooks and a pair of shears, and above them a wheel projects.\n\nA local legend says that these objects refer to the three men who were most concerned in building the tower - a farmer, a tailor, and a clock-maker.\n\nThis, however, is more than doubtful, seeing that whatever meaning may be supposed to attach to the shears and the reaping hooks, the wheel is simply a Catherine wheel, and a very good one too.\n\nBut the builders of the tower delighted in quaint and out-of-the-way decoration, as is instanced in the walls and beautifully groined roof of the interior.\n\nHere, in addition to numerous coats of arms - including, on the south side, that of the Hungerford family, by whom the tower was, in all probability, built - are sculptured the aces of the four suits of the pack of cards, the shears again, two pairs of ladies' stays, and a number of other quaint devices.\n\nThe church, which contains some excellent Early English windows and a very good west window and door, was undoubtedly the work of different periods, of which three may distinctly be noted at the flying buttress outside the east end, and is both handsome and commodious.\n\nAmong the tablets on the floor is one in memory of one Simon Wild, jun., 1710, who is oddly enough said to have been \"in Jenis for singing, ringing, and writing\", and the tomb of Robert Jenner informs the world that he \"deceased this life\" in 1651.\n\nThere is an empty niche in the north aisle to which it is probable that a curious and much-defaced stone figure, which lies by the side of the path to the church, of right belongs; although here again local tradition steps in, and declares that the effigy in question represents the mangled body of a man who fell from the tower during its construction.\n\nAt the west end of the pretty churchyard is a good old farmhouse, and on the north-east side a picturesque building dating from 1652, which, having started in life as a school, afterwards became a workhouse, and is now a school again.\n\nIn the churchyard there is also a fine old cross, which formerly stood in the marketplace.\n\nAnother good cross stands in the churchyard of St.Mary's at the other end of the town.\n\nThis church, though much smaller than St.Sampson's, is architecturally interesting, notably by reason of a Norman arch of the eleventh century.\n\nThe town also contains Baptist, Congregational, Wesleyan, and Methodist places of worship, and a Town Hall capable of holding about 300 people.\n\nBank: the Gloucestershire Banking Company.\n\nFire Engine: Church-street.\n\nMarket Day: third Tuesday in the month.\n\nHotels: \"White Hart\" and \"White Horse\".\n\nPlaces of Worship: St.Sampson's and St.Mary's.\n\nPolice: the station is the last house at the north end of the town, just across the bridge over the Thames.\n\nPostal Arrangements: Post Office (money order, savings bank, telegraph, and insurance), High-street.\n\nMails from London: 3am, and 2.30pm\n\nMails for London, noon, and 9.45pm\n\nNearest Bridges: down, Eisey, for foot passengers, about a mile, and Castle Eaton, about 4 miles.\n\nLock: St.John's, about 10½ miles.\n\nRailway Station: Purton, 4 miles.\n\nOmnibus: three times a day.\n\nFares to Paddington, 1st, 14/4, 25/-; 2nd, 10/9, 18/9; 3rd, 6/9\n\nTrip from Cricklade to Oxford:\n\nAlthough scarcely any of the scenery of the Thames above Oxford is to be mentioned in the same breath with the beauties of Nuneham, of Henley, of Marlow, or of Cliveden, there is still much to attract the lover of nature who is content with quiet and pastoral landscapes, and to whom the peaceful solitude through which the greater part of the journey lies, will have a peculiar charm.\n\nIt is not advisable to take boat at Cricklade.\n\nFor some distance below this little Wiltshire town the stream is narrow, and in dry seasons uncomfortably shallow.\n\nTravellers, therefore, who come to Cricklade, with the intention of seeing as much of the river as possible, may be recommended to take the very pretty walk of about ten miles along the towing-path of the Thames and Severn Canal to Lechlade.\n\nSource?; Cricklade Churches; Cricklade; A419; Marston Meysey\n\nCastle Eaton\n\nCastle Eaton - A little village in Wiltshire, on the right bank, about 39 miles from Oxford, with the small church of St.Mary, chiefly noteworthy for a fine old bell turret.\n\nThe river increases considerably in its volume and width about here, and is spanned by a bridge.\n\nPopulation about 320.\n\nPostal Arrangements: Letters through Fairford (the nearest money-order and telegraph office).\n\nNearest Bridges: up Eisey 3 miles; down, Hannington.\n\nLock: down, St. John's about 6½miles.\n\nRailway Station: Fairford 3 miles.\n\nFares to Paddington: 1st, 18/6, 27/6; 2nd, 12/-, 20/-; 3rd, 8/3½.\n\nRed Lion Castle eaton\n\nKempsford\n\nKempsford: A village in Gloucestershire on the Thames and Severn Canal, and not far from the Thames at Castle Eaton, situated about 4½ miles from Lechlade and 6 from Cricklade.\n\nKempsford is of no particular importance, but is worth visiting for the very fine square tower, with two noble windows, which rises from the centre of the church of St. Mary the Virgin.\n\nThe interior of the church, though possessing many features of architectural interest, is rather plain, except for the roof of the tower, which is very rich in colour, and for some good stained glass.\n\nIn the chancel is a stone altar tomb with figures considerably mutilated; and in the vestry, which is notable for a good Norman arch, is a curious old picture which apparently represents King David, and was \"the gift of Robert Pope, London\".\n\nThe population is about 1,000.\n\nPostal Arrangements: Post Office in the village.\n\nLetters through Fairford.\n\nMails arrive at 7.30am, and are despatched at 6.10pm\n\nNearest Railway Station: Fairford, distant about 3 miles.\n\nFares to Paddington, 1st, 18/6, 27/6;

Soil: loam; subsoil, gravel.\n\nLechlade is situated a short distance below the junction of the Thames with the Thames and Severn Canal.\n\nThe river Lech here falls into the Thames, which at Lechlade first becomes navigable for practical purposes, and runs, except in very dry seasons, in a goodly stream under the handsome arch of the bridge.\n\nLechlade is a pretty little place, with a sheep and cattle market on the last Tuesday in each month, but, except for its position on the river, is not of any importance.\n\nThe ideas of its inhabitants on the subject of paving are, it may be remarked, open to considerable exception.\n\nIts church of St.Lawrence, which was built by one Conrad Ney, the then vicar, in the time of King Edward IV., is, with its tower and spire, a conspicuous object in the landscape for many miles round, and is a rather plain but handsome building in the Gothic style.\n\nIt appears, however, to have been somewhat severely restored.\n\nThe most pretentious monument it contains is on the south wall of the chancel, and consists of a medallion of Mrs.Anne Simons (1769), to which one of the fat and ugly naked boys, who were so popular with the sculptors of that period, is pointing; and in the east of the south nave is a mural tablet with coats of arms and two fat marble children, the whole being dedicated to the memory of certain members of the Coxeter family.\n\nNearly under this is an imperfect brass and in the north nave are two more, one of a male and another of a female figure, in good preservation.\n\nLechlade is the point at which boats may be taken for the trip down the river (see Trip from Lechlade to Oxford), and boats may either be sent from Salter's at Oxford by van or by the Great Western Railway Company, who make arrangements for conveying them from the station to the river.\n\nThere is a good hotel in the town (the \"New Inn\"), but boating parties occasionally prefer to put up at the \"Trout Inn\", at St.John's Bridge, about half a mile down the stream, which is also favourably spoken of, but of which the Editor has no personal experience.\n\nBanks: County of Gloucester Banking Company and Gloucestershire Banking Company.\n\nFire Engine: In the town.\n\nHotels: \"New Inn\", in the town; \"Trout\", St.John's Bridge, about half a mile off.\n\nMarket Day: Last Tuesday in each month.\n\nPostal Arrangements: Post Office (money order, telegraph, savings bank, and insurance) near the \"New Inn\".\n\nMails from London, 4.50am, and 1pm; mails for London, 10am, and 8.45pm\n\nNearest Bridges: up, Hannington, 3 miles; down, St.John's, about half a mile.\n\nLock: down, St.John's, about half a mile, the first lock on the Thames.\n\nFares, from Lechlade to Paddington, 1st, 15/9, 26/3; 2nd, 11/7, 19/6; 3rd, 7/11½.\n\nHere the river proper may be said to begin.\n\nTo this point boats may be sent by the Great Western Railway, or, if hired by Salter of Oxford, in the usual way in his vans.\n\nShould short journeys only be taken, the \"Trout Inn\", at Tadpole Bridge, may be noted as a clean little place, making up a small number of beds; and the market-town of Bampton is only a couple of miles distant should the little inn be full.\n\nPerhaps the best course, however, is to push on at once to Eynsham, and, leaving the boat at the bridge, to sleep in the town.\n\nExcursions can then be made next day to Cumnor, Stanton Harcourt, or other interesting places in the neighbourhood, and the journey finished at Oxford the same afternoon.\n\nOld father Thames;\n\n[Father Thames arrived here in 1956]\n\nSt Johns Lock;\n\nHalf a mile after leaving Lechlade, on the right is St.John's Lock, with an average fall of 3 feet;\n\nand just below it is the St. John's Bridge, with the \"Trout Inn\" on the left bank.\n\nFor some distance below this stream is very narrow, and generally weedy; St Johns Bridge;\n\nand just below it is the St. John's Bridge, with the \"Trout Inn\" on the left bank.\n\nFor some distance below this stream is very narrow, and generally weedy;\n\nTrout Inn, Lechlade. Slipway;\n\nwith the \"Trout Inn\" on the left bank.\n\nFor some distance below this stream is very narrow, and generally weedy;\n\nBloomers Hole Footbridge, Lechlade\n\nBuscot Lock\n\nBuscot, a village in Berkshire on the right bank, about 31 miles from Oxford.\n\nSoil, clay; population, 500.\n\nBuscot is only a small agricultural village, and, with the exception of the fine estate of Buscot House, contains nothing of any interest but its old church of St.Mary, with its rather low, square, embattled tower.\n\nThe interior of the church is plain, but a fine Norman arch divides the nave and chancel; and there is a piscina of apparently considerable antiquity.\n\nBuscot church is further adorned by a couple of mural monuments, dating from the end of the eighteenth century, quite in the taste of that period, and fitted with the customary angels, fat boys, and generally hideous emblematical devices.\n\nThere is a lock at the village, the second from the source of the river, with a fall of rather more than four feet in ordinary seasons.\n\nPostal Arrangements: Letters through Lechlade.\n\nNearest Bridges: up, St.John's, about 2 miles;\n\ndown, Radcot about 5 miles;\n\nLocks: up, St.John's about 2 miles;\n\ndown, Rushy 8½ miles.\n\nRailway Station: Lech- lade, distant about 2 miles {which see).\n\nand, after passing Buscot Church, a couple of sharp turns bring us on the left to Buscot Lock, from Oxford 30½ miles, with an average fall of rather more than 4 feet.\n\nEaton Footbridge\n\n[Eaton Weir was removed and replaced by a footbridge in 1936]\n\nAfter passing the lock the river pursues a most tortuous course for some distance, and about a mile further down, after the first good stretch of water we have had, is Hart's Weir, which in ordinary seasons will be found open, and with little or no fall.\n\nShould the season be a dry one, a good deal of care is necessary in shooting this and the other weirs on the Upper Thames.\n\nKelmscott Manor and Plough Inn\n\nEaton Hastings\n\nA couple of miles lower down is the little village of Eaton Hastings; Faringdon Hill, with its large clump of Scotch firs, being a conspicuous object on the right bank\n\nGrafton Lock; Radcot Old Bridge; Radcot New Bridge; 'Once upon a river' by Diane Setterfield; The Swan Inn, Radcot, Boat Hire; Radcot Cradle Footbridge\n\nRadcot Lock\n\nRadcot Bridge, distant from Oxford 26 miles.\n\nApproaching this bridge, the stream divides, and in anything like a dry season the right-hand channel should on no account be taken, as the navigation immediately below the bridge is awkward by reason of weeds and shoals.\n\nOld Mans Footbridge\n\nOld Man's Bridge, 25 miles from Oxford,\n\nRushey Lock\n\nand after about two miles of rather monotonous travelling, we come, sharp on the left, to Rushy Lock, 23 miles from Oxford, with a very slight fall;\n\nTadpole Bridge\n\nThe Trout Inn, Tadpole\n\nand a mile further to Tadpole Bridge, 22 miles from Oxford, with the \"Trout Inn\", a convenient place for luncheon, if the traveller is going from Lechlade to Eynsham in one day.\n\nTadpole Bridge is situated in a pretty country, especially on the Berks side; and, for some distance below, the river, which is hereabout very narrow and with many aggravatingly sharp turns, runs through a prettily wooded landscape.\n\nTenfoot Footbridge\n\nRather more than a mile from Tadpole is Ten Foot Bridge,\n\nShifford Footbridge; 'Footsteps' Thriller based on Shifford Lock; Shifford Lock\n\nbelow Shifford Lock\n\nand two miles lower down are the village and ferry of Duxford.\n\nA mile or so below this there is considerable shoaling, and half a mile further an island with Poplars, where the Berks bank should be followed.\n\nAfter making two or three bends, beyond this point, there is a prettily wooded bank on the right,\n\nRiver Windrush at Newbridge\n\nMaybush at Newbridge\n\nNewbridge\n\nRose Revived @ at Newbridge\n\nand a short mile of capital water for rowing brings us to New Bridge, from Oxford 15 miles, which, notwithstanding its name, is of great antiquity.\n\nConvenient for refreshment is the \"Rose Inn\", and just above the bridge the little river Windrush falls into the Thames.\n\nHarts Footbridge; Northmoor Lock; Site of Arks Weir\n\nBablock Hythe, Slipway & Ferryman Inn\n\nAbout 4½ miles from New Bridge is Bablock Hithe Ferry, 10½ miles from Oxford, below which there is a fine stream, the scenery becoming very good, with fine bold hills and the Earl of Abingdon's woods at Wytham.\n\nCumnor, a very picturesque village in Berkshire, on the right bank, about a mile and a half from Bablock Hithe Ferry, and distant from Oxford 4 miles by road.\n\nPopulation, about 1,000.\n\nThe walk from Bablock Hithe to Cumnor is very pretty, though rather steep - the path past the cottage, immediately opposite the ferry, should be taken - but except from its association with Sir Walter Scott's noble romance of \"Kenilworth\", the village itself has little to recommend it to the notice of passing travellers.\n\nCumnor House or Place has now entirely disappeared, and except the tomb of Sir Anthony Forster (Scott's Tony \"Fire-the-Faggot\") in the church, nothing associated with the sad story of Amy Robsart now remains in Cumnor.\n\nThe Church of St.Michael (the keys of which can be obtained at the post-office) is charmingly situated, and consists of nave, chancel, north aisle, and south transept, with a plain square tower.\n\nInside it has some handsome pointed arches, and on the north wall of the chancel is the sculptured stone altar-tomb of Sir Anthony Forster, with brass of himself, his wife, and his three children.\n\nThis monument has a long and florid Latin inscription, eulogising Sir Anthony and his lady in the highest terms, and especially attribut- ing to the gentleman the possession of the highest Christian virtues in a very unusual degree.\n\nFrom this it would seem to follow that, unless the writer of the epitaph had even less regard for truth than such gentry are usually credited with, Sir Walter Scott's account of the facts connected with the death of Amy Robsart cannot be considered as in the least degree historically correct.\n\nThe church also contains an old chained Bible, and on the south wall, on a brass, is the following curious\n\nEpitaph upon ye Death of James Welsh.\n\nthe body of James Welsh lyeth buryed here,\n\nWho left this mortal life at fourscore yeare;\n\nOne thousand and six hundred twelve he dyed,\n\nAnd for the poore did Christianly provide.\n\nAccording to the talent God had lent,\n\nFive poundes he gave of zeale and good intent;\n\nthe fruite makes knowne the nature of the tree,\n\nGood life the Christian, even so was hee;\n\nWhose tyme well spent unto his soul did gaine\n\nThe heavenly rest where holy saints remaine.\n\nYhis memory a loving wife unto her husband gave,\n\nTo show her heart remembers him, though death inclose his grave.\n\nThe gyfte he gave unto the poore she hath inlarged the same,\n\nWith five poundes added to his five, unto her Christian fame;\n\nHath placed them both to ye churchmen here, nowise to be delay'd,\n\nBut that yearly to the poor of Cumner be a mark of silver pay'd;\n\nWhich is the full apoynted rent of the whole beqveathed some,\n\nAnd so for ever shall remaine untill the day of dome.\n\nIn Cumner, for the poore's releife, Margery Welsh doth will,\n\nThe charge of this, when she is deade, may be performed still.\n\nThe lady certainly got a thorough good advertisement for the money.\n\nPostal Arrangements: Post Office in the village.\n\nNearest money order, telegraph office, &c., Oxford.\n\nLetters through Oxford.\n\nNearest Railway Station, Oxford; distant 4 miles {which see).\n\nStanton Harcourt\n\nStanton Harcourt, a village in Oxfordshire, about two miles from Bablock Hithe Ferry, is distinguished in county history as the manor of the Harcourt family, to whom it was granted in the time of Henry I., and who resided here until late in the 17th century, when they removed to Nuneham Courtney.\n\nTo students of English literature Stanton Harcourt is still more interesting as having been frequently visited by Pope, who finished the translation of the fifth book of \"Homer\" in the study which was allotted to his use by the Harcourt of that time - a circumstance which he recorded with a diamond on one of the panes of the window, a curious and interesting autograph still preserved at Nuneham Courtney.\n\nOf the old manor house little now remains, except the tower, on the second floor of which Pope's study still exists, the view from it over the surrounding country being very charming.\n\nThe kitchen of the old house also remains, and is almost unique, there being, it is said, but one other of the period in England.\n\nIt is of enormous size, with prodigious arrangements for furnaces, but without a chimney, the smoke being allowed to escape by an ingenious arrangement of loopholes and shutters in the lofty roof.\n\nThe present pretty house is built upon the site of the old lodge.\n\nThe village itself is very charming, and possesses a remarkably handsome church with chancel, nave, transepts, and a fine square tower, at the north-east corner of which is a tourelle.\n\nThere is excellent Norman work in the building, and some remarkably good windows, &c., of the Early English period.\n\nA fine old piscina in the chancel and the old rood screen are also interesting.\n\nOn the south of the chancel is the private chapel of the Harcourt family, containing four altar tombs with recum- bent figures representing distinguished members of the family, among them Sir Robert Harcourt, in plate armour and the mantle of the Garter, who died in 1490; another Sir Robert Harcourt, who fought at Bosworth; George Simon, Earl Harcourt, who died in 1809; and Archbishop Harcourt, dated 1847.\n\nThe chapel also contains a brass memorial tablet to members of the family, the list beginning with \"Bernard the Dane\", 876.\n\nIn the south of the church is a curious marble mural monument, with half-length figures holding skulls, of Philip Harcourt and his wife, 1688, and a passable statue of Field Marshal Harcourt, 1830.\n\nNoticeable also is a large marble mural tablet with two allegorical female figures as supports.\n\nTwo well-preserved brasses will be found on the chancel floor, and in the chancel is an altar-tomb with a painted recumbent female figure; and another, which probably also at one time had a figure under its canopy.\n\nAmong the minor celebrities of Stanton Harcourt are John Hewitt and Sarah Drew, two virtuous villagers, who, just before the day fixed for their marriage, in 1717, were struck dead together by lightning.\n\nThis incident greatly exercised the sentimental feelings of Lady Mary Wortley Montague and Mr.Pope.\n\nThe lovers are buried in Stanton Harcourt churchyard, and on the south side of the church is a tablet bearing the following epitaph from the pen of Pope himself, whose genius would appear to have somewhat deserted him during its composition:\n\nThink not by rigorous judgment seized\n\nA pair so faithful could expire;\n\nVictims so pure Heaven saw well pleas'd,\n\nAnd snatch'd them in celestial fire.\n\nLive well and fear no sudden fate;\n\nWhen God calls virtue to the grave,\n\nAlike 'tis justice soon or late,\n\nMercy alike to kill and save.\n\nVirtue unmoved can hear the call,\n\nAnd face the flash that melts the ball.\n\nSome half-mile from Stanton Harcourt are two large stones called the \"Devil's Quoits\", which are said, on doubtful authority, to have been set up to commemorate a great battle fought in 614 between the Britons and the Saxons under that Cynegil who was subsequently baptized by Birinus at Dorchester.\n\nThe soil of Stanton Harcourt is gravel, and the population of the village numbers between 600 and 700.\n\nPostal Arrangements: Post Office in the village (nearest money order, savings bank, and telegraph office, Eynsham).\n\nNearest Railway Station, Eynsham, about 3 miles (which see).\n\nFarmoor Reservoir;

situated on a hill, about three-quarters of a mile from the river, which is here spanned by a handsome bridge; and, except as a centre for excursions, headquarters for anglers, or a resting-place for oarsmen travelling between Cricklade and Oxford, offers no attraction to the visitor.\n\nThe church of St.Leonard is an old stone building of considerable size, with a square embattled tower, and presents many varieties of architecture to the examination of the student.\n\nThe interior, which contains several mural monuments and a brass of 1632, is chiefly remarkable for the arches which divide the nave from the aisles.\n\nthere are also Baptist and Methodist places of worship in the town.\n\nThe soil is various, and the population about 2,200.\n\nFire: Engine opposite the church.\n\nHotels: \"the Swan\" and \"Red Lion\".\n\nPostal Arrangements: Post Office (money order, savings bank, and telegraph), opposite the church.\n\nMails from London (via Oxford) 6.48am, 12.30pm\n\nMails for London, 10.40am, 9pm\n\nNearest Bridges, up, Langley's (or Ridge's Weir) foot, about 7 miles, and New Bridge, a mile farther;\n\ndown, Godstow, 2½ miles.\n\nLocks, up, Pinkhill, rather more than a mile;

but, especially if there be ladies in the party, it will be found discreet not to trust to the chance of getting rooms at the end of the day's journey, but to write or telegraph beforehand to secure what is wanted.\n\nThe drawback of this plan of course is that it binds the traveller to a fixed itinerary, and parcels the journey out into so many days, whatever may be the temptations to linger on the way or to push forward.\n\nOn the other hand, to arrive at a landing-stage about dinner-time, wet through and hungry, and with perhaps three miles and a couple of locks to the next hotel, it is, to say the least, annoying to find that some more wary wayfarers have occupied the quarters which you had hoped to obtain.\n\nIn the height of the season, indeed, especially on Saturday and Sunday, considerable notice is necessary to ensure even the humblest quarters.\n\nOne week allowed for journey, after which extra hire will be charged, unless notice be given that the boat is done with, and where left. 2s 6d to be paid for care until van calls.\n\nBoat vans from Oxford to Kingston, Richmond, or Wandsworth, and back, usually every week during the summer. Gentlemen's boats carted.\n\nCompetent watermen at reasonable charges. Cooking stoves and requisites for camping supplied.\n\nThere are many ways of making this excursion; perhaps the pleasantest form of conveyance is a randan skiff with two sitters, as there is thus plenty of rest and variety in the work.\n\nPeople who do not own suitable boats would do well to engage what they want from Mr. Salter, of Oxford, who lets boats specially for these excursions at rates which include carriage back to Oxford, thus relieving the hirer of any responsibility after he has finished his trip and deposited his boat with one of Mr. Salter's agents, from whom he will take a receipt.\n\nIt is, of course, undesirable to take much luggage in the boat.\n\nThere are so many railway stations on or near the banks of the river that the heavy luggage which may be required for a lengthened stay can be forwarded from place to place without difficulty.\n\nGood waterproof rugs or sheets to protect such bags, &c, as are taken must not be omitted from the outfit.\n\nThe most convenient stopping places are Abingdon, Wallingford, Streatley, Pangbourne, Sonning, Wargrave, Henley, Medmenham, Marlow, Cookham, Maidenhead, Bray, Windsor, Staines, Chertsey, Halliford, and Hampton Court.\n\nAt all of these places there is good hotel accommodation.\n\nThe prices of the Thames hotels are, as a rule, fairly reasonable; although, like all similar matters, they have shown a considerable tendency to increase of late years.\n\nThe fashionable places, such as Oxford, Henley, Maidenhead, and Windsor (so far, at least, as regards the two big hotels, opposite the Castle), are, of course, more expensive than the others, and may be called even high in their charges.\n\nThe hotels at the other places vary but little.\n\nGenerally speaking, 14s or 15s a day will cover the expense of bed, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and attendance.\n\nTo say that the majority of Thames hotel-keepers still have fossil ideas as to the value of wines is only to say that they are human, and hotel-keepers.\n\nIt is astonishing that nobody can be induced to try the experiment of stimulating a largely- increased consumption by a system of reasonable charges.\n\nThere is, undoubtedly, a fortune waiting for the sensible man who is first in the field.\n\nSo many accidents have occurred and continue to occur, not only to novices but to practised oarsmen familiar with the river and its vagaries, that without any desire to assume the office of mentor, or to lay down the law to people who may quite well know what they are about, a word of caution may be added here before starting on the trip.\n\nThe river is safe enough for anyone who can manage a boat, but too much care cannot be observed in all boating excursions.\n\n\"Sky-larking\", which sacrifices almost as many lives as incautious boating, will of course be avoided by all sensible people; but it cannot be too strongly or too often urged that a very little carelessness may produce a very great disaster, and that, although it is very easy to get into the river, it is sometimes uncommonly difficult to get out again, more especially if the scene of the accident be in a lock.\n\nLocks should always be treated with the greatest respect both in entering, passing through, and leaving, and a wide berth should be given to all weirs, mill streams, and lashers.\n\nTowing against a strong stream requires more care on the part of the coxswain as well as of the person on the bank than people are generally disposed to believe.\n\nA typical accident occurred near The Grotto at Basildon on the bank holiday of August, 1879, when a boat, which was being towed up against a strong flood, and was steered suddenly too far into the stream, was absolutely pulled over by the tow-rope, and capsized with a loss of two lives.\n\nFolly Bridge\n\n{1883: and a short distance beyond this is the weir just above Folly Bridge, Oxford.}\n\n{1885: A little further is Folly Bridge, Oxford.}\n\n[1884: The Folly Bridge Lock gates were removed and passage left open\n\nI assume the weir was also removed at that date]\n\nOxford City: From London 111½ miles.\n\nBy rail from Paddington, 63 miles, Population, 32,000.\n\nMr.John Richard Green, in his \"Stray Studies from England and Italy\", is hard upon the city of Oxford:\n\n\"To most Oxford men - indeed, to the common visitor of Oxford - the town seems a mere offshoot of the University; its appearance is altogether modern ...\n\nIn all outer seeming, Oxford appears a mere assemblage of indifferent streets that have grown out of the needs of the University, and the impression is heightened by its commercial unimportance ... as a municipality it seems to exist only by grace or usurpation of prior University privileges ...\n\nThe peace of the town is still but partially in the hands of its magistrates, and the riotous student is amenable only to University jurisdiction.\" Mr.Green goes on to show, that so far from the above being the fact, Oxford had been a prosperous city hundreds of years before the foundation of the University, and opines that its connection with the University\n\n\"has probably been its commercial ruin ...\n\nThe University found Oxford a busy, prosperous borough, and reduced it to a cluster of lodging-houses.\"\n\nIt is certainly not given to the casual visitor to see anything of the commercial ruin of which Mr.Green speaks.\n\nThe town has a thriving and money-making air; even out of term the streets, especially about Cornmarket-street and Carfax, are thronged, and although the business done maybe of a retail sort, there is no doubt plenty of it.\n\nIts modern appearance, however, cannot be denied; and although its history is surpassed in importance and romantic associations by that of few cities in the empire, it is for its University surroundings that it presents the most attractive features for the tourist and sightseer.\n\nOnly a few ruins of the castle, which was built by Robert D'Oilly after the Conquest, and of the massive city walls remain.\n\nOxford City is only old in its annals.\n\nOxford is governed by a high steward, mayor, recorder - W.H.Cooke, Esq. Q.C: sheriff, ten aldermen, and thirty councillors.\n\nIt is a Parliamentary borough, constituency, 6,134, and has returned members to Parliament since the time of Edward I., but is at present unrepresented.\n\nIt is the capital of the episcopal see of Oxford; the original abbey at Osney, which was at one time the cathedral, has long been destroyed, and the present cathedral is Christ Church.\n\nOxford is an infantry brigade depot, is the headquarters of the Oxfordshire Militia and of the 1st (University) and 2nd Administrative Battalions Oxfordshire Rifle Volunteers.\n\nThe University boat-races attract many visitors, especially in the spring, and the great event of the year, which should be attended by all who wish to see Oxford from its best and brightest - but it must be owned most expensive - side, is the Encoenia or Commemoration of Founders Com mem. as it is generally abbreviated.\n\nThe festivities of this function are spread over almost a week, and include public orations and recitations of prize exercises in the Sheldonian, which is annually filled by a crowd of ladies who, one would think, must find the proceedings dull; balls, garden parties, processions of boats, picnics to Nuneham, excursions to Blenheim, Godstow, and Woodstock, flower-shows, interspersed with little dinners and breakfasts, the engineering of which your Oxford Don well understands.\n\nAs the capital of an important agricultural district, Oxford is naturally selected as the headquarters of many county institutions.\n\nAmong them are the Oxfordshire Agricultural Society, established in 1811 to encourage the rearing and breeding of live stock, &c., and for organising shows in various parts of the county; the Oxfordshire Horticultural Society, established i830,a flourishing institution whose objects are indicated by its name; the Charity Organisation Association, established 1844; and to take another point of view, the Labourers' Union, an offshoot of that which had its origin at Leamington.\n\nThe charities are numerous, the most interesting and ancient being Cutler Boulter's Charity; Stone's Hospital, founded 1700 by the Rev.W.Stone, Principal of New Inn Hall; and Richard Wooten's Charity for 14 pensioners.\n\nThe Radcliffe Infirmary, founded by that Dr.Radcliffe whose name occurs so often in the annals of the University, opened in 1770, has a weekly average of 112 beds occupied, and treats, besides, a large number of out-patients.\n\nA Provident Dispensary has been established within the last two or three years with satisfactory results.\n\nThe Boys' and Girls' Blue Coat Schools date respectively from 1710 and 1756, and educate about 110 children.\n\nNaturally Oxford is the home of numerous educational establishments, of which the Diocesan Training College for schoolmistresses deserves notice.\n\nVery important and significant are the Colleges for Ladies, founded under the auspices of the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women.\n\nFollowing the example of Girton and Newnham at Cambridge, the Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville Hall provide for ladies such educational opportunities as would qualify them for taking the University degree, if Alma Mater took as much interest in the girls as she does in the boys.\n\nAt Lady Margaret, or Lady's Hall, the expense is about £75 per annum, in addition to about £15 per annum fees for instruction.\n\nAt Somerville Hall, the expenses are rather less.\n\nThe terms correspond generally with those of the University.\n\nFull particulars in regard to these novel and useful institutions may be obtained, as to Lady Margaret Hail, from Miss Wordsworth, the principal, the Hon.Mrs.Talbot, Keble College, or Mrs.A.H.Johnson, 22, Norham Gardens, Oxford; and as to Somerville Hall, from the secretaries, the Hon.Mrs.Harcourt, Cowley Grange, Oxford, and Mrs.T.H.Ward, 5, Bradmore-road, Oxford, or the Principal, Miss M.Shaw Lefevre.\n\nThe City Public Library of about 9,000 volumes is at present located in inconvenient quarters under the Town Hall.\n\nThe Masonic body musters strongly; and there are two Masonic Halls, one in Alfred-street, High-street, where three lodges meet, and the other, that of the Apollo University Lodge, in Frewen-court, Cornmarket-street.\n\nTwo political clubs, the Conservative and the Reform (entrance fee, £1 1s, subscription, £1 1s) keep the fire of party politics alive and there is also the Clarendon Club with social and literary objects (entrance-fee, £2 2s, subscription, £2 2s), admission being by ballot, excluding black balls being calculated in proportion to number of voters.\n\nThere is also St.Catherine's Club, Broad-street, founded in 1874 for the benefit of the scholares non ascripti of the University, and conducted by the undergraduates themselves.\n\nThe ordinary subscription is 15s per term.\n\nA dinner at a very reasonable price is served every evening, and co-operative stores, etc., are connected with the club.\n\nThere is an extensive corn exchange, county hall, and courts where the assizes are held, and the county gaol, the city prison having been lately dismantled.\n\nThe Town Hall in St.Aldate-street is a spacious chamber, and has at the back of the dais a quaint carving of the city arms, dating from 1577.\n\nIn the council chamber will be found numerous portraits, the most important being one of the third Duke of Marlborough by Gainsborough.\n\nAmong others are portraits of Queen Anne; Alderman Nixon, 1638, and Joan his wife, principally noticeable for her curious conical hat; Richard Hawkins, Alderman, 1638; Sir Thomas White, Alderman of London, \"a worthy benefactor who gave unto the Cite of Oxford and xxiii other cities and townes everie 23rd year one hundred and fiv poundes for ever\".\n\nSt.Mary the Virgin, the University church in the High-street, is, with curious twisted pillars, elaborately-decorated facade, and beautiful spire, one of the most prominent buildings in the city.\n\nIt was built under the superintendence of Adam de Brome, almoner to Eleanor of Castile, whose tomb is in the north chantry.\n\nOn the south wall, under the tower, is a brass, apparently to Edmund Crofton, 1507, and over the door are some very curious carvings.\n\nThe chancel and nave are separated by an organ-screen and loft.\n\nThe Lenten University Sermon and Bampton Lectures are delivered here.\n\nIn the south part of the nave is a brass inscription to William Tillyard, 1587, Peter Pory, 1610, and Elizabeth their wife, 1621.\n\nThe stained glass on the south side of the nave is exceedingly good.\n\nBy the reading-desk in the chancel, covered by a mat, is a marble slab let into the pavement, bearing the following inscription: \"In a vault of brick, at the upper end of this quire, was buried Amy Robsart, wife of Lord Robert Dudley, K.G., on Sunday 22nd September, A.D. 1560.\"\n\nSt.Aldate's is dedicated to a British Saint, who lived about 450, and is supposed to have been originally founded by the Britons.\n\nSpeed says it was founded or restored about 1004.\n\nIt subsequently belonged to the Priory of St.Frideswide and to the Abbey of Abingdon.\n\nThe present building is of various dates and styles.\n\nThe oldest remains - an arcade of five small circular-headed arches, apparently of Norman work - were removed at the enlargement in 1862 from the chancel to the east end of the north chancel aisle.\n\nA recess in the north wall of the chancel, with a flat pointed arch of later date, probably once used as an Easter sepulchre, now contains a good alabaster altar tomb to the memory of John Noble, Principal of Broadgates Hall (the original of Pembroke College), who died 1522.\n\nThe north aisle, originally called St.Saviour's Chapel, was built in 1455 by Philip Polton, Archdeacon of Gloucester.\n\nThe south aisle was built early in the reign of Edward III. by Sir John de Docklington, several times Mayor of Oxford, and in its original state must have been a fine specimen of decorated work.\n\nThe old tower and spire were of about the same date, but being in a dangerous state were taken down and rebuilt 1873-74.\n\nDuring the incumbency of the present rector more than £6,000 have been expended under the superintendence of Mr.J.T.Christopher, of Bloomsbury-square, London, in the enlargement and restoration of the church.\n\nA number of brasses are in the church, but, as is unfortunately the case in too many of the Oxford churches, the interior is so dark as to preclude the possibility of deciphering the inscriptions.\n\nThe church possesses a fine old carved font, supported at the foot by carved monsters.\n\nHearne states that it was the custom for the people of this parish to eat sugar sops out of the font on Holy Thursday.\n\nThe present sexton has a lively recollection of hot rolls and butter in his youth at Pembroke on the same date.\n\nSt.Mary Magdalen, between Balliol and Cornmarket-street, is a very ancient church, the original edifice dating from before the Conquest, but has been rebuilt, repaired, and restored from time to time down to 1875, when the tower arch was opened up.\n\nIt has a perpendicular battlemented tower, partly built from materials taken from Osney Abbey, on the Cornmarket side of which will be observed in a niche a small cunningly-wrought stone effigy of St.Mary.\n\nThe north, or martyr's aisle, was added by Sir Gilbert Scott in 1841.\n\nHere is the old oak door, surmounted by carvings of Ridley, Latimer, and Cranmer, which formerly stood in the old city gaol, the Bocardo, at the entrance to the cell in which the martyrs were confined.\n\nOn the wall facing the old font are one or two old brasses: one to Jane Fitzherbert, 1574; another with a kneeling figure to General Smithers, 1580.\n\nAgainst the west wall of the south aisle is a slab (1735) to the memory of Francis Seely, late of the University of Oxford, Barber and Periwig Maker, \"who, in the relation of a husband, a father, or a friend, was equalled by few, excelled by none\".\n\nA slab in the vestry records in peculiar language the virtues of Mrs.Elizabeth Baylie, \"niece to yt glorious Martyr and Asserter of the Church of England, Dr.William Laud, Arch-Bpp. of Cant\".\n\nUnder the west window by the organ is a finely-carved old oak-chest, called the Jewel Chest, formerly used as a receptacle for the old Catholic communion plate.\n\nSt.Michael, in Cornmarket-street, was restored by Mr.Street in 1855, and has a coloured marble altar-piece, his gift.\n\nIn the lady-chapel on the north is an elaborately-painted brass with kneeling figures of Alderman Randolphus Flexney and Catarina his wife, who died respectively in 1578 and 1567; close to which will be found an extraordinary stone carving of a man and a woman, apparently having high jinks with a skeleton.\n\nHere also is a brass, \"Joannis Pendarves\", 1617, and a stone with an incised portrait, dated 1603, of Walter Dotyn.\n\nSt.Peter's-in-the-East, by St.Edmund Hall, the back of which runs along the churchyard, is a very ancient church, dating probably from the 12th century.\n\nThe crypt, sometimes called Grymbald's with its rows of squat columns, is probably the oldest part of the building.\n\nA door is here pointed out, in connection with which is a Fair Rosamond legend.\n\nThe south door, which is a unique specimen of Norman work, and the groined roof of the chancel with its appropriate chain ornaments, should be noted.\n\nThe Petworth marble tomb to the memory of Sir R. Atkinson, 1574, four times Mayor of Oxford, is in the choir-room; but as it is covered with a deal bookcase it is quite impossible to say more of it.\n\nOn the right of the entrance to the crypt is a small but fine window.\n\nThe Catholic church of St.Aloysius, St.Giles's-road-west, was opened in 1875, and is a lofty though rather bare and cold building, with a fine reredos and altar, the gift of the Marquis of Bute.\n\nBanks: Gillett and Co., 54, Cornmarket-street;\n\nLondon and County, 121, High-street;\n\nOxford University and City, 119, St.Aldate-street;\n\nParsons, Thomson, and Co.\n\n, High-street.\n\nFairs: May 3;

Soil, loam.\n\nIffley is noticeable chiefly for its old mill on the river, and for its church, which is one of the best specimens of Anglo-Norman architecture now left to us in a building of this size.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to visit Iffley to see the mill.\n\nIt has been painted in every kind of medium, and photographed in every sort of camera, till it must be as familiar to most people as Windsor Castle itself.\n\nRarely, indeed, is there an exhibition of the Academy, or the Dudley, or of any of the water-colour societies, without at least one bit from Iffley.\n\nFrom the lock, the village is approached by a bridge over the weir, passing through a gate at the mill.\n\nThis is kept locked, and a toll is required from each person of 1d.\n\nAbout five minutes' walk from the lock is the post-office, and about 200 yards to the right is the church, dedicated to St.Mary, which is known to have been built prior to 1189, so that a tablet on the outer north wall, dated 1659, which elsewhere might lay claim to a decent antiquity, here appears to be even absurdly juvenile.\n\nThe fine embattled tower rises between the chancel and the nave, and is in common with the rest of the church, in singularly fine preservation.\n\nPerhaps the best point about the exterior is the west front, which has a grand doorway with a noble arch, enriched with carving, about which there is even something Saracenic, as is indeed the case with some of the carved and fretted work of the interior.\n\nThe east bay of the chancel is as built by Robert de Efteley, a prior of Kenilworth, about 1270.\n\nThe ornamented piers and capitals of the south and north doorways and the chevron and sunflowers of the tower arches in the interior, are very noteworthy.\n\nThe vaulted chancel roof is boldly groined.\n\nThe building appears to be unusually narrow in proportion to its length.\n\nAbove the doorway at the west end is a characteristic circular window.\n\nThe font is large and massive, and is said to be coeval with the church itself.\n\nThe windows are of stained glass of no great interest, except in so far that the west window commemorates the author of \"the Crescent and the Cross\".\n\nThe churchyard is famous for its yew, certainly one of the finest old trees of that class in the country, and which it requires no great stretch of imagination to believe might have been planted at a date not very much later than the foundation of the church itself.\n\nNear it stands a monumental cross of ancient date, which has recently been restored by Mr.G.Street, R.A.\n\nThe rectory house, which abuts on the churchyard, harmonises well with its venerable neighbours.\n\nThe west side contains some excellent perpendicular work, and with the old Norman tower behind it, and its garden sloping to the river, forms one of the prettiest pictures on the Thames.\n\nThe Manor House (which overlooks the lock), though perhaps older by a century than the rectory, has been altered and patched until scarcely any traces of what it was remain.\n\nDr.Johnson visited this house with Boswell on 11th June, 1784, when Dr.Nowell resided there.\n\nBoswell says:\n\n\"We were well entertained and very happy at Dr.Nowell's, where was a very agreeable company, and we drank 'Church and King' after dinner with true Tory cordiality.\"\n\nThe name of the village has, it is said, been found spelt in eighty different ways during the last 1,000 years.\n\nIffley lock is on the right bank of the lasher, immediately on passing which the lock comes into view, leaving the river a little distance up stream.\n\nThe weir, on which is the mill, has a very rapid stream, and has a somewhat evil reputation for accidents.\n\nSome care, therefore, should be exercised when waiting for the lock to open.\n\nThe lock is of stone, in good repair except as to the gates.\n\nA roller slip has been recently added.\n\nThe fall is from 2½ to 3 feet.\n\nExcellent dace-fishing with the fly on the scowers and shallows from Iffley Mill-tail to Rose Island, Kennington.\n\nInns: \"Isis\" (Grandpont on the river);

Soil, heavy clay.\n\nSandford is a village nestling in a well-wooded country, its most picturesque portion lying in a dip at the back of the churchyard, where is an old farmhouse, dating from the beginning of the 17th century, which deserves attention.\n\nA walk of about seven minutes from the river leads to the church, which was originally founded in the time of William the Norman, and which has been twice extensively restored within the last thirty years, the last time in 1864.\n\nA memorial of a former restorer exists in the shape of a tablet over the porch, bearing the following inscription:\n\n\"Condidit me Dnina Eliza Isham Anno Gratiæ 1652.\n\nPorticus patronæ.\n\nThanks to thy charitie religiose dame,\n\nWch found mee old, and made mee new againe.\"\n\nWithin the church is a mural monument to one William Powell, dated 1661, and adorned with the cherubs and skull so dear to the monumental designer of that period.\n\nOn the east wall is an elaborate carving in a somewhat defaced condition, which is said to represent the Assumption of the Virgin.\n\nThis interesting specimen of 16th-century art was found buried in the churchyard, where it had probably been concealed from the spoiler.\n\nThe church stands in a quaint little walled churchyard, containing very ancient grave-stones, and made bright and cheerful with standard roses along the main pathway.\n\nFrom one side of it is a view of the old farm- house and of some fine trees, which, together, make a picture such as Creswick delighted to paint.\n\nAbutting on the churchyard at the west end are the schools, built in 1860 and 1868; and opposite are the village shop and post-office.\n\nA Preceptory of Knights Templars was founded in Sandford by Queen Maud, which latterly fell into the possession of the Knights Hospitallers.\n\nThe pool here is good for pike and perch, and where the water is quiet, heavy bags of roach may be made in the season, particularly during September and October, when the aquatic vegetation upon which the fish feed becomes sour and unpalatable.\n\nAll the way down below Nuneham good swims may be found for roach and gudgeon, while under the overhanging trees of Nuneham Park very handsome chub lie in wait for the insects that breed and fall from the foliage.\n\nInn: The \"King's Arms\".\n\nPlace of Worship: St.Andrew's.\n\nPostal Arrangements: Mails from London, from 6.45 to 9;

two in memory of the late Rev.W.Beedon Heathcote, formerly warden, for boys under 17 and 18 respectively, value £20 each (one for classics and one for mathematics); one, founded by the late W.Gibbs, Esq., for boys under 16, value £20.\n\nAll these scholarships are tenable for one year only.\n\nThere is an entrance fee (for boys over 12) of £10 10s, and the college fees vary from about £105 to £126 per annum.\n\nRailway Station: Radley.\n\nFares to Paddington: 1st, 10/4, 18/-;

Boathouse at Sandford Lock.\n\nColours, red and white. Flag, white with red Maltese cross.\n\nNuneham Park\n\n[1948: Sold to Oxford University\n\n1993: Oxford University leased Nuneham Park to the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University, as the Global Retreat Centre.]\n\nLeaving Sandford, the woods of Nuneham Courtney form the background of the prospect, and two miles from Sandford is Nuneham Park, the seat of E.W.Harcourt, Esq., M.P.\n\nNuneham Courteney (Oxfordshire) [now spelt 'Courtenay'], a seat of the Harcourt family, is one of the most delightful residences on the Thames.\n\nThe house, which is fortunately free from the inconvenience of over magnificence, is large and roomy, and gardens and park are second to none on the river's banks.\n\nThe property was purchased in 1710 by Simon, first Viscount Harcourt and Lord Chancellor, it is said for £17,000.\n\nThe house was built by him from designs by Leadbetter.\n\nIt consists of a central block, united to its two wings by curved corridors, and from almost all its windows commands beautiful views.\n\nIt is a perfect storehouse of curiosities and relics, with a fine library and many excellent pictures, and with literary associations of special value, Mason, Pope, Prior, Horace Walpole, and many others having been frequent visitors at Nuneham.\n\nThe library contains a most interesting and valuable collection of autograph letters and family documents; among the former being a very curious letter from Lord Salisbury after the Gunpowder Plot, which completely upsets the theory that the King behaved with courage and presence of mind on hearing of the threatened danger, as it expressly states that James was not told of the plot until all was safely over.\n\nThere is a strange and melancholy interest about a collection of letters of George III., from his schoolboy days to the time when his brain failed him, in which the progressive steps of the fatal malady can be clearly traced.\n\nGeorge III. was on very intimate teams with General Harcourt, and among the pictures now at Nuneham are drawings by the King, Queen Charlotte, and the Duke of York - not very successful, it may be added, as works of art.\n\nAmong the most remarkable pictures in the extensive collection may be mentioned Sir J.Reynolds, by himself, age 17; Michael Harcourt, by Velasquez; a portrait of Sir Simon Harcourt, said to have been the first man killed in the conflict between Charles I. and the Parliament (fortunately for the family, Sir Simon's widow married General Waller, and so saved Stanton Harcourt from confiscation); a portrait of Lady Anne Finch, by Van Dyck; portraits of Rousseau (from a bust taken after death) and John Evelyn; a fine Sir Joshua (in the drawing-room) of the Earl and Countess and Hon.W.Harcourt.\n\nIn the same room hangs a very noteworthy Rubens, \"the Two Lights\", and another laudscape by the same master; good specimens of Ruysdael, Van der Neer, and Van der Velde, and another beautiful Reynolds, a portrait of a Duchess of Gloucester.\n\nIn the octagon drawing-room, from the windows of which the views are specially delightful, are a portrait of Pope, by Kneller; another of Mary Countess Harcourt, by Opie; and a good Velasquez.\n\nThe dining-room contains a boy with an asp, by Murillo; a landscape by Ruysdael, with figures by Wouvermans; and a portrait of Georgiana Poyntz, Countess Spencer, by Gainsborough.\n\nThis lady was the mother of the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, and alludes to her daughter, in a letter now at Nuneham, as a lanky girl, with no pretensions to good looks, but who hopes to have something of a figure.\n\nThe family portraits in this room are very interesting; one of Lady Harcourt, the wife of Sir Robert Harcourt, is specially odd, from its extraordinary costume.\n\nNear it hangs a portrait of Sir Robert himself, one of Raleigh's men, who parted with hundreds of broad acres to fit out an expedition to Guiana, with no result but the subsequent publication of a little book.\n\nThere is a good portrait of Lady Anne Harcourt, by Jackson, and a large picture of Simon, Earl of Harcourt (the earldom was granted by George II.), with his little dog, by Hunter.\n\nTo this a curious bit of family history is attached.\n\nLady Nuneham, the earl's daughter, who was staying in the house, was one night much disturbed by a dream, in which she saw her father lying dead in the kitchen at four o'clock in the afternoon - Lord Harcourt being at the time in perfect health.\n\nLady Nuneham was so impressed with the vividness with which the dream presented itself to her, that she was unable to persuade herself that some disaster was not impending, and confided her fears to her husband, and subsequently at breakfast to the rest of the family.\n\nAfter breakfast the earl went out into the park, for the purpose of marking trees, and nothing further was seen or heard of him until a labourer was attracted by the violent barking of a dog to a well in the grounds.\n\nThere he found the body of the earl head downwards in the mud at the bottom of the well, having, it was supposed, overbalanced himself in an attempt to rescue his little dog, who had fallen in.\n\nA stretcher was brought, and the body taken into the house.\n\nThe nearest room was the kitchen, and on the dresser the corpse was laid - strange to say, at exactly four o'clock in the afternoon !\n\nThe coincidence is, to say the least of it, very remarkable, and the story is undoubtedly well authenticated.\n\nIn the small dining-room is a portrait of Aubrey Vere, twentieth Earl of Oxford, by Walker; a Salvator Rosa, \"Ulysses and Nausicaa\"; and two portraits by Reynolds of Simon Lord Harcourt and his son, respecting which the family accounts have the following curious entry;\n\n\"£24 10s paid Mr.Reynolds, the painter\".\n\nThe library contains many portraits valuable in themselves and for their associations.\n\nThere are portraits of Horace Walpole, Prior, Mason, and Pope, all presented by themselves; a portrait of Rowe; a good specimen of Kneller; and a very fine portrait of Milton as a youth, by Van der Gucht, probably the earliest portrait of the poet in existence.\n\nThe curiosities and relics, whose name is legion, comprise the service of Sevres made for the great fete at Ranelagh Gardens on the occasion of the king's recovery in 1789, and given by Marquis del Campo to Earl and Countess Harcourt; a locket which once contained a portion of the heart of Louis Quatorze, brought from Paris, in 1793, by Lord Harcourt; Rousseau's Tasso and pocketbook, with numerous papers and memoranda, given by his widow to Lord Harcourt; a piece of glass from Stanton Harcourt, on which Pope scratched, \"Finished here the Fifth Book of Homer\"; Queen Charlotte's snuff-box, still containing a little high-dried; her majesty's box of rouge, &c.; a tiny watch, given by the Queen of Bohemia, daughter of James I., to Frederick Harcourt; a piece of Charles II.'s oak; and a box said to be made from the tree against which Sir Walter Tyrrell's arrow glanced.\n\nStrict belief in the latter article is not considered absolutely necessary at Nuneham.\n\nThere is also a curious piece of 14th century needlework, and some tapestry worked by Mary Queen of Scots.\n\nThe gardens on the right of the house were laid out by Mason in rather a formal style, and abound in monuments and tablets with somewhat pompous inscriptions, grottoes, and high hedges.\n\nThe present owner has made great improvements, which have had the effect of opening up fine views which were formerly shut out.\n\nBeyond the gardens is the old church (now closed), dedicated to All Saints, which was built in 1764 by the second Lord Harcourt, and is modelled on the design of an Early Christian church.\n\nOn the left of the house run for some distance along the river's bank, and amidst most beautiful trees, the walks constructed by Capability Brown, where artfully-devised vistas, cut through the foliage, afford lovely and unexpected peeps of Oxford, Abingdon, and Radley.\n\nAt what is known as Whitehead's Oak, there is a particularly fine view of Oxford, although it must be confessed, from a landscape-painter's point of view, Sandford Mill, with its ugly chimney, is decidedly in the way.\n\nOn a knoll in this part of the park stands Carfax Conduit, which was built by Otho Nicholson in 1590, and being taken down in 1787 to enlarge the High-street, Oxford, was presented by the University to George Simon Earl Harcourt.\n\nThe village, which formerly stood near the house, was removed to some distance down the road by Earl Harcourt, who at one time had an odd idea of improving the villagers by the institution of orders of merit, prizes of virtue, &c. &c.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that the attempt did not answer the sanguine expectations of its promoter.\n\nThe population of the village is 304.\n\nThe nearest railway station is Culham, a station on the Great Western Railway, 56 miles from Paddington.\n\nDivine Service is celebrated in the new church, close to the village (which was consecrated on May 18th, 1880) on Sundays, Holy Days, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\n\nThe house is not shown to casual visitors, but the park is, owing to the kindness of Mr.E.W.Harcourt, M.P., its present owner, a famous place for picnics and water-parties.\n\nThe regulations for admission to the park are as follows: the season for admission commences on the 1st of May and ends on the 1st of September.\n\nThe days of admission are Tuesdays and Thursdays only, by ticket.\n\nEach ticket admits ten persons to the lock and Carfax.\n\nTickets for private parties, giving admission to the gardens between the hours of 2 and 5, are granted for Tuesdays only.\n\nMembers of Oxford University and their friends are admitted on Tuesdays and Thursdays without tickets, but are required to inscribe their names in a book kept for that purpose at the lock.\n\nTickets can be had on application by letter from F.Mair, Esq., Nuneham Courteney, Oxfordshire.\n\nDogs are not admitted, and it is particularly requested that all broken glass and other debris of picnic parties may be carefully removed.\n\nAccommodation for small parties can be had at the lock cottages.\n\nFares to Paddington, see Culham.\n\nLock Wood Island\n\n[The Northern Bank (Old River) side is no longer used and may be blocked.]\n\nThree-quarters of a mile farther is an island, which may be passed on either side.\n\nThe stream on the right is, in fact, a cut made by Earl Harcourt.\n\nThe old river on the left, which is more convenient for picnic parties going to Nuneham, is slightly the shorter of the two, but care must be observed in passing under the rustic bridge at the bottom of the island, as in dry seasons the water shoals considerably.\n\nPleasure parties land at the cottages by the bridge, where once stood a lock.\n\nFor regulations, &c, see Nuneham Courtney.\n\nAlong the left bank for some distance is one of those grand pieces of woodland scenery for which the Thames is so renowned.\n\nNuneham Railway Bridge\n\nThe woods extend as far as the iron railway-bridge, after passing which the spire of Abingdon church appears above the trees to the right.\n\nOld channel weir stream on right bank\n\nRather more than a mile below the cottages at Nuneham is the fall on the left where the old and present channels diverge.\n\nBelow the fall is a ferry, and the tow-path crosses to the left bank.\n\nAbingdon Lock\n\nAbingdon Lock, average fall 6 ft, from London 104¼ miles, from Oxford 7¼ miles.\n\nThis is a good stone lock, with a strong stream rushing over the weir.\n\nAbbey Meadow Island\n\nAbingdon Bridge\n\nA little farther is Abingdon Bridge, with the Nag's Head landing-place for the \"Crown and Thistle\", and the Anchor for the \"Queen's Hotel\".\n\nNags Head Island below and above Abingdon Bridge\n\nAbingdon\n\nAbingdon, Berkshire, on the right bank, from London 103¾ miles,

twelve minutes' walk from the river.\n\nPopulation, 6,506.\n\nSoil gravel.\n\nAbingdon is situated at the junction of the Ock with the Thames, and can boast very considerable antiquity.\n\nIt appears to have grown up round a great abbey which was founded here so far back as the 7th century, but it is probable that much of the early history of Abingdon is entirely of a legendary kind and that litt1e is known about it with absolute certainty until the time of the Conquest.\n\nThe evidence of Domesday book goes to show that the abbey at that time was rich in landed property.\n\nDesperate quarrels occurred between the monks and the citizens, and in 1327 a great part of the abbey was burnt in a riot in which the Mayor of Oxford and disorderly students of that University took the part of the inhabitants of Abingdon.\n\nThe town gradually pricipally through its extensive cloth trade, but received a severe blow when the abbey was abolished in 1538 and its revenues diverted into other channels.\n\nAnother reason for the importance of the town in ancient days was the building of its bridge by John Huchyns and Geoffey Barbur in 1416.\n\nIn the reign ot Queen Mary, 1557 a Charter of Incorporation was granted to the town at the instigation of Sir John Mason an influential inhabitant, and it has ever since been represented in Parliament, the original number of two members being now reduced to one.\n\nThe borough is now represented by Mr.John C.Clarke, a Liberal.\n\nThe number of voters on the register in 1878 was 890.\n\nThe town is governed by a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve councillors.\n\nThe principal business centre is the Market-place, with High-street, Stert-street, East St.Helen's-street, the Square, and Ock-street.\n\nIt is a clean, quiet little place - quiet even to the point of dulness - with many good houses both modern and ancient.\n\nAmong the latter may be instanced an excellent example of old timbering in a house in Stert-street.\n\nNotwithstanding its apparent quiet a fair amount of trade is carried on in Abingdon, and one of its principal industries is that of the manufacture of ready-made clothing, thus, oddly enough, carrying out the old traditions of the place, which, as Leland says at one time \"stood by clothing\".\n\nThe market-house stands on an open arcade of stone pillars with a timbered roof, and is the work of Inigo Jones.\n\nBuilt in 1667, it was restored in 1853, and stands on the site of the famous old market cross which was destroyed by the Parliamentary General Waller in 1644.\n\nA curious picture of the cross is on the outside of the south wall of Christ's Hospital,facing the river.\n\nThe abbey gateway still stands to the eastward of the market-place, and a little beyond it, on the right, are some very interesting remains of the old abbey itself, now in the occupation of a brewer but readily accessible to visitors.\n\nHere, at the extreme end of the yard, on the right, some crumbling steps with a time-worn wooden balustrade at the top lead to the abbot's apartments, now used as lofts, in which are the remains of a fire-place, said to be of the time of Henry III., with capacious chimney, some good windows, and well preserved poited archways to the doorways.\n\nThe roofs are lofty and the walls of immense thickness.\n\nUnderneath this room is a crypt, also unusually lofty, which is at present used for the storage of bitter ale.\n\nThe entrance to crypt is close to the backwater of the Thames and is shaded by some splendid chestnuts - for which indeed Abingdon is remarkable.\n\nThe upper windows facing the river at this point are in good preservation, and from a lane between the brewery and the abbey gateway, is a very picturesque view of the great chimney above mentioned.\n\nThe church of St. Nicholas (which, at the time of writing, is in process of restoration) adjoins the abbey gateway and will well repay a visit.\n\nIt contains a painted mural monument, with a carved stone base, reaching from the floor almost to the ceiling, dedicated to the memory of John Blacknall and Jane his wife, \"who both of them finished an happy course upon earth, and ended their days in peace on the 21st day of August, 1625.\"\n\nThey are represented by two figures in black kneeling on red and gilt cushions, she with her two children praying behind her; and the epitaph runs as follows;\n\nWhen once the lived on earth one bed did hold\n\nTheir bodies, which one minute turned to mould,\n\nBeing dead, one grave trusted with that prize,\n\nUntill the trump doth sound and all must rise.\n\nHere death struck even, yet did not part this paire,\n\nBut by this stroke they more united were\n\nAnd what left they behind, you plainly see,\n\nOne oniy daughter, and their charity.\n\nWhat though the first, by death's command did leave us,\n\nThe second we are sure will ne'er decieve us.\n\nBlacknall was a great benefactor to the town and among his charities is a dole of forty seven loaves of bread, which are distributed from his tomb every Sunday.\n\nThere is a small brass with an inscription to the Bostock family (1669), some curious old stained glass panes with an almost undecipherable inscription, and an old carved stone font.\n\nThe registers date back to 1558, are in splendid order, and most carefully bound and preserved, and contain many curious entries; among others, the records of several civil marriages, after publication of the names three times in the market, attested by John Bolton and others, mayors of the town in 1657.\n\nThe church has a tower with a singular square turret attached, and a good Norman doorway.\n\nA much finer church is St. Helen's, close to the river, the spire of which, with its flying buttresses, is a landmark to this portion of the Thames.\n\nThis really handsome church has a nave and chancel of equal breadth, and side aisles, with timbered roof, good throughout and in the nave and chancel very elaborate.\n\nIn the north aisle the roof is still decorated with curious paintings, many of which are gradually but surely fading.\n\nThere is a new carved marble font and modern oak rood-screen, both of considerable beauty.\n\nAmong the monuments is the stone memorial in the north aisle to John Roysse, the founder of the Abingdon Grammar School, who died in 1571, leaving express orders that the great stone in his arbour in his London garden should be the upper stone of his tomb at Abingdon, round about which four-and-twenty pensioners should for ever kneel on Sundays to receive alms; and with further careful provision that \"twelve pence in white bread, being good, sweet, and seasonable\", should be distributed every Sunday at his tomb, to twelve old widows, \"women or men\", of whom every one at the receipt thereof should say, \"The blessed Trinity upon John Roysse's soul have mercy!\n\nAnother stone monument, in the west of the north aisle, bears the following inscription:\n\n\"This tombe is honord with the bones of our pious benefactour, Richard Curtaine, gent., a principall magistrate of this Corpa. [sic], hee was buried July ye 18, Ano Dominy 1643\";\n\nand elsewhere on the tomb are these lines, which at the time were no doubt considered to embody a quaint conceit:\n\nOur Curtaine in this lower press,\n\nRests folded up in nature's dress.\n\nAt the foot of this tomb is a brass, with a half-length figure in action of prayer, Galfridus Barbur, 1417; and behind the organ is another brass, nearly obliterated, displaying a full-length female figure.\n\nIn the east of the south aisle is a curious painting of the genealogical tree of W. Lee, 1637.\n\nMr.Lee was five times Mayor of Abingdon, and \"had in his lifetime issue from his loins two hundred lacking but three\".\n\nThe organ displays a quaint wood-carving of King David, with gilded harp and crown.\n\nThe tomb of Mrs.Elizabeth Hawkins, 1780, is a capital example of what should be avoided in the way of monumental sculpture.\n\nIt is crowded with busts of fat naked children, weeping tears of colossal size, and all the usual devices and properties of the most conventional stonemason.\n\nThe perpetrator of this work of genius was, it appears, one Hickey, who was fortunate enough to receive for it £400 under the deceased lady's will.\n\nIn the churchyard of St. Helen's is a row of almshouses in memory of Charles Twitty, 1707, who gave £1,700 for building and endowing \"an hospital for maintayning in meate, drinke, and apparrel, and all other necessarys of life 3 poor aged men, and the like number of poor aged women\".\n\nAbutting on the churchyard also are the cloistered buildings of the charity of Christ's Hospital, which was refounded in 1553 - having been dissolved by Henry VIII. - at the instance of Sir John Mason, who procured for it a charter from Edward VI.\n\nOver the central porch of the hospital are some curious old paintings, representing such subjects as the giving of alms, the story of the Good Samaritan, and other Scripture subjects, as well as a portrait of Edward VI.\n\nThe picture of the old market cross has already been noticed.\n\nThe oak-panelled hall, which is lighted by a lofty lantern, has several odd pictures, among them one representing the building of Abingdon Bridge, in memory of \"Jefforye Barbur and John Howchion\".\n\nOn the frame is inscribed : \"Frauncis Little, one of ye governors of this hospital, gave this table, An. Dni. 1607.\"\n\nand underneath the picture stands the table in question, a fine one of oak, with curiously carved legs.\n\nA portrait of Edward VI. hangs, with several others, in the hall; and there is also preserved the original charter, which shows considerable signs of age.\n\nThe later portion of the hospital buildings, which runs parallel to the river, dates from 1718, and it is just below this point that the waters of the Ock and of the Wilts and Berks Canal join the Thames.\n\nAt the north side of the town is the Albert Park, presented to the town by the trustees of Christ's Hospital in 1864.\n\nIt is well laid out and planted, and in it stands a monument to the late Prince Consort, with his statue in the robes of the Garter.\n\nAdjoining the park are the new buildings of the grammar school, founded by John Roysse in 1563.\n\nThe profligacy of John Roysse's son was the immediate cause of the foundation of Abingdon Grammar School.\n\nIt is said that nothing but the universal estimation in which men held his father, \"as well in the west country as also in Kent or otherwise\", saved the criminal from the penalties of the law.\n\nRoysse disinherited him, and, after providing for his grandson and making certain other bequests, bequeathed the residue of his fortune, directing that as it was endowed A.D.1563, and in the 63rd year of its founder's life, it should educate 63 boys for ever.\n\nThomas Teesdale, the first scholar admitted into this school, endowed an ushership in the school, and left funds for purchasing lands for the maintenance of fellows and scholars from Abingdon school at Balliol College, Oxford.\n\nHis trustees, however, combined with Richard Wightwick to found Pembroke College, Oxford, at which college the school possesses five of the incorporated scholarships.\n\nOf these one is filled up annually, and two boys who have been educated at the school for two years are nominated as candidates.\n\nEach scholarship is of the value of £50 per annum, with rooms rent free, and is tenable for five years.\n\nThe fees for boarders under the age of 13 are £57, over 13, £63.\n\nHard by Roysse's school is Sir Gilbert Scott's church of St. Michael, which serves as a chapel-of-ease to St. Helen's.\n\nThe street leading to the park from Ock-street is by the side of the almshouses founded by Benjamin Tompkins in 1733.\n\nThe angler should not be afraid of fishing near the town, as there are some excellent swims close by.\n\nIn Blake's Lock-pool there are barbel, chub, perch, &c, and on the tow-path side, opposite Thrup, just past the overfall, there is a swim of considerable length, and full six feet deep, reachable from the bank.\n\nBanks.- Gillett & Co., The Square;
