For the First Part: Round the Fire it does not list any of named stories that are told on the 8 \"Evenings\", merely \"First Evening\" to \"Eighth Evening\". Other editions list those stories in the Contents, and they are sometimes catalogued as contents --for instance, by a previous editor of our 1st ed. publication record P444461 (whose contents I exported to our Gutenberg ebook record a few hours ago, with sequence adjustment in the queue as I depart).\n\nOur later publication records do not list either the \"Evenings\" or the named stories told on those evenings (where today I added notes explaining that the edition is complete, but our Contents list is not). Some library records also pass over \"Round the Fire\".\n\nOne motivation to list stories as Contents must be that they are sometimes reprinted out of their \"Evening\" context. But there are latterday publications as an \"Evening\" too. Relying on our publication records and naught else, anthologies contain the \"Seventh Evening\" under that name and also as an excerpt from Round the Fire, the ISFDB \"novella\" that constitutes the entire First Part. And anthologies contain one story told on the Seventh Evening, \"The Benighted Traveller\", both under that name and as an excerpt from Round the Fire (no report as an excerpt from Seventh Evening).\n\nWhen such parts of books as \"First Part: Round the Fire\" and \"Second Part: Legends of the Earthborn\" be listed as works, when their components are listed as well?\n\ncf.

You verified our record of this 1919 collection P579893.\n\nDid you determine that only two stories are spec-fic by reading the book? Or list only those SHORTFICTION already in the database? If the latter I suggest a note such as the one I added to a couple of records this week, \"Fiction contents listed below (7 of 11 in the anthology) are those in the database as contents of other publications (September 2019).\" If the former, a different note.\n\nEss Ess Publishing Company was the founding publisher of The Smart Set literary magazine. For one point of entry in the database see publisher Ess Ess Publishing Co. The 1902 statement you report from the copyright page indicates that some contents in the collection were published in that magazine during 1902. The 1903/1905/1906 copyrights by Doubleday, Page report suggest appearance of other stories in Doubleday, Page magazines OR Doubleday, Page books during those years. HOWEVER, the entire collection was published by McClure, Phillips in 1906 OCLC 1399985, and Doubleday, Page acquired the book publishing operations of McClure in 1908. I don't know how to interpret the listings as in the Doubleday, Page name. (This meagre record of a Doubleday book as 1903 must be spurious, probably based on copyright statement, OCLC 500066730.) (S. S. McClure is no relation to \"Ess Ess\" and \"The Smart Set\" as far as I know.)\n\nFrom your cited WorldCat record OCLC 6568967 is \"Doubleday, Page & Co., for Review of Reviews Co.\" a quotation from the title page? (For instance compare another t.p. image.) If so then yours is a Doubleday, Page publication and The Review of Reviews Co. or Review of Reviews belongs in a Note. \"Doubleday, Page & Company / Review of Reviews Co.\" means Doubleday, Page as an imprint of Review of Reviews.\n\n(end draft)\n\nFor this collection, dozens of WorldCat library records are listed in WorldCat: Formats and Editions as 1906 from several publishers (probably some of those record report spurious 1906 editions, but some give other publication dates).\n\nSeveral WorldCat records listed as 1912 to 1920 WorldCat to #108 of 194 cite D, Page for Review of Reviews\n\nFakeer P357648 HDL: explicit copyright page -- copyright 1900 to 1902 by \"Ess Ess Publishing Co.\" (as publishers of the magazine evidently) -- copyright 1903 by \"The Smart Set Publishing Co.\"\n\nel O.
