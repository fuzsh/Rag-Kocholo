Trevor Owen. front cover\n\nNotes from a small island. Michael Blakemore. 3\n\nEditorial with title reminisicent of Bill Bryson, but considers one of the smaller, and more democratic British Islands noted for its antique railways.\n\nOne current feature which has particulartly, as they say, 'floated my boat' is 'By Steam to the Steamers', Malcolm Rivett's survey of the railway connections with sailings to and from the Isle of Man. The reason for my interest is that when I was a lad in Bury in the 1960s the summer holidays - or that part of them not occupied by the family fortnight away - stretched ahead with seemingly limitless opportunities for days out, mostly local explorations, picnics and simple pleasures of that ilk. In those far-off days whereof I write we had no car, but then neither did many families, so the local bus and coach operators stepped forward with their programmes - who remembers Ribble, Warburton's, Yelloways, Fred Craven? - to run us to the usual seaside resorts, Chester, Alton Towers, Hardcastle Crags (the 'Switzerland of the Pennines' if you believe it) and so on. Evening outings were promoted to the futuristic world of Manchester Airport viewing gallery and (improbable as it might seem) Charnock Richard services on the M6, joined later by Lancaster services as a tantalising alternative, at the time the only contact most us had with the sleek connotations of aeroplanes and motorways. But good old British Railways was on its marks as well with a range of excursion fares and one of its most attractive offers was a combined train and boat ticket to Douglas, Isle of Man - there and back in a day.\n\nThe adventure started by taking the train from Bury's Knowsley Street station on the Central Lancashire line between Rochdale and Bolton: steam-hauled (a Standard Class 4 as I recall) in non-corridor compartment coaches. Many of its trains continued beyond Bolton towards the Lancashire Coast or, in our case, Liverpool Exchange and from there an easy stride took us to the Landing Stage where the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company's boat awaited us.\n\nThere is something special, I think, about leaving a country by sea, even if only to cross to the Isle of Man. I watched Liverpool and its famous waterfront recede as we sailed into the Mersey and then first parallel to the coast, with Blackpool Tower still a clear and distant shape, until we left the land behind us. On board a proper ship you could stroll ' around the decks, imagining yourself bound for the 'New World' while taking in the tang of the salty air and the churning foam as you ploughed through the briny. You could descend to look down over the engine room where there was generally a man with an oil can going round its machinery and before reaching the island you could partake of a decent lunch in the dining saloon.\n\nThere wasn't time enough in Douglas, unfortunately, to travel on the Isle of Man Railway but I did note that its fine terminus station was looking rather shabby. The second visit occurred after the railway had experienced closure but in the first year after its revival under the 'Ailsa regime' and one of its bright green engines did hint at cautious optimism. We did have the chance to ride the length of the famous horse tramway, though! incidentally, today's Manx government seems strangely ambivalent about the horse trams at the moment; perhaps they have an 'image problem'. Hopefully it will come to appreciate what a distinctive historic asset it has.\n\nIn the succeeding years the Isle of Man suffered a downturn in its tourist popularity as holidays abroad became more affordable, with the island further disadvantaged by its relative inaccessibility for the 'short break' market. It was not until the 1990s that I made the crossing again - this time to stay on the island and enjoy the Isle of Man Steam Railway's remaining line to Port Erin along with its two vintage electric railways to Ramsey and Snaefell Summit. The Isle of Man and its railways seem to have weathered some awkward times and now seem in good heart- which is more than can be said for the 'big railway' which took me from Bury to Liverpool to board my first 'packet': it closed in 1970!\n\nVisiting Kentish Town and Cricklewood.

Nisbet. Claims against railway companies. 7-12.\n\nIn May 1910 a Forfar solicitor claimed damages from the Caledonian Railway when he had been prevented from speaking to a client on the station platform as he had been withheld by the Company's staff as he did not possess a platform ticket. The solicitor lost his case against the railway. The accident on the Edinburgh & Glasgow Railway at Pardoran Siding near Linlithgow on 13 October 1862 led to several claims for compensation from passengers, one of whom was Henry Bardner, a factor on an estate who was severely injured. The railway lost the case for Â£3000 compensation and sought to appeal, but the Lord President refused to set aside the verdict. A minor shunting bump at Perth caused by the Scottish North Eastern Railway led to claims for damages from a group of Professional Pedestrians which the railway tried to fight, but was eventually settled out of court. Mrs Janet Carr claimed that she had injured whilst alighting from a train at Springfield in Fife, but the case was lost, as was an appeal to the Court of Session. William Gant was severely injured whilst attempting to board a moving train at Plaistow. The London Tilbury & Southend Railway sought to limit the claim by arguing that it was a workmen's train, but Gant argued that he had paid a higher price to travel on the train. Unfortunately the final outcome is not known. John Mitchell whilst alighting at Strichen on 1 May 1893 was injured as the train was too long for the platform and he sought damages ftom the Great North of Scotland Railway. The Railway attempted to fight the case and it eventually came before the Sheriff-Principal who rejected the Company's appeal. On 22 September 1906 Mrs Janet Neilson sustained injuries when she attempted to alight at Cupar from a train which had overshot the platform. The North British Railway attempted to fight the claim, but eventually settled out of court. Mrs Isabella Gray sued the GNSR for a large sum for severe injuries sustained when she was struck by a locomotive whilst crossing the line at Ruthrieston. The Company contested the case as she have used the footbridge: the result of the challenge is not recorded. Finally (and this has a 2017 resonance) the Great Eastern Railway was taken to court in Stowmarket for blocking Stowupland level crossing. The case was lost, but the railway company's application for costs was rejected.

The material is in the David V. Beeken Collection.\n\nJohn Jarvis. From gravel to buddleia. 14-19.\n\nSituated off London Transport Watford branch the former gravel workings were used by London Transport to dump waste materials such as ash, concrete from tube permanent way, spent ballast and conductor rail insulators. For a time the residual Metropolitan Railway locomotives of 0-6-2T and 0-4-4T were used, but were replaced by former Great Western/Western Region 57XX pannier tanks which were adorned in Metropolitan red. Later battery electric locomotives took over and as they topped aznd tailed the trains tha former brake vans, some of which had been built by Hurst Nelson, ceased to be needed.

By steam to the steamers: the story of the Isle of Man boat trains. Â Part One. The first 100 years. 20-4.\n\nLiverpool was the main departure point, but Riverside station was not used and passengers made their own way from the City's stations, but most of these provided train seervices to connect with the the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company's vessels. The Furness Railway attempterd to encourage traffic via Barrow at Ramsden Dock or at Piel Pier, but was dependent upon other companies and the Midland Railway decided to develop Heysham and its own turbine steamer the Manxman. The LNWR and Lancashire & Yorkshire Railways encouraged traffic via Fleetwood and Blackpool Corporation ran boat trams to Fleetwood to encourage day return traffic to Douglas.There were sailings to Greenock and even to Glasgow, but Ardrossan was the major departure point using the Caledonain Railway's Montgomerie Pier.

The junctions at Firbeck. 28-30.\n\nThe South Yorkshire Coalfield was relatively late to be developed and the South Yorkshire Joint Railway was unusual in that all the formerly competitive railways came together to serve it with a line going north from Dinnington. It was owned by the Midland, Great Central, Great Northern, North Eastern and Lancashire & Yorkshire Railways. It served mines at Firbeck and at Haworth. A limited passenger service was operated between Doncaster and Shireoaks. This ended in 1926, but excursion traffic lasted longer.\n\nEast Anglian stopping points.

Inherited express passenger locomotives of the South Eastern & Chatham Railway. 38-45\n\nOn the London Chatham & Dover Railway at the time that the working agreement with the South Eastern Railway came into operation, the influence of Crampton was still vaguely seen in a few locomotives rebuilt by Martley, but the main influence was Wiliam Kirtley and his draughtsman Robert Surtees. On the South Eastern James Stirling (who like Kirtley came from a family of engineers) was the dominant influence.

Ripon Â a city no longer with a railway. Part One. 48-55.\n\nThere are real (as in royal) cities and most enjoy train services: St. Andrews, St. Davids, Wells and Ripon are disgraceful exceptions along with Walsingham which now enjoys basilica status. It was served by the Leeds & Thirsk Railway which was incorporated in 1845 and rapidly served the city from the Thirsk end in 1848 and more fully in the following year. It became the Leeds Northern Railway when it was extended from Melberby to Stockton via Northallerton. The viaduct adjacent to the River Ure was originally timber, but this was replaced by a masonry structure except for the actual crossing where an iron structure was erected which received an extensive repair in 1959. Includes a list of station masters who served at the station. Illustrations view from station towards the North Bridge (road bridge) and Cathedral (coloured postcard); (remainder J.W.

Binks. The origins, diagnoses and historical prevention of track failures. Part Two. 56-60\n\nRial failures: most can only be detected by ultrasonic equipment, ferro-magnetic testing or dye penetration. Vertical head and web splits are visible and can be measured by callipers. Wheelburns are cauded by slipping wheels. Star cracks radiate from bolt holes. Taches Ovalles start as shatter cracks during manufacture. Alumino-thermal defects are caused by faulty onsite welding and squats are fatigue defects generated in the wheel contact zone. Water is a major agent in track bed deterioration. Softwood sleepers are liable to rot and if a concrete sleeper is damaged water may enter and corrode the metal reinforcement. Flooding may scour out the ballast and leave the track without support. It may also lead to the collapse of embankments and cuttings. Railways constructed too near the sea may suffer repeated damage. Wet tunnels lead to rapid rail wear. Mining is also the cause of subsidence and track failure.

Peter Davis\n\nSince the Bristol and North Somerset Railway ran all the way to Frome Â the later (October p.604) statement \"there was once a mineral branch north west to Radstock\" makes no sense at all. A passenger service ran from Bristol Temple Meads to Frome until 31 October 1959 Â I rode on the last trains Â and the line was double track between Radstock and Mells Road. There was, however, a mineral branch, the private Newbury Railway, off this line to Vobster quarry and Newbury and Mackintosh collieries; and the other mineral line, from Hapsford Junction to Whatley quarry, is as far as I know still open. The remainder of the line between Hapsford and Radstock was mothballed years ago and has been the subject of disputes among rival interests over retention as a heritage railway or conversion to a cycle track. The B&NS could almost claim to be a cross-country main line since, post-World War II, it hosted a daily 'express service', the 'Boat Train' connecting with the up Channel Islands service from Weymouth at Frome. Leaving there at 17.55, it called at Radstock and Pensford only arriving in Bristol TM at 18.52.\n\nOn p.602 the branch from Hallatrow to Camerton, later extended, incorporating parts of the closed Somerset Coal Canal, to Lympley Stoke, is mentioned and we are told that \"Hamerton would benefit from a second platform (a bay) for the branch trains and then a third as the line was extended to Lympley.\" Presumably for \"Hamerton\" read \"Hallatrow\". Hallatrow became a crossing place in the remodelling of 1909 before which there was a single platform and a goods loop to the north which extended south into a headshunt with a platform face on the far side of the station building. The existing track plan is ambiguous as to whether on not this was purely a loading bay or used for Camerton departures. Specific photographic evidence is tantalisingly lacking but clearly shows a fence between the down platform and this bay. Mike Vincent in his excellent book, Through Countryside and Coalfield, OPC 1990, gives no clue as to the way Hallatrow was operated as a junction.\n\nWhereas mixed trains ran on the original 1882 Camerton branch, the through trains between Hallatrow and (usually) Freshford were either steam railmotors or a '517' 0-4-2T and auto coach.\n\nThe junction on the Bristol & Exeter main line for the Yeovil branch was at Durston (not Durlston) and there was never \"a further branch ... north east towards Castle Cary\" (both p. 603). The 'cut-off' between Castle Cary and Curry Rivel lunction west of Langport opened in the summer of 1906 and was an entirely new line as was the three-mile section from Athelney Junction to the split-level Cogload Junction.\n\nFinally, not mentioned, the branch from the East Somerset Railway to Merehead quarry is still open from Witham; it also forms the main line connection to the heritage East Somerset Railway. Otherwise a very interesting article with lots of human interest stories.\n\nThe train ferries. Paul Joyce\n\nHaving just read R.A.S. Hennessey's very fine article on train ferries, I then randomly picked up Ian. H. Lane's Plymouth Steam 1954-1963. In it he states \"The [Plymouth] breakwater is two miles offshore from the Hoe, a mile long ... The engineer commissioned to undertake its construction was Sir Joshua Rennie. Some of the stone was obtained from Quarries beside the River Plym at Oreston, and there, a 3ft 6in gauge railway was built. The stones were placed on wagons which were run onto the ships, which were fitted with rails in their holds, and taken out into the Sound. In the earlier years of work the stone was off-loaded by crane at the breakwater site. Eventually, however, rails and turntables were placed on the partly built breakwater. The wagons were lifted off the ships with their loads and returned to the ships empty when they had deposited the stone at the required place.\"\n\n'Let's go Glasgow Electric'. Stephen Abbott\n\nTo add to John Macnab's letter (November issue), a detailed Scottish Region account of the emergency reintroduction of steam trains was published in Trains Illustrated, July 1961. The notes which follow are a brief summary.\n\nAt 01.38 on Sunday 18 December 1960 it was agreed to run no trains at all that day and to re-establish the steam service by Monday morning. The 72 electric sets were gradually moved under their own power to stabling points including Ardmore and Hyndland, the process completed by 16.25. By 21.30 the 42 steam locomotives required had been transferred (some out of storage) from Glasgow area sheds and as far afield as Ardrossan, Hurlford, Bathgate and Hawick, to Eastfield, Park head, Kipps, Dumbarton, Helensburgh and Balloch. Helensburgh and Balloch sheds had to be reopened and coaling facilities provided at Bridgeton and Clydebank Dock Junction (replacing Hyndland). Soon after 08.00 a special stores train was arranged to run from Parkhead to Helensburgh conveying coal, oil, brake blocks, firebars, headlamps, shovels, etc.\n\nAt 14.00 representatives of the enginemen's local departmental committees were briefed and returned to their depots to help prepare rosters, completed by 21.30.ln all 294 footplate staff living over a wide area needed to be advised of their Monday duties. A few could be reached by telephone, but most had to be contacted by messenger, staff volunteering to help using their own cars and motorcycles.\n\nMeanwhile 272 coaches in 36 sets had to be assembled, mostly from stock stored at Bellahouston, Crookston, Smithy Lye, Rutherglen and in the Glasgow North District. These were inspected on Sunday morning and worked to suitable points for attention, where it was found that 100 rotary valves and 200 steam pipes had been pilfered during storage. Replacements were brought in from local depots by road transport and from Edinburgh and elsewhere by passenger train, but it was also found necessary to remove components from vehicles under repair in the main Glasgow works. Batteries also had to be brought in to replace those which had gone flat. By 18.30 examination and repair of coaches was nearing completion and as many staff as possible were released for a short rest. At 23.00 staff were booked on to clean and service the coaches, which had become very dirty during storage and steam heat them using specially provided locomotives.\n\nTimetable compilation was mainly down to four men; one worked out east-west timings, another west-east, a third checked for conflicts at junctions and the fourth determined complementary changes on the Riverside line. Stations and depots were kept informed of the general nature of the proposed train service and timetables and diagrams were distributed overnight on Sunday/Monday - in some cases station masters asked for delivery to their own homes and undertook to answer the door promptly at 04.00! The diagrams were too late to be linked with early rostering arrangement so staff were detailed at each terminal point on the Monday morning to advise the driver of each incoming train of his next turn, until rosters could be adjusted later in the day. With only a few hitches, the Monday morning train service operated to plan. A sad but necessary task was removal of the signs at Queen Street advertising the electric train service.\n\nThe new colour light signalling for the electric service included additional signals in tunnel sections. These reduced head ways with no danger of signals being obscured by smoke and the power doors prevented passengers from alighting from trains stopped at signals. For resumption of steam working, to avoid stopping a steam train in a tunnel, the signalling controls had to altered to prevent a station starting Signal from clearing until the line was unoccupied into the station ahead.\n\nTwo new stations at Garscadden and Hyndland had been built with 420ft platforms to accommodate six-car electric trains. As both are on a gradient of about 1 in 110 the Ministry ofTransport required them to be lengthened to 500ft to provide a margin for braking with steam traction. Platform extensions in timber were completed in 36 hours from approval of the work.\n\nTo echo Mr. Macnab, this was a remarkable effort, on a par with the gauge conversion west of Exeter in 1892 - but that had been planned for many months! Further response from the man then on the ground page 125\n\n'Let's go Glasgow Electric'. John Macnab\n\nAn error of my memory banks has revealed itself within a sentence of my letter published in the November issue whereby I state that \"If I recall aright\" (which I now find wrong) that the lady in charge of the office typing pool was honoured in some way for her work during the 'Blue Train' crisis. A lady was so honoured some ten years later totally unrelated to that particular occasion. Apologies for that - I wish to set the record straight.\n\nLNWR via Market Harborough. Stephen Spark\n\nIn your colour interlude on the LNWR Market Harborough line (September, p. 527) the caption suggests that grass behind the Met-Cam DMUs was set alight by a previous steam-hauled train. It is surely more likely that this was the result of controlled burning to prevent exactly that problem occurring. You will note that the blackened vegetation ends exactly at the fence line, which would be unlikely if set alight accidentally.\n\nI was brought up next to the Guildford New Line and remember my mother's frustration as the PW gang chose the best washing day to fill the air with smoke. It was unpleasant while it lasted, but the practice resulted in the neat, well- maintained lines ides we associate with the 1960s railway scene. A bonus was the magnificent display of primroses that passengers were able to enjoy in spring and similar splashes of colour from wild flowers in summer. The men knew their job, for I never saw the flames flick through the fence into our garden.\n\nFinale of the A4. Eric Oates\n\nThank you for the splendid article by Allan Trotter in respect of the last days of the 'Streaks' in Scotland including his account of the BR Farewell Special with No.60019 Bittern on 3 September 1966.\n\nI fear, however, his notes of locomotives seen that day at Aberdeen Ferryhill may have become a little blurred. The then-recently withdrawn NO.60034 Lord Faringdon was by this time stored at Perth shed, where the tender swap with No.60024 Kingfisher had taken placed on or about 24th August 1966. The tender-less A4 he described at Ferryhill on the final weekend was in fact No. 60004 William Whitelaw which had given up its corridor tender to No.60009 Union of South Africa for subsequent purchase and preservation by John Cameron. This latter A4 too was stored out of use at 61B at the same time. So our lucky author would have in fact seen four A4s on the Saturday of the BR special: Nos. 60004, 60009, 60019 and 60024. I was fortunate to get to Aberdeen the following morning and have my notes from that visit to confirm these details. I then joined the South West Railway Society Granite City tour for the southbound journey to Edinburgh with Kingfisher before Bittern then took over for the run to York and its own purchase by the late Geoff Drury.\n\nClearing the air. John C. Hughes\n\nIn my article on the ventilation of the Mersey Railway, November issue p. 696, I said that after leaving the board Francis Fox issued a pamphlet claiming that the company was saving money by running the fans more slowly and using cheaper fuel in the engines. I have now discovered that this information was originally provided when Fox was giving evidence to the Parliamentary inquiry into the ventilation of the Metropolitan Railway. This was in March 1897, at a time when Francis Fox was still on the board of the Mersey Railway and presumably knew whereof he spoke. This inquiry also produced some detailed information as to air quality at various points on the Mersey over a period of two days, suggesting that it was not too bad and certainly a lot better than the Met. Unfortunately, the Mersey's management did not need much notice of the inspection to ensure that the fans were going at full belt and that the engines were provided with the best fuel available.\n\nDown South.

Mark Smithers, Pen and Sword Transport, hardback, 171 pp. Reviewed SDW *****\n\nIt must be rare for a reviewer to be presented with a volume which is likely to become to be regarded as the 'standard work' on the subject matter considered - but this might just be one of those occasions!\n\nFrom the 1820s through the high Victorian days of Empire and on to the two world wars of the last century until its closure in 1967 the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich provided a significant proportion of the military might of British forces. Initially three 'factories' the sites were amalgamated in 1891 and, as at that time, railways were seen as the transport panacea, the Royal Arsenal Railways became an official entity.\n\nThis beautifully-produced book falls neatly into three parts, the history of the system, a consideration of the locomotives and rolling stock used on three gauges, 18 inches, two foot and standard gauge, within the system and a survey of the surviving remains of the system, both in situ at Woolwich and dispersed at various museums and preserved railways around the country in action. The book is lavishly, and appropriately, illustrated and has three remarkable maps at its heart. Copious appendices cover such wide-ranging topics as Arsenal staff, locomotive details ranging from 'pen pictures' of those supplied by Manning Wardle to histories of those machines on the 18 inch and standard gauges. There is a useful index.\n\nSurely going to be the standard work on the subject, a worthy addition to the store of railway literature - well-recommended!\n\nDark days and brighter days for Northern Ireland Railways. Edwin McMillan. Colourpoint, 288 pp. softback, Reviewed by DWM ***\n\nBooks of railway reminiscence have become fairly commonplace over recent years, usually involving themselves with tales of the footplate or signal box or, on occasion, the higher levels of railway management. This book takes an entirely different angle; written by an enthusiastic railwayman - and obviously a railway enthusiast, it is a very detailed account, from platform level, of the trials, tribulations and eventual triumph of the railways of Northern Ireland through the awful times of 'The Troubles' and on into the less turbulent present.\n\nThe book falls conveniently into three parts: an outline of the author's railway career, a detailed account of incidents and occurrences during 'The Troubles' and a more general account of railways operations. As well as the development of stations, special trains and operational accidents and incidents this latter section includes the formation of 'The Railway Patrol' - the author's remarkable initiative to deal with the little-addressed topic of anti-social behaviour, vandalism and trespass on the railway.\n\nThe detailed account of the attacks on the railway by terrorists is a darkly Northern Irish episode. The 'diary' style of the book works very well here and the damage and disruption caused by the explosions, fires and derailments is graphically illustrated.\n\nThroughout the book the photographs are a splendid and apposite selection, many of the author's own taking and, as ever, the Colourpoint 'style' has assured a book of considerable quality. To the best of your reviewer's knowledge there isn't a 'formal' history of Northern Ireland Railways in print at the present time. Were one to appear then this personal account would complement it brilliantly - a detailed story with a human touch and well worth a read.\n\nSwindon Works Â the legend. Rosa Matheson. History Press, 192 pp. Reviewed by DMA. ***\n\nEvery day men and women went into Swindon Works and every day locomotives and rolling stock, green, black, chocolate and cream came out. Every evening a tide of people left the Works football crowding the nearby streets. Every day those people coming out were more experienced, heavier with knowledge than they had been in the morning; the Works producing engineers as well as locomotives. Rosa Matheson's book is largely about the people who went 'Inside', their larks, accidents and experiences. She describes well known figures and gives a voice to many otherwise anonymous workers from 1840s to 1980s. Some loved their work and the sense of family, others (Alfred Williams for one) came to hate it, but all were shaped and transformed by their time behind those tall stone walls.\n\nOne product of Swindon Works that Matheson does not mention is Christopher Hinton (Material herein used to form part of new entry). While Matheson may not mention Christopher Hinton she does introduce a procession of Swindon characters and their memories of their time inside. lan Williams (great-great nephew of Alfred) captured the camaraderie of the place: \"To be honest, the rail works was one huge storybook where almost everyone knew everyone someway or other, and if you were on your own anywhere in the town, in a pub or club, cafe or bar, there would always be someone else who recognised you from 'the Works' and came across and chatted to you, so in a manner of speaking if you worked in the Works, you would never be alone wherever you went in the town.\"\n\nWith chapters on 'What was Swindon Works?', 'Fascinating Facts and Figures', 'Myths and Legends' and 'The Not-So-Good Bits, this slim book is not a reference volume to complement a fine library, it does not reveal new information. It is, however, a book you would buy for a young person in your life hoping that they might put down their phone for a few minutes to learn about their ancestors and the railway factory that made their town and made it famous. Matheson herself says\" As writers and publishers of history we have, I believe, a duty to bring this history to new and younger audiences, as well as faithful followers, so that the history of their forbears will not be lost ... \"\n\nSurrey with the frost on top.

They were accessible to the public within Dundee Docks (KPJ remembers Dad chatting to the driver of one in that location in 1948) Alistair's memories are a wee bit later and more detailed. The history of Dundee's industries and trade, based firstly on linen for sails, then on jute (and on the whale oil needed to transform it into a textile) led to the development of docks along the Tay estuary. Railway development was early in Dundee, sufficiently so for more than one gauge to co-exist for a time and these railways used the city streets for access, hence the title.

Most disputes concerning running powers were capable of being resolved by the Railway & Canal Traffic Commission. The dispute examined was between the Midland Railway and the Great Central Railway, partly in respect of rights granted to the Lancashire, Derbyshire & East Coast Railway. Very specifically they concerned traffic from Shirebrook Colliery over the Warsop Curve at Shirebrook Junction wherein the Great Central sought to use the Curve for traffic from Mansfield collieries. The case was handled by the Great Central's solicitor Dixon Davis and heard by Mr Justice Neville. Judgement was given on 24 October 1913 which upheld the Midland's restrictions on the use of the Curve. By this time the Great Central had gained access to Mansfield via the Mansfield Railway and in 1914 such disputes were contrary to the War Effort.

Robert Herriot\n\nI have been following this quite avidly as I grew up in Lanarkshire and in 1960, and for some years afterwards, travelled by train from Shettleston to Coatbridge Sunnyside to go to school. My memory of the 'Blue Trains' is slightly at odds with that of John Macnab in your November issue. On the Friday afternoon we all arrived at Sunnyside to hear that there had been an explosion on a train and that they were not running. We heard from the station staff that 'arrangements' were being made but there was no indication what these might be, While we waited no eastbound trains came through so it seemed that all services had been suspended. I suppose that bus substitution was out of the question as it was late on a Friday with the rush hour about to start and further it covered the whole of the NB tracks on the north side. What had been arranged eventually materialised in the form of a Vl/V3 and a string of carriages. I got home somewhat late but I can't remember what happened for the rest of the day and Saturday. See also letter from John Macnab on pp. 253-4.\n\nLet's go Glasgow Electric. John Macnab,\n\nWith reference to the fulsome detailing of the emergency events of 18th/19th December 1960 in the July 1961 issue of Trains Illustrated, I handed my copy of the magazine to be read by those in the Glasgow North operating office (particularly to the control staff so involved) who had participated and to give themselves a congratulatory pat on the back. My own article 'Blue Remembered Trains' published by Backtrack in the December 2000 issue also touches on this and includes a photograph of the hastily extended platforms at Hyndland along with a J37-hauled service. We were somewhat pushed for steam motive power! In another accompanying photograph EMU stock is shown en route to Manchester double-headed by two steam locomotives with covering/barrier LNER coaches for the necessary buckeye coupling connections as well as braking power.\n\nWe did find ourselves somewhat short of non-corridor stock that summer of 1961 and the Eastern Region sent around 100 coaches of various permutations and articulations to help out. They were, for the most part, displaced stock from Great Eastern and Marylebone suburban services and given a temporary reprieve from the breakers. All, however, were withdrawn and condemned by us the following summer. Th; restoration of services in October 1961 did not warrant the same degree of journalistic coverage - that of the previous year was truly an emergency.\n\nA steady climb. John Macnab\n\nWithin article (on Beattock) mention is made (p. 712) of a single coach being propelled on the Beattock-Moffat branch in the years from 1949 until 1952 notably by ex-L&YR 2-4-2T's that had provision for push-pull working. In this connection the 1953 allocation of coaching stock to the Scottish Region has a 1938-built composite non-corridor No.SC 179HM of Dia. 261A, or alternatively 1921A, and classified as motor-fitted stock that would appear to be the one used on this service. Hence the need for the guard to \"keep a sharp lookout\" as quoted it remained in general use on withdrawal of this particular service as a 'normal' composite until, on condemnation, broken up in Ardmore Yards in May 1964. The single brake third non-corridor on the 'Siege' service also illustrated on p 712 and unfortunately unidentifiable may also have been of interest as an individual vehicle.\n\nA steady climb. C.A. Allenby\n\nThe fatal accident near Beattock Summit mentioned by A.J. Mullay in his informative article occurred on 8th June 1950 at Harthope, about a mile and a half south of the Summit, caused by a fire on the 11.00 Birmingham to Glasgow which resulted in the death of five passengers.\n\nWhilst not as serious, two collisions in the Beattock vicinity were of sufficient concern to the Railway Inspectorate for them to produce official 'Railway Accident' reports for the Ministry of Transport. On 18 May 1969 the 21.30 Euston to Inverness passenger train failed a mile and a half north of Greskine signal box. Assistance was rendered by the 22.15 Euston to Glasgow passenger train with the Beattock pilot coupled to the rear. Unfortunately the Inverness train initially pulled away from the Glasgow train, they were not coupled, only for it to then to come to a sudden stop. The inevitable collision resulted in the death of the Glasgow train driver and slight injuries to a total of nineteen passengers and two sleeping car attendants from the two trains.\n\nOn 6 October 1971 the Class 6 01.40 Motherwell to Margam steel train lost control descending Beattock bank owing to the brake power being insufficient and was running at a speed estimated to be 80mph when it ran into the Class 8 (maximum speed 35mph) 00.30 Motherwell to Carlisle mixed freight train at a point just under two miles south of Beattock station. This resulted in the death of the Carlisle freight train guard.\n\nThe departure list. George Smith\n\nI am advised, by Tom Hutchinson, that the picture on p751 is of Black Boy Incline, Shildon, not the nearby Brusselton incline. However, my comments on the public's lackadaisical attitude to early railways are still relevant. I can only offer apologies and say in my defence that the picture I used came from an old postcard that someone marked up 'Brusselton Incline' on the reverse.\n\nHigh Speed Trains. L.A. Summers\n\nI was interested to see your evocation of the career of the BR High Speed diesel trains, now Class 43, with which, apart from the last suggestion, and possibly, surprisingly, I largely agree. There is no doubt that these sets are a significant success story not matched by their imitators and successors. That said, let us be clear that this does not support the view that main line dieselisation on BR was a successful replacement policy for much more expensive electrilication. The evidence shows that diesel locomotive utilisation was, in many cases, no better than when steam was being deployed intelligently and that the supposed economic advantages were only achieved with long-term operation. It was realised, first on the Continent, possibly in Italy, that the diesel locomotive-hauled train had many of the same restraints as a steam-hauled one and that this could best be improved by building high power railcar (or DMU) trains. The FS Settebello sets were an expression of this change in approach. This, I suggest, is the reason why locomotive- hauled passenger trains are rare, replaced by railcars that can run in any direction without the restraints incurred by both steam and diesel locomotives. As an aside I believe that it would have been possible, had the desire existed, to improve both steam and diesel locomotive utilisation by providing a driving van at the rear of a train, but that is a different matter. Also, while saluting the HST let's not suggest that we approve of the Government's asinine truncation of the GWR main line electrification project. Short-termism of this kind has bedevilled the railway infrastructure for far too long. The WR main lines should have been electrified 35 years ago.\n\nUps and down the City roads. Michael Elliott\n\nThe Scammell Scarab shown in the illustration on the rear cover of the December 2016 edition is of interest in that the vehicle concerned - KLC 268 - is one of around one hundred Scarabs that received a non-standard cab built in the Eastern Region workshops at Temple Mills rather than the steel cab supplied by Scammell. The KLC registration number is one of series issued by the London County Council to commercial vehicles from September 1949; the Scarab was introduced in 1948as a replacement for the original model MH Mechanical Horse that went into production in 1933. The Temple Mills workshops continued to build bodies for British Railways road vehicle fleet into the 1960s.\n\nVisiting Kentish Town and Cricklewood. Leonard Rogers\n\nUnlike those on many remaining named steam locomotives in 1964 and 1965, which were removed as an anti-theft measure, the Sherwood Forester plates on 'Royal Scot' No.46112 were taken off as early as September 1961, although the locomotive was not withdrawn until April 1964. At this time the name was transferred to brand-new No.D100, the first of over twenty of Class 45 to receive regimental names, most of which had previously been carried by 'Royal Scot' or 'Patriot' Class steam locos. No.46112 was an Annesley locomotive at the time of Geoff Rixon's photograph and, in all probability, would have worked into Marylebone. Cricklewood was the servicing base for GC line steam after the closure of Neasden in June 1962. Notice that the supporting brackets for the nameplates have been neatly removed - many locomotives which had their plates removed in later years had supports and/or backing plates crudely left in situ.\n\nThe train ferries. Bert Blissett.\n\nAlthough it is always difficult, with the passage of time, to define 'cause and effect', my recollection of the last two cross- Channel train ferry services (Harwich- Zeebrugge and Dover-Dunkerque) is that the proposed Channel Tunnel weighed much less importantly in the equation in the 1980s than is implied in the articles. The major investment made in the late 1980s in this activity involved the building of a large new ship (the Nord-Pas de Calais) for SNCF's Armement Naval, specilically to concentrate the remaining railborne traffic on one single route (the shorter one, permitting three and occasionally four round trips per 24 hours, with a single vessel). In order to achieve this, significant new investment was made at both Dover (Admiralty Pier) and Dunkerque (Port Ouest). Once the NPC entered service (indeed some months prior to that), the days of the Harwich operation were numbered, with or without the prospect of transfer to a future Tunnel, and irrespective of the sale of Sealink.\n\nOne minor detail among many that could be added: in 1972 the Cambridge Ferry made ten voyages from Harwich to Dublin transporting rolling stock to ClE. For a comprehensive account of the last years of Britain's train ferry activity, I can highly recommend the article by D. Ratcliffe and Ernie Puddick in Rail Express, Feb. 2006. One further detail: the NPC ceased conveying rail freight traffic not in 1994 as stated, but on 22 December 1995, long after some freight flows had commenced using the Channel Tunnel; one unresolved dilemma concerned the highly-profitable flows of dangerous goods which were banned from the Tunnel but were insufficient to sustain a vestigial train ferry operation.\n\nOn a totally different tack, I was surprised (in the author's justified encomium of Follet Holt) to see the Entre Rios Railway described as \"prestigious\". In its London boardroom perhaps: but in Argentina it was a byword for impecunious and unreliable rail transport, a bit like the Eastern Counties Railway or the London, Chatham & Dover Railway in UK. It was built to serve the low-lying and backward area known to Argentinians as 'Mesopotamia', between the Parana and Uruguay rivers, which (with its railway) was frequently flooded. Until the first of these rivers was bridged in 1977 by the Zarate-Brazo Largo viaduct, a journey between its catchment area and Buenos Aires involved the ferry crossing (to/from Ibicuy) mentioned by the author. Efficient these ferries may have been, but they nevertheless added to the impression of an interminable and unpredictable journey: their passengers' views may have been coloured by memories of the collision in 1926 of two of the ferries (the Maria Parera and the Lucia Carbo), the former sinking in less than fifteen minutes. Finally, in support of the author's thesis of British-inspired train ferries elsewhere in the world, he might have mentioned the Romanshorn-Friedrichshafen operation on Lake Constance (opened 1869) where, as Ransome-Wallis relates, \"the steam ferry ship to operate these services was designed by an Englishman, J. Scott-Russell, a Member of the ICE and, in his day, an authority on ferries\".\n\nBob Farmer's Index Bob Farmer's usual page-by-page index to Backtrack Vol.30 can be had from him at bob.rosemary.farmer&gmail.com\n\nBook Reviews. 126\n\nMatthew Murray 1765-1826 and the firm of Fenton, Murray and Co., 1795-1844. Paul Murray Thompson. 498pp, 100 b&w illustrations, softback, privately published in a limited edition of 500 by the author. reviewed by MR *****\n\nThe author is a direct descendant of Matthew Murray and came to his subject from that personal connection and has thus found the time and had the patience for his researches that otherwise may have had time limitations. The result, this considerable volume, is as he admits \"more of a source history of the records\" than a typical biographical narrative. For the cognoscenti, however, this compendium, including contemporary drawings and engravings will be of inestimable value. Some previous writings have suggested that Murray might have been born in Stockton-on-Tees but here it seems clear that he originated in Northumberland and grew up and received his early work experience on Tyneside.\n\nHe has become known as 'the Father of Leeds Engineering', his early work in that city being associated with John Marshall and the attempts to introduce and improve machinery for the production of textiles other than cotton; in particular linen from flax.\n\nWhen he became involved in his own partnership and the building and growth of the Round Foundry in Water Lane, the range of his interest grew considerably. He made many improvements to the steam engine and was to manufacture a great number of engines for many applications including marine ones. Other innovations involved machinery and also structural ironwork for the erection of fireproof mills and factories.\n\nHe will be best known to readers of this magazine for being the first commercial manufacturer of steam railway locomotives: those built to John Blenkinsop's rack system although Blenkinsop's patent only covered the rack rail and pinion gear arrangement (the high pressure non-condensing engine was Trevithick's). Murray's contributions were much longer-lasting: two cylinders set at 90 degrees and the 'D' slide-valve. The Round Foundry constructed seven of these locomotives before Murray ceased their manufacture. He was well aware of the safety concerns around high-pressure steam especially when such equipment was in the hands of the careless. Most land and marine boilers worked at low pressures at that time.\n\nThus he turned down George Stephenson's request to quote for a locomotive engine for the Stockton & Darlington Railway, although just before his death he proposed a machine with a seperate boiler and engine units with chain coupling between their axles, ostensibly to reduce axle weight and prevent rail breakages (especially where cast iron was used).\n\nA few years after his death in 1826, the company changed its policy and 71 locomotives were built for twenty railway companies in England and continental Europe between 1831 and 1842 and notably 23 for the broad gauge Great Western Railway. Twenty were express passenger 'Firefly' Class 2-2-2s and their designer Daniel Gooch was to report that they were the best made of the seven firms which had supplied the type to his company. Fenton, Murray & Jackson closed in 1844. A series of events concerning debts and bankrupcy brought the end just as the 'Railway Mania' was reaching its height.\n\nThis is not a book for reading in bed Â it weighs in at over 41b! However, it is printed on the best quality paper and in a large font with wide line spacings, making it easy to follow the mix of text, extended quotations and transcribed documents, even for elderly eyes. The only quibble is with the index which is rather inadequate and a few numbered sub-headings in each chapter in conjunction with an extended contents page would help to navigate through a complex work. This is essential for anyone interested in industrial and mechanical engineering developments in this period and beyond.\n\nCommuters: the history of a British way of life. Simon Webb. Pen and Sword History. paperback. 150pp. Reviewed by GBS ***\n\nAt some times and in some countries it seemed that commuter traffic around great cities would be the last refuge of passenger travel by rail, and commuting is so bound up with the economy and social life of modern nations that it is surprising that it seems never to have received the comprehensive treatment it deserves. This popular survey of the topic in Great Britain, down through history and covering all transport modes, is therefore welcome.\n\nThough short the book is wide-ranging. It covers the distant origins of the journey between home and work, long before the term 'commuting' was coined and imported from the United States. Travel on foot, by boat, by bus and tram, by train, and by motor car are covered in lively style. There is a pleasing diversion into literary coverage of commuting habits, as well as rather more recherche discussions of the etymology of the word and of the social stratification latent in different modes, such as the popular associations of the tram and the more refined ambience of the bus (although one wonders if steady embourgeoisement really caused the triumph of the latter, as implied). The separation of home and work, a crucial factor in industrialisation and hence the birth of the modern world, depended on public transport, and the process is well described. There is an index and a selection of illustrations, together with a bibliography.\n\nThis is an accessible summary of a complex and important subject, supported by an interesting range of anecdote and reference. Sadly, it would have benefited from more careful research and editing, and is slightly marred by avoidable howlers. For example, the unusual Gravesend and Northfleet line was not the 'first electric tram to run in Britain'; and the Northern City Line, site of the appalling 1975 accident, most certainly did not run between 'West Drayton, a station near near London Airport, and Moorgate'. A useful introduction, but the definitive book on the subject is still to come.\n\nStephenson's Rocket 1829 onwards Â Owners' Workshop Manual An insight into the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the iconic steam locomotive. Richard Gibbon. Haynes Publishing. 160pp. Reviewed by RW ****\n\nAlthough this book, which was produced in conjunction with the Science Museum, is in the form of the well known Haynes car service manuals, it is not just a manual but a full account of the origins of this most famous locomotive and its various replicas which have been made since 1829, together with the those of Novelty and Sans Pareil, built for the 1980 Rocket 150 celebration.\n\nAfter an introduction, the book continues with the development of steam- powered railways. particularly in Durham, andthe planned Liverpool to Manchester (L&M) Railway proposing a competition for the best locomotive, culminating in the Rainhill Trials of 1829. The book then deals with with the opening of the L&M itself and the part played by Rocket in the early operation of the line. Chapter Two deals in detail with the construction of Rocket itself, with particular reference to the original locomotive in its present form and the sectioined replica made for the Science Museum in 1935. Chapter Three contains accounts of their various experiences from people who had travelled in trains drawn by Rocket itself, or a replica, either as a passenger or on the footplate as crew.\n\nThe next chapter starts with a Rocket maintemance chart as for a car, showing the daily lubrication points, together with the other essential maintenance tasks such as boiler washouts, which have to be performed at regular intervals in order to ensure continued efficient operation. Chapter Five discusses the ten known replica Rockets which have been built since 1829 up to 2010. Chapter Six discusses how full size working replicas of pioneer locomotives, as at Beamish, can bring railway history vividly to life. The book then describes the two replicas, Novelty and Sans Pareil, the other main contenders for the L&M Â£500 Prize, and their part, with the replica Rocket, in the 2002 renactment of the Rainhill Trials (actually held in Wales) for a BBC television programme, continuing with the recent replica Rocket, made in 2010 .\n\nThe last chapter discusses how Rocket (apart from having no brakes) became the template for almost all the steam locomotives which followed for over 150 years. The book ends with a glossary of technical terms, some supplementary information and a comprehensive index.\n\nFlying Scotsman LNER Class A1/A3 Pacific 4472, 1923 onwards. Phil Atkins. Hayes Publishing, Reviewed by APT ****\n\nWhy is LNER Class A3 4-6-2 No.4472 Flying Scotsman so famous and popular with the public? It was certainly not the best member of the class performance-wise, but it was the first steam locomotive to be officially credited with 100mph and also it was the first Pacific delivered to the newly formed LNER.\n\nUndoubtedly, a further reason for the popularity is that the name it carries it overcomes that common confusion present in the public's mind - namely the differentiation between a train and a locomotive - it is so much easier when they are called one and the same. The name Flying Scotsman was only applied to the engine when it was displayed at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924. Although it had long been applied unofficially to east coast 'Scotch' expresses, it was only also in 1924 that it was applied officially to the 10.00am(ish) service for Edinburgh and, of course, its corresponding up working.\n\nIn preservation, the engine has long been popular with the public starting right from the moment when Alan Pegler bought it from British Railways and, in a series of well publicised runs, was able to operate it over the national network, enabling thousands of spectators and enthusiasts to see it - your reviewer being one. Subsequently the engine has experienced more drama and excitement than perhaps any locomotive is entitled to, including trips to the USA and Australia, plus several changes of ownership prompted by bankruptcy. These adventures culminated in a dramatic rescue by Sir William McAlpine to avoid it being broken up for scrap to payoff debts. Then, in 2004 Â this time to prevent it possibly going abroad - the locomotive was saved for the nation by the NRM purchasing it under sealed bids for Â£2.31 million Â somewhat more than the Â£3,000 Alan Pelger paid for the engine in 1963 Â and representing an annual price rise of 18 per cent.\n\nInitially the NRM intended to use No.4472 to haul charter trains out of York but it quickly became apparent to its latest owner that the engine was in far poorer condition than the museum had been led to believe. The decision was taken in September 2004 to admit the engine to the NRM workshops for a 'heavy intermediate repair'. Unfortunately, on leaving the workshop in May 2005, the repairs did not have the desired effect of improving itseighteen-month heavy general repair in January 2006, which was intended to be a full restoration of the locomotive.\n\nIt was then that the problems started in earnest. It would prove to be one of the extremest overhaul and renewal projects undertaken so far in the heritage railways sector but this was not realized at the start. Secondly, the NRM found itself to be ill-equipped to carry out the overhaul. The work started without a plausible restoration plan, using the museum's in-house technical staff who, in fairness, were not geared up for a multi-million pound restoration scheme. Unfortunately, the NRM did not have the professional engineering capacity or experience to describe in sufficient detail the work required using drawings and detailed specifications in modern electronic format. This prevented it from having parts of the restoration carried out by large-scale, commercial, non-railway engineering companies. Consequently, it had to rely on the small 'cottage industry' companies that have sprung up since 1968 in support of the heritage railway scene.\n\nSuch a large project. being almost wholly dependent on such comparatively limited engineering capacity. ensured it inevitably took a long time to complete Â even if this was not anticipated at the outset. That it took ten years was partly due to the NRM's inexperience in managing such a large project. A deficiency in project planning and management meant mistakes were made, procedures such as checking the frame structure for cracking and alignment was performed late and out of sequence, consequently some work had to be done twice. But anyone who had seen the engine running during one of its many appearances in 2016 will not be left in any doubt that an excellent restoration and rebuild has been done.\n\nThe book is subtitled an insight into maintaining, operating and restoring the legendary steam locomotive - and that precisely sums it up. The latter half describes the restoration in some detail accompanied by a large number of photographs illustrating the different stages and processes involved in the rebuilding.\n\nThe first half looks at the genesis of the Gresley Al Class Pacific, its metamorphosis into the A3 Class, together with chapters on how Flying Scotsman was originally constructed, together with something of its operational life. Once again, these chapters are accompanied by photographs of the procedures and parts of locomotive anatomy together with some drawings.\n\nAltogether, a book that should particularly appeal to the enthusiast who is not just interested in Flying Scotsman, but who is also keen to learn just how much work and effort goes into the restoration of steam locomotives so that they may continue to run in the 21st century.\n\nAnyone for Rugby.

The author is unfortunate not to have traversed the line in the days of steam, but relied upon the memories of Jeff Pegller who worked on the banking engines and the somewhat better known Chalford Autos from the 1940s until the demise of steam, and Lionel Padin, a Chalford local historian. The Cheltenham & Great Western Union Railway was conceived in response to a London & Birmingham Railway threat to serve Cheltenham by a branch off from Tring. It was a broad gauge line and linked Swindon with Gloucester and Cheltenham via Sapperton Tunnel responding to the route of the Thames & Severn Canal.

Boosters and steam tenders. 155-9\n\nThe text is headed by a Robin Barnes painting (colour) of an Archibald Sturrock steam tender with the cab of the locomotive enveloped in steam. The text attempts to show that Sturrock may not have been the first to adopt the technique and was certainly not the last as shown by many other examples mainly taken from material in the Locomotive Magazine, but some from Drury . Verpilleux, working with Seguin in France was probablly the first in 1843 (see Locomotive Mag., 1934, 40, 174) and subsequently modified the locomotive with a larger boiler (illustrated). Sturrock's programme is covered by Grove which Macnair raises to the status of \"definitive work\" and the books and Backtrack article by Vernon as well as the steamindex GNR page. Charles Sacre of the Manchester Sheffield & Lincolnshire also particpated in the steam tender project by ordering ten steam tenders from Neilson. Macnair adds an additional ill-omen for Sturrock: that he did not get on with Packe who virtually owned the Great Northern and left assisting in the foundation of the Yorkshire Engine Co. Some of the redundant steam tenders were converted by Isaac Watt Boulton into saddle tanks. The Eastern Railway in France built at least one steam tender locomotive to work in the Viosges mountains and Neilson & Co. built ten to work on the Cordoba & Belmez in Spain and these lasted seven years. Neilson also supplied four steam tenders to the Caledonian Railway and these were attached to Connor 189 class 2-4-0 engines, but these were inadequate: but were more satisfactory when attached to the more powerful 197 class. The programme failed to be enlarged as it had been intended to fit them to the first twelve of a new class of 0-4-2 in 1861, but the mofied tenders were cancelled.. The steam tenders were useful for providing extra braking power. The concept did not die but emerged in three vast Mallet compounds built for the Erie Railroad with steam tenders given a Whyte classification of 2-8-8-8-2 and known as Triplexes (illustrated). Once the grate area had been increased the three worked as bankers until 1927. Drury states that Baldwin supplied a similar locomotive to the Virginian Railroad (see also Locomotive Mag., 1917, 23, 85) for banking between Elmore and Clark's Gap, but it was too large to negotiate a tunnel on the intended incline and had to be cut down into two locomotives. Rather more successful was the programme instigated by J. Hainen on the Southern Railway (USA) to fit steam tenders based on withdrawn 2-8-0 and 2-6-0 locomotives to augment the power of 2-8-2s working between Asheville North Carolina and Hayne South Carolina. These enabled an extra 300 tons to be handled over relativelly long distances. A Poultney steam tender was fitted to 15 inch gauge River Esk 2-8-2. (illustrated). Finally a turbine was fitted to the tender of a reciprocating steam locomtive: this was both described in the Locomotive Magazine and demonstrated by Henschel to members of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers (illustrated).

Illustrations: London Transport trams on conduit track outside Clapham Junction station in 1935: see letter from Graham Smith for more precise location and notes on the mainly unvestibuled E/1 class former London County Council tram cars dominating the street scene at Vauxhall; Marsh 4-6-2T No. 32326 (malchite green) with an up Oxted train in 1949 at Clapham Junction; M7 0-4-4T No. 30248 approching Earlsfield with empty stock; LBSCR B4 4-4-0 No. 210 with LBSCR Royal Train under wires south of Clapham Junction c1910 see also letter from Bill Armsttrong on page 254 who writes about the boiler classification of this Royal performer and other LBSCR locomotives; 4 SUB No. 4352 approaching Clapham Junction c1955; Lord Nelson No. 30855 Robert Blake in Wandsworth cutting with up Ocean Liner Express on 2 June 1959; King Arthur No. 30788 Sir Urre of the Mount in Clapham sidings in November 1961; LBSCR parcels office at Clapham Junction extant \"today\" (colour); C class 0-6-0 No. 31510 on empty stock approaching Vauxhall on 1 July 1961; interior of Battersea Park station on 6 September 2006 (colour); Battle of Britain class No. 21C163 in malchite green at Stewarts Lane in 1947; E4 0-6-2T No. 32500 detached itself from empty stoack on approach to Clapham Junction in November 1961; Eurostar departing from Waterloo International with Big Ben behind (colour)\n\nJohn C. Hughes. Carruthers (and others). 189\n\nAdvertisement for Dr Tibbles' Vi-Cocoa from Liverpool Daily Post (22 March 1900) showing L. Carruthers making a drink in a signal cabin on the Liverpool Overhead Railway. In 1902 James Logan Carruthers was convicted of fraud from the LOR (Liverpool Echo, 8 November 1902)\n\nReaders' Forum. 190\n\nDispute over running powers. Editor\n\nA gremlin struck and transposed the photograph captions, as eagle-eyed readers doubtless noticed. Apologies all round. Ed.\n\nSnaigow and Durn. John Roake\n\nDavid Williams, in his piece about Snaigow and Dum states these locomotives, as had many other Highland Railway locomotives in the past, carried the names of the residences of directors of the Highland Railway, a statement which has been made many times before. But is this actually correct, even if the result is the same? In the Scottish Highlands it was (is?) usual to speak or refer to an untitled gentleman in possession of an estate colloquially by the name of that estate. Thus the Highland Railway was following the practices of other railway companies by naming their locomotives after the directors of the company, it just so happening that in Highland circles those directors shared their names with that of their estates.\n\nSwindon-built diesel multiple units in Scotland. John Macnab\n\nTrailer Composite Corridors Nos. 59402-12 are shown to be both as working Edinburgh- Glasgow and Glasgow-Ayr and Stranraer services. That shown for the latter is correct. There is also no mention of the two Trailer Buffet Firsts Nos. 59098/9 that formed part of the 'Ayrshire' allocation. It is correct that Motor Seconds Nos.79088 and 79168 transferred to Ayr with Trailer Firsts 79470/9 becoming, in effect, surrogate Class 126 along with their Ayr counterparts on the inception of TOPS. Incidentally, we in the coaching rolling section at Glasgow HQ never referred to trailers within these sets having a differing TOPS number, eg Class 188, simply regarding the unit(s) as one class. Prior to this in the 1960s several individual Edinburgh-Glasgow Motor Seconds were 'loaned' to Ayr depot from time to time. There was never to my knowledge a reciprocal movement. Of the Aberdeen-Inverness sets one was borrowed for several years in the early 1960s to work a Glasgow Queen Street-Oban summer timetabled service routed via Crianlarich Upper and Lower. The photograph on p101 of a lengthy DMU working departing for Aberdeen shows an anomaly in that the leading Class 120 appears to be without its Trailer Buffet Second.\n\nOne other Swindon aspect of these units was that all bore, when new, the Regional owning prefix as 'Sc' as opposed to the normal. shall we say correct, SC The only other builder to do likewise was Craven's of Sheffield for the Class 311 EMUs.\n\nPick a colour. David Cable\n\nThe caption to the photograph (February) of the Class 47 in Porterbook purple and white needs amplifying. There were five locomotives carrying variations of the Porterbrook house colours: two Class 47s, Nos.47 807 and 47 817, Class 55 No.D9016, Class 57 No..57 601 and Class 87 No. 87 002, the latter carrying a different style on both side of the bodywork. Interested readers can see photographs of all of these in my book Lost Liveries of Privatisation, published around six years ago by lan Allan. As a matter of interest, Porterbrook also leased out three Class 170 DMUs (Nos.170397-9) which carried various non-standard colours.\n\nMore GWR Improvement Schemes. Terry McCarthy\n\nThe caption of photograph on p. 112 of the February issue has incorrectly interpreted the positions of the locomotive shown. No.6338 is not on a platform road, but is on the up relief line It is unlikely, therefore, to be preparing 'to leave with an up local'. More probably it is on a goods train, awaiting the signals on the gantry to change. Furthermore, I venture to suggest No. 5096 is passing on the down relief, as suggested by the direction the safety valve steam is blowing, possibly heading for Cardiff Canton shed. The track visible behind No. 6338 is the up through Platform 2, while the outer rail of the down platform track can be seen between the edge of Platform 3 and No. 5096.\n\nAlso on p. 113 the last sentene, at the end of the third paragraph under the sub-heading 'Cardiff General Station' states: \"The TVR was the first steam operated railway connecting the inland collieries and ironworks to the port of Cardiff and from 1840 to 1923 the TVR steadfastly remained independent and aloof of the mighty GWR.\"To be accurate, the TVR was incorporated in 1836, but amalgamated with the GWR on 1st January 1922, following the passage of the Railways Act, 1921.\n\nOn p. 114, under the sub-heading 'Cardiff General station improvements 1933/4', the second paragraph is rather ambiguous. The TVR gained access to Cardiff General with the construction of a link. between the Queen Street-Bute Road line in 1896, which enabled the TVR to link its Valleys and Penarth and Cadoxton lines for through passenger services. However, the Rhymney Railway line did not gain access to Cardiff General until July 1928, when the former RR route was connected to the TVR route into Queen Street station and onwards to Cardiff General.\n\nL and L1 Class 4-4-0s. Neil Knowlden\n\nOn p97 (February) caption No. 31772 was \"leading a Chatham 'birdcage' carriage\" is a little misleading as all such vehicles had been formed into permanent formations for many years and \"a Chatham 'birdcage' set\" might have been appropriate phraseology. In fact, these sixty-footers always had been in sets of three (apart from a couple of sets augmented at different dates) with a 'birdcage' at both ends and another typical set is shown in the upper photograph but you might notice the 'plain' roof at the far end in the middle photograph so this is undoubtedly set No. 571 which included brake third 3464. Nobody seems to have discovered why this "
