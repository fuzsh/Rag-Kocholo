This is one fact I ­will offer. Iw ­ ill not offer much information on other topics some readers might expect in a book about marijuana and Africa. I offer very l­ittle about Rastafarianism, for instance, and mention Bob Marley just once more. ­These examples are crucial in a history of cannabis broader than this one. My research period ends in approximately 1925, a few years before Rastafarianism arose in Jamaica. I have chosen 1925 b­ ecause this was when cannabis was first listed in an international drug-­control agreement, which initiated the now familiar condition of global cannabis prohibition. This book is about what preceded the familiar. For the period before 1925, I touch on some characters that frequently appear in cannabis histories, including Scythians, Queen Victoria, and the Bena Riamba. Perhaps ­these characters are unfamiliar to you; their parts ­will unfold. What­ever your awareness of cannabis in the global past, I ­will touch on the unfamiliar, ­because I focus on Africa. I make a s­ imple argument: Africa has been neglected in popu­lar and scholarly histories of cannabis, and this neglect undermines the capacity of global socie­ties to manage the plant drug. ­There are no histories of psychoactive cannabis in any continental region, not just Africa. However, Africa is especially impor­tant. African knowledge is foundational to the now dominant global use of cannabis as a smoked drug. If you know nothing about cannabis except that it can be a smoked drug, your knowledge traces to Africa.\n\nfigure 1.1. The imagery and content of Jamaican reggae ­music has ­shaped popu­lar understanding of cannabis in Africa. Reggae lyr­ics that celebrate ganja and African heritage reflect views within Rastafarianism and Jamaican society, not an awareness of the plant’s ­actual African past. Photo­graph by Sheila G. Duvall.\n\n­ ere is an enormous lit­er­a­ture on cannabis. I do not cover it all. At points, Th I am quite critical of recent portrayals of the plant’s history. I mention publications ranging in substance from The Lancet to Playboy magazine. My view is that histories of cannabis—­whether book-­length scholarly studies, vignettes in medical lit­er­a­ture, or tidbits in popu­lar media—­are poorly researched and unjustifiably neglect Africa. My critiques may seem frivolous—it should be obvious that ads in Playboy may be misleading—­only if you overlook the closeness of pop culture and academic discourse about cannabis. The same factual errors appear in high and low places, ­because the same conceptual errors are shared across society. The conditions of cannabis prohibition have warped ideas about the plant. The collective historical narrative about cannabis is built predominantly from pretentious, po­liti­cally motivated factoids rather than documented evidence about the plant’s past. Africa is ignored in the collective historical narrative. The widely shared nonportrayal overlooks the fundamental importance of African knowledge to the global practice of cannabis smoking. More impor­tant, the nonportrayal of Africa intellectually justifies notions that drug use is a racially determined 4 chapter one\n\nIn New York City, during 1997–2008, 53% of people arrested for marijuana possession were Black,\n\nIn Chicago, during 2012–2014, 78% of people arrested for marijuana possession were Black,\n\nand 26% of the population was Black.\n\nand 33% of the population was Black.\n\n35% of the population was White,\n\n45% of the population was White,\n\nand 12% of people arrested for marijuana possession were White.\n\nand 4% of people arrested for marijuana possession were White.\n\nIn the U.S. in 2010, among males aged 18-25,\n\n17% of Blacks and 20% of Whites admitted to using marijuana in the past month. figure 1.2.

The collective narrative, being unconstrained by evidence of the plant’s African past, enables anti-­Black, racial ste­reo­types about cannabis drug use. In the United States, one outcome of t­ hese ste­reo­types is biased drug-­law enforcement.1 Again, however, my focus is on Africa and the period before 1925. I do not offer much on current drug-­law enforcement, primarily comments about its intellectual basis. My focus is on what preceded the familiar. To understand why cannabis appears in international drug laws at all, for instance, the intellectual pathway leads to colonial Africa. Neglect of Africa in cannabis history has real-­world consequences in and beyond the continent. African knowledge lies at the foundation of the dominant Cannabis and Africa 5\n\nglobal culture of psychoactive cannabis use, even as Pan-­African experiences are ignored in developing approaches to managing the plant as an economic, pharmacological, ecological, and po­liti­cal resource.2 To understand cannabis in the modern world, the pathway leads to Africa.\n\ncannabis is among the most widely recognized plants. Its leaf is globally iconic. This book is written for ­people who know that cannabis can supply psychoactive drugs, as well as industrial products such as fiber for rope or cloth. Many p­ eople know l­ittle ­else about the plant. Some ­people know brief anecdotes about its history; George Washington and Queen Victoria are sometimes mentioned. A few p­ eople with especial interests in the plant have published world histories of it. World histories of cannabis comprise a distinct literary genre. Among the canon, Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany (2013) is a new classic; Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana (2012) and Cannabis: A History (2005) have both sold many copies for mass-­market publishers; Marihuana: The First Twelve Thousand Years (1980) is foundational to many newer works.3 The most influential of all is The Emperor Wears No Clothes, an anti-­prohibition tale first published 1985 and now in its twelfth American En­glish edition, with editions in other languages and countries.4 The Emperor is as poorly researched as widely read. Many works offer shorter histories, ranging from the obscure to the current mainstream (such as in 2014’s authoritative Handbook of Cannabis).5 Many physicians have offered historical vignettes about cannabis to justify their scientific interest in medical marijuana (see chapter 10). George Washington somehow used cannabis, so why ­shouldn’t we?6 The vignettes of scholars blend with the sound bites of popu­lar media to become common knowledge about the plant’s history, a knowledge poorly rooted in facts.7 It is not true, for instance, that “Cannabis has been used throughout the world for thousands of years and by all types of social classes, including Queen Victoria in the 1800s.”8 Cannabis histories reflect the political-­economic conditions of their authorship. Most have been written by authors interested in advancing po­liti­cal arguments for or against the drug plant’s prohibition. Cannabis histories display po­liti­cal advocacy more than desire to build knowledge and test assumptions about the past.9 The first serious history of marihuana in Mexico, of all places, was published in 2012, Isaac Campos’s Home Grown: Marijuana and the Origins of Mexico’s War on Drugs.10 Other serious historians have investigated cannabis elsewhere. Some who have looked at the plant drug in African socie­ties include Emmanuel Akyeampong, Johannes Fabian, Gernot Klantschnig, Liat Kozma, 6 chapter one\n\nJames Mills, David Gordon, and Wolfgang Cremer. Academic histories are much less well circulated, though, than popu­lar books like The Emperor. Po­liti­cal debates about cannabis in current socie­ties have ­shaped knowledge about the plant in past socie­ties. Real historical events have been overlooked, or, if noticed, spun beyond recognition and never studied for insight on the people-­plant relationship. An impor­tant example is the origins of global cannabis prohibition. Campos shows that a War-­on-­Drugs mentality originated within Mexico, well before the rise of harsh anti-­marijuana rhe­toric in the twentieth-­century United States. Political-­advocate histories have ignored the plant drug’s past outside the United States, simplistically portraying global prohibition as a blight spread by U.S. political-­economic dominance and tinged by racist attitudes within the United States.11 Cannabis histories often target Harry Anslinger as the driving force b­ ehind global prohibition. Anslinger was the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, a precursor to the Drug Enforcement Administration (dea). He strictly enforced drug laws through his thirty-­two-­year commissionership (1930–62). His influential public discourse vilified marijuana and its growers, peddlers, and users.12 Anslinger’s classic paper, “Marijuana, Assassin of Youth” (1937), adapted a centuries-­old Orientalist ste­reo­type about drug-­fueled vio­lence to serve his purposes in twentieth-­century Amer­i­ca.13 Despite his real role in cannabis history, Anslinger has been made into a semifictional straw man, easy to topple as a stand-in for the idea of prohibition. The Emperor Wears No Clothes ostensibly paraphrased U.S. prohibitionists in Louisiana in the 1910s as saying marijuana “mak[es] the ‘darkies’ think they [are] as good as ‘white men.’ ”14 ­These unsavory words ­were written in 1985 by a pro-­marijuana activist but now circulate without restraint as a direct quote from Anslinger in outlets that include Rolling Stone magazine (2016), the scholarly book Race and the Black Male Subculture (2016), and the academic periodical Kansas Journal of Law and Public Policy (2017).15 ­These false attributions serve to make cannabis control an outcome of “abhorrent hatred t­oward immigrants and racial minorities” in the United States.16 This is not an accurate portrayal of prohibition. Initial U.S. cannabis-­ control laws w ­ ere about controlling pharmacy practice and preventing use of a drug thought to produce individual and public-­health prob­lems.17 Local anti-­ cannabis laws preceded federal prohibition, but ­these ­were widely preemptive bureaucratic initiatives passed before psychoactive cannabis gained any other local attention.18 Anslinger was initially hesitant to bring marijuana ­under federal control but did so to f­ avor domestic politicians; he always remained more concerned about morphine and heroin. Racial bias in all aspects of U.S. law Cannabis and Africa 7\n\nenforcement was entrenched long before Anslinger, whose ideas about ­human difference surely reflected his time. However, none of his published writings display the racial virulence that pro-­marijuana activists have placed in his mouth. ­Legal controls on cannabis did not originate in the United States. Controls ­were in place globally before the U.S. federal government began worrying about marijuana in the 1930s.19 The roots of global prohibition lay in early twentieth-­ century Africa, not in American bureaucrats. Cannabis first appeared in an international drug-­control agreement, the International Opium Convention signed in Geneva in 1925, ­because South Africa and Egypt asked for it to be included, and the world went along. Both countries had had cannabis controls in place since 1870. De­cades before Anslinger, most African colonies had banned cannabis, often in explic­itly racist terms and principally to control the hard laborers who ­were the plant drug’s principal users (see chapters 8 and 9). The world came into compliance with colonial African ideas about cannabis.20 Cannabis is a global crop. Over the past five centuries, the plant genus has colonized the world, expanding its outdoor range to encompass effectively all ecologically suitable territory between about 60 degrees north and south latitudes. ­Humans have been the primary dispersal vector for the plant. P ­ eople have carried cannabis seeds into many landscapes, including colonists hoping to make rope in new lands, slaves saving seeds to plant somewhere someday, and marijuana growers trying to breed new va­ri­e­ties. The plant’s biological dispersal was inevitably a political-­economic pro­cess, b­ ecause it was a ­human endeavor. It’s challenging to understand the plant’s history b­ ecause of its challenging nomenclature and its dichotomous material values. I discuss cannabis taxonomy in chapter 2. At this point I ­will simply adopt the view that ­there are two major ge­ne­tic groups within the Cannabis genus: indica, which exhibits psychoactive chemistry, and sativa, which does not.21 When italicized, indica and sativa refer to ­these groups, which are not the same as the groups of plants that marijuana aficionados call indica and sativa. Nonitalicized indica and sativa designate folk species—­plant types that are recognized informally within a social group—­and are unreliable indicators of ge­ne­tic relationships between plants.22 The ge­ne­tic lineages have their own histories of biological dispersal. The center of evolutionary origin for Cannabis indica was around the Hindu Kush mountains in highland South Asia, while Cannabis sativa originated in temperate Central Asia. The midlatitude population traveled westward to colonize Eu­rope, where ­people valued it for fiber and hempseed. The psychoactive population colonized southern and eastern Asia and about a third of Africa, the 8 chapter one\n\ntable 1.1.

Global distribution of cannabis, circa 1500. Map by Chris S. Duvall.\n\nCannabis sativa\n\nCannabis indica\n\nnortheastern portion, by 1500. Three major subgroups exist within the psychoactive population. In eastern Asia, t­ hese plants w ­ ere bred for fiber and hempseed production, not psychoactive products, although they retained psychoactive chemistry. In South Asia, p­ eople developed two major subgroups, one associated with the production of charas (cannabis resin), and one associated with ganja (female flowers or, more precisely, pistillate inflorescences). Historical accounts of cannabis come principally from Eu­ro­pean observers, many of whom had strong opinions about how o­ thers interacted with the plant. During the Age of Sail, hemp fiber was crucial to Eu­ro­pean political-­ economic power. Each large ship required dozens of tons of maritime-­quality rope and canvas that needed to be regularly replaced. Political-­economic authorities sought continually to increase plant-­fiber production, but farmers often did not want to grow the crop ­because of its heavy ­labor demands. An early impetus for economic botanical exploration of the world was to find fiber plants that w ­ ere easier to pro­cess into high-­quality rope and cloth.23 Yet despite the prob­lems of producing cannabis fiber, throughout the period before 1925, hemp represented agricultural bounty, industrial success, and maritime strength in Eu­ro­pean media. Psychoactive cannabis drug use was contrarily framed as a waste of a plant resource presumed to be more valuable if made into rope. For Eu­ro­pean documentarians in colonial Africa, perceptions of cannabis drug use ­were entangled in ideas about class and race. Racial ideas coevolved with the historical epidemiology of drug use. The drug-­use practices of p­ eople in social underclasses ­were ste­reo­typed as deleterious to individual and public health. The social-­ecological pro­cesses that produced marginality elevated the 10 chapter one\n\nimportance of subsistence therapeutic resources to ­these ­people, including cannabis. Racial categories commonly served to mark class differences so that the social-­ecological conditions of wealth and poverty ­were considered the natu­ral states of dif­fer­ent racial groups. Notably, the racial category “Black” (and historical synonyms) arose as an intellectual justification for chattel slavery.24 In colonial socie­ties around the Atlantic, the conditions of Blackness, marginality, and psychoactive cannabis drug use became associated and w ­ ere assigned negative meanings in Eu­ro­pean thought. Drug use by White, social-­ecological elites, by contrast, was sanctified as open-­ minded experimentation, free-­thinking expression, or intrepid worldliness. The documents of cannabis history come almost entirely from Western travelers, few of whom claimed direct experience with the plant drug. Th ­ ose who did could boast of cannabis consumption even while condemning it among ­others, ­because their status allowed them to dabble with low-­class drugs without fear of social repercussions. Elite privilege has s­haped the telling of cannabis history, too. Consider the twentieth-­century American writer Paul Bowles, whose writings helped form current popu­lar understanding of cannabis in Morocco. Public repre­sen­ta­tions of Bowles’s drug knowledge exuded worldly coolness, as when he told e­ ager but naive Rolling Stone readers in 1974, “­There’s no good Moroccan hashish. It’s not a product [Moroccans] ever used. The first ones who made it ­were mostly American blacks who brought presses and showed the Moroccans how to do it.”25 His worldliness alone backed up his anecdote: trust the expert, the bad drugs trace to Blacks. Yet Bowles’s knowledge of Moroccan language and culture was superficial, despite his long residence in the country.26 Narratives of cannabis history reflect the partial perspectives of privileged observers; race and class ­shaped both patterns and portrayals of drug use in past socie­ties. It’s crucial to think about race and class in understanding cannabis history. For the world population of Cannabis indica, the main pathway to global dispersal passed from southern Asia across the Indian Ocean to sub-­Saharan Africa and from t­ here across the Atlantic. The po­liti­cal economy of its trans-­ African and transatlantic dispersal was the global expansion of capitalism ­after 1500. Cannabis was integral to exploitative ­labor relationships upon which cap­i­tal­ist endeavors and colonial expansion depended, including plantation economies in the New World connected to slave economies in the Old World. The psychoactive cannabis seeds that crossed the Atlantic accompanied disease, trauma, vio­lence, and poverty. Cannabis histories have overlooked this people-­plant relationship, mostly b­ ecause Pan-­African experiences have been ignored. Cannabis and Africa 11\n\nCommon-­knowledge history provides intellectual bases for decisions made about managing the drug plant in current socie­ties. My pre-1925 focus limits my engagement with current debates. Cannabis decriminalization is a prominent issue in many countries and jurisdictions27—­notably, in the United States, where I reside. Not ­until chapter 10, the last chapter, do I discuss current debates, and even ­there I consider only three topics: how global society manages cannabis as an agricultural resource, as a medicinal resource, and as an object of l­ egal control. I conclude that wider understanding of cannabis history would improve how socie­ties manage it ­today. To start ­toward ­these conclusions, I begin by reviewing portrayals of Africa in cannabis histories. The documentary rec­ord for cannabis in Africa is rich but has been almost completely ignored by historians. This book summarizes what has been overlooked, and with what consequences.\n\nmy background is in the field of African studies. I am interested in historical geographies of Africans in the Atlantic World, by which I mean the many and varied connections that exist across and around the ocean basin.28 I am trained as a geographer, focused on people-­plant interactions. My thinking about Africans and plant geography has been ­shaped by Judith Carney, Andrew Sluyter, Robert Voeks, Londa Schiebinger, and ­others who have shown that Africans ­were fundamentally impor­tant in the transformation of landscapes around the Atlantic ­after 1492 and that long-­standing biases have led scholars to overlook the creative contributions of Africans in historical socie­ties.29 Africans ­were not merely ­labor in Atlantic history, even if slavery sharply constrained how ­people could alter the conditions they experienced. Obviously, Africans ­were not alone. P ­ eople from Eu­rope, Asia, and the Amer­i­cas ­shaped post-­Columbian landscapes, too. Biological and cultural diffusions of cannabis are historically and geo­graph­ i­cally traceable.30 The minimal facts in cannabis histories show that Africa and Africans should not be overlooked. ­Here are the minimal facts: human-­ cannabis interactions originated in Central Asia more than twelve thousand years ago. The plant and knowledge of its uses diffused globally along several pathways. Perhaps one thousand years ago, cannabis arrived in East Africa from South Asia and in North Africa through connections around the Mediterranean Sea. The plant dispersed widely throughout the sub-­Saharan region. Within Africa, three cultural features are widely agreed on. First, many works have suggested that dagga is the African word for cannabis. This is the principal term for the plant drug in South Africa, ultimately from an unknown 12 chapter one\n\nKhoisan language. Many publications have applied the term widely, including a book that states dagga is “spoken widely across the continent, and sometimes applied to any psycho-­active plant material.”31 Other cannabis histories use dagga in situations as diverse as historical South Sudan; among slaves in the southeastern United States; in reference to both Louis Armstrong and “Black Africans”; and as an “Arabic or Khoikhoi” term in Southern Africa.32 Second, all works emphasize “the most in­ter­est­ing anecdote concerning cannabis in Africa[,] . . . ​in which the drug transformed . . . ​a tribe of feuding miscreants to one dedicated to peace and goodwill.”33 This in­ter­est­ing anecdote refers to the Bena Riamba political-­religious movement, which persisted around 1870–90 in what is now the southern Demo­cratic Republic of the Congo (see chapter 6). In its normal telling, marijuana inspired tranquility and goodness in a group of ­people who previously had been prone to warmongering and cannibalism. The third commonly (but quietly) repeated mention of Africa in cannabis histories is that slaves perhaps carried knowledge of the plant drug across the Atlantic to Brazil. Only one work ostensibly covers Cannabis in Africa, the title of a 1980 book by the sociologist Brian du Toit.34 This remains the state-­of-­the-­art historical geography of the plant on the continent, although its geographic aspect was identified explic­itly as a survey in the book’s subtitle. The book instead was a so­cio­log­ic­ al study of drug use in 1970s South Africa. It is valuable in both regards, even though its historical-­geographic limitations are clear. For example, it reports “no evidence of cannabis in West Africa before the Second World War.”35 This statement has been widely repeated. Nonetheless, primary sources show that psychoactive cannabis was pres­ent in nineteenth-­century Gambia, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Senegal, and, possibly, Guinea and Togo.36 Du Toit did his research before the internet. I have benefited from digital repositories made available in the past de­cade, which allow unpre­ce­dented access to an enormous number of searchable historical documents.37 This book is an outcome of investments global society has made that make printed knowledge widely available via the internet. All histories agree that the drug plant’s African dispersal pathway essentially ended at the continent’s shores and had ­little consequence for world culture. All that departs Africa on global dispersal maps is a single, thin line vaguely ­toward Brazil that represents weak statements such as, “[Cannabis was] possibly . . . ​ brought directly by slaves or traders from Africa to the New World.”38 This portrayal of Africa as globally unimportant except (perhaps) for Brazil reflects conventional wisdom, not the documentary rec­ord. Cannabis and Africa 13\n\nCannabis histories are almost uniformly bad when it comes to representing African experiences. ­There is no shortage of outlandish statements that belie ignorance of historical context, if not of documented facts. A book from 2005 announced that it “has been conjectured” that African slaves brought cannabis seeds to Brazil in “magical talismanic dolls.”39 This is a ridicu­lous conjecture, given basic knowledge of transatlantic slaving. Enslaved p­ eople ­were not allowed to retain personhood, let alone dolls, particularly dolls that might have been related to indigenous spirituality. Uninformed embellishments such as magical dolls belittle the experiences of the millions who endured enslavement and obscure the real involvement psychoactive cannabis had in slavery. The idea that a fantastically primitive spirituality underlies the plant drug’s African past resonates with—or, rather, is sustained by—­notions about African backwardness. Cannabis histories offer fantastic rumors of the primitive and exotic—­talismanic dolls!—to supplement thin knowledge. A book from 2012 generalized with no apparent basis that cannabis was “a staple of African shamanism.”40 Another from 2016 says that “the savants of Zululand . . . ​burned cannabis flowers . . . ​and prophesized the ­future,”41 although such prophesizing is not traceable in the book’s cited sources. Poor research practice sustains nonsensical—or, at least, misleading—­anecdotes. A book from 2013 gossiped that “a somewhat obscure sect in the Sudan [was led by] a strange ­woman [who promoted] the smoking of Cannabis (dagga).”42 The basis for this factoid is obscure: the book cites no source but obviously borrowed from a 1980 book that inaccurately summarized and incompletely cited a 1927 paper by a colonial administrator, who started the rumor to suggest that cannabis made the natives hard to rule.43 Cannabis histories have preserved an array of outdated ideas and plagiarized errors by failing to perform the basic research practice of checking and citing sources. Plagiarism in the cannabis lit­er­a­ture has a proud history, ­going back to sixteenth-­century Eu­ro­pean scientific botany and following more than a millennium of embellished, distorted, and inaccurate repetitions of the Greek physicians Dioscorides and Galen.44 More widespread than plagiarism is uncritical repetition. Scholarly reviews of cannabis books have included such praise as “highly incestuous” (1975) and “less . . . ​careful scholarship than a polemic” (2007).45 Common-­knowledge stories supplement thin knowledge about Africa even in high-­end histories. Consider the book Forces of Habit: Drugs and the Making of the Modern World (2001), which remains foundational to studies of drugs in global history. Nearly every­thing that Forces of Habit includes on cannabis and Africa is the quote: “­Angolan slaves . . . ​brought cannabis [to] northeastern Brazil . . . ​sometime ­after 1549. One story has it that the slaves carried the seeds in dolls. . . . ​The planters 14 chapter one\n\nallowed the slaves to grow [cannabis] between the rows of cane, and to smoke and dream during periods of inactivity.”46 The entire passage is an unsourced rumor, presented as common knowledge. Its factoids can be traced alongside the errors they perpetuate. “Dolls” and “1549” come from a 1975 paper that has been widely repeated without citation, despite its critique of incestuous cannabis books.47 The paper cites another paper from 1958 that no one seems to have read since 1975. The 1958 work introduced two errors. First, 1549 was when the Portuguese crown authorized sugarcane plantations in Brazil; the date is meaningless regarding cannabis for reasons related to l­ abor history and ­because ­there is no evidence cannabis was pres­ent in western Africa ­until the 1700s. Second, it stated that Pio Corrêa, an author no one since 1958 has traced, wrote that slaves carried seeds in “dolls.”48 In 1926, the Brazilian botanist Manoel Pio Corrêa reported an oral history that was inaccurately summarized in 1958. Pio Corrêa wrote not about “dolls” but about captives who “tied [seeds] into the edges of their wraps and loincloths.”49 This anecdote is believable; slaves ­were sometimes allowed rags and at least occasionally succeeded in carry­ing valued seeds across the Atlantic.50 The between-­the-­rows-­and-­smoke-­and-­dream factoid comes ultimately from a 1937 book that offers an impressionistic, idealized, and simplistic recollection of northeastern Brazil. It frames psychoactive cannabis as an unfortunate remnant of slavery and thus something to expunge from twentieth-­century Brazil.51 This factoid also betrays ignorance of historical context. A basic knowledge of Brazilian slavery suggests plantation bosses would not have tolerated slaves’ planting anything in direct competition with a principal cash crop, especially not a drug plant that slave o­ wners disdained (see chapter 7). The smoke-­and-­dream nonsense is contrary to documented uses of cannabis among laborers in Brazil and Central Africa, who valued the plant drug as a stimulant associated with work (see chapter 8). Even the best academic works have treated Africa as an episode in cannabis history worth mentioning for its fantastic qualities—­between the rows and smoke and dream!—­but not worth examination. Unsourced, common-­ knowledge statements about cannabis history are mostly traceable rumors, errors, or omissions, w ­ hether about Africa or elsewhere.52\n\nafrica has been neglected in cannabis histories. The broader intellectual prob­lem is the history of scholarship that neglects African contributions to world culture. This prob­lem has markedly affected knowledge of the sub-­Saharan region and the African Atlantic Diaspora. Historically, Africans ­were portrayed as Cannabis and Africa 15\n\nrecipients of knowledge introduced from Eu­rope or Asia rather than as producers of knowledge that ­shaped socie­ties elsewhere. However, recent studies of agriculture, technology, and ethnobotany have shown that African knowledge was foundational to practices of plant use and management within socie­ties across the Amer­i­cas.53 One notion I challenge is that Africa is backward technologically, that useful inventions have gone to Africa but none have come out. I raise this challenge with regard to smoking paraphernalia in chapter 3. The technologies of plant use are crucial components of people-­plant interactions. Smoking pipes w ­ ere unequivocally in­ven­ted in sub-­Saharan Africa centuries before 1492—in some locations, as much as two millennia before Eu­ro­pe­ans encountered American Indian pipes packed with tobacco.54 Dry pipes w ­ ere in­ven­ted on both sides of the Atlantic. W ­ ater pipes originated in Africa, where they w ­ ere historically associated with cannabis. The earliest direct evidence of cannabis smoking anywhere is residue that archaeologists scraped from fourteenth-­century water-­ pipe bowls unearthed in Ethiopia.55 Earlier pipes have been recovered widely across sub-­Saharan Africa, just without evidence of what was smoked. Most cannabis histories make no mention of paraphernalia, despite the dominance of smoking in current people-­cannabis interactions worldwide. Histories that do mention pipes and Africa rely on two outdated narratives: that smoking pipes arrived in the Old World only with Eu­ro­pe­ans coming back from the New World, and that cannabis smoking arrived in Africa only with “Arabs” or “Muslims.”56 The unchallenged dominance of ­these narratives has forced researchers to fit their data to them rather than interpret data to understand the past. The field of archaeology has particularly strug­gled to overcome belief in African backwardness.57 Archaeologists have considered pipes in ancient African sites not as evidence of ancient pipes, but as evidence of erroneous radiocarbon dates, site disturbance, or mysteriously rapid sediment accumulation. Archaeologists have strug­gled to develop regional chronologies ­because some have taken pipes as indubitable indicators of the post-­Columbian period regardless their broader context, while sites without pipes have been dated based on interpretation of the entire context. Some archaeologists have maintained ignorance of readily available, published evidence of ancient smoking in Africa. For example, the few archaeologists who have examined the origin of ­water pipes in southwestern Asia—­Iran and Yemen specifically—­have puzzled over their regional appearance around 1600. Some of this lit­er­a­ture completely omits Africa,58 despite the evidence of ancient smoking on the landmass mere miles across the Red Sea from Yemen. Other works dismiss African pipes as not indigenous but “more 16 chapter one\n\nlikely to have . . . ​spread ­there . . . ​from the ­Middle East,” with no justification offered for the presumption.59 This statement from 1993 echoes a publication from 1930 that interpreted the mere presence of w ­ ater pipes in Madagascar as proof that Portuguese ships had brought the technology t­ here from Persia.60 The 1993 statement neglects the best review of African pipe archaeology, published in 1983, which concludes that ­water pipes came to Persia from Ethiopia.61 Africans are portrayed as passive recipients of cannabis, too, not just of pipes. The ste­reo­type that Arabic-­speaking Muslims brought cannabis drug use into Africa has dominated interpretations of the plant for 150 years. In the 1860s, Eu­ro­pean visitors in Central Africa concluded that cannabis smoking “prob­ably spread from the East—­Egypt and her neighbours” and that “the negroes” ­were unable to resist the drug plant’s “gradual but sure advances” across the continent.62 Cannabis and tobacco came to symbolize colonialist belief in the fundamental character of western Eu­ro­pean versus Islamic culture. In 1886, one traveler concluded that cannabis had “penetrated a considerable distance westward [­because] Islam, carry­ing its special cult from East to West by the instrumentality of fire and sword, accomplished its work far more speedily than the civilisation of Western ­peoples [has] advance[d].”63 In 1932, the thesis was fully developed: [The] distribution [of cannabis smoking] is closely and curiously associated with the distribution of Islam. For some obscure reason—­perhaps the prohibition of alcoholic beverages—it seems to be more attractive to ­Mohammedans than to ­others. Next to Mohammedans, African ­Negroes are the principal hemp smokers. [T]hey learned the habit from the Arabs . . . ​, though ­there may have been an earlier diffusion of it among the [South African] Bushmen.64 This ste­reo­type has been updated—­the terms “Mohammedan” and “Negro” are no longer used. The theme, characters, and narrative remained in 2005: “­Under Arabic influence, cannabis use spread across North Africa and south into sub-­Saharan eastern Africa, although even an approximate date for this expansion outside the Islamic sphere is uncertain.”65 The practice of attributing people-­plant dispersal to some unknown, ancient moment discourages research.66 Historical distancing makes the mythical drug trafficker and the passive smoker into characters whose existence is not worth questioning. The only basis for the Arab/Muslim-­influence narrative is its repeated publication. ­There is no evidence cannabis was used in the Arabian Peninsula at the time of Muhammad, and such use did not appear elsewhere in conjunction with the expansion of Islam in the late first millennium of the common era (ce). ­There are many examples in which psychoactive cannabis has been Cannabis and Africa 17\n\nprominent in non-­Muslim socie­ties, most obviously in South Asia, where secular and religious use traces back at least four thousand years in at least four religious traditions.67 Cannabis drug use has never been prominent in some Muslim areas, conspicuously including the Sahel region immediately south of the Sahara. The earliest hints of psychoactive cannabis in the Levant are about three thousand years old, but ­there is no clear, consistent evidence ­until about nine hundred years ago in Persia and eight hundred years ago in Egypt and Arabia. Smoking pipes existed widely in eastern and southern Africa by that time and held cannabis in fourteenth-­century Ethiopia, where Chris­tian­ity was practiced. ­There ­were few Arabic speakers or Muslims south of the Sahel u­ ntil centuries ­later. The earliest documentation of cannabis from the sub-­Saharan region came in the 1600s from locations far removed from the influence of Islam or Arabs, including southern Mozambique, Madagascar, and South ­Africa.68 East African coastal entrepôts—­most notably, Zanzibar—­hosted ­Arabic-­and Farsi-­speaking merchants beginning in the first millennium ce, but they had essentially no presence on the continent beyond ­these towns. Instead, Swahili traders or­ga­nized caravans to inland areas. Nineteenth-­century Eu­ro­pean travelers referred to “Arab” traders in East Africa and Central Africa and alleged that they spread cannabis smoking. However, the so-­called Arabs ­were Swahili-­speaking Africans who perhaps spoke Arabic, too, b­ ecause it was useful in commerce. They also likely professed Islam, wrote Swahili with the Arabic script, and dressed in styles that Eu­ro­pe­ans considered ste­reo­typically Muslim, with flowing robes and turbans. Th ­ ere is scant evidence that traders used cannabis themselves but abundant evidence that their employees—­the porters who carried commercial goods—­smoked the plant drug. Porters carried cannabis on their travels and acquired it en route, but they w ­ ere definitely not Arab and mostly not Muslim. Commercial porters w ­ ere predominantly younger men, poorly paid, poorly fed, and poorly sheltered for months-­ long hikes, made while carry­ing fifty or more pounds at the rate of twenty miles per day.69 They ­were often forced into ser­vice by po­liti­cal leaders who found benefit in supplying l­abor to traders, colonial bureaucrats, or Eu­ro­pean travelers. (For more on porters, see chapters 5–8.) ­There was no sweeping Arab, or even Muslim, expansion through the continent’s center, particularly one bearing cannabis. Africans at the very bottom of international commerce—­those who carried the po­liti­cal economies of slavery and colonialism directly upon their backs—­helped the plant cross Africa, not some mythical Arab overseer. By 1800, w ­ ater pipes and hashish had become ste­reo­typical motifs in Eu­ro­ pean images of the Orient. ­These motifs diversified and flourished with Orientalist thought. Cannabis smoking was rhetorically impor­tant in establishing an 18 chapter one\n\nfigure 1.3. Émile Bernard’s painting situates hashish in Egypt’s lowest social class. The ­woman’s clothing, jewelry, and gozeḥ-­type ­water pipe are symbols that would have indicated poverty to many Eu­ro­pean viewers and would also have suggested that she was a prostitute. ­These symbolic ele­ments w ­ ere common in contemporaneous postcards from exotic Egypt—­indeed, the painting was reproduced abundantly as a postcard in the early 1900s. Yet Bernard si­mul­ta­neously challenged customary Orientalist imagery. The ­woman is fully clothed and appears lucid, rather than drug-­addled.

In 1873, a travel writer portrayed a fictional British physician in Sierra Leone as someone who “moderately smok[ed] the liamba, or African haschisch” and “possessed an Oriental temperament, and shunned the . . . ​social restrictions of the North [Eu­rope].”71 Eu­rope ­imagined psychoactive cannabis as best typified in the Levant, where many travelers first encountered the plant drug. Cannabis and Africa 19\n\nThe ­People of African Cannabis History The tales of Eu­ro­pean travelers have captivated readers for centuries. Their travelogues are key sources for cannabis history, and it’s impor­tant to understand their perspectives, but this book is mainly about the anonymous ­people foreign travelers observed. Travelers had varying views about drugs. On one extreme ­were ­people like Mary Kingsley (En­glish, 1862–1900) and Henry Morton Stanley (American, 1841–1904) who found African drug use absolutely foul and a cause of the uselessness they perceived in many Africans. David Livingstone, the En­glish missionary (1813–73), was more sympathetic, but he still got “a feeling of disgust” from cannabis smokers.72 Most travelers ­were indifferent. The strange use of the familiar plant was notable but not particularly in­ter­est­ing to many observers, including João dos Santos (Portuguese, circa 1560–1622), Peter Kolbe (Dutch, 1675–1726), and Paul Du Chaillu (French American, 1831–1903). Their uninterested mentions of cannabis are among the best rec­ords of the plant’s past. Some travelers discussed the plant drug more extensively, although extensiveness usually did not produce insightfulness. Alexandre Dumas (French, 1802–70) was less interested in understanding hashish than in using it to produce exotic literary atmospheres; Hermann von Wissmann (German, 1853–1905), was more concerned with political-­economic machinations than ethnography in his accounts of the Bena Riamba movement (see chapter 6). The British voyager Richard F. Burton (1821–90) was a particularly impor­tant source writer. He provided firsthand accounts of cannabis in India; Arabia; North, East, Central, and West Africa; and Brazil. His relationship with the plant drug was fraught. In 1851 he deci­ded that Indian users w ­ ere a “debauched . . . ​set of half savages.”73 Cannabis was a “poison” among slaves in Brazil in 1869.74 But in 1876 he admitted smoking cannabis “for months together” in Central Africa,75 and in 1857 he wrote, “Egypt surpasses all other nations in the variety of compounds into which this fascinating drug enters, and w ­ ill one day prob­ably supply the Western world with ‘Indian hemp,’ when its solid merits are duly appreciated.”76 Despite his global knowledge, he finished by portraying hashish as a “Mohammedan paradise” in his rendition of the Thousand-­ and-­One Nights folk tales (1885–88).77 20 chapter one\n\nfigure 1.4. Like all Eu­ro­pean travelers, Hermann von Wissmann (standing, second from left) depended on Africans as guards and porters during his travels in the southern Congo Basin in the 1880s. Wissmann particularly relied on Chingenge, Sangula, and Mukenge (seated, left to right), who w ­ ere leaders of the Bena Riamba po­liti­cal movement. Bena Riamba adherents used large, calabash-­based w ­ ater pipes, such as Mukenge holds between his legs in this engraving. “Am Kongo,” engraving, in H. von Wissmann, L. Wolf, C. von François, and H. Mueller, Im Innern Afrikas: Die Erforschung des Kassai während der Jahre 1883, 1884, und 1885, 3d ed. (Leipzig: Brockhaus, 1891), facing page 414.\n\nCannabis and Africa 21\n\nMore impor­tant to me are the p­ eople whose names I d­ on’t know—­ the slaves, porters, prostitutes, soldiers, sailors, and laborers whom travelers saw smoking cannabis. Unfortunately, I can learn of ­these ­people only through past writers, who recorded scant information about them. I can name very few of the ­people this book is about, such as Nimo and ­Musulu. Nimo (Congo Basin, lived in the 1920s) was a teenage servant of an American traveler who smoked cannabis while working (see chapter 8). Musulu (Congo Basin, lived in the 1890s) was a young man abandoned into slavery by his fellow travelers ­after he suffered a foot injury (see chapters 6 and 9). Musulu was a subject of the cannabis-­smoking Bena Riamba movement, which Wissmann found useful. He thus recorded much about the movement’s leaders, particularly Mukenge, Chingenge, and Sangula (who w ­ ere active from 1870 to 1890). Again, though, I am more concerned with t­ hose who w ­ ere unnamed, including the p­ eople who emerged from slave ships in Sierra Leone in the 1840s “so deplorably emaciated that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton.”78 Forgotten ­people such as t­hese carried cannabis seeds across Africa and the Atlantic, helping it become one of the world’s most widespread drug plants. Many Eu­ro­pean travelers led fascinating lives, but their stories are not ­those to learn to understand cannabis, despite my repetition of their names in this book.\n\nIslam was wound into Orientalist caricatures as the compelling force ­behind the drug plant’s dispersal. This ste­reo­type ignores a long history of Islamic prohibitions raised by political-­religious authorities, earliest documented in Egypt in the thirteenth ­century ce.79 The ste­reo­type also neglects pro­cesses of historical change. Psychoactive cannabis initially arrived in Eu­rope, for example, not with Muslims or outsiders in general, but with Eu­ro­pean sailors who began using the plant drug in India before 1540.80 Early modern Eu­rope had cultures of smoking herbs other than tobacco—­including hallucinogens and perhaps psychoactive cannabis—­that are scarcely remembered.81 It’s impor­tant to recognize this shadowy Eu­ro­pean past, ­because the small historical population of sailors on Eu­ro­pean ships carried knowledge of smoking and psychoactive cannabis to port cities worldwide, including many in Africa. This shadowy past extended into the early 1900s in the activities of drug runners such as the Frenchman Henri de Monfried, a sailor turned smuggler turned best-­selling author of dozens of semifictional adventures.82 22 chapter one\n\nAccounts of cannabis in Africa ­were impor­tant in forming Eu­ro­pean ideas about the plant drug. Explic­itly fictional and ostensibly nonfictional portrayals of cannabis overlapped to produce a common knowledge of its cultural geography. Ste­reo­types are often inextricable from portrayals of cannabis use.83 Historical Eu­ro­pean observers purposefully blurred real observations with fictional embellishments, b­ ecause their accounts served si­mul­ta­neously to produce an ­imagined geography of their travels and to impart authenticity to their writing. The En­glishman Winwood Reade, who in 1873 created the liamba-­ smoking Eu­ro­pean doctor in Sierra Leone, had earlier created the image of Savage Africa (1864) in a travel account. His fiction was poorly researched, despite his traveler’s credentials. In 1864, he showed scant knowledge of cannabis among the savages: “In Angola, [they have] a kind of narghileh or water-­pipe. The narghileh is generally used to soften the niamba [sic], a kind of haschisch which they smoke. . . . ​So power­ful is this drug that one whiff ­will make ­these inveterate smokers cough.”84 Reade at best watched non-­European smoking practices from afar and betrayed no par­tic­u­lar interest in them. Reade’s word choices w ­ ere dismissive of Angolan cannabis. Ḥashīsh and nargīleḥ ­were ­Levantine Arabic terms for a drug product and a type of ­water pipe, respectively; the product, the pipe, and the terms w ­ ere not used in Angola. Orientalist thought created holes in the historical rec­ord ­because it offered easy rhetorical shortcuts to conceal ignorance of unfamiliar smoking practices. African practices w ­ ere overlooked partly b­ ecause Eu­ro­pean writers framed the Levant as where psychoactive cannabis reached its cultural pinnacle. Cannabis consumption in the eastern Mediterranean region included sweet, hashish-­ based confections with lengthy r­ ecipes, such as majūn (an Arabic word).85 Edible cannabis concoctions that existed south of the Sahara ­were overlooked and uncommon anyway. Historical sub-­Saharan socie­ties ­were satisfied with smoking cannabis. Smoking transforms the plant drug as a pharmacological agent; its effects are felt quickly ­after inhaling, compared with a half-­hour or more ­after eating cannabis-­laced food. It is easy for smokers to control dosage but difficult for hashish eaters. Nonetheless, Eu­ro­pe­ans perceived this preference for smoking as backwardness. “Orientals use refined preparations of cannabis resin,” reported a French traveler in 1889, but Central Africans only smoked “the rustic form” of mixed flowers, leaves, and seeds.86 A paper from 1972 stated, “None of the more elaborate techniques of using Cannabis in the Mediterranean or the Near East accompanied the plant into Africa, and practices in the central part of the continent in the thirteenth c­ entury ­were very s­ imple.”87 (Evidence describing uses of any plant in thirteenth-­century Central Africa would be unpre­ce­ dented; it is unfortunate this evidence was not cited. It is likewise unfortunate Cannabis and Africa 23\n\nthat the 1972 passage was repeated uncritically in 2013.88) The very presence of the plant in African landscapes has been taken as evidence of prehistoric visits from more civilized ­peoples. One traveler determined that ancient Phoenicians must have built the ­Great Zimbabwe ruins, ­because cannabis grew on the site in the 1890s.89 Cannabis smoking in Southern Africa troubled historical Eu­ro­pean observers ­because no Levantine influences w ­ ere obvious in the region. Observers strug­gled to find evidence to fit the narrative. In the 1950s, a German missionary in what is now Namibia concluded that dagga came from the Arabic word dukhān (smoke). Indigenous Khoikhoi p­ eople must have a­ dopted the foreign word, he thought, ­because ­there might be a similar-­sounding Khoikhoi phrase meaning “drunkenness.” His critics considered the Khoikhoi link “rather too tortuous” but accepted the proposed Arabic derivation, for which no historical, linguistic, or other evidence was supplied.90 ­There was no historical presence of Arabic speakers in southwestern Africa, and no languages south of the Sahel have any Arabic loanwords related to cannabis or smoking in general.91 Presumptions of Africa’s backwardness have for de­cades necessitated that scholars seek outside influences to explain cannabis on the continent. Orientalist thought established the Muslim Levant as the only reasonable source of influence, and uncritical repetition has maintained this bias in cannabis histories. Cannabis history must be rethought, especially in relation to Africa. Historians have overlooked considerable evidence while repeating rumors. The assumption that Africa is a cultural backwater must be rejected. The minimum facts of cannabis in Africa—­the plant and smoking pipes existed on the continent centuries before 1492—­necessitates paying attention to African cannabis. This book offers a cannabis history with Africa at the center, not the margins.\n\nthis book has historical and geographic limits. The time period I consider has an indefinite beginning and an approximate end in 1925, the date of the Geneva opium convention. The indefinite beginning encompasses prehistoric evidence for cannabis, stretching back to uncertain hints three thousand years old. The approximate end date reflects two considerations. First, the historical rec­ord on psychoactive cannabis shrank as antidrug sentiments arose; smokers hid their activities from observers. In most locations I touch on, the documentary rec­ord ends sometime before 1925, ­because many jurisdictions had already banned the plant drug. Second, in a few locations t­ here are impor­tant accounts of psychoactive cannabis more recent than 1925, and I cite t­ hese newer studies as sometimes relevant for understanding earlier conditions. I want particularly 24 chapter one\n\nto mention anthropological studies from the 1970s that examined why workers used cannabis and how it affected their per­for­mance, in Colombia, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Cuba, Trinidad, and South Africa.92 The results of ­these studies are broadly generalizable and relevant for understanding past and pres­ent drug use among laborers (see chapter 8). My main historical focus is the nineteenth ­century, partly ­because this was when Eu­ro­pe­ans began to notice and regularly document psychoactive cannabis worldwide. More impor­tant, the ­century was crucial in the plant’s global dispersal, ­because the last and largest flows of captives in transatlantic slavery came from western Central Africa, where slavers supplied mariamba in their feeble efforts to manage slaves’ health. During the last c­ entury of transatlantic shipping (approximately 1760–1860), this Central African captive migration grew to exceed all other geographic segments in the history of the transoceanic trade.93 This group of ­people included about three million who entered the ­Middle Passage; many million more died during forced marches from inland towns to seaports. This migration by far surpassed in size and geographic extent that of all other groups of ­people who carried knowledge of psychoactive cannabis across the Atlantic. This book is about the broader histories and geographies that surrounded the unknowable experiences of ­these enslaved ­people. My geographic focus is the continent of Africa, but my spatial scope is global. In organ­izing my thoughts, I ­will generalize about Africa as a continental region and about several other regions worldwide. My geographic scope and focus vary by chapter, but my broad limits reflect four historical pro­cesses. First, I outline conditions in southern Asia, where psychoactive cannabis originated evolutionarily and had a long history with h ­ umans before it came to Africa. Second, I sketch the global commerce in phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal cannabis indica that endured from about 1840 to 1925. This drug trade linked growers in British India to commercial traders in London, then to pharmacists worldwide. Third, I consider Africa as a w ­ hole, to identify social-­ecological conditions that have existed widely, and to identify limits to generalization about people-­cannabis relationships across the continent. Fi­nally, my narrowest scope is western Central Africa and the diaspora of ­people taken from that region. My work also has limitations due to my research methods. I have relied only on published data; I cite two unpublished, archival sources. ­There are untapped archives of cannabis in African history, but the published lit­er­a­ture has been untapped, too. Scholarly histories have overlooked major episodes in the plant’s history ­because they have overlooked published works that w ­ ere not obscure in their day.

The journal’s phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal content suggests that recent researchers reasonably should have encountered the article when studying the plant drug’s history in medicine, a topic several authors have claimed.95 None, however, have mentioned this documented use of cannabis in chattel slavery. Of course, some of the published primary sources I’ve read ­were obscure, such as trade rec­ords from secondary colonial ports. My review of the published lit­er­a­ture is a necessary step t­ oward locally or regionally focused archival studies. My broad geographic scope matches my reliance on the published rec­ord, which offers mostly sparse information about par­tic­u­lar locations, though about many locations. I offer a spatially and topically broad overview that may help readers identify archives relevant to cannabis research in specific locations. 26 chapter one\n\nFurther, unlike Thembela Kepe, Laurent Laniel, Franco Loja, Julian Bloomer, Ann Laudati, Brian du Toit, Pierre-­Arnaud Chouvy, Kenza Afsahi, and o­ thers, I have not conducted field research on cannabis in Africa. My research trajectory began with historical documents, not field experience. In 2011, I found reference to psychoactive cannabis as “Angolan tobacco,” but found no mention of this plant in recent works on Africans in transatlantic crop dispersal.96 I then consulted the principal world histories of cannabis but became distrustful of what I read. I in­de­pen­dently researched the plant’s world history, which I published in the blandly titled book Cannabis (2015).97 ­After that, I refocused on Africa. This is a broad focus; regional and national histories, including field research, are needed. I have studied overarching themes. Published lit­er­a­ture is heavi­ly filtered through the writer’s view of the world and choice of words, the editor’s purview, and the publisher’s willingness to put something in print. A frustrating aspect of the published, primary rec­ord is that Eu­ro­pean documentarians often just d­ idn’t care much about psychoactive cannabis drug use. I am saddened that Du Chaillu began his comments on liamba in 1850s Gabon with the disclaimer, “Hasheesh and the Cannabis Indica are so well known that it is not necessary to say anything about them ­here.” 98 He went on to describe a slave who was keeping cannabis seeds—­the only known observation of seed saving by a slave in Africa of any plant. I am saddened that the British botanist William Daniell concluded his comments about Angolan cannabis in 1850, “It would be unnecessary h ­ ere to enter into any further details connected with this subject, as it has been fully treated of in the works of several able writers, who have given ample descriptions of this plant.” 99 He had just described how slavers gave liamba to their captives, who ­were loaded with commercial cannabis drug shipments while themselves bound for sale. Th ­ ese ­were among the most detailed accounts of African cannabis; most observers ­were succinctly dismissive. “What is iamba?” asked a Frenchman in 1883 a­ fter having lived four years on the Lower Congo. “I do not know, and, to my ­great regret, I neglected to collect it; but, if it is necessary to believe certain travelers, it ­will be the leaves of hemp or flax.”100 The majority of travelers ­didn’t mention it at all. I take the minority view, as expressed in 1853 regarding North Africa: “The mention of hashish leads me to speak about this plant, on which much has been written for several years now and on which ­there remains much to say.”101 ­There are no historical accounts of cannabis from drug users other than tales from a handful of Eu­ro­pean experimenters, p­ eople such as the writers and artists who formed the Pa­ri­sian Club des Haschichins in the 1840s. Other than ­these men, who sampled hashish ­because they wanted to sample an ­imagined Oriental experience,102 I do not know why historical ­people used psychoactive Cannabis and Africa 27\n\ncannabis. Some Eu­ro­pean observers ostensibly recounted what users said about the plant drug. The attributed statements are informative, though filtered. In one example from 1843, freed slaves from Angola allegedly considered diamba “a sovereign remedy against all complaints,” according to a colonial surgeon.103 To evaluate such claims, I assume that the past pharmacology of cannabis can be estimated from current medical science. Cannabis is chemically complex. All plants in the genus produce chemicals called cannabinoids, of which about 110 are known to occur naturally. I mention just three: ∆9-­tetrahydrocannabinol (thc), the psychoactive one; cannabidiol (cbd), which affects pain sensations, appetite, and immune response; and tetrahydrocannabivarin (thcv), an appetite suppressant. Plant cannabinoids interface with the mammalian endocannabinoid system, made up of nerve receptors and endogenous chemicals, such as the neurotransmitter anandamide. The endocannabinoid system has roles in motor learning, sensing appetite and pain, recalling memories, and modulating mood.104 Plant cannabinoids can chemically mimic endocannabinoids, as thc mimics anandamide. Pres­ent knowledge of cannabis pharmacology is strong, with thousands of articles published annually in the medical sciences and major summaries in books such as The Handbook of Cannabis (2014), Marijuana and ­Madness (2011), and The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids (2017).105 The medical consequences of consuming any drug are categorized as objective effects (physiological responses with biochemical explanations) and subjective effects (the individual experiences of users). I assume that objective effects of cannabis drug use that are known in current medical science existed for past users. Thus, Algerian hunters who smoked before g­ oing out in the 1840s perhaps valued the plant drug for enhancing their night vision, a pharmacologically verified effect among current Moroccan fishermen.106 An impor­tant, objective aspect of cannabis pharmacology is its toxicity, which is very low. Nonetheless, cannabis overdoses are unpleasant, if not debilitating, and can cause fatal cardiovascular events.107 Historical accounts of cannabis smoking that led to unconsciousness and death (see chapters 5 and 6) are medically believable. Further, current medical science robustly links cannabis drug use to increased risk of psychosis, schizo­phre­nia, and other m ­ ental illnesses.108 Not all past reports of m ­ ental health crises—of smokers r­ unning amok or g­ oing mad—­came from ethnocentric, racist, or anti-cannabis biases.109 Unlike objective effects, subjective effects are context-­dependent. ­People have widely varying experiences from taking psychoactive cannabis, partly b­ ecause ge­ne­tic variation among ­people affects cannabinoid uptake and metabolism.110 28 chapter one\n\nFurther, subjective effects depend upon the mind-­set of the user and the social setting of drug use.111 By thinking psychoactive cannabis ­will produce an effect, the user’s expectations help produce that effect, aided by plant biochemistry. Thus, context determined w ­ hether cannabis stimulated boldness and bravery or relaxation and sociability among Zulu men (in South Africa) in the 1890s, one of several examples I mention in chapters 4 and 5. An impor­tant form of subjective experience with cannabis is nowadays called “addiction,” or, more formally, cannabis use disorder. In current socie­ties, approximately 10 ­percent of regular users develop behavioral dependence on psychoactive cannabis.112 Historical users also sometimes developed attractions to the plant drug that are analogous to the current diagnosis of cannabis use disorder. In South Africa in 1913, a physician reported symptoms from smokers that modern physicians have associated with dependence: fixation on the plant drug, irritability when deprived of it, and continued use despite negative health effects.113 Users sometimes had strained relationships with cannabis. An ­extreme example is the Ḥeddawa brotherhood in Morocco, a group of mendicant Islamic monks who considered kif a sacrament and a curse.114 Some Ḥeddawa adherents found their drug use beyond control and a self-­diagnosed cause of ­mental illness.115 ­Those afflicted in this way made a pilgrimage to the tomb of the sect’s founder to seek release from the plant drug. This ambivalence—of psychoactive cannabis being both good and bad to its users—­extends widely in its global history. It is necessary to restrain estimates of the plant drug’s past importance. First, cannabis consumption was not uniform within or between socie­ties, although ­there are almost no quantitative data. Perhaps one in twenty adult male Egyptians used ḥashīsh in 1893, or perhaps one in one hundred adults.116 Perhaps one in thirty or forty adults smoked in the southern Congo Basin in 1913;117 more generally in Central Africa, during the 1850s–1910s, scattered observers had impressions that cannabis was not heavi­ly consumed.118 Rates of consumption at the population level varied between socie­ties. The two estimates I can make are for 1891 for British Guiana (42.8 grams of ganja per capita), just one-­ninth the consumption estimated in 1899 for a town in northern Morocco (360 grams of kif per person—­a gram per day, on average, for e­ very townsperson).119 Rates of consumption varied between individuals, of course. Some who tried cannabis ­didn’t like it and d­ idn’t adopt it, as documented in South Africa in 1913.120 I have found only one quantitative estimate of what a Eu­ro­pean observer considered heavy use. A physician in British Guiana recorded that a patient in a m ­ ental hospital—an indentured Indian laborer—­had been spending 3–4 shillings per Cannabis and Africa 29\n\nweek on ganja in 1893, at a time when indentured workers could be fined a shilling per week for absenteeism.121 In 1895, ganja cost 16 shillings per pound, which suggests that the man was smoking 12–16 grams per day.122 Such heavy use was exceptional. Most historical users received low doses ­ ere w ­ ere no robust tests of psychoactive of thc and other cannabinoids. Th potency ­until thc was identified in 1964,123 and, anyway, ­there w ­ ere no earlier efforts to test plants outside the Western phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal industry. Since 1964, researchers have chemically assayed cannabis worldwide, primarily material seized by police. In the 1970s, plants tested around the tropical Atlantic exhibited low thc concentrations, in the range of 0–10.5 ­percent.124 ­People ­were not smoking flowers with 20–30 ­percent thc, as are now sold in open markets in the United States. Historical accounts similarly suggest weakly psychoactive material. “Our maconha [is] weak in active princi­ples,” reported a Brazilian in 1937, “and often it is smoked without giving any strong sign of intoxication.”125 ­There is l­ittle historical evidence on other cannabinoids, mainly tests for cbd since the 1970s. Historically, p­ eople preferentially smoked inflorescences, where thc is concentrated, but sometimes also burned leaves mixed with flowers. Prices limited individual intake based on income, while shared pipes in group settings limited how much each person could inhale. Some p­ eople, of course, took high doses via intense smoking bouts, and some smoked constantly for years on end. It is unnecessary to characterize instances of drug use as “medicinal” or “recreational” (to employ current language). ­People who consider cannabis simply a good-­time intoxicant receive the same chemicals that cause ­others to consider it therapeutic. Regardless of the contexts of consumption, the plant drug has objective effects for all users, although the strength of an effect can depend on individual health f­ actors. Notably, malnutrition can produce endocannabinoid deficiency, which means that small doses can produce marked therapeutic effects in users with extremely poor diets.126 Good-­time feelings may arise from generalized if unrecognized therapeutic benefits, magnified by euphoriant objective effects and enjoyable social contexts. For ­people facing physical and emotional challenges, cannabinoids can be beneficial even in small doses, and even if the plant drug is not explic­itly considered therapeutic. People-­plant relationships bear health meanings, for h ­ umans and the environment, and are products of entangled social, cultural, and ecological conditions.127 In Trinidad, the anthropologist Ainsley Hamid studied the social-­ecological conditions of psychoactive cannabis farming, distribution, sales, and use, calling this “the ganja complex.”128 I examine many such complexes in varying detail. I provide names for psychoactive cannabis in many languages and regard 30 chapter one\n\nt­hese names as representing unique people-­plant relationships, often similar to ­others but nonetheless historically distinct. Several names are the principal foci: dagga, ḥashīsh, maconha, marihuana, cangonha, kif, takrūri, soruma, ganja, and the cognate word groups bhang/bang/bangue/bangi and diamba/riamba/ liamba/iamba. Each people-­plant relationship combines ­human cultures of practice and knowledge, ge­ne­tic lineages of both ­people and plants, environmental conditions necessary for ­human and plant survival, and the political-­ economic conditions that enable the system’s reproduction. I emphasize context ­because I am influenced by ideas in the scholarly field of po­liti­cal ecol­ogy, in which human-­environment interactions are thought of as si­mul­ta­neously social and natu­ral events.129 Three threads of thought I ­will mention. First, I am convinced of the value of understanding health as a product of political-­economic and environmental pro­cesses.130 Wellness and illness are not simply characteristics of individuals; they are aspects of more-­than-­ human ecosystems. Social structures differentially expose p­ eople to health risks, to knowledge about risks, and to resources for managing illness and injury. Drugs can be risks and resources for individuals, but their use can also be more broadly symptomatic of health vulnerabilities produced by ­human activities and ecological change.131 In terms of public health, I take the perspective of descriptive epidemiology.132 I identify and describe social-­ecological conditions associated with historical cannabis drug use (especially in chapter 8). Although I suggest causal linkages between cannabis use and individual and public health conditions, the historical data are insufficient for an analytical epidemiological study. I argue that the plant drug has been symptomatic of trauma produced on the social and ecological margins of cap­i­tal­ist po­liti­cal economies, but I do not identify par­tic­u­lar pro­cesses that lead to drug use. The second thread I follow is to use po­liti­cal-economic approaches to evaluate human-­environment interactions.133 This I do mostly in chapters 6–9. I argue that cannabis has helped social elites extract value from workers by enhancing the capacity of p­ eople to endure risky environments while caught in exploitative ­labor relationships—­chattel slavery, indentured servitude, coerced l­abor, wage slavery, and so on. Cannabis must be included among the drugs that ­were “­labor enhancers” in colonial Africa, functioning to draw p­ eople into ­labor relationships and to improve their endurance while working.134 At the same time, though, cannabis drug use enhanced the capacity of t­ hese workers to resist their exploitation by aiding purposeful inefficiencies, ­mental escapes, conspiracies against bosses, and so on.135 Understanding psychoactive cannabis as an ele­ment of cap­i­tal­ist political ­economies helps clarify the historical epidemiology of drug use. Historical pre­ce­dent has strongly ­shaped current opinion Cannabis and Africa 31\n\nin medical science, yet past epidemiologies of psychoactive cannabis use have been mostly overlooked—in part b­ ecause medical scientists have completely overlooked Pan-­African experiences with the drug plant (see chapter 10). The final political-­ecological thread I take is to analyze environmental knowledge as expressions of social and cultural power.136 Knowledge of people-­cannabis relationships is rooted deeply in the colonial past, although t­ hese roots mostly have been forgotten. Common ways to think about cannabis nowadays commonly reflect outdated assumptions first made by p­ eople with arrogant faith in the objectiveness, accuracy, and completeness of their worldviews, and with disdain for the worldviews of ­others. Colonial scientists, travelers, and bureaucrats who observed cannabis in faraway lands presumed to know better than the natives how the plant should be used. During the past half-­century, pro-­ marijuana activists and anti-­cannabis prohibitionists have exchanged presumptions about the faultiness of the other side’s knowledge. In interpreting the cannabis lit­er­a­ture, I have been inspired by political-­ecological studies showing that conventional wisdom about environmental prob­lems in Africa—­such as deforestation, desertification, and erosion—­often reflect antiquated presumptions and political-­economic machinations rather than ­actual observations.137 I am ambivalent t­oward all accounts of cannabis, reading each as objective description and subjective portrayal alloyed in varying ratios. Cannabis histories should not be accepted uncritically, b­ ecause the same po­liti­cally motivated errors have been repeated for de­cades, in both high-­end research and low-­end pulp. The greatest error has been to overlook African cannabis.\n\n32 chapter one\n\nt wo\n\nRace and Plant Evolution How does a history begin? For plants, histories begin in the arcane world of botanical taxonomy. All cultures classify plants on the basis of subjective ideas about what makes dif­fer­ent plants dif­fer­ent. Taxonomies specify the plants that are perceived in a culture.1 In Western science, professional taxonomists have classified the world’s plants for centuries, mostly by studying dried specimens in herbaria. Scientific taxonomies provide the conceptual building blocks of natu­ral history. ­There is no thinking about evolution, biodiversity, or ecol­ogy without species to think about. Likewise, only if a plant is perceived to exist can it have a distinct, traceable history.2 When a plant is given a branch in a taxonomic tree, this suggests how it relates to other plants—in terms of use, appearance, habitat, or some other way. Western natu­ral science focuses on biological relatedness, ­because evolutionary theory is a power­ful means of understanding how the biosphere acquired its current form. In technical terms, a “species” is a population of organisms with a shared ancestral lineage.3 Species are often physically, behaviorally, or ecologically distinct, but the key characteristic, again, is that each species is a separate lineage that began at some point, for some reason. Species are crucial to studying the biological past ­because they are si­mul­ta­neously historical objects (­things with histories) and analytical tools (events that provide evidence of historic pro­ cesses). Once a species is placed in a taxonomy, scientists speculate on how it\n\nbecame distinct—­the event biologists call speciation. Numerous pro­cesses can cause speciation. Ecological interactions, such as competition, can cause groups of organisms to become dif­fer­ent within a single landscape, while geological pro­cesses such as continental drift can divide a population geo­graph­i­cally, giving rise to distinct species. When change happens, natu­ral se­lection ­favors the genes that give individuals a survival advantage. With sufficient time, surviving individuals become a self-­reproducing lineage. By identifying a species and a cause of speciation a scientist is stating a hypothesis about how current biodiversity patterns reflect evolutionary history.4 ­Every plant history begins with both a species and a hypothesis of how that species became distinct. Identifying species is not always straightforward. Scientific taxonomy has been a mostly visual activity. Taxonomists have spent numberless hours examining the vis­i­ble forms of plant specimens to distinguish species. Form is generally a good indicator of evolutionary and ecological differences among groups of organisms.5 In many cases, however, groups of similar plants are less obviously distinct. ­These taxonomically difficult organisms have defied scientists by failing to exhibit clearly and consistently distinct physical appearances. Taxonomic proposals for ­these organisms are debated, revised, rejected, and scorned u­ ntil taxonomists reach consensus and formally name the species ­under specialized naming rules. Yet even formal naming does not end the debates about some taxonomically difficult organisms, particularly Cannabis.6 In recent de­cades, taxonomy has experienced transformation. Molecular ge­ne­tics have allowed botanists to perceive previously unrecognized, cryptic species and to hypothesize origins for t­hese genet­ically distinct but physically indistinguishable organisms.7 Biodiversity is hidden in essentially invisible molecules. Physical features still m ­ atter, but hypotheses about species and speciation are increasingly tested with molecular data that indicate biological relatedness. Historians have also provided data for testing ideas about the biological past—­not evolutionary hypotheses per se but instead ideas about how h ­ umans have ­shaped the biosphere. Historical data are most impor­tant for domesticated plants. In par­tic­u­lar, scholars have shown that Africans had impor­tant roles in transforming New World environments a­ fter 1492. Their findings have challenged long-­standing belief that enslaved Africans ­were nothing but passive ­labor in European-­led initiatives.8 The geographer Judith Carney, for example, has shown that slave plantations in the southeastern United States first grew West African rice, Oryza glaberrima, and not the more familiar Asian species Oryza sativa, as had been assumed.9 The slaves’ foundational contribu34 chapter two\n\ntion to the plantation economy is recognizable, in part, by recognizing two species of rice.\n\nscientists have debated Cannabis taxonomy since the 1700s.10 Dozens of species have been proposed and rejected. The defining characters of the putative species have been ostensibly visual: leaf shape, plant height, floral structure, seed size, stem fiber, and so on. However, in most cases t­ hese visual characters have been conceptually secondary to how ­humans use par­tic­u­lar cannabis populations, ­because h ­ uman be­hav­iors have seemed more distinctive 11 than the plants themselves. Most importantly, not all cannabis individuals are psychoactive. The plants farmed in Enlightenment Eu­rope for fiber and oilseeds (and non-­psychoactive drugs) w ­ ere not. The plants grown elsewhere, especially in India, where Eu­ro­pe­ans first began to study mind-­altering cannabis, ­were farmed to produce drugs (and fiber and seed, but t­ hese uses w ­ ere often overlooked). In 1783, the French naturalist Jean-­Baptiste Lamarck was the first to name psychoactive Cannabis indica separately from non-­psychoactive Cannabis sativa. He said the two ­were distinct ­because indica’s leaves occur singly along the stem while sativa’s leaves come in pairs. Other naturalists ­were not convinced the types w ­ ere so distinct. In fact, Lamarck was more focused on what ­people did with the plants. He did not ­really know what the putative indica plants looked like, having seen only “some [dried] morsels brought from ­ ere, in contrast, substanIndia.”12 Lamarck’s comments about Cannabis use w tial. He considered sativa “an extremely in­ter­est­ing plant ­because of its usefulness.” This species was “planted abundantly in Eu­rope, for the ­great utility we have for the filaments from its stem, and for its seed.” In contrast, indica “[is] incapable of furnishing filaments similar to that [of ] the former species. . . . ​ The principal virtue of [indica is] to provide [the brain] a type of drunkenness that makes chagrin forgotten and provides a sort of gaiety.”13 Lamarck’s se­lection of Eu­ro­pean hemp as the archetypical Cannabis remains prominent in botanical lit­er­a­ture. Cannabis has been a contentious taxonomic subject b­ ecause it is highly variable in physical form, and ­people have not found physical characters that reliably correlate with the psychoactive-­versus-­non-­psychoactive distinction. The appearance of individual plants depends on environmental conditions, especially soil fertility. The plant’s capacity for long-­distance pollination and seed dispersal facilitates ge­ne­tic exchange among distant populations. Layered on this inherent variability are the distorting effects of millennia of h ­ uman Race and Plant Evolution 35\n\ns­ e­lection. ­People have harvested cannabis seed, fiber, leaves, and flowers from one end of Eurasia to the other for at least twelve thousand years and have farmed it for eight thousand years in China, four thousand years in South Asia, and two thousand years in Eu­rope.14 For centuries botanists have acknowledged the lack of reliable, vis­i­ble characters to distinguish cannabis types.15 The current, formal taxonomy deals with the morphological challenge by describing cannabis as “a single, highly variable species” distorted through millennia of artificial se­lection.16 Morphological data are poor for identifying cannabis lineages. Chemical and molecular data provide a better foundation for cannabis history. Since the 1970s, botanists have found several consistent combinations of cannabinoids among cannabis types. Taxonomically, the most impor­tant are thc and cbd. Psychoactive plants produce more thc than non-­psychoactive ones. However, the total quantity of thc or cbd a plant produces is less impor­ tant taxonomically than the thc-­to-­c bd ratio. P ­ eople can alter the total quantity of cannabinoids that plants in a par­tic­u­lar lineage produce, but not the ratio (which can be manipulated only by crossing dif­fer­ent lineages).17 Altogether, phytochemical evidence suggests two major cannabis lineages: one that produces mostly thc, another that makes mostly cbd. Molecular data similarly suggest two major lineages that correspond to the chemical types. Researchers have identified several ge­ne­tic traits that consistently differ between the types.18 The botanist Karl Hillig’s analyses of cannabis allozymes are particularly impor­tant ­because they suggest how the two types originated.19 Allozymes are genet­ically determined chemical variants of a single enzyme. Agricultural se­lection does not affect the occurrence of dif­fer­ent allozymes, ­because the chemical variants of an enzyme all perform the same biological function. P ­ eople might select plants with traits linked to one enzyme, but this ­will equally affect all of that enzyme’s variant forms. Hillig’s analyses show that two ge­ne­tic types of cannabis arose in­de­pen­dently of ­human se­lection of plant traits.20 Cannabis biodiversity has been degraded in many landscapes ­because the two types are cross-­fertile (like many pairs of related plant species) and have mixed for millennia in many locations across south-­central Eurasia.21 Nonetheless, distinct, cryptic species underlie outcomes of artificial se­lection.22 For instance, despite millennia of agricultural se­lection for fiber and seed characters, East Asian cannabis cultivars maintain thc-­dominant phytochemistry.23 Cannabis history encompasses at least two narratives, of two distinct plants separately colonizing the world. Pos­si­ble narratives of cannabis history are constrained by the plant’s biogeography. ­There is consensus that the genus originated in Central Asia. The two types have—or, at least, historically had—­broadly distinct distributions char36 chapter two\n\nacterized by latitude.24 The non-­psychoactive Cannabis sativa has dispersed globally between about 35 degrees and 60 degrees latitude, north and south of the equator. This type was the sole cannabis in Eu­rope from prehistory into the 1800s.25 Cannabis indica grows primarily below 35 degrees latitude, with several exceptions.26 Plants grown for fiber and seed in Japan, ­Korea, and northeastern China grow beyond this latitude. Eu­ro­pean and North American hemp farmers began widely planting East Asian seed in the 1840s, thereby germinating per­sis­ tent feral populations that ­people would harvest for drug use in the twentieth c­ entury.27 Drug plants in the Afghanistan-­Pakistan-­Tajikistan borderlands also grow north of 35 degrees. Th ­ ere are two strains of plants from this area, not fully separate lineages but associated historically with dif­fer­ent farming practices. One strain was selected to produce cannabis resin (i.e., hashish), the other to produce cannabis flowers (or ganja).28 The latter strain has colonized the low latitudes starting with lowland South Asia about 3,500 years ago.29 Both strains have been grown with patchy success in warmer mid-­latitude locations, principally since the 1960s. Despite ­these exceptions, the under­lying biogeography is clear: psychoactive plants grow at lower latitudes, non-­psychoactive ones grow nearer the poles. Based on this pattern alone, botanists have recognized the need for two narratives of cannabis history at least since the 1850s.30 Nonetheless, virtually all nontaxonomic publications have a­ dopted a one-­species concept of cannabis, considering e­ very plant to represent sativa.31 Cannabis indica has been a secondary plot. Some taxonomists still champion a one-­species concept,32 while ­others have ­adopted a two-­species idea reflecting ge­ne­tic evidence.33 What­ever taxonomical consensus might emerge, it is necessary to recognize that botany is not apo­liti­cal and that the one-­species idea has long borne po­liti­cal ideologies.34 Taxonomists ­adopted a one-­species concept in the 1970s, for instance, b­ ecause it was useful in drug-­law enforcement.35 A more deeply historical example is that the one-­species idea has coevolved with a plant history that depends on, and seemingly substantiates, racial ste­reo­types of drug use.\n\nthe dominant theory of cannabis speciation is that the types became dif­fer­ent b­ ecause ­people bred one plant population for psychoactive potential and another population to produce fiber and hempseed.36 For example, a textbook from 2013 specifies, “thc content is not of ­great natu­ral adaptive significance [to the plant]. From evolutionary and ethnobotanical points of view, thc is to a large extent a h ­ uman artifact.”37 This hypothesis of anthropogenic (or human-­ caused) speciation recognizes that “nature” had some role in producing diversity Race and Plant Evolution 37\n\nwithin the genus, but a secondary one: “Natu­ral environment and culture work hand-­in-­hand[, but] ­human intervention has been the major force in the evolution of Cannabis.”38 The anthropogenic speciation hypothesis means that historians must examine the h ­ uman past to understand the plant rather than analyze the plant itself. The central historical question becomes identifying the farmers who chose drug over hemp or hemp over drug, a pair of uses that bear power­ful meanings in Western thought.39 And like Lamarck, historians have taken Eu­ro­pean hemp to be the archetypical cannabis. The drug type, it is assumed, was derived from hemp, turning the analytical lens directly t­ oward any ­people who presumably chose drugs. However, no biological pro­cess has been observed through which non-­ psychoactive Cannabis can become psychoactive. ­Humans have bred plants with elevated levels of thc, but this truism provides entry into circular reasoning. Artificial se­lection is taken as the cause of cannabis diversity b­ ecause the conditions necessary for artificial se­lection—­natu­ral variability in, and ­human use of, the plant—­have existed for millennia. The circular logic enables scholars to insert ­humans into cannabis prehistory and cannabis into the h ­ uman past, notwithstanding absences of evidence: “[Cannabis] may have been introduced to [Scandinavia] during Mesolithic times. Cannabis would have been a very useful plant and . . . ​may have been one of the first plants to be consciously managed.”40 The circular reasoning is reinforced through a pro­cess that science studies scholars call coproduction, when two sets of ideas are mutually supportive.41 Cannabis taxonomies include ­human use as the basic character for distinguishing the two types,42 paradoxically making their chemical difference the cause of their chemical difference. The logical prob­lem is apparent in attempts to explain the appearance of psychoactive cannabis in locations where morphological, molecular, and historical evidence is absent or inconclusive. Published historical evidence for the dispersal of Cannabis indica is psychoactive or lacking for many locations around the Atlantic, including Central Amer­i­ca. To explain the eighteenth-­ to nineteenth-­century appearance of psychoactive cannabis in Mexico, a historian concludes that ­Eu­ro­pean cannabis “strains imported for fiber eventually became drug-­producing plants,” even though his consulting botanist found it “unlikely.”43 Even botanists have only unlikely explanations for how one type might be transformed into the other. Again, the chemical/ge­ne­tic types are cross-­fertile, and ­there is environmentally driven variability in physical and chemical traits. But both natu­ral and artificial se­lection act on genes, and ­there is no evidence that a non-­psychoactive population can gain mind-­altering chemistry, except by crossing it with a psychoactive lineage.44 38 chapter two\n\nOther than such hybridization, the only proposed pro­cess through which non-­psychoactive cannabis might become psychoactive is a combination of founder effects (when a small range of ge­ne­tic diversity occurs in an initial population), ge­ne­tic drift (random change in ge­ne­tic diversity), and atavism (the reappearance of primitive characters through chance ge­ne­tic recombination).45 Past founder effects and ge­ne­tic drift are unknowable, but neither would produce a consistent, widespread pattern of non-­psychoactive plants becoming psychoactive. Atavism in relation to cannabinoid production has not been observed.46 Atavism is a fraught idea, having had its widest usage in nineteenth-­century Eu­ro­pean attempts to explain the purportedly primitive and degenerate characters of certain races and of criminals, anarchists, and other social groups. The concept of atavism arose in botany in the mid-1700s and was used to explain any unexpected outcome of plant and animal breeding.47 The concept was obsolete by the 1920s, when botanists could understand change between plant generations through knowledge of ge­ne­tic inheritance.48 Current evidence (from animal biology) suggests that atavism is rare and should be hypothesized only if it is the most parsimonious and plausible explanation for observed phenomena.49 In any case, even if a cannabis population can revert to having the potential to become ­either psychoactive or non-­psychoactive, this transformation becomes evident only if someone decides to try a plant as a drug. Thus, even hypotheses about natu­ral, biological change within plants frame the drug as a product of ­human be­hav­ior. If cannabis psychoactivity is understood as fundamentally a ­human choice, characterizations of p­ eople can substitute for data about, or even consideration of, the biological past. Si­mul­ta­neously and circularly, this condition means that plant psychoactivity can substantiate generalizations about ­people and drug use. Indeed, the dominant historical narrative for cannabis relies on generalizations about p­ eople at least as much as on data about the biological past. Inserting ­Humans in Cannabis Evolution Historical neglect of indica is not just rooted in biological theory. It also reflects outdated ways of thinking about Eu­ro­pe­ans and non-­Europeans. Cannabis histories have generalized about past ­people in terms of race, assigning positive, active roles to Whites, with vari­ous non-­White groups cast as foils. The character contrast is highlighted in two major episodes: the prehistoric origins of cannabis drug use and the introduction of the drug plant to the Amer­i­cas. The normal telling of ­these episodes relies on racial ideologies, which are not perpetuated through the willful intentions of cannabis historians. Instead, racial Race and Plant Evolution 39\n\nideas permeate the plant’s scientific canon and have not been identified and challenged as such. Race is a social construct, not a feature of any ­human being. Cannabis has been part of social constructions of race that follow a general pattern: non-­Whites seemingly prefer drugs over hemp, while Whites choose hemp over drugs, at least in historical contexts. racial history, part 1: the aryans. The earliest racially ste­reo­ typed episode is not directly related to Africa but is the bedrock of cannabis historiography. Cannabis histories normally portray proto-­Europeans as the ­people who first discovered the plant’s multifaceted utility and conveyed this knowledge across ancient Eurasia. Languages from Bangladesh to Britain are undoubtedly related, constituting what linguists now call the Indo-­European language ­family. Nineteenth-­century Eu­ro­pean scholars saw this linguistic pattern as proof of a common origin of civilization across western Eurasia. More perniciously, the language map was read as racial history. The spread of Indo-­ European languages represented proof of the ancient spread of the mythical Aryan race, which supposedly overran western Eurasia beginning 1,500 years before the common era (bce). Of course, colonial-­era Eu­rope could only imagine the supposed found­ers of Western civilization as light-­skinned ­people from temperate climates.50 Colonial scholars further determined that the light-­skinned Aryan prototype had degenerated in locations distant from Eu­rope, diluted by the blood of earlier, darker, less industrious ­peoples. A further prob­lem for South Asia was that the basal branches of the Aryan race had been unequal at the start. The first Aryans in Eu­rope ­were active, combative found­ers of nations, while the southern Aryans w ­ ere passive, meditative lovers of philosophy and religion.51 The two branches w ­ ere doers versus dreamers. Given t­ hese conditions, British (i.e., Eu­ro­pean Aryan) colonial rule was justified, despite the relative advancement of South Asian cultures compared with true non-­Aryans elsewhere in the colonized world. Colonialism represented a new Aryan invasion that doubtless would prove as civilizing as the ancient one. (Aryan racial theory has also bolstered nationalist, fascist, and racist ideologies in Eu­rope, South Asia, and beyond.) Modern scholars have debunked the tale of the ancient Aryan invasion of South Asia.52 Aryan warriors did not sweep across the subcontinent, despite the per­sis­tence of the colonial idea. Cannabis has been placed directly into the Aryan tale. Nineteenth-­century scholars read the common names for cannabis across western Eurasia a"
