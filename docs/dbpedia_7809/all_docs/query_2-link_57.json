        "text": "I confess I understood very little of this, and frankly skimmed the nth transformation of yet another spacetime metric. It's been 30 years since I studied general relativity (GR) and quantum field theory (QFT); string theory hadn't even been born then. Lack of comprehension was caused both by the inevitable decay of my unexercised neurons, and the telegraphic style of the presentation: this is a series of lectures written up as a book, but without much extra explanatory material (in a real lecture you can ask questions; in a book those questions need to be anticipated better). So this is very heavy going unless you are a current researcher in the area. I am not. Despite that, and the poor typography, there are snippets of some very nice physical intuition scattered throughout, which made it worthwhile for me.\n\nFor example, there is a nice description of how different a negative specific heat is (and I just love the use of \"well known\" in the second paragraph, too):\n\nAnd here is a great little fact about Hawking radiation I hadn't previously been aware of:\n\nThe thrust of the book is how GR and QFT just don't work together.\n\nIt's not just that we need some better kind of \"glue\" to patch things up at the boundaries. There's something fundamentally wrong. Black hole thermodynamics begins to point out the problems of reconciling the two. The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its surface area. The Bekenstein bound says that the maximum entropy of any region of space is proportional to its area. This is at odds with what QFT says:\n\nTo get to this point, the authors travel through GR, information theory, and QFT, pointing out various issues. First is the apparently paradoxically different observations made by observers freely falling through a black hole's event horizon (if it's a big enough black hole, they observe ... nothing special really), compared to an observer lurking around outside the horizon, who sees something very different. But this is fine, because they are observing something very different, something slowed down by red shift so much that they can see qualitatively different things:\n\nAlong with this is the \"ultraviolet/infrared connection\", where high enough energy stops being associated with small scales, and starts being associated with large scales:\n\nHaving noted that QFT doesn't work with GR, the authors suggest that string theory might be a solution. It's not guaranteed, but at least it has the right kind of behaviour, the right number of degrees of freedom to be compatible with the Holographic principle:\n\np151. quantum field theory has too many degrees of freedom. ... [string theory] seems to have just the right number of degrees of freedom\n\np165. String theory has many different kinds of black holes ... the statistical mechanics of strings allows us to compute the entropy up to numerical factors of order unity. In every case the results nontrivially agree with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.\n\nThe whole book is rather nicely summarised in the final section, pulling together the four key concepts covered: Black Hole Complementarity, the IR/UV connection, the Holographic Principle, and string theory:\n\nThis is still an open and active research area, and I look forward to reading about further developments (hopefully in a slightly more readable style). And while waiting, I can enjoy little snippets like:\n\np128. by bending some of the directions of space into compact manifolds it becomes possible to generate a cosmological constant for the resulting lower dimensional Kaluza-Klein type theory."
