The reason is that even if some day a unique solution to string theory is found that describes our world, we will never get rid of the large number of string theory solutions that do not describe our world. So whatever happens, if string theory is true we have to explain why the solution that describes our world is picked out of a large collection of solutions that describe very different worlds.\n\nNote that even if the first possibility is true we cannot escape the implications of what Lenny is saying.

He should be looking for other principles that would restrict the solutions to the one that describes our universe. Perhaps that would be another symmetry principle, or perhaps it requires consistency of higher dimensional versions. Or perhaps the tension along a string should be a function and not a constant, etc.\n\nOriginally posted by Mike2\n\n..I think his views only express confusion and frustration...\n\nLeonard Susskind is one of the founding fathers of string and M theories, as I expect you know. Relating to what you suggest about a sense of crisis, here is a quote from Susskind halfway down that page:\n\n\"...the outsider to the subject should understand that string theorists watched with horror, not pleasure, the discovery of the gigantic landscape of solutions. And yet no string theorist that I know is prepared to say that these solutions don't exist. Like Steinhardt they quake in their boots and pray for deliverance. It is not impossible but all agree that it is unlikely...\"\n\nHere you see that Susskind explicitly says that he wants outsiders to the subject (people outside string theory) to understand what he perceives as a crisis in the subject----an unpleasant horror felt by researchers in the string theory community at some prospect. Perhaps he over-dramatizes.\n\nBut what he says is certainly consistent with the confusion and frustration I have seen expressed by other string theorists recently---dire dark quotes from Edward Witten (he's \"afraid Susskind might be right\"), also from David Gross---warnings in a paper by Tom Banks \"Is there a String Theory Landscape?\" Estimates by Mike Douglas of some 10100 distinct vacuums with no clear way to chose the right one.\n\nHere's a link to the Tom Banks paper\n\nhttp://arxiv.org./abs/hep-th/0309170\n\nHe is one of the main people responsible for M theory, I believe.\n\nAnother of the senior string figures.\n\nHere's a link to a Mike Douglas paper describing the dilemma Susskind was talking about\n\n\"Statistics of string/M theory vacua\"\n\nhttp://arxiv.org./abs/hep-th/0303194\n\nSo, although it sounds to me as if Susskind is exagerating the current troubles in string theory, what he says is born out to some extent by recent articles and by worries expressed by other important string people.\n\nI don't concern myself much with such matters, as I'm more interested by Loop Gravity. But it seems to me that Susskind is talking about something real going on in string theory, that one should at least know about. Glad you took enough interest to read the page!\n\nOriginally posted by Mike2\n\nIs it possible that the number of solutions to String/M theory may be reduced by principles that govern how the universe got started? Are there an great number of possible initial conditions to String/M theory? Or is there only one way the universe could have gotten started which results in the solutions at present?\n\nthat strikes me as a really good question---tho I cannot really judge and certainly cannot answer! Since string/M is not a special interest of mine I will just fetch a quote from Tom Banks\n\nI believe it is a good idea to get an idea of the standing and reputation of people. He is one of a small group (with Polchinski, David Gross, Susskind) who give the plenary invited talks at main conferences, I gather, and maybe the person most responsible for M theory, and I guess he leads the group at Rutgers? or is it Brown?\n\nSo his PhD students get the best postdoc gigs etc. AFAIK\n\nHe also strikes me as kind of open and honest. BTW is a picture:\n\nhttp://www.physics.rutgers.edu/people/images/BanksT.jpg\n\nOne can't tell anything from a picture I guess but it gives\n\nsomething to hang random impressions on and imagine the person with.\n\nBut everybody has to form their own impression of what sources are reliable----so if you have not already go to the arxiv search page and have it list all the papers of T Banks. See who he has colaborated with and what he has written about.\n\nI will get a quote from section 4. of Banks' \"Is there a String Theory Landscape?\" that seems to have some relevance to your question. You can check out the rest on line.\n\nAlso good to look by at that paper Mike Douglas, another leading scholar. It will take a moment to get the Banks quote.\n\nBanks section 4 \"Scientific Explanation\"\n\nBanks page 17, section 4 called \"Scientific Explanation in the Discretuum\"\n\nThe discretuum is the presumed 10100 or so discrete separate solutions from which it is difficult to choose by means of empirical observation. Here is an exerpt:\n\n---------quote from Banks paper--------------\n\n4 Scientific Explanation in the Discretuum\n\nThere are two possible modes of scientific explanation in the discretuum. The first is to simply to ask whether there are states in the discretuum with properties identical to those of the Standard Model and observational cosmology, and to ask whether the physics of the ensemble of such states is sufficiently similar that one can make further predictions[9], for as yet unmeasured quantities*.\n\nAt the crudest level, the problem is one of counting. In order to explain the cosmological constant alone, one needs of order 10^63 − 10^120 states (depending on one’s assumptions about supersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking). Additional requirements, such as a suitable hierarchy, the correct values of the quark and lepton masses and mixings, the correct amount of inflation, and so on, are likely to increase this by an enormous factor, quite possibly just as large or larger.\n\nRefererence [7] provided some estimates of the number of flux vacua, and [9] examined some prototype counting problems, which suggest that there could conceivably be enough flux vacua.\n\nThe problem of actually determining the correct ground state is hopeless, from this viewpoint. It is not clear that there is any sort of small expansion parameter in the flux vacua. If there is, it is unlikely to be smaller than a part in 100. This means that, if one works say to tenth order in this parameter (far more precise than any precision QED calculation) one would calculate the cosmological constant, at best, to an accuracy more than 40 orders of magnitude less fine than the observed value of the dark energy. In other words, at this stage of the computation, there must be at least of order 10^40 states with properties otherwise identical to those of the Standard Model; determining which of these described nature would require an impossibly difficult calculation.\n\n*Footnote: Another problem here is the inevitable imprecision of quantities associated with a particular state in the discretuum, due to its finite width. For example, all energy levels should be broadened. Is this consistent with an enormously precise tuning of the value of the c.c. associated with this state?\n\n--------------end of Banks quote--------------------\n\nBanks reference [9] is to a couple of papers by Mike Douglas, one of which I believe I already gave a link for\n\n[9] M. R. Douglas, JHEP 0305, 046 (2003) [arXiv:hep-th/0303194]\n\nS. Ashok and M. R. Douglas, arXiv:hep-th/0307049.\n\nOriginally posted by selfAdjoint\n\nYes this is the Anthropic principle argument. We pick out the solution(s) that lead to us. A few string physicists support it, but most, I think are just as horrified of that as of the googles of vacua.\n\nVery interesting situation. We live in fascinating times.\n\nActually, I was asking if it were possible that the unique solution of our present observable universe may be determined or selected by initial conditions of the universe. So I guess I'm asking if String/M theory has been able to explain what happened at the very first instant of time? I've not heard of it portrayed as such. But it occurs to me that the present is a result of the past, and so the initial condition is what determines the present state.\n\nFor example, can the initial string or p-brane emerge instantaneously, or must it evolve continuously from a point?\n\nOriginally posted by selfAdjoint\n\nI don't think there is any direct calculable conection from string physics to the \"first moment of the universe\".\n\nSo string/M theory does not describe how the universe came to be? Are you saying string/M theory is only valid from some time after the beginning?\n\nOf course initial conditions don't have to be taken then, they can apply to any spacelike surface you find convenience.\n\nSo how far back can we go before we run into the problem of multiple vacua? Does the problem appear with some sort of symmetry breaking for which string theory has predictive power to a time earlier than that? As I recall, a symmetry can break spontaneously in some arbitrary direction. Is it this arbitrariness of symmetry breaking that gives rise to the many possible solutions? Or asked in reverse, does the many possible solutions point to the existence of some symmetry heretofore not considered?"
