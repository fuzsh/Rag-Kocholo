        "text": "This essay is about to describe historically the evolution and trajectories of String Theory and its respective derivatives, such as M-Theory and the well known Super-String Theory. I begin talking about the scientific and historical frame in which string theory was born, and the context existent few years since this happens. Besides, the subject has been analyzed from a philosophical point of view, and I also analyzed the context of the scientific community in a sooner epoch since string theory was born. Moreover I described how string theory changed to give to physics a stronger string theory and some other close theories based upon the first one. Finally i point out the interesting phenomena of this theory that is about how famous string theory has become and the question: who actually invented it and who truly released it as a divulgation subject.\n\nThe golden ring to which most physicists aspire is a unified field theory that incorporates all of modern and classical physics. Some scientists and others call this a TOE or ‘theory of everything’, but it is no more than false hubris to believe that humans could possibly know and explain everything about the universe at this time. Einstein chased this goal for the last three decades of his life, basing his theoretical research on his general theory of relativity. Meanwhile, the vast majority of scientists supporting the other major accomplishment of the Second Scientific Revolution were investing all of their time and efforts to advancing the quantum theory and their quest has been extremely successful. They originally had no interest in a unified field theory. After Einstein died in 1955, his efforts were all but abandoned because of his philosophical stance against the prevalent Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum theory even though he had been one of quantum theory’s founders. During the 1970s the tables started to turn and quantum theorists became interested in unifying physics, although not from the foundational principles of relativity theory. They claimed that quantum theory was more fundamental than relativity so they began the same quest from a totally different direction despite their claims to be continuing Einstein’s quest. Throughout the development of the ensuing standard quantum model, superstring theory and many other theoretical schemes, quantum theorists have remained resolute in their conviction that the quantum and relativity are mutually incompatible so the quantum must completely do away with and replace relativity once and for all. However, the quantum theory and relativity are not actually incompatible and, in fact, say the some of the same things about the nature of physical reality. When the similarities are fully defined and studied and the basic assumptions behind each of the theories are altered to reflect the similarities instead of the incompatibilities, only then can the point of their compatibility be determined and act as a unifying principle resulting in a completed unified field theory of the type that Einstein once sought. The development of this physical model of reality is not without irony. Not only is the quantum theory incomplete as Einstein argued in EPR, but Einstein’s general relativity is also seriously incomplete and true unification cannot be rendered complete at any level of reality until all the theoretical models being unified are themselves complete.\n\nGeneral relativity is a beautiful, complete theory of gravity. It agrees well with observations. For example it predicts the correct precession of the orbit of Mercury, and its prediction of a 'big bang' is verified by the observation of the cosmic microwave background. We will now seek to extend this theory, adding new features to reach string theory. But these additional features have not been observed as yet; in fact they may not be observable for several decades to come. So a natural question to ask is: why should we consider string theory? General relativity as formulated by Einstein is a classical theory; it does not incorporate the ideas of quantum mechanics. Electrodynamics as formulated by Maxwell was also a classical theory, but some effort yielded a natural quantum extension, called quantum electrodynamics. Other fundamental interactions – the weak and the strong force – were also naturally obtained as fully quantum theories, with a structure entirely analogous to quantum electrodynamics. But with gravity the situation turned out to be very different, and attempts to extend gravity to a quantum theory met with repeated failure. We will see below that this failure is due to the fact that gravity is essentially different in nature from other interactions; it is mediated by a particle – the graviton – which has spin 2 rather than spin 1. Particles of spin 2 lead to a strong divergence in quantum 'loop diagrams'; a divergence that cannot be renormalized away as is done in theories where the interaction is mediated by spin 1 particles. After some years of effort is was realized that this divergence is a robust feature of the spin 2 interaction, and fundamentally new ideas would be needed to eliminate it and get a sensible theory. String theory is a natural and beautiful extension of general relativity, where the troublesome divergence gets automatically removed. We will see that the classical gravity theory exhibits certain discrete symmetries, called T and S duality. If we require that these symmetries persist in the full quantum theory, then we are led to a unique theory – string theory. The string of string theory has a natural symmetry of its own, called modular invariance, and it is this symmetry that leads to a removal of the pesky divergence."
