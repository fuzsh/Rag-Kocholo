I must admit that at times I used to get lost but couldn't stop listening.\n\nI loved thae narration, very engaging.\n\nAll in all a job well done.\n\nSyed Razmi\n\nTurn Pager with forward thinking with incredible relevance!\n\nLeonard's life's passion, friendships and solid values allows the reader to take one of the greatest rides and fly close to the sun with so many of the great physicist of our time. I have read close to 100 books on this and or related topics and Leonard's sensibilities and abilities to articulate very complex concepts in an entertaining and informative!\n\nNot the best book for an “audiobook”\n\nI like Leonard Susskind, but I never realized how important those diagrams are until I read the physical copy of this book. That being said: I love how he does not “dumb down” the material present in the book. however, there is a lot of him “hamming it up” and the book could have been compressed to about 8hrs\n\nAwesome\n\nAwesome as expected... a bit vain, but fantastic writing, narration, and story.. sometimes mind bending, but worth the trip. highly recommend and looking for more...\n\ngreat book Very educational\n\nloved it, the physics was written in a way that was very easy to understand"
