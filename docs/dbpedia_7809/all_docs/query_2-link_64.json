        "text": "Full Text of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity Lecture 1 by Leonard Susskind at Stanford University. Recorded September 22, 2008.\n\nListen to the MP3 Audio here: MP3 – Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity – Lecture 1\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nGravity. Gravity is a rather special force. It’s unusual. It has different thin electrical forces, magnetic forces, and it’s connected in some way with geometric properties of space — space and time. And that connection is, of course, the general theory of relativity.\n\nBefore we start, tonight for the most part we will not be dealing with the general theory of relativity. We will be dealing with gravity in its oldest and simplest mathematical form. Well, perhaps not the oldest and simplest but Newtonian gravity. And going a little beyond what Newton, certainly nothing that Newton would not have recognized or couldn’t have grasped — Newton could grasp anything– but some ways of thinking about it which would not be found in Newton’s actual work. But still Newtonian gravity. Newtonian gravity is set up in a way that is useful for going on to the general theory.\n\nOkay. Let’s begin with Newton’s equations. The first equation, of course, is F equals MA.\n\nF = ma\n\nForce is equal to mass times acceleration. Let’s assume that we have a frame of reference, that means a set of coordinates and a collection of clocks, and that frame of reference is what is called an inertial frame of reference. An inertial frame of reference simply means one which if there are no objects around to exert forces on a particular – let’s call it a test object. A test object is just some object, a small particle or anything else, that we use to test out the various fields — force fields, that might be acting on it. An inertial frame is one which, when there are no objects around to exert forces, that object will move with uniform motion with no acceleration. That’s the idea of an inertial frame of reference."
