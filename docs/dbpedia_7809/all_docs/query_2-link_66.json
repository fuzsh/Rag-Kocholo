        "text": "Astrophysics\n\nProfessor Leonard Susskind has explored what may happen inside a black hole in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. He argues that the interior of a black hole grows for a long time after it has reached thermal equilibrium. As discussed in Article 21 - Is there a rational explanation for Dark Energy? -, Susskind suggests this dark energy is the equivalent of increasing computational complexity (CC). Susskind derived two equations/components. The CC component is concerned with positional aspects of entropy, the other component which is called Kolmogorov complexity (KC) deals with kinetic aspects of entropy in a thermodynamic system. In brief, Susskind explains events inside a black hole in terms of phenomena experienced outside a black hole. The current article argues that the KC component explains Newton’s inverse square law for gravity.\n\nOptimal quantum computation is linked to gravity. Information and gravity may seem like completely different things, but one thing they have in common is that they can both be described in the framework of geometry.\n\nKolmogorov Complexity\n\nSusskind examines what happens to the complexity of a black hole when one qubit (a quantum bit of information) is added to the black hole. When two identical thermodynamic systems are combined, the entropy is additive…"
