        "meta_description": "(March 14, 2011) Leonard Susskind gives a lecture on string theory and particle physics that focuses on the mechanisms that make the universe hot. In the last of course of this series, Leonard Susskind continues his exploration of string theory that attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity. In particular, the course focuses on string theory with regard to important issues in contemporary physics.",
