Now string theory, one of today’s leading candidates, is in trouble. A growing number of physicists claim it is ill-defined and based on crude assumptions. Something fundamental is missing, they say. The main complaint is that rather than describing one universe, the theory describes 10500, each with different constants of nature, even different laws of physics.\n\nBut the inventor of string theory, physicist Leonard Susskind, sees this…"
