        "text": "This is my first question on this site so please improve the question if needed. I am a beginner in Quantum Mechanics and so to study about it, I purchased the book \"The Theoretical Minimum : Quantum Mechanics by Leonard Susskind\" as an introduction to Quantum Mechanics. I am currently on lecture-2 which is about Quantum States and the author is talking about \"spin states\" of a system. I have completed \"spin along z-axis\" and \"spin along x-axis\" but I am having a doubt in \"spin along y-axis\". In the spin along y-axis section, the author uses \"in\" and \"out\" states labelled as $|i\\rangle$ (in) and $|o\\rangle$ (out). Then the author mentions that they are orthogonal states i.e. $\\langle i|o\\rangle = 0$ and vice-versa which mean that if the spin is in then it has $0$ probability to be out which I am clear with. Then the author uses statistical results of our experiments and writes : $$\\begin{align*} \\langle o|u\\rangle \\langle u|o\\rangle &= \\frac12 \\tag{1}\\\\ \\langle o|d\\rangle \\langle d|o \\rangle &= \\frac12 \\tag{2}\\\\ \\langle i|u\\rangle \\langle u|i \\rangle &= \\frac12 \\tag{3}\\\\ \\langle i|d \\rangle \\langle d|i \\rangle &= \\frac12 \\tag{4}\\\\ \\end{align*}$$ where $u$ and $d$ are the up and down states\n\nI am having a problem in understanding how the product of these \"inner-products\" equal $\\frac12$\n\nMy attempt : I know that $$\\begin{align*} \\langle A|u\\rangle \\langle u|A\\rangle &= P_u \\\\ \\langle A|d \\rangle \\langle d|A \\rangle &= P_d \\end{align*}$$ where $P_u$ and $P_d$ are the probabilities for measurements of up and down states and $|A\\rangle$ is a generic state. So in the same way, $\\langle o|u\\rangle \\langle u|o\\rangle$ is the probability that the spin is up given that out is our generic state and here $|o\\rangle$ plays the role of $|A\\rangle$. The probability is $\\frac12$ because we can choose between two states namely up and down and hence the probability is $\\frac12$ and the same holds for the other $3$. Is my logic correct or is there something missing? Any help/hint is appreciated\n\nThanks in advance :)"
