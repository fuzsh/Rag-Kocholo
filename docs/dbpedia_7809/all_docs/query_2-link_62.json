No one's been able to se anything, to observe anything that tells us the direction to go in towards a theory of quantum gravity. So the ball's very much in the theorists court, the theoretical physicists who can calculate and build models and explore many different roads to see where they lead. And one of the most successful and popular over the last 10 or 20 years has been a theory called string theory.\n\nÂ\n\nLEONARD SUSSKIND: First of all the string theory is an attempt at quantum theory of gravity. The way that it works is, now I don't expect the laymen to really appreciate why this is uh, the right way to think about it. But let me try to explain as best I can, in string theory all particles, and particles means all matter, everything's made of particles, are made out of little loops of string. Little loops of string may be that look about well, forget these fingers here, lets try to focus on the uh, they're made up of little loops of string, now in order for them to exert forces on each other, they have to be able to juggle back and forth, these gravitons. What is a graviton, a graviton is another little loop of string, so the way it works, the way that a juggler flips a graviton into the air it's something like this. You start with a string and that string breaks, like that. Just breaks in half by splitting, and when it splits it has effectively juggled the second string. And then this one might split and juggle, well your strings may be doing the same thing at the same time. And every once in while one of your split strings get mixed up with mine and we exchange it back and forth. And that's the origin of gravity in string theory.\n\nÂ\n\nBRIAN: So how big are these strings, how could I picture one?\n\nÂ\n\nLEONARD SUSSKIND: Well in the beginning when string theory was first invented, when there was supposed to be protons and neutrons, a proton and neutron today, by today's standards, is a great big puffy marshmallow. Big, fat er, object. The strings that we're talking about now, which are replicas or shall I say analogues of the same strings, are a billion, billion times smaller. A billion, billion times smaller than a proton.\n\nÂ\n\nBRIAN: A billion, billion?\n\nÂ\n\nLEONARD SUSSKIND: A billion, billion, ten to the eighteenth times smaller. So far smaller than we can see with any kind of microscope that exists. And that includes the world's biggest accelerators. Uh, far far smaller than anything we can see, and very likely far, far smaller than anything we ever will see.\n\nÂ\n\nBRIAN: But it sounds like a, a very strange thing. Why would you imagine that the universe is built in that way?\n\nÂ\n\nLEONARD SUSSKIND: Perhaps it may not be, but here's what we discovered. Sometime around nineteen sixty nine, for entirely different reasons, for reasons having to do more with nuclear physics that quantum gravity, people, myself included, began to explore what particles would be like if they were made out of little strings. And the reason was because we had experimental knowledge that protons, neutrons, the ordinary particles, had a string like character to them, you could stretch them, you could spin them around as if they were bolos the Argentinean bolos that they cowboy uh, throws. It was experimental at that time, and so people began to explore the possibility that particles are made up out of strings. What they discovered, somewhat to their own horror, I must say, was that these particles behaved as though they had gravitational forces between them, for exactly the reasons that I said. Split off little pieces exchange them and the forces that are created are exactly like gravity. So accidentally they discovered that in their best theory of protons and neutrons, it began behaving as if there was a gravitational force between the particles. And we have no choice really, we've had to track that down and follow it and find out what it means. Find out why uh, strings seem to lead to gravity, and we more or less understood that. But at the moment it is the only mathematical framework in which gravity and quantum mechanics co-exist. And so we have no choice but to follow it down and track it down and see what it says.\n\nVideo transcript\n\nLEONARD SUSSKIND: Okay, let me tell you the most interesting thing about string theory is probably not that matter is made up of these little strings. The most interesting thing is that string theory requires extra dimensions of space. It requires these extras dimensions to be curled up into little dimensions that we can't see, too small to see. But the way that they curled up, and it's not just that they're curled up, but they can be curled up with strings wrapping around the curl, the curl dimensions. Other quantities known as fluxes, there's a zillion, zillion, zillion ways of curling up these extra dimensions.\n\nÂ\n\nBRIAN: And those things are here and here, and there and everywhere right?\n\nÂ\n\nLEONARD SUSSKIND: Right, right and because the properties of space over here are the same as the properties of space over here are the same as the properties of space over here. It means they're curled up the same over here, as over here, as over here. And as far as we can tell there's just a zillion, zillion, zillion different ways for them to curl them up, right. Now I think of these different ways of curling up these microscopic dimensions of space as a kind of DNA, as a kind of DNA of the universe. You could change the way they're curled up, just like you could change a DNA molecule, you could pull one of the base pairs out and put something else in. Or you can do exactly the same.\n\nÂ\n\nBRIAN: You'd have a different animal, eventually?\n\nÂ\n\nLEONARD SUSSKIND: You'd have a different creature. You'd have a creature with a different set of properties, three arms instead of two arms, uh, a foot growing out of their head if you didn't do it right. But in the same way if you change the way these tiny tiny dimensions are curled up and there are millions of ways of doing it the structure of the universe would change. What does that mean? Well it means for example that the forces of the universe will change gravity may become much stronger or much weaker, electricity may disappear altogether, it may be a world with no electrons in it. So by changing the DNA that's implicit in string theory the properties of space at the tiniest tiniest distances you are doing in a sense the same thing as when you change the DNA of a creature. You're changing its morphology, in the same way you would be changing the properties of the universe. So string theory among other things, is a theory of the DNA of the universe. That's the way I like to think about it.\n\nÂ\n\nBRIAN: But how then are we to understand that this universe is built the way it is. It's built so we can exist, so this vineyard can exist.\n\nÂ\n\nLEONARD SUSSKIND: Why is the DNA like it is? Well I could ask you the same question about yourself. Why is it that your DNA is so, why are you so lucky that you inherited DNA which allowed you to think and ask the question 'why is my DNA the way it is?'? Well the answer is, that first of all there's an enormous number of ways to arrange the DNA, some very very small fraction of them might lead to a creature that's smart enough to ask the question. Most creatures aren't smart enough to ask the question, some of them will be, and you just happen to be one that is. that's all, you just happen to be one.\n\nÂ\n\nBRIAN: So it's just luck?\n\nÂ\n\nUh, I would say the same about the universe, probably most versions of this DNA create universes which don't support life. They expand too quickly or they re-collapse in an instant, or they don't have chemistry, or they don't have photons, you need photons to heat you from the sun. Most of them have the wrong properties, just like most DNA will give rise to creatures that don't have the right properties to ask questions. Most of the DNA in the universe will lead to regions of space which are not the kind which can support creatures which can ask about it. Some tiny, tiny fraction of the way of putting universes together, will support life, will support intelligent life and it shouldn't be any surprise that that's where we are.\n\nÂ\n\nLEONARD SUSSKIND: And uh, physics and cosmology are leaning, I won't say that, I won't say that that's the absolute conclusion of that's the way it is. But it's leaning in that direction, towards huge diversity many, many possibilities of which we are only one."
