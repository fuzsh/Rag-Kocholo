To guide us, we derive a correspondence between the computational (circuit) complexity of a quantum system of $K$ qubits, and the positional entropy of a related classical system with ${2}^{K}$ degrees of freedom. We also argue that the kinetic entropy of the classical system is equivalent to the Kolmogorov complexity of the quantum Hamiltonian. We observe that the expected pattern of growth of the complexity of the quantum system parallels the growth of entropy of the classical system. We argue that the property of having less-than-maximal complexity (uncomplexity) is a resource that can be expended to perform directed quantum computation. Although this paper is not primarily about black holes, we find a surprising interpretation of the uncomplexity resource as the accessible volume of spacetime behind a black hole horizon.",
