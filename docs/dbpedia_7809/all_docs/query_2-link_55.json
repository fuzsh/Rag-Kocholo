        "text": "Susskind lures us in with a jokey, folksy style. He begins chapters with dialogues between Lenny and Art, goofy stand-ins for Susskind and his co-author Art Friedman, an engineer and former student of Susskind. Lenny and Art are “greenhorns from California” who wander into a “watering hole called Hilbert’s Place.” Hilbert’s Place is a reference to Hilbert space, an imaginary mathematical realm where quantum events unfold. The authors warn early on:\n\nDon’t let our lighthearted humor fool you into thinking that we’re writing for airheads. We’re not. Our goal is to make a difficult subject “as simple as possible but no simpler,” and we hope to have a little fun along the way. See you at Hilbert’s Place.\n\nThat “no simpler” quote is Einstein’s. Quantum mechanics, Susskind says, is our most fundamental description of the world. It is “much more fundamental than classical mechanics,” which is a mere “approximation.” Quantum mechanics “is technically much easier than classical mechanics” in terms of its mathematics, but it is conceptually strange. It upends our assumptions about logic and causes and effects. Most textbooks on quantum mechanics don’t dwell on its strangeness, Susskind says, but his goal is to bring “the utter strangeness of quantum logic… into the light of day.”\n\nSusskind’s first lecture, “Systems and Experiments,” starts simply enough. He talks about physical systems with two possible states, like a coin. When we flip a coin, it lands either heads-up or tails-up. You can represent these two states as +1 or -1. In computer science, a two-state system is known as a bit, which you can think of as the answer to a yes-or-no question.\n\nParticles such as electrons have a two-state, binary property called spin, which is unlike the spin with which we are familiar. In our macro-world, objects spin in a certain direction--clockwise or counterclockwise, for example, depending on frame of reference--with a certain velocity around an axis with a certain orientation in space. The Earth spins on an axis that points at Polaris, the North Star. It spins counterclockwise if you’re looking at it from above the North Pole and clockwise from above the South Pole.\n\nNow that I’ve brought up this analogy, you should forget it, because quantum spin is an abstract, mathematical property with no macro-world counterpart. You shouldn’t think of the electron as a tiny, charged ball spinning with this velocity around an axis with this orientation in space. “The spin of an electron is about as quantum mechanical as a system can be,” Susskind says, “and any attempt to visualize it classically will badly miss the point.”\n\nI’ve read about quantum spin before, and I’ve always been baffled by it. Feynman brings up spin only toward the end of QED. He relates spin to polarization, an orientation of photons in space and time, but I don’t grasp Feynman’s explanation. I’m determined to get Susskind’s take on spin, especially since it is a quintessential quantum property.\n\nThe spin of an electron, Susskind says, has two possible values, which you can designate as up and down, or +1 and -1. Let’s say you measure the spin of an electron with a detector, and the spin turns out to be +1. You measure it again and get the same result: +1. Now you flip the detector upside down and measure the electron, and the spin turns out to be -1. “From these results,” Susskind says, “we might conclude that [spin] is a degree of freedom associated with a sense of direction in space.”\n\nBut now you rotate the detector 90 degrees, halfway between its previous orientations, and measure the electron. You might expect to get a spin of 0 or some other number between +1 and -1, but you only get either +1 or -1. It’s as though no matter how you move around the earth to measure its rotation, its axis always points straight at you, rotating clockwise or counter-clockwise. If you keep repeating the experiment on the electron, you get a sequence of +1s and -1s that, at first, seems random. But eventually all the +1s and -1s average out to 0. “Determinism has broken down, but in a particular way,” Susskind says.\n\nStay with me. Now let’s say you rotate the detector back to its original, upright position. What do you get? You do not get repeated observations of a spin of +1, as you did initially. You get an apparently random sequence of +1s and -1s that, again, over time average out to 0. No matter how you position the detector, you always get either +1 or -1, nothing in between. But the average of these readings varies depending on how far you rotate the detector from its original position.\n\nIf you’re already confused, good, you’re paying attention. These experiments on spin have odd implications. Spin, from the perspective of the very first experiment, performed with the upright detector, seems to be a robust, durable property of an electron, akin to Earth’s rotation. But from another perspective, spin varies depending on how you look at it. The way in which you experimentally measure spin matters, and so does the order in which you perform experiments. One measurement can negate the result of a prior measurement; the way we observe something seems to affect it. This is the notorious measurement problem, which has led physicists such as Eugene Wigner and John Wheeler to speculate that consciousness might be a fundamental feature of existence.\n\nAlso, remember that spin is not a continuous property, with many possible values. It can only have certain observed values, such as +1 or -1. Spin is lumpy, like Feynman’s droplets of light and the energy levels depicted in Quantum Physics for Babies. Before you look at the electron, however, it doesn’t have a specific spin. It hovers in a strange state, called “superposition,” encompassing both possible spins, +1 and -1, as well as values in between.\n\nAnother important point: Your uncertainty about the electron’s spin isn’t like your uncertainty about a spinning coin. You could in principle measure all the forces acting on a spinning coin and predict exactly how it will land. You can’t do that with an electron. No matter how precise your measurements are, the uncertainty persists.\n\nPhysicists describe the superposed state of an electron with mathematical objects called vectors, which resemble arrows of a certain length pointing in a certain direction in space. Physicists use vectors to represent golf balls, missiles and other things moving through our three-dimensional world. “I want you to completely forget about that concept of a vector,” Susskind says. The vectors used to describe spin exist in the abstract, purely mathematical realm called Hilbert space.\n\nThere’s more. The vectors used to describe spin yield what are called probability amplitudes; to compute the probability that an electron will have a certain spin when you measure it, you have to square its probability amplitude. Yes, this is familiar from Feynman’s QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter. Feynman doesn’t mention vectors, but he does represent the odds that light will bounce off glass with little arrows. These arrows correspond to probability amplitudes, which you square to get the probability of what light will do.\n\nBut recognition does not equal understanding; these concepts still seem hopelessly alien to me.\n\nBashing Deepak Chopra\n\nI need to return to quantum mysticism for a moment, to get something off my chest. Mean scientists often bash those who fashion quantum mechanics into a spiritual philosophy. The meanies single out Deepak Chopra, the alternative-medicine and spirituality guru, as an especially egregious quantum mystifier. Riffing on the measurement problem, Chopra says quantum mechanics confirms the ancient mystical doctrine that consciousness underpins reality.\n\nI’ve been mean to Chopra too, to his face. In 2016, he paid me to speak at a scientific shindig he hosted in Beverley Hills, California. To show his money hadn’t bought me, at the conference I knocked Chopra for suggesting in his bestseller Quantum Healing that your mind can help you overcome physiological ailments such as cancer. As I said this, Chopra was sitting beside me on a stage in a packed ballroom. Later, I wrote a column faulting Chopra for “monetizing meditation.”\n\nChopra was a good sport, and we ended up on friendly terms. Since then, I’ve decided that Chopra’s critics treat him unfairly. His quantum mysticism merely extends the mind-centrism of John Wheeler and other physicists. Chopra’s mind-over-matter medical claims are consistent with the placebo effect, the tendency of our expectations to become self-fulfilling. As for monetizing meditation, we’re all hustling; Chopra is just better at it than most of us.\n\nI return to Susskind, emboldened, but then I spot another term in his equations, e, just sitting there with no explanation, definition, context. I’ve seen e before, I know it’s important, but I don’t know why, so I return to Wikipedia. e is a constant known as Euler’s number, and it’s as ubiquitous as pi, or π. What is π again? It’s what you get if you divide the circumference of a circle by its diameter. How do you calculate π, with its infinite sequence of decimal points? There are lots of ways, which I can’t get into now, don’t get distracted.\n\nAs for e, it plays a vital role in logarithms. In fact, logarithms with base e are called “natural logarithms.” What are logarithms again? Like sines and cosines, I studied logarithms in high school, and I remember very little. So I look up logarithms on Wikipedia and the website “Math Is Fun.” The latter is for kids, which means it’s good for clueless geezers too.\n\n“Math Is Fun” says a logarithm answers the question, “How many of one number do we multiply to get another number?” Wikipedia defines a logarithm as “the inverse function to exponentiation.” Exponentiation is the multiplication of a number by itself. Multiply x times itself n times and you get x to the power of n, or xⁿ. So 10 to the power of three, or 10³, is 10 x 10 x 10, which equals 1,000.\n\nWhen you ask what the logarithm of a number is, you’re asking: How many times must you multiply a constant, called a base, by itself to get that number? Ten is a common base. The base-ten logarithm of 1,000 is 3, because 10 x 10 x 10, or 10³, equals 1,000. The base-ten logarithm of 100 is 2 and of 500 is 2.69897. Yes, exponents don’t need to be whole numbers.\n\nAs I try to absorb all this information, my brain feels overloaded.\n\nHer and the Space Between Numbers\n\nWhen I’m stressed out, I re-watch films I love. Needing a break from complex numbers and trigonometry, I re-watch Her. The hero, Theodore, falls in love with a sexy, SIRI-like smartphone program, Samantha. The plot sounds jokey, but Her is a sad, sad film. It’s about loneliness, our desperation to know and be known by each other. My daughter, Skye, who is in her mid-twenties and lives in Brooklyn, cried throughout the film, and she is not the sentimental type.\n\nA scene at the end of Her reminds me of my current project. Samantha, the artificial intelligence, who sounds like Scarlet Johansen, is telling Theodore, played by Joaquin Phoenix, that she’s changing, evolving, moving into new realms of consciousness. She’s been hanging out with other AIs, including one modeled after Alan Watts, a philosopher-mystic popular in the hippy era. I read Watts in my youth, hoping to make sense of my acid trips.\n\nSamantha is trying to be kind to Theodore, her human lover. She doesn’t say, I’m too smart for you now, but that is the problem. She says if an ordinary life, and relationship, is described by words, she’s becomes less interested in words and more interested in what’s between the words. The spaces between words are portals to infinite realms.\n\nOne of those realms, surely, is the realm of mathematics. Numbers, functions, equations express things that words—like the words I’m using in this very sentence--cannot. But mathematics is a language too, with its own limitations. We learned that from Gödel, the illogical logician, who was so fearful that someone would poison him that he stopped eating and died. Would Samantha, the artificial intelligence with Scarlet Johansen’s voice, eventually start exploring the spaces between numbers, too?\n\nIf she does, she might find something akin to music and poetry, to films like Her. That is the function of art, after all, to break through our habitual ways of seeing and knowing, to give us hints of the things flitting between words and numbers. Samantha might even find a new language, beyond words and numbers, that helps her see quantum mechanics and mysticism as two aspects of the same underlying mystery. But she probably won’t be able to translate her new language into terms that poor Theodore can grasp; all her analogies will fall short.\n\nTautologies\n\nTumbling down mathematical rabbit holes, I remember why I liked math as a kid. I enjoyed the crispness and clarity of it, the satisfaction of solving a puzzle with an unambiguously correct answer. And investigating e turns out to be fun. Like π, e is an irrational number. The judgmental descriptor irrational simply means that the number can’t be expressed as a fraction, or ratio of integers. Some irrational numbers, including π and e, fall into the more exclusive category of transcendental numbers, which cannot be expressed as an algebraic equation. Which goes to show that irrationality can equal transcendence, or vice versa.\n\nThere are many ways to calculate e, including this formula: e = 1 + 1/1 + 1/(1x2) + 1/(1x2x3) + 1/(1x2x3x4)… And so on to infinity. That comes out to 2.7 and change, just as pi equals 3.14 and change. e is helpful for projections of population growth and compound interest, which call for repeatedly feeding the result of a calculation back into the equation. e is connected to lots of other stuff, as indicated by this famous formula, known as Euler’s identity: e to the power of iπ + 1 = 0. (I spell out “e to the power of iπ” because I don’t know how to write iπ in superscript, but see illustration below.) i, remember, is an imaginary number, the square root of negative one. Euler’s identity connects the two primal integers, 1 and 0, with imaginary and complex numbers, trigonometry, logarithms and exponents.\n\nPondering Euler’s identity makes me giddy. So much packed into this little formula! It reminds us that mathematics is a great interconnected web. You can trace e through threads short and straightforward or long and tangled to π, i, 1, 0 and much, much more, including quantum mechanics. If I were more knowledgeable, I’d know how e connects calculus and linear algebra, the two major languages for describing quantum events. A century ago, theorists debated which language was correct, and eventually they realized that derivatives and integrals, on the one hand, and vectors and matrices, on the other, are two ways of describing the same strange quantum stuff.\n\nAgain, it’s hard to avoid the analogy with mysticism, especially the principle that all things are really one thing. Bertrand Russell fretted late in his career that mathematics reduces to tautologies, circular definitions, like “a four-footed animal is an animal.” Or 1 = 1. But is that intuition deflating or exhilarating? The latter, I think. 1 = 1 implies that, once you have something, you can’t have nothing, which would be like saying 1 = 0. That 1 in the equation 1 = 1 must be eternal, infinite, never-ending. Yes, 1 = 1 is circular, a tautology, but it’s profound; it resembles the mystical dictum Thou art that. And 1 = 1 leads to π and e and the whole astonishingly complicated, multi-dimensional landscape of mathematics and, by implication, human existence.\n\nMy thoughts, too, could be reducible to 1 = 1, or to a simple circle. I start with a trivial observation: I’m here, on a bench beside the Hudson River, writing in my notebook about Euler’s identity. I veer away from this observation, trying to find my way to other observations that might be a little less obvious, tautological. If I’m lucky, I stumble on something surprising. My quantum experiment will surely take me to strange new territories, where imaginary numbers wink in and out of existence. But narcissist that I am, I will always circle back to 1, to myself, my real/imaginary self, where everything begins and ends.\n\nAre all stories, including the big story, the epic, cosmic adventure, reducible to 1 = 1? Or to a circle? That’s the question. My girlfriend Emily, when I run these musings past her, says existence goes round and round, yes, but it also has a direction. It’s a spiral, taking us somewhere we’ve never been before, which might be better or might be worse. Listening to her, I think about the coronavirus, about the upcoming election, about the perilous state of my country and the world, and it occurs to me that not all spirals take us in a good direction. Planes, the kind with wings, spiral before they crash. Maybe 1 can become 0 after all. Or maybe the ultimate equation is 0 = 0.\n\nMy Mathematical Interlude\n\nReturning to Theoretical Minimum, I crash into a tutorial on the mathematics of vectors and Hilbert space. When Susskind talks about complex conjugates, bras and kets, inner products and orthonormal bases, he is speaking a lingo foreign to me. He anticipates my disorientation. Lenny and Art, the avatars of Susskind and his co-author, wander into “Hilbert’s Place,” and Art asks, “What is this? The Twilight Zone? Or some kind of fun house? I can’t get my bearings… Which way is up?”\n\nI know how Art feels. Re-reading Lecture 1 of Susskind, I’m lost, spiraling through space like an electron that has lost its nucleus. I don’t know which way is up and which is down, or if up and down even exist. When, if ever, will I get to the bottom, the ground, of quantum mechanics? A place where I can set my feet, get my bearings, know which way is up?\n\nSusskind calls his tutorials on complex numbers and vectors “Mathematical Interludes.” That phrase bugs me; it’s a contradiction in terms. An interlude is, or should be, a moment of rest, respite, relaxation. Like watching Deep Space Nine, the Star Trek reboot, while lying on my couch. Or doing nothing while lying on my couch.\n\nSusskind’s interludes on complex numbers and vector spaces aren’t relaxing; they’re hard, for me, anyway. But let’s say I go with his format and insert a “Mathematical Interlude” here. What can I say at this point in my quantum education? I would divide math into three categories, or sets. Make that four sets. No, six.\n\n1. Math I learned and still know. Fractions, decimals, integers, positive and negative numbers, real numbers, percentages, irrational numbers, addition, subtraction, square roots, exponents, multiplication, division. A little simple algebra. When I set it all down, it looks like a lot, but when I read Susskind, my knowledge seems pathetically minuscule.\n\n2. Math I learned and forgot. Logarithms, sines and cosines, calculus, derivatives and integrals. Sets, series, sums, limits. Did I ever learn Euler’s number? The basis of “natural” algorithms? Maybe, I can’t remember. I’m hoping to relearn this stuff for my quantum project.\n\n3. Math I never learned but hope to learn for my quantum experiment. Partial differential equations, complex numbers, linear algebra, vectors and matrices and Hilbert spaces.\n\n4. Math I might have a shot at learning if I tried really hard, but I’m not going to bother, because life’s too short.\n\n5. Math I couldn’t learn even if I had dedicated myself to learning it in my youth, like the math underlying string theory.\n\n6. Math that hasn’t been discovered yet and may never be discovered.\n\nEach set is a subset of the set below, which is much larger, and of the other sets, which are larger still. Set 1 is tiny, easily chartable. Sets 4 and 5, compared to set 1, are infinite. Set 6 is even more infinite. Set 6 may contain the math needed to resolve the riddles of quantum mechanics, to unify quantum field theory and general relativity, to explain how matter makes a mind.\n\nThis math might not be discoverable by any mere human. It might be discoverable only by a superintelligent machine, like Samantha in the film Her, the AI that sounds like Scarlet Johansen. [2] Perhaps this math doesn’t exist in any form. Except isn’t reality, including human consciousness, a demonstration proof that such transcendent math exists?\n\nThe Law of Laziness\n\nReading Susskind’s book reminds me of a phrase tossed around by editors at Scientific American when I started working there in the 1980s: hitting the wall. That describes the moment when an article gets too dense and technical for lay readers and even for us editors. Reading Susskind, I hit one wall after another.\n\nActually, “hitting the wall” is too metaphorically mild. I’ve fallen off a cliff and into a mineshaft, at the bottom of which is a dark, underground river that carries me to a realm of eternal, infinite unknowing. Except that sounds cool, like a mystical experience. I just feel stupid. I’m beginning to know how little I know. It’s a paradoxical kind of limit, in which adding increments of knowledge makes me feel dumber.\n\nI tell myself little lies to motivate myself. I think, while reading Susskind, I’m getting this, I could totally do these exercises at the end of the chapter, but I choose not to because I’m eager to move onto the next cool thing. Hermitian operators, here we come! Meanwhile, the mean-spirited grouch in me mutters, Bullshit, you don’t get anything, or you’d do those supposedly easy exercises.\n\nSusskind rewards me now and then with a big, philosophically resonant idea, like the principle of least action. This principle has a fussily technical definition, which differs depending on whether you are working within classical or quantum mechanics. The principle nonetheless stipulates that nature always minimizes energy expenditures. If you know the initial and final states of a system—like a rock teetering at the top of a hill and sitting at the bottom--the principle of least action helps you calculate what happens in between. That might mean simply finding the shortest or fastest path between the top and bottom of the hill."
