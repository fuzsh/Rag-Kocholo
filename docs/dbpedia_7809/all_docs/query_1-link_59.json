        "text": "Richard Feynman was born on 11 May 1918, exactly 100 years ago! I feel like celebrating so here one of my favorite Feynman's video. It' is probably not well know because it's not about since at all, but it is so funny!\n\nThe ending is just so said though...\n\nHope you enjoy it\n\nGeorge Jones said:\n\nIt would be fun to visit CalTech today...\n\nMuch of the focus will be at the California Institute of Technology, where Feynman worked for almost four decades until his death in 1988. It is hosting a two-day meeting featuring a star-studded line up of guests who include Feynman’s sister Joan and his adopted daughter Michelle. Also present at the “Feynman 100” celebration and symposium will be other top scientists like Freeman Dyson, David Gross, Lisa Randall, Sara Seager, Leonard Susskind and Kip Thorne who will “survey the current frontiers of knowledge and share their vision of where science is heading”.\n\nThe \"Express\" decided to do a \"physics Top 10\" in commemoration of Feynman's birthday. But quick! Spot the one obvious error on this list before they got wind of it and correct it (hopefully). And no, it is not about Olivia Newton-John's grandfather! :)\n\nhttps://www.express.co.uk/life-style/top10facts/958225/Richard-Feynman-birthday-physics-facts\n\nZz.\n\nGeorge Jones said:\n\nThe Express should have conducted itself better.\n\nUnfortunately, many news organizations right now don't seem to care to do fact-checking, especially on science articles or news. The fact that they thought Bardeen won a Nobel Prize for \"MRI imaging\" is really mind-boggling, considering that (i) his second Nobel prize was for the theory of superconductivity (he was the \"B\" in BCS theory); (ii) the Nobel Prize for MRI imaging was awarded to Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield, (iii) the Nobel prize for MRI imaging was for medicine, not physics, and finally (iv) the Nobel prize for MRI imaging was awarded in 2003, more than 10 years after Bardeen died (1991).\n\nANY one of these facts can be found by simple Googling.\n\nAnd as of now, I suppose no one has alerted them of this silly error, because I still see it there.\n\nZz."
