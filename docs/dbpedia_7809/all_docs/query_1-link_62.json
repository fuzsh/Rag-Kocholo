        "text": "The day that Leonard Susskind decided he was not going to follow his father into the family plumbing business, his parents were appalled. “My father was a tough guy,” says Prof Susskind with a chuckle. “He said: ‘What do you want to be: a ballet dancer?’ I said: ‘No, I don’t want to be a ballet dancer, I want to be a physicist.’ He said: ‘You aint going to work in no drugstore.’ I said: ‘No, not a pharmacist, a physicist.’ He said: ‘What’s a physicist?’ I said: ‘Like Einstein.’ That shook him and from that moment he got it. My mother was crying and saying, ‘We’re going to be broke,’ and he just looked at her and said: ‘Shut up – he’s going to be Einstein.’” Susskind may not quite be Einstein but he is a very eminent physicist. One of the founders of string theory – the complex branch of mathematics that attempts to unite the weirdness of quantum mechanics and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity – he has been a physics professor at Stanford University for the past 35 years.\n\nDubbed “the bad boy of physics” – due to his own accounts of childhood rebellion and his history of disputes with Stephen Hawking and others – Susskind has a knack for writing books that you don’t need a degree in physics to understand. His last book Classical Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum, was a bestseller in the United States: The Wall Street Journal called it “The Book” for introductory physics. Coupled with his online series of lectures The Theoretical Minimum, he teaches everything required to gain a basic understanding of modern physics.\n\nBut, as he puts it in the introduction to his latest ‘Theoretical Minimum’ book about quantum mechanics, which he co-wrote with data engineer Art Friedman: “Don’t let our light-hearted humour fool you into thinking that we’re writing for airheads. We’re not. Our goal is to make a difficult subject ‘as simple as possible, but no simpler’.”\n\nI can vouch that the book is not for airheads because I personally could not make head or tail of it. I knew I was sunk when I read the words: “You don’t need to be a physicist to take this journey, but you should have some basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra.” By page 32 we were into “orthogonal vectors” and “orthonormal basis” and my mind was boggling. I ploughed on, enjoying the colourful introductions to each chapter, which set the scene for Lenny and Art “two [novices] from California who somehow got separated from their tour bus”. But I had long lost my own tour bus by the end and was a little daunted at the thought of speaking to the great man himself.\n\nI needn’t have worried. Susskind is friendly and courteous, with a ready sense of humour. “Why I am being interviewed is beyond my understanding,” he says in an email beforehand. “But, what the hell.” He talks engagingly about his childhood and his path to physics, only once betraying a hint of impatience when I ask him to repeat the name of the man at whose house he and Hawking met. “Werner Erhard. Look him up.” (Erhard is a critical thinker who made his fortune with the New Age group, est, and is something of a “physics groupie”, presiding over meetings of some of the world’s greatest physicists.)\n\nIt was at Erhard’s house in San Francisco in 1981 that Susskind and Hawking began their now infamous Black Hole War, which became the title of Susskind’s subsequent book. Hawking made the stunning claim that material which falls into a black hole disappears forever. If correct, it would mean that the fundamental laws of the universe would have to be rewritten. From the point of view of a quantum theorist, like Susskind, this was impossible: the central principle of quantum mechanics is that information can never be annihilated.\n\nSusskind drove home preoccupied by Hawking’s claim. “I was trying to visualise the geometry of a black hole and the weather was so bad that the windshield was covered with frost. As the traffic slowed down, I drew the diagram on the frosted windshield with my finger. I was obsessed with it. I couldn’t see how what he said was right. On the other hand I couldn’t see anything wrong with it either.”\n\nNot that he is dismissive of Hawking. Far from it. The two men are friends and Susskind had dinner at his house when he was last in Cambridge. “We had a very, very nice conversation – meaning his daughter and woman friend, my wife and I had a nice conversation. Stephen was able to interject a sentence maybe five times during the evening. He is an extremely witty man. How he manages to keep himself sane with that kind of frustration is a marvel.”\n\nOf Hawking’s contribution to science, he says: “He’s one of the great physicists of all time. He saw the right questions – which can often be more important than finding the right answers.” Like Hawking, Susskind is in the rare position of being a “celebrity physicist”. He is a well-recognised figure around the Stanford campus and Palo Alto, where he lives. “If someone recognises me, I shake their hand and ask them if they’re interested in physics but I’m a very private person. I like to talk, indeed I do, but I live a very, very simple life. My wife and I spend most of our time together. I very secretly play the classical guitar. My wife is a painter.”\n\nHe is amused and exasperated by the strange emails he receives. “I get at least 10 a day – people with their own theories or people who seem to think I can help them. I’ve had lapsed Christian ministers wanting me to tell them they were doing the right thing. I had a lady who lost her dog and wanted to know if string theory could help her communicate with it. I had somebody who thinks she was invaded by string theory and her insides are now all tangled up. Can I help her?” Does he ever reply? “I don’t. As soon as I get even a whiff of ‘Let-me-tell-you-my-theory’ I dismiss it. But if someone asks me a serious physics question or needs advice, I try to answer them.”\n\nNow 73, Susskind was born into a Jewish family in the Bronx, New York. “I grew up in what can only be described as an extreme working-class family. My father was a plumber with a fifth grade education. All his friends were plumbers and steam fitters and steeple jacks. If you were as poor as him and had to leave school, you had two choices: you could either become a working man or you could become a gangster.”\n\nSusskind describes himself as a “poor student in everything. I look back now and I think part of it was I had a chip on the shoulder to do with the working-class background. I resented school, I resented the teachers, I was just a rotten kid. At one point in the sixth grade [when he was 11 or 12] I got put back into the fifth grade. Time after time I was disciplined and my parents were always having to come to the school.”\n\nAn only child, Susskind shared a tiny one-bedroom apartment with his parents. “Because it wasn’t really big enough for three people, my parents didn’t want me in the house all the time so I spent a lot of time on the street. There must have been about 500 kids on my block and it was a community of ethnic rivalries – Irish, Italians, Jews. It wasn’t a happy childhood, I felt like an outsider.”\n\nBut he learnt a lot from his father’s friends. “I call it the university of the kitchen table. They talked about all kinds of things and one of my father’s friends lent me a crackpot book called Worlds in Collision [by Immanuel Velikovsky, who attributed most biblical catastrophes to Jupiter ejecting Venus and changing Earth’s orbit and axis]. I was fascinated by it; the book had all kinds of technical scientific terms in it, including electro magnetic radiation, whatever, it really caught my imagination.”\n\nLater, finding he had an aptitude for numbers, he decided to teach himself calculus. “I used to hide the book because I didn’t want my friends thinking that I was interested in mathematics. I didn’t know about physics, I didn’t distinguish it from mathematics at the time.”\n\nWhen he was 14, his father became sick. “Slowly but surely I started working in his business.” Later, while still working, he went to college to study mechanical engineering. “The idea was to learn how to build furnaces for the buildings in the Bronx my father worked on. I took a course or two in physics and I suddenly decided this is what I really wanted to do. By then I was already married and I had a child.”\n\nOnce his father got over the initial shock, he became his biggest supporter. “He got very excited and tried at that point to learn physics and some mathematics. He wasn’t ignorant and he knew a good deal about science but he didn’t have a mathematics background.”\n\nAfter graduating, Susskind became an assistant professor of physics at Yeshiva University in New York, then a physics professor in Tel Aviv. He moved to Stanford in 1978 and since 2000 has held the Felix Bloch professorship of physics. In 1998 he was awarded the JJ Sakurai prize for his “pioneering contributions to hadronic string models, lattice gauge theories, quantum chromodynamics and dynamical symmetry breaking”. Finding he had an ability for conveying complex theories in language that (most) laymen could understand, he started writing. His first book, The Cosmic Landscape – about string theory – was published in 2005. The writing looks more effortless than it is. “It’s a very conscious construct on my part. I care even more about the quality of the writing than the quality of the physics.”\n\nHis evening classes for adults, not necessarily enrolled at the university, became wildly popular and someone had the bright idea of videotaping them and putting them online. “Now people all over the world are following my classes,” says Susskind, sounding a bit stunned.\n\nIn some ways, Susskind feels he has been born out of his time. “I’m basically a 19th-century man who accidentally got caught in the 20th century and now I’m two centuries out of date.” And yet he has substantially accelerated our understanding of how the world works. “There are a lot of people who have done that,” he says dismissively.\n\nThere is one question about the future that tantalises him. “I would love to know how people view quantum mechanics 500 years from now. I strongly suspect that what appears now to be two separate sets of questions – the questions of gravity and general relativity on the one hand and quantum mechanics on the other – will be much more tightly linked and will be seen as one subject. If there is one thing I would like to know from the future, it would be that.”\n\nI ask him whether he ever gets fed up with physics and thinks to hell with it all, who cares anyway. He takes this irritating question in his stride. “I do get a little bit of burnout sometimes when you look at what you’ve been doing and you get a little sick to your stomach. I’ve learnt to get away from it, play the guitar or go to the movies. Within a couple of days, it always just comes back.”\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, he has no belief in a higher being of any sort. “If you ask me, ‘Is it possible that the world was created by an intelligent being?’ I would ask, ‘Is that intelligent being made of atoms, does it satisfy quantum mechanics?’ And I realise it doesn’t help at all.”\n\nHe finds his absorption in bigger questions about the universe comforting. “When things are unpleasant, I tend to withdraw into what I do best, namely solving my physics problems. That’s an enormous source of strength for me. Even though I am getting older and we all have to face the inevitable, I find that I don’t need a faith-based source of strength. My wife, my music and my physics seem to be enough for me.”\n\nHis father died in 1978 but Susskind – now a great grandfather himself – says he still feels his influence. “I think my interest in teaching people started when my father was trying to learn physics. He struggled. He worked at it until he died. And of course I wasn’t really around at the time to help him and to guide him. Ever since, I’ve always felt, when I was teaching people, that I was really teaching physics to my father.”"
