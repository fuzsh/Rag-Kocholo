Maybe we should all be focusing on big bang cosmology: https://81018.com/new-science/\n\nIt may require too many uncomfortable paradigm shifts; I reduced it all to an initial eight. All stretch current belief systems:\n\n1) Recognize the importance and place of the natural units and all the dimensionless constants like pi (π). Some of these units would logically define the first moment of space-time. Pi (π) with its generation of circles and spheres has three primary facets, continuity-symmetry-harmony. If we were to take as a given that pi participates in the creation of the first moment of space-time, it necessarily preconditions all things everywhere, for all time.1\n\n2) Recognize how base-2 exponentiation defines 202 notations from the Planck, Stoney or ISO base units (with all the associated natural units and dimensionless constants). This mapping starts at the first moment of space-time, Notation-1, and goes right up to this very moment in time, which we will call the Now.\n\nThis natural inflation is virtually identical to the inflation/expansion within the big bang. Those first 64 base-2 notations within the infinitesimal open many new possibilities for basic mathematical applications. Although considerable work had been done to accommodate the Big Bang, most of it will not need updating, just the expression, after the big bang. It will begin to mean “…after the big bang became an historic footnote of a key theory that failed.”2\n\n3) Recognize how the first 64 notations are below the thresholds of measurement by devices and instrumentation. Knowledge of these domains is currently only through logic and mathematics (including algorithms, equations and geometries). Our current outline is active right Now.3\n\n4) Recognize the expansion (and inflation) by acknowledging that there is one infinitesimal sphere for each of the smallest possible units of length-and-time. As an example, a simple calculation with Planck’s numbers yields 539 tredecillion spheres per second.4\n\n5) Recognize how these spheres populate the universe and render a grid or matrix of 202 notations connecting all things for all time, everywhere.5\n\n6) Recognize how this grid defines a domain of perfection because there is too little time and too much density for imperfections to manifest. Today quantum fluctuations are measured within Notations 65-to-67.6\n\n7) Recognize that quantum fluctuations have a geometry that is opened with five tetrahedrons and/or five octahedrons (close-up) and/or icosahedrons made of twenty tetrahedrons and/or the Pentakis dodecahedron of twelve five-tetrahedral clusters. This imperfect or squishy geometry is the geometry of indeterminism, probabilities, and free will.7\n\n8) Recognize those studies not connected to a Standard Model. Within a base-2 infrastructure of the universe each of these disciplines can apply their work most likely within the first 64 notations that ostensibly connect the two models.8\n\nPossible or just poppycock?\n\nThanks.\n\nWarmnly,\n\nBruce\n\nThird email: 9 May 2020 at 6 PM\n\nDear Prof. Dr. Leonard Susskind:\n\nI did not know Planck Length divided by Planck Time is equal to 299,792 kilometers and is within .001% of the NIST /SI calculation (just reaffirmed in 2019). For me, it was a key calculation. Unrecognized, Planck was closer than anybody for over seventy years. Using Planck units, one second will always equal 299,792 km. Please forgive me if I am being overly simplistic; this all came out of a high school geometry class.\n\nYou may remember that in 2011 we unwittingly applied base-2 while chasing tetrahedrons and its octahedron from our desktop models down to the Planck Length in 112 steps and out to the current size and age of the universe in just 90 steps. It was a very nice outline of the universe in 202 notations. One second is within Notation-143.\n\nOf course, as a high school project, we didn’t know what it meant, if anything at all.\n\nToday, we are fully idiosyncratic and boldly speculative. I have concluded:\n\n1. Planck Length and Planck Time define the first instance of physicality. 2. That first moment instantiates an infinitesimal sphere, 67 base-2 notations smaller than waves and particles. It is an infinitely fast, steady stream of spheres. 3. Cubic close packing of equal spheres is part of the description of the dynamics for the emergence of geometries and forms, functions, structures… Langlands and your strings have a place to begin to unfold. The Fourier transform and all the dimensionless constants have their first coming-out parties. Continuity, symmetry and harmony rule the day.\n\nOf course, a radically different model where Rovelli’s “Now” begins to make sense because every one of those notations are building off each other. Now that puts a different spin on things!\n\nSpace and time are derivative of each other, of light and all the dimensionless constants that define those Planck base units. Planck’s calculations in 1899 were very good. He rather ignored them. Einstein did as well. It’d take Frank Wilczek in 2001 to put a spotlight on the numbers to pull them into the public domain to be used by the scientific and scholarly communities.\n\nWe still have a long way to go. Space and time are derivative. Of what? Infinity? I define infinity only as continuity (order, numbers), symmetry (relations, geometries) and harmony (dynamics and space-time). It is the qualitative; the finite is the quantitative. Let’s not make it spooky.\n\nI’ve played around with it all within my very first FQXi article. Coming out of my shell, you could easily kick my head right back in! What do I know?\n\nHere we go:\n\nSummary: https://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/3428\n\nArticle: https://fqxi.org/data/essay-contest-files/Camber_3u.pdf\n\nThanks.\n\nMost sincerely,\n\nBruce\n\nPS. Our correspondence goes back a ways, but I have lost those records. To keep me somewhat aware of what I have said in the past, I now post my notes with references to our some of each scholar’s work that I follow. My page for you is here: https://81018.com/susskind/\n\nSecond email: 24 September 2018\n\nRE: GR=QM Current reading: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03040 (PDF) (10 August 2017)\n\n“Dear Qubitzers, GR=QM”\n\nDear Prof. Dr. Leonard Susskind:\n\nMy study of quantum gravity is still naive and formative, yet I believe that the first part of our application of base-2 to the Planck base units, essentially the first 64 notations (doublings), gives substantial room for the mathematics of anti-de Sitter-conformal field theory correspondence to breathe more easily. Y’all seem to be forced into too tight a space for your gauge/gravity duality thoughts.\n\nAt some point in time, it seems that Robert Langlands and Ed Witten should be called on to help, yet even they have no place to work with the big bang blocking their access to those Planck units.\n\nWell, I’m formulating some thoughts about your work and this “lack of space to create the math” in a more systematic way so I will be referencing my letters to you here: https://81018.com/susskind and it will follow work done on this page about gravity: https://81018.com/gravity/\n\nI know that it is all nonsense to the elite within these circles, yet at some point this simple model might have some relevancy.\n\nThanks. I wish you well.\n\nMost sincerely,\n\nBruce\n\nFirst email: 6 July 2017\n\nDear Prof. Dr. Leonard Susskind:\n\nI stopped today to listen to your lecture (you were 73 years old when it was recorded). I’m 70 and out of Boston University with Shimony, Cohen and that gang. Viki Weisskopf opened the way for me to visit with Bell a couple of times at CERN (’75 and ’77). In 1980 in Paris JP Vigier and Olivier Costa de Beauregard were mentors (with opposite views).\n\nNow, in your search for symmetry, my mind wandered back to Max Planck’s work. You started with Boltlzmann’s empty universe and 10-to-the-80th molecules compressed in a corner.\n\nWhat if we were to start with Planck’s base units? Not very interesting? Well, what if we allow them to double and continue to double? Within 67 steps we enter the CERN-scale. In another 67-68 steps, we enter into the large-scale universe (Notations 134-and 135 would be out to the International Space Station). In another 67 steps, we exit at notation 202 into the Age of the Universe right now.\n\nThe first second is between notations 143 and 144.\n\nThere are just over 202 doublings to inscribe the universe with multiples of the Planck base units. There is a certain coherency in these doublings; they track well together providing a natural inflation and a very clear definition of the cosmological epochs. The first 67 notations, perhaps Wilczek’s grid, give us a more variegated possible mathematical foundation than ever imagined.\n\nTime symmetry is established in a rather awkward way. We know that Planck Length divided by Planck Time equals the speed of light. Max gave us that formula back in around 1900 and within each notation\n\nthe simple math gives us a variable speed of light, “symmetric by notation” except for Notation-202.\n\nQuasi-symmetry?\n\nA peculiar thought. Time becomes quite finite, entirely derivative, quantized and quasi-symmetric. Is this a bit of idiosyncratic silliness? We are just high school people trying to learn the basics but not the mistakes of the old masters (like Newton’s absolute time).\n\nAlthough a strange introduction, it is as honest as I can be. We are in search of scholars who can help us better understand our simple math; is it just nonsense?\n\nThanks.\n\nMost sincerely,\n\nBruce\n\n*******************\n\nBruce Camber\n\nhttp://81018.com"
