        "text": "How to do the Impossible by developing this skill? 👇🏼 Ever felt like your goals are too big to handle? We all have..................................... I have seen people change their lives by following a simple idea - ✨ Start by doing what is necessary, then what is possible, and suddenly, you are doing the impossible Just by mastering this superpower - FOCUS. In a world filled with distractions, developing a deep focus is your superpower. ✨Here are five powerful steps to master this power:✨ 1 *Prioritize with Purpose* : Identify tasks that align with your ultimate goal. Break them down into smaller, manageable steps. Tackling what's necessary first lays the groundwork for the extraordinary. 2 *Eliminate Distractions:* Clear your workspace and mute unnecessary notifications. When your environment is conducive to focus, your mind can channel its energy towards the possible, inching closer to the impossible. 3. *Time Blocking Mastery* : Allocate specific time blocks for tasks. By dedicating focused intervals, you're telling your brain, \"Now, we're doing this.\" The impossible becomes achievable through structured, intentional efforts. 4. *Mindful Breathing Breaks:* Amidst the hustle, take short breaks for deep, mindful breaths. Oxygen fuels your brain, enhancing concentration. Inhale clarity, exhale distractions. Simple yet profoundly effective. 5. *Celebrate Small Wins:* Acknowledge and celebrate each step, no matter how small. It's not just about the destination; the journey is equally important. Recognizing progress fuels motivation for the next leap towards the impossible. The journey to the impossible starts with a single step doing what's necessary. Focus on one task at a time, and watch as the world of possibilities expands before you. I hope that Helps, it has certainly helped me, and i am enlightened to share this with my community.

You are special, unique, and not a clone. You are a customized and divinely calibrated product of the Almighty God. Life as long as you live is incomplete without you. So, let your presence count, and let it count meaningfully. You exist to collaborate, cooperate, contribute, and complement others to complete yourself. It is for these reasons you are being created a tripartite, systemic, relational, rational, and emotional being of purpose, procreation, and productivity. Having this understanding helps you appreciate your uniqueness and comparative advantage in your special area of call and assignment which empowers your inner mind on a journey of self-awareness and consciousness that leads to self-discovery. At the epicenter of self-discovery are the configurations of your creativity that are completely and uniquely yours. Your acceptance, appreciation, and alignment with this special identity will help you nurture, groom, and grow your creative ideas into an appreciable standard that becomes a solution for an identifiable pain point within the society you are called to serve. You cannot effectively and efficiently navigate thoughts through to actions in the search for self-discovery and identity if you are not emotionally stable. That is the essence of why self-love and emotional intelligence must be grasped and grabbed while you manage to contain and contend with the distractions. THE EXPECTATIONS As Parents and child caregivers, we are expected to live with awareness and consciousness of life's concept of complementary completions to inculcate in our children and wards the right family identities, cultures, and values for blissful and peaceful communal living. As I will often say, re-echoing my life philosophy, life is better in an arena of complementary completions than in an arena of competitive comparisons that breed feuds and foes.

New weeks are really exciting and gives me the thought of a new opportunity to start something new, correct my wrongs and learn something new. I celebrated my birthday yesterday. For me, this is the beginning of a new year. I wrote down a piece of information about 'affirmation' and I want to share with you. Affirmation means to show or express a strong belief in or dedication to something (Mariam Webster Dictionary). Affirmation is a motivating push to act on certain things, change your negative thinking patterns, helps your concentrate on achieving your goals on life. Start your week with positive affirmations, pray and watch a successful week unfold itself. My affirmation this week; 1. I am smart. 2.I am enough. 3.I can do better. 4.I am proud of myself. 5.this week will be productive for me. Say a few affirmations to yourself and live right. You can live your dreams, achieve those life goals and tour the world if you believe in yourself. Yes, I can do it. You can do it too. Stay blessed and ready to grab opportunities this week. God bless every step your take. Follow me as I share every new thing I learn this week. #affirmation #day1 #linkedinchallenge #mondaymotivation #wearetheroothub #digitalmarketingexpert\n\nThis week’s MindSpa Adventure is more experimental. We had a request for a water-themed experience. Well (pun intended) I'm a big fan of nature metaphors (plus i love water anyway), so i’m 100% up for it – and this journey is what popped into my mind: Remember (even if only vaguely) the water cycle we learned at school? Here it is as a metaphor, a way to explore creation and learning. We use the initial, excitable beginnings to make new thoughts and paths. What happens as thought, energy and intention tumble and flow down to oceans of experience and knowledge? If you’re curious, it’s in the recording. I’d love to know what you make of it. What just happened? The cycle. Listen here for free: https://lnkd.in/eDy6GhC4 (30 mins listen) ——————————— I love the creative challenge that suggestions and requests bring. It helps keep the mindspa adventures fresh and keeps me crafting experiences for you, the listener, instead of just for me. It’s also pretty scary sometimes. I feel a bit uncertain, even self-conscious, about sharing an idea with the world – especially if I haven't had time and early feedback to refine it. Sometimes it feels uncomfortable. This is unavoidable, I suspect, when creating something new and offering it up to people – especially people we don’t yet know. I find it’s an act of trust, of vulnerability. I’m grateful to those who have shared these experiences with me for their curiosity. I'm thrilled every week when you make delightful, moving and insightful experiences out of these ideas. To everyone who’s stayed, if even for a moment, and listened — thank you. To everyone who brought a request or suggestion — thank you. To everyone who took an idea I offered, a seed I helped plant, and grew something beautiful — thank you.\n\n𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙇𝙞𝙫𝙚 𝙖 𝙃𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙮 𝙇𝙞𝙛𝙚: 𝘿𝙞𝙨𝙘𝙤𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙔𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝘾𝙤𝙧𝙚 𝙑𝙖𝙡𝙪𝙚𝙨 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙀𝙢𝙗𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙍𝙀𝘼𝙇𝙉𝙀𝙎𝙎 Oh, hi there! One of the most effective and quickest ways to create a happy life is to uncover your REAL values and start ACTING on them. So many people 'out there' in the world feel frustrated and miserable with their lives yet continue to chase the same old things that are actually making them miserable in the first place (without them knowing). This is almost always because they're chasing goals that are aligned with values that are an extension of ego, unresolved emotional 'stuff', and social programming rather than anything rooted in REALNESS and truth. This video explains all this 'stuff' and gives you some simple techniques that can help you figure out your own real values and start translating them into action. Ultimately, the values that will make you feel most alive are the values that support your growth and expansion towards WHOLENESS. These are aligned with your realness and nature as a human being. Those that may give you a short-lived boost are the ones that will simply turn to dust once you've attained anything motivated by them (if you do) because they keep you in a place that also feels good sometimes but where you don't really wanna be: Ego. Get in touch if you have any questions or whatever (or if you don't if you want)! Peace, Oli https://lnkd.in/ewgCpwkC\n\n🌻New Week, Fresh Possibilities!
