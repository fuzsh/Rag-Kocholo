Script or hole cancels are normal for these issues and are not damage. In some lots some stamps may still on paper and can be soaked off if you prefer but often they are collected still on paper because of the risk of the ink in script cancels running and ruining the stamps. Some stamps in some lots have faults which is also quite usual for these issues; condition can be gauged from the scans. Similarly the scan will let you know if many stamps in the lot are on paper or have hole or script cancels. They are all quite old and scarce and there is excellent value here.\n\nIn many Indian State lots shade varieties, perforation varieties, small design differences, paper differences, and water mark differences are counted as being different.\n\nIf you purchase multiple items and wait for me to invoice you I will combine the shipping and reduce your costs. I only try to cover shipping costs not profit on shipping and handling.\n\nSeller Information\n\nSeller\n\nwidgetc (485)\n\nRegistered Since\n\n06/27/2008\n\nFeedback\n\n100%\n\nItem Location\n\nOntario, Canada\n\nShips To\n\nWorldwide\n\nPostage Calculator\n\nSelect Country\n\nQuantity\n\nReturns Accepted\n\nYes\n\nReturns Policy\n\nMoney back or replacement (buyer's choice) - Returns Accepted within 30 Days (Buyer pays Shipping Cost)"
