        "text": "This week’s MindSpa Adventure is more experimental. We had a request for a water-themed experience. Well (pun intended) I'm a big fan of nature metaphors (plus i love water anyway), so i’m 100% up for it – and this journey is what popped into my mind: Remember (even if only vaguely) the water cycle we learned at school? Here it is as a metaphor, a way to explore creation and learning. We use the initial, excitable beginnings to make new thoughts and paths. What happens as thought, energy and intention tumble and flow down to oceans of experience and knowledge? If you’re curious, it’s in the recording. I’d love to know what you make of it. What just happened? The cycle. Listen here for free: https://lnkd.in/eDy6GhC4 (30 mins listen) ——————————— I love the creative challenge that suggestions and requests bring. It helps keep the mindspa adventures fresh and keeps me crafting experiences for you, the listener, instead of just for me. It’s also pretty scary sometimes. I feel a bit uncertain, even self-conscious, about sharing an idea with the world – especially if I haven't had time and early feedback to refine it. Sometimes it feels uncomfortable. This is unavoidable, I suspect, when creating something new and offering it up to people – especially people we don’t yet know. I find it’s an act of trust, of vulnerability. I’m grateful to those who have shared these experiences with me for their curiosity. I'm thrilled every week when you make delightful, moving and insightful experiences out of these ideas. To everyone who’s stayed, if even for a moment, and listened — thank you. To everyone who brought a request or suggestion — thank you. To everyone who took an idea I offered, a seed I helped plant, and grew something beautiful — thank you.\n\nAre you ready to realize your true potential and live authentically? \"Activate Your Authenticity\" is an empowering journey where you will experience true transformation.

Here are ten lessons learned when you choose to try something new (like a drum circle!): 🛡️Resilience: Drumming builds resilience – the beat goes on, and so do you! 🥁💪 💫 Courage: Step out of your comfort zone, embrace the rhythm, and discover a newfound courage within yourself. The drum is your instrument of empowerment. 🌱 Learning and Growth: Drumming is not just a beat; it's a journey of continuous learning and personal growth. 🌍 Open-mindedness: Joining a drum circle introduces you to diverse rhythms and cultures, fostering open-mindedness and breaking down barriers. 🎨 Creativity: Drumming stimulates creativity, encouraging you to march to the beat of your own drum. 🔍 Self-discovery: Unearth hidden talents, passions, and facets of your personality you might not have nurtured otherwise! 🌀Adaptability: Engaging with rhythm teaches adaptability, a crucial skill in navigating life's twists and turns. 🚀 Building Confidence: Every beat is a step toward confidence. Drumming empowers, and the collective energy of being in the circle with others fuels a sense of accomplishment. ⏳ Patience: Drumming isn't just a quick rhythm; it's a journey. Exercise patience as you learn and grow, both individually and collectively. 🤝 Connection with Others 🤝: Drum circles create social symphonies, connecting diverse souls through the universal language of rhythm. Ready to experience the transformative power of drumming? Check out one of our community drum circles for free!\n\n☕️ Coffee Time Conversation: Overcoming and Achieving ☕️ Good morning, friends!

It was so impactful because it was a BIG change. BIG change can impact your entire existence but it can also inspire growth. 📘In my vlog, “Sometimes New Beginnings Start With Good-Bye” (link in first comment), I talk about managing BIG change and how Psychological Safety is a vital element for being able to thrive during times of transition. To celebrate the new year, I’m not making a list of things I want to accomplish in 2024. I’m focusing instead on being grateful for family, friends, good health, and the life I have. ♥️I hope you’re the reason someone feels welcomed, seen, heard, valued, loved and supported. My wish for you in 2024 and always, is to be happy, healthy, loved and living your purpose.♥️ Shine on beautiful people. 🦄 #newbeginnings #psychologicalsafety #mindset #strongwomen #alignment #mindset #empoweringwomen #behindfrenemylines #collaborationovercompetition #authenticity #sisterhood #friendshipcircles #furthertogether #freetheworldfromfrenemies #nomoremeangirls #norivalry #rebuildrelationships #positivechange #betruetoyou #fearlessfemales #makeroom #confidence #bettertogether https://lnkd.in/etsENNwQ\n\nSpiritual reflection and encouragement for the week: As I reflect at the end of 2023 and look forward to 2024, I ponder whether we could build strong connection by disconnecting? get closer by breaking open? feel deeper by thinking less? become more complete by letting go of self? know more by saying less? listen more by judging less? For the spiritual reflection and encouragement this week, I did not quote anyone but ask myself what are the most interesting queries this year. It is interesting how learning is facilitated by unlearning, less is actually more, worldly is inseparable from the transcendental. May you all be well and happy in this festive season and New Year 2024!\n\n🌟 Empower Your Mind: Transform Your Inner Dialogue 🌟 Ever feel like your mind is constantly working against you rather than being your ally?
