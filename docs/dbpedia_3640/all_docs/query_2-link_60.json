        "text": "The Jasdan assembly constituency in Gujarat is being keenly watched by both the Congress and the ruling BJP considering that it comes just a week after the BJP lost three key states to the Congress in the north - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.\n\nThe election in Gujarat’s Jasdan assembly was necessitated after the Congress leader and Koli community leader Kunvarji Bavaliya left the Congress and joined the BJP after resigning from both the legislature and the party; he was named a cabinet minister in the Vijay Rupani-led BJP government in the state in July.\n\nPitted against Bavaliya, a four time MLA and a one term MP, is Congress’s Avsar Nakia.\n\nNakiya, a Rajkot district panchayat member who had once worked closely with Bavaliya, a five-time MLA, contested the assembly election for first time in his life.\n\nAs per rules, a minister has to get himself/herself elected to the Assembly within six months of taking oath.\n\n“Polling for Jasdan assembly seat in Rajkot district was held on December 20 with a voter turnout of 71.27 per cent”, stated a release issued by Gujarat Chief Electoral Officer S. Murali Krishna.\n\nThe constituency has 2.32 lakh registered voters.\n\nBavaliya had won the seat on Congress tickets in 1995, 1998, 2002, 2007 and 2017.\n\nSince the formation of Gujarat in 1960, the BJP has won this seat only once - in the by-election held in 2009 when Bavaliya vacated the seat after being elected to Lok Sabha from Rajkot.\n\n- with inputs from Agencies"
