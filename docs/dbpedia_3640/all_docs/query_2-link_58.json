        "text": "‘Bavaliya is a Traitor’\n\nThe Quint spoke with several residents of Jasdan Taluka who voiced a mixed response to the By-Polls.\n\nAt a sabha organised in Amrapura village by the BJP, local resident Shambhu Dabhi told The Quint, “As long as Bavaliya is on the ballot, it doesn’t matter which political party he joins. Jasdan is his fortress and for years he has helped the poor farmers here.”\n\n“He is a traitor. I was part of PAAS and we helped Bavaliya during campaigning. On the day of the election, BJP workers attacked us after polling concluded. And now he has joined the same party. People will not forgive his treachery.”\n\nDhirubhai Khokaria, Atkot Village, Jasdan\n\nGujarat Congress President, Amit Chavda told The Quint that the Congress had always respected Bavaliya and gave him high ranking positions within the party.\n\n“The Congress made Kunvarji Bavaliya an MLA and MP and gave him the top position within party, yet he betrayed the party. The people had voted him on the Congress symbol. Without asking or telling anyone, he betrayed the party and the people for his political ambitions.”\n\nAmit Chavda, Gujarat Congress President\n\nCongress candidate Avchar Nakia said, “He (Bavaliya) wants to open BJP’s account here in Jasdan. But they will not be allowed to. Jasdan was and will always remain a Congress stronghold.”\n\nBJP is Counting on Bavaliya’s Cabinet Berth\n\nThe BJP is desperate to clinch Jasdan and believes that Bavaliya will bag the seat for the party, thereby raising their numbers in Assembly.\n\nAt a sabha held at the local BJP office in Shivrajpur village in the outskirts of Jasdan Taluka, Bavaliya thanked the BJP leadership.\n\n“A historic decision was taken by our PM, Gujarat’s CM and senior leaders of BJP who have shown their trust in me thanks to your blessings and confidence in me. They gave me three independent portfolios along with a direct cabinet berth. Bharat bhai (Boghra) tells me that this in not only a first for Jasdan or Gujarat but for the country. I’m forever obliged and grateful to you,”\n\nKunvarji Bavaliya, BJP Cabinet Minister and Candidate,\n\nWhen The Quint approached Bavaliya to ask him about his strategy to win the elections, he flatly refused and said, “I am not talking to the media till the voting is done, please speak with our local BJP leader Bharat Boghra.”\n\nIncidentally, Dr Bharat Boghra who contested the 2017 election against Bavaliya for the Jasdan seat, is now managing the latter’s campaign for the by-polls.\n\n“For the first time since India’s independence, a MLA from this area got a cabinet berth, which the Gujarat government and BJP gave. People are excited as many issued pertaining to water, roads and health which was pending for many years, can now be solved through their MLA who is part of the Cabinet. It’s the first time people here will vote for a cabinet minister.”\n\nDr Bharat Boghra, BJP"
