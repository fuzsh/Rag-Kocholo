        "text": "The 20 December by-polls is crucial for Bavaliya who has won the Jasdan seat five times in a row, but on a Congress ticket; a loss could prove to be a massive jolt to Bavaliya’s political career. As for the Congress, the results will indicate if the party still has the backing of the numerically strong Koli community.\n\nThe Quint spoke with several residents of Jasdan Taluka who voiced a mixed response to the By-Polls.\n\nAt a sabha organised in Amrapura village by the BJP, local resident Shambhu Dabhi told The Quint, “As long as Bavaliya is on the ballot, it doesn’t matter which political party he joins. Jasdan is his fortress and for years he has helped the poor farmers here.”\n\nThe BJP is desperate to clinch Jasdan and believes that Bavaliya will bag the seat for the party, thereby raising their numbers in Assembly.\n\nAt a sabha held at the local BJP office in Shivrajpur village in the outskirts of Jasdan Taluka, Bavaliya thanked the BJP leadership.\n\nAfter sweeping three states in the recently concluded Assembly elections, the Congress in Gujarat is raring to take on the BJP at Jasdan. The party wants to end Bavaliya’s five-term reign in Jasdan and have fielded Koli community strong man Avchar Nakia to take on Bavaliya.\n\nAccording to Nakia, the seat has always been a Congress bastion, and his victory will solidify the Congress control on Jasdan once and for all sans Bavaliya. Both leaders belong to the Koli Community who form 35 percent of the voter base in Jasdan.\n\n“BJP Candidate is from the Koli community and so am I. In every election we get 3,000-4,000 plus Koli votes meanwhile the Patel community votes come in less numbers. That is because Patels live in the city while we Kolis are not crorepatis to live in the city,” he said."
