        "text": "The stakes are high for the ruling BJP in Gujarat as state Cabinet Minister Kunvarji Bavaliya takes on Congress candidate Avsar Nakia in the bypoll for Jasdan assembly constituency on Thursday.\n\nThe bypoll was necessitated after Bavaliya, who was the sitting MLA for Jasdan, quit the Congress and joined the BJP earlier this year. On joining the BJP, Bavaliya was immediately given a cabinet berth.\n\nIn the 2017 Gujarat assembly election, Bavaliya had defeated the BJP candidate by a margin of over 10,000 votes. The Congress had been winning Jasdan, which falls in Rajkot district, for the last few assembly elections, with the exception being a bypoll in 2009 that the BJP won.\n\nThe Jasdan bypoll comes at a time when the Congress camp is upbeat after forming governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.\n\nThe Jasdan bypoll is not only a test for Bavaliya, who had claimed that he would win comfortably, but is also a litmus test for Chief Minister Vijay Rupani whose performance could be questioned by the central BJP leadership, should the party lose the crucial contest.\n\nOn its part, the BJP has left no stone unturned in the campaigning in Jasdan. Central ministers from Gujarat and Gujarat state ministers have been doing rounds of the constituency and holding meetings and rallies. In fact, Gujarat state ministers have skipped attending to official duties to be in the battleground in Jasdan.\n\nRupani has not campaigned for Bavaliya, but his wife Anjali has. Rupani's wife said she was campaigning as a BJP worker and not as the chief minister's wife.\n\nThe 'desperation' of the BJP can be gauged from the fact that on Tuesday, the day when campaigning in Jasdan drew to a close, the state government announced a waiver of Rs 625 crore in electricity bills of approximately 6.2 lakh defaulting farmers. The government also announced that the farmers would get new electricity connections by paying only Rs 500.\n\nMoreover, the government announced the construction of a branch of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Rajkot.\n\nBoth the moves, however, invited Election Commission notices for possible violation of the Model Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Congress was quick to describe the BJP government's move as a pre-poll 'lollipop'.\n\nThe Jasdan bypoll is also important for the BJP as it had barely managed to retain power in the 2017 assembly election, winning 99 out of 182 assembly seats. The result can also be a possible indicator of the BJP's election management skills, especially when the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are only a few months away.\n\nIn the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had won all the 26 seats in Gujarat. This time, however, a repeat appears unlikely.\n\nBoth the candidates in Jasdan are from the Koli community that has over 70,000 voters in the constituency. The constituency also has nearly 50,000 Patel voters, followed by a smaller population of dalit voters.\n\nBJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya expressed confidence that Bavaliya would win on the grounds of works undertaken by him after becoming a minister. According to Pandya, the BJP also has the benefit of the party's superior microlevel booth management skills.\n\nThe Congress, too, exuded confidence of winning in Jasdan. State Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said that the local residents of Jasdan were upset over Bavaliya resigning from the party. According to him, the Congress had also extensively campaigned about the recent leak of question papers used in the examination to recruit police constables. According to sources, some 2,800 people from the area were to appear in the examination, which was cancelled.\n\nThe Congress also campaigned extensively over the lack of insurance coverage for farmers.\n\nCounting for the Jasdan bypoll will be held on December 23."
