        "text": "THE 4 Ds\n\nDEVIANCE, DYSFUNCTION, DISTRESS & DANGER\n\nDEVIANCE\n\nThese are behaviours and emotions that are viewed as unacceptable.\n\nThis leads to a question of whether deviance should be measured statistically (in terms of its rareness) or socially/culturally (in terms of social norms).\n\nStatistical Definition of Deviance\n\nOne way of deciding whether behaviour is deviant is to consider how unusual it is. Behaviour is seen as normal if it occurs frequently but behaviour that occurs relatively rarely in the population is abnormal. Extremely rare people can be considered deviant.\n\nSome behaviours can be measured on a quantitative scale; for example how extraversion levels can be measured by psychometric tests. At one end of the scale, there are the extreme extraverts who crave thrills and attention; at the other end of the scale are the introverts who are painfully shy.\n\nOn a normal distribution curve, the majority of scores for a population will cluster around the mean. Any behaviour within the middle 68% of the population is seen as normal.\n\nStandard deviation around the mean\n\nThis uses the idea of statistical deviation (SD). Normal people are within 1SD of the mean, falling within the 34.1% on either side in terms of their IQ, income, height, weight, age, level of extraversion, etc. \"Odd\" people are further from the mean - 2SD means in the 13.6% on either side of the normal people, so unusually clever or stupid, rich or poor, big or small, outgoing or shy. Truly abnormal people are in the 2.1% at the top or bottom of the scale: geniuses or dimwits, billionaires or beggars, giants or dwarfs, party animals or super-nerds.\n\nThis has the great advantage of defining abnormality (and therefore deviance) in objective, mathematical terms. The problem is, it ignores how we feel about abnormality. Some things are very rare, but quite harmless and even rather precious. Other things are quite common but we still disapprove of them.\n\nMoreover, some mental disorders are actually quite common and getting more frequent. According to Wittchen et al. (2011), every year 165 million Europeans - 38.2% of Europe's population - suffer some form of mental illness, with the top 3 being anxiety, insomnia and depression.\n\nSocial Norms Definition of Deviance\n\nA social norm is an unwritten rule about acceptable behaviour. Norms are therefore the behaviours and attitudes that most people stick to in society. Norms can differ from culture to culture, and from time period to time period.\n\nWhen people violate social norms, this is seen as abnormal. Most abnormal behaviour is harmless and abnormal people are treated as eccentric, or rebellious, rather than deviant. However, extremely abnormal behaviour conflicts with the values shared by the whole of society; people feel anxious or threatened by the person who is deviant.\n\nThere are a number of factors to take into account when assessing deviance based on social norms:\n\nThis has the great advantage of defining abnormality (and therefore deviance) in terms of popular feelings and moral values - it is behaviour that frightens or outrages other people. However, it's a rather subjective assessment. There's a risk that the therapist will be influenced by whether they personally find behaviour shocking or upsetting, rather than be what society-at-large feels. It can be difficult to find out what social norms in general are. On many topics, society is quite divided about what should be viewed as normal.\n\nDYSFUNCTION\n\nThis is when the abnormal behaviour is significantly interfering with everyday tasks and living your life.\n\nUnder this definition, a person is considered abnormal if they are unable to cope with the demands of everyday life - looking after yourself, holding down a job, maintaining relationships with friends and family, making yourself understood etc.\n\nRosenhan & Seligman (1989) suggest the characteristics that define failure to function adequately:\n\nUnpredictably & loss of control (no one knows what you'll do next, not even you)\n\nIrrationality/incomprehensibility (no one understands you, you don't even understand yourself)\n\nCause discomfort to observers (you upset, frighten or annoy everyone with your behaviour)\n\nSuffering (the same as distress, below)\n\nMaladaptiveness (you are a risk to yourself and others; see danger below)\n\nVividness & unconventionality (you stand out; see deviance above)\n\nViolate moral standards (similar to deviance)\n\nDysfunction gets across the idea of a behaviour getting in the way of living a healthy life (which the statistical definition of deviance ignores) but it's a bit more objective than appealing to social norms. For example, even if a person's sexuality is unusual or shocking to other people, if they can still lead a healthy life then they're not abnormal.\n\nA problem with this is that abnormal behavior may actually be helpful for the individual. For example, taking drugs might help people with stressful jobs or help artists unlock their creativity. In fact, there might be some social groups where not taking drugs is dysfunctional behaviour.\n\nI say \"might\". They also might kill you. Look at Kurt Cobain! Don't take drugs.\n\nAlso, many people engage in behavior that is unhealthy, but we donâ€™t class them as abnormal: adrenaline sports, smoking, drinking alcohol and driving too fast.\n\nDISTRESS\n\nThis is the simple view that abnormality involves being unhappy: experiencing negative feelings like anxiety, isolation, confusion and fear.\n\nThis has the advantage of connecting abnormality to quality of life, the same as dysfunction (above). You may have odd behaviours like keeping 100 cats in your house, but if it makes you happy, who cares? On the other hand, a phobia of cats is a trivial thing - unless it prevents you from going outside for fear that you will meet one, in which case it is clearly distressing you and must be treated.\n\nA problem with this is that judging distress is quite subjective. It is perfectly normal to be distressed in some situations. After all, who's to say how long you should grieve for after the death of a loved one or the breakup of a relationship? Some people get very distressed about global warming or animal welfare: is that abnormal?\n\nDANGER\n\nThis is when the behaviour harms, or put at risk, the individual or others around them.\n\nThis is based on the harm principle, which states that you have a right to behave in any way you like so long as you don't cause harm.\n\nObviously, there are some things everybody does that can be harmful (like driving a car), but abnormal behaviour puts yourself or other people at excessive risk (like driving a car while drunk).\n\nThis is similar to the principle of distress, because it takes a liberal view that people should be left to their own devices if their behaviour is harmless - as opposed to the deviance and dysfunction principles\n\nRevise With Rachie has some great videos on A-Level Psychology. Rachie doesn't address the four Ds here but she does describe different ways of defining abnormality\n\nAPPLYING DIAGNOSES TO REAL LIFE\n\nAO2\n\nMental disorders are classified into groups of symptoms. Diagnosis is the process of deciding what (if any) mental disorder a person is suffering based on their symptoms.\n\nIn order to provide effective treatment of a disorder, the condition needs to be accurately diagnosed. Diagnosis depends on a comprehensive classification system of all possible abnormal conditions and their symptoms. In this course, you will study two of the main classification systems used in clinical psychology: the Diagnostic & Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Disorders (ICD).\n\nFALSE POSITIVES & FALSE NEGATIVES\n\nA serious problem with the application of diagnosis is false diagnosis. These false into two types:\n\nWhen diagnosing schizophrenia using DSM-5, clinicians will look for delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, and other symptoms that show dysfunction. The client must have TWO of these symptoms for a valid diagnosis. In previous editions of DSM, only one symptom was necessary so long as it was \"bizarre\". So DSM-5 has made False Positives less likely but may have caused False Negatives.\n\nCULTURAL PROBLEMS IN DIAGNOSIS\n\nPsychology is a very Western discipline and psychiatry (the medical study of mental disorders) is very Western in outlook, based on the experiences of doctors and patients in Europe and North America. The DSM is an American diagnositic manual and its influence is huge.\n\nIncreasingly, psychiatrists have to diagnose mental disorders in patients from non-Western backgrounds. This might be because Western healthcare is being introduced to non-Western countries (Asia, Africa, South America) or because ethnic minorities in Western countries need mental healthcare.\n\nThis matters for several reasons:\n\nDisorders, classifications and symptoms that are recognised by Western psychiatry become \"official\" mental disorders and attract research which develops treatments; \"unofficial\" mental disorders are considered to be folk illnesses and are not taken seriously. This can lead to false negative diagnosis.\n\nPeople from other cultures presenting their symptoms to a Western doctor may express themselves in unfamiliar ways. For example, among African-Caribbeans it is not abnormal to talk to dead relatives while grieving. This can lead to them being diagnosed with a much more severe disorder than they really have (such as schizophrenia rather than mild depression) - a false positive diagnosis.\n\n'MEDICALISING' NORMAL EXPERIENCES\n\nRelated to False Positives is the concern that clinical psychologists are 'medicalising' normal experiences like sadness, anger, laziness and bad habits. This means that feelings that used to be seen as normal parts of life and behaviours that used to be viewed as down to willpower and conscience are now seen as medical problems instead.\n\nLisa Appignanesi (2008) argues there are a number of reasons for this:\n\nWe trust doctors and accept a medical diagnosis more than people in the past did\n\nDoctors want to help and believe that, if our problems are medical in nature, then they can be treated\n\nWe are lazy and believe that, if our problems are medical in nature, it's up to doctors to fix them, not us to change or improve\n\nCompanies that make medicines ('Big Pharma') want to sell us their cures. even if the medical problem doesn't really exist\n\nThe latest edition of DSM has been criticised for this, because it contains a lot of \"new\" mental disorders that include shyness and loneliness as well as unhappiness over bereavement.\n\nCritics like psychiatrist Nick Craddock argue that if people believe they have a mental illness when in fact they are going through a normal experience, this does more harm than good.\n\nSomebody who is bereaved might need help and even counselling, but they did not need a label saying they had a mental illness - Nick Craddock\n\nSome clinical psychologists defend this trend. They argue that, by medicalising problems, we focus on treatment rather than blame. Medicalising problems also removes a lot of stigma from behaviours that people used to be ashamed of and keep secret, making it more likely they will come forward and seek help."
