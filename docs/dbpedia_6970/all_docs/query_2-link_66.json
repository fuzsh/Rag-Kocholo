        "text": "By way of Introduction\n\nWhen reflecting on my initial search for ‘the family’ within the horror genre, I was convinced that my path would begin with Hitchcock, overlooking early\n\nhorror. However, two elements changed this; firstly the work of Professor\n\nTony Williams, author of ‘Hearths of Darkness’, a seminal resource for this\n\nessay and, secondly, the film Night Of the Hunter (1955) which is explored later.\n\nMy rationale is as follows: how could Charles Laughton, (director of Night of\n\nthe Hunter), have perceived such a dysfunctional family state, five years\n\nprior to Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960)? Thus the earlier horror movement,\n\nincluding Gothic noir, begs investigation first, and this will form the content of the first section of this eassy.\n\nLater on, I will embark on a journey to investigate how the American Family has progressed through the movement of the horror genre of American, spanning the 50's through to the present day (Well almost present). I have used a diagram to plan my journey. The diagram was my initial exploded thought process of how such directors, through their films, charted and reflected the patriarchal decline.\n\nThe diagram will form the foundation for my argument, but and will allow me to focus my study on key works, illustrating the many layers governing family tensions through era, social change and feminism. My aim for this study is to focus on and analyze pivotal films of the horror genre and to establish fundamental meanings about family: its unity, the roles within it and how it has progressed through the decades.\n\nWhere is the family in the American horror film and how does it function?\n\nMONSTER TO MOTHER\n\nThe Birth of Gothic Noir and the Dysfunctional Family\n\nThe 1930s saw the introduction of a horror movement, now remarked upon as the birth of the gothic noir and much imitated today. This is the work of\n\nUniversal Pictures. One man in particular, British born director James Whale, created a series of horror flicks based on renowned literary works,\n\nbeginning with Frankenstein in 1931 and ending with Bride of Frankenstein\n\nin 1935.\n\nWilliams suggests ‘the family’ is evident in early horror, from Frankenstein\n\nto The Wolfman. Revealing cracks begin to appear at the heart of the\n\ntraditional American family (Williams 1996).\n\nWe can see Frankenstein’s monster as the unloved child, and Dracula as\n\nsexual deviant, even the Wolfman victim.\n\nThey do not, however, seem to hold a link to the family, and we do not\n\nrecognize ourselves within them; nor is there a rationale for the patriarchal\n\nfamily unit in impending decline. Early horror remains focused on freaks\n\nand, as such, they fail to be able to act within the social norms and remain an external threat. We might argue that such a threat has no connection within our patriarchal law. Williams, in an interview with the author, argues:\n\n“Horror is always more interesting when it deals with relevant social\n\nissues rather than exclusively engaging in superficial special effects”\n\n(Williams interview 2006).\n\nReflecting on such work as Whale’s Frankenstein series, it may often be quite\n\ndifficult to perceive the horror. The work now resonates as soft horror. What\n\nis interesting is that the monsters here are like children, to allude to a family\n\nmetaphor. But are they really monsters or products of an emerging dysfunctional family, hidden behind unreadable codes of special effects and\n\nlavish theatrical designs?\n\nWilliams points out that the monsters of these early works are reactions of\n\nour own repressed urges to attack at the core of society; to lash out and break as many taboos as possible (Williams 1996). Horror has this as its defining motif. It is an ‘attacking’ genre. It works as subconscious streams to act out the desire of the id, as in Shakespeare’s The Tempest, realized in Forbidden Planet (1956). Such streams of unconsciousness play on a perverse spectator obsession, allowing for unchecked observations and truths to emerge. 1930's horror, and much of the communistic 50's Sci Fi that follow, is an attack on the family by an external force. This does not mean the family unit is sound, and in fact the attack or attraction of evil is a direct result from growing family tensions (Williams 1996).\n\nDracula (1931) and The Wolfman (1941) at once show an attack on the\n\ntraditional family, and the seeds of the dysfunctional within. Dracula of the\n\n30s undermines family traditions, instils bisexuality, and explores the loss of\n\nsocial values. The Wolfman remains the dysfunctional child, sexually\n\ndeviant, and operating outside the family unit. In later decades this\n\ncharacter evolves to become the child killer; we now know him as Jason,\n\nMichael, and ultimately Norman Bates, (as discussed later on).\n\nIt is not surprising that these monsters of the 30s are all of European origin\n\n(Bela Lugosi / Boris Karloff / Colin Clive). During this era America showed\n\nthe native American as isolationist, particularly through the medium of film\n\n(Williams 1996). Old Europe was seen as dead, decayed. This ‘decay’ was\n\none aspect of the ‘American Dream’, which was not to infiltrate the family\n\nvalues; ripe and fruitful in the new land. Even today, it can be argued that\n\nthe American film will almost always portray evil as foreign. The baddies\n\nalways have English or European accents.\n\nA suitable example of this ‘decay’ is directly reflected in Werewolf of London\n\n(1935), and later parodied in John Landis’s American Werewolf in London\n\n(1981). Both show the effect of the old world infecting the new. Landis\n\neffectively and violently reminds us of this within a dream sequence in\n\nAmerican Werewolf in London, wherein Nazi dressed monster killers break\n\nin to the hero’s American family home, and graphically gun down the entire\n\nfamily, before slicing his throat. David, the werewolf in transition, trapped in\n\nLondon, is now part of the old world, infected with repressed traditions\n\nstamped out by the new world, thus he is unable to return to America, just as the notion of ‘dysfunction family’ has no place in US society.\n\nMary Shelly’s Monster Mother..\n\n“Both monsters and women threaten the male order of things, in a sense of\n\nsocial reproduction. This is highlighted more in very early work of the 1930\n\nhorrors. The fact being that, although these films have a far less encrypted\n\nsense of family, they do suggest an attack on reproduction… the monster not being able to do this.” (Williams, Linda, 1984).\n\nThis quote disavows the monster as male. Sexuality is a mainstay of\n\nrepressed dysfunctional family fear, especially with regard to the role of\n\nwomen. It is therefore, perhaps, evidence of the male gaze2, for the first time, depicting the female role threatening the patriarchal order within the family structure.\n\nWhat is evident in the readings of the 30s Universal series, particularly\n\nFrankenstein, is an undercurrent of feminism. Shelly herself lashed out as a\n\nresponse to her Mother’s own desire for feminism, simultaneously neglecting\n\nher as a parent (Williams 1996). Both elements are later brought to light in\n\nthe work of Hitchcock. Looking back at the diagram of ‘The Horror Family trajectory flowchart’, we can begin to see how the family and feminism are linked and ultimately seen as ‘monster’.\n\nNB: In feminist film criticism, this term usually refers to the predominantly male gaze of Hollywood cinema, which tends to objectify women. Feminist critics examine carefully the ways that camera angles and film editing tends to focalize women as objects perceived by voyeuristic men. The term is influenced by both Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis.\n\nMary Shelly’s resistance to the ideal of the woman’s role within the\n\npatriarchal order and her new found feministic values are seen as\n\ndysfunctional within the family paradigm and ultimately causing destruction\n\nof the family unit, especially for the child. “Victor creates a being, but in\n\ndoing so, he discovers he is neither God nor Adam but Eve, author of a\n\nmonster”. (Williams 1996).\n\nWilliams concludes with the notion that the story of Frankenstein is Shelly’s\n\nfemale rage within the confines of her gender role in the family unit.\n\nThen one might ponder why:\n\nThe woman’s body, specifically her genitals, causes an exile from\n\nhappiness suggests she is the conduit of sin and death. Woman’s\n\nsexuality is inscribed in an impossible, self-contradictory\n\nposition: it is at once the earthly garden of sexual delights and\n\nthe forbidden pleasure that, once tasted, exiles man from\n\nheavenly bliss… (www.radford.edu/~mpbaker/bodyart.html;\n\n(1991)\n\nThis notion is a detour, but it is interesting to take the paragraph and the\n\nideals of Eve, and put them into context within this chapter. Women, it says,\n\nare evil, and prevent man from access to Eden. As with Freud and his\n\nconstant search to identify the penis of the woman, the female remains the\n\ngateway to Eden and an instrument, through pleasure, to hell.\n\nMary Shelly’s Frankenstein features the broken child, and his creator is the\n\nabandoning father.\n\nSubtexts of feminism are apparent, as stated\n\nby Collings (1992); Victor gives birth to the monster, for example, but remains male. The\n\nMother, not seen in the 1931 film version, has far more hold over Victor in Shelly’s text.\n\nShelly allows distinctive abandonment traits to be identified in the original work, as Victor loses his Mother while at university, and subsequently looks to resurrect her thereafter.\n\nWith Bride of Frankenstein (1935) the gender of the monster does not serve\n\nto attack feministic virtues as subversively as is demonstrated within\n\nShelly’s original text. The female monster in Bride of…. may be regarded as an attempt to ‘fix’ the family unification, the bride being mother and wife.\n\nPsychoanalysis emerging from Frankenstein…\n\nFreud and Lancan are constantly looking to align the ‘phallus’ jealousy of the\n\nfemale to the male law. It could be read that the male is often jealous of the\n\nfemale for exactly the reasons that the character of Victor wishes to create\n\nlife; men are unable to create life and, as such, remain incomplete. This also\n\naligns the son’s undeniable attachment to the mother, based on his\n\nadmiration for her ability to give birth. This allows for a direct association\n\nwith man’s underlying fear of female assertiveness, rendering the patriarchal\n\nlaw void (Collings, 1992).\n\nIt has been suggested that violence towards promiscuous women is\n\npleasantly experienced by men, because it eases their anxieties about\n\nwomen’s increasing assertiveness (Weaver and Tamborini, 1996).\n\nVictor assumes the role of female, jeopardising his own marriage and ability\n\nto maintain the father figure to his own child, resulting in the child becoming the ‘monster’, a state of social and family breakdown. Hitchcock also explores the gender conflicts of man and woman, addressing a rationale for the fundamental psychotic dysfunction of ‘sons’ spawned from ‘fatherless’\n\nfamilies (addressed later in the essay).\n\nWomen know your place and stay at home. Dead.\n\nRussian born Hollywood producer Val Lewton created a string of low budget\n\nhorror movies under RKO Studios, spanning the early 40's. Lewton’s key\n\nwork represents an underlining parallel in horror as sublime warnings of\n\ngrowing tensions in the traditional family unit. Expanding on the pictures of\n\nnoted director James Whale, Lewton’s string of features begins with Cat\n\nPeople in 1942, I walked with a Zombie (1943) and Curse of the Cat People\n\n(1944). (Williams, 1996)\n\nThe premise of I walked with a Zombie is of a female zombie, not decayed but beautiful. She has had to surrender her identity to satisfy male assertions, seeming to reinforce the idealistic male view of the role of the woman in the patriarchal family unit.\n\nLewton’s film openly shows the main protagonist as obedient slave and\n\nmother. As with Romero’s zombies (discussed in chapter three), Lewton\n\nplays with the motif of ‘zombie’, allowing the male a sexually charged\n\nassurance that their place in the family unit is one of total control, as long as\n\nthe woman is submissive (Williams, 1996). Thus the family unit prevails,\n\nhappy and content within the administration of how the all-American\n\ntraditional family should be… but the mother is a zombie… one might argue\n\nthat the only way the family unit avoids its tensions in horror is to render the female role as muted, or that we are punishing the mother for her\n\nassertiveness, aware that such actions threaten the patriarchal law, and\n\nrender our children as social outcasts.\n\nNight Of the Hunter — The Lost Father and Patriarchal\n\nLaw as Monster\n\nCharles Laughton’s 1955 noir, Night of the Hunter, remains a ‘missed’ work\n\namong many horror writings. This work is briefly highlighted for two\n\nreasons. Firstly it launches into an unprecedented attack on the role of the\n\n‘Father‘ within the horror genre and opens up the possibility of the monster\n\nwithin the family, as opposed to the external enemy of early horror. The\n\nsecond reason is that it raises the issue of the ‘Mother’ and the child. Night\n\nof the Hunter sets a clear distinction; the Father’s Law is financially bound to\n\nallow the family unit to remain functional, (due to social economical climate).\n\nThe Father is forced to pursue a life of crime. In horror, the ‘father’, as we will see in later chapters, is often removed from the formula, thus systemically enabling a dysfunctional family order to emerge. In Night of the Hunter the Father is replaced with a new figure, literally a ‘Preacher’ of both family and God.\n\nRobert Mitchem plays ‘Harry Powell’, a convict freed from prison, where he\n\nserved with fellow cell mate Ben Harper, our central Father figure. Ben has\n\nsecretly hidden money stolen from a bank heist in a rag doll belonging to his\n\ndaughter, Ruby. Powell, hearing Ben’s secret, as he sleep talks, visits the\n\nHarper family and, disguised as preacher-man, enters the family unit. The\n\nmother, under his religious gaze, is forced to repent for her ‘wicked’ ways\n\n(being a single mother and living in sin). The Preacher’s main intent is to\n\nseek out the money, hidden unknowingly, to him, in Ruby’s rag doll. (Night of the Hunter, 1955).\n\nThe film plots Powell’s wolf-like pursuit of the money as he forces the\n\nchildren to adhere to the Father’s law, as the Mother must obey and maintain traditional virtues in sight of “the Lord’s” gaze. Powell blames the mother for her son’s rebellion, killing her in a bedroom scene lit to resemble a church altar. The son takes charge over the younger sister, as they venture downstream, empowering the child’s escape from traditional decay.\n\nA ‘Grandmother’ figure is introduced, who acts as the archetypical ‘mother’ to the children, to replace their own and protects them from the wolf preacher.\n\nThe end sequence of the preacher’s arrest reflects the opening capture of the\n\nfather, and the son brutally witnesses both scenes. He cries for both men,\n\nequally. The son cries for his ‘father’, not wishing to have him removed from\n\nthe family unit. Ultimately he is agonising the loss of his developing\n\nmasculinity, alignment with the ‘father’, and the inability to ‘play-out’ the\n\nOedipal path to manhood. This particular theme comes to fruition with\n\nHitchcock and is discussed in more detail later in this essay.\n\nWilliams (1996) suggests that the father, through failure to maintain\n\nideological aspirations of capitalist achievements in the work place, can\n\ncreate a situation wherein he is monster — sexually and violently dominating\n\nthe family. The mother remains passive at this stage, and even turns away\n\nfrom the father, to allow the child to be abused. This creates a loop as the\n\nchild will grow up to become a victimiser.\n\nTo conclude, it is fitting to reflect that both Lewton and Laughton paved a\n\nway for Hitchcock. Although it was Universal, and James Whale whom gave\n\nrise to the one single and impossibly important fact that emerged: horror has far more resonance to reflect true family tension under the guise of perverse spectacle, than any other genre in film. These themes are, arguably, central to the work of one of the most influential horror directors of all time.\n\nHITCHCOCK’S HORROR FROM WITHIN\n\nAlfred Hitchcock is renowned as arguably one of the greatest American directors of the 20th century. For the purpose of this dissertation, reference will be made to his later work within the Hollywood system. Born in London in 1899, Hitchcock became famed for his blend of suspense and mastery of camera and editing. With a repertoire of over 60 films, we will explore his most commercially successful work.\n\nWith Hitchcock came a new horror, the horror of the real. Night of the\n\nHunter, (1955), has shown how monsters may be far more than external\n\nforces, powered by the uncanny or carnations of old myths to haunt the fabric of modern ‘clean’ America. The 30s horror, with a few examples, realised their monsters as inhuman, with no bond to the family. Such external influences allowed secretive nuances to emerge, exposing potential cracks in the family unit, coded and safe behind the gloss of special effects, make up and set design.\n\nThere emerges with Psycho clear, unmasked images of the family. Where\n\nNight of the Hunter positions the truth inherent within the family struggle,\n\nunder the fairytale of the wolf and red riding hood, Psycho uses no such\n\ndistractions, and immerses the audience in a world both current and\n\nreflective. One might argue that Hitchcock frees his films from past\n\nconstraints and allows horror to begin to suggest our fears more internally.\n\nHe, at once, invents many of the motifs of the later horror movement, and\n\nopens up the way for modern horror, as one of our own making and\n\ndestruction. It is now ‘us’ as the central force of destruction, not a wolf, a bat, a hulking mass, but, rather a son, a mother. This is Hitchcock’s world of\n\npsychoanalytical terror.\n\nDon’t you love me Mummy? A look at Psycho..\n\nHitchcock remarks, “I always believe in the following advice\n\nfrom the playwright ‘Sardou’. He said ‘ torture the women!’. The\n\ntrouble today is that we don’t torture women enough. (Wood\n\n1989).\n\nIt is sometimes difficult to comprehend just how many levels Hitchcock’s\n\nwork operates on. This is due to the sheer volume of mimicking and homage\n\nothers have paid to his films, seen far more regularly in modern cinema.\n\nIn Psycho we are introduced to Marion in a bedroom, after a long track across a city skyline. Marion allows us to identify with rifts in the harmony of a traditional family unit; she is clearly not married, but is entangled with a married man. Marion at once reflects the fears hinted upon in earlier horror (as discussed earlier), warning of the loss of the mother and the spiralling fear of the father’s patriarchal law.\n\nThe mother’s role in the family becomes increasingly assertive and independent with Hitchcock, taking her beyond the confines of family; this\n\nobscures the ‘right’ path for the social role model of her gender, and reflects\n\nthe feminist within.\n\nShe breaks the taboo of sex, and thus no longer has roots in the ideals of the American ‘traditional’ family. The horror\n\nfilm, at this point, introduces its most powerful ‘male’ assertion — the killer. (Clover, 1992).\n\nWhereas 30's soft horror males, including Dracula and Frankenstein’s monster remain external and ‘old’ remnants of a decaying past, Harry Powell’s Night of the Hunter figure has also become outdated in the liberated air of the 60's. A new, subtler male figure emerges for this decade; a figure that is free of patriarchal confines, and obedient to the mother, through his assured desire for her, as defined in Freud’s law.\n\nHe is the Son, the new ‘Frankenstein’ created as both destructor and liberator born out of the dysfunctional with the purpose of restoring the family motif.\n\nHichcock’s horror is unhidden and strikes at the heart of the family, at the\n\nfocus point of the trinity of the mother, father and child and, to that end, it\n\ncan be argued that Psycho’s Norman Bates is the single most effective\n\nmechanism within the horror movement as it is seen today. Hitchcock makes no attempt to deny his central character of Psycho the ability to rise above his Oedipal destruction. Norman, clearly the child of a powerful woman, and an apparent ‘absent father’, reflects the plight of child; should the traditional family gender barriers be breached.\n\nThis highlights the cause and result of such family breakdown possibilities,\n\nby placing Marion as a potential dysfunctional Mother, and Norman as her\n\n‘child’.\n\nAmong those individuals who do not progress properly into the genital phase, the Oedipus Complex, according to Freud, can still be playing out its psychdrama in various displaced, abnormal, and/or exaggerated ways.\n\n(www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0011376.html)\n\nThe ‘child’ destroys any threat to the family unit, at the same time\n\nattempting to emerge as a male in the patriarchal state. Thus Marion is both monster, as feminist, and victim as gender dictates. Norman is victim, as abandoned child, and killer as he is a man. Hence, on reflection, we can argue that Frankenstein’s monster and Norman Bates remain the same, especially within the unification of the role of child within a dysfunctional family (Clover 1992).\n\nIf we briefly compare Hitchcocks’s Psycho with Frankenstein, we may begin\n\nto see traits of Victor apparent in Norman Bates. The obvious conclusion is\n\nthat they both seek to become Mother (“you eat like a bird” says Norman to\n\nMarion — Psycho, 1960); and at once hold her responsible for not being able to align with their Father who is absent in both films. Psycho has other elements, which adhere to 30s horror. It is shot in Black and white, it has the motif of the ‘terrible place’, which is ‘typical of horror as it can act as “the dead weight of the past crushing the life of younger generation” (Wood 2002).\n\nThe way in which the film is shot can be seen as being crucial to the horror. Every scene has been meticulously designed, staged and lit. Hitchcock has quite considerably moved beyond the work of Whale and Lewton, but still allows the audience the reassurance that Night of the Hunter adheres to; the film language allows the viewer the comfort of a barrier between the real and the imagined. Therefore, it may be suggested that Hitchcock is playing safe.\n\nHe is showing the possibility of family breakdown, but the filmmaking\n\nreminds us that we are watching his work, and as such true identifications of\n\nfamily tensions are still somewhat coded.\n\nLaw of the Father — Breakdown of Psycho’s Families…\n\nBeneath any living skin lies the skull, the dead visage of the past, which\n\nconstantly associates death with life. (Williams, 1996).\n\nThe above statement may be viewed as entirely appropriate in light of the\n\nending of Psycho, as Hitchcock, using superimposition, shows Norman’s face\n\nand the skull of his smiling, dead mother. Thus we introduce a key element,\n\nnot only in the movie’s subtext, but in what seems to be an obsession of\n\nHitchcock in general — the domineering mother.\n\nWilliams suggests that Hitchcock depicts the family as a suffocating entity\n\nthat produces psychopathic killers. (Williams 1996). The relationships\n\nbetween the characters in Psycho indeed reveal tensions in the family unit.\n\nMarion and Norman are under the spell of a domineering mother. They are\n\ntherefore repressed, the reasoning behind each of their acts. Both are also\n\nlonging to be the mother, to maintain the family home. Marion tells Sam, her lover, how she wishes to make a home, and look after their daughter and\n\nNorman has become his mother. In doing so, he punishes Marion due to her\n\ninability to reach family status quo.\n\nBoth Sam and Cassidy, (Marion’s boss), also show signs of dysfunctional\n\nfamily traits. Sam cannot cope with his father’s death, (discussed at the\n\nbeginning of Psycho), revealing tensions within his own family unit, and the\n\npossible cause for his extra marital affair.\n\nCassidy has an overpowering presence over Marion, almost sexual, mirrored\n\nby his desire to please, but to ultimately control his daughter (this is\n\nmentioned as the account of Marion’s possession of the money she will\n\nsubsequently steal, and the need for Cassidy to have power over his daughter by giving her a house deposit).\n\nHitchcock identifies the mothers’ role in the family, and contrasts it with the\n\nfather’s patriarchal law, suggestive of sexual dominance and economical\n\npower. Sam wants to conform to the Patriarchal figure, yet he breaks marital\n\ntaboo. His father’s death is a haunting reminder of his duties within the\n\npatriarchal law, at odds with his desire for Marion. Marion, wishing to\n\nadhere to family norms, remains outside of her family unit, and becomes a\n\ndestructive influence on Sam, because she is unable to identify with her role\n\nas mother (Williams 1996).\n\nOne could argue that this allows us to sympathies with Norman, as he aligns\n\nMarion with his own mother as central force of evil, suggesting that she drove the father away, leaving Norman unable to develop masculine gender\n\nunification; ‘a boy’s best friend is his mother’ (Psycho 1960).\n\nWilliams (1996) points to the notion of ‘duality’ in Psycho, as a form of\n\nentrapment; the whole ensemble of characters are trapped inside their own\n\npersonal hells, Hitchcock repeatedly shows this in the use of mirrors, of\n\nwhich most of the cast will appear throughout the film.\n\nThe entrapment is a metaphor for family unification — they are unable to\n\nescape from the family traditional roles. Therefore, do we conclude that Marion is in fact the monster in Psycho, revealing that Norman is the result of psychosis, under the hand of a dominant mother? Author Barbara Creed, in The Monstrous-Feminine (1993) argues for this fact, suggesting that women in horror films are often not victims but monsters, thus necessitating a re-reading of key aspects of Freudian theory, particularly his theory of the Oedipus complex and castration crisis. (Creed, 1993).\n\nCreed suggests that woman as monster is a kickback from history. Women\n\nhave always been seen as the other, the unclean (due to the fact of bloody\n\nchildbirth and menstruation), and abject. This is also noted in the work of Freud, namely “The Medusa’s Head”. (Creed, 1993)\n\nDominating Mothers — Liberated Daughters and Killer Sons\n\nWe have established from both Frankenstein and Psycho the power of the\n\nmother’s relationship to the son. Such readings suggest the role of the\n\nmother as monster and of being able to create a monster.\n\nCollings states that, within Frankenstein, Victor cannot gaze upon any\n\nwoman without the thought of his dead mother. This appears to be reflected\n\nin Psycho, as Norman is unable to see beyond his mother, and like Victor,\n\ntakes on the female gender role, to allow the mother to remain alive\n\n(Collings, 1992)\n\nIt may be argued that the mother has an important role to play in the cinema of Hitchcock. Melanie Daniels, in The Birds (1963), displays a variety of fears, which may have been spurred on from her performance in front of and\n\nbehind the camera, to create one of the most vivid female characters on film. If we examine The Birds we can argue that the ‘Oedipus complex’ is clearly seen. Melanie Daniels, the child of an unloving mother, seeks the love of a father, transferred to Mitch who is her love interest. In doing so, she threatens his family unit; the clinging mother and her young daughter. As a subtext, the Mother might appear too old to be raising a young daughter, who treats Mitch as a father, thus alluding to an incestuous liaison between Mother and Son.\n\nMitch’s family unit seems complete. The problem is that Mitch is NOT the\n\nfather, but the son; the father is missing. Therefore Melanie is seen as the\n\nexternal force to upset the balance. She is the monster. Melanie has many of\n\nthe virtues of Marion, yet she has not stolen money, nor is she having an\n\naffair; her only crime is her independence. Wood (1989) suggests that the\n\nbirds act as an external force to re-unify the family and, it can be suggested,\n\nthat Hitchcock returns to the domain of the ‘uncanny’ once more. The bird\n\nattacks signify a general warning; they attack Melanie, but she can survive.\n\nThey attack the Brenner family, and they survive. When Mitch’s old flame, a\n\nlocal schoolteacher, is introduced, she is blinded and then killed by the birds.\n\nMelanie, although outcast initially by Mitch’s mother, is finally accepted to\n\ntake her place and allow the mother to let go of Mitch, aligning him as her\n\nson, not lover. The bird attack ends, as the family unit is restored. (Wood\n\n1989).\n\nMelanie here regains a mother, as the mother allows her son to grow up, and identify with his patriarchal role. Melanie is therefore reduced to child, no longer sexually independent, as the final bird scene depicts, placing her\n\nunder the powerful gaze of Mitch. He takes a masculine stance, protecting\n\nthe family from attack. The idea that ‘woman’ may survive attack if she adheres to the traditional norms is further explored later, within Carol Clover’s final girl theory.\n\nThe Birds, it can be argued, can be seen to single out the woman as monster,\n\nwhilst the man, the father, remains silent. It is the sense of abandonment\n\nthat may be seen to drive the woman to react. As society develops, the\n\nwoman as ‘liberated’ may allow for a more complex reading of later horror.\n\nBut the father in horror remains the same; either present or absent, the\n\nnature of which can be seen to determine the monster. The child, it can be\n\nargued, remains the central core of evil as a result of loss of father (until\n\naddressed and understood later in the 80's as gender roles begin to merge).\n\nIt is possible that the woman’s role sees the most significant development,\n\nand hence it is possible to chart the role of the woman and her effect on the\n\nfamily unit very distinctively in the horror genre of the 60's onwards, more so than the impact of the male role. Our ability to draw up a parallel between the family and the Oedipus complex to allow for the family unit to prevail is debatable. What is more interesting, we might find, is the fact that the directors are clearly pointing to the consequences.\n\nANGRY SONS AND ‘FINAL-GIRL’ DAUGHTERS\n\nNew Generation Horror\n\nAngry young men…\n\nIt can be argued that the 70's horror movement has become the pivotal point\n\nfor the genre, and creator of almost all of the motifs seen in the horror films\n\nof today. One can suggest that 70's horror pulls away from the boundaries set by the 30s universal series, and rests foundations on Hitchcock’s ideals,\n\ndeveloped in Psycho.\n\nThere appear to be two distinct streams emerging from the 70s horror genre:\n\nthe influence of the Vietnam War as a subtext to the material, and the\n\nintroduction of very different style of director, operating outside of the\n\ndeclining Hollywood structure. With it comes a new, ugly horror, depicting\n\nthe cruelty of human social breakdown, and the advent of the survival horror.\n\nWilliams calls this ‘defence of the family from violation’ (Williams 1996)\n\nWithin this chapter, we will focus on the work of three of the key directors of this period, with George A. Romero acting as a bridge from the late 60s to\n\nearly 70’s. One might clearly argue that America’s entire social order is ‘whacked’ out of line by the Vietnam War. American family traditions are severed, sons and fathers have been removed and emerge as socially controlled other-selves — a machine, which may look like us, but has a simple systemic order — ‘kill’ (Williams 1996).\n\nThis shockwave has a profound effect on the horror genre, and allows for the emergence of young directing talent who are film school graduates following the independent movement; disciples of Hitchcock, without the restrain of his cinematic virtues, they bring a vesicle brutality to the medium and introduce a new motif, the spectacle of special effects ‘Gore’.\n\nGeorge A. Romero never set out to become a Hollywood figure. However, by all indications, he was very successful. The director of the groundbreaking “Dead” trilogy, was born February 4, 1940, in New York City. He grew up in there until attending the renowned Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. (IMDB, 2006).\n\nWelcome Home Soldier\n\nNight Of the Living Dead (1968), marking Romero’s directing début, focuses\n\non three families. The story opens on Barbara and her bother Ben as they\n\nare seen visiting the grave of their father, while their mother stays at home.\n\nThe dialogue between the two suggests the father has been totally forgotten,\n\nand their visits have become a point of habit. This leads us to the house, the\n\n‘terrible place’, which will carry the rest of the narrative. The house has two\n\nother families holding refuge within it; a ‘traditional’ family of father, mother and injured daughter, (sick from a zombie bite), and a young couple.\n\nWe might argue that Romero has several layers at work here; he uses the\n\nidea of zombie to indicate a transitional state of the American soldiers’ return home from Vietnam. It may be as if America has been reduced to a zombie state, at once suggesting a waste of life reflective of the Vietnam War, as local townsfolk unashamedly shoot off rounds of bullets at the heads of the dead walkers.\n\n‘Night of the Living Dead understands what contemporary America and later\n\nHollywood productions attempt to avoid: the enemy is really US.’ (Williams\n\n1996).\n\nIn the context of the family, it may be possible to take each character set and\n\ntrace a direct attack on them from outside forces, namely the zombies, or to\n\ncombine them as a single dysfunctional family, reflecting a socially forced\n\nbreakdown. Romero keeps Ben distant (a ‘patriarchal’ distance as discussed\n\npreviously) and allows Barbara to emerge as independent.\n\nRomero is constantly adjusting the balance between the female characters\n\nand the growing domination of the male characters throughout the film. Ben\n\nand the other father figure Harry are aggressive, while Barbara and Helen,\n\nthe wife and mother remain submissive. Karen, the child of the ensemble,\n\nturns into a zombie denoting the result of such tensions. The child becomes\n\nevil, a social outcast, whose sole function now is to turn on social norms and\n\nattack.\n\nKaren, like Norman Bates before her, and Frankenstein’s Monster before that, reacts to the dysfunction with destruction. We are reminded that to move from the traditional patriarchal law results in breakdown, affecting the child most of all. Romero devises a method to platform all forms of breakdown, by the clever placement of each family unit, until they are systematically dispatched by the zombies.\n\nAs Barbara5 regains independence once more, she is killed, leaving Ben as\n\nthe sole survivor. Ben6, in the last moments of the film, is accidentally\n\nmurdered at the hand of a local farmer, thinking him a zombie. Thus we\n\ncome full circle. The father must also die within the context of this horror,\n\nhaving been unsuccessful in being able to align within his role of patriarchal\n\nlaw.\n\nOne can argue that Night of The Living Dead proves more interesting if you\n\nregard the Zombies, without the connotations of Vietnam, as children; they\n\nact as a warning by Romero, of dysfunction families breeding dysfunction\n\nchildren, intent upon destroying the social order. This is later seen in Wes\n\nCraven’s Last House on the Left (1972) and furthered in the 80's slasher\n\nmovement, also at the hand of Craven.\n\nIt is interesting to note, that the remake of ‘Night Of The Living Dead’ in 1990, at the hand of Romero’s special effects wiz Tom Savini, swaps the gender role of Barbara and Ben.\n\nAssault on the Family:\n\nGetting nasty beyond Hitchcock’s cinema\n\nWes was born in Cleveland in 1939. After an unhappy childhood (he was raised in a Baptist family) he left Cleveland to study for a degree in English Literature, at Wheaton College,\n\nIllinois. But after illness, he left the school for one year before returning to study psychology.\n\nIn 1963 he took a degree in writing and psychology and in 1964 he took a Masters from J. Hopkins University. (IMBD 2006).\n\nLike Romero, Craven’s first feature is both controversial and crudely crafted.\n\nRomero, maintaining certain motifs of horror, namely B&W and special\n\neffects, abandoned large sets and beautiful camera-work for documentary\n\nstyle film-making and unrecognisable actors. Craven, went one step further;\n\nhis contribution is almost homemovie, with a realistically brutal portrayal of\n\nhorror. Again the undertone is Vietnam, and the monsters are us, but we are\n\nnot dead this time. We are simply dysfunctional.\n\nLast House on the Left (1972) may have distinct advantages over Romero, in\n\nthe sense of how Craven converges the two family factions. We have the\n\nCollingwood household, normal, traditional and functional. They have a\n\ndaughter, Mari.\n\nWithin minutes of the opening scene Mari’s father remarks on her breasts,\n\nhaving noticed she is not wearing a bra, and in reply, Mari rejects the role of\n\nthe female within the patriarchal law, and confirming the male fear of\n\ngrowing female independence, mirroring Marion in Psycho. (Williams 1996)\n\nThe ‘other’ family is the Stillos — a band of outlaws on the run; at once the\n\nrepressed doubles of the Collingwood family and the echo of the dysfunctional society. We may argue that this is, as discussed on page 19, the broken American dream after Vietnam. Within the Stillos structure the father has lost his identification with his son, and the ‘mother’ role is left to teenager Sadie.\n\nLast House on the Left is a brutal film. The scenes of rape and torture\n\ncentral to the films narrative, which Mari and friend Phyllis are subjected to,\n\nmay be viewed as mirroring a real life execution.\n\nCraven can be seen as mimicking Vietnam, both visually and cerebrally.\n\nMari’s brutal killing also reminds us of the horror law, suggesting the greater\n\nthe female independence from the patriarchal norm, the greater the attack\n\n(Clover, 1992).\n\nCraven moves rapidly toward his goal, possibly affording one the ultimate\n\nrecognition; this brutality is us; we are only moments away from the violent,\n\nseminal nature we might fear. Thus the Stillos ‘family’, after their killing of\n\nMari and her friend, are seen to reflect on their acts, and show remorse for\n\nwhat they have done, releasing how far removed they are from the\n\nrespectable behavior of the traditional family.\n\nKrug Stillo: [to his son] Listen to daddy. I want you to take the gun, and I\n\nwant you to put it in your mouth, and I want you to turn around and blow\n\nyour brains out. Blow your brains out, BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT! (Last\n\nHouse on the Left, 1972).\n\nMore violence ensues as the Collingwoods stumble on the fate of their\n\ndaughter and meet the Stillos, who are looking for a place to stay. Thus\n\nbegins the transformation, as the Stillos become the victims of an attack that\n\nsees a penis ‘beaten off’, (Williams, 1996), and the brutal chainsaw wielding\n\nfrenzy of Mr Collingwood.\n\nOne might observe that the roles and unification of the family have burst like a bubble across the screen. The mother asserts her independence, directly castrating the patriarchal law, and the father unleashes his anger at the inevitable realisation that he no longer has it. The contrast of such polar\n\nopposites indicates just how far horror has come from the stable of Whale’s\n\nFrankenstein. One might suggest that Craven is shouting at us, shouting at\n\nthe traditional family.\n\nI think there is something about the “American Dream”, the sort of\n\nDisneyesque dream if you will of the beautifully trimmed front lawn, the\n\nwhite picket fence, mom and dad and their happy children, god fearing and\n\ndoing good whenever they can; that sort of expectation, and the flipside of it, the kind of anger and the sense of outrage that comes from discovering that that’s not the truth of the matter, I think that gives American horror films in some ways kind of an additional rage. (Craven, 2000).\n\nLast House on The left, it can be concluded, is not a film but, rather, a bold\n\nstatement. There appears to be no Hitchcock voice over explaining the killers twisted actions, no clever cuts, as the knife goes in. This appears to mark the beginning of a horror movement, unleashed and untamed, as if Psycho’s hidden meanings have been placed in colour, with bright red letters warning not the impending family breakdown, but announcing its arrival.\n\nEvil Sons — Surviving daughters…\n\nBefore becoming a filmmaker, Tobe Hooper, a native of Austin, Texas spent the 60s as a college teacher and documentary cameraman. He organized a small cast who were also college teachers and students and then he and ‘Kim Henkle’ made The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, (1974). IMDB, (2006).\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre (referred to hereafter as TCM) released in\n\n1974, is possibly the most significant entry of the 1970s horror movement\n\nbecause, states Williams in an interview with the author, “of its links with\n\nthe family horror film”.\n\nHooper, following the path laid down by Romero and Craven, (among others), comes at us with this low budget piece of ‘student’ filmmaking, reflecting at once the swing to ‘documentary style’ realism, and the reality of home movie quality cinematography. Perhaps only the quality of the editing reminds us that we are watching a feature film. TCM’s roots remain Hitchcock, and most of the motifs set by Psycho; appear to be evident; terrible place, girl in distress and family spurned killer son.\n\nClover (1992) argues that Hooper has also highlighted the contrast of\n\nAmerican ‘town’ family and ‘outback’ family. He has allowed a striking\n\ncontrast to be clearly seen between the venturing teenage city kids, in the\n\ndomain of the wild, backward mid America.\n\nAs with the horror of the 30s, where Europe brought to America death, decay and destruction in the form of monsters and vampires (see Chapter one), here the development of economy and mechanisation of the US appears to have brought about extinction of small town livelihood.\n\nAs a result they have become ‘uncivilised’, and reflect the struggle of native\n\nIndian vs ‘civilised’ America. (Williams 1996).\n\nThe film opens with teenagers aboard a camper, picking up a local hitchhiker. The hitchhiker, later to be revealed as a member of the Leatherface family, immediately sets a contrast by drawing out a knife and\n\nslashing one of the teenagers, after cutting his own hand, grinning with tombstone, buckled teeth. This brief meeting sets up the horror that will await the teenagers, as they are to be dispatched one by one. Of the five teenagers, it is Sally, our main protagonist, her disabled brother,\n\nFranklin, the hitchhiker and his brother Leatherface that represent most\n\nclearly the ‘family’ units within the film. Franklin and Leatherface both\n\ndepend on their ‘ trapped’ older sibling, within a dysfunctional patriarchal\n\nunit.\n\nThus we have two family unifications. The teenagers little collective group,\n\nin search of Sally and Franklin’s grandparents house, and the family of\n\nLeatherface, the chainsaw wielding killer as the central working son, rooted\n\nin a family that seems to echo ‘traditional’, much like Romero’s zombies\n\nattempt to mimic human behavior. The film’s most significant scene demonstrates the divide almost comically, as the only surviving girl, Sally, is brought to dinner to meet the family, and be their main course! One could argue that this acts as a satirical stab at family tradition, where we have the patriarchal law of the father held in place, as the son offers Grandfather the first attacking blow, as Sally is pinned in a chair made of human remains.\n\nThe Grandfather, now reduced to a zombie like state, reminds us that the\n\npatriarchal law is defunct, seemingly reflective of both the economical\n\nlandscape of mid America and the loss of male identity, post Vietnam War. It\n\nalso appears to be a constant in the horror film motif. The father is missing.\n\nHooper’s Leatherface family resembles the transitional family unit,\n\nsuggestive of the 50s idyllic, to the conclusion that the family is beginning to\n\ndecay. Although this family’s mother and father figures appear practically\n\nnon-existent, (the mother is never seen or mentioned), it might be argued\n\nthat the Grandfather and dead Grandmother act as catalysis’s to the\n\ntraditional. Their way of life allows them to remain functional.\n\nThe dead Grandmother remains a constant reminder to Hitchcock’s Psycho,\n\nin both homage and meaning, “You got a choice boy, sex or the saw; you\n\nnever know about sex, but the saw — saw is the family” (Texas Chainsaw\n\nmassacre 2, 1986). The film concludes with Sally’s tortured escape from the house, pursued by Leatherface, as she clambers onto the back of a passing truck, moments away from his whizzing blade; the final shot showing Leatherface swinging the chainsaw around himself in uncontrollable rage.\n\nSally’s escape allows us identification with the law of final girl, coined by\n\nCarol Clover in her 1992 publication, Men, Women and Chainsaws. TCM is\n\narguably the pivotal film to introduce our first final girl; why Sally is allowed\n\nto live could stem from the basic premise of the final girl state, detailed\n\nbelow; as far as to say that both Sally, awakening Leatherface’s sexual desire\n\nand Leatherface’s response, allow for their mutual survival. Clover (1992)\n\nsuggests that Sally initiates Leatherface to align with his masculine nature,\n\nthus introducing him to the notion of reproduction, and ultimately bringing\n\nhim away from the dysfunctional child to the function adult.\n\nCarol Clover focuses on the fact that the country family of outback America is incapable of having normal children; that parents in these locations create freak mutant offspring (Aka John Boorman’s Deliverance, 1972). Also the freaks tend to be males; Clover sights the male under such circumstances…\n\n…as childlike and having very little sexual awareness — once activated,\n\nmostly by a female, gain the ability to become ‘psychopathic’. It is evident\n\nthat the traditional American family not only rejects its European, unclean\n\nroots, but in itself, is limited to the governing states of power where only\n\nnormal families can live. (Clover, 1992)\n\nClover suggests that Norman Bates and the killers of TCM are so affiliated to\n\nfamily, being mother or grandmother that they remain children; not allowed\n\nto grow up. Thus when they are reminded of their maturity, by awaking\n\ntheir sexual adult desires, they are urged to eliminate the distraction, and\n\nmaintain the mother love object. Both the father figures in these films are\n\neither dysfunctional to the point of being sort of dead or really are dead.\n\nTCM has no mother figure, but a dead grandmother, as if the mother has\n\nalready been dispatched for creating such an evil enterprise. The father,\n\nwho should have brought balance to the family, has also been rendered\n\nzombie-like, reflecting economical decline. This allows the child to mature\n\noutside of a patriarchal or matriarchal law, and remain immature. The\n\ninvasion of final girl, representing a quasi-patriarchal symbol aimed at\n\nrestoring family unification, may be seen as a ‘rescue’ of the child from the\n\noverpowering mother’s grasp, allowing them to grow up and return to a\n\nsocially normal state (Clover 1992).\n\nThe emergence of final girl — The Independent Woman\n\nSex, in this Universe, proceeds from gender, not the other around. A figure\n\ndoes not cry and cower because she is a woman; she is a woman because she\n\ncries and cowers. And a figure is not a psychopathic killer because he is a\n\nman; he is a man because he is psychopathic killer. (Clover 1992).\n\nJohn Carpenter was born in Carthage, New York. His family moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where his father was the head of the music department at Western Kentucky University. He attended Western Kentucky\n\nUniversity and then USC film school in Los Angeles, not the University of South Carolina. While there, he made The Resurrection of Broncho Billy (1970) and started work on Dark Star (1974). (IMDB 2006).\n\nHalloween (1978), one might argue, is the most ‘watchable’ entry in this section; it not only seems to pay tribute to Hitchcock in form and structure, but also has a myriad of subtexts, like the name ‘Dr. Sam Loomis’, which appears to pay tribute to Psycho. It is also the first true recognition of Clover’s final girl theory, beyond the remit of surviving female, identified in Hooper’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. (See above).\n\nHalloween is often viewed as the key blueprint to the 80's formula slasher,\n\nsandwiched between Black Christmas, 1974, and Friday the 13th in 1980.\n\nHalloween, it may be suggested, marks the return of the crafted horror,\n\nreminiscent of Hitchcock, using the seamless edit and ‘point of view’ camera,\n\nusing a pioneering technique know as ‘steadicam’. Carpenter’s fellow\n\ndirectors’ ‘documentary style’ seems to have been abandoned and the\n\nVietnam scars (discussed earlier) seem to be healing.\n\nHalloween remains one of the most popular horror films of its time, perhaps\n\ndue to its accessibility, look and feel; thus affording it a wide audience range. It seems far more likely to sit on the shelf with Psycho, rather than our later entries, namely Last House on the left. What this may indicate is simply that Craven and Hooper’s attack is acknowledged, but ultimately abandoned by the greater audience, in favour of ‘safe’ viewing.\n\nClover (1992) focuses on how gender is portrayed within the horror genre,\n\nand although her final girl theory has been criticized by some (see Williams’\n\nviews later in this essay) , one might argue that the final girl status has a significant role, especially in the context of ‘family’. Carpenter quickly dispels the traditional family, warning of how growing tensions within the family, and social neglect of the patriarchal law will affect the child.\n\nHere, as with Hitchcock’s warning of the 60s (see Chapter two), we have the\n\nchild as avatar of the dysfunctional. The son becomes killer, as the daughter\n\nbecomes victim. (Clover 1992)\n\nApart from sub plots involving teen angst interplay, and the ‘weird scientist’\n\nthrow back of the 60s to explain the psychoanalytical reasoning of the killer’s urges, one might argue that Halloween focuses on a son and daughter struggle for family unification.\n\nHalloween, the 1978 version, opens with a ‘Point of View’ shot, (POV), as we investigate a suburban house on Halloween night; donning a mask our vision (the camera’s vision) is obscured as we see a teenage girl say goodbye to her boyfriend, we detour to the kitchen and grab a large knife. As we (through the camera) continue, we find the girl in her bedroom, semi naked by her dresser, and violently stab her again and again. We turn and run out to the front of the house. The camera jumps out of POV, and we are introduced to Michael Myers, as his parents unmask him, and reveal him to be just 7 years old.\n\nThe use of POV here, one might suggest, is that Carpenter is blaming us,\n\nforcing us to identify with our own fears of family breakdown.\n\nCarpenter, drawing from Hitchcock, understands the benefits of horror as a\n\ngenre of voyeuristic gaze (see Chapter Two) and like Michael Powell’s\n\nPeeping Tom (1960), the idea of the audience (male) gaze being directly\n\nlinked with character opens direct identification with viewer and motif.\n\nIn Halloween, Carpenter’s opening sequence seems to sets up the warning of\n\nPsycho, and then travels forward in time to show the result; as Michael\n\nMyers escapes from a mental institution to return to his hometown and his\n\n‘family’. Laurie, played by Jamie Lee Curtis (daughter of Janet Leigh),\n\nassumes the ‘new daughter’ symbol, and younger sister of Michael Myers,\n\nnow living with adopted parents and unaware of the incident years before (it is not until Halloween II (1981) that Laurie is actually defined as the sister\n\nof Michael Myers). The film plays out as routine dispatch killing until the end when we have Michael Myers and Laurie head to head. If Michael Myers is seen as a result of family dysfunctionality, then we may assume that Laurie, who unlike her school buddies holds more traditional morals, must be the correcting force to restore family unification. Laurie, unlike Marion in Psycho, maintains a traditional stance. She abstains from sex, she looks after the neighbour’s kids, and is a wholesome representation of American teenager. We are reminded of this fact by Carpenter’s constant showing of 50's sci fi movies as Laurie makes jacko lanterns with the children she is babysitting. She is demonstrating her role in the family, as mother and responsible daughter.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Halloween not only pays homage to Psycho but, more importantly, is paying attention to the family law. Janet Leigh’s daughter,\n\nJamie Lee Curtis, is saved from the killer by embracing the social and moral orders that are\n\nrejected by her mother’s character in Psycho. Michael\n\nMyers, Halloween’s killer son, is unable to kill Curtis as she upholds family tradition.\n\nMeanwhile her fellow classmates, indulging in sex and drugs and apparently\n\nnot conforming to the administration of the social agenda, are killed by\n\ndysfunction son Michael Myers. Clover (1992) argues that Michael’s total\n\ninability to kill Laurie stems from the fact that he is unable to wipe the\n\ntraditional value that America adheres to. Michael, like Leatherface before\n\nhim, and Norman Bates before that, contends with the fact that his own\n\nmasculinity is in question simply through the advent of not being able to\n\nfulfil the Oedipus right to manhood.\n\nIn certain ways, Michael, Jason, and Freddy represent father figures of the\n\ndark side. They embody adolescent fears against actual fathers or fulfill the\n\npunitive roles that weak fathers do not. (Williams interview with the writer,\n\n2006)\n\nThus these killers remain as children. At the end of Halloween we have\n\nLaurie being able to survive her attacker, but unable to kill him. She\n\nbecomes final girl at the point she realises she has the power to fight back\n\nagainst the aggressor (Clover, 1992). The Aggressor at this point, usually through an injury of some kind is also rendered weaker, de-masculinised, castrated. (Michael Myers is semi — blinded by Laurie).\n\nWilliams argues the notion of Clover’s final girl. His view, expressed in an\n\ninterview with the writer and more specifically in his book, is that the final\n\ngirl is later killed in the sequels.\n\nAlthough eighties heroines may appear more masculinised than their\n\npredecessors, the conservative ideological dimensions of this gender change\n\nneeds thorough investigation before we may safely regard it as progressive.\n\nThe heroines of Friday the 13 Part 2 (1981) and Friday the 13th Part III\n\n(1982) are alive at the end of the films but catatonic. In the former, Ginny\n\ntemporarily adopts Mrs. Voorhees’s authoritarian role to survive. (Williams\n\n1996)\n\nIn the context of ‘family’ as a social reflection, opposed to gender identification, the role of the woman remains under attack, unless she adopts the stance laid out within the patriarchal law, thus adhering to the\n\ntraditional family model.\n\nThe above would seem to expose the fact that Ginny is unable to remain\n\ntraditional, thus loses her final girl status within the horror motif. Clover’s\n\nfinal girl is a state, not a progression. The reasoning for the eventual lack of\n\nfinal girl, or in fact the introduction of final person, in the horror of today\n\nsimply unifies the fact that the traditional family is dead, adhering to the\n\npremise that however the patriarchal law suppresses the independent\n\nwoman, modern society dictates that the traditional model has no place in the modern society, it is simply outmoded. (The American Nightmare, 2000).\n\nFemales in Horror\n\nIn the beginning, Clover (1992) argues, women were ‘little red riding hood’\n\nwhere they needed to be rescued by the woodsman from the wolf (reflecting\n\n1930–50's ideals). Then they become independent, empowered ‘little red riding hood’ where the woman kills the wolf, knowing that the woodsman’s rescue will never happen (reflecting 1960's movement). Finally ‘little red riding hood’ tames the wolf to have intercourse with him and become a wolf herself, reflecting 1980's equality.\n\nClover highlights females as ‘open’, this coupled with weak, in reference to\n\nEve’s taking of the fruit and being condemned by man. By ‘Open’ Clover\n\nrefers to the fact of females are penetrable. Thus in demonic scenarios in\n\nhorror films it is often the female being entered, via the bath (A Nightmare\n\non Elmstreet, 1984) or from a branch of a tree (The Evil Dead, 1981), etc.\n\nThis questions the strength of the mother, and independence of the daughter, posing a threat to the family unit. The female is susceptible to evil, under the openness of her gender and the attraction this invites. (Clover, 1992).\n\nIn context to the horror film the woman maybe mapped as follows:\n\nMother — dominant, overpowering, protecting and revengeful. Voice: Stern\n\nand old.\n\nThe mother traits are usually connected with, or are a direct result of evil,\n\nthus the mother is linked with the failure of Eve, and is punished. In horror\n\nsuch punishment is at the hand of her child, either by her child directly or by her indirect manipulation of the child. (Collings 1992).\n\nDaughter — Dependant, accessible, menstrual, (Blood), usually adolescent or\n\na young woman. Voice: Quiet and soft.\n\nDaughters remain victims and are always graphically attacked; they will\n\nscream, trip or fall, and are often seen semi undressed or naked at one point\n\nin the narrative. (Clover 1992).\n\nVariant: Final Girl — (Daughter)\n\nFinal Girls are mostly youthful and, having been the victim, will:\n\nHave many of the Daughter traits at the beginning of the film. When she\n\nconfronts the monster she then loses mostly of the defining characteristics\n\nand progresses to final stage. There she gains survivor status, and becomes\n\nhero. She then possesses traits of mother, but ultimately hero, and thus is\n\nmasculinised. (Clover 1992)\n\nThe final girl may be read\n\nas a return of the mother.\n\nShe possesses strengths,\n\nwhich adhere to the evil\n\ntraits the mother inflicts.\n\nShe is therefore the cause\n\nand resolve of the family,\n\nseen in the above\n\nexamples of 70's horror.\n\nAs we continue through the 80's and 90's we see the full effect of final girl,\n\nable to drive her fate, feminise the monster and restore the family, Ripley\n\n(Sigourney Weaver) from the Alien series, (1979 onwards), being a prime example, and furthered in Joss Weldon’s Buffy the Vampire slayer TV series (1997).\n\nClover disagrees that feminism is the reasoning behind such work as Aliens\n\n(1984), she simply states when referring to Ripley, “She is simply an agreed upon fiction and the male viewer’s use of her as a vehicle for his on\n\nsadomasochistic fantasies an act of timeless dishonesty” (Clover 1992).\n\nFinal girl has a very defined connection with the male gaze, explaining the\n\nreasoning behind trying to de-clothe the final girl, or have her undress\n\ntoward the end of the narrative, aiding the male gaze to realign her as female and assure their patriarchal stance (Clover 1992).\n\nIn closing, the rage that bore an identifiable new movement, fizzles like a\n\nfirework, as both the patriarchal law governing the traditional family looks\n\nas final as final girl, and we march into a decade that salutes the end of such\n\ntradition in bold acknowledgement of the arrival of the dysfunctional.\n\nWHERE IS THE ‘FAMILY UNIT’ IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM?\n\nAnalysis of New World Horror — 1980'sReagan’s era saw an attempt to restore American family values, attacking feminism. But due to large-scale redundancy in heavy industry, men were left jobless, as female roles in society strengthened; cause — a uniform effect within the family unit, with divorce, abuse and teenage suicides. (Williams 1996)\n\nOne might suggest that the 80's marked a soothing period for the next generation of American independent director. Although born from the same stock as Hooper and Craven, it can be argued that seminal talent such as Brian De Palma and ‘superstar’ director Steven Spielberg seem to emerge as direct descendants of the Hitchcock legacy.\n\nNeither De Palma nor Spielberg may be regarded as horror directors, but\n\nmark notable work within the context of family. De Palma exercises the\n\ngender roles initiated by Hitchcock in such movies as Sisters (1973), Dressed\n\nto Kill (1980) and Body Double in 1984. Wood (2002) argues that De Palma’s clear focus was to explore the male gaze, by merging the dominant mother with the loss of father to create a feminised man; a surplus element of the rotting patriarchal law, and at once acknowledging the gender classification of the independent woman.\n\nNB: Wood, Robin The American Nightmare: Horror in the 1970s, in Mark\n\nJancovich (ed.), Horror: The Film Reader. London: Routledge, 2002\n\nJaws (1975) marks Spielberg’s timely arrival, although not strictly a horror\n\nfilm plays out as both a re-visit to The Birds, albeit a single external force.\n\nJaws has one other striking factor, it is a film the centers on the role of the\n\nfather. Spielberg plays out the loss of father through, one might argue, his\n\nmost pivotal directorship, moving the ‘family’ focus within horror into the sci-fi fantasy arena. We might suggest that the father state recognised as ‘lost’ has been ‘found’ as the band of 3 men stranded in a boat, out at sea. This film, one might argue, defines the 3 states of the patriarchal law, as Quint remains the old law, defiant and regulated in old traditions (a European character); Hooper is the son and surviving hope, post Vietnam, and Brody is the new man, displaying both male and female traits as he attempts to harmonies old with new. The result may be as expected; the old father is killed, the child, Hooper, is lost, only to emerge after the threat has gone (the threat of Vietnam and soldier returning home, as discussed earlier) and Brody as final girl, transposed to a feminised role, to dispel the external threat.\n\nThe Slasher rides high…\n\nJust when you thought it was safe to go back into the cinema, comes the\n\nlatest brand of horror, the slasher movie. This grosses huge ticket sales with\n\na formula based on the premise identified by Hitchcock and patented by\n\nCarpenter. While slashers have their place in the horror movement, it can be\n\nargued that they are quite ‘drab’ re-workings of the 50's teenage rebellion\n\nmovies. One might suggest that they owe more to mocking the horror motifs\n\nof the 70's rather than giving us an insight to cultural awareness of the actual horror movement. The family within these films, namely the Friday the 13th series (1980's onwards), and later the Scream series (1996 onwards) are non-existent. As Christopher Sharrett illustrates:\n\nHowever, the sub-genre has been critically derided, particularly for its\n\nrepresentation of women. Claims that slashers are misogynistic fantasies\n\nhave been made repeatedly, with many critics claiming that they are\n\n“explicitly about the destruction of women”. (Sharrett 1996)\n\nSharrett makes a valid point; although the male gaze remains defiant within\n\nthe initial premise of slasher movies, the patriarchal subtext has been\n\ndisavowed. The woman’s role is strikingly different from the positioning of\n\nMarion in Psycho, in contrast say of Sidney in Scream (Sharrett 1996).\n\nThe slasher sub-genre fire worked, leaving a trail of ‘B’ movie entries to litter\n\nthe horror scene, most of which are just sequels upon sequels of the 70's\n\ninitial movement. The effect delivers comical results and dilutes the seminal\n\nwork of key directors of the 70's, many of which are at their own hand. It may be argued that Craven is the most notorious culprit.\n\nWilliams (1996) cites the slasher as a reaction of the teenager to their\n\nparents, seen as executioners; thus in a sense they are becoming empowered, while understanding the convention of the earlier horror movement of the 70's. What this means is that the kids may have been monsters, but now the parents are the true monsters. One might argue, however, that the parents have always been the monsters. The mother is the monster, as the father is the abandoner (as discussed in the beginning). Thus the mother is left alone, and the affirmations of this are reflected in the child. Cyndy Hendershot sights:\n\nThe father’s authority over the child, namely the boy, giving rise to the\n\nrebellion flick of the teenager, although extremely confined. Thus blaming\n\nthe tight straight jacket of social order and traditional values, which came to\n\nbursting point in the 70's and has now been understood. (Hendershot 2005)\n\nThis suggest that the 50's teenage youth have emerged once more, this time\n\nwithout the traditional family to rebel against now that the family is as\n\ndysfunctional as they are, thus these rebels are indeed ferocious counterparts to their 50's icons, as Skeet Ulrich’s ‘James Dean’ Scream counterpart illustrates by wielding a knife to kill his girl, rather than taking her off on the back of his Harley.\n\nThe 70's aggressive streak has been settled, and even Craven, who’s Last\n\nHouse on the Left made us feel appalled, shows restrain in later work,\n\nincluding A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and Scream (1996). We might\n\nsuggest that the 90's Slasher seems more at home as teenage angst than\n\nsubversive horror, and it is therefore not surprising that Scream’s writer\n\nKevin Williamson went on to pen 90s teen angst TV show — Dawson’s Creek\n\n(1998), establishing the family unit’s unification with the horror genre, and\n\nacceptance back within melodrama.\n\nSingle Mother, troubled child\n\nHillary Clinton in an address to attack the Republican ‘family values’ agenda\n\nin 1992, stated:\n\n“If you don’t get married you’re abnormal, if you get married but don’t\n\nhave children you’re a selfish yuppie. If you get married and have\n\nchildren but then go outside the home to work you’re a bad mother. If\n\nyou get married and have children but stay home you’ve wasted your\n\neducation. And if you don’t get married but have children and work\n\noutside the home as a regional newscaster you get in trouble with the\n\nVice President” (Lewis 2006)\n\nAs the 80's seemed to sooth the bruising of Vietnam’s angry directors, the 90'srevealed the true impact of growing discourse within the American family unit.\n\nMrs Clinton’s statement aptly acknowledges this, promptly reinforced 10\n\nyears later by Clover in the USA/US television documentary The American\n\nNightmare (2000), within which she reflects, “we are all children of divorced families”.\n\nWilliams, in his interview with the writer, argues that whilst:\n\nClover claimed that the family horror film became extinct… part of my\n\nproject in ‘HEARTHS OF DARKNESS’ was to show that the theme still\n\noccurred despite the fact that it did not occupy as dominant a place as in the\n\n1970s. (From Williams interview, 2006).\n\nIt is therefore unsurprising that unknown director M. Night Shyamalan took\n\nthe cinema by storm with his highbrow début feature The Sixth Sense (1999), being aware that horror not only acts as receptacle for family reflection, but has become its main avatar.\n\nBorn in India but raised in posh suburban Penn Valley area of\n\nPhiladelphia, the son of two doctors. Had a very early passion\n\nfor filmmaking when given a Super-8 camera by age 8, modeling his career, even at that young age, to hero Steven Spielberg –\n\n(IMDB, 2006)\n\nI see dead people…\n\nThe premise of ‘Ghost Horror’ has been a mainstay of the genre for some\n\ntime, but why? The idea of ghost has allowed the horror movie to explore the family unit in a more private way.\n\nOften motifs of this sub-genre seem to include stillness, camera mastery,\n\nlighting and performance. Examples might include Robert Wise’s classic\n\nadaptation of Shirley Jackson’s Haunting of Hill House novel (1953), The\n\nHaunting (1963); Nicholas Roeg’s Don’t look Now (1973), Stanley Kurbick’s\n\nStephen King Adaptation of The Shining (1980) and the Steven Spielberg /\n\nTobe Hooper collaboration of Poltergeist (1983). Such examples seem to\n\nreinforce these motifs, with two of them centering on the loss of a child.\n\nShyamalan is well aware of motifs, and has realised his ghost story within\n\nthe dysfunctional family and, more importantly, the single mother. Lewis\n\n(2006) analyses the despair of Single Mothers in Contemporary Hollywood\n\nHorror, amid the results of the political progressive administration from\n\nReagan to Bush, which align the shape of our new society. This is the society\n\nenvisioned by Hitchcock, warned against by Romero, brutally reinforced by\n\nCraven and now portrayed by Shyamalan.\n\nThe Sixth Sense is at once dysfunctional (without father and with troubled\n\nchild); the punishment inflicted to the mother for her inability to maintain\n\nher role within the patriarchal order. One might argue that Shyamalan\n\nturns this convention on its head and begins to elaborately unfold a\n\nframework to resolve and commend the ‘new family’. Unlike most horror,\n\nwhere the father is not present, or is killed, The Sixth Sense allows the\n\ndead father to return. His passive yet central role allows the child to\n\nrecognise his own doomed future, at the hands of a single parent, yet come\n\nto terms with it.\n\nLewis (2006) identifies that such recognition of the dysfunctional\n\ntranscends the old law of patriarchal tradition, allowing a new family unit\n\nto emerge; ‘final child’ we might consider.\n\nCole, the child protagonist in The Sixth Sense leads us to these conclusions\n\nas Shyamalan’s camera glides through the narrative and cuts through the\n\nsuspense, we might suggest, with the mastery of Hitchcock. The closing\n\nmoments of the film realign Cole with his mother, establishing a powerful\n\nlink between them, as secondary protagonist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe\n\nacknowledges his own truth, as ghost, and accepts his death. He at once\n\nidentifies with the failure of his own patriarchal structure and the horror\n\ncycle concludes with the loss of father.\n\nWhilst the film does not present a traditional family unit at its conclusion,\n\nit can be seen to advocate the need for them by suggesting that the\n\n“greatest threat” to children is the absence of father figures and women’s\n\ninability to provide stability for their children. (Lewis 2006)\n\nIn response to this, one might argue that while this statement has merit,\n\nwithin the subtext, the film’s resolve suggests otherwise.\n\nShyamalan, revisiting the location of Romero’s Dead series and William\n\nFriedkin’s Exorcist (1973), treads a path of initiation, for his right of\n\npassage into the medium. The medium is to be exposed, having been\n\npreviously encoded in syntax of special effects.\n\nThe Sixth Sense, one could argue, is a clever narrative. Shyamalan\n\nharmonises key elements from a history of horror, to define the family as its\n\ncentral and progressive core. Lynne, Cole’s mother, remains weak,\n\nadhering to the gender classification, even after a decade of final girl.\n\nLynne demonstrates all of the gender qualities of the female in horror,\n\nunable to help Cole, while the male role remains scientific and justified\n\n(motifs on the genre from the 30's are discussed earlier).\n\nWithin the narrative’s closing moments Lynne achieves this, one might\n\nsuggest, when her own mother — daughter dysfunctional state is emotionally\n\nresolved through Cole’s ability to speak with the dead and confirm how\n\nmuch her mother loved her. This, one would argue, would indicate that\n\nLynne, after such affirmation is able to cope, is able to identify with Cole,\n\nand is ready to bridge the mother / father divide. (Lewis 2006)\n\nGhost stories gain immense emotional power, over the traditional horror motifs. Their ability to reflect loss and allow another attempt to embrace\n\nbroken family structures, if only briefly, forces us to re-evaluate our own family unification. This is especially prominent in Roeg’s Don’t Look Now, and remains a driving force of most melodramas. Is it surprising then that Poltergeist and E.T — The Extra Terrestrial (1982) are so similar?\n\nSpielberg is able to exercise the emotional pull of family, and the pain of\n\nseparation or loss; aka Elliot in E.T — The Extra Terrestrial, at the closing\n\nmoments when he aligns with the loss of his true father, and stand-in\n\nfather, E.T., as does Cole in The Sixth Sense and John Baxter in Don’t Look\n\nNow.\n\nTo conclude, the mother is able to transcend through the horror genre. The\n\nfather is not. The father, fixed in his patriarchal law, will always suffer the\n\nfate of abandonment and death. The child, mourning the loss of father,\n\ninitially is unable to identify with the masculinity of the male role, and\n\nfollows a dysfunctional path. The daughter becoming final girl resolves the\n\ndysfunctional son. As we reach the present era of horror, the mother has\n\nbecome both roles, whilst the children realign to save themselves.\n\nViolation of the Child — Single Mothers get Nasty\n\nIn this final section, we will explore one more film, ignoring the progressive\n\nwork of Romero, Craven and Carpenter. While significant parallels may be\n\nreached, especially with Craven’s later work, key films beyond the anger\n\ngeneration of these directors have emerged as more insightful developments\n\nwithin the context of the family unit.\n\nNotably, one might argue that these include The Blair Witch Project (1999),\n\nthe US version of Ringu (1998) — The Ring (2002) and The Others (2001).\n\nBefore exploring in detail Director Alejandro Amenábar’s The Others, one\n\nmight briefly highlight the other two films; both The Blair Witch Project, and\n\nThe Ring centre around the female role. The Blair Witch Project has the\n\nspectre of ‘mother’ looming over a band of parentless kids, as they are taken\n\none by one by a spiteful mother, in reaction to her dual role as patriarchal\n\nand matriarchal law. Thus, one might argue, the final girl, unable to survive\n\nthis time, establishes the dominance of single parent families. The Ring\n\nperhaps takes this one step further and has the final child avenge the mother\n\nand fathers’ dysfunctional state; a lasting reminder that the child must cope\n\nbeyond the diminished parental laws.\n\nThe Others, released two years after The Sixth Sense, retains the central\n\ntheme of single mother and distressed child, ultimately seeming to have its\n\nroots feed straight back to Psycho, some of forty years earlier. Robin Wood\n\nin his book Hitchcock’s films revisited (1989) sights Hitchcock as having an\n\nobsession with mother as monster and admitting to have a ‘like’ for\n\nterrorising his leading ladies.\n\nBrain De Palma seconds this with his pontification that “if you really want to get the most out of a scary location, get the camera to follow a woman around it” (Wood 1989).\n\nClover has shown us how the male gaze demands for the women in films to\n\nbe weak and unable to cope. Only when she can become masculine, a final\n\ngirl, is she able to survive. What is so interesting with Spanish Director\n\nAlejandro Amenábar’s only English speaking film, The Others, one might\n\nargue, is his total understanding of such conventions issuing the destruction of the traditional family; seeming to hand the viewer a ‘millennium’ summing up of the horror genre over the decades. Amenábar’s earlier film, Abre los ojos (1997), may be seen to parallel Hitchcock’s work, namely Vertigo (1958). Thus it is no surprise that he pulls us back to motifs, which have been misplaced in an age where special effects have dominated.\n\nThe Others is set during World War II, on the island of Jersey. It centers\n\non a housewife, Grace living in a mansion reflecting Wood’s “Terrible Place”\n\nideal (Wood 1989). Her husband is off fighting in the war, leaving her and\n\na collection of servants to look after her two children, Anne and Nicholas.\n\nStrangely the house is permanently shrouded in a blanket of fog, which\n\nprevents her to go beyond the boundaries. In addition, both children have\n\nXeroderma Pigmentosum, a condition which prevents them being exposed\n\nto direct sunlight. The film plays out a situation where Grace is bound to\n\nher house due to the fog, and bound to her children. It appears to be a\n\nscenario remaining true to the male gaze of women within the horror genre,\n\nand their identified role in the patriarchal law. This may be broken down\n\ninto 2 phases:\n\nThe identification of the role of woman as both mother and father,\n\nwith the ability to be masculine (disciplinarian) and feminine,\n\nprotecting and attending to her children’s needs.\n\nThe Monster — Grace’s undeniable other self, may be seen to reflect\n\nentrapment and abandonment, due to responsibility of gender. It\n\nmay be argued that such entrapment and inability to maintain\n\nboth gender roles has sent her insane. But whereas Kubrick’s The\n\nShining (1980) appears to have its central ‘madman’, Jake seen by\n\nthe male gaze as a victim and likable — as he terrorises his family;\n\nGrace’s monster can be viewed as dislikeable due to her inability to\n\nescape the male gazes’ assigned role for her gender.\n\nAt the film’s conclusion Grace is empowered to transcend the male gaze, as\n\nAmenábar reveals the film’s shocking twist; that Grace is in fact a ghost,\n\nhaunting her own house, in a state of purgatory after killing both her\n\nchildren and then herself. Britta Schinzel sights:\n\nThe rational mind is male”…Bacon’s ideas were directed towards a science,\n\nwhich was supposed to lead towards sovereignty, domination and\n\nsuperiority of man over nature. This was to save humanity from the\n\nirrational powers of nature (and femininity). (Schinzel 2000)\n\nAmenábar suggests that, even after assuming mother and father roles,\n\nGrace remains incapable of raising a family without a patriarchal presence.\n\nShe seems clearly aware of this fact, looking for the patriarchal figure to\n\nrescue her from the continuing entrapment of a single parent existence.\n\nHer eventual conclusion confirms her meditated suicide and destruction of\n\nboth her children at her own hand. The ghostly father and husband,\n\nappearing from the fog, urges her to face the fact that she is unable to come\n\nto terms with the new order, one of the dysfunctional; a state he has\n\naccepted within his role of the abandoned father. It is as if Amenábar has\n\nappended The Sixth Sense’s seminal meaning, in a last vein attempt to\n\nindicate the ‘family unit’ is well and truly dead.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy intention of this research study was to identify the American Family\n\nwithin the context of the horror genre. What has emerged is quite shocking:\n\nthe American family as an ideology appears to be non-existent within the\n\ncontext of contemporary horror; it is not depicted in modern horror, because\n\nthere is nothing left to depict.\n\nWhat began in the 30's horror movement unveiled the initial signs of tension\n\nwithin the wholesome traditional family unit, coded behind make-up, the\n\nuncanny and abject spectacle. It is therefore not at all surprising that some\n\nseventy years hence, the result of such tensions has been the completion of\n\nthis degradation, and we are left with a horror motif of ‘each for their own’.\n\nHorror in the new millennium is about the individual; families have become\n\nfragmented, children have been abandoned, final girls become final\n\nindividuals and the monsters have transcended from manifestations of actual beings, to now reflect the destructive force at the hand of the ordinary person, able to destroy and be destroyed without empathy.\n\nExamples I would cite are:\n\nSaw (2004), The Devil’s Rejects (2005), and Hostel (2006).\n\nThe horror movement from Frankenstein (1931) to The Sixth Sense (1999)\n\nhas failed quite miserably to prompt our reaction to such alarming issues\n\nwithin the family, although has done a far better job in preparing us for its\n\ndecline. In recognition, we have become the very zombies George A Romero\n\nsuggest in his latest movie, Land Of The Dead (2005); dysfunctional family\n\nunits operating alone, and without the bond of tradition, patriarchal\n\nconstraints or gender classifications.\n\nThe new generation of ‘family’, aptly portrayed in Rob Zombie’s The Devils\n\nRejects (2005), has emerged. Old horror monsters have lost their ability to\n\nscare. New horror requires new mechanics — thus we ponder news reports\n\nreasoning the motives of teenage attackers, violently abusing passers by,\n\nwhile filming the attack on their mobile phones (referred to as ‘Happy\n\nSlapping’), as if to identify with a new form of instant horror, vascular,\n\nverbose and real; Or question the motivation of audiences stood cuing to see\n\nlatest horror flic Hostel (2006); about nothing, if only to show a myriad of\n\nways to destroy a human being.\n\nLets be honest the horror movie to date has been one of the best ways to\n\nchart the downfall of the traditional family, and at this point in the chart, we\n\nare at total annihilation. (Graham Reed, Film buff and horror fanatic — interview with the writer, 2006).\n\nWill our new directors take on the mantle to regain the family unification, or\n\nacknowledge the undeniable fact that there is no family left to unify? And if\n\nthis is the case, Carpenter, Craven and Romero, your job is done — move on.\n\n— END —\n\nTony Williams’ (author of Hearths of Darkness) Response to my\n\nQuestionnaire:\n\nDear Sean,\n\nHere are my answers.\n\nQ: Why is there a lack of a ‘Father’ figure in the horror genre?\n\n1. I think this depends on each particular film. In certain ways, Michael,\n\nJason, and Freddy represent father figures of the dark side. They\n\nembody adolescent fears against actual fathers or fulfill the punitive\n\nroles that weak fathers do not. Real fathers do exist as in CURSE OF\n\nTHE CAT PEOPLE. This is a very complex question and answers\n\nwould depend on citations from each particular film.\n\nQ: Is final girl a reflection on the feminist progression of the 70’s to 90's\n\nor more a natural progression of the female role in horror.\n\n2. I would say the “Final Girl” as defined by Clover is a reflection of the\n\n“feminist progression of the 70s to 90s.” But, if you read my essay\n\n“Trying to Survive on the Darker Side” in THE DREAD OF DIFFERENCE you will see that I’m very critical of Clover’s thesis and find the “final girl” neither feminist or positive. Gaylyn Studlar once told me at a conference that her students found many problems with Clover’s theory and Janet Staiger delivered a paper at the New York SCS conference sometime during the 90s titled “Appreciatively Revising Carol Clover” as if acknowledging problems with the “Final Girl” theory. As for the natural progression of the female role in horror, I’m sure they do occur in the genre but Rachel McAdams’s role in Wes Craven’s RED EYE (2005) would form the nearest equivalent. I don’t view many horror films these days since I’ve moved on to other things.\n\nQ: Would you argue that the ideology of ‘the family’ no longer exists in the\n\nformula of horror today, and we are all individuals?\n\n3. This sounds very much like Thatcher’s “there is no such thing as\n\ncommunity” and the late John Smith’s comment, “We are all\n\nindividuals now.” In the last pages of her book, Clover claimed that the\n\nfamily horror film became extinct and part of my project in HEARTHS\n\nOF DARKNESS was to show that the theme still occurred despite the\n\nfact that it did not occupy as dominant a place as in the 1970s. For\n\nrecent examples, I’d suggest the remakes of DAWN OF THE DEAD\n\nand THE HILLS HAVE EYES. As a genre, horror naturally moves on\n\nand develops but once important themes are never too far away.\n\nQ: How will the new generation of film makers revisiting the 70’s classics\n\nlike ‘The Texas chainsaw massacre’, ‘’Land of the Dead’ and recently ‘The\n\nHills have eyes’ create a new message for the millennium?\n\n4. I have yet to see the new version of THE HILLS HAVE EYES so your\n\nquestion will prompt me to do so. I’ve written on LAND OF THE\n\nDEAD in the previous issue of the Australian online film journal\n\nrouge.com but do not intend to see the remake of THE TEXAS\n\nCHAINSAW MASSACRE which I’ve heard negative things about. But\n\nto answer your question LAND OF THE DEAD is a horror film which\n\ndirectly addresses problems facing the new millennium as does V FOR\n\nVENDETTA. Although it is not actually a horror film, despite its flaws\n\nit is the nearest one will get to criticizing the right-wing use of 9/11\n\nand the Guantanamo Bay concentration camps of the big screen. I\n\nbelieve that we may see a return of the political horror film soon. BTW,\n\nI’m co-editing an anthology on that subject with Reynold Humphries\n\nand we are both looking for material for 2007 onwards.\n\nQ: Could a horror film be as successful if it were to move away from using\n\nfamily motifs and if so how?\n\n5. As I wrote in HEARTHS OF DARKNESS, the family horror motif is a\n\nkey element within the genre but not the only one. I felt that its whole\n\nhistory needed more detailed treatment than it had so far received.\n\nGenres are fluid creatures. LAND OF THE DEAD is not actually a\n\nfamily horror film but it is a very successful work in its own right.\n\nHorror is always more interesting when it deals with relevant social\n\nissues rather than exclusively engaging in superficial special effects.\n\nQ: Which film do you consider to be the pinnacle of the horror genre and\n\nwhy?\n\n6. THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE because of its links with the\n\nfamily horror film and the always important social, historical, and\n\npolitical features generating any true horror film.\n\nBibliography\n\nClover, C (1992) Men, Women and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern\n\nHorror Film.
