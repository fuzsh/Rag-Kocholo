        "text": "What did you do during the Christmas Holidays? I went to see Mary Poppins Returns. I had to, even though I knew, right from the start, that Emily Bluntâ€™s interpretation of the Mary Poppins character was going to be the exact opposite of the original one, and that, despite Bluntâ€™s preliminary immersion in the original material. (And that is of course none of her fault. She had a script to respect).\n\nIndeed, Mary Poppins Returns just as its predecessor, has absolutely nothing to do with the stories from the books. The movie is simply a continuation of the 1964 big screen adaptation, and then some more. A lot of animated characters there, a lot of what Pamela L. Travers disliked in the first movie.\n\nI donâ€™t know if you watched the Facebook livestream of the World Premiere in Los Angeles presented by HSN (This in itself calls for a separate blog post, but I will probably refrain since it will be just me ranting about the mercantile exploitation of a mythical character) but my imagination nerve was stimulated by the fact that it was raining cats and dogs that evening, when it almost never rains in California. Wasnâ€™t that a funny coincidence? I couldnâ€™t help but think that maybe Pamela L. Travers was crying once more, just as she did at the premiere of Mary Poppins in 1964. And now, after seeing Mary Poppins Returns, I still think that my interpretation of the rain as a meaningful synchronicity remains plausible. Not that Mary Poppins Returns is a bad movie, itâ€™s just not Mary Poppins, not the one conjured up by Pamela L. Travers.\n\nWhen asked what she thought of the first film Pamela L. Travers replied:\n\nOh, now you are asking me a very difficult and delicate question. I wept when I saw it. I thought â€˜Oh what have I doneâ€™ when I saw that name coming up, Mary Poppins I thought â€˜What have I done?â€™ And you must admit it is not very like the books.\n\nWitness- The Woman Who Wrote Mary Poppins â€“ BBC Sounds\n\nI do admit that the movie is nothing like the books. But I also have to admit that the songs in it are just as lively and catchy as those in the first movie. My favorite song from Mary Poppins is A Spoonful of Sugar. It reminds me of my childhood and how my mother used to crush the Aspirin pill between two teaspoons and then put a drop of water and some sugar. Although she was not inspired by that song, we didnâ€™t have Disneyâ€™s Mary Poppins during my childhood in Bulgaria. But that is the subject of another post.\n\nA particular song from the new Mary Poppins Returns stuck with me and if you read the slightly modified version below, youâ€™ll understand why ðŸ˜‰\n\nA movie is not the book\n\nSo open up the book and take a look\n\nCause under the cover one discovers\n\nThat the King may be in shtook\n\nChapter titles are like signs\n\nAnd if you read between the lines\n\nYouâ€™ll find that your first impression was mistook\n\nFor the movie is nice\n\nBut the movie is not the book\n\nThe character of Mary Poppins as imagined or rather channeled by Pamela L. Travers (she insisted that she didnâ€™t create Mary Poppins but felt visited by her) remains largely misunderstood. Both movies failed to reconcile the ambiguities in Mary Poppins. All the coldness, emotional distance and anger in the original Mary Poppins are completely erased. It is obvious then that the goal here was not to understand the purpose of the real character nor the deeper meanings of the original stories but to invent new ones for the entertainement of the public, a sort of visual/auditory fantasy feast.\n\nThe question then is which is the real Mary Poppins, the one from the books, the musical or the movies?\n\nAnd for author Brian Sibley who was also a friend of Pamela L. Travers the answer is this:\n\nWell, thatâ€™s the point. They all are Mary Poppins, and they are â€“ together Mary Poppins. They are the whole of the Mary Poppins universe. Like many of the myths of antiquity, they are different tellings of the same essential story as understood by unique individuals, so that each telling has its own meaning. And each of us may prefer one version or another, and each of us may have a different experience and expectation of one medium or another, but all the versions to date exist as the entirety of Mary Poppins.\n\nAnything Can Happen If You Let It, Brian Sibley and Michael Lassell\n\nMaybe that is so, maybe Mary Poppins can be many different characters. She is a master shapeshifter. And maybe once a fictional character leaves the head of its creator it takes on a life of its own. Maybe Mary Poppins got tired of being plain and vain and set apart from others. Maybe she wanted to experience a loving connection with the Banks family.\n\nBut I doubt it! Just as I doubt that she came to solve any particular problem of the Banks family. Most people see in Mary Poppins a godlike figure coming from above to save the family, but that first impression is misleading. It is this obvious interpretation that transports the character into the fantasy world where it does not belong. By the way Pamela L. Travers disliked the word â€˜fantasyâ€™ and she made a distinction between â€˜fantasyâ€™ and â€˜the work of imaginationâ€™.\n\nI donâ€™t think Mary Poppins is fantasy you see. Itâ€™s not a word I really like. If you look it up in the dictionary you will, and all of you when you go back to school look it up in the dictionary, and youâ€™ll see what fantasy means, something unreal, phantasm or ghost. No, I think Mary Poppins is really very real, she deals with reality. And in order to, I would call it the work of imagination, and really to have anything to do with imagination and let your imagination have wings and soar you have to have your foot solidly on the earth, in reality. So, I donâ€™t like that word fantasy very much though I know it is very popular.\n\nLibrary of Congress (Washington DC) Performance. Interview. 1966-11-01, a Visit With P.L. Travers\n\nThe adventures in the Mary Poppins books are multilayered metaphors, allegories about our way of perceiving or misperceiving â€˜realityâ€™ and about the building blocks of our identities. And precisely because Mary Poppins does not come to help the Banks family with a particular problem that there is no plot in the books.\n\nIf you put aside the entertaining aspect of the movie, what would be the message of Mary Poppins Returns? Keep the fire of childish hope alive? Maybe that way all your problems will be solved by some magical apparition from above? Or is it to remember that you were once a child? Let me tell you this is not the sort of remembering Pamela L. Travers was writing about. Her remembering was reminiscent of her spiritual beliefs. It had to do with the awakening of oneâ€™s consciousness, the awareness of oneâ€™s whole self in the present moment. But of course, you couldnâ€™t find that in the movie, even if you looked between the screencaps."
