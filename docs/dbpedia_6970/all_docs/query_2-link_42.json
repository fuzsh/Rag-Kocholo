        "text": "Although the word culture is used broadly, at its core it relates to the shared values and meanings of a particular group. Culture determines and defines our identity. For example, most psychiatrists carry multiple identities related to gender, religion, seniority, specialism and so on, which in clinical practice may manifest in different ways, depending on context. Culture can also be seen in material terms, in other words, as the sum of human productive activity in a given space, including habits, institutions and customs. In broad terms, definitions of culture may be divided into the ecological, referring to the sum of human artefacts of a group, and the cognitive, which refers to the gross network of meanings that link a people together (Reference Barnard and SpencerBarnard 2002). It is important to note the distance between ecological and cognitive theories of culture, which allows a space for what aspects of behaviour, including sexual behaviour, actually signify. Reference HofstedeHofstede (2001) suggests that any given culture can be characterised in terms of five dimensions: individualism (egocentric or sociocentric); masculinity or femininity; power distance (the extent to which the less powerful expect and accept that power is distributed unequally); long-term orientation; and toleration of uncertainty. The influence of culture on the development of personality and maintenance of well-being is an important aspect of clinical work with disorders of behaviour, including sexual dysfunction. Medically, sexual dysfunction may be defined as a group of problems occurring in the domains of desire, arousal and orgasm, that may or may not involve pain (Reference Bhugra and ColombiniBhugra 2013). We might also add that some sexual dysfunctions are genderspecific, for example vaginismus and ejaculatory and erectile dysfunction, whereas others, such as disorders of desire and orgasm, are diagnosed in both genders.\n\nOn this basis, culture is particularly relevant in sexual function and dysfunction, where it is important to understand the way in which behaviour is perceived by the participants. It is inevitable that culture plays a complex role in the production of sexual activity, be it heterosexual, homosexual or alternative sexual minority behaviours. Attitudes to any sexual activity or behaviour are strongly influenced by culture.\n\nFertility\n\nAs noted above, a potential consequence of a sex-negative culture is the prominence given to procreation as the primary function of sex. In this way, sex may be seen as intrinsically and exclusively linked to fertility, and notions of sexual dysfunction may be shaped by this relation. Pressure for fertility may be a cause of distress and stress, and can be viewed in both a pathofacilitative (e.g. greater expectations of fertility and procreation in a culture alter the threshold for presenting with conception problems) and a pathoselective (e.g. a couple deciding to present with conception difficulties rather than erectile or orgasmic dysfunction) way. For example, individuals may prefer to articulate dysfunction in terms of problems in conceiving, rather than in simple terms of sexual performance itself.\n\nThe individual v. the couple\n\nWestern biomedicine positions the individual as central to aetiological theories, although in the assessment of sexual dysfunction, formulations often involve the location of problems within two individuals â€“ the couple. This focus has various shortcomings when it comes to understanding the broader social and cultural implications of illness. Non-Western couples may be non-egocentric. For example, Chinese individuals often present to services within a detailed interpersonal family context, which can introduce complexities for a Western clinician seeking to formulate the case in terms of the couple. In light of the cultural relativities discussed above, couples from different ethnic groups may be even more challenging in this regard, given the possibility that widely differing expectations of sex may be engendered.\n\nConclusions\n\nIt is clear that certain parts of the non-Western world have much higher rates of some forms of sexual dysfunction than the West, that these variations probably relate to cultural differences, and that these observations should lead to a careful consideration of the role of culture in both the management of sexual dysfunction in different cultural contexts and the design and resourcing of services. However, valid comparisons between populations require further study.\n\nIt is important to be aware of cultural influences on sexual behaviour. Laws, power relationships in terms of sex and gender, levels of stress and economic resources are all of significance. Tseng's framework gives us a way of understanding the aetiology and management of sexual dysfunction according to cultural beliefs and values. Incorporating this understanding into formulations is a useful way of articulating and separating risk and protective factors in a given presentation. Furthermore, the importance of cultural factors in shaping definitions and thresholds for sexual difficulties for both the clinician/observer and the patient/participant cannot be underestimated. Expectations of treatment and a detailed positioning of the problem in a social and familial framework are crucial, as is an understanding of the values of clinicians themselves. Such structures are also useful in thinking about the rejection of help in different situations.\n\nMore work is obviously necessary on how cultural factors shape the thresholds and definitions of sexual dysfunctions in different groups, and how those considerations may influence management. Future research must carefully identify prevalence of sexual dysfunction in different cultural groups.\n\nThere must be a greater focus on modes of presentation between groups. Qualitative methods should be employed to understand the population's own perspectives on their difficulties, the causes of those difficulties and appropriate treatment. Useful formulations depend on clear understanding of the resources available to each patient and group within a population. Individuals may not share the professional's attribution of their problems as cultural and this also needs to be taken into account."
