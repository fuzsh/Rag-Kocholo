        "text": "Yes, folks. The sequel we never asked for dropped its first trailer! Let's take a look.\n\nThey certainly were able to capture some of the feel of the original MARY POPPINS, but I'm just yet convinced that this sequel is necessary.\n\nI'm pretty certain that the only reason I watched the original over and over again again as a kid was because real people were interacting with cartoons and it blew my young mind. That, and Bert was pretty cool with his one man band setup.\n\nThe premise of the original story was that Poppins came to the children of a dysfunctional family, Jane and Michael Banks, to tell them to add sugar to their medicine. I mean taught the Banks family how to have fun and become closer to their father by having adventures without him?\n\nYou just can't undo the trauma of neglect, because the damage RETURNS in the next film.\n\n“In Depression-era London, a now-grown Jane and Michael Banks, along with Michael's three children, are visited by the enigmatic Mary Poppins following a personal loss. Through her unique magical skills, and with the aid of her friend Jack, she helps the family rediscover the joy and wonder missing in their lives.”\n\n—Disney\n\nDick Van Dyke will not be reprising his role as Bert, but will be in the new MARY POPPINS RETURNS. Julie Andrews, however, will not. “Out of respect for Emily Blunt.” From what I read on Entertainment Weekly, it just doesn’t seem like Andrews was really interested in playing anyone other than Mary Poppins.\n\nAre you guys actually interested in seeing this? I'm not finding myself too eager about it.\n\n~Big Eyes"
