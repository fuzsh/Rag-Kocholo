        "text": "Introduction\n\nBullying behavior is a global phenomenon and highly prevalent in early adolescence (UNICEF, 2018), with devastating consequences and health implications. Several authors have provided definitions of bullying, with Farrington defining it as a “repeated oppression, psychological or physical, of a less powerful person by a more powerful one” (Farrington, 1993) and Coloroso defining bullying as “a conscious, deliberate hostile activity intended to terrorize and harm others through the threat of further aggression” (Coloroso, 2008). The most common and widely accepted definition of bullying was described by Olweus and states that “a person is bullied when he or she is exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons” (Olweus, 1993). However, in all these definitions, authors agree that bullying is a form of aggression with serious long- and short-term implications on health and wellbeing of those who are involved.\n\nA bulk of the literature have linked bullying victimization with a wide range of adverse health outcomes, mainly related to anxiety, depression, self-injury, and suicidal ideation (Lereya et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2017), and with engagement in unhealthy risk behaviors (Hertz et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2017; Waasdorp et al., 2018). Also, bullying others is predictive of poor academic achievement (Nansel et al., 2001, 2004), antisocial personality and other psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation in adulthood (Klomek et al., 2009; Sourander et al., 2007, 2009, 2011; Ttofi et al., 2011).\n\nBullying Forms\n\nBullying can take the form of verbal abuse, physical violence, or social rejection. Some authors also consider that these forms of bullying entail direct (verbal and physical) or indirect (relational) bullying (Björkqvist et al., 1992).\n\nThe direct or more overt aggression includes observable confrontations which involve physical and verbal attacks; while indirect bullying includes attacks that are carried out in a more covert and secretive manner, using spreading rumors, excluding people from groups, or persuading or daring a peer to harm another child or adolescent.\n\nGender seems to play an important role in bullying involvement (Steinfeldt et al., 2012). There is evidence showing that the rates of aggressive behavior and bullying behavior are higher among boys than girls (World Health Organization, 2017). However, some researchers argue that there is not a gender difference between boys and girls, but instead the two groups use different forms of aggression. Evidence suggests that boys are more likely to be involved as victims or as bullies, especially in its physical expression (Craig & Harel-Fisch, 2004; Silva-Rocha et al., 2020), while girls are more likely to engage in situations of indirect bullying, such as teasing or gossiping (Committee on the Biological and Psychosocial Effects of Peer Victimization, 2016; Finkelhor et al., 2015; Silva-Rocha et al., 2020). This difference in behavior might be attributed to biological reasons, or to gender differences in the socialization process, where boys are encouraged to be aggressive and competitive, but girls are expected to be nurturant and expressive. However, the consequences of bullying for the well-being and in health outcomes are not expected to be different among girls and boys.\n\nHousehold Environment and Bullying Behavior\n\nThe social environment influences the nature and quality of social relationships which in turn affect child development and future achievements. Literature has shown that a warm, authoritative, and sensitive parenting style contributes to children’s positive social behavior and supportive peer relationship (Helsen et al., 2000). Also, students with higher “self-confidence” and “avoidance from bullying” scores, are more likely to report lower levels of family dysfunctions (Eşkisu, 2014).\n\nOn the other hand, a harsh family environment, with a low parental capacity to care for their kids, may affect children’s social skills and decrease their ability to cope with stress and difficult times (Álvarez-García et al., 2015; Hong & Espelage, 2012; Mazur et al., 2017; Yeager et al., 2015). Authoritarian parenting styles, such as use of physical discipline, and hostile and rejecting parenting influence engagement in bullying behavior through the development of poor self-image and emotional dysregulation (Christie-Mizell, 2003; Espelage & Swearer, 2003; Espelage et al., 2003; Shields & Cicchetti, 2001). Also, the exposure to household conflicts poses a significant threat to children’s ability to process and regulate emotions, and it may result in undercontrolled or overcontrolled emotional reactions contributing to both internalizing and externalizing behaviors (Zarling et al., 2013).\n\nA dysfunctional family environment is associated with the onset of episodes of anxiety, aggressiveness, and impulsivity in the children, impairing their development tactics to solve a conflict with their peers (Kolk, 2017), and putting them at greater risk of displaying violent, aggressive, and bullying behaviors outside the home environment (Hong & Espelage, 2012). Children who bully others are more likely to come from family environments characterized by less cohesion, expressiveness, organization, control, and social orientation (Stevens et al., 2002). In addition, although parents’ aggressive punishment did not influence the child’s aggressive behavior directly, child’s aggressive behavior depends on the parents and child relationship. Parents of aggressive boys expressed higher approval of aggression in social life (Frączek & Kirwil, 1992) and children who are raised by dominant parents or with an over-control in their behavior tend to harass their classmates at school (Manning et al., 1978). At the same time, permissive parents legitimize combative activities and fail to provide opportunities for the child to control his or her aggressive urges (Schaffer, 1994).\n\nAccordingly, growing up in a dysfunctional environment adversely impacts the children’s behavior. However, the specific nature of this link remains unclear. There are studies that find links to internalizing behaviors while other show links to externalizing behaviors (Kitzmann et al., 2003). Although we will not explore which mechanisms would explain these links, it would be relevant, therefore, to understand how this household dysfunction impact bullying behavior in children, in terms of frequency of aggression and victimization.\n\nSocioeconomic Circumstances, Household Dysfunction, and Bullying\n\nStudies suggested an inconsistent relationship between low socioeconomic circumstances and a higher likelihood of being victims and being involved as bully-victims simultaneously. While some authors state that family socioeconomic circumstances influence bullying involvement, and children from low socioeconomic backgrounds and living with a single parent are more likely to be involved in bullying behaviors (Nordhagen et al., 2005), a systematic review showed that the association of socioeconomic circumstances with bullying was weak, providing little guidance for targeted interventions (Tippett & Wolke, 2014).\n\nHowever, a clear relationship between socioeconomic circumstances in childhood and neglect or maltreatment was reported in a systematic review, suggesting that low childhood socioeconomic circumstances is a determinant of such adversity (Walsh et al., 2019), and the longitudinal nature of many studies support a causal association. So, low socioeconomic circumstances seem to increase a child vulnerability to abuse and neglect at home (Ondersma, 2002). This can contribute to the development of low interpersonal skills, which in turn might increase the likelihood of involvement in bullying behaviors at school (Bowes et al., 2009; Glew et al., 2005; Jansen et al., 2011, 2012; Tippett & Wolke, 2014). It would be of relevance to investigate the impact of household dysfunction on bullying behavior considering the socioeconomic context in which children are living.\n\nThis Study\n\nWe hypothesize that the experience of household dysfunction by children from an advantaged socioeconomic group would less likely lead to engaging in peer violence. Studies have encouraged monitoring the different environments in which children are exposed, to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms and determinants of bullying involvement at early ages, and consequently to provide evidence to intervene and prevent its adverse consequences (Garmy et al., 2018; Henderson et al., 2018). Thus, we measured the prevalence of bullying involvement in 10-year-old children and examined how household dysfunction was associated with bullying behavior considering different family socioeconomic contexts.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study showed that although children from medium-high income families were less likely to experience adversity in their home and engage in violent behaviors, when stressful household events occur it substantially impacts the odds of being involved in bullying behaviors. Though we have to be careful when establishing comparisons between these groups of participants since their basal risk may be different, our results seem to support that the negative influence of household adversity in children’s behavior is not only limited to children in low socioeconomic families. As previously reported, being exposed or witnessing other forms of victimization at home might increase their susceptibility for being involved in bullying (Lereya et al., 2015), as children might see it as an acceptable way to manage interpersonal conflicts. When children from higher socioeconomic groups suffer an adverse experience in their home, the effect on their behavior is greater, suggesting that a more favorable socioeconomic environment may not act as a protective factor against the influence of household dysfunction. A similar finding was reported in a previous study (Halfon et al., 2017), in which authors showed that children in the highest income bracket who suffer from adverse childhood experiences were not protected against the effect of these adverse experiences on their health. Thus, a higher income does not always protect a family from the impact of a stressful event. On the other hand, if a child lives in a disadvantaged socioeconomic environment and is also exposed to material deprivation or financial strain, with the daily stress related to socioeconomic deprivation and its consequences, the impact of another traumatic psychosocial event may not have much meaning; but if a child belongs to a high socioeconomic household and experiences a traumatic event, this child will have increased levels of stress that may influence child’s reactions and behaviors, which may explain engagement in bullying. Moreover, we must acknowledge the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage that states that adverse family-related circumstances are associated with increased odds of experiencing disadvantaged social, economic, and health-related trajectories across adulthood. Thus, our results are in line with the theories of cumulative disadvantage, reflecting that an adverse situation in childhood may be a marker for accumulated and, to some extent, persistent problems later in life (Almquist & Brännström, 2018).\n\nPrevious studies showed that victims of bullying and bully-victims were more likely to come from low socioeconomic households (Alikasifoglu et al., 2007; Bowes et al., 2009; Jansen et al., 2011; Jansen et al., 2012; Tippett & Wolke, 2014). Our results also showed that household income was associated with bullying behavior, with those children from low socioeconomic conditions reporting more frequently being a victim or a bully-victim. Besides, we observed an increased likelihood of involvement as a bully in children from medium-high income when the history of household criminality, parents IPV, and exposure to physical violence is reported. These findings suggest that exposure to household dysfunction might impact children’s emotional and behavioral development, and as previously reported, with later increased risk of mental health consequences (Lereya et al., 2015) and disease conditions (Felitti et al., 1998).\n\nIn the study of Lereya et al., it was observed that children who were bullied were more likely to have mental health problems later in life, while children who were both maltreated and bullied were also at increased risk for mental health problems, but with lower risk than those of being bullied alone. Thus, being bullied had worse long-term adverse effects on young adults’ mental health than being maltreated by adults (Lereya et al., 2015). Taking these results into account, investments in the identification of children at risk of becoming a bully or victim could allow the intervention at younger ages and timely prevention of bullying and victimization, and consequently of its potential detrimental health outcomes. Identification is enhanced by knowledge on determinants and predictors of bullying behavior. Also, as involvement in bullying seems to be socially patterned, family, school, and neighborhood socioeconomic circumstances might also help to identify an increased risk of involvement and predict bullying behavior as these factors are likely to influence children’s behavior, and pose as a window of opportunity to intervene. Nevertheless, some controversy remains on the effectiveness of an intervention in school environments to prevent bullying. Even though several research teams have studied the effectiveness of various bullying prevention programs, a meta-analysis by Ttofi and Farrington is recognized as one of the most comprehensive and rigorous to date. They conclude that whole-school programs are effective in reducing bullying and victimization but also that there are great variations in the effects of different programs (Ttofi & Farrington, 2009).\n\nOur study found that one in five children have been involved in repeated behaviors of bullying and that boys were more frequently involved in bullying than girls. This finding might mean that boys are more willing to report their bullying behaviors, or they are more willing to use bullying as a dominant strategy. Nevertheless, our results showed a higher prevalence of pure victims among boys when compared to girls. This is contrary to what most previous studies have shown, in which girls were more likely to report higher levels of victimization. Also, the prevalence of being a bully or being bully-victim is lower in our study. As they grow, children who were victims of bullying would be more prone to get involved in bullying others and, therefore, to be both victims and bullies simultaneously. Although our study is focused on a particular age, it is expected that the prevalence of pure victim’s decreases, and the prevalence of bully-victims and pure bullies increases with age (Craig et al., 2009).\n\nOne of the main strengths of this study is the use of a large study, such as Generation XXI. The use of several detailed questions about exposures to a household with dysfunctions, as well as data on bullying involvement, through a detailed scale, is likely to have given a higher catchment rate for those exposures than single screening questions. The information on adverse experiences was self-reported, so the children completed the questionnaire by themselves. It allowed us to assess self-reported involvement instead of the involvement reported by parents or professors as in other studies (Bowes et al., 2009; Foster & Brooks-Gunn, 2013). Also, the interviewer should only intervene when the child asked for help; therefore, the presence of the interviewer is not expected to influence children’s answers. However, self-report answers can add ambiguity due to undisclosed or socially desirable answers, especially expected when dealing with these private issues. Thus, it could contribute to underestimate the prevalence of bullying. Furthermore, we emphasize that while other studies are limited to investigate specific indicators such socioeconomic (Magklara et al., 2012) or other stressful or violent events (Bowes et al., 2009), our results exhibit a broader approach, once it takes into account the socioeconomic environment and the exposure to household dysfunctions simultaneously, which may be more useful to predict and prevent bullying involvement.\n\nOur sample includes participants of Generation XXI, that were not selected by gender, ethnicity, or religion. Moreover, Generation XXI participants are almost exclusively Caucasian, and there is no ethnic variability to account for. In our cohort, less than 5% of mothers were born in another country. The lack of diversity at the recruitment time is explained by the small number of foreign citizens (329,898) who were living in Portugal in 2006, and by the fact that most of them were concentrated in the metropolitan area of Lisboa (Instituto Nacional de Estatística, 2007). As it is not expected that exposure to bullying varies for different ethnic or religious groups, these concepts are not to consider in the observed results, and the associations we found are mainly due to exposure to household adversity and socioeconomic circumstances differences.\n\nHowever, some limitations must be acknowledged. Generation XXI aims at attaining novel and useful knowledge for understanding the Portuguese reality, by using data from children born in the metropolitan area of Porto, and by thus predominantly urban. However, it is not expected that the main results would be different if including children from rural areas. Also, within the cohort, we assessed bullying involvement and household adversity at the age of 10 years, and we used family socioeconomic circumstances reported at the same time, precluding any comparison or causality estimation due to cross-sectional nature of the study. Nevertheless, variables used as exposures, such as household dysfunction are considered as risk factors and cannot be consequences of bullying involvement. Even though exposure of the child to violence can be framed as either risk factor or consequence of bullying, we believe that family environment seems to play a substantial role in the likelihood of a child to become involved in bullying (Álvarez-García et al., 2015; Hong & Espelage, 2012; Mazur et al., 2017; Yeager et al., 2015) and thus explaining the association found. Therefore, it would be particularly informative for future studies to examine these exposures and bullying involvement by using longitudinal data. Additionally, although there is a potential bias through underestimation when asking for family income (Moore et al., 2000), the existence of bias would lead to an underestimation of the associations, therefore, not affecting our results. Moreover, we used data aggregated into classes instead of the format used for data collection, to easier comprehension and statistical efficiency. This way we can compare participants from low with medium-family incomes and also, identify different types of involvement in bullying, and classifying them according to the frequency of the involvement. Even though it is quite common to combine subjects with some score above a threshold into categories, as we did to the income and bullying variables, taking advantage of increasing the prevalence of participants in the different categories and improving the ease of comprehension and the statistical efficiency of the analysis, they may come at the price of misclassification of participants. We believe that this option does not affect our results, since we collapsed only adjacent categories with similar frequencies (in the case of bullying) and similar proportions (in the case of income). Thus, the impact of misclassification should be residual in the analyses. Also, as a common occurrence in prospective birth cohorts, there has been attrition over time, leading to a reduction in the sample size and a more socioeconomically advantaged group of participants throughout childhood and cohort evaluations. Nevertheless, we believe that the inclusion of the more-disadvantaged group would have widened the differences observed. The number of missing’s in the specific questions regarding bullying is insignificant and by thus, does not affect our findings.\n\nWe must also acknowledge that some dimensions might be important to take into account in future studies addressing this association. Perceived social support, meaning the knowledge and feeling that a person is cared for (Davidson & Demaray, 2007), ensure positive effects and may act as a “buffering effect” that can mitigate the negative impact of stress and exposure to a problematic situation (Holt & Espelage, 2007). Thus, social support can improve the coping ability and reduce the harmful consequences of bullying (Eşkisu, 2014), conducting toward a process of building resilience. Resilient individuals are those who manifest positive outcomes over time despite facing significant adversities (Luthar et al., 2000). Peer relationships may also play a role in promoting resilience to bullying. For example, bullied adolescents who report high levels of support from peers are more likely to maintain appropriate academic achievement for their age group compared to those with low peer support (Rothon et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011)."
