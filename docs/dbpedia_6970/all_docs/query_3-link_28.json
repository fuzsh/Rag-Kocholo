        "text": "Actually, all joking aside, there was no problem. An obscure -- if offensive -- term no one uses, no one has used for decades, and no one paid any attention to whatsoever, a term no child ever remembered or needed any contextualization about, has become resurrected and had the spotlight shown on it because some professional institution took it upon itself to make an issue of a long-forgotten archaic term uttered in a movie that, frankly, no one gives much a **** about.\n\nI saw Mary Poppins when it was released and a number of times since. I never once picked up on the word. Not one single time. I would be willing to bet if you showed the movie to a group of children today none would pick up on it either, assuming they agreed to watch the whole thing and remained awake for the duration (I did not myself, the first time...).\n\nThe irony here is Mary Poppins needs restrictions on what age group its appropriate for while any kid whose family has a computer or TV can pretty much see and hear -- you name it. Yet Mary Poppins is \"inappropriate.\" Like I said before -- friggin' stoopid.\n\nBut, I'm not myopic. There are instances where a focus on the word \"Hottentot\" is appropriate -- in academic study of the history of the region around South Africa and the way the Dutch and British viewed the couple of tribes they eventually generalized as \"Hottentots\", etc., and how it entered the vernacular and would have been used in certain contexts. To guess any kid is going to pick up and repeat the word -- uttered twice in a two-hour-plus film, demonstrates a level of optimism in the attention span of children I very highly doubt exists.\n\nSo according to the BBFC Mary Poppins may be inappropriate for children under the age of eight. From my perspective it was made for children under the age of eight, movie length and Dick Van Dyke not withstanding.\n\nI think moronic is the appropriate term for the controversy here.\n\nBut I'm glad this is being highlighted. I always enjoy a good spectacle of utter stupidity in the media and here. It renews my faith in the mystery of life. It's fun and lets me know I'm not the dumbest person in the room. Not by a long shot. All good.\n\nWe are definitely, absolutely meant to have a narrow view of the world with those views shaped and dictated by others, giving us the issues they prefer our attentions be focused on. The fact the military leaders in West are telling you to prepare for WWIII with Russia, a helpless group of people are being depopulated from their homes by dint of the force of bombs, the economies of the G7 are so utterly indebted the world's entire financial infrastructure teeters on implosion on the one hand or hyper-inflation on the other, or that nearly the entirety of the world's eco systems are in a griveous state are complex issues best not taken up by the population at large. Best leave those crucial decisions to those who got us to this state of affairs in the first place. Mary Poppins has two archaic and long, long outdated bad words uttered within the space of 139 minutes of dialogue. My guess is that amounts to 3 or 4 seconds. I think it's clear what's important here -- exposing children under the age of eight to Mary Poppins is abuse. Call social services. Dial now.\n\nSo how often do you watch Mary Poppins?\n\nThis assumes you will be asked about it. I'll bet with high confidence that the chances of that are exceedingly close to zero. But, we all knew that. Well, some of us did.\n\nI put \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" on repeat when I do my liver cleanse regimen twice a year. It requires drinking a solution of Epsom Salts, one of the foulest, bitterest tastes on the planet. Awful, awful, awful. I don't get to use any sugar, however. I doubt it would help anyway. Wait...\"foulest\" and \"bitterest\" have negative connotations and might jolt some members out of their safe space. That was inappropriate. I'll see if I can rephrase in a way that's appropriate for all audiences:\n\n\"It is suggested that one drinks a solution of Epsom Salts, one of strongest tastes on the planet.\"\n\nThat's better. That tells the story. \"Strong\" is good. Big good. Positive. Double-plus good.\n\nThat's what I'm talking about -- completely inappropriate. I can fix it:\n\nTaylor: \"I'd like to press my lips to your face as a physical demonstration of affectionate appreciation to you.\"\n\nZira: \"But you're so darn aesthetially challenged in the frontal head and/or face area.\"\n\nI think that section of dialogue needs a modern overdub like above. My new wording is not only completely appropriate, it's more exciting and puts the dialogue into a more conscious, aware type of interpersonal dynamic considering the new social realities and understandings we see in social media, legacy media, and 'books' -- to the extent they still exist and are being read with a view toward understanding the impact \"words\" and \"dictionaries\" have on our lived experience in our day-to-day struggles that corrupting influences from films and the like ilk have on a wide variety of groups like with these old school films nobody watches anymore, certainly not children, who as children need to know the right and wrong of class struggle, ethnic struggle, sexual dynamics in the workplace and classroom, physical sexual/biological mechanics, and that as a child it's OK if an adult in your life wants to dress you in a miniskirt or a pair of chaps and take some pictures of you as long as you understand that Mary Poppins or Planet of the Apes is just not OK. Not now, not ever. It's all about fairness. If your mom or dad watches Mary Poppins with you and you're not eight yet, I want you to tell your teacher or call this number. We will arrange a home visit. Tell mom and dad we intend to record it. Don't be nervous if the police come too. They just want to make sure nothing bad happens. You might even get a surprise! A brand new family! Won't that be fun? OK, say \"goodbye\" now. Bye bye!\n\nThe Telegraph is generally very readable for its arts coverage - especially its long form articles on rock music. But that one is not accurate.\n\nAs I understand it, Mary Poppins had its classification reviewed because it's being rereleased in UK cinemas this year. The PG classification only applies to cinemas and is simply advice to parents who are thinking of taking their kids to see the film. It's still rated U for home viewing.\n\nHow is it inaccurate when they have not mentioned -I believe- home video? Does this mean they should also disclose cinema and home video ratings in other countries? It is just a note that have been printed in pretty much all the papers in the world, some have more details, some have less but I don't see how this is inaccurate. Would a link to the BBC make you happier? The change in rating happened regardless. I did not make any mention myself about home video in OP either, or have I?\n\nI won't name names but I think it's pretty clear a great many people have some kind of twisted agenda vis-a-vis Mary Poppins and conspire to expose children to the word in question and to Julie Andrews in general, etc., in an effort to keep these \"words\" and outdated modes of behavior alive in our societies in order to create conflict and take away our cars and gas stoves. Why else would the BBFC change its rating in this crucial time? There has been a well understood Satanic undercurrent to this at least since 1967. And all this blows up at its 60th anniversary? Coincidence? Sixtieth? Do your own research. If this film clip isn't proof positive, I don't know what is:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/8CaQSyJyrT4"
