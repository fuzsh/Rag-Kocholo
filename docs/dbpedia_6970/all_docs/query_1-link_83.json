        "text": "The Hoover family of 6 travel in a yellow Volkswagen bus to California for their youngest daughter to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant which is her dream. There is a husband, his wife, his daughter, his son, his brother in law, and his own father who are all traveling with each other for 2 days. Each family member in the movie is trying to accomplish some dream throughout the film. Olive the daughter is trying to win the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The father is trying to becoming a motivational speaker. The wife is trying to reunite her family together as one. The son is attempting to take vow of silence and become an airforce pilot. The uncle is attempting to live a better\n\nWhat is family in your opinion? Family can be a source of support, compassion, optimism, love and happiness, but family can also be a cause of depression, betrayal, hurt and pain. Family is not always determined based on having the same DNA but it is the relationships that people can make or have with one another. Family can consist of several different people like, friends, co-workers, classmates, a community, etc... Some family members can be your worst enemies because they have the most information of secrets to bring a relative down. Being able to trust a person, depend on them, and be carefree is a person that can be valued as being a part of a family. In the movie Little Miss Sunshine, their dysfunctional family is loving, supportive, optimistic and motivating. The movie is filled with humor about a modern middle-class family that is about to encounter a financial catastrophe but in the midst of their struggles they still find the beauty in life and the meaning in life. The beginning of the movie Richard, the father is giving a motivational speech about winning, he states “There are two types of people in this world, winners and losers”.(Little Miss Sunshine) Richard is a protagonist motivational speaker that is obsessed with winning. He is so consumed with achieving that he ridicules his family for not being perfect throughout the film. Richard trying to build up the ideal life or what he thinks is the ‘American Dream’ around himself. He chooses to ignore aspects of the life around him that he sees as unacceptable or out of sync with his ideal lifestyle, trying instead to fulfil his role as the authorative head of the family and provider. Sheryl is the mother who is optimist, she is always giving words of encouragement even when Richard is trying to bring down his family and she is all about being truly honest. Frank is the brother of Sheryl whom at the beginning attempts to commit suicide due to a broken heart and losing his standing as Americas pre-eminent Proust Scholar. Dwayne is the son of Richard and Sheryl and is committed to joining the air force. He also is very committed that he takes a vow of silence until he gets into the air force, but then he finds out he is color blind and breaks his\n\nIn ‘Little Miss sunshine’, Hoover’s family is introduced as dysfunctional, however, they eventually re-unite and bond with one another. Before the new relationship, the dysfunctional family is illustrated in the scene where Hoover’s family is arguing in the car. The use of eye level shot allows the audience to see each character’s facial expressions and actions. Another example of this idea is communicated through the use of symbolism. In the film, the family have numerous problems with the van such as broken gear and horn, which represent how the family is falling apart. However, through the strength of the human spirit in each character, the family achieves to have a strong bond with one another. This is revealed in the scene where the family is on stage with Olive at the beauty pageant to help her out. Funky and high-spirited music is applied to display their emotions of being happy and joyful. During the physical journey, there are emotional and physical obstacles that the family overcome which demonstrates how resilience is an important factor in the bonding of the\n\nThey are silly, self-assimilated, and vindictive and essentially any pessimistic quality you can think a man is fit for having without imploding. They look for and wreck and act with no idea to outcome. Furthermore, I think that its intriguing that Emily Bronte picked them to be her focal heroes. We should appreciate the story itself, the association between these families and what happens. This book contains a solid and over the top, possessive, resolute yet enthusiastic sentiment. The association between the principle characters is special in its own specific manner not as a matter of course great but rather one of a kind, solid. Their division prompted wildness, self-centeredness, distrustfulness and makes them feel lost; makes them destruct and gradually execute themselves and everybody around them. This book demonstrates authenticity. This is an emotional and dismal book yet astonishing still. Like I said some time recently, it must be perused with some sort of state of mind and we must have the capacity to center in the peculiarity and one of a kind words covered up in each line. I like that the creator recounted to us this story through the maid, Nelly Dean's account, who is a witness of this stormy story. Her story is captivating. Additionally, the space of the plot is suitable and"
