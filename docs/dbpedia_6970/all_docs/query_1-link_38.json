Please do your own research before making any online purchase.\n\nEvery person plays a role in their family, whether it’s healthy or dysfunctional. In a typical immediate family, there are the usual roles of mother, father, child, and sibling, and when you zoom out, there are the grandparent, aunt, uncle, and cousin roles.\n\nBut your family dynamics go way deeper than that. If your family is dysfunctional, like mine, the roles don’t balance each other out or work together properly as they do in a well-oiled healthy family machine.\n\nInstead, dysfunctional family roles cause hurt and confusion, bring chaos, and cause upset. The people in these roles even exhibit codependent or enabling characteristics, resulting in more dysfunction.\n\nLet’s look at the dysfunctional family roles so you can learn more and identify whether the members of your family fit into these or not.\n\nWhat Does Dysfunctional Mean?\n\nDysfunctional refers to something that doesn’t work or function as it should. For example, if your car is dysfunctional, it doesn’t operate properly because the engine is broken or the spark plugs are faulty.\n\nThe term “dysfunction” can also refer to social behavior that’s not the norm and considered as bad. When you are dysfunctional or behave in a dysfunctional way, you are not doing what you should or what is normal.\n\nWhat’s Considered Dysfunctional in a Family Structure?\n\nA family unit can be dysfunctional, too. It’s a family structure that’s unhealthy and embroiled with conflict, animosity, criticism, indifference, hostility, and a lack of structure. It’s filled with neglect, secrecy, abuse, lack of emotional support and no empathy, and very little unconditional love.\n\nA child’s emotional and physical needs aren’t met (often at all), and neither are those of the other family members.\n\nThere are various factors that can cause a family to become dysfunctional:\n\nPoor parenting (generational curse)\n\nSubstance abuse or other kinds of addiction\n\nChronic physical illness\n\nPoor communication\n\nMental illness\n\nControlling, authoritarian, or manipulative behaviors\n\nUnfortunate life events, like divorce, unemployment, financial distress, or death\n\nInsecure attachment styles\n\nSocial, economic, political, financial, or cultural instability\n\nPsychologists generally group dysfunctional families into these categories:\n\nThe pathological family: One or both parents are dysfunctional because of mental illness or abuse. The kids are usually the adults here.\n\nThe chronic conflict family: Conflict, fighting, arguments, and disagreements (as well as stress and resentment) are the norm. The family fights in unhealthy ways, and the home environment is one of extreme hostility.\n\nThe chaotic family (severely-disturbed family): The parents abuse or neglect the kids so the kids aren’t well looked-after or protected. There are no rules or expectations, and inconsistency is the only consistent thing.\n\nThe dominant-submissive family (authoritarian family): One or both parents are a dictator, and it’s their way or the highway. There’s little to no regard for anyone in this family, with meager love efforts, no positive reinforcement, and zero support. Consequences for misbehavior or shortcomings are severe.\n\nThe emotionally detached family: The parents don’t show any love, support, or affection and can be classified as emotionally unavailable, distant, and cold. The kids suppress their emotions because no one talks about their feelings – ever – and when they try, they are shut down.\n\nWhile dysfunctional families typically fall into one of these categories, nothing is clear-cut. In Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy summarized it best: “All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” And that’s true.\n\nEvery dysfunctional family has their own unique way of being dysfunctional.\n\nI want to note that it’s common for an unhealthy family to look normal or perfect to outsiders, but of course, this isn’t always the case.\n\nAn outsider will only pick up that the family structure isn’t healthy when someone in the family “loses their cool” and the cracks start to show.\n\nOn the other hand, a healthy or functional family is one in which everyone loves unconditionally, nurtures, and supports each other.\n\nThe family has a healthy attachment style, and they work on issues in a structured and non-toxic way. The family is a home, a safe space for everyone to ask questions, feel what they feel, and challenge the norm.\n\nThe Effects of Having a Dysfunctional Family\n\nThere are various effects of living or growing up in a dysfunctional family. If one of the adults in the family tends to be mentally healthy, they, too, won’t have an easy home life – just like the kids.\n\nHere are the most common effects of having a dysfunctional family:\n\nPoor self-esteem and self-image\n\nLow self-confidence\n\nUnhealthy attachment styles\n\nExtreme shyness\n\nUnable to regulate their emotions or are emotionally unaware\n\nPoor academic or work performance as they find it challenging to focus and concentrate (or have learning deficits)\n\nEngage in self-destructive behavior, like self-harming\n\nProne to addiction\n\nMood disorders, behavior disorders, and mental health illnesses, such as anxiety, depression, paranoia, suicidal thoughts, borderline personality disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder\n\nIrresponsible and destructive or become a goody-two-shoes and extreme rule follower\n\nSeek external validation\n\nBecome withdrawn and socially isolated\n\nBecome people-pleasers\n\nHave poor communication and decision-making skills\n\n9 Common Dysfunctional Family Roles and Characteristics\n\nHere are the most common dysfunctional family roles and characteristics, but note that grouping some individuals into only one category isn’t easy.\n\nThese unhealthy family roles are flexible. Oftentimes, one family member may fit predominantly in one role but they also exhibit characteristics of another. Or, they fill another role if one of the adults (for example) isn't around.\n\nAlternatively, an individual can fit into another role when you look at larger or extended family dynamics.\n\n1. The Hero\n\nIf you think of heroes, they are the good characters in a show, movie, or book, so how can “the hero” be part of a dysfunctional family? Or rather, how is the hero also a dysfunctional family member?\n\nIn an unhealthy family unit, the hero seems to be a well-balanced, high-functioning person.\n\nThey are the example used to prove the family is doing well. It’s like this: “Well, if daddy Jack is the CEO of a multi-million company, then the family can’t be so bad” or “If little Suzie is always at the top of her class, then our family must be doing well, right?”\n\nIt’s all a facade.\n\nThe hero (tries to) proves to outsiders that their family is all right and functioning normally, despite the whole family unit being dysfunctional. They are also the individuals who understand the toxic family dynamics better than anyone else.\n\nIf the hero of the family is a child, they are often parentified and take on the role of an adult when one of the parents is unavailable.\n\nAs a child or adult, the hero feels the immense pressure to keep up the family’s “healthy” appearance and they often try to resolve familial issues.\n\nThe key characteristics of the hero are:\n\nPerfectionistic tendencies\n\nHighly responsible\n\nAn overachiever\n\nOften overworked\n\nSelfless\n\n2. The Golden Child\n\nThe golden child is the person that can do nothing wrong. They are the super kid who excels at everything, and the parents brag and revere this child.\n\nFor a problematic parent, the golden child “proves” that the family is doing great and that the parent is a good person (and parent) because such a perfect person can only be the product of a supportive, healthy environment.\n\nFor a narcissistic parent, the golden child represents everything the parent loves about themselves.\n\nIf the golden child has siblings, their parents only have eyes for the super kids. All the other kids are compared unfavorably to the golden child and found wanting.\n\nThe golden child uses their “goldenness” as an escape path – to get away from the abuse their siblings suffer.\n\nThey’ll also do anything and everything in their power to do what their parents expect and want of them because they fear rejection and abuse (should they mess up).\n\nThe key characteristics of the golden child are:\n\nNever rock the boat (“yes and amen” behavior)\n\nRule follower\n\nOverachievers\n\nPerfectionistic\n\nLow sense of self\n\nObsessively attached to others for external validation\n\nProne to nervous breakdowns\n\n3. The Scapegoat\n\nThe scapegoat (sometimes referred to as the black sheep, but they have different roles) is the person who is blamed for everything. It can be that something was actually their fault, it could be someone else's fault, or even a made-up blame.\n\nA scapegoat is routinely and unfairly blamed for everyone’s problems.\n\nA parent or a child is often scapegoated. They are bullied, cast aside, singled out, and left out, and they feel unloved, isolated, and rejected.\n\nIf the parent(s) is narcissistic, it’s common that the golden child and scapegoat are pitted against each other. This is called splitting and is a form of distraction (from the family’s real issues).\n\nThe key characteristics of the scapegoat are:\n\nUsually the most emotionally stable in the dysfunctional family\n\nAre socially awkward\n\nBecome shells of themselves or go out of their way to be socially accepted\n\nCan be troublemakers (because they are used to the blame and fallout)\n\n4. The Mascot (or Clown)\n\nThe family mascot or clown is the individual who uses humor and goofiness to “deactivate” conflict. They often draw attention toward themselves and away from the volatility of the moment.\n\nThe clown may also draw attention away from the abuse that the scapegoat or black sheep suffers with their ridiculous antics or cheeky mischief.\n\nThe lightheartedness and evasion tactics simply help the family sweep their issues under the rug, which only intensifies the toxicity.\n\nOnce the clown has successfully defused stressful and volatile situations a few times, they may feel lots of pressure to crack a joke every time there’s conflict.\n\nThe key characteristics of the mascot are:\n\nVery humorous, making jokes and teasing to defuse stressful situations\n\nAppear to be jovial, even though they have bouts of depression and deal with lots of hurt\n\nDifficulty dealing with conflict or connecting with negative emotions\n\nHighly observant about changes in a person’s body language and tone so they are ready to jump in with humor (to head off drama)\n\n5. The Black Sheep (or Identified Patient or Addict)\n\nThe black sheep of the family is also referred to as the identified patient or the addict. They are the individuals whose fault it is that the family has problems (similar to the scapegoat’s).\n\nA black sheep is an outlier – someone who is very different from the rest of the family. Perhaps they are the only person who’s left-handed, has dark hair, or is overweight.\n\nOr the black sheep thinks differently (has an open mind) or doesn’t follow in the family footsteps of working for daddy’s company. They may also be chronically sick or have a mental illness.\n\nThe black sheep is either happy to stand on their own and not be like the rest of the family or they are desperate for approval and love.\n\nThey may overcompensate for their shortcomings, and to cope, crawl into the bottle, porn, or other self-destructive behavior.\n\nThe key characteristics of the black sheep are:\n\nMay hide in addiction or self-destructive behaviors as a way of coping\n\nFeel rejected by the family\n\nVery isolated or actively seeks validation and acceptance\n\n6. The Lost Child (or the Loner)\n\nThe lost child wants to disappear. They know that being noticed equals getting into trouble, much like their black sheep or scapegoat sibling, or being in the limelight, like the hero or golden child.\n\nIn a large family, the loner child is often the middle child who just doesn’t get as much attention as the other bunch. But the lost child can be “lost” by choice too.\n\nThey may be very introverted, shy, or antisocial, and they feel shame about their family situation. If someone reaches out or gives them attention, they simply withdraw further into themselves.\n\nAs the quiet child, they prefer to spend time by themselves, hiding away from their dysfunctional family.\n\nThe key characteristics of the lost child are:\n\nLoner behavior\n\nVery independent yet indecisive\n\nSteer clear from confrontation\n\nTry to blend in or fade into the background\n\n7. The Caretaker (or Enabler or Martyr)\n\nThe caretaker is similar to the hero in that they help maintain the appearance that the family dynamic is healthy. However, the caretaker is like the fixer of the family, always supporting and affirming the toxic behavior.\n\nAn enabler has a strong sense of responsibility and ownership to help the family with their issues, and they do everything they can to keep everyone happy – even if that means denying the real issues.\n\nA parentified child or codependent adult can be the family’s caretaker, and they are always busy: cleaning, cooking, helping with schoolwork, or folding laundry. A martyr only knows who they are when they are taking care of others and helping.\n\nThe key characteristics of the caretaker are:\n\nAlways taking care of everyone but themselves\n\nHighly responsible\n\nDon’t relax easily as they are hypervigilant, ready to fix and pick up the pieces\n\nPeople pleasers\n\n8. The Mastermind (or Manipulator)\n\nThe mastermind or manipulator is the most nefarious of the dysfunctional family roles. They use other people’s weaknesses and mistakes to get what they want, whether that’s their parent’s or sibling’s insecurities or triggers.\n\nThey are masters at directing the situation to their benefit. But they do so covertly by simply pulling strings until their family members dance – just how they like it.\n\nThe manipulator switches off their emotions as a coping mechanism. They believe their behavior is justified because of the dysfunctional family dynamics they grew up in.\n\nThe key characteristics of the mastermind are:\n\nManipulative, gaslighting, and controlling behavior to get what they want\n\nMaster strategists and experts at controlling others\n\nLack any sense of guilt or concern for the well-being of others\n\nPretends to be perfect to the world\n\n9. The Peacemaker\n\nThe peacemaker is the person who wants everyone to just get along because they want to live in a happy and peaceful house.\n\nThey will either be in the center of the conflict storm, trying to calm everyone down, or they’ll be baking brownies in the kitchen, happily ignorant about the conflict in the next room.\n\nMr. or Miss Switzerland will also try to make excuses for the toxic behavior of their family members and brush it aside. They just make the whole dysfunctional dynamic worse because they gaslight and invalidate what everyone feels and experiences.\n\nThe “Oh, they didn’t mean that” is a phrase the peacemaker is very fond of using.\n\nThe key characteristics of the peacemaker are:\n\nAlways looking for solutions to calm everyone and fix the problem\n\nMediates between family members or avoids conflict altogether\n\nMay be emotionally immature and not experience feelings like others\n\nFinal Thoughts on Dysfunctional Family Roles\n\nIt’s never easy when it comes to navigating the dynamics of an unhealthy family. But when you know better, you can do better.\n\nYou can’t change your other family members, but you can identify which dysfunctional family role is yours, learn to love and forgive yourself, and decide how you’ll handle family gatherings (and if leaving or not coming is the best option for you).\n\nStill not sure your family is a dysfunctional one? Check out these 11 warning signs so you can know for sure, break free from the toxicity, and live your best life.\n\nAnd if you want more articles about family, be sure to check out these blog posts:"
