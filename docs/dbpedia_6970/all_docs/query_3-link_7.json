        "text": "Mary Poppins is of course the late great fantasy children’s musical film by Walt Disney, based on the English children’s books by P. L. Travers and with songs by the Sherman brothers. It offers a highly satisfying balance between different tonal elements: not just sprightly song, dance, and animation to appeal to children (clearly a strong American-Disneyesque component), but also deeper, subtler and darker shades encompassed in its messaging around family and work, and in its dark humour (often borrowed from its British source). I am reviewing this film, again, in relation to attention-training – a technique for improving contentment and achievement through a meditative focus on the present moment, a mindset which I argue this film incidentally advocates through its sense of wonder, its brilliant craft elements, its rejection of rationalising conceptualisations, its celebration of the “simple and true”, but particularly in its unique rejection of simplistic polarities of light and dark, good and bad. The name Mary Poppins suggests to some a sort of cutesy, moralistic decorum, linked to the trite conventionality of the very idea of a fun and inspirational nanny, but the film itself belies this unfair stereotype.\n\nAttention-training advocates an appreciation of the seemingly unremarkable present moment, and Mary Poppins encourages this through its celebration of two unassuming elements of the everyday: work and craft. The film constantly makes reference to the simple joys of work, personified in the character of Bert, a kind of street vagrant who assumes an array of humble trades: as a busker, screever (pavement artist), chimney-sweep, and kite-vendor. Bert is friendly, energetic, and genuinely happy-go-lucky suggesting the simple absorbing pleasure involved in undertaking these tasks, often commenting on the joy of the activity itself, even in the absence of monetary reward.1 The humble nature of these tasks is important because the point is primarily the joy of the task itself, not in any accompanying material purposes, fame, or the conveying of a ‘message’ (conceptual thought). Bert implies this about his pavement drawings: “not Royal academy I suppose; still – they’re better than a finger in the eye, ain’t they?”. One of the key songs sung by Mary Poppins, “A Spoonful of Sugar”, is also about finding “an element of fun” in “every job that must be done” then “the job’s a game” – a basic tenet of attention-training.2 Craft, a type of work that is associated more with artistic or hobbyist-style activities, is further advocated through the techniques used by the filmmakers themselves – the film is entirely shot in Walt Disney Studios with extensive use of complex sets (carpentry), astonishing mattes (backdrop and landscape painting), animated cartoons (hand-painted cells), and song and dance of course. Add to this the incredible inventiveness of the special effects techniques (see the Uncle Albert sequence with its use of a multitude of simple effects) and even the devising of ingenious props such as the medicine bottle and animatronic robin.\n\nEven more impressive is the way the film beautifully rides the line between pairs of opposites throughout. Attention-training suggests that right and wrong, success and failure (and other simplistic pairs of opposites) are human concepts which lead to distraction and anxiety, hiding the complexity, wonder, and enjoyment of the present moment. The film rejects simplistic opposites, exemplified in Mary Poppins herself who sings lullabies about staying awake, and is bright, friendly, and full of magical escapades, while always being practical and sensible, even rather bossy and judgemental: she issues instructions – to go to sleep, sit up properly at the table; she stops the horses from going too fast, and disapproves of “larking about”. Faced with a glorious view of the rooftops of London, she remarks, “quite nice but we should get in out of the night air.” Julie Andrews delivers the harsh and more abrasive lines with just the right degree of friendly firmness so that she is truly “never cross” and even amusing in a distinctly British way, as she tells Michael to “Close your mouth – we are not a codfish,” or, when preparing for a walk, remarking that the children are “not as well turned-out as I would like.” The Disney version of Mary Poppins has a distinct twinkle in her eye as she denies she knows anything about doing magic – something perversely missing from the books, in which she is cantankerous and vain to the point of unpleasantness, frequently gaslighting the children, and with the adverb “angrily” appearing often. Mary Poppins’ famous vanity is toned down in the film – she only needs a larger mirror because she much prefers “seeing all of my face at the same time”, she is only “practically” perfect in every way, the children request a nanny that is “fairly” pretty, and she is not above powdering her face with ash to fit in with the chimney-sweeps.\n\nSimilarly, the other characters in the film are treated with restraint and complexity, avoiding simplistic and cartoonish ‘goodies and baddies’. Mr Banks isn’t a cruel overbearing father, just emotionally repressed, preoccupied with order, and distracted – as Mary Poppins says, he is “someone we love” who “can’t see past the end of his nose”. Mrs Banks is preoccupied by her suffragette work, while remaining overly subservient to her husband. It is unclear whether the filmmakers aren’t actually mocking this feminist activity except that Mary Poppins herself is so forthright a female character, and Mrs Banks does actually attach one of her ‘Votes for Women’ sashes to the kite they fly so victoriously at the end. Even the stuffy old men of the bank are afforded some humour – recall Mr Dawes Senior straining to launch himself down one solitary step, or the melodramatic “No! Not that!” before Mr Banks is about to have his umbrella turned inside-out. In fact, the idea of beyond opposites light-in-darkness is most embodied by Mr Dawes who “died laughing”, hence Banks’ promotion delivered by the banking partners who are of course all out flying kites too. Bert encompasses darkness and light in that he lives on the “bottom-most rung” of society but ironically finds contentment there. Mary of course remarks on his “forbearance” and “sweet gentility” while he appears in the soot and blackness of the darkest part of the film (after the children run away from the bank) as a light in that darkness. The filmmakers avoid morality here too as, when Bert brings the lost children home, Jane says, “Please stay till father gets home,” not in order to reward Bert for his ‘good deed’, but because of the wonder of folklore: because Mr Banks will “feel much better when he shakes hands with you.” As he begins cleaning the Banks’ chimney, Bert corrects Michael’s misunderstanding about “the chimney-sweep world”; it’s not “dark and gloomy”, but a wondrous world of “things half in shadow and halfway in light.”\n\nThis leads us to the considerable wonder evoked by the film, as going beyond pairs of opposites often leads to the numinous.3 Wonder forms an important part of attention-training as noticing the wonder in the world around you is the easiest and most fulfilling way to cement present-moment focus. The meaning of Mary Poppins’ magic, metaphorically interpreted, is just that – wonder. This is achieved through two important factors: strangeness (or lack of explanation) and delight (or charm). Lack of an explanation is of course the same idea as that expressed in attention-training by lack of conceptualisation – Mary Poppins is strange in ways which are deliberately and never explained. Why does she float about with an umbrella? Why does she slide up the banisters? How does she get hold of Jane and Michael’s advertisement? There is enigmatic backstory too: Bert says Mary Poppins looks “as glorious as the day I met you”. (When was that?) Mary Poppins says, “Oh, Uncle Albert. You promised!” (Promised what?) “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.” (Huh?) Mr Banks asks Mary Poppins to explain herself, to which she responds, firmly but politely: “I never explain anything.” This element of unexplained strangeness is the greatest contribution of PL Travers, author of the Mary Poppins books. Disney significantly improves on the books by also including the other element of wonder: delight (of which the books are noticeably lacking4), with humour and charm throughout the film, well-judged to be not too funny (not gags exactly), and not saccharin or Pollyanna-ish: the delights of a humble “jolly holiday”, or a dance between an umbrella and a cane, of tea-parties on the ceiling, and admiring the view of the smoky, nocturnal rooftops of London.\n\nThe emotional quality of the film is heightened further by compassion, a quality aligned with attention-training as perceiving the feelings of others is facilitated by patient present-moment awareness, and selfless compassionate acts are a form of ego submission. Compassion appears in drama usually in relation to social injustice or moral causes, but here it first appears in Mary Poppins’ other key song “Feed The Birds”, a centrepiece which very much is not about feeding a bunch of grotty pigeons, for those who have ears to hear. Fitting with present-moment joy of work, craft, and beyond opposites wonder, the film focusses on compassion through humble acts of everyday kindness,5 associated only generally with religion as “the saints and apostles look down”. The central conflict of the film could be interpreted as the lack of everyday kindness and care that Mr and Mrs Banks have for their children. However, the film is not explicit about this – this would involve the children crying out for attention against more emphatically callous parents. Instead, the climax of act 2 involves the children wanting to spend their tuppence to “feed the birds” rather than as the merely instrumental and miserly “investment in the bank”. The children reject this, until they come to realise that they can actually use their tuppence in a humble act of kindness equivalent to feeding the birds – by giving it to their father at the end of the film, because they have compassion for him, because he is their father, but also because they realise he is in “a cage” himself (mostly of his own devising), surrounded by “cold heartless money”, as Bert puts it.\n\nAs with attention-training, the references here, enhanced by this being a children’s fantasy film, are not to the financial system – the filmmakers are not offering a critique of capitalism any more than attention-training suggests that earning money from employment is inherently corrupting. The message is about priorities in life (aka. where you put your attention): Is it strictly in the concept of order, instrumental ends: “cold heartless money”, – not exactly greed, as Mr Banks isn’t so corrupt – but in the “straight and narrow path” of “tradition, discipline and rules” above all else? Mr Banks has narrowed his viewpoint of reality to such a degree that he does not appreciate the present-moment wonders around him (which he calls “frivolity”); he does not listen as he “always knows just what to do”. This is why Mr Banks wants his children to learn “the seriousness of life”, life as a stressful battle, one “fraught with purpose and practicality”. In this light it is clear as to why Mary Poppins “never explain[s] anything” – explaining provides purpose and practicality, orders the world, shuts out wonder and complexity, solidifies concepts and goals, denying reality. If “the seriousness of life” means a focus on a callous, stressful, instrumental, “bread and water” existence, then “tea and cakes” is preferable, a point implied by Bert in “A Man Has Dreams”, the reprise of “Spoonful of Sugar”. This is followed by the music-only reprise of “Feed The Birds” as Mr Banks takes his night walk to the bank where he is to be let go, and in that walk he comes to his senses, taking responsibility for his son, and not out of moralistic guilt either, but in his reflection of the delights his children have brought him with their stories and jokes – to which he was not previously paying enough attention.\n\nMary Poppins thus embodies the psychological depth of fantasy; fantasy not as invented naturalism (‘Game of Thrones’) or comforting distraction (fairy stories), not as moralistic messaging (Aesop’s fables) or a celebration of ‘imagination’ (one of many problems in Mary Poppins Returns).6 Fantasy as a device for engendering the mental state in which you can clearly recognise the wonder of the world around you. To achieve this, as per attention-training, you need to slow down, focus on the present moment and avoid ignoring or overlooking it by using it for performing some mundane task, or aspirational goal, or constructing some conceptual theory. All the elements of Mary Poppins contrive to bring about this realisation – through its impressionistic painted backgrounds, its lack of a clear moral or character objectives, its beyond-opposites wonder, its sense of delight and compassion. The non-naturalistic quality of fantasy allows for passage around social-political, moralistic even logical interpretations of story, into a deeper meditative core, a new reality hiding in plain sight. Yes, the movie ends with family togetherness but also in the exhilaration of simply flying a kite. But Mary Poppins never properly says goodbye, even going so far as to say “What would happen to me if I loved all the children I said goodbye to?” She slips out quietly and floats away, which might amount to an overly cold ending (cf. the books), but the truth can be told (or at least amusingly implied) through the allowances of the fantasy genre as she has a final conversation – with her umbrella-handle that suddenly starts talking for the first and only time in the film. “I know exactly how you feel about these children,” it says, “and if you think I’m going to keep my mouth shut any longer, I’ll…” but she clamps its mouth shut saying, kindly but firmly, “That will be quite enough of that, thank you.” And she floats away, avoiding once more an explanation of the unsayable – it is too meaningful for reason, and words. As per attention-training, we are to sit with the moment as it is, free from interpretation. Overall, Mary Poppins says: Marvel at the wonders around you: in work, play, hobbies, craft, family, compassion – wonder engendered through seeing beyond binaries and cherishing the present.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1. Yes, you could interpret this cynically as suggesting that those on the “bottom-most rung” of society are naively contented with their lot – but why oh why put this in a children’s fantasy film? Furthermore, in a film set during a historical period which can have little contemporary relevance?\n\n2. Yes, the rest of the lyrics imply more a distraction through sugar-coating rather than present-moment appreciation but Poppins actually doesn’t use distraction herself throughout the rest of the film. Poppins’ use of magical levitation to make tidying the nursery more fun can be read as a metaphor, and the reprise of the song later in the film (“A Man Has Dreams”) advocates appreciating childhood while it lasts which to my mind is closer to the spirit of present-moment appreciation.\n\n3. It can also lead to lackadaisical ambiguity too – hence the importance of the emotional element in attention-training, turning attention and learning into fascination and playing (or as Mary Poppins might put it, “bread and water into (more emotional but not overly exciting) tea and cakes”). Mary Poppins is never an ‘objective’ unemotional film of course.\n\n4. Resulting in explicable strangeness alone, leaving the stories on the level of the cerebral nonsense of Lewis Carroll or the random absurdity of Enid Blyton’s Faraway Tree escapades. Some have interpreted the books as reflecting some profound mythic archetype or allegory, but a close examination of the text reveals for me an unfortunate overlap between mythic mysteriousness and just vague, undeveloped storytelling, lacking in coherence and detail. Add to this the cantankerous, rude and angry Mary Poppins, and a lack of much of the other qualities from the film, and the result is some very overrated children’s literature indeed. Even the idea that Mary Poppins brings the Banks family together is almost wholly absent from the books.\n\n5. Another quality lacking in the books: Mary Poppins curses the birds. “You ought to be in a pie!” she says."
