        "text": "In his ironically titled story, “Devotion,” Adam Haslett introduces Owen, a middle-aged man who lives with his sister in their deceased parents’ home in England, and as they both prepare for a visit from a special friend, his hidden fears and emotions are awakened. As the author reveals the intricacies of the bond between the siblings it is clear their relationship isn’t as loving and healthy as it could seem, but is instead a harmful relationship that keeps them away from a normal life in a larger world. Relying on flashbacks, letters, and symbolism to unravel the reasons Owen and Hillary live together in their parents’ home, Haslett also conveys how fear of being alone can make a person selfish and cause them to inadvertently ruin someone\n\nA familial bond cannot be broken. As genetics pass from one end of the family tree to another, a series of exchanged physical and–more significant in terms of the story–behavioral traits, moreover, make themselves apparent. From each member of the complicated maternal chain consisting of three narrators, their behavioral traits and tendencies are easily taken advantage of, along with making them prone to grievous mistakes and overall actions. The topics of betrayal and subsequent neglect are present in an almost unavoidable continuous cycle throughout Michael Dorris’ A Yellow Raft on Blue Water, as each generation of women faced a series of abrupt and unforeseen deceptions by those either in an influential position in their lives or those possessing their trust, leading to damaged and unresolved relationships.\n\nThe importance of family is not something that we can argue. Our relationships with parents, children, and siblings or the lack of such relationships have a huge impact on our lives. Similarly for literary characters, which authors present as either to have “normal” or “abnormal” relationships. Three authors whose writing published in the 20th century focuses on family as a central theme are Alice Walker, Flannery O’Connor, and Raymond Carver. A commonality between all three stories is the emphasize on the role of women within the family unit. All three short stories use different elements such as characterization, conflict, plot, symbolism and tone, but while Alice Walker and Raymond Carver present “normal” family relationships, Flannery\n\nThe film, Precious, is a powerfully charged story that delves into the family dynamics of a 16-year-old girl and her struggles to survive an onslaught of treacherous experiences. Throughout the film, the viewer is enveloped in a dramatic web of extreme situations, experienced by the main character, and those to whom she is close. The themes of domestic violence, rape, incest, drug addiction, gambling, poverty, social justice, social services, housing and education are laced together throughout the story. Particularly poignant attention is paid to various systems that help shape the experiences of the characters. The social services industry, and its associated workers, educators and administrators, set the foundation for the social themes that are highlighted by this film.\n\nDysfunction within an individual can be the result of various occurrences, whether it is a traumatic experience that has stemmed into a life of self-doubt and vulnerability, or it is a series of unfortunate events that has led the individual to believe that life is simply an ongoing controversy. However, dysfunction within a family is much more than self-afflicted stress, it is rooted within the familial bonds that gradually break as a result of conflict, co-dependent adults, perhaps substance abuse, and oftentimes a struggle of conformity brought on by an external source. In the novels Revolutionary Road and Anna Karenina, Richard Yates and Leo Tolstoy depict familial dysfunction that can occur as a result of society’s overwhelming\n\nMarried with Children aired between 1987 and 1997. The comedy television show was based on a dysfunctional American family featuring Ed O’Neill, as Al Bundy, and Katey Sagal as Peggy. In the episode, Married without Children, Al and Peggy enjoy a weekend getaway while their neighbors babysit their children, Kelly and Bud. The episode displayed some communication technologies available at the time. The Bundy’s and their neighbors had rotary phones, but cable was not available to them. A 21st century version of Married with Children would be very different than the original because of changes in technology and the way in which people communicate.\n\nJohnson provides a brief account of the novella 's plot, together with his own perspective on the fact that so much of literature and literary analysis concentrates on the relationships that the characters have. In this case, the author examines the family as composed of children of ineffectual parents. While this writer does not know this with certainty, it is possible that many cases requiring family therapy are due to this very cause. The author then goes on to discuss the family in the context of the greater social system.\n\nThe discourse of “incest” is considered almost universally as taboo and so is the study of the phenomena of sexual relations between closely related individuals in its diverse manifestations. Literary texts at length have tried to explore incest as social and psychological deviance but the discussion moves to the margins of the narrative into unspoken or rather “unspeakable” territory. The mainstream discourse prevents the writers from representing and speaking about the theme of incest explicitly. It remains restricted to a marginal space and can be understood only through a deep exploration of the individual characters and the narrative style of the text.\n\nFamily is meant to care for each other, love each other unconditionally, and support each other. Of course, as any holiday at home can prove, complete support is not always possible. Sometimes family members hurt each other and even, in worst-case scenarios, kill each other over issues as important as protecting another or as petty as fighting over a boy. In Shakespeare’s Othello, Macbeth, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, King Lear, and The Winter’s Tale, if family members operate with selfish motives, they hurt the hero and contribute to his fall; but if the family supports each other with only love, the hero can redeem himself from his fall and even succeed in finding lasting happiness.\n\nWhen a family decides to have a child, everything changes. That child becomes a number one priority. In order for a child to lead a healthy, functional life, a family needs to be strong and functional. When a family becomes dysfunctional, the most effected is the children. The children forget their children and act out which makes them difficult to live with. If a dysfunctional family, let alone the children, knew that therapy and help was available to them, more families would become healthy. In this paper, I will prove that children in dysfunctional families can self-diagnose and be encouraged to seek help and treatment so that their future can be affected by their own mistakes and not the mistakes of their families.\n\nEvery family has a unique system with a set of rules, mostly unspoken, that govern their behavior and interactions. In dysfunctional families, the symptom of their dysfunction is typically sourced within their family system. The symptom also has a function – it protects family members from uncomfortable conflict. Dysfunctional families and couples often maintain negative patterns of interacting, and are unable to transition into new behavioral patterns without therapeutic intervention. In order to help families develop out of their systematic ways of behaving, it is important to understand the specific family system that is presented. With a keen understanding of the family’s culture, beliefs, etc., the therapist can develop therapeutic rituals, which are prescribed actions aimed at altering behavioral patterns that are responsible for maintaining the symptom. The ritual is not a verbal explanation or criticism of the family system, rather it is a specific set of actions designed to help families create new patterns of interaction and meaning in their relationships. (p, 5).\n\nWhat is a family? What parts make up a family? These two questions are questions that millions of adults and children ask themselves regularly. When people think about a family in their head they think of a nuclear family. Where you have a Mom, Dad, and a few kids running around a home in the middle of a suburban wasteland. That is the nuclear family that I feel most modern families strive to be like. But factors can change within a family and still be a family. I do not believe that a family is strictly based off what people see from the front porch looking in. A family is about the everlasting bond that is formed between a group of people whether they are related by blood or by other means. A family is a group of people who stick together during hard times and good times, they laugh together and they cry together. They eat meals together, party together, are weaved together in life. They are like a strip of palm leaves, and when you weave a bunch of them together it makes a basket, that is a family. The people that someone can call at two in the morning on a Wednesday just because they can’t sleep. The ones who would sacrifice anything to help them. The bond can never be broken because the word “family” holds them together like glue to wallpaper."
