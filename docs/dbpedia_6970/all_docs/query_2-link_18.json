        "text": "This paper attempts to explore a child abuse, the reason and the effect of the character's psychological development using the theory of psychological development and structural analysis. Two approaches are used in this paper. Those are structural approach and psychology, especially developmental psychology approach. The first approach focuses on literary intrinsic elements. The second approach focuses on the character's psychological development based on the developmental stages and tasks. Those are integrated into a psychological structural analysis. The result shows that child abuse that experienced by David is physical and psychological. He got the first stage of abuse commited by his mother who didn't give him food and the last stage evidenced by some physical abuses when he lived with his mother. The primary reasons of David abuses are disciplinary patterns and he was regarded as a trouble maker.\n\nThe current study explores the effects of negative parenting on youngsters in Hosseini's novels. The main argument of the study is that negative parenting either directly or indirectly affects the behavior of their children. To analyze the novels, the researchers have used close reading techniques while applying the social theories of Dodge (1980, 1996), Lyons-Ruth (1996) and Simons et al., (2007). The study is sociological in nature. It has been observed that youngsters are negatively affected because of the behavior and their subsequent decisions. In The Kite Runner, Amir suffers, in A Thousand Splendid Suns, Mariam's life is ruined, and in And The Mountains Echoed, Pari is badly affected by the decisions of her parents. All the three novels depict that the negative attitude of the parents results in deviant and antisocial behavior in their respective children. It is concluded that parents need to be careful about their children by adopting a positive attitude towards them to be able to be good citizens of their country. The parents illustrate negative attitude because of wars, unemployment, and social pressure.\n\nIn this article, the topic is about the impact from a broken family towards the children behaviour base on the novel RAINBIRDS. The goal of this research is to analyze it under the title “An Analysis on The Impact of A Broken Family Towards The Children’s Behaviour as Seen in Novel: Rainbirds”. In the analysis, there are two methods of research; firstly, library research then taking opinion from experts to support the idea. To get the data, structural approach is used because the discussion is about the structure of story such as character and characterization. It uses the theory of B.F Skinner about behaviorism and Sigmund Freud about Id, Ego and Superego to analyze deeply about the behaviour of the characters and find out about their personality that leads to their actions. From the discussion, based on the psychology theory mentioned, Ren Ishida is mostly superego type of person because he often does something good although he was id-driven caused from his childhood experience in...\n\nGroups defined as refugees, asylum seekers, or immigrants have faced us in recent years through aid campaigns in the media or news programs framed in negative contexts like tragic life struggles, judicial cases, violence, and abuse. The political, humane, and social dimensions of the topic, being different from the world media, have taken place on Turkey' s agenda because of both its geographical and historical proximity. The way that refugees are discussed in various media circles shows that humanity in our era is still passing a serious and nasty test in terms of many concepts like freedom, human rights, equality, coexistent culture, and beyond. Being enriched from many factors experienced in real life, meanwhile, children' s books and literature on the issue of refugees' condition carry particular importance in terms of children who read being able to show empathy while gaining an awareness of this reality in the proper direction. The illustrated children' s book The Journey is worth investigating in terms of being a literary work that takes children as the target audience; includes violence, conflict, and death; and at the same time narrates a traumatic subject drawn from real life, such as being a refugee. In the study, this children' s book was chosen because of targeting small children from within similar books functioning on the same topic and, by being translated into 12 languages, for its ability to reach worldwide readership. The aim of the research is to scrutinize a realistic topic in a children' s book by arriving at the various layers forming the literary meaning of the text with the help of semiotics through the example of agents using Greimas' semiotic method and exposing the agents, the functions they explain, and the relationships among them. Greimas' semiotic method, which describes the people located in the narrative according to their function, appears to have limited use in analyses related to children' s content in the literature. No Turkish analyses are encountered that have been performed with this method on realistic constructs referring to traumatic issues in particular or that need to be told using highly attentive language for children. In the analysis, the use of combining contrasts like war-peace, fear-hope, and separation-union, in spite of the uneasy atmosphere of the literary text, was dominantly seen as an optimistic and hopeful language of expression in the story. This preferred perspective provides an appropriate expression for children to read that is far from the topic of violence.\n\nAlmighty has designed the family structure of parents and children very uniquely. Both the Children and the Parents are a heavenly gift to one another. A child is very helpless when it sees the light of the world in the first stage. Therefore, parents are entrusted with some indispensable duties so that they can remove the shakiness of a teenager. Unbelievably parents can also make their children deserted by performing certain acts in front of them. It is recognized without any doubt that children suffer terribly when their parents argue. Children go through physical, mental, and social destruction for family problems. Therefore, Parents should develop preventive methods for controlling parental problems so that the children can grow up physically and emotionally in a healthy environment.\n\nIn previous researches we have offered a panoramic view about the presence of family structures different from the traditional one in children´s literature, (Oltra Albiach, 2011), about the (shy) presence of protagonists with homo-parent, singleparent families reconstructed or intercultural in children´s titles and about the publications of these characteristics in the literature for first readers that have seen the light in recent years (Oltra Albiach & Pardo Coy, 2013). It is noted that the introduction of these literatures in initial schools remains in general a pending matter, especially if we take into account that it is an ideal level to prevent and treat stereotypes and prejudices and above all because xenophobic, sexist, homophobic behaviors and bullying in general can begin to occur at these ages. Therefore, we have tried to bring our gaze to pre-school and first cycle of primary education in order to analyze the titles that are offered to students as first readings, from the idea of the importance of literature as a mirror of the society that produces it, of its characteristics, its achievements, its desires and its fears, and also highlighting the importance of the family and affective models in general that we give the children in their first contact with the written literature. The research has been done during the course 2013/2014 in ten public and concerted schools of the Valencian Community.\n\nQualitative analysis was conducted concurrently on two subject groups engaged in the upbringing process: parents and their adult children. The narrations, analyzed “in pairs,” (n = 26) constituted the answers to the questions: (1) How did you raise your child? (2) How were you raised? The analysis of the narrations (using theory of literature devices) allowed for the isolation of elements of hidden stories (within the confines of a story within a story). As such, we considered communications containing the following information: implied and thematized – at a high level of literary communication and defined in time, told in free-flowing language in which the narrator’s distance is the smallest, as well as information which can be attributed to the addresser. Conducting discourse analysis on persons in monologue pairs allows us to compare whether the worlds presented (human activity, attributed roles, processes, states, experiences, times and places) are the same and alike."
