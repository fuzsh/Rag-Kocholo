Here his speech echoes urbanisation that has gripped America and he also expresses a typical American sentiment of longingness for the past well expressed. And the sadness of the old things “disappearing past” is deliberately introduced to effect in Scottie and in us who are urged to identify with him, a nostalgia for bygone era (Spoto 281).

Stylistic features known classically to Alfred Hitchcock movies is also what defines Hitchcock as a classic auteur, his style generates a cinematic effect which mixes effectively with his use of suspense. In returning to Cook’s discussion, she references Andrew Sarris, who argues that the “history of American cinema could be written in terms of its great directors,” (Cook, p. 411) showing the legitimacy of authorship in popular American cinema.

On a literal level it is a mystery-suspense story of a man hoodwinked into acting as an accomplice in a murder, his discovery of the hoax, and the unraveling of the threads of the murder plot. On a psychological level the film traces the twisted, circuitous routes of a psyche burdened down with guilt, desperately searching for an object on which to concentrate its repressed energy. Finally, on an allegorical or figurative level, it is a retelling of the immemorial tale of a man who has lost his love to death and in hope of redeeming her descends into the underworld.\n\nThe American Culture of the 1950s\n\n1884 Words | 4 Pages\n\nAs World War Two came to a close, a new American culture was developing all across the United States. Families were moving away from crowded cities into spacious suburban towns to help create a better life for them during and after the baby boom of the post-war era. Teenagers were starting to become independent by listing to their own music and not wearing the same style of clothing as their parents.

While many historians regard the 1950s as a time of true conservatism at its finest, it could really be considered a time of true progression in the American way of life.\n\nEssay On Cinematography Of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho\n\n559 Words | 2 Pages\n\nRegular among his works, Hitchcock opens the film with a hovering crane shot coasting over the setting of Phoenix, Arizona. Even without the mysterious, chilling soundtrack, the shot itself watched in silence evokes a timid passage into danger. In a long take it sweeps across the cityscape to build initial curiosity in the viewer, and then surpasses a curtain-drawn window into the presence of a hotel room’s trysting occupants. Immediately the viewer is called into confronting his/her discretion regarding those things we are not customarily meant to see, in such ideas as privacy and good taste. How far should the law step into a man’s world before he is discovered with reasonable certitude for engaging in illegal activities?\n\nPsycho Research Analysis Essay\n\n558 Words | 2 Pages\n\nIn the article, “Psycho at Fifty: Pure Cinema or Invitation to an Orgy?” by John A. Bertolini, he describes how the images and scenes throughout the whole movie and its more arguable parts are what made the film stick with the imagination of Hitchcock’s audience. He goes on to give an explanation of how Hitchcock is as well one of few directors who is able to mix a little humor to go along with his vicious plot. Bertolini speculates that the audience was thrown off by savagery depicted in this film and more concerned with the emotions that were created by Hitchcock’s movie. He also outlines how much controversy the film created Psycho by stating how it, “reflected the changes at work in the larger society, especially the increasing insiste...\n\nAnalysis Of Psycho\n\n869 Words | 2 Pages\n\nPsycho (1960) is filled with grisly shocks and disconcerting moments throughout this picture. A filmmaker’s film must give the ability to appeal to mass emotions and be an entertainer at the same time. Thus, famous director Alfred Hitchcock was the right individual for the direction of Psycho. Hitchcock is a veteran of adding disturbing images and frightening audiences by creating unique plot, characters, and tricking the camera. Hitchcock does this by establishing identification with characters like heroine Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and a sensitive yet perplexing antagonist Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). The cinematography in Psycho manipulates audiences across the globe by building the suspense slowly and inexorably towards the films conclusion. Hitchcock delivers the cynical picture to life by using these cinematic techniques: elements of lighting, framing, and creating tension. Hitchcock knows how to portray the perfect yet spine-chilling moments."
