        "text": "Family systems therapy is a form of psychotherapy that treats the family as a unit. It's based on the premise that, when something affects one member, it affects every other family member as well; likewise, the strength and stability of a family unit can provide support when one member needs help. Family systems therapy also focuses on the generational, social, community, and cultural factors that influence individuals and families.\n\nThis article discusses how family systems therapy works, what it can help with, its effectiveness, and things to consider and expect.\n\nThe Best Online Therapy Programs We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain.\n\nKey Concepts of Family Systems Therapy\n\nFamily systems therapy is based on the work of Murray Bowen, a psychoanalyst who developed the approach based on eight interlocking concepts:\n\nTriangles: A three-person relationship system acts as a building block for other emotional systems.\n\nDifferentiation of the self: The ability to maintain individuality. People with high levels of differentiation can pursue goals independently, whereas those with poor differentiation rely on validation from others.\n\nNuclear family emotional process: This refers to the family's emotional interactions. Patterns can include marital conflict, dysfunction in a spouse, impairment of one or more children, and emotional distance.\n\nFamily projection process: Parents sometimes transmit their problems and anxieties to their children, affecting their development and creating emotional problems for other family members.\n\nMultigenerational transmission process: People choose partners with similar levels of differentiation as themselves. Subsequent generations then show progressively lower levels of differentiation.\n\nEmotional cutoff: To manage conflicts within a family, some members distance or cut themselves off from other members. Curtailing relationships without resolving conflict can add pressure and stress to future relationships.\n\nSibling position: Bowen believed that birth order affects parental expectations, sibling relationships, parental discipline patterns, and other family dynamics.\n\nSocietal emotional process: Many things that affect families also affect societies. In turn, societal attitudes, cultural shifts, and conflicts affect families.\n\nRecap\n\nExploring these eight principles can help families establish healthy boundaries, create positive relationships, adopt positive communication patterns, and improve the functioning of individuals and families alike.\n\nTechniques of Family Systems Therapy\n\nFamily system theory suggests that individuals are inextricably interconnected to their relationship networks. Bowen believed that understanding these networks and the patterns of communication and conflict within them was essential to address individual problems.\n\nTherapies based on this theory employ various techniques to help individuals and the entire family unit, depending on the family's needs.\n\nCouples therapy: Conflict affects the entire family. Couples therapy helps partners resolve conflict and improve communication.\n\nIntergenerational family therapy: This helps families recognize patterns acquired from previous generations and learn new ways of interacting.\n\nNarrative therapy: The participant develops a story of their life that helps them understand their experiences, behaviors, and roles.\n\nPsychoeducation: Family members learn about mental health and treatment so they can respond effectively and empathetically when another family member faces a mental health condition.\n\nStructural family therapy: When people understand how their family is structured, they can work toward improving as needed and communicating more effectively.\n\nStrategic family therapy: This determines interventions to address the family's unique issues.\n\nRecap\n\nFamily systems therapy sometimes draws on other types of therapies and techniques such as couples counseling, psychological education, and other family-based interventions.\n\nWhat Family Systems Therapy Can Help With\n\nTherapy focused on families can help with many group and member issues, such as:\n\nAddiction and substance abuse problems\n\nAnger management problems\n\nAnxiety\n\nBipolar disorder\n\nChallenges caused by things such as divorce, job loss, or financial difficulties\n\nDepression\n\nDysfunctional relationships\n\nEating disorders\n\nInfidelity and divorce\n\nParenting issues and conflicts\n\nPersonality disorders\n\nStress and trauma\n\nIt also can help address conflict in relationships among siblings, parents, and children, Families and members dealing with life changes, chronic health conditions, and similar challenges often benefit from family systems therapy.\n\nFor individual mental health problems, family systems therapy often looks at how the family contributes to the onset or persistence of such conditions. If one member has a substance use disorder, for example, this type of therapy can help other members understand concepts such as codependent relationships that enable addiction.\n\nWhen family members learn about factors within the family that are related to the problem, they can then work to change their roles, communication styles, and behaviors to support one another more effectively.\n\nBenefits of Family Systems Therapy\n\nBy improving behavioral, emotional, and psychological functioning, family systems therapy can address a wide range of symptoms or difficulties, among them:\n\nBetter-functioning families: Family systems therapy helps families work in many ways. Some mental health issues respond well, family support systems often improve, and family members often gain the empathy and support they need.\n\nStronger connections: Family systems therapy promotes openness, empathy, and honesty in families, strengthens relationships, and improves communication,\n\nMore cohesiveness: Each person works individually and collaboratively to develop solutions that make the team stronger and healthier.\n\nHealthier communication: Communication problems, power imbalances, and dysfunctional patterns are identified and addressed, clearing the way for stronger relationships.\n\nCost-effective: Family therapy services were the least expensive option in a 2013 study comparing the cost of marriage and family therapy to that of individual therapy.\n\nFamily systems therapy helps prevent long-term problems by supporting families during challenges and changes. Other important benefits include strengthening relationships, improving communication patterns, increasing resilience, and encouraging supportive family networks.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nResearch suggests that family systems therapy can be an effective treatment for conditions including substance use disorders, depression, child and adolescent behavior problems, and relationship issues.\n\nIt can be effective on its own or when used as part of a multimodal treatment program for both children and adults. Attachment problems in children, eating disorders in adolescents, and relationship distress in adults are among the many issues it can address. It can strengthen family support when individuals are facing serious health issues. It's used effectively along with treatments for substance abuse in teens and adults.\n\nRecap\n\nResearch supports the efficacy of family-based interventions for a number of mental health concerns including depression, substance use disorder, relationship problems, and other mental disorders in both children and adults.\n\nThings to Consider\n\nBecause family systems therapy focuses on relationships among family members, the entire family must work together during therapy. This can be challenging when family members are reluctant, ambivalent, or resistant to treatment.\n\nFamily systems therapists remain neutral throughout treatment. This can be challenging for family members who want the therapist to provide feedback or challenge problematic behavior. From the perspective of some family members, this neutrality can seem like implied approval of certain behaviors.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nBegin by looking for a licensed, experienced therapist with a background in family systems therapy. Check online for a nearby therapist, or ask your primary care physician for a referral. Tele-health and remote services offer therapy via phone calls, text messages, video chats, online meetings, apps, and websites and apps Text-based and online therapy are convenient options.\n\nAsk a potential therapist about their training, credentials, experience in relevant areas, typical approaches, and accepted insurances.\n\nDuring your first session, your therapist will gather information about your family, problems, goals, history, relationships, and communication style.\n\nFamily therapy typically lasts an average of 12 sessions, depending on the family's needs.\n\nGet Help Now\n\nWe've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, BetterHelp, and ReGain.
