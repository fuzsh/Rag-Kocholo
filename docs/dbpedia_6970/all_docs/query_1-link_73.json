        "text": "Little Miss Sunshine is about the dysfunctional Hoover family. Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) is an overworked mother who is trying to make everyone happy. Sheryl's brother, Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) is a gay and scholar of Proust, who temporarily moved in with her after attempting suicide. Sheryl's husband, Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) is a Type A personality man who strives to build a career as a motivational speaker and life coach, he loves winning and hates losing. Sheryl's fifteen-year-old son, Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a Nietzsche-reading teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he can accomplish his dream of becoming a Pilot.

I think Dwayne’s response to finding out he is colorblind is very understandable because it was a dream of his to become a pilot and to find out he can no longer become one is heartbreaking. I think there was a history of trauma in Dwayne’s life that influenced his response to losing his chance at becoming a pilot because Richard made him feel like a failure for taking a vow of silence. A relevant environment factor that affected Dwyane’s development, functioning, and behavior is Nietzsche philosophy, becoming colorblind and screaming the “F” word in the middle of a field after finding out, and then Dwayne offers expression of what he’s learned in his hero’s journey of"
