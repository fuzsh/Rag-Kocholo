        "text": "She possessed a vibrant and vivacious personality and spoke her mind freely from childhood; friendly, sharp-witted and outgoing, she made friends easily, however she never hesitated to express to loved ones exactly what or how she thought they should handle a situation. This of course as everyone knew was regardless of her opinion being was solicited or not. This no doubt was the result of growing up as the baby of the family. Mary grew quite accustomed to getting her own way with her older siblings, Marvin and Corinne and growing up, surrounded by a bounty of loving family members; aunts, uncles and cousins.\n\nMary Hutchinson was by far the most glorious and loving person through-out the novel, and loved by all that knew her, “We all loved one another but somehow every one of us had a special work with Polly. She was so bright and cheery and brave” (Pg.7). She was a young seamstress who lived a simple life, making an honest living and was very close to her loving family. She had been pursued by her co-worker the young Jack Wilson, who fall in love with her (or so she thought), but it was normal for people to be attracted to her beautiful nature. After years of courting they had finally gotten married and had children of their own, although the second would not be born until the “father” I say vaguely had left the country. This once highly sought after woman would now be left to care for two young children while her husband moved countries to find work (not to mention flee embarrassment). This was the moment that would change her life for the worst, only she hadn’t known it yet.\n\nAs shown in the cartoons/ads, women/suffragettes were depicted as plain, commandeering, domineering, and lazy and not working for their family and its' greater good. I believe that they feared the unknown and change, as all do when times of social movements occur, from the fight for women's rights, to African American rights, and through today's fights for LGBT rights. Feminism has a negative connotation, in some circles and with some people, because of a targeted negative connotational campaign and attitude towards the word, term, and movement. Feminism literally means, ''the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes''. There is no man-hating, no man-shaming, no man-attacking within it. If you believe that women should have the same and equal rights as men - congratulations. You're a feminist.\n\nBefore having kids, everyone has an idealistic fantasy of what type of parent they are going to be. Will they be a Mary Poppins or a Mommy Dearest? These two women parented in very different but similar ways. Mary Poppins used an authoritative approach to parenting whilst Mommy Dearest used an authoritarian approach. Authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles are the most widely used styles in modern day parenting, with authoritative parenting being the one with the most positive results in terms of child development. They are similar in what parents expect from their children but differ in the way that parents respond to their children’s needs. The effects of the chosen parenting style can be seen in the way that a child feels about themselves and how they interact with the outside world.\n\nWhen she enters the bedroom, her voice changes from present to past tense and she starts to reminisce and begins to talk about her mother and aunts. She seems happy to remember her mother’s room and introduces her aunts to the audiences. Mary delivers her dialogue saying that the dressing table and the small elephant statue figures are all same. When Mary gently touches her mother’s photo, she delivers a sad tone. Her performance conveys to the audiences that she misses her mother. The tone of her voice represents that she is a gentle, innocent and a loving child. Her verbal and non-verbal interactions conveyed the viewers with a message that she is an orphan.\n\nLooking at the surface of the films The Fox and the Hound and Monsters Inc, we probably would not see any similarities whatsoever. This is hardly the case once looking past the animated animals and monsters. The Fox and the Hound, which was released in 1981 by Disney, portrays a fox named Tod and a hound dog named Copper. Even though they grew up together, they are socially supposed to be enemies. They do overcome this stereotype at first as they become best friends and vow to forever. In the end of the film they stay friends, but end up living separate from each other. Each one living in the world that is socially acceptable to each animal. Similarity, Monster Inc., which was released in 2001 by Disney and\n\nFrom the beginning she is very demanding of what she expects and wants in the work partnership of her being the Banks’ nanny. She does what she pleases with the kids despite Mr. Banks’ wish for structure. Once again, on the surface, the independence seems desirable and accepted by Mr. Banks, but there is an underlying message being displayed that is only seen when one is analyzing the movie. On a more subtle note, Mary Poppins is characterized as being vain and flirtatious. She puts up mirrors in her room and makes comments of how attractive she is. On a tape measure that gives personality characteristics she measure at “practically perfect” while everyone else’s measurement displays a flaw. Mary Poppins also has a male friend, Bert, that she is very touchy with, and seems to lose all intelligence in front of him. She becomes a giddy school girl around her crush. This gives a message that independent women are promiscuous and immoral; a description that holds a very negative connotation. It makes the lifestyle seem very unappealing. This could be highly influential for the audience viewing the film at the time it was released. During that period women were finally gaining the right to contraceptive (Walsh, 2010). The women who did partake in the contraceptive were still part of the minority. With “Mary Poppins” giving the message that being a women of liberation has a bad label it could lead women in the opposite direction of keeping the accepted norms. This shows how rooted inequality is in a society because of the many institutions of socialization that are present, in this case, the\n\nThroughout the years there have been many versions of the classic tale, “Cinderella.” From European style all the way to Disney. However, they are all based on the same ancient story. Step mother, step sisters, Cinderella marries the love of her life, you get the idea. Yet, each individual story has its own unique touch to make it stand out just a little bit more than the previous story. The two Cinderella stories that I’m going to be comparing are two Disney films. The first one I am going to discuss was released in early spring of 1950, called “Cinderella”. The second story is a remake called, “Another Cinderella Story” released in 2008. Both films based on the same story line, yet completely different.\n\nNot only are the themes present for the readers, but they contribute to the character evolution of the dynamic personage: Mary. Themes such as the quest for immortality, man vs. society, man vs. self, the experience of alienation, and the character’s role as a hero are the universal truths which can be examined and elucidated in this text. In conjunction with these themes, readers fathom the maturation of Mary because the themes attribute as reasons to the discovery of Mary’s identity in her society. Motifs such as man vs. society, vs. self and the experience of alienation are correlated to one another and evident in the text. For example, quotations \"No, I - I don't care.\" (7). “Mary knew what they were talking about. Her neighbors’ conversation, otherwise not troubling, might at any moment snag itself on this subject...causing her to look despairingly out of windows..trying to find some wonderful explanatory to bring it to a stop” (4). Mary is benevolent because of her thoughtfulness towards Mrs. Fullerton and her consensus on the demolishment of her own home. She doesn’t believe in destruction causing stability. The hesitancy present in Mary’s voice suggests the exposure of immense amounts of societal pressure inflicted upon her. She is frightened to defy the social norms and what must be done in the context of building the lane through Mrs.\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, feminism is defined as the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism is a major part of the short story, “The Story of an Hour” by Kate Chopin, which is a story that portrays women’s lack of freedom in the1800s. Women had no rights, and had to cater to all of their husband’s needs. The main character in “The Story of an Hour” is a woman who suffers from heart trouble, named Mrs. Mallard. When Mrs. Mallard was told about her husband’s death, she was initially emotional, but because of her husband’s death she reaped freedom and became swept away with joy. The story is ironic because Mrs. Mallard learns her husband was not dead, and instead of exulting\n\nWhat does it mean to be a Feminist? Does it automatically mean you hate men or does it mean you're an activist for women's rights? Contrary to popular belief, feminism is not about establishing a superior gender. It is about fighting for equality and destroying the social, cultural and historical norms set upon women throughout the world. The Twenty-first century has brought change and growth to female empowerment. Although, in many parts of the world women are given the same rights as men, they are still treated and viewed inferior to men. G.I. Jane perfectly illustrates the struggle women have gone through, even when given “identical” opportunities as men."
