        "text": "This is why I’ve created a 12-step Self-Hero program that looks at your particular flavor of trauma and past baggage through the lens of Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy, a holistic, non-pathologizing, evidence-based psychotherapeutic approach developed by Richard C. Schwartz, Phd. This program can be used alongside your personal therapy, the ACA program, or on its own depending on where you’re at and what works for you.\n\nThis blog post is Part 1 of a 3-part Self-Hero series that will be your introductory road map to the journey of becoming the loving hero of your own story.\n\nI’m going to be tackling questions like:\n\nWho are adult children of alcoholics and dysfunctional families (ACAs)?\n\nHow do you become an adult child?\n\nHow to know if you’re an adult living with childhood trauma?\n\nWhat are the underlying root causes of childhood trauma impacting you right now?\n\nIf you’re already an ACA fellow traveler, I’m writing this for you. I’m dedicated to giving back to all the adult children of alcoholics and dysfunctional families out there committing one step at a time (if you’re anything like me one breath at a time) to healing your traumas, emerging out of your secret life of fear and into a life rooted in your self-care and self-love.\n\nIf you’re just learning about adult children or wondering if you’re an adult child, I’m writing this for you too. I’m dedicated to guiding you. You, my friend, are at the brink of discovering that there’s a whole other safe, loving world out there and inside of you waiting to be seen, heard, known, and felt by you.\n\nI’d like to start with a confession.\n\nWhen I was 16 years old, my cousin who was 10 years older than me was in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). And I was so jealous of him. Let me explain. We spent a summer together in our tiny mountaintop village in Southern Greece near Sparta (yes, that Sparta) where there were more olive trees than people. There we would lose all concept of time as we sipped our beachside iced coffee or ate our mountaintop lamb chops talking about life, suffering, purpose, and what it really means to change. I couldn’t name it at the time but in retrospect we were also talking about our traumas.\n\nI can’t say that “trauma” was on my radar as a 16-year-old teen but I was definitely on trauma’s radar. She followed me wherever I went (even in places that looked like paradise) and sucked the color out of my world leaving me in a grey, muted version of reality. I was using whatever strategy I had to escape her. Dissociation, numbing, and obsessive compulsive strategies were top of the list. But she would wait for me at the pit of my belly reminding me through a stinging, burning, piercing sensation that she was still there. A relentless, stalker poltergeist stabbing me from the inside. I’ve got to admire her persistence.\n\nDid anyone else feel like this? Or was it just me?\n\nMy cousin was like me only that he used to drink to escape. Now he was fighting his battle with his trauma poltergeist with a newfound perspective, a community, a mission, the structure of 12 steps, and a spiritual lens through which to navigate the world. Everything I wanted to escape from, the shame, the vulnerability, the pain of being so lost I couldn’t pick my own self out of a police lineup, he was facing alongside other brave souls and survivors of trauma. He shared the Serenity Prayer with me and my jaw dropped. I fell to my knees gasping. I wasn’t even religious but I wanted that. All of it. Maybe (or most definitely) not the alcoholism part. But everything else.\n\nOk here it goes. I’m embarrassed to admit this….\n\nBut for the sake of being real—a small part of me actually wished I was an alcoholic so that I could belong to this AA world. Or at the very least I wished there was a program for people like me that I could work. I didn’t even know what that would look like or be like.\n\nSomething inside me deeply resonated with people showing up for themselves and one another as they traveled a clearly defined path with guideposts (as any good Type A personality would dream of). I wanted to climb out of my rock bottom—also known as exorcise the trauma poltergeist from the pit of my belly—and come to believe that a power greater than myself could restore me to my sanity.\n\nRestore me to feeling safe.\n\nRestore me to not feeling lost.\n\nRestore me to not being in pain.\n\nRestore the color in my world.\n\nRestore me. Period. Full Stop.\n\nFast forward 12 years later. It’s winter in Athens.\n\nIt’s Tuesday night. I’m sitting alone at the corner cafe drinking my cappuccino showered in my preferred inordinate amount of cinnamon while a Coldplay song plays in the background. I’m on the phone with my dear friend and soul sister Kristina. I’m writhing in pain like someone took my soul, froze it, and shattered it into a million pieces with a pickaxe. I’m having what can only be described as an “emotion seizure'' although I’m pretty sure I could feel every cell of my body physically shaking. I’m in a public place of course so I’ve got to keep it all under wraps. Fortunately for me, the lighting was dim and I was seated at a back table.\n\nI’d just had another falling out with my family in New York.\n\nOne that had me leave NY yet again and move back to Athens. One that had me feeling stupid for trusting them again or trusting that things could be different. One that triggered the abandoned, neglected, abused inner child parts of me that I lovingly refer to as emotional orphans. As if that wasn’t enough, my family thought I was “crazy” (disclaimer: their word, not mine). If I was at a different place in my life, chances are there would be a big, loud part of me doubting my own sanity.\n\nGaslighting, anyone? Not here. Not now. Mercifully.\n\nSo I’m on the phone with Kristina. To be fair, she’s more on the phone with me as I vent and purge all my insides onto her. Then the seven words come out of her mouth that would change my life, “Maybe you should look into this website?”\n\nIt’s the official website for Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families. Before she could say another word, my laptop’s open and I’m scanning the entire website and literature of the program.\n\nI fall into what’s referred to as the pink cloud.\n\nI feel the trauma poltergeist at the pit of my belly loosen up her grip just enough for me to experience a real sense of hope and possibility.\n\nMaybe there IS another way to live.\n\nMaybe, like my cousin in AA, I too can have a newfound perspective, community, mission, 12 step program, and spiritual lens through which to navigate the world.\n\nMaybe I don’t need to become an alcoholic to belong to the AA world (or any world for that matter).\n\nMaybe I AM an adult child and this program is for people like me.\n\nMaybe, and just maybe for this once, I got what I wished for. A real way out of my pain and back to myself. Not escaping. Not numbing. True freedom. Power. Belonging. Self-love.\n\nSign me up yesterday, please.\n\nAs I sit here now writing this at 6 in the morning, a part of me wants to send a shoutout to Kristina, my loving, fierce, supportive fellow traveler who’s witnessed me at my worst and best with equal kindness and her signature no bullshit attitude. None of this would be possible without her.\n\nSo Who Are Adult Children Of Alcoholics And Dysfunctional Families?\n\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like to time travel? I have. And then I realized I don’t have to wonder. I’m time traveling all the time! And you probably are too. I noticed throughout my healing journey that whenever I was “triggered” or overwhelmed by someone or something, I was mentally, emotionally and physically time traveling to the past. Similar to a flashback.\n\nCase in point. I had to make an important business decision a few years ago. I became so overwhelmed by a little voice that said, Who am I to make this decision? I don’t want to have to do this. I can’t do this. What voice was that?\n\nI went inside and recognized it as the voice of 5-year-old me.\n\nShe was in the driver’s seat and thought she had to navigate this situation. I’m sorry to say but I don’t think 5-year-olds should have that level of responsibility when it comes to making business decisions. Or any decision for that matter. No matter how bright or lovely they are.\n\nThe same is true for when I’m time traveling to the future. When I'm projecting myself into the future playing out the worst case scenarios (sound familiar?), I'm still time traveling to the past.\n\nYou may be thinking, What kind of crazy, mind-bending inner physics is this? I know I would.\n\nI was troubleshooting all the ways any business decision I made could go horribly wrong leaving me poor, desperate, and homeless. I went inside and again recognized that 5-year-old in me. I was seeing my future worst case scenarios through her anxious eyes. Past me was in the driver’s seat again. As an adult with clarity and calm, I could see that the numbers in any scenario just didn’t add up to “poor, desperate, and homeless.”\n\nNumbers don’t mean anything to an anxious 5-year-old of course. I get where my 5-year-old was coming from. It was an important business decision that would have long-term consequences. But it wasn’t a life-or-death situation even though to her it felt like it. Because let’s face it—poor thing has been through a lot.\n\nThis is the textbook definition of an adult child.\n\nWhen confronted with a situation that makes us feel vulnerable, we time travel to a stage in our childhood. According to the ACA Big Book:\n\nThe term “adult child” means that we respond to adult interactions with the fear and self-doubt learned as children. This undercurrent of hidden fear can sabotage our choices and relationships. We can appear outwardly confident while living with a constant question of our worth.\n\nIn the Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy world, we say that a part “blends,” which means it takes over the driver’s seat just like my 5-year-old self did. We’re traumatized and these parts of us are effectively stuck or frozen at the time and place the childhood wounding occurred. We end up using the survival strategies they learned back then and there.\n\nI can’t tell you the number of times my clients have been overwhelmed and, after doing some inner work, we come to realize that my clients are in fact NOT overwhelmed. Inner child parts of them are stuck in the past blending, making them time travel to a time and place where survival strategies were limited to say the least.\n\nThis happened with a client who argued with her partner constantly. She came to realize her 10-year-old self was defending the needs of a 38-year-old grown woman to her 40-year-old husband. Can you imagine how strange, disorienting, and hopeless it must’ve felt for a 10-year-old to advocate for a 38-year old woman’s need to be heard for god’s sake?\n\nAnother client of mine was trying to make a decision about whether or not she wanted to have a baby. She later discovered that her 12-year-old self was in the driver’s seat. Can you imagine how confusing and scary it must’ve been for a 12-year-old to decide “to baby or to not baby” on behalf of a 34-year-old woman?\n\nIf you’ve had a childhood where abuse, neglect, or emotionally absent caregiving were present, then chances are you have a constellation of parts stuck in the past that to this day are working overtime to help you survive. We can acknowledge, appreciate, and honor these parts because back then and there it worked. We survived after all.\n\nHere I’d like to circle back to my trauma poltergeist.\n\nRemember the one that was sucking the color out of my world, stalking me, living in the pit of my belly, and stabbing me from the inside?\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Plot twist ahead!\n\nWhat appeared all along to be a “villain” or “inner demon” that needed to be confronted and vanquished ASAP was not that at all. The trauma poltergeist is a young part of me carrying my trauma or childhood wounds around.\n\nShe’s a wounded inner child who was stuck like a bug in amber. I know her now. She lived in the pit of my belly screaming out for a chance to release all the hurt she’s been carrying for years and even decades. Her blending with me and making me time travel to the past was my default state.\n\nThat’s the hard truth about being an adult child. Blending with parts, time traveling to the past, experiencing flashbacks, using survival strategies learned as a child--however you want to call it--this is our autopilot. Our norm.\n\nI’m here to tell you that there is another way to live. You CAN heal your childhood wounds. You CAN help these parts of you go from using survival strategies to thriving strategies. Trauma is not a life sentence. Trauma resolved can be a gift.\n\n“Trauma is hell on earth. Trauma resolved is a gift from the gods,” as founder of Somatic Experiencing and Trauma Expert Peter Levine, Phd. says.\n\nMore on that in Part 3 of this Self-Hero Series where I’ll lay out the 12 steps to heal from childhood trauma. First you have to understand a bit more about how this all happens.\n\nHow Do We Become Adult Children Of Alcoholics Or Dysfunctional Families?\n\nWell we have to have an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family, for one thing. “Dysfunction” exists along a continuum and can range from experiencing physical, emotional, sexual abuse and/or extreme neglect on one end to inadequate or insufficient caregiving marked by emotionally absent or overwhelmed parents on the other. When I say “parent” I’m referring to any caregiver who took on the role of parenting.\n\nYour parents could land somewhere on this continuum and struggle with extreme addiction or compulsions. Or not. Chances are belittling, threatening, shaming, hateful, critical, and/or indifferent behavior by your parents was part of your everyday life as a child. Perhaps your parents served you up a combination platter of physical, verbal, and emotional abuse on a bed of perfectionism sprinkled with controlling and all-or-nothing thinking, and a side of criticism with extra harshness. You probably received the message, “Don’t talk. Don’t trust. Don’t feel.”\n\nI’m not very comfortable with the word “dysfunction” and neither are many of my clients. The prefix dys- stems from the ancient Greek word for ill, bad, diseased, abnormal, or faulty. This is not a compassionate or accurate view of our own struggles or those of others. Your parents are also adult children after all.\n\nThey too were time traveling to the past while raising you as a result of their unresolved trauma. They too must’ve felt like a 10-year-old responsible for the physical and emotional well-being of a toddler having a full-on meltdown between the cereal and cleaning detergent aisles at the supermarket with all eyes on them. This in no way is meant to excuse, minimize, or rationalize away the abuse or neglect that you experienced. My intention is to offer a greater context that overtime can be clarifying and shed a forgiving light on yourself, especially the parts of you that have had less than stellar moments as an adult in the process of trying to survive.\n\nThe bottom line is that we become adult children because our parents were adult children whose lives were driven by fear.\n\nThat’s why I firmly believe that one aspect of our purpose as adult children is to become chain breakers. To become one more healed person in the world and to model for future generations (whether you have kids or not) what it means to be born in the belly of the beast, claw your way out by the skin of your teeth, and move on to have a thriving life not in spite of but because of your childhood wounds.\n\nOne of the ACA mantras is “Keep It Simple.”\n\nAnd I always have to ask myself, “What if I could make this easy for myself and others? What would that look like?” To find the real way out we have to understand how we got here in the first place. For simplicity’s sake here, I’d like to dig a little deeper and talk about what all of our childhoods have in common. The common denominator of childhood trauma so to speak.\n\nThe childhood of an adult child is marked by wounds of abandonment, powerlessness, and worthlessness. I call these three primal wounds because they strike at the heart of our Being-ness, our right to Be as human as they come. Our right to Be and feel alive and aligned with our life force.\n\nThe Two Dilemmas Of Adult Children Of Alcoholics And Dysfunctional Families\n\nYour turn again. Can you guess which option your young, tender brain chose this time around?\n\nIt’s much easier to believe that you’re bad and deserve to be treated poorly.\n\nAre you surprised by this answer? Think about it.\n\nIf you’re bad and deserve this (whatever “this” is in your case), then you still have power and control. It means you can get better and change how others treat you. It means you’re still an agent in your own life. And it means that your parents are safe so it’s also safe to belong. It’s just you who needs to change. In a genius yet twisted way it’s a hopeful escape route out of this dilemma. Your little brain back then and there was trying to protect you by preserving your power and belonging. Even if it meant temporarily losing access to your worthiness by taking on the belief that you’re bad or deserving of neglect or abuse. Chances are you also took on the belief that worthiness was something you had to achieve, be given, earn, buy, or be deemed by something or someone outside of you.\n\nAs a member of the Walking Wounded Club (aka high achievers, perfectionists, brave-face wearers who are ALSO survivors of childhood trauma), you may have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility for others’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. You may have a hard time knowing where someone else ends and you begin. Striving and perfectionism can feel like recurring yeast infections that don’t go away regardless of how many probiotics you take. You may have boundaries that shape shift between loose, slimy floating jello and rock solid, sky-high fortresses. You may be a people pleaser on the one hand and an angry, ruthless fire-breathing dragon on the other. Work may consume you to the point of burnout.\n\nYou have strong, dedicated protective parts that took on survival strategies focused on controlling and manipulating the external world. Their intention was to minimize the impact of the abuse and neglect and maximize the chances of experiencing belonging, worthiness, and power. Together they developed layers of high tech, AI-level protective armor undetectable to the human eye. This armor can be so impenetrable even YOU are unaware of your primal wounds. In the meantime, your inner child parts are suffering the injuries of abandonment, unworthiness, and powerlessness deep in the abyss.\n\nI’m going to be putting oour protective armor as adult children under the microscope to help you unlock and understand the survival strategies, core fears, and primal wounds your inner system developed in Part 2 of this Self-Hero series. The more you understand about your internal family system and childhood trauma, the more you can embrace your capacity for loving connection and authenticity. The more you can claim your power and become the loving hero of your own story.\n\nIn Part 3 of this Self-Hero series, I’m going to deep dive into the 12 Self-Hero steps that you can take to heal your wounds, recover your innate belonging, worthiness, and powerfulness, let go of fear that keeps you stuck in survival mode, and discover your thriving strategies. These steps will be informed by the evidence-based, Internal Family Systems Therapy approach.\n\nTake a deep breath to check in. If it feels right for you, invite your attention inside. Does this resonate with you? What’s going on inside your body? Is there a sense of lightness, softness, tingling, expansiveness, upward movement? If it does, your next step is to book a free consultation with me."
