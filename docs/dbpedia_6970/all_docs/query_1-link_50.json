        "meta_description": "This small realistic gem, set in an upstate New York town, looks deeply and empathetically into the  loving but strained relationship between Sammy (Laura Linney), a single mother with an 8-year-old son, and Terry (Mark Ruffalo), her wastrel brother, who returns home  after serving a jail sentence. The two share a special bond, having lost their parents in a car  crash when they were children. Matthew Broderick is Sammy's stuffy new boss at the  bank where she works as a loan officer. The tensions that erupt may not be the most  melodramatic domestic problems ever filmed, but they're the stuff of life, and Linney's and Ruffalo's performances are achingly perfect. â€” Stephen Holden",

        "text": "For all the bullying inspirational slogans hurled at us about never giving up on your dream, following your bliss and today being the first day of the rest of your life, the fact remains that most people's lives run on fairly narrow tracks. And in the real world, as opposed to self-help fantasyland, once you find yourself on a track, it's awfully hard to get off, even if it's headed nowhere in particular.\n\nThe way so many lives coast along on familiar but frustrating paths is one of the themes of ''You Can Count on Me,'' the perfectly pitched directorial debut of the playwright (''This Is Your Youth'') and screenwriter (''Analyze This!'') Kenneth Lonergan.\n\nBecause it arrives near the end of one of the most dismal film seasons in memory, this melancholy little gem of a movie, which won two major awards at the Sundance Festival, qualifies as one of the two or three finest American films released this year. If nothing better comes along between now and the end of December, it could reap some more honors.\n\nWhat distinguishes ''You Can Count on Me'' from almost every other recent American film is its modesty. Although visually handsome, it is about the furthest thing from an event movie and would fit as comfortably on television as it does on the big screen. Its biggest strength is a steadfast integrity that sharpens as the story goes along. Steering clear of the shrill melodramatic confrontations and kitschy spiritual uplift that Hollywood routinely confuses with profundity, it proposes no pat solutions for its characters' problems. One significant character, a likable but cautious young boy, is the refreshing antithesis of the psychically gifted, problem-solving superchild that is becoming one of Hollywood's most obnoxious cliches.\n\n''You Can Count on Me'' is an exquisitely observed slice of upstate New York life that reminds us there are still plenty of American communities where the pace is more human than computer-driven. The movie dares to portray small-town middle-class life in America as somewhat drab and predictable. Without ever condescending to its characters, it trusts that the everyday problems of ordinary people, if portrayed with enough knowledge, empathy and insight, can be as compelling as the most bizarre screaming carnival on ''The Jerry Springer Show.''\n\nThe two main characters, Samantha and Terry Prescott (Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo), are a grown-up brother and sister who reunite after not having seen each other for some time. Samantha (known as Sammy), a single mother with an 8-year-old son, Rudy (Rory Culkin), works as a loan officer in a bank in the fictional New York town of Scottsville. A quiet, slightly wilted place with a sleepy main street whose vitality hasn't entirely been co-opted by shopping malls, it is a typical middle-to-working-class New York State community. Country music dominates the local jukeboxes, and the soundtrack serves up a generous helping of Steve Earle's country-rock.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
