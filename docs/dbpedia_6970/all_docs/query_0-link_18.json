        "text": "02:01 pm - Mary Poppins as Parable of Parenthood\n\nAs a parent of a four-year-old daughter, I have seen the movie Mary Poppins many times. Not always all the way through, because what A. really likes are the songs. But I was watching the film downstairs at the in-laws' house with A. and her cousin S. yesterday and a thought percolated in my head that I've had before: that there is a commentary on parenthood in the movie.\n\nThe plot of Mary Poppins goes something like this: the two Banks children, Michael and Jane, have run their past four nannies ragged, causing them to quit. Their parents, George and Winnifred, don't pay much attention to them. George, as characterized by his song \"The Life I Lead,\" is a banker, cool and aloof to his kids, as he believes he should be (\"a British bank is run with precision, a British home requires nothing less\"). Winnifred is too interested in her political activity as a suffragette (which she downplays or hides from her husband) to take an active role in raising the kids.\n\nSo, along comes Mary Poppins, who becomes the new nanny and engages the children and their imaginations. Along the way, they meet street urchin Bert, who is Poppins' friend. Magical hijinks ensue.\n\nPoppins encourages George to take the children to the bank. He does. Along the way, Michael sees the bird lady on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral and wants to buy a bag of birdseed with his tuppence. George says no. He brings them in the bank, where Michael is coerced to give his tuppence over to the bank for savings. He demands his money back, they won't give it to him, and there is a run on the bank. In the commotion, the children get away. They are convinced their father is out to get them. They find Bert out in the street. This is a scene I'd like to return to in a minute.\n\nBut first, Bert brings the children home. George and Bert have a conversation about Mary Poppins. I'd like to return to this, too. George is fired from the bank, but afterwords, he sees his life differently. He tells an impertinent joke (that Michael and Jane told him) to the doddering patriarch of the bank and leaves, stuffing the tuppence in the banker's hand. He comes home and repairs his children's kite and they go out to fly a kite. The wind has changed, so Mary Poppins leaves. But we see that the Banks household is healed. George now sees the value of being involved in his childrens' life. And furthermore, he learns that the old bank patriarch died laughing after hearing the joke. The banker's son is now president and reinstates George as a junior partner.\n\nIn short, the movie is about the perils of being uninvolved in your children's life.\n\nAs a father, there is a lot that I relate to in the movie. At first, I see George Banks as a parody of the distant father. He is clueless as to what is happening under his own nose and when a problem arises, he misdiagnoses it and charges in with the absolutely wrong solution, heavy-handed and authoritarian. After all, \"a British bank is run with precision...\"\n\nBut then, when Bert finds the children in the street, he has this conversation with them:\n\nBert: Let's sit down. You know, begging your pardon, but the one my heart goes out to is your father. There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day, hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money. I don't like to see any living thing caged up.\n\nJane: Father in a cage?\n\nBert: They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know. Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.\n\nJane: Father's not in trouble. We are.\n\nBert: Oh, sure about that, are you? Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you. And Mary Poppins, and Constable Jones and me. Who looks after your father? Tell me that. When something terrible happens, what does he do? Fends for himself, he does. Who does he tell about it? No one! Don't blab his troubles at home. He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent.\n\nMichael: He's not very silent!\n\nJane: Michael, be quiet. Bert, do you think Father really needs our help?\n\nBert: Well, not my place to say. I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help. Come on, I'll take you home.\n\nThis gets to the heart of the problem of modern fatherhood, with its expectations that men should be the breadwinners, and yet we should also be involved in our children's lives. The working world is not always very kind to families, and the needs of families. A home life is a distraction that takes away productivity.\n\nSo then, George talks to Bert:\n\nGeorge: Do you know what she did? I realize it now. She tricked me into taking Jane and Michael to the bank. That's how all the trouble started.\n\nBert: Tricked you into taking the children on an outing?\n\nGeorge: Yes.\n\nBert: Outrageous! A man with all the important things you have to do. Shameful! You're a man of high position. Esteemed by your peers. And when your little tykes are cryin' you haven't time to dry their tears / and see them grateful little faces smilin' up at you / because their dad he always knows just what to do\n\nGeorge: Well I mean, look, I, I don't think I ca-- -\n\nBert: Like you say, guv'nor. You've got to grind, grind, grind at that grindstone / Though childhood slips like sand through a sieve / And all too soon they've up and grown / And then they've flown / And it's too late for you to give / Just that spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down / The medicine go down / Medicine go down Well, good-bye, guv'nor. Sorry to have troubled you.\n\nSo here George realizes how he has misread Mary Poppins. He thought she was filling his children's heads with useless whimsy, when in fact, she was helping them to see their place in the world around them. And he, in turn, better sees his place in his family."
