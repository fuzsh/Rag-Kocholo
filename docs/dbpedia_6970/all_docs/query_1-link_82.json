Join http://www.WatchMojo.com as we count down our picks for the top 10 most dysfunctional in movies. For this list, we've picked dysfunctional families from the big screen based on the criteria that the families are not extremely dark with things like incest, physical violence, and murder as a part of their everyday interactions, so groups like the Corleones from “The Godfather” and the Joneses from “Precious” don't count.\n\nSpecial thanks to our users MultiPearl007, Nichelle Phoenix Perez, Andrew A.
