        "text": "Nobody should go through what I have been through. I’m Dora Rivkina. I am 19 years old and am the second out of three girls to be born into a Jewish family. My sister Liesl is three years older than me. I look up to Liesl. She is my role modle. There is no movie star or pop star that can ever top her. My sister Elaine is two years younger than me. Sheis still learning to speak German because my parents tought her how to speak English first. She looks up to liesl also. We act like liesl and try to dress like her. Both of my sisters are really smart and are good at figuring things out.\n\nBut, although we are siblings, we are very different in this sense. Presently, I still do not know what I want to be or where I want to end up, even with the help of courses such as Civics and Careers. My dad often lectures me about knowing what I want to be so that I can plan the future out. Moreover, my sister is a very extroverted person, whereas I am introverted. She is very social and not shy at all towards people she does not know. I, on the other hand, am very shy and not good at speaking in public. My parents often scold me for being so shy and quiet and tell me that my sister got to where she is because she was so social. In particular, the largest expectation that was passed onto me from my sister is academics. For the entire time that she attended school, she was always excelling in all her classes and never had any difficulties. Consequently, when I started to go to school, my parents had the same expectations for me. Although my marks were relatively high, they were always low compared to what my sister had gotten. My parents always expected more of me and pushed me to be exactly like her\n\nWhen most people hear my full name , “Joann Botani,\" they automatically assume I'm Italian, but truth is I am actually Middle Eastern. From what I know my dad does have a little Italian in his blood but the name “Botani” actually comes from a city in Turkey. I come from an upper-middle class house hold and I have two younger siblings, a brother and a sister. Being the oldest has its challenges because there is so much expected from me whether it is school, work or social life. I tend to think my younger siblings have it easier because I am the one who pushes the boundaries with my parents and because of that my siblings usually get to do what ever the want because it is not as extreme as what I do. It has always been easy for my younger sister because she is the “princess” of the house but I am my dad’s favorite while my brother is a momma’s boy. My family is very competitive when it comes to school and grades, my little brother and I were always duking it out\n\nIn all of our lives there are goals we have, values we possess, and strengths and weaknesses that make us who we are. All of us, no matter if we are a jock, or a brain, someone who succeeds in education, or someone who wants so badly to get out, face barriers in our lives. Some of us come from broken families, some us of come from abusive situations, but all of us have a unique and individual story. At the heart of this story are the struggles we have experienced, the people we have associated ourselves with, and the lessons we have learnt along the way. Such can be said about my own life, and the lives of the characters from the Breakfast Club. The characters from the Breakfast Club that I feel most represent me are: Claire Standish (The\n\nThe film The Breakfast club illustrates how a person’s identity can be influenced by conflict he or she has experienced. First, Claire Standish she gets everything she wants, her dad treats her like a princess and she can’t do anything on her own. For example , She skipped school to go shopping but her dad didn’t really care cause he used to all ways get her out of Sunday detention but this time he couldn’t. Everybody looked up to her like she was god because she was pretty and had popularity. Andrew Clark he can’t really think for himself because his dad was mainly running his life as if it was his because he wanted his son to be like him. For instance, Andrew taped some kids booty together everybody else thought it was\n\nIn life there are a number of challenges that everyone will go through. This is a part of discovering who they are and what they want to do with themselves. To help explain these differences, Erikson introduced his development theory. This helps to address some of the challenges and needs that person will go through at particular stages in their lives. To fully understand these phases there will be a focus on two characters from the film The Breakfast Club and contrasting them with Erikson's theory. Together, these different elements will provide specific insights that will highlight the transformations and challenges that everyone will go through during the course of their lives.\n\nFamily Guy, an animated sitcom about a New England family and their everyday dilemmas, is a way for viewers to see the comedic side of a dysfunctional family. The Griffins consist of Peter and Lois, the patriarch and matriarch, and Meg, Chris, and Stewie are the children(Family Guy). Every character is different from the next character. They are also weird in their own way. The television show itself displays feminism, structuralism, and gay and lesbian criticism. Each character in the show also displays those criticisms in a certain fashion. Family Guy can be offensive to viewers with its satire, and the way the show delivers its message can make the family and the other characters in the show seem dysfunctional.\n\nWhat is family in your opinion? Family can be a source of support, compassion, optimism, love and happiness, but family can also be a cause of depression, betrayal, hurt and pain. Family is not always determined based on having the same DNA but it is the relationships that people can make or have with one another. Family can consist of several different people like, friends, co-workers, classmates, a community, etc... Some family members can be your worst enemies because they have the most information of secrets to bring a relative down. Being able to trust a person, depend on them, and be carefree is a person that can be valued as being a part of a family. In the movie Little Miss Sunshine, their dysfunctional family is loving, supportive, optimistic and motivating.

The beginning of the movie Richard, the father is giving a motivational speech about winning, he states “There are two types of people in this world, winners and losers”.(Little Miss Sunshine) Richard is a protagonist motivational speaker that is obsessed with winning. He is so consumed with achieving that he ridicules his family for not being perfect throughout the film. Richard trying to build up the ideal life or what he thinks is the ‘American Dream’ around himself. He chooses to ignore aspects of the life around him that he sees as unacceptable or out of sync with his ideal lifestyle, trying instead to fulfil his role as the authorative head of the family and provider. Sheryl is the mother who is optimist, she is always giving words of encouragement even when Richard is trying to bring down his family and she is all about being truly honest. Frank is the brother of Sheryl whom at the beginning attempts to commit suicide due to a broken heart and losing his standing as Americas pre-eminent Proust Scholar. Dwayne is the son of Richard and Sheryl and is committed to joining the air force. He also is very committed that he takes a vow of silence until he gets into the air force, but then he finds out he is color blind and breaks his\n\nI have 3 siblings; two brothers and one sister. My sister “Isha-27”, Little brother “Ishmael-10”, and my older brother “I.B-18”, we all grew up and spent the most of our lives with each other.
