        "text": "Jeri Jacquin\n\nComing to theatres for Christmas from director Ridley Scott and TriStar Pictures is the true story of greed and kidnapping when you have ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD.\n\nJohn Getty II (Andrew Buchan) and wife Gail (Michelle Williams) are raising their children under the shadow of being related to the richest man in the world, J. Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer). When their finances become difficult, Gail suggests that John write a letter to his father and mend their relationship.\n\nTo their surprise, Getty sends a telegram asking them to come to Rome and for John to work with him. The older Getty takes a liking to his grandson Paul and encourages him to be a part of the family business and spending time learning about their history.\n\nAs the years pass, John falls hard into drugs and Paul (Charlie Plummer) is brought back home to Gail. The relationship with the elder Getty is back to where it was before and they all have little contact with him. Paul has a wild side and he tends to come and go as he pleases and Gail doesn’t know how to deal with it.\n\nOne night, as Paul walks the streets of Rome, in an instant he is kidnapped. Gail receives a telephone call informing her of it and that she is to pay a hefty ransom. Reaching out to Getty, she does not get the response of a grandfather concerned about his grandson but instead, the response of a penny pinching old man.\n\nGetty does one thing however, brings in Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg) to work with Gail in trying to locate who might have Paul. Working with the Italian police, Chase isn’t sure he is getting the whole story about the kidnapping or the family.\n\nPaul deals with the kidnappers, especially Cinquanta (Romain Duris) who believe that the ransom will be paid. Phone call after phone call begins to anger them as Gail tries to explain that it is not she who has the money.\n\nThis is what happens when greed meets a man with an iron will because one way or another – everyone is going to pay!\n\nWilliams as Gail is a mother who knows the dynamics of the family but isn’t about to let her son die. It would be easy to see that she might be considered a tad cold but I also understand her more than I thought I would. As each phone calls comes in and each new threat is given, Williams thought process is quite clear.\n\nWahlberg as Chase is a man who clearly has worked with Getty on other issues but this one is different. Trying to understand why Getty just plain refuses to participate in what is clearly a serious matter stuns Chase. Wahlberg’s character begins to invest more of himself in what is happening and doesn’t care what his employer thinks. He puts on his usual badass and makes it known that what is right is right – no matter how much money you have.\n\nDuris as Cinquanta is a kidnapper with a weird conscience. Between a rock and a hard place, it is clear he knows the difference between right and wrong. I’m not defending the guy in the slightest but Duris gives the character his moments.\n\nThere are two winners in this film and both of them have the last name of Plummers. First, Charlie Plummer as Paul is a young man who was going through life with a strange chip on his shoulder. There is a disconnect with his parents that just has him feeling as if nothing can touch his free spirit. He is also smarter than his kidnappers give him credit for. Plummer’s performance is everything I’d expect and still pleasantly surprised.\n\nChristopher Plummer as J. Paul Getty is absolute and stunning perfection! From the moment he is on screen, Plummer portrays the richest man in the world with such a range of non-emotion emotion. What I mean to say is when he is angry you know he is although he’s not screaming, when he doesn’t care about something it is clear that it’s not on his to-do list and when it comes to money he clearly can talk about it with such believeability that it’s jaw dropping. Plummer has always been on my list of performers to watch but in ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD he deserves an Oscar!\n\nOther cast include: Timothy Hutton as Oswald Hinge, Marco Leonardi as Mammoliti, Giuseppe Bonifati as Giovanni Iacovoni, Nicolas Vaporidis as Il Tamia, Andrea Bodini as Corvo, and Guglielmo Favilla as Piccolino.\n\nALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD is a journey through this family’s story in the middle of a kidnapping heard round the world. I knew about the young boy being taken but there is so much more than I didn’t know. That’s what makes this film even more interesting is that it kept my attention with one jaw drop after another.\n\nIt is an interesting look inside a family that proves money doesn’t buy happiness. The performances are brilliant but, as I said, it is the two Plummer’s that steal the entire film. Director Ridley Scott delivers with solid storytelling and gives us a thriller, drama and suspenseful look deeper inside a true story.\n\nIn the end – J. Paul Getty had a fortune and everyone else paid the price!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to theatres from director Jason Bateman and Starz Digital Media comes a look at a dysfunctional family like none we have seen before because they are THE FAMILY FANG.\n\nThis is the story of the Fang family led by Caleb Fang (Christopher Walken), wife Camille (Maryann Punkett), daughter Annie (Nicole Kidman) and son Baxter (Jason Bateman). As the kids were growing up they learned that their parents were not quite the stereotypical Mom and Dad. No, the Fang’s were performance artists who consistently tried to shock and awe the world with their film making.\n\nYears later Annie is now an actress trying to find the roles that would give her some satisfaction but instead made a name for herself as a basket case. Baxter is now a writer and with one successful book and a second not-so-much, he is in the middle of writers block in a very over due manuscript.\n\nWhen Baxter’s agent gives him a chance to do an article, he sees it as a paying gig and does it. During the interview Baxter is injured and ends up in the hospital. Much to his distress the nurse says they called his parents to come and get him. In a panic he calls Annie begging her to rescue him from the clutches of the nutty parental units.\n\nGoing home again isn’t easy for either of them and within the first day they are each trying to find a way to run! Trying to make the best of things both Annie and Baxter actually slightly participate in their parent’s wacky new attempt at their art. When the day ends badly, Caleb tells the kids that he and Camille are off to the Berkshires for the weekend.\n\nThinking they had hit the jackpot, Annie and Baxter are relieved to see them go. One day later they receive a telephone call from the police saying their parent’s car has been found at a rest stop and there are signs of foul play. Annie immediately believes it is another stunt but Baxter isn’t so sure.\n\nNow they both look back to look forward at what has happened to the parents they couldn’t wait to get away from!\n\nBateman as Baxter once again performs brilliantly. This actor has the amazing ability to draw an audience in with his straight faced wit and delivery. As Baxter, Bateman portrays a man stuck in the affect the Fang artistry has had on him. Knowing his parents aren’t exactly normal, he doesn’t really know what normal is! It takes stepping back and looking at those family moments that gives him clarity to go forward. The final scene with Walking and Punkett made my jaw drop because in real life someone’s jaw would be dropping and not in a nice way!\n\nKidman as Annie is a ball of anxiety! Watching this character start out a hot mess means there is no way to go but up and Kidman does just that. She becomes super-sleuth and it consumes her but for reasons she isn’t ready to face. Taking a brother who doesn’t seen that interested in finding his parents on her journey, Kidman spells out every step of her reasoning and isn’t going to let these parents get away with anything. In the same final scene with the parents, I really enjoyed watching Kidman give Annie what she needed to stand up for herself.\n\nPunkett as Camille is a surprising character to watch. Believing in the art, she supports Caleb and the audience will be shaking their heads thinking ‘what is wrong with this woman letting Caleb just run amuck?’ Trust me, that was my thought as well but Punkett is intriguing to watch from start to finish.\n\nWalken as Caleb once again turns in such an amazing performance. The character of Caleb is such a domineering personality in a family that goes-along-to-get-along and never really sees the damage he is causing. Truly believing that he is right in his ideas of art, he doesn’t give much leeway in letting his wife and kids have an opinion about anything. I have always said that Walken has the ability to sell ice to an Eskimo and playing the role of Caleb is no exception. Caleb’s rants are so heartfelt and strong at the time until the dust settles – and it settles all over the family!\n\nOther cast include: Marin Ireland as Suzanne Crosby, Michael Chernus as Kenny, Josh Pais as Freeman, and Linda Emond as Miss Delano.\n\nTUBS OF POPCORN: I give THE FAMILY FANG four tubs of popcorn out of five. I truly love this film because it is a mesh of comedy, drama, family dynamics, dysfunction, emotions, lack of emotions and realizations. In the first few frames I was wondering what the heck am I watching? Catching me off guard is a good thing because it only leaves every moment after riveting to watch.\n\nTHE FAMILY FANG has put together a cast that pulls off the twists, turns and quirks needed. Bouncing off one another there isn’t any one person that stands out when all four are on the screen and, the same is said when it is Bateman and Kidman on the parental hunt. They all make it work so beautifully and I enjoyed every moment of it.\n\nIf you are looking for a film that pushes the norm in family dysfunction yet still resembles your family, then hit the theatres this week to experience THE FAMILY FANG for yourselves. Actually, you might walk away appreciating your own family nuttiness.\n\nIn the end – the Fang’s dysfunctionally perform one frame at a time!"
