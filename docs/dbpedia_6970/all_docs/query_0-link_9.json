        "text": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2140373/?ref_=rvi_tt\n\nA film that I recently saw was Disney’s Saving Mr. Banks, directed by John Lee Hancock and starring Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks. Originally, I thought the film was simply going to be about the making of the Disney classic Mary Poppins. However, by the end of Saving Mr. Banks it is clear to the audience that there was more behind both films than a simply children’s story. The film really stuck with me and I think that warrants an analysis of it on the blog for this class! Plus I’m a huge Emma Thompson fan.\n\nSaving Mr. Banks tells the story of how Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) got the rights to produce Mary Poppins, which originally was a British book series written by P.J. Travers (played by Emma Thompson). It took Disney twenty years to get the rights from Travers, who only agreed because she needed the money. However, she insists on being part of the screen writing process before she hands him over the rights. Through flashbacks to Travers’ childhood, we learn that she did not have an easy childhood. Her father had a hard time holding down his jobs as bank manager because of his alcoholism, which he tried his best to hide from his children. It’s made clear to the audience that Mary Poppins is in fact based on Travers’ aunt, who comes to help her family.\n\nOne major theme that I notice while watching Saving Mr. Banks, and also realized is a central theme in Mary Poppins as well, is the role of the bank. Banks are generally seen in society as being large corporations that screw people over. Travers’ father works for a bank and there are flashbacks throughout the movie that show him at the bank and at company gatherings. In both of these instances, he humiliates himself because he is drunk and in turn breaks promises to his family. In Mary Poppins, Travers made the family the Banks family. Mary Poppins comes to rescue them because they are a disconnected family, especially in regards to the father figure Mr. Banks. During the film, Mr. Banks consistently chooses work over his family, in particular, not mending his children’s kites when they are broken. By the end of the film, he denounces his job at the bank, fixes the kites, and sings “Let’s Go Fly a Kite.”\n\nI think without central themes like this, that tie into both stories, Saving Mr. Banks would not have been as effective. By showing the audience the real struggles that went into both the book and movie versions of Mary Poppins, it allows us to find a whole new meaning in a classic kids movie. I had previously disregarded Mary Poppins as just that. Thanks to Saving Mr. Banks, I now have a new appreciation for the real life struggles of these people."
