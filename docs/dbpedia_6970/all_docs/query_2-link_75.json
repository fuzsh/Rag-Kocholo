        "text": "Most people have a vision of what they imagine would be the ideal family environment and society, for children to grow and develop in. Most of us don't have clear, specific ideas about this, or know if it's even possible, but we know that what is available now, is not adequate. Most people think, and professionals are certain, that these two environments, are for the vast majority of people, dysfunctional, injurious, and obstacles to healthy growth and development, and happiness.\n\nIt seems to me that every one that is serious about the meaning and outcome of their life, would factor in their attempt to understand and plan how they should live their life, the priority of things that must be considered, and accepted. It seems to me that the most important reality to establish is, does God exist, and if he does, how do I determine my relationship with Him? In that regard, it seems that the law of cause and effect would be most fundamental to be considered. How do we make sense out of the vast, elaborate, complex reality that we are surrounded by? Is it at all reasonable to believe that all that we are aware of, including ourselves, has somehow come into existence on its own, or spontaneously?\n\nPaulo Freire was one of the most influential philosophers of education of the twentieth century. He worked wholeheartedly to help people both through his philosophy and his practice of critical pedagogy. A native of Brazil, Freire's goal was to eradicate illiteracy among people from previously colonized countries and continents. His insights were rooted in the social and political realities of the children and grandchildren of former slaves. His ideas, life, and work served to ameliorate the living conditions of oppressed people. This article examines key events in Freire's life, as well as his ideas regarding pedagogy and political philosophy. In particular, it examines conscientização, critical pedagogy, Freire's criticism of the banking model of education, and the process of internalization of one's oppressors. As a humanist, Freire defended the theses that: (a) it is every person's ontological vocation to become more human; (b) both the oppressor and the oppressed are diminished in their humanity when their relationship is characterized by oppressive dynamics; (c) through the process of conscientização, the oppressors and oppressed can come to understand their own power; and (d) ultimately the oppressed will be able to authentically change their circumstances only if their intentions and actions are consistent with their goal.\n\nEXPLORING THE PHENOMENON OF TRIGGERING EVENTS FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE EDUCATORS MAY 2000 KATHRYN HELEN OBEAR, B.A., WASHINGTON COLLEGE M.A., THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY Ed.D., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Professor Maurianne Adams The quality of interactions between facilitators and groups is critical to the success of social justice educational experiences. Given the importance of these interpersonal dynamics, it is curious that there are few references and no research studies in the literature that explore the phenomenon of triggering events for facilitators and trainers of diversity awareness and social justice educational experiences. The results of this study will help to fill this gap in the social justice education literature by describing the types of situations in which educators feel triggered, the ways they respond to triggering events, and the core competencies and strategies that help educators use triggering events as “teachable moments” that further parti...\n\nHumanistic and transpersonal psychologies have eclipsed a focus solely on pathology assessment and treatment to a broader focus on the human being&#39;s growth toward optimal functioning, often called self-actualization. Paradoxically, Maslow recognized that peak experiences often lead the self- actualizing individual to transcend the personal concerns of the very self that was being actualized. The ego moves away from focusing on its traits and toward a consolidation of identity. Qualities associated with higher stages of ego development are very similar to qualities associated with spiritual transformation: a consistent sense of presence, an authenticity, and a lightness or ease of being. Descriptions of people functioning at an optimal level include increasing flexibility, conceptual complexity, and tolerance for ambiguity; recognition and acceptance of internal contradictions; a broader and more complex understanding of the self, others, and the self in relation to others; inter..."
