This document summarizes work conducted as part of the UNDP/GEF Danube Regional Project to develop an approach for assessing land use and its impact on water ecosystems in the Danube River Basin. Key activities included developing a land use assessment methodology, selecting three pilot sites in Croatia, Romania and Slovakia to test the methodology, and holding stakeholder workshops at each site. The methodology was tested at the pilot sites and recommendations were developed for each site as well as general policy findings. The work aimed to better understand the linkages between land use planning, water interfaces like wetlands and floodplains, and integrated river basin management.",
