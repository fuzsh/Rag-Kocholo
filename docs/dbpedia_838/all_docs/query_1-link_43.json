        "text": "Organic farming uses sustainable production systems, diversified and balanced to prevent environmental and harvest pollution. In this paper I wish to highlight the opportunities arising from the practice of sustainable agriculture and the efficient management of natural resources in Romania. Sustainable rural development can be achieved with the transition from subsistence agriculture to organic agriculture by building and strengthening competitive small and medium enterprises in rural areas. For this we analyzed empirical data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Rural Developmen and the National Institute of Statistics.The analyzed period covers the years 2006-2011. The organic food market in Romania is contoured by statistical methods and the opportunities and limitations incurred by those who choose this form of exploitation.\n\nRomanian agriculture issues have been analyzed and discussed in numerous studies and professional articles. Agriculture is an important sector for Romania, given the large agricultural area owned; the sector can contribute to the qualitative transformation of the Romania’s economy. Studies on agriculture and its role in the economic development of a country are numerous and highlight the importance of agriculture for any economy. Starting from the features of the Romanian agriculture and considering the current European context, this paper presents the situation of the Romanian agriculture and the main courses of action for rural development in order to improve work efficiency in the Romanian agriculture.\n\nRomania prepares to enter the European Union in a period of hardship, when the Union questions its configuration and essence. Thus, Romania does not have to confine itself at the tasks required for the successful adoption and implementation of the acquis in the field of agriculture and rural development, but to actively take part in the process of reforming this sector and to promote its own interests. The first part of the study is an overview of the current situation in the Romanian agriculture sector and an analysis of its main structural problems. Following the conclusions is made an analysis of the possible strategic options, for the development of the rural competitiveness, by means of a new approach such as diversifying the rural economy. In the end, the study proposes different measures to Increase life standards in rural areas by means of diversified economic activities to be translated in successful rural development experiences and taken into consideration when designing future national programs for stimulating rural development.\n\nThe role of agriculture is an extremely important one because it provides the necessary production of foods for the population and, at the same time, represents a source of raw materials for different processing industries. For a growing population, agriculture has been the main source of agri-food products that must ensure the food security of the population. Compared to other states of Europe, Romania is one of the European countries with the most favourable soil and climate conditions for agriculture. The last world crises, from the crisis in 2008 to the pandemic crisis in 2020-2021, and especially to the current conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, have brought up the issue of food self-sufficiency. During the current period, it is important to know what production can be obtained in Romanian agriculture and if it can provide the food necessary for the population. An analysis regarding the dynamics of the cultivated areas and production of the main crops in Romania has been ...\n\nIn last decade, the Romania’s regional agriculture has become the main driver of development through absorption of EU funds. According to official data of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Romania has reached 84% (or 12.85 billion euros) in the field of EU absorption funds for agriculture and rural development programmes during 2007-2013. According to the latest EU statistics, in Romania agricultural sector has a high importance in ensuring income through self-employment, while diversification of rural economy remains challenging. Most people engaged in agriculture are self-employed and agriculture accounts for only 3.2% in the total number of the employees in the Romanian economy. The paper intends to assess the stage of development of agriculture in Romania by regions, based on a quantitative analysis, using both national and European statistics. The results of this article show regional disparities of agricultural development in Romania and the need for central a..."
