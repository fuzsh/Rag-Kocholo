Transboundary management as the RBMP will be the Moldovan puzzle pieces out of 3 in total for the water policy in the Whole Prut basin shared with Romania and Ukraine neighbours 2. River Basin Management Planning following the European standard (WFD) for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) 3. Water body delineation and monitoring their status (good or bad) 4.

THE DANUBE, PRUT AND BLACK SEA RIVER BASIN DISTRICT PROGRAMME OF MEASURES of the RB MANAGEMENT PLAN (planning cycle II - 2022-2027) EUWI+ provides support for in Republic of Moldova Implemented by European Union Water Initiative plus for the Eastern Partnership19.11.2020 5\n\n6. PROGRAMME OF MEASURES, CYCLE II (2022-2027) 19.11.2020 6 The Programme of Measures (PoM) is a final component of the Management Plan made to respond to the pressure / impact analysis, risk assessment and assessment of the condition (status) of water resources backed up by the monitoring data. The main purpose of the Programme of Measures is to achieve environmental objectives, reaching the good water condition (good water bodies status), and therefore defines a set of actions to achieve, maintain and/ or improve the water situation.\n\n7. PROGRAMME OF MEASURES, CYCLE II (2022-2027) 19.11.2020 7 № Identified environmental issues Established environmental objectives Proposed Measures 1. Ecosystems Prevention of further deterioration of current state of surface and groundwater. Implementation of several measures, following prioritization scheme. The most important measure can be selected, according to identified pressures. 2. Quality / Health Progressive reduction of pollution. Monitoring program improving (both surface and groundwater bodies); Improving and construction of wastewater treatment system; Elaboration of technical solutions regarding the use of sludge from the treatment plants. 3. Quantity / Governance Ensuring the sustainable management of water resources. The creation of wetlands; The creation of protection riparian strips; Prevention of unauthorized use of water resources; Abstractions control; Efficiency and reuse measures, including promotion of technology with efficient use of water in industry and economical irrigation techniques; Recovery of costs for water consumption. Pressures → Objectives → Measures\n\n8. PROGRAMME OF MEASURES, CYCLE II (2022-2027) 19.11.2020 8 Environmental objectives for surface waters • the objectives of “good status” (ecological and chemical) will be achieved in the planning cycle of 2022- 2027 for 37 out of 128 surface water bodies; • For 91 water bodies it will need more time than one 6-year cycle to reach the good status and deepen knowledge of their state and causes of degradation.\n\n9.

OTHER MEASURES PROPOSED BY PARTICIPANTS: 19 respondents have mentioned some additional issues: • Rational use of water resources, while respecting good neighborliness. • The need for a strategic program in the country related to the protection of drinking water and drinking water reserves per capita for the next 50 years. • Urban and territorial planning around the river basin for the planting of energy species and the arrangement of these areas, renting the water fund for the development of inter-community partnerships, at national and international level in the fields of rural community development • Statistics for 10, 20, 30 years on the volume of rainfall water / m2 in the region. • Production of organic products. • Creating drought and disease resistant varieties using No Till technologies. • Active promotion in society of the rules of waste management and drinking water resources, through the media, street advertising, etc. 37"
