Its aim is to study the theory and practice of dialogue between all types of sciences and any religious background understood provisionally as meaningful interaction and exchange between people (often of different social, cultural, political, religious or professional groups) who come together through various kinds of conversations or activities with a view to increased understanding of both these two ways of human reasoning, scientifical and religious/spiritual."
