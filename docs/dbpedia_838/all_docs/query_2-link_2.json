        "text": "Korea Russia Friendship Bridge Bridge between Russia and North Korea\n\n0 0\n\nrank #1 ·\n\nThe Korea–Russia Friendship Bridge (Korean: 조선 로씨야 우정의 다리; Chosŏn–Rossiya Ujŏngŭi Dali, Russian: Мост Дружбы; Most Druzhby) is a rail bridge over the Tumen River. It was commissioned in 1959 as a replacement for a temporary wooden bridge. It is the sole crossing point on the 17 km long North Korea–Russia border. Planks are laid between the tracks making crossing of road vehicles possible by special arrangement, but it is primarily a rail bridge. The tracks are dual gauge because the Russian railroad system uses a track gauge of 1,520 mm () while the North Korean system uses 1,435 mm (). The bridge is served by the Khasan railway station on Russian soil and Tumangang Station on the North Korean side of the river.\n\nVictory Bridge, Yerevan Bridge in Yerevan\n\n0 0\n\nrank #4 ·\n\nThe Victory Bridge or Haghtanak Bridge (Armenian: Հաղթանակի կամուրջ Haght'anaki kamurj) is an arch bridge for traffic linking across the Hrazdan River in Yerevan, Armenia. It connects the Mashtots Avenue in the east with the Admiral Isakov Avenue in the west. It was opened on 25 November 1945 and named the Victory Bridge to commemorate the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany at the end of World War II.\n\nValakampiai Bridge Bridge in Lithuania\n\n0 0\n\nrank #5 ·\n\nValakampiai Bridge (Lithuanian: Valakampių tiltas) also known as Valakupiai Bridge (Lithuanian: Valakupių tiltas) is a bridge across Neris River, that connects Žirmūnai and Antakalnis districts of Vilnius. Built in 1972. As of 2007, it is the longest bridge in Vilnius, 341.5 metres long and approximately 21.0 metres wide. The bridge has six spans: the major one, 100.0 metres long is over the river, the second one is on the left bank and four-span viaduct is on the right bank. It is made of ferroconcrete blocks, connected by wire fibers into inseparable ferroconcrete beams.\n\nVanšu Bridge Bridge in Riga, Latvia\n\n0 0\n\nrank #6 ·\n\nThe Vanšu Bridge (Latvian: Vanšu tilts) in Riga is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Daugava river in Riga, the capital of Latvia. Its name literally means Cable-stayed bridge and is also sometimes translated as Shroud Bridge. 595 meters in length, it is one of five bridges crossing the Daugava in Riga and passes over Ķīpsala island. It was built during the Soviet period and opened to public use on 21 July 1981 as the Gorky Bridge (Latvian: Gorkija tilts) after Maxim Gorky street, today renamed Krišjānis Valdemārs street, which it extends across the river.\n\n0 0\n\nrank #7 ·\n\nMoscow-Riga Railroad Bridge is a concrete arch bridge that spans Moscow Canal between Tushino and Shchukino Districts in northwestern Moscow, Russia. The bridge does not have an official name and is sometimes styled as Railroad bridge over Moscow Canal. It was completed in 1936, designed by A.S.Bachelis.\n\n0 0\n\nrank #8 ·\n\nThe first stage of Moscow Metro opened in 1935 terminated at a shallow alignment Smolenskaya station. The second stage (opened in 1937) started with a 1.4 kilometer westward extension from Smolenskaya to Kiyevskaya, a station serving the Kiyevsky Rail Terminal, which required a river crossing. Tunnel crossing was impractical; an open contest for the bridge design was held in spring 1935. Yakovlev brothers won with a relatively modest, reserved prototype. Actual bridge was built without planned statues and portico."
