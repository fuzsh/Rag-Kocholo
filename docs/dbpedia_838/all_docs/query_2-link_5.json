        "text": "1. Go Fish! The Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union and its effects on the United Kingdom and Norway Amy N. Durbin George Mason University April 2012\n\n3. What is the Common Fisheries Policy? A supranational policy that was created to manage the fishing industry in an effort to preserve traditional fishing patterns and diffuse tensions of the EU Member-States with heavy fishing sectors. There are eight elements to the policy with three specific rules about fishing practices. • Fishing Effort Limitations • Total Allowable Catch/Quotas • Technical Measures Maria Damanaki, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Commissioner Image: http://europa.eu/newsroom/calendar/event/id/2764/mode/standalone\n\n4. Regulation of the CFP • European Fisheries Control Agency – Vigo, Spain – Coordinates fisheries inspection control and inspections by each Member-State • Regional Advisory Councils – 7 councils, 5 based on geography, 2 for pelagic stock • Multi-annual plans – Sets goals for specific fish stock to ensure maximum sustainable yield\n\n5. Regional Advisory Councils Image. http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/partners/regional_advisory_councils/index_en.htm\n\n6. The United Kingdom and the CFP • Around 25,000 people are employed by the fishing industry in the UK • UK registered vessels must maintain a real economic link with a UK population dependent on fisheries and related industries (through various ways) • Scotland is concerned over the reforms leading to a cut in fleet size and jobs • Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has been critical of the current CFP • UK responded positively to the 2009 Green Paper • “Hugh’s Fish Fight” http://www.fishfight.net/\n\n7. Norway and the CFP • Jointly manages stocks in the North Sea, partners in coastal state agreements on herring, blue whiting, and mackerel in the Northeast Atlantic • Norwegian law conflicts with EU law regarding discrimination based on nationality, non-nationals in Norway aren’t allowed to own more than 40% of a fishing vessel • Management based on limited entry, TACs and individual vessel quotas • Regulatory system is more streamlined, clear chain of responsibility and accountability • Norway notes that the EU’s CFP is fragmented with no level- playing field between key actors\n\n8. Problems with the CFP • Lack of focus regarding objectives of sustainability • Unacceptable levels of discards • Fleet overcapacity, overfishing, too large TACs • Lack of reliable data to asses the stocks • Slow development of aquaculture in the EU • Issue of micro-management from Brussels\n\n9. 2012 Reform Objectives of the CFP • Clarify the objectives of the CFP • Enhance consistency of the policy initiatives • Preserve marine ecosystems and stop discards • Promote the development of aquaculture • Develop multi-annual plans based on an ecosystem approach • System of transferrable quotas • New EU fund for fisheries and maritime-affairs\n\n11. Conclusion • Members of the Commission, the scientific community, Member-States all talk about regionalism and preventing discards, but not the measures taken to ensure compliance • Compliance has been a difficult task because it has largely been left up to each Member-State to ensure that the fishing rules were be applied • The UK, especially Scotland, has a large fishing community, sharing waters with third-countries which will have an impact on the Member-State as polices will have to be merged • Norway may want to begin the accession process again, but only if there is a competent and fully functioning fisheries policy in place • If all goes well, the new Common Fisheries Policy will be in effect January 1, 2013"
