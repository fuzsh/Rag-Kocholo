        "text": "\"Many changes in political affiliation during last centuries caused that East European countries are inhabited by many minorities. Nowadays the national minorities are quite important part of different societies but they have also different functional possibilities. In different countries they have different legal status which influence on their situations. Nowadays Poles are the largest national minority in Lithuania (about 235 thousands people of 3 millions population) with many organizations. In opposite Lithuanian minority is not so large in Poland (about 8 thousands people of 38 millions population) but they also have got their own institutions. The presentation will be a comparison of the demographic, political and legal activity and education of both national minorities. In the other hand it will be a comparison of contemporary situation of both nations in opinions of the leaders of Polish organizations in Lithuania and Lithuanian organizations in Poland. It will be based on empirical researches. The conclusion of the presentation will be assertion if and how the different legal, demographic, institutional situation affect on the behavior of Lithuanian and Polish national identity and on the relations with the inhabited country and the nation. \"\n\nThe ubiquitous concept of resilience has opened new perspectives also in the field of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA), and is fostering inclusive approaches, such as the social-ecological one, engrossed in the adaptive capacity of a system to adjust to a specific environment. In such an approach, the availability and use of resources becomes pivotal in differentiating structural (hard) and functional (soft) resilience; to lower vulnerability to a system must define the optimum equilibrium between these two components. Obviously, the choice of hard or soft measures to reduce climate change vulnerability and risk depends on economic, cultural and strategic choices. A major hurdle in applying the concept of resilience to DRR and CCA is the effective assessment of a system’s resilience, namely the capacity of the community as a whole to prepare for, respond to, and recover from adverse events. Decisive in this computation is the definition of which parameters and factors influence the emergency threshold of a system. Such threshold, dependent on intrinsic characteristics of the system and its surrounding environment, establishes the limit beyond which the system will lose stability. From a qualitative standpoint, it exemplifies the ratio between the magnitude of impact (e.g. tropical cyclones or drought) and the resources available to the socialecological system. Quantifying this threshold into an index will help choosing the most appropriate CCA actions. Moreover, an Emergency Thresholds Index will help move from the classic view of a map of risk to a map of territorial resilience\n\nThe ESPONontheRoad project was a Transnational Networking Activity (TNA) of nineteen ESPON Contact Points with the aim to bring ESPON results closer for decision-making and thus increase the capitalisation of the ESPON Programme. During the relatively short project lifetime of one year, participating ECPs brought ESPON closer to the local and regional level, and to citizens in physical and virtual forms as well. The project built a bridge between the issues on a local level and scientific evidence on EU territorial development policy themes. After taking stock of the most recent policy issues in each national context, ECPs formed transnational working groups to have a common understanding of the messages coming from ESPON results. These working groups elaborated their issues for their target groups more in details and designed the most appropriate and efficient form of communication with target groups. In this way ESPON results were put into the macroregional context of West, South,...\n\nIn many regions, an unbalanced dichotomic development based on core and peripheral areas has increased territorial inequalities affecting places, communities and economies. The peripheralisation processes are causing several disadvantages, in terms of socio-economic negative trends, abandonment of cultural heritage and increasing of environmental risks. The CNR IRISS research aims at investigating approaches to contrast marginalisation trends and support balanced development processes. Starting from a first screening of scientific literature, different fields of study have emerged, ranging from regional sciences to geography and urban studies, from economics to social studies, and different terms have come out such as internal areas, inland areas, and inner peripheries. The aim of this research phase is to implement a systematic literature review to explore the multiplicity of terms related to unbalanced development and peripheralisation processes, to investigate possible connections with different scientific disciplines and/or geo-political contexts also by analysing the evolution of the debate over time. This work presents a testing phase aimed at verifying the adequacy of the selected methodology and selected items and at sharing them with the scientific community in order to consolidate and enrich the methodological framework, and to organise the follow-up activities."
