The Stânca-Costeşti Dam is a dam on the Prut and a checkpoint between Moldova and Romania. The dam is located between Costeşti and Stânca .

The basic Romanian-Soviet agreement on its construction was ratified in 1972. Built between 1974–1978, the Stânca Costeşti Lake is a USSR-Romanian project. The lake is the reservoir for a hydro power station. The main goal of building this power station was to protect villages down the Prut river from annual floods. The 1970 floods in Romania were the worst in modern Romanian history in loss of life.
