Chisinau, 8 May /MOLDPRES/ - The movement through the Costesti border crossing point is redirected, as the access to the Stanca border checkpoint from Romania is limited. The restrictions are imposed because of the maintenance works carried out on the crowning of the Costesti-Stanca dam. The Customs Service made an announcement to this effect today.

According to the quoted source, the works are planned for a six-hour time interval.

In these circumstances, the Border Police recommend that passengers who planned to cross the border through the Costesti checkpoint choose the nearby border crossing point: Lipcani-Radauti Prut.

At the same time, the Border Police noted that, at present, a large number of transport means were recorded at the Sculeni border checkpoint in the direction of exit from Moldova. Thus, border policemen, jointly with customs employees undertake a string of measures to ease the traffic.
