At the Costesti border crossing point, there is the possibility of registering increased waiting times today, June 18, until 13:00.

This is because, according to the Border Police of the Republic of Moldova, technical works are being carried out on the Stânca-Costești dam.

In this context, all travelers who planned to cross the border through the Costești crossing point are encouraged to choose the nearby crossing points: Lipcani, Sculeni or Leușeni.
