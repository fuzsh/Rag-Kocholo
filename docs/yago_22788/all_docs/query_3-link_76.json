        "text": "Prior to his passing in 2004, Rodney Dangerfield was a regular guest on “The Tonight Show,” appearing alongside either Johnny Carson or Jay Leno on almost 100 occasions. Born in New York’s Suffolk County and raised in Queens, the bug-eyed, tie-fidgeting, comedian cracked up audiences for decades with his often self-deprecating \"no respect\"-style of rapid-fire one-liners.\n\nJoan Dangerfield — formerly Utah native Joan Child — married the comedian 25 years ago this year, the pair having dated for 10 years after meeting by chance in 1983 as Rodney strolled passed Joan’s Santa Monica flower shop.\n\n“He lived in New York but was in town staying at the nearby Pritikin Longevity Center trying to lose weight and get healthier,” Joan recalled from her West Hollywood home. “Part of their program included taking morning walks. Being a die-hard fan, I recognized Rodney immediately. I was 16 when I first saw him on ‘The Tonight Show’ and suddenly there he was, 14 years later, walking towards me, the funniest man in the world.”\n\nDangerfield began dropping by each morning to watch Joan arrange flowers, often peppering her with questions including some unexpected ones such as, “What kind of drugs do you like?”\n\nRaised in a Mormon family in North Ogden, she offered a rather innocent reply.\n\n“I told him, ‘Antibiotics, I guess, they revolutionized medicine.’ He thought I was the squarest person and replied, ‘What planet are you from?’ ”\n\n'The Holy Grail of encounters'\n\nDespite their clearly different backgrounds, the two hit it off immediately.\n\n“For me, it was love at first sight, the Holy Grail of encounters. He was fascinating and had those soulful azure-blue eyes, the color of the sky on a clear day. I couldn’t look at him without smiling.”\n\nAfter a decade of dating, Joan says the love was finally mutual and the couple tied the knot.\n\n“I was spending Christmas with my family in Utah when Rodney called asking me to return because he missed me too much,” she recalled. “We were married the following day at the Silver Bells wedding chapel in Las Vegas. When I called my parents from the car and told them I’d just gotten married, my mother asked, ‘To whom?’ ”\n\nHer parents had imagined the newlyweds were just good friends and had pretty much written off their 41-year-old daughter “as an old maid,” according to Joan. “So they were relieved.”\n\nDangerfield flew to Utah to meet Joan’s family for the first time a few weeks after the marriage.\n\nHer conservative parents enjoyed a simple, easygoing life: Her mother was a housewife who never learned to drive, and her father was a carpenter. Joan says she never heard her parents swear, argue, or complain about anything. But they welcomed the outrageous comedian with open arms (“Once they recovered from the surprise,” she says) with her father and Rodney soon becoming buddies.\n\n“My dad visited us regularly and marveled at how hard Rodney worked, telling him, ‘I thought I worked hard, but you work harder.’ ”\n\nAnd Dangerfield did labor at his craft. In addition to co-writing hit movies of the '80s such as “Easy Money” and “Back to School,” he wrote his own stand-up material often taking months to perfect a joke. He kept folded sheets of paper and a pen in his pocket to jot down ideas.\n\nIn the evenings, he would dash off to comedy clubs, sometimes dropping by two or three a night, to try out a new joke and experiment with its delivery and placement within a routine. If a joke got laughter, he knew he was on the right track, and if also got applause he knew it was a winner.\n\nWhen Viagra jokes were new\n\nJoan especially remembers how excited he became one morning in the late '90s after reading about Viagra for the first time in the L.A. Times. “He couldn’t believe an impotence drug was created during his lifetime so he could write jokes about it. He had me track Viagra’s popularity online to make sure enough people were familiar with it. They were.”\n\nShe recalls him sitting at the dining room table, shuffling his slippered feet, mouthing words to himself, and staring up at the ceiling. Absorbed in the joke writing zone, Joan gave him some space.\n\n“A few minutes later, he buzzed me on the intercom and said, ‘I started a new diet. Viagra and prune juice. Only trouble is, I don’t know if I’m coming or going.’ That night he tried out the joke at the Laugh Factory and it killed. The next day, he booked himself on ‘The Tonight Show’ because he was afraid someone might steal the joke before he got a chance to tell it. It may have been the first Viagra joke told on television.”\n\nMarriage moods\n\nDespite their different backgrounds, Joan says the marriage was remarkably stable. Dangerfield wrote the 2000 movie “My 5 Wives” based on stories she told him about Utah polygamists living near where she grew up. But lines like “One of the advantages of having five wives is they can’t all have a headache at the same time” didn’t offend her.\n\n“I felt like the luckiest person in the world,” she said. “To have your own personal comedian constantly surprising you, I couldn’t wait to wake up each day.”\n\nDangerfield wasn’t as lucky. He suffered from depression throughout much of his life.\n\n“Rodney was born into a very cold household,” explained Joan. “His father abandoned the family when he was young and there were no kisses or hugs from his mother. He would be left out in the yard with half a sandwich on the stoop, his grandmother keeping an occasional eye on him through the window, spending his day playing with a hammer. His humor, I think, was a coping mechanism to battle his anxiety. If you can lift everyone’s spirits around you, you can feel a bit better, too. And when he was out on stage, that’s when he felt his best — the laughter was validating and fulfilling and made him feel loved.”\n\nDangerfield sought therapy for his depression on a regular basis both before and after his marriage and believed that talking through his troubles could at least partially alleviate the anxiety.\n\n“He tried various antidepressants, eventually finding a combination of medicine and therapy that was effective on a consistent basis,” said Joan. “Plus, he was a Romeo. He loved being in love, which I think helped. He would sing to me and write adorable notes. One of them read, ‘How wonderful you are. I’ll never let you down ... unless you’re on a ladder.’ ”\n\nMarijuana also helped. “If he was in a particularly tense situation, his blood pressure would escalate and marijuana would instantly bring it down. We started documenting the results to show his doctor and he later obtained compassionate use approval.”\n\nShe says Dangerfield never used a teleprompter, nor did her ever use marijuana before a show.\n\n“He needed to be sharp to remember his jokes and give his best performance. It isn’t easy standing on stage for an hour telling jokes in rapid succession with perfect timing.”\n\nDangerfield's failing health\n\nDangerfield’s physical health also declined in later years requiring multiple aneurysm surgeries, brain and heart surgeries, and long periods of recovery with Joan by his side throughout.\n\n“He joked that, at his age, all the phone numbers in his little black book were doctors,” she said. “It was certainly true and brought out my nurturing side. The role of a caregiver is a wife’s most precious duty and I did everything I could to comfort him.”\n\nBut Dangerfield also lamented that the timing of his illnesses wasn’t fair.\n\n“He had finally found emotional stability and happiness when his physical health put it all in jeopardy,” noted Joan. “But he approached such situations with bravado and usually with humor, too. When his heart surgeon told him he needed his aortic valve replaced with a biological porcine valve, Rodney asked, ‘Shouldn’t I at least meet the pig first, to see if we get along?’ He didn’t care what he had to endure in the recovery process, he just wanted to wake up from the surgery and get on with his life. His goal was to be a supercentenarian and live to 120.”\n\nBut it was not to be and Dangerfield died on Oct. 5, 2004, aged 82. Joan planned an elaborate funeral and took the unusual step of holding the services at the cemetery.\n\n“That may sound strange, but there was a charming chapel on the grounds a short distance from Rodney’s gravesite,” she explained. “And there was an undeveloped area of the park perfect for a reception.”\n\nAttendees arrived at dusk through iron gates adorned with floral monograms of Rodney’s initials. Garlands of garden roses clung to the trunks of surrounding trees, sparkling chandeliers cascaded from their branches, and white cashmere carpet blanketed the candle-lit pathways that led to the chapel.\n\n“This is what happens when your widow is a florist!” Joan said.\n\nThe services were officiated by Bob Saget, while strolling violins led the pallbearers to the gravesite. Many of the guests, including Tim Allen, Jay Leno, Jim Carrey, Larry David, and Chris Rock, paid their respects in moving eulogies. Louie Anderson said the final prayer.\n\nAfter the services, guests gathered under softly lit sky-high chiffon canopies for a celebration of Dangerfield’s life, eating his favorite foods. “There’s a scene in ‘Back to School’ where he guts out a loaf of bread and builds a sandwich. That’s the sort of comfort food Rodney actually liked, he was not a sushi guy!”\n\nJoan recalls that upon learning of his death, both Carson and Leno referred to Dangerfield as the best stand-up comedian who ever lived.\n\n“That would have meant the world to Rodney, coming from them,” she said. “He loved and admired them both.”\n\nHolding on to the laughter\n\nSince his passing, Joan has been working to keep her husband’s memory alive. The rodney.com website has been revamped and the Rodney Dangerfield Institute for the Study of Comedy is now housed at Los Angeles City College and offers classes including stand-up, improvisational comedy, and joke writing.\n\n“Rodney’s social media presence is building, and it’s fun to see the reaction from his loyal fans as well as new ones,” she says. “I am also very excited that Paradigm Talent Agency is currently fielding offers for a biopic or documentary film about Rodney’s remarkable life. I am sure that will deepen his impression on the world.”\n\nNick Thomas teaches at Auburn University at Montgomery and has written features, columns, and interviews for over 700 newspapers and magazines.
