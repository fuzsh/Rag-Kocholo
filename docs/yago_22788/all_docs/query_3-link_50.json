Offering four classes including a stand-up workshop, improvisational comedy, joke writing, and an American film comedy genre class, the RDI is the only comedy institute in the country housed within a community college.\n\nThe RDI was established in cooperation with Joan Dangerfield, Rodney Dangerfieldâ€™s widow, who will serve as the honorary chair of the RDI Advisory Board."
