        "text": "In his 20-4 autobiography \"It Ain't Easy Bein' Me\", he revealed that he was paid $35,000 to star in Caddyshack - Wahnsinn ohne Handicap (1980), but in doing so he had to give up more than $100,000 in bookings in Las Vegas in order to make the movie.\n\nAccording to director Oliver Stone, Dangerfield didn't understand Natural Born Killers (1994) during shooting and didn't understand what Stone was trying to do by shooting such a dark subject as a father molesting his daughter in the style of a 1950s sitcom. As such, he found it very difficult to perform his part. However, Stone was delighted that when the film came out, Dangerfield's performance was hailed as one of the movie's strongest points.\n\nBased his famous \"I get no respect\" on Der Pate (1972), since he figured that \"Vito Corleone\" had respect. He also based it on an experience he had at a nightclub. One night, he saw an older, low-level gangster complaining about how young people gave him \"no respect, no respect at all\" and he never forgot it.\n\nAfter he quit show business in 1949 he became an aluminum-siding salesman on Long Island (NY). He was actually quite successful at it, and eventually owned his own home improvement business, which he abandoned when he relaunched his career in the early 1960s.\n\nRodney was appearing on the Tonight Show Starring Jay Leno on November 21, 2001. While Rodney was doing his stand-up act Jay Leno later said that he thought \"Rodney seemed a little off, he sweating profusely.\" He asked the director to call the paramedics. Rodney came over and sat down and finished his appearance, but was greeted back stage by the paramedics. Based on what they saw back stage, the paramedics transported him to the hospital where the next day it was revealed that Rodney had had a mild heart attack.\n\nDied at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles of complications following heart valve replacement surgery he had undergone on August 25, 2004. After the surgery he slipped into a \"light coma,\" from which he emerged briefly before his death. He is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park in Los Angeles."
