        "text": "Actors\n\nJack Roy (Born Jacob Rodney Cohen; November 22, 1921-October 5, 2004), popularly known by the stage name Rodney Dangerfield, was an American stand-up comedian, actor, producer, screenwriter, musician and author. He was known for his self-deprecating one-liner humor, his catchphrase “I don’t get no respect!” and his monologues on that theme.He began his career working as a stand-up comic in the Borscht Belt resorts of the Catskill Mountains northwest of New York City. His act grew in popularity as he became a mainstay on late-night talk shows throughout the 1960s and 1970s, eventually developing into a headlining act on the Las Vegas casino circuit.\n\nHis catch-phrase “I get no respect!” came from an attempt to improve one of his stand-up jokes. “I played hide and seek; they wouldn’t even look for me.” He thought the joke would be stronger if it used the formulaic “I was so …” beginning (“I was so poor,” “He was so ugly,” “She was so stupid,” etc.). He tried “I get no respect,” and got a much better response with the audience; it became a permanent feature of his act and comedic persona.\n\nHe appeared in a few bit parts in films such as an uncredited part in Stanley Kubrick‘s The Killing (1955) with Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray, and Vince Edwards; and The Projectionist (1970), but his breakout film role came as a boorish nouveau riche golfer in Harold Ramis‘s ensemble sports comedy Caddyshack (1980), with Chevy Chase, Ted Knight and Bill Murray). This was followed by two more successful films in which he starred: 1983’s Easy Money, with Joe Pesci, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Candice Azzara, and Jennifer Jason Leigh; and Back to School (1986), with Keith Gordon, Sally Kellerman, Burt Young, Terry Farrell, William Zabka, Ned Beatty, Sam Kinison, Paxton Whitehead and Robert Downey Jr.\n\nAdditional film work kept him busy through the rest of his life, mostly in comedies, but with a rare dramatic role in Oliver Stone‘s Natural Born Killers (1994), as an abusive father; the film starred Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Downey Jr., Tom Sizemore, and Tommy Lee Jones. Other notable film roles include a starring role in Meet Wally Sparks (1997), with Debi Mazar, Michael Weatherly, Cindy Williams, Alan Rachins, Burt Reynolds, and David Ogden Stiers; and a supporting role in Little Nicky (2000, with Adam Sandler, Patricia Arquette, Rhys Ifans, Tom “Tiny” Lister Jr., and Harvey Keitel. Health troubles curtailed his output through the early 2000s before his death in 2004, following a month in a coma due to complications from heart valve surgery.\n\nEach review will be linked to the title below.\n\n(*seen originally in theaters)\n\n(**seen rereleased in theaters)"
