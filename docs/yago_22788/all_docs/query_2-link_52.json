        "text": "Rodney Dangerfield (November 22, 1921 – October 5, 2004), born Jacob Cohen, was an American comedian, and actor, known for the catchphrases \"I don't get no respect\" or \"I get no respect, I tell ya\" and his monologues on that theme. He is also famous for his 1980s film roles, notably in Easy Money, Caddyshack and Back To School.\n\nIn \"Fore Father\", Stewie tells himself “do not go gentle into that good night.” which played a prominent role in Back To School.\n\nDangerfield makes a cameo appearance on Hoth in Something, Something, Something, Dark Side.\n\nIn \"Extra Large Medium\", Stewie breaks the Fourth wall in discussing a poem by Henry David Thoreau pointing out the audience's perceived lack of knowledge when they believe most would attribute it to Thorton Mellon, Rodney's character in the film Back to School.\n\nWhen Lois gets Scotty's parents to treat their son's cancer, Peter says Rodney Dangerfield's quote from Caddyshack, \"Hey everybody! We're all gonna get laid!.\"\n\nPeter distracting the shipyard workers by holding a sign referring to Tony Danza in \"Boopa-Dee Bappa-Dee\" is a reference to a similar scene in Back to School.[1]\n\nRover Dangerfield, originally voiced by Rodney, appears in \"The Woof of Wall Street\".\n\nAs Peter is dying in the future of \"Rich Old Stewie\", he sees others who have already passed on from the show, including Rodney Dangerfield."
