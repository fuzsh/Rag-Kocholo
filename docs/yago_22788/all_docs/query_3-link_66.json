        "text": "That’s the work of one Stafford Borg, Rodney’s cook, house manager and road crew. A baby-faced, heavyset thirty-three-year old, Staff, as he’s called, has worked for Rodney for four years. On the road, he packs along a microwave to keep the Pritikin flowing.\n\nRodney ducks off for a quick steam while I, declining to join him due to a morbid fear of health, reflect on how things have changed since I saw him five years ago. The Dangerfield household then was in Manhattan and consisted of five people and a dog. In Rodney’s Upper East Side apartment lived his daughter, Melanie, his son, Brian, his Jamaican maid, cook, child raiser and game-show addict, Thelma, and his old pal Joe Ancis. The kids were in school then. Now Melanie, 22, is trying to break into the movies in California, and Brian, 25, is working in a children’s camp in Hartford, Connecticut Thelma is still in the apartment, as is Joe, a story in himself. He’s a legend among New York comedians, a comic’s comic whose stream-of-consciousness shpritzing influenced Lenny Bruce but who never worked in front of a crowd, only convulsed his friends. “Funniest fellow ever, ever, ever,” says Rodney. “But Joe’s stuff can never be repeated. You gotta be there, that’s all.” One time Joe had a fight with his wife, walked out and went across the street to Rodney’s. Rodney commiserated. He knew how tough marriage can be. Oh, did he ever know that one! He said, Why not stay here tonight? This was ten years ago. Joe is still in the spare room."
