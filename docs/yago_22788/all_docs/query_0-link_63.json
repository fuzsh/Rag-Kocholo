        "text": "Inspired by the success of movies like \"The Little Mermaid\" and by a continuing baby boomlet, Hollywood studios are energetically plunging into the production of feature-length animated films, a realm both they and movie audiences have long regarded as a monopoly of the Walt Disney Company .\n\nWarner Brothers' \"Rover Dangerfield,\" starring a canine cartoon version of the comedian Rodney Dangerfield, is scheduled to arrive in theaters this summer. And later this year, in what studio executives say is a sign of things to come, Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Universal's \"An American Tail: Fievel Goes West\" and 20th Century Fox's environmentalist fantasy \"Ferngully: The Last Rain Forest\" will all be competing for the approval of family audiences.\n\nAt the moment, in fact, all seven of Hollywood's major studios have at least one animated film scheduled for release this year or production next year, leading to intense competition for the services of top animators. \"It's a very exciting time,\" said Charles Solomon, the author of \"Enchanted Drawings: The History of Animation.\" \"There are probably more features in production right now than there ever have been.\" Money: Root of All Imitation\n\nLike so much else in Hollywood, the renewed interest in animated films after decades of general neglect stems largely from a hunger to duplicate some very impressive box-office numbers. The $154 million made by \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" the $84 million that \"The Little Mermaid\" earned, the $53 million taken in by \"Oliver and Company\" and the $47 million performance of \"An American Tail\" have awakened in movie makers a desire for a foothold in what is seen as an increasingly lucrative specialized market."
