        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. – For six weeks in the fall of 1982, Staten Island got no respect.\n\nThat’s because bug-eyed, necktie-tugging stand-up comic Rodney Dangerfield was filming scenes from his new movie, “Easy Money” here.\n\nAnd some iconic borough locations have passed into film lore because they were part of the filming.\n\nDangerfield, whose self-deprecating catchphrase was that he “got no respect,” was at the peak of his comedy career having starred in the wildly popular “Caddyshack” movie in 1980.\n\nIn “Easy Money,” Dangerfield plays Monty Capuletti, a New Dorp baby photographer who schemes to get his hands on his late mother-in-law’s fortune.\n\nProbably the most famous Island scene from the movie, shot on Oct. 13, 1982, shows Dangerfield and co-star Joe Pesci struggling to carry an enormous cake out of Alfonso’s.\n\nThe famed pastry shop had been renamed “Alfonso’s Bakery and Scungilli” for the film.\n\nThe Campitiello family – Alfonso; his wife, Diane, and sons Vincent, Anthony and Peter – worked on a trio of movie cakes for the film shoot. They included, among other ingredients, Styrofoam.\n\n“I’ll be making two more real ones when they have the wedding,” Campiteillo said of another “Easy Money” scene that was shot on Staten Island. “Right now, we’re selling scungilli.”\n\nHe added, “They will change the sign back.”\n\nThe Advance has reported that the iconic Alfonso’s is now for sale after 45 years at it’s well known location at 1899 Victory Blvd.\n\nOwner Anthony Campitiello told the Advance that health concerns had led him to the decision to sell.\n\nFILMING, DRINKING AND FLIRTING\n\nFilming for “Easy Money” was also done on the warm and foggy night of Nov. 3, 1982 at the old L&M Tavern, at the corner of Richmond Road and DeKalb Street in Concord.\n\nThe nighttime scene involved Dangerfield stumbling out of the bar and staggering up the street. He turns and curses the bar’s lighted sign, then makes his way into a waiting car that then pulls away from the curb. It took Dangerfield at least eight takes to nail the scene.\n\nThe shoot was a draw for L&M regulars and neighborhood types who hung around the film set, including one who was smoking a joint, the Advance reported.\n\nA few Budweiser-drinking girls flirted with members of the film crew, while another woman leaned out of a second-story window on the block to take in the scene.\n\n“My family’s been running this bar for years and years and nothing like this has ever happened before,” Maryalice Sjolander, who owned the tavern along with her husband, Gunnar, told the Advance at the time.\n\nPrior to shooting, Dangerfield stood between film trucks away from onlookers, drinking coffee and going over the scene with production staffers. Some local kids approached him for autographs. Some got them, others didn’t, according to the Advance.\n\nThe crew had set up outside the bar as the sky turned dark, with two enormous flood lights perched in a cherrypicker above Richmond Road. A movable camera track was installed so the camera could follow Dangerfield stumbling down the street.\n\nNot everybody in the neighborhood was happy about the shoot.\n\n“Yesterday, people asked Rodney to pose for some pictures in front of the bar,” griped Louie, who was wearing a silver L&M football team jacket. “But he wouldn’t do it. If he can’t take a couple of minutes just to pose for some pictures, to hell with him.”\n\nAnd some L&M regulars were put out that they couldn’t enjoy a nightcap in the bar that night. Production staffers blocked the door.\n\n“Yeah, that’s OK,” one grumbled. “We only own the place. I’ll tell you, it’s a good thing there’s no hockey game on tonight or there’d be real trouble.”\n\nA home at 57 McVeigh Ave. in New Springville served as Dangerfield’s character’s home, the Advance said. One scene filmed there showed garbage being collected by an old-model city Sanitation truck.\n\nAlso used in the filming were Our Lady Queen of Peace R.C. Church in New Dorp as well as Sea View Hospital and Home.\n\nPieces of the set used to film a hospital scene in “Easy Money” were later incorporated into a health care museum on the grounds of Sea View.\n\nAnd news photographer extraordinaire Jim Romano got to pose with Dangerfield during the filming of “Easy Money” here.\n\nMORE STATEN ISLAND MOVIE STORIES FROM TOM WROBLESKI\n\nRare, exclusive photos as “Godfather” actor Al Pacino celebrates birthday while filming “Donnie Brasco” on Staten Island with Johnny Depp in 1996\n\nThis little-known other “Godfather” house on Staten Island was the setting for three key scenes from iconic gangster flick"
