The Arizona Coyotes have extended their broadcast partnership with Bonneville Phoenix Media and Marketing for another year. All Coyotes regular season and playoff games for the 2023-24 NHL season will be aired on Arizona Sports 98.7 (KMVP) or ESPN 620 (KTAR-AM).

Fans can also live stream the games through both the team and Arizona Sports 98.7 apps. Additionally, games broadcast on KTAR will be simulcast on KVMP-HD2.

Bob Heethuis will return as the Coyotes Radio Play-by-Play Announcer for his 19th season, while Olympic Silver Medalist Lyndsey Fry will serve as the radio color analyst. Each game broadcast will include 30 minutes of pre-game and post-game coverage, hosted by Luke Lapinski. The post-game show will feature player interviews and a live broadcast of Coyotes Head Coach André Tourigny’s post-game press conference.

Additionally, Arizona Sports 98.7 plans to air two weekly Coyotes shows throughout the season. The station will also broadcast the Coyotes home preseason games, beginning on October 7 against Anaheim.

Arizona Coyotes President & CEO Xavier A. Gutierrez said, “We are very pleased to extend our partnership with Bonneville Phoenix and are thrilled to have Arizona Sports 98.7 and ESPN 620 broadcast all Coyotes games this season.”

Bonneville Phoenix Senior Vice President and Market Manager Ryan Hatch commented, “We are excited to continue our partnership with the Arizona Coyotes and the Meruelo Group.”
