        "text": "KCPW radio has a much wider reach now that it is simulcasting on AM-1010.\n\nAccording to station manager Vicki Mann, KCPW is still fine-tuning its AM-1010 signal, but she's pleased to report that listeners as far south as Cedar City and as far north as Lava Hot Springs, Idaho, are getting the signal. (Previously, the station was only heard in the Salt Lake area on FM-88.3 and FM-105.3.)\n\n\"People are happy that they can take KCPW with them on the road,\" Mann said.\n\nKCPW, a National Public Radio affiliate, is owned by Community Wireless of Park City, which also owns sister station KPCW. Community Wireless purchased the AM-1010 station after the former KIQN went bankrupt last year.\n\nMann said there's no decision yet as to whether AM-1010 will offer separate programming.\n\nWhile KUER (FM-90.1) has a fleet of translator stations that carry NPR and local programming throughout much of Utah, KCPW does not. But the AM-1010 signal is the next best thing.\n\n\"It's a work in progress,\" Mann said. \"The feedback on the signal has been very positive.\"\n\nShe also said FM-105.3 was designed to move the KCPW signal north into Davis County. That hasn't worked as well as was hoped, so KCPW will also fine-tune that signal in the near future.\n\nMann also said KCPW's new office and studios in Library Square, 210 E. 400 South, are also working out well. \"It's a fabulous location. It gives us a lot more flexibility.\"\n\nKCPW begins each day with NPR's \"Morning Edition\" from 5-9 a.m. Jennifer Napier-Pearce provides a local slant during those hours. From 3-5:30 p.m. and 6-7 p.m. the station airs NPR's \"All Things Considered,\" with Bryan Schott as the local host. KCPW, which is also affiliated with the BBC network, airs \"World Service\" Saturdays and Sundays from 5-6 a.m. The station also carries local debates and programs that other local stations don't.\n\nA complete programming schedule is online at www.kcpw.org..\n\nBONNEVILLE EXTENDS REGIONAL PRESENCE â€” Bonneville International Corp. announced this week a deal to acquire three stations in Phoenix.\n\nIn an agreement completed with Emmis Communications, Bonneville will acquire KTAR (AM), Phoenix's news/talk leader; KKLT (FM), a leading adult contemporary station; and KMVP (AM), an ESPN affiliate.\n\nIn exchange, Bonneville will trade WLUP-FM (The Loop), Chicago's heritage rock station, and cash. The transaction requires FCC approval; both Bonneville and Emmis officials expect the deal will be completed by early 2005. Bonneville will retain a broadcast position in Chicago radio by continuing to operate WTMX, WDRV and WNND.\n\nBonneville, which owned some Arizona stations in the 1980s, is owned by Deseret Management Corp., a holding company for businesses affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which includes the Deseret Morning News.\n\nKBYU (FM-89.1/89.5) will air selected classes from Brigham Young University's Education Week, which was held in August. You can hear the broadcasts Tuesdays at 9 p.m. through Dec. 21. First up is Brian Hill on \"Strengthening Families Through Wholesome Recreation.\" A complete schedule is online at www.kbyufm.org."
