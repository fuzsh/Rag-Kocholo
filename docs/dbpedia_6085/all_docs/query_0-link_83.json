        "text": "While sports radio talk show hosts make a living on rush hour hot takes that are often easily proved wrong by the end of the day — sometimes by the end of the drive — they serve their purpose and provoke discussion. But sometimes, they're just so bad they deserve to be called out.\n\nEnter Jody Oehler of Fox Sports 910 AM. His target: John Gambadoro of KMVP-FM 98.7 FM, who happens to be on the \"Burns and Gambo Show\" which airs from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. against Oehler's show \"The Drive,\" on from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.\n\n\"Reminder that there are Phoenix sports media members that publicly questioned whether Goldy was done in May and whether Gabbert was the future at QB within a 6 month span,\" he tweeted. \"And that sports media member was Gambo. #accountabilityboard\"\n\nGoldy of course is Arizona Diamondbacks first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, who struggled mightily in to begin the season and hit .144 with three home runs in May.\n\nGoldschmidt righted himself in June as he hit .364 with 10 home runs and was ultimately named to the National League All-Star team and started as the team's designated hitter.\n\nNFL journeyman quarterback Blaine Gabbert started five games for the Arizona Cardinals last season. The Cardinals went 2-3 in his starts while Gabbert had a touchdown to interception ratio of six to six.\n\nFollowing the season, the Cardinals let Gabbert walk in free agency, signed Sam Bradford and traded up in the draft to select Josh Rosen out of UCLA with the 10th overall pick. Gabbert is set to backup Marcus Mariota with the Tennessee Titans this season.\n\nGambadoro's show holds the broadcast rights to the Diamondbacks and Cardinals, among others. To that point, it’s logical to wonder whether negative comments about those teams is ever encouraged.\n\n“I think Phoenix sports radio in general has a real problem with objectivity and accountability,” Oehler wrote in a text message to azcentral sports on Thursday. “I’m trying to change that. You can be honest, entertaining, objective and still fair to the home teams. I’m not perfect on accountability. I have my fair share of &mldr; whiffs on takes but we try to be better about it than others.\n\n“On ‘The Drive’ we Pipe it Up!”\n\nJohn Gambadoro's response:\n\nGambadoro replied on Twitter Thursday morning.\n\n\"Anyone who said I said Goldy's career was over is just plain lying,\" he tweeted. \"What I said was that he gave away 150 at bats and won't put up typical Goldy numbers - I did say I don't believe he will get to 90 RBI but I did say I think his home run numbers will be fine.\"\n\nArizona Sports 98.7 FM said it had no comment.\n\nMore Oehler tweets involving Gambadoro:\n\nOehler continued his criticism of Gambadoro on Twitter.\n\nMORE SPORTS"
