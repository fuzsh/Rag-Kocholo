In the AM studio on the other side of the building was K-Life with market vets Jim Spero and Jack Dey.\n\nKQXE 1310 had an A/C format with Crazy Dave Otto, Phil Baykion, Mark James, Phil Gardner (one of the funniest personality jocks ever!) John McRae and Bob Bailey.

I eventually made it to 6p-12m under Eric Foxx. I remember being in the studio (upstairs NW corner of the building) in the control room, when Martinez was on air, during the FIRST simulcast at 12 Midnight of the new KC-92! Within the first couple of live breaks, we heard “gunfire” outside in the neighborhood, right after Martinez opened the Mic! It actually went over the air! Anyway, your site had me flipping through the old index “card file” system to find the next Ronnie Milsap song to pull up and put on the air. Those were the days.\n\nCarey Edwards\n\nVP Programming\n\nKAJM/KAZL\n\nAh, 940 AM. Memories…\n\n(postings from Valley of the Sun Media MessageBoard, January 2001 – as several old farts recall the Golden Days of Tucson radio. Credit: “oldiesfan” and “fusejockey”)\n\n“It went on the air when its owner moved down the dial from the daylight only 1550 position, and donated that to the Ewe Ovay. The first call letters were KHOS, which got its ass kicked by KCUB for two decades. The Phelan brothers AKA Western Cities Broadcasting flipped it to AC KMGX “Magic 94” in about 1976. Then it flipped to news-talk in ’82 as the original home of “Newsplus” KNST. They played 10-year-old Merv Griffin TV show audio off of 33-1/3 RPMs for some misguided reason at 9am that first year…\n\nKNST and KCEE swapped formats/calls sometime in the early 90s, no? Original call letters for KLPX was KCEE-FM in 1978, before the Beasleys sold itto Lotus)…\n\nA few corrections re KHOS and the above… The original airdate for the 940 freq. was 08/10/63, with KHOS as the calls. I believe it was originally 250w day and night; by 1973 it was 1kw-D/250w-N, DA-2 (per the 1973 Broadcasting Yearbook). The 1550 deal was another scenario: group owner John B. Walton had KFIF on 1550, a daytimer with 50kw. By 1967 he wanted a full-time freq. to better compete in Top 40-land with KTKT on 990 kHz (10kw-D/1kw-N, DA-2). Walton bought the 580 freq. (5kw-D/500w-N, DA-N) from a local company and moved the KFIF format to 580 as KIKX. (Remember Jefferson K–now Shadoe Stevens?) He donated the 1550 freq. to the U of A where it still exists today as KUAT(AM). 580 (was KTAN) went dark briefly in the spring of 67; 1550/KFIF went dark and KIKX/58 premiered at 3:00pm MDT on Saturday June 10, 1967 (yes, AZ was on daylight time that one year). I guess they didn’t know way back then that format changes are supposed to kick off on Thursday afternoons at three! KIKX segued music–jockless–the first afternoon/evening (the first song was “Up, Up And Away” followed by “Groovin'”), then on Sunday did the now-typical stunting by playing the same (horrible) song continuously while promoting Monday morning. Regular programming with jocks started at 6:00am Monday June 12–Jack Mitchell kicked off with “Six O’Clock” by the Spoonful. And unfortunately I have no airchecks of it. It’s all just in the vault–and I don’t mean Audio Vault. (At least the first day they pretty-much used new copies of 45s so there wasn’t too much cue burn on the air.) Evenings, 1550/KFIF used a great signoff song, Van Morrison’s (Them) “Here Comes The Night.” They were a good alternative to KRUX & KRIZ at the time. When commercials started, it was time to hit the button. KTKT also had a good enough 10kw signal to get into the Phoenix area. I had the extra push buttons on the radio set to 1550 and 990 for that reason. << << 580 (was KTAN) went dark briefly in the spring of 67; 155/KFIF went dark and KIKX/58 premiered at 3:00pm MDT on Saturday June 10, 1967 (yes, AZ was on daylight time that one year). >>> >>> My best recollection of sign-off time in the latter days of KFIF (say, May 1967) was PM drive jock Russ O’Hara (4:00pm-8:15pm) reading the sign off blurb over an instrumental: “…KFIF offices and studios are at 257 North Stone Avenue in downtown Tucson…with studio and transmitter twelve miles north of Tucson on the Casa Grande Highway…” –the production studio was at the downtown office, on-air studio was at the XMTR site. >> Since you have a good recollection of Tucson Radio, do you have any further insight or details concerning KIKX losing their license doing a news spoof? << Mid-70s (1974?), two DJs (one was Gary Craig, the other name escapes me) staged a fake kidnapping on-air. Uncle Charlie attempted to yank the station's ticket but it took a number of years and appeals before 580 went dark for a while. It was reborn briefly as KJMM (year?) then dark again, prior to the current occupant KSAZ, with the COL--and sticks--moved to Marana. KSAZ first surfaced as a daytimer before they could get their three-tower DA-N up and running. It has been 5kw-D/320w-N, DA-N...three Qs: 1) wonder why the previous 500w-N had to be reduced to 320 when they're only about 30 miles closer to Fresno, 2) has their CP for 550w-N come about yet, and 3) what's the deal with the weird guy (local show, not Stardust) they have on Saturday mornings at 11...?\"\n\n960 KKNT\n\nSalem [Common Ground Broadcasting]\n\nConservative “The Patriot”\n\nPhoenix\n\nOld call letters: KOOL; KARZ late ’70s; KOOL Oldies; KPXQ; KPXQ began simulcasting on 1360 July 23, 1999, pending move to 1360. KCTK 1360 would move to 960 effective September 7, 1999. Call letters changed to KKNT 2003.\n\n990 KTKT TUCSON–\n\nRAY LINDSTROM REMEMBERS: from raylindstrom.com\n\nIn my sophomore year in high school, the end of 1956, the family moved to Tucson, Arizona. The number one radio station in town was KTKT and it was great. It was a top forty format and had great disc jockeys like Chris Borden, Buck Herring, Bob Sinclair, and Frank Kalil. My best friend Burt Schneider and I would spend hours practicing our “disc jockeying” technique with his home tape recorder. At the new Catalina High School we would do announcements on the PA system and played records for the kids in the lunch room.\n\nFM RADIO? WHAT’S THAT?\n\nThere were two types of radio. AM and FM. In the 50’s AM was the biggie. Hardly anyone had an FM radio. Oh, maybe a few intellectuals who liked to listen to classical music, but that was it. In Tucson there was one FM station, KTKT-FM at 99.5 on the FM dial. It was owned by the top forty giant, KTKT, and largely neglected. The only paid person at the station was Dr. Lambert, a professor at The University of Arizona. He programmed the music and got announcers to work…for free.\n\nIn the spring of 1957 I got a lead that they were looking for some announcers at the station. I applied and got the job. I told Burt about it. He applied and got one, too. Our shifts were on weekends and the pay was zero. Zed, zilch. You worked for experience so “someday you could enter the highly paid world of professional disc jockeys on a station where folks really listened.”\n\nOne small problem: we lived way on the east side of Tucson and the station was on the west side. We were only 15 and couldn’t drive yet. Good old Mom. My mother used to drive us to our shifts.\n\nBut, we were disc jockey!! My folks had to go out and buy a radio in order to listen. And, that was not easy to find. We played classical music on the weekends, and we were awful! First, there wasn’t much to say. Popular music tunes may have lasted two minutes, but classical pieces lasted for hours. Really boring. But, the few things we had to say we really made the most of it and screwed it up royally. At least I did. Burt was more erudite than I was.\n\nI can remember introducing Pablo Casals and his cello. It was more like Pablo Castles and his Sello. And music by Wagner. No, not VOGner, I mean Wagner. Whew. There was an old lady who lived in the foothills, Mrs. Fischer, who called constantly to correct me. I’m sure she was my only listener.\n\nSummer came, Mom got tired of driving, and we both quit. It was a great experience for a fifteen year old.\n\nFINALLY, A JOB THAT PAID!\n\nA buddy of mine from Catalina High, Ted Bowen, had a job as a “prop boy” at KOLD-TV, CBS, in Tucson. These were the days of no video tape. Everything that went out over the air, went out live, just as it was done. Scary business. So in order to put up and take down displays quickly in and between programs, they had a kid on duty and that was his job…put up and tear down displays. Ted was getting ready to graduate and asked me if I was interested.\n\nInterested? Are you kidding…a job in TV. I found out it even paid money!! A buck an hour. Heck, minimum wage at that time was about fifty cents. This was big time. I went down, applied for the job and got it. This was the spring of 1958. I just got my driver’s license and a car and I needed gas money. I worked about 20 hours a week, nighttime and weekends so it didn’t interfere with school.\n\nOne of the shows I specifically remember was the Sunday morning local cartoon program hosted by Herb Lahr. He was the son of comedy actor Bert Lahr who played the lion in The Wizard of Oz. I would rush between segments setting up kids shoes and cookies. Actually the job was pretty boring. Lots of time between shows with nothing to do but sit around…and watch tv.\n\nThis was the golden age of TV, at least in Tucson. We were all learning what to do and how to do it. Nobody knew very much. In Tucson you either ran network shows live, or you would run in on film, or kinescope, later. Take the Ed Sullivan Show. It ran at 8 in New York, 7 in Chicago, and delayed everywhere else. So when Elvis appeared for the first time, we saw him a week later on scratchy poor quality “kinescopes.” That was basically a camera taking movies of the TV screen.\n\nI worked here for 3 months, then left to go to Chicago to live with my Dad for the summer.\n\nWhen summer was over I came back to Tucson for my senior year in high school. Mom was managing some apartments, so that’s where we lived. One of our guests was working at a local radio station. He heard I had some experience and asked if I would be interested in a job after school. Would I! It was at a small station, KTUC, 1400 on the dial and a lowly 250 watts. Their programming was a mish mosh of talk and musical standards. I didn’t care, it was radio.\n\nThe job? I hosted the “Courteous Driver Show.” Every afternoon after school I would go out with a police officer and we would look for a courteous driver; someone who was nice to someone else. Then the cop would stop the person and I would interview them for the program with my portable tape recorder, award them some prizes, and do a commercial for a car insurance company.\n\nIt’s not easy to find a courteous driver. After trial and error we found the perfect solution. We would wait by the old Broadway underpass where it went from two lanes to one lane. Someone always had to give way to another driver. That was our courteous driver. Then I would go back to the station with the tape and they would put it on the air — piece of cake. Took about an hour and I got paid $5 a day. Hot stuff. Several weeks went by with this boffo, socko routine that I’m sure made listeners hang on my every word. It all came to an abrupt halt one afternoon as I wandered in from the road with my newest tape. I ran into the station’s general manager in the hallway and he said, “Well, who’d you get today?”\n\n“Nice Negro man.” I said. The terms “black” or “Aftrican-American” were not used in those days.\n\nA look of panic crossed the manager’s face.\n\n“What gift did you give him,” he asked.\n\n“Dinner for two at Mama Louisa’s Italian Restaurant,” I replied.\n\n“Oh, no! You’ve got to get that certificate back. Call him. Give him some records instead. They don’t serve niggers in that restaurant. Go on, get on the phone.”\n\nI was shocked. First, I grew up in all white neighborhoods in the midwest. It just never occurred to me that blacks couldn’t enjoy the same things we did. Second, whenever my Dad would hear someone use the “n” word, he would always tell me that everyone was equal and it was just wrong to ever use a racial slur.\n\nI told the manager that I wasn’t going to call the guy, that it was wrong, and I wouldn’t insult him like that. I also told him, “I quit.” That was it, I walked out the door and never went back.\n\nOne of my first lessons in the real world. That restaurant stayed in business for years and whenever I drove by I would think about that day. I never ate there.\n\nCOLLEGE? ARE YOU KIDDING!\n\nNOT WHEN I CAN BE A FULL TIME DJ.\n\nI graduated from high school and went to college at the University of Arizona. I was a month into my freshman year and still attempting to promote our latest Zoom Record, Doreen by the Nightbeats. I discovered, much to my dismay, that in college, unlike high school, you really had to study. What a bummer. That was no fun. I was not even 18 yet and I just wanted to have fun. But, mostly I wanted to be on the radio.\n\nOne fateful Friday night I was at KAIR radio, 1490 on the dial, and close to dead last in the rating books. I was there to promote our record. I had met the disc jockey, Johnny Hyde, before. He was sick as a dog that night with the flu. He took one look at me and said, “Hey, you’ve got some radio experience, doncha?” I’ve got to go home and go to bed, how about sitting in for me tonight on my show?”\n\nMind sitting in? Like I would mind a date with Jayne Mansfield? Like I would mind finding a million dollars? Mind sitting in, I thought. My answer was affirmative.\n\nHe spent 5 minutes showing me the ropes, “Here are the records to play. Here are the commercials. Here is the program log…play the commercials it shows. Turn the mike on here when you want to talk. The next guy in will be at midnight, in 5 hours. Good luck.”\n\nHe walked out and in walked my short, unillustrious career as a disc jockey. What’s the first thing I did? I called my buddy Burt.\n\n“Hey, Burt. Guess what? I got a job as a disc jockey. I’m at KAIR and I’m on the air right now. Come on down and help me. You can do the news.”\n\nBurt came down and we “played radio” that night. It was fun.\n\nThe next day I got a call from the Station Manager. He said I sounded pretty good, and would I like to work full time. Bye-bye college, hello big time radio. Hah! Well, in just the 2 months I was going to school I was flunking all my courses anyway. The big time radio station job? KAIR was 250 watts of power, just barely made it past the city limits. And, the format…they’d been through about one a month. The month I started they were playing country and western.\n\nThe manager, Ron Barrington, offered me the 11pm-6am shift. For $37.50 a week. 75 cents an hour. But, remember in 1959 the minimum wage was just 50 cents an hour. I was awful, but it didn’t matter, I had no listeners anyway. I would have contests to give away prizes and nobody would call. Not one call. I had to make up the names of winners.\n\nI stayed at KAIR for six months and learned how to be a disc jockey, albeit a not very good one, but of course, I thought I was really hot stuff. The station struggled and went from country and western to easy listening to top forty. It never had many listeners. I even got a decent shift. After about 4 months I did the 6pm to 12m gig. Not much pay in either time slot although I think I progressed to a buck an hour. Wow. In March I got disgusted and quit. They convinced me to stay. The next week they fired me. It was the only time in my life I was fired and I learned a lesson. When you quit, quit. Don’t stay and get let go on their timetable.\n\nI was out of work and the prospects didn’t look good in radio and TV so I delivered flowers for about 3 weeks just to keep eating. Then an old high school buddy, Gary Palant, called and asked if I would like a job in TV. Let’s see now, I could either deliver flowers or work in TV. Tough decision, but I decided on TV.\n\nSTILL THE GOLDEN AGE OF TV…\n\nAND STILL JUST CLOWNING AROUNDING!\n\nSo, in May of 1960 I was hired as an announcer at KGUN-TV, Channel 9, ABC in Tucson. It was still the golden age of TV, defined by that period of time before videotape. Oh, there was just the beginning of videotape at the networks, but in Tucson it was only a dream. Everything we did was live. We didn’t even have an audiotape machine. So, I worked every night from 4pm-sign off. You heard my not so golden tones announce every half hour, KGUN-TV, CHANNEL 9, TUCSON. Exciting, huh.\n\nI was only 19 at the time, but I always looked older, so I started doing some on-camera announcing in addition to the booth work. During the late movie I would go out in the studio, set up the props, hang the copy next to the camera, open up the lens, put my coat and tie on, and when the red light came on, make the pitch. When the light went off, I took off my coat and tie, closed the camera, put away the props, and waited to do the closing “Star Spangled Banner Announcement.”\n\nMostly it was sitting around watching TV…all those great Warner Bros. shows like Hawaiian Eye, Bronco, Sugarfoot, Bourbon St. Beat, 77 Sunset Strip, Surfside Six, Adventures in Paradise, et. al. And, the Untouchables, the number one TV show in 1960-1961.\n\nThe station decided to start a new kids show in the afternoon called Toy Time, sponsored by J.C. Penney. Some genius figured a clown on stilts would be just the right character. Tom-Tom, the world’s tallest clown. Paid an extra $25 a week. So, I learned how to walk on stilts…got pretty good as a matter of fact. Did the whole costume; white face, red nose, etc. Told jokes to the kids like, “Hey kids, what is yellow, weighs 1000 pounds, and flies?” “Two five hundred pound canaries!…let’s have another cartoon.” The sponsor finally came to his senses and after Christmas it was cancelled. I was about ready for something new, anyway.\n\nAfter a summer vacation in Chicago, I was back in Tucson looking for deejay work. I had a couple short stints at KTAN radio playing lots of Montovani and not saying much, and at KOLD radio, the old CBS station. It was the end of network radio as we knew it, but we still had a few left over shows like Arthur Godfrey. The audience was miniscule. But, I was always looking to getting on the town’s big rocker, KTKT. And, I bugged the program director, Guy Williams, unmercifully. Finally, I got my chance. Sunday morning from 6-12N.\n\nI was getting better and was eventually offered the 6pm-9pm slot and the Top Forty show on Saturday 10:30am-3pm. This was DJ heaven. The guiding force at KTKT was Frank Kalil, a real radio genius. The station sounded great. And, best of all, it had over 50% of the audience in a 10 station market.\n\nWhen you drove around town, half the cars had the KTKT sticker in the back window. And, all the record shops had the latest KTKT TOP FORTY CERTIFIED SOUND SURVEY\n\nGuy Williams, who hired me, left shortly after I arrived. (I’m sure there was no connection) He went to progressively larger markets and ended up at KMET in Los Angeles where he pioneered FM rock under his real name, David Moorhead.\n\nI stayed at KTKT from 1962 until 1965 when I graduated from the University of Arizona. I was newly married and decided I needed to do more with my life than be a disc jockey. I wasn’t a great disc jockey, so that was a big part of my decision. I was okay, but not great.\n\nOne day the GM Phil Richardson asked me what I planned to do after graduation. I said, I didn’t know. He suggested I get into radio sales…selling advertising. Sounded good. After all, how hard could it be selling commercials on the number one station in town?\n\nWell, considering the other, older salesmen had all the good accounts, it was hard. But, I did okay, and 4 months later was offered a job at their sister sation, KRUX in Phoenix. We packed up and moved to the biggest city in Arizona.\n\nAs a tribute to the management at KTKT, the first thing I noticed about my new station was…it was not as good as KTKT. It wasn’t as sharp or as bright. And, the jocks weren’t as good. Looking back at it now, KTKT in Tucson from the late 1950’s to the late 1970’s (when FM radio took over rock radio) was one great radio station. It was fun to listen to and even better to work there.\n\nThe disc jockeys were all pros. In addition there were Lloyd Couch, Roger Galloway, and Gene Adelstein in the news department. Other jocks included Joe Bailey, Mike Hunter, and Dick Nelson.\n\nKRUX-PHOENIX, HOME OF THE “GOOD GUYS”\n\nIn 1965 I started my radio career in Phoenix, which was the last radio show I ever had. Al McCoy, Program Director, (now voice of the Phoenix Suns) hired me for a part time gig on Sunday morning 6am-12n. I was a full time salesman for the station so this was a way of picking up a few extra bucks.\n\nAl didn’t like the name I used in Tucson, Ray Lindstrom, which I liked of course because it was my real name. Nobody used real names in those days. You had to have an “air name”; something slick, smooth, and easy to remember. So, he dubbed me Ray Lindy.\n\nWho was on the station and what happened to them?\n\nLUCKY LAWRENCE (Real name: Larry Wright) Larry never saw a glass of booze he didn’t like. Everyday after work he was on a stool at Kim’s Bar. Smoked like a chimney. Then he found Christ and changed his life. Really a terrific guy. For the last 20 years or so he was an inspiring speaker and leader of the Abundant Life Ministries of Phoenix. He passed away recently.\n\nNORM SEELEY (His real name!) I ran into him a few years ago. Good voice, but quit the business. Inherited some money and has no financial worries. Been retired for years.\n\nDICK GRAY (Real name: Richard Snyder) Real nice guy; good voice. Had marital problems. One New Year’s Eve in the late 1960’s at a party, found his wife messing with someone else, and tragically ended his life with a garage full of carbon monoxide. He’d been drinking heavily that night and that’s what probably caused it. Booze.\n\nKIT CARSON (Real name: Charles Carson) Somebody says he became a lawyer. I knew him when he was a pilot. Well rounded guy. Lost track of him many years ago.\n\nJACK DANIELS (Real name: Harold Shumway) AKA Mike Mitchell. Actually I knew him best by the moniker Mike Mitchell. Mike was, and is a real smart guy. He had his FCC first class license and was a disc jockey at powerhouse KOMA in Oklahoma City for a while in the 60’s. He sold time for KUPD in Phoenix also. Then he built 2 radio stations in Wickenburg, sold them, and is now retired. I have contact with him to this day. Probably the richest of all the jocks on this survey.\n\nWILKERSON (Real name: Dennis Wilkerson) The all night man. Certainly the most well read person on the staff, and had the best broadcasting career. For a while in the 1980’s was the leading anchor man for a top Atlanta TV staion. I saw him in the late 1980’s when he was a reporter for a San Diego TV station.\n\nIn 1968 I left KRUX for KTAR-TV, the local NBC-TV station. That was the end of my radio disc jockey career. It was a great time. I met some terrific people. It was the days of the great top forty stations. In those days you played what was popular, no matter what the format. If it sold, you played it. Your top forty survey could include everybody from The Rolling Stones to Dean Martin to Elvis Presley to Percy Faith to The Trashmen to Frank Sinatra to Chuck Berry and everybody in between.\n\nToday if I walk into a station to record spots for my business it is like walking into a hospital. Antiseptic. No character. No tapes. Just a computer and a microphone. The good times are gone for good. But, ooooh, they were good!\n\nI stayed at KTAR until 1972 when I went out to open my advertising agency. That was my last broadcast job, or any job really. I’ve been unemployed ever since.\n\n–Ray Lindstrom\n\n1010 KXXT\n\nJames Crystal Enterprises\n\nAIR AMERICA\n\nTolleson\n\nOld call letters: KHCS Religion; KCAC [the Valley’s original Progressive Rock station in the late ’60s] KXEG began Christian programming on 1010 in 1972.

The station was All-Sports in fact for a period in the late ’80s.,switched to Spanish late 1994.\n\nSINGER LEE HAZELWOOD’S RADIO CAREER — In 1953 he became a country DJ at KCKY radio in Coolidge. He earned $40 a week with this job.\n\nLee developed his own on-air style with the help of characters, which he pre-recorded on tape. He talked to them #live’ on the air. Among them was a Gabby Hayes sound-alike character Lee named Eb X. Preston.\n\nThe start of Lee’s career in the music industry was in fact caused by the frequent visits to the KCKY radio station in 1994 by the young Duane Eddy, newly arrived from Bath (New York) and whose father worked at the local Safeway store. …The association soon developed into a working one. Duane played guitar on KCKY in a duet with his high school buddy Jimmy Delbridge, on piano. The two had auditioned for Lee at the station singing with a Louvin Brothers harmony vocal style and ended up performing every week for 15 minutes. The duo even formed a band, The Pinal County Twisters and their first job was a show at the Pinal County Fair.\n\nIn 1955 Lee Hazelwood started as a DJ at KRUX radio in Phoenix after he had been fired by KCKY in Coolidge the day before. The gig lasted approx. 1 year before Hazelwood moved on to a recording career in music.\n\nSource: The Lee Hazelwood Story\n\n1190 KMYL\n\nInterstate Broadcasting of AZ\n\nSyndicated Talk\n\nTolleson\n\nOld call letters: 1190 in Tolleson originally signed on by E.O.Smith as KZON, before trying a Spanish format and later becoming KRDS.

KISO [R&B;, later Country Oldies] KISO was eliminated when KOY moved to 1230 April 23, 1999. AMFM (formerly Chancellor) merged with Clear Channel in 2000.\n\nWe are aware that STEVE ALLEN started his career at KOY in Phoenix. But, DID YOU KNOW: the late MARTY ROBBINS was also a local media “star”. Marty Robbins, singer and songwriter, was born on Sept. 26, 1925 near Glendale, AZ. In 1947, he was hired to play and sing at radio station KTYL in Mesa. Later, he got a job at a bigger station, KPHO in Phoenix, where he was given an early morning half hour long show called, “Chuck Wagon Time”. When KPHO-TV was created, they asked Marty to do some live performances for them. Marty, who was extremely shy, agreed to host their show only after he was told he would lose his radio show if he refused. His fifteen minute show, “Country Caravan,” was shown four days a week and was a big hit.\n\nAnother country music star bought a Phoenix radio station and later many more, plus a baseball team. Gene Autry bought radio station KPHO in Phoenix near the end of World War II. Later, he acquired a television station in Phoenix, KOOL. His radio and TV empire began to grow. He purchased radio station KMPC in Los Angeles for $800,000 in 1952 and tv station KTLA for $12 million in 1964. He sold KMPC in 1984 for a reported $18 million and KTLA in 1982 for $245 million. His Golden West Broadcasters also included radio stations in San Francisco and Seattle.\n\n1280 KXEG\n\nJames Crystal Radio\n\nChristian\n\nPhoenix\n\nChristian formats since sign on in 1956; Was KHEP until May 31, 1999, when it became KTKP (Talk) added morning and afternoon AP Network news blocks in January 2001, replacing most syndicated talk shows.

Larry was in radio broadcasting for 26 years and became Arizona’s leading disc jockey in the 1960s under the name Lucky Lawrence.\n\nDeteriorating health including rheumatoid arthritis and throat cancer started to limit Larry’s traveling, but his schedule remained full with two Bible Studies and a position as teaching pastor at Northwest Community Church. Larry always said he wouldn’t stop talking about Jesus Christ until he was physically and verbally unable. It was Sunday morning at Northwest Community Church when Larry, preparing to do what God had gifted him to do so many times before, suffered a heart attack…..\n\nGreat source for stories about AZ media memories… AZSURVIVORS.COM\n\nHi, When I saw my name in the column of “do you remembers” I was astounded. I was at the giant of Tucson, KTKT, until 1965, when I was brought to Phoenix in radio sales at KRUX. They had an opening on Sunday morning 6am to 12 noon. I was Ray Lindstrom (my real name) in Tucson. PD Al McCoy said the name wasn’t good for radio, thus he dubbed me “Ray Lindy.” The Sunday gig allowed me to pick up, yes, choke, an extra, wow, $20 a week. A little over $3 an hour. Of course, the minimum wage then was $1 an hour. And, I replaced God in that time slot.\n\nWhat, God? Yes. The jock who had that time period before me was a guy named Alan Jeffory. He had been in big market radio; great voice. So great in fact they used his voice as (no lie) God in the movie Ten Commandments. So, the question was, why would they want to replace a guy with the voice of God for an unknown part-timer from Tucson. Unfortunately (or fortunately for me), Mr. Jeffory liked to break format by playing the spoons. Management just didn’t go wild over a clicking spoon rendition of “Lady of Spain” between The Beatles and Rolling Stones. Apparently they couldn’t break him of the spoon playing urge, thus the introduction of Ray Lindy. Of course, I always enjoy telling the story of the time I replaced God on the radio because he liked to play the spoons. I still keep in touch with some of my old friends from those days, like Al McCoy, Mike Mitchell (owner of KSWG in Wickenburg), and Bob Shannon (now calling himself R. W. Adams, owner of an acting school in Hollywood…he has appeared in TV shows including Law and Order).\n\nI owned an advertising agency and infomercial company in Phoenix. Now I am in Laughlin, NV selling watches thewatchman.com . Forbes Magazine has dubbed me The Sultan of Shlock. And, it all started when I replaced…..never mind.\n\nKeep up the good work with the site.\n\nRay Lindstrom aka Ray Lindy\n\nNov 1999\n\n— Anthony Gallegos, 38, despondent over a pending divorce, climbed to nearly the top of a KPXQ radio tower, where he hanged himself as spectators watched below. The suicide happened Wednesday after a two hour attempt by police, firefighters and the man’s estranged wife to coax him down from the tower. His wife had filed for divorce in early October. The three KPXQ towers are in the 7300 block of West Camelback Road. Gallegos was not an employee of the radio station.\n\nMORE from LARADIO.COM: LARP – Is there a mentor or someone who helped you at a critical juncture in your career? Bob Pond: My interest in radio began at birth in the shadows of the WBBM-Chicago towers, where my dad was an engineer from 1932 to 1958, for the CBS o&o; (remember that term)! He taught me about the electrons so I could get my 1st class license ticket. It was my ticket to becoming a dj because, in those days, AM stations had to have a holder of a “1st ticket” on duty anytime they were directional.\n\nWhile in high school in Phoenix, the two jocks that let me “hang with them” made first string in 1956, when Bartell changed KRUX 1340 to 1360, upped the power from 250 to 5,000 watts, and took over the market. Before his big break, Johnny McKinney not only showed me how to do the mechanics of DJing in a professional way, at KONI (1400AM), but taught me to speak from the diaphragm and practice pronunciation and enunciation. (Those were the days!) The other mentor chosen by the legendary Bartell group was (the late) Jack Carney. Having learned the basics from Johnny, I produced, and participated in parodies on Jack’s nightly “fence-sitters” show on KPHO (910AM). The talented Mr. Carney was doing several voices between records, resulting in a one-man “zoo.” When he was chosen to go to KRUX, he dropped the shtick and did about the smoothest presentation of music I have heard. He was a master of “talk-up” – without a stopwatch. I became a dj from 7 – 9 p.m. at KPHO (for $1.25/hr) while attending ASU, got a full time break at Shel Engle’s KRIZ (1230), and moved on to KRUX when Johnny and Jack went on to KBOX (Dallas) and KYA (voice of the Bay), respectively. When Shel took over 1400, (then KXIV), he brought me over and hired Al Taylor from Bartell’s WOKY in Milwaukee. Al taught me to “present” the musical artists as if we were MCs at a live concert, rather than just guys sitting around playing their records. He taught me to get the time and frequency in after each record so listeners would remember where they tuned. At that time, stations only gave their call letters, assuming everyone knew their dial position and didn’t need to know the time except on the hour!\n\n1400 KSUN\n\nCabacos\n\nSPANISH\n\nPhoenix\n\nOld call letters: KONI; KXIV at one time, owned by Dick Van Dyke, MOR in the 70s with George Scott, Jack Dey, Jim Hutton, Jeff Munt, and Jim Spero. Frank Pollack was PD; Went to Spanish format in 1987\n\nRelated info: “You noted KONI, which I also started in downtown Phoenix in July 1953. They had a sister station, KELE, but that fx escapes me right now. Also simulcasted. Their tower atop the old Arizona Savings & Loan building (where KTAR had been for many years) blew down during a bad storm one Saturday afternoon. I was to go on in about an hour and was standing in the alley to escape the high winds when the first large piece of debris landed about 30 yards away. The RF breakers kicked out before there was any damage to the xmtr. We received permission from the FCC to use feed a wire antenna stretched across Central Avenue to the Adams Hotel. Had an archer shoot a lanyard across the street. The FCC was quite helpful too. When advised of our poor coverage from the long-wire antenna, they authorized an increase in power. KELE was dark for several months, however.” Bob Dreste\n\nJason,\n\nI was scanning over the AM radio page…and just a note about KSUN 1400…before it went Spanish in 1987 it was a jazz/urban A/C format, owned by former Detroit Lion’s receiver Leonard Thompson. The line up was as follows\n\n6-10 Keith Bell/PD who lated moved to morning news at KMEO\n\n10-2 Mike Lee (was also doing swing/weekends at Country FM KMZK as well) who joined K-Lite in 1987.\n\n2-6 Carlos Ibarra, now deceased.\n\n6-12 Larry Angulo\n\nI don’t remember who did overnights…some guy named Ricky who got fired for stealing cash from the GM’s office. The station also aired Phoenix Firebirds baseball. The format never took off, but the few promotions we did do brought out a very loyal audiance.\n\nBefore the Jazz/Urban A/C format the station had run the Radio AAHS format and almost went broke.\n\nAt the end, I remember being on the air and the power went off. I called SRP to report that the power to our transmitter was off and they told us when we came up with $2,000 they would turn it back on. We were dark for 3 days. Ahh…the cost of being a radio star in Phoenix.\n\nMoving to K-Lite was a dream come true. State of the art equipment and they paid their bills on time.\n\nHowever, Leonard Thompson was a stand up guy. When payroll was late one time, he paid us cash out of his pocket.\n\nLove the website.\n\nMike Lee\n\nHi Jason,\n\nI read the message on your website from Mike Lee about KSUN 1400 AM. If I can remember correctly, KSUN was ahead of its time programming a LOCAL Children’s Music (Sesame Street songs, etc.) format in 1985, five years before Radio AAHS debuted in Minneapolis. At night, after the kids went to bed, they changed their playlist to an R&B; mix competing with 1060 KUKQ.

Mike Morgan did nights followed by Charlie Martinez midnight to six.” [John Gibson, KOOL 94.5 FM] Calls were changed to KJJJ “KJ-92” until 1984. It remained Country but changed to KEZC “EZ Country” from 1984, and this lasted until 1985. In 1985, it debuted as “The Fire Station” with a CHR/Oldies hybrid format. At some point between 1985 and 1988, they dumped the “Fire Station” name and just called themselves “92.3 KKFR.” The Oldies were also phased out. In 1988, they started calling themselves “Power 92.” The format had also become Rhythmic CHR. July 4th at 4pm Steve Goddard opened the mic and was the first to utter the words “Power 92” according to Valley radio folklore. On December 16, 1993, under PD Rick Stacy, they dumped Rhythmic CHR and tried a truly awful Alternative-intensive Mainstream CHR format. It bombed. They began to move back towards their roots, and by April of 1995, they were a Rhythmic CHR again. The slogan was the tried-and-true “Today’s Hottest Music.” In July of 1997, they adopted the hip-hop/R&B; format with the “Where Hip-Hop Lives” slogan. In August of 1998, they brought back the “Today’s Hottest Music” slogan, but the format is still hip-hop and R&B.; Station spun off to EMMIS in the Clear Channel purchase of Chancellor (AMFM) stations.\n\nGlendale\n\n93.3 KDKB\n\nSandusky\n\nAOR\n\nOld call letters: KMND [Country]\n\nMesa\n\nLARADIO.COM: KYSR’s Danny Bonaduce had a job in Phoenix radio where he had to call himself Danny Partridge on the air. “I tried to get around it by just calling myself Danny, but the pd said, ‘You call yourself Danny Partridge four times an hour every day,” remembered the “Star” morning man. “He belittled me in front of the staff.”\n\n94.5 KOOL\n\nInfinity\n\n60s OLDIES; Purchased by Colfax Broadcasting May 1996, sold to AMFM Inc.

They were some form of Top 40 right up until September 2, 1993, at 12 Noon. That’s the day that Y-95 died, and for the next 24 hours or so, the station stunted with what it called “The American Radio Museum”.

THE studio was spartan at best, two Altec mono pa mixers side by side (one for left, the other for right channel) ancient Sparta cart deck and a beat to hell reel to reel. The old ribbon mic was pretty shot too. “Warm” did not adequately describe it.\n\nThe transmitter was less than 5 ft from the back of the board, and the room was rife with RF and various clicks, pops and hums.\n\nOnce Buck Owens bought the operation about ’68 or so (if you remember the ’60’s, you didn’t live it…), the decision was to try “Freeform Rock”.\n\nSo at midnight one Sunday night, KNIX signed off with showtunes. 6am Monday, it was Zappa, Traffic, Iron Butterfly, et. al., driving the doctor and dentist offices who had the ‘old’ KNIX on crazy.

The calls changed to KPTY in the Spring of 1997 to match the moniker.

The station starts out commercial free with no DJ’s. The music is only interrupted at the top of the hour by the legal ID and then every 15 minutes for brief recorded statements like “Real Album Rock, 106.5 Stereo”, or “We don’t talk much, 106.5 FM”, or “Thanks for listening – both of you! 106.5 FM”.

We think that is a bit TOO MUCH!\n\nIf you’ve had it “up to here” with the same crappy Christmas tunes, [“Granma Got Run Over By…”] tune to 89.5 KBAQ [K-BACH]. The Classics have never sounded so good. Cleanse your music palette with the soothing sounds from the Valley’s Classical station. Second choice might be 95.5 KYOT. Starting Christmas eve, “The Coyote” [smooth jazz] plays 36 hours of holiday songs. If you can pick it up, KAHM 102.1 might also be a safe haven.\n\nPRESTON WESTMORLAND and listeners discussed the topic of telemarketing on KTAR this afternoon. The answers to that problem ranged from “getting an answering machine” and “caller I.D. blocking” to “just hanging up.” An angry telemarketer gave PRESTON a piece of his mind. His argument “for” did not stand up to the general complaints of listeners who were fed up with this irritating situation.\n\nKTAR made one of my Christmas wishes come true!

NO Oldies, NO easy listening. My feeling is that changes will only be made if there is a major management shuffle at Jacor when the Clear Channel deal is done. We’ll see, but that’s my $.02. Is it just me, or has the AM programming in this town started to sound better and have more personality than anything on the FM? For me it’s talk or kids only!

Also participating in the production, ALICE COOPER and wife SHERYL, plus from “WALLACE & LADMO”, BILL THOMPSON. See it live or catch it on KTAR.\n\n**** 1998 The way it was/the way it ended up…. It started out with KEZ #1 [12+] in the 1997 4th quarter book. KNIX was #2 and KOOL was third. Don’t get me started on what became of KOOL. KRTH-Los Angeles morning personality CHARLIE VAN DYKE was still in Phoenix at EAGLE 96.9. JACOR purchased the station and changed the call letters to KMXP. Nice call letters, same format as KZZP no matter what the “positioning statement” says. KSLX altered it’s format when the Eagle flew off. “The Evolution of Rock” includes much of the Eagle playlist in hopes of catching ex-Eagle listeners. KRIM changed format to Oldies and call letters to KBZG. The signal is spotty in Valley areas, translators help just a bit, ratings show no significant life. TY FLINT moves from KUBE Seattle to do mornings with LINDSEY CIPSIC at the new “HOT” 105.9 KHOT [formerly KBUQ]. LISA TRYGG and JERRY DIXON were added to the line-up later. The JAMMIN’ OLDIES station was up slightly in the last book. JUNE THOMSON returned from SAN FRANCISCO and landed at KPHO CBS 5. RON HOON moved to KSAZ TV 10. BOB BOZE BELL & DAVID K. JONES took the morning talk shift at KXAM. KCCF was sold to North American Broadcasting, bringing to an end the dream of RAY COX (owner). BILL HEYWOOD moved from KCCF to KTAR, getting out of his contract early, long before the station sale. TOAD HALL died in March, he was 55. BRUCE KIRK was dumped by KTAR. KISO changed from R&B; to country oldies. It’s automated. KFNN owner RON COHEN bought another station, KNUU Las Vegas, selling advertisers spots on both stations. KOY went live and local with DANNY DAVIS & CHARLIE MARTIN in the morning. TIM & WILLY couldn’t save KWCY. The “Wild Country” station was canned/automated, put on the block, and TIM & WILLY were moved to mornings at sister station KNIX. STEVE HARMON was fired from KNIX and eventually found a gig in Pennsylvania. KWCY was bought by Z Spanish. Childrens Broadcasting Corp. sold it’s stations, including KIDR 740, to Catholic Radio Networks. In an amendment to that sale, some of the stations, including KIDR, were sold to RADIO UNICA. KRXS changed format to a more “mainstream” album rock format and added ART BELL to it’s line-up. That’s talkradio on FM! Imagine that. Where could they go with this? IMUS In the Morning? This station could be dangerous with a slight signal improvement. Both KDKB & KPTY paid a price for profanities broadcast over the air. DAVE PRATT got a new partner in LAURIE MICHAELS. KYOT stretched the definition of “Smooth Jazz” several times with soft rock and AC cuts interspersed with Kenny G. RICK SHOCKLEY replaced BRIAN CASEY as PD at KOOL in June. BRUCE KELLY was fired or quit KKFR. He bounced back and took over mornings at KZZP with sidekick LOU VALENTINO. TED SIMONS moved from mornings at KZON to afternoon news at KTAR. KTAR/KMVP/KKLT sold to HEARST-ARGYLE. KTAR gave TOM DILLON a new contract. It forbade him from broadcasting games for teams not associated with KTAR. DILLON walked. After more than a decade as GM at KESZ [nee KLZI], JERRY RYAN was fired. He is now with BRENTLINGER BROADCASTING. OwensMAC Broadcasting was formed. Owens Broadcasting took control of MACAmerica’s KESZ. Owens Broadcasting sold KCWW to DISNEY. KGME boosted it’s signal to 50kw. Chancellor bought KFYI & KKFR. Clear Channel is buying Jacor. There are many other salesformat changes to come. We will keep you posted, right here!\n\nHi can you tell me what happened to “The Eagle”, I noticed you said it died. I visit the Phoenix Metro area pretty regularly and listened to the station when I was there and I’m surprised to see it go. Can you also tell me what happened to “Lou” the female afternoon drivetime presenter. Many thanks. Andy” –JACOR bought the station and changed the format to a KZZP clone [see our Radio Dial page] and LOU VALENTINO went to KZZP to share morning drive duties with BRUCE KELLY. Latest rumors run from 96.9 soon changing hands again or just a format change to Easy Listening or Oldies. The Easy Listening format is unlikely [people reminisce about KMEO too much] but any good Oldies station can clean up in Phoenix. KOOL numbers are on the way down, from 4th to 11th [in 3 books].\n\nThe new KTAR 620 website is up. Be careful typing the address in. Someone has snagged the KTAR.com address and has put some naughty things there. You may just want to click here to go to KTAR620.COM – THE KTAR 620 Website. You’ll find sound bites, interviews, and station personality info.\n\nWho is that doing afternoon drive at JAMMIN’ OLDIES 105 in New York??\n\n6-10a — AL BANDIERO & PATTY STEELE\n\n10a-2p — CAROL FORD\n\n2-6p — SUPERSNAKE\n\n6-10p — LINDA ENERGY\n\n10p-2a — CYBERJOCK (ED MCMANN, DIANA STEELE, DALE DORMAN, JOJO KINCAID)\n\n2-6a — ANN DURAN\n\nJANUARY 1999\n\nFormer KOOL FM morning personality Rick “Coach” Marshall makes his return to Chancellor Oldies KXKL 105.1 FM (Cool 105) Denver this week. Marshall had left KXKL a couple of years ago to join Chancellor Oldies KOOL 94.5. Marshall will do mornings with Paxton Mills.\n\nALAN STEIGLITZ was ousted from his position as GM at KOOL 94.5 this week. Regional Marketing Manager, Clancy Woods, will over see ALL CHANCELLOR stations in Phoenix … then announce the new GM for KOOL, who will over see KOOL & KMLE.\n\nHEFTEL is purchasing “The NEW HOT 105.9” KHOT! New Format: Spanish — the change comes sometime in March. That’s approx. $18. million to current owners New Century Arizona. KHOT currently runs an R&B; Oldies format.\n\nKZZP’s BRUCE KELLY announced he has a drinking problem and will be taking time off to recover. KZZP management is allowing him this time until sometime in March.\n\nCorrection: [Thanks to Bruce St. James of KKFR] Eric Edwards, Production Director at KPWR Los Angeles is our image voice. All the work is produced in house by our Production Director, Mark Casoli. I’d hate to see slighted some of the guys that do such great work for Power 92.\n\nKESP 101.1 FM is now promoting itself as “LOOP 101.” Behind the construction and street traffic sound effects, BRENTLINGER BROADCASTING is reshaping it’s recently debuted radio station. KESP has a great mix of Oldies from the 70s and 60s. There are some great tunes you won’t hear on KOOL FM, such as: DEAR PRUDENCE/BEATLES – OLD DAYS/CHICAGO – I PUT A SPELL ON YOU/CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL – JUST LIKE A WOMAN/BOB DYLAN. Deeper cuts, better variety, larger playlist.\n\nMovement…KPTY 103.9 “Party Radio” morning man BIG MAMA is headed to nights to WILD 98.7 in sunny Tampa….CHARLIE MORRIS (formerly CHARLIE MONOXIDE) at KLPX Tucson is the new host of CHARLIE & COMPANY, debuting February 1st on WZGC (Z93) in Atlanta.\n\nDuring an ASU sports broadcast, the KMVP board op missed a queue for commercials. One sports announcer, thinking he was off the air, was heard to say [slightly off mic] “I gotta cool it on these Diet Cokes. I have to take a wizz!”\n\nKWCY is running promos for KNIX, mentioning the change in KWCY ownership and format. KWCY was purchased a couple months ago by Z Spanish Broadcasting.\n\nGREG “3RD DEGREE” BURNS leaves his Marketing Manager position at KPTY 103.9 and has moved across town to 95.5 KYOT, this time as a Media Consultant.\n\nChildren’s Broadcasting Corporation announced it has completed the sale of its last 3 radio stations. Radio Unica Corp. paid CBC approximately $29.25 million in cash for WJDM/WBAH-AM, Elizabeth, New Jersey, KAHZ-AM, Fort Worth, Texas and KIDR-AM, Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nPress Release: KOOL 94.5 HAS A WINNER [January 13, 1999]\n\n(Phoenix)…KOOL 94.5 is proud to announce the addition of Bill Gardner, Billboard Magazine’s Major Market Personality of the Year, to host the morning time slot.\n\nGardner comes to Phoenix with over 31 years of broadcast experience, including stints at WFIL and WIBG in Philadelphia, KCBQ in San Diego and KVIL in Dallas. Gardner says, “Mornings on KOOL 94.5 is genuinely a dream situation.”\n\n“Happy New Year to KOOL 94.5 for finding Bill. He is the consummate pro. KOOL 94.5 has waited years to find a talent like Bill Gardner. Now Phoenix will find out what morning radio is all about,” says General Manager, Allen Stieglitz.\n\nKOOL 94.5 Program Director, Rick Shockley couldn’t agree more. “We are absolutely ecstatic to have someone of Bill’s caliber join the already great staff at KOOL 94.5. Bill’s a perfect fit.”\n\nGardner’s first day to wake-up Phoenix will be February 1, 1999.\n\nBrian Casey and “The Coach” are “out of the game” at Chancellor’s KOOL FM. Casey, former KOOL PD will be replaced by BILL GARDNER. KOOL veteran TOM PEAKE will most likely continue to do the morning show until GARDNER takes over February 1st. GARDNER has sweated over hot turntables at stations such as KVIL/Dallas, WIBG & WFIL/Philadelphia and KCBQ/San Diego.\n\nKMXP (MIX 96.9) & KZZP PD DAN PERSIGEHL has been promoted to OM, and MD DAVE COOPER is the new PD of the stations. COOPER will also handle the music as well, for now.\n\nCHUCK BUELL has left KKLT (98.7) to do mornings at KBZT, Jefferson-Pilot’s oldies outlet in San Diego. That areas “North County Times” referred to BUELL as a “baby boomer” who’s worked at stations in Denver, Chicago, Phoenix and San Francisco. BUELL replaces longtime local DJs KEN COPPER and CYNTHIA HEATH, who were sacked last month from their morning show DJ duties. BUELL plans to be on the air by Feb. 1. KBest program director KIPPER MCGEE said “BUELL will bring more of a contemporary feel to the morning show.”\n\nProgrammer John Sebastian is back. Scouting his next station, Sebastian is not only looking at just “music” stations, but maybe talkradio. Sebastian developed the KUPD format in 1979, and brought KSLX back to life in the mid 90’s. He has been at many of the major stations including: KRIZ & KRUX Phoenix back in the 70s, KHJ Los Angeles, KDWB Minneapolis….\n\nSince MIKE GOLIC has gone full-time with ESPN, an opening has occured at KGME 1360. Taking over that spot is JIM TRABER. He joins BRUCE JACOBS on the sportstalk station morning show.\n\nIn mid-January, Jacor Communications Inc. is launching a country music network in Ohio. The Buckeye Country Network will originate out of Jacor’s country station in Columbus, WCOL-FM, and will include six or seven of the broadcaster’s smaller stations in that region. “We can improve the quality of the programming in the smaller markets by importing the talent from other stations,” said Tom Owens, Covington-based Jacor’s senior vice president of programming. Creating regional networks also lowers operating costs of the smaller stations and provides Jacor a package deal to offer advertisers. It’s part of the broadcaster’s plan to bring the many low-performing “stick” stations it has acquired over the last three years into profitability. In addition to the Buckeye Country Network, Owens said Jacor is also launching a nine-station “oldies” regional network out of Las Vegas. Expect more such announcements down the road, he said.\n\nFinally, the tight playlist gets tossed. 105.9 KHOT has over 1,000 tunes compiled for airplay in what they’re calling “R&B; A To Z.” New artists and titles will be added to the mix. This might be called the “R&B; Evolution” as KHOT follows KSLX in moving away from a redundant rotation.\n\nTIM MARANVILLE has until recently been operations manager at the three SANDUSKY rock stations in town. Now, due to the “dry spell” in new “rock” music, the stations are getting their seperate program directors. MARANVILLE will program just KDKB. J.J. JEFFRIES takes the PD duties at KUPD and morning man RICH CREEGER becomes PD at KSLX. Over at KUPD, Laurie Michaels has split to take on a new morning gig in Denver with her husband, formerly with KSLX, JOEY TEEHAN.\n\nMAILBAG: Wow! This is a great radio resource. When I started out in the broadcast business in 1960 I had no idea we’d be in touch with broadcasters all over the world with the click of a mouse. You’re invited to check out our award- winning weekly syndicated program at http://www.cowboylife.com Where each week’s show is heard in real audio. A link to our site would really be apreciated.\n\nRE: recent message from Lan Roberts, could this be the same Lan Roberts we used to listen to every day on KJR Seattle back in the mid ’60’s. What a great line up they had back then with Lan, Pat O’Day, Mike Phillips, Dick Curtis, etc.\n\nBest Regards\n\nHugh McLennan\n\n**** Yes, it’s the same LAN ROBERTS. We traced him to a small town in Texas. Drop him a line. lanbo@texoma.net\n\nMAILBAG: [On the subject of receiving some sort of response when sending an aircheck & resume] “It would be great if we responded in person to every job app, resume and industry song inquiry. The reality is that in this day and age few of us have the time or manpower to process the volume of unsolicited material we receive. At a previous station, (where I was afforded an Assistant) we responded to ALL applications in writing and even sent along a follow-up letter to simplify our files and fulfill our EEO requirements. In the 1 year I was there we sent out nearly 300 such letters. My Assistant spent countless hours with this process and I hope people appreciated at least an acknowledgment of receipt. Budgets being what they are, few of us have that type of help available anymore.\n\nNow, there is no way on Earth I can respond to every request made upon my time. Most PD’s receive as many or more phone calls than I do (over 30 actual calls a day) and many of those are job seekers. I do not screen my calls and I answer my own phone. I encourage people to send T&R;’s, but usually preface it with the fact that we are not currently in need of new talent. Those of you with jobs might appreciate the idea that your boss isn’t constantly shopping your gig.\n\nThe reality is, if I’m not in need of talent… I don’t actively seek it out. We can all dream the dream that an aircheck tape dropped in the mail is going to cause a PD to fire someone to make room for your immense talents. In the meantime, spewing venom and threatening payback might not be the best course of action. I can’t be the only one who appreciates persistence, and I usually like at least 2 “communication attempts” (from my Comm. 101 class) so I know the person is serious and not just blindly mailing to every station that starts with a “K”.\n\nGood luck in your job search!”\n\n[Name withheld by request]\n\n**** The issue boils down to common courtesy between professionals and [here] time & money. By the way, my immense talent caused an opening to occur in two cases I can recall. Though that was through “networking” rather than tape and resume, I believe it IS possible. I agree that persistence pays off and I trust/hope most jocks have done some research into each station they send a tape to.\n\nOn his inaugural weeknight KTAR broadcast, DAVID LIEBOWITZ took calls and kicked butt. As will happen, the audience for the JAY LAWRENCE show was offended and upset. Upset with change. LIEBOWITZ was unduly spit upon with all the venom these people could muster. Change happens! LIEBOWITZ, newspaper columnist, is new in the talkradio field. He is fresh, smart, opinionated and somewhat sarcastic. You get that from reading his newspaper column. He is also honest, thoughtful and caring. He is “the new blood.” Sleepy, evening talkradio could be a thing of the past in Phoenix. Get used to change. It is here to stay! [I think that was Yogi Berra that said that.] DAVID LIEBOWITZ has opinions that may not be politically correct. He might keep you awake later in the evening. He might make you think about the issues. Change is good.\n\nThe blustery winter weather problems across the country caused many flight delays at national airports. In fact, Phoenix commuter Charlie Van Dyke recently missed his morning show on KRTH Los Angeles due to airline traffic delays elsewhere.\n\nMAILBAG: Jack from Phoenix writes: “I was always under the assumption that those of us who decided on a career in broadcasting did so because we had something to say or in other words we are “Professional Communicators”. Then why is it that when you send a tape and resume to a PD or OM they don’t respond? No letter of acknowledgement, No call. Have they forgotten what it was like when they were looking for a job before they landed in the seat they are currently occupying. And if they think they’ll be in that chair forever, they better think again. I hope they remember broadcasters like myself who try to communicate with them when they are back on the street, and they will be [you know radio]. When I have held positions of management I always tried to remember what it was like when I first started out. Hoping for the phone to ring, checking the mail box daily for any kind of response. Personally I think the current crop of Program Directors/Operations Managers need to take a course in in Communications 101. Every month for nearly the past 6 months I have sent a tape and resume to every station in town that I feel I would fit in comfortably (about 7 stations) I have haven’t heard a word from any of them. They don’t even return phone calls. I’ll end here and thanks for letting me vent.” *** I’ve experienced this, Jack. A couple years ago, I sent tapes to about 8 stations in Phoenix. I heard back from KCCF and KMLE. The usual “we don’t have any positions open now, so until we do, hang by your thumbs.” [I joke– this is at least the response we want, even though we imagine all the PDs calling immediately with fabulous contracts and huge signing bonuses]. I got a call from KOOL, where I was eventually hired. The rest of the PDs didn’t bother to write or call. I imagined them tossing my tape into a box 3/4 full of rejected airchecks from other jocks around the country. I appreciated the responses I did get, this was not only courteous, but I believe the professional response. As PD, I had always taken the time to respond. I was well aware of the need to stay in touch/respond. As you say, that PD that tosses your tape aside without a response, may someday be working for YOU! By the way, when you get into a PD gig, let me know, I’ll send you a tape.\n\nABC’s “REAL COUNTRY” network weeknight talent, Mark Andrews, shoots us a note from Tempe with a little bio: Top 40, Beautiful Music, A/C, Nostalgia, [over the course of his career] and landed in Country to stay in 1981 at KWJJ in Portland, Oregon. Moved to the late KEBC in Oklahoma City as PD for two years before coming to the Real Country Network in 1991. I’ve got 30 years in this business under my belt, and feel very blessed that I continue to work in a craft I dearly love.” More about “REAL COUNTRY NETWORK” as I hear from Mark. They are still broadcasting to other parts of the nation from studios in Tempe.\n\nMAILBAG “Thanks again for your continued listener ship of KXAM! I set up the interview with Eddie Albert and Bill Straus about two months ago, and it continues to be one of my favorite shows! A comment on an earlier comment of yours: I have been in love with Uncle Russell Shaw’s voice and sense of humor since I came to the valley over ten years ago, and when we added Jones and Boze as our morning show I thought it appropriate to call up Unca Russ as well.\n\nTalk radio can be at times a wee bit, uh, [dry], so I thought by breaking up my liners and promos with a snappy sense of warp factor humor we could at least get a chuckle out of folks!\n\n….. we are adding MORE live, local, programming during the week and on the weekends starting this Saturday with “Choices” with Keith and Carol at 3 pm and “The Inner View – Adventures in Spirit” with Philip Burley at 4 pm. On Wednesday and Friday at noon, “The Well Tempered Investor” with David Sobol and Joe Scheid of Pollikov Financial will make all those confusing investment issues go away.\n\nSo thanks again to you Jason, my peers, and all those listeners out in Radio Land that support Independent 1310, KXAM! Regard for a Healthy and Successful New Year,\n\nTom Green\n\nDirector of Operations, KXAM\n\n[January 1, 1999] EDDIE ALBERT was a guest on a “Best of Straus” broadcast interview today on KXAM. 90 year old ALBERT sounds just like the character he played on “GREEN ACRES”. His topics, beside show-biz, were agriculture and his military career. Listeners shared conversation and some poetry with the great actor. This was a celebration of his 60 years in show business, from the mob movie “BROTHER RAT” to “GREEN ACRES”.\n\nIt’s starting to sound as though KESP 101.1 has the right mix of Oldies. There is some repetition, but there is more depth in the selections. DON HENLEY “SUNSET GRILL”, NILLSON “JUMP INTO THE FIRE”, SANTANA “OYE COMO VA”. NICE STUFF! This along with the FOUR TOPS, SPINNERS, AND GLADYS KNIGHT.\n\nFEBRUARY 1999\n\nFresno, California has a Z Spanish outlet that uses the calls, KHOT. The station is on the AM dial.\n\nMAILBAG: Actually, somewhere in between KTYL and KZZP, 104.7 FM had the calls KIOG, playing a progressive mix, and calling itself “The Alternative”–circa 1979-80. I do have an aircheck of the last day of the format, with Jeff Parets. (it includes a message from KUPD PD John Sebastian asking listeners to make the switch to KUPD) — JJJONES\n\n“The Storm” or “new wave” format from KCAC to KDKB, KIOG, KSTM, KONC and KEYX ran for the better part of the 80’s. Jeff Paret’s KIOG format was tweaked a bit and moved over to 107.1 KSTM when KIOG became KZZP in 1981. 107.1 “The Storm” was replaced by the Spanish language programming of KVVA in June 1987.\n\nIn searching for KIOG, turns out those call letters have not been picked up by any other radio station. Nor have the calls KEYX or KONC. KSTM is in use in Indianola, Iowa and KCAC is a non-commercial FM in Camden, Arkansas.\n\nKZZP 104.7 has altered it’s playlist for certain day-parts, including more “dance” music in the evenings. This half-hearted attempt to attract some of the KPTY 103.9/KKFR 92.5 audience would be like KKFR adding an hourly 5-minute newscast in an attempt to lure the KTAR listeners. But then, bold moves are not the method of today’s broadcast programmer.\n\nThe “NEW” KLNZ 103.5 is “La Zeta,” a Spanish-language station. “Wild Country 103.5” was sold by OwensMAC to ZSpanish, which also owns KVVA 107.1. Programming on the two stations will remain seperate. Another Spanish language station is coming in March. HEFTEL takes over 105.9 which is now KHOT “Jammin’ Oldies.”\n\nWhatever became of Phoenix’s old radio call letters? SUNNY 97 KPSN rattled KOOL FM’s cage a few years back, playing oldies before several format/call letter changes brought the frequency to the present Rock AC formatted KMXP. The call letters KPSN are now used in Payson for a TV station featuring the programming of COURT TV.\n\nKCHT is being used in Astoria, Oregon. It was really a reach, but those call letters signified the word “Hits” when used in Phoenix, before management realized the calls were more similar to a 4-letter word we shall not repeat here. The calls were changed to KHTC and later dropped for KGLQ. No station has picked up KHTC or KGLQ.\n\nWhen Phoenix (and the rest of the major markets) turned a deaf ear to the Beautiful music format, the KMEO call letters bounced to a place called Flower Mound, Texas. ABC owns that station. KOAZ lives on in Oro Valley, AZ.\n\nBefore there was KZZP, KTYL operated at 104.7. In fact, it was the first FM on the air in the Valley of the Sun (1950). The Mesa station switched from KTYL to KZZP and then to KVRY for a short period and finally reclaimed the KZZP calls. KTYL is now an AM/FM combo in Tyler, Texas. Oddly enough, the “Variety” calls KVRY haven’t shown up anywhere (do you detect a bit of sarcasm here?)\n\nKCCF has a new home in Ferndale, Washington, near the Canadian border. There is also a TV station in Katy, Texas with those calls. It’s legal to have two seperately owned stations in seperate markets share the same call letters. But, do you see some sort of Texas connection going on? Ponderous.\n\nKRIZ is now an R&B; station on the AM dial in Renton/Seattle, Washington. KRUX FM operates from Las Cruces, New Mexico. KTWC (remember “Twice 103.5”?) is not currently assigned to a radio station, nor is KBUQ. That “Young Country” format seems to be taking a hit in many markets anyway.\n\nPrior to KTAR, we had KFCB at 620 AM. Those calls haven’t been in use lately.\n\nAbout KCCF: The old KCCF in Phoenix is getting it’s own commemorative web page. When the web author notifies us, we’ll tell you how to find it. It is under construction at this time.\n\nKTAR’s Pat McMahon was given the “Real McCoy”, a lifetime achievement award. Also picking up awards during the evening were KTAR’s Brad Cesmat, W. Steven Martin from KNIX for community service and Camelback Jack of KOOL for best afternoon show. Al McCoy from KTAR won for best play-by-play.\n\nMAILBAG: On Friday, at 6:00 pm, KZZP began evolving from Modern AC to CHR! They are playing about 3 new CHR tracks per hour, in addition to the Modern AC tunes that they already have on their playlist.\n\nIt’s now 7:54 pm…here is what I’ve heard since 6:00:\n\nCher “Believe” (Dance); Will Smith – can’t recall which tune it was (R&B;/borderline mainstream hip-hop); Brandy “Have You Ever?” (R&B;); ‘N Sync “I Want You Back” (Pop/Dance); Britney Spears “Baby One More Time” (Pop/Dance); Tone Loc “Wild Thing” (“retro” rap track from late 80’s); Monica, “Angel of Mine” (R&B;);\n\nThey are also running promos claiming that you can hear all the hits on ONE station. This promo features All Saints “Never Ever” (a Pop tune) with two Modern AC songs.\n\nAt this point, I would say KZZP is a Modern-intensive CHR, because they are in the process of evolving. I expect them to become even more like a true CHR as the weeks progress.\n\nIt’s about time!!! I haven’t been this excited about radio in this town in AGES!\n\nTanim (Phoenix Media MessageBoard)\n\nBruce Kelly’s partner at KZZP 104.7, Lu Valentino is out the door. Sources say Valentino had been on thin ice since a late January incident at Disneyland. Dan Persigehl has moved market veteran Jackie West out of evenings to partner with him in morning drive, at least until Kelly’s return in early March. General manager Dave Pugh says a search is beginning for a permanent replacement for Valentino.\n\nThe legendary HUMBLE HARVE starts at Westwood One’s Oldies Channel this month. NOT available in Phoenix.\n\n“It’s not your mother’s radio station anymore.” ALICE COOPER liner heard on 620 Newsradio KTAR.\n\nPremiere Networks’ JIM ROME is in the middle of contract negotiations and will cut his sports radio show “The Jungle” [KGME 1360 in Phoenix] to three hours sometime in the next few months. The reason for dropping an hour? Rome is having to spend more time on his Fox Sports Television show.\n\nRadio programmer John Sebastian will have a show on KXAM from 4-7 pm weekdays starting Monday, February 15.\n\nERIC STEIN writes: It looks like the controversial KPTY is bringing in the syndicated Mancow Muller radio program from Chicago for their new morning program. From what I’ve heard, his program is formatted like Howard Stern’s (Stern calls Mancow an “imitator” – even though he’s beating Stern in the Chicago ratings). This is not the first time a Phoenix station has tried a Chicago personality on the radio – KZZP failed to bring listeners to Jonathan Brandmeier’s show back in 1996.\n\nMAILBAG: The BIG station in San Jose (KBAY) several years ago, both from a coverage standpoint and its Arbitron ranking, was owned by a partnership of families whose ancestors founded the station. They had resisted all purchase offers, even though they had received some very attractive proposals from, among others, a Spanish language group owner.\n\nAlong came the new rules and a company called American Radio Systems. ARS personified the “new look and feel” of broadcasting. One of its favorite come-ons was that broadcasters, due to the might and clout of new mega-owners, were no longer going to have to settle for the “7% share” of advertising budgets allocated to electronic media.\n\nARS offered really big bucks for KBAY that the owners couldn’t refuse. The Spanish folks offered even more, but the families declared that they did not want to see their fathers’ life’s work become a Spanish language outlet. ARS assured that it would keep the station just as it always was. “After all”, they said, “we aren’t buying loser stations to fix up–we want performers!”\n\nAfter the sale was announced, there was a big rah-rah meeting with the heads of ARS and the staff of the station. The blarney flowed so thick and fast in that meeting as to cause numbness. “We aren’t going to make any changes at these [there was an associated AM] stations. We know YOU FOLKS are the ones who made these stations great. The only difference you will see is that your job will be easier because you will have access to our corporate resources.” And on and on and on.\n\nAfter the meeting was over, salespeople and talent alike retired to offices to use the phones. I overheard such phrases as “we’re really excited about this…”, etc. Those few of us who had been around the block a few times shook our heads. “If these folks only knew!”\n\nAt closing, the ink wasn’t dry on the contract before ARS immediately spun off both stations. The monster FM to the Spanish folks–making a nice profit in the instant transaction, and the AM to another foreign language outfit. What was the heart and soul of KBAY was transferred over to a facility one-tenth as powerful as before, and massive changes were made. Syndicated programs were put in at night. The rest of the time went from live assist to full voice-tracking. The image of the station was changed from a unique blend of new-age/jazz to “Lite Rock” (the first time the “R”-word had ever been used at the station) and the playlist cut from 3000 cuts to about 300.\n\nIn other words, ARS screwed everyone: the original owners, the station’s personnel, the listeners. When what was left of the station was finally sold to CBS, ARS had made millions reducing a San Jose institution to formula crap. CBS, to its credit, is actually beginning a long, slow process of attempting to restore some of what-was, but the hatchet job done on the station ran wide and deep.\n\nAs ARS was acquiring stations with a vengeance right after the rules ch"
