        "text": "Phoenix Suns guard Eric Bledsoe is an athletic force on the basketball court, able to get to the rim at will as well as be a dogged defender.\n\nHe’s also a good guy.\n\nAs reported by AL.com, Bledsoe went home to Birmingham, AL last week to help out some local children. The 25-year-old Bledsoe was born in Birmingham and attended Parker High School.\n\nBledsoe, who played basketball at Birmingham’s A.H. Parker High School, sponsored the Eric Bledsoe Back to School Rally at Railroad Park. He helped distribute book bags and school supplies to the first 300 children in line. Food and entertainment was provided for the kids and their families.\n\n“This is a very special day for me to see the smiles on these kids faces when I hand them a book bag and school supplies,” said Bledsoe. “I never had anybody do anything like this for me when I was growing up but I’m from here and I want to make a difference in the community,” he said.\n\nBledsoe’s effort did not end there, though. Later Saturday, he held a celebrity basketball game with more than a thousand fans in attendance.\n\nAccording to Yahoo! Sports, Bledsoe scored 85 points. A noble effort, yes, but looks like he was topped by former Kentucky teammate and current Sacramento Kings star DeMarcus Cousins, who poured in 91."
