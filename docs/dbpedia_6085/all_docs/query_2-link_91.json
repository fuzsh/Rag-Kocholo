        "text": "PHOENIX — Bonneville Phoenix Thursday announced the launch of ESPN Phoenix (620 AM), which will take place Monday, September 15th, 2014.\n\nArizona Sports, which has been simulcasting on radio at 620 AM and 98.7 FM, will be heard exclusively on its FM dial position beginning the same day.\n\nBonneville Phoenix Vice President and Market Manager Scott Sutherland said the move helps meet both audience and advertiser demand.\n\n“It’s the best of both sports worlds,” said Sutherland, “as we’ll now be providing world-class local programming on Arizona Sports 98.7 as well as full time programming from the worldwide sports leader on ESPN Phoenix 620.”\n\nSutherland also noted that ESPN Phoenix 620 will attract many Valley sports fans who now live in Arizona but closely follow sports news from their hometowns. “This now gives our advertising community a chance to leverage the power of sports marketing from a local, national and even global perspective,” he said.\n\nThe ESPN Phoenix 620 show lineup will include Mike & Mike, The Herd with Colin Cowherd and The Dan Le Batard Show, along with signature programs like ESPN Gameday and broadcasts of the Major League Baseball playoffs, the NBA Finals and other significant sporting events.\n\nBoth Arizona Sports 98.7 and ESPN Phoenix 620 will air play-by-play broadcasts of the Arizona Cardinals, the Arizona Diamondbacks, The Phoenix Suns, the Arizona Coyotes and ASU Football and Basketball to maximize audiences and reduce scheduling conflicts."
