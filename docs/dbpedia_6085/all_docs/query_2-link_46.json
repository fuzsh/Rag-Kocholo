        "text": "The Arizona Diamondbacks square off Friday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the National League Division Series. Wave your rally towel and follow the fan experience right here.\n\nFor a play-by-play of the game, visit our game-day blog. Score: D-Backs 5, Dodgers 9, final.\n\nSee you tomorrow\n\nThe Diamondbacks are down a game, but fans are ready to come back. Saturday's game starts at 6 p.m.\n\nA final run\n\nIn the 9th, the D-Backs get a final run on a throwing error.\n\nFinal score: Dodgers 9, Diamondbacks 5.\n\nBreathing room for Dodgers\n\nCorey Seager triples to drive in a run, and Justin Turner singles to drive in another. Turner has five RBIs for the night.\n\nDodgers 9, Diamondbacks 4.\n\nWatch out for snakes\n\nAs one man from Coolidge can tell you, rattlers bite back. (Or it's just a good read if you're tired of the game.)\n\nWatch out, Dodgers. Maybe you should heed Victor Pratt's advice.\n\n\"Ain't gonna play with snakes no more,\" he said.\n\nD-Backs strike back\n\nKetel Marte and Jeff Mathis hit back-to-back home runs in the top of the 7th inning against Clayton Kershaw. His night is done!\n\nDodgers 7, Diamondbacks 4.\n\nNot over yet\n\nJ.D. Martinez slams a home run to left field as, finally, something goes right.\n\nDodgers 7, Diamondbacks 2.\n\nThere's always Game 2\n\nD-Backs fans have been filing out of Alice Cooper'stown, apparently convinced that this isn't a deficit the team can come back from. By the end of the game, there might be nobody here.\n\nEmotions were mixed online.\n\nSome silver linings\n\nAs the Dodgers hits keep coming, azcentral sports columnist Dan Bickley finds some bright spots off the field.\n\nOn the field, another run comes across on a groundout by Yasiel Puig, giving him a second RBI.\n\nDodgers 7, Diamondbacks 1.\n\nThe good news: There are finally two outs.\n\nCelebrity sightings\n\nCelebrities abound at Dodger Stadium.\n\nSo far, we've heard of sightings of Tom Hanks, Rob Lowe, Omar Miller and beloved retired Dodgers sportscaster Vin Scully.\n\nOh, and Will Ferrell made it back to the big screen.\n\nD-Backs have celebrity fans, too\n\nFormer \"Malcolm in the Middle\" star Frankie Muniz cheers on the D-Backs via Twitter.\n\nAnother one\n\nCorey Seager's single in the bottom of the fourth scores Logan Forsythe, who had started the bottom of the fourth inning with a single.\n\nDodgers 5, Diamondbacks 1.\n\nThen Justin Turner gets his fourth RBI of the night with another single. Dodgers 6, Diamondbacks 1.\n\nGreat play\n\nDodger first baseman Cody Bellinger makes a great play fielding a ground ball while going to his right, throwing out the Diamondbacks' Ketel Marte to close out the fourth inning.\n\nNew hope\n\nGot one run back! AJ Pollock's homer in the third inning cuts the Diamondbacks' deficit to 3.\n\nFans at Alice Cooper'stown rose from their seats in applause after that first home run. The Diamondbacks are now on the board, and Pollock seems to have lit a fire in these people.\n\nThe cold shoulder\n\nFans are not happy going into the third inning. Down by four, the D-Backs aren't inspiring confidence from the people watching the game. At least one person watching at this bar said he didn't want to be interviewed about how he thought the Diamondbacks are playing tonight.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about it,\" the man said before turning and taking a long sip of his beer.\n\nLonely view\n\nIn a sea of blue, at least two Arizona Diamondbacks fans were spotted in the first inning. But they weren't looking too happy.\n\nA small victory\n\nIt's not great, but it's the best news for the Diamondbacks all night.\n\nUniform review\n\nCould it be the uniforms? Yasiel Puig doubles in another run, giving the Dodgers a 4-0 lead with nobody out in the first inning.\n\nCover your eyes ... and your ears\n\nDodgers fans got a chance to wave their rally towels early.\n\nJustin Turner hits his third career post-season home run to put the Dodgers up, 3-0.\n\nAfter first inning home run by Turner, the public-address announcer in Dodger Stadium tells the fans to chant, \"Justin, Justin, Justin.\"\n\nThat seems to be a unique feature to that ballpark.\n\nThe Diamondbacks public-address announcer does not tell the crowd to yell Paul or JD or Jake.\n\nTurn the channel\n\nHead is spinning from all the channel changing at the start of the game.\n\nIf you went to grab a drink, they moved the game back to TBS and you're now watching Star Wars on TNT.\n\nWaiting at the bar\n\nA decent crowd of several dozen fans are waiting for the game at Alice Cooper'stown in downtown Phoenix. Everybody seems excited, using the Cubs game as a warmup for the main event.\n\nShould be a good crowd once the game starts.\n\nCute D-Backs fans\n\nThese are some of our favorite fans!\n\nPredictions?\n\nSo the Diamondbacks were 11-8 against the Dodgers this season. Any predictions on how this game will go?\n\nSome experts had a few.\n\nSo far, the safest bet could be that the D-Backs game starts before the Yankees-Indians game ends. That game is 8-8 in the bottom of the 12th! (Update: Indians won in the 13th inning.)\n\nAre you excited?\n\nIt's still a bit before the game, but it looks like fans are getting excited.\n\nGetting ready\n\nBefore the game\n\nNickelodeon star Isabela Moner, known for her role in the show \"100 Things to Do Before High School,\" is set to sing the national anthem ahead of the first pitch for the game.\n\nWe're sure she'll be great, but we're hoping to catch our Jesse McGuire giving a performance again soon when the teams return to Phoenix.\n\nThe first pitch will be thrown by 91-year-old former National League MVP Don Newcombe, who won the inaugural Cy Young Award in 1956.\n\nNewcombe now serves as a special adviser to the Dodgers.\n\nHere's your lineup\n\nThe lineup is set.\n\nDiamondbacks pitcher Taijuan Walker (9-9, 3.49) will face Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw (18-4, 2.31).\n\nCheck out the rest of the lineup here.\n\nNot in L.A.? Catch the game here\n\nAre you ready?\n\nThe first pitch is set for 7:31 p.m. Arizona time at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.\n\nCatch it on TV on TBS. The TV broadcast crew is Brian Anderson, Dennis Eckersley, Joe Simpson and Lauren Shehadi.\n\nFind it on the radio on KMVP-AM (98.7) or KHOV-FM (105.1).\n\nOr online via live streaming: MLB.tv will stream the NLDS and NLCS."
