        "text": "In honor of Brittney Griner’s 32nd birthday this past Tuesday, the Phoenix Suns and Mercury will move forward with her efforts in the community.\n\nThe teams announced that BG’s Heart & Sole Shoe Drive will continue at Footprint Center on Tuesday ahead of the Suns’ matchup with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nFans are welcomed and encouraged to bring new or gently used shoes to the arena to support the drive in Griner’s name. The doors open at 5 p.m. MST for PayPal SixthMan members and 5:30 p.m. for the general public.\n\nThrough the first four years of this mission, approximately 2,000 pairs of shoes were collected. However, this summer saw north of 3,200 pairs of shoes and $27,000 raised for the Phoenix Rescue Mission.\n\nGriner began her shoe drive in 2016 upon seeing people unhoused and without shoes during the summer. As a result, she started driving around Phoenix with shoes in her trunk in case she saw somebody in need.\n\nSince the Mercury drafted her in 2013, Griner has made an effort to support the local community. She joined Phoenix Rescue Mission’s “Hope Coach” and delivered shoes, as well as other resources, directly to people in need.\n\nIn 2017, Griner won the WNBA Cares Community Assist Award for her efforts in assisting those in need, as well as being a leader in the LGBTQ community.\n\nCurrently, she remains in Russia in custody on drug possession charges. She has an appeal hearing set for Tuesday after she was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison."
