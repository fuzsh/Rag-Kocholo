        "text": "Meet Mirko Vacchi, owner of Sky motors . His workshop is located in Brescia in the north of Italy and is fully equipped to service all types of ultralight engines and aircraft. Mirko and his partner Laura also have vast experience with all the paperwork that is needed for aircraft registration.\n\nDuring his recent training at the factory in Belgium, Mirko explains how it all started for him:\n\nJust like the ULPower, he has his roots in the automotive industry. But his father passed on his passion for flying . At first he started with the maintenance of the engines of friends. Later on he was asked to customize the interior / exterior of ultralight aircraft .\n\nBack in 2008 he founded his own company and gradually gained more and more experience. Mirko is now a certified Rotax IRMT and is well known for his reliable service on Jabiru 4 and 6 cylinder engines and even has a mobile workshop to help out customers in the field. Sky motors is also a Zlin Savage authorized workshop. Next to being the Jabiru dealer in Italy, he also represents Alisport, FP-Propeller, Flybox instrumentation and Beringer Rims Brakes\n\nMirko discovered ULPower Aero engines through one of his customers. After having studied the engines and having followed the training class, he is totally convinced that becoming a ULPower Service point is the next logical step ."
