        "text": "Reuters uses 3 letter codes to tag content associated with sports teams (most often in the story Slug). Each team has their own code unique to them within their sport. Codes are never used twice in the same sport, but may re-used across different sports (eg. “MIA” is used for Miami Marlins/Baseball & Miami Heat/Basketball). See below for a listing of codes from key sports & leagues we cover.\n\nFor more on how team codes are used in Reuters Sports content, click here."
