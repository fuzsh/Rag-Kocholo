        "text": "I have British friends in Japan who have used TV-through-the-net (like Slingbox) to transmit the programming over the internet for viewing through an internet connection anywhere they travel to.\n\nThis requires:\n\nHaving someone in the UK to set up the box for you and connect it to the internet\n\nFast enough internet connections on both sides\n\nSome technical aptitude with computers (downloading, installing, and setting up the Slingbox)\n\nQuality depends on the connection, so that is something to look in to prior to taking the leap, and anything like this will require installation fees to set up the SkyTV in the UK, as well as hardware costs for the actual hardware to transmit the programming.\n\nThis may be an alternative option if other things don't work.\n\nDunno how I didn't spot this before but guess I was too focused around the setup they were already using and had tailored my searches around that but the below links seem to solve the problem mostly albeit losing some channels but being official.\n\nhttp://www.sky4me.tv/sky-uk-italy\n\nhttp://www.skyeurope.tv/sky-subscription-italy\n\nBoth sites provide access to SKY UK TV to around 18 countries across europe with identical pricing schemes although it's not clear if they both offer the same channel selection.\n\nHi everyone we live in comano northern Italy. We have a 1.2 metre dish and a invacom quad lnb. We only use 1 feed for sky tv. We get bbc channels from approx 0700 to 1700 hrs. This also depends on weather. The more cloud rain etc we lose signal. Sky news remains on in bad weather. We use a panasonic dsb 31 box.\n\nI am a ex satelite installer from Spain and my advice would be try and go bigger with the dish we will when we have to change it.\n\nHope this info helps.\n\nIf you have a decent Internet connection its easy - Use Sky or UKTV4ITALIA\n\nIf you want a real or normal TV experience watching through your TV, UKTV4ITALIA do a box that you plug into your hdmi port on your TV and also the internet and you can get all the UK free to air channels and lots more, including all the UK radio channels, 14 day catch up and recording.\n\nSky has adverts, similar to Youtube (thats where they make their money, and if you try and watch on a big TV screen its a bit grainy (put fine on an iPad) and there is an annoying Sky Logo always on the screen. Not bad for free though!\n\nUKTV4ITALIA does not have advertising or screen logo and its a normal TV experience but the cost is about Â£10 a month.\n\nYou need about 1.2 Mbps download speed (in the evening) for standard definition and you can check your internet by using speedtest .net"
