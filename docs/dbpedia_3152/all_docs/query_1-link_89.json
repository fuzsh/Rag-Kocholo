The Hualapai Nation’s oral history tells of a different beginning when a big ice comet landed in Colorado. After millions of years, the comet melted and the water rushed through the rocks carving the Grand Canyon. A giant eagle soared the skies before the flooding started, and swooped down to save the Hualapai people, flying the Hualapai on his back and depositing the tribespeople along the ledge of the west rim when the flooding stopped. The eagle itself turned into stone, where it remains to this day.\n\nYou can see the grand eagle at the aptly named Eagle Point when you visit Grand Canyon West.\n\nCAN CHILDREN WALK ON THE SKYWALK?\n\nIf children are old enough to walk on their own, they are permitted to walk on the Skywalk.
