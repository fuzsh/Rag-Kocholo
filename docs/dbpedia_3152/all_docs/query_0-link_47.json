But above all, that typical warm welcome that every passenger can experience. That’s why, with ITA Airways, Italy starts even before touching the ground.\n\nWe present ITA Airways not as an airline company but as the sum of the Italian excellences in flight.\n\nStarting from the iconic shape of a search bar, we turned it into the physical expression of the Italian excellences that people search for when dreaming of a trip to Italy and, in the end, into the airplane window, to reveal that everything can be found up in the sky."
