The broadcaster will show at least one league match per day, as well as highlights and analysis shows, including 48 weekend primetime matches.\n\nMichael Jordan sells Charlotte Hornets minority stake\n\nThe pay-TV broadcaster also has the exclusive Italian rights to the whole range of NBA properties, including the annual NBA All-Star game, the play-offs, conference and overall finals matches.\n\nThe deal also sees Sky retain the NBA’s Italian website, where it will host video highlights along with news, stats, scores, in-depth analysis and content produced specifically for that platform.
