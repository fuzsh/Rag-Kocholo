        "text": "Heading off on holiday soon? As well as packing your suitcase, you’ll also need to get a few other travel essentials sorted. This includes checking whether you can use your UK debit card abroad without charges, and whether your mobile network allows international roaming.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll be focusing on Sky Mobile and how its international data roaming policy works. We’ll run through where in the world you can use your Sky Mobile device to get online, along with any data roaming charges you need to know about.\n\nAnd while you’re making your pre-travel preparations, make sure you check out the Wise card from the money services provider Wise. It could save you money on holiday spending, letting you pay and withdraw cash like a local in 150+ countries - and all for low fees* and great mid-market exchange rates.\n\nTable of contents\n\nWhat is Sky Mobile?\n\nWhat services does Sky Mobile provide?\n\nHow does roaming with Sky Mobile work?\n\nSky Mobile international data roaming coverage\n\nSky Mobile data roaming in Europe (EU)\n\nSky Mobile data roaming in the US³\n\nSky Mobile data roaming in Turkey\n\nSky Mobile international data roaming charges\n\nAdditional fees\n\nWhat is Sky Mobile?\n\nSky Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). This is just a rather long-winded way of saying that it doesn’t have its own network, but uses another provider’s network. In this case, Sky Mobile uses the O2 network.\n\nWhat services does Sky Mobile provide?\n\nSky Mobile offers a range of pay monthly plans and contracts for phones, tablets and laptops. You can also get SIM cards and buy accessories such as headphones and smartwatches at the Sky Mobile website.\n\nHow does roaming with Sky Mobile work?\n\nSky Mobile does allow roaming, which means that you’ll be able to use your phone to get online and make calls when you’re outside the UK.\n\nHowever, it isn’t free. International minutes, texts and data aren’t considered to be included in your monthly plan, so you’ll be charged for them. We’ll look at roaming charges in more detail shortly.\n\nBefore you travel, you’ll need to make sure you have data roaming switched on in your phone settings.¹ But you don’t need to tell Sky Mobile that you’ll be using your phone internationally.\n\nWhen you land at your destination, you should receive a welcome text from the provider which outlines the roaming charges for using your phone in that country.\n\nYou can set a spend cap to limit any roaming charges, but you need to make sure it’s above £0 if you want roaming to work.\n\nSky Mobile international data roaming coverage\n\nSky Mobile customers should be able to use their devices worldwide, although there may be a handful of exceptions. You can check the full list of roaming destinations here.\n\nThere are some specifics you need to know about certain destinations though. We’ll run through these next.\n\nSky Mobile data roaming in Europe (EU)\n\nIf you’re jetting off to Europe, you can use the Roaming Passport Plus Pass for £2 a day. This lets you use your UK data, call and text allowances while spending time in over 55 countries. This includes almost all of the EU/EEA, as well as the USA, Australia and a handful of other destinations.²\n\nYou don’t need to buy or order the pass. As soon as you use your phone in an included destination, the pass activates automatically.\n\n📚 Read more: 7 best UK-issued prepaid travel cards for Europe\n\nSky Mobile data roaming in the US³\n\nFor those travelling to the USA, there’s an extra complication to bear in mind. Before you go, you’ll need to make sure your phone is compatible with something called VoLTE Roaming or 4G Calling Abroad - and switch it on in your device settings.\n\nThis is because US mobile network providers are currently switching over from 2G and 3G to make way for 4G and 5G networks.\n\nThe following (but not all) phones should be compatible:\n\niPhone 7 and above running iOS15 or higher.\n\nSamsung S10 and above, and Samsung A series, running Android 12 or higher.\n\nIf your device fits the bill, you can use the Sky Mobile Roaming Passport Plus Pass to use your UK data, call and text allowances while in the US. If not, you might need to look into getting a US SIM card instead.\n\n📚 Read more: 7 best UK-issued prepaid travel cards for the US\n\nSky Mobile data roaming in Turkey\n\nThe only thing to know about data roaming in Turkey is that the Sky Mobile Roaming Passport Plus Pass does work there.¹ So all you need to do is switch on data roaming and start using your phone when you land - and it’ll be activated automatically.\n\n📚 Read more: 7 best UK-issued prepaid travel cards for Turkey\n\nSky Mobile international data roaming charges\n\nThe Sky Mobile Roaming Passport Plus Pass costs a flat £2 a day, and allows you to use your UK allowance of calls, text and data in 55+ included countries. Be aware though that some additional charges may apply to certain calls or messages.\n\nIf you want to roam somewhere outside of the 55 countries, international data roaming charges will apply. These vary depending on the destination, and there’s a full list on the Sky Mobile Tariff Guide.\n\nBut to give you an idea, here are a few examples:⁴\n\nMalaysia - £0.36 per MB\n\nAlbania - £2.16 per MB\n\nTunisia - £4.32 per MB\n\nMozambique - £12 per MB.\n\nAdditional fees\n\nLike other providers, Sky Mobile also has additional charges for certain types of international calls or messages. It all depends on where you’re travelling to, but here are a few examples:⁴\n\nDestinationCall/messageFee One of the 55+ Roaming Passport Plus Pass countriesCall to an EU/EEA destination£0.55 per minute One of the 55+ Roaming Passport Plus Pass countriesText to an EU/EEA destination£0.10 per text One of the 55+ Roaming Passport Plus Pass countriesMMS£0.40 to EU\n\n£0.58 to non-EU\n\nRest of the worldCalls to the UK (landline or mobile)£0.72 to £4.68 a minute Rest of the worldReceiving calls£0.14 to £2.10 a minute\n\nAnd that’s it - your handy guide to Sky Mobile international data roaming. We’ve looked at where you can roam and how much it costs, along with any other destination-specific information you need to know.\n\nAfter reading this, you should be all set to start planning your trip. Don’t forget to pop your Wise card in your travel wallet, as it could save you a bundle when spending abroad.\n\nSign up with Wise today 💰\n\nSources used for this article:\n\nSky Mobile - Roaming Passport Plus\n\nSky Mobile - Using Sky Mobile abroad (roaming)\n\nSky Mobile - Roaming in the USA\n\nSky Mobile - Sky Mobile Tariff Guide"
