It means matches from the UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League will only be available to viewers of Sky Sport on the Sky satellite platform or NOW streaming service.\n\nFollowing changes to the competitions there will be 527 matches for each of the next three seasons of the UEFA Champions League (185 matches, including the playoffs), UEFA Europa League (189 matches) and UEFA Europa Conference League (153 matches). This will include the three finals, in addition to the UEFA Europe Super Cup and the UEFA Super Cup, whose new format is still being defined.\n\nSky will continue to share rights to the Champions League in Italy with Amazon Prime Video, which will screen 18 Wednesday night games."
