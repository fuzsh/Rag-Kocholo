The blue bar displays the response time, which is better when smaller. If no bar is displayed for a specific time it means that the service was down and the site was offline.\n\nService Status History\n\nDateTimePing TimeDateTimePing Time 05.Aug.2024 07:3811.77 ms. 05.Aug.2024 12:1015.38 ms. 05.Aug.2024 14:4112.75 ms. 07.Aug.2024 03:3313.82 ms. 07.Aug.2024 20:1112.59 ms. 08.Aug.2024 15:0331.23 ms. 08.Aug.2024 17:4812.36 ms. 09.Aug.2024 05:1514.5 ms. 11.Aug.2024 17:0112.8 ms. 12.Aug.2024 07:3519.69 ms.\n\n* Times displayed are PT, Pacific Time (UTC/GMT 0) | Current server time is 00:56\n\nWe have tried pinging Sky Italia website using our server and the website returned the above results. If www.sky.it is down for us too there is nothing you can do except waiting. Probably the server is overloaded, down or unreachable because of a network problem, outage or a website maintenance is in progress...\n\nCan't Access Sky Italia - Troubleshooting Instructions\n\nIf the site is UP but you cant access the page, try one of the below solutions:\n\nBrowser Related Problems\n\nForce a full refresh for the site. This can be achieved by pressing CTRL + F5 keys at the same time on your favourite browser (Firefox, Chrome, Explorer, etc.)\n\nClear the temporary cache and cookies on your browser to make sure that you have the most recent version of the web page. For instructions choose your browser :\n\nFix DNS Problems\n\nA Domain Name System (DNS) allows a site IP address (192.168.x.x) to be identified with words (*.com) in order to be remembered more easily, like a phonebook for websites. This service is usually provided by your ISP.\n\nClear your local DNS cache to make sure that you grab the most recent cache that your ISP has. For Windows - (Start > Command Prompt > type \"ipconfig /flushdns\" and hit enter). For details choose your operating system :\n\nIf you can access a website at office or from a 3G network yet it's not working on your computer, it is a good idea to use an alternative DNS service other than your ISPs. OpenDNS or Google Public DNS are both excellent and free public DNS services.\n\nCheck our help page for step-by-step instructions on how to change your DNS."
