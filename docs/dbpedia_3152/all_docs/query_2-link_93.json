Early in 1964 Rupert Murdoch's News Limited made his first overseas newspaper investment - a 29.57 percent stake in the Wellington Publishing Company. The News Limited holding in INL has fluctuated over the years and is now just over 49 percent.\n\nOriginally posted by Mark Ramsden\n\nI think you'll find it is by the back door. Sky TV (NZ) is 65% owned by Independant Newspapers Limited (INL) in fact as of 1 July it seems to be about all they own and as the following statement from their website states\n\nDear old Rupert has a substantial intrest in them"
