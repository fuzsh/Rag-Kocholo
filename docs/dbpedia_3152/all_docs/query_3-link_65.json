The NordLynx protocol helps to improve performance while streaming, and there are 50+ Italian servers to choose from.\n\nIt’s a capable provider for accessing blocked services, including US Netflix, restricted YouTube videos, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime, and more. The same goes for Sky Go, as it works with versions in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, and New Zealand. That’s reasonably comprehensive. However, we saw better results with the Windows app during testing.\n\nYou’ll find apps for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS devices, alongside browser extensions which are available for Chrome and Firefox. It allows for six simultaneous connections.\n\nAdditional features include double-hop connections, VPN over Tor, DNS-based malware protection, Dedicated IPs, and Smart DNS.

There are servers in 60+ countries, unblocking an impressive number of international streaming services, including Netflix US, Hulu, and Prime Video.\n\nThere are apps for all popular devices, and it comes with features like a kill switch and obfuscation. You’ll be further protected by strong encryption and a zero-logs policy.\n\nAs well as a seven-day free trial, you’ll be able to test it out for longer thanks to its 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nAccessing Sky Go Italia with a Free VPN\n\nThere are numerous free VPNs, but we’d strongly advise against using a provider which doesn’t charge for its service via subscription. It’ll be tough to find a VPN that has the servers needed to access Sky Go Italia in the first place, as the majority of free options are limited to the United States.\n\nIf you do manage to find a free provider with Italian servers, these are likely to be blocked by most streaming platforms. Sky Go Italia is one of the more difficult platforms to access from abroad, so it’s unlikely to work anyway.\n\nThe majority of free VPNs struggle with slow connection speeds due to overloaded servers, so you’ll have to put up with lag or constant buffering. You’re also going to have to deal with a constant barrage of adverts, and some services have even been caught selling user data and bandwidth in the past.\n\nMany free providers are risky in terms of privacy and security and lack solid encryption, which means it will be leaking your data in the background.\n\nWhy does Sky Go Italia block its users?\n\nSky Go Italia can actually be used in many European countries, as long as you meet the following criteria: You must pay for the Sky subscription, and you must be a permanent resident in Italy. If so;\n\n\"When you travel to one of the countries in the European Union, you can see the same programs available in Italy on your devices without downloading them.”\n\nYou’ll be able to use the Sky Go app in Italy, the Republic of San Marino, the Vatican City, all European Union countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. However, this no longer includes the UK.\n\nEU countries are as follows:\n\nAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta , the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Hungary.\n\nHowever, this only works for 30 days. You will then receive an email to remind you that, within the following week, you need to log in again from Italy to confirm your residence.\n\nDue to complicated international broadcasting rights, streaming services tend to stick to a country or region. (In this case, Italy and the EU.) If you’re on holiday in the UK, or anywhere else outside of the EU, you will probably see the following error message:\n\n\"Per vedere este contenuto è necessario trovarsi su Territorio della Repubblica Italiana di San Marino o della Città del Vaticano.”\n\nAn Italian IP will trick the service, and gives the user access to Sky Go Italia streams.\n\nHow does a VPN access Sky Go Italia?\n\nAs the service is restricted to Italian users with a few exceptions, you’ll have to use an IP address from Italy to trick Sky Go into thinking that you’re currently in the country. Most websites tend to use your IP address to determine your current location.\n\nA VPN ‘spoofs’ your IP, which is another term for masking (or hiding) your real IP address with a substitute. Your IP is unique, but you can use a VPN to get an address from any location you connect to.\n\nSky is one of the more stringent platforms when it comes to blocking the use of VPNs. This is conjecture, but it could be due to the various live sports available on the platform, with broadcasting rights that are split across Europe and beyond. You’ll need a premium service to have any chance of being able to access Sky Go, and the average VPN is unlikely to make the cut.\n\nHow to access Sky Go Italia: Further information\n\nAvailable free of charge to all Sky customers, Sky Go Italia has apps for iOS, Android, macOS, and PC.\n\nAccording to the Sky help pages, you’ll only be able to watch Sky Go programs on one device at a time, although you can replace devices whenever you want without any limitations.\n\nPremium users can associate their Sky iD with up to eight devices and use the services on two paired devices at the same time.\n\nWatching Sky GO Italia from anywhere: FAQs\n\nIs it legal to watch Sky Go Italia with a VPN?\n\nYes, it’s legal, and you won’t get in trouble if you plan to watch content with a VPN. However, it is worth noting that you could be in breach of Sky’s Terms of Service. The broadcaster is unlikely to cancel your subscription at any rate.\n\nIt’s not illegal to change your IP address in Italy, but rules will vary depending on your current location. For example, VPNs are restricted in some countries, such as China, Russia, and parts of the Middle East. Make sure to check the legality before heading out.\n\nWill my Sky Go Italia account be banned if I use a VPN?\n\nIt’s unlikely that you’ll be banned for accessing a service that you’ve paid for, especially if you’re only using it while you’re on holiday. However, you will be restricted from watching content if they find out you’re not in Italy. Streaming services ban the IPs used by VPNs, rather than the users themselves.\n\nWhat devices can I use for Sky Go Italia?\n\nSky Go Italia can be used with a variety of different devices. The Sky Go platform is available for tablets and smartphones with iOS 12 or higher and Android 5.1 or higher, for PC/Mac with Windows 7 or higher and Mac OS X 10.11 or higher. It also works with Smart TVs, games consoles, some streaming sticks, and boxes.\n\nI’m having issues with my VPN and Sky Go Italia. Any solutions?\n\nIf you’ve followed the guide and you’re still running into problems, there are a number of potential solutions. Make sure to clear all the cookies from your device. Desktop versions tend to have more success with streaming services. You can also try switching to a different server in Italy. If all else fails, we’d advise to contact the VPN support team to see if they can help.\n\nWhat can I watch with Sky Go Italia?\n\nYou’ll be able to watch various live Sky Italia channels, including sports, football, news and more. For example, here are the sports offerings:\n\nSky Sport 24\n\nSky Sport Uno\n\nSky Sport Calcio\n\nSky Sport Football\n\nSky Sport Arena\n\nSky Sport Tennis\n\nSky Sport Action\n\nSky Sport NBA\n\nSky Sport F1\n\nSky Sport MotoGP\n\nThere are also thousands of on-demand cinema titles, TV series, documentaries, and children's programs. However, it will vary depending on your Sky subscription, and you won’t get access to anything you haven’t paid for.\n\nYou can watch Peacock content with the platform, but Sky Primafila content is not available on Sky Go.\n\nCan I watch Sky Go Italia for free?\n\nYes, and no. Sky Go is free for any Sky subscriber, but you will have to be a paying customer."
