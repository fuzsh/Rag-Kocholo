        "text": "The heavyweight Sky Italia pay-TV broadcaster has unveiled an extension to its exclusive rights deal covering English soccer’s top-tier Premier League (EPL) for another three seasons.\n\nThe renewal, confirmed late last week, will see Sky Italia continue to exclusively cover the 20-team EPL until the end of the 2027-28 campaign.\n\nThe current deal between the broadcaster and the league (also for three years) runs through 2024-25.\n\nThere will be coverage of (up to) all 10 matches per round, live on both Sky’s linear channels and via the Now streaming service, as well as pre and post-match analysis, and the Premier League Remix highlights show.\n\nFeature-style programming, such as the Premier League Stories segment, will also be aired.\n\nThe current tie-up between Sky Italia and the EPL is worth, GlobalData (Sportcal) has estimated, $35 million per year, and was unveiled in May 2022.\n\nBefore that, Sky Italia also covered EPL action during the 2019-22 cycle.\n\nThat agreement, however, only included a maximum of seven live EPL games being shown every week, meaning this new extension also represents an expansion of the tie-up.\n\nMarzio Perrelli, executive vice president of sport at Sky Italia, has said: “We are happy to announce this agreement with the Premier League, which will remain a fundamental pillar of Sky Sport's offering in the coming seasons.”\n\nProminent Italian players currently competing in the EPL include Arsenal’s Jorginho, Tottenham Hotspur’s Destiny Udogie, and Aston Villa’s Nicolò Zaniolo.\n\nThe broadcaster’s German counterpart, Sky Deutschland, has already announced a similar extension through 2027-28 (exclusive in Germany and Austria, and non-exclusive in Switzerland), with that deal made public in early February.\n\nSky’s UK branch is the main domestic broadcaster for the league (alongside TNT Sports), in a deal struck late last year and worth £6.7 billion ($8.45 billion) for the 2025-26 to 2028-29 cycle.\n\nSky Italia, meanwhile, is also a domestic rights partner of Italy’s Serie A through 2028-29. That deal gives the network live coverage rights to co-broadcast three games per week, with DAZN holding rights to all matches."
