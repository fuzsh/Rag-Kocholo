        "text": "Sky Italy has a new CEO: It is Andrea Duilio, who will assume the position starting from 6 September. The company announced it in a note, specifying that the manager will report directly to Stephen van Rooyen, CEO of Sky UK & Europe. The company makes it known.\n\nDuilio – who is 47 years old and has a degree in Economics from the Bocconi University of Milan – has experience twenty years in Vodafone Italy, where he worked – with ever increasing responsibilities – in the consumer business units. Since 2018 she has led with the role of digital director the digital transformation path of the telecommunication company. He later took on the position of director of business operations. Simultaneously, Vodafone Italia announced who Andrea Duilio's successor is Gianluca Pasquali who from 1 September assumes the role of Consumer Business Unit director of Vodafone Italia, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer Aldo Bisio. Pasquali is currently Group Retail & Customer Operations Director, where he has accelerated digital as a sales channel, the transformation and digitization of both the retail channel and customer service for the entire Vodafone Group, designed the new strategy for customer operations and for the My Vodafone app and launched the single platform approach for both TOBi and the App with the aim of leveraging the global dimension of the Group. In his role, he also introduced smart working in the customer operations of the entire Vodafone Group.\n\n“I am delighted to welcome Andrea Duilio as the new CEO of Sky Italia – comments Stephen van Rooyen – and to be able to work together with him on the implementation of our ambitious development plans. The experience gained by Duilio will give an important boost to Sky Italia's innovation and growth process, completing the transition towards a leaner and more integrated operating model with the group”.\n\nDuilio will have to take the reins of Sky Italia in a very special moment for the company, which for the first time in almost 20 years is no longer the main television platform where you can watch Serie A matches."
