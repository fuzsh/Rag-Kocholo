        "text": "Synopsis\n\nA $9 bn transaction cobbles a pay-TV empire stretching from Manchester to Munich to Milan, with a non-Murdoch at the helm.\n\nJeremy Darroch, 52, will oversee a $9 billion transaction uniting British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc with Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland AG. BSkyB will buy the shares from another Murdoch company, 21st Century Fox Inc. The purchase will create a media powerhouse that beams TV programs via cable and satellite to 20 million subscribers in five European countries.\n\nFriday’s purchase is the culmination of years of deals to build the company, which doesn’t yet have an official name but that many in the industry are calling Sky Europe. In 2003, the Murdochs assembled satellite assets to build Sky Italia. Then beginning in 2008 the family made a series of investments that became Sky Deutschland.\n\n\"There’s so much public evidence of the long ambition to unite the Skys,\" said Claudio Aspesi, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London. \"James right now is looking brilliant, because he can point to success in creating value. He’s bringing all the cash out of Europe and monetizing investments some people had been skeptical about.\"\n\nThe big question is whether the Murdochs can achieve a long-standing goal of taking full ownership of BSkyB. In 2010, the family made a 7.8 billionpound ($13.2 billion) bid for the 61 per cent of the company it doesn’t own. That plan, though, fell apart after the phone-hacking scandal.\n\nIn 2011, The Guardian reported that Murdoch’s UK Sunday tabloid News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of a murdered school girl. The ensuing furor forced Murdoch to shutter the News of the World and put the BSkyB plan on hold, while James Murdoch decamped for New York. He now serves as co- chief operating officer at Fox, the film and broadcast unit of Murdoch’s former News Corp., which split last year.\n\nThe senior Murdoch \"knows he’s going to be unable to buy BSkyB in the foreseeable future after the difficulties last time around,\" said Roddy Davidson, an analyst at Westhouse Securities in London. Today’s transaction \"doesn’t preclude him from trying to acquire BSkyB and the European assets once they’ve been brought together.\"\n\nBy selling Sky Italia and its 57 per cent stake in Sky Deutschland, Fox gets cash that it could use to increase the $80 billion offer Murdoch made for Time Warner Inc. in June. Though Time Warner rejected that bid, Fox is willing to raise its bid above the current $85 per share, a person familiar with the matter has said. Analysts have speculated that the Murdochs could also sell their 39 per cent stake in the expanded BSkyB to raise even more cash for Time Warner.\n\nFox declined to comment on whether it might sell its BSkyB shares. In a statement, Fox said it plans to disclose details of a new share-buyback authorization next month.\n\n\"The deal is great for Mr. Murdoch since now he can keep on pursuing the Time Warner deal and fulfill his old dream of becoming the single entrepreneur in the global media industry with the largest content breadth and depth,\" said Carlo Alberto Carnevale Maffe, a business professor at Bocconi University in Milan.\n\nUniting Sky Europe was always part of the Murdochs’ plan for BSkyB, said Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis in London. The younger Murdoch hired Darroch from UK electronics retailer Dixon’s to work as BSkyB’s finance chief in 2004. James had just taken over BSkyB, and at the age of 30 was the youngest person to head a top-100 British company. In 2007, Murdoch promoted Darroch to chief executive officer of BSkyB.\n\n\"The goal was to take over the balance of BSkyB and roll it into a vehicle that would contain Italia and the Deutschland stake,\" Enders said. \"This was how James was going to keep Darroch interested in the job -- with more territories, responsibilities and complexities.\"\n\nThe Sky Europe deal promotes Darroch to the top of a pan- European pay-TV empire, rivaling John Malone’s European cable powerhouse Liberty Global Plc. Just as important, it defuses a growing threat from BT Group Plc. The phone carrier has stepped up competition by offering free sports channels to broadband subscribers and winning the rights to major sporting events in recent years -- a strategy similar to the one Rupert Murdoch pursued when he founded BSkyB in 1990.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nIndiGo’s ‘stretch’ from no-frills to business class has a DNA test coming\n\nWhy Nvidia’s stock fall reminds us of Amazon during the dotcom mania\n\nSix reasons why Iran is becoming the epicenter of global conflict.
