        "text": "When Sky Italia needed a unique through-the-line campaign to promote Sky Q and WiFi together, we put family at the centre of the story.\n\nWhy? Well, our primary objective was to communicate that Sky WiFi can meet the needs of every home. Even the busiest. While Sky Q has something to keep everyone happy. And itâ€™s all in one place. Easy.\n\nWe needed a warm and memorable campaign to spread the word and capture the hearts of Italian families. And we knew it would take a very special star to do that. A character that anyone could relate to.\n\nAnd it turned out that was a loveable little dog. So there we have it. A family. A sofa. And one adorable pup. Watch the story unfold here."
