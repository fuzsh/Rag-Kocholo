        "text": "The Giro d’Italia starts on Friday and will run until the end of May.\n\nBut what exactly is the Giro and why does it matter?\n\nHere, we explain everything you need to know…\n\nWhat does Giro d'Italia mean?\n\nIt basically means Tour of Italy, in Italian.\n\nIs it a big deal?\n\nYes, it's a very prestigious race and one of cycling's three grand tours, the others being the Tour de France and the Vuelta a Espana.\n\nHow long does it last?\n\nIt is made up of 21 stages and takes place over roughly three weeks. It starts on Friday, May 6, and ends on Sunday, May 29.\n\nIs there a yellow jersey, like in the Tour de France?\n\nYes, there is, but it's not yellow; it's pink. It is worn by the leader of the race and is the main prize for the eventual winner. The pink jersey is known in Italy as the maglia rosa.\n\nWhere does the race go?\n\nThe Giro often starts outside of Italy and this year the first three stages will be in the Netherlands.\n\nThe rest of the race is in Italy - starting in the south and gradually heading north to the finish in Turin - except for stages 19 and 20, large parts of which are in France.\n\nWho won it last year and who is expected to win this year?\n\nLast year's race was won by Alberto Contador, but he isn't back to defend his title, so Vincenzo Nibali is the bookmakers' favourite. Nibali, who is Italian, won the race in 2014.\n\nAre Chris Froome, Sir Bradley Wiggins or Mark Cavendish racing?\n\nNo. Froome is saving himself for the Tour de France in July, Wiggins rides for a team who do not qualify to race at the Giro, and Cavendish has opted not to take part.\n\nIn fact, there is not a single Briton racing at this year's Giro.\n\nWhich other riders should I look out for?\n\nThe best sprinter in the world, Germany's Marcel Kittel, is taking part, as is Spain's Mikel Landa, who is one of the best climbers. Another Spaniard, Alejandro Valverde, should be challenging for overall victory, while Swiss legend Fabian Cancellara is also on the start line.\n\nHow many teams and riders take part?\n\nSome 189 riders from 22 teams of nine start the race. The teams are the 18 teams belonging to cycling's top division, the UCI WorldTour, plus four invited teams from the second division.\n\nHow long are the stages and when do they take place?\n\nThe stages vary in length from 130km to more than 240km. However, there are also three time trials this year that are much shorter, at 9.8km, 10.8km and 40.5km.\n\nBecause of the different distances, the stages start at varying times, roughly from 10am to 12.45pm BST. All of the stages are scheduled to finish at about 4.15pm BST.\n\nShould I be excited about the Giro?\n\nYes, definitely. It is often a lot more exciting than the Tour de France and the racing is almost always close. It also takes place against some beautiful backdrops, such as the Alps."
