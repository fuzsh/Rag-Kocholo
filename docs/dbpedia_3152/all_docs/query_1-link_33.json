        "text": "How cultures across the World have seen their myths and legends in the stars\n\nNo matter where you are on Earth, we all look up to the same sky during the dark nights. You might see a different section of it depending on your exact location, time & season, nevertheless the stars have fascinated humans across time and continents.\n\nOur own creativity combined with stories about local legends and myths have created a diverse set of different constellations. And even though the stars don't change, people have found many different shapes in the same sky. From humans, to animals, to objects, and even abstract concepts.\n\nThe same sky, different figures\n\nLet's compare 28 different \"sky cultures\" to see differences and similarities in the shapes they've seen in the night sky. Ranging from the so-called \"Modern\" or Western constellations, to Chinese, Maori and even a few shapes from historical cultures such as the Aztecs.\n\nTake the star Betelgeuse. This red supergiant is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. In proper darkness, you can even see that it shines in a distinctly red color. It's part of one of the easiest to distinguish modern constellations known as Orion, named after a gigantic, supernaturally strong hunter from Greek mythology.\n\nThe visualization below shows how Betelgeuse has been used by 17 cultures (out of the 28) to form constellations, each represented by a different color. The main shape of a long rectangle that is \"tightened by a belt\" in the center is clearly visible, with many lines of different constellations appearing side by side. These bright stars thus seem to form a distinctive figure. However, there are some fascinating alternates in there too; mostly humanoid shapes by the Egyptians, Navajo and Tupi.\n\nThe separate constellation shapes of each culture can be found in a ring around the main circle. Click on any of the smaller circles to make it appear in the center. To get back to the default view showing all constellations simultaneously, click on the central star map.\n\nSirius, said to literally mean \"scorching\", is quite an appropriate name\n\nHowever, if we instead focus on Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, no clear shape is shared across cultures. In Western culture it belongs to Canis Major, i.e. the Large Dog, and a dog shape can indeed be recognized. But other cultures have seen Sirius as part of an Eagle, Wolf and several more animals.\n\nClick on the sky map of Sirius below if you want to see it visualized in a bigger sky map with all of the separate constellations around it.\n\nThe Big Dipper is actually part of a larger Western constellation known as Ursa Major, or Big Bear\n\nPerhaps the most universally recognized figure across all cultures is the first one that many people learn as a kid; the Big Dipper. Roughly 17 out of the 20 constellations that use Dubhe, the top right star, share practically the same \"cooking pan\" shape. And even though the shapes are almost the same, the actual figures that were seen differ quite a lot. From an Elk, a Caribou, to Carts, and even a \"Group of organized thieves\" by the Macedonians.\n\nClick on the sky map of Dubhe below if you want to see it visualized in a bigger sky map with all of the separate constellations around it.\n\nBelow are several more famous or bright stars & constellations. For some of them, roughly the same shapes have been seen by cultures across the World, such as the half circle of the Corona Borealis constellation around Alphekka. Whereas others show quite the \"chaos\" of lines, see Mirphak for example.\n\nAs with the previous two maps, you can click on each of the stars below to see it visualized in a bigger sky map that pops up.\n\nBrightness doesn't determine all\n\nLet's look at all 2168 unique stars that are included in at least one constellation across all sky cultures. The chart below shows the stars according to their brightness from left to right, and the number of constellations the star appears in from top to bottom. A general trend is visible: The brighter the star, the more constellations it's included in. This makes sense, since brighter stars just stand out more.\n\nAnother thing that most likely plays a role is \"good placement\" around the ecliptic so it's visible in many regions of the Earth\n\nHowever, some stars stand out because they \"rise\" from the general mass; they are included in constellations more often than you'd expect based on their brightness. The main reason appears to be that they are often part of an easy to recognize \"shape\" of stars, such as Orion's belt, the Pleiades, and the Corona Borealis and Taurus constellations.\n\nAnd vice versa, several other stars are used less often than expected for their brightness. In these cases the star is often a bit of a loner. There is no group of close-by stars to form an easy to recognize shape with, such as Sirius and Canopus all the way on the right.\n\nNOTE | Star colors, based on their actual visible colors, have been exaggerated/saturated for better visibility. The sizes of the stars are (not-linearly) scaled to the actual brightness of the stars (called absolute magnitude); how bright they would be if they were all placed the same distance from Earth. Because stars are all at widely different distances from the Earth, how bright a star appears to us is called the apparent magnitude.\n\nSirius is about 25 times more luminous than the Sun, but Canopus is ~10,000 times more luminous!\n\nTake Sirius, the brightest star, it appears almost twice as bright to us as Canopus, the next brightest star. However, compared to the other stars we see at night it's actually not exceptionally bright. The reason it appears so bright to us, is because it's one of our closest neighboring stars (at 8.6 light-years).\n\nThe full sky, different for each culture\n\nTry moving the sky horizontally...\n\nTo get a sense of the different cultures, we can also look at all (still known) constellations of each. The Sky Map below shows almost the entire sky, only excluding a thin strip around both the poles. Right now it's revealing the Hawaiian (Starlines) constellations, but you can see a different set of shapes by selecting any of the other cultures below the Sky Map.\n\nConstellations in the night sky as seen by Hawaiian (Starlines) culture\n\nNumber of Constellations — 13\n\nAverage number of ✩ per constellation — 7\n\nSky Cultures\n\nThe constellation information for the cultures come from Stellarium, a free and extremely popular planetarium.\n\nThere are 28 cultures included in these analyses and visuals. Especially for the more ancient cultures, only a few constellations are still known today. You can read a little more about each culture by hovering over the blocks. It's also possible to see all the constellations of the culture at once in the Sky Map above by clicking on a culture's name.\n\nArabic\n\nConstellations — 49\n\nAvg. ✩ per constellation — 11\n\nThe shapes of these constellations were greatly influenced by Greek astronomy.

It has historical roots in Ancient Greek astronomy, with influences from Islamic astronomy (most of the traditional Western star names came from Arabic).\n\nThe endless sky, binding us together\n\nThe earliest written evidence for the existence of constellations comes from inscribed stones and clay writing tablets dating back to 3000 BC\n\nIt is innately human to see and use the figures in the night sky. To dream, to tell stories, to navigate, and more. Some groups of relatively bright stars are so distinct that cultures from around the world, separated by vast oceans, have connected them into a constellation in almost the same way. It's our human imagination and cultural history that ascribes wildly different figures and meaning to the shapes though. From kings, to legendary & important animals to mythical gods and beings.\n\nSo the next time you're outside during a dark but nice warm summer night, lie down in a patch of fluffy grass, look up and imagine your own shapes & figures from the pinpricks of twinkling lights above. You'll probably end up recognizing more shapes than you would've thought.\n\nIf you enjoyed this project, please pass it on to others by sharing it on Twitter • LinkedIn • Facebook or elsewhere\n\nCreated with ❤ by astronomer & dataviz lover Nadieh Bremer\n\nSee more of her personal & professional works on Visual Cinnamon\n\nThe data about the stars comes from the HYG star database.
