        "text": "The weather has the power to impact a person’s state of mind. While a warm, sunny day would prompt you to go outside and get some fresh air, a hazy and wintry day would make you want to snuggle up in bed sipping on your coffee. Weather-inspired names such as baby names that mean sky or rain can be a great choice for your baby to celebrate the shades of nature. Here we have combined a list of names that are a perfect pick for your little one.\n\nWeather Inspired Baby Names For Girls\n\n1. Alizeh\n\nAlizeh is a beautiful Persian name, meaning ‘wind.’ It is an attractive variation of the names- Eliza, Alissa, and even the French form Alizee. Geena Davis chose this Persian name for her daughter. Alizeh Imtiaz, Pakistani film director is a famous namesake.\n\n2. Anemone\n\nAnemone is a name derived from the Greek word anemos and means ‘wind’. In the Greek mythology, Anemone was the nymph who turned into a wildflower. It would make an interesting, and even challenging pick for parents who want an exotic weather inspired the name.\n\n3. Aureole\n\nThis English name is derived from the word aureole, which is a diminutive form of the Latin name aura, which means ‘breeze or the wind’. Hence, Aureole means ‘little wind.’ We think Aureole would make a lovely substitute for the commonplace Ariel.\n\n4. Amaya\n\nThis Spanish version of the name Amaia has been growing in popularity in the United States because of its similarity with Maya. Mariska Hargitay named her baby daughter Amaya Josephine. And, it’s associated with a Philippine television show as well.\n\n5. Wendy\n\nWendy can also be considered as a variation of the wind for baby girls. Originally, this name was invented by Sir James Barrie in Peter Pan. This moniker’s heyday was in the 50s and 60s, but it still sounds cool today.\n\n6. Audra\n\nAudra is a Lithuanian name, meaning ‘storm.’ This name is used widely in Scotland as a variation of Audrey. Famous Broadway actress, Audra Ann McDonald, is a famous bearer of this name.\n\n7. Breeze\n\nBreeze is a lovely word name referring to the soft and smooth wind. Most people use Breeze as a middle name, but we think it would make a great first name as well. Even Levi Johnston used Breeze as a first name for his daughter.\n\n8. Noelani\n\nNoelani is a gorgeous Hawaiian name, meaning ‘heavenly mist.’ This exotic name would make a nice pick for girls born during Christmas for its ‘Noel’ beginning. Its modern namesake would be Noelani Pantastico, the American ballerina.\n\n9. Indra\n\nIndra is a Sanskrit name, meaning ‘possessing drops of rain.’ In Hindu religion, Indra is the warrior god of rain and sky and is used for boys in India. But in America, Indra makes a better female name. You can even spell this name Indre.\n\n10. Aella\n\nAella is the Latin variant of the Greek name Aello and means ‘storm wind or whirlwind’. In the Greek mythology, Aela was the name of the Amazon warrior whom Herakles killed. She was renowned for carrying a double axe.\n\n11. Rainbow\n\nRainbow is the colorful semi-circle that people see in the sky after a rainy day. This cheerful name was widely popular in the 60s with the hippies. Holly Maddison has also chosen this name for her baby. And it’s also associated with Rainbow Rowell, the American novelist.\n\n12. Skye\n\nThis weather-inspired moniker, also referring to the Scottish Isle of Skye, brings the mighty sky down to earth. This spelling of sky is often used for girls than boys. It entered the baby girl name list in the year 1987, via Skye Chandler, a character in “All My Children”.\n\n13. Rainn\n\nRain is a pure version of rain-related names. You can also select Rainn, Raine, Reine and Rayne. Rain would make an excellent middle name as well. Brooke Burke named her daughter Heaven Rain.\n\n14. Makani\n\nThis Hawaiian name, meaning ‘wind’ was initially thought as a baby boy name, but it got a feminine lilt when Woody Harrelson chose it for his daughter. Mikey would make a cute nickname for Makani.\n\n15. Scirocco\n\nThis is the most tantalizing name in the list. Scirocco is an Italian name derived from Arabic and means ‘warm wind.’ Volkswagen also named one of its car Scirocco. The alternate spelling of this name is Cirocco.\n\n16. Summer\n\nThe sky is clearest during summer. So why not name your daughter after this season? This name began to be used in the 70s and has been heard consistently since then. This moniker has been featured on the big and small screen like “(500) Days of Summer”, “Baywatch” and “The Mentalist”. Summer is a soothing name preferred by parents who love the season. Faith Drew, a mother, says she named her child Summer because she was born in the summer season. She says, “My first child, Summer was born in the summer, and I just love names that are seasonal or have some sort of like seasonal meaning behind them (i).”\n\n17. Coro\n\nCora\n\n, the Native American name, meaning ‘wind’ is also a place name in Venezuela. This moniker would make an innovative pick for a baby of either sex, but we think it sounds slightly feminine.\n\n18. Reva\n\nReva is a Hindi name, meaning ‘rain.’ It refers to one of the seven sacred rivers of India. Its namesake is Reva Shayne, a character on the American soap series “Guiding Light”.\n\n19. Hurricane\n\nThis term for the storm has started being used for the baby name as well, all thanks to the tennis star Hurricane Black. You can use this tempestuous name for boys too. But it hasn’t been recorded as a baby boy name yet.\n\n20. Rainey\n\nRainey, reminiscent of rainy, has an old-time country feel to it, perhaps because of Ma Rainey, who is fondly referred to as the “Mother of the Blues.” Andie MacDowell named his daughter Rainie, which gives us another option.\n\n21. Tornado\n\nIf you want to give your little girl an attention-grabbing name, go with Tornado. You would be amazed to know it is the name of the sister of the tennis player star named Hurricane.\n\n22. Tempest\n\nTempest is an evocative word name, meaning ‘stormy.’ It is famous, not just for being the title of one of the most memorable plays of Shakespeare, but also for its association with Tempestt Bledsoe, the American actress.\n\n23. Varsha\n\nVarsha is a Hindu name coming from the Sanskrit word for ‘rain’. This exotic name has a hint of the tropical monsoon, the time when rain restores the parched land and turns the dry fields to green.\n\n24. Mistral\n\nLe Mistral is the cold and strong cold wind spilling over the Alps and rushing across the Mediterranean Sea. This out-of-the-ordinary baby girl name would be a beneficial force to be reckoned with.\n\n25. Talia\n\nTalia, meaning ‘rain from heaven’ has been rising the popularity charts along with other Russian flavored names. It entered the top 300-baby name list for the first time in the year 2015.\n\n26. Zephyrine\n\nZephyrine is the feminine variation of the Greek name Zephyr and means ‘west wind.’ Also considered a cousin to Seraphina and Severine, Zephyrine would make a distinct name for your daughter.\n\n27. Alya\n\nAlya is a lovely Arabic name, meaning ‘sky.’ This name is quite familiar in the United States in its slightly more complicated form Aliya. Besides, this established Muslim first name is also a Turkish place name.\n\n28. Amaterasu\n\nThe name Amaterasu is inspired by the Japanese mythology and means ‘heaven and sky’. It belonged to the Japanese sun goddess, who was also the ruler of the heavens. The Japanese believe the royal family descended from her.\n\n29. Araceli\n\nAraceli is a melodic Spanish name and means ‘altar of the sky.’ It’s an epithet of Mother Mary in her role as a patron saint of Lucena. Araceli Segarra, a noted mountain climber, is its famous namesake.\n\n30. Azure\n\nThe name Azure comes from an English word and means ‘sky blue.’ In the Middle Ages, Azure was another name for lapis lazuli. Azure Parsons, the American actress, is its most famous bearer.\n\n31. Corentine\n\nCorentine is the feminine variation of the name Corentin and means ‘tempest or storm.’ This name has never really been in the top 100 but is now on the upswing after a period of neglect.\n\n32.

Nephele\n\nNephele is an intriguing Greek nymph name that isn’t much heard in the modern world. Nephele was created from a cloud by Zeus, who later made her goddess of clouds.\n\n34. Thora\n\nThora, the goddess of thunder and storm has a name that is much gentler and softer than its meaning. This moniker was publicized by the famous actress Thora Birch.\n\n35. Aria\n\nThis female name, meaning ‘air’ is quickly moving up the charts and has even entered the top 100 baby name list, all thanks to “Game of Thrones.”\n\n36. Esen\n\nEsen is a Turkish name, meaning ‘the wind.’ It’s dramatic and windswept, and it would make an unique name for your daughter.\n\n37. Haneul\n\nHaneul is a Korean unisex name, meaning ‘sky.’ We think it would make a perfect pick for parents who want a name that bridges cultures.\n\n38. Ilma\n\nIlma is a very popular nature-inspired name in Finland. Meaning ‘air,’ Ilma is also known as the Hungarian variation of the name Amelia.\n\n39.

Miku\n\nMiku is a Japanese name, meaning ‘beautiful sky.’\n\nWeather Inspired Baby Names For Boys\n\n1. Bayu\n\nBayu is an Indonesian name, meaning ‘wind.’ It does sound similar to Bayou since both are Indonesian baby name, but the meaning of both the monikers is different.\n\n2. Hanish\n\nHanish Gilgamesh is a literary name, meaning ‘one who forewarns of storms.’ This moniker, inspired by the epic would make a challenging choice. So you can opt for its friendly version Hamish in such case.\n\n3. Rai\n\nRai is a distinctive and intriguing name, meaning ‘storm.’ This hip name would sound better as a middle name than the first name. But it’s capable of standing as a first name as well.\n\n4. Thor\n\nThor is the mighty name of the Norse god of storm, thunder, and strength. It was, for long considered a comic book stable, but now that it has invaded the big screen, it could soon land on the birth certificates as well.\n\n5.
