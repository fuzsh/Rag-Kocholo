        "text": "Sky Italia has extended its broadcast rights deal for the English Premier League for a further three seasons.\n\nThe current contract, also a three-year deal, takes it through until the end of the 2024-25 season.\n\nAs before, Sky will cover all 10 matches per round across its linear channels and the Now streaming service.\n\nMarzio Perrelli, Sky’s EVP Sport, said: “We are happy to announce this agreement with the Premier League, which will remain a fundamental pillar of Sky Sport’s offering in the coming seasons.”\n\nLast month, it was confirmed that Sky Deutschland had retained exclusive broadcasting rights across all distribution channels in Germany, and non-exclusive rights in Austria and Switzerland.\n\nSky Italia also holds the rights to three games per round in Italy’s Serie A, shared with DAZN, which also screens the remaining games."
