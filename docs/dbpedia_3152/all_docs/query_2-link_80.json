The best way to keep cool is, of course, with a typical, homemade gelato ice cream.\n\nTraditional Italian Gelato\n\nIce cream in Italy is like nowhere else in the world, and once you’ve tried it, nothing else will compare. Italian gelato has become popular worldwide for its rich, creamy texture and intense flavours, although the best gelato is of course found in Italy. It is often considered a more refined and artisanal version of ice cream and one of the main differences between gelato and normal ice cream is the composition. Gelato is made with a base of milk, sugar, and often eggs, while ice cream typically includes a higher proportion of cream. This lower fat content gives Italian gelato a smoother and softer texture, and it’s got a little je ne sais quoi (or non so cosa) that makes it truly unique.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Italian gelato is the wide range of flavours available. In addition to classic ice cream flavours like vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, traditional Italian gelaterias often offer a plethora of creative and unique options. You can find gelato ice cream flavours such as pistachio, hazelnut, coffee, tiramisu, stracciatella (chocolate chip), fruity sorbets, and even more unique gelato flavour choices like lavender or saffron. But what is the most popular flavour of ice cream in Italy? Check out our gelato flavours list, including the Italian ice cream names, so that you can try them all on your next trip to Italy.\n\nDuring the summer there is nothing better than going in search of the perfect taste in the numerous different Italian ice cream parlours that are found across the country. You can find loads of rankings online of the best ice cream parlours in Italy, but today we’re switching things up: we want to tell you about the most famous and popular Italian ice cream flavours.\n\nThe 10 best ice cream flavours to try in Italy\n\nCheck out our gelato flavours list to make sure you don't miss out on the best ice cream flavours to try in Italy:\n\nCrema (cream)\n\nCioccolato (classic chocolate, but like you’ve never experienced before)\n\nPistacchio (pistachio ice.cream, and the gelato is a pale, dusty green, that’s a good thing)\n\nStracciatella (vanilla with chocolate bits)\n\nMandorla (almond)\n\nLimone (refreshing lemon)\n\nFragola (strawberry)\n\nSpumoni (a multicoloured ice cream with fruit and nuts, like Neapolitan on steroids)\n\nBacio (chocolate and hazelnut)\n\nFrutti di scusa (fruit)\n\nWhile this is a great list to get started, especially when it comes to recognising Italian ice cream names, you should be careful when choosing your Italian ice cream flavour… if you can, check the ingredients contained in the product because it’s not always easy to understand in a few seconds whether the ice cream in front of you is a homemade, artisan ice cream of excellent quality or not.\n\nHow to recognise good gelato in Italy\n\nGelato has a long history in Italy and is deeply rooted in Italian culinary traditions. Here are some simple tips and tricks to know if you’re eating true artisan Italian ice cream:\n\na good ice cream must have a natural colour (without artificial colouring)\n\na good ice cream should not be too bright or opaque\n\na good ice cream must have the right consistency, i.e. medium-hard\n\na good ice cream should be fresh, made with fresh milk and cream\n\na good homemade ice cream should not contain preservatives\n\nBut what about that age-old question – cone or tub? Which should you choose to eat ice cream like a real Italian? Gelato is typically served in a display case in the gelateria, where it is stored at a slightly warmer temperature than traditional ice cream. It is scooped into a cup or a cone and often garnished with fresh fruit, nuts, or a dollop of whipped cream.\n\nHowever, true connoisseurs and lovers of ice cream recommend tasting a flavour strictly in a tub to be able to feel the full force of the taste without contamination or strange mixtures. If, on the other hand, you’re more of a cone person, then by all means go ahead and eat your ice cream in a cone. Just make sure it’s crunchy and fresh."
