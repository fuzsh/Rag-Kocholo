        "text": "This was the first ever custom brand campaign to run in the Italian market. The campaign was overwhelmingly successful, generating 3.4 million video views in a short period of time, with a very modest budget. The quality of the copy, the attention-grabbing nature of the video assets, and the surprise element of the random response mechanic proposed by Xâs in-house creative team, all combined to deliver outstanding reach and engagement.\n\nVideo ads on X provide a more engaging way to tell your story and captivate your audience. X is becoming a video-first platform, with video now part of more than 8 in 10 of unique user sessions.Â\n\nBranded Notifications enable advertisers to have 1-1 conversations at scale, delivering time-triggered, automated @mention posts directly to opted-in users at the moments that matter most.Â\n\nFor Sky Italia, people who \"liked\" the call-to-action (CTA) post received a personalized notification from Sky that was randomly selected from a pre-written set of possible responses.Â\n\nTheir opt out messaging was also baked-in to the post copy, to ensure brand safety.Â"
