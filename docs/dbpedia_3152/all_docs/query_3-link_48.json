        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Sky Studios and Groenlandia are readying feature film director Sydney Sibilia’s first TV drama series. Someone Killed Spiderman – Accidentally Famous (working title) is for Sky Italia and is about a non-conformist teenager who becomes on half of successful musical duo 883.\n\nThe show first came to attention last year, and the package has now come together with Sky Studios and Banijay-owned Groenlandia co-producing the show.\n\nIt will be set in 1980s Italy and follow frustrated teenager Max, who meets future musical partner Mauro and goes on to reach stardom. It is inspired by the story of how Italian pop band 883 was formed and the title is the same as duo’s iconic first album.\n\nSibilia is creating, writing and producing through his Banijay-owned production house, Groenlandia, which recently launched Netflix drama Supersex. This marks a first television venture for the film director, whose features include Can Quit Whenever I Want and Rose Island.\n\nBanijay Rights, the sales arm of Groenlandia’s parent company, Banijay, has international sales rights.\n\nSynopsis reads: “In the late 1980s, in the small Italian town Pavia, teenager Max finds solace in comic books and American music, standing out as a non-conformist in a place there is nothing to be rebellious about. After neglecting high school to pursue friendships and punk nights, failure inevitably catches up with him. But this opens doors to a life-changing opportunity, transferring to a new high school where he crosses paths with Mauro. Music makes the pair inseparable.\n\n“Thanks to Mauro’s driving force, Max embraces his musical talent and together they compose the first songs that will be produced by Claudio Cecchetto. But when success overwhelms them, the question arises: will Max and Mauro, despite their differences, manage to stick together?”\n\nDirecting alongside Sibilia are Francesco Ebbasta and Alice Filippi, with Francesco Agostini, with Chiara Laudani and Giorgio Nerone joining him as writers.\n\n“Someone Killed Spiderman – Accidentally Famous will plunge viewers into youth culture from the 80s, weaving in a narrative of rebellion, friendship, and the pursuit of dreams,” said Sibilia. “For many of us it will be a nostalgic gallop into music that means so much, and for others, it is a stellar story of two friends who come together in a life-changing way. It is exciting to work on my first TV series with great partners like Sky Studios and Banijay Rights on board”.\n\nSimon Cox, EVP Content & Acquisitions at Banijay Rights, added: “Sydney Sibilia is well-known for his ability to blend warmth and humour with poignant storytelling. There is something special about the content Groenlandia creates and with this drama viewers can expect a journey into the vibrant 1980s culture, cherished by audiences and broadcasters worldwide. Showcasing this title is testament to our commitment to bring this series to buyers from around the world.”\n\nSibilia runs Groenlandia alongside Matteo Rovere, who has to date led on TV productions. The company’s latest series, Supersex, made its international debut at Berlinale last month. It also produced Prime Video’s No Activity and Antonia, Sky’s Romulus and another Netflix show, The Law According to Lidia Poet. Recent films include El Paraiso, which screened at the Venice Film Festival last year, as well as Sheep Among Wolves and September."
