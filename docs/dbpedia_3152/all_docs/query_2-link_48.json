        "text": "Well yes, Sky Digital is owned by News Corporation, which also owns Foxtel in Oz.\n\nas you can see here, Sky Italia use the same remote.\n\nSome remotes are the same, if made by the same company, like a Sony remote will work with almost every other Sony TV.\n\n0\n\nSky, Foxtel and Sky Italia are all partly owned by NewsCorp, all using the same EPG software and NDS technology (which also happens to be NewsCorp owned). Therefore they all have the same remote layout. I know the MySky boxes from Sky NZ also now follow the same setup, but the normal satellite receivers use different EPG software and I think different remotes. I know that remote layout is also used by Tata Sky, but I have no idea what EPG software and boxes it is using.\n\n0\n\nAustar in Australia -also- use that remote. I think it may be an NDS design...\n\nI think it's more a NewsCorp design than an NDS one, as it's all the companies that NewsCorp have interests in that use that remote design. The same applies to the EPG software. I've noticed NDS develops two customisable EPG's, the Sky one that is adapted to all the other NewsCorp companies, and another generic one which can be customised to each provider who wishes to use it. In the case of Austar, I think they are closely connected with Foxtel in some way.\n\n0\n\nThey have a nicer looking EPG too judgiung by that website and it appears that ALL their programmes are given ratings for parental control purposes. Something that is boasted about here, but very little channels use. The BBC, ITV and RTÉ never give ratings for their programmes so parental controls can't be used on any of their channels.\n\nPaddy\n\n0\n\nThey have a nicer looking EPG too judgiung by that website and it appears that ALL their programmes are given ratings for parental control purposes.

They don't use Sky's BBFC-based rating system as they don't have any basis to be showing BBFC-rated content.\n\nI'd suspect BBC and ITV will have age rating on Freesat.\n\n0\n\nIn Australia it's a requirement for all shows to be rated, in the same way it is in the US. Therefore, every show has a rating on the EPG. The rating is even displayed on Foxtel's Search and Scan banner, which means if they wanted to add that functionality here it's already in the software.\n\n0\n\nRTÉ rate -all- their shows.... on-screen. They don't use Sky's BBFC-based rating system as they don't have any basis to be showing BBFC-rated content.\n\nI'd suspect BBC and ITV will have age rating on Freesat.\n\nBut that still doesn't stop the channel from being watched when a certain film or programme is being broadcast though.\n\nIn the cinema, Ireland now uses a different ratings system to the UK, but on video/DVD it is the exact same, G (same as 'U'), PG, 12, 15 and 18, so surely these can still be used for films at least.\n\nPaddy\n\n0\n\nBut that still doesn't stop the channel from being watched when a certain film or programme is being broadcast though.\n\nIn the cinema, Ireland now uses a different ratings system to the UK, but on video/DVD it is the exact same, G (same as 'U'), PG, 12, 15 and 18, so surely these can still be used for films at least.\n\nPaddy\n\nThe age bands are the same, correct. The movies in the age bands often aren't (although thats not majorly of issue here).\n\nMy view of it is that its down to the parents to prevent children watching content they shouldn't, not let the magic box decide whats safe and whats not. Although theres not much risk of me having kids myself...\n\n0"
