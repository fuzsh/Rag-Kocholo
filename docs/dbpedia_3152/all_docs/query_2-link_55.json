        "text": "Iâve been playing this game since Season of Dreams, which was about three years ago. This game is absolutely wonderful! You make lots of new friends, the fan base isnât toxic, the scenery is beautiful, and itâs all free! Mostly. Weâll get to that. There are so many options built into the game to interact with other friendly people, like playing instruments together, flying around and doing shenanigans, or prodding the game for glitches and shooting up into the air at supersonic speeds. Itâs very fun, but sooner or later you realize that companies unfortunately have to make money in order to continue to produce free content. They really donât push in-app purchases at you too much, but I will admit that the game is a lot more fulfilling if you spend money on it. After youâve kind of done everything, you get into the waiting phase where your friends go inactive and you end up grinding for candles all the time. If you want any of the cool items, you have to grind consistently for about 45ish minutes a day for a couple weeks straight without missing any days. I mean, Iâm cool with it, but itâs definitely not for everyone. I stick around for the wacky people you meet and the spectacular art reference tool it can be, as you can pose your lil character and dress them with a very well designed wardrobe. All in all? Iâd say get it! Experience the game for yourself, then decide if you really wanna stick around. If so, see you in the clouds!\n\nAs I'm writing this review it's my first day of playing it. First of all it's easy and simple to play, when I first seen this game I thought it was just going to be a game where you learn and watch. I was really wrong, this game is very calm, fun, and you can make friends! This is the first time I've rated a game 5 stars and I personally think that this is one of the best games I had. I met this one person on here and they were really nice and helped me throughout the game, (yes this is my first day playing) people in here seem really nice and I'm happy that you made this game for people to enjoy. The only downside to this game in MY opinion is, actually NOTHING this game is just so great! Each time I make a review I just write a bit, but for this I can write soooo much about it even tho I've only played for less than an hour. I suggest you to try it (who evers reading this) even if you don't think you'll like it. Just give it a chance and this might turn into one of your favorite games out there. One of my favorite things about this game is that it gives us notifications about when our friend is online instead of waiting, another one of my favorite things is that it's not one of those games where it just tells you what to do. You can explore on your own and the art is great! The sounds also give us a great experience for what we're doing in the game. I hope you also enjoy this game like I am!"
