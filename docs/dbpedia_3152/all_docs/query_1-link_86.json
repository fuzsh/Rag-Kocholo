        "text": "Sky Go is region-locked to the UK and Ireland, which means anyone travelling or living elsewhere is prevented from using it. That is, of course, unless they use a VPN. A Virtual Private Network is software that allows users to easily change their virtual location and quickly bypass geo-restrictions.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, I’ll walk you through the process of watching Sky Go abroad using a VPN and tell you what to look for when choosing a provider. If you’re just after recommendations, here’s a summary of the best VPNs for Sky Go:\n\nNordVPN: The best VPN for watching Sky Go abroad. Works well with Sky Go and a host of other platforms. Includes top-notch security features, very high speeds, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nTIP In our testing we found that the cheapest NordVPN plan (Standard) works perfectly for Sky Go.\n\nSurfshark: Best value VPN for Sky Go. A low-cost VPN that allows unlimited simultaneous connections and has plenty of servers in the UK and Ireland for Sky Go.\n\nIPVanish: Highly effective VPN that makes it as easy as possible to use Sky Go — and a host of other streaming platforms — abroad. Blocks ads, doesn’t keep logs, and lets you secure any number of devices at once.\n\nExpressVPN: Fast UK servers provide a high-quality streaming experience on Sky — and all other major platforms. Provides market-leading security and has an app for routers.\n\nPrivate Internet Access: Allows unlimited device connections and has dedicated streaming servers for accessing Sky Go. Strong on privacy and with fast connection speeds.\n\nProtonVPN: Very fast, with hundreds of UK streaming servers. Admirable commitment to security and privacy. Keeps no logs and has 24/7 customer support.\n\nPrivateVPN: Low-cost provider that works great with Sky Go and other streaming platforms. Can provide remote control assistance and is compatiuble with routers.\n\nPureVPN: An inexpensive VPN that works flawlessly with Sky Go and most other streaming services. Doesn’t keep logs and offers apps for just about any device.\n\nHotspot Shield: Beginner-friendly VPN with dedicated streaming servers for Sky Go. Has a large server network and works in China.\n\nCriteria for VPNs for streaming Sky Go abroad\n\nWe know that people get frustrated trying to choose between VPN providers. After all, much of VPN companies’ marketing material sounds remarkably similar. To help consumers, we perform an in-depth evaluation process that removes the need for taking company claims at face value. We look at the following areas:\n\nStreaming performance: The first thing we check is whether providers work with Sky Go. If they do, we try them with other popular platforms, too, and score them accordingly. In addition to this, we consider whether they offer a smart DNS service and whether they have streaming-optimized servers. Finally, we ask one of our resident experts to score each provider.\n\nSpeed in the UK & Ireland: As Sky Go is only available in the UK and Ireland, we perform speed tests for each provider while connected to servers in—you guessed it—the UK and Ireland. Tests are carried out on a home broadband connection to give users an accurate idea of what speeds they can realistically expect.\n\nSecurity & privacy: We score providers according to 15 different security and privacy criteria. These include which VPN protocols they support, the level of encryption and authentication they use, and whether they have anonymous payment options.\n\nEase of use: We use 10 different metrics to calculate providers’ ease of use scores. In addition to judging their design, we look at things like the parity of their features between apps and the existence — or non-existence — of task-specific servers.\n\nValue for money: Value isn’t just about price. The eight different criteria we use for calculating a value for money score include the number of permitted connections and the existence of a free trial and money-back guarantee.\n\nA full breakdown of our testing methodology is available later in the article.\n\nBest VPNs for Sky Go streaming – a snapshot of features\n\nBest VPNs for Sky Go\n\nWe’ve reviewed each of our recommended VPNs for Sky Go below:\n\n1. NordVPN\n\nAug 2024 Unblocks Sky GOTested Aug 2024\n\nNordVPN is an excellent choice for a Sky Go VPN. In fact, it’s an excellent choice for streaming generally—it worked with all the streaming platforms we tested it with, including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, Max, and Disney+.\n\nThe company has a strong presence in the UK and Ireland, with 440+ RAM-only servers spread across four UK cities and 50+ RAM-only servers in the Republic of Ireland’s capital, Dublin. These servers are all streaming-friendly and suitable for use with Sky Go.\n\nWe wanted to know how fast connections were, so we performed three speed tests connected to a UK server and three connected to a server in Ireland. Speeds were excellent throughout, with only a negligible drop when connected.\n\nNordVPN’s tested download speeds while connected to servers in UK and Ireland\n\nSpeeds were particularly fast for UK servers — though this is likely because we were connecting from the UK. Overall, the average speed was only 2.16 Mbps slower than our connection speed when not using a VPN.\n\nNordVPN has several interesting features that help it stand out from the crowd. One is the range of specialty servers available. Depending on which type of server you choose, you can connect to the Tor network in a single click or establish a connection to two VPN servers for additional security and privacy. There’s also an option to use obfuscated servers, which will enable you to bypass VPN blocks — even in heavily restrictive countries such as China.\n\nThe company has developed its own connection protocol, NordLynx, which helps ensure consistently fast connection speeds. Its Meshnet service provides a neat way to create your own private network for file sharing or remote device access.\n\nNordVPN is backed by a true zero-logs policy and uncrackable 256-bit encryption. It’s also leak-free, which we tested for ourselves using browserleaks.com.\n\nDuring the tests, we found no IP address leaks, Web RTC leaks, or DNS leaks. This is important as any leak of your true location (if outside the UK) would stop Sky Go from working.\n\nNordVPN’s live chat support is available on the website. If you’re struggling to access Sky Go, this should be your first port of call. Staff typically know which servers are best for particular streaming services.\n\nWhile you’re abroad, NordVPN’s automatic Wi-Fi protection ensures you’re always secure when using public Wi-Fi networks. A split tunneling feature allows you to simultaneously use Sky Go connected to a VPN while using other apps with a regular internet connection.\n\nNordVPN’s software is available for Windows, macOS, iOS, Linux, and Android. If you want to use Sky Go with a device that doesn’t support VPNs natively, you can purchase pre-configured routers through flash routers.\n\nA single NordVPN subscription allows subscribers to connect up to ten devices at the same time, which means everyone in your household can use it to watch Sky Go.\n\nGiven its strong unblocking abilities, a large number of speedy UK servers, and reasonable price tag, NordVPN is easy to recommend as the go-to provider for using Sky Go while abroad.\n\nBEST VPN FOR SKY GO:NordVPN is our first choice. Extremely fast, with impressive unblocking ability and great privacy and security features. Risk-free 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nRead our full NordVPN review.\n\nNordVPN Coupon\n\nUp to 73% off + 3 months Free\n\nGet Deal >\n\nDiscount applied automatically\n\n2. Surfshark\n\nUnblocks Sky GOTested Aug 2024\n\nSurfshark excels at streaming region-locked content from abroad. In our tests, it worked seamlessly with Sky Go as well as popular platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, and BBC iPlayer.\n\nFor Sky Go and other geo-restricted UK streaming services, you can use one of Surfshark’s 212+ UK servers. These are spread across four cities: Manchester, London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. There are also servers available in Dublin.\n\nWe tested Surfshark’s download speeds at three different times of day while connected to a server in London and then in Dublin.\n\nSurfshark’s tested download speeds while connected to servers in UK and Ireland\n\nSpeeds were excellent and certainly fast enough to stream Sky Go content without buffering. The average download speed was a mere 3.26 Mbps slower than our average download speed when not using the VPN.\n\nFeature-wise, Surfshark is notable for having an alternative ID generator. This allows you to generate an alternative persona complete with name, address, and date of birth. It is particularly useful for signing up to streaming services where an address is needed. Unfortunately, it’s currently only available in the US, Denmark, Australia, Germany, Portugal, and Brazil, so it’s not very good for setting up a Sky Go account.\n\nAnother Surfshark feature that you’ll struggle to find with other VPNs is the availability of static IP addresses. These are useful if you’re hosting a gaming server or carrying out another task that requires an unchanging IP address. Static IP addresses are currently available in the UK, the US, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, and Singapore. If you want exclusive use of an IP address, you can pay a few dollars more per month for one of Surfshark’s dedicated IPs.\n\nSurfshark uses strong encryption and doesn’t store any logs, a claim that’s been verified through independent third-party audits. Torrenting is allowed, and a kill switch is built into both mobile devices and desktop apps to prevent your true IP address from being exposed to Sky Go if the VPN connection suddenly drops out.\n\nApps are available for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We confirmed that these were leak-free by connecting to a server in Portugal and confirming that our UK location was hidden. We also subjected Surfshark to WebRTC and DNS leak tests — which it passed.\n\nFor users who are concerned about their location being traced, Surfshark offers a rotating IP address feature. This changes your IP address without the need to disconnect and reconnect to a server. We don’t recommend using it while streaming Sky Go, but it could provide reassurance if anonymity is important to you.\n\nThose living in oppressive countries can enable the NoBorders mode to bypass VPN blocks. This works in China, which shows just how effective it is.\n\nSurfshark allows you to connect an unlimited number of devices at once. This, combined with its low subscription costs, fast speeds, and streaming ability, makes it a close second to NordVPN.\n\nBEST BUDGET VPN:Unblock Sky Go on as many devices as you want with Surfshark, an inexpensive VPN that’s backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nRead our full Surfshark review.\n\nSurfshark Coupon\n\nSave 86% on a 2 year Starter plan + 3 months free\n\nGet Deal >\n\nDiscount applied automatically\n\n3. IPVanish\n\nIPVanish operates more than 2,400 servers across 60+ countries. This includes the UK and Ireland, where it has servers in four UK locations and one in the Republic of Ireland. All are suitable for use with Sky Go.\n\nWhen we carried out our testing, there were 179 servers available, none of which had a load greater than 25%. This makes it easy to find a server for Sky Go that isn’t congested with other users.\n\nWe were able to access Sky Go and other UK-based streaming platforms, including ITV Hub, Channel 4, and BBC iPlayer. By connecting to a server in the US, we could watch the US content libraries of both Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nTo find out what download speeds users could expect when using IPVanish, we carried out a series of speed tests while connected to servers in the UK and Ireland.\n\nIPVanish’s tested download speeds while connected to servers in UK and Ireland\n\nDownload speeds were excellent in both countries, though we did have one slower-than-average connection in Dublin. Even then, you’d have no trouble streaming Sky Go content without buffering. On average, download speeds while connected to the VPN were just 3.06 Mbps slower than when we connected without, which is a great result.\n\nThe app is easy to use and has a distinctive design with plenty going on. There’s a graph showing the amount of data uploaded and downloaded in real-time alongside a map with the location of your current connection pinned to it.\n\nIPVanish uses unbreakable encryption and offers a kill switch that will stop sending data if your connection drops. This prevents your true location from being revealed to Sky Go mid-stream.\n\nThe provider has been independently audited to prove that it doesn’t keep logs and has automatic tracker-blocking, as well as split tunneling functionality. Split tunneling means you could watch Sky Go while connected to a UK server, but use other apps at the same time with a regular internet connection.\n\nThe company’s software is leak-free, which we verified by connecting to a server in Japan and performing IP, DNS, and WebRTC leak tests.\n\nIPVanish users can scramble their traffic (on OpenVPN connections) to help access the Sky Go app if they’re in a country that blocks or otherwise restricts VPN usage. It’s worth noting, however, that IPVanish won’t work in countries with extreme censorship, such as China. If you are planning a visit to China and want to use Sky Go while there, we recommend any one of the other providers in this article.\n\nIPVanish offers apps for Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows, Linux, and Amazon Fire TV. Alternatively, you can configure a connection with most routers (check the support center for instructions and router compatibility). Configuring a connection on your router lets you stream Sky Go on VPN-incompatible devices such as game consoles and smart TVs.\n\nBRITISH TV ABROAD:IPVanish works seamlessly with Sky Go, BBC iPlayer, and NOW TV. It’s fast, security-conscious, and novice-friendly. Annual plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee so there’s no harm in giving it a shot.\n\nInterested?

ExpressVPN\n\nUnblocks Sky GOTested Aug 2024\n\nExpressVPN optimizes all of its servers for maximum speed and stability, and it works extremely well at accessing a host of streaming services. We successfully used it with Sky Go, as well as the UK and US content libraries of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe provider has four UK server locations — and one in the Republic of Ireland — that you can use with the Sky Go app.\n\nWe carried out speed tests while connected to servers in both countries. ExpressVPN was notable for its consistent download speeds throughout the day — as the chart below demonstrates.\n\nExpressVPN’s tested download speeds while connected to servers in UK and Ireland\n\nOverall, ExpressVPN’s average download speed was only 2.56 Mbps slower than our average speed when not connected. This makes it a great VPN for uninterrupted streaming of HD SkyGo content and UHD content from other platforms.\n\nThe app’s dashboard is visually appealing and very easy to use — even for someone who has no experience with VPN software. Connections are established almost instantaneously, so there’s no waiting around like you have to do with some providers. If you do have any trouble connecting or accessing Sky Go, live customer support is available through the ExpressVPN website 24 hours per day, seven days per week.\n\nThe design is a little more rudimentary outside of the main dashboard but still offers plenty of features. The Options screen provides access to the various settings and protocol options.\n\nIn the General section, you can enable or disable the kill switch, split tunneling, and auto-connect-on-launch features. The Advanced Protection tab lets you choose whether to block ads and trackers and also has options for blocking access to malicious sites or those displaying pornography.\n\nUse the Protocols tab to choose between the well-established OpenVPN protocol and ExpressVPN’s very own Lightway protocol. If you’re experiencing slow speeds, playing around with the various protocol options can sometimes yield results. The default setting allows ExpressVPN to choose on your behalf — which is good enough for the majority of users.\n\nExpressVPN’s encryption standards are as strong as those of any VPN, namely 256-bit AES encryption (often dubbed military-grade encryption) and perfect forward secrecy.\n\nThe company doesn’t log any of its customers’ activity or IP addresses, opting only to gather non-identifying metadata. It also doesn’t inadvertently leak users’ locations—we tested this for ourselves by connecting to a server in Australia. As you can see from the test results below, our location in the UK was hidden. The provider also passed the WebRTC and DNS leak tests.\n\nApps are available for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux (command line). If you watch Sky Go on a device that doesn’t support VPNs, you can install ExpressVPN’s customer router firmware on compatible Wi-Fi routers or purchase a pre-configured router directly from the company.\n\nConfiguring a VPN connection on a router means that every connected device uses the VPN tunnel. If you want to use this route to stream Sky Go on a smart TV or games console, ExpressVPN’s router app makes it the most hassle-free option.\n\nSTEADY SPEEDS:ExpressVPN is great for streaming. Reliably unblocks Sky Go as well as many other online services. Exceptional speeds for buffer-free High Definition viewing along with total security and online privacy. Includes 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nRead our full ExpressVPN review.\n\nExpressVPN Coupon\n\nSAVE: 49% + 3 months free\n\nGet Deal >\n\nCoupon applied automatically\n\n5. Private Internet Access\n\nUnblocks Sky GOTested Aug 2024\n\nPrivate Internet Access (PIA) operates a global network of servers in over 91 countries. This includes the UK, where it has general-use servers in three locations, as well as streaming-optimized servers. The provider also has servers in Dublin.\n\nWe successfully accessed Sky Go while connected to PIA’s streaming-optimized servers. We were also able to access BBC iPlayer, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video without issue.\n\nIf you’re interested in accessing content libraries in specific countries, PIA has streaming optimized servers in 12 countries in all — the majority of which are in Europe.\n\nWe tested PIA’s download speeds by connecting to servers in the UK and Ireland several times during the course of a day. The results were remarkably consistent, as you can see in the chart below.\n\nPIA achieved impressive download speeds during testing\n\nOn average, PIA was the fastest provider overall and caused a drop of only 1.76 Mbps when connected. This makes it a great choice for those who want to stream UHD videos or play online games without interruption.\n\nWe verified that PIA didn’t leak our IP address while connected to the UK streaming server — which would be a sure-fire way to get blocked by Sky Go. We also confirmed that there were no WebRTC or DNS leaks.\n\nSubscribers are allowed unlimited bandwidth and PIA doesn’t impose data caps. More specifically, the provider allows unlimited simultaneous device connections. This means you can share your account with everyone in your household who needs a VPN.\n\nTop-notch encryption standards are combined with a no-logs policy to keep your ISP and other snoopers out of your data. PIA has had its no-logs policy successfully audited by Deloitte, the results of which are available on its website.\n\nThe software includes an internet kill switch and malware filtering. It also includes a Shadowsocks proxy and port forwarding, which can be handy if you want to torrent and can be difficult to find elsewhere.\n\nOverall, the interface is very easy to use, with more advanced features accessible without feeling intimidating.\n\nOpening the expanded dashboard by clicking/ tapping the down arrow provides you with a wealth of information, including the amount of data uploaded and downloaded; the protocol and encryption being used; and icons showing which features are enabled.\n\nApps are available for Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux — all of which look and behave remarkably similarly. If your device isn’t VPN-compatible, PIA has setup guides for manually configuring the VPN on various VPN-compatible routers. Live chat support is available 24/7 and the VPN provides a satisfying 30-day money-back guarantee to let you try it out.\n\nHIGHLY CUSTOMIZABLE:PIA offers apps for all popular devices that allow you to fiddle with the encryption settings and connect as many devices as you want, making it ideal for power users. Comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nRead our full Private Internet Access review.\n\nPrivate Internet Access Coupon\n\nSAVE 82% on the 2 yr plan\n\nGet Deal >\n\nDiscount applied automatically\n\n6. ProtonVPN\n\nunblocks Sky GOTested Aug 2024\n\nProtonVPN is a privacy-first provider with hundreds of servers in the UK and more than 20 available in Ireland. While all are suitable for streaming, you might need to try a few before you find one that works with Sky Go.\n\nOnce we found a UK server that worked with Sky Go, we used it to successfully connect to other UK-based streaming services such as Channel 4, BBC iPlayer, and ITVX. ProtonVPN also works with the likes of Amazon Prime Video, and Netflix. If you don’t have the time (or inclination) to try out different servers, ProtonVPN’s customer support team is available around the clock over live chat and should be able to point you to the most suitable server for a particular platform.\n\nProtonVPN’s connection speeds are more than good enough for using Sky Go—even when streaming HD content. We conducted speed tests at various points during the day while connecting to servers in the UK and Ireland. Speeds were noticeably consistent and very fast—ProtonVPN was the third-fastest service after NordVPN and PIA.\n\nProtonVPN download speed test results\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with ProtonVPN, it’s worth noting that the company is well-regarded among privacy advocates. Activists and whistleblowers have long favored its free email service, and its VPN service is similarly respected.\n\nUsers with security concerns can take advantage of the company’s Secure Core servers. These are located in countries with strong privacy laws, housed in secure ProtonVPN-owned data centers, and connected to the internet using a dedicated network. Traffic is routed through these servers before going on to the user’s chosen server. It’s a multi-hop connection (like you get with some other VPNs) but with added security.\n\nThe service uses 256-bit encryption, has a kill switch, and prevents DNS and IPv6 leaks. We tested how leak-proof the software was by connecting to a server in Albania and confirming that our true location was hidden.\n\nProtonVPN has split tunneling for apps and domains and an ad, tracker, and malware blocker. It allows up to 10 simultaneous device connections, which is enough for most people.\n\nThe provider makes it easy for users to connect to custom DNS servers rather than use ProtonVPNs by default. There’s also an option to Moderate NAT, which disables the randomization of the local address mapping. This can help gamers establish direct connections. ProtonVPN allows port forwarding, which is another tool useful to gamers and torrenters — though not often offered by VPN providers.\n\nThe company doesn’t log any data that could identify you, accepts Bitcoin payments, and has undergone a third-party audit to prove that it’s really as secure as it claims to be.\n\nProtonVPN apps are available for iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and MacOS. This service also supports almost a dozen types of router firmware (though you’ll have to install it manually).\n\nNote that while ProtonVPN has a free tier, this isn’t suitable for accessing streaming platforms like Sky Go or BBC iPlayer from abroad. There are no free VPNs that are suitable for streaming, so this isn’t surprising.\n\nANONYMITY ABOVE ALL:ProtonVPN goes the extra mile. It’s very fast, can reliably access Sky Go outside of the UK, and is packed with security tools. What’s more, it doesn’t keep any logs, offers a limited free plan, and provides a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nCheck out our complete ProtonVPN review.\n\nProtonVPN Coupon\n\nUp to 64% off a 2-year plan\n\nGet Deal >\n\nCoupon applied automatically\n\n7. PrivateVPN\n\nUnblocks Sky GOTested Aug 2024\n\nPrivateVPN has just over 200 servers in its global network — which pales in comparison to the networks of the other providers in this list. Nevertheless, PrivateVPN is great for streaming and has UK servers in London and Manchester, as well as servers in Ireland.\n\nPing times are listed next to each server location, so you can just choose the location with the lowest number to get the fastest available speeds.\n\nWe tested PrivateVPN with Sky Go, and it worked great. We also successfully tried it with Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, and Max. However, in some instances, we could only establish a connection when the VPN was in stealth mode. This feature, which is available via the settings menu, is easy to enable and worth a try if you’re having connection issues.\n\nTo find out what speeds users are likely to get while using PrivateVPN to stream Sky Go, we connected to servers in the UK and Ireland and measured our download speeds multiple times.\n\nPrivateVPN download speed test results\n\nSpeeds were excellent overall. There was one noticeably slower connection during the day, but even this was fast enough to stream Sky Go in HD. On average, our download speeds were 4.06 Mbps slower when using PrivateVPN.\n\nPrivateVPN doesn’t skimp on security, utilizing strong encryption and adhering to a no-logs policy. Unusually among VPN providers, it allows users to choose what level of encryption to use while connected. Switching from AES-256 to AES-128 can give you a speed bump if needed while still providing enough security for most users.\n\nPrivateVPN is also unusual in that it allows port forwarding. The port number—displayed in the dashboard when connected—can be used in your torrent client to download and upload files more efficiently.\n\nThe provider’s apps include a kill switch and an Application Guard feature. If the VPN connection drops out, this feature will terminate any user-specified apps.\n\nApps also have built-in leak protection. We tested this by connecting to a server in Vietnam and checking that our UK location was hidden. We additionally performed successful WebRTC and DNS leak tests.\n\nThis is one of the cheaper VPNs available. If you’re willing to sign up for a three-year contract, subscriptions cost as little as $2 a month. Subscribers get access to apps for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android and can use up to 10 connected devices at the same time. The software is compatible with some routers, which is useful if you want to use Sky Go with a smart TV, for example.\n\nPrivateVPN’s customer service team is available via live chat, which is fairly standard for top-tier providers. What isn’t standard is that they can provide remote control assistance via TeamViewer if you’re having serious difficulties with the service.\n\nGREAT SPEEDS:PrivateVPN is a good family choice. Unblocks Sky Go and allows up to 10 devices on the same account. A small network of servers, but fast connections. 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nRead our full PrivateVPN review.\n\nPrivateVPN Coupon\n\nSave 85% on a one year plan + 24-months free\n\nGet Deal >\n\nDiscount applied automatically\n\n8. PureVPN\n\nunblocks Sky GOTested Aug 2024\n\nPureVPN is a solid option for anyone looking to watch Sky Go on vacation or while living abroad. It has hundreds of servers in London, Manchester, and Dublin that are suitable for accessing Sky Go and other UK-only platforms. PureVPN also works well with popular international streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, and Max.\n\nPureVPN has more than 6,000 servers in 65+ countries. Although it claims to have virtual servers in countries not offered by other VPN providers, such as China, Russia, India, and Afghanistan, this should be taken with a pinch of salt.\n\nFor example, when we tried connecting to its server in China, our IP address showed us as being in Indonesia. When we connected to a server in India, our IP address placed us in the US. The Russia server did work as expected however, so it’s not all bad.\n\nTo test PureVPN’s speeds, we used servers closer to home. Using a home broadband connection in the UK, we carried out several speed tests while connected to servers in the UK and Ireland.\n\nPureVPN download speed test results\n\nAlthough PureVPN wasn’t perhaps as consistent as some of the providers in our list, it’s speeds were great overall. Our average download speed dropped by 3.26 Mbps while connected — which isn’t much given our average base connection speed was 48.86 Mbps.\n\nIf you have any trouble with your connection, PureVPN’s support staff are on hand 24/7 over live chat (although you may have to wait a few minutes for a reply).\n\nPureVPN stops anyone from monitoring your online activities using uncrackable encryption, a kill switch, and leak protection. We confirmed that the leak protection worked by connecting to a server in Australia and checking whether our UK location was hidden. We also conducted DNS and WebRTC leak tests.\n\nPureVPN has an auto-connect feature, a tracker blocker, and app-based split tunneling. These can all be enabled or disabled using simple toggle switches. Behind the scenes, PureVPN’s automatic obfuscation helps users’ traffic evade VPN blocks. This is great news if you’re trying to access Sky Go from a particularly restrictive country like China.\n\nWe also approve of PureVPN’s refusal to store any logs. The provider claims to have an “always-on” audit policy, which allows it to be audited at any time. So far, it has undergone independent audits on two occasions.\n\nUnusually, PureVPN offers a five-year subscription plan, while most providers have a maximum of two years. Subscribing for longer means you lock in the introductory term and ultimately save more money.\n\nPureVPN has apps for Windows, Android, iOS, MacOS, and Linux. Furthermore, the help section on its website provides detailed instructions for getting the service up and running on your router. This enables you to use Sky Go with VPN-incompatible devices.\n\nSECURE AND AFFORDABLE:PureVPN has everything you'll need to stream your favorite shows safely. Long-term plans are reasonably priced and include a 31-day money-back guarantee.\n\nRead our full review of PureVPN to learn more.\n\nPureVPN Coupon\n\nUp to 82% off the 2-yr standard plan + free months\n\nGet Deal >\n\nDiscount applied automatically\n\n9. Hotspot Shield\n\nUnblocks Sky GOTested Aug 2024\n\nEditor’s note: Hotspot Shield is owned by Pango, Comparitech’s parent company.\n\nHotspot Shield is a versatile VPN that operates servers in 80+ countries — including some that aren’t covered by most VPNs. These include the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThe provider has general-use servers in two UK cities (Coventry and London) and one in the Republic of Ireland (Cork). More pertinently, it has dedicated streaming servers in the UK, which you should choose for accessing Sky Go. The video below shows you how to do it.\n\nUsing the UK streaming servers, we were able to access Sky Go and other UK-only streaming platforms such as BBC iPlayer, Channel 4, and ITVX. Dedicated streaming servers are also available in the US, which are ideal for accessing the larger content libraries of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. As a side note, Hotspot Shield has gaming-optimized servers in both the UK and US.\n\nWe tested Hotspot Shield’s download speeds by connecting to servers in the UK and Ireland at different points during the day. You can see the results below.\n\nHotspot Shield’s tested download speeds while connected to servers in UK and Ireland\n\nHotspot Shield’s download speeds are decent — though not as good as the other providers in our list. Nevertheless, they are ample for streaming Sky Go in HD. Our average speed dropped by 9.76 Mbps while connected to Hotspot Shield servers — which is roughly a fifth of our base connection speed. If you already have a slow broadband connection, knocking a fifth off may be too much of a sacrifice.\n\nFeature-wise, Hotspot Shield has a lot to offer. Its proprietary Hydra protocol works at bypassing VPN blocks in countries such as China, and it also offers WireGuard and IKEv2 as options.\n\nIf you’re traveling abroad, the auto-protect feature can ensure you never connect to public Wi-Fi without a VPN’s protection. The split tunneling feature is a little more advanced than most in that it allows you to specify which apps and domains should either be excluded from or exclusively included in the VPN tunnel.\n\nHotspot Shield keeps your activities private using a kill switch and 256-bit AES encryption. It also comes with DNS and IPv6 leak protection, which we tested ourselves by connecting to a server in Algeria.\n\nWhile Hotspot Shield didn’t leak our actual location in the UK, it didn’t connect us to a server in Algeria. Rather, our IP address suggested we were connected to a server in Amsterdam.\n\nWhen we tested for WebRTC leaks, our public IP address was in a different country again (Switzerland). This mismatch is just the sort of thing streaming services pick up on when blocking content, so it’s not ideal.\n\nWe wanted to know if there were similar problems with servers we’d use for accessing Sky Go, so we carried out the same leak tests while connected to Hotspot Shield’s UK streaming server.\n\nThe good news is that our IP address was correctly spoofed, and we looked like we were connecting from London.\n\nHowever, the same WebRTC issue arose. It wasn’t that there was a leak, it was just the country discrepancy — with our public IP linking to a server in Switzerland rather than the UK. This could cause issues with some streaming services, but as it doesn’t appear to do so with Sky Go, we can let it slide.\n\nHotspot Shield has apps for Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, and Android. It can also be configured on a wide range of home routers, enabling you to use the Sky Go app with a VPN-incompatible device on your home network.\n\nUK STREAMING SERVERS:Hotspot Shield has servers specially optimized for services like Sky GO, BBC iPlayer, and ITV Hub. Not only that, easy to use and great at bypassing VPN blocks. There’s even a 45-day money-back guarantee included.\n\nRead our full Hotspot Shield review.\n\nHotspot Shield Coupon\n\nSAVE 77% ON THE 3 YEAR PLAN\n\nGet Deal >\n\nDiscount applied automatically\n\nHow to watch Sky Go abroad\n\nConnecting to a VPN server in the UK assigns you a UK IP address while connecting to a server in Ireland gives you an Irish IP address. It’s that simple. Provided you’re using one of our recommended VPNs, this is all you need to do to bypass Sky Go’s geo-restrictions.\n\nHere’s how to watch Sky Go abroad:\n\nFirst, sign up for one of the VPNs for Sky Go listed above. We particularly recommend NordVPN.\n\nDownload and install the VPN software on your device or configure your router to use the VPN.\n\nRun the VPN, choose a server in the UK or Ireland, and connect.\n\nClear your cookies and refresh the page with the video you want to watch.\n\nHead over to Sky Go, launch a video, and enjoy the show!\n\nIf you have any trouble accessing Sky Go abroad after following these steps, you should try clearing your cache and trying an alternative server. If issues persist, contact your VPN provider for further support.\n\nSky Go VPN testing methodology\n\nThe ability to access streaming services is a key feature of consumer-facing VPNs — and one that VPN providers try to cash in on. However, not all VPNs work with platforms such as Sky Go. Even among those that do, the situation is far from fixed. A server that works one day may result in an error message the next. This is why we regularly test which providers work with which platforms — those that work with Sky Go are included here. But which one to choose? To help you decide, we carried out various tests to find out which was the best overall.\n\nStreaming performance\n\nMost people have access to more than one streaming service. These additional services often come courtesy of friends and family who’ve shared their login details (a practice we don’t condone!).\n\nWith this in mind, we’ve scored VPN providers on how well they can access a range of streaming services in addition to Sky Go. We’ve also included a score for providers with a smart DNS feature (more on this below) and a score for those with streaming-optimized servers that make it easier to locate working Sky Go servers. Finally, one of our resident experts has provided their own score for each provider.\n\nThe table above shows how we combined these different test scores to create an overall streaming performance score. The weightings reflect how important each metric is from a user’s perspective. We can use each provider’s overall score to more usefully compare their respective streaming abilities.\n\nOverall streaming performance scores by provider\n\nAs the chart shows, NordVPN has the best overall streaming performance. Surfshark and IPVanish also have solid scores. If streaming is your thing, these are the providers to choose.\n\nSpeed\n\nAs Sky Go is restricted to the UK and Ireland, we’re only really interested in the speed of each VPN’s UK servers rather than global averages. So, although we have existing lab-tested speed scores for Europe, we conducted another round of testing just for servers in the UK and Ireland.\n\nTo simulate the average user’s real-world experience, we tested each provider using a home broadband connection with an average speed of 48.86 Mbps. We tested each provider’s download speeds in the morning, at noon, and in the afternoon while connected to a UK server and then a server in Ireland. You can see the data we gathered in the chart below.\n\nDownload speed test result by provider (Mbps)\n\nIn terms of speed consistency throughout the day, PIA and Proton VPN were the best overall. PureVPN managed the fastest single speed we measured, and PrivateVPN the slowest.\n\nTo judge which provider was the fastest overall, we took an average of the results and converted them to a score out of ten. The results can be visualized as follows:\n\nOverall speed test scores by provider\n\nAs the chart makes clear, PIA is the fastest VPN on average, closely followed by NordVPN and ProtonVPN.\n\nSecurity & privacy\n\nVPNs that can’t offer users a high level of security and privacy should be avoided—which is easier said than done when they all seem to make very similar claims. To find out which providers make good on their promises, we score them against 15 different criteria. The data is in the table below.\n\nWe assign a score to each of these criteria to create an overall score out of 10. This makes it more convenient to compare providers directly.\n\nSecurity and privacy scores by provider\n\nBased on the chart above, ExpressVPN has the best overall security and privacy offering. It’s closely followed by NordVPN, Surfshark, and PureVPN. However, to be fair, all of our recommendations perform admirably in terms of protecting users’ data and online activities from interested third parties.\n\nEase of use\n\nIf you’re reading this, it’s likely that you’d prefer to spend time streaming Sky Go rather than learning how to configure a VPN client. With this in mind, we score providers based on how intuitive their apps are to use. We also consider nine other metrics when evaluating their relative ease of use. The data is presented in the table below.\n\nWe assign a score to each metric, which we use to generate an overall ease of use score.\n\nEase of use scores for each provider\n\nIf you want an easy life, NordVPN should be your first choice. IPVanish and PIA also provide a particularly user-friendly service perfect for beginners.\n\nValue for money\n\nWe all like a good deal, which is why we’ve chosen providers that offer good value for money. To arrive at our choices, we scored providers according to eight different metrics. You can see how they performed in each below.\n\nWe combine these scores to give us an overview of how the providers compare in terms of their relative value for money.\n\nOverall value for money scores by provider\n\nThere are three standout providers if you want the most bang for your buck: Surfshark, IPVanish, and NordVPN.\n\nHow to watch Sky Go using a Smart DNS proxy\n\nA smart DNS proxy provides an alternate way to bypass regional blocks. However, instead of encrypting all of your device’s traffic and routing it through a remote server, only your DNS requests are redirected. Thus, while paying for a standalone Smart DNS service may be able to help you unblock Sky Go – it will not also provide you with online privacy. This makes a VPN service much better value for money.\n\nIn addition, it is important to note that services like Sky Go actively block proxy services, including some VPNs (which is why you must pick carefully). Unfortunately, most Smart DNS services have now been blocked, which makes them unsuitable for streaming Sky Go.\n\nThe good news is that some VPNs have included a free Smart DNS service for their subscribers. This means you can use both the VPN and a Smart DNS proxy for the same low cost. This comes in handy if your device won’t let you install the VPN app directly (some Smart TVs, for instance).\n\nYou can see which of the providers in this article offer a smart DNS service in the table below:\n\nAltering your DNS settings is a bit trickier than setting up a VPN, but you usually don’t need to install any extra software.\n\nDNS settings can be adjusted using your device’s settings menu:\n\nSign up for a VPN that has a free Smart DNS service. We recommend NordVPN or Surfshark.\n\nValidate your device’s current IP address on the provider’s website.\n\nInput the primary and alternate DNS server addresses into your system’s internet settings (exact process differs depending on your device)\n\nSave changes and restart your device\n\nNavigate to the Sky Go webpage or open the Sky Go app and enjoy!\n\nSky Go channels\n\nSky Go is an online television service from UK broadcaster Sky that was first launched in 2006. It was previously known as Sky Player, Sky Anytime PC, and Sky By Broadband. The service allows Sky TV subscribers to watch live channels and on-demand video on internet-connected devices, including Windows PCs, Mac OSX, iOS, Android, and game consoles.\n\nViewers can access both live TV and replays via Sky Go. The table below contains a list of all the channels you can watch using Sky Go — use the search function if you want to check whether a particular channel is available.\n\nBear in mind that you can only watch channels if you’ve paid for them with your TV package. It’s also worth noting that content on Sky Go is only available for a limited amount of time after it first airs on TV. So don’t let the latest episode of your favorite show sit for too long!\n\nSky cable subscriptions start at 22 GBP per month with a minimum two-year contract.\n\nSubscribers can watch videos on up to two simultaneous connections by default, and up to four are available for an extra fee as part of the Sky Go Extra package. If you have used two devices in the past and want to use a third, you must remove an existing registered device before you can register another.\n\nSky Go Extra also allows users to download content to their local devices so they can watch offline. The content is DRM protected, which means it can’t be copied, distributed, or watched after the expiration date. Files are deleted 48 hours after viewing starts or no later than 30 days after download.\n\nSky Go not working with your VPN? Try this…\n\nIf you’re connected to one of the VPNs we recommend above but are still unable to watch Sky Go abroad, make sure you meet the rest of Sky Go’s technical requirements:\n\nSystem settings must be set to the English language\n\nTime zone must be set to UK time (UTC +0)\n\nYou need a browser that supports Microsoft Silverlight, which means Internet Explorer (not Edge) for Windows users and Safari for Mac users. Firefox and Chrome have both ended support for Silverlight.\n\nIf you tried accessing a video and were blocked prior to using a VPN or DNS proxy, it’s probably a good idea to clear your browser cookies and cache before making another attempt.\n\nSky Go is not supported on rooted Android devices\n\nCan I use a free VPN to watch Sky Go?\n\nWe’ve discussed some quality paid options for Sky Go VPN providers, but there are also a ton of free VPNs available. These seem like attractive choices but we recommend steering clear as these services are typically plagued with issues.\n\nA free VPN provider often has too many users and a limited number of servers. This results in long wait times for servers and slow, unreliable connections. And that’s not the worst part. Many of these services use shady business tactics to make money. They might track user activity, sell customer profiles to advertisers, and even steal users’ idle bandwidth.\n\nIt’s definitely worth a few dollars a month to know you’re being served and protected by a reputable VPN provider.\n\nIs it illegal to access Sky Go with a VPN?\n\nIt is not illegal to access Sky Go with a VPN. There is no law expressly prohibiting users from using a VPN when watching Sky Go.\n\nWhen you sign up for Sky Go, however, you have to accept the terms and conditions, which state you must:\n\nBe a resident of the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, or the Republic of Ireland.\n\nOnly access and use the Service via your Devices in the Territory.\n\nSo, using a VPN to access Sky Go from outside the UK may violate the terms of service, which could be grounds for Sky Go to terminate or suspend service. That being said, we have not seen any precedent of Sky Go taking action against VPN users other than simply blocking access from many VPNs.\n\nCan I watch Sky Go with Tor?\n\nIt might be possible but we wouldn’t recommend it. First of all, Tor is slow. Too slow to stream videos in good quality without buffering.\n\nSecond, Tor does not let you choose the location from which you’ll access the Internet by default. To get an exit node in the UK, you would have to set up Tor bridges. Even then, reliability could be an issue.\n\nThird, Sky Go requires users to log in with a username and password. Doing so completely erases your online anonymity, so there’s little point in using Tor in the first place.\n\nLastly, Tor exit nodes are public, so websites, apps, and streaming services all know whether or not you’re using Tor, even if they don’t know your identity. Many sites block access to connections from Tor nodes, and even if Sky Go doesn’t block you entirely, expect to go through a lot more CAPTCHAs to get to the site.\n\nHow does Sky Go detect a VPN?\n\nLike many other streaming services, Sky Go uses various techniques to detect and block VPNs to enforce geo-restrictions. Here are some common methods Sky Go may use to detect VPNs:"
