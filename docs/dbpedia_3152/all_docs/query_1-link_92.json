Instructions work in either order:\n\n1 PLUG IT IN\n\n2 POINT AT SKY\n\nStarlink requires an unobstructed view of the sky. Download the Starlink app to determine your best install location.\n\nDownload for androidchevron_rightDownload for iOSchevron_right\n\nLong term contracts prevent both you and Starlink from making sensible changes when necessary. With Starlink, it is a fair deal both ways. Starlink can adjust terms and pricing as needed, and you can cancel at any time, for any reason."
