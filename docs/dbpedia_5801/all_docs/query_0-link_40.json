        "text": "Mine might surprise some of you (specifically those of you who have seen the 4kids anime) but it's Yu-Gi-Oh! It has shit like a guy SKINNING HIS OWN FATHER ALIVE. Even the Japanese version of the anime had to tone things down. It's definitely more violent than the likes of Naruto/One Piece, which is quite an accomplishment considering yugioh is a manga about card games and Naruto and One Piece are action manga.\n\nThe Tommyrod vs. Toriko fight in Toriko is pretty brutal for a shonen series.\n\nJojos Bizarre Adventure though takes the cake. Don't know how it got away with some of the stuff it did. It's not just blood, but really gross imagery like nails and skin being pulled off.\n\nJust a few minor examples\n\nHaikyuu\n\nHaikyuu\n\nHaikyuu\n\nAkame ga Kill and Deadman Wonderland are seinen.\n\nNo they aren't.\n\nThey run in shonen magazines, therefore they are shonen.\n\nAnyways, my answer is JoJo or Hunter x Hunter for modern shonen manga.\n\nI don't think Yu-Gi-Oh! is the most violent Shonen Manga/Anime. I mean there are parts where it gets really dark.\n\nBut it is cool to have more YGO fans.\n\nAkame ga Kill!, Hunter x Hunter, Shingeki no Kyojin, Embalming (from what I remember, its been a while), and Mahou Shoujo of the End. There might be a few more that I'm missing but those are the ones that immediately spring to mind for me.\n\nI don't think anything could topple violence jack.\n\nHow in the fuck was that shounen anyway? Idk.\n\nIm googleing the titles mentioned here for images, and jesus, thats some berserk level of fucked up..\n\nJJBA, Fist of The North Star, and Bastard!! are pretty fucking violent for shonen.\n\nI was gonna say Bastard!!, main character had his body destroyed and was reduced to a head and spinal column for an entire volume from what I remember.\n\nFist of the North Star with all its creative and brutal deaths.\n\nI don't think anything could topple violence jack.\n\nHow in the fuck was that shounen anyway? Idk.\n\nwtf\n\nJust skimming through the 1st chapter, you have brutal deaths, decapitations, intestines, nudes, a trap who got raped, a tiger tongue that suddenly shape into a dick, gangrapes and tortures.\n\nI knew that back in the day shonen were pretty hardcore, but wow\n\nIt is. From the author of Devilman\n\nIt was literally his next manga after Devilman, published in the same magazine - weekly shounen magazine.\n\nFun fact, he's also the guy who created the mecha genre as we know it with Mazinger.\n\nGood times they had."
