In addition, in 2024 there will be a movie and a second season adapting the best arc of the series. It is expected to continue to consolidate itself among the first places in Japan.\n\nOn the other hand, Tokyo卍Revengers with 3,218,117 copies sold, in addition to only having sold a single (and last) volume this year, manages to position itself in ninth place, a good way to withdraw from the Oricon tops, also consolidating itself as Shonen Magazine's best-selling series in the Oricon era.\n\nFor the other series, we will have to give some time while a more complete table is published.\n\nI will place my bet on Shangri - La frontier and Blue Lock as the series that will appear in the magazine in 2024, and I think that Seitokai ni mo ana wa aru! will be the surprise.\n\n--- Double Post Merged, Jan 24, 2024 ---\n\nCirculation of series that were published in 2023\n\nThere may be circulation errors\n\nHajime no Ippo: 100’000.000\n\n*Nanatsu no Taizai / Mokushiroku no Yonkishi: 55’000.000\n\nBlue Lock: 30’000.000\n\nAhiru no Sora: 24’000.000\n\nKanojo, Okarishimasu: 11’100.000\n\nShangri - La Frontier: 6’500.000\n\n**Bakemonogatari: 2’800.000\n\nKanojo mo Kanojo: 2’000.000\n\n**Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru: 1’700.000\n\nMegami no Café Terrace: 1’400.000\n\nKuroiwa Medaka ni Watashi no Kawaii ga Tsujinai: 1’200.000\n\nAmagami - san Chi no Enmusubi: 1’150.000\n\nSeitokai ni mo ana wa aru! 600.000\n\n***Edens Zero: 250.000\n\nKanan sama ha Akuma Choroi: 200.000\n\n***Kakkou no linazuke: 100.000\n\nIf other series published in the magazine do not appear here, it is because their circulations have not yet been published until the moment this thread was made.\n\n*Mokushiroku no Yonkishi, being the sequel of NnT, has not revealed its circulation separately but rather together, for this reason I put them together until there are separate figures.\n\n** Bakemonogatari and Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru are out of circulation until their last volume, I haven't found them or they haven't been revealed yet.\n\n***Edens Zero and Kakkou no linazuke only have figures for their first volumes, more information has not been revealed to date.\n\n--- Double Post Merged, Jan 24, 2024 ---\n\nWSM Historical Circulation until 2023\n\nUnlike last year, this year there was only one big change in the top part of historical circulations of WSM magazine, Nanatsu no Taizai surpassed Daiya no Ace, Tsurikichi Sanpei, Shoot!, GTO and Devilman.
