Each month your intrepid hosts Zach Wilkerson, Emily Myers, and Walter Richardson will pick a new series to discuss, usually focusing on the first few volumes. It’s like the old Manga Club, but for your ears! But that’s not all: each month we will also discuss the past month’s worth of chapters in various ongoing series we are currently reading, usually those running in Weekly Shonen Jump. Our eighteenth book club pick is “Devilman” by Go Nagai. Join us next month for a discussion of “Tomie” by Junji Ito.\n\nFollow our hosts on Twitter, @wilkerfox and @cosmosofcourse."
