        "text": "First off, there has to my knowledge only been one Devilman game created thus far, from way back in 2000\n\nWith the possible resurgence of the franchise, gaining new traction and life thanks to Devilman Crybaby (especially outside of Japan), it makes me wonder if in the future we may see a game or two that takes the series back into the game world. (And yes, Devilman Crybaby is recommended as a watch, if nothing else than for the amazing OST)\n\nFor those who don't know, Devilman is a dark and brutal series (surprisingly published as \"Shounen\", not \"Seinen\" back in 1972) where a young man named Akira merges with a Demon Champion named Amon, and is able to retain his \"humanity\" despite gaining a demon body. Akira then must face a growing apocalypse as more demons surface and cause havoc across the world amidst other personal crisis among friends and family.\n\nIt was (and still is) a very provocative story and is very dark and depressing, with glimmers of hope and humanity sporadically littered within. And it was also very influential to other creators as well. Kentaro Miura, the author of Berserk has stated he was inspired to create Berserk thanks to Devilman, and that his own series' antagonist was very much modeled after the villain of Devilman. And Evangelion Director Hideaki Anno was also similarly inspired by the franchise, especially the Ending.\n\nSo, if there was to be a game based on the franchise, which developers, directors and such would you wish to try and taken on this kind of material?\n\nI suppose I'll throw out the obvious (for me anyway) choice first.\n\nYoko Taro and Platinum Games\n\nTo me it would seem to be a match made in heaven, or hell in this case. Taro is of course, a master of delivering stories that are depressing, emotional and poignant, while having also nailed the development of characters that are fundamentally \"flawed\" and in some cases, purely awful (his Drakengard \"protagonist\" cast of incestuous siblings, a demented unrequited lover, a pedophile and a baby eater will likely never be topped), so I'm sure he could do wonders with a violence and sex-crazed non-human protagonist. If you wanted someone to really capture the essence and depressing themes of Devilman, I could think of no other creative in the industry I'd trust other than Taro to successfully pull it off with the execution in direction that it would need.\n\nPlatinum Games I believe would work well for the combat, which would likely need to be a very fast and brutal hand-to-hand system with lots of gore and dismemberment. And of course the fact that they're the only competent developer that Taro has had success in working with (though granted, I'm sure some of his past devs would have been more competent had S*** SquareEnix given them the money).\n\nWhat are your picks?\n\nI think a Devilman could work but maybe not Crybaby itself. They need to take liberties for it to work. Set the game\n\nnear the end of the manga and have Akira going around finding other Devilmen for the final battle with satan\n\nand along the way he could combine with other demons for new abilities, think Mega Man. The game should be open world with\n\nyou running into other human groups that became cultists or bandits.\n\nAnother way they could do it is base it one the Devilman vs Hades manga but without Mazinger Z.\n\nUltimatly I feel that Violence Jack is much more fiting as a game. Going around as Jack and finding humans and helping/killing then in the post apocalypse is very \"videogamey\" and could provide tons of material to work with. There is also the Devilman ties that could be very hype at the end.\n\nThe OP nailed it with Platinum and Yoko Taro combination. If VJ or Devilman game were to happen then It should be them doing it."
