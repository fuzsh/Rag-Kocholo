        "text": "Characters\n\nReviews\n\nThis manga was way ahead of it's time, Like I'm honestly in awe at how Nagai Go sensei managed to make a story as unique and captivating as he did back in 1972, which stands the test of time and is still such a brilliant piece of media to this day.\n\nI'll highlight some things about this manga. First and foremost, It is some of the most brutal and grotesque stuff you'll ever read/see so be warned if you can't stomach that stuff. It has ALOT of gore and nudity.\n\nThe art is really unique and quirky and has a certain feel to it. It's extremely edgy ... both in the literal and figurative sense. A very raw feel is emanated from the art and it certainly compliments the story well.\n\nThe story was amazing, The twist was amazing too. Obviously I won't spoil it but you won't see it coming if you're going into this blind. The ending was also a great one imo, It tied up all loose ends in a beautiful yet tragic manner. No complaints there.\n\nAll in all, This was definitely one of my most memorable reads and I think it deserves all the praise it gets. It certainly is an influential piece of art that inspired many others and perhaps even inspired many anime/manga which have been released over the years.\n\nDefinitely give this a shot if you don't mind gore and nudity because what awaits you is something truly surreal even by today's standards.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI absolutely love the 80s OVA’s as well as Devilman: Crybaby. Both are fantastic in their own ways, but I had never read the manga.\n\nAt first my impressions were not great. Early on the art is rather basic and very flat to the point it’s very unappealing. Even for manga from the early 70’s the art is just a bit jarring. It was a bit of a chore to get through the first chapter and honestly it’s poorly paced and a bit disconnected with the plot and pacing. By the second chapter things become a bit more clear and more coherent, but still a ... bit messy. Good news though the art really starts to improve a lot more by the end of chapter two going into the third chapter as well as much better pacing.\n\nAt this point things start to go really off the rails as we suddenly just start time traveling visiting iconic figures of history. I’m not really going to get into details, because honestly it all felt like filler and a waste of time that added little to nothing to the story then going on a time travel adventure. The context of all of this really does nothing to really add much of the overall story in general. We eventually get back to the world of Devilman, but at this point I really felt bored and honestly was struggling finishing this.\n\nAt this point I feel no engagement towards any of this story at this point. It isn’t until chapter 15 where things start to get interesting again. The problem is after 10 chapters of nonsense I really don't care what happens. Without getting into major spoilers, but we lose a main character and it is some of the best writing of the series up to this point and it really feels very emotional and tragic. Unfortunately it all ends on a more down and sour note after that with not much of a conclusion.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the story but very disjointed, and rather sloppy writing at times.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI did not finish this manga and I do not intend to. I really enjoyed the anime on Netflix so I decided to read the story and it was just not good. There are some alright elements to this story but I think the likable characters are doing all of the heavy lifting. By the time I got to the end of the first volume and they were with Hitler and then with Joan of Arc I really just got sick of the story. Having the anime in mind and knowing what they did in the limited amount of episodes also makes me realize just ... how much fat can be cut from the series. If you're wondering whether to do the show or the anime I recommend the show!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for November\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for November Week 1: November 6 - 12 Anime Releases Black Clover Part 2 Blu-ray & DVD Combo Galaxy Angel Z...read more\n\nNov 5, 2018 2:27 PM by Sakana-san | Discuss (7 comments)\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for May\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for May Week 1: May 1 - 7 Anime Releases Atom: The Beginning Complete Collection Blu-ray Ayakashi Complete Col...read more\n\nApr 30, 2018 3:26 AM by Sakana-san | Discuss (3 comments)\n\nRecent Forum Discussion\n\nPoll: Devilman Chapter 20 Discussion\n\ngknight - Jun 26, 2013 16 repliesby Biisoo »»\n\nMay 18, 3:19 PM Poll: Devilman Chapter 1 Discussion\n\naccela - May 7, 2008 6 repliesby Biisoo »»\n\nMay 17, 1:33 PM Any SFW version of Devilman???\n\nltarget - Jan 30, 2018 16 repliesby 24846 »»\n\nMar 2, 2023 4:32 AM anime or manga\n\nh6n65b65hb65 - Aug 31, 2021 4 repliesby miblan »»\n\nJan 29, 2023 1:21 PM The 53 chapter situation\n\nShadowMonkey - Jan 31, 2018 6 repliesby 1000yearofdeath_ »»\n\nMay 29, 2022 12:34 PM"
