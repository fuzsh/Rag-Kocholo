        "text": "Index\n\nPart I: Introduction; History, plot and a general review (no spoilers)\n\nPart II: Comment and Interpretation (spoilers)\n\nPart III: Other appearances in mangas and videogames (updated on 4 January 2019)\n\nUpdate notes: Wew! It’s been a long time since I updated this page…the previous update is dated 6 August 2012! I’ve added some brief infos for the official English release of Devilman (2018), Devilman vs Hades crossover (2012), the still ongoing Devilman Saga (started in 2014) and some infos for the upcoming Super Robot Wars DD mobile game which will feature Devilman and will be released in 2019.\n\nNOTE\n\nDevilman never got a proper english edition, the\n\nonly english edition is a japanese bilingual print done in Kodansha in\n\n2002. However, Devilman has been fully scanlated and can be easily found\n\non the net. Not true anymore. Following maybe the great success of the Netflix ‘s Devilman Crybaby anime serie (2018), Devilman has been fully translated and officially released in English in May 2018 by Seven Seas editions, in a two volume edition! It has took a while, but now there is an official English translation for it too! In this part of the article, I’ve focused my attention on mangas and videogames. I haven’t included any OAV, movie, books, etc in it for now. Maybe I’ll do that on a second time.\n\nYou can find the Nagai’s memories about Devilman which I’ve mentioned earlier in the article here\n\nMANGA\n\nAmon\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? Yes\n\nThis is a six volumes Devilman’s spin-off conceived by Yu Kinutani.\n\nIt’s events take place before the very final part of Devilman. This work\n\ndiffers from Devilman in various aspects, the characters in particular\n\nare charaterized in a very different way.\n\nCyber Devilman\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? No\n\nThis is a very obscure work. It’s not even sure that it has been\n\nbrought to completion. I’ve found a couple of pics of it online. It\n\nshould be a retelling of the Devilman story in a sort of cyberpunk\n\nsetting using CG graphics only, created by Tamotsu Shinohara. If you\n\nhave more info about this, please contact me.\n\nDemon Knight\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? No\n\nThis is a short spin-off for Devilman, taking the reader back to the\n\nera before humanity, when demons ruled the Earth. It has been published\n\non the Comic Morning magazine in 2009.\n\nDevilman Grimoire / Devilman G\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? Yes\n\nA brand new Devilman manga by Rui Takato. It has been published first on Champion RED and later collected in a five volume edition, which are also available in English, published by the Seven Seas editions, the same ones who published the official translation of the original Devilman manga. Devilman G has an “easier” and relaxed approach to the story: for example, Miki now is a some sort of shojo witch! Personally I haven’t liked it a lot.\n\nDevilman Lady\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? Yes\n\nThis monumental work (17 volumes) is Devilman’s true sequel and\n\ninheritor. It starts as telling what would have happened if the role of\n\nDevilman was been taken by a woman, and then develops in a very complex\n\nway, intervining with the storyline of a lot of Nagai’s works. The plot\n\nis very complex and full of twists and turns and has a very strong\n\nphilosophical side in it. This work in some way draws an entire universe\n\nfor a lot of the Nagai’s works. Be warned tough: Devilman Lady is also\n\nfull of violence and sex, so it’s not for everyone. Because of it’s\n\ncomplexity, maybe I’ll write an article about it. It also contains\n\nanother mini Devilman spin-off, Devilman Ghost.\n\nDevilman Mokushiroku – Strange Days\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? Yes (scanlated)\n\nThis volume is a spin-off of Amon. Again, like Amon, it’s authored by Yu Kinutani.\n\nDevilman Saga (ongoing)\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? Yes\n\nStarted in 2014 by Nagai himself and still ongoing, Devilman Saga aims to be the final chapter after Devilman and Devilman Lady in the franchise. Starring Yuki Fudo, a robotic professor and enterpeneur (and married with Miki!), and set in 2025, the manga follows the adventures of Fudo in discovering the mysteries of the Demon Armours, a set of sort of ancient bio-armors which first seek and then bond with their wielders, discovered by Ryo Asuka, a childhood friend of Fudo who later turned out to focus on weapon research. For now (January 2019) eight volumes have been published and the serie is still ongoing: the manga is quite ambitious and take a slower pace focusing more on the characters and touching many questions, like AI, the nature of war, etc in the classic Nagai fashion. The serie is quite original and unpredictable, I’m liking it a lot and I am very curious to see how it will develop!\n\nDevilman vs Getter Robot\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? Yes\n\nA very nice one-volume spin-off, done in a vein similar of the one of the Mazinger Vs Devilman movie.\n\nThe Demon empire allies with the Getter’s Dinosaur empire to conquer\n\nEarth. During Akira’s and Miki visit to the Getter’s base (Miki and\n\nGetter’s Mikiru are friends), the demons attack. The Getter team fights\n\nthe demons without knowing about Akira’s real identity, but in order to\n\nface the threat Devilman and Getter will be forced to cooperate with\n\neach other.\n\nDevilman vs Hades\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? Yes\n\nA 2012 Devilman and Mazinger Z (the new one, Mazinger Edition Z: The Impact / Shin Mazinger Impact Z, dated 2009) crossover in three volumes to celebrate the 40 years of both the Mazinger and Devilman franchises. Honestly I haven’t liked it much, I found it to be quite confusing and not of great interest. However, it’s not terrible either. It’s available in English officially by the Seven Seas editions, like the original Devilman manga and Devilman G / Grimoire.\n\nDynamic Heroes\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? No\n\nThis work is an homage to all the popular super robots by Nagai.\n\nDevilman (TV version) and Cutey Honey are in there too, along with other\n\nNagai’s characters.\n\nGekiman\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? No\n\nGekiman is an autobiography of Nagai. It speaks about and examines a\n\nlot of his works, and of course it spends a lot of time on Devilman,\n\nwith some nice trivias and alternative ideas for it. When the article\n\nwas written (August 2011) Gekiman is still in the works in Japan.\n\nMazinsaga\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? No\n\nIn this beautiful cyberpunk rendition of Mazinger Z (with a lot of\n\nhorror and sci-fi overtones), sadly unfinished, there are some Devilman\n\ncharacters. Nagai himself planned to give them more space in the comic,\n\nin fact one of the Devilman’s characters should have had a central role\n\nin it, but the project was terminated before completion.\n\nNeo Devilman\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? No\n\nA three volumes collection of short stories regarding the Devilman’s\n\nuniverse written and drawn by Nagai and other authors. It features a\n\nDevilman Lady spin-off too, Devilman in the Dark.\n\nShin Devilman\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? Yes\n\nA collection of five short spin off stories situated in the central\n\npart of Devilman. The first one of them, situated in a pre-WW II\n\nAustria, is a truly masterpiece, the others are nice but don’t add or\n\nsubtract nothing to the main opera. Part of it was colored and published\n\nin the USA by Glenn Danzig’s Verotika.\n\nSiren Tanjo Hen\n\nTranslated / Scanlated? No\n\nA short spin-off focused on the origins of the demoness Silene from the original Devilman.\n\nViolence Jack\n\nTranslated / Scanlated ? Partially (some stories)\n\nThis is maybe the longest and most ambitious Nagai’s work ever. In a\n\npost-apocalyptic Japan, the comic shows the adventures of many\n\nsurvivors, all of them linked by the figure of Violence Jack, a\n\nmysterious man wielding an enourmous Jack knife. When he appears,\n\nviolence and chaos starts, bringing death and destruction. The opera is\n\nvery complex and has more or less all the major Nagai’s character in it,\n\nincluding Devilman’s characters.\n\nVIDEOGAMES\n\nCB Chara Wars (SNES)\n\nTranslated ? No\n\nA super deformed (small bodies with big heads) beat ‘em up game\n\nsituated in the CB Nagai world. Player 1 takes the role of Devilman,\n\nplayer 2 plays as Mazinger Z. A lot of other Nagai’s characters like\n\nGetter Robot, Dr Hell, Cutey Honey and others appear here.\n\nDevilman (NES)\n\nTranslated ? Yes (patch)\n\nAn action-adventure game covering the events of Devilman. There are multiple endings available.\n\nDevilman (PSX)\n\nTranslated ? No\n\nA survival horror (in the first part) / action (in the later part of\n\nthe game) covering the first half of Devilman events. Atmospheric and\n\nvery gory, it’s maybe the best game ever done on Devilman, give it a\n\nchance. Thanks to the FAQ posted on Gamefaqs, it’s perfectly playable\n\neven without knowing Japanese.\n\nDevilman Pachinko Slot\n\nTranslated? No\n\nSlot machine with Devilman characters. The various stages are portrayed as battles between Devilman and other villians.\n\nLegend of Dynamic Goushouden Houkai no Rondo (GBA)\n\nTranslated ? No\n\nA very nice RPG for the GBA featuring a lot of Nagai’s characters\n\nlike Cutey Honey, Devilman, Violence Jack and Getter Robot. Let’s hope\n\nfor a translation…\n\nSunday vs Magazine: Shuuketsu! Choujou Daikessen! (PSP)\n\nTranslated ? No\n\nA fighting game for the PSP featuring various famous manga and anime\n\ncharacters like Casshern, Ashita no Joe and, of course, Devilman (manga\n\nversion).\n\nSuper Erect Taisen SEX (PC-98)\n\nTranslated ? No\n\nA spoof of the Super Robot Taisen / War saga. The engine and the\n\ngraphics are very similar to the ones used in the Saturn’s Super Robot\n\nTaisens. Some Nagai characters appears here, like Dororon Enma Kun and\n\nDevilman. Watch out for Devilman’s villians, they are STRONG.\n\nSuper Robot Wars DD (iOS/Android) (not released yet)\n\nTranslated ? No\n\nA new chapter in the very well known (at least in Japan) and estabilished Super Robot Wars saga, which origins are back in 1991 and the Game Boy system. Not much is known at the moment, only that it will feature Devilman in it and that the game will be released in 2019 in Japan for smartphones.\n\nThe Night Before Armageddon\n\nTranslated ? No"
