        "text": "a while ago these translations were posted on twitter. you may have seen them already, but if not, here you go! twitter user rebanadadepera is the original translator and you can check out the original post on twitter here! this translation is posted here by the translator’s request. this translation is also available in spanish.\n\nThe first excerpt comes from the book 「永井豪の世界」 (“Go Nagai’s World”) which was published back in 1978.\n\nThis one was already translated around two years ago into English so it’s very possible it’s already familiar for a lot of people. However, it was a quick translation and not as complete, and is also not available anymore. In it is written:\n\nGo Nagai: Around the third volume, I came to think for the first time “Isn’t this Satan…?” Certainly, in no way I was expecting such large-scale destruction…\n\nInterviewer: That part of the manga is quite spontaneous. ‘Devilman’, as Go Nagai’s work, stands out thanks to its vigor and acceleration; it’s impactful right until the end. And Satan, being androgynous…\n\nGo Nagai: Satan’s depicted as a being with both masculine and feminine characteristics.\n\nInterviewer: It’s quite the beautiful depiction. And, despite being enemies, Devilman and Satan had something more than just a friendship. When I was reading through ‘Devilman’, I was thinking, “isn’t this actually a love story?”\n\nGo Nagai: Right. Readers have asked me if ‘Devilman’ is a love story. “Yes, it is”, I replied *laughs*.\n\nInterviewer: When love grows too passionate, there’s the possibility that it can destroy you and your partner. And in this case, even humanity was caught up in this (…).\n\nThe second excerpt comes from the book 「世界の終わりと始まりに-漫画家永井豪創作の秘密-」 or “From the beginning to the end – the secrets of the creations of manga artist Go Nagai”, which was published back in 2003. In it is written:\n\nGo Nagai: For ‘Devilman’, my intention was to go in the opposite way of the Bible, so that everything would return to nothing. That’s how I wanted to finish the manga. However [while drawing it] I ran out of pages so I had to finish it like I did. And with that people began to appear interpreting the author’s intention in a different way than the original [the one I pretended] was, so I was left wondering if that way of finishing it was a good idea *laughs*. I pondered in if it was possible an author could have a way of finishing where he doesn’t decided if this or that is of this way or that other way.\n\nInterviewer: Satan is someone with both male and female characteristics, and you can feel there’s more than friendship between Devilman and Satan.\n\nGo Nagai: Right. I’ve been asked by the readers “doesn’t ‘Devilman’ become a love story eventually?”, and I answered that’s what it is *laughs*. This is why the human race goes to decay - because it is quite the inconvenient love story *laughs*.\n\nGo Nagai: While I was drawing Miki’s death I thought “She has become weak, she’s going to die…”, but I think in the end she was just a victim of that love between Devilman and Satan.\n\nAnd now it’s time for translator’s notes:\n\nThe paragraph about the “destructive love” it’s cut in half in the Japanese version, and I don’t own the book so I can’t provide of more information. This is why the last sentence ends as abruptly as I don’t want to mess things up by trying to deduce what comes next.\n\nAbout that eternal debate on Satan’s gender and how to call him: the word used to define Satan both here and in the manga is 両性生物, however it is more of a compound rather than a single word.\n\nI know there’s people using ‘intersex’ or ‘hermaphrodite’, the former is common on Wikipedia/fan discussions, and the later coming from the fan translation. As there’s no official English TL and is not using any of the forms that are usually used for both terms I decided to just change the way the sentence is written to convey the same meaning. On the Internet, almost all the results for 両性生物 are about ‘Devilman’.\n\nGo Nagai’s comment about how catastrophic the manga ended up and how it surprised him it’s akin to similar commentaries, such like in his short autobiographical manga where he says there ‘some kind of unseen force bearing over everything’ and he often ‘fell into a trance’ while drawing ‘Devilman’. He also comments on Ryo and Satan being one in the same wasn’t planned, just like the first excerpt seems to imply (that sentence is also cut out in the original). (source 1) (source 2)\n\n-About Devilman being a love story it seems to be a reoccurring topic. The most recent mention would be in a magazine released the past month.\n\nWhile it talks about ‘Devilman Crybaby’ and is not really relevant in this discussion, it once again talks about how the original ‘Devilman’ manga is a story of love between those two: “With a full adaptation (完全映像化) of the original Devilman, which can be called ‘a love story between Fudou Akira and Asuka Ryou’ (…)” (image source)\n\nAbout Go Nagai and the Bible - this is further explained in ‘Gekiman!’ so I’ll make a summary of some pages to explain it.\n\nIn ‘Gekiman!’ Go Nagai speaks about the situation he was in while he was drawing the ending of ‘Devilman’. He was running out of pages to express what he wanted to, he couldn’t postpone it, and he was at his limits. He just had 15 pages left to conclude the story.\n\nHe keeps talking about how the Bible begins with “let there be light” - that is, the creation. There’s a God able to create life. But he can do the opposite, which is erasing life. (This conversation has some similarities to the one Satomi and Jun have during Devilman Lady.) That’s what he meant with his intention being going “the opposite way of the Bible, so that everything would return to nothing”.\n\nLater, Go Nagai talks about how the true winner is not the humans, not the demons, and not the devilmen: it’s God. This is because all the life on Earth vanishes. Drawing it like this, Nagai felt that he could make the reader see how terrible and meaningless wars are. In this way, the central theme of Devilman would be a warning. That’s how the antiwar message was born.\n\n“It was for this reason. It’s my mission to tell as many people as I can how there are no victories in war, and to do it through this work”, he says, still worrying if he’ll be able to do such a thing. It should be noted that God’s character is similar in ‘Mao Dante’, considered a prototype for ‘Devilman.’\n\nThe next is something I don’t know if Go Nagai has said in ‘Gekiman!’ (I didn’t read everything before writing this down because understanding everything would take me a lot of time), but God making everyone fight each other for his own benefit, confusing them, or not moving a single finger to stop them before the tragic outcome, always made me wonder if it wouldn’t be a metaphor for those third parties who get their best from wars, selling weapons, trying to get the merits after stepping in the middle after it’s over, etc. Go Nagai drew ‘Devilman’ during the Cold War, and he listened “through the testimonies and the stories of people around” about the horrors of wars. (source) Reading through this only reassures me more in that…\n\nand that’s the full translation and notes! as a reminder i did not translate or edit this, but i am still familiar with the material and can answer questions and make corrections if needed. (if you see any errors, please point them out. the translator has requested this as well!)"
