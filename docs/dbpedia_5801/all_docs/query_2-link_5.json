        "text": "00:07\n\nANIME MANGA EXPLOSION.\n\n00:12\n\nDouble piton.\n\n00:15\n\n\"UFO ROBOT GRENDIZER RAIDS\" began airing in France in 1978 and became so popular it made the news.\n\n00:25\n\nIts popularity hit Europe and the Middle East, introducing the world to Japanese robot anime.\n\n00:33\n\nBreast Fire!\n\n00:37\n\n\"Mazinger Z\" was the first anime featuring human-piloted robots.\n\n00:43\n\nIt became a hit in Spain in 1978 and quickly spread to other Spanish-speaking countries.\n\n00:53\n\nThese influential robot anime were based on manga by Nagai Go.\n\n01:00\n\nNagai has released over 180 works across his 57-year-long career.\n\n01:07\n\nHe also pioneered multi-media entertainment with his work on anime adaptations.\n\n01:16\n\nThe French government recognized him with a cultural medal.\n\n01:21\n\nGlobal audiences will enjoy my work\n\nas long as I value the fantasy inside me.\n\n01:30\n\nIn \"Devilman,\" a Japanese dark fantasy milestone,\n\n01:34\n\nNagai shocked readers with imagery considered taboo at the time.\n\n01:40\n\nHumanity is cruel.\n\n01:43\n\nWhat's wrong with showing that in manga\n\nwhen reality is far worse?\n\n01:49\n\nWhat is the driving force behind Nagai's creativity?\n\n01:54\n\nJoin us as we go inside the artistry of Nagai Go,\n\n01:58\n\nthe legendary creator whose manga and anime continue to inspire the world.\n\n02:11\n\nThis is Nagai's workspace, located in Tokyo.\n\n02:19\n\nOriginal merchandise covers the room.\n\n02:25\n\nOn his desk, a variety of pens.\n\n02:33\n\n78-year-old Nagai continues to release works in weekly and monthly magazines.\n\n02:42\n\nHere, he is inking his weekly serialization.\n\n02:56\n\nAfter graduating high school in 1964, Nagai decided to become a manga artist.\n\n03:01\n\nHe started by visiting publishers with original works.\n\n03:06\n\nFor the first two years,\n\nI brought original works to publishers.\n\n03:13\n\nBut it didn't lead to anything.\n\n03:19\n\nA fateful meeting turned things around for Nagai.\n\n03:25\n\nHe was able to meet manga artist Ishinomori Shotaro.\n\n03:31\n\nIshinomori was a popular manga artist who released nationwide hits like \"Kamen Rider\" and \"Cyborg 009.\"\n\n03:41\n\nI showed him my rejected manuscripts.\n\n03:46\n\nUnlike the publishers, he told me\n\nmy works were already complete.\n\n03:52\n\nAnd he congratulated me for creating\n\nmanga and stories that felt brand new.\n\n03:59\n\nAbout two weeks later, I received a call\n\nfrom Ishinomori's assistant.\n\n04:04\n\n\"We're in trouble and need your help.\"\n\n04:07\n\nOnce I went to assist Ishinomori-sensei,\n\nI never left.\n\n04:13\n\nBefore he knew it, Nagai had become Ishinomori's assistant.\n\n04:19\n\nThere, the young artist learned how to create manga directly from a master.\n\n04:24\n\nIshinomori-sensei creates\n\nsuch soft lines.\n\n04:29\n\nI learned that he draws\n\nwith the pen at a very low angle.\n\n04:38\n\nAnd he drew so fast!\n\nI copy his style when I'm in a rush.\n\n04:46\n\nBut assisting a manga legend was not easy.\n\n04:51\n\nWe were so busy we might only\n\nget one day off a month.\n\n04:57\n\nWhen I did have a day off,\n\nI drew original sci-fi manga,\n\n05:02\n\nbut never had enough time to finish them.\n\n05:08\n\nThat busy schedule led to Nagai changing his approach to manga.\n\n05:14\n\nI figured I could draw faster\n\nwith a comedic manga.\n\n05:18\n\nI was right.\n\nThe more I drew, the more ideas came.\n\n05:26\n\nIn 1967, Nagai made his debut with a one-shot manga.\n\n05:33\n\nSoon after, he was selected for a weekly magazine serialization.\n\n05:39\n\nThe comedy is about a swordsman and the women he tries to woo.\n\n05:44\n\n- Here's a kiss to say sorry.\n\n- You don't have to...\n\n05:49\n\nHuh? Housewives, check this out!\n\nUnbelievable suction power!\n\n05:55\n\nAlthough it was a success, one major manga artist contacted Nagai with concern.\n\n06:02\n\nA veteran comedic manga artist told me,\n\n\"You must not draw cruel things.\"\n\n06:06\n\nAnd, \"Works for children\n\nmust not contain sexual affairs.\"\n\n06:12\n\nHe even told the publisher\n\nto drop my manga.\n\n06:20\n\nThis solidified something inside of Nagai.\n\n06:23\n\nFrom my perspective,\n\nit proved I was on his level\n\n06:29\n\nand he viewed me as a rival.\n\n06:33\n\nI decided to create what I wanted\n\nregardless of what others said.\n\n06:40\n\nNagai incorporated elements new to the comedic manga genre, like love scenes and sword fights.\n\n06:50\n\nThe novelty of his work led to more and more offers.\n\n06:54\n\n- Are you awake, Jigoku-chan?\n\n- A good morning kiss.\n\n07:00\n\nNatsume Fusanosuke has been studying Japanese manga history for 40 years.\n\n07:07\n\nHe has released 18 books about manga, including Nagai's works.\n\n07:15\n\nNatsume says that Nagai's comedic sense was outstanding.\n\n07:21\n\nHis works were all over the place.\n\nHe did whatever he wanted.\n\n07:28\n\nHe had great comedic sense\n\nand crazy ideas.\n\n07:34\n\nHis ability to go completely beyond\n\nexpectations is quite incredible.\n\n07:41\n\nA serious scene\n\nwould suddenly become slapstick.\n\n07:46\n\nThe gap between those extremes\n\nmade it funny.\n\n07:52\n\nIt was fun to look at the world\n\nfrom an upside-down perspective.\n\n07:59\n\nLooking at the world upside down.\n\n08:01\n\nThat mindset led to \"Shameless School.\"\n\n08:09\n\nGreedy and self-centered teachers cause trouble for the school students.\n\n08:16\n\nThe comedy depicts the outrageous antics of these eccentric teachers and their students.\n\n08:25\n\nThe students use extreme measures to combat their bizarre teachers.\n\n08:30\n\nFeels so good!\n\n08:36\n\n- The final launch!\n\n- Soaring to the heavens feels pretty good!\n\n08:42\n\nAt the time, teachers were\n\nat the top of the school hierarchy.\n\n08:48\n\nI turned that upside down\n\nand put them at the bottom.\n\n08:56\n\nTeachers and parents denounced \"Shameless School\" as having a negative impact on education.\n\n09:07\n\nUndeterred, Nagai continued to release new episodes.\n\n09:12\n\nWith manga, you don't need to say\n\nwhat can and can't happen. It's fantasy.\n\n09:19\n\nI have a rule that everything can exist\n\nbecause I am creating a fictional world.\n\n09:30\n\nNagai's stance of not bowing down to pressure increased his popularity even further.\n\n09:40\n\nAfter finding huge success with comedic manga, Nagai turned his focus to science fiction in the 1970s.\n\n09:49\n\nHe eventually released his masterpiece, \"Devilman.\"\n\n09:54\n\n\"Devilman\" remains popular to this day.\n\n09:56\n\nThe latest exhibition was in 2023.\n\n10:00\n\nFans from not only Japan but also from around the world attended the event.\n\n10:10\n\nI find it something that is very true is very disturbing.\n\n10:14\n\nAnd he also does it in a way that he confronts the issue rather than trying to avoid it.\n\n10:21\n\n\"Devilman\" is considered the originator of the dark fantasy manga genre and has 50 million copies in print.\n\n10:30\n\nMain character Fudo Akira merges with a demon to battle against a demon invasion.\n\n10:39\n\nHe becomes \"Devilman,\" fighting for the survival of the human race.\n\n10:51\n\nIn the past, shonen manga were expected to have happy endings.\n\n10:57\n\nAll you humans, go to hell!!\n\n10:58\n\nHowever, Nagai depicted the folly of humanity, going so far as to show its destruction.\n\n11:06\n\nAnno Hideaki, director of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion,\" discussed \"Devilman's\" influence in his book.\n\n11:14\n\nMy tastes are built on Nagai Go.\n\nI cannot understate the impact\n\n\"Devilman\" had on me.\n\n11:21\n\nDenying that impact would overturn\n\nthe very foundation my life is built on.\n\n11:29\n\nIt starts off with\n\ndemons as the enemies,\n\n11:33\n\nbut by the end,\n\nthe real enemy is humanity itself.\n\n11:36\n\nIt completely turned the structure\n\nof justice and evil on its head.\n\n11:46\n\nIt was a turning point\n\nfor shonen manga.\n\n11:54\n\n\"Devilman\" is known for its large, striking panels.\n\n11:59\n\nThe art looks like it scatters all over.\n\n12:04\n\nThat style was rare before \"Devilman,\"\n\nbut it quickly became the trend.\n\n12:15\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the thick outlines around the fists and body.\n\n12:23\n\nNagai used a unique method of drawing.\n\n12:32\n\nShaved bamboo is great\n\nfor drawing thick lines.\n\n12:39\n\nI also use Japanese brushes.\n\n12:44\n\nI test out different methods\n\nsearching for the strongest lines.\n\n12:53\n\nUnsatisfied with existing tools, Nagai created brushes that fit his style.\n\n13:07\n\nThe secrets behind the birth of \"Devilman\" can be found in this notebook.\n\n13:17\n\nThis is the notebook for \"Devilman Saga,\" one of Nagai's serialized works.\n\n13:22\n\nIt features character designs and simple details.\n\n13:26\n\nJust the basic details.\n\n13:31\n\nOnce those are set,\n\nI make up the rest as I go.\n\n13:38\n\nAfter creating a rough background for the characters, Nagai goes straight to drawing.\n\n13:43\n\nNo storyboarding.\n\n13:47\n\nThis the same method he used to create \"Devilman.\"\n\n13:52\n\nNagai's unique approach to manga made this possible.\n\n13:58\n\nI get into the character\n\nlike an actor would.\n\n14:01\n\nI can become anything, from a young girl\n\nto a middle-aged man.\n\n14:06\n\nI'm good at switching characters.\n\n14:11\n\nActing as the characters helps Nagai come up with surprising storylines.\n\n14:17\n\nIf I get surprised when unexpected\n\ncharacters do unexpected things,\n\n14:23\n\nthe reader will, too.\n\n14:27\n\nIt's quite simple.\n\n14:30\n\nAnother iconic character is Akira's best friend, Asuka Ryo.\n\n14:37\n\nAsuka Ryo tells Akira about the demons and fights beside him.\n\n14:44\n\nHowever, Nagai changed the character during serialization.\n\n14:50\n\nAsuka Ryo was dominating the story.\n\n14:54\n\nAkira was the main character\n\nbut I felt Ryo was stronger.\n\n15:03\n\nThat's why I turned Asuka Ryo into Satan.\n\n15:07\n\nAfter realizing the magnitude of Asuka Ryo's presence, Nagai made the character betray the hero.\n\n15:15\n\nThat wasn't planned.\n\n15:18\n\nNear the end, I realized it would be fun\n\nto make him Satan.\n\n15:25\n\nDuring its serialized run, Nagai shifted the story's focus to the darkness of the human mind.\n\n15:34\n\nThis can be seen during the \"Demon Hunt.\"\n\n15:39\n\nIt's revealed that demons can disguise themselves as humans, causing humans to lose trust in each other.\n\n15:47\n\nWitch! Witch!\n\nYou monster of a witch!\n\n15:53\n\nSoon, the \"Demon Hunt\" leads to humans being killed, including those dear to Akira.\n\n16:10\n\nDevilman was betrayed by the ones he tried to protect.\n\n16:16\n\nIs this...\n\nthe true nature of those humans\n\nI gave my all to protect?\n\n16:23\n\nThe secret isn't that Devilman\n\nis the only one who can transform.\n\n16:31\n\nIt's that any human can transform\n\nand take on demon-like properties.\n\n16:39\n\nA quiet boy suddenly has\n\nthe power to murder.\n\n16:45\n\nIt's the same for someone getting drafted,\n\ngiven a gun, and told to go to war.\n\n16:54\n\nThe manga's extreme depictions were uncommon in the 1970s, so editors and staff opposed its publication.\n\n17:03\n\nBut nothing stopped Nagai.\n\n17:08\n\nHumanity's inherent cruelty\n\nis right there in our history.\n\n17:13\n\nHumans repeat cruelty over and over.\n\n17:17\n\nWhat's wrong with showing that in a manga\n\nwhen reality is far worse?\n\n17:26\n\nIn the final episode, Nagai depicts the result of humanity's folly.\n\n17:33\n\nThe last cut in \"Devilman\" is a two-page spread.\n\n17:39\n\nBalls of light and angelic figures emerge from the horizon.\n\n17:47\n\nThe scene contains Nagai's final message.\n\n17:55\n\nYou know the angels at the end?\n\n18:00\n\nIt's a metaphor for a nuclear explosion.\n\n18:03\n\nThe message is that if we aren't careful,\n\nnuclear war will break out,\n\n18:12\n\nand the world as we know it\n\nwill come to an end.\n\n18:25\n\nRocket Punch!\n\n18:27\n\nPhoton Energy Beam!\n\n18:32\n\nNagai's artistry is not limited to manga, as seen with the anime \"Mazinger Z.\"\n\n18:40\n\nIn the TV anime, the main character, Kabuto Koji, pilots a giant robot against an army of evil robots.\n\n18:50\n\nToys based on the show were huge hits, too.\n\n18:55\n\nThis led to a giant robot anime boom in Japan, sponsored by toy manufacturers.\n\n19:03\n\nNagai Go created\n\nthe giant robot anime genre.\n\n19:10\n\nIt was a more defined genre.\n\n19:15\n\nHe built a market triangle that included\n\nmanga, TV anime, and merchandise.\n\n19:25\n\nNagai's hit ended up creating a market\n\nfor Japanese robot anime.\n\n19:32\n\nNot just manga!\n\n19:35\n\nThis scene from \"Mazinger Z\" was groundbreaking for the robot anime genre.\n\n19:43\n\nPilder, on!\n\n19:51\n\nKids fell in love with the idea of a new type of hero that pilots and fights with robots.\n\n20:03\n\nI grew up with Tezuka Osamu's \"Astro Boy.\"\n\n20:09\n\nI always wanted to create\n\na new robot manga.\n\n20:15\n\nI didn't want to be a copycat,\n\n20:20\n\nso I only made it when I was confident\n\nit was something brand new.\n\n20:27\n\nNagai came up with the idea for \"Mazinger Z\" while he was out on the town.\n\n20:32\n\nI was waiting at a traffic light.\n\n20:36\n\nSuddenly, I imagined an irritated car\n\ngrowing legs and walking over traffic.\n\n20:48\n\nI could visually see it.\n\n20:52\n\nI thought, \"Why don't I make a robot\n\nthat can be controlled like a car?\"\n\n21:01\n\nThis is Nagai's initial design for \"Mazinger Z.\"\n\n21:07\n\nIt originally featured the hero riding a motorcycle and piloting a robot.\n\n21:15\n\nGetting the anime on TV proved difficult.\n\n21:19\n\nAt the time, robot anime\n\nfelt out of date.\n\n21:28\n\nNobody took me seriously\n\nwhen I proposed the idea.\n\n21:51\n\nKatsumata Tomoharu directed the \"Mazinger Z\" anime 52 years ago.\n\n22:03\n\nI had a feeling it would be a hit.\n\n22:07\n\nA young boy piloting a giant robot\n\nwas brand new.\n\n22:14\n\nViewers felt like they were pilots, too.\n\n22:21\n\nThat separated it from other works.\n\n22:27\n\nThis is the color guide for \"Mazinger Z.\"\n\n22:33\n\nNagai based it on Western armor to emphasize the metal material.\n\n22:42\n\nHe also replaced the motorcycle with a hovercraft that could dynamically fly and dock with the robot.\n\n22:52\n\nHowever, the anime was contingent on a manga serialization.\n\n23:00\n\nNagai negotiated for the mixed-media project with publishers directly.\n\n23:06\n\nHe had nothing to lose.\n\n23:08\n\nPublishers never thought about\n\ncollaborating with TV like that.\n\n23:15\n\nManga was manga and TV was TV.\n\nThey were viewed as completely different.\n\n23:21\n\nI desperately tried to convince\n\nthe chief editor\n\n23:26\n\nif he didn't give the okay,\n\nthe anime wouldn't air.\n\n23:33\n\nHe eventually caved in and said,\n\n\"Well, let's try it just once.\"\n\n23:39\n\nNagai's passion persuaded the editorial department.\n\n23:43\n\nThe manga serialization began two months before the anime.\n\n23:49\n\nKatsumata focused his energy into creating realistic, appealing robots.\n\n23:55\n\nThe sense of scale\n\nwas the biggest priority.\n\n24:00\n\nI used low angles and placed objects\n\nto make the robots look bigger.\n\n24:10\n\nThat was the focus.\n\n24:14\n\nNagai's design and Katsumata's team turned \"Mazinger Z\" into a hit anime.\n\n24:20\n\nRatings exceeded 30%, and some toys sold over 700,000 units in one year.\n\n24:29\n\n\"Mazinger Z\" aired in Europe, Central and South America, and the Middle East.\n\n24:34\n\nSpain even created a ten-meter-tall robot statue!\n\n24:40\n\nBwaystarrs, from Oman, became obsessed with \"Mazinger Z\" at the age of 8.\n\n24:47\n\nIn our time, in the 1990s, it was really popular with my friends in childhood.\n\n24:53\n\nNowadays there are so many cartoons, but I keep this one as my favorite.\n\n24:58\n\nIt was exciting for me.\n\n25:00\n\nActually, \"Mazinger\" opened my imagination to the far future.\n\n25:09\n\nNagai continued to work on mixed-media content using manga and anime.\n\n25:16\n\nThe idea of mixed-media projects didn't exist in the 1970s.\n\n25:20\n\nNagai was the only manga artist who could pull it off.\n\n25:26\n\nMost manga artists\n\ndid not listen to sponsor requests.\n\n25:32\n\nBut Nagai was different.\n\n25:36\n\nThe latest \"Mazinger Z\" animated film is in production, 52 years after the series began.\n\n25:43\n\n\"Grendizer U\" is a reboot of \"UFO ROBOT GRENDIZER RAIDS.\"\n\n25:48\n\nNagai's works continue to be loved across generations.\n\n25:57\n\nI can only draw 1/5 of what I used to,\n\nso I want to do more collaborations.\n\n26:02\n\nI want to become a better producer\n\n26:10\n\nand make high-quality works\n\nwith new creators.\n\n26:19\n\nAcross 57 years, Nagai has released over 180 works, and his passion remains undiminished to this day.\n\n26:29\n\nI can't imagine doing anything else.\n\n26:32\n\nEven if I stopped receiving work,\n\nI would still draw manga as a hobby.\n\n26:48\n\nIn 2009, the Nagai Go Memorial Museum\n\nwas built in his hometown.\n\n26:59\n\nJanuary 1, 2024.\n\n27:03\n\nA 7.5-magnitude earthquake\n\nhit Wajima, Ishikawa.\n\n27:09\n\nThe Nagai Go Memorial Museum\n\nburned down.\n\n27:16\n\nJanuary 10, 2024\n\nNagai posted this message on social media:\n\n27:26\n\nI am appalled and heartbroken by the gap\n\nbetween the landscape of my hometown\n\nand the one in my memories.\n\n27:33\n\nAs for the museum, some exhibits\n\nwere probably damaged.\n\n27:39\n\nBut I'm an active manga artist.\n\nEven if some of my work was lost,\n\nI can always create more."
