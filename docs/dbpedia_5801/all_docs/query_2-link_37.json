        "text": "Violence Jack[3] is a Japanese manga, written and illustrated by Go Nagai since 1973 until its conclusion in 1990. It has had several serializations and one-shot stories which have run in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Most of the stories have been compiled in around 38 tankōbon volumes, while a few of them have been published as special tankōbon or have yet to be published in that format. Violence Jack is credited with creating the post-apocalyptic manga and anime genre.\n\nA set of sagas from the manga were adapted in three independent original video animations (OVAs) released in 1986, 1988 and 1990. These OVAs have been released in the United States, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. In some of these countries, the contents of the OVAs have caused censorship issues, while in Australia the second OVA was banned altogether.\n\nThe original manga reuses many concepts and characters from other works by Go Nagai."
