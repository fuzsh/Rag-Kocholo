The synopsis from Crunchyroll reads:\n\n“First year high schooler Midori Asakusa loves anime so much, she insists that “concept is everything” in animation. Though she draws a variety of ideas in her sketchbook, she hasn’t taken the first step to creating anime, insisting that she can’t do it alone. The producer-type Sayaka Kanamori is the first to notice Asakusa’s genius. Then, when it becomes clear that their classmate, charismatic fashion model Tsubame Mizusaki, really wants to be an animator, they create an animation club to realize the “ultimate world” that exists in their minds.”\n\nKeep Your Hands Off Eizouken is available to stream on Crunchyroll.\n\nYurei Deco\n\nYurei Deco is an anime original series that premiered in July 2022.
