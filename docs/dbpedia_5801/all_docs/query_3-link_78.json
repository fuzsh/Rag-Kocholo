        "text": "Devilman was a Manga and Anime series that combined superhero tropes with supernatural horror. It was made by the famous Japanese author Go Nagai in the 1970s. It became enormously popular and influential in Japan; it was later adapted in the form of a OVA and Live Action Movie. There was even an animated Crossover movie where Devilman met another of Nagai's famous creations, Mazinger Z.\n\nThe story involves a boy named Akira, who discoverers the Earth is being invaded by demons. His friend Ryo convinces him that the only way to stop the demons is to have him merge with one of them. Their plan succeeds, and Akira gains the ability to transform into a superpowerful, batlike demon. As Devilman, he fights various bizarre demons, most notably the harpy-like Siren, and the turtle-like Jinmen, while still trying to lead a normal life.\n\nWhile the TV series was dark by Shonen anime standards, the manga and most other versions are pure horror, filled with things like graphic violence and dismemberments.\n\nUltimately, it is revealed that Ryo is actually Satan (And a hermaphrodite who's in love with Akira) and the two friends have a final battle that ends in the world being overrun by demons. Nagai's later series, Violence Jack, is set in the resulting postapocalyptic world.\n\nTo promote the final OVA Apocalypse of Devilman in 1999, Go Nagai resurrected the manga in two forms, one is a collection of short stories entitled Neo-Devilman where he and many other writers/artists (17 to be precise) contribute to the Devilman mythos with their own spin-offs and visions for the original tale, the other is where Nagai teamed up with Yuu Kinutani to create a 6 Volume manga simply called AMON, which is centered around and expanding the events between humanity's persecution of demon/human hybrids and the anticipation for Devilman vs. Satan's final battle; Go Nagai writes the tale while Yuu Kinutani pencils with his high detailed art. In 2005 these two teamed up again to create Strange Days, a single manga volume centered around a group of devilmen, Kira and Ryuu, clashing at Devilman vs. Satan's final battle, it tells their story of how their rivalry came to be during the persecution against devilmen.\n\nAnother Nagai series, Devilman Lady, was a reinterpretation of the original series except with the characters' genders switched, and a pseudo-scientific explanation for the \"demons\". It was similarly violent and controversial.\n\nA new Devilman manga, Devilman Grimoire, began running in Champion Red magazine on 19 April 2012. It is written by Go Nagai and illustrated by Rui Takato. A remake of the original manga, it is set in the present day and stars Akira Fudo and Miki Makimura, who believes herself to be a witch. It features many characters from the original Devilman, but in different situations. It remains to be seen whether this series is connected to previous series of the Devilman universe (Devilman, Violence Jack, Devilman Lady and Shin Violence Jack), or whether it is an alternate universe.\n\nDevilman appears in the Massive Multiplayer Crossover game, Sunday VS Magazine Shuuketsu Choujou Daikessen.\n\nTropes used in Devilman include:"
