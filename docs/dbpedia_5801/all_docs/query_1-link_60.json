        "text": "A new Devilman manga, Devilman Gaiden: Ningen Senki, started serialization in Monthly Young Magazine. It commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Devilman manga, which debuted in 1972. Fujihiko Hosono (Crusher Joe, Gallery Fake) is the writer and artist behind Devilman Gaiden. [Thanks, Comic Natalie!]\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe story takes place in the Reiwa era of Japan. It follows a delinquent named Roppei, who is an acquaintance of Akira’s. When devils suddenly appear in Japan and attack, Akira entrusts Roppei with protecting the Makimura family. For reference, the Makimuras are family friends of Akira’s. Roppei does his best, but Akira has to step in and help. That is when Roppei finds out that Akira is a Devilman.\n\nDevilman is a highly influential work from Go Nagai. Works that draw influence from it include Neon Genesis Evangelion and X. There have been multiple adaptations of it over the years. This includes Netflix’s Devilman Crybaby, which aired in 2018. Devilman follows the story of Akira Fudo, who becomes the eponymous Devilman upon fusing with a demon named Amon. The story is fairly dark and violent, but has strong anti-war themes as well.\n\nDevilman Gaiden is running on a monthly schedule in Monthly Young Magazine. There is no information on whether or not it will be available in the west."
