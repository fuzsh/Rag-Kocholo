Each additional book 1.50.\n\nUSPS is my preferred shipper.\n\nBuyer assumes ALL responsibility for uninsured shipments. (I will pay for\n\ninsurance on orders of 60.00 or more.)\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\n\nI try to provide excellent customer service. Feel free to check out my feedback,\n\nand compare with other sellers.\n\nI sell a lot of collectible items, and I package them well. I use the golden\n\nrule of packaging. I ship things the way I would like to receive them.\n\nIf you have any questions about an item. Please ask BEFORE ordering.\n\nRETURNS AND REFUNDS:\n\nAll buyer returns are subject to a 15% restocking fee (with the exception of seller mistakes, see point 2 below; or orders that are cancelled by the buyer BEFORE they ship). This includes orders made by mistake; buyers remorse; not the item you meant to order; not what your loved one wanted for Xmas or birthday,\n\netc.\n\nOriginal or return postage will not be refunded.\n\nSo, make sure you want to order something BEFORE you purchase.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions for clarification before ordering. I try to get back to messages quickly.\n\nIf an item is returned damaged, higher restocking fees may apply, so make sure returned items are well-packaged and insured.\n\nIf I make a mistake with an order (hopefully this will not happen) I will assume all costs for returns and refunds.\n\nI don't want someone else to pay for a mistake I make... but don't want to pay for someone else's mistake, either.\n\nPlease remember, it takes up time to give great customer service and provide quality packaging of items, so make sure you ask questions before ordering, and don't order something you are not sure about."
