Its release date has not yet been revealed.\n\nDEVILMAN crybaby, which previously nabbed Anime of the Year at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards, comes to us from director Masaaki Yuasa and Science SARU. It launched in 2018 and is currently streaming on Netflix. The franchise started with the manga Devilman by Go Nagai, which is published as a Classic Collection by Seven Seas Entertainment. Seven Seas gave this description for it:\n\nGo Nagai’s groundbreaking horror classic that inspired the genre for decades.\n\nHordes of demons, once thought entombed forever in the underworld, have now returned to Earth. Evil and corruption begin to seep into our world, as demons seize human hosts. Mankind’s only hope for salvation is to use the demons’ power against them–and only a pure-hearted man like Fudo Akira can do so without losing his humanity. Once little more than a crybaby, Akira now wields the terrible power of a devil, yet holds the innocent soul of a man–Devilman!\n\nSource: Press release\n\n____"
