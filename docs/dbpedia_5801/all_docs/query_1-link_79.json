        "text": "This interview was published in CONTINUE 51. Below I will use Ucchi for Uchiyama Kouki and Ayu for Murase Ayumu.\n\nActually Uchiyama-san has once appeared in CONTINUE 7 years ago. (Showing them CONTINUE vol. 44.)\n\nUcchi: Waah—are you publishing pictures of that time (laughs)\n\nAyu: Oooh, let me see. Whoa, you look so young!\n\nUcchi: I think I still have this at home. Such a long time ago.\n\nSo, this will be our first interview of Uchiyama-san in 7 years, and the first one for Murase-san. First of all, when did you get to know Devilman?\n\nAyu: Although it’s a famous work that maybe everyone knows about, this has been the first time I read it properly.\n\nUcchi: It’s also the first time for me. For me it’s an unexpected work. I felt like being possessed by something while reading. It’s a work with a heart. The development of the story was amazing, and the power of the drawings when they appeared in a surprising full page was immense. I certainly thought it’s a masterpiece.\n\nAyu: I was surprised that Nagai-sensei wrote this when he was in his 20’s. I thought, How come he was able to write something like this?\n\nUcchi: Such a hitting streak[1] in tragedy. The scene that left the biggest impression on me was the attack on the Makimura family’s house. In the original manga, Tare-chan was at home, and the way his death was shown was…\n\nAyu: That was brutal. But if his dad and mum have taken him with them…\n\nThis time, you joined (the production) through auditions, didn’t you.\n\nUcchi: That’s right. But I was accepted for the audition for the role of Asuka Ryou. Then they contacted me, asking me to voice Fudou Akira instead. I was totally surprised because there wasn’t any talk about voicing Fudou Akira before. However, since I have previously worked with director Yuasa (Masaaki), and since Kimura Eriko-san would be taking care of the sound direction, I thought this team could not go wrong. I decided (to accept the role) on the spot.\n\nAyu: Because I have watched PING PONG THE ANIMATION , when I saw director Yuasa’s name, I thought, Aaah, PING PONG director! I was already so happy just to get a slot in the audition. In the audition for Asuka Ryou, the lines were difficult, and I was asked to use a low voice. Because I had to speak with a voice that’s one tone lower than my usual voice, although I was glad I passed, I frankly thought that it’s going to be hard.\n\nHow did you two approach Fudou Akira and Asuka Ryou?\n\nUcchi: Since the original work and DEVILMAN crybaby are different in terms of time period, setting, and such, I believed that I had to build this anime’s Fudou Akira from scratch. I was aware that the character design of Fudou Akira in the first episode was lovable, “a person that everybody loves for his innocence”. Since he changed into Devilman at the end of episode 1, I had to rebuild a new image of Fudou Akira from episode 2. Because he also transformed into Devilman, I tried out various things one by one, carefully developing and remembering them.\n\nAyu: Asuka Ryou was driven by a power that he himself didn’t understand well. Since he tried to find out about his true identity, he finally came into realisation of who he was. I myself went on acting while thinking where Asuka Ryou’s heart was.\n\nHow was the recording of the demon hunting-Armageddon that lead to the end of crybaby?\n\nUcchi: Because I entered the story absorbed into my character’s point of view, episode 9 was mentally especially hard. When I read the original manga, I thought, How would this work be visualised in the present setting? I wondered how we’d do the Sabbath scene or the scenes in school. However, when I read the script, it all has been changed to fit the present time, it was nicely seamless. It was able to depict both humanity’s amazing side and insane side in today’s context. Fudou Akira, who was driven by his conviction to save humans, was betrayed by humans who stirred mass panic, leading him to despair… (the script) was able to create emotions through the series of events.\n\nAyu: As Asuka Ryou’s voice actor, the hard part was the midway of the story when his relationship with Fudou Akira turned sour. In the first half he planned a lot of things, and with his wit he coldly executed his plans. However, since the mid-part, he parted ways with Fudou Akira and his frustration piled up. Yet, he himself was not aware of the frustration, making him pent-up. That part is hard.\n\nUcchi: In the latter half, although the world was messed up, Asuka Ryou alone looked untroubled.\n\nAyu: Yeah. Since he realized that he’s Satan, he took things rather on his own pace. (laughs) He said “You’re late, Akira” but he was waiting leisurely, believing that Akira would come. When the world was engulfed in panic, Asuka Ryou alone was in the position to draw the line. As Murase, I felt sad and troubled watching the tragedy that befell Miki-chan and Miiko…\n\nUcchi: Because human tragedy for Asuka Ryou was a trivial matter.\n\nAyu: That’s right. That’s why he observed the tragedy in the latter half with “How fascinating” air. If we empathize with the story, we’d surely side with Devilman.\n\nFor you, between Fudou Akira and Asuka Ryou, which one do you think is easier to understand (you can empathize with)?\n\nUcchi: For me it’s Asuka Ryou.\n\nAyu: Eeeeh. (laughs) For me it’s Fudou Akira.\n\nUcchi: (Murase-kun) has hope in humanity.\n\nAyu: I do. As the one who voiced Asuka Ryou, I see him as the type that unemotionally moves forward without hesitation to achieve his goal. He’s too different from me. On the other hand, there are parts of him that I can see exactly because he’s too different from me. I am fond of Fudou Akira because he tried his best while putting hopes in human.\n\nUcchi: I can understand Asuka Ryou’s logical way of thinking. I’m totally feeling him.\n\nThis time, when the last recording was finished, did you get a sense of accomplishment?\n\nUcchi: You bet there was. That feeling of accomplishing something. Of overcoming one of this year’s peaks.\n\nAyu: After the recording was finished, I thought a lot about what kind of atmosphere the music would bring. I also imagined that the music was going to be like this or that. When I watched the completed anime, I checked and turned out I was very wrong.\n\nUcchi: That’s because during recording, they hadn’t finished the animation. For action scenes, we listened to the details of how the bodies move in them from the scene director. We recorded the scenes confirming them cut by cut.\n\nAyu: Ah, the last fight with Satan was especially hard. Here you punch him, here you bend backwards… and such.\n\nUcchi: The fight with Silene too was hard. We were able to do the recording because they built such a good atmosphere.\n\nHow do you want people to enjoy this work?\n\nUcchi: Although I think this work can be enjoyed by both those who love the original work and those who did not know it previously, for people who get to know DEVILMAN for the first time through this work, do read the original work to experience the different kind of enjoyment.\n\nAyu: I think it would be interesting if you pay attention to the “colours” when you watch the anime. For instance, how one’s tongue turns green when they turn into a demon or how a demon’s blood is yellow. Or how, although the eyes lose their shine when one turns into a demon, in the scene of Silene, you can see how her eyes are shining, making you wonder whether the eyes shine when one’s showing their humane side. There are a lot of things to think about in this work, so please enjoy director Yuasa’s world view."
