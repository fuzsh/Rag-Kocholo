        "text": "Plot\n\nNine people from around the world are kidnapped by the evil Black Ghost organization and undergo experiments which turn them into cyborgs with superhuman powers. The nine cyborgs band together in order to stop Black Ghost in its' goal of starting the next world war by supplying rich buyers with countless weapons of mass destruction. After the destruction of Black Ghost, the nine cyborgs go on to fight a variety of threats such as mad scientists, supernatural beings and ancient civilizations.\n\nManga\n\nThe first arc was serialized in Weekly Shōnen King (Shōnen Gahosha). It depicts the 009's origin story, the escape from Black Ghost, and running from cyborg assassins. It was briefly ended with the battle with the Mythos Cyborgs story.\n\nThe second arc called The Underground Empire Yomi Arc. Appeared in Weekly Shōnen Magazine (Kodansha) alongside the release of the film version. The story is highly influenced by Edgar Rice Burroughs' Earth's Core series, including an expedition to the center of the Earth with a drill tank and a reptile race who can use telepathy and grow wings. The story ends with the final battle against Black Ghost. The final scene has 009 and 002 falling into the Earth's atmosphere and being seen as a shooting star by two small children, one who wishes for a toy gun the other for world peace (a scene reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's Kaleidoscope). This point was the intended finish for the series; however popular demand necessitated the two heroes be rescued. As such, 001 was able at the last minute of using his telekinetic powers to retrieve 002 and 009 from their plummet before death.\n\nThus began the third arc Serialized in Monthly Bouken-oh (Adventure King) (Akita Shoten). It contained 6 story arcs, including the Monster Island Arc, the Middle East Arc, and the Angels Arc. The series abruptly ended during the Angels Arc.\n\nThe fourth arc called The Battle of the Gods Arc was serialized in COM (Mushi Production). Ishinomori resumed and retold the interrupted Angels Arc with a new plot, but the series once again ended abruptly. Ishinomori would not resume the series for a few years after this.\n\nThe fifth arc was serialized in Shōjo Comic (Shogakukan). Included the Wind City Arc, the Snow Carnival Arc, and the Edda Arc. The story deals with legendary and mythical like characters challenging the 00 Number Cyborgs.\n\nThe sixth arc connected to the 5th work. Arcs such as the Deinonychus Arc (appeared in Monthly Shōnen Jump (Shueisha)) and Green Hole Arc (appeared in Play Comic (Akita Shoten)) were depicted, then after a long time the Underwater Pyramid Arc was serialized in Monthly Manga Shōnen (Asahi Sonorama).\n\nThe seventh arc was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Sunday (Shogakukan) to go with the revival anime. A long arc consisting of many short arcs, this series dealt with the battle against Neo Black Ghost as well as the emotional trauma of the 00 Number Cyborgs. The story is set approximately 20 years after the Yomi Arc, and the personalities and conduct of the cyborgs are depicted as more adult.\n\nThe eighth arc was serialized in Monthly Comic Nora (Gakken). A long arc called People Drifting Through Time and Space Arc. A sequel to the Immigration Arc. The Count of St. Germain from the Underwater Pyramid Arc appears, but his design is different.\n\nIshinomori's death made this the last work of the series, although it is not the final chapter.\n\nManga publication history\n\nWritten and illustrated by Shotaro Ishinomori; serialized in Monthly Shōnen King; published in Japan by Akita Shoten and other companies through its history; published in North America by Tokyopop.\n\nThe Tokyopop release took multiple liberties with the dialogue and translation, and was sourced from the Media Factory \"MF Comics\" release that had been published in 2003. The MF Comics release had comprised 36 volumes, of which Tokyopop had only covered 10. Ishinomori's initial intent was to have the Yomi arc be the end of the series, but he wound up continuing due to the fan letters that urged him to resurrect 009 and 002.\n\nDigital comics distributor comiXology licensed the entire catalogue from Ishimori Productions in 2012 and has since made the first 10 volumes of Cyborg 009 available. It is not known if comiXology intends to translate the entire series, as the volumes available had recycled the original Tokyopop adaptation by Mike Wellman and Bryan Matsumoto.\n\nIn April 2012, Shogakukan announced that the Cyborg 009 manga would be given a proper conclusion in Weekly Shōnen Sunday. Entitled Cyborg 009 Conclusion: God's War, the manga is to be illustrated by Masato Hayase and based on Ishinomori's original concept notes, sketches, and a novel draft, all of which had been gathered by his son, Jo Onodera. Conclusion is scheduled to debut on April 13, 2012.\n\nGraphic novel\n\nA full-color graphic novel based off the franchise was released at San Diego Comic-Con International on July 21, 2013 to align with the anniversary of Ishinomori's original manga. The book is a condensed retelling of the 00 Cyborgs' battle against Black Ghost, led by Sekar (Skull). The book also cites Foundation X, the recurring evil organization from the Kamen Rider Series since Kamen Rider W, as being the financial backers of Black Ghost, as they are for the various Evil Organizations in the recent Kamen Rider series. The full release was on September 11, 2013. The graphic novel is written by F. J. DeSanto and Bradley Cramp, penciled and inked by Marcus To and published by Archaia Comics.\n\n1966 movie\n\nThe first Cyborg 009 film was released on July 21, 1966.
