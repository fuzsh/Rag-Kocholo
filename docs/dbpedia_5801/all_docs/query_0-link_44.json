        "text": "So recently, due to this thread topic - discussing Demon Slayer S2 causing some controversy about its use of the Red Light District:\n\nIt got me thinking about shonen series and how there are a lot of scenes that would 100% be not apporiate to show to kids and young teenagers. So my question to you all is - what scenes from Shonen Jump Series are you suprised actually made it into Shonen Jump. This can be due to subject manner,violence,sex,adult themes,etc.\n\nIn terms of an example - i am going to pull one from JoJo's Bizzare Adventure Part 6: Stone Ocean so MAJOR SPOILERS for that part.\n\nThere is one scene in particular i am honestly suprised Shonen Jump allowed in Stone Ocean without some sort of pushback from Jump and that's one of Stone Ocean's most wellknown scenes. That being the Ku Klux Clan brutalising Weather Report and his sister for his\" mother\" being married to an African Amercian man. Brutalising Weather and then hunging Weather Report at least in my opinion was extremely violent for a Shonen Series in 2003 so i am (Keep in mind - Stone Ocean was during the heyday of Naruto and Bleach)\n\nThis is my example but i am curious to know other pepole's scenes from Shonen Jump Manga/Anime that you were suprised made it into Shonen Jump.\n\nStuff that made it into Shonen Jump in the 80s can be pretty freaking dicey. Bastard!! has some lewd shit in it before it moved to an older demo magazine that would never make it in Jump in a million years (think the Chainsaw Man color spread but worse).\n\nA lot of things in Devilman but out of everything\n\nMiki's death and what happened to her afterwards is very disturbing\n\nNot Shonen Jump.\n\nVery recent MHA manga chapter spoilers\n\nI'm really shocked the Horikoshi was able to get away with the domestic abuse flashback in the way he did. I'm sure the imagry of a women who was probably just hit by her husband while the children are cowering in fear as he screams will trigger a lot of people's terrible memories, especially when the anime adapts in.\n\nChainsaw Man as a whole really pushes the envelope with what they allowed in that manga. There was a lot more gore and violence than I think I've ever seen in a Weekly Shonen Jump and it was relentless.\n\nIt's no surprise at all that the manga moved to Jump+ when the final chapter literally has cannibalism in it. ðŸ˜‚\n\nStuff that made it into Shonen Jump in the 80s can be pretty freaking dicey.

She walked and talked and felt like a human and I don't imagine she was made of chicken noodles. Denji literally chopped her into little pieces and made dozens of dishes with the meat like he's Hannibal Lecter. It was seriously fucked up. ðŸ˜‚"
