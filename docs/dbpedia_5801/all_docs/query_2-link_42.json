        "text": "Been quite a while since I’ve posted any raw scans (at least publicly). However, I’ve got a real treat here for you guys. Especially for fans of fantasy series.\n\nI’ve got scans of the only manga series ever released by famed artist, Nobuteru Yuuki… and the title of it is “Vaelber Saga”. You may be familiar with Yuuki’s work on the Record of Lodoss War OVA, as well as Vision of Escaflowne. He’s also done character design work for various Role-playing games such as Seiken Densetsu 3, Chrono Cross, Tail Concerto, and Dragon Force II. His art is absolutely astounding, and the art in this manga is no exception.\n\nYou know, it’s funny to me, this is actually the third manga series with “Saga” in the title which I’ve scanned. The first was Guin Saga, which I released scans of vols 4~6 of a few years ago. The second was Devilman Saga, which I privately scanned a few volumes of (vols 2~5) for xPearce as he was working on the series (you can see my update post about it here). And now the third one is Vaelber Saga. Maybe I’ll scan more series with “Saga” in the title in the future, who can say? Are there even any more worthwhile ones?\n\nIn any case, here are the links:\n\nMangaUpdates\n\nDDL folder\n\nNyaaTorrents\n\nAs usual, I’ve uploaded the 300dpi JPG version in the DDL folder, or if you’re looking for the original 600dpi TIFs, you can find them in the torrent on Nyaa.\n\nThe series was originally serialized monthly in Fujimi Shobo’s “Dragon Magazine”, starting in Aug 1988 and running until Nov 1994. The interesting thing is that despite the first two volumes following a fairly typical release schedule, with the first volume releasing July 20, 1990 and the second volume releasing May 12, 1993… the third volume would actually not see a release until a little over ten years later in October 01, 2003. The reason behind this is that the third volume was actually not printed by Fujimi Shobo, but instead by Kadokawa Shoten, under their “Dragon Comics” label. My best guess about what happened is that the second volume didn’t sell well, and Fujimi Shobo decided not to print the third one, but still hung onto the license just in case. As for how Kadokawa Shoten later obtained the license and was able to print the third volume, I’m not certain, but I’m thankful they did, because unlike a lot of other short-form series, this one appears to have an actual ending.\n\nBelow you can find a gallery of preview images. I typically try to keep this limited to only 12 images, but there was just so much fantastic art in this book that I had to increase the number to 18 just to show it off. Perhaps in the future it would actually be better to do it like this, and do 6 preview images per-volume.\n\nI’ve got some more raw scans for you here. Going back once again to an author I’ve posted quite a bit of, Satomi Mikuriya.\n\nThe name of this series is Kentauros no Densetsu, or「ケンタウロスの伝説」\n\nThe katakana would have you believe this should be translated as “Legend of the Centaurs”… and the motorcycle gang does have a centaur on their biker jackers. However, they also spell it out with English characters as “Kentauros”, further confusing things. In any case, I digress. You can find it at the links below:\n\nMangaUpdates\n\nDDL folder\n\nNyaaTorrents\n\nThe series was originally serialized in 1981 in Shueisha’s “Weekly Playboy”, not to be confused with the American magazine, which has no relation (despite both being adult-oriented publications). Written by an author simply known as “Osamu”, with art by Satomi Mikuria, it follows a motorcycle club from Yokohama known as the Centaurs (or “Kentauros”?). I haven’t read any of the book, but flipping through the pages it looks like they get up to some mischief, as well as attempt to enter some kind of motorcycle race. Military police also get involved at some point? It looks pretty wild. You can check out some preview pages below.\n\nLike usual, I’ve uploaded the 300dpi JPG version in the DDL folder, or if you’re looking for the original 600dpi TIFs, you can find them in the torrent on Nyaa.\n\nI’ve got some more raw scans for you here, as usual in glorious 600dpi. This is a classic series that many of you are probably somewhat aware of, from one of the all-time classic masters of manga, Shotaro Ishinomori.\n\nThe series I’m talking about is Genma Taisen「幻魔大戦」which literally translates as “Genma Wars”. It was originally released in 1967, and later collected into two tankobons in 1968. These scans are of re-printed editions of those volumes, with the first volume being the 50th printing from 2014, and the second volume being the 44th printing, from 1983. You may or may not be able to tell that the paper for the second volume is a bit more yellowed, but both of them seem to have aged fairly well.\n\nThe series would later be adapted to a feature-length film in 1983, which was later re-named “Harmageddon” when it was brought over to the English-speaking side of the world. The film is fairly well known, I feel, but not as many people are familiar with the manga, as I don’t believe it has ever seen an English-language release. Here’s hoping somebody can use these raws for an English-language scanlation (however, there is a LOT of text here).\n\nIn any case, you can grab the files below. I’ve uploaded the 300dpi JPG version in the DDL folder, or if you’re looking for the original 600dpi TIFs, you can find them in the torrent on Nyaa.\n\nMangaUpdates\n\nDDL folder\n\nNyaaTorrents\n\nIt’s been a while since I’ve released any new raw scans publicly, but I’m back with a very special treat for you all. This is a raw scan of Volume 4 of Kochikame. Now, I’m sure you’re wondering why I’m only releasing volume 4 and nothing else. Or maybe you’re wondering why I’m releasing this at all with public scans already available.\n\nWell, this is actually the original release of this volume, which begins with a sealed chapter titled 「派出所自慢の巻」or “Hashutsujo Jiman no maki”, which can be translated as “Police Box Pride”. This chapter was essentially banned from re-printings of the series sometime in the 80s or 90s, never to be seen again.\n\nThe chapter involves Ryoutsu and Nakagawa filling-in at Mizumoto Park’s police box. However, this police box has officers wearing military uniforms, which is why they’re nicknamed 「国境警備隊」”kokkyoukeibitai”, which translates to “border guards” or “border patrol”.\n\nI think the reason it may have been banned is because at one point Ryoutsu and Nakagawa use antique firearms as kindling, and perhaps the publishers wanted to discourage the destruction of antique items. However, this is just speculation.\n\nWhen this chapter was removed, the chapters in vol 4 were re-arranged, and this chapter was replaced by a volume-exclusive chapter known as 「野球狂の男の巻」or “Yakyuu-kyou no Otoko no maki”, which translates to “Baseball Madman”. This chapter can be found in the current public raws of the series, or any of the current re-printings of vol 4.\n\nIn any case, you can grab the files below. I’ve uploaded a 300dpi JPG version in the download folder, or if you’re looking for the original TIFs (also 300dpi this time around), you can find them in the torrent on Nyaa.\n\nYou’ll also notice that I’ve done a basic rotate and crop on these files, but haven’t done any kind of cleaning or leveling except on the front cover.\n\nAnyway, enjoy!\n\nMangaUpdates\n\nDownload folder\n\nNyaaTorrents\n\nI’ve been scanning in a lot of Satomi Mikuriya’s works lately, so I figured I would scan in something a little different for you guys to change things up.\n\nThis is a manga called Series 1/1000 sec, written and illustrated by Kaoru Shintani, whom you may know as the mangaka behind series such as Area 88, Desert Rose, Buttobi CPU, and Cleopatra DC. It consists of two volumes, released by Sun Comics on May 25, 1981 and June 25, 1981, respectively, but was originally serialized by Asahi Sonorama in Manga Shounen from February 1980 until April 1981. There are also some of Kaoru Shintani’s oneshots included, one serialized in 1981, and the other three serialized in 1975.\n\nI believe the “series” in the title refers to a series of photographs being taken at one one-thousandth of a second, and not that the story itself is a “series” of chapters. In any case, just flipping through the pages, it seems to be about photography, and also nude modeling? Even though the nudity isn’t very detailed, I’m kind of surprised this was serialized in shonen magazine.\n\nBelow, as usual, are some preview images, as well as a download folder containing a 300dpi JPG version. You can find the original 600dpi TIF scans on Nyaa. You can find more information about the manga on MangaUpdates, and I also have a chapter list for each volume here, with page numbers and each chapter’s length.\n\n(Note: in Volume 2 on pg 80 and 81, You’ll notice the pages are still physically connected. This is due to the glue having seeped too far into the page which didn’t allow me to separate those two pages without damaging them and ruining some of the dialogue on pg 79 and 82. Thus, I decided to preserve the dialogue in exchange for losing a bit of the inner margin on pg 80 and 81. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.)\n\nMangaUpdates\n\nDownload folder\n\nNyaaTorrents\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI’ve got a treat here for all of you Nora fans! This is Nora no Hakobune by Satomi Mikuriya. The title translates to “Nora’s Ark”, but it’s actually not a different Nora series. Originally published in 1979, this is an anthology of oneshots, which features the first published Nora story (also titled “Nora’s Ark”, which is a 90-page story split into three parts that was originally serialized in 1977 by Shogakukan in Big Comic Original).\n\nThis Nora story was later re-published in the Sun Comics edition of Nora (which I’ve previously posted scans of on this very blog), but this printing does have some extra art on a few pages that got cropped off in the later release. However, it also has some other pages that are cropped a bit further than they are in the Sun Comics edition.\n\nIt should be noted that it doesn’t appear to be simple printing errors that arise from offset printing, either. It almost looks like there may have been some censorship on a few pages, cropping off Nora’s high heels or her legs as she’s stripping. Odd choice if you ask me.\n\nIn any case, this volume also includes Weapon X (a oneshot which I believe is Satomi Mikuriya’s debut work, originally serialized in 1976 by Futabasha in Power Comics), Decomposer (another oneshot, from 1977, originally serialized by Futabasha in Comic Gang), and Fantasia Café Noir (a oneshot from 1978, originally serialized by Futabasha in Manga Action).\n\nHere’s a list of the included chapters, as well as their length:\n\nNora no Hakobune (Nora’s Ark)「ノーラの箱船」\n\nPart 1 (pg 003-032, 30 pages)\n\nPart 2 (pg 033-062, 30 pages)\n\nPart 3 (pg 063-093, 31 pages)\n\nDecomposer「デコンポーザー」(pg 094-138, 45 pages)\n\nWeapon X「ウェポンX」(pg 139-170, 32 pages)\n\nFantasia Café Noir「ファンタジア・カフェ・ノワール」(pg 171-195, 25 pages)\n\nAfterword (pg 196-197, 2 pages)\n\nAnyway, you can check out the preview images below, or you can find the full volume in the download folder, in 300dpi JPG format. For the 600dpi TIF version, check out the torrent on Nyaa.\n\nDownload folder\n\nNyaaTorrents\n\nI’ve got another manga by Satomi Mikuriya here for you all, titled Cinderella Boys. This is a single-volume six chapter series was originally published in July 1980 by Asahi Sonorama’s “Sun Comics” label. Just flipping through the pages, it appears to be a slice-of-life story with a romantic subplot set around a Japanese school. The main character rides a bike, and might be part of a biker gang, and there also appears to be a few delinquents as well.\n\nAlso included at the end of the volume are two one-shots, the first of which is titled Taiyou Kaikan「太陽海岸」or “Sunny Coast” which appears to be a love story about a wartime photographer and the beautiful woman he discovers through his camera lens.\n\nThe second one-shot, titled Mr. Rambling「ミスター・ランブリング」 appears to be a story about a truck driver going on an action-packed high-speed chase.\n\nAnyway, check out the preview images below to get a sense of the art and tone of the manga. You can find the full volume in the download folder below, in both 600dpi PNG format, and a much more compact 300dpi JPG format. More information about the series can also be found at the MangaUpdates link below.\n\nMangaUpdates\n\nDownload folder\n\nNyaaTorrents"
