The 16-year-old singer is known for her 4-octave high-tone vocals.\n\nThe song has been chosen to serve as the opening song for the anime series Chillin’ in My 30s After Getting Fired from the Demon King’s Army which began airing on TOKYO MX on January 7. The series has been adapted from the popular manga series by Rurekuchie currently serialized in Monthly Young Magazine.\n\nHinano’s debut song nocturne was produced by Yuki Kajiura and served as the theme song for the anime film Deemo: Memorial Keys. Her next song Virginia was chosen as the ending theme for My Master Has No Tail.\n\nThe new song CHANGEMAKER shows Hinano trying her hand at creating a rock track for the first time. “When I first listened to the tentative track, I wondered if I could do it justice. It seemed so difficult, I didn’t know if I could sing it,” Hinano said. “By really feeling the song with both my mind and body, I channeled my will and was able to sing it properly.” The music video for CHANGEMAKER was also released on January 7.\n\nHinano「CHANGEMAKER」\n\nThe up-tempo rock sound combined with Hinano’s incredible singing ability makes this track unforgettable. Inspired by the desire to light up a dark world, this song is sure to make even the most gloomy day bearable.\n\n© 岡沢六十四・るれくちぇ・講談社／解雇された暗黒兵士製作委員会\n\nMore information about the upcoming anime series Insomniacs After School has been revealed.

Will you be tuning in?\n\nCast Comments\n\nHaruka Tomatsu (Yui Shiromaru)\n\nPopular Works: Sword Art Online (Asuna), Yo-kai Watch (Keta)\n\n“I absolutely love stars, so this role makes me super happy! Shiromaru is cool and doesn’t talk too much, but he is kindhearted and pure, and it was super fun to play him. Since he’s an older character, there are plenty of scenes where he gives helpful advice. This series is really heartwarming and I hope you’ll tune in!”\n\nSeiichiro Yamashita (Tao Ukegawa)\n\nPopular Works: The Eminence in Shadow (Cid Kagenou / Shadow), More Than a Married Couple, But Not Lovers (Jiro Yakuin)\n\n“There are things that are incredibly difficult to say to others, but things that you feel you need to say. I could really feel the romance behind sharing secrets as I worked on this project. It carefully handles difficult issues and reminds us how hard it can be to truly understand other people. That’s why the human experience is so complex and dramatic. It’s a wonderful work filled with love. Enjoy it!”\n\nLynn (Motoko Kanikawa)\n\nPopular Works: Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury (Miorine Rembran), Uma Musume: Pretty Derby (Maruzensky)\n\n“I love the atmosphere of the original work. The glimpses of ordinary life seen in every scene are so precious. Kanikawa is funny and cute and it was a blast to play her. I had a blast ad-libbing with the other cast members! I hope that this series reaches a ton of new people now that it’s being adapted into an anime series!”\n\nNatsumi Fujiwara (Kanami Anamizu)\n\nPopular Works: SPYxFAMILY (Damian Desmond), Chuka Ichiban! (Mao)\n\n“I was worried that Anamizu would be too difficult of a role for me, but thanks to everyone’s help, I was really able to enjoy working on this series. The main character suffers from insomnia which is a terrible thing, but I was thrilled the entire time. After all, I love the stars! Ah, the splendors of youth! I can’t wait to see how the final product turns out!”\n\nSumire Morohoshi (Mina Nono)\n\nPopular Works: Aikatsu! (Ichigo Hoshimiya), The Promised Neverland (Ema)\n\n“Nono is so adorable! I wanted to make sure her laid-back energy came through. She’s gentle and kind and I think it will be completely apparent to audiences what kind of person she is. The work itself is both fresh and nostalgic at the same time, and it was so fun to work with the cast. I felt like I was back in high school again!”\n\nMamiko Noto (Usako Kurashiki)\n\nPopular Works: Kimi ni Todoke (Sawako Kuronuma), Hell Girl (Ai Enma)\n\n“I’m Mamiko Noto and I play the role of Usako Kurashiki. As a native of Ishikawa, it’s such a pleasure to work on a series based in my home prefecture. Ms. Kurashiki is a charming teacher and one I wish I had when I was a student. The original work is so rich in content and character, both warm and sad…it’s so detailed that it can truly feel like you’re wrapped up in it. I’m sure the anime will be the same way. I hope you’re looking forward to it!”\n\nSho Karino (Rui Haida)\n\nPopular Works: Tokyo Revengers (Chifuyu Matsuno), Idolmaster SideM (Yukihiro Kamiya)\n\n“This wonderful story is so meaningful. I was happy to experience it with everyone, with this entire cast. The scenery and starry skies will stick in your mind and make you want to go out and explore the night. Working on Insomniacs After School made me feel like I could enjoy my high school life again! Thank you so much!”\n\n©オジロマコト・小学館／アニメ「君ソム」製作委員会"
