        "text": "What a piece of Trash!\n\nBefore Go Nagai did his “Devilman” series in 1972-1973, which many consider his masterpiece and one of the greatest mangas of all time, Go Nagai drew a series called “Mao Dante”, which he never got to complete since the magazine who was publishing the story , Bokura Magazine, closed down before the work could be completed.\n\nTo set things straight, Mao Dante`s plot involves Ryo Utsugi, a young college student who becomes a powerful demon and an important ally in a war between a satanist cult and a secret society working under the word of God; a religious cult whose actions may not be as pure as it seem. Just like “Devilman”, the “Mao Dante” manga was a clever allegory on war and on the concept of ‘good versus evil’ perspective that soldiers and countries (like Japan) have during a war, where they are been told that they are doing the work of God, when this may not be so.\n\nFor years, Go Nagai never got the chance to finish “Mao Dante”; until 2002 when he published a new, complete and well-written version of his manga series, along with an anime adaptation done by Kenichi Maejima and Go Nagai’s production company, “Dynamic Planning”. Of the two “Mao Dante” manga series, they were only available in Japan, so by the time I found out how to buy them, I had already finished the anime.\n\nAt the start, I hoped “Mao Dante” would give me the same thrills I got with the “Devilman” manga. But while the last episode was concluding, I told myself that this anime was one of the worst viewing experiences of my life. Which really sucks as I love Go Nagai’s anime series; from “Mazinger Z” to “UFO Robot Grendizer” and modern ones like “Devilman Crybaby”.\n\nAs the first episodes of “Mao Dante” went on, I realized that the director Kenichi Maejima, or the producers, wanted to tell the story as if this adaptation of Go Nagai`s manga had been done in the seventies, which means corny music, dialogues and, most of all, very limited animation. Though that latter aspect might be due to the small budget of this series as it was produced by a committee called “Demon Lord Dante Production Committee”. Now don’t get me wrong, I loved Go Nagai’s “Mazinger Z”, “Great Mazinger”, and “UFO Robot Grendizer”. Why, “Grendizer” was even co-written by the writer of “Mao Dante”; Shozo Uehara. But those series were products of their own time periods. Trying to do exactly the same narration style three decades later, in a completely different time period, does not mean that the same good results would happen. Unless the people at the head of the project gave an excellent product.\n\nBut that is not the case with this adaptation of “Mao Dante”:\n\n1. Animation: For its thirteen episodes structure, this anime has been done on an uneven, but in the end, very limited budget. Indeed, with its still images, jerky and stiff movements, uses of animation cycles, CGI effects for smoke, ice shards and fire, and lots of pan-and-scan/tilt/zoom movements with the camera, the animation quality of this show goes below what most people would expect in an anime. Now sure, the first episodes (especially the third one) have a few clever camera angles, characters movements, backgrounds and lighting effects, but as a whole, this show’s animation was dreadful, uneven and the credits show this for as the episodes go on, the number of animators and in-betweeners went down. And considering that the show’s Production committee was a small company made specifically for this show, it’s evident that the budget was not made for a full quality animation. Then again, it would have been nice to have something more fluid and rich.\n\n2. Voice acting : I didn’t listen the series through the English dub, so I won’t comment too much on it (though the few bits I heard lacked strength and emotional conviction). But for the Japanese dub, I thought the actors would have been even better had they been given good acting directions from the director. Indeed, their voice acting is often forced and stereotyped, with the women and men talking just like the usual archetypes in a conventional anime. In the end, nothing impressive in term of acting.\n\n3. Music: Since the show seemed to recreate the same atmosphere of the seventies’ anime, the music, which I think was done on a single synthesizer, went along that line and succeeded that objective. But by doing so, it either veered on the dramatic or the corny side of the story. For if the dramatic music gave a decent atmosphere to the show ( e.g: when Ryo is in his bedroom and Medusa’ human counterpart invade his television and plays a commercial) half the music tracks were corny and annoying to listen to, changing the tone of the scenes in the wrong way (e.g: Ryo`s secret nightmare, or when Ryo is being offered his motorbike, or when Medosa attacks four humans who try to rape her). In the end, the only best point I would have to give to the soundtrack would be the ending theme, which is called “Heal” and is written and composed by Asuka Kuroki.\n\n4. Censorship: For the DVD release by the sub-licensor Enoki Films, many of the violent and controversial shots of the show have been obscured. It is already painful to watch a horrible show, but it is dreadful to being treated with such a censorship that makes some scenes unwatchable since we cannot even glimpse and understand what is going on in those scenes. However for the recent Diskoteck Media release, that censorship is absent; which is great for fans who want to see the show in an unfiltered way. But it makes me ask how and why Enoki would censor that show in the first place.\n\n5. Storytelling : I read online comments of people who said that as they watched this series, they rolled their eyes in disbelief as characters and classical images from the Bible (God, Eve, Belzebuub, Satan, Sodom,Gomorrah, the four riders of Apocalypse and many other religious characters) get the Godzilla treatment in this show. If this point bothered them, that aspect didn’t bother me at all for it was a concept that I glimpsed in the few pages of the original Manga I saw on the web. Then when I read the original manga, I felt that Go Nagai wanted to treat his story the same way as the Kikaijyu (monster) movies he loved to watch when he was young. In his original manga, this concept worked well because Go Nagai, in the first place, is a better storyteller than the ones who worked on this anime. But in this series, the characters also got the same corniness of that film genre and seventies anime, along with some dreadful dialogues where they either acknowledged or repeated over and over again what they just said or have been told, instead of thinking and acting like real people. Not only that, some of the comedy of the family scenes seemed stiff and forced upon the viewer and I didn’t find them funny at all, but instead stupid. For instance, there is a scene in episode 2 where Ryo, spotting a demon near his sister’s school, enters a gym where girls are changing clothes for their upcoming lesson; girls who, at the sight of Ryo, scream hysterically at the embarrassment that a young man entered their gym while they were undressing. If for the writers and director, this was meant to be funny, I found the scene senseless, stupid, and infuriating. For let’s think about it… which school would be stupid enough to allow its girl students to change clothes in a gym whose exit doors are open-wide for everyone to enter and see? Anybody and any schools in their right minds and in the real world would tell its students to change clothes in their proper changing rooms. Was this scene supposed to be funny and plausible? I don’t think so. And by the way, why do the characters have to talk and think in their head all the time? Can’t the directors have just let the images speak for themselves, even though they are badly animated?\n\nIn the anime’s plotline, we have to deal with ten episodes of Ryo Utsugi moaning and shouting with himself that he is not a demon, but a real human being, all the while trying to deal – in a quick and not too climatic way – a fight with a secret cult, the “D organisation”, and the Fours Demons of Apocalypse. Of all the characters I hated, those four demons were at the top of my list. They were one-dimensional, and only served as an excuse for some useless sex and action scenes that didn’t had any eventual consequences to the main character’s plot. Not only that those characters were extremely dumb. Though not as much as the human public in the story who – as they were getting afraid of being attacked by monsters and demons – were too dumb to notice that the sellers who tricked them with dangerous magical glasses were demons measuring nine or ten feet tall, were hairy, with horns, and carried large swords and axes behind their backs.\n\nFortunately, eighty percent of the bad stuff in this anime (Riders of Apocalypse, magic sword, European princess, Saori’s incestuous love for her brother Ryo, etc.) never were in the official manga versions (1970 and 2002), so I was reassured that Go Nagai didn’t had anything to do with all the bad ideas in this show. Though I really wonder who had the ideas for all these mediocre plot devices; if this was a mix-in of ideas between the producers, Uehara or Kenichi Maejima whose presence in a Press Conference for the Enoki DVD did not impress me as I saw before me a very insecure man who definitely was uncomfortable dealing with the public. Was this insecurity part of the reason why the series didn’t go well? For as “Mao Dante” is, according to Kenichi’s Anime News Network page, the only series he ever headed as Series Director (Showrunner), I don’t think its lack of success gave him more opportunity to direct more shows. And maybe this first/lack of experience as series Director explains why the show was pedestrian and very weak; which makes me sad as I feel that had the show had a more experienced showrunner, maybe the show would have been better. Speaking of Saori’s incestuous love, this relationship really disturbed me for not once are we being given good reasons as to why Saori would prefer to be in love with her brother instead of anyone else. Sure we have a revelation in the middle of the series about Ryo`s true family origins (nothing too surprising mind you) that would give us the excuse that this romance is okay since they are not really siblings. But this revelation was to me just a plot device so that the main character could have a romance that would go on after the end of the story, and would serve as a lousy deus-ex machina that I will not reveal, but that I absolutely loathed, and which was not in the 2002 and 1970 manga versions of “Mao Dante”, where Ryo Utsugi develops instead a true and healthier relationship with Medosa.\n\nTo conclude, I don`t think this anime would be a good way to introduce someone to Japanese animation, and I encourage everybody to buy instead the “Mao Dante” comic books, which were definitely better than this piece of trash. Which I decided to watch again thinking that my opinion would improve over the years. But as whole it hasn’t. Instead I consider this anime the most disappointing adaptation of a Go Nagai work I have ever seen."
