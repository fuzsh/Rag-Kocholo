A 39 episode anime series was developed by Toei in 1972 and Nagai began Devilman as a manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine, barely a month before the anime series started. The series has since spawned numerous OVAs, manga, novels, and films.\n\nDevilman and other characters from the series have shown up in cameo appearances numerous times in Go Nagai's other works. The most notable is Tomoharu Katsumata's 1973 feature film Mazinger Z Vs. Devilman, which features Devilman teaming up with Nagai's titular robot to fight Dr. Hell.\n\nContents\n\n1 Plot\n\n2 Production\n\n3 Media\n\n3.1 Manga\n\n3.2 Anime\n\n3.3 OVAs\n\n3.4 Films\n\n3.5 Music\n\n3.6 Other media\n\n4 Powers & Abilities\n\n5 Demons\n\n5.1 From The Manga\n\n5.2 TV series demons\n\n6 Remakes and sequels\n\n7 Popular reception and themes\n\n8 References\n\n9 External links\n\nPlot\n\nDevilman is about a teenager named Akira Fudo. At first, Akira is very shy, modest and gentle, trying to avoid conflict. When his parents are lost on a business trip in the Arctic, Akira goes to stay with his childhood friend Miki Makimura and her family (mother, father, and bratty kid brother Tare). Both soon form a close relationship. Miki, a tough, smart, self-sufficient girl, loves Akira but wishes that he would stand up for himself when he gets pushed around, and is frustrated by his lack of backbone. She often has to defend herself from bullies even when Akira is with her. In the first OVA, she saves Akira from a gang of bullies who are threatening him.\n\nOne day, Akira's best friend, Ryo Asuka, asks a favor and completely changes Akira's life. Ryo's father had discovered the existence of demons when he found a mask during an excavation of the ruins of an ancient Mayan temple. This mask turns out to be a fossilized demon skull, which shows whomever wore it what the world was like when demons ruled over it. Ryo shows Akira this and informs him about the demons' revival. Akira then sees Ryo's plan: \"To fight a demon, one must become a demon.\"\n\nDemons have the ability to possess and control humans. However, Ryo believes that people like Akira may be able to harness a demon's powers when possessed, due to the fact that Akira has a pure heart. Ryo takes his friend to a nightclub and picks a fight to draw demonic attention to the club. Demons possess the clubbers and threaten Ryo and Akira, until a demon known as Amon the Lord of War, also called the Beast of Hell, and also one of the strongest demons attempts to possess Akira. However Akira manages to gain the upper hand of the possessing process with Amon and transforms into Devilman. Devilman contains the strength and power of the demon Amon, as well as the heart and soul of Akira, giving Akira complete control.\n\nAfter he becomes Devilman, Akira is no longer timid and shy. He becomes very aggressive and no longer lets anyone push him around. This change pleases Miki, although she is unaware of Akira's new-found powers.\n\nThroughout the series, Devilman has many battles with the demon hordes. He encounters many foes such as Sirène the demon bird, the water demon Geruma, and a large turtle-like demon called Jinmen.\n\nIn the manga, the story ends with Akira is revealed by Ryo on a TV broadcast to be Devilman, yet the Makimura's still accept Akira as their friend. Akira then confronts Ryo and discovers that his friend Ryo is really Satan in a dormant state. Satan reveals to Akira that he convinced Akira to become Devilman in order to survive in the world he was planning to create. After Miki and her whole family are brutally slain by a paranoid human horde (in a particularly famous scene, Akira retrieves Miki's dismembered body from her burned house and later is seen holding her head in his arms), Akira states that he has no one left to protect, thus has no reason to exist except to have his final fight with Satan. After Satan is revealed by Lord Xenon that not only had Satan fallen in love with Akira, with Satan also revealed to be a hermaphrodite, the final fight between Devilman, Satan and their armies ensues. The Earth is totally destroyed during this battle, and Devilman dies at the hands of a regrettful Satan, who revealed his/her reason for defying God was because that even though God created demons, he wished to destroy them. Satan was appaled at this, believing that even though demons were a violent, bloodthirsty race, they still had a right to live, so he/she joined the demons. While he/she explains this to a dying Akira, he/she realized in the end, he/she was no better than God.\n\nThe 1972 anime TV series has no such apocalyptic conclusion and the ending is happier for Akira and Miki than in the manga. Devilman's identity as a real demon is exposed to Miki in the final episode, but she accepts that she is in love with Devilman, even if he is not human.\n\nProduction\n\nDevilman evolved from Go Nagai's previous manga, Demon Lord Dante, after Toei Animation approached Nagai about turning Dante into a television series.[1] The producers wanted certain elements toned down, and a more human-like anti-hero created. Devilman was born as a result of this. Go Nagai worked on the anime's scenario along with Masaki Tsuji, a well-known anime scenario and science-fiction writer who later worked on such series as Captain Future, Urusei Yatsura, and Dr. Slump.\n\nAlong with the television series, Devilman was also produced as a serialized manga with over 53 issues in Shōnen Magazine beginning in 1972.[2] Go Nagai designed the manga to be more horror-like and mature than the anime version, making it similar in tone to Demon Lord Dante. It was later reprinted in a five-volume series, and has enjoyed over a dozen reprints in five different languages. The manga's occult horror elements, extreme violence, and complex apocalyptic story made it an instant hit.\n\nMedia\n\nManga\n\nMain article: List of Devilman chapters\n\nThe manga was originally published by Kodansha from June 11, 1972 ( ) to June 24, 1973 (1973-06-24) in Shōnen Magazine.[2] The series has been published in tankōbon format several times, most of them by Kodansha. Starting with the 1987 publishing, most Kodansha editions include Shin Devilman, which originally was not meant to be included in the canon of the original series, as a part of the volumes.[3]\n\nThe manga has also been published along with Cutie Honey in the magazine Gekkan Kanzenban Devilman x Cutie Honey (月刊完全版デビルマン×キューティーハニー, gekkan kanzenban debiruman x kyūteī hanī?) published by JIVE during 2004[4] in order to take advantage of the release of the live-action films of both series.\n\nShin Devilman (新デビルマン, shin debiruman'?) was originally published in Kodansha's Shōnen Magazine Special in May 25, 1979 ( ), January 25, 1980 ( ), September 15, 1980 ( ), March 6, 1981 ( ) and May 8, 1981 ( ). All chapters were drawn by Go Nagai, but the first chapter was written in collaboration with Masaki Tsuji, while chapters two and three were written by Hiroshi Koenji.[5] The rest of the chapters were done by Nagai. The manga is sometimes known as Devilman 2 and Neo Devilman.[3] In this manga, Akira and Ryo travel to different epochs and places from human history in order to stop demons from causing hate between humans and thus make humanity destroy itself. In the first chapter they meet a young Adolf Hitler, in the second the French heroine Joan of Arc, in the third the goddess Nike, in the fourth Marie Antoinette, and in the last chapter the Cheyenne and Custer.\n\nA one-shot, which is not originally part of Shin Devilman, but that has always been compiled along with the series in Tankobon, was published in the magazine Variety by Kadokawa Shoten.[5] This 16-page story does not have any text and it presents the moments of Akira after the death of Miki in the original series, but before the battle with Satan, as he buries the remains of Miki and encounters Ryo.\n\nAnime\n\nMain article: List of Devilman episodes\n\nThe anime series was 39 episodes long and ran from July 8, 1972 ( ) to April 7, 1973 (1973-04-07) on NET (now TV Asahi).[6] The series enjoyed high ratings while it was on the air, though its popularity was dwarfed by that of Nagai's longer-running Mazinger Z on Fuji TV. The storyline of the anime series is different from that of the manga and of the OVAs.\n\nAkira and his father are killed while mountain climbing in the Himalayas, and Devilman chooses Akira's body as a cover to disguise himself. Although Devilman takes on his appearance, Akira is gone and Devilman is the body's sole occupant.\n\nDevilman's mission is to cause death and destruction on Earth to pave the way for a demonic invasion of the human world. However, when he moves in with the Makimuras under the disguise of Akira, he finds himself attracted to Miki's tough, no-nonsense ways, and is thus distracted from his mission. The lord of the demons sends forth a succession of demons to eliminate the distraction by killing Miki, and Devilman/Akira resolves to fight to protect Miki.\n\nUnlike in the manga, Miki survives at the conclusion of the anime series.\n\nThe characters Ryo Asuka and Satan do not appear in the anime series. In Satan's place is a demon named Lord Xenon who commands the Demon Tribe from the Kingdom of Ice. Lord Xenon appears as a shadowy figure that appears very similar to Demon Lord Dante.\n\nThe violence in the anime series was toned-down significantly from the manga.\n\nOutside Japan, the TV series was broadcast in Italy in 1983 and enjoyed great popularity there.\n\nOVAs\n\nDevilman: The birth (デビルマン 誕生編, debiruman tanjō hen?) was released in November 1, 1987 ( ) by King Records.[7] It was followed by Devilman: The Demon Bird (デビルマン 妖鳥シレーヌ編, debiruman yōchō shirēnu hen?), released in February 25, 1990 ( ) by Bandai Visual.[8] Kazuo Komatsubara, an animation director on the original TV series, was the character designer for the OVAs, which were animated by his Oh Production.\n\nBoth were directed by Umanosuke Iida (credited under his birth name, Tsutomu Iida) and were closely developed in conjunction with Nagai himself. The OVAs' plot revolves around Akira's transformation into Devilman up until his battle with Sirène. Besides a few minor alterations, the OVAs are faithful to the original manga. Both OVAs were released on Laserdisc and on a single DVD by Bandai Visual in March 28, 2003 ( ).[9] The two OVAs are also the only Devilman anime to have been commercially released in the United States (by Manga Entertainment), although the DVD release includes only the English-dubbed version (the original Japanese version was previously released on VHS).\n\nIn 2000, Amon: Apocalypse of Devilman was released as a pay-per-view event in Japan and was later released on video and DVD. It covers the period between the humans becoming aware of demons and the final battle between Devilman and Satan.\n\nFilms\n\nMazinger Z Vs. Devilman is a crossover film between Devilman and Mazinger Z produced by Toei and released in July 18, 1973 ( ). The movie features alternative versions of the events from both series, and is therefore not canonical to either one.\n\nIn October 9, 2004 ( ), a live-action tokusatsu film directed by Hiroyuki Nasu was theatrically released in Japan.[10] The film starred Hisato Izaki as Devilman, Yūsuke Izaki as Ryo Asuka and Ayana Sakai as Miki Makimura. The cast also included AV Idol Maria Yumeno.[10][11]\n\nMusic\n\nA large number of soundtrack albums have been released since the beginning of the original series.\n\nTitle Format Company Standard number Release date Devilman Flexi disc Asahi Sonorama APM-4016 July 10, 1972 ( ) Devilman EP record Columbia SCS-502 August 10, 1972 ( ) TV Original BGM Collection: Devilman LP album Columbia CX-7088 March 1983 ( ) TV Original BGM Collection: Devilman CD Columbia 28CC-2295 May 21, 1988 ( ) TV Animation Drama Series: Devilman CD Columbia COCC-12398 March 1, 1995 ( ) Animex 1200 Series 71: Devilman CD Columbia COCC-72071 September 22, 2004 ( ) Original Soundtrack Devilman Tanjo Hen Ongakushu LP album King Records K20G-7359 1987 ( ) Original Soundtrack Devilman Tanjo Hen Ongakushu CD King Records K30X-7094 November 1987 ( ) Visual Sound Series Devilman Shin Mokushiroku CD King Records K32X-7055 1987 ( ) Devilman Tanjo Hen / Yocho Sirène Hen CD King Records KICA-10 March 21, 1990 ( ) Devilman Densetsu ~ The Legends of DEVILMAN CD Pony Canyon FSCA-10054 October 21, 1998 ( ) Nagai Go Hero Densetsu Onkyo Geki Devilman Armageddon Hen CD First Smile Entertainment FSCA-10209 February 20, 2002 ( ) Devilman Densetsu + 3 ~ The Legends of DEVILMAN CD BeeSmile BSCH-30011 March 10, 2004 ( ) Eternal Edition Dynamic Pro Films Files No.11 & 12: Devilman CD Columbia COCX-32285/6 July 23, 2003 ( ) Devilman no Uta (21st century ver.)

The first one Shin Devilman (真・デビルマン, shin debiruman?) was written by Go Nagai's brother Yasutaka Nagai with illustrations by Go. It was originally published in 1981 by Asahi Sonorama in four books.[12] It is not related to the manga Shin Devilman, from which some chapters were also written by Yasutaka. With the release of the first OVA, in 1987 a single volume novel based on it was released by Kodansha titled Shin Video Shosetsu - Devilman: Tanjo Hen (新ビデオ小説 デビルマン 誕生編, shin bideo shousetsu debiruman tanjou hen?). It was also written by Yasutaka Nagai, but it had illustrations by the OVA's main designer, Kazuo Komatsubara. In 1999 a second novelization of 4 volumes titled Devilman: The Novel (デビルマン The Novel?) was published by MediaWorks and once again written by Yasutaka and illustrated by Go.[12] All three series of novels are unrelated to each other even though all were written by Yasutaka Nagai.\n\nA video game based on Devilman was released for the Famicom by Namco on April 25, 1989 ( ).[13] Bandai also released a game based on Devilman for the Sony PlayStation and Windows 98 on April 13, 2000 ( ).[14] Along with several of Nagai's other creations, Devilman appeared in the Japanese Super Famicom game CB Chara Wars: Ushinawareta Gag (CBキャラウォーズ 笑われたギャーグ, cb kyarauōzu warawa reta gyāgu?).[15]\n\nDevilman and other characters from the series have shown up in cameo appearances numerous times in Go Nagai's other works. The most notable is Tomoharu Katsumata's 1973 feature film Mazinger Z Vs. Devilman. Miki is the first female protagonist of the 1974 manga Oira Sukeban, and Akira has appeared in various incarnations of Cutie Honey, most notably the 1994 OVA New Cutie Honey. Miki and Ryo Asuka also appear as dogs (with dog-like bodies and human heads) in the Violence Jack manga.\n\nPowers & Abilities\n\nDevilman possesses a variety of powers that are mostly consistent with every appearance.\n\nDevil Cutter: Slicing discs from the belt buckle.\n\nDevil Wing: Wings from the back that allow flight.\n\nDevil Beam: Summons lightning from the sky and turns into green beams from the palms. Can also be used as a large fire ball.\n\nDevil Arrow: Orange energy bolts from the antennae. Can also be used as a sonic attack.\n\nDevil Eye: Allows Devilman to see in pitch black darkness and find an enemy's weakest point.\n\n(Note: Devilman's named attacks are mainly associated only with the series and not the main manga. Only a few related manga actually have him using these techniques by name, such as Devilman VS Getter Robo.)\n\nHis other powers include superhuman strength, speed, and movement, a healing factor that allows him to grow back limbs in a matter of hours, and superhuman endurance that grants him a high resistance to heat and acids except for his wings. In the television series he could use echolocation to locate his opponents, survive in space, and could change his size, usually being around 20 feet tall. This tied into a weakness of Devilman, where injuries he sustained as either a human or in a smaller form would become worse in giant form.\n\nDemons\n\nThroughout the Devilman franchise demons have been used as Devilman's opponents in both the manga and the anime. In the original manga and the OVA trilogy, demons were ancient life forms that required to consume other creatures including other demons to grow and become stronger. In the television series they became more similar to demons from religions such as Christianity and were more organized, although they were just as brutal toward each other.\n\nFrom The Manga\n\nMaegawa: A minor demon that was destroy by Ryou, his shadow was engraved in the walls (Appears in volume 3)\n\nJinmen: A demon similar to a tortoise. His specialty was consuming people, then manifesting their heads (and, by extension, their consciousness) on his shell. He uses this to shield himself from Devilman by using someone connected to him (This differs depending on the version. In the Manga, it's a young girl who lived next door to Akira; in the OVA, it was Akira's mother; and in the live-action film, it was a friend). Encouragement from the person captured, assuring him that they were truly dead, gives Devilman the courage to fight back and kill Jinmen.\n\nAgwel: One of two demons that serve Sirene. He possesses the Makimura house, holding Miki's family in the walls (though not killing them). He makes the walls malleable to slow Akira as he tries to save Miki from Ghelmar.\n\nGhelmer: One of two demons that serve Sirene. Ghelmar can merge with and manipulate water. He can manifest through steam, and even control people who swallow part of him. Akira uses pyrokinesis to dry him out, leaving Ghelmar vulnerable to physical attack.\n\nSirene: A powerful demon with characteristics of a bird. One of the few characters to appear in both the manga and the anime. She leads a hoard of Demons to attack Akira in his home before facing him herself. Various side-stories imply that Siren was Amon's lover, with their origins being closely tied together in Amon: The Darkside of Devilman.\n\nKaim: A powerful horned demon who was in love with Sirene. When Sirene lost to Devilman, he allowed her to kill and fuse with him, in order to stand a better chance at trying to kill Devilman.\n\nPsycho Genie: Another demon from the manga that appeared in the anime, she has great mental powers which includes hypnotism. She re-wrote Satan's memory into believing he was Ryo Asuka, on his instructions, and was responsible for showing Akira and Ryo the history of the demons through the fake demon remains.\n\nZan: Full title General Demon Zan, sends spider to control humans in an attempt to kill Devilman. He was the one who order the demons not to kill Akira by orders of Satan.\n\nAmon: The most powerful demon and arch-rival of Satan, he was the demon that fused to Akira for him to become Devilman. According to Amon: The Darkside of Devilman, Amon was actually the very first demon, created by God and sealed in the moon when he grew too powerful. The humanlike offshoot of Satan managed to obtain Amon's power, becoming the Demon that would merge with Akira. What became of the original Amon is unknown.\n\nLord Xenon: The three-faced ruler of the demons while Satan is dormant. He sends thousands of demons on suicide missions to expose the existance of demons, then publicly declared war on humanity, helping to set into effect the events that would lead to the end of the world.\n\nTV series demons\n\nIn the 1970's TV series, the Demon Tribe consists of demons from ancient times led by Xenon, a shadowy figure that replaces Satan in the anime and appears similar to Demon Lord Dante. It has been shown in various episodes that they care very little for other organisms and even each other, as they often fight to the death no matter how small the disagreement. Devilman becomes rogue against the rest of the Demon Tribe in the first episode. Most of the demons have supernatural powers such as shapeshifting, telekinesis, teleportation, possession of organisms and objects, illusions, and phasing through matter. Since most of the demons, including Devilman, often fly back from Japan to the Himalayas in under a minute, the presumed flight speed is around Mach 14.\n\nPhalanx: Appears in episode 1. Is the first member of the Demon Tribe to be killed by Devilman and has no known powers.\n\nDalm: Appears in episode 1. Is the second member of the Demon Tribe to be killed by Devilman and has no known powers.\n\nHenge: Appears in episode 1. Powers include highly advanced shape shifting, traveling through mirrors, telekinesis, and pyrokinesis.\n\nSirene: Appears in episode 2. Powers include flight, human disguising, hurricane winds from the wings on her head, shape shifting into butterflies armed with sleeping rays, talons on her hands and feet, mind scanning antennae, telekinesis, and heat resistance. She's the only demon to appear in both the manga and series (excluding Xenon). Her body is dark-blue in the series, as opposed to the white in the manga. Also, her body appears clothed in what could be called a one-piece bathing-suit made of feathers, while the manga Siren was naked (and anatomically correct) save for some feathers covering her privates.\n\nGerge: Appears in episode 3. Powers include flight by traveling in a tornado, green acid from the tail, shape shifting, and reformation. Because he is based on a slug he will dissolve if he remains in contact with salt.\n\nZannin: Appears in episode 4 and onward. Powers include a whip-like tail, heat rays from the eyes on his torso, and torso armor that absorbs and reflects or simply deflects attacks.\n\nVetra: Appears in episode 4. Powers include flight, shape shifting, possessing humans using special spiders, electric shocks, webs from the mouth that form like nets, and swimming.\n\nZoldover: Appears in episode 5. Powers include teleporting herself and objects long distances, super strength enhanced by her staff which also fires lightning bolts, telekinesis, a spear, illusions, entangling hair, a high resistance to pain, a dagger, regeneration, taking on forms of others she eats, and fireballs from the mouth of the face on her chest.\n\nLockfel: Appears in episode 6. Powers include phasing through matter, disguising himself as a human, fire breath, possession of objects, and morphing his hair into arms.\n\nZulu: Appears in episode 7. His only real power is making clay dummies that are used like voodoo dolls.\n\nAbill: Appears in episode 7. Powers include flight, fire breath, teleportation, and mouth fireballs.\n\nBauu: Appears in episode 8.

The series takes place during the aftermath of Armageddon and the battle between Satan and Devilman. It is speculated that Jack is Akira Fudo, who has lost his memory. This series became an OVA in 1986, and was released in the United States in the 1990s in an edited release by Manga Entertainment and an uncensored release by Critical Mass.\n\nThe cast of Devilman also crossed over with characters from Mazinger Z and Violence Jack in the 1991 OVA CB Chara Nagai Go World. This release featured the familiar characters in comical and lighthearted antics in super deformed form. In this series, it is revealed that Violence Jack is a future version of Akira Fudo. It is also revealed that Miki is an otaku and that she knew of Akira's identity as Devilman due to reading the manga offscreen.\n\nIn 1997, Nagai created Devil Lady. Devil Lady is based on Nagai's idea of if the main character was a woman. The Devil Lady series contains its own original story that stands out from the Devilman series.\n\nPopular reception and themes\n\nThe storyline in Devilman made it stand apart from other manga of the time. However, its extreme violence made it a major target of protest for the PTA and other groups. The manga has been translated into English in a series of five bilingual manga volumes published by Kodansha,[16] although the only Devilman anime to have been commercially released in America are the late 1980s OVAs.\n\nGo Nagai is said to have been highly shocked that his giant-robot work Mazinger Z, which was on Japanese TV at the same time as Devilman and which he originally did not take very seriously, surpassed Devilman in popularity. The reason was that he had worked especially hard on Devilman and only made Mazinger as a way to blow off steam.\n\nIn an essay written three decades after the debut of the original manga and TV series, Nagai commented that he designed Devilman as an anti-war work. According to Nagai, the fusion of humans and demons is an analogy for the draft, and Miki's gruesome death parallels the death of peace. \"There is no justice in war, any war,\" wrote Nagai, \"nor is there any justification for human beings killing one another. Devilman carries a message of warning, as we step toward a bright future.\"[1]\n\nReferences\n\n^ a b \"Devilman Revelations\". devilworld.org.
