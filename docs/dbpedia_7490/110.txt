The post-rock genre combines the basic building-blocks of traditional rock – two guitars, a bass, and drums – with a more experimental approach to song structure and sound design, and an emphasis on instrumentals over vocals. Borrowing from a wide range of genres, including ambient, electronica, krautrock, dub and even jazz, post-rock found a mass following with the popularity of bands like Mogwai, Sigur Rós and Slint.

Instrumental inspiration

At the core of this Pack is a selection of multisampled guitars and drums that reflect the distinct and diverse characteristics of the genre – from sharp, percussive sounds ideal for creating rhythmic patterns to rough and unpredictable distorted tones that add grit and depth to any track. Each multisampled instrument comes with round robin variations perfect for generating organic-sounding repetitions.

Immersive sounds and effects

Also included is a large collection of tweakable synth presets, texture loops and field recordings, dozens of drum, guitar and bass loops, a wide range of audio effect racks, and a set of modeled guitars.

ModeAudio co-founder Niall McCallum describes the Pack as a “creative bridge between the electronic and acoustic or instrumental worlds… it was very much my intention that post-rock’s experimental ethos would find its way into the DNA of the Pack.”
