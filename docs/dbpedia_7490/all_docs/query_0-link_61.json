I’m good on:\n\nTalk Talk - Spirit Of Eden\n\nSlint - Tweez\n\nWhat do you know, folks?\n\nFor those who want a more general definition of Post Rock:\n\nPost-rock - Wikipedia\n\nFor those who want to a definitely incomplete list of Post-Rock pioneers:\n\nPost-rock - Wikipedia\n\nIdeally, I'm looking for 80s (or earlier) acts that could today be considered Post Rock.\n\nThanks all!\n\nTalk Talk\n\nSlint\n\nThis Heat\n\nSavage Republic\n\nPiL\n\nThe Durutti Column\n\nBark Psychosis\n\nPram\n\nSeefeel (maybe)\n\nStereolab (if we stretch the term a little)\n\nDif Juz (maybe)\n\nGlenn Branca (?)\n\nGenerally speaking it's not so easy to pinpoint this proto-post genre apart from Slint of course which are the obvious answer every time this question is asked.\n\nThanks Nikolaos!\n\nWhile I was reading this thread, I was listening to Pat Metheny's \"As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls\". I would never label it as post-rock of course but just listen to the introduction and you'll see that there were certain things already present across many genres as back as the start of the 80s and even earlier. Also the title of this is so Constelation-style that is funny.\n\nA lot of West German music of the 70's sounds distinctly post rock to these ears. Can and Cluster have already been mentioned but Neu! and Harmonia also fit the bill. Harmonia were a collaboration between members of Cluster and Neu! so no surprise there. Check out the music of Harmonia and Eno.\n\nThe question for me becomes; can the same elements of a song be described by two or more styles (genres)? I know styles can be mixed, but that would be multiple elements.\n\nIn another thread about pre-shoegaze influences, this (see below) was posted and it had a very similar sound to the description of post rock. Can it be both?\n\nDif Juz- \"Mi\" (1981)\n\nWhat about the center section of the Wipers- \"Youth of America\" that starts around 2:50, or even the whole song?\n\nWipers- \"Youth of America\" (1981)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaUzYISKKAI"
