If you aren't sure how to help, check the article guide Format and Content\n\nPost-rock is a genre of music which, unlike regular rock music, does not focus as much on riffs, lyrics and melody, but much more on drones, harmonies, sound texture and most importantly song structure. Bands often have long names and even longer songs with dark, apocalyptic, and cathartic moods. This genre of music typically does have lyrics, but lyrics are absent more often than in traditional rock music.\n\nHere are some example songs from the genre.\n\nYour Hand in Mine by Explosions in the Sky\n\nGood Morning, Captain by Slint\n\nÁgætis Byrjun by Sigur Rós\n\nTake Me Somewhere Nice by Mogwai\n\nHistory[]\n\nPost-rock as a musical genre has it's roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with bands such as The Velvet Underground being highly influential to the sound. Krautrock in particular, a kind of German experimental rock music, also had a profound impact on the development of the genre.\n\nThe sound did not develop in earnest until 1991, with the dual album releases of Laughing Stock by Talk Talk, and Spiderland by Slint. These two records laid the foundation for the genre as we know it today, and continue to be massively influential to bands in the scene.\n\nPost-rock as a label is hard to define, and in common usage it contains a very wide variety of bands. Two separate usages of the word are most common, with the first usage being used to describe English electronic rock acts from the late 1990s, such as Stereolab, Laika, and Seefeel, and the second usage being a broader term containing those bands as well as sounds more influenced by Slint and Talk Talk. The latter definition is in more common parlance today.\n\nAs the genre continued to develop into the 2000s, many sub-movements spawned, perhaps most infamously in the pejoratively termed \"crescendo-core\", a sound that takes heavily after Godspeed You! Black Emperor and their musical style of long crescendos, orchestral arrangement, and a lack of traditional sung vocals. This genre is often criticized as being generic and over-saturated, but nonetheless defines what the sound of post-rock is most commonly conceived of as today.\n\nAesthetic[]\n\nPost-rock aesthetics are strongly rooted in Punk and counter-culture aesthetics. As an Avant-garde music style, it is fundamentally opposed to the mainstream. Post-rock is also strongly tied to anarchist and strongly progressive politics, perhaps most notably with the far left band, Godspeed You! Black Emperor. The post-rock aesthetic is low-key, with the musicians and the audience preferring to let the music speak for itself.\n\nPost-rock's visual and musical aesthetic often focuses on apocalyptic themes.\n\nNotable artists[]\n\nArtists in this genre include\n\nSlint\n\nTalk Talk\n\nGodspeed You! Black Emperor\n\nTortoise\n\nBark Psychosis\n\nStereolab\n\nSeefeel\n\nLaika\n\nSwans\n\nSigur Rós\n\nMogwai\n\nThee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra\n\nSet Fire To Flames\n\nBlack Country, New Road\n\nExplosions in the Sky\n\n65daysofstatic\n\nThis Will Destroy You\n\nDo Make Say Think\n\nMono\n\nBowery Electric\n\nGod Is an Astronaut\n\nLift to Experience\n\nBoris\n\nEsmerine"
