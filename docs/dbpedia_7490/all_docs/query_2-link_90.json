        "text": "Trying to work out exactly what post-rock is is almost as impossible as getting half a dozen prog fans to agree on what progressive rock is. These days almost everyone has their own take on what a particular genre should be. But in broader terms (and risking the wrath of the purists), post-rock is all about creating non-rock sounds using standard rock instrumentation. So it’s all about things such as the atmospherics and cinematic scope of the music rather than the verse-chorus-verse song structure.\n\nThe term was coined by music writer Simon Reynolds while reviewing the 1994 Bark Psychosis album Hex. But, as you will see from our own list, the musical ideas had been around way before then. Post-rock may have evolved out of the indie and shoegaze scenes of the late 80s and early 90s, but it owes far more to sounds from a decade earlier, especially Krautrock, prog rock, space rock, ambient and even jazz, and these days the influence of post-rock can be found in the likes of math rock, drone music and even post-metal.\n\nThe dronal qualities of the Velvet Underground are an early pointer to the development of post-rock and later elements of David Bowie, especially his excursions into Kraut with “Heroes” and Low, and later still John Lydon’s appropriation of the genre with Public Image Ltd. The eclectic approach of John Peel’s BBC radio show, giving airtime to bands such as Sonic Youth, My Bloody Valentine, Spacemen 3 and more would have also played a part in the amalgamation of styles in post-rock for a band such as Mogwai.\n\nStylistically, progressive rock then might appear to be at odds with Peel’s post-punk ethos, even if he’d been a fan of some of it in his earlier days. Yet prog, as much as post-punk, remains very much at the heart of where post-rock has developed. In his book Storm Static Sleep: A Pathway Through Post-Rock music writer Jack Chuter discusses the genre’s impact with Simon Reynolds, who told him: “Within the progressive music currents of the late 60s onwards you get post-rock-like occurrences”.\n\nThis goes some way to explaining the popularity of bands such as Talk Talk, Sigur Rós and Wire with many prog fans today.\n\nBut post-rock is about more than just prog. It might be music that continues to take the listener on a journey, but very often it does so with its use of shifting dynamics and atmosphere."
