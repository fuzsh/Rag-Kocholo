        "text": "Dark, spare, emotionally intense, quiet (except when it wasn’t) — the sound of “Spiderland” somehow sublimates the energy of Midwest hardcore into a meditative, almost hypnotic exploration of negative space. Its sometimes off-kilter rhythms, repetitive instrumental passages, and hushed vocals were picked up on by a future generation of bands labeled as post-rock.\n\n“[When I listen to it now] I just hear a band really focused and really trying hard to make an album,” says Brian McMahan, one of the group’s two guitarists and its primary vocalist, “something that would stand up to other records that we enjoyed and considered classic or timeless. We were pretty wildly ambitious and just kind of naive. It was coming from just a bunch of kids, but we were definitely giving it our best shot.”\n\nThe influence of “Spiderland” came in the form of a slow burn. It continued to sell several thousand copies each year, gradually gaining a spotless cachet among listeners in the know. (Placement of cathartic album closer “Good Morning, Captain” on the soundtrack for the 1995 film “Kids” helped too.)\n\nEspecially in a pre-Wikipedia age, the band was cloaked in mystique.\n\nThe “Spiderland” cover, dominated by a black-and-white photograph of the four musicians swimming in a desolate quarry (only their heads are visible), didn’t note the name of the band or the album. The lyrics told elliptical tales of a vomiting fortuneteller and a shipwrecked sea captain.\n\nBut this enigmatic impenetrability was matched with uncommon intimacy — the back cover solicited “interested female vocalists” and listed the home address of drummer Britt Walford’s parents, in whose basement the band practiced. (P.J. Harvey was among those who inquired, and the Walfords have continued to receive Slint fan mail for years.) Crucially, McMahan’s lyrics were not so much sung as whispered urgently, as if over a crackling late-night phone line.\n\nThe band hardly ever toured. It reunited in 2005 to play the All Tomorrow’s Parties festival and then a run of shows. Subsequent reunions in 2007 and 2013 yielded a little more road time. But a 10-show tour kicking off at Paradise Rock Club on Tuesday, for which Slint will feature “Spiderland” in its entirety, offers a rare chance to see the band onstage.\n\nDebut album “Tweez” was a harsher and louder affair, its short, gnarly songs twisting in strange shapes and substituting in-studio chatter and the occasional screaming refrain for traditional lead vocals. Between records, this group of irreverent, prank-playing hardcore kids immersed itself in Delta blues, country music, and songwriter-poets like Leonard Cohen and Neil Young. (“Good morning, captain” is the opening phrase of Jimmie Rodgers’s 1930 song “Mule Skinner Blues.”)\n\n“I think having those influences produced a different frame of mind,” guitarist David Pajo says. “It is kind of hard to make a direct connection with those bands when you listen to ‘Spiderland,’ but we didn’t want to just imitate what they did, we were taking the elements that we liked.”\n\nBesides their lower volume and notably clean guitar tone, the simplicity and emotional directness of Slint’s next songs reflect these influences.\n\nSlint rehearsed the “Spiderland” songs as instrumentals. When they added vocals in the studio, it shifted the overall feel considerably. “Oh man, it changed it,” Pajo says. “Brian kind of opened up his heart in a way that I would never ask him to do again, and I don’t know if he even wants to do again.”\n\nIn a documentary film by Lance Bangs accompanying a lavish, three-LP reissue of the album, Walford describes his bandmate as dripping with sweat after recording his vocals. McMahan says he checked himself into a hospital afterward.\n\nSoon after he said he’d had enough, and the others decided not to continue without him.\n\n“It seemed like some of the wind was taken out of our sails and honestly, maybe I wasn’t up for trying to rally and go through that same process again,” McMahan says. “I think that it was probably a better move not to do further work than to pursue it at that point in time. I’m just speaking for myself here, but I think it worked out fine,” he says.\n\nAfter its breakup, the lore around the band was intensified by the on-again, off-again prominence of its members’ other work. Walford moonlighted, under a pseudonym, as the drummer on The Breeders’ first releases. McMahan led the well-regarded group The For Carnation until 2000, when he put music aside totally and became a union electrician. Pajo joined Tortoise before becoming a visiting gunslinger for groups like Billy Corgan’s Zwan, Interpol, and most recently the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.\n\nBut the result of that rushed weekend of recording, nearly 25 years ago, stays relevant.\n\n“I think for a full decade I couldn’t even listen to ‘Spiderland’ because I just felt like it was unfinished,” Pajo says. “Now I can actually appreciate it for what it is.”"
