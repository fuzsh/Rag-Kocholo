Camoufleur is fantastic, I am just wondering if people think that I should then look into some David Grubbs, Slint, or other things, some before others...or what. Any recommendations or personal preferences are totally welcome.\n\nApr 13, 2006 at 12:55 AM Post #2 of 16\n\nDavey\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nNov 5, 2002\n\nPosts\n\n1,574\n\nLikes\n\n13\n\nYeah, that's a big can of worms you open with that whole Chicago post rock and pop scene. Tons of great music. I made a post about some of it recently as on offshoot of a John Fahey thing which you might like reading ...\n\nhttp://www6.head-fi.org/forums/showt...26#post1886126\n\nBut if you get into Slint, which is a good move, although some new comers don't really get these days what the big deal was, some of David Pajo's later stuff, and Will Oldham too, are really worth checking out on the folkier side, along with Califone and some of my other favorites like Eleventh Dream Day. Lots of interconnected bands. Throw in Streolab too who have been kind of Chicago based at times with O'Rourke and Tortoise's John McEntire helping in production/engineering. O'Rourke also produced the last EP from Brainiac in 1997 which was to be their intro to the majors, but the main guy was killed in a car wreck and the other main guy moved on to form Enon. But that last \"Electro-shock for President\" EP has some pretty cool stuff. Much more herky jerky new wave than the others mentioned. And the story could go on and on\n\nApr 13, 2006 at 2:29 AM Post #3 of 16\n\nnewbalance\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nMar 26, 2006\n\nPosts\n\n139\n\nLikes\n\n0\n\ncool, appreciated, esp. coming from an avid primitive guitar fan\n\nApr 13, 2006 at 5:52 PM Post #4 of 16\n\nVicAjax\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nJan 16, 2004\n\nPosts\n\n4,622\n\nLikes\n\n13\n\nyou can't go wrong with the Thrill Jockey label.\n\nalong with Gastr del Sol and Tortoise, i'd highly recommend The Sea and Cake. my favorite album is The Fawn. they got their name from Sam Prekop's mishearing the title of the Gastr del Sol song, \"The C in Cake.\" that's off of Crookt Crackt or Fly, which i really enjoy.\n\nyou may also dig the Nashville outfit Lambchop... chamber-country-funk combo that calls itself \"the most ******** up band in Nashville.\"\n\nas for Stereolab, i highly recommend starting with Emperor Tomato Ketchup. they recorded about half of it with O'Rourke in Chicago.\n\nif you like Tortoise, check out Isotope 217, specifically the album The Unstable Molecule.\n\nand if you can find it, try the album Bilé Inferno by Czech rockers Iva Bittova and Vladimir Vaclavec... it's absolutely brilliant... Gastr fans are guaranteed to love it. it's also extremely well-recorded... good enough to be a reference album.\n\nApr 13, 2006 at 6:35 PM Post #5 of 16\n\nDavey\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nNov 5, 2002\n\nPosts\n\n1,574\n\nLikes\n\n13\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by newbalance\n\ncool, appreciated, esp. coming from an avid primitive guitar fan\n\nYeah, O'Rourke has even penned some of the liner notes on Fahey reissues. I guess he's a major fan. The EP he did after Eureka called \"Halfway to a Threeway\" is just as good or better than Eureka, although very short. He has one of the biggest discography of credits of anyone I know. You get the feeling that he must work about 20 hours a day.\n\nAnother band I really like that reminds me some of O'Rourke's Eureka is the Moonbabies from Sweden. They did one a couple years ago called \"The Orange Billboard\" that's great, with lots of Beatles and Yo La Tengo sound, along with sounding kind of like an adventurous O'Rourke production.\n\nhttp://stevehoffman.tv/forums/showth...162#post517162\n\nApr 14, 2006 at 12:50 PM Post #6 of 16\n\ngratefulshrink\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nMay 12, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n1,689\n\nLikes\n\n15\n\nWell, if you go in the Slint direction, what about Polvo? Good mid-90's \"math rock\" sound. I never see them mentioned arojund her, however.\n\nAnother vote for Califone and Stereolab.\n\nFor some reason, this thread made me think of Roy Montgomery, Charalambides, and John Fahey.\n\nApr 14, 2006 at 2:28 PM Post #7 of 16\n\nDavey\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nNov 5, 2002\n\nPosts\n\n1,574\n\nLikes\n\n13\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by gratefulshrink\n\nFor some reason, this thread made me think of Roy Montgomery...\n\nI know you're a fan of that 70s Krautrock by Klaus Schulze and his pioneering Ash Ra Tempel debut since I've seen one of your guides at amazon, and now it looks like you are a fan of Roy Montgomery as well, so do you know Hash Jar Tempo? It's a collaboration between Roy Montgomery and Bardo Pond. If not, check out Well Oiled from 1997, which is a long suite in seven movements from a session that was improvised in 1995. If you love that instrumental psychedelic rock, this is the real buzz, formed from the groundwork by the Velvet Underground, Pink Floyd, the Doors, Hawkwind, and other visionaries in the psych world. I also have Under Glass from a couple years later, which is very good too, if maybe just a small step below and a bit more experimental.\n\nAs you might guess by the Ash Ra Tempel referencing name, they have a lot of Krautrock in their soul. Bardo Pond has a pretty dense drone sound which I do really like, especially on their own Dilate, but with Roy Montgomery they clean up the sound and turn it into more of an ambient feel. Kind of a soundtrack to a lazy day. But Ash Ra Tempel, they were the real deal...\n\nApr 14, 2006 at 5:50 PM Post #8 of 16\n\ns m @\n\n1000+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nJan 23, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n1,154\n\nLikes\n\n11\n\nDon't really feel like starting a new thread for this since there are obviously a few people reading this one that like them, so: Can I get a few Califone recommendations?\n\nI once heard them (don't know what it was exactly) and liked it, and it seems like the kind of sound I wouldn't mind trying to get into now.\n\nOh, and it's no secret that both of Slint's albums (Spiderland and Tweeze, probably in that order) are great.\n\nApr 14, 2006 at 6:29 PM Post #9 of 16\n\nDavey\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nNov 5, 2002\n\nPosts\n\n1,574\n\nLikes\n\n13\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by s m @\n\nDon't really feel like starting a new thread for this since there are obviously a few people reading this one that like them, so: Can I get a few Califone recommendations?\n\nLove them all including the Red Red Meat albums that preceded Califone, but I'd recommend first to get Quicksand/Cradlesnakes which is probably their best and most fully realized album. It really has everything that makes these guys so good. I made a big post about it not long ago with a bunch of my own thoughts, along with some from a few others at ...\n\nhttp://www6.head-fi.org/forums/showp...94&postcount=5\n\nStill available from some sources on vinyl since it's on Thrill Jockey. They also just reissued what will probably always be my my favorite dose of Califone, Roomsound from 2001. Maybe ask DLeeWebb what he thinks since he's kind of a newbie. I'm not a very good judge since I love it all.\n\nApr 14, 2006 at 7:35 PM Post #10 of 16\n\ngratefulshrink\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nMay 12, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n1,689\n\nLikes\n\n15\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Davey\n\nI know you're a fan of that 70s Krautrock by Klaus Schulze and his pioneering Ash Ra Tempel debut since I've seen one of your guides at amazon, and now it looks like you are a fan of Roy Montgomery as well, so do you know Hash Jar Tempo?

I also wernt through a huge Flying Saucer Attack phase, as well as Jessamine. Out of all those bands, I end up listening to Jessamine the most. I also sampled a lot of the the Kranky label around that time. Later I got more into the VHF catalog, especially Sunroof! and Pelt, but the Vibracathedral orchestra really might be my favoirte of that whole genre (whatever it is).\n\nApr 15, 2006 at 1:37 AM Post #11 of 16\n\nnewbalance\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nMar 26, 2006\n\nPosts\n\n139\n\nLikes\n\n0\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by VicAjax\n\nyou can't go wrong with the Thrill Jockey label.\n\nalong with Gastr del Sol and Tortoise, i'd highly recommend The Sea and Cake. my favorite album is The Fawn.\n\nI totally agree, I have been a huge post-rock fan for awhile and especially of tortoise and the sea and cake (I however prefer the album One Bedroom [check out the song sound and vision!!]) but thanks much for referencing Thrill Jockey, looking into it ive found quite a few sounds that agree very much with me and my sr 225's!!!

There are lots of Slint-a-like bands, but nothing will be the same as the original; it's unique. Then there's also the Slint-side projects: The For Carnation, Tortoise, Evergreen.\n\nI don't know anything about Gastr Del Sol, but based on this topic, I think it's about time I had a listen.\n\nApr 15, 2006 at 11:35 AM Post #13 of 16\n\ns m @\n\n1000+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nJan 23, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n1,154\n\nLikes\n\n11\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Davey\n\nI'd recommend first to get Quicksand/Cradlesnakes which is probably their best and most fully realized album.......
