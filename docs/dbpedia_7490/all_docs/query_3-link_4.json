        "text": "1989 studio album by Slint\n\nTweezStudio album by ReleasedJuly 1989RecordedAutumn 1987Studio\n\nStudiomedia\n\n(Evanston, Illinois)\n\nGenreMath rock[1]Length29:27LabelJennifer Hartman (original release)\n\nTouch and Go (1993 reissue)ProducerSteve AlbiniSlint chronology\n\nTweez\n\n(1989) Spiderland\n\n(1991)\n\nTweez is the debut studio album by American rock band Slint and the only studio recording released before their disbandment. It was originally released on the label Jennifer Hartman Records in 1989 as the only record put out by the label, which was run by their friend, Jennifer Hartman. It is the only Slint album to feature bassist Ethan Buckler.\n\nThe album was reissued by Touch and Go Records in 1993 after the group's follow-up, Spiderland, began to generate a cult following.\n\nTweez was recorded at Studiomedia in Evanston, Illinois, and was produced by Steve Albini.\n\nAll of the album's song titles are taken from the names of the band members' parents,[2] with the exception of \"Rhoda\", which was named after drummer Britt Walford's dog: \"Ron\" and \"Charlotte\" are named for Walford's parents, \"Nan Ding\" and \"Darlene\" for guitarist David Pajo's, \"Carol\" and \"Kent\" for guitarist and vocalist Brian McMahan's and \"Warren\" and \"Pat\" for those of bassist Ethan Buckler.\n\nOn the vinyl version of the album, the individual sides of the record are labelled and given in the track listing as \"Bemis\" and \"Gerber\".\n\nThe cover art for Tweez features a photo of a Saab 900 S, with the Saab logo on the grille replaced with \"Slint\" and the album’s title, “Tweez” on the grille. On the vinyl version of the album, both labels feature parodies of the Saab logo, with \"Slint\" replacing \"Saab\" and the name of either side of the album (Bemis and Gerber) replacing \"Scania.\" Additionally, a figure can vaguely be seen sitting in the drivers side of the vehicle, through the windshield. This was years later revealed in the 2014 documentary Breadcrumb Trail to be fellow Louisville musician and friend of the band Will Oldham, wearing a crash helmet. On CD and cassette versions of the album, the message \"This recording is meant to be listened to on vinyl.\" can be seen on the back.\n\nThe Saab still belongs to its original owner, Jeffrey B. Richardson, MD. In the late 1980’s, Dr. Richardson encountered drummer Britt Walford’s father, Ron, at a Bardstown Road car wash in Louisville who pitched the idea of using Richardson’s Saab for the album. The “royalty” paid to Richardson for the use of the Saab was a bottle of Maker’s Mark bourbon.\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[3]NME7/10[4]The Rolling Stone Album Guide[5]Select4/5[6]Spin Alternative Record Guide4/10[7]\n\nThe album has received generally mixed to positive reviews.\n\nJohn Bush of AllMusic described the album as \"a fine, if bizarre recording, often switching from bass-led rhythm to rhythm in the same song.\"[3]\n\nThe vinyl sides are referred to as \"Bemis\" and \"Gerber\".\n\nSlint\n\nDavid Pajo – guitar\n\nBrian McMahan – guitar, vocals\n\nBritt Walford – drums, vocals\n\nEthan Buckler – bass guitar\n\nGuest Musicians\n\nEdgar Blossom – vocals on \"Warren\"\n\nTechnical\n\nSteve Albini (credited as \"some fuckin' derd niffer\") – engineering\n\nJoe Oldham – cover photography\n\nLisa Owen – cover design"
