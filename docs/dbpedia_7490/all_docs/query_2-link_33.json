        "text": "Tortoise was much more interesting live than on record IMHO. The Sea and Cake I love, at least a certain time frame from them - The Biz, The Fawn, and Oui are all great albums. Not sure they would be OP's cup of tea though.\n\nI'm going to guess OP would enjoy a lot of bands on the Temporary Residence label, some of which were already mentioned.\n\nI have to say I much prefer the Simon Reynolds definition of post-rock over a lot of the instrumental indie bands that exploded in the late 90s/early 2000s and the whole \"crescendo core\" thing which grows tiring for me very quickly.\n\nAgree that Sea and Cake is recommendation into a different space. Definitely lacking the electronic element of the Reynolds definition (although many “crescendo core” - which is a hilarious term!- stalwarts also lack this dimension). They are in the space of moving beyond traditional rock cliches, though, but that goes back to post-punk as well with its eschewal of blues scales.\n\nThe crescendo core idea, sums up what makes a lot of post rock tedious for me. Godspeed were so fresh to my ears when I heard their first album. The follow-up EP and double album were also excellent. But by Yanqui it felt like a formula that had been mastered and now needed no repeating. Looking back, that first album had so much more than the “crescendo” thing. Lots of drone. Melodic bits. And the found sounds.\n\nWhen I started exploring Mogwai and others in the “you like Godspeed so you might like...” category, I enjoyed some of it, but none of it felt as fresh as those first Godspeed listens.\n\nBy contrast, a band like Tortoise had proven more rewarding over time I think because of a) the evolving electronic dimensions (although Mogwai have dabbled in this space too), and b) the jazz influences which give them a far broader vocabulary than the average post rock band with massive pedal boards (and I say this as a guitarist with a big pedal board and limited jazz vocabulary!)."
