        "text": "The steady build up to the release of this debut album from soulful South East London singer Andreya Triana positioned her as an artist with impeccable credentials. An appearance with Flying Lotus on ‘Tea Leaf Dancers’ - from the Reset EP in 2007 - was the first inkling of a major talent emerging. Then, Triana hooked up with downtempo chill-out producer Simon Green, aka Bonobo, to contribute to his Black Sands album. Together, Bonobo and Triana sliced up a vast soporific landscape in which to work, where they could serenely slide into a comatose state while concocting quiet moments of 3am musical euphoria. All that’s missing from this further collaboration between the pair, titled Lost Where I Belong, is a husky voiced DJ to whisk us into the witching hour in-between each song.\n\nAnyone familiar with ‘A Town Called Obsolete’, the single released ahead of this record, may be in for a surprise when they get to grips with an entire album from Triana. That track positioned her close to the hackneyed trip-hop idiom, with its half-speed breakbeats and disconsolate vocal pining, albeit executed with a greater ache and genuine feel for despondency than the average sub-Massive Attack efforts that clutter up the genre. Instead, much of Lost Where I Belong abandons such affectations and goes straight for the jugular, with Bonobo and Triana severing all the fat with ruthless aplomb, leaving only her voice and a few mere morsels of instrumentation to get the job done.\n\nIn fact, much of this album feels like it has undergone a process of attrition to get to the root of what makes Triana tick. The arrangements are simply a fulcrum around which her vocals are allowed to shine, and the nine-track set comes in at a paltry 37-minutes — a mercifully brief stretch of time in the contemporary R&B world. But this is a record that pulls on influences from far outside the straight up soulful stylings that Triana’s vocals would be matched with in lesser hands. Opener ‘Draw the Stars’ gives her a chance to wrap a blackened lament around twinkling xylophone and amiable strings that swell and retreat with supreme grace and subtlety. There’s a light/dark contrast at work in much of the music here, with Triana’s vocals gripped tightly by the doldrums, while little crevices of illumination are chinked into the arrangements and act as a welcome respite from her sadly crooned woe."
