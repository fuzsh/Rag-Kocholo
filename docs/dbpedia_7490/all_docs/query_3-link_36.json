        "text": "First of all, here is my argument in a single sentence. A lot of guitar rock gets released every year, but the genre is basically just recycling the past endlessly and stopped being experimental a long time ago.\n\nNow, I listen to a lot of guitar rock, I always have done, but it tends to be music from the past rather than new things. The reason for that is simple; guitar rock doesn’t surprise me any more. The music doesn’t take risks, it doesn’t say anything new and it simply isn’t experimental or looking to bring new things to the party. The only new(ish) guitar-based acts that I have ever liked enough to spend money on are hardly new anyway, and they are The War On Drugs and White Denim, neither of whom could be classified as ground-breaking, although I like what they do a lot.\n\nIf we take a trip back to the Sixties, bands with guitars pretty much ruled. They were out there on the cutting edge of sound. the guitar player was God. It wasn’t necessarily about virtuosity, although that was definitely a huge part of the story. What it was about was pushing the instrument and the technology as far as it would go, and then pushing it further. There were people who were pioneers. We all have our favourites, but the point is that they were doing new things. It might have been the freeform noise that Pete Townshend was introducing into the music of The Who or the pyrotechnics of the likes of Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix, but it was all new. It was about making an old thing, usually the Blues and making it into a new thing. It was revolutionary, bold, experimental. It was going to a place where there weren’t any maps.\n\nThere were people who were taking the sonic confusion even further; The Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd and the Velvet Underground were all exploring what could (and occasionally what couldn’t) be done, although Pink Floyd eventually decided that the sonic cutting edge wasn’t as much fun as having the biggest-selling album of the 1970s and selling out stadiums, although that led to a massive implosion for them in the end.\n\nThe 1960s was a time of huge musical fervour and experimentation, much of it led by guitar music. It is easy to look back and hear innovations, to find the weird and wonderful and to hear doors being kicked open. However, I am not going to take a trip down memory lane, because the point here is that somewhere between the 60s and now, guitar rock ran out of ideas.\n\nWhen did this happen? My feeling is that by the 1990s the whole guitar band thing was pretty much on its last legs. If we look at the USA, dull conformist stadium rock and anodyne country was dominant. Where was the big new guitar thing? Perhaps the sad and early death of the Great Experimenter Jerry Garcia in 1995 was symbolic? Who knows? We can’t be too smug about the state of UK music either, although the faux-60s styling of Britpop certainly produced a pretty boring smugness about our bogus Cool Britannia status. I am not going to call all Britpop crap, although around 95% of it was, because it did produce two bands who rose above the general morass, and they were Suede (for a while) and Pulp, but they did so by sidestepping the whole guitar band thing, in some respects, and did it with clever songwriting, especially in the case of Pulp. That leads me on to Radiohead, who were definitely pushing on and redefining what stadium rock could have been, but their most interesting music was still ahead, and that depended them on abandoning the guitar rock things and embracing electronica, skittery drum and bass stylings and arcane instruments.\n\nBritpop, together with Grunge in the USA pretty much destroyed the idea of guitar bands as innovators. Grunge was just bog standard American guitar rock with added angst and emotional howling, despite where it started. Unhappily, it ended up with Pearl Jam as stadium rockers and their appalling tribute act, Nickelback (who definitely killed the genre off).\n\nIf we look at where the experimental guys and gals (mainly guys) ended up, we have to look outside the world of guitar bands. We might look at people like Van Der Graaf Generator, Gentle Giant, King Crimson, Soft Machine and others who were inventing a new thing (which no one called “prog” in those days), or we might follow the Softs into jazzier waters and look at fusion and the pyrotechnics of the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Isotope and Return To Forever, to name but three. Whatever it was, it wasn’t guitar rock.\n\nThere were people in the States doing odd things too. For me, Sonic Youth seem to be a significant example of how to take the Velvet Underground noise model and see how far you can bend it before it breaks. Still, once you have broken it, where do you go next? For Thurston Moore, and perhaps also for J. Mascis, you keep on keeping on, making music that is essentially what you were doing 20 years ago. It is music I like, but is it still experimental and innovative?\n\nSo, what is guitar rock these days? There is still a lot of it about. Steve Lamacq on 6 Music champions guitar bands, but they are all really, really dull. Punk is still around, but it is hardly an innovator, it is the same old same old forty years on. Boring. Indie rock is smug and conservative (in musical terms) and heavy metal hasn’t produced any new ideas for decades. Slayer and Metallica were game changers in the 90s, but the game is now as ossified as all the other variations on white boy guitar rock. To be honest, I cannot see how guitar rock is ever going to innovate again. Perhaps it cannot. Perhaps it has run out of ideas, perhaps you can’t find any more ways of doing things to make it sound new. That brings me back to White Denim. I like them, but they are basically sticking to a clever-clever reworking of 70s white guitar rock, a bit Doobies, a bit Steely Dan and a bit of this and that. When it works, great, but is it new?"
