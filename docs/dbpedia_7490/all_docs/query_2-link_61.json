        "text": "Amazing album.\n\nIt was considered a classic even by the mid-90's. There was that Albini review. There was frequent play on college radio. There was the sterling reputation of Touch & Go records. There was the huge and immediate influence both on post rock bands (who took most everything of the sound) and hardcore (who took selectively the math guitar riffs and screams). There was David Pajo, who spent time in like a dozen notable bands afterwards.\n\nIf you want bands that sound a lot like Slint, I would suggest first Rodan -Rusty. For many years this was considered almost a sister album to Spiderland, coming out a few years later from the same scene. There's most of the discography of June of 44.\n\nFor bands that are more Slint-adjacent, it's probably like half of late 90's indie rock. Shellac and Tar are the first two that come to mind for some reason.\n\nRorschach feels like they’re from a later era to me but I double checked and there was some overlap in the time both bands were around. I wonder if the Slint guys were tuned into them. They did a tour with Danzig when they were very young so I assumed they were at least Misfits fans\n\nTheir previous bands (Squirrel Bait and others) were punk bands in the mold of Husker Du and Black Flag. So I bet they were Misfits fans, but I don't hear any direct influence from the Misfits on Slint.\n\nThe Slint guitar sound and riff style when it goes full distorted can sometimes remind of a more controlled, low-key Rorschach. Rorschach was a big deal at the time in hardcore at least in NYC. I can't be sure though.\n\nMoss Icon was pretty ahead of its time for math rock / emo, and Slint vocals sound a bit like Moss Icon. But it must have been pretty obscure at the time, so who knows.\n\nI guess I should have listed Sonic Youth as well.\n\nSquirrel Bait's two records are probably, when put together, my favorite two dozen songs from any band in the 1980s, other than possibly the Go-Betweens. They were around for such a short time.\n\nNever heard these guys BITD, but I saw a reunion show a few years ago. The played between a surprise reunion of Swiz and a scheduled reunion of Soul Side. They were kind of overly serious and tedious. I probably would have loved them in the ‘80s/‘90s, but in the 2010’s I just wasn’t feeling it.\n\nAlso on the topic of Slint and hardcore, I was at a record store last week and talking with the guy there about 90s hardcore bands. He brought up Guilt from KY, who I’d never listened to in the 90s, but described them as Slint-influenced. I definitely hear it in their Further EP.\n\nI saw the Tweez LP in a record store in Derby many years ago. I regretted not picking it up, especially as it was only a fiver like every other record in the rack. At the time, vinyl wasn't especially popular.\n\nMoss Icon was a cult band in DIY hardcore circles well before their stuff came out on CD in the mid/late 90s. That was actually a very anticipated release at the time. Ebullition Records kept one of their 12''s in print for years, both before and after the CD was released. Discogs says 1997 for the first MI CD comp, but I'm not 100% sure that's accurate. I'll have to look at my copy at some point for any identifying info. Sometimes that's hard to find on releases like this.\n\nI wouldn't really consider any of those bands \"screamo\" BTW, and FWIW I hate that term. No one really used it in the 90s, it's basically something that was invented on internet boards years later.\n\nEngine Down were one of those bands that were excellent live but their studio recordings were kinda bland IMHO. I never understood the hype around Rye Coalition as their music did nothing for me. Sleepytime Trio were pretty good from memory, but suffered from poor quality recordings. I liked early ATDI but when they went the slick pseudo-major route, I couldn't stand them.\n\nMy 2 cents...\n\nGuilt were very underrated. Many people simply didn't appreciate them at the time and they shot themselves in the foot by signing a deal with Victory, who weren't a good fit for the band's sound. Go listen to Bardstown Ugly Box sometime. It was recorded by Bob Weston and sounds a lot like Slint and Rodan at times but it's much heavier. I think it's their best work, but the Further EP is pretty good too. The earlier stuff originally released on Initial Records is much more raw. Years back the band self-released a CD that compiled all the pre-Victory stuff and some demos.\n\nI did really like the Bardstown record too! I was mostly surprised that Guilt never crossed my radar back then since I was very into other KY hc bands. Especially By the Grace of God. I’ll have to seek out that pre-Victory comp. thanks for the heads up!\n\nMy favorite band from Louisville was Falling Forward, but barely anyone talks about them anymore. The fact that their stuff has been OOP for years doesn't help either."
