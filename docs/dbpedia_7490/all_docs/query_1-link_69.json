        "text": "'Breadcrumb Trail' doc tells the story of Slint\n\nWhen the modern Louisville music scene is discussed on a national scale, its essence and mythologies dissected, it doesn't take long for Slint to be mentioned. First two sentences, usually. Three, max.\n\nSlint is the band that launched a sound that in turn galvanized a hundred bands in cities across the United States and Europe. It was music built with an intense precision, played by teenagers who seemed to be reading each other's minds, and in many ways it announced a new kind of rock music.\n\nBut by the time the band's influential \"Spiderland\" album was released in 1991, Slint had already split up. It wasn't acrimonious. Brian McMahan, Britt Walford, Todd Brashear and Dave Pajo were barely out of their teens and simply had other things to do.\n\nMeanwhile, the cult of Slint grew to a size disproportionate to reality. As \"Spiderland\" grew in stature, Slint was analyzed, revered and mythologized with absolutely no input from anyone actually in the band. Slint was long gone, resulting in an inherent mystery that only added to what McMahan now calls \"the veil\" around the band.\n\nThe real Slint is revealed in \"Breadcrumb Trail,\" a 90-minute documentary by filmmaker Lance Bangs that pays tribute to \"Spiderland\" even as it presents the band in a way that many fans won't recognize. It will be screened Monday at Headliners Music Hall, with Bangs and band members attending for a Q&A session.\n\n\"We were really just super nerdy dudes playing in a basement,\" said McMahan, laughing. \"That was the quintessential Slint experience.\"\n\nMore music news\n\nBangs is perhaps best known for his work on the \"Jackass\" franchise, but has a rich history of making acclaimed music videos (Pavement, White Stripes, Sonic Youth) and was the documentarian for films such as \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Where the Wild Things Are.\"\n\nWhile living in Athens, Ga., in the 1990s, Bangs often traveled to Louisville to check out its music scene and made a lot of friends, including Walford. McMahan said the film is clearly the work of a Slint fan, but one who is also an experienced filmmaker more interested in truth than myth.\n\n\"My first response seeing it was, 'Oh, dang, this is gonna take the wind out of some people's sails.' But ultimately his telling of the story is all very affectionate, and sort of warm,\" McMahan said. \"I think the band will come off as a group of odd, but totally everyday sort of people.\n\n\"The people who are going to be left sort of deflated are definitely the ones really attached to, sort of, the music personified. It definitely pulls away the veil, for sure.\"\n\nSlint's collective nerdiness and oddball humor are on full display in the film, McMahan said, painting a distinctly different picture from the popular conception that it was a band filled with brooding teenagers well on their way into the heart of darkness. That conception is largely linked to \"Spiderland.\"\n\nThe band's first album was 1989's \"Tweez,\" with Ethan Buckler on bass instead of Brashear, and it's more of a traditional hardcore punk album, although the template for \"Spiderland\" is clearly obvious. \"Spiderland\" is a far different beast, and its scale, confidence and peculiar, haunting sense of drama still resonate throughout underground rock.\n\nTouch & Go records will release a deluxe box set of the album on Tuesday, with three CDs and two LPs filled with bonus material. At $150, it quickly sold out through pre-orders. To celebrate, McMahan, Walford and Pajo will do a handful of shows, augmented by Matt Jensik.\n\nOne will be Tuesday night at Louisville's Nelligan Hall, 2010 Portland Ave., with Wishgift. Keep an eye on the band's Facebook page (www.facebook.com/Slint) for ticket information.\n\n\"Spiderland\" still sounds like the work of aliens, not teenagers in an East End basement. It's easy to see why fans assigned mystical powers and a dark back story to the band; outside of Louisville, few people knew them and they had played only a handful of shows before splitting up.\n\nIn a pre-Internet world, Slint was built for mystery. \"Breadcrumb Trail\" will show that \"Spiderland\" was the result of obsessive work.\n\n\"The film is sort of a myth-buster,\" McMahan said. \"It's not a super clinical look at our rehearsals, or a step-by-step look into the studio. It's more a look at each of the personalities involved with historical reference points along the way. (Bangs) did a good job of contextualizing the punk ethos of the time, and the environment that Slint came out of. That is sort of the background of the film, how all of this fit together and how we were a product of our environment.\"\n\nBetween the film and another round of interviews and shows, including a set at the Forecastle Festival this summer, it seems as if the myths surrounding \"Spiderland\" can finally be put down. But what's left is arguably more interesting: that four weirdly goofball friends came together in 1990 to create a sound that no one had heard before, and no one has successfully replicated since.\n\nJeffrey Lee Puckett can be reached at (502) 582-4160, jpuckett@courier-journal.com and on Twitter, @JLeePuckett.\n\nSLINT DOCUMENTARY\n\nWHAT: \"Breadcrumb Trail,\" followed by Q&A\n\nWHEN: 7 p.m. Monday, ages 14 and up\n\nWHERE: Headliners Music Hall, 1386 Lexington Road\n\nCOST: $10, available at the venue, Wild & Woolly Video and online at www.headlinerslouisville.com\n\nSLINT IN CONCERT\n\nWHEN: 7 p.m. Tuesday\n\nWHERE: Nelligan Hall, 2010 Portland Ave."
