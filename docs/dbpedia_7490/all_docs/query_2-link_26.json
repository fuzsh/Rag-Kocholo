Yeah, there was some rubbish in the charts then too, but at least there was diversity. Some early rave and hip-hop in there, the start of Madchester with the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, but also the odd operatic piece, and stuff like The Blow Monkeys and All About Eve that seems very adult. Plus there'd always be metal bands like GnR and WASP in there.\n\nProbably me showing my age, but I had the misfortune of listening to the Top 40 recently and to me it just sounds like the same song played 40 times.\n\nPost by South Wirral Blue on\n\nListening to Gold Radio all the hits from 50s 60s 70s & 80s when music was music\n\nI've got into a bit of lockdown routine of watching the Top of the Pops reruns from the late '80s. on BBC Four\n\nIt's sad really seeing how esteemed the charts used to be compared to what it is now. Yeah, there was some rubbish in the charts then too, but at least there was diversity. Some early rave and hip-hop in there, the start of Madchester with the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, but also the odd operatic piece, and stuff like The Blow Monkeys and All About Eve that seems very adult.

Not sure I can sit down and listen to an album though!\n\nIn keeping with my post-punk tastes, the new Protomartyr album is a real grower, and I also love 'Tower of Age' by a band called Lithics, although it's way too abstract to be widely liked!\n\nPost by jedthehumanoid on\n\nEnjoying the new Mogwai single - you sort of know what you're going to get with them at this point but I'm fine with that, they're still great. Colin Stetson makes an appearance on the album too so that should be interesting when it's released.\n\nAlso been listening to a lot of The Handsome Family recently after picking up the anniversary edition of Through The Trees. The bonus CD has a live recording from Telford's Warehouse circa 2001. If 16 year old me had known what I know now I'd have been there.\n\nPost by jedthehumanoid on\n\nBest albums of 2020?\n\nI will sugggest:\n\nFontaines D.C. - A Hero's Death\n\nSorry - 925\n\nSweeping Promises - Hunger For a Way Out\n\nRolling Blackouts Coastal Fever - Sideways to New Italy\n\nGirls in Synthesis - Now Here's an Echo from Your Future\n\nLithics - Tower of Age\n\nFiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters\n\nMush - 3-D Routine\n\nDeftones - Ohms\n\nMetz - Atlas Vending\n\nMy personal favourites...\n\nErland Cooper - Hether Blether\n\nMoses Boyd - Dark Matter\n\nNorth Atlantic Drift - Pillars\n\nOrville Peck - Show Pony EP\n\nJulianna Barwick - Healing is a Miracle\n\nPictish Trail - Thumb World\n\nMirry - Mirry\n\nThe Soft Pink Truth - Shall We Go on Sinning So That Grace May Increase?\n\nAnd not really new (just a stripped back re-recording) but The Sophtware Slump on a Wooden Piano by Grandaddy is great."
