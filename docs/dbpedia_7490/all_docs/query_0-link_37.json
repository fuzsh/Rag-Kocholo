        "text": "LISTS The Untold History of UK Post-Rock By Louis Pattison · July 16, 2024\n\nIt’s the winter of 1995 when Tortoise, a group from Chicago out on their first international tour, touch down in London. They’re just one album and a few singles old, but as they set up their equipment onstage at the Water Rats, a live music pub just down the road from King’s Cross station, the scale of their ambition quickly becomes clear. Before long, the venue’s small stage is thronged with guitars and samplers; a vibraphone and a marimba; and not just one but two drum kits.\n\nThree school friends, Kieran Hebden, Adem Ilhan, and Sam Jeffers, are watching from the audience. Today, Hebden is well-known as the Grammy-winning DJ, producer, and occasional Skrillex collaborator Four Tet. But back in 1995, he was a kid from the London suburb of Putney, who’d found himself smitten by the sound of those early Tortoise records: cerebral but rhythmic, influenced by a range of styles—from dub to jazz to classical minimalism—yet distinct, even singular.\n\n“I was so excited,” recalls Hebden. “Just seeing the crazy mixture of instruments and equipment on stage had me gripped. They opened the show with ‘Gamera,’ and when the two drum kits kicked in halfway through the song, it changed my life. It gave me a sense that so much more was possible from a live band than I’d previously understood.”\n\nBefore long, Hebden, Ilhan, and Jeffers were playing in their own group, Fridge; Hebden on guitar, Ilhan on bass, and Jeffers on drums. During lunch breaks, they’d get together in a school rehearsal room and experiment. “There were obviously ‘post-rock’ things that had come before, but we really didn’t know about them, we were too young,” remembers Jeffers, who was just 17 when Fridge recorded their debut album Ceephax. “The only stuff we knew about was what was being written in the music press or playing gigs in London. A lot of it was American, and those bands seemed cooler, more innovative, better players.”\n\nOver the next few years, though, Fridge found their footing, firing off a number of increasingly accomplished singles and carving out their own sound in the process. In this respect, they were hardly unique: just one of a legion of groups who had laid their hands on a landmark post-rock record—Bark Psychosis’s meditative, melancholic 1994 debut Hex, perhaps, or the slow-burning gothic fantasia of Slint’s 1991 LP Spiderland—and set out to do it their way.\n\nPost-rock is the rare genre you can pretty much trace right back to a single source. The term was popularized by the critic Simon Reynolds, whose 1994 feature for British music magazine The Wire highlighted UK groups like Seefeel, Disco Inferno, and Main. By Reynolds’ definition, the post-rockers employed “rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbres and textures rather than riffs and power chords.” Reynolds also pointed to the growing availability of digital technology—a factor which, in the UK, felt particularly crucial. Whereas breakout Chicago post-rock groups like Tortoise and Isotope 217 naturally found themselves in dialogue with their home city’s jazz players, in the UK, cross-pollinations occurred between bands and various homegrown strains of electronic music: notably jungle, the sounds emerging from club chill-out rooms, and the more abstracted dance music released by labels like Warp and Rephlex.\n\n“To me, that period felt like a thrillingly fluid and adventurous time musically, and a really great time to be actively involved in it,” says Dave Howell, who published the post-rock fanzine Obsessive Eye between 1995 and 1997 before joining FatCat as an A&R man. “Most of the people I was hanging around with then would have been going to clubs, to band gigs, to drum & bass nights, as well as to improv things through the decade. There was this big sense of openness and keenness to learn and to share our different interests and backgrounds that felt like a kind of hothouse education.”\n\nFatCat, along with other forward-thinking UK imprints like The Leaf Label, Too Pure, Lo Recordings, and Domino would platform a wave of post-rock acts springing up across the UK. Up in Leeds, brothers Chris and Richard Adams were making a melancholy, windswept lo-fi as Hood. Way out west in Bristol, Movietone, Crescent and Flying Saucer Attack were exploring hushed, folk-inflected songcraft and zoned-out feedback. In Glasgow, Ganger were refining an elastic, danceable sound focused on the interplay of bass and drums. In Birmingham, Pram and later Broadcast wove a curious kitchen-sink psychedelia that hovered somewhere between the past and the future. All these groups were looking for something beyond the familiar rock of the day. Still, the beauty of this era was there was no consensus about what that post in post-rock meant: Everything was in flux, and exactly how the music of tomorrow would sound was up for grabs.\n\nSome post-rock groups hit it big. Stereolab cannily blended their avant-garde experimental urges with a tunefulness derived from 1960s French pop and bossa nova. Mogwai—the rare example of an outspoken and charismatic post-rock band—took a long and roundabout route to success, finally scoring a UK No.1 with their 10th album, As The Love Continues, in 2021. Ilhan and Jeffers from Fridge argue for Radiohead as a band who successfully took the ideas of post-rock and transplanted them into a mainstream context with “the fresh approach to their references, the band/studio/production blur, the energetic search for a sum greater than the parts,” says Ilhan.\n\nBut not all British post-rock got its due. The UK music press, fond as it is of big tunes and big personalities, struggled to process this often low-key and deliberately anonymous music. Around the turn of the millennium, groups like The Strokes and The White Stripes proposed a return to earlier eras of rock ‘n’ roll that, for all its retrogressive urges, was undeniably seductive. Around the same time, there was the sense the meaning of post-rock was shifting. Post-Mogwai, post-Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the sound seemed to harden into formula, coming to mean a largely instrumental music focused around a particular dynamic: play quiet, then loud, then quiet again. Post-rock as a genre would persist, but some of its initial freedom had been lost.\n\nBelow, a number of underground, overlooked, or otherwise forgotten groups operating in five particularly fertile years between 1996 and 2001, the period in which UK post-rock was still underground, experimental, and creatively wide-open.\n\nSeefeel\n\n(Ch​-​Vox) Redux (1996)\n\nSeefeel was one of the original post-rock groups that Simon Reynolds highlighted in The Wire, and in many ways, they were the group that evidenced his premise. Here was a band that began as a fairly conventional shoegazing rock concern, but gradually severed ties with rock music altogether through a forward-thinking ethos and the application of digital technology.\n\nEarly on, Seefeel fell into the orbit of Richard D. James, aka Aphex Twin, who remixed their track “Time To Find Me”. As repayment, Seefeel agreed to create an album for release through James’s imprint, Rephlex. (Ch-Vox) is a true vision of rock abstracted. Guitars and vocals are processed into angelic cries and wafts of neon ambience; rhythms, where they appear, manifest as strange cardiac pulsations. The whole thing feels isolated and otherworldly.\n\nAfterwards, Seefeel went on an extended hiatus and (Ch-Vox) soon fell out of print. It was reissued in 2021, freshly mastered from the original DAT transfers by Pole’s Stefan Betke.\n\nPhilosopher’s Stone\n\nPreparation (1997)\n\nPhilosopher’s Stone’s Preparation may be one of the most unsung records in all of British post-rock. The album was the work of one Gareth Mitchell, a guitar experimentalist who had played live in Amp and also alongside Flying Saucer Attack’s David Pearce in a vestigial Bristol group called The Secret Garden. Released through the post-rock label, Chicago’s Kranky, Preparation finds Mitchell using his guitar as a textural tool, experimenting with looping, sampling, and musique concrète techniques.\n\nBut what distinguishes Philosopher’s Stone from your garden-variety guitar droning is the project’s distinctly mystical qualities. Preparation’s track titles allude to alchemy and numerology, while Mitchell brings his own lonely choirboy vocal to bear on the majestic “Where Regrets End.” A quarter-century on, Preparation still sounds cryptic and mysterious.\n\nHood\n\nRustic Houses, Forlorn Valleys (1997)\n\nHood‘s music seems rooted in a distinctly English soundworld—the sustained grey drizzle of a wet weekend. Formed around the core unit of brothers Chris and Richard Adams, the group evolved from their early lo-fi beginnings to adopt a melancholy sound that transposed the ethereal atmospheres of Bark Psychosis and the brambly guitar tangles of Slint to the environs of their native Yorkshire.\n\nLater, on 2001’s Cold House, Hood embraced a sort of Kid A-indebted electronica, collaborating with Dose One and Why? of the U.S. avant-rap collective Anticon. But perhaps their finest moment is their debut for Domino, Rustic Houses, Forlorn Valleys. Produced in collaboration with Matt Elliot, aka Third Eye Foundation, its six tracks take strummed guitars, drones of woodwind, and the occasional meek vocal and wind them into an impeccably gloomy sound.\n\nFridge\n\nEph (1999)\n\nFridge’s first two albums, 1997’s Ceefax and 1998’s Semaphore, were intermittently interesting but felt very much like the work of a band testing out ideas. By their third album, Eph, the trio were hitting their stride, refining a sparkling instrumental sound that blends live and sequenced rhythms and simmering electronics with a warm, cosmic feel derived from Alice Coltrane’s Journey In Satchidananda.\n\nA standalone double A-side single released alongside Eph contained the track “Kinoshita.” “When we made that, we were obsessed with Alice Coltrane and [UK garage DJ and producer] MJ Cole. His single ‘Sincere’ had just come out and had a big impact on us,” recalls Hebden. “It’s one of the best Fridge tracks, I think, and has aged well for me.” That same year, Hebden would channel those influences and more besides into his debut solo record as Four Tet, Dialogue.\n\nRothko\n\nA Negative For Francis (1999)\n\nEmerging in 1998, the London trio Rothko raised eyebrows through their idiosyncratic instrumentation—not just one, or even two, but three bass guitars? With that setup, you might assume their sound to be limited. But the group’s debut album A Negative for Francis is anything but, assembling 16 tracks that range from gracefully layered neo-classical (“Roads Become Rivers”) to combustible dronescapes (“Shadowless Self”) to gentle oceanic wanderings (“Not Growing Out Of Growing Into”).\n\nUnder the leadership of founder Mark Beazley, Rothko would grow and change over the years, releasing for labels including Too Pure and Bella Union and enlisting a string of guest musicians and vocalists. They remain active to this day.\n\nFonn\n\nField 831 (1999)\n\nFonn were something like the FatCat house band, a collective of musicians brought together by label co-founder Dave Cawley with an open-ended exploratory brief. Their sessions took place at an old cowshed at a farm in Sussex, with members of other FatCat groups, such as the improv trio LiveHuman, dropping by.\n\nFonn’s two releases, both released in 1999, feel open-ended and off-the-cuff, patching together droning motorik, Tortoise-like jamming, and abstract electronica. “I guess the aim was something like Faust,” says Dave Howell, who played guitar on a track on the group’s sole album Field 831. “The results were a bit patchy but give a good sense of the openness and cross-pollination that was going on back then. As far as I remember, Fonn only played a few shows, but one of those was opening for Godspeed You! Black Emperor on their first London show.”\n\nEardrum\n\nLast Light (1999)\n\nEardrum were Lou Ciccotelli and Richard Olatunde Baker, two skilled percussionists who had played with everyone from African drum groups to avant-garde units like Laika and Kevin “The Bug” Martin’s early noise rock ensemble, GOD. The duo’s debut album for The Leaf Label is an exploration of rhythm that still feels cutting-edge in its approach and ambitions.\n\nLargely improvised, with Ciccotelli and Baker assisted by a small cadre of other musicians, tracks like “Swarm” and “Plummet” see drums, flute, trumpet, and saxophone subjected to radical live processing, drawing on the methods of dub pioneer Lee “Scratch” Perry and the global improv of Jon Hassell.\n\nPram\n\nThe Museum Of Imaginary Animals (2000)\n\nMany of the acts on this list drew inspiration from post-rock as a cultural moment. That was decidedly not true of Pram. This Birmingham group seemed to occupy their own private universe, one self-contained enough that you feel their career would have panned out more or less the same way no matter what was occurring outside of its borders.\n\nDrawing inspiration from Can, Sun Ra, and The Raincoats, their home recorded music blurs the boundaries between tinpot invention and cosmic exploration; that they have been known to rest their synthesizers on ironing boards during live performances is very telling. 2000’s The Museum Of Imaginary Animals is a neat way into their catalog: A collection of otherworldly lullabies swaddled in music box melodies, chugging krautrock rhythms, and scurrying flute, clarinet, and trumpet.\n\nBilly Mahonie\n\nWhat Becomes Before (2001)\n\nAs a new century dawned, the meaning of post-rock was shifting from Simon Reynolds’s original concept as a new crop of bands discovered Slint’s Spiderland and the groups carrying its torch, from their Louisville kin like Rodan to Scottish upstarts Mogwai. These post-rock bands accentuated the rock, even as they upset its familiar rhythms through unusual time signatures and scorching dynamic shifts.\n\nOne such band was Billy Mahonie. A quartet from London, their first two albums (1999’s The Big Dig, for Too Pure, and 2001’s What Becomes Before, for Southern Records) explore an instrumental rock sound that zig-zags between cerebral introspection and athletic headbanger riffing. Billy Mahonie have been intermittently operational over the years and, after a protracted silence, they returned in May 2024 with their first album in 14 years, Field Of Heads.\n\nAereogramme\n\nA Story In White (2001)\n\nGlasgow’s Aereogramme had plenty going for them when they emerged around the turn of the century. They had pedigree (vocalist/guitarist Craig Beaton had spent time in another well-regarded Scottish post-rock group, Ganger) and they had the right label (Chemikal Underground, which had previously launched the likes of Mogwai, Arab Strap, and The Delgados). They also had a distinctive sound: Their debut album, A Story In White, channels the quiet-loud fireworks of Mogwai, but with vocals that swing from brutality to delicacy in a heartbeat.\n\nIn retrospect, Aereogramme feel like the last gasp for a particular era of British post-rock. They never quite found their audience and following four albums they split in 2007, citing “the never-ending financial struggle coupled with an almost superhuman ability to dodge the zeitgeist.” But it wasn’t the end for guitarist Iain Cook, who would hit it big in his next band, Chvrches."
