        "text": "If Tortoise came out of their shell, it might sound like this. From Progressive Jazz into almost math-rock psychedelia, sounding close to Senser and Mr Bungle without Mike Patton, the album opens up with what can only be described as some kind of weird post-rock crossover. ‘red snake awakens /// HIBERNATION SICKNESS’ is a full-on math-rock opus, sounding not too dissimilar to Axes if they were featuring on a Japanese Anime about Megacity Robots.\n\nPowerful, harmonising guitars and crazy time signatures abound in ‘holomarket /// GT LIFE’, this is music for people who veer more towards the intellectual side of things but without acting like a chin stroking twat. It’s got 80’s Manga prog-metal seeping through its very core and the musicianship of the band is exceptional. It’s tight, powerful, no-shits-given performance only makes you want to stand in front of them and watch it all happen live.\n\nWith giant robots and Bladerunner all around you, ‘retrieving the arrow /// KING OF SWINE‘ sucks you into an insane guitar scratching, solo twiddling, drum smashing concoction of massively produced post-rock, with some fear inducing bits to keep you awake at night. It’s a humongous head trip of really cool ideas and creative prowess, eclectic beyond measure and full of raw energy.\n\n‘champagne funeral /// THE INTERNATIONAL RICH LADS PARTY ANTHEM’ goes from the staple math-rock into some kind of cod reggae meets Ozric Tentacles, before transitioning into a tom-filled drum paradise of headbanging mastery riddled with space-rock metal guitars and epic guitar melodies. ‘another time, out of time /// THEME FROM A SILENT FILM (IN TWO ACTS)‘ has a super 80’s intro with what sounds like the theme from a VHS thriller and with its almost alien-like structure, moves into what the Wild West might sound like if it were inhabited by androids. Perhaps if Ennio Morriccone had been a post-rock guitar masher in some alternative Japanese Universe with trumpets and big male vocal choirs, this is the kind of music he’d make.\n\n‘just returning cockpit pressure /// PHANTOMILE’ brings more math-rock to the table, with an underbelly of metal riffs and guitar synths that sweep into melodic soundscapes and then back into tightly structured bundles of metal. ‘ceremonial tears /// WATER PALACE HYPER RACEWAY‘ has a gorgeous arpeggiated synth leading into jangling, chorus guitars before jumping impatiently back into the choppy, metal-fuelled rifftastic sound slowly becoming embedded into your very core with every thoughtfully placed note.\n\nOne of the nice things to mention about ‘APEX EMOTION’ is that the album “tells the story of RED SNAKE; a world champion racing driver and international playboy who finds himself in cryogenic stasis after a near fatal accident on the track, only to awaken three-hundred and thirty-three years in the future to a nightmarish cyberpunk megacity. He vows to return to the thrill of the race in this foreign time and compete in the PHANTOMILE at the WATER PALACE HYPER RACEWAY but standing in his way is the dominant force in future hyper racing, KING OF SWINE”, which might not sound like ‘Tommy’ by The Who or ‘Lamb Lies Down On Broadway’ by Genesis but quite fantastically, the music really paints a picture all by itself.\n\nWithout even reading about the concept, you can get an idea of what they are creating through the music and that’s no mean feat in the world of music, particularly with this kind of genre.\n\nThis is an album needing a good few listens but one that leaves an immediate impression, sparks the imagination and has a level of style and presentation not heard for a considerable amount of time. It most definitely requires two listens in a row and three might teleport you into the very cyberpunk megacity they’re weaving into the fabric of reality. Be careful in there!\n\nLike what you see?

The Blackpool based outfit are made up of four musicians who had been playing in bands of varying styles for years, finally combining forces for their most ambitious project. To be fair, Blanket have not fucked around since their formation. Last year saw the quartet tour hard in support of the EP, ink a deal with Music For Nations and finish work on this here debut full length.\n\n‘How To Let Go‘ is an album that tugs at your heart strings from the word go. Its title track opens up with a sky scraping piece of post-rock; dramatic piano chords and soaring guitar work fill up your ears, sounding like the musical equivalent of standing at the edge of the biggest mountain with your arms aloft. It’s that sense of euphoria that runs through the record, coupled with theatrical twists and shimmering melodic motifs that pack an emotional punch. If you enjoy the orchestral like majesty of Maybeshewill or possibly the more considered, electronic pulse of later day 65daysofstatic, you’ll get a real buzz from this.\n\nThere’s quite a few reference points on this album I’ve picked up on, but it’s when Blanket start combining sounds together that this piece really starts to shine. ‘Worlds Collide‘ brings vocoders into the mix for some purely stunning harmonic results, ‘This Moment Right Here‘ really lets rip with more building vocal work punctuated by a colossal riff, while ‘Let The Sleepers Awake‘ starts with a melodic hardcore inspired melody. It’s these little glimpses into different sonic pallets that keeps it varied and interesting.\n\nProbably the most striking moment in the tracklist is penultimate track ‘A Sky Filled With Ghosts’. It’s reminiscent of alt-rock weirdos Mew in places, especially in the sweet falsetto vocal delivery, while its instrumental flickers from subtly textured indie-rock to hard hitting alt-rock. But it’s the return of the vocoded vocals that make for an extremely climatic conclusion that is nothing short of hair raising. I remember seeing the band play this live last year and was hoping that it would sound just as eventful as I remembered.\n\nMany have called Blanket a cinematic rock act and you can clearly tell that a lot of these songs have been composed with either imagery in mind or inspired by film. I think that’s part of its charm, it’s a very widescreen sounding piece and each track paints a vivid picture. I read that the band formed ideas for the album by jamming in their home conservatory, inspired by watching life go by, concentrating on the skyline. It’s that visual that sells this album to me – it might not have the most original sound, but feelings of ambition and emotion flow thick and fast through it.\n\nThe stronger moments on ‘How To Let Go’ come from when Blanket are either rocking out or letting the vocals come through, but I do think they tend to let the post-rock rule book get in the way at times. However, in the same breath, it’s the restraint into these neat little alt-rock nudges coupled with truly stunning production that makes for a genuinely compelling and effective debut.\n\nLike what you see?

Black Emperor have dived straight back into being an active band and show little signs of slowing down. ‘Luciferian Towers‘ is their third long player since their comeback LP in 2012, sixth in total, and as always has been greeted with much excitement from their extremely loyal fan-base. I must admit, it’s taken me a while to understand why Godspeed have such a huge following, but the more that I study their back catalogue the more I appreciate the huge, sprawling soundscapes that they so expertly craft.\n\nFor me, it’s all about the build with Godspeed. I love those huge walls of noise that they so intricately construct and when they reach that explosive climax, when it comes crashing down in a blaze of glory, it is nothing but euphoric. Patience is definitely a virtue when listening to Godspeed and on Luciferian Towers, the payoffs are huge!\n\nOpening track ‘Undoing A Luciferian Towers‘ is a pretty menacing intro, as you are hit with a descending vortex of noise. Trumpets and saxophone howl and squeal around two pummelling drum kits to create this apocalyptic jazz freak-out. But weirdly, there is no feeling of impending doom, it just feels like it’s working out where to go, how to get to the light and it does. Ride cymbals crash in and on the final minute we are absorbed in this bewilderingly beautiful melody. That’s what I get from the record; there is a lot of bleakness to sift through but you are rewarded with moments of pure lushness.\n\nI love how little motifs are brought back throughout the record. The warm swirling melody that completes the opening track is reprised at the end of ‘Fam/ Famine‘, which until that point combines warm swirls of violin with pulsating throbs of sub-bass and string stabs for another beguilingly haunting passage.\n\n‘Bosses Hang‘ and ‘Anthem For No State‘ take the bulk of the record up but are both split into three parts. Bosses Hang begins with fuzzed up guitars and soaring strings that crash into this mountain scaling post-rock breakdown. It is nothing short of breathtaking. We are next taken into this calm yet psychedelic path before exploding into a volcano of screeching violins and roaring guitars that takes us to new sonic heights of splendour!\n\nAnthem Of The State is a much more slow burning affair that begins gentle and gracious, but as feedback rolls in for a finale, it brings back the descending vortex we hear at the start of the record. Thunderous drums and wailing guitars bring in a final riff that builds to an extremely dramatic conclusion. It may not be the uplifting ending I was expecting, but it is very powerful and incredibly euphoric!\n\nAlthough Luciferian Towers is a winding, spiralling piece of music that goes through many twists and turns, it’s probably Godspeed’s most digestible record to date. This is down to the strength of the melodies constructed and without the drone-driven tones of older material, it makes for a stronger flow and, if anything, intensifies the power of its crescendos. Don’t get me wrong, there is a lot to take in here and this still requires your full attention, but overall ‘Luciferian Towers‘ sees Godspeed You! Black Emperor at their most powerful, fearless and beautiful.\n\nLike what you see?

They sounded a bit like if Arcane Roots and Muse had a very handsome baby together – the combination of filthy riffs and impressive vocal talent (from both the guitarist and the bassist) delivering an incredible vast sound from this three piece. Their drummer blistered away with greatly detailed parts behind the wall of sound being delivered by the guitarist and bassist, making Trigger Thumb definitely a band to watch.\n\nThis lead onto Envoys, playing their first hometown show fresh off their appearance at this years ArcTanGent and one of their first jaunts out with their new bassist – who seamlessly fits into the mix of the band, sitting as the juicy rhythm-section meat with the drummer between the two whole-wheat bread guitar players, providing the audience with a riff filled sandwich to be savoured. Envoys don’t mess around, instantly going into a collection of ethereal & winding riffs, showing a great use of space in their music, throwing some emotive vocals into the mix every now and again. The sense of atmosphere Envoys can create with such little materials to hand is impressive to say the least, making them the new best friend of any big time Post-Rock fans in the audience.\n\nRiff mongers Body Hound then set up to play and are the first band I’ve ever seen to have the crowd move back. A controversial move to open with, but it seemed well advised once the bass player ignored the stage for the majority of the set, proceeding to karate chop the air with his instrument and run around performing a two step/ballet routine for the next half hour. Body Hound did exactly what they do best – make everyone gurn. The complex, head spinning riffs motivating the crowd to attempt moving along to the odd-metres and time-signatures, in turn motivating the band to do the bunny hop. It was an incredibly fun set – more notes than I ever thought could be played in a thirty minute period were unleashed with ferocity upon me, Body Hound all the while keeping it very professional – what a band.\n\nThus lead to the headliners, Lost In The Riots, the riff pedalling Londoners jumping straight into a deep set of big hooky riffs, full of fast and heavy beats. They are in the same vein of incredibly motivational and dance-worthy instrumental bands like And So I Watch You From Afar and Axes, only with much more emphasis on brutally heavy breakdown riffs. There was little patience from Lost In The Riots, with their music being all GO all the time, demonstrating great deals of urgency and showing the band as being incredibly pro-active and well rehearsed in their craft. I felt like I had the energy I had been previously lacking to finish that cleaning and also like I was gonna two-step whilst I did it following their set.\n\nAll in all, it was a very good night – all of the bands put on were excellent. Stu did a phenomenal job of booking a cracker of a lineup and I drank my weight in Orange Juice for the whole night. Top drawer.\n\nLike what you see?

From knowing them however, it was seemingly never really about that for them. History is revisionist and is written by the “winners”, but as they’re no longer with us, we’re all losers… and if there’s any revision to be made, it’s to plant them firmly on the musical road map where they deserve to be.\n\nKendal and latterly Barrow-In-Furness probably aren’t the first places you’d go looking for a fertile and expressive music scene. However, it takes a special kind of utter, picturesque boredom to urge a group of teens to get together and create something so wildly complex, elastically grooving, expansive and taught all at the same time. It’s the sound of three people simultaneously expressing themselves and experimenting with sonics in a way that only comes along and coalesces in a certain beautiful way, very infrequently.\n\nThe mid-late 2000s were a strange time for a lot of bands that I knew in Manchester. There seemed to be a ton of people who’d been playing for a few years and making their own weird and wonderful noises, who realised there were others vaguely like them, in mind set if not sound. We’d be joining each other frequently to play (pretty much TO each other) in dank basement venues that smelled of shit, on line ups that we would each put on for a few pound coins.\n\n(One of the biggest influences of this nascent scene has to be Phil who ran Beat Promotions, an absolute gent and champion of amazing music from all genres. He really did it for the love of music because he was getting paid fuck all, giving most – if not all – the money to the bands, engineering and promoting the shows himself to save on overheads)\n\nIt was after post-hardcore, during post-rock, and pre-Math rock in that particular subsection of grimy Manchester underground. There was a lot of grasping around in the dark to find ‘your sound’, and then Arficeden would rock up and smash out these incredible, awe-inspiring, deafeningly loud sets that made you want to cry with frustration. Invariably you’d have to play after them and try and salvage some modicum of self-respect from your set.\n\nThe first time I really saw them, I’d not been expecting what was to unfold before me. Having gone in with little to no idea who they were, I ended up having to pick my jaw up off the floor on the way out. Tracks like ‘Japan‘ and ‘Penny for the Middleman‘ were brutalising when amped up to the nth degree, but always retained that huge wide screen cinematic breadth. Med’s guitar playing was always a topic of discussion between other players: “How’s he getting those noises?” “What pedals does he use?” Then you’d go and check after they had played and it’d be the most simplistic set up in the world. Just a whole lot of skill and vision.\n\nStu’s bass playing was equal parts groovy and off kilter. Jumping around the beat like it was attached with a slightly over-stretched elastic band that could snap back on the kick drum at any given moment, and never one to shy away from electronic noise, he managed to incorporate otherworldly distorted samples and glitches to enhance rather than muddy the songs. Finally, the mutable Dan Payne on drums. A force of nature when behind the kit, a mere slip of a boy when we first met him but wiser in his playing than most people I know today, able to defy what rational sense dictated was ‘a drum beat in a song’. Dan’s playing seemed to evolve from gig to gig, where you had a general sense of how a song should go, but he wasn’t ready to quite let himself get bored by a set structure or beat.\n\nIn these recordings, there are a lot of tropes, sounds, textures and ways of playing that we now take for granted, as the proliferation of post/math rock in the UK has spread far and wide. However, Arficeden stood alongside bands like Burnst, Hot Bone and GNOD, on the beach throwing the stones into the water, making ripples that would become the tidal wave of Math Rock in the UK. Listening specifically to ‘DOMO CD CIDEX‘ sadly only hints at a much bigger, much richer, sonic experience, one that I still long for today. Japan now brings back lots of memories of standing around in gleeful anticipation, waiting to hear a bunch of amazing noise come flying at your entire being for half an hour or so. Then it’d be over and you’d be all the better off, but also saddened by its passing.\n\nTo add to that sadness, ‘ceden didn’t go out with a bang. They retreated away to go reclaim their lives, to go do ‘new stuff’ as well as other stuff, leaving us wondering how we could ever carry on what we each had without them being around to challenge us, to push us each time we had a gig together. I’ve begged them to get back together for ‘one last show’, but until now it’s never happened. Though thanks to this collection of noises being popped in one handy place, maybe some renewed interest will convince them that they should get back up and claim some of that limelight that they so richly deserve – and fucking play some awesome, loud, brilliant music at everyone else’s heads and bodies again.\n\nLike what you see?

It sees the multi-instrumental Brighton duo provide the live soundtrack to a collection of short films, utilising atmospheric soundscapes, thunderous drums, bowed guitar, piano, electronics and a lovely bit of trumpet, as well as strobes to create an all encapsulating work of art.\n\nThis past week in Manchester was my first Nordic Giants live experience, though I did have the chance to catch them performing at ArcTanGent in 2014, but when we arrived, the tent was rammed. With what I could gather at the time from the brief glimpse I caught, it appeared seeing them live would be more preferable in a smaller, much more intimate venue. Lucky then that Nordic Giants have just been out on a UK Headline tour! Taking in seven dates across the country, I was able to catch them Tuesday night at the wonderful Deaf Institute.\n\nI’ve heard the Nordic Giants live show being akin to a religious experience, and whilst I wouldn’t go that far, it is captivating from start to finish. The thing that immediately strikes you about the pair is their appearance. Shrouded in darkness and smoke, when you do catch a glimpse of them, they’re masked, covered in feathers and dressed in a very tribal way – like an up to date Wicker Man. Whilst one sits at the piano throughout the evening, the other spends his time between using a bow against a guitar and creating a booming sound on the drums.\n\nA lot of the songs played on the evening are from their debut album ‘A Séance Of Dark Delusions’, released last month. As well as their own expansive, gorgeous arrangements, Nordic Giants have also enlisted the help of vocal talents such as Saturday Sun (on ‘Dissolve’), Nadine Wild Palmer (on ‘Futures Dark’), and Beth Cannon (on ‘Rapture’), the latter appearing in the live version of short film released for the song. Rapture is a brilliant, intriguing tale and a cinematic masterpiece, directed, edited and self-produced by Nordic Giants. The track is tremendously dramatic, with the soaring vocals reaching almost Bjork/Kate Bush levels at points.\n\nHandpicked, award winning short films are played throughout the evening, with a post-apocalyptic theme running throughout. Some are humorous, others are peculiar and some are just jaw-dropping in story, but all are fantastic and remain in the consciousness long after the credits. One short is a brilliant slapstick animation that sees a pair of pallbearer’s transporting a coffin containing an old biddy across a treacherous landscape by foot, whilst another shows a gun-crazed dystopian city where horrible things are right around the corner. One of the shorts that really caught my eye was ‘The Last Breath’ by David Jackson, a film that follows a family on a scuba diving trip, who discover once they’ve emerged from the lake that earth’s air supply appears to have run out. It’s an incredible bit of storytelling. It also made me chuckle in that it features that geezer from Peep Show who played The Orgazoid! These shorts are really bought to life through the accompanying soundtrack from Nordic Giants, and they really develop on the original stories, creating their own in the process and making the pieces even more jarring. So jarring in fact, that a lot of the time people didn’t know when to clap, being so transfixed on the experience.\n\nMuch like how cinema audiences sometimes leave a screening in silence, in awe of the picture they’ve seen, the audience that evening at Deaf Institute was pretty much the same. After the applause had died down, the lights slowly came up and everyone filtered out – thoughts fixed on what they’d just seen. The Nordic Giants live show really is something else and certainly one to check out if you’ve not seen it before. Their album A Séance Of Dark Delusions is a masterful piece of work, and can even be purchased with a DVD that features their digital mapping work and extra digital content. For a taste of what Nordic Giants are all about and for information on their new album, head to the band’s website here.\n\nLike what you see?

The aptly titled ‘IV’ is eight tracks worth of powerful, epic post-rock that takes you on a journey. Whilst that might sound like a bit of a cliché, it’s actually true. The concept of the album follows two foxes escaping from the forest they live in as it’s ravaged by fires; a metaphor for the effect mankind has had, and sadly continues to have, on the environment. This story is captured beautifully in the animated video for ‘Oro Rojo’ released at the tail end of last year, as well as the album’s fantastic artwork.\n\nFrom the new album, first track ‘Strelka’ feels like an epic journey all by itself, opening with gentle birdsong and dogs barking, before building and building to a mighty crescendo, the last minute of which sets the precedent for the rest of the record. Then second track ‘Qarqom’ builds into a frantic sense of danger for our vulpine protagonists, hardly letting up across its lengthy running time. One of the major highlights from this striking record is the track ‘Viesca’, with its tender acoustic guitar beginnings that lead onto the intertwining strings and brass that make up the captivating ending. It’s a wonderful piece of work and a sign that Toundra are still knocking them out the park as they close in on a decade together as a band.\n\nYou can hear an exclusive stream of the record ahead of its release over on The Independent website right now!\n\nThe album is officially released on January 26th through the radical Superball Music label. Leading up its release, I spoke with guitarist Esteban about the making of IV.\n\nBCFB: Your new record ‘IV’ is set for release at the end of this month. What can you tell us about it? What can people expect this time around?\n\nEsteban: Hello and many thanks for these questions! Well, this new record is a new step for the band. We have had a lot of changes during these last two years and I think you can “hear” those changes on this new album. We wanted to create a new Toundra album but not using only the typical elements we’ve already used in the past. We have a new guitarist and we experimented a little bit more in the production process. We enjoyed this a lot. The most interesting thing is the fact that we distributed some elements in the whole album (the foxes, the forest, the fire, the video clip, the artwork, a lot of sound during the album…) and we think that every person that listens to it is going to create a different story inside the album.\n\nCan you tell us a bit about the production process? Is it right that you demoed the tracks in a particularly picturesque area of Spain?\n\nYes, we live in a big city with stressful jobs… so when you are writing a new album, sometimes you need to go out the city and be focused on the writing process. For this album, we’ve been in the mountains of Béjar in a house studio with Raúl Lorenzo (our sound tech and a great cook). We spent 2 weekends there and we enjoyed these days a lot, playing in nature.\n\nWhat are your main highlights from the new record – could you pick a favourite track?\n\nI can’t pick any one… so sorry. This is always changing. Maybe I loved one song two weeks ago and now I hate it… maybe now I love one I hated in the past…It’s always the same with our own music. You always think you could do it better and… That’s positive.\n\nThe last track on the album ‘Oro Rojo’ debuted in the public eye in December of last year, with a breathtaking animated video. The artwork for the video and the album itself is stunning. What was your decision behind choosing this track for a video and for picking the artist that you did?\n\nMy partners in the band had a clear choice in working with Jorge García in the video as director… He’s a really great artist and we’ve been fans of his stuff for years. We really like what he has done and we are really grateful. He simply has done incredible work with this song. On the other hand, it was a little bit difficult to choose just one song, but finally we decide this would work properly so… after two weeks, we all knew that “Oro Rojo” would be the right thing.\n\nWith this being your fourth record in just under ten years as a band, what’s different this time around? Where do you stand now compared to when you released ‘I’?\n\nWe’re different people in every album… every year. It’s normal when you are in a band. When we started the band I was 19 years old and right now I’m 27. We started with no expectations… any one. After the years and after some highlights, it’s impossible not to want to make progress with any project… but the really important thing here is to keep on making music we love and enjoy being in this band.\n\nTo coincide with the album’s release, the band are embarking on a European Tour in the coming months, so if you like what you heard of the album, catch them at the following dates:\n\n12.02.15 – Heretic Club, Bordeaux\n\n14.02.15 – Rocas, Luxembourg\n\n15.02.15 – Craufurd Arms, Milton Keynes\n\n16.02.15 – Sebright Arms, London\n\n17.02.15 – Bar Bloc, Glasgow\n\n18.02.15 – Clwb Ifor Bach, Cardiff\n\n19.02.15 – The Hope, Brighton\n\n20.02.15 – So What, Gouda\n\n21.02.15 – Patronaat, Haarlem\n\n22.02.15 – Vortex Surfer, Siegen\n\n24.02.15 – Headquarters, Aarhus\n\n25.02.15 – Blitz, Oslo\n\n26.02.15 – KB18, Copenhagen\n\n27.02.15 – 1000fryd, Aalborg\n\n28.02.15 – Alte Meierei, Kiel\n\n01.03.15 – AZ, Wuppertal\n\n02.03.15 – JUZ, Mannheim\n\n03.03.15 – La Gravière, Geneva\n\nLike what you see?
