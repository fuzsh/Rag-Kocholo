I've been a big Godspeed (and offshoots) fan for over a decade, and as a result of the brilliant N&G AoTM pick by @sjaygray am getting into Tortoise as well recently.

I started with their debut, Young Team, but it's also their most abrasive album- I think they pushed the quiet-loud dynamic about as far as they could, and from then on they've experimented with different sounds and textures. There are long meandering albums like Come On Die Young, or more electronic and accessible ones like Rave Tapes.

Yeah, for a long time the only \"post-rock\" I listened to was Godspeed & co. I really had no idea there were more jazz-inflected bands with the same meaningless genre applied to them but I'm enjoying that avenue as well. I've enjoyed the few DMST albums I've heard, too, though I haven't gotten too deep into them yet.\n\nSeems like as good a place as any to ask.

I'd also recommend Happy Songs For Happy People and Every Country's Sun, which are both pretty accessible. Happy Songs is a good mid-point, and ECS is an easy place to jump in.\n\nAfter Mogwai, I'd give Explosions in the Sky a go.\n\nToday only, Mogwai's latest full-lengh, Every Country's Sun, is pay-what-you-want on Bandcamp.\n\nEvery Country's Sun, by Mogwai\n\n11 track album\n\nTemporary Residence Records has been doing a thing all through the COVID crisis where each day a different album is free to pay what you want, so they're worth a follow on Bandcamp. They have quite a few good post-rock acts, like Explosions in the Sky, MONO, and Tangents, along with a lot of other great bands, like Pinback.\n\nMy personal favorite non-Godspeed is Sigur Ros' \"Aegetys Byrjum\". People fawn over ( ) but I hated, and still hate, every single vocal on that album. It's an amazing album, ruined by the grating \"it's youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\" that is every. single. vocal. Valtari is so much better.\n\n\"Hex\" by Bark Psychosis, arguably the first post-rock album. It's kind of tepid by modern standards, but it is singular and it was first. Recommended for fan of Slint's Spiderland.\n\n65daysofstatic and Russian Circles are worth checking out. picked up a russian circles album on bandcamp earlier this year, it's my \"mellow work music\" go-to. Mono is wonderful but I honestly haven't given them the attention they deserve.\n\n\"Born Into Trouble As The Sparks Fly Upwwad\" by Thee Silver Mt Zion is probably my favorite but the newer \"Fuck off get free we pour light on everything\" is pretty great, if a little rock-ish\n\nSeems like as good a place as any to ask.

It's a great mix of some of their best older material.\n\nNew Paths to Helicon Part 1 is probably my favorite mogwai track, while Rock Action is probably my favorite album by them.\n\nTheir catalog is deep, I prefer their older stuff, but their scores are quite good as well, especially Zidane and Les Revenantes\n\nSeems like as good a place as any to ask.
