This document is a thesis written by Andrea Havlíčková about Agatha Christie and her famous detective character Hercule Poirot. It provides background on the origins and development of the detective fiction genre in the late 19th/early 20th century. It discusses key figures like Edgar Allan Poe and Arthur Conan Doyle who helped establish common tropes. It also outlines the \"rules\" developed in the 1920s to define the genre, such as those proposed by Ronald Knox. The thesis then examines Agatha Christie's life and work, focusing on how two of her texts from the 1920s-1930s reflect the society of that era in Britain. It concludes with an analysis of Poirot as a detective",
