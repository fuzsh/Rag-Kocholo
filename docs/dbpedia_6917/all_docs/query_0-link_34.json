[2] Many of the paintings hang in art\n\nmuseums. [3] Each of the scenes has a rural setting. [4] Grandma Moses based the\n\npaintings on memories she had of her childhood. [5] They were fond memories of a\n\npeaceful life on farms in Virginia and northern New York. [6] Several of the paintings\n\nshow busy people, working and having fun.

These words are called articles.\n\nA and an are indefinite articles. They indicate that a noun refers to one of a general\n\ngroup. A is used before words beginning with a consonant sound; an is used before words\n\nbeginning with a vowel sound. An is also used before words beginning with the\n\nconsonant h when the h is not pronounced.\n\nEXAMPLES A lion crouched in the tall grass.\n\nThis is an excellent essay, Clarice!\n\nAn hour passed while we chose a hat for the scarecrow.\n\nThe is the definite article. It indicates that a noun refers to someone or something in\n\nparticular.\n\nEXAMPLE The blackbird sat in the cedar tree, sheltered from the rain.\n\nSometimes nouns are used as adjectives.\n\nEXAMPLES Have you ever been to an auto race? [Auto, usually a noun, is used as an\n\nadjective modifying the noun race.]\n\nIs that machine the new carpet cleaner? [Carpet, usually a noun, is used\n\nas an adjective modifying the noun cleaner.]\n\nNOTE Some pairs or groups of nouns are considered compound nouns. By checking a\n\ndictionary, you can avoid confusing a noun that is used as an adjective with a\n\nnoun that is part of a compound noun.\n\nEXAMPLES country club, blood bank, road map, United States\n\nP:14\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 1 6\n\nEXERCISE 5 Identifying Adjectives in Sentences\n\nUnderline the adjectives in each of the sentences below, and double underline the word\n\neach adjective modifies. Do not include a, an, or the.\n\nEX. 1. Onesimus developed a successful cure for smallpox in 1721.\n\n1. Smallpox is a serious disease that causes a high fever.\n\n2. Also a contagious disease, it was causing many people to die at the time.\n\n3. Onesimus based the new medicine on an old remedy he knew.\n\n4. That remedy had been a popular and common medicine in Africa.\n\n5. Onesimus was an enslaved African American.\n\n6. The Puritan leader who owned Onesimus sent the medicine to a Dr. Boylston.\n\n7. Dr. Boylston tried the remarkable medicine on three smallpox victims.\n\n8. The sick people became well.\n\n9. Onesimus did not receive immediate credit for his tremendous discovery.\n\n10. The dishonest Dr. Boylston took all credit for himself.\n\nEXERCISE 6 Using Adjectives in Sentences\n\nIn each sentence below, add interesting adjectives to modify the nouns and pronouns.\n\nWrite your sentences on your own paper.\n\nEX. 1.

[9] Too many people buy ferrets as pets and then decide\n\nthat they donât want the animals. [10] Although ferrets are timid animals, when they\n\nare frightened, they may bite. [11] That is usually when the pet owner takes the ferret\n\nto a shelter. [12] Sandee rarely gets bitten by her friendly ferrets, for she understands\n\nthat they need gentle care. [13] At Sandeeâs house, that care involves big, airy cages in\n\nan upstairs bedroom. [14] Because the ferrets enjoy running and playing, Sandee often\n\nopens the cages and lets the ferrets run through the house.

Toasters quickly became popular and were installed in kitchens and even in\n\nbedrooms.\n\n9. In 1919, a mechanic invented the pop-up toaster and filed for a patent.\n\n10. Springs and a timer were built into the new, automatic toaster.\n\nP:35\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 2 27\n\nEXERCISE 4 Using Compound Subjects and Compound Verbs\n\nto Combine Sentences\n\nCombine each of the following groups of two or three short sentences into one longer\n\nsentence by using compound subjects or compound verbs.

[Who worked? Team\n\nworked.]\n\nAcross the finish line jumped the winning frog. [What jumped? The frog\n\njumped.]\n\n(1) The subject of a sentence expressing a command or a request is always\n\nunderstood to be you, although you may not appear in the sentence.\n\nEXAMPLES Eat a balanced meal for good health. [Who is being told to eat? You eat.]\n\nPlease read me the directions again, Kim. [Who is being asked to read?\n\nYou read.]\n\n(2) The subject of a sentence never appears in a prepositional phrase.\n\nEXAMPLES A flock of birds flew above the tall pine trees. [What flew? A flock flew.\n\nBirds is the object of the preposition of.]\n\nA group of friends gathered near the doorway. [Who gathered? Group\n\ngathered. Friends is the object of the preposition of.]\n\n(3) The subject of a sentence expressing a question usually follows the verb or a part\n\nof the verb phrase.\n\nEXAMPLES Is the cat sleeping on top of the desk? [What is sleeping on top of the desk?\n\nThe cat is.]\n\nWhen was Carolyn elected president of the student council? [Who was\n\nelected? Carolyn was elected.]\n\nWere your friends early? [Who was early? Friends were.]\n\n(4) The word there or here is never the subject of a sentence.\n\nIn the following examples, the words there and here are used as adverbs telling where.\n\nEXAMPLES There are the four suitcases we want to take. [What is there? The suitcases\n\nare there.]\n\nHere is your new video game. [What is here? The game is here.]\n\nIn the following example, the word there is used as an expletiveâa word that fills out the\n\nstructure of a sentence but does not add to the meaning.\n\nEXAMPLE There are two reasons for the delay of the game. [What are? Reasons are.]\n\nP:37\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 2 29\n\nEXERCISE 5 Identifying Subjects and Verbs\n\nIn each of the sentences below, underline the subject once and the verb twice. Include all\n\nparts of a compound subject or a compound verb and all words in a verb phrase.\n\nEX. 1. At an early age, Pablo Picasso showed unusual artistic talent.\n\n1. The son of an art teacher, Picasso was born in Spain in 1881.\n\n2. At the age of twenty, he traveled to Paris for the first time.\n\n3. Picassoâs early paintings show the influence of other painters and his mastery of\n\ntraditional techniques.\n\n4. Despite the early-twentieth century popularity of Fauvism, Picasso followed his\n\nown path and questioned standard art forms.\n\n5. Picasso and Georges Braque rejected the formal use of shapes and tried to show\n\nthree dimensions in their paintings.\n\n6. Together, the two painters developed Analytical Cubism.\n\n7. Throughout their experiments with form, both common and unusual colors\n\nappeared in their artwork.\n\n8. Picasso often placed various objects in his paintings.\n\n9. His collages sometimes included newspaper, string, or wire.\n\n10. In 1917, Picassoâs interest in Classicism and his later connection with the\n\nSurrealists led to more analytical works.\n\n11. His series of paintings and drawings with unusual figures of dancers started\n\nemerging from his studio in 1923 and developed over the next ten years.\n\n12. In the 1930s, bull-fighting subjects appeared in Picassoâs paintings.\n\n13. His most important work during that time is the large mural Guernica.\n\n14. Painted in 1937, Guernica is nearly twenty-six feet long and expresses Picassoâs\n\npersonal response to the Spanish Civil War.\n\n15. Frightening images remained part of Picassoâs work through World War II.\n\nP:38\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 2 30\n\nMODULE 2: THE SENTENCE\n\nDIRECT OBJECTS AND INDIRECT OBJECTS\n\n2g A complement is a word or a group of words that completes the meaning of a\n\nverb.\n\nINCOMPLETE Jose RodrÃ­guez threw\n\nCOMPLETE Jose RodrÃ­guez threw the ball.\n\nGenerally, a sentence includes at least one complement. However, some sentences\n\ncontain only a subject and a verb.\n\nS. V. V.\n\nEXAMPLES Knute sang. Run! [The subject you is understood.]\n\nDirect objects and indirect objects are two kinds of complements.\n\n2h A direct object is a word or group of words that receives the action of a verb or\n\nshows the result of the action. A direct object tells whom or what after a\n\ntransitive verb.\n\nEXAMPLES Angelina met Susan and me at the library. [Met whom? Susan and me.]\n\nMs. Campbell recited the poem from memory. [Recited what? Poem.]\n\nNOTE For emphasis, a direct object may come before a subject and a verb.\n\nEXAMPLE What an excellent safety record the driver holds! [Holds what?\n\nRecord.]\n\n2i An indirect object is a word or group of words that comes between a transitive\n\nverb and a direct object and tells to whom or to what, or for whom or for what,\n\nthe action of the verb is done.\n\nEXAMPLES Mr. Jacobs showed our class slides of Albert Pinkham Ryderâs paintings.\n\n[Showed to whom? Class.]\n\nPedro gave the shelter his extra wool sweaters and pants. [Gave to what?\n\nShelter.]\n\nNOTE Do not confuse an adverb for a complement. Also, do not mistake a word in a\n\nprepositional phrase for a complement.\n\nEXAMPLES Janet plays well. [The adverb well tells how Janet plays.]\n\nJanet plays with the band. [The noun band is the object of the preposition\n\nwith.]\n\nP:39\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 2 31\n\nEXERCISE 6 Identifying Direct and Indirect Objects\n\nUnderline the direct objects once and indirect objects twice in each of the sentences\n\nbelow.
