played by parade)\n\nThe movie is made like the permanent answer\n\nto a familiar trivia question,\n\nWho is the most Hitchcockian director of all time?\n\nNot Brian De Palma, not Claude Chabrol,\n\nbut, surprisingly, Frank Tashlin.\n\nHe started out making Loony Tune cartoons,\n\nand was best known for such flamboyant,\n\nreflexive, media-centric comedies as\n\nThe Girl Can't Help It, and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\n\nAs well as a bunch of films starring Jerry Lewis,\n\nwho considered Tashlin his mentor.\n\nAlready, in 1965, Tashlin saw Hitchcock not\n\nas a reflector of realities, but as a fabricator of myths.\n\nHe treated Hitchcock's films\n\nas pop culture artifact to be cannibalized.\n\nHe separated Hitchcockian affect\n\nfrom Hitchcockian substance.\n\nAs a sort of one man, American New Wave.\n\nTashlin took Hitchcock as a tool box of themes and styles,\n\nthat were themselves a more crucial\n\nand central aspect of contemporary life,\n\nthan any of the events that Hitchcock depicted.\n\nHitchcock, a sort of existential moralist,\n\nfilmed ordinary people facing matters of life and death,\n\nwith a comedy that seemed cosmic.\n\nA Gods-eye toying with human destiny.\n\nTashlin brought the same sort of existential\n\ngamesmanship to people who were themselves\n\ninfused with media consciousness.\n\nKillers who played the media,\n\ndetectives who know of their media ties counterparts,\n\nand Hercule Poirot, who seems to be\n\ncultivating his public image in real time,\n\neven as he tries to solve a case.\n\nHe lives his life reflexively, as if he himself,\n\nwere a character in his own movie.\n\n(bowling ball rolls to a strike)\n\nTashlin borrows the highly inflected,\n\nriotously inventive visual styles of Hitchcock,\n\nand adds a visual comedy all his own.\n\nHe took Hitchcock not just as a master stylist,\n\nbut as a master mythologist, a fabulist.\n\nNot as a reflector of American realities,\n\nbut as a creator of psychological realities,\n\nby means of his images, moods, and stories.\n\nThe tale of mystery, of crime, and detection,\n\nis a pretext, a pre, text, for visual invention,\n\nand for the free play of imagination,\n\nthe film makers', the viewers', and even the characters'.\n\nThe complex intriqgues and elaborate plots\n\nsee to tickle what Poirot calls his little grey cells.\n\nBut, they're also a stage on which he struts.\n\nThe proximity, or rather the idea of violent death,\n\nliberates the wildest\n\nand strangest depth of creative invention,\n\nand lends the oppressive dullness of daily life,\n\nthe tailor, quitting smoking, the middle-age pot belly,\n\nthe bowling alley, the doctor's office, a jolt of energy.\n\nMurder happens rarely, but murder stories\n\nhappen all the time, as if in, all channel,\n\naround the clock play.\n\nAnd Tashlin, extracts the comedy from a world\n\nthat tells itself macabre stories for fun.\n\nThe death of the fictional victims\n\nare the life of the modern mind.\n\nIn this scene, Poirot follows the aristocrat,\n\nSir Carmichael Clarke to a casino.\n\nHe fears that the man with the initials C.C.\n\nWill be the murderer's next victim.\n\nTashlin films the gaming tables with a gleeful vigor.\n\nIn a spectacular tilt, Poirot turns up in the distance,\n\nas the unseen observer.\n\nThen, in a remarkable series of Hitchcockian\n\npoint-of-view shots, Tashlin fuses the viewer's gaze\n\nwith the detective's.\n\nTransforming the glossily stultifying formalities\n\nof the casino into a theater of horror.\n\nBut Tashlin isn't done.\n\nCatching the scent of imminent death in the air,\n\nPoirot, framed in an exhilarating crane shot,\n\nthat unifies space and time, enters\n\nthe scene of the crime and becomes the observer, observed.\n\n(suspenseful orchestral music)\n\nSir, please excuse me.\n\nThank you.\n\nSir Carmichael, Sir Carmichael.\n\nSir Carmichael\n\nPlease leave me alone.\n\nPlease listen to me sir.\n\nStand up, I want to talk to you.\n\nSir, believe me, your life is in danger.\n\nI have some questions to ask you.\n\nBelieve me, sir, your life is in danger.\n\n(dart gun fires)\n\n(patrons scream)"
