Why Conduct Research on Agatha Christie’s Work? In the first lines of his book on Agatha Christie, anticipating possible doubts or perhaps just teasing, York (2007, p.1) provides a plethora of reasons to conduct serious research on her work. Ten years later, Storm (2017, p.1) tackles the same issue in her thorough study of Christie’s first novel in German and Dutch translations. Agatha Christie might be considered a “lowbrow” writer, but she remains one of the best-selling and most translated authors in the history. She has her active fandom1 that includes incoming new generations of admirers who follow and discuss her work. Her original books and their translations are permanently reprinted, and provided in electronic Kindle versions or as audiobooks, which best confirms the lasting interest of the audience and commercial success. To illustrate, Amazon offers the following recent editions of Christie’s works (selection): The Agatha Christie Collection (General Press 2020), (The man in the brown suit (Independently published 2020), Premium Collection (Kindle, Sanctuary Publishing 2020), The Ultimate Collection (Kindle, ACC 2021), The Secret of Chimneys (MysteriousPress.com/Open Road 2021).2 Interestingly, a collection of the most popular works by Christie is available in the form of audiobooks read by the actor Hugh Fraser, known to the audience as Captain Arthur Hastings from the TV adaptations of Poirot stories which will be discussed below. What is more, Christie’s texts are used worldwide for teaching English as a foreign language. The Collins series includes her books in abbreviated and simplified versions, where selected words are underlined and explained in a glossary, the characters are listed and introduced, the cultural background is briefly outlined. The books are accompanied by CDs, as is common practice in the case of handbooks for foreign language teaching. Some of them, for instance 1 www.agathachristie.fandom.com. 2 https://www.amazon.com/s?k=agatha+christie&page=2&qid=1619934829&ref=sr_pg_2. [Accessed 2. 05. 2022].\n\n12\n\nResearch Design\n\nThe Man in the Brown Suit and Murder on the Orient Express, are available on YouTube for free, in the programme English through Story: the learner listens to the text read by a native speaker of English and simultaneously follows the subtitles displayed on the screen. In this way Christie’s prose is disseminated among the English learners, reaching those, too, who may otherwise not choose her works for pleasure reading. It is noteworthy that these easy-to-read versions can substitute translations since they may also attract the non-native speakers of English who are not focused on polishing the language but pleased to read in the original format. Christie’s stories were abundantly adopted for comics or graphic novels.3 For instance, there is a series of comic strips by François Rivière (in French and English) that includes (the dates refer to the English editions) And Then There Were None (1996; 2010), Death on the Nile (1997), Secret of Chimneys (2002), The Secret Adversary (2003), Endless Night (2003; 2010), Murder in Mesopotamia (2005; 2009), Murder on the Links (2012), Murder on the Orient Express (2007). Another series, by Marek, contains (in English) Dumb Witness (2009) and Dead Man’s Folly (2011) as well as (in French) Les oiseaux du lac Stymphale [The Stymphalean Birds] (2010) and Le couteau sur la nuque [Lord Edgware Dies] (2012). The original productions are also translated into other languages. For example, quite recently (2020), a series of seven titles was published in Poland, translated into Polish by Paweł Łapin´ski. In addition, Christie’s crime prose steadily inspires computer and video games creators. Some popular stories (the dates refer to the game release) like And Then There Were None, (2000), Peril at End House, (2009), Death on the Nile (2020), The ABC Murders, (2016), Evil under the Sun (2007), to name just a few, are available to the players from the Amazon stores. The abovementioned editions of Christie’s original works and their impact on other creative productions should suffice to confirm the existence of what can be labelled as Christie-industry, even before mentioning the films which reinforce her popularity the most. Importantly, comics, educational editions and games involve a genre change, which contributes to the revision of the very concept of adaptation that was traditionally associated with film (Sanders 2006, p.18) and now covers the whole abovementioned variety of artistic products based on a precursor text, not necessarily literary. However, the existence and expansion of those “alternative” adaptations are unlikely to supplant the film based on a precursor literary text from its central place in the category adaptation because the latter, available on TV with no 3 These terms are often treated as synonyms even though, strictly speaking, there slightly differ, mainly with regards to the targeted audience: Whilst comics are mostly associated with children or “less serious” readership, graphic novels are meant for “serious” adults.\n\nHercule Poirot on Pages\n\n13\n\nadditional costs (with some delay, big-screen films are shown on TV, too, and thus made accessible to those who did not see them before in a cinema), reach the broadest audience. The present research is devoted to film adaptations of Christie’s Poirot works. Some novels about his adventures were brought to screen more than once. They all are easily available to the interested audience. Apart from being included in TV programmes in many countries, they can be legally watched, with no expense, on some VOD platforms. For example, on www.cda.pl, the complete 1989–2013 series and several big-screen adaptations are accessible with Polish voiceover, for free. The number and variety of the abovementioned facts fully justify the research into Christie’s work as a massive cultural and social phenomenon. As a matter of fact, there are many books about Agatha Christie and her prose (e. g., Rowland 2001; Campbell 2005; York 2007; MacAllister 2001; Escott 2003; Makinen 2006; Bunson 2008; Hack 2009; Hammer 2012; Harkup 2015; Thompson 2015, Bernthal 2016; Mills and Bernthal 2019, Rolls 2022, to name just a few relatively recent ones). However, the question as to why this phenomenon should be scrutinized from the perspective of translation studies is still to be answered. Before this happens, the central figure of the works selected for this research, the detective Hercule Poirot will be introduced; he is not only the cult character of Agatha Christie’s crime fiction, but also the subject of academic investigations, to whom whole books are devoted (e. g., Hart. 1990, Aldridge 2020).\n\n1.2. Hercule Poirot on Pages Detective Hercule Poirot, alongside Miss Marple, is Christie’s flagship character, hero of thirty-three novels and fifty-one short stories. However, the border between a novel and short story seems rather arbitrary. Poirot was introduced in Christie’s debut novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles, as a Belgian immigrant to England during the First World War, a retired policeman aiming at a career as a private detective in Great Britain. His creator endowed him with brilliant intellect that serves him as the major tool in his investigations, where he uses sophisticated examination methods of physical evidence. At the same time, she deprived him of all the features that could otherwise support his attempts: youth, fitness and good looks. On many hundreds of pages that depict him at work, Poirot will have to compensate for those deficiencies. In Styles (p. 16) the narrator describes him as follows:\n\n14\n\nResearch Design\n\nPoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of his attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandyfied little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a detective, his flair had been extraordinary, and he had achieved triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\n\nThe above description is reinforced, complemented and varied in later works. Seeing that “Poirot was busy mopping his grey suit with a minute sponge” in Kidnapped, Captain Hastings observes that “[n]ever was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot” (p. 5). In Appointment, Sarah King “noted the egg-shaped head, the gigantic moustaches, the dandified appearance and the suspicious blackness of his hair” (p. 500), and Poirot himself admits: “I take everywhere my little shoecleaning outfit. Also, I take a duster. (…) I like to have the appearance soigne´.” (ibid., p. 536). In Hollow, Lady Angkattel still recalls, after years, his “white duck suit, (…) and a pink flower in his buttonhole, and black patent-leather shoes (p.16). He wears these shoes on regular occasions, like the meeting with Miss Bulstrode in Cat, where he is aware of “an insular prejudice that a headmistress might have against aged foreigners with pointed patent leather shoes” (p. 406), but also, as indicated in Appointment, in some places least suitable for these sorts of footwear, like a desert (p. 536). As is mentioned in Hallowe’en, he sticks to his favourite shoes despite the tangible discomfort they cause him (p. 244–245). Poirot likes regular shapes and symmetry. As he puts it in Davenheim “[i]t is really insupportable (…) that every hen lays an egg of a different size!” (p. 23). According to a description in Victory,” [a] certain harmless vanity was a characteristic of Poirot’s and fell into line with his general love of order and method.” (p. 5). The awareness of his own abilities is one of Poirot’s most salient features. As observed by his young friend Colin in Clocks (p. 299), “modesty was certainly not Hercule Poirot’s strong point”. In Buckle, (p.12) we read that “[h]e was a man who was accustomed to have a good opinion of himself. He was Hercule Poirot, superior in most ways to other men”. He does not hesitate to introduce himself as a very important person, as he does in Funeral (p. 214) in these words: “I am in my own line a celebrated person – I may say a most celebrated person. My gifts, in fact, are unequalled!”. Besides, he is infallible and omnisapient, at least in his own eyes, as he asserts, for instance, in Cards (p. 164): “Always I am right. It is so invariable that it startles me”, in Underdog (p. 145): “Me, I know everything” (p.145) or Metropolitan: “Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!” (p. 30). As Hastings observes in Veiled (p. 4), his friend “always imagines that the whole world is thinking and talking about Hercule Poirot”.\n\nHercule Poirot on Pages\n\n15\n\nThere are multiple references to Poirot’s working methods and working ethos. He proceeds “by methodical sifting of the evidence, by a process of reasoning (…) and by a study of the psychological possibilities.” (Appointment, p. 496). He believes most in the efficiency of logical reasoning of his “grey cells”; in his own word in Links, (p. 8). “the true work, it is done from within. The little grey cells – remember always the little grey cells, mon ami!”. As Colin Lamb puts it in Clocks (p. 312), Poirot believes that it is “perfectly possible to lie back in one’s chair, just think about it all, and come up with the answer. That it was quite unnecessary to go and question people and run about looking for clues.” In his investigations, he always aims at establishing the truth, warning the clients that it might disappoint or hurt them, destroying their strong belief in a loved person’s innocence. So, in Five (p. 18–190), he warns the young Caroline Crale that his investigations may as well exclude as prove the guilt of her late mother. Similarly, in Cypress (p.143), Doctor Lord, who is desperately trying to save the woman he loves, learns and accepts that Poirot’s examinations may confirm her guilt rather than her innocence. However, he sometimes makes an exception to this rule and lets the perpetrator go, as he does in Clou, letting the impressive Countess Rossakoff leave once she has returned the stolen jewels. Poirot’s admiration for Countess Rossakoff ’s appearance and her thief ’s skills are mightily exploited in some film adaptations and converted into a deep, lasting affectation that is not founded in any precursor text. In fact, it is only confirmed in Chest, (p. 3) that “[t]here had been a certain Russian countess – but that was long ago now. A folly of earlier days”. Another exception to Poirot’s faithfulness to the truth can be encountered in Orient, where he saves twelve killers from responsibility for their collective act of revenge, keeping the truth about their criminal act to himself. Now and then, Poirot deliberately leaves the door open for the murderer’s suicide, which is the case, for instance, in Ackroyd, where he encourages his friend Doctor Shephard to take poison, and in Nile, where he allows Jacqueline to shoot her beloved Simon before she shoots herself. There is no scarcity of open-end histories, in which Poirot communicates his results to the perpetrator(s) without a hint of his further steps, if any. So, in Flood, Rowley is prepared to be sentenced for involuntary manslaughter, whilst Lynn hopes that Poirot will not give him away (p. 454–455). In Sin, he pays a visit to Miss Penn to give it straight to her that she cheated the police reporting the valuable miniatures stolen. On several occasions Poirot is compared to a wizard or conjurer (e. g., Flood p. 258, Third p. 392, Hickory p. 84, Sin p. 17, Four, p. 190). There is little information about Poirot as a private man. It is known that he is catholic. In Flood, he prays in a catholic church (p. 312), which is worth memorizing, too, since his Catholicism is exposed by the filmmakers on several occasions. It is not certain, if he really has a brother called Achille, as mentioned in\n\n16\n\nResearch Design\n\nFour (p. 268) or the brother is just his creation, invented for the purposes of his investigations. Poirot cannot be trusted at all when it comes to the details that he provides about himself; he does not hesitate to say whatever he deems helpful in his search for the truth about others. So, in Ackroyd (p. 451), he claims to have a retarded nephew in order to locate a nearby nursing home and the man who was, as he thought, hiding there. In Cards (p. 150) he mentions his “many nieces and grandnieces” to justify the purchase of nineteen pairs of fashionable stockings which he needs to check if the suspect has a propensity to steal. In Funeral, he shows up in the Abernethies’ house under a false identity, as an interested house buyer, on behalf of a non-existent organization (p. 187). In Dumb, he collects information about the Arundel family, pretending to be writing a book (p.134). In ABC, he claims to have found the criminal’s fingerprints on the confiscated typewriter to provoke his confession (p. 265). In Cards, he confronts the murderer with a false witness of his crime (pp. 186–191), with the aim to provoke confession. To the artless and honest Hastings’s astonishment verging on disgust, Poirot can even disregard the law without hesitation. In Cheap (p.16), and Veiled (p. 11), he breaks into other people’s houses. In Underdog (p. 89), he fabricates incriminating evidence against Lily. Certainly, it is all done for the sake of the sacred truth. It is known that Poirot has never been married and maintains no romantic relationships. However, he often attracts young women as a fatherly figure, “papa Poirot”, as he puts it, for instance, in Blue (p. 225), Underdog (p.118) Star (p.11) and Veiled (p.8), or “grandpapa” in Peril (p. 34). He offers himself as a counsellor and protector, for instance to Nick in Peril, Katherine in Blue or Jacqueline in Nile. In ABC, Poirot owns a serviced apartment in London, whose address is indicated as “Whitehaven Mansions, Flat 203, at 56B ” (p.102), which testifies to his prosperity. The reader remembers him occupying just a modest room in Styles St. Mary, in the house offered to Belgian refugees by the generous Mrs Inglethorpe (Styles, p. 34), living next door to Dr Shephard in King’s Abbot in Ackroyd (p. 40), then sharing rooms with Hastings in London, Farraway Street 14 in Four (p.15). In Hollow, he appears as a proud owner of a weekend cottage in the country which he calls Resthaven (p. 139). He is a gourmet, and a frequent guest in good restaurants. In McGinty, a good meal in a restaurant is depicted as a pivotal point of his day (p. 7). In Blackbirds (p. 7) and Nile (p. 16–17), it is the restaurant where he first sees and watches the perpetrators of the crimes he will soon investigate. Poirot is reluctant to travel on boat because of his susceptibility to seasickness. He confesses to Hastings in Kidnapped (p. 27) “it is this villainous sea that troubles me! The mal de mer – it is horrible suffering!”\n\nHercule Poirot on Pages\n\n17\n\nIt is a good question to ask if Hercule Poirot, as described in Christie’s immortal works, is a good, friendly person. Some examples of his behaviour allow for doubts in this respect. In Clapham (p. 7), he finds it below his dignity to look for a missing cook, and once he reluctantly accepts – reproached by the client for serving high society only– he still wants to hide this disgraceful commission from his friend and rival, the Scotland Yard inspector Japp (p. 9). This image corresponds to his own confession in Hollow (p.141), where – having eagerly accepted Lady Angkattel’s invitation to lunch – he admits under the breath to being “a bit of a snob”. Poirot is always extremely polite to people, addressing them adequately with their honorifics, raising for them, bowing, tipping his hat and paying compliments. He gladly gives them his ear, too, if only they want to talk. But does he have a choice as a petitioner, aiming at getting information out of his interlocutors? His approach, verging on servitude and toadying, constitutes part of his method of winning people’s trust and sympathy, and then the needed information. He believes in the rule that he articulates in Clocks (p. 316): “Let them talk to you. And from their conversation always, somewhere, you will find a clue. They may be talking about their gardens or their pets or their hairdressing or their dressmaker, or their friends, or the kind of food they like. Always somewhere there will be a word that sheds light.” In Blackbirds (p. 21), he listens to the disappointed Mrs Hill’s complaints and then, on having heard what he wanted to hear, he parts “[w]ith some difficulty” and “without breaking the conversation too abruptly”. Poirot manipulates people, mainly women, first exploring their weaknesses. For instance, he boasts with his invitation to the Royal Court to soften the inaccessible fan of Royals, Mrs Bishop, in Cypress (p. 178), thus gaining her favour immediately. Not always is Poirot nice to his devoted friend and helper Captain Hastings. Observations like ”You are of such a naïve simplicity, Hastings” (Sin, p.25) or “You are blind, Hastings, blind and willfully obtuse” (Lord, p.108) exemplify what the man has to swallow to whom Poirot owes a lot: It was Hastings who recommended Poirot for his first serious case, in Styles, which triggered the Belgian sleuth’s brilliant detective’s career in England. In Kidnapped (p. 7), Poirot introduces Hastings to two high-caliber visitors with these patronizing words: “He has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.” In Metropolitan (p. 4), he says: “You have the good heart to think of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth all the little grey cells” which hurts Hastings, even though he is meanwhile used to such derogative comments. In Four (p. 41), Poirot observes, in front of a strange man: “For you, Hastings, (…) everything is far-fetched that comes not from your own imagination”. In the same novel, the loyal Hastings is advised to stop thinking: “Do not think, my friend. Leave all to\n\n18\n\nResearch Design\n\nme” (p. 196). Hastings admits in Cheap (p. 8)) that he feels underestimated by Poirot. It is noteworthy that Poirot never addresses Inspector Japp from Scotland Yard with similar expressions of disregard, although Japp allows himself quite impudent observations, like this one in Peril (p. 141): “Well, you mustn’t be depressed, old cock (…). Even if you can’t see your way clear-well-you can’t go about at your time of life and expect to have the success you used to do“. But Poirot depends on Japp, who strongly supports the efforts of his grey cells sharing helpful information collected by the police. He does so, for instance, in Clouds (p. 67–68), providing the list of the flight passengers’ luggage contents, or in Buckle (p. 57), communicating the results of the lab analyses. Moreover, he often allows Poirot to participate in or witness some police activities from which the private detective as such would be otherwise excluded. If necessary, Japp organizes police actions needed to pursue a criminal, even if he happens to be on holiday, as is the case in Peril (p.181). Perhaps it can be concluded from the above that Poirot is, or at least can be sometimes, mercenary, behaving in accordance with his interest and advantage. Undoubtedly, his overall image retrieved from Christie’s pages influences the way he is portrayed on the screen. Storm’s suggestion – relating to multiple translations – that there is not necessarily “the only one and definite Poirot (2016, p. 1) – applies to film adaptations, too.\n\n1.3. Hercule Poirot on the Screen: The Top Five Many actors portrayed Poirot in different screen versions of Christie’s crime fiction. David Suchet, who plays this role in the popular British TV series (1989– 2013) still broadcast on television worldwide, was voted in a British Period Dramas poll from September 2018 the best ever Poirot-incorporator, followed by Peter Ustinov, Kenneth Branagh, Albert Finney and Alfred Molina. Ustinov played Poirot in six films based on Agatha Christie’s novels between 1978 and 1988. This set includes Death on the Nile (1978), Evil under the Sun (1982), Thirteen at Dinner [as the American edition of Lord Edgware Dies was titled] (1985), Dead Man’s Folly (1986), Murder in Three Acts [the American variant of the title Three Act Tragedy] (1986) and Appointment with Death (1988). Branagh acts as Poirot in the films he directed himself, namely Murder on the Orient Express (2017) and Death on the Nile (2022). Finney and Molina portrayed Poirot only once each, in two different adaptations of Orient (in 1974 and 2001, respectively). Interestingly, it is Albert Finney who was nominated for an Oscar award for this role, perhaps because the film was a big, American production with a participation of famous stars like Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery or Vanessa Redgrave. His relatively poor ranking in the abovementioned poll\n\nHercule Poirot on the Screen: The Top Five\n\n19\n\nmight result from the timing, as in 2018, he competed against four more recent Poirots. David Suchet described his experience as Poirot is his best-selling book written with the assistance of Geoffrey Wansell, called Poirot and me (Suchet and Wansell 2013). These memoires provide some details about the history of the series, people involved in its production, the author’s personal contribution to the final shape of the episodes and various anecdotes from the setting. Suchet reports that he had only just started reading Christie, but then studied it intensively when he was offered Poirot’s role. This confession may surprise since the actor portrayed inspector Japp in Lord Edgware Dies with Peter Ustinov in 1985, but it confirms that the actors possibly rely on the screenplay only, without caring to reach for the existing precursor text, which – in more general terms – may account for remarkable differences between a character’s image on pages and on the screen. Suchet shares that he made more than ninety notes about the character’s specificities to be taken into consideration in his acting, from episode one throughout the whole series, the length of which was not known at that stage. Interestingly, David Suchet is 170 cm tall, thus not so little as Christie’s famous character on pages, but smaller or much smaller than his predecessors (Finney 175 cm, Branagh 177 cm, Ustinov 182 cm, Molina 189 cm). Obviously, it was not the filmmakers’ priority to copy each aspect of Poirot’s looks, as described on pages, with Poirot’s own pedantry. What is more, none of the abovementioned actors in the role of Poirot displays on the screen a moustache complying with the descriptions provided on pages. Albert Finney’s and David Suchet’s moustaches are black and stiff but not gigantic; Alfred Molina’s is black but neither stiff nor gigantic; Ustinov’s is grey and (sometimes) stiff but not gigantic, whereas Branagh’s is gigantic and stiff but grey instead of black. As regards Poirot’s behaviour and general impression, there are considerable differences between the five performances in question. Finney’s Poirot knows the etiquette necessary to be accepted in the fine society of educated and privileged people, but he does not distinguish himself in this respect. His good manners seem studied and controlled, and do not include exaggerated politeness to women. Sometimes he ignores the etiquette completely, responding brusquely to the accompanying officer’s attempt at a polite conversation or lifting the princess Dragomiroff ’s dogs from their seat to take their place, half-stretched in the corner next to the great lady, on having put the animals in his friend’s arms. Finally, he visibly enjoys himself confronting the passengers of the Orient Express, step by step, with the truth of their collective murder, having that crazy look, raising his voice and sneering. Interestingly, Poirot’s peculiarities known from Christie’s prose are all compacted in just one scene, in which he is getting ready for sleep in his compartment: He rubs in hand cream, puts on a mustache\n\n20\n\nResearch Design\n\nprotector and long white gloves, glances at a newspaper and starts folding it with due care. Molina’s Poirot comes over as modest, almost shy, relatively young man. He refers to himself as reserved and shows some emotions only during his denouement at the end. He remains quiet even if someone is rude to him or aggressive, as is, for example, Mr Arbuthnot in Orient. His politeness appears natural and is typical of quiet people. He smiles decently, sometimes instead of passing a comment. He shouts only once (at Miss Debenham, and this is not because he lost his temper but because the method requires it. Most importantly, unlike Finney’s Poirot, he does not celebrate his final performance as an opportunity to display his brilliant mind but comes straight to the point in the description of his reasoning and conclusions. He hardly uses irony and shows no mannerism pictured in other works by Christie, like this character’s grotesque pedantry. This Poirot enjoys his own idea of hiding the truth about the collective killing of the child’s murderer rather than his success in solving the mystery. Branagh’s Poirot seems friendly but a bit haughty and distanced. His actions and utterances, starting with his astonishing crime-solving performance in Jerusalem, only emphasise his brilliance and greatness. At the very beginning, he boasts with his observation skills determining Miss Debenham’s previous location and occupation. But behind this façade, when alone, Branagh’s Poirot gets sentimental when he is looking at the photograph of a Katherine and admitting that he is scared, unsure if he can solve the case. His quirks known from other works are illustrated with some funny episodes, in which he refuses to eat eggs of unequal size or steps into a heap of manure with both feet rather than just one, for the sake of the symmetry. Ustinov’s Poirot is a slightly comical figure. It must not be forgotten, though, that he played Poirot in six films (but none of them was in Orient), thus being given opportunities to test his character in different settings and different stories. Ustinov’s Poirot does not particularly care about good manners. He sits down before Lady Edgware does and keeps his hands in the pockets while talking to the lord, her husband (in Thirteen at Dinner [Lord Edgware Dies]). He eats Simon Doyle’s meal in Nile while Colonel Rice is talking to the injured man. In Folly, he touches the towel hanging from Sir George’s neck when being introduced and sings aloud when walking outside. In Murder in Three Acts [Three Act Tragedy], the viewer can see him in a plain, unbuttoned blazer over an ordinary white shirt. Ustinov’s Poirot often adopts a mocking voice timbre and patronizing tenor, his life seems focused on fun, crime and chasing the perpetrators being just part of it. Last but not least, Suchet’s Poirot, who keeps the fans occupied watching him in seventy episodes of the aforementioned TV series for the total of roughly eighty hours, thus having enough time to win their hearts and convince the unconvinced, offers the most refined, distinguished variant of Christie’s hero,\n\nInspector Japp on Pages and on the Screen\n\n21\n\nand arguably closest to his literary prototype. His attire, hairdo and manners are always perfect, his appearance well-groomed even when he is asleep in his bed with neatly arranged pillows. This Poirot is in the first place charming and using his charm to win people’s sympathy. He smiles decently, with dignity, can also get angry, pensative or sad, but he never appears common. When comparing Poirot’s images conveyed by these five actors it is mandatory to take into consideration not only the number of the films with their participation but also the production time and place. In 1974, Albert Finney was starring in a detached American film. Although it was not meant to start a series, it was the first of many film adaptations of the novels in question. He did not have to compete with anybody else in this role. Kenneth Branagh, on the contrary, was running against an established, highly appreciated performance by David Suchet, with three other impersonators of the famous characters still in the audience’s memory. Justice should be done to Alfred Molina, whose leeway to render the “true” Poirot from the pages was mightily narrowed through the filmmakers’ initial decision (preliminary strategy) to change the time frame for contemporary, which could be termed “contemporarisation”. With the plot set in the computer era, and a giant of the digital revolution (Bob Arbuthnot, who replaced the colonel of this name from the novel) on board of Orient Express, Molina’s Poirot makes a sensible decision taking off his aura, resigning from his eccentricity and de-emphasising the power of his famous grey cells that prove most efficient when collaborating with new technologies, and thus accepting the transformed world.\n\n1.4. Inspector Japp on Pages and on the Screen Like Poirot, Inspector James Japp is introduced to Christie’s reader in Styles. Interestingly, Poirot, who is often described as a little man and whose height is indicated on many occasions in various works, refers to Japp as “the little man”, pointing at him as the shorter of the two Scotland Yard men who appeared at Alfred Inglethorp’s trial. Poirot asks his companion Captain Hastings: “Do you know who that little man is?” Since the answer is negative, he explains: “That is Detective-Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard – Jimmy Japp”. (p.145). Similarly, in Kidnapped (p. 26) Hastings describes Japp as “a little ferret-faced fellow”. This aspect of Japp’s physical appearance was ignored by the filmmakers completely. Philip Jackson, who was selected for this role, is 183 cm tall and of regular physique, so he can pass for a big man, commanding respect by his mere appearance. Japp remembers Poirot from their joint investigations back in 1904 in Brussels and respects his abilities: “Me and Moosier here, we have met before – and there’s no man’s judgement I’d sooner take than his.” (Styles, p.148).\n\n22\n\nResearch Design\n\nAccording to Hastings’s notes in Victory (p. 6), “Poirot had a good opinion of Japp’s abilities, though deploring his lamentable lack of method”. In Hastings’s opinion, though, Japp’s “highest talent lay in the gentle art of seeking favours under the guise of conferring them!”, thus confirming both Japp’s genuine faith in Poirot’s abilities and his good skills of using them to his own benefit. The filmic Japp admires Poirot’s achievements, which he clearly expresses publicly in his charity speech in Sin, eavesdropped by Poirot to the viewer’s delight; he emphasises Poirot’s excellent reputation and professionalism when talking to FBI agent Bart in Cheap; he also recommends the Belgian detective for an extremely difficult and confidential job in Kidnapped, which boils down to a quick locating of the abducted British prime minister. At the same time, Japp is obviously jealous of Poirot’s talent and does not hesitate to belittle it. In Plymouth (p. 21), Japp “greeted Poirot with a sort of affectionate contempt”, which seems to capture their mutual relation on pages. As observed by Hastings in Kidnapped (p. 26), Japp was “supposed to be one of the smartest Scotland Yard officers”. In Four (p. 48) he mentions a police inspector called Meadows, who “was inclined to be stiff at first but on magic name of Inspector Japp from Scotland Yard he unbent”. Nonetheless, whenever they cooperate, Japp is a step or two behind Poirot, jumping too hastily to conclusions when further investigations are needed. Within his power of authority, he does not hesitate to arrest the most probable perpetrator and close the case without investigating further options, as he does in Lord (p. 240), detaining Ronald Marsh, or in Buckle (p.174), where he takes Frank Carter’s guilt for granted. This characteristic of his is reflected on the screen, and transferred through creative derivation to many episodes, e. g. to Cornish, where he simmers with anger on hearing that the arrested Mr. Pengeley is innocent and the actual perpetrator Mr. Radnor has confessed through Poirot’s trick, or to Garden, where he is satisfied with Katarina’s arrest and dislikes the perspective of further investigations. Japp sometimes has success on his own, for instance, he arrests the drug dealer Mr. Dryer in Mine and stops the FBI agent from shooting the suspect in Cheap, thus observing Scotland Yard standards. Nevertheless, he proves most useful when he follows Poirot’s suggestions. In The Market Basing Mystery (1923), and the early version of Murder in the Mews (1937), Japp is described as a hobby botanist who knows the Latin names of flowers. This information is not reflected on screen. There is no mention on pages of Japp’s marital status or his family. The idea of introducing him on the screen as a married man whose wife is regularly mentioned but never appears was obviously borrowed from the American series Columbo with Peter Falk in the titular role, the second batch of which was shot parallel to Poirot, between 1989 and 2003 (the first was broadcast from 1968 to 1978).\n\nCaptain Hastings on Pages and on the Screen\n\n23\n\nIn Plymouth (p. 22), Poirot describes Japp’s working methods as follows: “He travels; he measures footprints; he collects mud and cigarette-ash! He is extremely busy! He is zealous beyond words! And if I mentioned psychology to him, do you know what he would do, my friend? He would smile!”. At the same time, in Davenheim (p. 7), Poirot bets that he can solve the mystery without leaving his home, but only on condition that Japp will provide the results obtained with these mocked methods. Their rivalry is to a large extent just imaginary, in fact, they complement each other, thus constituting an efficient squad, reflected on the screen through the application of teaming strategy that will be explained below.\n\n1.5. Captain Hastings on Pages and on the Screen Arthur Hastings is introduced as narrator and main character of Christie’s first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920), where he appears as a lieutenant of the British Army on sick leave. The reader learns from his narrative in Kidnapped (p. 3) that he was invalided out of the Army and given a recruiting job. As he admits in Styles (p. 18–19), a detective’s work attracts him: I’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!’ (…) I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous detective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvelous little fellow. He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method. My system is based on his – though of course I have progressed rather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but wonderfully clever.\n\nIn this way, Hercule Poirot is introduced to the reader, without his name being mentioned yet. Hastings starts working for Poirot, who re-enters his life soon, by accident. Unlike Poirot, Hastings is physically strong and fit for combat, and Poirot can always rely on him when it comes to physical confrontation with a criminal, as is the case, for example, in Cheap (p. 15). Hastings is promoted to the rank of captain before being released to civilian life and retains this military rank as a honorific, as dictates British tradition. He is narrator of many short stories of 1923. Hastings meets his future wife on a train, when they both travel from Paris to London in Links (1923) and emigrates with her to Argentina to run a farm. He returns on several occasions, always alone, and joins Poirot in his investigations. However, in the short stories in which he acts as the narrator, Hastings is still a bachelor and obviously Poirot’s employee – even though this professional relation between them is never called by its name directly. Poirot often mocks Hastings’s interest in women as penchant for auburn hair, e. g., in Sin (p.10) and Flat (p. 9).\n\n24\n\nResearch Design\n\nIn Davenheim (p. 8), Poirot passes an observation that has been taken very seriously by the filmmakers, who decided Captain Hastings’s screen personality. Poirot says: “Le sport, it is the passion of you English”. Accordingly, the filmic Hastings displays increased interest in sport. In Clappham, it is horse racing, in Mews and Underdog– golfing, in Blackbirds – cricket, in Davenheim – car racing, in Star- billiards. Besides, he appears as a proud owner of different sports cars and gets opportunities to present his excellent driver’s skills when chasing the suspects, for instance in Sin, Incredible or Kidnapped. He drives Poirot in most episodes in which he appears, e. g., Blackbirds, Incredible, Dream, King. Sometimes his car is employed as an entertaining prop, for instance, when Hastings is doing some work on it instead of completing his assigned detective’s task in Mews; when the criminal uses and crashes it in his desperate attempt to escape in Flat; when it suddenly stops running in Waverly, for an unknown reason that is identified, after a long while, as empty tank; or when he buys a brand-new, expensive cabriolet that is soon completely destroyed in a criminal’s pursuit in Noble. Bunson (2000, p. 248) quotes Agatha Christie referring to Hastings as a “stereotype creation” who was meant to assist and support Poirot as part of “a detective team”. In this sense, he constitutes a major personalisation of the abovementioned teaming strategy. In Four (p. 143), Poirot captures Hasting’s character in the following words: “Hastings, you have a nature so beautiful and so honest that unless you are yourself deceived, it is impossible for you to deceive others”, which is confirmed through all Hastings’s actions on the screen.\n\n1.6. Miss Lemon on Pages and on the Screen Miss Lemon is introduced in Spanish Chest (1932) and described as follows: “Miss Lemon he (Poirot – L.H.) had never considered as a woman. She was a human machine – an instrument of precision. Her efficiency was terrific. She was forty-eight years of age and was fortunate enough to have no imagination whatever.” (p. 4). Then, in Garden (p. 6–7), she is depicted in these, not particularly favourable words: Miss Lemon was forty-eight and of unprepossessing appearance. Her general effect was that of a lot of bones flung together at random. She had a passion for order almost equaling that of Poirot himself; and though capable of thinking, she never thought unless told to do so (…). Very occasionally her employer appealed to her human, as opposed to her official, capacities. It slightly annoyed Miss Lemon when he did so – she was very nearly the perfect machine, completely and gloriously uninterested in all human affairs. Her real passion in life was the perfection of a filing system beside which\n\nScreen Adaptation as Translation\n\n25\n\nall other filing systems should sink into oblivion. She dreamed of such a system at night. Nevertheless, Miss Lemon was perfectly capable of intelligence on purely human matters, as Hercule Poirot well knew.\n\nAs observed by Poirot in Chest (p. 8), Miss Lemon will obediently accomplish the tasks assigned to her but not enjoy it at all, thus being the exact opposite to Captain Hastings. The above descriptions are not reflected at all in the filmic Miss Lemon, played by Pauline Moran. On the screen, Poirot’s secretary is an attractive woman, who appears in stylish clothes, with a tasteful hairdo. She performs her job in a highly professional way, with vivid interest in each of Poirot’s cases, thus surpassing in this regard Captain Hastings, who – as mentioned above – sometimes gives preference to his hobbies. On the screen, Miss Lemon has a very good, warm and friendly relationship to both Poirot and Hastings. There is even a hint, in Clou, of her possible affection for Poirot, when he seems infatuated with Countess Rossakoff. If necessary, Miss Lemon takes charge in the firm and does not hesitate to rebuke the men or command them. So, in Flat, she reprimands Poirot for having shortened the time of inhalation she has prepared for him; in Million, she stops him from packing too many clothes for his US voyage; in Garden, she tells Hastings off for rummaging in the documents.\n\n1.7. Screen Adaptation as Translation Film adaptation is often perceived as a relative of translation (Kittregde and Krauzer, 1979, p. 7; Klein and Parker, 1981, p. 3; Cattrysse 1992, p. 62; Stam 2000, p. 62; Perdikaki 2017, pp. 50–254). With reference to the dictionary definitions of the words ‘adaptation’ and ‘translation’, Cahir (2006, p. 14) argues that it would be more adequate to refer to films based on literary works as translations rather than adaptations. She concludes that what is traditionally called a screen adaptation does not involve any alterations of a given entity (here: the precursor work) to survive (which defines adaptation), but rather means the production of “a materially different entity”. Cattrysse (2014, pp. 47–49) discusses some common features of adaptation and translation, pointing out that they both are (1) context-embedded products of human activity, relying on multiple agents and recipient-oriented, (2) based upon texts and producing texts, (3) irreversible, (4) teleological, (5) governed by equivalence which can be established empirically (6) exposed to judgements by fidelity criterion. Obviously, some of these properties (2, 4 and 5) refer to the process, and others (1, 3 and 6) to the product. Features (1), (3) and (4) are not distinctive since they apply to an infinite multitude of man-made products.\n\n26\n\nResearch Design\n\nFeature (2) confirms the extended notion of text that includes a picture as suitable for being read – particularly convenient in any attempt to bring the written word and the screen together, and which facilitates the productive application of intertextuality to film adaptation. What seems most interesting and important is the interrelated features (5) and (6), which concern the eternal and controversial questions of equivalence and fidelity in translation and adaptation, the issues which remain divisive among scholars and audiences. In his recent work, Cattrysse (2020, p. 26) adds to his catalogue of common features of translation and film adaptation the fact that their prototypes draw on literature. Investigating screen adaptations of literature as intersemiotic translation finds justification in Jakobson’s (1959/2012, p.127) seminal classification of translation into intralingual translation or rewording, explained as “an interpretation of verbal signs by means of other signs of the same language”, interlingual translation or translation proper, elucidated as “an interpretation of verbal signs by means of some other language”, and intersemiotic translation or transmutation that boils down to an interpretation of verbal signs by means of signs of nonverbal sign systems. Jakobson pays much attention to intersemiotic translations, referring to them, alternatively, as “intersemiotic transpositions – from one system of signs into another, e. g., from verbal art into music, dance, cinema, or painting” (ibid., p. 31). As reported by Kaz´mierczak (2018, pp. 10–11), further examples of intersemiotic translation were provided over decades by other scholars. The list includes encoding a text into Morse code, translating into the tactile mode of Braille, communicating messages by means of systems of flags, etc., informing, prohibiting, commanding, warning by way of conventional pictograms, replacing verbal text with graphic signs (punctuation marks) – as a manifestation of conceptual translation. A film can be understood as a text in a broad meaning of the latter, but not as broad, I think, as the spacious and rather ornamental metaphor of “culture as a text” (Geertz 1973, Bal 2002). It allows us to call a text whatever can be “read” and interpreted as a manifestation of a heritage. According to this concept, the label text does not only apply to language products, but also to other manifestations of culture that can be interpreted and talked about. A noteworthy proposition to want to perceive a film as a text was put forward by Metz back in 1977: The only relevant principle capable of defining the semiology of the film now is, in addition to its application to the filmic factors rather than to the cinematographic factors, your will to treat films as texts, as units of discourse, thus forcing yourself to research the different systems (which may be codes or not) that inform these texts and become involved in them (Metz 1977, p. 14, transl. mine, emphasis added).\n\nScreen Adaptation as Translation\n\n27\n\nThe above is not an attempt to impose the text notion on a motion picture against the traditional concept of a text as the outcome of the use of language but just a possibility of capturing the common, communicative function of language and picture. Once the film is comprehended as a type of a text, the parallels between translation and screen adaptation appear clearer. As products, translation and screen adaptation share at least the following features: – They both are based on a precursor text, which boils down to the mere concept of both translation and adaptation. As rightly observed by Krzysztof Hejwowski (2004, p. 10), a pseudotranslation, this is a text presented as a translation without an existing original, is not an object worthy of translation scholar’s attention, and the same applies, in my opinion, to pseudoadaptations, if any. – The prototypical manifestation of each of them is literature processing. As pointed out by Maria Tymoczko (2014, p. 15), it is literature with the complexity and riches of its language that makes it most suitable for a prototypical translation model. At the same time, adaptation scholars emphasise, or even complain, that the screen adaptations of literary works occupy the central place in adaptation studies, leaving little space for other genres. It goes without saying that it is precisely film adaptations of literary works, those which are well known but also those unknown to the broad audience, that reach the broadest audience due to their easy accessibility. – They are both interpretative propositions, not ultimate solutions. Like retranslations of important or just popular books, new film adaptations are launched of the works that have been adapted for the screen already, sometimes more than once. – They both circulate, in space and time, as representations of their precursor texts in the minds of the broad audience. The readers of Ibsen’s works in translation, this is – regarding a limited number of native speakers of Swedish – a vast majority of his readers, take for granted that they know Ibsen’s work, its topics, messages and aura. Similarly, the viewers of any screen adaptations of Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, be it with Alan Ladd (1949), Robert Redford (1974) or Leonardo DiCaprio (2013) in the main role believe to be familiar with this masterpiece of literature, also without having ever turned its pages. These observations, based on several surveys the participants of which first answered the question about knowing, and only then that about having read the precursor text, are meant to report the readers’ and viewers’ attitude, not to evaluate it, and refer to non-professionals who read books or watch films for pleasure only.\n\n28\n\nResearch Design\n\n– They both are, and will always be, compared with the corresponding precursor texts, be it by fans, critics or researchers. No imposed academic trend can change it. Some non-professional and professional readers of translations and viewers of screen adaptations have read the precursor text before or will reach for it afterwards out of curiosity. Then, a comparison will take place automatically or perhaps instinctively because the human mind practices comparison all time, with the aim of selecting the best options. A private judgement (which is better or rather, which do I like better?) will be passed immediately, which happens in the case of all products that draw on previous ones. – They both are historical products, embedded in a social environment, and are examined as such in research. As pointed out by Cattrysse (1992, p. 54), the early-stage translation studies were source-oriented, focused on equivalence in the product evaluation and restricted in its scope to a selected pair of texts, the original and its translation. None of these features is valid for the recent mainstream translation studies which, after several “turns” in trends, is now focused on the agents involved in translation, the factors accompanying and governing the translation process, technologisation of translation, functions and ramifications of translation, the consequences of lacking translation and lay translation, to name just a few foci. Like translation, the term adaptation labels both the product and the process of its creation, which can generate confusion in discourse if it is used without due caution. It cannot be ignored that adaptation is known in translation theory as a translation procedure (Vinay & Darbelnet 1957) or translation method (Newmark 1988), where it means an adjustment to the recipient’s pre-assumed cognitive power and knowledge. Thus, it refers to a recipient-oriented intervention which is different from the mere linguistic code-switch that pertains to the essence of translation as such, whereas the concept of film adaptation captures mainly the fact of the medium change, without suggesting the type of relation between the source and the final product. When discussing film adaptation as translation one should be cautious with the use of words known in translation studies as terms. To illustrate: Hutcheon (2006, p. xii) employs the “innocent” word ‘transposition’ when explaining the essence of the adaptation process (with no relation to translation) and has all right to do so: “Most of the work done on adaptation has been carried out on cinematic transpositions of literature (…) “. But transposition, as a term, is known as a translation technique (Fawcett 1997, p. 37) that boils down to a rearrangement of an utterance, enforced through a word class change. By the way, in Wagner’s classification of screen adaptation, transposition labels an adaptation with a minimal number of departures from the base text (Wagner 1975,\n\nScreen Adaptation as Translation\n\n29\n\np. 222), thus, terminological caution is advisable also within one and the same discipline. In this research, the focus is mainly on the contents of the two related works of art, a literary text and its screen adaptation. The relation between the original dialogues and their screen counterparts, although undoubtedly worthy of scholarly attention, is not included. In other words, what interests us here is the relation between the base text that serves as point of departure for dramatization, be it a piece of original writing or a translation from another language, and the final product, from the angle of the applied adaptation strategies used to implement them. The “faithfulness” of a screen adaptation to the corresponding literary text does not function as an evaluation criterion of the former anymore. Nearly three decades ago, Brian MacFarlane (1996) already described this practice as obsolete. Adaptations were roughly divided into three types: (1) as faithful as possible to the base text, (2) in the core faithful to the base text but with abundant changes, and (3) unfaithful to the base text. Different scholars introduced different terms for this tripartite division. Wagner (1975, p. 222) and Cartmell (1999, p. 24) refer to them as transposition, commentary and analogy, in Andrew (1980, p. 11) they are called fidelity of transposition, intersection and borrowing whilst Klein and Parker (1981, pp. 9–10) provide descriptive definitions, namely “fidelity to the main thrust of the narrative”’, a procedure that “retains the core of the structure of the narrative while significantly reinterpreting or, in some cases, deconstructing the source text”’, and using “the source merely as raw material, as simply the occasion for an original work”. These approaches may be perceived as preliminary strategies or the filmmakers’ general policies, possibly decided regardless of the specificity of the base material, without even knowing it. They must not be confused with the working strategies, which can be only based on the profound knowledge of the departure text, the contents of which are open to creative processing. Despite being “based on” a literary work, the film started being perceived in academia as an autonomous product, in which there could be found “good” or “bad”, but this not due to its relation to the underlying literary text. A similar turn in the approach to the object of study took place in translation studies, where the translations stopped being examined and evaluated by their faithfulness to the original texts in linguistics terms, and the key notion of linguistic equivalence was abandoned (Snell-Hornby 1988, Hermans 2007). Instead, the agents and factors contributing to the final shape of translations, like the translation’s purpose (Vermeer 1983), prevailing norms in the target culture (Toury 1995) or political and social restrictions (Tan 2015), moved to the center of scholarly interest, with a recent focus on, to put it jokingly, the ‘whodunit’ element of the whole process,\n\n30\n\nResearch Design\n\nmainly the translator with their professional and private background (Chesterman 2009). The expression “based on”, as displayed on the screen in credits, is applied in the film industry in a very broad sense, and the examples of Poirot adaptation discussed below will document it. It may mean a relatively accurate transfer to the screen of the base text contents, limited solely through the restriction of the target medium nature. Indeed, the viewer who is familiar with the base text, may see on screen the story well known to them from a previous reading, most likely without some secondary characters whose absence is hardly noticed anyway, and without some complementing details contained in the book but not truly relevant for the plot. But a film still remains “based on” a preceding work of fiction, and is promoted as such, also in those frequent cases, where it significantly differs from the base story, for instance, a new character has been deliberately added at the expense of an original figure that was deleted, the main hero comes over as a person radically and verifiably different from their prototype on pages, the special or temporal location of the plot is different from the base text, or the end does not conform to that of the base story. Maybe it would be fairer, on some occasions, to indicate that a given film adaptation was just inspired by a certain literary work or based on some of its motifs. McFarlane (1996, p. 8), who is known to support legitimate departures in film adaptations from the precursor literary text, observes: “Not being bold can cripple the process of adaptation and one can end up with not so much an adaptation as an embalmment of a famous work. I place a good deal of BBC classic serial filmmaking in this category”. Similarly, Thomas Leitch (2007, p. 6) finds that “production companies like Merchant Ivory or the BBC revive the Selznick legacy by providing what might be called a negative cachet, a guarantee that they will protect the audience from the shock of experiencing any new thoughts or feelings that would not have been provoked by their source texts”. Although it is not its aim, the present research might allow us to check if the above claim applies to LWT and ITV as the production companies of the Poirotseries.\n\n1.8. Strategy versus Technique in Translation and Adaptation In translation studies, translation strategies (or methods) and techniques (or procedures) are sometimes confused. The reason that it happens is, in my opinion, that the same label may be applicable to both, which can be best illustrated through the example of adaptation. In Vinay and Darbelnet (1995) it is discussed as one of the seven translation procedures (alongside borrowing,\n\nStrategy versus Technique in Translation and Adaptation\n\n31\n\ncalque, literal translation, transposition, modulation and equivalence), which “is used in those cases where the type of situation being referred to by the SL message is unknown in the TL culture. In such cases translators must create a new situation that can be considered as being equivalent. Adaptation can, therefore, be described as a special kind of equivalence, a situational equivalence” (ibid., p. 39). In this sense, adaptation is meant as a translational micro-level solution, where a culture-specific phenomenon deemed unfamiliar to the target recipient is substituted with a familiar one. Peter Newmark (1988) locates adaptation among the translation methods (alongside word-for-word translation, literal translation, faithful translation, semantic translation, free translation, idiomatic translation and communicative translation) and describes it as follows: “This is the ‘freest’ form of translation. It is used mainly for plays (comedies) and poetry; the themes, characters, plots are usually preserved, the SL culture converted to the TL culture and the text rewritten” (ibid., p. 40). Obviously, this definition applies to the production of a traditional (target) text that is based on a (source) text without the intention or ambition to recreate all its elements and features. As I argue elsewhere (Harmon 2021), it is necessary to maintain the difference between translation strategy and translation technique, especially in the context of Hejwowski’s (2015, p. 62) recommendation not to deprive the words which function as terms of the meanings that they have in the general language. In its common use, the word strategy refers to a general plan of executing a task whilst a technique is understood as a describable manner of doing something. Therefore: A translation strategy can be described as the translator’s general intention to, for example, focus on the good quality of the target language, maintain as much as possible of the foreign culture or eliminate the original vulgarity. It applies to the whole text, this is to say to the macro-level, unlike the technique that is utilised on a particular spot and thus on the micro-level. As a consequence, from a researcher’s perspective, a translation technique can be identified through a mere comparison of two small parallel excerpts of the original and its translation, whereas a comparative analysis of the whole parallel texts is necessary in order to determine the translator’s strategy, if any. At the same time, it must not be forgotten that translation strategies and techniques were developed for the purposes of what Jakobson (1959) termed interlingual translation and that he also discerned two other types of translation (interlingual and intersemiotic), which have been paid much attention in translation studies recently. Film adaptation has something in common with both intersemiotic and intralingual translation. It is perceived as the former since it converts words into pictures. What it shares with intralingual translation is that it does not primarily involve a foreign audience; the dialogues are mostly based\n\n32\n\nResearch Design\n\non the same language version of the precursor work, be it the original or its translation in the language of the production country. In line with Hejwowski’s (2015, p. 62) abovementioned recommendation to refrain in terminologisation from imposing on words meanings which are essentially different from their common understanding, it should be remembered that the word adaptation, as defined in Cambridge Dictionary, covers “the process of changing to suit different conditions”. So, a film adaptation comprehended as a kind of translation is likely to be governed by some strategies realised with the aid of identifiable techniques which might partly overlap with those established for classic translation (translation proper), but their total correspondence is technically impossible due to the specificity and limitation of the motion picture.\n\n1.9. Strategies and Techniques in the Present Research In what follows, some strategies and techniques of adaptation comprehended as translation will be pointed out and illustrated through noticeable differences between the contents of the pages and the screen. The object of the study is the Poirot series as a whole. It will be scrutinised for some assumed patterns that governed the concept (and, as a consequence, the screenplay) of each episode and thus ensured a consistent design of the total production. The list below gathers twenty-three adaptation strategies retrieved from the comparative analyses of the material (seventy Poirot novels and short stories altogether and their TV adaptations), as well as the observed techniques which were used to implement them: – Activation: A living person, who is only mentioned on pages, appears as a character on the screen, in action. Their actions and words may reflect the information provided in the precursor text (technique of creative derivation) or diverge from this information completely (creative addition) or just to some extent (creative modification or omission). – Amelioration: A film character comes over as “better” than his or her literary prototype, which mostly boils down to a reduction of their negativity rather than its elimination. This effect is achieved through omission (e. g., one of the perpetrator’s crimes is skipped) or creative modification (e. g., the criminal is victimised). However, sometimes a positive gesture or action is added that makes a positive character appear even better than they do on pages, which sometimes applies to Poirot, too. – Anticipation: The viewer’s activity in solving the mystery together with Poirot is triggered through some hints provided in the initial scenes on the screen. These scenes might be compiled from the overall information provided on the pages (creative derivation) or completely made up (creative addition). As a\n\nStrategies and Techniques in the Present Research\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\n33\n\nrule, it seems detached from the major story, but the viewer knows that it is meant as a clue. Bohemisation: A character that has nothing to do with art on pages, appears on the screen as an artist or their activities are connected with art (creative modification). Alternatively, a character engaged in art is added that has no prototype at all in the corresponding work. Co-option: A character is introduced that is absent from the pages. This strategy can be expected in the case of short stories which do not provide enough material for a film, but it is sometimes applied in novel-based adaptations, alongside depopulation – as explained below, and sometimes at the expense of a skipped character. Depopulation: A characters that appears on the pages together with their history does not appear on the screen at all or the history of a film character is a compilation of the histories of two or more characters from the precursor text. This strategy seems inevitable in screen adaptations due to the time limitations, so it could be (wrongly) dismissed as obvious. However, it is not always the characters of minor importance that are omitted. What is more, as mentioned above, depopulation as omission of an original character does not exclude co-option. Entertainisation: A plot constituent – like a side-story, scene, action or utterance – has been introduced in order to generate humour, which can be achieved through the technique of creative modification (change in the existing material) or that of creative addition (new material). For example, on the pages of Murder in Mesopotamia (1936) Poirot is staying in Baghdad to investigate a case, but in the corresponding TV adaptation, he goes there in response to Countess Rossakoff ’s call, which allows for a series of amusing scenes, where he repeatedly asks about the Countess at the hotel reception but never meets her, and ends up paying her hotel bill; in the novel Murder on the Links (1923), Poirot and Inspector Giraud bet just 500 francs on who will solve the mystery first, whilst on the screen their respective hallmarks (Poirot’s famous moustache or Giraud’s equally famous pipe) are at stake; in the novel Death in the Clouds (1934) Inspector Japp speaks French but does not travel to France, whereas in the film he goes to Paris and succeeds – to Poirot’s astonishment – in his attempt to communicate without knowing French. Glorification: A character’s individual splendor is emphasised or increased. In the films examined in this research, it mostly applies to Poirot, who was created as a man of big success achieved by hard work based on expertise and brilliant intellect. He is aware of his abilities, a sucker for compliments, expecting all the world to know his name. Therefore, the strategy of glorification can be stated whenever Poirot – against what is described on pages – appears on screen as a friend or acquaintance of a very important person, such a\n\n34\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\nResearch Design\n\nperson seeks his services because of his reputation, somebody is visibly pleased to meet him for the same reason, recognises him imediately or, as a minimum, is familiar with his famous name. Alternatively, his fame and extraordinary talents are directly articulated by another character. However, on some few occasions, this strategy is applied to other important characters (e. g., Inspector Japp or Ariadne Oliver). Human softening: A professional person displays a weakness or flaw which may come over as funny or irritating but reminds the viewer that there is a human behind each set of skills. This strategy may be converted, for example, through the character’s vanity, snobbery, addiction or preferences. Alternatively, the person can be shown in a private environment, performing everyday chores or focused on personal affairs. Importation: It may be considered as a variant of co-option. A character that is absent from a given precursor text but well-known to Christie fans from other Poirot stories is brought on the screen, possibly to substitute a character from the pages partly (technique of splitting) or totally (technique of substitution). Alternatively, a motif or idea from another Poirot story might be incorporated into the plot. This variant of importation often applies to Poirot’s famous mannerism, like his obsession for order and symmetry. Marital reduction: The information provided on pages about a concluded or intended marriage is not reiterated in the film. As a deletion, it does not fall under social alerting (as described below) which requires that the social problem in question is represented on the screen. On the one hand, marital reduction seems to reflect the dropping numbers of marriages, and thus “less marriage” in the western civilisation. On the other hand, it frees the films of a certain fairy-tale cliché, where a good end often means a marriage, with an assumed long and happy life. Melodramatisation: The filmic plot includes, against what is provided on pages, scenes or dialogues that strongly appeal to the viewer’s emotions, evoking empathy or sympathy. This effect may be achieved through creative addition of new characters or creative modification of relations between the existing characters. Multiplication: The number of scenes with a given character’s participation is increased, so that the viewer receives “more of this person” in comparison with the corresponding text. This quantitative effect can be achieved through creative addition in that new activities are invented to occupy this character in the course of the plot, through compression (a given character makes on screen the experience of his or her own literary prototype and, in addition, that of some omitted characters), or through splitting (a given character partly substitutes in action another original character that has not been omitted).\n\nStrategies and Techniques in the Present Research\n\n35\n\n– Pejoration: An important character is portrayed on screen as being worse than in the written text, which may be brought about through creative modification or creative addition. Depending on its timing, pejoration can intensify the thrill, which happens if it is effectuated through an action incorporated in the current plot. However, it may remain thrill-neutral, if it occurs at the end, when the mystery is solved. Therefore, even though thrill intensification and pejoration can overlap, they are not identical. – Political correction: Elements of prejudice – mainly concerning Jewish people, but on some occasions representatives of other nations – are avoided, mostly through omission but sometimes through mitigation. This can be noticed on screen despite the humorous character of a vast majority of them in Christie’s work. Interestingly, this strategy does not apply to Poirot and the English, whose pride seems sacrificed for the sake of good entertainment. – Political redirection: A political issue addressed on pages is replaced in the corresponding film with another political issue which seems more interesting or more important to the projected viewers than the original one (substitution) and does not meet the criteria of political correction. Alternatively, a political issue mentioned or alluded to on pages in general terms is concretised on screen and applies to a particular country or a particular problem. – Politicisation: Some contents relating to general or local politics are introduced in a direct or indirect way which are absent from or only hinted at in the precursor text. This may be achieved by means of creative additions, modifications or derivations. – Reviving: A character whose murder is investigated, and who is only mentioned on pages in this context, appears on the screen alive, mostly briefly. This may happen at the beginning, as a form of what was termed anticipation, or any time later, through flashbacks to the past that replace a character’s descriptive narrative or returning memories. – Romanticisation: A love relationship that is not depicted or mentioned on pages appears on the screen. It affects two characters from the precursor text, or a character is added in order to make the romance happen. – Social alerting: A socially important issue is addressed that is only indirectly alluded to on pages or is not there at all. Some noteworthy examples are sexism, racism and xenophobia. The implementation of this strategy often requires the addition of secondary characters with their own stories or a new story of an existing character. Then, this procedure is particularly interesting, when combined with depopulation, so that an “alien” (meaning, absent from the pages) enters the stage at the expense of a “local”, meaning present on pages and banned from the screen to make room for the alien). – Social adjustment: Some circumstances, like people’s backgrounds, views, problems or plans are changed completely or modified to better fit in the\n\n36\n\nResearch Design\n\nmodern society in its reality or trends. For instance, past-related matters which are not essential for the plot, like those connected with the war or imperial colonialism, are omitted or substituted with present-relevant issues. Alternatively, a feature of a modern society as such is introduced on screen without any inspiration from the original text. – Social correction: A phenomenon that seems reprehensible from the viewpoint of smooth social coexistence is either skipped or modified to a form satisfactory from the same perspective. In particular, certain unquestionable values, like justice or loyalty, are defended in this way. This approach usually involves a character’s amelioration or a simple omission of a thread. – Teaming: A character contributes to the final success of Poirot’s investigation through performing an assigned task, an action undertaken on their own initiative or by pure accident. In this way, the importance of teamwork is brought to the fore, so that the main brain is obliged to share his glory. – Thrill intensification: More suspense is contained in the film than in the precursor text, which may be achieved through an additional crime (possibly another murder), additional factors incriminating the suspects or the introduction of another character to enlarge the number of possible perpetrators and thus complicate the investigation (technique of creative addition).\n\n1.10. Agatha Christie about Adaptation In the novel Mrs McGinty’s Dead (1952), a book by a recurrent character of Poirot stories, the crime fiction author Ariadne Oliver, is to be adapted for the stage. On that occasion, a short dispute takes place which elucidates the nature of adaptation. Mrs Oliver is indignant about the intended manipulations of her text. She complains to her friend Poirot: But you’ve no idea of the agony of having your characters taken and made to say things that they never would have said, and do things that they never would have done. And if you protest, all they say is that it’s ‘good theatre.’ That’s all Robin Upward thinks of. Everyone says he’s very clever. If he’s so clever I don’t see why he doesn’t write a play of his own and leave my poor unfortunate Finn alone. He’s not even a Finn any longer. He’s become a member of the Norwegian Resistance movement. (pp. 89–90)\n\nWhen she tries to resist substantial changes in her main hero and the plot, the playwright argues: It’s not a book, darling, it’s a play. And we’ve just got to have glamour! And if we get this tension, this antagonism between Sven Hjerson and this – what’s-her-name? – Karen – you know, all against each other and yet really frightfully attracted. (pp.114–115)\n\nMethod\n\n37\n\nThese emotional observations that Agatha Christie puts in the mouths of her characters tell us a lot about the nature of adaptation, be it for the stage or the screen. First, both the original author and the adaptor fiercely defend their positions. It appears only fair to the original author that the major features of the main character – which, to a large extent, govern the plot in that they entail or exclude certain courses of events – should be preserved in the adaptation, whereas the adaptor has completely different priorities. He is concerned about “good theatre”, in a broadest meaning of this phrase, including what is appreciated by the audience and sells well, but is not the least bothered about fidelity of his creation to its literary prototype. Second, in this dispute, the parties are not equal. Even though dissatisfied with and angry about the playwright’s choices, the author will capitulate, unless she gives up the tempting plan to get her hero on stage. The playwright, who represents the interests of the producer and thus the sponsor of the whole enterprises, is the powerful and winning agent. Third, the skillful playwright, capable of writing an independent play on his own, relies on the published material by a successful author despite her vehement criticism and invites her to cooperation, ready to cope with permanent tension between them because (and possibly only for this reason) her celebrated name alongside the name of her flag fictional character is meant to attract the audience. Fourth, what is missing from the book (for a good reason) and will be added in the adaptation (for another good reason), is romance. Although Mrs Oliver’s character Sven Hjerson, as designed by his creator, indicates no interest in women, a romantic relation will be imposed on him on stage in order to satisfy the audience’s expectations and increase suspense. The adopter considers his product semidetached from the precursor story. He uses this story and its author as a promotion vehicle for his own product, with no obligation to faithfulness, taking the liberty to “correct” whatever he deems unsuitable or add whatever increases the attractiveness of the product. On the few pages of her novel, Agatha Christie outlined a good chunk of adaptation theory.\n\n1.11. Method In Part II and Part III, the contents of the precursor texts are briefly outlined first, as “Short story summary” or “Novel summary”. Then, in the section titled “Changes in the film”, verifiable and thus indisputable differences between the precursor text and the corresponding film are identified and attributed, through induction, to the strategies defined above. Sometimes, if it is not evident, the relevant adaptation technique is indicated, too. It goes without saying that it is impossible to address all changes introduced in the films, so the selection is limited to the most striking ones, whereas the subjectivity of the choice cannot be\n\n38\n\nResearch Design\n\navoided. Unless self-evident, the qualification of a given strategy or technique is explained. In Part IV, the potential of a film adaptation is illustrated through the comparison of multiple adaptations of eight Poirot novels, and a new film adaptation in its essence is presented in relation to retranslation. The eight titles included in Part IV exhaust the number of Poirot novels that have been filmed more than once so far. The amount of the differences discussed in Part II and Part III vary from title to title because in some BBC episodes more striking departures from precursor books were established than in others. The findings could, of course, have been limited to a fixed number of examples for each title (be it in order to adjust to Poirot’s admiration for order and symmetry), but this would have distorted the research results through the illusion of a pre-determined, constant relation between the precursor text and its screen adaptation, and of a narrowed leeway for the film creators.\n\n2.\n\nStrategies and Techniques in TV Adaptations of Christie’s Short Stories with David Suchet as Hercule Poirot\n\n2.1. Introduction In this part, only the so-called short stories and the corresponding TV episodes are discussed, whereas the whole Part III is devoted to novels and their TV adaptations. This division results from the arguable pre-assumption that a short story provides less material in terms of events and characters depicted, thus enforcing certain strategies which are not necessary in the case of novel adaptations, especially importation and co-option realised through creative additions. The concept of a short story has been subject of literary theory since the beginning of the twentieth century. As pointed out by Matthews, “a true Shortstory is something other and something more than a mere story which is short” (1994/1901, p. 73). Significant contributions to the short story theory are provided, for instance, by O’Connor (1963) and March-Russel (2009). A review of prevailing short story theories is contained in Patea (2012). To what extent short stories “constitute not a form of knowledge but a challenge of knowledge” (Leitch 1989, p. 133) or “the short story remains by its very nature remote from the community – romantic, individualistic, and intransigent” (O’Connor 1976, p. 89) – these are possible research questions for dedicated studies which will not be pursued here. Otherwise, the results might imply that Christie’s Poirot stories, referred to as short stories for their mere brevity, do not, perhaps, deserve this label at all. In this research, the term short story applies to Christie’s works that are published and promoted as such, without discussing the validity of this term in relation to the works under scrutiny. The precursor texts of the episodes vary considerably in length. Some of them cover less than two dozen of pages (Waverly, Clapham), others more than six dozen (Mews, Incredible, Underdog), but each corresponding TV episode takes roughly fifty minutes, which is a standard length of a TV series episode. Some strategies discussed were decided by the Christie estate. As pointed out by Aldridge (2016), they explicitly wanted Poirot to be surrounded by his “family” consisting of his friend and associate Captain Hastings, his devoted secretary\n\n40\n\nStrategies and Techniques in TV Adaptations of Christie’s Short Stories\n\nMiss Lemon and his friend and adversary, Scotland Yard Inspector Japp. So, they are, if necessary (meaning: if they do not appear on pages of the corresponding story), imported and either assigned tasks matching their roles known from other Poirot works, or allowed to display new, unexpected qualities. This entails that Poirot is introduced as an already popular, successful detective, who receives clients in his own office, has an associate, employs a secretary and is highly appreciated by the police. He lives in a serviced apartment in the building called Whitehaven Mansion that is shown from outside in most episodes. Obviously, the viewer should not be confronted with his difficult emigrant’s start in a foreign country but delve instead in the fairy tale of a successful man who owes everything to his hard work and talent. In this part, a synthesis is provided for every set separately, since various conclusions may apply to each of them. The term set is used instead of season because it refers to the episodes that were first broadcast during a given calendar year and does not overlap completely with the official seasons which sometimes lasted longer.\n\n2.2. Set 1 (1989) In this section, the first ten episodes based on Poirot short stories constituting the 1989–2013 series will be scrutinised. These introduced David Suchet in the role of Hercule Poirot to a broad audience, established – as he describes in detail himself – his acting style (Suchet and Windsell 2013), and laid foundations for the continuation of the series after its initial success. Miss Lemon, who was only introduced on pages as Poirot’s secretary in Mystery of the Spanish Chest of 1932) is absent from all short stories selected for the first batch. In their screen adaptations of 1989, she appears in seven episodes, being skipped in Rhodes, Sea and King. She is never shown outside Poirot’s place, which emphasises her secretary’s role that sometimes verges on that of a caring housewife. Inspector Japp is mentioned (but not included in the plot) on pages of Clapham and appears in his usual role as Scotland Yard investigator in Mews. On the screen, he is only excluded from Rhodes and Sea, both set outside Britain, where there is no room for the British police’s interventions. Captain Hastings is narrator of Clapham, Johnnie and King, where he acts on Poirot’s side as his friend and helper. On the screen, he accompanies Poirot in all episodes of 1989 except for Rhodes, where another character (Miss Lyall) takes over as Poirot’s assistant.\n\nSet 1 (1989)\n\n41\n\nPoirot’s valet George, an indicator of his progressing affluence and perhaps snobbism, too, who is mentioned on pages of Mews and King, was skipped in the 1989 episodes completely. The films and the corresponding texts are discussed in the broadcasting order of the episodes on British TV that can be easily retrieved from their full descriptions available on the internet but is also recalled in Suchet and Wandsell (2013, pp. 95–116). It is noteworthy that the selection of the ten titles for the first set (or any other) does not reflect the publication order of the stories. The selection encompasses texts written between 1923 (Waverly and King) and 1940 (Blackbirds). Five of them were published in the second h"
