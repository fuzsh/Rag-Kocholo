        "text": "Hercule Poirot is a flexible little fellow. He can be dapper and twinkling, as David Suchet played him for 24 years on television. He can be vigorously obsessive-compulsive, as Kenneth Branagh played him in “Murder on the Orient Express” in 2017.\n\nAnd as it turns out, he can also be a depressed, guilt-ridden loner, as John Malkovich is forced to play him in “The ABC Murders,” a three-part mini-series now available on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe British screenwriter Sarah Phelps has been taking liberties with Agatha Christie’s mystery tales, on behalf of the Christie estate and the BBC, for a while now — “ABC Murders,” based on the 1936 novel of the same name, is the fourth mini-series she’s adapted from the books. Her method is extreme makeover, redoing Christie’s plots and reshaping her sensibility in a lurid and ominous fashion that, combined with top-flight casts, produced entertaining results with “And Then There Were None” and “Ordeal by Innocence.”\n\n“The ABC Murders” is Phelps’s most thorough teardown yet, and this time she’s so suffocatingly revisionist that what’s left isn’t really Christie at all. The insistence on making everything grimmer and grosser is almost comically complete.\n\nMost of the characters, and the broad outline of Christie’s mystery, are still there. Poirot, the peerless Belgian detective now living in London, receives letters signed “ABC.” They announce the dates on which murders will take place and the towns where they will occur; as the murders duly transpire, the alphabetical motif becomes clear: Mrs. Asher in Andover, Betty Barnard in Bexhill, and so on.\n\nIn the book the focus is, as always, on detection, with Poirot’s inquiries paralleling and eventually outpacing those of Scotland Yard, represented by the supercilious Inspector Crome. For Phelps, detective work is a necessary evil, condensed to the point that it’s barely intelligible.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
