        "text": "Agatha Christie writes comparatively few forward-thinking criminals who connive to permanently remove the threat of Poirot. In fact, I deal with the issue in my own Poirot novel, attempting to answer the ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Some of it is evident: Christie frequently makes Poirot more ‚Äúfamous in his own mind‚Äù but not taken seriously by criminals‚Äì until it‚Äôs too late. He uses his perceived ridiculousness at times as camouflage. At some points in the series, Poirot actually is virtually unknown in London (‚ÄúKidnapped Prime Minister‚Äù). But at other points (e.g. ‚ÄúThe Veiled Lady,‚Äù ‚ÄúHunter‚Äôs Lodge,‚Äù ‚ÄúWestern Star,‚Äù etc) it is very evident that he is well-known as a blazing success by society and criminals alike. My story, The London Syndicate, takes the question on as a challenge: why don‚Äôt enterprising criminals make a little more effort to get him out of the way? For my own solution, consult the text! üòâ\n\nBut for interest, Christie does throw in some examples of these people who, through cunning, panic, or even sheer ignorance, try to do in our favorite Belgian detective. Here‚Äôs a little compare/contrast on how it‚Äôs tackled in book, TV, and stage.\n\n************\n\n1) The Big Four. I‚Äôm just going to count this as ‚Äúone.‚Äù The book is full of anecdotes of Poirot and Hastings battling it out with this international menace, with not a few dramatic brushes with death. Most notable is the explosion which Poirot uses to fake his own death (because like Sherlock Holmes he‚Äôs a bit of a jerk to his friend in that respect). üôÇ Many Christie readers dislike The Big Four for a variety of reasons‚Äì Christie did as well‚Äì but I find it hard not to enjoy the more energetic and risk-filled anecdotes of this very bizarre, Bond-esque Poirot account. It‚Äôs great fun because it‚Äôs so unique and different.\n\n2) Mrs McGinty‚Äôs Dead. In this story, Poirot‚Äôs investigations into the McGinty case results in Dr Rendall getting the wind up and trying to push him under a train. The irony is that although Poirot delightedly assumes that McGinty‚Äôs murderer attempted to murder him and that this proves that he is on the right track, it‚Äôs actually a completely different crime that Dr Rendall is attempting to cover up. (In the adaptation, it is Mrs Rendall who does this, and she actually succeeds in shoving him onto the line.)\n\n3) ‚ÄúThe Case of the Egyptian Tomb.‚Äù The serial murder decides to try to add a meddling Poirot to his list of victims who are popularly supposed to be cursed by proximity to the opened tomb of an ancient pharaoh. Somehow Poirot manages to anticipate the spiking of his evening tisane with cyanide. His murder attempt failing, the murderer commits suicide instead (in the book).\n\n4) ‚ÄúThe Erymantian Boar.‚Äù This wild and crazy incident from The Labours of Hercules formed a large part of the conglomerate television adaptation, in which the killer Marrascaud is lurking in the Swiss establishment of Rochers Neiges. In the book, members of Marrascaud‚Äôs gang attack Poirot in his room at night, threatening to cut him with razor blades. They are thwarted by American tourist Schwartz and his fortuitous revolver, earning profound gratitude (not inexplicable annoyance‚Äì really, TV script?) from Poirot.\n\n5) Black Coffee. In this one and only Poirot play by Christie, the murderer attempts to poison Poirot in a whisky and soda. Luckily, Poirot is as usual a step ahead of the game, and has arranged a substitution with Hastings ahead of time as part of his dramatic denouement.\n\n6) Three Act Tragedy. This is not a deliberate targeting of Poirot, but he is fully cognizant (as the final lines of the novel reveal) that he could have easily been the recipient of the first poisoned cocktail. Almost everyone in the room was a potential murder victim. This last scene is really beautifully dramatized and delivered by Suchet, who manages to simultaneously bring out both the humor of Poirot‚Äôs vanity and the pathos of being betrayed by his friend.\n\n7) Evil Under the Sun. This is an example of pure rage from the murderer when his crime is revealed by Poirot. Usually Poirot is deft enough to simply skip out of the way, but this time the killer manages to get his hands on the other‚Äôs throat before he is held at bay. Accurately portrayed in the television adaptation as well.\n\n**********\n\nHonorable mentions (including television additions):\n\n‚ÄìDeath in the Clouds: The jury at the inquest nearly convicts Poirot of the murder on the plane! The verdict gets thrown out by the coroner.\n\nHe said, ‚ÄòI wonder what was on that paper that the coroner wouldn‚Äôt have at any price?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI can tell you, I think,‚Äô said a voice behind him.\n\nThe couple turned, to look into the twinkling eyes of M. Hercule Poirot.\n\n‚ÄòIt was a verdict,‚Äô said the little man, ‚Äòof wilful murder against me.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòOh, surely‚Äì ‚Äô cried Jane.\n\nPoirot nodded happily.\n\n‚ÄòMais oui. As I came out I heard one man say to the other, ‚ÄúThat little foreigner‚Äì mark my words, he done it!‚Äù The jury thought the same.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄìThe A.B.C. Murders: At the beginning of the book, Poirot recounts to Hastings that not long ago he‚Äôd had a narrow escape, having been ‚Äúnearly exterminated.‚Äù Hastings is impressed: ‚ÄúAn enterprising murderer!‚Äù Poirot suggests that the better word would be ‚Äúcareless,‚Äù not enterprising. Some think that this incident is a direct reference to the jury in Death in the Clouds (above), but in my opinion, it seems much more likely to refer to Three Act Tragedy. Poirot does not claim that he was deliberately targeted for death, but does accept Hastings‚Äô use of the word ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù and ‚Äúcareless‚Äù is a good word to describe that particular murderer. But there is always the speculative possibility that Poirot could be describing an unknown incident that Hastings never learns about and records for us.\n\n‚ÄìSad Cypress: In the television adaptation, the murderer attempts to poison Poirot in the same manner that Mary Gerrard was poisoned. But Poirot has always hated tea! üòÄ Interestingly, this delightful addition to the original story appears to have been lifted directly from the pages of Black Coffee! In both scenarios, Poirot is given a poisoned drink which he substitutes, and he also fakes symptoms of impending death. Then the murderer, off their guard, launches freely into a smug confession of nefarious deeds, only to be overheard by the nearby police. I‚Äôm very pleased that this device from Black Coffee made it into the TV canon. The only downside to the TV addition is: how can the murderer possibly think that she‚Äôll get away with this?\n\n‚ÄìThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd: In the adaptation, the murderer takes some gratuitous pot shots at Poirot and Japp after his cover is blown.\n\n‚ÄìCurtain: The TV telling of Curtain includes Norton engaging in a dangerous cat-and-mouse power play with Poirot, seeming to threaten to withhold the latter‚Äôs medication.\n\n‚ÄòIt would be most unwise on your part to attempt to silence me as you silenced M. Ackroyd. That kind of business does not succeed against Hercule Poirot, you understand.‚Äô\n\n-The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\n\nA few random notes about Poirot‚Äôs singing. Off the top of my head, I can think of two instances in the books where he sings (diligent readers may possibly think of others). He is said to sing in ‚Äúa hesitant baritone‚Äù as well as affecting ‚Äúan abominable falsetto voice‚Äù!\n\nHercule Poirot essayed in a hesitant baritone.\n\n‚ÄòThe proud have laid a snare for me,‚Äô he sang, ‚Äòand spread a net with cords: yea, and set traps in my way‚Ä¶‚Äô\n\n-One, Two, Buckle My Shoe\n\n***\n\n‚ÄòYes. To hum a tune is extremely dangerous. It reveals the unconscious mind. The tune you hummed dates, I think from the days of the war. Comme √ßa,‚Äô Poirot sang in an abominable falsetto voice:\n\n‚ÄòSome of the time I love a brunette,\n\nSome of the time I love a blonde\n\n(Who comes from Eden by way of Sweden).‚Äô\n\n-The A.B.C. Murders\n\n***\n\nI think it is safe to say that Poirot is not much of a singer. üôÇ In the television series, we distinctly hear Poirot‚Äôs singing voice (hesitant remains a pretty good adjective to use) in a few places: The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly, The Theft of the Royal Ruby, and The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Neither adaptions of One, Two, Buckle My Shoe nor The A.B.C. Murders feature Christie‚Äôs scenes of Poirot‚Äôs singing in church and to tease Hastings, respectively.\n\nIn Johnnie Waverly, Poirot and Hastings encounter a disappointing buffet breakfast at the home of their host, and subsequently decide to nip off in the car in pursuit of sustenance at an inn. While riding back, Hastings (perhaps cheered by his recent pint) seems to initiate the singing of the children‚Äôs folk song, ‚ÄúOne Man Went to Mow.‚Äù\n\nThe Theft of the Royal Ruby sees Poirot as a guest of a renowned Egyptologist and his family at Christmastime. On Christmas Day, we see Poirot and company in church while our favorite detective is schooled on the proper vocal arrangement of ‚ÄúO Come, All Ye Faithful.‚Äù\n\nAnd in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Poirot (in a burst of enthusiasm for the British war effort) leads his merry band of fellow Belgian refugees in a sort-of rousing chorus of ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Long Way to Tipperary.‚Äù\n\nPerhaps I shouldn‚Äôt mention it here, but since I have the photo up anyway‚Äì remember how Poirot points out that Mrs. Inglethorp has extended hospitality to himself and *seven* of his fellow countrymen who are refugees? Count the number of Belgians trailing along after Poirot. Are my eyes deceiving me, or is that actually eight men?\n\nHere‚Äôs another photo. Who‚Äôs the mysterious extra man?\n\nAnyway, getting back to the point of singing‚Ä¶\n\nSuchet does not consider himself much of a singer, and as a matter of fact you‚Äôll rarely see him singing in his screen roles. But there is a rare occurrence of such in the film When the Whales Came, and coincidentally, his character is once again singing ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Long Way to Tipperary.‚Äù In a decidedly inebriated state! (When the Whales Came is also set at the time of the Great War, hence the choice of song, and the music for the film was by Christopher Gunning. Small world, eh?)\n\n‚ÄúThere is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is known of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages for a good Englishman! (Pardon me, mon ami, but, as linguists, you are deplorable!)‚Äù\n\n-‚ÄúThe Kidnapped Prime Minister‚Äù\n\n* * * * *\n\nBased on what is explicitly stated in Christie‚Äôs own books, we can know that Poirot is fluent in at least four languages: French, English, German, and Italian. The French and English are self-evident. In Murder on the Orient Express, he conducts interviews with the passengers in three languages; this is where we learn that he is conversant in German. In the episode The Clocks, Poirot uses his knowledge of the construction of the German language to clear a certain English-speaking (but actually German) couple from suspicion.\n\nWe know he speaks Italian from this charming moment in Christie‚Äôs play, Black Coffee:\n\nCarelli: Ah! Monsieur Poirot. Vous voulez me questionner?\n\nPoirot: Si, Signor Dottore, si lei permette.\n\nCarelli. Ah! Lei parla Italiano?\n\nPoirot: Si, ma preferisco parlare in Francese.\n\nCarelli: Alors, qu est-ce que vous voulex me demander?\n\nHastings: I say, what the hell is all this?\n\nPoirot: Ah, the poor Hastings! We had better speak English.\n\nIt is also perfectly possible that Poirot was fluent in Flemish (that is, Belgian Dutch), which would seem a useful asset as head of police in the city of Brussels. But to my recollection, nothing is mentioned of this in the books. Hastings once or twice describes Poirot‚Äôs habits as ‚ÄúFlemish,‚Äù but the language is not commented upon. Only in the televised adaptation of The Chocolate Box is there a conversation at the D√©roulard house about the use of the Flemish language.\n\nThe television series adds further glimpses of Poirot‚Äôs cosmopolitan linguistic skills in episodes such as Triangle at Rhodes, in which he ably poses some questions to the locals in Greek AND Italian‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶And in Murder in Mesopotamia, which has the following:\n\nHastings: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you spoke Arabic, Poirot.‚Äù\n\nPoirot: ‚ÄúJust a few words that I have picked up, Hastings. One should never squander the opportunity that travel affords.‚Äù\n\nIn The Labours of Hercules, it is revealed that Poirot had never studied the Classics, having ‚Äúgot on very well without them,‚Äù at which point he is treated to a Homeric epithet in the original Greek, quoted by his friend Dr. Burton. However, in one of his labours, that of the Stymphalean Birds, he is able to solve the crime with his understanding of the average Englishman‚Äôs ignorance of foreign languages, inspiring a young man to up his linguistic game.\n\nPoirot also admits that he knows no Russian in the case of ‚ÄúThe Double Clue,‚Äù which is why he purchases First Steps in Russian to study the Cyrillic alphabet on a hunch. He learns enough of the alphabet to be ready when another Cyrillic clue of the same type‚Äì this time a monogrammed handkerchief instead of a cigarette case‚Äì presents itself to him in his adventure on the Orient Express some years later.\n\nPoirot‚Äôs English vocabulary is pretty extraordinary‚Äì not terribly surprising, considering his long-term residency in London. All the same, there are several funny moments in the books in which he expresses bewilderment at some colloquial turn of phrase. For example, there‚Äôs this little conversation with Hastings from The A.B.C. Murders:\n\n‚ÄúPerhaps some convivial idiot who had had one over the eight.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúComment? Nine? Nine what?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNothing‚Äì just an expression. I meant a fellow who was tight. No, damn it, a fellow who had had a spot too much to drink.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMerci, Hastings‚Äì the expression ‚Äòtight‚Äô I am acquainted with‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nPeter Ustinov, when playing the detective in the 1980s, took issue somewhat with the dialogue that Christie wrote for her detective. ‚ÄúOn the printed page, Poirot is no more Belgian than Major Thompson is English. In language terms we probably see him as one of those foreign schoolmasters whose English is too correct‚Äì all very fluent and fluid and quite artificial. Remember that Poirot only puts the simplest words into French, the complex ones are always left in English.‚Äù Christie herself sometimes describes Poirot, through other characters, as appearing as a sort of ‚Äúparody‚Äù of a Frenchman. For my part, Ustinov‚Äôs critique does not deter my (and presumably many fans‚Äô) enjoyment of the character‚Äôs dialogue. When Poirot uses simple French phrases like ‚Äúmon ami,‚Äù it‚Äôs fairly obvious that this isn‚Äôt because he doesn‚Äôt know how to say ‚Äúmy friend‚Äù in English‚Äì rather, he relapses into French for comfortable phrases, or idioms that are better expressed in his native tongue and perhaps also known to his English hearers (e.g., ‚Äúcherchez la femme‚Äù or ‚Äúplus √ßa change, plus c‚Äôest la m√™me chose‚Äù). Also, as the detective explains to Mr. Satterthwaite at the end of Three Act Tragedy:\n\n‚ÄúIt is true that I can speak the exact, the idiomatic English. But, my friend, to speak the broken English is an enormous asset. It leads people to despise you. They say ‚Äì a foreigner ‚Äì he can‚Äôt even speak English properly‚Ä¶ And so, you see, I put people off their guard.‚Äù\n\nOn June 21, Kingston Hospital Radio Online tweeted an interesting little tidbit about the music used in The A. B. C. Murders that Hugh Fraser retweeted, and so it came to my feed‚Ä¶\n\nFor my part, I was both delighted and sort of chagrined that I had never noticed this before. Last night I finally re-watched the episode, and the A-B-C motif positively screams to high heaven. Once heard, it cannot be unheard. I also realized that a full-fledged lay analysis was inevitable at that point, and so I watched through the episode sitting at my piano keyboard to see just what happens with the alphabet (musically) throughout the episode. I won‚Äôt go through quite the entire thing here‚Äì there are about a hundred key changes and transitions‚Äì but I‚Äôll share some of the more interesting highlights. üôÇ ***Plot spoilers ahead***\n\nThe very first thing we see in the episode, which I love, is the rack of ABC railway guides at the station where Poirot is waiting for Hastings. A familiar cane appears to straighten those that are sticking out a bit. The very blatant A-B-C notes (representing the first three notes of the A minor scale) are the first things heard, and they quickly mingle with the Poirot theme, which has been transposed up a step from G minor to A minor and also contains those first three notes. This may explain why you can watch the episode so many times without realizing you‚Äôre hearing A-B-C‚Ä¶ it just sounds like the beginning of the Poirot theme transposed (A-B-C-E-A from G-A-Bb-D-G). Clever. üôÇ\n\nThroughout the episode‚Äì for example, early on when Poirot and Hastings are first discussing the first letter‚Äì the A-B-C motif is sometimes paired with Eb-F-Gb to create a series of creepy-sounding diminished fifths. What better way to emphasize the unresolved tension of letters sent from a homicidal maniac? Diminished fifths give that delightful sensation of ‚Äúsomething is really sick and wrong here.‚Äù\n\nWhenever a new message from A. B. C. appears, the key reverts to A minor, and this also frequently happens when we encounter Cust. (Although he is also an A. B. C. in a manner of speaking, this is a bit deceptive musically because it causes the viewer/hearer to mentally associate that character with the typed letters. Sneaky!) By the time we get to Andover and the sign is zoomed in on, we get a very heavily-hammered A note. I was curious to see whether the same would hold true of the B, C, and D crimes. And sure enough‚Äì when the Bexhill poster is shown, we get a blaring B in the key of B minor, even‚Äì and later, Churston takes us to C minor! I was very giddy about this‚Ä¶ üôÇ üôÇ üôÇ There are associations with keys for the different crimes in other places, too, such as when Donald Fraser is discussing the Bexhill crime and his dreams with Poirot, and the ‚ÄúABC‚Äù theme plays in B minor again (B-C#-D).\n\nDoncaster presents some interesting musical moments, too. The drone of the D for Doncaster begins when Japp, in Poirot‚Äôs sitting room, contemplates the St Leger as a complication of plans. When Cust enters the train to travel to Doncaster with the rest of the crew, we hear a ‚ÄúA-B‚Ä¶ C-D‚Äù! And when everyone arrives in town together, sure enough, the key is switched to D minor.\n\nI just want to hug the composer at this point. But moving along. üôÇ\n\nOne of the most intriguing sections, musically, is when the crowds are congregated at the St Leger, and we see our various characters standing at their posts while Poirot parks somewhere to employ the grey cells. The music starts in A minor, and slowly modulates up by half steps through various keys, so that we get the B minor and C minor moments of earlier crimes as Poirot sits and thinks about them. This is also interspersed with Poirot‚Äôs own ‚Äúregular‚Äù G minor theme. And just when he starts to get his revelation, what happens but a determined, final resolve to D minor!\n\nWe first hear the theme in F minor (I think) when Poirot is sitting and thinking about what will happen at Doncaster. Poirot‚Äôs denouement begins in his standard G minor, but when he gets to the part of his story where Cust meets the murderer over dominoes, the F minor key returns for the ‚ÄúABC‚Äù theme. This is interesting‚Äì F for Franklin, perhaps? The reveal of the murderer takes us back to the original A minor, while the chase scene progresses through Ab minor, D minor, and F minor before returning to A minor. Franklin Clark is finally taken away by the police on a strong drone of F!!\n\nFascinating stuff!\n\n***Requisite SPOILER warning*** üôÇ\n\nThe first detective fiction oeuvre with which I was to become extensively familiar was not Agatha Christie‚Äôs. It was the Father Brown stories by G.K. Chesterton. There was an overlap in their crime fiction careers‚Äì Chesterton was the first president of the Detection Club, formed in 1930 (with Christie as a member), until his death in 1936. Christie took up the presidential mantle in 1957 until her own death nearly two decades later. In general, there‚Äôs no question that Christie imbibed the influence of Chesterton. (Incidentally, Father Brown‚Äôs sidekick is a Frenchman named Hercule Flambeau, who has, if you can believe it, some really impressive black moustaches.) In Christie‚Äôs delightful and hilarious Partners in Crime, featuring Tommy and Tuppence, the young sleuths decide to solve crimes in the styles of different classic fictional detectives, and a chapter is reserved for Father Brown. In this chapter, Chesterton readers will recognize direct allusions to his stories ‚ÄúThe Mistake of the Machine‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Invisible Man.‚Äù\n\nI remember wondering, the first time that I read The A.B.C. Murders, whether part of the initial idea for the plot was supplied by Chesterton from his story ‚ÄúThe Sign of the Broken Sword.‚Äù The two stories use similar language and adages to describe the murderer‚Äôs ingenious idea of concealing his crime by hiding one particular murder in a group of other murders.\n\nIn the great unveiling of The A.B.C. Murders, Poirot says via Christie:\n\n*****\n\n‚ÄòWhat would be the object of writing such letters? To focus attention on the writer, to call attention to the murders! En v√©rit√©, it did not seem to make sense at first sight. And then I saw light. It was to focus attention on several murders‚Äì on a group of murders‚Ä¶ When do you notice a pin least? When it is in a pincushion! When do you notice an individual murder least? When it is one of a series of related murders.‚Äô\n\n*****\n\nIn the television adaptation, Poirot couches the adage in slightly different terms:\n\n*****\n\n‚ÄúWhere is the best place for a man to hide himself?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIn a crowd of other men.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, Hastings. And where is the best place to conceal a murder?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA murder? I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ among a lot of other murders, I suppose.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPr√©cis√©ment, Hastings! At Churston, I said that the victims were chosen in a manner that was haphazard, selected only because of their initials, yes? I was wrong, Hastings. All of the victims are haphazard, yes, except for one. This monster is committing a series of murders in order to draw away our attention from one murder in particular!‚Äù\n\n*****\n\nAnd from Chesterton‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Sign of the Broken Sword,‚Äù we have this‚Ä¶\n\n*****\n\nAfter the first silence the small man said to the other:\n\n‚ÄòWhere does a wise man hide a pebble?‚Äô\n\nAnd the tall man answered in a low voice: ‚ÄòOn the beach.‚Äô\n\nThe small man nodded, and after a short silence said: ‚ÄòWhere does a wise man hide a leaf?‚Äô\n\nAnd the other answered: ‚ÄòIn the forest.‚Äô\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄòYes; the wise man hides a pebble on the beach. But what does he do if there is no beach?‚Äô\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nThe priest said again:\n\n‚ÄòWhere does a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest. But what does he do if there is no forest?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWell‚Äì well,‚Äô cried Flambeau irritably, ‚Äòwhat does he do?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHe grows a forest to hide it in,‚Äô said the priest in an obscure voice. ‚ÄòA fearful sin.‚Äô\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n‚Äò‚Ä¶If there were no forest, he would make a forest. And if he wished to hide a dead leaf, he would make a dead forest.‚Äô\n\nThere was still no reply, and the priest added still more mildly and quietly:\n\n‚ÄòAnd if a man had to hide a dead body, he would make a field of dead bodies to hide it in.‚Äô\n\n*****\n\nSome weeks ago, I ran across a more direct reference to this same Father Brown story in The Clocks! I have no idea how I could have missed it. For those of you who are more familiar with the Poirot television series, you might remember that at the beginning of Third Girl (as in the book), Poirot is sitting at the breakfast table, contemplating a book. It is his own work, an analysis of crime fiction. As it happens, in The Clocks (the Poirot story directly before Third Girl), the detective has begun to seriously study crime fiction, preparatory for that future book, and holds forth on the subject at some length to Colin Lamb. ‚ÄúThe Sign of the Broken Sword‚Äù is explicitly mentioned in the denouement.\n\n*****\n\nPoirot went on:\n\n‚ÄòIt is, as it were, the opposite of Chesterton‚Äôs, ‚ÄúWhere would you hide a leaf? In a forest. Where would you hide a pebble? On a beach.‚Äù Here there is excess, fantasy, melodrama! When I say to myself in imitation of Chesterton, ‚ÄúWhere does a middle-aged woman hide her fading beauty?‚Äù I do not reply, ‚ÄúAmongst other faded middle-aged faces.‚Äù Not at all‚Ä¶‚Äô\n\n*****\n\nNot only is Christie familiar with Chesterton‚Äôs story and that memorable, monstrous criminal notion, but Poirot is, too! The idea of hiding one significant murder among several other ‚Äúdecoy‚Äù murders is, perhaps, not original to Chesterton, but I think that his story, with its haunting language and broody atmosphere, clearly stayed in Christie‚Äôs crime-writing consciousness. She seems to be willing to attribute the idea to him. Could it have been the spark that had eventually led to The A.B.C. Murders? I don‚Äôt deny Christie‚Äôs ingenuity‚Äì she used that idea in a wonderfully inventive and original way in what would become one of her very best, most memorable novels. But in light of those striking adages, and Christie‚Äôs own familiarity with ‚ÄúBroken Sword,‚Äù I‚Äôm convinced that there is a tip of the hat to offer to Chesterton‚Äôs Father Brown there. üôÇ\n\nIn a previous post entitled ‚ÄúThe theology of the Clapham Cook,‚Äù I discussed some interesting script choices in that first episode; namely, that a passage of Scripture is read by a background character which actually encapsulates the entire theme of the episode. Something similar happens in the television adaptation of The A.B.C. Murders, coupled with a few religious artifacts of note.\n\nThose interested in fashion particularly notice the amazing wardrobe skills on display in a series like Poirot; car enthusiasts are apt to point out the vintage cars. Well, art and theology are two special hobbies of mine, and they inevitably jump out at me in viewings of the show. Sometimes this takes the form of vintage devotional items, which I always notice with great interest, and there happen to be some in this episode.\n\nThere is a flashback scene in the denouement in which Cust is receiving his new typewriter. Sitting on his little table are a few personal objects and knick-knacks, including three devotional items: a Bible, a palm cross, and what looks like a little picture or prayer card.\n\nA Bible shows up at least twice more around Cust: in his Doncaster hotel room, and in the prison cell, where he is reading it. (More on that later.) The palm cross is an interesting prop choice‚Äì it is a simple, traditional Lenten and Easter craft made from a folded blade of palm frond, sometimes from the palms used on Palm Sunday. It is a symbol of suffering, martyrdom, and future glory. It initially stood out to me because the scene takes place at a different time of year than you‚Äôd usually see palm crosses about.\n\nThe prayer card or picture is just barely visible, but due to the universal iconography of the figure, I am about 99% sure that there is a picture of St. Jude on it. That particular apostle has for many years, and certainly by the 1930s, been depicted in a white robe with a green drape over one shoulder, holding a staff or club (referencing his martyrdom), having a small flame over his head, and holding an image of Christ. The last two objects are indeterminate in the shot, but the rest are clearly visible. Compare for yourself, intrepid blog reader, whether the card in the shot above is likely to be a picture of St. Jude‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúFine, well spotted, but who cares?‚Äù you say.\n\nIt‚Äôs merely the interesting coincidence that a glance through the hagiography of St. Jude happens to show some unusual points of connection with A.B. Cust. The Catholic Church represents him as the patron saint of lost causes, things despaired of, and hopeless cases. That association has to do with the fact that St. Jude (or Judas) shares the name of another apostle, Judas Iscariot, the traitor to Jesus. The unfortunate similarity of name, and the subsequent oft-mistaken identity, apparently resulted in a sort of neglect and forgetting of St. Jude by many in the Church, and so he is regarded as a beacon of hope for things despaired of and forgotten. Does that does not ring a bell with the pitiful, forgotten, hapless Mr. Cust‚Äì who is not, in fact, the A.B.C. letter-writer, but is presented as the murderer to the police in a case of mistaken identity?\n\nBut wait, there‚Äôs more. üòâ\n\nIn his prison cell, just as Poirot enters, we can hear Cust reading from the Bible‚Äì to be specific, the Beatitudes, from the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 5. ‚ÄúAnd He taught them, saying: ‚ÄòBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit‚Äì‚Äù\n\nThe Beatitudes are a well-known Christian text that offer words of comfort and blessing by Christ to the suffering, wrongly oppressed and accused, and persecuted. Again, this fits Cust to a tee, and the reading here at least was certainly not coincidental, but chosen for that purpose.\n\nBut in other interesting details of chance: the staff or club held by St. Jude signifies that he was martyred by being bludgeoned to death, which is how the murderer commits two of his deeds, including the ‚Äúmain‚Äù murder of his brother. And also, take notice where Cust suddenly stops in his reading. ‚ÄúFor they shall inherit‚Ä¶‚Äù Unknowingly, Cust utters the real motive for the crime of which he is unjustly accused‚Äì Franklin Clarke kills in order to inherit his brother‚Äôs fortune!\n\n‚Äú‚ÄôCourse, it might be a coincidence.‚Äù\n\nOh, who am I kidding, of course I do! üòâ\n\nI don‚Äôt pretend that the particular choice of devotional items was intentional, in those particulars, for the episode, but how very well it all hangs together, n‚Äôest-ce pas?"
