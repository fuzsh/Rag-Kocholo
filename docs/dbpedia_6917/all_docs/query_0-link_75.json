Given the maturity of high school students, v/e were faced with the task of sorting and selecting from a universe of books written for the public at large, mindful particularly, however, of what : would most appeal to high school readers. The basis for organization upon which the committee finally agreed was related to the elective courses common to high school English departments today. The first broad categories. ; for this booklist came from a study of curriculum guides from all over the nation. Beyond that survey, the col- , lectiye. professional expenence of committee members furnished numerous other categories. After that, it was mostly a matter of reading and vainly trying to keep up to date with the books arriving from publishers. If in the stages committee members wearied, they none- ; ■ theiess were always a pleasure to work with. Credit and thanks must also go to the publishers who provided review copies of books ; to friends and fellow teachers who jogged our minds, challenged our ideas, and gave specific suggestions; to members of the Sec- ondary Section and the Executive Committee of the Na- tional Council of Teachers of English for their honest and frequent help; and to Paul OT)ea, director of NCTE V Publications, who pestered and persisted and helped me to pester and persist with the booklist\" committee. Several individuals deserve special niention. My wife Annette helped in all ways at all times, but along with ; Betty Whetton, she. helped particularly with the Science Fiction section. Linda Hope, Kathy McCool, and Liz Celis— coworkers all — ^helped in so many ways to make the job a little easier and a lot more fun. Thanks abo to Norma Willson, West High School, Torrance, California; Nancy Wells,. San Pedro (California) HigK School; and 5 V vi Acknowledgments Joanne Wilkinson, graduate student at the University of Illinois^ for valuable last-minute contributionis .to the J. Am Woman section, . Joy Scott assisted with correspondence, catalogued the many books , as they came in, edited many annota- tions, and did all sorts of odd jobs that were sometimes difficult but still necessary, almost always happily and always efficiently. Joy may have started her job as my secretary, but by the time we were halfway through, she had become coeditor in almost every way save the title, I herewith award her the title and say that I am most grateful for everything she has done; Finally, I would like to thank the editorial staff of the NCTE Publications Department: William Ellet, project editor, ably assisted by Carol Schanche, Kathy Stevens, Elaine Dawley, Diane Dieterich, Patricia Leedecke, and especially Lois Haig, who has persevered in this project from the beginning.

The problem is where to begin. Publishers produce thousands of titles each year and even with the recommendations of parents, teachers, librarians, and friends, locating books that fit specific interests is sometimes frustrating. Books for You is intended to make fhe search easier by providing suggestions for all kinds of readers with all sorts of interests. Teachers and librarians may use this book to recommend this or that title, but its primary purpose, from section headings to annotations, is to be of use to you, the student. No book is included just be- cause of its literary reputation as a classic or because it is considered a necessary part of everyone's reading ex- perience. The sole standard of selection for this booklist is pleasurable reading. What sort of reading will this booklist lead you to? That depends upon what you want a book to do for you. If it's relaxation and imaginative escape, see the sections Mystery, Adventure, Science Fiction, Beyond Belief, Sports, All the World's a Stage, Short S'x)ries, and Humor and Satire. Do you wonder about\" yourself nnd v.liether your problems and experience are shared by others? Beyond the concerns of the moment, what are the possibilities for your future? Books about such personal concerns are in the sections Coming of Age, Love, Problems and Young People, and Careers. , Each of us occasionally encounters ideas that have been argued for centuries and even now make us wonder, question, and doubt. Sometimes these encounters reward lis with something more than the pleasure of thinking things,, through: a better understanding of humanity. 9 ERIC 2 Introduction to the Student The sections Problems of Modern Humanity, Reflec- tions, Our Languages, Our Religions, Utopias and Com- munes. Fine Arts, and Poetry pose such universal concerns. Almost inescapable today is an awareness of social injustice in our country and others. If you worry about this issue or are simply looking for more information on it, see I Am Woman; the five Ethnic Experiences sec- tions; Urban Life, Urban Concerns; Politics, the Law, and Humanity; and the two Third World sections. The people and event of the past — and the perspective they can provide on the present — are the subjects of Western Frontier; Lives, Then and Now; th«f three sections on the United States; War; Myth and Folklore; and Digging into Our Past. Contemporary culture and leisure activities— tele- vision, movies, music, comic books, backpacking, auto racing— are covered in Mass Media, Popular Culture, and On the Move. Our physical environment is the object of many in- vestigations and the setting for much adventure. Ac- counts of these and of questions they frequently raise, such as what people and the sciences have done to help the earth or befoul it, are included in Science, Today and Tomorrow; Nature; Ecology; Skies and Mountains; and Oceans. , Before tn'\"\".ing to these sections, you should be aware of a fe*v problems faced in putting this booklist together, since i3ome of these problems are really warnings to you, the reader. We would also like to explain a few features ' of the booklist's organization. Books are like readers: they seldom allow simple de- scriptions and quick categorizations. Thus, be sure to glance through several sections and the indexes before assuming that a certain book isn't listed. Of course, some books are easy to place. For example. Zander Hollander and Hal Bock's The Complete Encyclopedia of Ice Hockey c\\ear\\y belongs in the Sports section. But others are difficult to categorize and could be placed in several sections. For example, Malcbhn X and Alex Haley's Th.Q Autobiography of Malcolm X is in the Black Ex- periences section, but it could just as easily have been put in Lives, Then and Now; Problems of Modem Hu- manity; or the United States Since the Civil War. The book is in Black Experiences because it seemed that, if 10 Introduction to the Student 3 you were searching for that book, you would expect to find it there; if you didn't know the work but were inter- ested in the section, it seemed likely that you would enjoy the autobiography of a famous black leader. , Although the committee that put together Books for You tried to be comprehensive in its selection of titles, you mny find a book you like has been- left out. If this is so, the reason could, be the inevitable differences in people's reading tastes. However, book selection was limited both by space considerations and the commit- tee's desire to include as many recent x-'orks as possible. We have indicated in the annotations of some books that they have explicit sexual scenes or language which may be offensive to some readers; but modern literature is frank and realistic, so you should be'^arned that we may not have spelled out all the problems you or your friends may see in a book. A few teachers and librarians suggested that we note certain controversial books with statements like \"This book, is antifeminist\" or !*Some readers may object to the-racism implied.\" Yet almost every book could be objected to by someone for some reason (believe it or not, that applies to books as different as the Bible, \"^SiZcw Marner, Treasure Island, Moby Dick, Slaughterhouse-Five, and Go Ask Alice), To leave out a book simply because of a hypothetical objection to it was ■ not a convincing argument to us. ; You are therefore warned that some books included here may offend, irritate, or anger you. But books that please and books that disturb may serve equally valid purposes by making you think or by challenging your beliefs. A book, almost by definition, is subversive: it dah alter what you believe to be true by testing ideas or theories you have too easily accepted. The organization of the booklist requires a brief ex- planation. The books in each section are arranged alpha- betically by author or editor; books by the same author or editor in a section are arranged alphabetically by title. 'If you are looking for a particular book or books by a particular author, see the title or author index. We have indicated \"fiction** or **no'.ifiction* for many books. However, these designations have been omitted in sections containing only fiction or noniiction (for example. Short Stories and Mass Media). Some books are also described as \"mature,\" which means they are difficult, quite long and complex, or sophisticated in tone or style. 4 Introduction^to^ the Student A typical entry for an annotated book reads this way: Aiken, Joan. Night Fall (© 1969). HR&W 1971. The first date, enclosed in parentheses, is the copy- right date; the second is the publication date for- the edition used in annotating the book. When the two dates are the same, only the one date, of course, is given. In the few cases wherq we could not determine a publica- tion date, \"n.d.** appears. An abbreviated form of the publisher's name precedes the publication date. The Directory of Publishers at the end of the book lists these abbreviations with the publishers* full names and order- ing addresses. At the end of ma ny^ an notations, you will find in parentheses '*see also\" suggestions for further reading. These books are not annotated anywhere in the booklist but are mentioned as worthwhile reading on the same topics as the annotated books. When the author is the same for both the annotated book and the \"see also\" title, the author's name is omitted in the \"see also\" entry. . With this information, you should be able to use Books for You as a convenient starting point for your ventures into reading and the pleasures it offers.
