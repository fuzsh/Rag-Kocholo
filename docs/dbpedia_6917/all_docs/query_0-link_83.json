Sometimes the rating is the exception, but it’s always good to know if there’s a risk of much more mature content than you would otherwise be expecting. Where no UK rating is available, we’ve provided the US rating, with “(US)” following it. In a few cases there are TV shows with no age rating in either the UK or the US. In situations like this, you will see “NR” – no rating. UK ratings used in this book E: Exempt. Programmes designed to inform, educate or instruct. U: Universal. Suitable for all. PG: Parental guidance. General viewing, but some scenes might be unsuitable for young children.\n\n12: Video release suitable for 12 years and over. 15: Suitable only for 15 years and over. 18: Suitable only for adults. US ratings used in this book TV-G: General audience. Most parents would find this programme suitable for all ages. TV-PG: Parental guidance suggested. This programme contains material that parents may find unsuitable for younger children. TV-Y7: Directed to older children. This programme is designed for children aged 7 and above. TV-14: Parents strongly cautioned. This programme contains some material that many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14. TV-MA: Mature audience only. This programme is specifically designed to be viewed by adults and may be unsuitable for children under 17.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nYOU WANT TO GET YOUR PULSE RACING Written by Drew Toal Whether it’s a modern crime drama or an impossibly bloody fight for the Iron Throne, the best of these shows push your heart into your throat and leave you white-knuckling the television remote. They thrill with tense standoffs, daring heists, killer robots, flawed heroes (super-powered or otherwise), and sometimes just good, old-fashioned detective work. If it’s adrenaline you crave, these are the shows for you.\n\n7\n\nGAME OF THRONES FANTASY • 2011 • RATED: 18 • 57 MINS • SEASONS: 8 PETER DINKLAGE, LENA HEADEY, EMILIA CLARKE HBO’s award-winning adaptation of George R.R. Martin’s epic fantasy opus is known for its swords, sex, dragons, and ice zombies. In an era of streaming on demand, Game of Thrones quickly became appointment television across the globe. “Winter is coming.” Before the game of thrones ends, these fateful words will be uttered dozens of times, by a huge cast of characters. For Eddard “Ned” Stark (Sean Bean) and his family – the primary protagonists of the series – the motto serves not just as an ominous weather forecast, but also as a warning and a promise.\n\n“ If you think this has a happy ending, you haven’t been paying attention.” Ramsay Bolton (S3 E6)\n\n8\n\nThe Starks are a noble family hailing from Winterfell, a kingdom situated in the north of Westeros. One day, King Robert Baratheon comes to town and recruits his old friend, Ned, to help him run the fractured government from the capital, King’s Landing. Against his better judgement, Ned agrees, a fateful decision that will have far-reaching consequences for the entire world. Ned’s family, including his wife Catelyn, sons Robb, Bran, and Rickon, daughters Sansa and Arya, and wards Jon Snow and Theon Greyjoy, are soon swept from their relatively idyllic existence into a maelstrom of medieval realpolitik. King’s Landing is a snake pit, with duelling factions that make our own political divides look extremely quaint in comparison. In Game of Thrones, conspiracies, intrigues, and murder are the true currency of the realm – you win or you die. While a creeping existential threat emerges in the wilderness “beyond the Wall” in the form of an undead army-slash-heavy-handed climate change allegory, warlords across the land ignore the real danger and instead use every tool at their disposal to settle scores and\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN... YOU WANT TO GET YOUR PULSE RACING\n\nDEATHS PER SEASON IN GAME OF THRONES\n\nS8\n\n3,523\n\nS7\n\n1,096\n\nS6\n\n540\n\nS5\n\n246\n\nS4\n\n182\n\nS3\n\n87\n\nS2\n\n130\n\nS1\n\nNumber of deaths\n\n59\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\nsquabble over the crown. More often than not, these sadistic machinations leave a trail of bodies that occasionally leads one to wonder whether or not there will be any subjects left to rule by the time the show ends. This is no run-of-the-mill swords-and-sorcery TV project. Showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss took George R.R. Martin’s beloved books and gave them the true big-screen treatment. Along the way, they even create the longest battle sequence in both TV and film history! Throughout eight seasons, you meet iconic characters and watch them grow – the lucky ones who survive, anyhow – and see allegiances shift. You meet dragons and their “mother”, the exiled Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, played by Emilia Clarke. You also meet a rogues’ gallery of vicious villains, including the scheming Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen), the brutally sadistic Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon), and, of course,\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\npower-hungry Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey). Characters who are at one time mortal enemies become allies of necessity, and then something close to friends. This is not the kind of story in which the good guys always win. Indeed, in Game of Thrones, it’s not always clear who the good guys even are. If the show does have a conscience, it comes in the person of Peter Dinklage’s Tyrion Lannister, a hard-drinking, melancholic dwarf who also happens to hail from one of the most powerful families in the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion has a powerful intellect and a biting wit – and also something of a wine dependency. He is a captive witness, as we all are, to a singular adventure, and one of the grandest productions in TV history. Even in an era of “prestige TV”, Game of Thrones pushed the limits of the medium and cemented its place in pop-culture history.\n\nCREATORS: David Benioff, D.B.

Walter soon learns he has a talent for the drug game.\n\nas drug kingpins, learning what to do – and, more often, what not to do – as they go along. Walter makes money, but his noble intentions to support his family quickly give way to his long-suppressed ambition to do something big with his life.\n\nWhen we first meet Walter (Bryan Cranston), he’s not much to look at. Considered a brilliant mind in his younger days, he’s now a sad 50-year-old high school chemistry teacher in New Mexico. After learning he has terminal lung cancer, Walter puts his skills to more unsavoury – albeit more lucrative – use. He hooks up with crystal meth enthusiast Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), and the pair form an unlikely, uneasy alliance, and a new business.\n\nThroughout Breaking Bad’s five seasons we meet some memorable characters as Walter builds up his empire, including dour fixer Mike Ehrmantraut, businessman Gus Fring, and seedy lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), whose character was so popular it spawned the spin-off, Better Call Saul (see p349).\n\nWalter’s initial goal is to financially set up his son, unborn daughter, and wife Skyler for when he’s gone. He understands the chemistry involved in the drug’s production intimately, perhaps better than anyone, but in all other respects he is in over his head. Jesse and Walter nevertheless dive into their new career\n\n10\n\nWalter White is no hero, but much of Breaking Bad’s appeal lies in the actualization of his particular mid-life crisis. He’s just this guy, living an unremarkable life in the American Southwest, who latches on to a piece of bad news, and uses it to get some agency back in his life. He takes his frustrations over his imminent death and channels them into something that reminds him what it’s like to feel alive. We can all relate to that.\n\nCREATOR:Vince Gilligan PRODUCTION CO: High Bridge Productions, Gran Via Productions, Sony Pictures Television, AMC\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN... YOU WANT TO GET YOUR PULSE RACING\n\nTHE MANDALORIAN SCI-FI • 2019 • RATED: PG • 30 MINS • SEASONS: 2 PEDRO PASCAL, GINA CARANO, WERNER HERZOG Beginning on a backwater planet several years after the events of Return of the Jedi, this original Star Wars series, which helped launch the Disney+ streaming service, follows a gunfighter who earns his keep as a bounty hunter. In the post-Empire galaxy, the economy isn’t exactly booming, but bounty hunting still pays the bills. When one of its practitioners, a gloomy individual known as the Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal), accepts a high-risk, high-reward contract, it brings him into contact with the cutest target he’s ever faced – a child of the same species as renowned Jedi Master Yoda. Bounty hunters have always played an outsized role in Star Wars mythology. Boba Fett had just a few minutes of screen time in the original movie trilogy, but became one of the most\n\nmemorable characters to come out of a franchise packed with ready-made action figures. Although you never saw his face in the first movies, Fett exuded a palpable coolness. He couldn’t wield the Force, but you just knew he was more than a match for any Jedi through sheer cunning, toughness, some kind of obscure martial art (probably), and his undeniably cool Mandalorian armour.\n\n“ I’m a Mandalorian. Weapons are part of my religion.” The Mandalorian (S1 E2) So it’s perhaps no surprise that this iconic armour was chosen as the symbol of the marquee series that helped launch the Disney+ streaming service in 2019. Fun for kids and long-time fans alike, The Mandalorian truly embraces George Lucas’s interest in westerns and samurai films. Mando is basically Clint Eastwood’s “Man with No Name”, but in a galaxy far, far away. This lone wolf has a moral code, but seemingly no family or close friends. He lives for the job – until his encounter with “The Child” warms his cold, mercenary heart. For a franchise often mired in nostalgia, The Mandalorian shows how Star Wars can still give fans what they want (jawas, stormtroopers, droids…), while also telling an original story with universal appeal. This slickly entertaining space western is among the best Star Wars offshoots since 1983.\n\nCREATOR: Jon Favreau PRODUCTION CO: Fairview Entertainment, Golem Creations, Lucasfilm, Walt Disney Studios\n\n11\n\nTHE FLASH ACTION • 2014 RATED: 12 • 43 MINS Barry Allen is fast. Like, really fast. Faster than Superman fast. So, what does he do with this skill? He assumes the mantle of The Flash and uses his powers to fight crime in Central City. Following a laboratory accident, crime scene investigator Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) goes into a coma. He wakes up to find he can move at a speed far beyond the threshold of normal\n\nhumans. Taking on the alias of The Flash, Allen learns that he’s not the only one with new powers, and vows to fight those using their super-power abilities for evil. As a show about a guy who runs really fast The Flash wouldn’t be all that interesting, but it delves into some deep philosophical and narrative waters, mostly involving time travel, alternate universes, and temporal paradoxes. With crossovers from Arrow (see p36) and Supergirl (see p93), this series has created a fun Super Hero universe all of its own across six seasons of speed.\n\nLINE OF DUTY CRIME DRAMA • 2012 • RATED: 15 • 60 MINS • SEASONS: 6 MARTIN COMPSTON, VICKY MCCLURE, ADRIAN DUNBAR Trust no one! This series is far from a standard police procedural – it turns your expectations on their head. In the Line of Duty world of anti-corruption, the line between criminals and those charged with keeping them behind bars is blurred, at times beyond recognition. After a fatal accident during a police terrorism sting gone wrong, anti-terrorism officer Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) refuses to join the department’s efforts to cover it up. Shunned by his fellow officers who see him as a turncoat, Arnott’s unpopular moral stance is noted by others and he is recruited to AC-12, a police anti-corruption unit. Written and directed by Jed Mercurio, Line of Duty centres on AC-12’s work as it uncovers corruption in the police force. Arnott is suited to the work, and soon teams up with an undercover specialist named Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) to root out officers who skirt 12\n\nor break the law. As Arnott, Fleming, and their boss, Superintendent Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), run down dirty cops, they discover traces of a ringleader with ties to organized crime near the top of the police hierarchy. The team have yet to identify this mysterious figure, known only as “H”, but as they bring down corrupt police during the course of each season, they inch ever closer to revealing the person’s identity. Prepare to binge your way through this thrilling series, fella.\n\n“ There’s a line. It’s called right and wrong, and I know which side my duty lies.” Ted Hastings (S3 E6)\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN... YOU WANT TO GET YOUR PULSE RACING\n\nTHE NIGHT OF CRIME DRAMA • 2016 • RATED: 15 • 57–95 MINS • SEASONS: 1 RIZ AHMED, JOHN TURTURRO, MICHAEL K. WILLIAMS Want an up-close and personal look at the nightmare that is the US criminal justice system? Then this is the series for you. Naz goes out one night and ends up blacking out. When he comes to, he’s implicated in a murder he can’t be sure he didn’t commit. Naz (Riz Ahmed) needs a break. One night, he “borrows” his father’s cab to go to a party. Bystanders, understandably, mistake him for a cab driver. One of these, Andrea, convinces Naz to party with her. Drugs and alcohol are consumed. Things get hazy. When Naz’s evening is over, he’s left with something measurably worse than a bad hangover. We don’t know if Naz is guilty or not, but he’s not doing himself any favours with his erratic behaviour as the police close in on him. As he awaits his trial, a slightly eccentric lawyer named John Stone ( John Turturro) agrees to\n\nDEUTSCHLAND 83 SPY THRILLER • 2015 RATED: 15 • 42 MINS Martin Rauch is 24 and ready to do his duty for his country. Sounds like a typical military drama, right? But in ’80s East Germany “doing your duty” means training as a spy and infiltrating the West for the Stasi. Martin Rauch ( Jonas Nay) is a young border guard working for the East German military in 1983. In these days before the fall of the Berlin\n\ntake his case. The question is: can Naz survive the brutal prison where he’s awaiting trial long enough to clear his name? Whether or not you believe Naz is guilty, seeing him await his day in court at a notorious New York prison is chilling. Ahmed and Turturro both turn in A+ performances in the best crime drama of 2016.\n\n“ Even if you can’t remember anything, you’d know it, you’d feel it. I’m not a murderer.” Naz Khan (S1 E3)\n\nWall, he’s a true believer in the Soviet cause, and is willing to do whatever it takes to protect his homeland. It turns out this will require his being spirited off to West Germany, where he will undergo training as a spy and report back to his handlers. Deutschland 83 is a vibrant one-season Cold War-era thriller, told from the perspective of a young man repelled by Western values, but still willing to question the motives of his own superiors. The show was supplemented by an incredible soundtrack straight out of the 1980s, and was followed by two sequels.\n\n13\n\nCSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION CRIME • 2000 RATED: 18 • 60 MINS For 15 seasons, this ground-breaking procedural drama spawned not only some incredible forensic investigations, but also multiple spin-offs and copycats. Have you heard of “the CSI effect”? It’s a term used by legal and law enforcement officials to refer to jurors who expect more forensic\n\nTHE BRIDGE CRIME • 2011 RATED: 15 • 60 MINS In an attempt to highlight problems affecting Denmark and Sweden, a killer leaves parts of two dead bodies on the bridge that spans the border between the countries. Since its premiere in 2011, The Bridge has been remade in both the UK and the US, but nothing beats the original. When what appears to be a bisected dead body is found at the\n\nDARK SCI-FI • 2017 RATED: 15 • 60 MINS Kids are vanishing from the German town of Winden. Why? No one knows. It may have something to do with the wormhole connecting various points in time to a cave system under the town. Children are disappearing from Winden, and the explanation isn’t as simple as kidnappings or runaways. Underneath the town, a series of caves connect to a wormhole that links\n\n14\n\nevidence during criminal trials, thereby raising the standard of proof for prosecutors. That this forensic crime series has infiltrated culture to such a degree is a testament to its influence. Starring the likes of Ted Danson, Laurence Fishburne, and Elisabeth Shue over the course of its run, CSI takes something kind of gross and boring – police lab work – and turns it into something fun and interesting. Set in Las Vegas, episodes see the team combing dead bodies for evidence and using it to close cases that otherwise might have remained unsolved.\n\nexact centre of the Øresund Bridge, which connects Sweden and Denmark, a collaborative investigation is launched between the two countries. The show plays off of the subtle cultural differences between Denmark and Sweden as it brings together Sweden’s Saga Norén (Sofia Helin) and Denmark’s Martin Rohde (Kim Bodnia) to interpret the message the killer is trying to send, and crack the case. Running for four seasons, The Bridge is a suitably bleak and atmospheric affair, something its various remakes could never quite recapture.\n\nthe present day with 33-year jumps into the past, to both 1986 and 1953. Four families find their lives inextricably linked as the mystery unfolds over three seasons. For a show to follow through on the logical implications of time travel, paradoxes and all, is an incredibly challenging feat to pull off. This German series does it right, setting up a solid foundation for its foray into multiple timelines and a riddle shrouded in mystery. Does it occasionally make your brain nearly explode? Yes. Should you take notes as you watch? Probably. Is it worth it? Most definitely.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN... YOU WANT TO GET YOUR PULSE RACING\n\nPRISONERS OF WAR DRAMA • 2009 RATED: 15 • 50 MINS Following two Israeli soldiers who come home after years of imprisonment and try to piece their lives back together, Prisoners of War is the direct precursor to Homeland. Seventeen years ago, there were no smartphones, Prince and Bowie were still alive, Amazon Prime didn’t exist, and in the US Netflix sent DVDs to your home. It would be\n\nDUBLIN MURDERS CRIME • 2019 RATED: 15 • 60 MINS Childhood trauma never really goes away, as two cops discover when they’re pulled into a murder investigation and find ghosts from their own pasts dogging their present footsteps. Adapting a cult book is not for the faint of heart. Adapting two and turning them into a single-season series is downright audacious. Fans should be reassured that this is, for the\n\nTHE BREAK CRIME • 2016 RATED: 15 • 52 MINS Sometimes it feels as though the chief export of small idyllic towns – such as the quaint, Belgian setting of The Break – is murder. Luckily, they also trade in tense plots and engaging TV. In a small town in Belgium the body of a football player is pulled out of the river. Police inspector Yoann Peeters (Yoann Blanc) has just moved back home from Brussels with\n\njarring, to say the least, to disappear for such a length of time, re-emerge, and try to make sense of the world and your place in it. In Prisoners of War, two Israeli soldiers, Nimrod (Yoram Toledano) and Uri (Ishai Golan) are released after being imprisoned for nearly two decades. They are celebrities, but find their families have either moved on or barely know who they are. And something about their stories doesn’t quite add up. Spanning two seasons, Prisoners of War is less glitzy than its US cousin, Homeland (see p25), but it also tells a deeper, more believable story.\n\nmost part, a faithful adaptation of Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad books – specifically In the Woods and The Likeness – although it’s not always as neat a blend as they might like. Investigators Rob Reilly (Killian Scott) and Cassie Maddox (Sarah Greene) are looking into the grisly murder of a young girl, reminiscent of a killing decades earlier in 1985. This is one of those situations where everyone is a suspect, especially the girl’s weirdly creepy family. But our heroic officers also have some skeletons in their own respective closets.\n\nhis daughter and is brought in to help out the local police with the case. He’s less than impressed with their level of professionalism when it comes to investigating a murder and quickly determines this was no simple suicide. But then again, when it comes to this case, nothing is simple. Running two seasons, The Break has the usual array of false leads, creepy forests, creepier familial dynamics, and puzzling flashbacks. The real takeaway, though, is Blanc’s performance. He looks and speaks like an actual detective, rather than an actor playing a detective on TV.\n\n15\n\nTHE BOYS ACTION • 2019 • RATED: 15 • 60 MINS • SEASONS: 1 KARL URBAN, JACK QUAID, ERIN MORIARTY What happens when superheroes use their superpowers for bad? The Boys are a team of normal-powered people fighting back against super-powered celebs who aren’t the heroes they should be. Things could get nasty! The Boys, an adaptation of the comic book written by Garth Ennis, is less of a harmless Comic-Con thought exercise and more a matter of life and death. In the real world, superhero movies are big business. In the world of The Boys, it’s the superheroes themselves who make the money. These demigod influencers are adored by the public, get rich with lucrative endorsement deals, and love taking selfies. Imagine if Harry Styles could fly and shoot deadly lasers out of his eyes, and you get the general idea.\n\non the radar of Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), a foul-mouthed renegade with quite the story to tell. “See, people love that cosy feeling supes give them,” Butcher explains. “But if you knew half the s**t they get up to… F**kin’ diabolical.” The Boys creator Garth Ennis has a penchant for spectacular violence that often verges on the cartoonish. The Boys is no exception, but the show also pokes holes in our celebrityobsessed culture, and plays with the idea that absolute power corrupts absolutely. If Superman one day decided to treat people like bugs instead of friends and colleagues, what could we do to stop him? It’s a question The Boys aims to find out.\n\n“ Why have average when you can have extraordinary?” Madelyn Stillwell (S1 E2) Every kid wants to be a superhero, and we follow a young woman named Starlight (Erin Moriarty), née Annie January, who plans on joining Earth’s most popular “supes” team, The Seven, owned by corporate giant Vought International, whose vice-president is the Machiavellian Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue). Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid), on the other hand, is just a normal guy working a normal job. Then one day a terrible accident brings him to the attention of The Seven. It also puts Hughie 16\n\nCREATOR: Eric Kripke, Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen PRODUCTION CO: Amazon Studios, Original Film, Point Grey Pictures, Sony Pictures Television\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN...

Spooks follows the work of a team of MI5 officers, headed by the dependable Harry Pearce (Peter Firth), as they defend queen and country against a multitude of global threats\n\nis still struggling with the sudden death of her daughter, Becky, some years before the events of the first season. Becky was driven to suicide after being raped by Tommy Lee Royce ( James Norton). Becky’s son now lives with Catherine and her sister, Clare, a recovering addict, and is getting into fights at school. Tommy is released from prison, and this event leads Catherine down a dark and twisting path, but throughout the show’s two seasons she never loses her stoic equanimity. Sarah Lancashire imbues the character with incredible humanity in the face of bleak truths.\n\nthe onerous tasks needed to keep the lives of L.A.’s monied set running smoothly. Ray Donovan doesn’t have the traditional atmosphere of a California noir, but it’s one of Showtime’s most popular dramas of all time for a reason. Watching Ray try to balance his rather unconventional career with his dysfunctional family – Jon Voight won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Mickey, Ray’s ex-con father – is the true embodiment of the American dream. There was huge disappointment when the show was dropped after seven seasons.\n\n(Spooks was known in some countries as MI-5). The series had a strong list of rotating guest stars, with the ever-present threat of one of them being eliminated in spectacular fashion – in the world of Spooks nobody is safe. The show became notorious early on in its run. In the second episode a character played by Lisa Faulkner is gruesomely tortured before being shot in the head, triggering numerous complaints from viewers. Despite the controversy, or perhaps because of it, the show maintained high audience numbers throughout its 10-season run.\n\n17\n\nHOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER THRILLER • 2014 RATED: 15 • 43 MINS You can learn a lot in an internship, like how to fetch coffee, make copies, and – in some extremely rare cases – how to commit and cover up a murder.

She’s all set to move to Sweden and start her new life there when a 19-year-old girl is raped and murdered\n\nTHE KILLING (US) CRIME • 2011 RATED: 15 • 45 MINS If you’re no fan of subtitles, but love a dark crime drama, this US remake of the hit Danish series could be the show for you.

Two, it takes place in Seattle, and is filmed in English for the subtitle-averse\n\n18\n\ncareers are about to be upended in the craziest way possible. Through flashbacks, the series works towards the middle of its story from the beginning and the end. How do they go from accepting their dream legal jobs to disposing of a body and destroying evidence? In this six-season show Viola Davis is truly wonderful as the troubled but talented law firm head Annalise Keating. She carries the series, even when the intricate setups in each season – while always fun – sometimes crumble under their ambition when it comes to the payoff.\n\nand she decides to work one last case. Lund and her incoming replacement, Jan Meyer (Søren Malling), spend the next three weeks investigating a killing that many in Copenhagen do not want them to solve. Police procedurals historically follow standard formulas. Over three seasons, The Killing elevates everything, from the acting to the atmosphere to the red herrings. Its global influence is apparent everywhere. If you’ve enjoyed a crime drama with a moody tone and high production values in the last decade, you have The Killing to thank.\n\nAmerican public. Three, it rains a lot. And finally, over its four seasons, some of its plot twists mirror a less playful Twin Peaks (see p456) in vague but undeniable ways. Like its Danish counterpart, The Killing follows two cops, Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) and Stephen Holder ( Joel Kinnaman), as they investigate crimes. There is some real on-screen chemistry here – Enos and Kinnaman also star together in Amazon’s Hanna (see p24) – and while it doesn’t quite live up to the original, it’s still a solid adaptation.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN...

Ciro does his best for his boss, Don Pietro (Fortunato Cerlino), and Don Pietro’s son, Gennaro, but he has ambitions of his own. It’s unfairly reductive to call Gomorrah a simple crime drama when it’s so much more.

The violence is, if anything, a distraction from the real, more intangible drama in this four-season series.\n\nsuch as They Live!) or TVs melting our brains. And nothing encapsulated that fear better than Max Headroom, the short-lived dystopian sci-fi show that ran for two short seasons. Edison Carter (Matt Frewer) is a reporter for Network 23. After an accident, the network tries to save the brand by downloading his brain into a computer. The result is Max Headroom, a stuttering, wisecracking, digitized version of the man. The show is like nothing else on TV before or since, and Max was, for a time, a virtual celebrity, complete with his own endorsements.\n\nabout is that Treadstone – the code name for the CIA assassin-training programme that spawned Bourne – is at the centre of it. Treadstone’s one season gives us a glimpse into the programme. In 1973 in East Berlin, a CIA operative, J.

Fast forward to the present day, where a Korean general is making statements about the “cicadas” being “activated”. Much fighting ensues.

After two tours of duty in Iraq, Jonathan Pine (Tom Hiddleston) is settled into civilian life working at the Nefertiti Hotel in Cairo. That all changes when Pine becomes involved with a woman named Sophie Alekan (Aure Atika). She’s connected to the powerful Hamid family, and passes along sensitive information to Pine concerning a huge international weapons deal between the family and arms dealer Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie). Using connections from his military days, Pine sends the damning info to British intelligence, but a leak there allows Roper to escape.\n\nSONS OF ANARCHY CRIME DRAMA • 2008 RATED: 18 • 45 MINS Jax Teller is an unconventional CEO dealing with a host of organizational issues – everything from running guns, to rival gangs, and run-ins with the law. The above description makes sense as soon as you realize that Jax (Charlie Hunnam) is the head of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (SAMCRO). Loosely based on the real-life Hells Angels Motorcycle Club,\n\n20\n\nWe next meet Pine four years later working at a Swiss hotel. When Roper walks back into his life he has a life-changing decision to make.\n\n“ Nothing quite as pretty as napalm at night.” Richard Roper (S1 E5) There’s something deliciously understated about The Night Manager that suits Hiddleston’s acting style perfectly, while Laurie gives arguably his best-ever performance (both won Golden Globes). Pine is the quintessential le Carré hero, but Laurie’s Roper dispenses the better advice. His timely reminder to Pine is one no viewer watching the show should forget: “Anyone can betray anyone, Jonathan.”\n\nSons of Anarchy charts the lives of a group of modern-day outlaws carving out a home in California’s Central Valley. Through seven anarchic seasons, SAMCRO fights to stay true to itself while battling enemies both internal and external. Jax struggles with the legacy of his father (who founded the group), and challenges himself with being a better dad to his son, Abel. Having recruited a number of actual Hells Angels members to the cast, Sons of Anarchy, at its best, manages to harness an outlaw spirit that brought it a devoted following.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN...

It’s all there in Spiral, where silver linings are rarely found.

If this 1997 prison drama hadn’t been as successful as it was, beloved shows such as The Sopranos, The Wire, and Game of Thrones might never have seen the light of day. Set in the fictional Oswald State Correctional Facility, Oz is HBO’s first-ever hour-long drama series and a pioneer of prestige TV. A number of top TV actors, including\n\nLEGENDS CRIME DRAMA • 2014 RATED: 15 • 60 MINS What happens when an undercover agent gets in too deep and loses track of his real identity? That’s the question for the FBI’s Martin Odum in Legends. Based on Legends: A Novel of Dissimulation by Robert Littell, this tells the story of FBI agent Martin Odum (Sean Bean), whose “legends” – or fake identities – are used to infiltrate criminal enterprises. At the same time, though,\n\nIn Season 1, police captain Laure Berthaud (Caroline Proust) and deputy prosecutor Pierre Clément (Grégory Fitoussi) investigate a crime involving a murdered and mutilated Romanian girl, with the trail implicating the rich and powerful. This is a world in which even the most well-meaning characters are forced into uncomfortable choices between justice and loyalty. Due to some extremely graphic elements, Spiral is not for the faint-hearted. But for anyone looking for a journey into the heart of darkness, this is the show for you.\n\nChristopher Meloni as an incarcerated serial killer named Chris Keller and Edie Falco as Officer Diane Whittlesey, made their HBO debuts in the show. Oz unquestionably traffics in shock value and gratuitous violence. The incarcerated population of the unit known as “Emerald City” (minus the skipping along a yellow brick road!) jockeys for influence and power over their fellow inmates and those who patrol the block. But the show was unquestionably ahead of its time, and the influence of its six seasons can still be felt today.\n\nthey also serve to mask confusion around his own past. As Odum struggles with his true identity, a deeper mystery reveals itself. Season 1 of Legends is an uneven affair, but stick with it – it finds its voice in Season 2, which focuses more on Odum’s past and tells a dual narrative in different time periods, much like Season 1 of True Detective (see p28). It’s a decidedly more mature approach that plays to Bean’s strengths, and a stronger, more cohesive story unfolds. Unfortunately, we’ll never see what the series could have become as it was cancelled before Season 3.\n\n21\n\nHELIX SCI-FI • 2014 RATED: 15 • 40 MINS A team of scientists battle with a super virus that turns people into gross zombies in this sci-fi thriller set in a remote Arctic research facility.

What they find there\n\nINFORMER CRIME • 2018 RATED: 15 • 60 MINS No one likes a snitch, but there’s plenty to love about Informer, a gripping, disjointed thriller, to make us question everything we think we know. Police informers are not generally thought of in positive terms. “Snitches get stitches” is the approach of those getting informed on, and police handlers often take a pretty dim view of their sources’ moral rectitude.\n\nLOCKED UP PRISON DRAMA • 2015 RATED: 15 • 53 MINS Finished Orange Is the New Black and looking for a replacement? This Spanish series (also known as Vis a vis) has a similar setup, but with a raunchier, faster-paced quality. We all do stupid things for love, and Macarena Ferreiro (Maggie Civantos) is no exception. Her boss-slash-lover sets her up to take the fall for his own dodgy accounting practices, and\n\n22\n\nwill not be solved by social distancing and soon all hell breaks loose. The sinister Ilaria Corporation is playing a dangerous game, with its own inscrutable goals. Dr Julia Walker (Kyra Zagorsky) could be the key to it all. Finding monsters at isolated Arctic research stations isn’t a novel concept – shout out to The Thing – but even when the show moves to a remote island in the second and final season, Helix has some pretty wild plot developments that push it from science fiction into pure fantasy. But don’t worry, that’s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nDS Gabe Waters (Paddy Considine), a counter-terrorist agent, recognizes a good informer’s value. When a café is bombed, the story jumps back a year to focus on a Pakistani immigrant named Raza Shar (Nabhaan Rizwan) who is working for Waters. By the end, Shar may get worse than stitches. Running over one tight, eight-episode season, Informer has excellent plotting and acting. One thing that sets it apart is how deftly it deals with issues such as immigration, race, criminal justice, and other issues so confounding to both society and television in today’s world.\n\nshe’s sent away to Cruz del Sur prison in Spain. Macarena, like Orange Is the New Black’s Piper Chapman (see p357), is not initially suited to prison life, and it’s unclear if she’ll last the day, let alone her seven-year sentence. But such circumstances sometimes uncover reserves a person doesn’t know they have. A strong female cast and interesting storytelling choices (direct to camera interviews with the inmates, for instance) set this apart from other prison shows, but its four seasons also feature plenty of sex and violence (in case you were wondering).\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN...

The famously introspective Swedish detective is the godfather of so-called “Scandi Noir”. The British version of the Swedish series Wallander, itself based on the books by Henning Mankell, puts Kenneth Branagh in the shoes of the brooding Scandinavian Poirot.\n\nSACRED GAMES THRILLER • 2018 RATED: 18 • 50 MINS This Indian Netflix series is a bit like 24, but set in Mumbai where the Jack Bauer-style main character has 25 days to avert a catastrophe. Inspector Sartaj Singh (Saif Ali Khan) is having a rough time. He works for an extremely corrupt police force, where his relative honesty has hampered his prospects for any promotion. But when he’s contacted\n\nleaving her because he feels as though they’ve grown apart, while their children are away at boarding school. So Marcella, her family life in shambles, returns to police work as a serial killer responsible for three unsolved murders reappears. The only problem? She experiences memory blackouts and there’s some evidence she gets violent in her fugue state. It’s not entirely clear why Marcella is allowed to work at all given her various problems, but this two-season series has a solid gimmick that lends uncertainty to its plot.\n\n(Branagh would go on to play Poirot in the 2017 film Murder on the Orient Express.) Through four seasons, Wallander and his crack team of investigators solve cases in the small Swedish hamlet of Ystad. The fact that this series is in English but takes place in Sweden is only mildly distracting, while Branagh brings his own flavour to the dour detective. It seems audiences can’t get enough of the bleak, washed-out settings of “Scandi Noir”, and Wallander remains among the first and best of the genre. Come and see where it all started.\n\nby reclusive crime figure Ganesh Gaitonde (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) and told he has 25 days to save the city, his adventure truly begins. Sacred Games jumps around between different timelines. One follows Gaitonde’s life from his earliest days to his becoming nearly a “god”, at least in his own mind, while another flashes forward into Singh’s journey into the slums of Mumbai. In contrast to many hard-bitten crime dramas, Sacred Games can verge on the fantastical over its two seasons, but it’s pleasingly weird and artfully shot.\n\n23\n\nDAMAGES THRILLER • 2007 RATED: 15 • 60 MINS Lawyers are not generally thought of as warm and cuddly – a stereotype that’s reinforced in Damages, a high-stakes legal thriller that focuses on a single case per season and messes with your mind by playing with time. Glenn Close stars as high-powered, ruthless, and controversial attorney Patty Hewes, while Rose Byrne is young, up-and-coming attorney\n\nHANNA ACTION • 2019 RATED: 15 • 60 MINS Based on the 2011 film of the same name, Hanna is the story of a 15-yearold girl with incredible abilities who is being hunted by the CIA.

In Season 1, the attorneys at Hewes & Associates are representing employees of billionaire fraudster Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson), and things are not always as they seem. Damages is first and foremost a vehicle for Glenn Close at her most steely and unnerving. The show uses flashbacks to lead the audience off the scent and keeps a single legal narrative going throughout its entire five seasons. This structure makes it stand out among the host of comparable, yet more conventional law shows available to watch.\n\nHer father, Erik ( Joel Kinnaman), gets Hanna out and raises her in the wilds of Poland, where he trains her to be a peerless hunter and fighter. But the CIA has never stopped looking for its lost asset, and when an agent named Marissa (Mireille Enos) learns of Hanna’s survival, the chase is on. Hanna might be an augmented super teen with an unconventional childhood, but she is also subject to the same wants and anxieties as a normal kid her age.

Things quickly go from bad to weird for the group when they learn that the island is not quite as uninhabited as they first thought. Each of the six seasons adds another level of mystery. Lost is a ground-breaking show in many ways. It’s incredibly ambitious (one could argue at times too ambitious), and a major precursor to the current prestige TV era. The ensemble cast are uniformly terrific, and as one mystery is seemingly solved, half a dozen more pop up to take its place. Lost is unquestionably the most influential show of the early 2000s.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN...

Her own zealotry to get the job done often puts her in personal and professional danger, but it’s sometimes the only thing that can stop terrorist plots in this post-9/11 thriller. The first two seasons of Homeland are some of the most suspenseful TV that the genre has to offer. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) returns home after years of being held captive by a terrorist leader named Abu Nazir. Meanwhile, CIA operative Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) is demoted from her overseas assignment and sent to work at CIA headquarters in Virginia. She suspects that Brody, considered a war hero after his rescue, is in league with Nazir and plotting an attack on the United States.

Like films such as All the President’s Men or Spotlight, State of Play demonstrates the role that journalists still play in holding those in power accountable. The reporters are in over their head and in harm’s way, but they refuse to be silenced – even as a gag order from on high is issued to prevent the story from running and the truth being told.\n\n27\n\nTRUE DETECTIVE CRIME DRAMA • 2014 • RATED: 18 • 55 MINS • SEASONS: 3 MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY, COLIN FARRELL, MAHERSHALA ALI Nihilism, crime, police work, and supernatural happenings are mixed together in deliciously diabolical ways in Nic Pizzolatto’s anthology series. If tense Southern Gothic weirdness and philosophical police procedurals are your thing, True Detective is the series for you. Each of the three seasons has its own story and an entirely different cast. In Season 1 of True Detective, a 1995 murder in Louisiana sets two homicide cops on a winding path that doesn’t end until 17 years later. One of the detectives, Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey), struggles with depression and alcoholism. His partner on the case, Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson), is having some of his own troubles at home.\n\nCohle memorably says, “Time is a flat circle”. The show adheres to that idea, and bounces between a few different timelines. In 2012 (the present day), Cohle and Hart are being interviewed about their roles in the stillunsolved 1995 case and Cohle, in particular, is still haunted by the questions that have been left unanswered for nearly two decades. True Detective’s first season is still its best. Season 2 moves from the American South to the sunny shores of California, starring Colin Farrell as a corrupt detective named Ray Velcoro, Rachel McAdams as Detective Sergeant Antigone “Ani” Bezzerides, and Vince Vaughn as a career criminal trying to go straight. Despite the decent performances, strong visuals, and exciting action, this instalment lacks the haunting atmosphere that made Season 1 so powerful. Season 3, starring Mahershala Ali as Detective Wayne Hays and Stephen Dorff as his partner, Roland West, gets back to True Detective basics. After two young children disappear in the Ozarks in 1980, Hays and West are brought in to find them. In a future timeline, Hays is being interviewed about the case for a true-crime podcast, even though his memory is failing him and the retired detective becomes increasingly unsure about what’s real and what isn’t. Driven by Ali’s hypnotic performance, Season 3 also explores issues of racism and class. But ultimately it’s the uncertainty of memory, the inability to disentangle the real from the imagined in the face of unspeakable crimes, and the grappling with the past, that unites it with the rest of the True Detective universe.\n\n28\n\nCREATOR: Nic Pizzolatto PRODUCTION CO: Anonymous Content, HBO Entertainment, Passenger\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN...

Battlestar Galactica was an unlikely hit. Loosely based on the 1978 series (see p402), the show found a mainstream audience that eluded the original. A 2003 mini series led to four seasons, each one of which peeled back another layer of history between the humans of the 12 Colonies – a far-flung civilization aeons from the original Earth – and their rebellious creations, the Cylons. As the series begins, the 12 Colonies have enjoyed four decades of relative peace. Following the first Cylon War when the machines rose up against their human masters, the Cylons abruptly vanished, leaving humans to speculate on the fate of their artificial creations. But they weren’t really gone – they were just being patient. A co-ordinated attack decimates the human population, and the few thousand survivors flee on whatever ships remain, including the soon-to-be decommissioned Galactica. There’s more bad news for humanity. The upgraded Cylons now look and act exactly like people, to the point where some of these sleeper agents aren’t even aware they’re Cylons and not humans. Over the next four seasons, the small group of survivors searches everywhere for a new home. As they’re being\n\nharried across the galaxy, these space refugees are looking for answers and safety, but they’re also establishing the rules for their new society. Battlestar Galactica is a show of its time. There are many not so subtle parallels with the fight against terrorism, which was just getting underway at the time. But many of the questions being asked then – about civil liberties, religious freedom, and free elections – remain unanswered today. From an entertainment standpoint, there’s never a dull moment in the series. The Cylons are absolutely ruthless and relentless in their genocidal mission, and every episode is a thrilling fight for survival. But is mere survival enough?\n\nCREATORS: Glen A. Larson, Ronald D.

Season 6 sees Kristofer Hivju – best known as Game of Thrones’ wildling leader Tormund Giantsbane – join as Beck’s partner Steinar Hovland.

Nearly 25 years after it first aired, it still thrills and horrifies just as much today.\n\nConan Doyle’s novels, Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) acts as a crime consultant, using his substantial powers of deduction to help police investigations. He’s aided by his flatmate Dr John Watson (Martin Freeman), who turns Holmes into a media celebrity by detailing their adventures on his blog.

The show takes some truly creative and imaginative turns, including a Christmas special that sends Holmes and Watson back in time. A compelling series that intrigues and amuses.\n\nhis dishonourable discharge from the Garda (the Irish police force), he has started a new career as a private investigator, looking into some crimes the police would rather ignore, including some rather gory deaths.

Finally, though, more than three decades after its publication, screenwriter Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers) finally cracked the Watchmen code with this TV version.\n\nThe original Watchmen comic-book series by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons has the distinct honour of being the only graphic novel included in Time magazine’s “All-Time 100 Novels”. It’s one of the very first books to make the jump from the realm of comics – something traditionally thought of as kids’ fare – to a legitimate piece of literature taken seriously by critics. Despite its popular and critical success, the general consensus among fans – as well as series creator Alan Moore – was that Watchmen could never be properly translated to the screen. This opinion was only\n\n“ People who wear masks are driven by trauma. They’re obsessed with justice…” Laurie Blake (S1 E4)\n\nIn Lindelof ’s remix/sequel/prequel, it has been 34 years since the events in the book, and much has transpired since the artificial, Lovecraftian catastrophe manufactured by super-genius Adrian Veidt (aka Ozymandias). For one, Robert Redford is the President of the United States. As commander-in-chief, the actor, meme, and founder of the Sundance Film Festival, has introduced “Redfordations”, which offer restitution for victims of racial violence throughout American history. Not everyone is pleased with President Redford’s actions. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, an uneasy peace is about to be shattered. After some bloody encounters with white supremacist group Seventh Kavalry – who all, it should be noted, wear Rorschach masks like the character from the book – local law enforcement decides it would be safer for all involved if police cover their faces to protect their identities. In one particularly\n\n32\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN... YOU WANT TO GET YOUR PULSE RACING\n\nviolent instance, later dubbed the “White Night”, Seventh Kavalry members launch a coordinated attack against police officers and their families in their homes. Those police who survive – including Angela Abar (Regina King) – are forced to take additional steps to protect their identities and stay safe. Part of what makes Lindelof ’s version so refreshing is that instead of trying to animate the graphic novel as a beat-by-beat clone with contemporary actors, it breaks Watchmen down into its component parts and uses them to create something entirely new, yet faithful to the original. Characters from the original graphic novel, such as Laurie Blake ( Jean Smart) are there, but with significant changes. Still, it’s hard to categorize, even for Lindelof, who told Rolling Stone: “Here’s another instance where I want to punch myself in the face: I called this thing a remix, because it doesn’t feel like a sequel to me. But it does by\n\nthe traditional rules of a sequel, in that this chronologically follows the original. But it’s also kind of a prequel, because this story starts in 1921, which predates any of the events of the comic.” It’s difficult to say more about the plot without divulging too much, but suffice to say these nine episodes of Watchmen have something for everyone, new and old fans alike. And while some were disappointed to hear that there are no current plans to make another season, there is something to be said for leaving when you’re at the top of your game. Watchmen is an entirely original story for our own era, one that also pays homage to the source material. Like the original comic series, it is a dark, dystopian masterpiece.\n\nOTHER SUPER HEROES BASED IN NEW YORK CITY\n\nAlso based in NEW YORK\n\nLUKE CAGE Harlem\n\nPOWER GIRL\n\nNEW JERSEY\n\nCATWOMAN JUSTICE LEAGUE INTERNATIONAL AVENGERS Avengers Mansion\n\nJESSICA JONES Hell’s Kitchen\n\nIRON MAN Stark Tower\n\nDAREDEVIL Hell’s Kitchen MANHATTAN\n\nIRON FIST Chikara Dojo, Chinatown\n\nVIGILANTE\n\nCENTRAL PARK\n\nPUNISHER Hell’s Kitchen\n\nDOCTOR STRANGE Sanctum Sanctorum\n\nBRONX\n\nTHE FANTASTIC FOUR Baxter Building TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES Manhattan Sewers\n\nQUEENS\n\nSPIDER-MAN Forest Hills, Queens\n\nBROOKLYN\n\nCREATOR: Damon Lindelof PRODUCTION CO: DC Comics, HBO, Paramount Television, Storm Studios, Warner Bros.Television, White Rabbit\n\n33\n\nCRIMINAL MINDS CRIME • 2005 RATED: 15 • 42 MINS As one of the most successful and longest-running network crime shows ever, Criminal Minds has spawned spin-offs, video games, and copycats.

In the classic 1981 comic-book arc “Days of Future Past”, the X-Men have been nearly hunted to extinction in a dystopian future. While things are not quite that bleak in The Gifted, we’re still led to understand that both\n\nWHITECHAPEL\n\nEdge of Darkness is a product of its time, but holds up wonderfully today. (A 2010 movie remake starring Mel Gibson fell flat.) The themes still ring true for those of us worried about environmental degradation and nuclear fallout today. But as a drama alone, this single-season series is a thrilling piece of work that anyone – including those born after the fall of the Berlin Wall – should enjoy.\n\nthe X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants have disappeared in its alternative Marvel Universe. Reed Strucker (Stephen Moyer) makes his living as a district attorney who prosecutes mutants and puts them in camps. But everything changes when Strucker discovers that his own kids have latent mutant abilities. To protect them, he takes his family on the run. Although The Gifted’s two seasons lack the star power we expect from the X-Men movies, the series is a solidly entertaining twist on the Super Hero franchise.\n\nA team of detectives in London’s Whitechapel district track down copycat killers looking to piggyback on the dubious notoriety of history’s most famous murderers.\n\nIn 2008, DI Joseph Chandler (Rupert PenryJones) must grapple with a series of grisly Jack the Ripper copycat murders when he’s posted to Whitechapel to investigate the death of a woman. He works with hard-bitten, streetsmart, cynical DS Ray Miles (Philip Davis), who is nearing retirement, and eccentric but knowledgeable (and slightly creepy) Ripper expert, Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton).\n\nCopycat serial killers have to be at the absolute bottom of the mass murderer hierarchy. Not only are they contemptible monsters, but they’re unoriginal to boot.\n\nDespite some familiar story lines, this four-season series is intense, atmospheric, and undeniably gripping, providing unexpected twists and turns aplenty.\n\nCRIME • 2009 RATED: 15 • 45 MINS\n\n40\n\nWhat he originally suspects is a botched attempt on his life quickly reveals itself to be a deeper conspiracy, with implications for nothing less than the fate of the planet.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN... YOU WANT TO GET YOUR PULSE RACING\n\nARNE DAHL\n\nArne Dahl may sound like the name of a leathery detective with a foul mouth and a gambling addiction, but the truth is he’s not even a character in this show.\n\ncall in the big guns: the so-called “A-group”, which is sort of like the A-Team but Swedish and without Mr T. What it does have, though, is Paul Hjelm (Shanti Roney), Jorge Chavez (Matias Varela), Viggo Norlander (Claes Ljungmark), and the rest, all bringing different skills to bear in trying to stop the next assassination attempt.\n\nFirst things first: The name Arne Dahl refers to the pen name of the writer behind these jaunty crime shows, and not any character contained therein. When three Swedish business guys are murdered, the authorities\n\nYou don’t have to be a fan of the books to enjoy the two seasons of Arne Dahl mysteries. Anyone who appreciates interesting group dynamics, gruesome murders, and cut-throat Baltic gangs will find something to love here.\n\nCRIME • 2011 RATED: 15 • 90 MINS\n\nHAP AND LEONARD DRAMA • 2016 RATED: 15 • 60 MINS The success of buddy TV shows can hinge on the chemistry between the two buddies. Do we believe they’re actually friends, or just playing friends? These two seem like the real deal. Hap Collins ( James Purefoy) and Leonard Pine (Michael K. Williams) are an unlikely pair. Hap is a slightly sad ex-con, and Leonard is a gay Vietnam vet. They’re floating around late\n\nRUN\n\n1980s-era east Texas when they run into Hap’s ex, Trudy Fawst (Christina Hendricks). She has a proposition for the two of them. If they can help her locate a car with the proceeds of a robbery in its trunk, Hap and Leonard will each pocket a cool $100,000. Nothing is that easy, though. Hap and Leonard exists on its own frequency, in the best way. Every shot looks borderline supernatural, and Willams and Purefoy play off each other beautifully. The three-season show also has interesting things to say on race, sexuality, and friendship.\n\nWhen Ruby receives a mysterious text message from an old flame, she embarks on a cross-country adventure 17 years in the making.\n\n(Domhnall Gleeson), made a pact. If one of them ever texted this word to the other, and got an identical response, they would both drop everything and meet at New York’s Grand Central Terminal for a cross-country adventure. Ruby, perhaps stuck in a rut, texts him back and abandons her husband and son for the promise of rekindling an old romance.\n\nRuby Richardson (Merritt Wever) leads a pretty normal life. Then, one day, she receives a text message out of the blue with just one word: “RUN”. Nearly two decades earlier, Ruby and her then boyfriend, Billy Johnson\n\nThis one-season show serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of excessive nostalgia. Billy and Ruby each have their own reasons for wanting to run, but they soon learn that you can’t escape your problems that easily.\n\nTHRILLER • 2020 RATED: 18 • 30 MINS\n\n41\n\nMAFIOSA CRIME • 2006 RATED:TV-MA (US) • 50 MINS We would all agree that more women should be in positions of power in the worlds of government and business. But what about in TV shows about organized crime? Yep, those too. When it comes to organized crime, we’re not generally talking about a particularly diverse workforce or leadership. Both are predominantly male and, on TV at least,\n\nPENNYWORTH CRIME • 2019 RATED: 15 • 60 MINS Everyone loves Bruce Wayne’s butler, Alfred. He’s old, with impeccable manners, and is always there to pick “Master Bruce” up when he’s down. But where, exactly, did he come from? Robin is Batman’s best-known sidekick, but the truth is that Batman’s most-trusted confidant has always been his manservant, the distinguished Alfred Pennyworth. But was\n\nBEING HUMAN FANTASY • 2008 RATED: 15 • 60 MINS A trio of flatmates who happen to be a vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost, try to make it in the human world. George Sands (Russell Tovey) and John Mitchell (Aidan Turner) are just like any other people in their mid-20s trying to work it all out. But rather than worry about buying a home, marriage, or getting a promotion,\n\n42\n\nwomen are relegated to second-class status. In Mafiosa, that dynamic shifts spectacularly when a Corsican mafia boss is murdered, and leaves leadership of the clan to his niece, a lawyer named Sandra Paoli (Hélène Fillières). Sandra doesn’t have much experience in the mafia business, but her uncle saw something in her. She soon learns she has a talent for her new role and over this five-season French series we watch her slowly embrace her new life as a crime boss, confounding those around her who have no idea how to deal with this powerful woman.\n\nAlfred born a bespectacled butler? Surely he had a life before becoming a surrogate father to Bruce Wayne? In this single-season series, we follow a young Alfred ( Jack Bannon), and at last learn how he came to work for the Wayne family. Some people may claim we didn’t need to see an origin story about Alfred in swinging ’60s London, but there’s a stronger argument to be made that we really did. It’s well past time for Alfred (Alfie, to his friends) to shine and get out from under Master Bruce’s long, pointyearred shadow.\n\nthese two friends have to worry about, um, feasting on the living. Sands is a werewolf, it turns out, and Mitchell is a vampire. Both are trying to go straight, though, and when they move into a new flat, they make a new friend, Annie Sawyer (Lenora Crichlow), a ghost who’s haunting their new premises. Whether vampire, human, or cocker spaniel, most of us just want to be loved and accepted. Running five seasons, Being Human is a funny, occasionally touching reminder that we all have some agency in our lives and that no one has to be someone they don’t want to be.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH WHEN... YOU WANT TO GET YOUR PULSE RACING\n\nNUMB3RS CRIME • 2005 RATED: 15 • 43 MINS In the movie Point Break, FBI agent Johnny Utah’s boss tells him they solve crimes by crunching numbers and data, not by surfing. Numb3rs suggests he’s right. TV makes police work seem far more exciting than it is. In real life, catching the bad guys has more to do with sifting through mountains of data than it does thrilling rooftop chases.\n\nJUSTIFIED ACTION • 2010 RATED: 15 • 44 MINS What would it look like if Wyatt Earp was alive and plying his trade in the present day? Probably something like this contemporary TV western. Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) is a man out of time. He’s basically what would happen if you took Olyphant’s character from Deadwood (see p119), stuck him in a time machine, and sent him forward a century.\n\nTINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY SPY DRAMA • 1979 RATED: 15 • 50 MINS One of the greatest Cold War stories ever told, author John le Carré’s spy tale has stood the test of time, even as the conflict itself became history. Like any great spy story, it can be a little hard to follow exactly what’s going on at times in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. We’re pretty sure\n\nThis six-season series gives us both. For FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), solving crimes is a family affair. He teams up with his brother, Charlie (David Krumholtz) and – occasionally – their father Alan ( Judd Hirsch) to bring in America’s most wanted, using both brains and brawn. Many people wouldn’t want to work so closely with a sibling, but these guys make it work. Over six seasons, it is intriguing to see how Charlie and his mathematics – he likes scribbling down complex equations that are clearly complete nonsense – help solve each crime.\n\nAs a lawman, Givens is more the judge, jury, and executioner type who doesn’t have much use for due process. It’s a headache for his superiors, so Givens gets busted and sent back to his Kentucky hometown, where this six-season series takes place. He’s joined by Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins), a criminal who discovers religion in jail. Together, Givens – a man who relies on his quick draw and quicker temper – and Crowder, more cunning and probably more dangerous, make Justified perfect for anyone looking to dig into a modern-day western.\n\nGeorge Smiley (Alec Guinness) is a good guy, but in the topsy-turvy world of Cold War espionage, who is even sure what that means? After being ousted from his position as deputy head of the British Secret Intelligence Service (“The Circus”) Smiley is pulled into a web of intrigue and feints, with double and perhaps even triple agents! It’s wild stuff. Whether you’re a le Carré fan or not, you have to appreciate the care and seriousness with which Guinness treats th"
