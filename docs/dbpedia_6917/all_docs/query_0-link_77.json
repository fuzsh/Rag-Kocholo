Among them I would like to especially thank Eithne Quinn, Paul Grainge, Julian Stringer, Mark Jancovich and Judie Newman. I am indebted to the University of Nottingham for funding much of my research and also Middlesex University for being supportive while completing the manuscript. I am also very grateful to my Media Department colleagues, particularly Paul Kerr, Deborah Klika, Tom McGorrian and Paul Cobley, who have always been perfectly happy to talk about ancient corpses over sandwiches. The anonymous peer reviewers of this manuscript who gave their time and graciously offered advice and encouragement I thank too, for they remind me that even at a time when research and ideas are not always prioritized in many higher education institutions, countless scholars who review manuscripts for books and journals nevertheless steadfastly value them, even when they know they will remain nameless. I also want to express my gratitude to Madeleine Hamey-Thomas and Rebecca Barden for their help as editors and for their support throughout the period of writing this book, particularly in 2017 when I had to take a break from it after both my mother Kathleen and brother Vincent passed away and again in 2018 when my father, also called Vincent, had a stroke that left him with lasting brain injury. Sadly, none of them will ever get to read this book, which is now unreservedly dedicated to them. I would also like to acknowledge the input of my brother Stephen, a fellow film fanatic, for his advice and for lending me a book or two, although inexplicably in spite of our conversations he still prefers pop music films to horror films. Clearly my brother Vincent, who lived for music, was a greater influence upon him than I. Last, but by no means least, I would like to thank my wife Jeongmee (another wonderful scholar whose help with this book has been immeasurable) and my children, Austin and Mia, for sticking with me every step of the way despite my disquieting preoccupations with the Hill of the Seven Jackals, the Valley of the Kings, New England swamps and the bandaged residents of these parts. I’m pretty sure they’re sick to death of Mummy movies (although they’ve never actually confessed it), but they have nevertheless unwaveringly supported and encouraged and, yes, sometimes made fun of me, helping me to get through everything and finally finish the book. It exists through their efforts as much as mine. And, of course, I cannot forget Imhotep, Kharis, Tera and the rest.\n\nAuthor’s notes The director is provided in brackets for all films and programmes mentioned, followed by the country and year of release (d.u. is used when the director is unknown). In following this convention, I recognize it is far from ideal in regard to television in which the writers, producers or showrunners have often been in greater control of single episodes or series and that many different directors often contribute to different episodes. Occasionally, I have given a director as unknown when a director is provided on the IMDB. I have done this when I have been unable to corroborate this information from any other sources to which I have had access. This is not to say that IMDB is wrong in these instances, just that I have been unable to prove it is right. For all films before 1930 I have additionally included information regarding who produced the films in parenthesis because many of the production companies mentioned no longer exist; their inclusion helps to better clarify the rapidity of Mummy film production across companies and countries in cinema’s early years and helps distinguish between films which often had the same or similar title (there being two films called The Mummy in 1911, for example). I have been far more ‘encyclopaedic’ in terms of the number of films discussed in Chapter 4 because the silent Mummy film has hitherto been something of a lost era of film production. Although, I have no doubt, much still waits to be uncovered, I have attempted to reconstruct the silent age of the Mummy as comprehensively as possible through searching a range of journals from the silent era. Sometimes the plot descriptions cited may appear a little ‘old-fashioned’ because they are taken from written materials often over 100 years old. Original language film titles are provided where possible. If a foreign language film has been released under an English title or its title has an existent English translation I have included it; otherwise I have provided only the original title. On a couple of occasions I have only been able to find an English language title rather than the original title. I have capitalized the Mummy throughout, primarily to distinguish it as a character in literature and film, like the Monster from Frankenstein, and to differentiate it from its inanimate equivalent found in museums.\n\nIntroduction: Death is only the beginning – Unravelling the Mummy on Screen The Mummy has stalked, sauntered, lurched and limped its way through the movies, largely unappreciated by critics, academics and cultural commentators, for well over a century. Numerous overviews of the history of the horror film have accused the Mummy of crushing the life out of the vibrant horror genre as readily as the monster does its own victims. Jonathan Lake Crane describes the Mummy as horror’s ‘least charismatic monster’ (1994: 73) and Jeremy Dyson dismisses Mummy films as ‘dross’ (1997: 125). David Parkinson suggests that Mummy films form ‘arguably, horror cinema’s least successful sub-genre’ (2000: 18), a view echoed by Kim Newman who calls it the ‘least rewarding’ (1986: 294) and ‘most despised of all sub-genres’ (1988: 31). Nor do such assessments belong to just the modern era of film criticism. As early as 1944, by which time the Mummy had already managed to notch up over fifty screen appearances, the New York World Telegram proclaimed on the release of The Mummy’s Ghost (Reginald LeBorg, USA) that ‘the Mummy always has been the least impressive of movie monsters’ (cited in Weaver 1999: 166). Upon the release of the second Mummy film of that year, The Mummy’s Curse, John McManus of New York’s PM felt its very existence was tantamount to being a wartime scandal. Because the big studios have first priority on available films, he complained, ‘there is a shortage of film available for independents, educational films, etc. This is how one big studio expends its film ration’ (cited in Mank 1999b: 332). It was a film, in other words, not good enough to justify the film stock used to make it, a seventy-year-old assessment that stands till today as a pretty fair reflection of the critical status of the Mummy movie and its ‘whole rotting bandages sub-genre’ (McKay 2007: 242). Yet such overwhelmingly negative appraisals are difficult to tally with the fact that the Mummy has remained a constant box-office draw since the very earliest years of cinema, featuring in major blockbusters, one-off hits and highly profitable film series. In the 1940s, for instance, out of all of Universal Studios’ monsters, it was only the Mummy that carried its own series, in contrast to Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster and the Wolf Man who were all pitted against each other in multiple monster horror pot-boilers such as Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (Roy William Neill, USA, 1943) and House of Dracula (Erle C. Kenton, USA, 1945).1 Kim R. Holston and Tom Winchester’s indifferent appraisal of Universal’s 1940s Mummy series as one which ‘never garnered much\n\ncritical acclaim, although it did well enough at the box office’ (1997: 342) begs an obvious question: Why have critics and academics found the Mummy so forgettable as a monster while the cinema-going public have found it so appealing? The Mummy ‘in terms of movie fame’, as Gene Wright points out, ‘ranks with the Frankenstein Monster, Dracula and the Wolf Man’ (1987: 202), yet, despite this, for so many critics, the Mummy is an unfortunate monstrous misstep in the history of horror movies. R. H. W. Dillard offers one such critical appraisal as to why the Mummy fails: He is inflexibly the same, film after film, because he has but one story and that a simple one. All of the myths of the horror films are very limited, perhaps because they are myths, but the Mummy’s identity is so restricting that the limitations are as binding as the decayed wrappings of his brittle flesh itself. (1967: 76)\n\nThis is a common critical conception of the Mummy, conceived as a static, unchanging, bandaged, ‘mindless, foot-dragging corpse’ (Pulliam 2015: 195) that features in repetitive, formulaic films. However, rather than being emblematic of binding limitations, the diversity of Mummies, Mummy films and Mummy narratives that have featured in the cinema demonstrate the precise opposite: the Mummy has offered a miscellany of monstrous possibilities. There have been a staggering variety of Mummies that have appeared on screen and, while they have mostly come from Egypt, many others have originated elsewhere, with Incan,2 Aztec,3 Roman,4 Celtic,5 Caribbean6 and Chinese7 Mummies all having risen from the dead to stalk the living at one time or another. As well as emerging from a variety of different countries, Mummies have featured in films from countries all around the world including Brazil,8 Denmark,9 Egypt,10 France,11 Germany,12 Hungary,13 Italy,14 Japan,15 Mexico,16 Spain,17 and Sweden.18 There have been girl Mummies,19 boy Mummies,20 teen Mummies,21 octogenarian Mummies,22 puppet Mummies,23 robot Mummies,24 atomic Mummies,25 teleporting Mummies,26 transforming Mummies,27 giant Mummies,28 miniature Mummies,29 dog Mummies,30 hamster Mummies,31 monkey Mummies,32 karate Mummies,33 kung fu Mummies,34 extra-terrestrial Mummies,35 indestructible Mummies36 and cannibalistic Mummies.37 There have been Mummies with blacked-out eyes,38 Mummies with glowing eyes,39 Mummies with flashing eyes40 and Mummies with eyes that shoot laser beams.41 The Mummy of Elvis Presley appeared in one film,42 while Elvis battled a Mummy in another.43 In addition to pursuing vengeance, lost loves or terrified victims, Mummies have sung songs,44 taken manicures,45 babysat,46 burgled,47 played basketball,48 played Russian roulette,49 played with a yo-yo,50 gone motorcycling,51 fishing,52 ice skating,53 flying,54 sailing,55 nightclubbing,56 dived deep underwater57 and gone into deep space.58 As well as films, television shows59 and cartoons,60 they have appeared in books,61 comics,62 theatrical productions,63 video games,64 pop videos65 and also in song.66 The Mummy, as Donald F. Glut noted, is a figure that can be encountered almost anywhere: [It has] leered at us from rings, bubble bath dispensers, glo-heads, and Nestlés’ ‘Spook Group’ flavours … bendable figures, swizzle sticks, spoons and horrorscope viewers … glow pictures, toy figures, iron-ons, stick-on stamps,\n\n2 The Mummy on Screen\n\nbuttons, photo printsets, paint-by-number sets, candy, wallets, pencil sharpeners and wall plaques … model kits, masks, calendars, greeting cards, trading cards, posters and play money. (1978: 412)\n\nIn spite of the fact that the Mummy is a figure liable to pop up anywhere in popular culture and has featured in literally hundreds of films to date and been reimagined by visionary and highly regarded directors such as Georges Méliès, Ernst Lubitsch, Karl Freund, Terence Fisher and Mike Newell, it remains a figure disliked and neglected, even today when so many horror genres and figures have been reappraised. Such oversight was explicable for a long time given that the whole genre of cinematic horror was long considered, as Robin Wood asserts, ‘the most disreputable of Hollywood genres’ (1984: 173). It was not until 1967 that the first significant English language works on the horror film appeared with the publication of two groundbreaking books: Ivan Butler’s The Horror Film and Carlos Clarens’s An Illustrated History of the Horror Film. Despite arriving late on the scene as a subject of cinematic study, however, lost time has been made up with horror today being one of the most popular cinema subjects for critical analysis, so much so that ‘even the slasher film can attract something close to a “progressive” reading’ (Gelder 2000: 311). Critical reappraisal has taken place for a great many monsters and horror narratives, with numerous academic studies conducted on the vampire, Frankenstein’s Monster, werewolf, zombie, serial killer and alien invader. However, the Mummy has not been re-evaluated or critically rescued in the same manner, to the extent that it is even specifically de-selected for critical study on occasion. In the 2014 collection Screening the Undead, for instance, the Mummy is emphatically excluded because it ‘doesn’t seem to have sustained either popular or critical attention’, being ‘confined to mostly repetitive studio cycles’ (Hunt et al. 2014: 2). Because of the repeated assumption that the Mummy is a repetitious monster, it is unsurprising that the Mummy has tended to feature less than other monsters in discussions of horror. In David J. Skal’s wide-ranging The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror, for instance, the Mummy barely features, with only the plot of The Mummy (Karl Freund, USA, 1932) noted in one paragraph. Similarly, the Mummy warrants only a paragraph in Clarens’s An Illustrated History of the Horror Film (1967: 73) whereas in Ivan Butler’s The Horror Film it fails to get even that. The majority of film or horror-focused books and articles that offer detailed analysis of the Mummy in the cinema have tended not to focus on the Mummy film per se. For example, the Mummy has featured in discussions of the works of specific directors such as Karl Freund,67 Reginald LeBorg68 and Terence Fisher69 to illustrate tendencies in the oeuvres of these directors, or in relation to the screen careers of stars who have appeared in Mummy films.70 The Mummy has also been discussed in books on particular studios such as Universal71 and Hammer,72 British horror cinema73 and particular eras of horror production.74 Pieces devoted to the cinematic Mummy itself have primarily appeared in works dedicated to monsters in fan magazines like Famous Monsters of Filmland and Castle of Frankenstein,75 books and articles about film monsters,76 reprinted film scripts,77 books examining lost scenes,78 classic horror\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nmake-up79 and encyclopaedias on monsters and horror films.80 The existence of so many fan-focused studies demonstrates the obvious fascination the Mummy holds for horror aficionados, if not for critics.81 Outside of film and horror studies, far greater interest has been taken in the Mummy as an influential presence in broader popular culture, featuring in works exploring its contributions to areas such as literature, Egyptology, religion, music, art and museums.82 Within film studies, though, it remains the critical poor relation of horror’s mainstays, downgraded as derivative both as a concept and subgenre. Such a reputation for derivativeness is perhaps partly due to the tendency for major Mummy movies to follow hot on the heels of financially popular screen versions of Dracula and Frankenstein. Universal’s The Mummy (1932) came after Dracula (Tod Browning, USA, 1931) and Frankenstein (James Whale, USA, 1931), Hammer’s The Mummy (Terence Fisher, UK, 1959) after The Curse of Frankenstein (Terence Fisher, UK, 1957) and Dracula (Terence Fisher, UK, 1958) and Universal’s The Mummy (Stephen Sommers, USA, 1999) after Bram Stoker’s Dracula (Francis Ford Coppola, USA, 1992) and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh, UK/USA, 1994). Seemingly little more than a follow-up in Universal and Hammer’s efforts to build on the success of previous hits, this pattern of arriving in third place after versions of Dracula and Frankenstein within different horror cycles has probably contributed to establishing the Mummy’s ‘third-rate’ status as a monster. The Mummy’s standing among critics has also not been helped by the fact that ‘horror’ directors have seldom been associated with Mummy films. Unlike celebrated directors such as James Whale with Frankenstein and Tod Browning with Dracula, it was Karl Freund, a figure better known for his cinematography than his direction, who gave us The Mummy in 1932. Further, it was a string of ‘B’ movie directors who brought us the Mummy in the 1940s. Christy Cabanne, Harold Young, Reginald LeBorg and Leslie Goodwins are not names that instantly spring to mind and none has any real connection with the horror genre or any cult status today – rather than being auteurs they are today remembered as ‘second-rate craftsmen’ (Clarens 1967: 101), when they are remembered at all. At Hammer Film Productions the trend was briefly broken when Terence Fisher directed The Mummy in 1959 (although he was still very early in his career as a horror specialist director when he made this film, and did not direct any of Hammer’s subsequent Mummy films). The 1980s and 1990s again saw Mummy movies directed by non-horror directors like Mike Newell (The Awakening, UK, 1980), Russell Mulcahy (Tale of the Mummy a.k.a. Talos the Mummy, UK/USA, 1998) and Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, 1999), respectively best known beforehand for The Man in the Iron Mask (UK/USA, 1977), Highlander (UK/USA, 1986) and The Jungle Book (USA, 1994). In 2017 The Mummy (USA) was directed by Alex Kurtzman, best known previously as a producer of Star Trek (J. J. Abrams, USA, 2009), and the failure of this film has been largely attributed to him, as well as the part played by Tom Cruise in making major changes to the film (Setoodeh and Lang 2017). Tom Cruise is a star not especially renowned for horror films and neither is his co-star, Sofia Boutella, who played the Mummy itself. The Mummy’s reputation has\n\n4 The Mummy on Screen\n\nlong suffered from a lack of association with horror stars because, in contrast to many other major movie monsters, no actor or actress has become truly synonymous with the figure. Iconic horror monsters, from supernatural ones to serial killers, are frequently indebted to the stars that play them, such as Robert Englund as Freddy Kruger from the Nightmare on Elm Street series, Doug Bradley as Pinhead from the Hellraiser films or John Kramer as the Jigsaw Killer from the Saw series. While some big name horror stars have played the Mummy, including Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr. and Christopher Lee, they all became definitively associated with different monsters. Boris Karloff will forever be remembered as Frankenstein’s Monster, Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man while Christopher Lee, like Bela Lugosi before him, became an archetypal Dracula. Boris Karloff repeated his role as Frankenstein’s Monster, as did Lee with Dracula, but neither repeated their roles as the Mummy, further encouraging identification with their other portrayals. Nor did Tom Tyler, the first actor to portray Kharis the Mummy in Universal’s 1940s paradigm-shifting reimagining of the Mummy in The Mummy’s Hand (Christy Cabanne, USA, 1940), reappear in the role. He went on instead to repeat performances as Captain Marvel in the twelve-part Republic Pictures serial Adventures of Captain Marvel (John English, William Witney, USA, 1941). It was only Lon Chaney Jr., from all of these stars, who played the Mummy more than once. However, unlike his career-defining turn as Lawrence Talbot/the Wolf Man, which he made his own, two actors before him had already established the Mummy at Universal. Unlike his Wolf Man role, Chaney Jr. had little regard for the Mummy, maintaining that movie audiences who spent their money to see Mummy films were ‘nuts’ (cited in Mank 1999b: 326). Aside from directors and stars, another means through which the reputation of a monster is often established is through the ‘definitive’ film that launched it, which creates for all time an indelible image. For Dracula, Tod Browning’s 1931 film introduced to cinema audiences the Lugosi persona replete with cape, vampiric stare and Eastern European accent that became iconic, while for Frankenstein James Whale’s 1931 version established Karloff’s flat-headed and bolt-necked Monster as an interpretation popularly remembered to this day. Karl Freund’s 1932 version of The Mummy is often singled out as the moment when the image of the Mummy was defined for the public. William K. Everson, for instance, identifies this as the Mummy movie’s key film and that the ‘the mythology of the revitalized Mummy must be credited solely to Universal Pictures’ enterprise in striving to find a successful Karloffian follow-up to Frankenstein’ (1974: 89). The Mummy’s critical credentials are impeccable for viewing it as the cinematic urtext. It was made during a golden age period when the producer Carl Laemmle Jr. had decided to make films ‘of the highest excellence that the resources of Universal City could achieve’ (cited in Pendo 1975: 155). It had an iconic star in Karloff and a director in Karl Freund renowned for prior artistic triumphs as cinematographer on some of the most important films of his generation, including Der Golem, Wie Er in die Welt Kam (The Golem, How He Came into the World, Germany, PAGU, 1920), Der Letzte Mann (The Last Laugh, The Last Man, F. W. Murnau, Germany, UFA, 1924),\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nVariety (Ewald André Dupont, Germany, UFA, 1925) and Metropolis (Fritz Lang, Germany, UFA, 1927). Many have acknowledged it as the seminal ‘quintessential mummy film’ (Lupton 2015: 286), with Everson singling it out as a creative tour de force, claiming that ‘the most impressive of all the monster films is The Mummy, directed by Karl Freund in 1932’ (1954: 14). Dennis Fischer is another critic who greatly admires its artistry, its ‘subtlety and suggestiveness’ and its rather ‘strange and eerie kind of poetry’, believing it to be ‘one of the most poetic horror films ever made’ (1991: 431). Gerald C. Wood suggests that The Mummy has remained critically favoured primarily because of such attractive features: ‘Its look was artily European’ and suggestive of ‘ennobling sources’ such as German Expressionism (1988: 212). However, while the film has retained a strong reputation for quality, the Mummy that featured in it has faded in the public consciousness in comparison to later versions of the Mummy. While subtlety and artistry in horror create memorable films, it would appear that it is plenty of screen-time for a strikingly impressive monster that creates a horror archetype. Like The Mummy, White Zombie (Victor Halperin, USA, 1932) has today an impressive reputation for its atmosphere and aesthetics, but few remember the zombies that featured in the film as they had little impact on the zombie subgenre. It would be, as Louise Fenton has argued, the far more visible but less critically regarded ‘zombie of the 1940s that placed the living dead in the imagination of mass audiences’ (2014: 225). As Mark Jancovich points out, a critical focus on important, defining films is often the case when film histories are compiled, but this can prove to be very distorting because ‘the very features that have resulted in their classic status might not make them representative at all’ (2002: 9). In the case of The Mummy, the film is valued precisely because of its uniqueness and artistry, rather than the degree of its indebtedness to or influence on the horror genre or Mummy film. Karloff’s subtle interpretation of the role as a berobed, fragile fez-wearing sorcerer is not the Mummy popularly remembered. Instead, as Brian Senn and John Johnson point out: When one thinks of the Mummy an image comes to mind of a bandaged monster sent out to do the evil bidding of a sinister high priest. The creature’s face is wrinkled and blank as it slowly and inexorably limps toward the intended victim, its single good arm outstretched to strangle the life out of anyone who stands in its way. (1992: 412)\n\nThis mute, monstrous, bandaged Mummy emerged from the 1940s Mummy cycle that consisted of four films made between 1940 and 1942 and not from the 1930s original. The Mummy that has implanted itself into the public consciousness belongs not to Karloff but to Tom Tyler and Lon Chaney Jr. Crucially, this has led to a major drawback for the Mummy as a horror archetype because the iconic creature that everybody knows is tied not to the ‘classic’ critical darling of the Mummy film, but instead to a critically derided series of films. Timothy Sullivan suggests that The Mummy’s Hand (1940), the movie that launched the bandaged marauding Mummy, was ‘a film that had nothing to do with Freund’s masterpiece’ (1986: 164), and this position characterizes one of the main\n\n6 The Mummy on Screen\n\nproblems for the Mummy. The monstrous Mummy that has become iconic is seen by many as an inferior concept to what came before. Roger Luckhurst, for instance, defines him as ‘a shuffling dullard’ (2012: 17), David Huckvale ‘a characterless corpse’ (2012: 212) and James Marriott and Kim Newman a ‘limping, pot-bellied, not-terribly-fearsome bandaged bully’ (2010: 55). David Flint consigns him to being ‘little more than an Egyptian zombie’ (2009: 41) and Jonathan Rigby ‘a cut-priced bandaged’ one at that (2017: 197). Peter Hutchings is less scathing in his estimation of the 1940s Mummy but still suggests that ‘there is something vaguely disappointing about this version of the Mummy, as if he has not quite delivered the critical goods in the manner of those other Universal monsters which have lent themselves so well to particular forms of interpretation and analysis’ (2002). The 1940s Mummy was reinvented as part of Universal’s general strategy in that decade of revamping all of their monsters, most of which have been critically regarded as inferior to their 1930s originals. Universal horror films of the 1940s such as Son of Dracula (Robert Siodmak, USA, 1943) and Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943) have long been perceived as the products of a studio cranking out uncreative moneymakers designed primarily to keep the studio afloat,83 ‘reducing the gothic-romantic genre of the 1930s to an assembly line for childish shudder pulps’ (Newman 2002: 101). As well as being inferior to previous horror output, Universal’s horror movies of the 1940s are also unfavourably compared to Val Lewton’s contemporaneous RKOproduced low-budget films such as Cat People (Jacques Tourneur, USA, 1942) and I Walked With a Zombie (Jacques Tourneur, USA, 1943). Whereas RKO’s horror films traded in psychological complexity and are critically considered as ‘literate, adult and sophisticated’ (Marriott and Newman 2010: 54), by comparison the 1940s Mummy film has been critically consigned to being little more than an ‘enjoyable lark’ (Brunas 1983: 19), cheap and cheerful with ‘an arthritic camp charm’ (Holston and Winchester 1997: 342) designed primarily to satisfy saucer-eyed children sitting in the front row of the cinema who were mainly ‘drawn to the double-billed feature’ (Legassic 2014: 310). For instance, Alan G. Barbour, in an affectionate reminiscence, describes his feelings: I could take most of the creatures they threw at me on the screen. The Frankenstein Monster, Dracula, the Wolf Man, the Creeper and all the others entertained but hardly frightened me. But when Tom Tyler (as the Mummy in The Mummy’s Hand) or Lon Chaney, Jr. (as the Mummy in the three remaining films in the series) came at me on the screen with gnarled hand outstretched and the pulse-quickening music of Hans Salter gathering momentum on the soundtrack, that was just too much. (1971: 45)84\n\nWhen not eulogized for starring in a remarkably artistic and idiosyncratic one-off in the 1930s (a dead end for discussing the development of the figure), the Mummy is considered the product of a generic assembly line in the 1940s that churned out an ‘abyss of juvenile horror/comedy’ (Lupton 2003: 38) suitable only for minors (another dead end).\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nFurther damaging to the Mummy’s standing is the fact that it is not comprehended as deriving from folklore like other monsters such as the vampire or werewolf, who have developed all manner of associated legends and traditions, and so is a creature that has not attained the status of myth. While some critics have assumed that ‘the idea of walking Mummies’ was ‘a pure Hollywood fabrication’ (Fischer 1991: 429), they are mistaken because even to the ancient Egyptians the Mummy was a body never fully dead. For centuries ever since there have been all manner of superstitious and pseudoscientific beliefs attributed to Mummies that have contributed to the genesis of the Mummy from a human into a monster, a number of which will be discussed in Chapter 1. Nor is the cinematic Mummy’s literary ancestry acknowledged in the way that it is for other monsters, in spite of the fact that long before the advent of film there existed numerous significant literary works that featured living Mummies. Les Daniels, for instance, incorrectly assumes no literary tradition behind the Mummy when he asserts that The Mummy (1932) ‘had no direct literary source but was concocted out of nothing in particular’ (1977: 144). Such an assumption is understandable, however, because there is no definitive single origin text. Kim Newman identifies this lack of association with a literary classic or unique literary source as the Mummy’s major drawback: ‘There’s no foundation Mummy text of the caliber and completeness of Frankenstein, Dracula or Jekyll and Hyde … [and] … because there is no source novel the Mummy movie has always been the poor relation of other great horror stories’ (1996: 225). Despite the fact that many celebrated authors including Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker and Arthur Conan Doyle composed Mummy tales, none of these has been identified as source texts against which to grade the genre – to say whether films are good or bad adaptations – a situation not alleviated by the fact that it was not until Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb (Seth Holt, Michael Carreras, UK) in 1971 that classical literary inspiration was directly acknowledged in a Mummy film’s credits. The bandaged Mummy, as a result of not being considered ‘classic’ in either a literary or cinematic sense, fails to meet a prime critical criterion for the interrogation of a monster: a cultural starting point. The lack of an accepted cinematic ‘generic prototype’, to adopt Thomas Schatz’s term (1981: 264), or source novel or even a folk history makes it difficult to determine where to begin with the Mummy. Perhaps as a result of its ambiguous origins the Mummy has often been placed in the shadow of other monsters that are considered more archetypal. James B. Twitchell (1985), for instance, identifies the three major carriers of horror as the vampire, the split-personality werewolf and the hulk with no name. Although obvious candidates for these categories would be, in turn, Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein’s Monster, Twitchell uses the terms loosely so that any creature that sucks the life out of a being can be considered a vampire, Dr. Jekyll transforms and would be a split-personality werewolf and the Creature from the Black Lagoon alongside the giant spiders, robots and blobs from American horror/sci-fi would qualify as hulks with no names. Such archetypes have proven a popular tool in horror studies and have led to much categorizing and classification. Stephen King (1993: 65–100) offers an identical grouping to Twitchell with his three tales of the tarot (but suggests the ghost could be added to the list)\n\n8 The Mummy on Screen\n\nand so does David J. Skal (1994: 19) (who in turn suggests the freak as an addition). Andrew Tudor (1989: 133–57) sees the mad scientist as a distinct figure in horror while Randy Loren Rasmussen (1998) identifies his six clearly defined character types as heroines, heroes, wise elders, mad scientists, servants and monsters. As this book will explore, the Mummy rather than being a static repetitious figure is in fact a far more nebulous figure than given credit for and can be seen to occupy various different positions within these distinct camps. Boris Karloff’s Ardath Bey in The Mummy is closest to the ‘vampire’ as an undead man and ersatz Dracula, but can also be read as a ‘ghost’ who will allow nobody to touch him and whose attacks are not physical but paranormal. So too can the lifeforce sucking ‘Queen of the Nile’ from The Twilight Zone (John Brahm, USA, 1964) and Imhotep from The Mummy (1999) be loosely considered as vampires. The brutish Mummy of the 1940s can be placed into the category of ‘hulk with no name’, as can Hammer’s 1959 interpretation. In Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb (1971) a modern woman gets ‘taken over’ by the spirit of a murderous ancient Egyptian queen and so proves suitable for the split-personality ‘werewolf’ archetype. In addition, the Mummy has not just jumped camps from film to film, but often combines archetypal attributes within single films. As Kim R. Holston and Tom Winchester point out in relation to the 1940s Mummy, ‘Kharis seemed to borrow in equal measure qualities of two other Universal monsters of the time: the great strength and shambling gait of the Frankenstein monster, and the penchant for operating under moonlight from the Wolf Man’ (1997: 342). Gilberto Martínez Solares’s Face of the Screaming Werewolf (Mexico/USA, 1964) overtly combined archetypes with its Mummy who transforms into a werewolf during the full moon. The critical practice of classification and the Mummy’s resistance to being categorically placed into distinct categories, while simultaneously fitting into many of them, suggests that the archetypal status of some monsters has more to do with the construction of particular archetypes than any essence of distinctiveness belonging to the monsters themselves. Horror monsters, even at their most archetypal, commonly incorporate shared features, just as the Mummy does. As J. P. Telotte argues, monsters are often ‘quite literally hybrids or mixed forms … combinatory figures’ (2003: 219). The terms of classification are so loose in Twitchell’s attempt, for instance, that a blob, a giant spider and Frankenstein’s Monster are categorized as having more in common as hulks with no names than the human-like Frankenstein’s Monster, vampire and (pre-transformed) werewolf, who are all placed into separate categories. As well as sharing human form for long periods, the vampire and the werewolf’s abilities are also often entwined, with both spreading their conditions through infectious bite and the vampire frequently having the ability to change into a wolf. Many monsters are actually as mutable and difficult to categorize as the Mummy even though, like it, they have to varying degrees a ‘fixed’ identity in popular culture. Vampires have appeared as an array of creatures in the cinema including deluded white men in Martin (George A. Romero, USA, 1977) and Vampire’s Kiss (Robert Bierman, USA, 1989), afflicted African American men in Blacula (William Crain, USA, 1972) and Ganja & Hess (Bill Gunn, USA, 1973), space ghosts in Planet of the Vampires (Mario Bava, Italy, 1965)\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nand Lifeforce (Tobe Hooper, USA, 1985), children in Salem’s Lot (Tobe Hooper, USA, 1979) and Låt den Rätte Komma In (Let the Right One In, Tomas Alfredson, Sweden, 2008), mechanical bloodsuckers in I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle (Dirk Campbell, UK, 1990) and Cronos (Guillermo del Toro, Mexico, 1993) as well as an assortment of animals including bats in Nightwing (Arthur Hiller, USA, 1979), dogs in Dracula’s Dog (Albert Band, USA, 1977) and werecats in Sleepwalkers (Mick Garris, USA, 1992). Noël Carroll (1990), taking a somewhat different approach to archetype architects, argues that monsters in horror films are threatening precisely because they are indistinct, posing a psychological threat to individual identity because they are impure hybrids constructed from combinations of diverse elements, including those created through fission and those by fusion. In the former group are creatures whose contradictory elements are divided within the monster, resulting in the splitpersonality werewolf and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde among others. Those monsters created through fusion remain distinct individuals but are constituted of incompatible elements such as insect and human, machine and flesh or living and dead. Into this latter category falls the Mummy, with its living but desiccated flesh, along with vampires and zombies. Whatever group the Mummy has been placed into, hulk with no name or creature born of fusion, it has forever remained an outsider, a monstrous manqué, an ‘Other’ among the great monstrous ‘Others’ of the cinema. Andrew Tudor, for instance, totally ignores the Mummy and lists Frankenstein and Dracula as Universal studios’ major 1930s originals (1989: 162). S. S. Prawer similarly utterly overlooks the Mummy when he celebrates how after the coming of sound ‘Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), and White Zombie (1932) were all made in Carl Laemmle’s Universal Studios’ (1980: 9–10). The occupation of White Zombie, an independent production from the Halperin Brothers, in the 1932 slot exemplifies the tendency for the Mummy to be a figure excluded from the range of inquiry identifying canonical works within horror (in this case even at Universal), forever a monster (un)living in the shadows of monsters perceived as more profoundly meaningful. As Peter Hutchings points out, the Mummy has not lent itself as well as other Universal monsters such as Dracula and Frankenstein’s Monster to ‘particular forms of interpretation and analysis’ (2002), but rather than this being due to a deficiency in the make-up of the Mummy itself, this could equally suggest it has just not proven a suitable subject for customary ‘forms’ of study. Cinema’s monsters are often critically examined so as to determine what they represent, what is at the heart of their appeal or what is their essence. Monsters often lend themselves to such lines of enquiry because, as Marie Hélene-Huet points out, the word ‘monster’ is linked to ‘the idea of showing or warning’ because of its supposed derivation ‘from the Latin monstrare: to show, to display (montrer in French)’ (2000: 87). Actors too often have their own understandings of what the monsters they play mean, Lon Chaney Jr. believing that his monsters were ‘extreme variations on physical ugliness, mean-spiritedness and ignorance’ (Wells 2000: 54). For both those that play them and those that read or view them, therefore, often ‘monsters are meaning machines’ (Halberstam 1995: 21).\n\n10 The Mummy on Screen\n\nIn relation to Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula, Ken Gelder explains how it reveals: Anxieties about Darwinian notions of human evolution, the proliferation of discourses of decay and degeneration … the impact of psychoanalysis, the advocacy of late imperialist values, the emergence of new technologies, the influence of eugenics, and so on. Dracula is … a vibrant, bustling, ‘sensationalist’ novel, almost bursting at the seams with issues and themes. (2000: 145)\n\nAs this quotation exemplifies, the essence of a monster’s narrative can be multifaceted and difficult to determine, qualities very attractive to critics and cultural commentators. Monsters have been discussed at various times as manifestations of AIDS (Guerrero 1990), capitalism (Cormack 1994), our fear of the nonhuman (Thomas 1972) and physical deviancy (Donne 1972). Harry M. Benshoff (1997) has offered a queer reading of them, Charles Derry (1977) a psychological one, Isabel Cristina Pinedo (1997) a gendered one and David Soren (1977) an art historical one. As Noël Carroll elucidates in the case of critical responses to King Kong (Ernest B. Schoedsack, Merian C. Cooper, USA, 1933), we have had Kong ‘as Christ, Kong as Black, Kong as commodity, Kong as rapist, Kong enraptured by L’amour fou, Kong as Third World, Kong as dream, Kong as myth, Kong according to Freud, according to Jung, and even according to Lacan’ (1984: 215–16). Where does the Mummy fare in such readings: a monster who Paula Guran argues ‘we lack a solid psychological link to’ (2007: 376) and who Peter Hutchings defines as ‘undeveloped, devoid of desire, metaphor resistant, and with no subtext to call his own’ (2002)? Rather than being devoid of direct or indirect meaning, desire or distinctiveness, it is worth noting that the Mummy is a creature awash with them all, but who is at a disadvantage because its narratives have largely focused on romance over sex, with the latter tending to prove more critically appealing when analysing horror cinema (the former more readily discussed in respect to genres such as comedy and melodrama). Roger Dadoun, for instance, offers a characteristic interpretation of the metaphor resplendent Dracula as sexual aggressor: Dracula carries his body like an erect phallus: you only have to think of his usual stiff posture, his long black cape, his sudden appearances like a bolt from the blue. As if to emphasise this phallic value, the camera often marks a pause – while Dracula poses. In a film like Nosferatu [Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens, F. W. Murnau, Germany, Prana, 1922], a prototype of the horror film, the human vampire, as it appears to us almost constantly, is nothing other than this erection, a walking phallus or ‘phallambulist’, as one might say in French. (1989: 54)\n\nAs with Dadoun’s vampire, the bandaged male Mummy can be similarly defined as phallic and obsessed. Rather than acting on an insatiable lust, however, the Mummy’s sexuality is eternally repressed. It stands rigidly bolt upright in its tomb, alone in the dark in a perpetual state of unfulfilled longing and chastity. The permanent erect stiffness of the Mummy is commonly accentuated by him being presented in films as stepping out from upright coffins (Figure 0.1) in which he is standing as opposed to the male vampire\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nwho, upon awakening, is frequently presented as sitting up from coffins resting on the ground (psychosexually speaking, not in a permanent state of libidinous fixation or state of constant arousal because he has rested after sating his desires, becoming limp). This convention for the Mummy to be upright in its coffin may come from the common practice of them being so displayed in travelling shows and museums. It may also derive, as Jonathan Rigby suggests, from Imhotep as first presented at the beginning of The Mummy (1932) in an ‘impish homage to the awakening of Cesare in Das Cabinet des Dr Caligari [The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Robert Wiene, Germany, Decla-Bioscop, 1919]’ (2017: 126). Whatever the derivation, the male Mummy of the cinema is a figure who rigidly embodies sexual longing rather than sexual gratification. Whereas Dracula hedonistically emerges from his tomb and acts on his lust repeatedly, carnally and messily, the frustrated Mummy, enwrapped and restricted, rarely gets to swap fluids or strip off his bandages. He instead commonly witnesses others, usually modern heroes, win the heart of his object of desire. In contrast to the vampire who gives vent to his feelings through both physical and verbal exchange, the Mummy silently and obsessively focuses on one unattainable relationship, its one arm commonly pulled free, as if its release is all that has been achieved in a centurieslong purgatory of frustrated sexual craving. It can, therefore, be seen as a tragic, onanistic figure whose longings will never be satisfied. Unable to consummate, it is a monster forced to adhere to an ideal of romantic rather than physical love. Jasmine Day suggests that when it comes to the Mummy ‘celibacy’ is the ‘salient concept’\n\nFig. 0.1 Lobby card for The Mummy’s Tomb (1942).\n\n12 The Mummy on Screen\n\n(2015: 217) while Griselda Pollock (2007) in her reading of the Mummy goes further and identifies the figure with castration. Christopher Lee, who played the Mummy in Hammer’s The Mummy (1959), carefully contemplated this aspect of the Mummy too and proved sympathetic to the ‘impossibility of such a poor old monster having a love life, owing to the bandages and his mouth being sewn up’ (1977: 260). The lack of direct, penetrative sexual menace that the vampire conveys does not necessarily mean, though, that the Mummy’s threat is not as transmittable and pernicious as that of the vampire’s. This is primarily because of its associated curse. Sir Frank Whemple in The Mummy (1932) recognizes the Mummy’s infectivity when he bemoans that his son has fallen in love with a woman and been tainted by the association: ‘The curse has struck her, now, through her it will strike my son.’ It is usually an archaeologist who is the initial carrier of the Mummy’s curse, a man who gains forced access into the undefiled sanctified tomb, usually of a woman, in a foreign land. In contrast to male Mummies who tend to remain hideous figures, as Eleanor Dobson (2017) points out, female Mummies are usually beautifully preserved. His breaking of a sacred seal and pulling open of a sarcophagus to expose, gaze at and manhandle the beauty of the past lying within is redolent with imagery of rape and necrophilia. It proves to be a hazardous endeavour, with Jasmine Day suggesting that in the cinema such tombs persistently prove far from defenceless. When men penetrate them, the tombs are ‘retaliatory; they are vaginae dentatae, mouth-vaginas that try to destroy the penetrating instrument’ (2006: 80). For the crime of invading the tomb and desecrating the body of the female corpse, who had been buried with great care to avoid this very fate, the archaeologist brings back home with him to civilization a curse as punishment that threatens his loved ones at home. This ‘retaliation’ is perhaps most explicitly visually rendered in The Awakening (1980) when, as the obsessed archaeologist attacks the tomb, so too does the supernatural force from the tomb attack his pregnant wife’s womb, each swing of the hammer corresponding with her clutching her stomach in agony. More commonly, though, the curse brings with it a physically rendered agent of retribution, the avenging male Mummy, whose dirtiness and mouldering flesh is as representative of contagion as the infectious fangs of the vampire. The Mummy, fixated on the woman in the tomb, becomes intent on redressing the act of desecration (both to the tomb and his own ‘pure’ romantic obsession). Once activated, the Mummy’s curse can prove highly destructive and transmittable. For instance, Guy Boothby’s novel Pharos the Egyptian (1899) makes dramatic use of the fact that plague and ancient Egypt have been closely associated since the time of Moses. Boothby narrates how a stolen Mummy results in the spread of a disease that threatens to apocalyptically wipe out the population of Europe. Exactly one hundred years later, a Mummy in The Mummy (1999) could still be found threatening to bring about mass destruction, this time by reviving the ten plagues themselves. In addition to bringing about destruction and the end of life, the living dead commonly offer new forms of life too, tending to be reproductive; the vampire, werewolf and zombie all create more of themselves through their bite, with Frankenstein’s Monster\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nand the Mummy being notable exceptions because of their desire for monogamy. In films and TV shows that focus on the love life of Frankenstein’s Monster, such as The Bride of Frankenstein (James Whale, USA, 1935) and Penny Dreadful (John Logan, UK/USA, 2014–16), he yearns to bring to life a single ‘bride’ that is to be created through stitching together and reviving the recent dead. The Mummy has a similar yearning, but in his case his ‘bride’ is to be brought back into the world through re-awakening or reincarnating the ancient dead. It is not the fact that the Mummy does not have desire that makes it an unpopular subject for critical enquiry, therefore. Rather it has more to do with the fact that it does not particularly display it. The Mummy in the cinema has been inclined to be an especially inexpressive monster! Peter Hutchings suggests that the Mummy possesses ‘neither the charisma of Dracula, the pathos of Frankenstein’s monster, nor the sexualized rage of the Wolfman’ (2002). Yet it is the overt lack of such qualities, the ones identified here as making other monsters more interesting, that actually makes the Mummy so distinctive and effective in its own right. It is the Mummy’s frightening impenetrability that makes it so monstrous. First, the bandaged Mummy is further removed from us than virtually any other classic monster; it has been undead for far longer than any of them and the culture it is from is more ancient and alien than theirs. Secondly, the Mummy commonly has no voice, nor does it have facial expression, making it virtually impossible to identify with. The ‘archetypal’ bandaged Mummy is mute, masked, crippled, sullied, relentlessly slow, unstoppable and impossible to reason with. It lacks ‘humanity’ or personality, which has contributed to its marginalized position critically, but it is the lack of these very traits that has contributed to it being such a long enduring and effective monster in the cinema. It is therefore fruitless to apply criteria to the Mummy that apply to other classic monsters in a one-size-fits-all approach. Joyce Tyldesley, for example, argues that ‘only those Mummies who can successfully shed their bandages and expose their flesh and feelings can fully engage our sympathies in the way that Dracula does’ (1999: 100). James B. Twitchell similarly applies criteria utilized to assess other monsters when he contends that the Mummy fails because it is divorced from our ability to understand it: The Mummy, who is hopelessly bogged down in a complicated story that involves capturing his reincarnated girl-princess and returning with her to the world of the dead, lumbered his way through about ten films on both sides of the Atlantic without developing a coherent text, let alone a family. What is really under all that gauze and why can’t he articulate his desires? He can talk all right, but no one knows what it is he has to say. (1985: 260)\n\nActually the male, bandaged Mummy does not articulate his desires primarily because, most commonly, he cannot talk. His bandages impede him from doing so and in numerous versions he has had his tongue removed for committing an act of sacrilege in ancient Egypt. Twitchell is also incorrect in regard to the Mummy having no family. He does have one, albeit like any monster with a family, it is a dysfunctional one. He has his dead princess as a lover who may or may not return to life and/or a\n\n14 The Mummy on Screen\n\nhigh-priest as a companion who protects and/or controls him. His desire is so evident that it does not require articulating. He will defend the tomb and destroy all those who stand in the way of his being reunited with its occupant. He has a mute, compulsive single-mindedness of purpose that has served to make him an iconic monster and which has been adopted by other, more modern monsters too, most effectively in the slasher film of the 1970s and 1980s. Jason Vorhees from the Friday the 13th series and Michael Myers from the Halloween series, like the bandaged Mummy first popularized in The Mummy’s Hand (1940), have black empty eyes and masked faces. There is no way in. They have little personality, charisma or pathos and like the Mummy they are relentless and deaf to all pleas of mercy. It is their inaccessibility that makes them so frightening because, as Bruce Kawin astutely suggests, ‘what one can talk with, one can generally deal with’ (1984: 8). Just like the Mummy of The Mummy’s Tomb (Harold Young, USA, 1942) and The Mummy’s Ghost (1944), Jason and Michael carry out their brutal murders in small-town America and have a flashback story that defines their actions in the present.85 The slew of zombie films that followed Night of the Living Dead (George A. Romero, USA, 1968) testifies to the appeal of the charisma and pathos-free monster who cannot be reasoned with or talked to, to the extent that the Mummy has had to subsequently somewhat reinvent itself to distinguish itself from all of these silent and relentless monsters it preceded on screen by decades. The bandaged Mummy has increasingly diversified, effectively transforming in Universal’s big budget reimaginings into a warlock in The Mummy (1999) and a witch in The Mummy (2017), returning the Mummy full circle to the sorcerer that Universal first offered in The Mummy (1932). Studies of impenetrable monsters like Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees, perhaps because they are difficult to identify with and can thus prove ‘metaphor resistant’, have tended to concentrate upon how audiences respond to them as opposed to what they represent as ‘meaning machines’. Questions that have been asked are the following: Do male audience members identify with the monster in misogynistic pleasure in slasher films, or with the female victim in cross-gender identification? Is there female identification with the ‘final girl’ as an active female hero?86 Why and to whom monsters appeal can therefore be just as difficult to pin down as what monsters mean. A number of critics have argued that monsters are engaging because they address issues that are, as Walter Evans states, ‘uniquely tailored to the psyches of troubled adolescents’ (1975: 354). James B. Twitchell argues that they reflect the complicated rite of passage from onanism to reproductive sexuality, the vampire for example, having ‘everything any adolescent could want (money, all-night parties, uncomplicated sex)’ (1985: 89). S. S. Prawer similarly points out that there is ‘a good deal of analogy between the fate of such monsters and the adolescent experience: an appearance felt to be awkward and ungainly, the sprouting of hair in unaccustomed places, conflicts with father/creators, experiments with bodies in secluded spots.’ Yet he also points out that they have an appeal to adults too, drawing attention to Whale’s Frankenstein that was ‘made without thought of a teenage market’ (1980: 247). Les Daniels warns against forgetting that ‘these presumably frightening figures are\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nregarded with considerable affection by children’ as well, Dracula and Frankenstein being used to sell breakfast cereals like Count Chocula and Frankenberry through making the products ‘more attractive to prepubescent palates’ (1977: 257). As one can equally argue that monsters appeal to children, to teenagers and to adults, the conclusion to be drawn is that the same monsters speak to different groups in different ways depending upon how they are reworked and reinterpreted by filmmakers, critics and audiences. As a result, finding any reason for their appeal in general, or specific meaning, even to specific groups, is hugely challenging. If, as has been claimed with other monsters, the Mummy actually speaks of something other than itself, despite its muteness, then the questions arise as to what it has to say and to whom it is speaking? The answer incontestably depends. It depends upon the particular representation of the Mummy being offered in the cinema, or on television, or online, or in a theme park ride87 or in a video game and its moment of production, its moment of reception and the cultural and social contexts of these moments of encounter. It depends upon the particular knowledge of the viewer and who that viewer is in terms of age, race and gender. It depends upon whether one believes ‘readers and viewers are able to “negotiate their own meanings” or whether there are “preferred readings” or “limits to interpretation”’ (Barker and Sabin 1995: 214). As Barbara Klinger summarizes ‘the text, “in practice”, is an intersection at which multiple and extratextual practices of signification circulate’ (1984: 44). Some texts gain mainstream recognition, cult appeal, shock effect, camp charm and/or cultural value. Figures in these texts, as Terry Eagleton argues, can transcend ‘the originating textual conditions of their production’, and become ‘public mythologies, co-ordinates of a mighty moral debate’ (cited in Bennett and Woollacott 1987: 277). The Mummy, like any monster, does not have a meaning that is unchangingly rigid. ‘Public mythologies’ pertaining to the Mummy have existed in popular culture for centuries and transcend its long-held status as a pale reflection of greater monsters. As well as looking at the many qualities the Mummy shares with other monsters such as its homicidal tendencies, unnatural sexual desire, obsessive personality and ability to live beyond the grave, this book will also focus on what makes the Mummy distinct. It will survey the American and British cinema in which it has especially thrived and discuss that which has become particularly apposite to Mummy narratives by also exploring its pre-cinematic history and how this informed its on-screen manifestations. The main period focused upon is 1899–1959, primarily because this is when the majority of tropes were established (and to provide limits to avoid producing an encyclopaedia of Mummy movies rather than an exploration of the Mummy’s growth and development in the movies). The Mummy before and after this period is still considered for completeness and to provide an overall picture, but in less detail. The book consists of four parts that examine the development of the Mummy over the course of its history and that of the cinema, exploring the various and changing perceptions of the Mummy that have informed its depictions on the big screen. First, Chapter 1 contemplates what constitutes a Mummy film and discusses how the Mummy genre has been informed by Western attitudes towards the East. Chapter 2\n\n16 The Mummy on Screen\n\nthen chronicles the Mummy’s pre-cinema history and the centuries-held view of the Mummy as a lifeless object, one to be used, displayed and even consumed by the West. Chapter 3 traces how this conception of the Mummy as lifeless translated into early-nineteenth-century literature, with writers over the course of the century then developing and transforming the Mummy to such an extent that by its end it had become primarily a romantic figure. Chapter 4 illustrates how this romantic Mummy featured prominently in the early years of cinema in both romances and comedies until being profoundly redefined as tragic and horrific following the discovery of Tutankhamun. Chapter 5 considers this reconceptualized Mummy in The Mummy (1932), which although new in some respects remained heavily indebted to pre-existing narratives of romance from silent cinema and Mummy literature. Chapter 6 discusses Universal’s 1940s Mummy as a marked departure from The Mummy (1932) and explores just how influential and innovative this cycle of four films actually was, despite its reputation for being repetitive, derivative and ‘puerile’ (Vieira 2003: 97). Chapter 7 focuses on the British studio Hammer Film Productions’ The Mummy (1959), which refashioned the narratives established in Universal’s Mummy movies into a complex tragedy that explored conflicts between cultures, beliefs and races with great sophistication. Finally, Chapter 8 brings the Mummy up to date with a brief summary of the last sixty years of Mummy film production including Hammer’s and Universal’s consequent Mummy movies. This over half-century of cinema certainly requires more in-depth analysis than given in this final chapter, but there have simply been too many Mummies from too many places in too many forms to be able to examine them all. Brevity has thus proven unavoidable in regard to more recent significant movies in order to accommodate the discussion of the Mummy’s origins, evolution and transformation into one of cinema’s towering figures of horror within the space afforded between the covers of this book.\n\nNotes 1.

Although few and far between, there have been some noteworthy academic studies of Mummy movies. Perhaps predictably with a monster called the ‘Mummy’, psychoanalysis has proven an especially popular method used to analyse it. See, for instance, Kawin (1984), Hutchings (1993), Pollock (2007) and Peirse (2013). Other works on the Mummy include Halliwell (1988: 185–235), which provides plot synopses and details of inconsistencies in plotting, locations and time periods in books and films featuring Mummies. Telotte (2003) discusses The Mummy (1932) in relation to science and modernism, Freeman (2009) identifies some of the recurrent themes in Mummy films and Day (2015) examines the Mummy’s oft-times human controller. 82. See Brier (2013), Cardin (2015), Huckvale (2012) and Lupton (2003). Cowie and Johnson’s (2002) broad history of the Mummy in popular culture offers accounts of some Mummy movies they considered to be good or poor. Day (2006) examines changing public attitudes towards the ‘curse of the pharaohs’ including surveys and field observations of museum visitors. It also includes insightful analyses of a number of Mummy films. 83. See, for example, Eyles (1978: 44). 84. The 1940s Mummy, due to being originally certified and released with few restrictions placed on viewing age and then reappearing on television in the 1950s, was especially accessible to children (see Day 2006: 95), perhaps helping to account for its association with childishness. For a nostalgic account of audience memories on seeing The Mummy (1932) upon its original release, see Kuhn (2002: 66). 85. Marra (2014) explains how Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, USA, 1960) is frequently identified as a precursor to the slasher film, introducing ‘horror tropes essential for its formulation’ (27). He further argues that Hitchcock’s ‘slasher’ film had notable and overlooked American-made precursors in ‘films from the classical Hollywood era, such as The Leopard Man (Jacques Tourneur, 1943), The Lodger (John Brahm, 1944), Bluebeard (Edgar G. Ulmer, 1944), The Spiral Staircase (Robert Siodmak, 1945), and Hangover Square (John Brahm, 1945)’ (28). However, these proto-slasher films were themselves prefigured by the similarly overlooked Mummy of the early 1940s. Further, so too was Psycho itself indebted to the Mummy. The writer of Psycho, Robert Bloch, was clearly infatuated with the figure, writing several Mummy stories including The Secret of Sebek (1937) and The Eyes of the Mummy (1938) before the mummified mother of Norman Bates made her climactic shock appearance in Psycho. Bloch proceeded thereafter to present yet another Mummy onscreen in the made-for-TV movie The Cat Creature (Curtis Harrington, USA, 1973). 86. For discussions of these questions see, for example, Clover (1992) and Cherry (2002, 2009). 87. The Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride, inspired by The Mummy (1999), is an indoor rollercoaster that opened in 2004 at Universal Studios Florida.

Boris Karloff’s Mummy in disguise, Ardath Bey, in The Mummy (1932) and the various Mummy-mastering high-priests who followed thereafter in films like The Mummy’s Hand (1940) belong to this ‘museum of the past’. They may appear to be finely dressed or fez-wearing Arabs, but they are fundamentally timeless Egyptians who still follow the ancient ways. They seem to be proof of Rider Haggard’s eponymous hero’s contention in Smith and the Pharaohs that ‘the East may change its masters and its gods, but its customs never change, and if today Allah wore the feathers of Amen one wonders whether the worshippers would find the difference so very great’ (1912 repr. Stephens 2001: 157). Mummy films acknowledge little difference between the ancient and the modern, with only scant attention given to the Muslim country that Egypt has been since AD 639. The archaeologists of Mummy films repeatedly see Egypt as incapable of looking after its own interests (and by extension, its treasures), with modern Arabs only suitable for either granting permits for Western experts or forming gangs to dig for tombs. Such a view of the Westerner as active and dynamic and the Oriental as passive and incapable has a history that long predates the Mummy film. Following the translation into English of the Alf Layla wa-Layki (The Arabian Nights) in the eighteenth century, the Orient (the term for Europeans conjuring the Middle East rather than the Far East) became associated with Eastern stagnation and decline and was contrasted with the dynamism of the West: the Arab world newly envisaged as exotic and anaemic with ‘moonlit seraglios, the baths, the genii, the magic rings and caskets, the mysterious, blushing princesses and imperious sultans’ (Mack 1992: xiv). Like India, its intriguing mysticism and luxury, while greatly appealing to the Western imagination, was\n\nattributed with having held it back and making it decadent and weak.1 Egypt was an impressive and alluring ‘Other’, but with clearly fading glamour. It was in need of rescuing from its incapable inheritors, the contemporary Egyptians: a view that served to ideologically justify its colonization. Such an authoritarian imperialistic attitude was prevalent throughout the colonial period and took the form of ‘a hierarchical view of the world in which the white races’ occupied a permanent place on top ‘with the colonized ranged in varying degrees of supposed inferiority’ (Chowdhry 2000: 251). Edward Said suggests Egypt was situated near the bottom of such colonial racial ranking: ‘Egypt was not just another colony: it was the vindication of Western imperialism; it was, until its annexation by England, an almost academic example of Oriental backwardness; it was to become the triumph of English knowledge and power’ (1978: 35). In spite of such ‘backwardness’, however, the Orient was still a threat in one important respect. The racial distinctions that justified colonialism had a major drawback in the form of mixed-race children being produced from relationships between European men acting as colonial enforcers and local women (Stoler 1989: 634–60). Such children blurred the distinction between races and so in the twentieth century colonial administrators allowed European women to move to colonial territories in order to stem the generation of mixed-race children. While ensuring that their husbands would not procreate with local women, they also prevented their children from being influenced by local customs and ideas thereby ensuring racial segregation.2 As a result, women in the colonies became imperial enforcers too, but at a cost because at the same time they, like their husbands, became highly vulnerable themselves. While serving to prevent their spouses succumbing to temptation in dangerous foreign lands, they did, of course, face temptations of their own. Therefore while reducing the risk of miscegenation on the one hand, they increased it on the other. The heroine of The Mummy (1932) finds herself in such a position of vulnerability and temptation while in Egypt, drawn to an Egyptian while involved with a Westerner, torn between desire and an unwillingness to betray her own sense of propriety. Egypt in this film is not just a land of remote and incomprehensible history but also a presentday source of overwhelming and mysterious exoticism and eroticism, making it a perfect site for her to succumb and transgress: such yielding to temptation proving an essential ingredient of classic horror of the 1930s. Time and again in horror films of this decade, as Rhona J. Berenstein explains, ‘well-behaved women’ transform after falling ‘under the spell of hypnotic creatures … [and] … exhibit a remarkable degree of sexual allure. … Girl gets boy at the conclusion, but her best times, the moments that give her free rein to throw all caution to the wind, are spent with the monster’ (1996a: 90). Egypt was the perfect setting for Helen to fall foul of such sexual spells in The Mummy (1932) because the Orient personified that which was forbidden in the West; it was a place where there existed indescribable sexual possibilities, but also great peril. In 1924 E. M. Forster’s novel A Passage to India related how the colonies could prove too much for the fragile psyches of Western women and Sir George\n\n26 The Mummy on Screen\n\nFletcher MacMunn’s account of half-understood Indian history further reveals other ascribed colonial beliefs of the time in his 1931 The Romance of the Indian Frontiers. ‘Astounding indecency’ was understood as commonplace, MacMunn wrote, with ‘bestiality recorded: the mingling of humans and animals in intimate embrace’ because ‘the ancient religions did permit such terrible abominations’ (cited in Harrison 1991: 179). As MacMunn’s account discloses, there was a dangerous, almost alien sexual world to be encountered when visiting the colonies. Alongside the maddening heat and unfamiliar traditions, the ancient gods still haunted such lands and the draw of suppressed urges or forbidden temptations could be attributed to their combined overpowering and seductive power. Helen in The Mummy (1932) is a woman who succumbs not only to the influence of the Mummy but also to the lure of Egypt itself and its ancient ways that still hold sway. Such self-serving projections onto an alien divinity or a personification of ‘India’ or ‘Egypt’ for those things that are felt to be repressed and outside the sphere of reason or civilized behaviour are today also bound up with the concept of ‘the Other’ that Robin Wood suggests lies at the thematic core of horror. For Wood, ‘the Other’ comprises all that our culture ‘represses or oppresses’ (1984: 171), horror narratives releasing and then ritually re-suppressing what society (as defined chiefly by a white, Western, patriarchal, heterosexual, capitalistic, political and ideological mainstream) denounces. If one accepts Wood’s thesis, one can see the Mummy film as having a formidable formula, with the Orient serving as an effective site and its chief monster functioning as a potent medium for the release of the suppressed. Both Egypt and the Mummy offer heroines in particular unthought-of opportunities, tempting them with the promise of their ‘best times’ if they will only ‘throw all caution to the wind’, violate the accepted boundaries of social and sexual behaviour and give themselves over to losing themselves. That the Mummy genre fails, as Kim Newman contends, because ‘a corpse which has been wrapped up for three thousand years lacks erotic possibilities’ (1996: 225), overlooks the erotic possibilities afforded the heroine. The risks and appeal of miscegenation, necrophilia, unfaithfulness and other forms of off-limits desire are sources of constant tension throughout the Mummy film. The Egyptian Mummy displays a consistent desire to break sexual boundaries by yearning for a hot-blooded Western woman or displaying passion for a departed lover whose blood has run cold. Male archaeologists, heroic adventurers and female heroines are all drawn to enigmatic corpses and/or racial ‘Others’, being variously hypnotized, transformed, romanced, coerced and/or transported away from their humdrum lives, sometimes through time to re-experience an ancient past in which they once lived, sometimes through space to Egypt where the monster stalks or seduces them. Western fascination with the Orient and its sexual and spiritual associations lies at the heart of the Mummy genre and its central narratives of colonial incursion, monstrous retaliation and romance, mirroring the troubled politics and sexual politics that have accompanied imperial invasion, the imposition of new values and indigenous resistance. The centrality of the concept of reincarnation to the Mummy’s\n\nThe Creature’s Features 27\n\nstory, alien to the ancient Egyptians but familiar through Britain’s colonial relationship with India and the Hindu beliefs encountered there,3 underscores the centrality of the colonial experience to the Mummy genre and how Egypt’s actual past was brought into line with the Western imagination, making it another form of ‘Western projection’ (Said 1978: 95) that bears little relationship with ‘the real Egypt’ Helen so longs for at the beginning of The Mummy.\n\nThe Mummy genre: Inter est and Disinter est Just as nebulous as the Egypt of the Mummy film is the Mummy film itself. Although the Mummy projected onto the screen has been for the most part both Oriental and monstrous, there have also been occasions when it has been neither, such as in Mercy, the Mummy Mumbled (R. G. Phillips, USA, Ebony, 1918) in which it is both African American and a normal living man. A key question that arises when it comes to the Mummy film, therefore, is not only what a Mummy film ‘means’ but also what it constitutes. How does one define a Mummy film, or genre – or if not qualifying for that term – a subgenre in the cinema? It is a complicated question because, as Rick Altman explains, the notion of genre is a polyvalent concept. Genre acts as a blueprint, ‘as a formula that precedes, programmes and patterns industry production’, as a structure, ‘as the formal framework on which individual films are founded’, as a label, ‘as the name of a category central to the decisions and communications of distributors and exhibitors’, as well as a contract that establishes ‘the viewing position required by each genre film of its audience’ (2000: 14). One method a number of critics have applied to set about this ‘polyvalent concept’ has been to discuss genres through utilizing lifecycle terminology. As Altman (2000) points out, critics including Jane Feuer (1993: 88), John George Cawelti (1986: 200), Brian Taves (1993: 22) and Thomas Schatz (1981: 38) have all discussed how they develop and how they become articulate and selfconscious and then tired, predictable and worn-out. Once they have evolved beyond a certain point, they are seen to peter out, or be replaced, or transform into other cycles. Although horror is arguably a perennially popular genre in the cinema, specific monster cycles can be understood to have thrived and then died out, such as in the 1930s (primarily at Universal),4 the 1940s (again mainly at Universal), the 1950s (with sci-fi aliens taking over at the expense of classic monsters) and the 1960s and 1970s (with the rise and fall of Hammer’s reinterpretations of Universal’s classic monsters). Although monsters evidently rise and fall in popularity, to be resurrected anew, the death of the Mummy genre is one that appears to have been actively sought by a number of critics, being pronounced dead on the screen on a number of occasions. Take the 1980s, for example. In 1980 Arnold Madison stated that ‘the enthusiasm for making films about mummies may have ended’ (1980: 80) and in 1983 Tom Hutchinson and Roy Pickard claimed that ‘the era of movies that dealt with … the Mummy … seems to have ended. The vaults of our interest appear to have been finally sealed against those ancient dead “born” from the ancient Egyptian\n\n28 The Mummy on Screen\n\nneed to embalm’ (1983: 67). Similarly, Richard Davis claimed in 1987 that ‘while the cult of the zombie still attracts film makers and audiences, the subject of Mummies seems to be currently out of favour’ (1987: 134). Yet the Mummy was alive and kicking (or most commonly limping) in 1980s cinema, featuring in, among others, The Awakening (1980), Fade to Black (1980), La Momia Nacional (1981), Dawn of the Mummy (1981), O Segredo da Múmia (1982), The Tomb (Fred Olen Ray, USA, 1986), Transylvania 6-5000 (Rudy De Luca, USA/Yugoslavia, 1985), The Dungeonmaster (Charles Band et al., USA, 1985), Il Était une Fois le Diable (1985), The Monster Squad (Fred Dekker, USA, 1987), Waxwork (Anthony Hickox, USA, 1988) and Monster High (1989).5 As well as proving a popular on-screen subject in the 1980s, in the world of literature it proved to be the Mummy’s most successful decade ever with Anne Rice’s 1989 novel The Mummy or Ramses the Damned becoming ‘the best selling mummy novel in history’ (Cardin 2015: xxxi). Such a tendency to call time on the Mummy in spite of its continued resurrections in the cinema has continued, with Jasmine Day in 2015 proclaiming that ‘Mummy films, per se, are dead’ (222), only one year after Mummies starred in several horror movies including American Mummy (2014), Day of the Mummy (Johnny Tabor, USA/ Venezuela, 2014), Frankenstein vs. The Mummy (Damien Leone, USA, 2014) and The Mummy Resurrected (Patrick McManus, USA, 2014). It would seem that the Mummy movie is repeatedly declared extinct by critics such as Hutchinson, Pickard, Davis and Day because there no longer appear to be films around at the time that for them meet certain criteria to constitute the continued existence of a Mummy genre. This question of genre classification (just as with monster archetypes) is complex and one can easily go the other way to Hutchinson, Pickard and Davis and find a great number of films that one could add to a list of 1980s Mummy movies. The pilot movie for the television series The Phoenix (1981) and Time Walker (1982), for example, featured ancient aliens who awoke like Mummies from ancient tombs. The Hunger (Tony Scott, UK/USA, 1983) and Vamp (Richard Wenk, USA, 1986) have centuries-old Egyptian vampire queens, Young Sherlock Holmes and the Pyramid of Fear (Barry Levinson, UK/USA, 1985) and Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh (Dean Tschetter as Alan Smithey, USA, 1988) ancient Egyptian death cults, Escarabajos Asesinos (1982) and Puppet Master (David Schmoeller, USA, 1989) immortal Egyptian sorcerers and Mannequin (Michael Gottlich, USA, 1987) an ancient Egyptian woman awakening in modern times (a popular premise of the Mummy film in the silent era). For James Naremore, when looking at genre it is the critical context that is crucial when classifying films, with the categorization of a set of films as generic depending upon contemporary and cultural notions of what that genre is (1995–6: 12–28). One can ask whether The Fifth Element (Luc Besson, France/USA, 1997) is a Mummy movie with its opening set in an Egyptian tomb and its bandaged heroine brought back to life. One can question the suitability of Stargate (Roland Emmerich, USA, 1994) with its immortal Egyptian alien who reawakens from a sarcophagus within a pyramid, or X-Men Apocalypse (Bryan Singer, USA, 2016) with its ancient god-like\n\nThe Creature’s Features 29\n\nvillain who emerges from his pyramid after ruling ancient Egypt with an a"
