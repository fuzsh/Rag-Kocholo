Murders by Agatha Christie.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbert Aachen, a clown with a unique diving act, is found dead, the murder weapon happens to be a poison dart. When a woman named Betty Barnard becomes the next victim, detective Hercule Poirot suspects that Sir Carmichael Clarke could be in grave danger.\n\nAs Poirot and Captain Hastings look into the crimes, a beautiful woman with an interesting monogram named Amanda Beatrice Cross becomes the focus of their investigation, at least until she leaps into the Thames.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nTony Randall as Hercule Poirot\n\nAnita Ekberg as Amanda\n\nRobert Morley as Captain Hastings\n\nMaurice Denham as Inspector Japp\n\nGuy Rolfe as Duncan Doncaster\n\nSheila Allen as Lady Diane\n\nJames Villiers as Franklin\n\nJulian Glover as Don Fortune\n\nGrazina Frame as Betty Barnard\n\nClive Morton as 'X'\n\nCyril Luckham as Sir Carmichael Clarke\n\nRichard Wattis as Wolf\n\nDavid Lodge as Sergeant\n\nPatrick Newell as Cracknell\n\nAustin Trevor as Judson\n\nWindsor Davies as Dragbot\n\nDrewe Henley as Bowling Alley Attendant\n\nSheila Reid as Mrs. Fortune\n\nMargaret Rutherford as Miss Marple\n\nStringer Davis as Mr. Stringer.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe part of Poirot had originally been intended for Zero Mostel but the film was delayed because Agatha Christie objected to the script; amongst the things objected to was the intention to put in a bedroom scene with Hercule Poirot.[2] The film varies significantly from the novel and emphasises comedy, the specialty of director Frank Tashlin. Poirot is given buffoonish characteristics, while still remaining a brilliant detective.\n\nThe film features uncredited cameos by Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple and Stringer Davis as her friend Mr Stringer. The pair had previously appeared in a series of four films as the characters produced by MGM between 1961 and 1964.[3]\n\nAustin Trevor, who plays the butler Judson, had played Poirot in three British films in the early 1930s: Alibi (1931), Black Coffee (1931) and Lord Edgware Dies (1934).\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"Depressingly unfunny comedy-thriller: though directed by Tashlin, virtually none of the misadventures encountered by Poirot during the course of his case raise even the slightest smile. Even the tangled mystery, solved by a typical Agatha Christie 'surprise', is unusually dreary.\"[4]\n\nLeonard Maltin gives the film 2 1/2 out of 4 stars, calling it an \"odd adaptation\" of Christie's book. Maltin goes on to say, \"the strange casting of Randall ... and a little too much slapstick make this more a curiosity than anything else.\"[5]\n\nTCM calls Randall's Poirot \"an Inspector Clouseau-style bumbler\", noting that the second installment of the Pink Panther series had been well-received the previous year.[6]\n\nA. H. Weiler of The New York Times dismissed the film as \"a routine run through of clich√©s and clues.\"[7]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAgatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple, another case of Marple and Poirot coexisting in the same story\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
