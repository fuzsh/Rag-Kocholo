        "text": "An unusual announcement in a small-town newspaper advertisement reads: “A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 13th, at Little Paddocks – at 6:30 p.m.” Is it a joke? A party invitation? Unable to resist, a group of curious villagers gathers at Miss Blacklock’s Victorian house at the appointed time. Suddenly, the lights go out, a gun is fired and they become witnesses to a murder. The victim is an unexpected and unknown visitor. What follows is a classic Christie puzzle of mixed motives, concealed identities, a second death, and a determined Inspector grimly following the twists and turns. Fortunately, Miss Marple is on hand to unravel a complex series of relationships and events. With some risk to herself, she embarks on finding the solution and faces a dramatic confrontation with a killer. Miss Marple makes her Peninsula Players debut as she searches for a killer."
