Let me bore y'all with my two bits. English is a Germanic based language in which 60% of its vocabulary ir Romance in origin. (Latin by way of French). If you like etymology and language studies it's an interesting thing.

When the Normans "conquered" England in 1066 it was simply a replacement of the ruling class of Anglo-Saxon descended people with French speaking Normans. (Who were originally of Norse Viking stock.) The new royal court spoke French for I think up to 100 years before they started speaking English like their subjects. An interesting phenomenon is the two-layered speech that developed in England. A "cow" (Germanic source) was out in the field. When it was slaughtered and prepared for the lord's table it bacame "beef" (boeuf, a French term). A "house" (Germanic "haus") was where the people lived while the "mansion" (maison) was where the ruling class lived. You get the idea.

Elizabethian English of the 1500's was closer to French construction than what English is now. That's why Appalachian "hillbilly" speech actually harks back to the old French constructions. That's why Jethro Bodine saying, "We commenced to shootin'" is actually a direct link to the French "commencer a" (begin to). Another example would be "I heard tell" comming from the French construction "J'ai entendu dire" meaning the same thing.

So, as discussed a week or so ago on this site, French and Spanish are two of the Romance languages of Southern Europe descended from Latin, with Spanish having the advantage of acquiring an added richness from 700 years of Arab rule. English in turn (in my opinion as a French Canadian descendant) has the added richness of French infusion by the Norseman. (Figure that one out!)

Sorry to prattle on but it's not often I get to communicate with folks like you all who enjoy languages.
