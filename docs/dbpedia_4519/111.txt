2 Bits, 1 Byte is an assembly language for a 2-bit CPU, made by User:Gilbert189. With 1 byte of memory, this machine could store at least 2 instructions.

Operations

The following are instructions of 2 Bits, 1 Byte:

Code Name Description 00 DON DO Nothing. 01 ACT ACTion. Given value in memory, change the value according to the following table:

From To 00 11 01 10 10 00 11 01

10 JMP JuMP. Jump (unconditionally) to address specified. 11 END END. Print the entire memory as character and end the program.

The instruction pointer can wrap around, thus allowing more "complicated" programs.

Programs

Since the memory is one byte, you can represent the entire program with just one character.

For example:

I

becomes:

01001001

which, when disassembled, becomes:

ACT 00b JMP 01b

Example codes

Endless loop

'

Disassembled:

DON JMP 01b END ; lol

Output 'm'

a

Try it online

Disassembled:

ACT 10b DON ; becomes END

Alternative

]

Quine

Any digit outputs itself. For example:

7

Try it online

Each ASCII digit starts with 0011 in binary, so the first two instructions are DON END.

Also, any character with ASCII value not less than 0xC0 is a quine, because the first instruction is END.

Another Quine

?

Output "|"

~

Output "{"

t

Truth-machine

nn 01 01 11

Where nn is replaced with the two-bit representation of the input: 00b or 01b. In line with truth-machines with limited IO, the memory location to monitor is the first two bits, and can be "read" every time the IP = 1. The final memory dump is not relevant under this convention. The zero input program is \x17 and the one input is W.
