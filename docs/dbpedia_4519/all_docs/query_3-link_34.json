        "text": "The NYSSB recognizes high school graduates who have attained a high level of proficiency in English and one or more world languages. The intent of the NYSSB is to encourage the study of languages, to identify high school graduates with language and biliteracy skills for employers, to provide universities with additional information about applicants seeking admission and placement, to prepare students with twenty-first century skills, to recognize the value of language instruction, and to affirm the value of diversity in a multilingual society. Successful candidates will earn three points in English and three points in each world language from a points matrix, which includes course grades, national and state exams, transcripts, and culminating projects. The NYSSB takes the form of a Seal on the student's diploma and a medallion worn at graduation.\n\nHistory of the NYSSB\n\nNew York State boasts a rich linguistic and cultural heritage, with students speaking over 200 languages. Understanding the importance of multilingualism and multiliteracy, the New York State Legislature established the New York State Seal of Biliteracy in 2012, with the first set of graduates earning the Seal in the 2015-2016 academic year. The NYSSB is an award given by a high school, school district or county office of education that formally recognizes students who have attained a high level of proficiency in two or more world languages (one of which must be English) by high school graduation. The NYSSB is awarded by the Commissioner to students who meet the criteria established by the Board of Regents and who attend schools that voluntarily agree to participate in the program. The NYSSB is affixed to the student’s high school diploma and transcript and must be made available to students at no cost.\n\nThe NYSSB acknowledges the importance of being biliterate in today’s global society. It highlights the hard work and achievement of students, and encourages them to pursue language study while in school, including the continued development of one’s home language. The recognition of attaining biliteracy is also a statement of accomplishment for future employers and for college admission.\n\nIn January 2014, the NYS Board of Regents approved the implementation of a NYSSB pilot program. This pilot program afforded self-selected districts the opportunity to develop innovative ways of measuring and creating an approved path to the attainment of the NYSSB. The pilot gave districts and schools the opportunity to inform policy development statewide and share best practices. Six districts and 20 public schools volunteered to participate in the pilot program. As a result of this yearlong program, it was recommended that students have the flexibility to demonstrate proficiency in English and one or more world languages using a variety of methods, including nationally recognized assessments, coursework, projects, and prior coursework completed in a country outside of the U.S.\n\nIn 2015-16, when the NYSSB was first piloted by 20 schools, a total of 284 students earned the NYSSB. Since then, this distinction has been awarded to over 17,800 students from hundreds of New York State schools, including public, charter, and non-public high schools.\n\nQ: What is the New York State Seal of Biliteracy?\n\nA: The New York State Seal of Biliteracy (NYSSB) was established to recognize high school graduates who have attained a high level of proficiency in the three modes of communication (Interpretive, Interpersonal, Presentational) in English and one or more world languages. These modes are inclusive of the skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing, all of which have been updated with the adoption of the NYS Learning Standards for World Languages (2021).\n\nQ: What is the intent of the NYSSB?\n\nA: The intent of the NYSSB is to:\n\naffirm the value of diversity in a multilingual society;\n\nencourage the study of languages;\n\nidentify high school graduates with language and biliteracy skills for employers;\n\nprovide universities with additional information about applicants seeking admission;\n\nprepare students with twenty-first century skills; and\n\nrecognize the value of world and home language instruction.\n\nThese goals are consistent with the Regents Reform Agenda of ensuring that all New York State students graduate college-, career-, and civic-ready.\n\nQ: Why should districts implement a NYSSB program?\n\nA: The NYSSB acknowledges the importance of being bilingual in today’s global society. It highlights the hard work and achievement of students, and encourages them to pursue language study while in school. The recognition of attaining biliteracy becomes part of the high school transcript and diploma for these students and is a statement of accomplishment for future employers and for college admission. The NYSSB promotes and strengthens robust English and World Language programs. In addition, the NYSSB positively contributes to the school's “College, Career, and Civic Readiness (CCCR)” score in the same way as Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) courses and the Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation.\n\nQ: What is the College, Career, and Civic Readiness (CCCR) level score?\n\nA: According to Understanding the New York State Accountability System under the Every Student Succeeds Acts (ESSA), “The College, Career, and Civic Readiness indicator uses diplomas, credentials, advanced course credits and enrollment, Career and Technical Education (CTE) certifications, and indicators such as a Seal of Biliteracy or participation in a Smart Scholars program to determine how a school is preparing its students to be ready for college, a career, and civic engagement once the students leave the school. For each accountability subgroup, a CCCR Index, which ranges from 0 to 200, is calculated by awarding extra credit for students who demonstrate higher levels of readiness as well as partial credit for students who complete a High School Equivalency certificate. The formula for computing the CCCR Index is as follows:\n\nDenominator: The number of students in the 4-year cohort as of June 30th of the reporting year + the number of ELL students not in the 4-year cohort who earned a Regents diploma with a Seal of Biliteracy in the current reporting year.\n\nNumerator: The sum of the number of students in the denominator demonstrating success on each of the specific readiness measures multiplied by the weighting assigned to each of these measures in accordance with the table below. Note that students receiving a High School Equivalency (HSE) diploma in the reporting year are included in the numerator but not the denominator.\n\nQ: Which schools can offer the NYSSB?\n\nA: All public and charter high schools that offer 12th grade may have a NYSSB program. In addition, non-public high schools that are registered with the State Office of Religious and Independent Schools (SORIS) of NYSED to award the NYS Regents Diploma may have a NYSSB program. In order to award the NYSSB, a school must offer the NYS Regents Diploma, which is a foundational requirement to earn the NYSSB. Schools that do not offer the NYS Regents Diploma may explore the option of the Global Seal of Biliteracy as an alternative pathway. Click here for more information on the Global Seal.\n\nQ: Who can receive the NYSSB?\n\nA: The NYSSB may be granted to any graduating student who attends a district that offers the NYSSB and meets the criteria for the award set forth by NYSED by the end of the academic year (August) in which they graduate.\n\nQ: When can the NYSSB be awarded?\n\nA: While students may begin working toward the NYSSB prior to the year in which they will graduate, the NYSSB can only be awarded upon graduation. For instance, a student could earn points in English and/or a world language in grades 9 through 11, however the student would only be awarded the NYSSB in the year in which they graduate. Students who receive exam scores necessary for points toward the NYSSB after June graduation are able to receive the Seal through August of their graduating year. Students who graduate in August are eligible to earn the NYSSB if all points are accrued by graduation.\n\nQ: Who awards the NYSSB to students?\n\nA: The NYSSB is an award given by the Commissioner through a participating school, district, or county office of education that formally recognizes students who have attained a high level of proficiency in English and one or more world languages by high school graduation.\n\nQ: In which languages can a student earn the NYSSB?\n\nA: The NYSSB is intended for all students who can demonstrate a high level of proficiency in both English and any other world language. Any human language in which a student can demonstrate the required proficiency qualifies towards the NYSSB. This includes languages taught in schools, as well home languages that may or may not be taught in schools. Any version of English may be used to satisfy the English requirements of the NYSSB when combined with another world language. Students can earn the NYSSB in multiple languages. For example, a student can earn the NYSSB in English and in both Spanish and Catalan, since these last two are distinct languages.\n\nQ: Are there costs to districts or students related to the NYSSB?\n\nA: NYSED provides the seals and medallions free of charge to all participating schools for the number of verified NYSSB candidates who are graduating. All costs other than the seal and medallion are borne by the district (e.g., approved Checkpoint C assessments other than AP and IB exams, interpreters/translators) and may not be passed on to the student. If a student chooses to take one of the approved assessments for criterion 1D or 2D, that cost is borne by the district the student attends. AP and IB exams are not covered under this statement as they apply to both coursework and an exam and often permit the student to earn college credit based on their score. Seal Coordinators should identify potential NYSSB candidates as early as possible prior to their graduating year so as to be able to put together a budget for exams needed to earn the NYSSB. Districts may choose to incur discretionary costs to offer the NYSSB including additional graduation regalia (e.g., honor cords) and costs related to awards ceremonies.\n\nQ: Who provides the physical seal and any graduation regalia to the students?\n\nA: NYSED provides the official seal to be placed directly on student diplomas as well as the medallions for students to wear at graduation at no cost to participating districts. In addition, a certificate template is provided to schools to print for all Seal earners.\n\nQ: What do the Seals and the medallions look like?\n\nA: The Seal is one-inch in diameter with the image of the official New York State Seal of Biliteracy and must be placed on the student's diploma. The medallion is one-inch in diameter, mounted on a brushed gold metal disc with a yellow ribbon. The medallion may be worn by students at their official graduation ceremony or other recognition events.\n\nQ: Can a student earn the NYSSB if the district the student attends does not offer the NYSSB?\n\nA: No. In order to earn the NYSSB, a student must attend a district that offers the NYSSB. Students who attend districts that do not offer the NYSSB should speak to their school counselor or language teacher to inquire about the possibility of starting such a program. If that is not a possibility, students can look into earning the Global Seal of Biliteracy.\n\nQ: To get more information on and/or to ask questions about the NYSSB, which office do I contact?\n\nA: For more information on the NYSSB:\n\nContact the Office of Bilingual Education and World Languages (OBEWL) at NYSED [obewl@nysed.gov; (518) 473-7505].\n\nThe NYSSB Guidance Toolkit is a series of informational modules that guide districts through the process of implementing and expanding their NYSSB programs. Click here to access the modules.\n\nEach Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network (RBERN) has a Resource Specialist designated to support districts who are offering or wish to offer the NYSSB.\n\nCapital District RBERN at Questar III BOCES\n\nHudson Valley RBERN at SW BOCES\n\nLong Island RBERN at ES BOCES\n\nMid-State RBERN at OCM BOCES\n\nMid-West RBERN at Monroe 2 – Orleans BOCES\n\nNYC Regional RBERN at Fordham University\n\nNYS Language RBERN at New York University\n\nRBERN West at Erie I BOCES\n\nCulminating Projects, Presentations & Rubrics\n\nStudents may demonstrate the required level of proficiency for the Seal in English and/or a world language by completing and presenting a Culminating Project, which can take the form of project, a scholarly essay, or a portfolio. The Culminating Project, when successfully completed and presented, may earn the student 2 points for criterion 1E and/or 2E of the NYSSB. To satisfy the Culminating Project criteria, a student must demonstrate the required level of proficiency based on the language in which the student is seeking the points.\n\nFor English and category 1-2 modern languages (those that use a Roman-based alphabet such as Spanish, French, Italian, German), the required proficiency level is Intermediate High.\n\nFor category 3-4 modern languages (Indigenous languages such as Seneca and Tuscarora, those that use a non-Roman-based alphabet such as Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and Russian, and those that are character-based such as Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, and Vietnamese), the required proficiency level is Intermediate Mid.\n\nFor classical languages (those from an earlier time in human history that have no living native speakers such as Latin and ancient Greek), the required proficiency level is Intermediate High for Interpretive Reading.\n\nCulminating Projects are presented by the student in the language being assessed to a panel of at least two qualified adult speakers of the language. Panelists may include classroom teachers, other faculty and staff, and community members. Students present their projects and then the panel interviews the students in the language being assessed.\n\nProjects are evaluated using a rubric that is aligned with ACTFL proficiency levels. NYSED has created sample rubrics for each of the language categories that schools may use to evaluate student work.\n\nRubric for category 1-2 modern languages (those that use a Roman-based alphabet such as Spanish, French, Italian, German): Full-size rubric (multiple pages), Condensed rubric (one page)\n\nRubric for category 3-4 modern languages (indigenous languages such as Seneca and Tuscarora; those that use a non-Roman-based alphabet such as Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and Russian; those that are character-based such as Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, and Vietnamese): Full-size rubric (multiple pages), Condensed rubric (one page)\n\nSample rubric for classical languages (those from an earlier time in human history that have no living native speakers such as Latin and ancient Greek): Full-size rubric (multiple pages), Condensed rubric (one page)\n\nAlternatively, schools may develop their own rubrics, which must be submitted to NYSED for approval with the NYSSB School Notification Form in December of each year. In order to be approved, school-based rubrics must meet the criteria established by NYSED based on the following essential questions:\n\nIs proficiency in the language being assessed the only aspect that is assessed on the school’s Culminating Project rubric?\n\nAre the column headings of the school’s Culminating Project rubric labeled with ACTFL proficiency levels?\n\nAre the performance descriptors in the school’s Culminating Project rubric aligned to ACTFL proficiency levels?\n\nDoes the school’s Culminating Project rubric indicate the proficiency level required to earn the NYSSB?\n\nDoes the school’s Culminating Project rubric separately address all three modes of communication (interpretive, interpersonal, presentational)?\n\nRubric used by NYSED to evaluate school-based rubrics\n\nSchool Visits\n\nEach year, the Office of Bilingual Education and World Languages (OBEWL) will schedule visits with a small sample of schools offering the NYSSB for two purposes: (1) to observe and participate in Culminating Project Presentations and (2) to provide feedback and support to schools in this process. The Culminating Project Notification form is used to notify the New York State Education Department (NYSED) of the date(s), time(s), location(s), and language(s) of these presentations so that a visit may be scheduled. Click here to access the form that will be used to provide feedback and support to schools following the visit.\n\nOnly schools that have been notified by NYSED of their selection for a visit should complete this form. Notification of selection will take place no later than September 30th. This form can be submitted as soon as a school is notified of their selection for a visit, but must be submitted at least four weeks prior to dates of the student presentations.\n\nClick here to access the online NYSSB Culminating Project Notification Form."
