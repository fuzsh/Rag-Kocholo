        "text": "222.6K\n\nYou know that friend you have who speaks three languages fluently—effortlessly even? They probably also get eight hours of sleep every night, never misplace their keys, and hit the gym without fail every morning at 5 a.m., but that’s besides the point.\n\nIt’s okay to not be that person! For most people, language learning is deeply fulfilling, fun, and a bit challenging. It takes time, discipline, and a well of motivation that you’ll need to refill. That’s why knowing the language difficulty ranking in relation to your native tongue can be useful.\n\nLanguage difficulty rankings exist so you can set the fluency goal posts at a realistic distance. In this guide, we’ll take a look at the easiest languages and hardest languages to learn, the factors that determine language difficulty, and a complete ranking of the world’s most widely spoken languages—including how long they take to learn.\n\nMost widely-spoken languages by category\n\nWith over 7,000 languages spoken across the globe, it’s difficult to rank them all. The below language difficulty charts capture languages spoken by the majority of the world’s population.\n\nThe Foreign Service Institute includes time estimates alongside difficulty rankings, but it’s important to note that everyone’s language goals are different. The time estimates here reflect how long it would take the average person to reach a Level 3 proficiency level, which is pretty fluent by most standards.\n\nIf your goals align more with a Level 1 or 2 proficiency, you may be able to learn a language even faster.\n\nCategory I languages\n\nIt takes approximately 24-30 weeks (600-750 hours of practice) to reach professional working proficiency in these languages. They are very closely related to English, so many of the same grammar rules and similar vocabulary apply.\n\nDanish\n\nDutch\n\nFrench\n\nItalian\n\nNorwegian\n\nPortuguese\n\nRomanian\n\nSpanish (Latin America or Spain)\n\nSwedish\n\nCategory II languages\n\nIt takes approximately 36 weeks (900 hours of practice) to obtain professional working proficiency in these five languages. Though German is in the same family as English, its nuanced pronunciation gives it a higher difficulty level than other Germanic languages.\n\nGerman\n\nHaitian Creole\n\nIndonesian\n\nMalay\n\nSwahili\n\nCategory III languages\n\nApproximately 44 weeks (1,100 hours of practice) is what you need to reach professional working proficiency in these languages. You’ll notice that many languages in the below language difficulty chart do not use the Latin alphabet.\n\nCategory IV languages\n\nYou’ll need approximately 88 weeks (2,200 hours of practice) to reach professional working proficiency in the below languages. These hardest languages to learn are ranked as such because they’re deeply nuanced, with complex grammar and pronunciation rules. Don’t let their place on this list deter you from diving right in, though—we’ve built courses to help you learn quickly and effectively!\n\nArabic\n\nChinese (Cantonese)\n\nChinese (Mandarin)\n\nJapanese\n\nKorean\n\nHow is language difficulty ranking determined?\n\nDetermining language difficulty requires a bird’s eye view of how languages relate to each other. The Foreign Service Institute is a reliable industry expert here. With over 70 years of experience teaching languages to US government employees, it has compiled a comprehensive and widely accepted list of language rankings.\n\nThe criteria is largely tied to the average length of time it takes a student to learn a language, along with several other components that affect difficulty levels.\n\nLinguistic distance\n\nIn French, “the flower” translates to “la fleur.” In Spanish, it’s “la flor,” and in Italian, it’s “il fiore.” Coincidence? Hardly.\n\nWhen we talk about linguistic distance, we’re referring to the fundamental differences between languages and how or where they’ve evolved from. Spanish, French, and Italian are all descendants of Latin and have many similarities. To see languages that are closely related, it helps to dive into the world of language families, or groups of languages that all share the same mother language.\n\nIn contrast to the similarities between the Romance languages listed above, German and Mandarin—two languages of different families with entirely unique writing systems—couldn’t be more linguistically distant.\n\nThe takeaway here is that the farther your native language is from the language you’re learning, the more challenging you may find your new language to learn.\n\nGrammar\n\nIn English, it’s acceptable to say that you “bought five books.” But to translate that same statement into Mandarin, you’ll need a measure word. Like a pack of wolves or a tank of gas, “books” in Mandarin requires the word běn to indicate a unit of five books. This is just one example of unique grammar rules that don’t exist in other languages.\n\nGrammar can be tricky, even in your native language. If you’re looking for ease of learning, finding a language with familiar or easy-to-master grammar rules can help you tone down the language difficulty level.\n\nPronunciation\n\nSchlittschuhlaufen. That’s German for “ice skating.” German is often known for its hard-to-master accent and enthusiastically long vocabulary. It’s also ranked as one of the easier languages to master, as you’ll see in the list below. What’s the logic there?\n\nGerman and English belong to the same Germanic language family, so their linguistic closeness wins out. And while mastering a German accent can be tricky, most speakers will understand what you’re saying through the missteps.\n\nWhen it comes to pronunciation, the real difficulty factor comes into play for tonal languages. These languages, which include Vietnamese and Mandarin, require correct pronunciation and inflection to create meaning for each word. Mandarin’s four distinct tones give the same word ma four very different meanings.\n\nWriting system\n\nAs an English speaker, you’ll encounter three types of writing systems:\n\nLanguages that use the same Latin alphabet as English\n\nLanguages that have their own unique alphabets\n\nLanguages based on unique writing systems\n\nLanguages that fall in the first category are often the easiest languages to learn. Because you’re already familiar with the alphabet, you have an understanding of characters and most letter sounds. If that’s the case, strengthening your reading and writing skills in that language takes far less time.\n\nThe languages in the second category are moderately challenging. You’ll need to learn an entirely new alphabet, and memorize their corresponding letter sounds.\n\nStill, some languages lack traditional alphabets. Mandarin, for example, has a logosyllabic writing system in which characters match distinct syllables in each word. These are the most difficult to learn, as new learners will find that learning through listening is much more accessible than learning through text (though Pinyin is changing the way learners approach the language).\n\nUsing language difficulty ranking for language learning\n\nThere’s no set timeline for how long it takes to learn a language, but language difficulty rankings serve as guides on your journey.\n\nLearning a language is a marathon, not a sprint. It’s the last thing an eager language learner wants to hear, but it’s also incredibly valuable information. Knowing this makes it easier to stay motivated and disciplined and keep your eye on the prize—your personal language goals—at all times."
