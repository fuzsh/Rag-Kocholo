        "text": "So, I'm told, read a shoppe sign in London.\n\nWith all us Yanks coming into these forums during the last couple months, we've already experienced a few differences in our \"common\" language, and I'll be quick to add that those differences have been dealt with most graciously by all of us which is as it should be.\n\nSo, since we all have the best possible attitude about this, I thought I would open a thread for us to discuss the differences in \"our\" common language, and any other cultural differences that are separated by the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOne of the things that I like about UK English (I don't know how else to differentiate here) is spelling...the reversal of the letters \"e\" and \"r\" in some words, such as THEATER and THEATRE. I think that's classy. What are some other er/re words?\n\nI also like the adding of \"u\" following \"o\" in many words, such as COLOUR, ARMOUR, and LABOUR.\n\nWe also have differences in terminology (I think). You UK folks help me out here.\n\nIn America a hand-held battery operated illuminating device is a FLASHLIGHT.\n\nIn the US, when I leave my car's headlights on all night the battery goes DEAD. It's a DEAD battery.\n\nWhen I do periodic maintenance on my car, I open the HOOD and check the oil, water, and other fluids. I clean the WINDSHIELD, and make sure I have GAS in the tank.\n\nTwo people communicate with each other using hand-held radios called WALKIE TALKIES.\n\nLastly, I gotta ask a question I've wondered about for decades...\n\nWhat, exactly, is a crumpet?\n\nI welcome any questions anyone has about this side of the pond.\n\nfor Shoppe Read shop, no one i mean no one writes Shoppe any more, that way of spelling went out in the middle ages.\n\nIn Britain a hand-held battery operated illuminating device is a TORCH.\n\nIn the UK, when I leave my car's headlights on all night the battery goes FLAT. It's a FLAT battery.\n\nWhen I do periodic maintenance on my car, I open the BONNET and check the oil, water, and other fluids. I clean the WINDSCREEN, and make sure I have PETROL in the tank, and a spare tyre in the BOOT.\n\nwe drive on roads and walk on pavement.\n\nTwo people communicate with each other using hand-held radios called TWO WAY RADIO.\n\nLastly, I gotta ask a question I've wondered about for decades...\n\nWhat, exactly, is a crumpet? a round bread product flat on one side, lots of holes on the other eaten toasted with lots of butter.\n\nMy turn,\n\nDo not be offended if someone in Britain offers you a FAG, you smoke it.\n\nWe use a Mobile phone, not a Cell phone.\n\nwe do not sit on our FANNY's. it's a physical imposable for a WOMAN to do\n\nLastly, I gotta ask a question I've wondered about for decades...\n\nWhy do McDonald's sell English Muffins, I had never heard of a Muffin until i eat at McDonald's in Anaheim California.\n\nP.S. Core blimey love, :roll: we do not all talk like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. :roll:\n\nInteresting.If your batteries go flat...what do you call what happens to your tyres(tires)when they get a hole in 'em?Do they go dead?\n\nMuffins:\n\nDo y'all have cupcakes?The muffins I'm framiliar with are made in the same kind of pan used to make cupcakes except,instead of cake mix,a grain meal is used.I am also mystified about \"English Muffins\".Not only do they not resemble any muffin I've ever seen,but now they turn out not to be English.\n\nFor a good ole Southern boy,being refered to as \"Yank\" takes some gettin used to.We had a bit a trouble with them critters awhile back.\n\nI concur with Droneys diagnosis of our dialect however I would also add that Crumpet could also be 1/ sex e.g \"Im gonna get some crumpet\" 2/ a nice girl e.g \"Wow look at that bit of crumpet\".\n\nYes we do have some differences I mean you say Tomayto and I say Tomarto, you say Potayto and I say Potarto. Hee Hee :mrgreen:\n\nHey Doc I understand your point about the word \"Yanks\" however us brits are sometimes called \"Limeys\", now I have never worked on a sail ship and needed to suck limes to prevent scurvy. :mrgreen:\n\nPs a flat tyre is also a flat tyre :roll:\n\nWell, now...I've learned something!\n\nAlways wondered where the term \"Limey\" came from. Thanks, Webbie!\n\nDroney...you mean you people don't walk around wearing bowlers and carrying closed umbrellas and saying, \"Cheerio\", \"Pip-Pip\", and \"I say, old man!\"?? What a let-down! I'm disappointed!\n\nEnglish muffins are not English? I'm not surprised to hear it. I've been told that Danish pastries are not Danish, and that spaghetti is not Italian. Go figure! :?\n\nDidn't realize we \"Yanks\" were sensitive to that term. It's never bothered me any. I've always thought that term was what you Brits called us \"rebels\" during the Revolution. I could be wrong.\n\nWe don't use the spelling \"shoppe\" in every-day use, but you sometimes see it in a business name. We have a \"Coffee Shoppe\" here locally where I go regularly. The waitress is a bit of crumpet. :mrgreen:\n\nWhat is a \"quid\"? a \"farthing\"? I think farthing has something to do with money, as I've always heard it as \"not worth a farthing\".\n\nIn WW2 the American GIs called the Germans \"Krauts\"...I assume that comes from sauerkraut. What about the Brit term for a German soldier...\"Jerry\"? And the German term for a Brit soldier...\"Tommy\"?\n\nAnd I would guess from your post that the BOOT of a car is what we call the TRUNK?\n\na quid = money 1 british pound sterling.\n\na farthing = money 960 to the quid this is old money we stopped using the farthing in 1959?\n\nLesson old english money\n\nstarting with the lowest\n\na farthing = 1/4 of a penny\n\na half penny = 1/2 of a penny\n\na penny\n\nthen we use multiples\n\n3 Penny's = threepenny bit\n\n6 Penny's = sixpence (a tanner)\n\n12 Penny's = a shilling (sometimes called a BOB)\n\n24 Penny's = Two Shillings (two bob)\n\n30 Penny's = Half a crown (or 2 and six ie: two shillings and sixpence)\n\n120 Penny's = 10 shillings (or a ten bob note)\n\n240 Penny's= 1 pound (a quid)\n\nsimple see.\n\nThen in the 70's we scraped the lot and went decimalised\n\n.05 of a penny\n\n1 penny\n\n2.5 pence\n\n5 pence\n\n10 pence\n\n20 pence\n\n50 pence\n\n100 pence a pound (quid)\n\nderogatory names\n\nfor a german during WWII\n\nKraut from sauerkraut ( pickled cabbage )\n\nBox head from the old WWI steel helmet the one with two lug's on the side\n\nwith the armour plate hanging From the lugs, from a distance it looked like the german was wearing a box on his head.\n\nJerry i thing this comes from the 20Lt fuel/water cans (jerry cans)\n\nHun from the race of people that populated the germanic plains.\n\nTommy from the poem Tommy Atkins by Rudyard Kipling\n\n(i don't condone using these derogatory terms i have posted them as an\n\nexample of how the enemy is de humanised during conflicts)\n\nWell, now. That British monetary system is truly a hat full. I swear.\n\nFor a while, I would be poking a handful of money at merchants and praying that they take the right amount! :?\n\nUp until 1965 US paper money was backed by precious metals...either gold or silver. They were silver certificates or gold certificates (pre-1934).\n\nThen they took that away, and even took the silver out of our coins.\n\nThe result was what we called Lyndon Johnson's \"play money\".\n\nBack in the 19th century the US had some unusual denominations of coins. We had half-cent, a two-cent, a three-cent, and a twenty-cent coins.\n\nThe nickel 5-cent coin came into use in 1866, replacing the half-dime (eighteenth century spelling was \"half-disme\").\n\nI, too, do not know why derogatory names are created for enemy soldiers. I hate to think it, but I guess de-humanizing human beings makes it easier to kill them.\n\n\"Kraut\" is obviously derogatory, as is \"towel head\", and \"camel jockey\" referring to middle-easterners.\n\nI never thought of \"Tommy\" and \"Jerry\" as being derogatory, probably because here in the States those are common first names.\n\nBut...hey, I wasn't there, so I don't know what context they were used in.\n\nDid the German soldiers in WW1 and WW2 have a name for American GIs? Only one I've ever heard of is \"Amis\". French, I think.\n\nA farthing equals one fourth of a penny. 960 farthings to a pound. Well, if the farthing was a coin, then you could be listing 40 degrees to starboard and still have not much money in your pocket, eh? :mrgreen:\n\nDroney,\n\nThanks much for the hyperlink to the English coins! I was a coin collector when I was in my early teens, so that web page was MOST interesting!\n\nYour comments on current British paper money was interesting, because when US paper money was backed by silver (or gold) the notes said almost exactly the same thing...\"will pay to the bearer on demand\".\n\nThe US one dollar note stated that the US Government \"will pay to the bearer on demand ONE SILVER DOLLAR\". And we could, in fact, walk in to any US Federal Reserve building and demand payment (and receive) one silver dollar.\n\nI noted that most of the coins bore the image of King George VI.\n\nSo, here comes more questions! LOL! I just like learning new things about your country!\n\nKing George VI was the father of Queen Elizabeth II (current queen)...is that right? And his wife was the Queen Mum who recently passed on? And his brother was Edward VIII, who abdicated the throne to marry the American woman? I can't remember her name. And their father was KIng George V who was the reigning monarch during WW1? And all the monarchs I have mentioned thus far are known as the House of Windsor\"? And the House of Windsor began with which monarch?\n\nThe longest reigning monarch thus far is Queen Victoria? Is Queen Elizabeth close to this record at all? Queen Elizabeth has a sister...Margaret? The throne went to Elizabeth because she is the oldest?\n\nHope you don't mind the questions. And you others besides Droney please join in the discussion if you want.\n\nHouse of Normandy\n\n1066-1087 William I\n\n1087-1100 William II\n\n1100-1135 Henry I\n\n1135-1154 Stephen\n\nHouse of Plantagenet\n\n1154-1189 Henry II\n\n1189-1199 Richard I\n\n1199-1216 John\n\n1216-1272 Henry III\n\n1272-1307 Edward I\n\n1307-1327 Edward II\n\n1327-1377 Edward III\n\n1377-1399 Richard II\n\nHouse of Lancaster\n\n1399-1413 Henry IV\n\n1413-1422 Henry V\n\n1422-1461 Henry VI\n\nHouse of York\n\n1461-1483 Edward IV\n\n1483 Edward V\n\n1483-1485 Richard III\n\nHouse of Tudor\n\n1485-1509 Henry VII\n\n1509-1547 Henry VIII\n\n1547-1553 Edward VI\n\n1553-1558 Mary I\n\n1558-1603 Elizabeth I\n\nHouse of Stuart\n\n1603-1625 James I\n\n1625-1649 Charles I\n\n1649-1653 Commonwealth/protectorate\n\n1653-1658 Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell\n\n1658-1659 Protectorate of Richard Cromwell\n\nHouse of Stuart restored\n\n1660-1685 Charles II\n\n1685-1688 James II\n\n1689-1694 William and Mary (jointly)\n\nHouse of Orange\n\n1694-1702 William III (sole ruler)\n\n1702-1714 Anne\n\nHouse of Hanover\n\n1714-1727 George I\n\n1727-1760 George II\n\n1760-1820 George III\n\n1820-1830 George IV\n\n1830-1837 William IV\n\n1837-1901 Victoria *\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg\n\n1901-1910 Edward VII\n\nHouse of Windsor\n\n1910-1936 George V (a Saxe-Coburg until 1917) Note see below\n\n1936 Edward VIII (abdicated and married Mrs. Wallace Simpson)\n\n1936-1952 George VI\n\n1952- Elizabeth II *\n\n*Queen Victoria = 64 years\n\n*Queen Elizabeth = 51 Years\n\nthe name Saxe-Coburg was changed because we were at war with Germany and the name Saxe-Coburg is German so to seem patriotic the name was changed to Windsor (after the great park at Windsor).\n\nHope this helps Steve.\n\nPs\n\nHope you don't mind the questions.\n\nNo Not at all\n\nGreat info! Thanks!\n\nLooks like the Queen has about 13 years to go to equal Victoria's reign. That will make her...what...about 91 years old?\n\nLONG LIVE THE QUEEN!\n\nLooks like good old George III was the second longest reign...60 years.\n\nA couple more questions about money, please...\n\nBritish pound and British pound (sterling). Two kinds of pounds? Does \"sterling\" refer to sterling silver?\n\nThe symbol used to indicate pounds...I dont have that symbol on my keyboard. Does it have a particular meaning? It looks kind of like a fancy \"L\".\n\nThe \"dollar sign\" for US money was derived from the image on the Spanish Milled Dollar or \"Pillar\" dollar. The reverse design has two pillars with ribbons entwined around them which is where the dollar sign came from. Its designated value was 8 Reales.\n\nIt circulated widely in the colonies up until as late as 1850. It was often cut into 8 wedges, called \"bits\" (like cutting a pie), each wedge having a value of about 12.5 cents.\n\nLike your nickname for a shilling is \"bob\", our slang term for a US quarter dollar is \"two bits\", for a half dollar \"four bits\".\n\nHere is an image of a Spanish Milled Dollar:\n\nhttp://www.coincollecting.ch/catalog/prodimg/cat76/lot845.jpg\n\nRigger, I understand that one particular English expression which always causes problems, having no equivalent in the U.S. is 'fortnight', to us in the U.K., this means two weeks (fourteen nights, the usual length of a U.K. annual holiday).\n\nJust to confuse you further, in the U.K., we still (for now), have a unit of weight called a pound, shown lbs., 2240 to a ton. Maybe this is why what you were looking at mentioned £ Sterling, the monetary unit.\n\nWhen we Brits set out to confuse, we don't do it by halves!!!!\n\nDerrick."
