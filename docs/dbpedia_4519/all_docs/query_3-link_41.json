        "text": "The NCDPI Dual Language/Immersion (DL/I) Team provides a variety of professional learning opportunities designed for DL/I programs and also connects with other NCDPI teams and professional organizations to inform the work of K-12 DL/I programs.\n\nPlease see the information and links below to access DL/I professional learning for individual and local use.\n\nBook Studies\n\nThe DL/I Blue Book study is a self-paced Canvas course focused on Educating English Learners (ELs) for a Transformed World (2009) and Thomas and Collier's research about how their findings support DL/I programming for all students, including ELs in two-way immersion programs. Please use the information and links below to access and enroll in the self-paced DL/I Blue Book Study, and look for future offerings of book studies with other Thomas and Collier publications.\n\nIf you are a K-12 educator in NC Public Schools, use these step-by-step directions to enroll for 10 contact hours (or 1 CEU) in the HomeBase NCEES PD space.\n\nIf you are a K-20 educator who wants to adapt this course to offer locally within your instance of Canvas, is at a K-12 independent/private school, a community college, or a higher education organization, or lives in a different state or country, use these instructions to download or import the course, in whole or in part, from Instructure's Canvas Commons.\n\nConference Presentations\n\nThe NCDPI DL/I Team shares information about North Carolina's DL/I programs and work at state, regional, national, and international conferences. Feel free to explore the archived materials from these past presentations, including slides, handouts, hyperlinks, and notes. These materials can be used and/or adapted for local meetings and presentations, and they are available on the DL/I Conference Presentations document.\n\nLIS Learning Series\n\nThe LIS Learning Series is a K-12 professional development opportunity provided by the NCDPI Office of Academic Standards. It is statewide, cross-content-area professional learning on the Literacy Instruction Standards (LIS). The intent of this series is to support educators with integrating the LIS into standards-aligned content area instruction. These materials are also posted in the LIS Toolkit on the LIS-Based Professional Learning page.\n\nThe 2022 - 2023 LIS Learning Series featured broadcasts with various teams, including: English Language Arts (slides and recording), Math (slides and recording), Multilingual Learner (ML) Education (slides and recording), Science (slides and recording), and Social Studies (slides and recording).\n\nThere was also a selection of grade span webinars as part of the LIS Learning Series.\n\nElementary: Aligned Instruction - The LIS in PreK-5 (slides and recording) and Engaging Writers K-5 (slides and recording)\n\nSecondary: Improving Reading for Secondary Students (slides and recording) and Integrating the LIS - Content & Disciplinary Literacy 6-12 (slides and recording)\n\nAdditional content area teams will be part of the 2023 - 2024 LIS Learning Series, like the Utilizing the LIS in Arts Education (slides and recording)\n\nWebinar Series\n\nThe past DL/I webinar series were broadcasts that provided support related to implementing K-12 DL/I programs effectively. All educators (teachers, administrators, etc.) from existing or prospective K-12 DL/I programs, as well as post-secondary instructors, professors, and researchers, are welcome to explore the archived materials, including slides, handouts, hyperlinks, and recordings. These materials can be used and/or adapted for local professional development, and they are available in the Webinar Archives area in the Professional Learning section of the World Languages Resources Hub.\n\nThe focus of dual language/immersion (DL/I) programs is to help students become proficient in another language in addition to English. These students master subject content from other disciplines, using the DL/I program language or both languages.\n\nResearch in DL/I programs shows:\n\nAll students develop high levels of proficiency in the DL/I program language and English.\n\nAcademic performance of students is at or above grade level.\n\nStudents demonstrate positive cross-cultural attitudes and behaviors.\n\nPlease see the links below to the Standard Course of Study (SCOS) documents for language acquisition in DL/I programs.\n\nWorld Language Standards\n\nThe proficiency-based North Carolina World Language Essential Standards (WLES) were adopted by the North Carolina State Board of Education in September 2010 and implemented beginning in the 2012-2013 academic year.\n\nView the World Languages Content Standards and Support Documents\n\nDL/I programs are part of K-12 Dual & Heritage Languages in the WLES, which has several Instructional Toolkit components or support documents linked above, including these with information about DL/I program standards, K-12, for target language acquisition outcomes:\n\nCrosswalk comparing the former standards to the current WLES\n\nUnpacking Document for all K - 12 DL/I programs described in the WLES for different language types (alphabetic and logographic)\n\nMany DL/I secondary continuation programs design a language course sequence for students that includes Heritage Language and Modern Language courses, which are outlined in these Unpacking documents linked above:\n\nDual & Heritage Languages - Heritage Languages (formerly Native Speakers)\n\nModern Languages - High School, Levels I - VIII\n\nThe K-12 DL/I Bridging Document serves as a guide to help teachers and administrators create a strong K-12 sequence locally for the DL/I program language as students move from programs at the K-5 or K-8 levels and into Heritage Language and/or Modern Language courses for continuation at the secondary level.\n\nThe NCDPI World Languages Standard Course of Study & Supporting Resources page for additional details, and the World Languages Resources Hub at https://bit.ly/NCWLresources contains these resources and other tools, such as Administrator Guides and Clarifying Objectives by Course Outcomes (COCOs) documents, for administrators and teachers.\n\nEnglish Language Development Standards\n\n*Please note: The terms on this section of the page may alternate between \"English Learner\" (EL) and \"Multilingual Learner\" (ML). As of March 21, 2022, NCDPI shifted to using \"English Learner\" for policy and legislation purposes and \"Multilingual Learner\" for all other purposes. See this letter or watch this video for more details.\n\nThe NC English Language Development (ELD) Standard Course of Study is the WIDA English Language Proficiency Standards. The WIDA English Development (ELD) Standards represent the social, instructional and academic language students use to engage with peers, educators and the curriculum in schools.\n\nSupporting Multilingual Learners\n\nStakeholders have different areas of expertise and are often responsible for different aspects of educational planning and delivery; however, collectively, they are responsible for the success of MLs. Each teacher can contribute to deliver coordinated educational experiences for MLs according to their own qualifications and areas of expertise (WIDA 2020). To aid content area educators in supporting Multilingual Learners, please visit the NCDPI ML/Title III Team's ELD Standards Resource Hub, which can also be accessed via the short URL: https://bit.ly/ELDStandardsHub.\n\nEnglish Language Arts (ELA) Standards\n\nThe NC Standard Course of Study for English Language Arts defines what students should know and be able to do by the end of each grade level. These standards were adopted by the North Carolina State Board of Education in September 2017 and implemented beginning in the 2018-2019 academic year. More information can be found on the NC Standard Course of Study & Supporting Resources page.\n\nAdditional resources to support the implementation of the ELA standards can be located within each of the following ELA Repositories:\n\nELA Virtual Implementation Kit\n\nThe Virtual Implementation Kit (VIK) is a repository for all English Language Arts stakeholders. This repository provides a variety of resources for supporting administrators, educators, and parents during the implementation of the 2017 Standard Course of Study.\n\nELA Resources LiveBinder\n\nThe Resources LiveBinder provides an organized collection of PD Kits and stakeholder communications. This LiveBinder can be used to inform professional development or add clarity to current initiatives.\n\nELA: The Basics LiveBinder\n\nThe Basics LiveBinder guides teachers through two fundamentals of ELA instruction: the Standards and the texts. This step-by-step guide contains information and activities focused on understanding the standards and choosing appropriately complex texts.\n\nLiteracy Instruction Standards (LIS)\n\nOn October 7, 2021, the North Carolina State Board of Education approved the Literacy Instruction Standards (LIS) as outlined in Section V of SB 387: Excellent Public Schools Act of 2021. The LIS serve as a framework for the development and alignment of curriculum and instruction for all public schools. These standards are defined as a level of quality and equity to be used consistently within core literacy instruction statewide. While the NC Standard Course of Study (NCSCOS) sets student expectations, the LIS and their associated instructional practices set expectations for teaching literacy. The LIS are organized by grade-band and can be used to ensure that all teachers across North Carolina have a common understanding and delivery of literacy instruction.\n\nWhile the LIS have been developed by grade bands, they should be used in tandem with appropriate grade-level texts of increasing complexity in order for students to fully meet the demands of the NCSCOS. This LIS framework does not indicate an exhaustive list of literacy instruction practices and may not fully capture all instructional practices that have the potential to positively impact students' literacy achievement in K-12. New literacy research could modify and/or add to the instructional practices listed. More information can be found on the Literacy Instruction Standards page.\n\n* It is important to note that full implementation is expected by 2024-2025.\n\nAdditional resources to support the implementation of the LIS can be located on the Literacy Instruction Standards Toolkit (LIST) - a repository for all literacy stakeholders that provides a variety of resources for supporting administrators, educators, and parents during the implementation of the current LIS."
