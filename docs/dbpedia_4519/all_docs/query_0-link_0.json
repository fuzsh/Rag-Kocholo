        "text": "\"Two-bit\" is an idiom meaning cheap or petty. It comes from a slang term for the American eighth of a dollar, a \"bit.\" Even after the \"bit\" was phased out of the currency in 1792, the term \"two-bit\" persisted to refer to the quarter dollar.\n\nA two-bit person isn't worth much. From the Oxford English Dictionary under \"two, adj, n., and adv.\":\n\n1978 T. Willis Buckingham Palace Connection viii. 155 Some other two-bit General will try shooting us up.\n\nWhen applied to people or things, unless it is used ironically, it is a put-down or insult, implying cheapness or low quality.\n\nSo \"two-bit jerk\" may mean that the character isn't of much importance and he's a jerk (i.e. he's rude or crass)."
