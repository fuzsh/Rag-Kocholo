        "text": "Language is a vital part of human connection. Although all species have their ways of communicating, humans are the only ones that have mastered cognitive language communication. Language allows us to share our ideas, thoughts, and feelings with others. It has the power to build societies, but also tear them down. It may seem obvious, but if you’re asking yourself, why is language important? You’ll have to break it down to truly understand why.\n\nHow Does Language Affect Different Aspects of our Lives?\n\nLanguage is what makes us human. It is how people communicate. By learning a language, it means you have mastered a complex system of words, structure, and grammar to effectively communicate with others.\n\nTo most people, language comes naturally. We learn how to communicate even before we can talk and as we grow older, we find ways to manipulate language to truly convey what we want to say with words and complex sentences. Of course, not all communication is through language, but mastering a language certainly helps speed up the process. This is one of the many reasons why language is important.\n\nLanguage Is Important To Culture And Society\n\nLanguage helps us express our feelings and thoughts — this is unique to our species because it is a way to express unique ideas and customs within different cultures and societies.\n\nBy learning a foreign language, you can understand ideas and thoughts that may be different from your own culture. You can learn customs and how people interact in a given society. Language helps preserve cultures, but it also allows us to learn about others and spread ideas quickly.\n\nLanguage Is Important To Business\n\nThe importance of language in business is unmatched. Without language here, we can’t share ideas and grow them into something more. Whether this means learning a foreign language so you can share ideas with people who come from a different country, or simply learning how to use language to master an interview, demand presence in a room, or network with others, language is vital.\n\nLanguage Is Important For Individuals And Development\n\nHumans all learn to talk at slightly different times, and observing when a child starts to use language can be indicative of how well they are developing. But this does not just apply to babies. It also applies to young children learning a second language in school that’s different than the language they speak at home, adults learning a second language, or even those who may have lost language due to some type of accident, and are working on regaining it.\n\nLanguage Is Important For Personal Communication\n\nThough much of human communication is non-verbal (we can demonstrate our thoughts, feelings and ideas by our gestures, expressions, tones, and emotions) language is important for personal communication. Whether it’s being able to talk to your friends, your partner, or your family, having a shared language is necessary for these types of interactions.\n\nImage by Sasin Tipchai from Pixabay\n\nThe Basic Functions Of Language\n\nThe main function of language is the use of language. It gives us the ability to communicate thoughts, ideas, and feelings with others as quickly as possible. But, within that, we can understand language more by looking at its basic functions.\n\n1. Informative Function\n\nThe informative function of language is when we use language to communicate any information. Essentially, its function is to inform others by being able to state facts clearly.\n\n2. Expressive Function\n\nAnother basic function of language is the expressive function. As it sounds, it is used to express oneself by giving us ways to convey our feelings, emotions, and attitudes to another person (or ourselves).\n\n3. Directive Function\n\nThe directive function of language is a basic function that helps us to direct or command. For example, it gives us the ability to tell ourselves or someone else what to do in any given situation.\n\nDifferent Types Of Language\n\nLanguage comes in various forms, each playing a role in how we communicate.\n\nOral Vs. Written Language\n\nIn general, oral communication is spoken language meant for conversing with others. Written language is about expressing ideas through writing words down.\n\nOral communication is usually more informal and faster, while written language is more formal and slow.\n\nDenotative Meaning Vs. Connotative Meaning\n\nWords have a lot of meaning to them, and the meaning depends on the context surrounding the word. This is why there is denotative meaning and connotative meaning.\n\nDenotative meaning is the literal definition/intention of the word, whereas connotative meaning is when words carry positive or negative meanings/connotations. An example of this could be “home” versus “house.” “House” is denotative, being the literal term for this type of structure where someone may live, whereas “home” is connotative and represents a shelter, family, security, etc. Understanding the difference can help you understand the intention of language.\n\nSix Elements Of Language\n\nThere are six elements of language:\n\nClarity: Using language in a way that ensures the intended audience fully understands your ideas; that your ideas are clear.\n\nEconomy: Being ‘economic’ about how you speak by avoiding any unnecessary language. This means using only the necessary and appropriate words to express yourself while avoiding using language your audience won’t understand. Essentially, this means avoiding fluff or complicated vocabulary.\n\nObscenity: This refers to ‘indecent language’, including, but not limited to, curse words and hateful remarks.\n\nObscure Language/Jargon: This is very specific language that your audience will not understand because they are not familiar with what you are talking about. This could be when your car mechanic explains to you what’s wrong with your car, but you are not a car mechanic, so you are unclear of what they’re talking about.\n\nPower: This is when someone uses language to exert power over someone to manipulate them, command them, or to get them to do something they want. It could also be to demonstrate yourself as an authority in the room.\n\nVariety: This is a speaker’s ability to use a combination of all the different types of language aforementioned to successfully and creatively get ideas across.\n\nImage by Aline Dassel from Pixabay\n\nDifferent Language Styles\n\nWithin language, there are many different styles to fit what the speaker wants to communicate. While some are unique to a person’s personality, some speakers may adapt certain styles depending on the situation, even if it’s different from how they normally speak.\n\n1. Direct And Indirect Styles\n\nDirect is a way to use language to indicate to a person exactly what you want to say and/or how you’re feeling.\n\nIndirect language means using other words or types of communication to demonstrate you may be feeling a certain way, but without directly saying why or what, in other words, being indirect. If you’ve ever been in an argument with a significant other, you probably have experienced both of these language styles.\n\n2. Personal And Contextual Styles\n\nThese two language styles are a bit more complex. In general, personal style refers to an individual’s personal way of speaking, is informal, and focuses on that individual.\n\nContextual styles means changing language depending on the context of a situation. For instance, a professor may use their personal style of speaking with friends and colleagues, and a contextual style when lecturing their students.\n\n3. Untranslatable Words\n\nUntranslatable words are words or phrases that we have to adapt from other languages because we do not have a word that means the same thing in our own language. A good example is how we say “Bon Appetit!”, because we don’t have a good translation.\n\nUsing Language Effectively\n\nLanguage has so many benefits to humans, but it can also be problematic if language is used ineffectively. This is why it’s important to be mindful of how you are using language in any situation.\n\n1. Use Appropriate Language\n\nUsing appropriate language does not just mean avoiding obscene language (there may be times when that is actually appropriate for the situation!). It means using language that’s appropriate for your audience, that they can understand, relate to, and engage with.\n\n2. Use Vivid Language\n\nTo use vivid language is to use imagery in your language, to describe something as vividly as possible. It may mean using more adjectives or onomatopoeia to illustrate what you’re saying.\n\n3. Use Inclusive Language\n\nInclusive language means using language that does not exclude any person. For instance, instead of using “he or she” to address an audience, the correct term is “they” to include people who may not identify with a particular gender. It also means avoiding any language that is racist, sexist, misogynist, hateful, presumptuous, prejudiced, etc.\n\nConclusion\n\nLanguage connects us and helps us express ourselves. It influences culture, society, business, and personal growth. The six main elements of language each play a role in communication.\n\nBody language and listening skills are also key to effective interaction. As society evolves, so does language, reflecting new ways of thinking and interacting. Keep learning and adapting to stay connected and communicate effectively."
