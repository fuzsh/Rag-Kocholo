TWOBITS.com uses ebay as an advertising tool. We will routinely list an item from our inventory in order to expose the buying public to our catalog. People who search ebay for our niche products will quite often jump directly to our web page and buy the item rather than wait for the auction to end and risk being outbid. We try not to list the same items repeatedly, but to rotate through our most popular or newest products. If, as often happens, an auction winner wants to purchase additional items, they are invoiced at full price. Please feel free to browse our catalog by clicking the link below:\n\nhttp://www.Pac-man.com\n\nhot him a PM , I will Buy It Now For The Listed Price. It Never Sold On The Other Listing."
