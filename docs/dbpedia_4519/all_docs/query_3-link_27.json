        "text": "The Sounds of Language\n\nSounds are what language comes wrapped in. But not all sounds made by people are language. For example, people can’t say a sneeze. Or a burp. Burps and sneezes are sounds they can’t usually help. The sounds of language are those people want to make. They are sounds that carry a message.\n\nBits of Sound\n\nThere are strings of sound called sentences, strings of sound called words, strings of sound called syllables. Syllables are strings of vowel and consonant sounds. And the smallest bits of sound people recognize are vowels and consonants. But even vowels and consonants are strings of smaller sounds.\n\nStrictly speaking, no two language sounds are ever the same. But a person learns to ignore some differences between sounds, depending on his language. To a speaker of English, the sounds of p in pot and spot are alike. Actually, the first p is followed by a small puff of air. The second p isn’t. But whether or not the p is puffed, the meanings of pot and spot do not change. So in English, no one pays attention to the difference. In other languages, however—Northern Chinese, for instance—a puffed p may change the meaning of a word. So speakers of Northern Chinese learn to hear the difference.\n\nEnglish has one p sound. Northern Chinese has two—a puffed p and an unpuffed one. Such classes of sounds are called phonemes. A phoneme is the smallest bit of sound that may change meaning. Most often phonemes are vowels or consonants.\n\nPhonemes combine in patterns. And these patterns vary from language to language. In Spanish, for instance, the sp combination never begins a word. But many words in English begin with sp. So an English word like Spanish is difficult for a Spanish speaker to pronounce. Often a Spanish speaker will say Espanish.\n\nIn English the sound ng comes only at the end of a syllable—ring, ringer, ringworm. But in some languages of Africa, ng may begin a syllable as well as end a syllable. The last name of Kenyan novelist James Ngugi is an example.\n\nStrings of Sound\n\nMost phonemes have no meaning. But they form strings of sound that do. The smallest string of sound with meaning is called a morpheme. A morpheme can be what we call a word, or it can be a piece of a word. Take eater, in English. Eat is a morpheme—it can’t be broken down into anything smaller with meaning. The other morpheme is -er, meaning “someone who --s.” In eaters, there is still a third morpheme, -s, meaning “plural” or “more than one.”\n\nThe Trouble with Words\n\nIf eater is a word, eat is a piece of that word. But in anteater, eater is only a piece of a word. Of course, eater can be used as a word in English. So can eat and ant. So on that basis they might be called words. This would set them apart from morphemes like -er and -s, which are commonly used only as pieces of words.\n\nAll languages have what might be called words. But the nature of a word varies from language to language. For instance take Chukchi, a language spoken in Siberia. In Chukchi, the-big-reindeer-a-person-has-killed is one unit, one word. It can’t be broken up into smaller units the way it would be in English. There are many such words in Chukchi, Inuit, and other languages. In Northern Chinese, on the other hand, many syllables—and even parts of syllables—are what might be called words in English.\n\nBoundaries between words may shift or disappear in actual speech. In English, for instance, found it often comes out foun dit; don’t know becomes dunno; and so on. This is one of the things that makes it hard for people learning a second language to understand speakers of that language.\n\nSpoken Signals\n\nThe sounds of language include spoken signals. The voice rises and falls. It stresses some sounds. And it pauses between some sounds.\n\nSuch spoken signals may change meaning. In English, stress makes a difference between con′ tract and con tract′. A pause makes a difference between careless and care less. And pitch—the rise and fall of the voice—makes a difference between “Really?” and “Really.”\n\nIn languages such as English, pitch is added in a sentence. And it belongs to a place in the sentence, not to a word. Compare “Really?”; “Truly?”; “Honest?” The rising pitch goes with a certain place in that type of sentence. It doesn’t matter what the word is. In fact the same words will take different pitches in other sentences.\n\nBut in some languages, called tone languages, certain pitches belong to certain words. In Northern Chinese, for instance, chyan spoken in a level tone means “thousand.” In a rising tone it means “money”; in a dipping tone, “shallow”; in a falling tone, “owe.” In such languages, the same pitches and the same words always go together.\n\nThe Meaning of Language\n\nLanguage is, above all, meaning. Meanings are attached to pieces of words, to words, or to groups of words. Meanings are attached to the spoken signals of language. Meanings are attached to the shifts and changes of grammar.\n\nMeaning and No Meaning\n\nThe sounds of words have no meaning to begin with. People attach a meaning to them.\n\nEvery day someone thinks up a new word. Or someone uses an old word in a new way. Someone might suddenly say, “Hey, that’s like zonko, you know? Boy, that’s totally zonko!” If no one pays much attention, that’s the end of zonko. But maybe friends and other people begin to use the word, too—“Wow! Zonko!” Then another word has been born.\n\nMeaning More or Less\n\nSome words have more of what might be called outside meaning than others. Orange, for instance, means “a reddish-yellow color, a fruit,” etc. But it also means tigers and sunsets and excitement—meanings outside the dictionary definitions. Words like the, and, to have little outside meaning. They are sometimes called function words (see grammar).\n\nMuch-repeated words may mean less after a while. Clichés are an example. A cliché is an expression that loses its punch through overuse. Used sparingly, “That’s really great!” may get a listener’s special attention. If it’s used too often, however, it does not mean much to most listeners.\n\nCommon expressions of courtesy often lose meaning. Chances are that a casual acquaintance who asks “How are you?” doesn’t really want to know.\n\nSame and Different Meaning\n\nFew words have exactly the same meaning. Not only are the Burmese and Arabic words for “house” different, they mean different things to a Burmese villager and a desert Arab.\n\nReturn and take back are much alike in English. But like all synonyms they do not always mean the same. There’s a world of difference between “We took Ralphie back to the monkey house” and “We returned Ralphie to the monkey house.” But in practice, speakers accept certain words as more or less the same. This helps them communicate more easily.\n\nThe same word often has different meanings, depending on how it’s used with other words. In English, go can mean “leave,” as in the phrase “Please don’t go”; “work,” as in “My watch won’t go”; and “reach,” as in “It doesn’t go far enough.” Homonyms, or homophones, like bear and bare are more or less the same word to a listener. It’s how they’re used with other words that gives them different meanings.\n\nNot only do the same words have different meanings; the same groups of words often do. “She drove into the bank this morning” is an example. Was it a drive-in bank? Or did she zig when she should have zagged? Or what? The surrounding sentences will give clues to the meaning.\n\nA phrase or clause doesn’t always mean the same as its words. Idioms are an example. Another example is the way the words are spoken. “Oh, sure I will!” in a sarcastic tone means something very different from what the words say.\n\nWays of Meaning\n\nA word commonly has different ways of meaning. What a word refers to is only one way it means. Thus, the word prunes refers to a food. But much of the meaning of words has to do with the speaker’s attitude. So the meaning of prunes depends also on how the speaker feels about them. The word has a pleasant meaning if the speaker likes them, an unpleasant meaning if he or she doesn’t.\n\nThe meaning a word refers to is its denotation. What a word suggests because of the speaker’s or listener’s attitude is its connotation.\n\nLanguages have different ways of separating meaning. The Inuit language has separate words for falling snow and snow on the ground, while English uses only one word for both—snow. Shona, a language of Zimbabwe, has three words for all the colors. One word means “red, purple, orange.” Another means “white, yellow, green.”\n\nSocial Meaning\n\nPeople don’t usually talk to themselves. They talk to other people. And their talk has social meaning.\n\nOnly part of the social meaning of a conversation is carried by words. Take saying hello or talking about the weather. Often such talk has little dictionary meaning. It is a way of being friendly or polite.\n\nChoice of language often has social meaning. An informal “Yeah” in the neighborhood carries a relaxed meaning. Often it is replaced by a formal “Yes” in a classroom or at a job interview.\n\nSpanish-speaking Americans often switch from Spanish at home to English in the classroom. The same principle applies to other bilingual students. Use of special work words may mean a speaker is an architect or plumber or foundry worker. In many countries, the words a speaker uses label him a member of the upper or lower classes.\n\nSwear words have social meaning. So do expressions using God’s name in vain. The same goes for conversation about such things as using the toilet. Usually these are no-no’s, and they have that meaning attached to them.\n\nGrammatical Meaning\n\nSome meanings attach to words. These are dictionary meanings. And some meanings, called grammatical meanings, attach to the signals of grammar.\n\nThe form a word takes may have grammatical meaning. In English, -s or -es added to a noun means “plural” or “more than one.” A mashita ending on a Japanese verb means “past tense.”\n\nWord order may have grammatical meaning. Take the English sentence “Mary bit John.” In English, the common order for statements is subject-verb-direct object. So Mary means “subject,” and John means “direct object.” It’s Mary who does the biting, John who gets bitten.\n\nFunction words have grammatical meaning. In English, the or a means that a noun is coming up. Quién (who) at the beginning of a Spanish sentence means that the sentence is a question.\n\nSpoken signals can have dictionary meaning. Pitch in the words of tone languages is an example. But spoken signals can also have grammatical meaning. In English, for example, stress on sus- in suspect signals that the word is a noun. Stress on -spect, on the other hand, means “verb.” At the end of a clause, a drop in pitch with a fading into silence commonly means “statement.”\n\nThe Trouble with Translation\n\nThe words of one language seldom mean the same as the words of another. Take the Russian “Ja govorila.” It can be translated into English as “I said.” But the meanings are not exactly the same. The verb govorila tells a Russian speaker that “I” is a female, and that “I” spoke more than once or hadn’t finished speaking. Neither of these meanings is carried by the English words.\n\nIn some cases, the same word may not have the same meaning in two different languages. English borrowed the word sputnik from Russian. It means “artificial satellite.” But in Russian, the word also means “fellow-traveler” and “guide.” So sputnik in English does not mean the same as sputnik in Russian.\n\nA translation, at best, conveys something similar to the original language. It tries to transfer meanings from one language to another. But different words and different mechanics of language must be used. Take the Japanese “Musukosan wa hebi wo tabemashita.” Word by word this reads, “Your son + wa + snake + wo + ate.” But that’s not a translation. Wa and wo have no dictionary meaning, only grammatical meaning—wa comes after a subject, wo after a direct object. So wa and wo are dropped in translation. This leaves us with the translated phrase, “Your son snake ate.” But in English the direct object (snake) should follow the verb (ate). So the words must be switched around to read “Your son ate snake.” That’s still not comfortable English, though. Japanese has no word for a, so it must be added. The result is “Your son ate a snake.” But even that doesn’t carry over all the meanings of the original Japanese phrase. Musukosan, for instance, has a meaning of respect that is missing in the English your son. Just the same, it’s a good translation. And it is important to note that a Japanese speaker trying to translate “Your son ate a snake” from English into Japanese faces the same problems in reverse.\n\nA translation doesn’t usually take the same form as the original. Sometimes a noun can be translated by a noun, and a phrase can be translated by a phrase. But it doesn’t work that way very often. The German phrase “Guten Tag” means “Good day,” but it’s better translated as “Hello”—people don’t usually say “Good day” in English. The French phrase s’il vous plaît (if it pleases you) is better translated in English as please.\n\nAs we can see, the idea of only one correct translation leads to problems. For instance, the Italian “La casa è a Sua disposizione” can be translated as “The house is at your disposal” or perhaps as “Make yourself at home.” It is both a matter of choice and a matter of style. Much depends on the circumstances—for example, whether the words were used in a formal or informal way.\n\nWhen computers are used to translate material, the result is called machine translation. A computer can work much faster than a human in looking up a word. But the machines have many problems. They have trouble identifying the same sounds made by different people. Sometimes different sounds are spelled with the same letters. For example, compare the sounds of the s in cats and in dogs. Computers have trouble distinguishing those sounds. And computers have much trouble with meaning—words with different possible meanings, sentences with different possible meanings.\n\nA computer is only as good as the information put into it. And that’s the heart of the machine translation problem. No one has all the answers to how any language works.\n\nKinds of Language\n\nPeople speak many kinds of language. There is the language of different places, and there is the language of different groups.\n\nLanguage and Dialect\n\nA speaker of Arabic and a speaker of Malay have different speech habits and don’t understand one another’s speech. A speaker from the Tennessee hills and a speaker from Chicago have different speech habits too. But they can pretty much understand each other. Arabic and Malay are called languages. Chicagoese and Tennessee mountainese are called dialects. A dialect is a variety of a language.\n\nThe line between languages and dialects is not always clear. Dialects are sometimes called languages, and languages are sometimes called dialects. Northern Italians and Sicilians commonly do not understand each other’s speech. Yet both speak so-called dialects of Italian. Danish and Norwegian are called different languages. Yet Danes and Norwegians pretty well understand one another.\n\nA country’s boundaries can be marked on a map. But language boundaries can’t be readily distinguished—at least, not in the same way. A line between two languages would mean everyone on one side of the line spoke one language. It would also mean everyone on the other side of the line spoke another language. But language just doesn’t work that way.\n\nFor one thing, some people use two or more languages. French and English are spoken by many Canadians, especially by those living in Quebec. Quite a few Swiss can speak both German and French. Many people of Paraguay are fluent in both Spanish and Guarani, an Amerindian language. Quite a number of Israelis understand Hebrew, Yiddish, and a European language, such as Russian.\n\nFor another thing, languages have dialects. And often the dialects of one language merge into the dialects of a neighbor language. Take French and Italian. Anyone going from Paris to Naples can hear small language differences between each town and the next. At no point can a sharp line be drawn. Yet the French of Paris and the Italian of Naples are different languages.\n\nThe Difference in Dialect\n\nDifferences in speech habits are what make dialects. Speakers pronounce words differently. They use different words for the same thing. And they sometimes put words together in different ways.\n\nA London cockney will say ’arry for Harry, ’orrible for horrible. Hot dog, frankfurter, wiener, and red hot are all words for the same thing in the United States. “Goin’ git me some” and “I’m going to get some” are two ways of saying much the same thing. Each way of pronouncing words, of using words, is right for a particular dialect. No dialect is better or worse than another—only different.\n\nAll Kinds of Dialects\n\nStrictly speaking, no two people have exactly the same dialect. Every speaker pronounces at least some words a little differently from everyone else.\n\nProbably no two persons know exactly the same set of words. Everyone puts his words together in his own ways. And to complicate matters, a person’s dialect is always changing.\n\nJust the same, there are patterns of dialect. People in certain neighborhoods, certain cities, certain regions speak a lot alike—even if there are some differences. Many New Yorkers have a way of speaking that sets them apart. The speech of most people from the Southern United States is also distinctive. American English is distinct from Australian English, which is distinct from the British English spoken in England. Such dialects, spoken by people of different places, might be called geographical dialects.\n\nAnother type of dialect is the social dialect. Social dialects are spoken by people of different groups. In many countries, people in high society speak differently from working-class people. People who work together—astronauts, doctors, social workers, auto mechanics—often share special work words, a sort of shop talk. The language of older people often is not the same as that of the young.\n\nIn many places one dialect has more social standing than the others. Often it becomes the language of government and is taught in the schools. Such a dialect is called a standard dialect. Take the dialect of Paris. Originally it was one of many dialects spoken in what is now France. As Paris became a center for government and culture, the Parisian dialect became relatively more important. Now it is the standard French dialect.\n\nAll people have more than one dialect. Dialects depend on where people live, what groups they move with, their education, and so on. For instance, a Tokyo engineer from Kyoto might use his own Kyoto dialect at home but would speak the standard dialect of Tokyo while at work. His speech would differ in some ways from that of his wife. And it would differ from that of his teenage son. With other engineers he would use a kind of engineering shop talk. Such switching from one dialect to another is common.\n\nPeople also have more than one way of using their dialects. There is a relaxed way, such as the way one speaks with friends, for instance. And there is a formal way of talking, such as the way you would talk to a job interviewer.\n\nStandard Languages\n\nLanguage has no boundaries. Speakers of the same language may live in many countries. And every country has many languages. But often, one of the languages of a country is chosen as the standard language. And this is the language taught in the schools and used for official business. The standard language is used for easier communication. It is also used to unite the people of a country.\n\nIn France, for instance, the standard language is French. But not all French people speak French. There are German speakers in Alsace-Lorraine, Breton speakers in Brittany, and Basque speakers in the Pyrenees mountains. In southern France the Provençal dialects are so different from standard French that they can be considered a separate language.\n\nOften a standard language does make communication easier. French is taught in all the schools of France, so most French people can get through to each other. For instance, a Basque speaker can use French to talk to a Breton speaker. A standard language can also help give speakers of different languages a feeling of oneness. An example is Modern Hebrew, the standard language of Israel.\n\nThe trouble is, a standard language doesn’t always work the way it’s supposed to. There are no first-class or second-class languages. But because a standard language is the official language, it often has a higher social standing. And nonstandard languages are often considered less important, and may even be looked down upon. In such instances, nonstandard speakers learn the standard language only if they have to. And even then they resent it. The resentment may take the form of not learning it well—just enough to get by. Or they may simply refuse to learn it at all.\n\nSome countries have more than one standard language. Belgium uses French and Flemish. Canada uses French and English. Switzerland has three standard languages—French, Italian, and German. India has two standard languages—Hindi and English—but more than 20 ethnic languages are also widely spoken.\n\nProblems arise because one language is—or seems to be—more favored than another. In Belgium, Flemish speakers have protested the favored position of French. In India, many have protested the favored position of Hindi. Problems also arise because most people in most places use only one language. So unless all a country’s languages are taught in the schools, which usually isn’t practical, most people can’t understand speakers of another language.\n\nIn some countries, an outside language is sometimes chosen as a standard language. Take Ghana. Its people speak perhaps 50 or more languages. So English was adopted as an official language. And it was used for teaching in the schools.\n\nSecond Languages\n\nMost people speak only their first language—the language learned in the home. But many also learn a second language. There are several kinds of second languages. One kind is the language of the other speaker. When a Basque speaker uses French to talk to a French speaker, for instance, he or she is using the other speaker’s language.\n\nBut sometimes speakers of different languages don’t use the language of the other speaker. They use a third language. Such a language is sometimes called a lingua franca. A speaker of Telugu from southern India and a speaker of Hindi from northern India may talk to each other in English. Then English is being used as a lingua franca. A Ukrainian speaker and a Sakha speaker from Siberia may use Russian as their common language. In that case, Russian is their lingua franca.\n\nAnother kind of second language is a pidgin language. Pidgins are often used for brief contacts between people—between two traders, say. A pidgin is a sort of hybrid of both the speakers’ languages. But the vocabulary is greatly reduced. And the way words fit together is greatly simplified.\n\nThe first known Pidgin English was used by English speakers and Native Americans. Russonorsk was a pidgin of Russian and Norwegian used by Russian and Norwegian fishermen for roughly a hundred years before World War I. A pidgin of Dutch and Malay, known as Bazaar Malay, was used in the Dutch East Indies. Bahasa Indonesia, the official language of Indonesia, is based on Bazaar Malay.\n\nSometimes a pidgin becomes the first language of a group of speakers. When this happens, it becomes known as a creole language. In the Caribbean, African slaves from the same tribe were often separated. This was done to reduce the danger of revolt. So the slaves on a plantation had no common language. They could only talk to each other in a pidgin of their owner’s language—such as Pidgin French or Pidgin Spanish. In time the slaves married and had children. The children learned the pidgin as their only language. At that point, their language was a creole language.\n\nGullah is a creole language. It is spoken on and near the Sea Islands off Georgia. Louisiana Creole is a French-based language. Another French-based creole is Haitian Creole, the language of Haiti. Speakers of Louisiana Creole and Haitian Creole commonly understand each other. Jamaican Creole is an English-based language of Jamaica. So-called Hawaiian Pidgin English is actually a creole language. It is the speech of a large number of people brought up in the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nInterlanguages\n\nThe Old Testament tells of a time when there was one world language. It tells of how Nimrod ruined it all by building a tower to reach Heaven, and how the Lord made the workmen speak different languages. So the Tower of Babel was never finished.\n\nThe idea of a world language, or interlanguage, is very old. Hundreds have been invented. But few have received much attention. The first one to become well known was Volapük. It was introduced by a Bavarian clergyman, Johann Martin Schleyer, in 1880. Schleyer based his language mostly on German and English, with many words also from languages like Latin—French, Italian, Spanish, and so on. The name Volapük meant “world speech.”\n\nVolapük was popular in Europe for a while, but it didn’t last. For one thing, some of its sounds were difficult for non-German speakers. The ü sound in Volapük is an example. For another thing, the way its words fit together was complicated. Volapük went out of use shortly after the invention of another—and simpler—interlanguage, Esperanto.\n\nEsperanto is probably the best-known interlanguage. It was introduced in 1887 by a Polish doctor, L.L. Zamenhof. The name Esperanto is based on a word for “hope.” Zamenhof felt that language was at the root of problems between people. He believed a world language would bring peace and understanding.\n\nEsperanto is based mostly on languages like French, Italian, and Spanish, with a number of words also from German and Greek. Both the sounds and the mechanics of the language are fairly simple—for most Europeans. Esperanto is used in many countries. Schools teach it, and books are published in Esperanto.\n\nThe trouble with world languages is that in actuality, they’re not spoken worldwide. Mostly they are made for speakers of English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and a number of related languages. A speaker of Northern Chinese, for instance, would have as much trouble with Esperanto as with French or German. The same is true of a speaker of Inuit or a speaker of Tamil, a language of southern India. Esperanto ignores the sounds and mechanics and meanings of most of the world’s languages.\n\nAnother problem with world languages has to do with language change. Suppose Esperanto, say, were adopted as a world language. It would soon be spoken in many different dialects. For one thing, people have different speech habits. For another thing, language is always changing. Dialects of people far apart would become more and more different. This would be especially true of people in remote places, people having little or no contact with speakers of other dialects. It would probably also be especially true of people who felt that Esperanto was not “their” language, that it represented the languages of other people. Given time enough, resistance or resentment enough, and separation enough, speakers of different dialects would no longer be able to understand one another. And a new interlanguage would have to be invented all over again.\n\nRelated Languages\n\nLanguages have dialects. And some of those dialects grow so far apart that they become languages. And the new languages separate into dialects. And some of those become languages. Such related languages are called a language family.\n\nIndo-European\n\nThe family to which English belongs is the Indo-European family. It consists of many groups of languages. The Germanic, or Teutonic, group includes the Scandinavian languages—Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Icelandic. German is commonly divided into High German and Low German. High German includes the dialects of southern Germany, the dialects of Austria, and the German dialects of Switzerland. Dutch, Flemish (spoken in Belgium), and the dialects of northern Germany make up Low German. Afrikaans, an offshoot of Dutch, is spoken in South Africa. English, which is also a Germanic language, is closely related to Dutch. But even closer to English is Frisian, spoken mostly in the northern Netherlands. Yiddish, a language of the Jewish people, is for the most part a High German of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Romance group of languages descended from Latin. After the Roman Empire fell apart, the Latin dialects of the different regions grew farther and farther apart. Best known of the Romance languages are French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian. Provençal, a name for the dialects of southern France, is sometimes considered a separate language. Catalan is spoken mostly in eastern Spain. Romansh is spoken in Switzerland.\n\nThe Balto-Slavic group consists of the Baltic languages and the Slavic languages. Lithuanian and Latvian (or Lettish) are Baltic languages. The Slavic languages include Russian, spoken in Russia; Ukrainian, spoken in Ukraine; and Belarusian (or White Russian), spoken in Belarus. Czech and Slovak, spoken in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, are closely related. Indeed they might be called varieties of the same language. Serbo-Croatian is one language written in two alphabets—Croatian in Roman letters, Serbian in the Cyrillic alphabet. It is spoken chiefly in Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other Slavic languages include Polish and Bulgarian. (See also writing.)\n\nThe Celtic group of languages, once spoken over a large territory, today is used only in the British Isles and northwestern France. The number of speakers is small. Irish Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic are Celtic languages. Welsh, spoken in Wales, and Breton, a language of Brittany in northwestern France, form another branch of Celtic.\n\nThe Indo-Iranian group consists of Indic languages and Iranian languages. Persian (or Farsi) is an Iranian language. So are Pashto (or Pushtu), spoken in Afghanistan and Pakistan; and Kurdish, spoken in Kurdistan. Balochi, spoken mostly in Pakistan and Iran, also is an Iranian language. Sanskrit is an Indic language. It is the oldest living Indo-European language, and is now used chiefly as the sacred language of Hinduism. Hindi, the leading language of northern India, and Urdu, the national language of Pakistan, are also Indic languages. Both Hindi and Urdu are varieties of the same language. But Urdu has more Persian and Arabic words and is written with a different alphabet. Other Indic languages include Bengali, Panjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Rajasthani, Bihari, Kashmiri, Oriya, Sindhi, Assamese, and Nepali. Sinhalese, spoken in Sri Lanka, is also an Indic language. And so is the Romany language of the Rom people, a group formerly referred to as Gypsies.\n\nGreek belongs in a separate language group within the Indo-European family. The same is true of Armenian and of Albanian. An Indo-European language called Tocharian was once spoken in what is now Xinjiang, China. The language of the Hittites, a people who inhabited Anatolia in ancient times, was also Indo-European.\n\nUralic\n\nThe Uralic language family has two main groups: Finno-Ugric and Samoyed. Of the Finno-Ugric group, the best-known Ugric language is Hungarian (called Magyar in the language itself). Finnish, Estonian, and Lapp are the best-known Finnic languages. Sami, or Lapp, is the language of the Sami people of Lapland and is spoken mostly in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Two other Finnic languages, Mordvin and Cheremis, are spoken in Russia. The Samoyed languages are spoken in Siberia.\n\nAltaic\n\nThe Altaic family is commonly divided into three main groups: Turkic, Mongolian, and Manchu-Tungus (or Manchurian). Turkish is the best-known Turkic language. Other Turkic languages include Azerbaijanian, spoken in Azerbaijan; Uzbek, spoken in Uzbekistan; Kazakh, spoken in Kazakhstan; Tatar, spoken in Russia; Kyrgyz, spoken in Kyrgyzstan; and Turkmen, spoken in Turkmenistan. Azerbaijanian is also spoken in Iran. Another Turkic language, spoken mostly in what is now Xinjiang, China, is Uighur. Sakha, spoken in Siberia, is also a Turkic language. The Mongolian group of languages is spoken in Mongolia and China. The Manchu-Tungus group of languages is spoken in Manchuria and Siberia.\n\nSino-Tibetan\n\nThe Sino-Tibetan family has many groups of languages. Of these, the best known is the group called Chinese. Chinese has about half a dozen main dialects, so-called. But they are, for practical purposes, separate languages. They are very different—in sounds and vocabulary mostly. And the speakers of one dialect cannot understand the speakers of another. Northern Chinese (or Mandarin) is considered the standard language of China. Other Chinese languages include Wu, Min (or Fukienese), Hakka, and Cantonese (or Yue). Most Chinese in Taiwan speak Min. Cantonese is used by most of the Chinese speakers in the United States.\n\nTibetan and Burmese also belong to the Sino-Tibetan family. Sometimes they are considered one group, sometimes two. Another group includes Thai and Lao. Thai is spoken in Thailand mostly, Lao mostly in Laos. The Miao-Yao languages are sometimes considered Sino-Tibetan. They are spoken by tribespeople in southwest China, northern Myanmar, and Indochina.\n\nAustronesian\n\nThe Austronesian, or Malayo-Polynesian, family is spoken from Madagascar, off the coast of Africa, to Hawaii. One of its best-known languages is Malay. The standard languages of Malaysia and Indonesia are varieties of Malay. Tagalog, Visayan, and Ilocano, all spoken in the Philippines, also belong to this family. So does Malagasy, a language spoken on the island of Madagascar.\n\nMāori, spoken in New Zealand, is an Austronesian language. And related languages are spoken in many of the South Sea Islands. These include Fiji in the Fiji Islands, Samoan in the Samoan Islands, Tahitian in the Society Islands, and Hawaiian in the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nCongo-Kordofanian\n\nThe Congo-Kordofanian family has two main groups: the Niger-Congo and the Kordofanian. The Kordofanian languages are spoken in the Sudan. The Niger-Congo languages are spoken over a great part of central and southern Africa.\n\nWell-known languages of the Niger-Congo group include Ibo, Yoruba, and Efik, spoken in Nigeria. Fulani (or Fula) is spoken mostly in Nigeria and Guinea; Mandingo mostly in Mali, Côte d’Ivoire, and Guinea. Twi has many speakers in Ghana. Mossi, Wolof, Ewe, and Tiv also are Niger-Congo languages.\n\nThe numerous Bantu languages are only one branch of one division of the Niger-Congo group. A few better-known Bantu languages are Swahili, Rwanda and Rundi, Sotho and Tswana, Ganda, Kongo, Kikuyu, Xhosa, Zulu, Swazi, and Shona.\n\nAfroasiatic\n\nThe Afroasiatic family is divided into four main groups. The best known is Semitic. Arabic, with its many dialects, is the most widely used Semitic language. It is spoken in many countries of the Middle East and North Africa. Modern Hebrew, the standard language of Israel, is also a Semitic language. So is Amharic, the standard language of Ethiopia.\n\nThe other groups of Afroasiatic are Berber, Cushitic, and Chadic. The Berber languages are spoken in North Africa. The Cushitic languages are spoken over a wide area in East Africa. Somali is the best-known Cushitic language. Hausa, the best-known Chadic language, is widely spoken in West Africa. (See also African languages.)\n\nOther language families\n\nThe Dravidian family of languages is spoken mostly in southern India. They include Telugu, Tamil, Kanarese (or Kannada), and Malaya-lam. Tamil is also spoken in Sri Lanka. Brahui, a Dravidian language, is used in Pakistan and Iran.\n\nThe Munda family consists of a few languages in central India. The Mon-Khmer family is spoken in Southeast Asia. Its best-known language is Cambodian, or Khmer, spoken in Cambodia. Most Mon speakers live in Myanmar and Thailand.\n\nAmong the better-known languages of the Nilo-Saharan family are Kanuri, Dinka, Luo, and Masai. Kanuri is spoken in Nigeria and Niger, Dinka and Luo in Kenya, Masai in Tanzania. The Khoisan family of languages is spoken mostly in South Africa by the Khoikhoi and San peoples. These languages, including Nama and !Khung, use special click sounds. Some of these sounds have spread to nearby Bantu languages like Zulu, Sotho, and Xhosa.\n\nJapanese seems to be the only member of its family. The same is true of Korean and also of Vietnamese. Basque is spoken mostly in the Pyrenees mountains region of France and Spain. It has no ties with any other language. Another language without ties is Burushaski. It is spoken in and around Hunza, in the Karakoram mountains of Kashmir. Andamanese, spoken by a handful of people in the Andaman Islands, has no known relatives. Neither has Ainu, once the language of a non-Japanese people of northern Japan. The Ainu people survive, but only a few words of their language are still used in communication today.\n\nAbout 25 or so languages spoken in the Caucasus Mountains have no known relatives. Some of them seem to be related, but the language picture there as a whole is not clear. Among the better known of these languages are Circassian and Georgian. How the languages spoken in Australia are related also is not known. The same is true of most languages of Papua New Guinea. Sometimes they are divided into two groups, a northern group and a southern.\n\nA few languages of Siberia do not belong to families elsewhere. These are sometimes called Paleosiberian languages. Some of these are related. But it is not certain that all are. Probably the most numerous group, the Chukchi group, includes Chukchi and Koryak.\n\nThe American Indian languages in North and South America are sometimes called Amerindian languages. Like the Paleosiberian languages, they are not clearly understood. Some Amerindian languages are related—Inuit and Aleut, for instance. And most seem to fit into families such as Iroquoian or Siouan. But many do not.\n\nLanguage Through Language: Guidelines for a Model Second-Language Program\n\nNo language is hard for children.They pick up any language easily and naturally—by listening and talking. But that ability soon fades. And thenthey must learn a new language through the onethey already have. And that’s where the second-language teacher comes in. The following are some guidelines for a model second-language program.\n\n1. Sounds are first. Students concentrate on listening and speaking, especially to begin with.\n\n2. Students get lots of practice in listening—to the teacher, to records and tapes, and so on. Then they imitate. They try to hear groups of words, not just one word at a time.\n\n3. Students get lots of practice in speaking, too. Everyone gets to do some talking every period, especially slow learners. And the students do most of the talking—the teacher already knows the language.\n\n4. Learning a new language is hard. Students are told—slow learners especially—not to worry about making mistakes, that everybody makes them.\n\n5. The teacher explains about the new language when necessary. But mostly students practice using the language to help them understand how it works.\n\n6. Students get drill. They need it to break old language habits and form new ones. But the teacher doesn’t overdo drill and tries to make it interesting.\n\n7. Students don’t translate from the new language to English. That builds the wrong skill—making sentences in English. And they go easy on translating from English. Instead they concentrate on thinking in and using the new language.\n\n8. Students are surrounded with second language. As much as possible, the teacher teaches in it.\n\n9. Students practice in lifelike situations—asking directions, ordering a meal, shopping, and so on. That way, they get to feel the new language is as alive as their own. And they get to understand about varieties of language.\n\n10. Students learn the body talk that goes along with language. They watch live speakers. Or they see films and videotapes. Then they practice using language and body talk together.\n\n11. Class time is used for live language interchange—between teacher and student, between student and student. Outside time is set aside for language lab work, for practice work of various kinds.\n\n12. Many kinds of materials are used—no one kind works best with all students. Practice materials are available for use outside of class.\n\n13. Students use the hardware of second-language learning—a language lab, tape recorders, records, and other aids. These are sometimes used at random. But they are also part of every student’s program.\n\n14. The teacher uses many approaches to language learning.Teachers know that the best method is the one that works with a particular student at a particular time.\n\n15. The teacher adjusts the program to each student’s abilities, especially with slow learners.\n\n16. Classes are small—small enough for everyone to have a chance to talk every day, small enough for the teacher to get around to everyone.\n\n17. The teacher aims for interest and excitement in materials and in the daily work."
