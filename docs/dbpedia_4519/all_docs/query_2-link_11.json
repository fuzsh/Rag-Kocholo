        "text": "Learning a new language can open up a whole world of exciting new experiences and opportunities, from connecting with a variety of people and cultures to advancing your career to studying and working abroad.\n\nBut with so many different languages to choose from, how do you decide which one to spend your time mastering?\n\nAlthough every foreign language comes with its own unique set of challenges, the reality is that some languages will simply be easier for fluent English speakers to become proficient in.\n\nWhy? Languages that are more closely related to English share certain qualities and characteristics that make them easier for English speakers to pick up. This includes things like sentence structure, vocabulary, tones and sounds, and writing system.\n\nSo, how easy or difficult a language might be for you to learn will depend not only on the language itself, but also on which languages youâre already fluent in, or at least familiar with. Remember, how long it will take you to learn a language is influenced by many different factors.\n\nWant to know which languages you have the best chance of mastering quickly?\n\nHere are 17 of the easiest languages for English speakers to learn. However, you can use this as a general guide. Weâve used data from the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) to rank them from the easier to the somewhat more challenging.\n\n1. Frisian\n\nFrisian is thought to be one of the languages most closely related to English, and therefore also the easiest for English-speakers to pick up. Frisian was once the primary language of what during the Middle Ages was known as Frisia. Although Frisia no longer exists, Frisian, which actually consists of three main dialects, is still in use in parts of the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nEnglish and Frisian share many similarities in terms of sentence structure and vocabulary. For instance, âGood morning,â translates to âGoeie moarnâ in the West Frisian dialect.\n\nUnfortunately, since Frisian is only spoken and understood by about 500,000 people, thereâs little reason to learn it, unless you intend to relocate to the Dutch province of Friesland or Germanyâs Saterland or North Frisia regions.\n\n2. Dutch\n\nDutch, like Frisian, is closely related to English. It shares many similarities with English, especially when it comes to vocabulary. For instance, words like âplastic,â âwaterâ and âlampâ are identical in both Dutch and English. The most challenging aspect of this language for English speakers will likely be the pronunciation.\n\nIn Belgium, Flemish, which is the dialect spoken in the Flanders region, is actually identical to Dutch. Although there are differences when it comes to pronunciation, vocabulary and idioms, Dutch speakers can quite easily understand Flemish, and vice-versa.\n\nDutch is spoken by around 24 million people worldwide, and is worth learning if you have plans to live and work in the Netherlands, or one of the other countries where itâs an official language, such as Suriname, Aruba or the Dutch Antilles.\n\n3. Norwegian\n\nLike English, Norwegian or âNorskâ is a Germanic language, which makes it easier for English-speakers to learn. It shares quite a bit of vocabulary with English, and unlike some Germanic languages, the pronunciation of most Norwegian words is fairly straightforward.\n\nFor the most part, the sentence structure is also quite comparable to English, although not identical. For instance, âHe comes from Norwayâ translates to âHan kommer fra Norge.â\n\nNorwegian is spoken by around 5 million people, primarily in Norway. With its roots in Old Norse, it can be a fascinating language to study, and fluency in Norwegian will give you greater access to the countryâs rich literary culture and mythology.\n\n4. Spanish\n\nAlthough Spanish is a Romance language rather than a Germanic language, itâs fairly easy for English speakers to learn because many English words stem from Latin. Spanish also uses the same alphabet as English, and many of the words are pronounced just as they are spelled.\n\nAnother benefit of Spanish for English speakers is that the sentence structure is not only similar to English, but itâs also not as strict as it is in English, which means there are often multiple ways a sentence can be put together.\n\nIf youâre looking to learn a language that will enhance your travel experiences and boost your employability, learning Spanish online is a great choice. Itâs one of the most widely spoken languages in the world and the second most spoken language in America, with around 534 million speakers scattered all around the globe. Download our free Spanish essentials eBook to help you get started.\n\n5. Portuguese\n\nPortuguese is spoken by around 234 million people around the world. Itâs the official language of both Portugal and Brazil, as well as six African countries, including Angola, Cape Verde and Mozambique, making it an extremely useful second language to have under your belt.\n\nLike Spanish, Portuguese stems from Latin and uses the same alphabet as the English language, which gives English speakers a slight advantage when learning it.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that there are some distinct differences between European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese. In fact, everything from the pronunciation to the vocabulary may vary, depending on which type of Portuguese you are learning. Which one you should focus on, of course, depends on where and how you intend to use it.\n\n6. Italian\n\nItalian is another Romance language that English-speakers can pick up without too much difficulty. In fact, Italian vocabulary is widely used in English, and youâre probably already familiar with more Italian words than you may realise, from those relating to food, such as âgelatoâ and âpaniniâ to others like âdiva,â âsolo,â âfinaleâ or âfiasco.â\n\nItalian and English use a similar sentence structure in most cases, and fortunately, the pronunciation is quite logical. This means youâll be able to read and pronounce most words correctly once you have learned a few ground rules. Download our easy, visual Italian essentials eBook and get a head start.\n\nItalian is the primary language for around 64 million people, and although itâs not as widely used as Spanish or Portuguese, itâs still spoken in many countries outside of Italy, including in Switzerland, Croatia, Slovenia, and even Argentina.\n\n7. French\n\nFrench is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, with around 77 million first-language speakers and 203 million second-language speakers. Itâs also an official language of 29 countries, including Switzerland, Luxembourg, Seychelles and Rwanda.\n\nDue to its somewhat tricky pronunciation, French can be slightly more challenging to learn than other Romance languages like Spanish and Italian. For instance, âEt tois?â (And you?) is pronounced as âAy twahâ and âPouvez-vous?â (Can you?) is pronounced as âPoo vay vooâ.\n\nEven so, French does share many similarities with English, especially when it comes to the vocabulary. This means that once English speakers have had a chance to learn some basic rules, theyâre usually able to pick it up quite quickly. Download our free French essentials eBook to accompany your studies.\n\n8. Swedish\n\nSwedish is spoken by somewhere around 10 million people, and while most of them live in Sweden, a small minority can be found in Finland, where Swedish is also a national language.\n\nSwedish is on the easier side for English speakers to learn, because again, itâs a Germanic language. Although the pronunciation may take some time to master, Swedish grammar rules and sentence structure are not overly complicated.\n\nThere are, of course, a few trickier aspects to learning this Scandinavian language, such as getting used to its three extra vowels. Youâll also need to familiarise yourself with unfamiliar compound words like âjordnÃ¶tter,â which means peanuts, but translates to âdirt nuts,â or âkofÃ¥ngare,â which means bumper, but translates to âcow catcher.â\n\n9. Romanian\n\nRomanian is a language you might not have expected to see on this list. But although the country is surrounded by Slavic-speaking countries, Romanian is actually a Romance language and uses much of the same vocabulary as Italian, Spanish and French.\n\nFor example,âLa revedere,â which is used for saying goodbye, is similar to the Italian âArrividerci,â and the apology âScuzÄ-mÄâ is similar to the French âExcusez-moi.â Itâs also a phonetic language, which means most words are spelled the same way they are pronounced.\n\nOf course, there are a few trickier aspects to this language, including grammatical differences and letters with âdiacritics.â But, overall, Romanian, which is spoken by around 30 million people, primarily in Romania and Moldova, is a surprisingly easy language to learn.\n\n10. Danish\n\nDanish is a Germanic language spoken by around 6 million people, most of whom live in Denmark. Like Norwegian and Swedish, it has fairly straightforward grammar rules and a lot of vocabulary that will be familiar to English speakers.\n\nFor example, âGode tidendeâ sounds a lot like âGood tidings,â and the word âdyre,â which means âexpensive,â is similar to the word âdear,â which is used in English when something is considered too pricey. Because of its more challenging pronunciation, however, Danish isnât the easiest Scandinavian language to learn.\n\nEven so, if you plan to stay in Denmark for a longer period of time, learning the local language is simply the best way to fully immerse yourself in the countryâs unique culture and form deeper connections.\n\n11. German\n\nGerman is, as the name suggests, a Germanic language. It shares many similarities with English, including a common alphabet, comparable sentence structure and familiar vocabulary. For example, everyday German words like âWasser,â (water) âApfel,â (apple) and âFischâ (fish) are very similar to their English equivalents. Download our free German essentials eBook to see the similarities.\n\nOne aspect of German that English-speakers do tend to struggle with is the pronunciation, especially when it comes to longer compound words like âFremdschÃ¤menâ (cringe) or ââVerschlimmbessernâ (to worsen or exacerbate).\n\nBut while German might not be quite as easy for English-speakers to grasp as Dutch or Norwegian, it is an extremely useful language to learn, as itâs spoken by more than 100 million people throughout Central Europe, including in Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg.\n\n12. Indonesian\n\nIndonesian is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, with over 40 million native speakers and more than 150 million non-native speakers. As an Austronesian language, Indonesian does differ quite a bit from the Germanic and Romance languages on this list, but itâs actually surprisingly straightforward for English-speakers to learn.\n\nThis is partly down to the fact that Indonesian is a phonetic language, which means words are spelled as they sound. Indonesian sentence structure is also similar to English and its grammatical rules are fairly simple.\n\nFor instance, to change a singular word to plural, all you have to do is repeat the word or add an extra one. So âchildâ is âanakâ and âchildrenâ is âanak-anak.â Easy right?\n\n13. Malay\n\nMalay is spoken by more than 200 million people throughout Southeast Asia. Like Indonesian, itâs an Austronesian language. In fact, it shares many similarities with Indonesian due to the fact that a similar variety of the language is used in Indonesia, Brunei and Singapore.\n\nBut, although Malay and Indonesian speakers can generally understand each other, there are some differences in terms of spelling, pronunciation, and vocabulary, with Malay based more on loanwords from English, and Indonesian having more loanwords from Dutch.\n\nMalay is widely considered to be one of the easiest Asian languages to learn, because its grammatical rules are simple and itâs easy to pronounce. Of course, as with any language, there will be lots of new vocabulary to learn, but if you need to spend any amount of time in Southeast Asia, itâs an excellent second language to have under your belt.\n\n14. Swahili\n\nSwahili is a Bantu language and another very useful second language to have, as itâs widely used in East Africa, including in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania. Although estimates vary greatly, Swahili is thought to be spoken as a native language by around 16 million people, and as a second language by up to 80 million people.\n\nIn fact, if youâve watched the Disney classic âThe Lion Kingâ youâll already be familiar with a number of Swahili words such as ârafikiâ (friend) and âsimbaâ (lion). âThe pronunciation of most Swahili words is fairly easy, and many are very similar to their English equivalent. For instance, âpolisiâ is âpoliceâ and âbaiskeliâ is âbicycle.â\n\nThere are also some key differences, of course, but if youâre looking to gain fluency in one or more African languages, Swahili is an excellent one to start with.\n\n15. Filipino Tagalog\n\nFilipino Tagalog is one of the official languages of the Philippines and another Austronesian language. On one hand, itâs not an overly complicated language to learn, as the pronunciation isnât difficult, and much of its vocabulary is borrowed from other languages, including English, Spanish and Malay.\n\nOn the other hand, the sentence structure and verb focus of Tagalog is quite different to that of English, which makes it the most challenging language on this list. But, as with many foreign languages, itâs often simply a matter of getting some practice in.\n\nWith Tagalog spoken as a native language by around 45 million people, learning it or at least some of the basics, will make your stay in the Philippines a lot easier.\n\nSo there you have it, the 17 easiest languages for English speakers to learn. If youâre thinking of investing some time into learning a new language, why not take a look at some of the language courses offered by Berlitz?\n\n16. Afrikaans\n\nAfrikaans is relatively easy for English speakers because itâs packed with familiar words and straightforward grammar. Its vocabulary draws heavily from Dutch â also in this ranking of the easiest languages to learn for English speakers â which shares many common roots with English. This means that many words are instantly recognizable. Besides, Afrikaans is very logical, without complex verb conjugations nor gendered nouns. Its syntax is simple and intuitive, much like English, making sentence construction a breeze. With a phonetic spelling system, what you see is what you get, so pronunciation is easier too. Itâs a perfect language for diving in and picking up quickly.\n\nLearning Afrikaans is not just easy, but also incredibly interesting and useful. It opens doors to understanding South African culture, complex history, and its diverse people.
