        "text": "Different Levels of Language Proficiency\n\nWhen you learn a second language, you naturally go through different levels of language proficiency. These levels are commonly called beginner, intermediate, advanced, and superior (or highly proficient), although they are not always clearly separated from one another. In general, beginner language users are able to do less with a language than users at more advanced levels. In this post, we explore two frameworks commonly used to understand the different levels of language proficiency: the CEFR language levels and the ACTFL language levels. Both of these frameworks identify language learners as somewhere on a spectrum from a complete beginner/novice learner (A1, CEFR; Novice, ACTFL) to entirely proficient (C2, CEFR; Distinguished, ACTFL). In addition to unpacking these language levels, we’ll also compare the ACTFL and CEFR levels, address how to properly test language proficiency, answer questions about what it means to be fluent, and discuss how to improve your fluency in a language. Are you ready? Allons-y ! / Vamos! / يلا (yalla) / Let’s go!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are the CEFR Language Levels?\n\nLet’s have a look at each of the CEFR levels in more detail.\n\nThe CEFR language levels are A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2. These language levels represent proficiency descriptors ranging from beginner to advanced, as measured by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, teaching, assessment (CEFR). But what is CEFR, anyway? Well, CEFR was first developed by the Council of Europe in 2001 to serve as a framework for the clear and comprehensive assessment of foreign language proficiency. It was also designed to guide the development of language syllabi and curriculum guidelines as resources for language teaching and learning. One of the main objectives behind the creation of CEFR was to bring greater focus to what language learners ought to achieve with language and how this can be accomplished.\n\nCEFR A1 Level (Basic)\n\nThe CEFR A1 proficiency level represents basic users of a language. At the A1 level, language learners are able to use and understand basic phrases or common expressions used in familiar contexts or to complete beginner-friendly, concrete tasks. In speaking, the A1 learner will use isolated and formulaic utterances, along with pauses, repetition, and rephrasing. When listening and reading, language users at the A1 level require slow, direct, and simple speech and text. A1 learners can introduce themselves, ask and answer basic personal questions, and generally interact in simple ways.\n\nAn A1 user can…\n\nUse very basic memorized words and phrases and grammatical structures\n\nAnswer and ask questions about personal information\n\nUse basic connectors like “then” or “and” to link words and phrases\n\nUnderstand short and simple strings of words by recognizing basic vocabulary and phrases\n\nPick up on basic, familiar content from text or conversation, especially with visual aids\n\nAn A1 user cannot yet…\n\nStray far from a memorized repertoire of words and formulaic expressions\n\nCommunicate with a non-sympathetic listener\n\nCommunicate beyond very basic and familiar personal information\n\nTo reach the A1 level, you can start by memorizing a few key, high-frequency words or phrases in your target language and practice introducing yourself or offering some basic personal information. At the next level, you’ll grow a bit more confident in the language — take a look in the next section!\n\nCEFR A2 Level (Basic)\n\nThe A2 proficiency level is for language learners who are still basic users, but whose skills are slightly more advanced than an A1 learner. At the A2 language proficiency level, users still rely on familiar and personal subject matter to assist with language understanding and production. In reading and listening, A2 users can comprehend predictable and simple texts and conversations. In writing, these users can create short messages with very concrete purposes, like expressing gratitude.\n\nAn A2 user can…\n\nEngage in simple tasks that involve routine exchanges of information such as descriptions of identity, surrounding environment, and immediate needs\n\nUse and understand phrases related to topics discussing personal and familial information, employment, shopping, activities, etc.\n\nUse simple coordinating conjunctions and connector phrases (e.g. “and” or “but” in English)\n\nAn A2 user cannot yet…\n\nCarry and direct a conversation independently\n\nSpeak without relying on reformulations, false starts, or hesitation\n\nCommunicate without making basic grammatical and structural errors\n\nTo reach the A2 level, you can increase your vocabulary repertoire and practice having conversations about a wide range of topics. Now, let’s explore what to work on next after you master these skills.\n\nCEFR B1 Level (Independent)\n\nThe B1 language proficiency level describes learners who are independent users of the language. B1 users can regularly understand language related to work, leisure, travel, and school as it comes up in clear conversational input. B1 language users should also have enough vocabulary and knowledge of grammatical structures to manage routine and predictable conversation, and to discuss topics of general and personal interest using short connected phrases.\n\nA B1 user can…\n\nCommunicate about and understand the main points of a variety of topics including family, hobbies and interests, travel, work, and familiar current events\n\nOffer explanations and opinions, describe experiences, dreams, hopes and ambitions, etc.\n\nConfirm mutual understanding in a conversation\n\nA B1 user cannot yet…\n\nProduce language for long stretches of time without pausing to rephrase or search for expressions or vocabulary\n\nUse and understand language on topics that are less familiar or personally interesting\n\nTo reach the B1 language proficiency level, try to practice stringing independent sentences and expressions into larger sequences of information. Expanding your vocabulary on new topics that feel familiar or interesting to you will also help you reach the “independent user” level. Now, let’s check out the next level: B2.\n\nCEFR B2 Level (Independent)\n\nLanguage learners at the B2 level (still independent language users) possess the ability to identify the main point of texts and conversations that discuss both concrete and abstract (although still familiar) topics. B2 users have a higher level of fluency and spontaneity in conversation than A1 to B1 users. While errors may still be occasionally made, they do not prevent understanding, and the B2 language user will often self-correct.\n\nA B2 user can…\n\nUnderstand longer and more complicated arguments in speech or text, assuming that it is not too unfamiliar\n\nProvide extended detail and offer arguments in favor of or against a topic\n\nHave regular, basic interactions with native speakers\n\nProvide and defend an opinion or position on a variety of topics familiar to the interests of the language user\n\nA B2 user cannot yet…\n\nEngage with material that is largely unfamiliar and very abstract\n\nUnderstand and participate in conversations (or engage with material) that is conceptually unfamiliar or difficult\n\nAvoid a certain level of pausing or abruptness in longer conversations\n\nTo reach the B2 level, try to familiarize yourself with more abstract concepts in your target language. Practice speaking and using transition words (even in a mirror!) to improve your fluency and spontaneity in conversation. But maybe you’re already there — in that case, let’s unpack the next level: C1.\n\nCEFR C1 Level (Proficient)\n\nThe C1 language proficiency level refers to proficient language users who can understand a broad range of information, often picking up on implicit details and meaning. C1 language users can express themselves with relative ease and fluency. They can use language flexibility in a wide variety of contexts (social, professional, academic, etc.). In speech and writing, the C1 user can use connectors and organizational devices to structure their thoughts.\n\nA C1 user can…\n\nUnderstand information that is less clear, structured, and explicit, even when the information is specialized, technical, or outside the field of interest or knowledge of the language user\n\nUse the language spontaneously and easily to meet professional and social needs\n\nUse the language with an awareness of appropriate style and audience\n\nLimit errors to infrequent, minor mistakes and maintain a high level of grammatical accuracy\n\nA C1 user cannot yet…\n\nFreely use and understand language even when it is highly stylized, idiomatic, or unfamiliarly colloquial\n\nTo reach the C1 level, you will want to practice using the language not only in your everyday life, but in more formal contexts, as well — such as in professional and serious conversations at work or in academic settings. Work on your structural knowledge of the language and expand your vocabulary beyond concepts that are concrete or familiarly abstract. Once you do this, you’ll just have one last language level to go — C2!\n\nCEFR C2 Level (Proficient)\n\nLearners at C2 language proficiency are the most proficient on the CEFR scale, understanding almost all input easily. C2 users can summarize and present information, and even reconstruct arguments or narratives that they have already heard. They can also express themselves accurately and totally fluently, and understand complexities in context, meaning, and language style. C2 users will be able to fully engage content that is unfamiliar, specialized, or complexly abstract.\n\nA C2 learner can…\n\nUnderstand almost all oral language spoken with regular, native-speaker pacing\n\nUse and understand language that is structurally complex or that relies on idioms or colloquial expressions\n\nNavigate confusion or misunderstanding smoothly and delicately, to the point where others may not notice\n\nDemonstrate implicit understanding of the language, including knowledge of discourse techniques such as turn-taking in conversation, allusions or references, play on words, etc.\n\nTo reach the C2 language proficiency level, you’ll need to be an expert in your language! Diversify the content you consume in the language to familiarize yourself with new language styles and more complex vocabulary and grammatical structures. And, of course, practice speaking!\n\nNow that we’ve seen the CEFR language proficiency levels, let’s take a look at another scale used to measure language proficiency: the ACTFL language levels.\n\nWhat are the ACTFL Language Levels?\n\nThe ACTFL language levels are Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Superior, and Distinguished. These levels, published by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language, describe what language users are able to spontaneously do in a language in regard to speaking, writing, listening, and reading. Like the CEFR levels, the ACTFL levels reflect a continuum of language proficiency.\n\nWithin the five ACTFL language levels (Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Superior, and Distinguished), the first three levels of proficiency contain the sublevels “low,” “mid,” and “high.”\n\nAt the highest sublevel (“high”), a language user will occasionally perform at the next major proficiency level but will not be able to sustain this performance consistently. For example, a Novice High language learner will behave almost like an intermediate language user, but not quite as consistently. On the contrary, at the “low” sublevel, the learner is barely meeting the requirements for the level — an Intermediate Low learner is clearly far away from the “high” Intermediate sublevel, while not being too far from the Novice level. At the “mid” sublevel, a language user is solidly performing at that major proficiency level, with very little evidence of reaching the next major level. Pretty straightforward, right?\n\nNow, let’s take a closer look at what Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Superior, and Distinguished language users can and cannot do.\n\nACTFL Novice\n\nNovice language learners have a very limited functional ability in the language. Novice learners rely on simple, predictable, memorizable, and familiar language structures. They speak in isolated phrases and words that may require a sympathetic listener to fully understand. When Novice language users listen to their target language, they might need help from the speaker in the form of slower speech, repetition or rephrasing, and simple and predictable input. When writing and reading, a Novice learner relies on formulaic phrases and keywords and predictable content/communication.\n\nBut what exactly can a Novice learner do? Think back to when you first started learning a second language — you probably started with simple phrases and words like “hello” or “thank you.” Or, maybe you learned how to write your name in a new alphabet! These are all skills that a Novice language learner has. Take a look at the lists below:\n\nA Novice learner can…\n\nExtract basic information and identify topics in familiar situations, especially with the support of visuals\n\nProvide/ask for limited information by answering/asking very simple questions with the aid of familiar body language or visuals\n\nExpress very basic feelings and preferences, introduce themselves, and name and (sometimes) describe familiar people, places, and objects\n\nRecognize and use memorized phrases and words\n\nInteract in a limited way in familiar, day-to-day contexts\n\nA Novice learner cannot yet…\n\nSpeak in full sentences or paragraphs\n\nUse complex grammatical structures or tenses\n\nProduce or understand conversations on topics that are not familiar\n\nAre you wondering how to reach the Novice level? You might already be there! This is the language proficiency level at which every learner starts. Pick up a phrase book, practice some easy, formulaic conversations, or learn the alphabet of your new language and you’ll be well on your way to being a Novice. But, maybe you’re a little more advanced by now…in that case, let’s check out what it looks like to be an Intermediate language learner.\n\nACTFL Intermediate\n\nIntermediate language users have a stronger grip on the language than a novice user — Intermediate learners can create with the language, which means they can express themselves (and understand others) beyond formulaic phrases and memorized words. In speaking, they can ask and answer simple, familiar questions and form sentences or even groups of sentences. As listeners, Intermediate learners still rely on tools like repetition, restatement, and context clues, but they can comprehend more information from clear, direct, and simple utterances than a Novice user can. In reading and writing, Intermediate learners can produce and understand simple, straightforward messages in individual and multiple-sentence formats on everyday familiar topics.\n\nAn Intermediate learner can…\n\nUnderstand the main idea from and use single sentences and strings of sentences on familiar subjects\n\nInteract with other speakers to meet basic needs or ask/answer simple questions\n\nProvide more detailed, while still simplistic, personal information including expressions of opinion, preference, feeling, etc.\n\nUse basic, high-frequency vocabulary and grammar structures\n\nAn Intermediate learner cannot yet…\n\nProvide detailed narration across time frames\n\nEngage with material or conversations on less familiar topics\n\nEntirely effectively use organized, paragraph-structured discourse\n\nTo reach the Intermediate level, a language user must learn to create with the language — meaning form sentences and questions and string together ideas and familiar expressions/vocabulary to express original information. At the Advanced level, language users start to acquire some of these skills that Intermediate learners do not yet have. Let’s dig in!\n\nACTFL Superior\n\nSuperior-level language users can use the language accurately and fluently to discuss both familiar and unfamiliar topics in both formal and informal settings. As speakers, Superior language users can communicate without extensive hesitation and can use native-like communications strategies (e.g., turn-taking strategies). In writing, Superior language learners demonstrate a mastery of the writing standards for the target language. Across the communicative domains, Superior language users make few errors in grammar and vocabulary. As readers and listeners, Superior language users can understand information on a variety of topics regardless of level of familiarity.\n\nA Superior learner can…\n\nCommunicate (formally and informally) about general and special interests, concrete and abstract ideas, and select social or political issues/arguments\n\nConstruct hypotheses and structured arguments with supporting evidence\n\nCommunicate with infrequent errors, which (if they do occur) do not limit intelligibility\n\nDemonstrate knowledge of how to effectively follow structural and vocabulary standards in writing\n\nMake inferences, pick up on implicit communication, and understand literary style and genre\n\nUse and understand a broad range of vocabulary (including specialized, precise, or academic vocabulary) and complex grammatical structures, like argumentation/refutation and hypothesis\n\nA Superior learner cannot yet…\n\nWithout any difficulty, engage with highly abstract and academic subject matter that is outside of specific interest\n\nSpeak in a way that is comparable with written language\n\nTo reach the Superior level of proficiency in a language, a learner must acquire relative mastery of abstract and concrete vocabulary and grammatical and communicative structures that are used by native speakers. In some cases, a language user will continue to master a language to the point that they reach the Distinguished proficiency level.\n\nACTFL Distinguished\n\nAt the Distinguished level, a language user is accurate, effective, fluent, and comfortable. Not only can Distinguished language users communicate about everyday familiar and unfamiliar topics, but they can offer advice, make arguments, and explain a significant range of complicated, academic, and abstract subjects. In speaking and writing, Distinguished language users can use the language in official and formal contexts like legal representation and correspondence, journal articles, etc. In listening and reading, Distinguished language users can understand and appreciate stylistic features and devices in the language, such as puns, tone, cultural allusions, and flowery/beautiful language.\n\nA Distinguished learner can…\n\nUse audience-specific and culturally appropriate language\n\nRepresent opposing views or advocate on behalf of someone else or a different perspective\n\nSpeak in a way that resembles written communication\n\nUnderstand and communicate subtlety and nuance with attention to style and strategic language use\n\nEngage critically with artistic, academic, classic, legal, political, and idiomatic uses of the language\n\nAppreciate the strategy and nuance behind certain phrasing, word choice, discourse organization, etc.\n\nTo reach the Distinguished level, a language user must have extensive knowledge of the language and many years of experience and practice to hone proficiency. A learner must master the ability to use the language not only in formal settings, but in highly academic, professional, legal, political, etc settings.\n\nNow that we’ve taken a look at both the ACTFL and CEFR language proficiency levels, let’s take a look at how they are similar and different.\n\nHow do CEFR and ACTFL Compare?\n\nThe CEFR and ACTFL organizations have similar goals: to establish criteria that can be used to assess a language user’s functional language proficiency. Both proficiency frameworks are used to form the basis of major testing and certification systems, as well as to develop materials (e.g., textbooks), curricula, and standards. And yet, only recently have the two systems been empirically correlated. In 2010, ACTFL began an effort to align the two scales, resulting in a one-directional correspondence of CEFR ratings to the ACTFL scale.\n\nCheck out the corresponding CEFR ratings to ACTFL proficiency assessment scores below:\n\nHere at Mango, we offer a Mango Proficiency Scale of five levels (Beginner 1, Beginner 1, Skilled 1, Skilled 2, Skilled 3), meant to assist our learners in tracking their progress in their language using the Mango app. Like the CEFR and ACTFL scales, the Mango Proficiency Scale tracks progress across the four domains of speaking, reading, writing, and listening. To see how each Mango level compares with the ACTFL and CEFR frameworks, see the comparison chart we’ve developed below:\n\nAlright, so now we understand what the different proficiency levels are — both on the CEFR scale and the ACTFL scale (and even on Mango’s own proficiency level system!). But, how do you find out which language level you’re at? Let’s take a look!\n\nHow to Test Language Level\n\nThe most effective way to test your language level is to take a language proficiency test. A language proficiency test assesses a language user’s speaking, reading, writing, and/or listening proficiency. While ACTFL has developed its own assessments in these domains, CEFR offers guides for linking general proficiency test scores to the CEFR scale.\n\nAs explained by ACTFL, a good proficiency test will emphasize proficiency over performance, meaning that assessment is more about how you can use the language in real-world situations and less about your knowledge of verb conjugations. Proficiency tests should examine:\n\nInterpersonal, interpretive, and presentational modes of communication\n\nWhat functions a language user is capable of (what tasks they can complete)\n\nWhat contexts/content a language user can operate in\n\nWhat text types a language user can employ (isolated words, sentences, paragraphs, etc.)\n\nA language user’s control of the language, knowledge of communication strategies, cultural and communicative competence, and vocabulary\n\nThe ability to test language proficiency is an important step in studying how language is acquired. Research using ACTFL proficiency tests and levels, for example, has suggested that college language learners’ proficiency increases by roughly one-third of an ACTFL sublevel per college semester. Interestingly, students at lower proficiency levels seem to make the quickest improvements.\n\nStudies like this one suggest that proficiency tests need to properly assess communicative competence (how well a learner can actually function in a language) in a way that is context-appropriate (accounting for differences in learners and their environments).\n\nOkay, so now you know a bit more about how to find out what your language level is. But, how do you know if that means you’re fluent?\n\nWhich Language Level is Enough to Speak Fluently?\n\nGenerally speaking, the Superior (ACTFL) or C1 (CEFR) language proficiency level is enough to speak fluently. In the descriptors for what learners can do at these levels, ACTFL explains that superior speakers “are able to communicate with accuracy and fluency.” Similarly, CEFR explains that C1 users are able to “express [themselves] fluently and spontaneously, almost effortlessly.”\n\nAnd yet, the term “fluent” certainly can be ambiguous – it depends on what you really mean when you say you want to be fluent. Do you want to be able to ask for directions on the street? Or, maybe you’d like to hold a conversation with your partner’s family? Perhaps you’re even looking to conduct research and do work in the language? These will all require different levels of language fluency. So in order to really know which language level is enough to speak fluently, you’ll first have to figure out your own goals and take a look at the ACTFL Can-Do Statements and CEFR Self-Assessment Grid to see if you’ve reached them!\n\nBut perhaps you already know you’re not quite where you want to be yet. That’s okay! Let’s take a look at some ways to improve your level of language proficiency.\n\nHow to Improve Your Level of Language Proficiency\n\nTo improve your level of language proficiency, you’ll need to practice reading, speaking, writing, and listening. You can also help yourself get to a higher level by familiarizing yourself with new vocabulary topics, studying more complex grammar constructions, and growing comfortable conversing in the language will also help to proficiency. This can help improve your self-confidence too! However, if you’re still not sure where to get started, check out our self-guided reflection on what might be holding you back from achieving your desired level of fluency. Here’s a preview: you might need to focus on your motivation, the amount of time you’re spending on learning, and your language learning strategies.\n\nOne of my favorite strategies for practicing a language is to simply find ways to make yourself more comfortable with it. When you increase your comfort with speaking, reading, writing, and/or listening in a language, you’re more likely to be motivated, have more self-confidence, and have lower anxiety — all factors which can impact how effectively you learn. In other words, the more anxious or less confident you are in your language, the harder it will be to acquire it. To become more confident and comfortable in your language, try incorporating it into activities you already enjoy:\n\nRead a book (especially one you have read before) or even simple texts like recipes, directions, or social media posts in your target language\n\nWrite a journal entry or notes/grocery lists/etc. in the target language\n\nListen to a podcast or songs (and look up the lyrics) in the language\n\nSpeak to a friend, pet, plant (it’s good for them!), or even yourself in the mirror\n\nChange the language settings on your phone (but make sure you know how to change them back if necessary) Use the Mango app!\n\nLearning a language takes time, and it’s not always easy to climb the language proficiency ladder. But don’t worry — with time, dedication, and your new understanding of how proficiency works in language learning, you’ll reach your goals in no time!\n\nReferences\n\nIsbell, D.
