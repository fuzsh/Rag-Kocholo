        "text": "Are you wondering, “Can I learn more than one language at the same time?” All of it depends on you and how you think.\n\nThere are different ways that people’s brains are wired. In Spanish, we say cada cabeza es un mundo (every head is a world). In other words, to learn is to take knowledge and make it your own.\n\nIf your brain is already set up to learn languages, it’s a great idea to learn more than one at the same time. On the other hand, if you’ve never learned another language, you might want to start with just one.\n\nFind out why it’s a good idea and how to learn languages quickly by reading on. Here are nine tips to help you get started!\n\nJoin more than 559 million people on the planet who speak Spanish!\n\nSign up for your free trial Spanish class today. ➡️\n\nWhy It’s a Good Idea To Learn Two Languages at Once\n\nShould you learn two languages at the same time? Some researchers think so. A 2012 study by Johan Mårtensson shows that learning a new language sharpens your intelligence by helping your brain cells connect in new ways.\n\nWhen you learn a language, or even two languages at the same time, your brain gets stronger, which makes you smarter.\n\nIt also saves some time to learn two languages at the same time.\n\nIt can take up to two years to speak a language fluently, depending on how much you practice and how hard the language is.\n\nCan you learn three of them? If you learn two or three languages at the same time, it will (almost) take the same amount of time, but you will learn twice or three times as much. This will give you access to more places and cultures.\n\nNotice Your Language Choices and Their Roots\n\nHave you ever heard that languages have roots?\n\nRomance languages include Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, Romanian, Galician, and Catalonian. They’re all variations of Latin, so they share common words, roots, and expressions.\n\nFor example, the word “street” in Spanish is la calle; the word la rúa is less common but still acceptable. In Galician and Portuguese, “street” is “rua,” while in French, it’s “rue.”\n\nWhen languages have the same roots, learning certain words or the syntax makes it easier. You have two options when learning multiple languages at once:\n\nLearn two or more languages with the same root\n\nLearn two or more languages with different roots\n\nThe path you take it’s up to you. Some people find it easier to learn Portuguese and Spanish because they are highly similar.\n\nHowever, some students might confuse the words and mix them up. For them, it might be better to learn Portuguese and German, for example, since they are highly different.\n\n9 Tips for Learning Multiple Languages at a Time\n\nWhichever path you want to take, here are 10 tips to learn multiple languages at once.\n\n1. Listen to Music in the Languages\n\nAdding songs to your playlist in your target language helps you hone not only your listening skills, but also your reading skills. Read the lyrics and sing along to learn a ton of new words.\n\nThis same rule applies to movies and to videogames, as well. Start with a movie you’ve seen before, since you won’t focus on the plot as much as the new words you’ll be learning.\n\nFor example, if you watch Star Wars in Spanish, when you see Darth Vader tell Luke that he is his father, you won’t be surprised. Instead, you’ll be paying attention to the dialogue in Spanish (or your other target language). Try repeating your favorite phrases to gain even more fluency!\n\n2. Stop Thinking Logically\n\nThe easiest path to learn a language is to stop thinking logically.\n\nHow did you learn your mother tongue? When you started learning how to talk, the only thing you did was repeat what you heard, because you needed others to understand you.\n\nMy advice is not to get mired in grammar rules as a beginner. Instead, stop your brain and repeat like a parrot. Believe me, it works wonders.\n\n3. Name the Objects Around You\n\nThis is a simple trick to improve your vocabulary. Imagine that you step into the kitchen. What do you see? The stove, the trash can, the sink, a knife, plates, pans, and many more things. Look at them and switch your language.\n\nHow do I say “stove” in Spanish? La estufa. How do I say “trash can” in Spanish? El bote de basura. How do I say “sink” in Spanish? El fregadero. How do I say knife, plates, and pans in Spanish? El cuchillo, los platos y los sartenes.\n\nNext time you come into the kitchen, repeat the exercise. If you’re learning multiple languages at once, be sure to do this in two phases. For example, apply Spanish to the kitchen and Italian to the living room, and then switch them up the next day.\n\n4. Pick Up Slang\n\nThis is a more advanced tip, so leave it for when you feel comfortable with the language and you’ve gotten the basics down.\n\nIf you want to sound like a native speaker, slang is a must. Once you feel comfortable, start listening to rap music in your target language. That way, you’ll learn a ton of slang. This enables you to sound much more like a local, and not like you learned everything from a book.\n\n5. Don’t Mix Your Languages\n\nWhy is it a bad idea to learn two languages at once? Because mixing them up may lead to not speaking either one of them.\n\nThis is why it is highly important not to mix your languages. Make sure that you’re speaking either one or the other, no matter how alike or different they may be.\n\n6. Read in the Languages\n\nReading in your target language is a must.\n\nIf you’re eager to start reading but feel you’re still taking baby steps in your target language, why not read books for kids? The illustrations and the more simple language help a lot. Once you feel comfortable with them, start stepping up your game and move into books for adolescents and teens.\n\nGet your favorite book in your target language, too. That way you’ll know exactly what you’re reading and will learn many new words.\n\nThis advice even works if your target language has different characters, for example the “ä” in German, the “ë” in French, the á, é, í, ó, ö, ú, ü in Hungarian (they have 14 vowels!), or Manji in Japanese.\n\n7. Practice with Friends\n\nLearning multiple languages at once is ideal for meeting new people or introducing your pals to a new hobby. This way you can practice together while helping out each other.\n\nChallenge each other and play simple games in your target language to get better together.\n\n8. Get to Know a Native Speaker\n\nPracticing with your buddies is one thing, but practicing with a native speaker is next level.\n\nMost native speakers appreciate it when they hear a foreigner speaking their language, even if they struggle with it.\n\nIn my personal experience, knowing a native speaker has boosted my Italian and Spanish skills. My friend Emanuele has taught me many things in Italian and I’ve taught him several in Spanish. For instance, I got better at applying “il congiuntivo passato,” which is the equivalent of el pretérito del subjuntivo (subjunctive preterite) in Spanish. I’ve also learned slang words, synonyms, and words in Genovese thanks to this intercultural exchange.\n\n9. Immerse Yourself in the Languages\n\nThe best way to learn any language is to spend some time in a country where that language is spoken. If you want to learn multiple languages at once, countries with multiple official languages are spectacular.\n\nFor example, Canada could be a great destiny for a Spanish speaker who aims to learn English and French. Paraguay is an amazing place if you’re looking to learn Spanish and Guaraní. Spain is the place to go if you want to learn Spanish and Basque, Catalonian, or Galician. In Guatemala you can learn Spanish and Kakchiquel Maya, in Mexico Spanish and Náhuatl, in Perú Spanish and Aymara, or in Switzerland learn German, French, and Italian.\n\nImmersing yourself in your target language and culture helps you out enormously.\n\nHave You Thought About Learning Spanish?\n\nAs you know, learning another language improves your cognition and decision-making abilities, making your mind even more agile than it already is.\n\nWhat makes Spanish so special among other Romance languages? Its versatility. Spanish will open the door for you in 21 countries on three continents: the Americas, Europe, and Africa! It also opens more doors within the U.S. since more than 53 million people speak Spanish there! And if those two reasons aren’t enough, Spanish is the third most common language on the internet?\n\nSign up for a free trial class at Homeschool Spanish Academy today and put these tips to use.
