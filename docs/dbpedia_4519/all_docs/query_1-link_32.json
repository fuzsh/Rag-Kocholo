        "text": "<<Subscribe on iTunes>> <<Watch on Youtube>> <<Support us>>\n\nIn this episode, you will learn how to describe your level of language proficiency in English or in any other language. How do you describe your level of English knowledge? Learn with me!\n\nIf somebody asks you questions like ‘How well do you know English?’ or ‘How good is your English?’ or ‘What is your English level?’, you can:\n\nname your level of language proficiency according to the CEFR,\n\ndescribe what you can do in this language, or\n\ndescribe your general language competency.\n\nTelling about your native language\n\nI am a native speaker of …\n\nI am a native speaker of Russian.\n\nShe is a native speaker of Italian.\n\nShe is an English native speaker.\n\nIf you can speak two languages at the same level of native-like proficiency, you are BILINGUAL.\n\nIf you know more than 4 or 5 foreign languages, you can call yourself a POLYGLOT.\n\nOne polyglot I know can speak 12 foreign languages!\n\nBE CAREFUL!\n\nA lot of people try to say ‘I speak in English’ or ‘I speak in Russian’. We don’t normally use IN in such sentences.\n\nCorrect: ‘I speak English’ or ‘I can speak English’, ‘I can speak Russian’.\n\nDescribing levels of language proficiency according to CEFR\n\nThere are three levels of language proficiency:\n\nBasic User / Beginner, Elementary, and Pre-intermediate (A1-A2)\n\nIndependent User / Intermediate and Upper-intermediate (B1-B2)\n\nProficient User / Advanced (C1-C2)\n\nLearn more about the CEFR here\n\nBut if you don’t know what it means, a teacher could help you with testing and recommendations.\n\nPhrases to describe what you can do in the language\n\n‘I GET BY in English.’ (you have survival skills in this language: you can ask about something in the shop or in the restaurant)\n\n‘I can hold a basic conversation.’ (you can communicate on simple everyday topics)\n\n‘I know some words in Dutch.’ = ‘I know a few words in Dutch’\n\n‘I studied English at school, but I can’t speak it.’\n\n‘My English is a bit rusty’. (RUSTY = not fresh)\n\n‘I wish I could speak French better’.\n\n‘My English vocabulary could be better’. ‘I think my speaking skills in English could be better’.\n\nTelling about your general language proficiency (CV’s, autobiographies, etc.)\n\nYou can describe your language skills as Basiс, Conversational, Fluent, or Proficient.\n\nBasic – you can communicate on simple topics or know some phrases in this language.\n\nConversational – you can communicate on everyday topics with minor grammar or vocabulary mistakes but you can’t write in this language.\n\nFluent – you have the ability to express any idea without hesitation, with good vocabulary and grammar; people understand you easily. Both your spoken and written skills are good.\n\nProficient – different from fluent in the way that you now understand the structure of the language and you can explain how this language works to other people. You also can use idiomatic language and understand local accents.\n\nNow it’s your turn! Please answer these questions in the comments: How is your English? What is your level of English? What can you do in English?\n\nAdditionally\n\nTHINKING Phrasal Verbs and Idioms | Vocabulary Quiz\n\nEnglish Numbers | Listening Test\n\nCheck your conversation skills in English\n\nGrammar Quiz: So do I / Neither do I"
