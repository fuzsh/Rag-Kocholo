        "text": "We all know how Tongues and Comprehend Languages are meant to work: PCs can read any non-magical language or speak to any creature and avoid having the game grind to a halt while they play charades or visit libraries and scholars. That's fine but what I am interested in is the limits of the spells and how they might fail or give misleading results.\n\nHow faithful is the translation? To what extent do they convey cultural content? For instance, in Norway for many years, and to an extent today, 'krigen' (lit. 'the war') referred to WWII unless context made it clear you were speaking of some other war. Would Tongues pick up on this and convey it correctly or would the listener have to ask which war?\n\nWould Gandalf have instantly understood the door of Moria was \"say 'friend', and enter\" if he had cast CL instead of relying on this knowledge of Sindarin?\n\nAre homonyms/homographs explained? Do the spells explain puns and double entendres? Could you understand the multi-layer meanings of, e.g. certain Japanese poems? Are idioms, common sayings and memes translated and explained? Will words that have different meanings of the same word at different points in time be explained?\n\nIf my group is anything to go by, everything is just translated into our native tongue and whatever linguistic oddities and uncertainties there are are magically translated into our tongue with all its cultural flavors and biases or ignored. This is because even if people know more than one language, thinking of translations and the problems of two or more in a general sense is something they don't usually do.\n\nIs this something anyone else has thought about?\n\npauljathome wrote:\n\nYou do realize that you're getting into very deep philosophical and linguistic issues, right?\n\nThat's the point. I know how and why the spells are intended to work, I usually use them as intended, I just want to think and get input on a more detailed and consequential level.\n\npauljathome wrote:\n\nThere is no such thing as a perfect translation of any significant work from one language to another. Some information is nearly ALWAYS lost. There is a reason that real scholars of works like the Bible go back to the oldest texts that they can find.\n\nI know. I speak more than one language and have a smattering of a couple more. I have studied philology and etymology and semantics, that's why I made this thread.\n\nI'm trying to figure out to what degree and how these spells translate stuff.\n\npauljathome wrote:\n\nI think that the spells are assumed to be as good as a professional translator would be. Good enough for most practical purposes.\n\nWhat's a professional translator? Someone who gets paid to do it? You get all sorts of horrible Engrish from 'professionals'. Proper translations have to take into account a lot of stuff beyond dictionary definitions. Take Gaiman's \"American Gods\": because the French for Wednesday isn't a variant of 'Odin's day', the whole bit about \"it's my day so call me Wednesday\" wouldn't make sense and they had to rename him and rewrite the scene.\n\nNow you could easily say this is exactly the sort of thing the spells would miss and you'd get \"it's my do so call me Mercredi\". Then you'd have to do some digging into the languages proper and culture to get the right god, if this if it were a plot point in some game, but why would it fail to do that but still manage to get idioms, metaphors and ellipsis?\n\npauljathome wrote:\n\nHow they'd work on what is essentially a riddle in the \"Speak friend and enter\" is up to GM interpretation. Personally, I'd probably handle that as a linguistics check with a bonus if you spoke the language.\n\nI know it's up to GM interpretation. I'm trying to interpret it. I'm trying to get a handle on how these spells work so I can give consistent interpretations instead of just doing whatever is convenient for me at any given time.\n\nClaxon wrote:\n\nYeah the Moria riddle would only get you the literal translation of the elvish, \"Speak/Say friend and enter\". Both are correct, and sense this is a made up language it's hard to know which is more correct.\n\nBut translating an ambiguous statement to an unambiguous one because of the necessities of the target language is the problem. The spell would either have to make a choice about which sense to use, or it will have to give specific knowledge the problem, which basically solves the issue. In the case of the Moria inscription, if Gandalf had used CL and the fact that the tricky verb could be transitive or intransitive, he'd have the right answer right then and there. The problem came about because he was stuck thinking about one possible solution and forgetting the other.\n\nClaxon wrote:\n\nRegardless, there's totally room for Comprehend Language to only give you the literal meaning of something and provide no useful context.\n\nI lean heavily this way, but there is still the problem of dead metaphors and phrases which have lost their poetic meaning and became standard meanings in their own right. Failing to translate these would still leave many texts partially unreadable, and would indicate that the spell can't do synonyms. And assuming the spells can't do metaphorical language but can do dead metaphors, how will it translate stuff that has the same form but different states of metaphorical 'life' due to differing ages?\n\nThere is also the problem of grammar and phrasing. The spell has to do more than mere word substitution to be of much use to anyone who doesn't have a general understanding of linguistics and the source language. It has to get the grammar of the target language mostly right, so we can end up with the spell making choices about the source text that are misleading. Japanese, for instance, can omit things like subjects, objects and other grammatical elements which are mostly necessary in English, which leads us to question whether the spell can correctly supply the missing elements, will it be forced to make choices which may give the wrong impression, will it fail entirely? In the case of ambiguities, will you get the same result if you cast the spell multiple times? Will other people get the same result as you?\n\nClaxon wrote:\n\nA great example I can think of is the Chinese jia you (加油). The literal meaning is \"add fuel\" or more specifically to \"fill a car with gasoline\". But the general usage of the phrase is actually encouragement, meaning something along the lines of \"You can do it!\".\n\nExactly! But if this is such a common phrase that it literally in the minds of Chinese speakers (which language, btw?) it means 'you can do it' and they don't think of the literal meanings of the composite words, then isn't the meaning of the phrase 'you can do it', rather than 'to fill with gasoline'?\n\nJoeElf wrote:\n\nOr for simplicity, you could say \"no language in game has homonyms or idioms that the characters can't figure out once someone has access to the language.\" There's really no reason to hamstring the adventure by playing that every language is roughly equivalent to English in its [not \"it's\"] use of confusing homonyms too [not \"to\" or \"two\"]. Of course, if you want to make every conversation require not only a language spell, but also some Linguistics check, feel free.\n\nI'm not doing this thread for simplicity's sake. I could just say all game languages are glosses of Norwegian or English and be done with it, but that is boring and actively unfun. I don't hamstring adventures with this either. I'm trying to figure out how to have the fun of many languages and their quirks without making it unfun for my players and not just handwaving everything away. I'm lucky in that my players tend to load up on Linguistics so they can usually handle most languages they come across, but magic is sometimes necessary and always makes me ask 'how is it doing this?'.\n\nIf I can figure out how CL and T work and what their limits are, I can add more fun linguistic elements (especially linguistic, cultural and historical research) into certain adventures without going 'I cast one low-level spell and solve it all'.\n\nBecause that's what we've been doing so far. The point of the spells (as I've already noted) is not to bog down the game with pointless communication problems of being stuck when all you want to know is which way is north. If communication isn't meant to be a plot point, the spells work fine. If communication and understanding of intricacies is important, the spells need some better definition of abilities."
