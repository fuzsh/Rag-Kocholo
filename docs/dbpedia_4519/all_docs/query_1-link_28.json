        "text": "10 Tips on how to speak English fluently\n\nThese are our top tips for how to improve your English speaking fluency! No matter your level of English right now, if you put these tips to work, you should see your fluency in English improve over time.\n\n1. Practice listening and speaking\n\nWhen it comes to building English fluency, one of the most important things you can do is get practice actually using the language.\n\nAccording to Oxford Languages, “fluency” is defined as the ability to speak and write with ease and accuracy. Many exercises in English courses focus on the written language, but it’s important to make the leap to listening and speaking without written text if you want to become more comfortable with the language, especially if you want to be able to use it in a work environment where you’d need to be able to listen and respond quickly.\n\nThat’s why, at Busuu, we use dialogues and speaking exercises to help you learn to listen and practice speaking out loud from the get-go.\n\n2. Make a plan and stick to it\n\nTo reach true fluency is to be as proficient as possible in a language. Frankly, that takes work! One of the best things you can do to build your English fluency is to create a schedule for your learning and stick to it. At Busuu, our experts recommend making a habit out of learning by tying lessons to something you already do daily – for example, taking an English lesson with your morning coffee or doing one as part of your bedtime routine. If you can seamlessly integrate learning into your day, it’ll be easier to keep going and making progress.\n\nWhen you learn English with Busuu, you can easily track your progress and create a Study Plan to make sure you stay on track to meet your goals. A Study Plan can help you figure out what you need to do to reach a level of fluency by a specific date and help remind you to keep showing up and getting the learning done.\n\nAnd we’re not just telling you this because we’re Study Plan fans. Statistically, learners on Busuu who create Study Plans tend to learn more and faster than those who don’t!\n\n3. Become pronunciation obsessed\n\nWhile English grammar tends to be pretty flexible, English pronunciation is famously tricky. If you want to get your English fluency levels up, working on your pronunciation can help! A better grasp of English pronunciation can improve not just how much other people understand you, but also your ability to identify words when you hear them.\n\nSince pronunciation is such a big part of building your fluency in English, Busuu has a dedicated set of lessons focusing solely on English pronunciation.\n\n4. Learn from native English speakers\n\nWith any language, going from the version of the language you learn in lessons to the way people actually use the language in real life can be challenging. Pronunciation, grammar, intonation, and slang can all make it difficult to sound like a native speaker, even when your English is otherwise perfect.\n\nWant to know how to develop English speaking fluency? Learn English with support from native speakers! Fortunately, when you learn with Busuu, you get tips and feedback on your writing and pronunciation from English speakers thanks to the Conversations feature.\n\nAnd, if you need a little extra support, you can always get one-on-one tutoring from an experienced English tutor on Verbling.\n\n5. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes\n\nStudies show that we learn faster when we learn more like children, trying out our growing language skills with abandon and fumbling through our mistakes! Trial and error is part of figuring out how to actually use a language, so don’t be afraid to take a leap. That’s how to achieve fluency in English!\n\nYou could attend English-language events, practice with English speakers in your life, or even travel or move to an English-speaking place to learn through immersion.\n\nIn the meantime, be bold in your shared exercises on Busuu and our awesome community of native English speakers can help you learn from your mistakes! Plus, Smart Review will automatically capture vocabulary and grammar you’ve struggled with during lessons, so mistakes simply become quiz questions for later practice.\n\n6. Put books (and audiobooks!) to work\n\nFor many language learners, one of the hurdles to fluency is learning to listen and understand without training wheels (like written versions of what’s being said).\n\nOne way to start building this skill is to alternate between reading and listening to a book. Listen as much as you can, then use the written text to support you when you hear something you don’t understand. There are books for every level of English reader, so you can put this technique to work at all English fluency levels. Don’t be afraid to start with books for younger audiences as you get started!\n\nThe news and podcasts can also be great for this – the more you can train yourself to understand spoken English in realtime, the closer you’ll get to fluency in English. And learning from unique sources can help you build vocabulary and learn to understand a range of English accents and dialects.\n\n7. Sing your way to fluency\n\nWho says language learning has to be boring? Another way to learn how to speak English fluently is by mimicking native speakers. You can repeat after your favorite TV show characters or listen to music and learn the lyrics to your favorite English language songs. You could work toward fluency at karaoke, how fun is that?\n\nFrom Beyoncé to The Beatles, there are tons of great English musicians to love – just make sure you know what you’re saying (and what’s appropriate to say and in what context) before putting any new slang or phrases to use in the real world!\n\n8. Keep learning in your downtime\n\nAnother way to build your English fluency quickly is to add more English media into your couch time. There’s a whole world of English language TV and movies out there for you to learn from!\n\nTo get a real boost, try rewatching a favorite show, turning subtitles on and off, in your native language and in English. Take notes on words and phrases you don’t recognize and look them up next time you’re studying. Repeat this until you can understand a whole episode or movie without help and you’ll be on your way to fluency!\n\nAs an added bonus, whether you’re studying one episode or binging a whole series, all that exposure to American or British accents will help you develop a better ear for your own spoken language. As with music, try repeating back what you hear – just choose wisely which characters you want to emulate! (Check out our article on learning a new language with Netflix and discover how it works!)\n\n9. Practice English when you’re alone\n\nHere’s another tip for how to improve English speaking fluency: talk to yourself (yes, really!).\n\nPractice narrating what you’re doing, recapping your day, or thinking to yourself in English when you’re alone. When you get stuck, look up any words you’re missing or try to find ways around it – making yourself understood even when you forget a word is an important skill for fluency too!\n\nYou can even fake a phone call and practice talking to yourself out loud alone in public, if you’re brave enough.\n\n10. Celebrate your successes!\n\nLast but certainly not least, don’t forget to congratulate yourself when you finish a lesson or pass a milestone! Reaching English fluency is hard, and the effort you put in, no matter how far you get, is worth celebrating.\n\nMany language learners fall off because it’s challenging and they lose heart and motivation. Remind yourself why you want to be fluent in English and keep showing up and you’ll have plenty to congratulate yourself on."
