        "text": "I never thought I would be able to get rid of my strong Chinese accent... Then I discovered this app. It helped me identify issues with my pronunciation that I was not aware of... There’s already a vast improvement with my speech.\n\nGuany\n\nI love this app!! It helps me speak English fluently and fix my strong accent. I can see my improvement clearly after 3 months of use... when I try to speak in Google Translate, it is correct nearly 85% of the time, which is much more than before.\n\nJoy\n\nThis app is great. I’m that person that NEVER writes reviews. It’s that good... Amazing easy interface for everyday use, and great discounts; I bought the full version for a year. God bless you developers ❤️\n\nDun\n\nMy English teacher recommended this app to me. I tried and it really works! My pronunciation was very bad. After using the app, I find that my speaking skill improves day by day. Thank you team!\n\nMy\n\nELSA feels 5 years ahead of the competition. I’ve been using it for months and made lots of progress on both my ability to perceive some nuances of the American accent I couldn’t quite grasp before, and of course in producing the sounds more natively.\n\nGiovanni\n\nThe app is simply amazing. It has a lot of different tools to help you learn everything about the language. I almost didn’t believe when I saw how many lessons it has. It has a gorgeous layout, and the voice that helps you don’t seem like a robot.\n\nCauã\n\nOne of the few apps that I’ve ever bought. It’s really helpful, even the free version you can practice pronunciation with “Dictionary” or “Study Plans.” If you buy it, it tailors lessons for your needs.\n\nLuciano\n\nThe best app I’ve ever used. I really improved my English with it. Not only pronunciation, fluency, intonation, word stress and listening. But also vocabulary and grammar in an active learning way that makes me feel better and more confident when I speak.\n\nBrahim"
