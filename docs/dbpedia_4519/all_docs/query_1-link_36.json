        "text": "For whatever reason, sometimes you want to have characters speak in that pseudo- biblical/Shakespearean English of thee and thou and shalt. Before we get into the most popular of these words and a guide to using them correctly, let’s make one thing clear: no one ever actually spoke like this:\n\nThou art beautiful, like the sun and moon. I loveth thee with all\n\nthat is mine own.\n\nThis is Modern English with some old-timey words thrown in. In fact, there is no such thing as “Olde English” in history. The language being aped here is Early Modern English (the English of the King James Bible scribes, Shakespeare, Milton, and the rest of the seventeenth-century-ish crowd), but it’s really inaccurate. Here’s a bit of Milton’s original text of Paradise Lost:\n\nSo spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain,\n\nVaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:\n\nAnd him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer\n\nAnd a bit of the King James Bible, not revised:\n\nAnd the earth brought foorth grasse, and herbe yeelding seed\n\nafter his kinde, and the tree yeelding fruit, whose seed was in it\n\nselfe, after his kinde: and God saw that it was good. (Gen. 1:12)\n\nIt gets a bit more modern when you update the spelling, but it’s still not structured or punctuated in the language we speak now.\n\nSo, yes, “Olde English” is all made up, but the individual words themselves did exist in general conversation, and they do come with grammar rules.\n\nThou vs. Thee\n\nYou can’t just throw these into a sentence. Thouis for the subject of the sentence (along with I, we, and they), and thee is for the object (along with me, us, and them).\n\nThou complaineth constantly.\n\nI will give thee a hiding.\n\nAdditionally, thy works like thou, never like thee. So:\n\nThy shalt rue the day. (correct)\n\nI will give this to thy. (incorrect)\n\nThyn (Old English), thyne (Middle English), and thine(current spelling) are all “your.”\n\nTo thine own self be true. (correct)\n\nThine is the power over the land and sea. (correct)\n\nI will see thine die. (incorrect)\n\nVerbs and Their Wacky Endings\n\nThou shalt die.\n\nThe Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.\n\nThou art a scoundrel.\n\nDost thou love me?\n\nDoth thou love me?\n\nIn English’s first centuries, spelling was pretty much all over the place. The language, after all, is a commerce-driven amalgam of Latin, Greek, German, French, Spanish, Yiddish, and—who knows? Maybe there’s some Martian in there too. These various verb endings do not alter their definitions. Shalt and shall mean the exact same thing.\n\nWhat’s important with these is not the meaning but the tense. Shalt is in future tense. Giveth, doth, dost, and art are in present tense.\n\nThus, the line from The Avengers is correct: “Doth Mother know you weareth her drapes?” Good on you, Tony Stark.\n\nUnto\n\nAh, the good ol(d)e “Do unto others.” Unto just means to.\n\nBelov’d vs. Beloved\n\nNow, this is a fun one. The ways it gets misused—well, it’s pretty much always misused because it’s only relevant when you’re worrying about poetic meter. The apostrophe is a pronunciation guide. Belov’d is two syllables: be-loved. Beloved is (or used to be) three syllables: be-lov-ed. Let’s go back to the Bard for a demonstration:\n\n’tis a consummation\n\nDevoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep; (Hamlet 3.1)\n\nAll that “wish’d” thing is for is to make sure it’s one syllable to fit the iambic (unstressed/stressed) pentameter (five iambs):\n\ndeVOUTly TO be WISH’D. to DIE, to SLEEP\n\nToday, we don’t say “wish-ed,” so “wish’d” serves no purpose even in poetry.\n\nYe vs. The\n\nThis is also a fun one. While ye was used all the time for you (both as subject and as object), it was never, in fact, used for theuntil the Victorians thought it was cute to have signs that read Ye Olde-Timey Inn.\n\nThe mistake comes from what’s called a thorn. It’s one of those letters that didn’t make it into Modern English. Old English, Old Norse, Gothic, and Icelandic use it basically for “th.” It has a few shapes, many of them looking like a Y, but this is the idea:\n\nModern keyboards type it as þ. When in old tapestries, paintings, and drawings there was a sign reading þ Old Inn, this was simply The Old Inn. But Victorians read it as Ye Old Inn.\n\nSo, while the crumpets and scones you get from Ye Olde Bake Shoppe may taste authentic, the sign is not."
