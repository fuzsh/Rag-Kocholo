John Lee Hooker escaped with his guitars and his life from a fire that burned through the roof of his home in Los Altos, Calif.

The flames started in the bedroom of one of the bluesman's three housemates and caused about $400,000 in damage to the $1.5 million, eight-bedroom home Sunday. The fire is under investigation.One of Hooker's housemates cut his hand while breaking a window to save several cats, and a firefighter was burned on the wrists, Teresa Meisenbach, senior deputy fire marshal for the Santa Clara County Fire Department, said Monday.

"Everybody walked out," Meisenbach said.
