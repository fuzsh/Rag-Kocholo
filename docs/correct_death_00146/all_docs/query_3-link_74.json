From performing live with Buddy Guy and John Hiatt in theaters and arenas around the United States, to post-New Orleans Jazz Fest jamming on bayou rhythms with Oteil Burbridge and Johnny Vidacovich, to recording and playing live with ukulele phenom Jake Shimabukuro at The Blue Note in Hawaii, it’s been a noteworthy couple of years for the two-time Grammy nominee. And those are just his side projects.“One of the things I love about collaborations with other artists is the element of surprise,” Landreth says of his continually expanding musical horizons. “When the chemistry is there, it’s always inspiring to find new twists and turns that up the game creatively.” Landreth tours regularly in a duo with fellow slide guitar ace Cindy Cashdollar as well as with his own electric and acoustic trio. From every edition of Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festival to Wintergrass to Camp Cripple Creek for Jim Weider’s The Weight Band and beyond, Landreth and his musical partners are always reaching for the unexpected and unexplored. He’s twice graced the cover of Guitar Player magazine, and he’s featured on the lead track of Shemekia Copeland’s Grammy-nominated album Done Come Too Far.Stretching in different directions, Landreth says, “gives you a broader perspective – and I think that impacts every aspect of making music. I know it’s helped to make our shows more memorable and more fun for everyone onstage and in the audience too.”\n\n•Landreth apprenticed with zydeco king Clifton Chenier’s Red Hot Louisiana Band and a host\n\nof other accomplished roots artists.\n\n•Landreth’s innovative guitar techniques have opened doors to new sonic textures and a complex tonal vocabulary. His expressive, ethereal guitar work can be heard on hundreds of recordings from artists ranging from John Mayall to Irma Thomas.\n\nhttps://sonnylandreth.com/\n\nTickets: Sold Out!

A childhood passion for Country, Doo-Wop, and Rhythm & Blues 45s led Sandy (born Robert Williams) to pursue a singing career as a teenager, beginning a life in music that continues decades later. And as his personal record collection continues to grow (75,000 and counting), so does the depth of the musical influences that stream through his songwriting and singing style A critically acclaimed tribute to Tex-Mex hero Freddy Fender, released at the beginning of the 2020 lockdown, points the way forward for Big Sandy and His Fly-Rite Boys as they continue on a path of musical growth. After nearly 35 years on the road, and more than two dozen releases to their credit, they remain key figures on the ever-changing Americana circuit, both on record and in live appearances.\n\nhttps://www.bigsandy.net/\n\nTickets: $25 advance, $30 day of show and on sale now at https://abilene.showare.com/ and at the bar\n\nView Event →\n\nLife Skills, Alex Northrop and the Darlingtones\n\nDoors 4pm, Music 8pm\n\nLife Skills\n\nThey are a new wave/psych/pop group.

The band plays classics that include unique takes on the Grateful Dead, Wilco, Herbie Hancock, and Bob Dylan. As young musicians, the band rocks audiences with an unexpected serious sound that resonates across generations.\n\nBrody Schenk, on lead guitar, guides the band on a musical odyssey with concise rhythms and organic solo riffs that often take listeners to rock’s edge before reuniting with the band. Schenk, a Penfield native, plays across musical genres with a passion typically seen in older guitarists.\n\nInfluenced by great bass players including Phil Lesh, Geddy Lee, and Chris Squire, Jackson Wade, plays bass guitar with deep roots in the cello. Wade delivers funky complex rhythms that give The Old Souls Band a rich and tasty foundation for rock.\n\nNoah Lester commands the drums while influenced by greats including John Bonham and Roger Guth, Lester drives The Old Souls Band with consistent beats and time changes that keep the band in clock-work transition and on point.\n\nTrevor Smith, alto saxophone, is the glue that binds The Old Souls Band guitar, bass, and drums with a soulful sophistication that elevates the band’s sound. His unique style reflects that of Nirvana and Pearl Jam with the added challenge of presenting his influences on saxophone. Being well versed in other genres such as blues/jazz Trevor uses his specific skill set to lift the band to the next level.\n\nSee why The Abilene Bar and Lounge crowds say, “The Old Souls Band” leaves you wanting more!”\n\nhttps://www.oldsoulsband.com/\n\nCover: $10\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Rubinoos!\n\nDoors 4pm, Music 7:30pm\n\nThe Rubinoos\n\nFrom boy band to one of the best power pop bands in the world, The Rubinoos are a must see. Best friends since junior high school, Jon Rubin and Tommy Dunbar started gigging in their\n\nteens. Based in Berkeley California, The Rubinoos were quickly snapped up by visionary label Beserkley Records along withstablemates Jonathan Richman and Greg Kihn. The band gained\n\nnational prominence with their 1977 debut LP, The Rubinoos..Renowned rock critic, Gene Sculatti, called it “the best popalbum of the decade.”\n\nThe Rubinoos have since gone on to release numerous albums with the help of iconic musician/producers such as ToddRundgren, Kevin Gilbert, and most recently Americana staple\n\nChuck Prophet. Over the years the band has developed a broadnternational audience having shared the stage with the likes of Elvis Costello and Tom Petty. Their infectious sound has\n\nappeared in multiple feature films and TV shows. The band’s television debut was on the legendary “Dick Clark's American Bandstand.” They sang the title theme song of the cult classic\n\n“Revenge of the Nerds” and their top 40 hit “I Think We’re Alone Now” opened the third season of the Netflix hit comedy “Sex Education.”\n\nMost recently signed to the well respected boutique label Yep Roc Records (Nick Lowe, Dave Alvin, Chuck Prophet), The Rubinoos have never been busier and continue to draw crowds\n\nworldwide. Playing regularly in Japan, Europe, and festivals and clubs across the United States, the band is bringing Power Pop to a whole new generation.\n\nhttps://rubinoos.com/\n\nTickets: $20 advance, $25 day of show and on sale now at https://abilene.showare.com/ and at the bar\n\nView Event →\n\nHarmonica Lewinski with Jazz Goons\n\nDoors 6:30pm, Music 7:30pm\n\nHarmonica Lewinski\n\nOut for kicks, Harmonica Lewinski plays music that has been called “tropical trash, greasy garage, dirty disco, and party punk.” In between touring the USA and releasing a slew of vinyl and cassette tapes, they have built a following with their original sound and dance-party live shows. Calling all freaks – get to the go-go.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/harmonicalewinski666/\n\nJazz Goons\n\nJazz Goons sound like Buddy Holly’s Beechcraft Bonanza crashing into a snowy corn field, Little Richards heel banging piano keys, and the glass scratching against Iggy Pops chest.

Way Papa Muse and The Lit Muse with Spec Guests: Mr. Heartache\n\nDoors 2pm, Music 3pm\n\nWay Papa Muse and The Lit Muse\n\nDescribed as \"Indie World,\" Papa Muse blends rock and world music with catchy hooks and funky dance-able grooves. Papa Muse has been compared to the Talking Heads, Rusted Root, Paul Simon, Devo and Rush. It's danceable and intelligent music.\n\nThe songs are polished and often move in different directions to make them unpredictable and fresh. The lyrics are meaningful and often present an altruistic vision for humanity, deep yet relatable and easy to digest.\n\nThe live show is dynamic and interactive, so while the message behind the music can be deep and introspective, the live show is light, whimsical and fun. \"I want to inspire a sense of community empowerment and affect positive change, but without sounding preachy, so I try to keep my live show light and fun while singing about what matters most to me.\"\n\nhttps://papamuse.com/music\n\nMr. Heartache\n\nMr. Heartache is a five piece band performing a stripped down, straight ahead brand of American roots music fronted by country music archivist Jim Schleich on vocals and acoustic guitar in conjunction with Los Angeles native Roy Berns on electric guitar, Lynn Lindsay on vocals. The backline consists of Scott McNitt on drums and Eric Huppert on the Fender electric bass.\n\nHeavily influenced by the definitive sounds of Southern California country music of times past, Mr. Heartache weaves a tapestry of songs making forays into country blues, western swing, folk inspired ballads and spirited instrumentals that introduce new generations of listeners to classic material , keeping the honky tonk flame burning brightly.\n\nServing up Americana from the golden era of country and western.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MrHeartacheRochester\n\nSpecial Low-Dough Show…Only Fifteen Bucks at the Door\n\nView Event →\n\nIgor and the Red Elvises-Summer 2024!\n\nDoors 6pm, Music 7:30pm\n\nIgor & The Red Elvises\n\nIgor Yuzov was born in Germany, raised in Ukraine and studied in Russia. He grew up in the former Soviet Union, where folk music was the norm and rock'n'roll was illegal. A rebellious streak, however, led him to seek out the forbidden music. As soon as it became possible, Igor left Russia for America with his “Folk'n'Roll\" band Limpopo and was personally greeted by Ronald Reagan. In 1993, Limpopo won Ed McMahon's Star Search and their popularity began to blossom. In 1995, Igor dreamed that Elvis Presley came to him and told him to start playing rock'n'roll. Igor and his Russian friends became Red Elvises and gave street performances on Santa Monica's 3rd Street Promenade. As their crowds grew larger, the City of Santa Monica ordered them to discontinue their street performances. Evolving over the years, Igor’s music has been labeled \"Siberian Surf Rock” which contains humorous lyrics and grooves that forces his audience to dance. Over the past 20 years, Red Elvises have constantly toured all over the world with occasional breaks to record new music and to participate in film and television projects.\n\nAs an independent band, Red Elvises have produced 12 studio albums, two live albums, a live concert DVD, and a Greatest Hits compilation. Some of their most notable film contributions include music and or performances in “Six String Samurai”, “Mail Order Bride”, “Armageddon”, “Skippy”, “Melrose Place”, “Fastlane\", “Penn and Teller's Sin City Extravaganza”, “VH-1 Behind the Music”, and “MTV”. Red Elvises have performed for large festivals, private parties, and played on massive stages such as 2005's Live 8 Benefit Concert. No matter where they perform, Igor & Red Elvises always bring the party with them!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/igorandredelvises/\n\nTickets: $15 advance, $20 day of show and on sale now at https://abilene.showare.com/ and at the bar\n\nView Event →\n\nBill Kirchen and Band\n\nDoors 6pm, Music 7:30pm\n\nBill Kirchen and Band\n\nUpon tallying how many decades he’s worked as a professional guitar slinger, Telecaster master Bill Kirchen quips, “Well, they don't make 50 years like they used to.” They don’t often make careers like his, either.\n\nFrom performing with his Who Knows Pickers jug band in Ann Arbor High School’s senior talent show (also on the program: the future Iggy Pop), to birthing the Americana genre with the original “hippie country band,” Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen, this affable Austinite has been everywhere, man, flying alongside some of the planet’s coolest cats — including the Jesus of Cool, Nick Lowe, and Lowe’s old protégé, Elvis Costello.\n\nKirchen has toured the world with Lowe, who produced an album by Kirchen’s post-Airmen band, the Moonlighters, and Costello recruited Kirchen for high-profile gigs like the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival — and even named his festival band after Kirchen’s Hammer of the Honky-Tonk Gods album. Lowe appears on that 2006 album, and its 2010 follow-up, Word to the Wise, along with Costello, Maria Muldaur, Dan Hicks and other luminaries.\n\nNow those albums, plus Kirchen’s third Proper Records release, 2013’s Seeds and Stems, are being combined with three bonus tracks from Transatlantica, his 2016 project with pub-rock progenitor Austin de Lone, as a two-CD retrospective titled The Proper Years. Waxworks, is a vinyl best-of version of the full collection.\n\nA well-balanced mix of engaging originals and wonderfully rendered covers, The Proper Years admirably conveys Kirchen’s versatility as a player and singer — one of the first to mash up rockabilly, country, western swing, honky-tonk, jump blues, jazz, boogie-woogie and even the “psychedelic folk rock” he played with the Seventh Seal, the band he formed while attending the University of Michigan. (MC5 manager/activist John Sinclair got them a dealon the ESP-Disk label, home of Sun Ra, but the band turned it down.)\n\nSomewhere between steering Commander Cody’s “Hot Rod Lincoln” into a top-10 hit and scoring a Grammy nomination for Best Country Instrumental Performance, Kirchen dubbed his sound “dieselbilly,” wrapping his fondness for country’s truck-driving song subgenre (as in big rigs, not pickups), its intersection with the Bakersfield Sound and his own name into one memorable moniker.\n\nKirchen’s right-place-at-the-right-time career has put him at the forefront of many musical movements, including outlaw country; Commander Cody’s 1974 album, Live from Deep in the Heart of Texas, recorded at Austin’s legendary Armadillo World Headquarters, made Rolling Stone’s 100 Best Albums of All Time list.\n\nBut whatever label Kirchen’s music wears, it’s always notable for its balance of high-octane energy and deft understatement. There’s no leadfoot excess; Kirchen’s all about finesse — a sensibility absorbed from the symphonies and Broadway musicals his parents loved, along with the orchestral works he played as a school-band trombonist. Through another major influence, Interlochen Center for the Arts summer camp counselor David Siglin (who would go on to run famed Ann Arbor venue the Ark), Kirchen became immersed in folk traditions and learned to love the “big, sonorous tones” of an undistorted guitar. “I was more interested in sounding like Doc Watson than Eric Clapton,” admits Kirchen, whose main guitar was crafted by Rick Kelly of Carmine Street Guitars from 200-year-old pine floorboards recycled from film director Jim Jarmusch’s loft.\n\nIt’s fitting that this collection begins with his ode to that Telly-modeled “stick of wood” he calls “the bicycle of the electric guitar —the most efficient way to get from point A to point B.” That song also serves as exhibit A in a collection showcasing a central facet of Kirchen’s songwriting: his wit. If there’s a laugh to be reached for — or stooped to —Kirchen’s goin’ for it; you don’t survive years in a band named Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen, or drop album titles like Seeds and Stems, without possessing a gleefully subversive, double-entendre-loving funny bone. “I like music where at least someone onstage is smiling sometimes, fer crissake,” jokes Kirchen, who’s often grinning happily when he’s not busy singing.\n\nBut for every injection of humor, there’s an equal dose of heart (and in some cases, heartbreak). And songs like “Tell Me the Reason” or “Get a Little Goner” illustrate another truism: Kirchen often sets the saddest or mostbiting lyrics to the jauntiest melodies. Those two were cowritten by his wife, Louise; “Goner” also features frequent contributor Sarah Brown (coincidentally also raised in Ann Arbor).\n\nKirchen likes collaborating; on Word to the Wise, a musical reminiscence of sorts, he tapped several favorite artists to join him, carefully selecting or writing songs for each. In the liner notes, he explains, “The criteria we used were that you had to be A) someone I had actually played with, either on stage or record, and B) not dead yet.” Sadly, Norton Buffalo, who played harmonica with the Airmen and Moonlighters, passed away shortly after recording “Valley of the Moon” — in which Kirchen revisits scenes of his early life with Louise on a trip to attend a funeral (for Hacienda Brother Chris Gaffney, another musical mate). Dan Hicks, who delivered a note-perfect duet on the title tune — written for him —died in 2016. But as of this writing, Lowe, Costello, Maria Muldaur, Paul Carrack, original Asleep at the Wheel vocalist Chris O’Connell and Commander Cody (aka George Frayne) are still very much with us.\n\nKirchen’s entertaining liner notes explain his connection to each, tracing many of these relationships directly to longtime collaborator and “mainman” Austin de Lone, who appears on all three solo albums and shares billing on Transatlanticana. Philadelphia-born keyboardist de Lone and his band, Eggs Over Easy, moved to England in 1970, urged by Jimi Hendrix’s manager, Chas Chandler. Their rootsy mix of blues, country and rock caught on — and germinated the pub rock movement, whose acolytes included Brinsley Schwarz, in which Lowe played bass. In 1972, de Lone moved to California, where he met Kirchen. Years later, de Lone wound up joining the Moonlighters and introducing Kirchen to Lowe, who produced the band’s 1983 album, Rush Hour (and introduced Kirchen to Costello). That album was engineered by Paul Riley, who eventually would produce all four of Kirchen’s Proper Records albums.\n\nA devoted Anglophile, thanks to two aunts who married Brits, Kirchen began recording for the label after owner Malcolm Mills promised, “I'm going to give you the best deal you've had in 25 years.” He did, too. Mills not only supports Kirchen’s recorded output, he also supports the guitarist on stage, right alongside bassist Riley. “Where else do you get a record company where the owner plays drums, the producer plays bass, and they tour with you?” Kirchen says of his good friends. “They’re the best.”\n\nThat’s just another twist in an incredible career trajectory set in motion, according to Kirchen, by two pivotal events: the 1964 and ’65 Newport Folk Festivals. As a high-school kid on a quest to catch Mississippi John Hurt, he thumbed to the first one, then went back the following year — and witnessed Dylan going electric. “That pretty well blew away the competition for what I was going to do before, or if, or when I grew up,” he says of those experiences.\n\nFive years later, he found himself sharing a bill with John Lennon, Yoko Ono and Stevie Wonder, when Commander Cody and the Airmen, who’d formed in Ann Arbor, played a benefit for Sinclair after he got 10 years for two joints. A mere 50 years later, Kirchen’s still having a blast. He’s even planning another tour with Riley and Mills. But releasing this package, he says, “nicely puts a bow on a whole, very enjoyable period of my life.”\n\n“Not that it's over,” he adds quickly. “I mean, I've got more stuff in the works.”\n\nThen he cracks, “Don’t tell anybody, but it's not as hard as it looks.”\n\nhttps://www.billkirchen.com/official\n\nTickets: $27 advance, $32 day of show and on sale now at https://abilene.showare.com/ and at the bar\n\nBig thanks to Bop Shop Records for all their support.

But the Americana singer/songwriter, whose early 2019 album \"Into the Blue\" earned her accolades from across the country and the world, used the time in lockdown to start a brand new duo project with her friend Caitlin Cannon called Side Pony. Side Pony released their debut album \"Lucky Break\" in October of 2021 to rave reviews and spent the better part of a year and a half zigzagging across the country on tour, including stages at the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, the Hudson West Folk Festival, and even tours through England and Spain.\n\nAnd now that the world is regaining a sense of normalcy, Alice is getting prepared to release a new solo record to feature the many songs she's written since moving to Nashville - songs about coming to love her new home in Tennessee, songs about navigating her life as a touring artist and the relationships that come and go as a result, and songs that truly tap into what Alice does best when she stands on a stage behind a microphone.\n\n\"Wallace’s voice is a powerful natural occurrence...an awe-striking wonder of the West,\" said Saving Country Music.\n\nBack in 2017, Alice was named the Female Vocalist of the Year at the California Country Awards. Her vocal power and control is one of the first things noted in every review she ever receives, and this new batch of songs puts that power on full display . Her vocal style draws influence from iconic voices ranging from Linda Ronstadt to Patsy Cline, not to mention keeping the country yodel alive with songs from classic artists like Patsy Montana and Don Walser.\n\nHERE I AM -- Alice Wallace\n\nHere I Am, Nashvillian songstress Alice Wallace declares on her new album, set for a spring 2024 release via Mule Kick Records. It’s a title that hints at her deeply personal, confessional songwriting style, one that invites the listener to gaze at her beating heart as each intimate secret pours out, propelled by a powerful, expressive delivery that marks her as one of the true vocal talents of her generation.\n\nAlice does not hide behind the microphone, but uses it to amplify everything inside her champing to get out. She’s survived the highs and lows of life, love, and the music industry and finally produced the album she feels she was destined to make. Here I Am, she says, the real Alice Wallace.\n\nThis album marks a return to themes of self-examination after several collections that featured predominantly story songs. “I needed to make a record that was really true to myself, both for me and for my fans who have encouraged me in ways I am so grateful for,” Alice explains. “Songs are how I process. And writing this album helped me process so much of what has happened in the last few years.”\n\nAlice moved to Nashville four years ago after more than a decade in southern California, and Here I Am is the first of her albums to be recorded in true Music City style, backed by a lineup of world-class musicians and recorded in two whirlwind days with no rehearsal, just the way the best session players like to do it. Produced by Nick Buda (Taylor Swift, Martina McBride, Dolly Parton) the album features some of the most talented musicians Nashville has to offer. In addition to Buda on drums, the record features Grammy-winning guitarist Kenny Greenberg (Willie Nelson, Wynnona Judd, Hayes Carll), bassist Ted Pecchio (Doyle Bramhall II, Susan Tedeschi) and keyboardist Jimmy Wallace (The Wallflowers). And although Alice had never played with any of the musicians before, the combined talents in the room made for an electric experience that brought her songs to life in vibrant and unexpected ways.\n\nThe album opens with a lone, droning organ note behind Alice’s voice as she tells of a secret she’s scared might someday be discovered.. But as the song “Imposter” builds to its celebratory peak, the listener learns it’s only Alice’s own self-doubt she’s afraid will come to light – that insidious inner voice that still tries to tell her she isn’t qualified to do what she does so well. It was actually the impending recording session with such musical powerhouses that triggered her to write about this lifelong feeling that has resonated with fans at every live show. Instead of succumbing to the fear, the song embraces it with confidence - “it’s time someone found me out.”\n\nOther highlight tracks include “Bonfire,” written with Melody Walker. Alice was experiencing a bout of romantic heartbreak, but sought something more than the tired cliche of a woman bearing a torch waiting for her man. So she went bigger, with the metaphor of a beachside bonfire acting as a makeshift lighthouse harkening her lover back from sea, her clarion voice calling out over syncopated percussion and musical waves.\n\n“Looking,” written with Eliot Bronson, also focuses on the search for love, but using a more modern metaphorical device, the device that’s ever-present in Alice’s hand. “Maybe the reason I haven’t found that elusive love of my life is because I walk around looking at my phone all day and am not paying enough attention to what’s around me,” Alice explains. Within the strong beat and poppy, radio-ready delivery, she vows to make an effort to see what’s right in front of her eyes, hoping the love she may have missed the first time will come around again.\n\nThe album’s remaining tracks touch on Alice’s move to Nashville with an ode to “Fireflies,” lean into pain while finding joy with “Dancin’ to the Beat of My Heartbreak,” lament not trusting her intuition on “I Was Wrong,” and celebrate the connectedness of the natural world with the title track “Here I Am.”\n\nWallace was named 2017 Female Vocalist of the Year by the California Country Awards and her voice has been called “a powerful natural occurrence… an awe-striking wonder\" by Saving Country Music. She previously released four solo albums, the latest of which, 2019’s Into the Blue, earned recognition from Rolling Stone Country with the title track being named one of the Best Americana Songs to Hear Now. This was followed by Lucky Break via Side Pony, a duo project with friend Caitlin Cannon that took the pair across the United States and Europe.\n\nCuttingly self-exploring, delivered with emotionality, and with just the right pop Americana sensibilities, Here I Am is Alice Wallace’s most expansive album yet. For fans of songwriters who turn personal heartbreak into musical gold and for anyone who loves a powerful, full-ranged, expressive voice, Here I Am is not to be missed.\n\nwww.AliceWallaceMusic.com\n\nCover: Special “Low-Dough Show”—Fifteen Bucks at the Door\n\nView Event →\n\nMothership-The Led Zeppelin Experience\n\nDoors 6:30pm, Music 7:30pm\n\nMothership-The Led Zeppelin Experience\n\nMOTHERSHIP is a 5-piece Led Zeppelin experience from Rochester, NY.\n\nYou’ve Been LED to the MOTHERSHIP\n\nA Premier Led Zeppelin Outfit\n\nA sole light appears like a beacon in the night sky.

McNally is a Zen-like, post-Beat song poet”. For those who have followed McNally’s nearly twenty year career the thing that most sticks with the listener about her, is the timeless effortlessness that she brings to all she does. With a long catalog and longer list of peers with whom she has written, recorded and toured, McNally continues to turn out great music that defies blatant genre-fication.\n\nAt home across the American (Americana) music spectrum, the Grammy nominee who’s live music career began on the jam band circuit of the 1990’s with bands like Robert Randolph and Derek Trucks, writes as well as she interprets the songs of others, has a top tier musicality to her craft, a soul stirring voice that immediately grabs one by the heart strings and a troubadour’s wanderlust, not to mention as it turns out, she is also an excellent electric guitar player.\n\nLike her anti-hero heros J.J. Cale, Tom Waits, Bob Dylan. Dr. John, and Jim Dickinson, McNally knows who she serves. She serves the song. Her quiet but steady plodding through the many layers of the business of music, hasn’t ever been rewarded with massive fame and fortune but in time that slow burn has become the treasure in and of itself.\n\nThe part of McNally’s narrative that is often missed is that not only has she self-managed herself for nearly all of her career but that she has also been a stout warrior-like-artist who often went toe-to-toe with label heads and A&R to defend and fight for her visions. She left the major label world after ten years at Capital/EMI to fend for herself on various smaller labels and self-release paradigms. Perhaps the business of music is finally catching up with her independent spirit.

Self-titled, the hard-working and gifted 19-year-old’s first album is a deeply lyrical and musical storytelling journey channeling his many influences — John Prine, Bob Dylan, Mississippi John Hurt, Keb Mo’, Taj Majal, Leonard Cohen, Jeff Tweedy, and other greats — while remaining uniquely Brody Schenk. Produced by Greg Gefell (who adds his lusciously warm pedal steel to numerous tracks) and with artwork by Alex Spacher, the debut album is available on all streaming platforms (and on CD), and contains 11 original songs written by Brody during his last years of high school before his recent graduation. His previously released and critically acclaimed original singles, Charlie Brown and Somewhere, Somehow are also widely available for streaming.\n\nBrody’s songs are informed by his far-beyond-his-years, old-soul wisdom, honesty, wit, vulnerability, and thoughtfulness. His highly adroit playing, mostly on acoustic guitar in this offering, creates an intimate listening experience: There’s no band here, just Brody genuinely playing and singing sophisticated arrangements — immediately evident on the first track, Cash To Your Name — abutting more traditional stylings, including his timely and socially poignant Independence Day, and the album’s closing track, Papa Was A Traveler, a nine-minute odyssey about a young man trying to connect with his vagabond father.\n\nBrody completed his solo tour of the East Coast this past Summer. Brody has opened for Tim Reynolds’ TR3, Melvin Seals and JGB, Cory Brannon, Sean Rowe, Giant Panda Guerrilla Dub Squad, among others. He also fronts the Rochester-based band, The Old Souls, and has accompanied Jack West on tour in NYC, LA, Seattle, and elsewhere.

Enjoy the country, folk, and Americana sounds of Trent Yule.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091465975305\n\nBrian Revels\n\nBrian Revels is energy and angst in a comet trail of music that is as perceptive as it is entertaining. He hearkens back to an earlier time, a bygone era when words were true and hearts were strong. His observations of Americana ring with authenticity, with the rawness of earth, the clarity of rainwater and the depth of the sky.\n\nHe’s a wily veteran of the Atlanta, Georgia music scene, a multi-instrumentalist, a natural-born storyteller with a poetic edge. He helped to build the band City Mouse into a regional force before it was finally time to step out on his own.\n\nHe’s from folk and blues and country and bluegrass, an alternative to them all and a better man for their influences. The hole he’s worn in his guitar is not as large as the one he’s worn in his heart with the cares of the lives he hopes he can redeem one song at a time.\n\nBe sure you see him now so you can say you knew him when – before the wider world discovers him and lifts him away. His timeless musicality will touch your soul with the drama and the significance, of love lost and regained, of the human frailty that reduces and yet ennobles each of us.\n\n- Papa Jack Couch, Songwriter\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/brianrevelsmusic/?facebook-page\n\nBradford Allen\n\nBradford is a multi-instrumentalist, singer/songwriter, and music producer from Central Upstate New York. His love for both live performance and recording is evident in his songs, crafted from triumph, tragedy, and everything in between. The respect and reverence for the art of music is clear in all his work, but Brad is not the kind to take himself too seriously. Onstage, he's not one to shy away from a bad joke or the chance to cheers a beer or three!\n\nPerforming live has become a way of life. Whether solo or as an ensemble (duo w/ Steve Romer, The Freeloaders) he has averaged 100 shows a year over the last half-decade (well, let's not count 2020). This musical journey has seen Brad perform at the most esteemed venues (Carnegie Hall) to the best local watering holes (gotta love the St. Charles!). He has also opened for and shared the stage with many prominent and diverse musicians.\n\nhttps://bradfordallenmusic.com/\n\nCover: $10 at the door\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Return of The Cliches with Special Guests\n\nDoors 3pm, Music 4pm\n\nThe Cliches\n\nRochester’s own Cliches were formed out of the ashes of short-lived band, The Orfans, in the Fall of 1979, after New Math front man Kevin Patrick convinced Record Theater clerk, Jeff Laben, that he should give it a go. Fellow Orfan and ex-No Longer Strangers guitar player Geoff Proud started writing original songs with Laben and they were soon joined by fellow St John Fisher College student and guitar virtuoso John Perevich (former The Now, The Times). After using Berkeley Music School attendee Tom Backus’s drums to audition other drummers, they finally came to their senses and asked Backus to round out the foursome. Their first gig was opening for New Math at legendary punk club Scorgies in the fall of 1980.\n\nThe Cliches soon became a favorite at Scorgies and after a few months of opening for local bands like New Math, The Hi-Techs and the Chesterfield Kings, and national acts like the Ramones, The Go Go’s, Joan Jett, The Cramps, and Johnny Thunders, among others, they soon found themselves in demand as a headline act. With the national rise of punk and new wave as a tailwind, the band played over 100+ gigs at various bars, clubs and colleges, from Albany to Buffalo, in a 3 year period from 1980 through the spring of 1983. That summer, the band broke up amicably as the members moved on with their lives and careers.\n\nWith the exception of a one-night mini-show at a 30th birthday party in 1990, the band has been in hiding, with the 4 original members living in separate states up and down the east coast.\n\nNow, for the first time in 34 years, they will reunite for one night only at the historic Abilene Saloon in Rochester, NY on Sunday, August 18. The show will be in the late afternoon, in tribute to their aging fan base.\n\nAs former D&C Music Critic Dave Stearns once noted, The Cliches “are (were) embarrassingly stupid;” if that’s not a selling point, we are not sure what is. Regardless, August 18th will be your last chance to hate them, or, if you’re on the under-side of 40 years old, your first chance. Either way, you won’t want to miss this show.\n\nTickets: $10 advance, $15 day of show and on sale now at https://abilene.showare.com/ and at the bar\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Ladles with Benny Bleu\n\nDoors 7pm, Music 7:30pm\n\nThe Ladles\n\nBefore they were The Ladles — Katie, Caroline, and Lucia were the only three undergraduate women in New England Conservatory’s Contemporary Musical Arts program. Katie Martucci (guitar/vocals), Caroline Kuhn (banjo/vocals), and Lucia Pontoniere (fiddle/vocals) formed their trio after discovering an effortless chemistry playing music in their college dorm rooms. The group got its name from a mislabeled bathroom sign at the Conservatory that read “Ladles” instead of “Ladies.”\n\nEach member of the band stands alone as her own impressive artist, but for The Ladles, making music has never been about the individual. The Ladles cherish community, and they use their artistic magnetism to create a sense of connection and belonging for their audiences. In line with their collective nature, each member of The Ladles writes songs and sings lead vocals; there is no clear front-woman. Each Ladles voice has a unique texture, but the real “voice” of The Ladles is their signature harmonic blend. When The Ladles harmonize, you’ll swear you’re hearing one voice, somehow replete with delicious overtones that give them a fuller sound than you’d ever expect from a trio.\n\nTheir collective sound feels like The Staves hiking the Appalachian trail with the Punch Brothers. Their music defies definition by a singular genre, and they have put in the years to discover how their sound fits into (and expands) larger traditions. With influences from indie pop and old time to chamber and choral music -- The Ladles embody a rare balance of technical prowess, emotional intuition, and creative exploration.\n\nIn many ways, The Ladles have grown up together. They have navigated a decade of managing a bi-coastal band (NYC and SF), figuring out creative ways to collaborate during the pandemic, and being there for each other, both musically and personally, through the many challenges of their 20s. There’s something inextricable about the way The Ladles music has blossomed as they’ve grown together as people.\n\nAt a Ladles show, you can’t help but feel part of something bigger. When you’re swept up in their ethereal soundscapes, you can easily forget what separates you from the person next to you. You’ll feel a collective resonance. And that’s exactly what this band’s after, because, to The Ladles, everything’s better when shared.\n\nhttps://www.theladles.com/\n\nBenny Bleu\n\nIn an infinitely expanding universe nearly fourteen billion years in the making, let’s zoom in on a sleepy hillside in the Finger Lakes, where Benny Bleu Haravitch’s banjo rings out in harmony with it all. Through his lens as a geologist, he contemplates ages of ecological relationships in his folk music. Haravitch’s songwriting is compassionate and patient, but his instrumental offerings are equally profound. A compelling modern clawhammer banjoist, his playing is like a marching band – the bugle melodies in lock-step with the drum corps. On ‘March of the Mollusk’, a new album of mellow banjo tunes, Benny Bleu invites us to walk to the cadence of a snail through the woods, slow and in the flow. For only by softening our pace could we hope to answer the conundrum of modern existence together.\n\nHis career is dedicated to purveying honest acoustic roots music, not for the sake of revival, but as a living, breathing community experience in the here and now. An award winning banjo player, and a cherished songwriter, Benny Bleu lives up to the truest form of folk music – made by the folks, for the folks. His hypothesis: building connections with nature, each other, and our history through music makes for a richer future. Simple, testable, repeatable.\n\nhttps://bennybleu.com/\n\nTickets: $15 advance, $20 day of show and on sale now at https://abilene.showare.com/ and at the bar\n\nView Event →\n\nAlice Howe & Freebo\n\nDoors 4pm, Music 7:30pm\n\nAlice Howe\n\nAlice Howe knew. There she was, recording at the legendary Fame Recording Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, standing on ground soaked in soul, and she knew the truth.\n\nShe had to dig deeper than ever before.\n\nHer voice had carried her this far in folk circles, but now she needed to tap into the spirits of the musical titans pictured in photos on the walls. They called to her, demanding nothing less.\n\n“There is so much history there, and I did feel like there was a certain amount of pressure to deliver and be a singer,” she recalls. “I’m in this room with Aretha Franklin and Etta James looking down on me, and it’s like that Mona Lisa thing where the eyes follow you around the room and you’re like: ‘Hi, ladies!’ Those are singers with a capital S.”\n\nChanneling Fame’s ghosts, she mined her heart, poured everything into her vocals, and created her second and latest album, Circumstance — 11 stirring tracks that pull no punches weaving together a vibrant tapestry of southern rock, country, folk, classic soul and blues. As an old soul inside a 30-something millennial, Alice put her stamp on American music’s timeless strands with standout originals evoking both classic singer-songwriters and the sounds that once filled airwaves, roadhouses and juke joints with desire and heartbreak.\n\n“This album tells a story of coming back to myself, and to my power,” she says.\n\nTo reach that pinnacle took a pair of Muscle Shoals sessions two years apart. The first session in 2019 happened on a whim, but the results were pure gold, enough to convince Alice she needed to return for the rest of an album. Despite delays, she made good on her promise to herself.\n\n“It really hit me that there was something special in that room, and with that band, and there was something that it brought out in me that was just very compelling. Right away, I could tell that I wanted to go back.”\n\nThree of the original tracks she wrote solo, with the remaining seven co-written with her creative partner, Freebo. A veteran rock and folk musician who was Bonnie Raitt’s bass player during the 1970s, he backed Alice on the album on fretless bass as well as produced and arranged it.\n\nShe’s justifiably proud of the result, as much for the vocals as the lyrics.\n\n“I think that what I do with my voice is the result of everything I’ve taken in throughout my life, listening to other singers and learning along the way,” she says. “What I was able to do on this record is the best representation of that, the culmination of where I’m at right now in my life.”\n\nHer powerhouse record bears an apt title, considering that a series of pivotal circumstances has led her to the exciting point of breaking out of the folk mold and into the wider Americana music world.\n\nFor starters, take her childhood in Newton, Massachusetts. In her parents’ eclectic record collection, she found a treasure trove of influences: from the blues of Muddy Waters, Mississippi John Hurt and Taj Mahal to the folk of Joan Baez and Kate and Anna McGarrigle to the rock of James Taylor, Joni Mitchell and Jackson Browne. Their emotional honesty and evocative lyrics appealed to a girl feeling out of her time and compelled to write stories about her life, even surreptitiously during math class.\n\n“I always felt really connected to the music I listened to growing up,” she remembers. “My parents had this great record collection, and I would listen to the folk and rock and ‘70s songwriters that I connected with. They just always hit me on an emotional level. Like the lyrics: I was always really tuned into how somebody was saying something. What is it about the way Jackson Browne describes an emotion? How can I do that in my own way too?”\n\nSummers in Vermont at rustic camps or her family’s cabin also shaped her with tranquil days that nurtured her imagination and sharpened her powers of observation and reflection, paving the way for the future introspective songwriter she would become.\n\n“I am very sensitive to the people in my life, and I feel this compulsion to describe them in my poetry,” she says. “I want to share what I know about life and say it in a way that I think will resonate with other people, because I think that nothing I’m saying is unique to me. It’s all universal human experiences, which is why I love history, too. I always said in college that’s why I studied history, because I was always fascinated to read things that were written a long time ago and notice how a lot of our experiences are unchanged throughout history. There’s just a timeless aspect to songs. Even the folk songs I listened to growing up, they would tell stories of events that happened long ago, but they feel like you could know those people in those songs if you applied them to your own life.”\n\nHer life took a momentous turn in Seattle. She was a Smith College graduate with a medieval European history degree working in the Dusty Strings Music Store, camping on the weekends and playing local gigs. Everything seemed comfortable, but an inner restlessness stirred, a calling beckoned.\n\nAlice listened.\n\nShe moved back to her hometown, broke off a longtime relationship and threw herself into being a musician, releasing a five-track EP You’ve Been Away So Long that she recorded just before leaving Seattle. It yielded a top song on Folk Radio, Homeland Blues, which gave her some momentum until another fortuitous circumstance got her truly rolling.\n\nAttending the Northeast Regional Folk Alliance conference, she met Freebo, a prolific Los Angeles musician who has accompanied numerous big names, including Maria Muldaur, Jackson Browne, Ringo Starr and Dr. John. He heard her play, and she made an impression. When they ran into each other again the next year in Kansas City at a national conference, a friendship formed, the start of a fruitful partnership. She accepted his offer to assemble a band, book a Bakersfield, California studio, and cut a full album.\n\n“It was her voice that I heard, the sound of it,” he says of what drew him to her. “I thought, ‘Wow, that’s really unique.’ It’s the timbre, the legitimacy and the honesty. There’s a natural, enrapturing, unaffected beauty to Alice’s voice.”\n\n“I mean what I say, and I mean what I’m singing,” she notes. “The way I’m singing it, it’s just who I am and just how I feel. I think people respond to that.”\n\nThose three days in Bakersfield produced her 2019 Visions album, a “modern love letter to ‘60s and ‘70s folk and timeless blues” featuring both originals and her interpretations of songs from the family record collection that shaped her musical consciousness. No longer was she a novice on the fringe. Dubbed a rising star in modern folk, she had held her own with seasoned pros in the studio and had an engaging record — with a Muddy Waters cover no less — to show for it.\n\nBut she had room to grow, and a chance encounter opened the door. She and Freebo bumped into an old friend, guitarist Will McFarlane, another ‘70s Bonnie Raitt band alumnus who spent decades with the Fame house band. McFarlane offered to set up the first Muscle Shoals session and play on it to boot. Months later, they took him up on the invitation, bringing together a band of all-star session musicians that included Seattle-based guitarist Jeff Fielder, an old friend of Alice’s whose playing has graced all three of her releases.\n\nThe session yielded three finished tracks, and Alice was hooked on the Muscle Shoals sound. She was planning her return when COVID-19 struck, placing the project on hold. In the end, however, the delay turned out to be yet another defining circumstance.\n\n“I was so disappointed to not go back right away, but what that actually did for me was it gave me all this time to write and arrange the songs with Freebo, and to go back and forth with the choices of the songs, to listen to what we had done in the first session and think about what I could do better. I even had the time to take some vocal lessons, which I had never done. I was really prepared, so by the time we finally went back, everybody was so ready on every level. I knew I was ready to complete the project, that I had a clear purpose and vision for why I was there.”\n\nThe final result covers a wide expanse of emotional ground, with Alice’s deeply personal lyrics chronicling a journey of grief, reflection, discovery and renewal — all painted with a varied musical palette ranging from haunting ballads to driving rock ‘n’ roll.\n\n“You’ve Been Away So Long,” a remake of her EP title track, leads off with a resolution to make peace with the turmoil of the past. From there, the album kicks into high gear with “Somebody’s New Lover Now,” its chiming guitar and Hammond B3 organ creating a perfect fusion of modern country and soul. “Love Has No Rules” features catchy opening guitar hooks, and the B3 returns in the rocking, ebullient “What About You,” gliding over crunchy chords like an unburdened spirit. Even higher soars “With You By My Side,” a serious groove with tight horns and smooth background singers that could have come from Fame’s R&B archives.\n\nBut there’s also quieter energy that burns just as brightly. “Let Go” calls forth pensive guitar and lilting piano to tell a tale of healing, while the atmospheric “Something Calls to Me” evokes a mist-filled bayou night and “Travelin’ Soul” serves a shot of country blues straight up.\n\n“I definitely went through a lot of change, on a personal level, in leaving a long relationship and feeling like a huge shift happened in my life and I was striking out on my own in a new way,” Alice says. “So I think there’s a lot of that in this record. There’s a lot about discovering your own inner power and your independence, and then finding the people or the relationships that serve you in this new phase, the people who get you in your new form. We’re always changing and shedding the old version and coming into a new version of ourselves.”\n\nAs a reflection of her evolution, Circumstance turned out to be everything she hoped for — a personal, soulful nod to her influences and the music she loves, all of it sung old-school without auto-tuning. In spirit it draws from admired singers — Alison Krauss or the 1970s Laurel Canyon circle — but its soul is pure Alice Howe.\n\n“I was just trying to be myself. That’s all it is,” Alice says. “It’s not trying to be a throwback. It’s not trying to be anything other than: This is who I am as an artist, as a singer and a writer, and that’s what you get.”\n\nA formative childhood. A crossroads decision. A momentous reunion. A golden invitation to step inside musical history. A creative lull. Each circumstance led her to this point, with the road stretching ahead and singing its siren song.\n\n“I long for the platform to share what I do with an audience, and to find the people who my music resonates with, and I think you can’t do that at home,” Alice says. “You have to go out and find that.”\n\n“I’m guilty, I got nothing more to say\n\nI’m not a bad girl I’m just used to gettin’ my way\n\nI got a dreamin’ soul from another time\n\nA willing heart and an open mind\n\nIf you should care to find\n\nYou can read me line by line”\n\n— “Line by Line”\n\nhttps://www.alicehowe.com/\n\nFreebo\n\nFreebo is a genuine folk, rock and blues icon who, after over 40 years of recording and touring with many of the great artists of our time (Bonnie Raitt 10 years, CSN, Maria Muldaur, John Mayall, Ringo Starr, Dr. John, Neil Young, & many more) is regarded as one of the most gifted singer-songwriters of today. A multi award winner and finalist in numerous songwriting contests, Freebo was also recognized as the 'Best Folk Artist 2007' by the Los Angeles Music Awards. In addition, he has appeared on Saturday Night Live, The Muppet Show, The Midnight Special, and in concert with the legendary Spinal Tap.\n\nFreebo’s compassionate concern for the world and people around him, as evidenced both in his lyrics and his open stage banter, has helped him connect with listeners worldwide. He will take an audience from insights about what kind of positive mark we hope to leave on the world upon our own passing with “Standing Ovation” to where you stand with your pets and your partner with \"She Loves My Dog More Than Me.\" A musical evening with Freebo will be astute, insightful, clever, and truly melodic.\n\nHere's what critics are saying about Freebo:\n\n\"Freebo's intimate and go-down-easy personable vocals tie in light-hearted fare, social commentary and spiritual quest with love-sweet-love, and make it sound seamless.\" (Janet Goodman, Music News Nashville)\n\n\"Standing Ovation is an astounding song which encompasses a profound view of life, destined to become a classic.\" (Russ Paris, Folkworks.org)\n\n\"Listening to Freebo is like riding on a cumulus cloud of peaceful awareness, a cosmic blend of folk/country/rock/soul ear-pleasing genre-defying music.\" (Walt Falconer, Cool Album Of The Day)\n\n\"Freebo sounds as if he's not really singing to you; he's talking to you.

Uninhibited by ties to one particular sound, Eady’s catalog showcases an affinity for telling authentic, forthright stories with his music, a quality that continues to bring new listeners to this veteran musician’s audience year after year.\n\nBorn in his most recent album’s namesake state, Mississippi finds Eady inspired, motivated but not bound by the success of his past; instead, Mississippi is yet another manifestation of what Eady does best – channeling truth into songs and a refusal to be boxed in by his previous work. His newest album, however, is not a seismic shift that rebukes the past; rather, Mississippi brings to the forefront hints of deep South-style blues that has always had a place in his sound.\n\n“There was a groove based sound that I grew up with in Mississippi that has always\n\nbeen a part of what I do, but with this record I wanted to bring that to the forefront. I think this record is the opposite side of the same coin I’ve always had, I just flipped it over.”\n\nMississippi’s critical praise situates it as yet another beloved album born out of Eady’s\n\nnineteen year career. With nine full-length albums, Eady explores genre and form with mastery, complementing the Texas sound he’s perhaps best known for with forays where listeners can find him accompanied by bluegrass pickers or pedal steel. This versatility has earned Eady praise from contemporaries and critics alike, with NPR acknowledging Eady’s grassroots, nononsense approach to his craft by dubbing him “one of the most promising alt-country underdogs.”\n\nThis intentionality and fluidity is indicative of an artist at the top of his craft, bolstered by critical success like 2021’s To the Passage of Time and 2018’s I Travel On but not reliant upon it; if Eady stands for anything, it’s the wholehearted pursuit of remaining loyal to himself without resting on his laurels, pushing himself as an artist and a storyteller.\n\n“I have always had a ton of respect for artists who have experimented with and presented different styles and genres while still maintaining a style of their own. I love that arc over a career and how it keeps it interesting for the listener. I love that feeling of “what is he going to do next?”. Hopefully that same sense of excitement and anticipation stays alive in my music as well.”\n\nhttps://www.jasoneady.com/\n\nTickets: $20 advance, $25 day of show and on sale now at https://abilene.showare.com/ and at the bar\n\nView Event →\n\nBilly Bremner's Rockfiles 2024\n\nDoors 4pm, Music 8pm\n\nBilly Bremner’s Rockfiles 2024\n\nBilly Bremner’s Rockfiles starring legendary Scottish guitarist Billy Bremner.

The tracks were recorded in Valencia, Spain in May 2023 at the end of a successful and explosive, as usual, European tour. The tour yielded much of the material for the album.\n\nThe Savages are on the cusp of the 40th anniversary of their first recording, which was released in 1984. Glory gives a slight twist to their rip-rock-powerful style they started out with way back when, though with no less attitude or volume, or any less speaker-imploding energy that Barrence still has behind a microphone and in front of a crowd.\n\nThe band includes original members Barrence Whitfield on vocals, Peter Greenberg (DMZ/Customs/Lyres) on guitar and Phil Lenker (Lyres) on bass along with Andy Jody (Pearlene/James Leg) on drums and Tom Quartulli (Toasters) on sax. who both joined the Savages 12 years ago.\n\nHelming the board as producer of the sessions was Mike Mariconda, “a legend in the underground rock scene” as noted by White Trash Soul. Mike has produced countless garage rock bands around the world and was the original A-Bones guitarist, then in The Raunch Hands and The Devil Dogs. The Savages were joined on the recording Spencer Evoy, of London’s legendary MFC Chicken, on baritone sax.\n\nThe Savages reunited in 2010 and created critically acclaimed recordings on the Bloodshot Records label. It was Rock Thy Savage Soul that whiplashed across the ears of the folks booking Later with…Jools Holland where Barrence and the boys most surely sent Jools rocking and reeling back to the his early years pounding the keys before Squeeze.\n\nWith GLORY, Barrence and the Savages are in prime form.

Guitarist Nathan Beauregard lived with Beard's cousin, so he was surrounded by aspiring and veteran blues musicians while growing up, and he began singing at an early age. Beard became interested in playing guitar via the Murphy brothers, who sat in with a young B.B. King when he played at the Roosevelt Lake Club. Beard began to learn guitar at age 17 from Ernest Scruggs, a neighbor, before heading to Chicago. Beard moved to Rochester, NY, and from time to time would visit one of his brothers in Chicago. He quickly became enamored of the blues being played in clubs there by people like Jimmy Reed and Sonny Boy Williamson. Beard sat in with John Lee Hooker one night and received encouraging words from Hooker, and also later sat in with his idol, Muddy Waters.While in Rochester, he formed the Soul Brothers Six, playing bass and singing, but he didn't perform in public on guitar until 1965. Beard befriended classic blues guitarist Son House, who was a neighbor in Rochester, and played a concert for students at the University of Rochester in 1968. Beard worked as an electrician by day and would occasionally play out at night and on weekends for most of the '60s on through to the '80s. He has a reputation as one of the best local players around, and though he may not be a household name in other parts of the U.S., he toured Europe in 1983 and did studio and stage work with Buster Benton, Lafayette Leake, and Memphis Slim. At the famed BK Lounge, Beard and his backing bands opened for Bobby Bland, Albert King, and others.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/joebeardblues\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/gian.c.cervone\n\nSpecial thanks to our friends, Doug Camp and Cicero Ryland Jr..,true music fans.\n\nView Event →\n\nJohnny Nicholas Band\n\nDoors 4pm, Music 8pm\n\nJohnny Nicholas Band\n\nJohnny Nicholas feels the music, from blues to rock and everything in between. His credentials? Impeccable. Conviction? Immeasurable. And chops? If an instrument’s got strings, keys, or reeds he can play the hell out of it. He’s also a consummate songwriter and a great singer blessed with a warm, toasty growl of a voice that can roll from rumble to croon and back again with seductive ease.\n\nMarcia Ball calls Nicholas “an extremely engaging innovative traditionalist” who “writes instant classics and sings them to break your heart and rock your soul.” But the key word there is “innovative,” because as deep as his roots go — and we’re talking about a cat who learned firsthand from the likes of Robert Lockwood Jr., Howlin’ Wolf, Big Walter Horton, and Johnny Shines (to name but a few of the legends he studied under early in his five-decade career) — Nicholas does not paint in one color.\n\nAs befits a soul who’s spent a lifetime soaking up the flavor of such vibrant music scenes as Ann Arbor(in the early 70’s), Chicago, South Louisiana and Texas (which he’s called home now for nearly 40 years), his music is full-spectrum Americana — a rich gumbo of not just blues, but cajun, western swing, honky tonk and barrelhouse rock ’n’ roll.\n\nAs an artist and performer he can mesmerize a listening room crowd or bring a festival crowd to their feet with his rollicking boogie woogie piano and his stellar band.\n\nFor proof, just take a listen to Nicholas’ most recent eclectic collection of original American roots music, 2021’s Mistaken Identity on Valcour Records which finds him drawing on all of the above and deep into his soul for words of wit, wisdom, and heart. As the esteemed writer Bill Bentley puts it best, “He’s someone who cares about being real, and the hell with everything else … .”\n\nhttp://johnnynicholasblues.com/\n\nTickets: $20 and on sale now at https://abilene.showare.com/ and tonight at the bar\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Ribbon Project with Special Guest, Ryan Sutherland\n\nDoors 7pm, Music 7:30pm\n\nThe Ribbon Project\n\nThe Ribbon Project- Some friends decided to get together and write some folk, Americana, alt-country songs.\n\nThe Ribbon Project is Jason Pariseau: guitar and vocals, Ben Rossi: guitar and vocals, Sean Scanlon: percussion, Greg Horton: banjo, and Joel Boyer: banjo\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheRibbonProjectNY\n\nRyan Sutherland\n\nRyan Sutherland is a singer/songwriter from Rochester with influences which include Tom Waits, Django Reinhardt, Elvis Costello, Warren Zevon, Roy Orbison, Bruce Springsteen, Fall of Troy, Protest the Hero, Steve Vai, Ritchie Blackmore, Louis Armstrong among others.\n\nhttps://ryansutherland.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ryan.sutherland.169405\n\nCover: $10\n\nView Event →\n\nSpecial Show with The Majestics!\n\nDoors 4pm, Music 8pm\n\nThe Majestics\n\nRon Stackman, Jim Schwarz and Lou LaVilla began performing together in 1972.\n\nThe following year they created Bahama Mama, one of the first American bands to embrace Reggae music. When the group split up in 1980, Stackman, Schwarz and Lavilla remained together and formed the Majestics.\n\nOriginally a trio with Ron on Hammond B-3, clavinet and guitar, Jim on bass and Lou on drums, the Majestics steadily developed a fan base in upstate New York, eventually catching the attention of the legendary Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. In 1982, the group backed Perry when he opened for the Clash during their historic run at New York City's Bonds International Casino, then traveled with the music icon to Kingston, Jamaica to record his \"Mystic Miracle Star\" LP. The Majestics later filled out their sound, enlisting guitarist Rudy Valentino (with whom they recorded their 1984 EP, \"Future Now\") and Trinidadian percussionist, Fitzroy 'Brother' James.\n\nThe band performed extensively throughout the eastern United States during the 1980s, opening for Burning Spear on two tours and appearing with a veritable who's who of Reggae music including Peter Tosh, Toots and the Maytals, Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs, Leroy Sibbles, Yellowman, Third World, The Gladiators, The Wailers, Eek-A-Mouse, Dillinger, The Heptones, Jimmy Cliff, Ziggy Marley, Black Uhuru, Mutaburuka and others.\n\nNow, 40+ years after the band's formation, the Majestics' original trio is back along with guitarist Kevin Hart and Vince Ercolamento on saxophones.\n\nOriginal roots music along with versions of classic Reggae gems.

Hanna PK Band\n\nDoors 4pm, Music 9pm\n\nHanna PK Band\n\nHanna PK is a solid pianist, soulful vocalist, and vibrant performer, born and raised in South Korea, currently residing in Rochester, NY. She plays a wide variety of the blues & swing, old school folk, and boogie-woogie. She has a dynamic songwriting style - ranging from a funky tune with socially conscious lyrics to a mournful slow blues, from a pop-edged ballad to an uplifting swinging number, and from barrelhouse boogie to jazz. Her seemingly sweet and soft-spoken appearance often leads to surprise when hearing her rich, resonating voice that goes from a whisper to belting with intensity. Her piano style is much more lyrical and imaginative than simply repeating so-called “licks”, though she knows when to toss them in the mix for a thrill, and is always in the groove. And what draws the audience closer to her heartfelt, honest music are her genuine passion, and the originality that comes from within.\n\nIn November 2021, She's released her debut album on the VizzTone Label with Booga Music of internationally-known bluesman, Kenny Neal. Though Kenny had met her in Memphis, and during his tour in upstate New York, what got his attention to sign her to his label was a video of hanna’s performance on a Curtis Jones’ song “Decoration Day Blues” that she's recorded in her U-Haul storage room. Debuted at #13 on Billboard’s US Blues chart, since its released, the album has been played all over the U.S. and the world.\n\nut words, and even recorded samples, cannot fully convey the essence of Hanna’s ''music — to really understand it and feel it, you have to hear her perform live. Her music continues to evolve and reflects the very moment she is living in — the happenings and vibe in the room, the reactions of her listeners, the musical contributions of each band member, and even the events of the week in the world, all combine to inspire a new and different performance of each song. As is the case with all true blues performers, she works from and in the tradition of the music while bringing her own stamp of creativity and originality to it. Her music tells a story, sometimes an age-old one, but she tells it in her way from her perspective, which in turn informs and expands our experience.\n\nhttps://www.hannapk.com/\n\nCover: $5\n\nView Event →\n\nNight Two of the Rohrbach Late Night Sessions feat.

Guitarist Nathan Beauregard lived with Beard's cousin, so he was surrounded by aspiring and veteran blues musicians while growing up, and he began singing at an early age. Beard became interested in playing guitar via the Murphy brothers, who sat in with a young B.B. King when he played at the Roosevelt Lake Club. Beard began to learn guitar at age 17 from Ernest Scruggs, a neighbor, before heading to Chicago. Beard moved to Rochester, NY, and from time to time would visit one of his brothers in Chicago. He quickly became enamored of the blues being played in clubs there by people like Jimmy Reed and Sonny Boy Williamson. Beard sat in with John Lee Hooker one night and received encouraging words from Hooker, and also later sat in with his idol, Muddy Waters.While in Rochester, he formed the Soul Brothers Six, playing bass and singing, but he didn't perform in public on guitar until 1965. Beard befriended classic blues guitarist Son House, who was a neighbor in Rochester, and played a concert for students at the University of Rochester in 1968. Beard worked as an electrician by day and would occasionally play out at night and on weekends for most of the '60s on through to the '80s. He has a reputation as one of the best local players around, and though he may not be a household name in other parts of the U.S., he toured Europe in 1983 and did studio and stage work with Buster Benton, Lafayette Leake, and Memphis Slim. At the famed BK Lounge, Beard and his backing bands opened for Bobby Bland, Albert King, and others.\n\nHanna PK is a 2019 International Blues Challenge Semi-Finalist -- a solid pianist, soulful vocalist, and vibrant performer who channels a wide variety of the blues & swing, old school folk and boogie-woogie but with her own contemporary realness whether she’s performing her story-telling originals, breathing new life into songs that may be 100 years old, or anything in-between. Her seemingly sweet and soft-spoken appearance often leads to surprise when hearing for the first time her rich, resonating voice that goes from a whisper to belting with intensity. Her piano ranges from barrelhouse to jazzy to delicate, full of spontaneousness, and what draws the audience closer to her heartfelt and honest songs are her genuine passion and originality that comes from within. Once in a while, we meet an artist that seems to be quite nothing like what we’ve seen or heard, yet, reaching that common ground and emotions through their own creativity, makes us feel at ease, touched, and understood.

Le Winston Band will put on a show unlike any you’ve ever experienced, leaning into rural Acadian traditions yet steeped in a full bore Zydeco sound and feel, yet infused with some tasty Français Canadien sound. Since 2012, due to a sound that is derived from both the rich musical traditions of Louisiana and their own identity as Montrealers, the group has been sharing their joie de vivre with audiences across North America and Europe.\n\nIn fact, when Le Winston Band plays Abilene on Wednesday June 12, they will just have returned from a major 11 stop tour of Europe.\n\nLe Winston Band delivers. Engages. Inspires. Intrigues. Captures. Thrills.\n\nUnited by their shared passion for Zydeco music, the five musicians intermingle sassy compositions and their own take on well-known traditional songs from Quebec and Louisiana. The powerful sound of the diatonic accordion supported by a typical “modern zydeco” lineup, electrifies audiences and ensures a warm and festive atmosphere that is guaranteed to get you off your feet and dancing.\n\nLe Winston Band is also known for their Mardi Gras celebration in Montreal. Since 2014, hundreds of people flock to this carnival-like event that takes place as winter draws to a close. Every year, costumed fans and musicians alike join together for a wild night filled with food, animation, music and dancing.\n\nNot only has Le Winston Band shared their music from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Victoria, British Columbia but they have also traveled to perform in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Holland, Czechia and the United States. As of today, the group has performed over 600 concerts.\n\nAfter many pilgrimages to Louisiana, the group’s album Zig zag Zydeco Zoo was nominated for best world music album at both the ADISQ and GAMIQ galas in 2019. In 2022, their EP Enwèye à Lafayette won best world music album at the GAMIQ gala. That same year, the five musicians teamed up with producer Erik West-Millette and recorded Winston Express, a new record filled with original material that was released during the 2023 Mardi Gras festivities.\n\nZydeco music is music that is played by the creole peoples of southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas. The use of the accordion and scrub-board help to distinguish zydeco music from many other styles of American dance music. Born out of blues and gospel, zydeco music takes inspiration from the French, Acadian, Indigenous, Spanish and English cultures that make up Louisiana’s rich musical history.\n\nAll of this makes Zydeco music an incredibly rich and complex mix that fits right in with what we think of today as North American music. This music came about because of the resilience of southwest Louisiana’s black community in the face of atrocities such as slavery and racism just to name a few. Not only is Le Winston Band well aware of these origins, but their mission is to honor Zydeco’s pioneers and share this wonderful music amongst people and cultures who may not have stumbled upon Louisiana music before; all the while staying true to their identity as Montrealers from Canada.\n\nLe Winston Band | Zydeco | Montréal | Québec | Canada\n\nTickets: $20 on sale now at https://abilene.showare.com/ and tonight at the bar.\n\nView Event →\n\nSarah Shook & the Disarmers\n\nDoors 6pm, Music 8pm\n\nSarah Shook & the Disarmers\n\nIt’s obvious listening to Sarah Shook and the Disarmers’ clear-eyed, biting, and unafraid songs that integrity is the most important thing to the Chapel Hill, North Carolina, country-punk outfit. “A lot of artists are in this industry for fame, recognition, and money but those things don’t mean anything to me,” says bandleader River Shook. “Songwriting is it for me. It’s the only real healthy coping mechanism I've ever had. It’s life-saving. I don't care about any superficial things when I’m making a record.” On their resonant fourth album Revelations, produced by Shook and out March 29 via Thirty Tigers, these raw and resilient tracks come first. Throughout, Shook’s deft storytelling documents regular people getting by and keeping on, all presented without filter or pretension.\n\nIn 2022, Shook was remarkably productive. They released two albums: debut solo indie rock record Cruel Liars under the moniker Mightmare (Kill Rock Stars) and a third Disarmers full-length called Nightroamer (Thirty Tigers). Compared to every Disarmers record before that, which captured the in-the-room energy of the band with live recorded songs, the latter LP was instead more of a product of the studio with meticulous tracking sessions and an outside producer. While that effort was well-received, Shook believed the songs on Revelations deserved a more direct approach. “Since the Disarmers started in 2015, our strength has always been in our live performance,” says Shook. “To me, an album should capture the essence of a band. With this new set of songs that are all super special to me, I didn't trust anybody else to capture the songs and decide how to best serve each song.” Shook, who honed their production skills with their Mightmare LP and Izzy Ryder’s debut record, confidently took the reins during a blistering recording session, capturing 10 songs in two days.\n\nFor Shook, it was paramount the recordings match the band’s tangible live ferocity because these songs boast their most immediate lyrics yet. “All of my writing is autobiographical, and I write everything based on my observations and experiences,” says Shook. “But there was something about Revelations that felt more personal to me. I unlocked this level of honesty with myself and an ability to be more objective about the things I struggle with daily.” Take the title track, which finds Shook singing about the precariousness of navigating mental health under capitalism. Over a rollicking, twang-hued arrangement, they sing, “Black cloud followin' me around, little storm in my head / Some days I levitate off the ground, some days I can't get outta bed.” The track doesn’t preach or romanticize. Instead, it’s galvanizing and relatable.\n\nThese are lived-in stories about real people with real dreams, atmospheric pasts, and inescapable problems. “I think of myself as a collector: I just go around and collect experiences and observations,” says Shook. “I'm still adjusting to writing songs as a sober person but a lot of the themes are just about being a working person and navigating mental health and relationships with other people going through the same things.” Lead single “Backsliders” comes directly from Shook’s life when they were a bartender at a Chapel Hill dive called The Cave. The song is a deceptively breezy romp about workplace romantic entanglements with Shook singing, “Love you like a breath when I ain't workin' myself to death / cause I'm longin' for the ghost of a friend.” On one hand, it captures the closeness that only service workers can experience on the job but on the other, it plainly states how easy it is to fall into bad habits when dealing with any type of loss.\n\nThroughout the LP, there are cathartic, snarling kiss-offs to villainous men (“Motherfucker”) but also moments of tenderness and ecstasy. Shook describes closer “Criminal” as their “gay cowboy song”, the torturous longing of the lyrics is anchored by shimmering guitar leads from Blake Tallent and bastioned by drummer Jack Foster’s hypnotic rhythms. River sings, “If lovin' you will always be a crime I'll always be a criminal.” It’s a triumphant line that highlights Shook’s emotional sturdiness. “That line got me thinking about how we as queer people have been persecuted, and how we so often have to keep all kinds of things under wraps because of the law because of social taboo,” says Shook. “I wanted “Criminal” to portray these feelings of longing and desire that two gay people can have for each other. They're complicated feelings because human beings are complicated. Gay love is every bit as complicated as straight love.”\n\nRevelations is the most assured Sarah Shook and the Disarmers record yet because it so pointedly captures the gamut of the human experience: anger, sadness, confusion, love, and acceptance. It’s a document of Shook at the top of their game and a reflection of their own journey not just as a writer but as a person. “I’m a firm believer that if you are an artist, and you want to make better art, a big part of that isn't just exercising your musical skills, it’s growing as a human being,” says Shook. “So every time I make a record, I want to be able to listen to it and look back on who I was then. I want to see this arc and this evolution. That's really fucking important to me.”\n\nhttps://www.disarmers.com/\n\nTickets: $25 and on sale now at https://abilene.showare.com/ and tonight at the bar\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Fox Sisters\n\nDoors 6pm, Music 8pm\n\nThe Fox Sisters\n\nThe Fox Sisters are a six piece party outfit that play original music influenced by American Rhythm & Blues of the 1960’s.
