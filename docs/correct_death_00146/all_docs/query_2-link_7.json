        "text": "John Lee Hooker (August 22, 1917 – June 21, 2001) was a highly influential American blues singer-songwriter and guitarist.\n\nHooker began his life as the son of a sharecropper, William Hooker, and rose to prominence performing his own unique style of what was originally a unique brand of country blues. He developed a 'talking blues' style that was his trademark. Though similar to the early Delta blues, his music was metrically free. John Lee Hooker could be said to embody his own unique genre of the blues, often incorporating the boogie-woogie piano style and a driving rhythm into his blues guitar playing and singing. His best known songs include \"Boogie Chillen'\" (1948), \"I'm in the Mood\" (1951) and \"Boom Boom\" (1962), the first two reaching #1 on the Billboard R&B chart.\n\nEarly life[edit][]\n\nThere is some debate as to the year of Hooker's birth[3][4] in Coahoma County, Mississippi,[5] the youngest of the eleven children of William Hooker (1871–1923),[6] a sharecropperand Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born 1875, date of death unknown);[7] according to his official website, he was born on August 22, 1917.\n\nHooker and his siblings were home-schooled. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs, with his earliest exposure being the spirituals sung in church. In 1921, his parents separated. The next year, his mother married William Moore, a blues singer who provided Hooker with his first introduction to the guitar (and whom John would later credit for his distinctive playing style).[8] John's stepfather was his first outstanding blues influence. William Moore was a local blues guitarist who learned in Shreveport, Louisiana to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the Delta blues of the time.[5] Around 1923 his natural father died. At the age of 15, John Lee Hooker ran away from home, reportedly never seeing his mother or stepfather again.[9]\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Hooker lived in Memphis, Tennessee where he worked on Beale Street at The New Daisy Theatre and occasionally performed at house parties.[5] He worked in factories in various cities during World War II, drifting until he found himself in Detroit in 1948 working at Ford Motor Company. He felt right at home near the blues venues and saloons on Hastings Street, the heart of black entertainment on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce. Performing in Detroit clubs, his popularity grew quickly and, seeking a louder instrument than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.[10]\n\nCareer[edit][]\n\n[1][2]Hooker playing Massey Hall, Toronto Photo: Jean-Luc Ourlin\n\nHooker's recording career began in 1948 when his agent placed a demo, made by Hooker, with the Bihari brothers, owners of the Modern Records label. The company initially released an up-tempo number, Boogie Chillen', which became Hooker's first hit single.[5] Though they were not songwriters, the Biharis often purchased or claimed co-authorship of songs that appeared on their labels, thus securing songwriting royalties for themselves, in addition to their own streams of income.\n\nSometimes these songs were older tunes that Hooker renamed, as with B.B. King's Rock Me Baby, anonymous jams B.B.'s Boogie, or songs by employees (bandleader Vince Weaver). The Biharis used a number of pseudonyms for songwriting credits: Jules was credited as Jules Taub; Joe as Joe Josea; and Sam as Sam Ling. One song by John Lee Hooker, Down Child, is solely credited toTaub, with Hooker receiving no credit. Another, Turn Over a New Leaf is credited to Hooker and Ling.\n\nIn 1949, Hooker was recorded performing in an informal setting for Detroit jazz enthusiasts. His repertoire included down-home and spiritual tunes that he would not record commercially.[11] The recorded set has been made available in the album Jack O'Diamonds.[12]\n\nDespite being illiterate, Hooker was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting the occasionally traditional blues lyric (such as \"if I was chief of police, I would run her right out of town\"), he freely invented many of his songs from scratch. Recording studios in the 1950s rarely paid black musicians more than a pittance, so Hooker would spend the night wandering from studio to studio, coming up with new songs or variations on his songs for each studio. Because of his recording contract, he would record these songs under obvious pseudonyms such as John Lee Booker, notably forChess Records and Chance Records in 1951/52,[13] as Johnny Lee for De Luxe Records in 1953/54[13] as John Lee, and even John Lee Cooker,[14] or as Texas Slim, Delta John,Birmingham Sam and his Magic Guitar, Johnny Williams, or The Boogie Man.[15]\n\nHis early solo songs were recorded under Bernie Besman. John Lee Hooker rarely played on a standard beat, changing tempo to fit the needs of the song. This often made it difficult to use backing musicians who were not accustomed to Hooker's musical vagaries. As a result, Besman would record Hooker, in addition to playing guitar and singing, stomping along with the music on a wooden pallet.[16] For much of this time period he recorded and toured with Eddie Kirkland, who was still performing until his death in a car accident in 2011. Later sessions for the VeeJay label in Chicagoused studio musicians on most of his recordings, including Eddie Taylor, who could handle his musical idiosyncrasies very well. His biggest UK hit, \"Boom Boom\", (originally released on VeeJay) was recorded with a horn section.\n\nLater life[edit][]\n\n[3][4]Toronto, August 20, 1978\n\nHe appeared and sang in the 1980 movie The Blues Brothers. Due to Hooker's improvisational style, his performance was filmed and sound-recorded live at the scene at Chicago's Maxwell Street Market, in contrast to the usual \"playback\" technique used in most film musicals.[17] Hooker was also a direct influence in the look of John Belushi's character Jake Blues.\n\nIn 1989, he joined with a number of musicians, including Carlos Santana and Bonnie Raitt to record the album The Healer, for which he and Santana won a Grammy Award. Hooker recorded several songs with Van Morrison, including \"Never Get Out of These Blues Alive\", \"The Healing Game\" and \"I Cover the Waterfront\". He also appeared on stage with Van Morrison several times, some of which was released on the live album A Night in San Francisco. The same year he appeared as the title character on Pete Townshend's The Iron Man: A Musical.\n\nOn December 19, 1989, Hooker appeared with the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton to perform \"Boogie Chillen'\" in Atlantic City, N.J., as part of the Rolling Stones Steel Wheels tour. The show was broadcast live on cable television on a pay-per-view basis.\n\nHooker recorded over 100 albums. He lived the last years of his life in Long Beach, California.[18] In 1997, he opened a nightclub in San Francisco's Fillmore District called John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom Room, after one of his hits.[19]\n\nHe fell ill just before a tour of Europe in 2001 and died on June 21 at the age of 83, two months before his 84th birthday. His last live in the studio recording on guitar and vocal was of a song he wrote with Pete Sears called \"Elizebeth\", featuring members of his \"Coast to Coast Blues Band\" with Sears on piano. It was recorded on January 14, 1998 at Bayview Studios in Richmond, California. The last song Hooker recorded before his death was Ali D'Oro, a collaboration with the Italian soul singer Zucchero, in which Hooker sang the chorus \"I lay down with an angel'\" He was survived by eight children, nineteen grandchildren, eighteen great-grandchildren, a nephew, and fiance Sidora Dazi. One of his children is the musician John Lee Hooker, Jr.\n\nAmong his many awards, Hooker has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and in 1991 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Two of his songs, \"Boogie Chillen\" and \"Boom Boom\" were included in the list of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. \"Boogie Chillen\" was included as one of the Songs of the Century. He was also inducted in 1980 into the Blues Hall of Fame. In 2000, Hooker was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nMusic[edit][]\n\nHooker's guitar playing is closely aligned with piano boogie-woogie. He would play the walking bass pattern with his thumb, stopping to emphasize the end of a line with a series of trills, done by rapid hammer-ons and pull-offs. The songs that most epitomize his early sound are \"Boogie Chillen\", about being 17 and wanting to go out to dance at the Boogie clubs, \"Baby, Please Don't Go\", a blues standard first recorded by Big Joe Williams, and \"Tupelo Blues\",[20]a song about the flooding of Tupelo, Mississippi in April 1936.\n\nHe maintained a solo career, popular with blues and folk music fans of the early 1960s and crossed over to white audiences, giving an early opportunity to the young Bob Dylan. As he got older, he added more and more people to his band, changing his live show from simply Hooker with his guitar to a large band, with Hooker singing.\n\nHis vocal phrasing was less closely tied to specific bars than most blues singers. This casual, rambling style had been gradually diminishing with the onset of electric blues bands from Chicago but, even when not playing solo, Hooker retained it in his sound.\n\nThough Hooker lived in Detroit during most of his career, he is not associated with the Chicago-style blues prevalent in large northern cities, as much as he is with the southern rural blues styles, known as delta blues, country blues, folk blues, or \"front porch blues\". His use of an electric guitar tied together the Delta blues with the emerging post-war electric blues.[21]\n\nHis songs have been covered by Buddy Guy, Cream, AC/DC, ZZ Top, Led Zeppelin, Tom Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Van Morrison, The Yardbirds, The Animals, The Doors, The White Stripes, MC5,George Thorogood, R. L. Burnside, The J. Geils Band, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, The Gories, Cat Power, and The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.\n\nAwards and recognition[edit][]\n\nA Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\nInducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980.\n\nInducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nGrammy Awards:\n\nBest Traditional Blues Recording, 1990 for I'm in the Mood (with Bonnie Raitt).\n\nBest Traditional Blues Recording, 1998 for Don't Look Back.\n\nBest Pop Collaboration with Vocals, 1998, \"Don't Look Back\" (with Van Morrison).\n\nGrammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000.\n\nTwo of his songs, \"Boogie Chillen\" and \"Boom Boom\" were named to the list of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. \"Boogie Chillen\" was included as one of the Songs of the Century.\n\nDiscography[edit][]\n\nSingles[edit][]\n\nHooker issued a large number of singles, with almost a hundred releases by 1960.[22] Here are ten of his early classic recordings:\n\nDetroit September 1948 - Boogie Chillen' - Modern 627 (11/48) R&B #1 (Crown LP \"The Blues\")\n\nDetroit September 1948 - Hobo Blues - Modern 663 (3/49) R&B #5 (Crown LP \"The Blues\")\n\nDetroit September 1948 - Crawling King Snake - Modern 714 (10/49) R&B #6 (Crown LP \"The Blues\")\n\nDetroit August 7, 1951 - I'm In the Mood - Modern 835 (9/51) R&B #1 (Crown LP \"The Blues\")\n\nDetroit Early 1955 - The Syndicator b/w Hug And Squeeze - Modern 966 (8/55) (Crown LP \"Sings The Blues\")\n\nChicago March 17, 1956 - Dimples - Vee-Jay 205 (8/56) (VJ LP \"I'm John Lee Hooker\")\n\nChicago June 10, 1958 - I Love You Honey - Vee-Jay 293 (9/58) R&B #29 (VJ LP \"I'm John Lee Hooker\")\n\nChicago March 1, 1960 - No Shoes - Vee-Jay 349 (4/60) R&B#21 (VJ LP \"Travelin'\")\n\nChicago Late 1961 - Boom Boom - Vee-Jay 438 (4/62) R&B #16 (VJ LP \"Burnin'\")\n\nChicago Mid 1964 - It Serves You Right (To Suffer) - Vee-Jay 708 (11/65) (VJ/Dynasty LP \"In Person\")\n\nAlbums[edit][]\n\nListed below are the original albums with notable reissues.
