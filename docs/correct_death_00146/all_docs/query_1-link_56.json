        "text": "KIM CURTIS\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Veteran bluesman John Lee Hooker, whose footstompin’ and gravelly voice electrified audiences and inspiredseveral generations of musicians, died Thursday at his Los Altoshome. He was 83.\n\nHe died at in his sleep at his home, said Hooker’s agent, MikeKappus.\n\nHooker died of natural causes with friends and family near, saidhis manager, Rick Bates.\n\n“He always had plenty of people around him,” Bates said.\n\nDuring a more than six-decade-long music career, the veteranblues singer from the Mississippi Delta estimated he recorded morethan 100 albums. Some of his better-known songs include “BoogieChillen,” “Boom Boom” and “I’m In The Mood.”\n\n“There are no superlatives to describe the profound impact JohnLee left in our hearts,” musician Carlos Santana said in astatement Thursday. “When I was a child, he was the first circus Iwanted to run away with.”\n\nThroughout it all, Hooker’s music remained unchanged. His richand sonorous voice, full of ancient hurt, and his brooding andsavage style remained hypnotic but unpredictable. To the strains ofhis own guitar, he sang of loneliness and confusion. Neitherpolished nor urbane, his music was raw, primal emotion.\n\n“He just kept going. … He wanted to keep working,” said JohnWooler, senior vice president at Virgin Records America andpresident of Point Blank Records, Hooker’s label. “He was planningto do a new record, but he hadn’t started.”\n\nHis one-chord boogie compositions and rhythmic guitar work werea distinctive sound that influenced rock ‘n’ rollers as well asrhythm and blues musicians.\n\nIn 1991, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Last year at the Grammys, he recieved a Lifetime AchievementAward.\n\nAmong those whose music drew heavily on Hooker’s style are VanMorrison, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen,Bonnie Raitt and ZZ Top. In 1961, the then-unknown Rolling Stonesopened for him on a European tour; he also shared a bill that yearwith Bob Dylan at a club in New York City.\n\nEven in the ’90s, when his fame was sealed and he was widelyrecognized as one of the grandfathers of pop music, Hooker remaineda little in awe of his own success, telling The Times of London,”People say I’m a genius, but I don’t know about that.”\n\nLike many postwar bluesmen, Hooker got cheated by onefly-by-night record producer after another, who demandedexclusivity or didn’t pay. Hooker fought back by recording withrival producers under a slew of different names: Texas Slim, JohnLee Booker, John Lee Cocker, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and theBoogie Man, among others.\n\nHooker’s popularity grew steadily as he rode the wave of rock inthe ’50s into the folk boom of the ’60s. In 1980, he played astreet musician in “The Blues Brothers” movie. In 1985, his songswere used in Steven Spielberg’s film, “The Color Purple.”\n\nHooker hit it big again in 1990 with his album “The Healer,”featuring duets with Santana, Raitt and Robert Cray. It sold 1.5million copies and won him his first Grammy Award, for a duet withRaitt on “I’m in the Mood.”\n\nSeveral more albums followed, including one recorded tocelebrate his 75th birthday, titled “Chill Out.”\n\n“For musicians and common people — all of us feel enormousgratitude, respect, admiration and love for his spirit,” Santanasaid in the statement. “Working with him on ‘The ‘Healer,’ ‘ChillOut,’ and also playing live on the blues festivals is somethingthat I will deeply treasure.”\n\nIn his later years, Hooker laid back and enjoyed his success. Herecorded only occasionally; he posed for blue jeans and hard-liquorads. He played benefits from time to time, but mostly performed insmall clubs, dropping in unannounced.\n\nMostly, though, he hung out with friends and family at his homesin Los Altos and Long Beach, watching baseball and enjoying a fleetof expensive cars.\n\nWooler got to know Hooker over the past decade through the albumlabel and said the blues master was a “very humble, sweet man,always in good spirits.”\n\nBorn in Clarksdale, Miss., in 1917, Hooker was one of 11children born to a Baptist minister and sharecropper whodiscouraged his son’s musical bent.\n\nHis stepfather taught him to play guitar. By the time Hooker wasa teen-ager, he was performing at local fish fries, dances andother occasions.\n\nHooker hit the road to perform by the age of 14. He worked oddjobs by day and played small bars at night in Memphis, thenCincinnati and finally Detroit in 1943.\n\nIn Detroit, he was discovered and recorded his first hit,”Boogie Chillen,” in 1948.\n\n“I don’t know what a genius is,” he told the London newspaper.”I know there ain’t no one ever sound like me, except maybe mystepfather. You hear all the kids trying to play like B.B. (King),and they ain’t going to because, ooh, he’s such a fine player and avery great man. But you never hear them even try and sound likeJohn Lee Hooker.”\n\n“All these years, I ain’t done nothin’ different,” he added. “Ibeen doing the same things as in my younger days, when I was comingup, and now here I am, an old man, up there in the charts. And Isay, well, what happened? Have they just thought up the real JohnLee Hooker, is that it? And I think, well, I won’t tell nobodyelse! I can’t help but wonder what happened.”\n\nOn the Net: www.boomboomblues.com.\n\n6/22/01"
