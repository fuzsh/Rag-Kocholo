        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Veteran bluesman John Lee Hooker, whose foot stompin' and gravelly voice on songs like “ Boom Boom” and “ Boogie Chillen” electrified audiences and inspired generations of musi cians, died Thursday. He was 83.\n\nHooker died of natural causes as he slept at his home in Los Altos, south of San Francisco, said agent Mike Kappus and man ager Rick Bates.\n\nThe veteran blues singer from the Mississippi Delta estimated he recorded more than 100 albums over nearly seven decades. He won a Grammy Award for a version of “ I'm In The Mood,” was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award at last year's Grammys.\n\nThrough it all, Hooker's music remained hypnotic and unchanged — his rich and sonorous voice, full of ancient hurt, coupled with a brooding, rhythmic guitar. He sang of loneliness and confu sion. Neither polished nor urbane, his music was raw, primal emotion.\n\nHis distinctive sound influ enced rock 'n' rollers as well as rhythm and blues musi cians.\n\nAmong those whose music drew heavily on Hooker's style are Van Morrison, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt and ZZ Top. In 1961, the then-unknown Rolling Stones opened for him on a European tour; he also shared a bill that year with Bob Dylan at a club in New York.\n\nEven in the '90s, when his fame was sealed and he was widely recognized as one of the grandfathers of pop music, Hooker remained a lit tle in awe of his own success, telling The Times of London, “ People say I'm a genius, but I don't know about that.”\n\nLike many postwar blues men, Hooker got cheated by one fly-by-night record pro ducer after another, who demanded exclusivity or did n't pay. Hooker fought back by recording with rival pro ducers under a slew of differ ent names: Texas Slim, John Lee Booker, John Lee Cocker, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and the Boogie Man, among others.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHooker's popularity grew steadily as he rode the wave of rock in the '50s into the folk boom of the '60s. In 1980, he played a street musician in “ The Blues Brothers” movie. In 1985, his songs were used in Steven Spielberg's film, “ The Color Purple.”\n\nHooker hit it big again in 1990 with his album “ The Healer,” featuring duets with Carlos Santana, Raitt and Robert Cray. It sold 1.5 mil lion copies and won him his first Grammy Award, for a duet with Raitt on “ I'm in the Mood.”\n\nSeveral more albums fol lowed, including one record ed to celebrate his 75th birth day, titled “ Chill Out.”\n\nBorn in Clarksdale, Miss., in 1917, Hooker was one of 11 children born to a Baptist minister and sharecropper who discouraged his son's musical bent.\n\nHis stepfather taught him to play guitar. By the time Hooker was a teen-ager, he was performing at local fish fries, dances and other occa sions.\n\nHooker hit the road to per form by the age of 14. He worked odd jobs by day and played small bars at night in Memphis, Tenn., then Cincinnati and finally Detroit in 1943.\n\nIn Detroit, he was discov ered and recorded his first hit, “ Boogie Chillen,” in 1948.\n\nIn his later years, Hooker laid back and enjoyed his suc cess. He recorded only occa sionally; he posed for blue jeans and hard liquor ads. He played benefits from time to time, but mostly performed in small clubs, dropping in unannounced.\n\nMostly, though, he hung out with friends and family at his homes in Los Altos and Long Beach, watching base ball and enjoying a fleet of expensive cars.\n\nAP-WS-06-21-01 2002EDT\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
