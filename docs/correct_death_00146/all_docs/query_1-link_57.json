John Lee Hooker was a legendary, groundbreaking blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar style adaptation of Delta blues. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including talking blues and early North Mississippi Hill country blues. He developed his own driving rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s–1940s piano derived boogie woogie. “The Healer” is one of my all time favorite albums, released in 1989. The album features collaborations with Bonnie Raitt, Charlie Musselwhite, Los Lobos and Carlos Santana, among others. The title track is awesome and Santana is smokin’ good on this one. The album had such great success that it “permitted John Lee Hooker to live out the end of his life in comfort.” It is phenomenal and I highly recommend it. #johnleehooker #thehealer #iminthemood\".",
