He felt perfectly at home in the proximity of the blues-saloons in Hastings Street in Detroit's East side, the place for entertainment for black citizens.\n\nHooker began his career in 1948 with the hit single \"Boogie Chillen\", recorded in a studio near the Wayne State University. He performed especially solo songs from; He became popular with the blues-early folkfans aficionados, 60, and also pleased the white audience. He also gave the young folk hero Bob Dylan at that time, a number of opportunities.\n\nIn 1989 he started a group session with a number of musicians, including Carlos Santanaand Bonnie Raitt , in order to include The Healer -that won a Grammy — one of many awards.
