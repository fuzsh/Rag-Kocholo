Reese ended a public salary feud with the network when she signed a three-year deal that will reportedly pay her close to $100,000 an episode. \"I am very, very, very, very happy,\" Reese told Daily Variety when asked about the status of her relationship with CBS.\n\nLast season, Reese took several public potshots at CBS, complaining that \"Touched\" co-star Roma Downey earned more per episode than she did. The new deal apparently still pays her less than Downey.\n\nBluesman John Lee Hooker\n\nBlues legend Hooker saves guitars from house fire\n\nLOS ALTOS, California (CNN) -- John Lee Hooker's home sustained an estimated $400,000 in damage on Sunday when fire ripped through the eight-bedroom mansion, but the blues guitarist escaped injury, and saved some of his most prized possessions -- his guitars. Hooker, 80, removed eight guitars from the burning house, with the help of firefighters.\n\nThe flames started in the bedroom of one of the bluesman's three housemates. It took 30 firefighters a half hour to bring the blaze under control. A 43-year-old man staying at Hooker's house suffered injuries when he broke a window to save several cats.\n\nFarrow\n\nFarrow blames elective surgery for mother's death\n\nNEW YORK (CNN) -- Actress Mia Farrow says elective heart surgery caused her mother, Maureen O'Sullivan, to die \"in the bloom of her life.\" In an interview with columnist Liz Smith, Farrow said, \"She went in for elective surgery on her carotid arteries and after the first successful operation, she had the second operation three days later. That caused her to die of heart failure.\" Her family had not previously elaborated on the cause of O'Sullivan's death. The actress, best known for playing Jane to Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan, died on June 22 at age 87.\n\nYoung\n\nChildren of Robert Young remember 'Best' father\n\nGLENDALE, California (CNN) -- A private funeral service was held Monday for actor Robert Young, best known for his lead roles in the television shows \"Father Knows Best\" and \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" Afterwards, his children said they hope the actor's on-screen warmth and generosity are what people remember, not his personal troubles.\n\n\"I would like (people) to remember Papa as the wonderful actor he was. And I would like them to not remember those years that were so difficult because they were difficult years for us,\" said daughter Carol Proffitt. Young had struggled with depression and alcoholism. He was 91 when he died of respiratory failure at his home on July 21.\n\nElizabeth Jagger hits the catwalk. (Mom Jerry Hall is right behind her.)\n\nTeen Jagger following in mom's footsteps\n\nLONDON (CNN) -- Like mother, like daughter: Elizabeth Scarlett Jagger, the 14-year-old daughter of model Jerry Hall and Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, made her runway debut last week during the Paris fashion shows. \"She said she doesn't want to walk like me,\" said Hall, who appeared with Elizabeth at the show of Thierry Mugler. Hall was a top runway model in the 1980s.\n\nI want more. Show me the Buzz that was"
