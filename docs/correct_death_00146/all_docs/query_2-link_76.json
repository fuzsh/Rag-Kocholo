        "text": "As the National Museum of African American Music opens its doors, journalists from the USA TODAY Network explore the stories, places and people who helped make music what it is today in our expansive series, Hallowed Sound.\n\nJACKSON, Miss. — Blues is inspired by place — the railroads, fields and slaughterhouses where the musicians once worked by day; by the triumphs and struggles in life; by love found and love lost.\n\nAnd no place has produced more influential American bluesmen and women than the Mississippi Delta. So it's only fitting to celebrate some of the most noted musicians who came from Mississippi or whose ties to the genre were formed here.\n\nThese 25 recordings encapsulate the broad reach of Mississippi's influence on the blues.\n\nPlay on Spotify: Click here to listen to these songs and more\n\nW.C. Handy (1919)\n\nW.C. Handy, a Memphis ragtime musician, was a noted bandleader who became known as the “Father of the Blues,” after he encountered the musical style in the town of Tutweiler in the Mississippi Delta. \"Yellow Dog Blues\" was inspired by the song he heard played by a man while at a train station in Tutwiler.\n\nMississippi John Hurt (1928)\n\nMississippi John Hurt is known for his upbeat, fingerstyle guitar playing. Although the lyrics are seemingly a lament to lost love, \"Spike Driver Blues\" is Hurt's tribute to the legend of John Henry and the labor force that went into building the nation's railways, allowing for expanded trade and mass transportation. The song is included in the \"Anthology of American Folk Music,\" released in 1952.\n\nCharley Patton (1929)\n\nW.C. Handy may be the Father of the Blues, but it's Charley Patton who is credited as the founder of the Delta Blues — a variation of blues music specific to the Mississippi Delta region. Patton played slide guitar, sliding an object along the guitar strings to create the style's signature twang. \"Mississippi Boweavil Blues\" is a song about the boll weevil, an insect that would often infest the cotton fields where many farmhands made a living.\n\nSon House (1930)\n\nSon House, a sometimes preacher-sometimes musician, also played slide guitar and sang in a spirited, larger-than-life style that is seen in a lot of today's modern blues. Robert Johnson, Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters and other early blues artists are said to have been influenced by House. The lyrics for \"Walking Blues\" describe a transient lifestyle.\n\nSkip James (1931)\n\nSkip James is another early blues artist, known for playing the piano and guitar in what is known as the Bentonia style of blues, named after his hometown on the outskirts of the Mississippi Delta. The \"killing floor\" of the song's title refers to working in a slaughterhouse.\n\nRobert Johnson (1936-37)\n\nRobert Johnson, as legend has it, sold his soul to the devil in exchange for unparalleled guitar prowess at the crossroads — the intersection of Mississippi highways 61 and 49 in Clarksdale, a city in the heart of the Delta.

Kimbrough began hosting house parties, drawing musicians to the weekly jam sessions before opening his own nightclub in Holly Springs.\n\nOthar (Otha) Turner (2001)\n\nFife and drum bands may have originated in Europe but the musical style set down roots in north Mississippi.
