        "text": "First Line-Up:\n\nBob Hite - vocals, harp\n\nAlan Wilson - bottleneck guitar, harp, vocals\n\nMike Perlowin - lead guitar\n\nStuart Brotman - bass\n\nKeith Sawyer - drums\n\nPerlowin and Sawyer dropped out within a few days, so guitarist Kenny Edwards (a friend of Wilson) stepped in to replace Perlowin, and Ron Holmes agreed to sit in on drums until they could find a permanent drummer. Henry Vestine (who had been expelled from Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention for excessive drug use), asked if he could join the band and was accepted while still keeping Edwards on temporarily. Soon Edwards departed (he went on to form the Stone Poneys with Linda Ronstadt) and at the same time Frank Cook came in to replace Holmes as their permanent drummer. Cook already had substantial professional experience, having performed with such jazz luminaries as bassist Charlie Haden, trumpeter Chet Baker, and pianist Elmo Hope and had also collaborated with black soul/pop artists such as Shirley Ellis and Dobie Gray.\n\nThe line-up of Hite, Wilson, Cook, Vestine, and Brotman recorded the band's first (unreleased) album in 1966 produced by Johnny Otis; but the record was not actually released until 1970 when it appeared as Vintage Heat, released by Janus Records.\n\nOver a summer hiatus in 1966 Stuart Brotman effectively left Canned Heat after he had signed a contract for a long engagement in Fresno with an Armenian belly-dance revue. Canned Heat had contacted Brotman, touting a recording contract which had to be signed the next day, but Brotman was unable to make the signing on short notice. Brotman would go on to join the world-music band Kaleidoscope with David Lindley, replacing Chris Darrow. Replacing Brotman in Canned Heat was Mark Andes, who lasted only a couple of months before he returned to his former colleagues in the Red Roosters, who adopted the new name Spirits Rebellious, later shortened to Spirit.\n\nAfter joining up with managers Skip Taylor and John Hartmann, Canned Heat finally found a permanent bassist in Larry Taylor, who joined in March 1967. He was a former member of The Moondogs and the brother of Ventures' drummer, Mel Taylor, and already had experience backing Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry in concert, and recording studio sessions for The Monkees.\n\nIn this format (Hite, Wilson, Vestine, Taylor, Cook) the band started recording in April 1967 for Liberty Records with Calvin Carter who had been the head of A&R for Vee Jay Records and had recorded such bluesmen as Jimmy Reed & John Lee Hooker. They recorded \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\" backed with \"Bullfrog Blues\" became Canned Heat's first single. The first official album, Canned Heat, was released three months later in July 1967.\n\nSoon after Frank Cook was replaced with Adolfo de la Parra, who had been playing the drums in Bluesberry Jam (the band which evolved into Pacific Gas & Electric). As an official member of Canned Heat, de la Parra played his first gig on December 1, 1967, at the Long Beach Auditorium. This began what is regarded as the classic and perhaps best known Canned Heat lineup, which recorded some of the band's most famous and well-regarded songs. During this \"classic\" period, Skip Taylor and John Hartmann introduced the use of band member nicknames:\n\nLine-up: August 1967 - August 1969\n\nBob (The Bear) Hite - vocals, harp\n\nAlan (Blind Owl) Wilson - guitar, harp, vocals\n\nHenry (Sunflower) Vestine - guitar\n\nLarry (The Mole) Taylor - bass\n\nAdolfo (Fito) De La Parra - drums\n\n1966\n\nUNNAMED \"ACUSTIC\" REHEARSAL BLUES BAND (NOV 1965 (only one rehearsal)) 1) Alan 'Al' Wilson (aka Guru, aka Blind Owl) harmonica 2) Robert 'Bob' Hite Jr. (aka Big Bob Hite, aka The Bear) trumpet, jug 3) Michael 'Mike' Perlowin acoustic guitar 5) John Aloysius Fahey acoustic guitar\n\nUNNAMED \"ELECTRIC\" REHEARSAL BLUES BAND (NOV 1965 - DEC 1965 (only a couple of rehearsals)) 1) Al Wilson vocals, harmonica, tambura, flute, piano, rhythm guitar, slide guitar, bottleneck guitar 2) Bob Hite lead vocals 3) Mike Perlowin lead guitar 4) Keith Sawyer drums 5) Stuart Alan 'Stu' Brotman bass\n\nCANNED HEAT BLUES BAND #1 (DEC 1965 - JAN 1966) 1) Bob Hite 2) Al Wilson 3) Stu Brotman 4) Kenneth Michael 'Kenny' Edwards lead guitar 5) Ron Holmes drums\n\nJanuary 1966 Ash Grove, Los Angeles, CA (The band played there two nights in a row (supposedly their public debut).

to Laurel Canyon) and was followed by Mandel. With Taylor and Mandel gone, Vestine returned on guitar, accompanied by bassist Antonio de la Barreda who had played with de la Parra for five years in Mexico City and was previously a member of the groups Jerome and Sam & the Goodtimers. This lineup went into the studio to record with John Lee Hooker the tracks that would yield the double album, Hooker 'n Heat.\n\nOn September 3, 1970, just prior to leaving for a festival in Berlin, Alan (Blind Owl) Wilson died of a barbiturate overdose. Joel Scott Hill, who had played with the Strangers and later Moby Grape, was recruited to fill the void left by Wilson's death. The band still had a touring contract for September, as well as upcoming studio dates. That fall they toured Australia and Europe; including a show played in Baarn, the Netherlands, for the VPRO television program Piknik and the following summer they appeared at the Turku Festival in Finland.\n\nThis lineup of Hite, Vestine, Scott-Hill, de la Barreda and de la Parra did not last, as the band was in disarray; Scott-Hill and de la Barreda's attitudes were not fitting in with the rest of the band, and drummer de la Parra decided to call it quits. He was talked out of it by Hite, and it was Scott-Hill and de la Barreda who left the band instead.\n\nNew additions to the group were James Shane on rhythm guitar and vocals, Ed Beyer on keyboards, and Richard Hite (Bob Hite's brother) on bass. This lineup recorded what would be the band's last album for Liberty/United Artists Records, The New Age, released in 1973. The band embarked on another European tour, during which they recorded a session with Memphis Slim in Paris for the album Memphis Heat. They also recorded with Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown, while still in Paris, for the album Gates on the Heat (both were released by Blue Star Records).\n\nCANNED HEAT #8 (JAN 1973 - 1975) 1) Bob Hite 2) Henry Vestine 3) Adolfo de la Parra 4) James Shane 5) Edward 'Ed' 'Eddie' Beyer keyboards 6) Richard James Hite bass\n\nJanuary 19-20, 1973 Winterland, San Francisco, CA (with Quicksilver Messenger Service & Eggs Over Easy)\n\nFebruary 4, 1973 Keystone, Berkeley, CA\n\nMarch 4, 1973 Westbury Music Fair, Westbury, NY\n\nMarch 9, 1973 Civic Center, Hammond, IN (with Harvey Mandel and The Pure Food & Drug Act)\n\nMarch 27-28, 1973 Glass Menagerie, Nashville, TN\n\nMarch 31, 1973 Academy of Music, New York City, NY (with Quicksilver Messenger Service)\n\nApril 1, 1973 Banana Fish Park, Brooklyn, NY\n\nApril 8, 1973 Sports Arena, San Diego, CA (with Quicksilver Messenger Service)\n\nApril 15, 1973 Valley Forge Music Fair, Devon, PA (with Malo)\n\nApril 24, 1973 Olivet College, Olivet, MI\n\nMay 6, 1973 University of Findlay Croy Gymnasium, Findlay, OH (with REO Speedwagon)\n\nMay 11, 1973 Masonic Temple Auditorium, Detroit, MI (with Wilderness Road & Brownsville Station)\n\nMay 12, 1973 MSU Auditorium, East Lansing, MI (with Quicksilver Messenger Service & REO Speedwagon)\n\nMay 13, 1973 Cowtown Ballroom, Kansas City, MO (with Hookfoot)\n\nMay 18, 1973 Auckland, NZ\n\nJune 3, 1973 Pershing Auditorium, Lincoln, NE (with Savoy Brown, Blue Oyster Cult & Status Quo)\n\nJune 19, 1973 Mayfair, Newcastle, ENG\n\nJune 29, 1973 Roskilde, DEN (\"3rd Annual Roskilde Festival\", with Negro Spiritual & Elim's Kor, Ewald Thomsen, Spillemǽnd, Midnight Sun, V8 & Røde Mor)\n\nJuly 1, 1973 Montreux, SUI (\"Montreux Jazz Festival\", with Clarence Brown)\n\nJuly 14, 1973 Eilenriedestadion, Hannover, GER (\"Golden Summer Night\", with Eric Burdon and The Sun Secrets Band, Spencer Davis Group, The Pretty Things, John Sebastian, Vinegar Joe, Tempest, Jimmy Whiterspoon With Robben Ford & Tattoo)\n\nJuly 15, 1973 White City Stadium, London, ENG (with Edgar Winter Band, Sly and The Family Stone, Barclay James Harvest & Lindisfarne)\n\nJuly 21, 1973 Booth Farm, Buxton, ENG (\"Buxton Pop Festival\", with Chuck Berry, Wizzard, Groundhogs, Nazareth, Medicine Head, Edgar Broughton Band & John Peel)\n\nJuly 31, 1973 Wheeling High School Field House, Wheeling, IL (with Pure Prairie League)\n\nAugust 10, 1973 Draper, UT (\"Another Point of The Mountain Festival\", with Guess Who & Freddie King)\n\nAugust 24, 1973 Municipal Auditorium, Barre, VT (with The Tracks)\n\nSeptember 1, 1973 Chestuee Charolais Farm, Benton, TN (Cancelled.

Shortly thereafter, new manager Howard Wolf set up the struggling band with a gig at California's Mammoth Ski Resort. Bob Hite, in a foul rage, went off on the crowd, to the disapproval of Vestine, James Shane and Ed Beyer, who quit the band as a result.\n\nTaking the place of those who departed were pianist Gene Taylor and guitarist Chris Morgan, who both joined in late 1974. Taylor departed in 1976 in response to an argument during a tour of Germany, and after a brief fill-in by Stan Webb (of Chicken Shack), Mark Skyer came in as the new guitar player.

The Bear promptly hired a new bass player, Richard Exley, after befriending him on tour and watching his performance with the band Montana. Becoming fast friends with Hite, Exley toured the remainder of the year with the band and collaborated with Hite on many of the arrangements during their 1976 Texas Bicentennial Comeback Tour. Exley then quit the band after an argument over Hite's excessive drinking and drug use on stage. Frustrated and fed up, Exley joined the Texas Heartbreakers at the end of that year but returned periodically to fill in as a favor to Hite while the band struggled to find permanent members amidst heavy drinking and drug use. Exley remarked about his time with the band, \"No one ever remembers the bass player...\". This effectively reduced the band's members to just Hite and de la Parra.\n\nCANNED HEAT #10 (1977) 1) Bob Hite 2) Richard Hite 3) Adolfo de la Parra 4) Chris Morgan + 5) Stan Webb (aka The Man) vocals, guitar (only as \"guest\")\n\nApril 15-16, 1977 The Starwood, Los Angeles, CA (with C.Y.

During this time, de la Parra had bought into the partnership of an East Hollywood recording studio at which he was again working with former bandmate Larry \"The Mole\" Taylor. Taylor had been associating with virtuoso guitar player Mike \"Hollywood Fats\" Mann and virtuoso piano player Ronnie Barron and before long Taylor, Barron and Hollywood Fats were in the band. This version referred to by Hite and Mann as the \"Burger Brothers\" lineup, was soon joined by blind piano player Jay Spell, as Ronnie Barron walked out on the band after a blow-up between himself and Taylor.\n\nLine-up:\n\nBob Hite - vocals, harp\n\nMike Mann - guitar\n\nJay Spell - keyboards\n\nLarry Taylor - bass\n\nAdolfo De La Parra - drums\n\nThe Burger Brothers played the Tenth Anniversary of Woodstock at Parr Meadows in 1979. A recording of which eventually surfaced in 1995. Another recording made around this time was for Cream Records, who desired a more R&B-style sound than what Canned Heat was currently offering. This upset Hollywood Fats and Mike Halby was brought in to finish the project. After a falling out with de la Parra and Hite, Taylor and Mann were increasingly unhappy with the musical direction of the band and eventually left to focus more attention on their Hollywood Fats Band. Jay Spell was still on board and brought in bass player Jon Lamb and long-time guitarist Henry Vestine once again made his return to the band, with Hite and De la Parra as its leaders.\n\nLine-up:\n\nBob Hite - vocals, harp\n\nHenry Vestine - guitar\n\nMike Halby - guitar\n\nJay Spell - keyboards\n\nJon Lamb - bass\n\nAdolfo De La Parra - drums\n\nNo longer managed by Howard Wolf, Eddie Haddad set the band up touring military bases across the U.S., Europe and Japan non-stop. Returning with little pay after the hellacious tour, Jay Spell quit the band. Jon Lamb stayed on for one more tour in the south and just before Christmas 1980, he too quit the band; Hite attempted to give it another try by hiring a large enthusiastic biker with the moniker \"The Push\" as their manager; hoping that the band's popularity with the biker community would give them renewed energy. With new bass player Ernie Rodriguez joining the ranks, Canned Heat recorded the 1981 album, Kings of the Boogie, the last album to feature Hite on a few of the tracks.\n\nOn April 5, 1981, having collapsed from a heroin overdose during a show at the Palomino in Los Angeles, Bob Hite died in de la Parra's Mar Vista home at the age of 38.\n\nThe death of frontman Bob \"The Bear\" Hite was a devastating blow that most thought would end the career of Canned Heat; however de la Parra kept the band alive and would lead it back into prosperity over the next few decades. An Australian tour had been set up before Hite's death and harmonica player Rick Kellog had joined to finish off the Kings of the Boogie album. This incarnation of Canned Heat without Bob Hite was nicknamed the \"Mouth Band\" by Vestine and was a huge hit in Australia, especially with the biker crowd. Under the management of \"The Push\", the band toured the States playing biker bars and began work on a video known as \"The Boogie Assault\", starring Canned Heat and various members of the San Francisco chapter of the Hells Angels. As production for \"The Push's\" video dragged on, a drunken Vestine got into a brawl with Ernie Rodriguez and was once again out of the band, this time replaced by guitarist Trout.\n\nLine-up:\n\nTrout - guitar\n\nRick Kellog - harp\n\nMike Halby - guitar\n\nErnie Rodriguez - bass\n\nAdolfo De La Parra - drums\n\nThis version of Canned Heat would also soon dissolve with a dispute between Mike Halby and de la Parra after the recording of the Heat Brothers '84 EP.\n\nDuring the 1980s the interest in the type of music played by Canned Heat was revived and, despite the past tragedies and permanent instability, the band appeared to be revitalized. In 1985, Trout had left to join John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, so Vestine was once again back in the band and he brought with him new musical talent from Oregon in James Thornbury (slide guitar and lead vocals) and Skip Jones (Bass). They were dubbed the \"Nuts and Berries\" band by de la Parra, due to their love of organic food. It was not long before former members Larry Taylor (replacing Jones) and Ronnie Barron returned to round out the group. Versions of this lineup would record the live album, Boogie Up The Country, in Kassel, Germany, in 1987 and also appear at the Blues Festival Live in Bonn '87. Barron, just as before did not last long in this lineup, nor did Vestine, who was once again ousted from the band due to pressure from Larry Taylor. Replacing Vestine on lead guitar was Junior Watson, whose style emulated Hollywood Fats (who died in late 1986).\n\nLine-up: (1980) 1) Bob Hite 2) Adolfo de la Parra 3) Jay Spell 4) Henry Vestine 5) Jon Lamb bass 6) F.

Several former members including Mandel, Barron and Taylor joined up in de la Parra's effort for the album, Internal Combustion, which was released in 1994, but saw only limited release due to the returning manager Skip Taylor's falling out with Red River Records.

Mandel returned and Shumake left the band in 1996, and after the position of bassist was taken temporarily by Mark \"Pocket\" Goldberg, Greg Kage took the reins as the bass player, and after a reconciliation with Larry Taylor the band released, Canned Heat Blues Band, in 1996.
