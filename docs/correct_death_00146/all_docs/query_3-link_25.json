        "text": "There’s a lot to unpack when you have a conversation with Ben Harper. He’s a man that chooses his words wisely, and, as much as he is casual about the words he chooses, he’s also inherently (and effortlessly) built in a lesson to every line – whether you pick up on it, or not. He’s a man that doesn’t look for common ground, but rather, assumes you’re already there – graciously warm and as interested in what you’re up to as you are in him. Refreshing.\n\nWe happened to connect over baseball. After a spell of phone tag and making mention (and an apology) in one of the voicemails that my schedule was a bit muddy due to “coaching” obligations for my 6-year-old son’s baseball team, he made it a point to let me know that he knew exactly where I was at ...\n\n“I coached many of my kids’ teams, Chris ... Don’t let anything get in the way of that,” he said. “There’s nothing better, even if it is like herding cats at times.\"\n\nI tried to picture what it would be like to be coaching alongside Ben Harper, or to be a parent of a child on a Ben Harper led team. Kind of funny. But, as is the case with every celebrity I’m tasked with dialing up; at the root of it all is the fact that we’re all just people walking the same earth.\n\nI told him about Willy finally achieving his first hit, getting wrapped up in the moment, pumping his fists in celebration, and, in the same moment, forgetting to run to first base. We shared a laugh.\n\n“I love it! He made contact man, that’s just the beginning ... Red Sox bound, baby!”\n\nBen Harper and Charlie Musselwhite recently released their second record together, “No Mercy in this Land.” A record they knocked right out of the park. The following is a conversation of just that, in support of their June 7th date at The Music Hall.\n\nEDGE: Let’s talk about “No Mercy in this Land.” This is your second record with Charlie Musselwhite. Did you guys have any goals this time around based on the last recording experience?\n\nHarper: I think the goal was to strike deeper – to dig deeper. It’s not up to us to decide whether we did or not, but I felt like it was a step forward from the last record.\n\nEDGE: What’s the songwriting process like between the two of you? How are ideas/songs formed? In the same room, or does Charlie tap into technologies that allow him to contribute remotely?\n\nHarper: Basically, it’s about getting in the same room and seeing what comes together. I mean, I’ve been writing with Charlie in mind since we finished off the first record, “Get Up,” which came out in 2014. I felt like we needed to push forward following that; there was no reason not to. After touring in support of that release, we went our own separate ways to take care of our own separate things, but we stayed in touch. We’re friends, and through the process of traveling, recording, gigs – we’re incredibly close as friends and as musicians. I had had at least a handful, if not two handfuls of songs ready when we went in to the studio this time around. And then the band came in with ideas and songs, Charlie came in with ideas and songs … so we got in that room and mashed it all up.\n\nEDGE: I read that John Lee Hooker introduced you two. I want to hear all about that. John Lee Hooker holds a major chunk of real estate in my record collection.\n\nHarper: Yeah, man! Yeah, it’s cool. John Lee Hooker somehow got a hold of my first record, “Welcome to the Cruel World,” back in ‘92. I had heard through mutual friends that he dug it – which was a huge honor, obviously. He invited me to open up – he was doing some shows in Mill Valley, which wasn’t far from his house as a benefit for a club owner named Jeanie (Patterson), who ran Sweetwater, which was a legendary club in Northern California. It had fallen on some hard times, so John Lee was doing a week of gigs for free to help them with their finances. John Lee Hooker invited me to open the shows… The first day I walked in to get ready for the show, I stepped into the room and Charlie Musselwhite was sitting there next to John Lee … I had no idea he was going to be there. So, that was it. That was the start.\n\nEDGE: How does your work with Charlie inspire or inform the way you look at your music with or without him in tow? What do you appreciate about working with someone who is considered an elder statesman at this point in his career? Has he taught you anything you hadn’t dwelled on prior?\n\nHarper: Oh, for sure. To start, Charlie never plays the same solo twice. He’s what you take aim for. He’s what you strive towards as a soloist as far is improvisation is concerned, be it in the studio or live. He’s the master. Secondly, his work ethic. From touring, to the stage – on and off – to his ethic in the name of seeking his tone. His commitment to tone and production, live and in the studio is second-to-none. And third, his commitment to growth … He still listens to live takes and new music and finds inspiration and influence in of those collective experiences. For those three reasons, he is a constant source and well of motivation and inspiration.\n\nEDGE: You’ve collaborated with many, many musicians over the years. You’ve been a part of various serious bands. Does variety help fuel a successful creative existence? What’s the importance of shaking things up a bit from time to time?\n\nHarper: I think, for me, it’s been imperative. Whether it’s writing for other people like Rickie Lee Jones or Solomon Burke and stretching out your writing chops that way… Whether it’s touring with Ringo Starr, sitting in with Pearl Jam – it’s all these outside creative opportunities that push you in a way that can’t and don’t exist sitting around at home. You know?\n\nEDGE: To riff on that last one for a moment, you put out a record with your mom not all that long ago. How was the experience? How’d that idea come to light?\n\nHarper: It’s funny you mention that (laughs). Out of all the experiences and opportunities I’ve been fortunate enough to have had, who knew the greatest influence and growth would come from just striking it up at home with your mom? (Laughs.) My mom’s a badass. She just dropped a record of her own – with all her own stuff – a few weeks ago. She’s just a badass, man. A great singer, songwriter, guitar picker – since I began making music professionally, I had always wanted to do something with my mom. Even if it was just a song for YouTube, I had no idea what that would look like, and had no real intention of making a full record, but it just sort of happened. I brought some of my songs, she brought some of hers – and by golly we made a record.\n\nEDGE: In general, why music? Why do you seek it? Why do you create it?\n\nHarper: Man, I don’t know if mechanics, physics, being a novelist, being a school teacher – I don’t know if we choose these things, or if they choose us. You gotta find what you’re passionate about. Life’s too short and the world’s too small to not find what you love and go after it.\n\nEDGE: When did you first pick up the guitar? Was there a moment or experience that led you to chase music as a means of making a living?\n\nHarper: I got my first guitar as a kid, but it really hit me when I first got bit by the sound of the slide guitar, which was in my teens. Once the slide guitar bit, man, it bit for good. That was my sound. That’s what I was after. And I’m still actively in pursuit…\n\nEDGE: Do you enjoy the road?\n\nHarper: I love it. And I feel lucky that I get to do it. Honestly, every gig still feels like my first. I think when it stops feeling like that it may be time to roll up the carpet, but for now, I still get as nervous stepping on stage today as I did the first time I walked up there many years ago.\n\nEDGE: You’re coming to New Hampshire for a gig at the Music Hall here in Portsmouth. This is exciting. I’m excited. I first saw you play in New Hampshire maybe 15 years ago. You played at the University of New Hampshire with the Innocent Criminals. I wasn’t super well steeped in your music at that time, but the ticket was something like $10 and I took a chance. I was blown away. So anyhow, yeah, I’m excited. I think I already mentioned that though. Where are you at? What excites you about these gigs you’re doing with Charlie? What can folks expect when they come out to see you play?\n\nHarper: There it is! I appreciate that, Chris.\n\nYou know, I have real deep roots and family lineage in New Hampshire. My family had a farm called the Chase Farm in Claremont, New Hampshire. There’s a special feeling playing there and being in that area for me, just genetically…\n\nIn terms of playing with Charlie? Man, I never take these moments for granted. The blues will be in the house!\n\nEDGE: Let’s tie a bow around this. It might be a messy knot, but what do we need to do collectively introduce more mercy into our daily existence? Can it happen? Can there be mercy in this land? Will you pass it over to me, my friend?\n\nHarper: I see what you did there… (laughs). Man, listen, if I had that answer, I wouldn’t need to write the songs!\n\nTo grab one of the last remaining tickets, head over to www.themusichall.org right quic"
