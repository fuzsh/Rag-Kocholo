I have been enthralled by John Lee Hooker’s music since I was in college in the mid 1980s and working part time for Warren Balfour in the Cuesta College Music Department. (I ran the board for the vocal jazz band and the ‘No Deadwood’ Big Band. I also copied some of Warren’s blues records to cassette while I was working in the studio with the bands. Warren Balfour was the head of the music department at Cuesta, and I first heard John Lee Hooker from an album of his that I copied called ‘The Great Bluesmen’. This was an album that had one track each from several blues artists, and the Hooker track was titled ‘Hobo Blues’ and appeared to be culled from an Ed Sullivan TV broadcast. All the tracks on this out-of-print double LP were live.) I was mesmerized with Hooker’s iconic ‘slasher’ guitar style, and his haunting lyrics. I was lucky enough to see and record Hooker playing ‘Hobo Blues’ at the Bridge School Benefit in 1991, and also at the Native American Indian Benefits with Ry Cooder in 1992. I never expected to see him do that song, but I got to see, and record, it twice! I think all together I’ve recorded John Lee Hooker about six or seven times.\n\nHooker’s performance at the Mid-State Fair was on the Frontier Stage, one of the free stages, and not the main grandstands. This made the crowds a lot worse because people were packed in cheek to jowl and they had a policy of once the show started, if you left you could not return. So, bathroom breaks were out of the question!\n\nI selected a spot behind the board in the center of the bleachers, maybe 50 to 70 feet from stage. It was LOUD! To make matters worse, I didn’t realize the the -10db mic pads on my Neumann KM100 amplifier bodies were turned off until I got to the the fairgrounds, and because they are recessed you need a paper clip or such to engage them. Even a sharp pencil would have worked, but I had nothing except my keys and they were too big for the little recessed sliders. So, I had no choice but to try and keep the levels low on my DAT, but I knew that I was going to drive the input stage on my Beyer MV-100 preamp into clipping. (The Beyer has a ’stepped gain’ of 20, 40, or 60 db. 40 and 60 are WAY too high, unless you’re recording bug noises in the Amazon, so to say it’s not very adjustable is an understatement.) This recording has never seen the light of day until now, when Flying M was able to fix the problems caused by the clipping. There is a little bit of phase shifting and some slight anomalies here and there, but the processed result is a HECK of a lot better than it was before! I went to this show with my folks as well as my sister, and you can hear their voices at the end of the recording. You can hear me tell my mom when the show finished, ‘That was your first John Lee Hooker show. He’s only 82’. ‘Is he really? No way!’ she says. Actually, he was about 86 at the time of this show, so I was a little off. (Wikipedia lists his age at ’Around 88’ at the time of his death in June of 2001.)\n\nDo NOT Convert To MP3.\n\nEnjoy!

I’m sorry that he never lived to actually see them performed. On the surface it seemed these benefit concerts were held to commemorate the 500 year anniversary of Columbus ‘discovering’ the new world. 1492-1992. Actually, it was more to open people’s eyes to the suffering and misery that the Native American people have endured during that 500 year history. One of the Native American speakers between sets commented, “Why do we celebrate Columbus? He was LOST!!” Santana headlined on Saturday and Bonnie Raitt headlined on Sunday. Saturday was billed as ‘All Our Colors, The Good Road Concert” and Sunday was billed as ‘Healing The Sacred Hoop’. I remember that between songs, Bonnie remarked that there were a bunch of young girls trying to get into John Lee Hooker’s dressing room. “That’s what I call ‘Healing The Sacred Hoop'”, she said. They were awesome shows. Some of the sets were kind of quiet and have more crowd noise on the recordings than I would have liked. I’m kind of amazed that there are not more recordings of these shows out there. I recorded both days up on the lawn with Nakamichi CM-300s with CP-2 omni capsules->Sony WM-D6C. The music went on from about 3pm to around midnight, so bringing in enough blank tape was a major problem. Another big problem was that since the shows started so early in the afternoon it was nearly impossible to hide recording equipment in broad daylight. I rode up to the shows with my friends Dave and Brian and it wasn’t until I was putting my equipment together in the back seat of the car that I discovered that I had the CP-2 omni capsules on the mics instead of the CP-1 cardioid caps. I was really upset because the omnis add a lot more crowd noise because they lack the side and rear isolation that the cardioids have. My previous recording had been in a bar back home the week before and we did a matrix mix with a feed off of the soundboard plus the two CM-300 omnis that were hung from the ceiling. I had forgotten to replace the omni capsules, which I hardly ever used, with the CP-1 cardioids.\n\nI got everything in OK on Saturday but Sunday I had a problem. (This saga became one of my best ever taping stories in the years to come!) Because it was kind of cold at night I had brought extra clothing to both stay warm and conceal equipment. I had taken a long-sleeved flannel shirt and wrapped up the mics and knotted the sleeves together. I hid the D6 and cables and a couple of tapes with an ace bandage wrapped around my crotch and had no other option but to put the mics at the bottom of a backpack with misc. crap on top of it. I looked for a line with a security guy that seemed to be doing a minimum of searching and had Dave and Brian go through the turnstiles ahead of me. At the last second a supervisor took over my line just as I stepped up to the search. My heart kind of did a double beat but I hoped for the best. I always relied on the old magician’s sleight-of-hand trick of showing them what you wanted them to see while at the same time distracting them from what you wanted to hide. While my friends went through the turnstiles the supervisor was rummaging around in my bag and felt the mics wrapped up in the shirt. “What’s This?,” he wanted to know and stopped the line. I had to think fast as he was trying but could not untie the knots on the shirt. “It’s a beer bottle,” says I, after the other guy had already torn my ticket. He pulled me out of line and, yelled at me,”You can’t bring that in here!” I stepped out of line and said that I’d get rid of it. Meanwhile, Dave looked back and saw what was going on. I put my hand up in the air palm up and he tossed the car keys to me over the top of the turnstiles. I went back to his car, opened the trunk, and took out two blank cassettes from under my ace bandage and left them in the car. I unwrapped the mics and shoved them down next to the tape deck under the ace bandage and hoped for better luck! When I went back I picked a different line and got through without a problem. The usher at the gate did a double take when he saw that the ticket had been torn already and then signed off on the back by the supervisor. He asked me about it and I said, with my best ‘dumb-guy’ look, that they had found a beer bottle on me and made me go and get rid of it. What did he say? You guessed it! “You can’t bring that in here!!!!” Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nDave found me inside as I was making my way to the lawn and asked me about it as I gave him back his keys. I told him I had to lighten the load a bit and had to leave some tape behind. “I guess I just won’t tape Don Henley,” I said. “Oh you’ve Got to tape Henley,” he said. Later on, about 5 minutes before Henley came on stage, I looked up to see Dave drop two blank tapes in my lap. “How in the hell did you get Those??” I asked. He said that he had gotten cold and asked the people at the gate if he could go out and get his sweatshirt! Naturally, he had another thought in mind as well. I laughed and shook my head. That’s my story and I’m stickin’ to it! That’s the closest I’ve ever come to getting caught taping.\n\nOnce night fell, I could get the mics up higher and make a better recording, but in broad daylight I had no other choice but to sit on the ground under the repeater towers and build a little pile of clothing on top of my backpack. I hid the mics in the sleeves on the shirt and ran the mic cables back to the backpack where the D6 was.\n\nThe music was pretty good. I couldn’t see much of the stage, especially in the daytime, because the view screens were not on. I remember that the Hooker / Cooder set and the Lindley / Cooder set was kind of quiet. Those sets have more crowd noise on them, plus the omni caps sure didn’t help matters. It would have been nice to have the shotguns but they are a little noticeable!\n\nI finally got around to making 24 bit digital transfers of the master cassettes. Thanks so much to Flying M for the post production.

I’ve seen/recorded four Bridge School Benefits and this one was my favorite. I don’t know if it was the band line up, or because it my first Bridge show, or if it was because of Bill Graham’s recent passing, but there was a lot of energy in the air. I really wanted to record a Bridge show, after having obtained 1st generation cassettes of the 1989 show. I believe that this is the first time that I recorded Neil Young. My friends Dave, Brian, and Rick met up with my ex wife and me at the show. They had reserved seats, while I wanted to be near the repeater speakers on the lawn to record. Dave told me that, though there was a pat down search getting into Shoreline, they would allow you to bring in food. I had the idea to take a small box of saltine crackers and hollow it out. I cut down the cellophane wrappers and only left about 15 crackers in each wrapper. My D6 fit perfectly inside the box, and I left it open with the remaining crackers exposed. We brought in a small tupperware of sliced cheese and cold cuts, and some sealed bottled water. I had a canvas bag with a solid sturdy bottom to hold everything. I took the microphones and custom XLR >RCA shortened cables and used a velcro Ace Bandage to conceal them on my body. Fortunately, being November, we had heavy coats that further concealed the gear. (It was really cold up on that lawn in November!) I opened the bag when we went through security, being careful to not let the gate people notice the added weight of the recorder inside, and we went in without a hitch. I ran the Nakamichi microphones in a Levi jacket, with holes sewn into the front two pockets so the capsules would protrude. I used hollowed out 35 mm film can lids to go over the microphone bodies to keep them from falling through the bottom of the pockets. As long as I stood near the repeater speakers it worked really well. I also had long hair that I wore down to further conceal the microphones. The recorder went into a hip pack so I was totally self contained. This was a really emotional weekend, with the recent death of Bill Graham. Tracy Chapman dedicated ‘Amazing Grace’ to Bill during her set. Nils Lofgren, who played the most touching set of any Bridge set I ever saw, made repeated references to Bill and told a story of getting caught by Graham trying to sneak into the Fillmore East. Nils Lofgren’s song ‘Big Tears Fall’ was very powerful. Nils asked the crowd if there were any parents in the crowd, and I remember thinking of our daughter Lucy, who was born in May of ’91 and was at home with Nikki’s folks while we went to the shows. I had just recorded two very emotional Grateful Dead shows at the Oakland Coliseum on October 27 and October 31. The 10/27/91 show was the first Dead show after Bill’s helicopter crash, (They opened with Bill’s favorite Dead song ’Sugar Magnolia’), and the Halloween show featured Ken Kesey as a special guest. After the Bridge School Benefit show, Nikki and I drove my ’67 VW camper bus to Atherton where we parked in front of my friend Karl’s friend’s parent’s house. Sunday morning we got up early and drove to Golden Gate Park to record the Bill Graham Benefit, which was another emotional all day event. It was billed as ‘Laughter, Love, And Music’. It was quite the weekend. I heard later that Dave, who didn’t stay overnight to see the Sunday Bill Graham memorial concert, ran out of gas driving his friends home in the middle of the night near Santa Margarita, CA.\n\nDo NOT Convert To MP3.\n\nEnjoy!
