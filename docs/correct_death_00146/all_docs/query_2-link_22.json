        "text": "Hello there! This week our blog features an iconic R&B tune, Boom Boom. We will first discuss the original version by John Lee Hooker. Next, we will review a cover by The Animals, and finally a cover by Buddy Guy.\n\nJohn Lee Hooker and Boom Boom:\n\nJohn Lee Hooker was an R&B singer-songwriter. We generally give the year of birth for our subjects, but in Hooker’s case this is the source of much conjecture. You can find his birthdate listed as 1912, 1915, 1917, 1920 and 1923, with the most popular choice being 1917. It is believed that he was born in Tutwiler, Mississippi, the youngest of 11 children to his sharecropper and Baptist preacher father.\n\nThe Hooker children were not allowed to have access to any music except religious spirituals. However, John Lee Hooker’s parents divorced and his mother subsequently married blues singer William Moore. Hooker credits Moore and his sister’s boyfriend Tony Hollins for teaching him how to play blues guitar.\n\nAt the age of 14 John Lee ran away from home. He located first in Memphis, Tennessee, but then traveled to the North where he got a job in Detroit working for Ford Motor Company. Hooker connected with blues and jazz musicians in Detroit, and got his first break when a demo of his song Boogie Chillen was released and became the best-selling ‘race record’ (the predecessor to the ‘rhythm & blues’ category) of 1949.\n\nAt this time, African-American musicians typically received next to nothing in royalties for their records. So Hooker traveled around making recordings for several record labels. He was paid cash up front, and he used a number of aliases on his songs, to avoid being caught violating his record contract. So, 50s blues recordings by Johnnie Lee, John Lee, John Lee Cooker, Texas Slim, Delta John, Johnny Williams or the Boogie Man were quite likely to be John Lee Hooker songs.\n\nJohn Lee Hooker’s real exposure began when he participated in annual tours of Europe by American artists, called The American Folk Blues Festival. This started in 1962.\n\nBelow is a photo of John Lee Hooker from 1997. With his shades and his Gibson electric guitar, Hooker looks like one of the cooler dudes on the planet.\n\nJohn Lee Hooker wrote and recorded Boom Boom in 1961. As he was performing in Detroit at the time, he assembled a band of outstanding studio musicians. Many of them later became members of Motown’s famed Funk Brothers house band. This included James Jamerson on bass, Joe Hunter on piano, Benny Benjamin on drums, and Hank Cosby and Mike Terry on saxophone.\n\nHooker’s extremely straightforward lyrics are directed at his woman. He describes what he intends to do to her, plus a vivid description of how she makes him feel.\n\nBoom, boom, boom, boom\n\nI’m gonna shoot you right down\n\nKnock you off of your feet\n\nAnd take you home with me\n\nPut you in my house\n\nBoom, boom, boom, boom\n\nHaw haw haw haw\n\nHmm hmm hmm\n\nHmm hmm hmm hmm\n\nI love to see you strut\n\nUp and down the floor\n\nWhen you’re talking to me\n\nThat baby talk\n\nI like it like that\n\nOh yeah\n\nTalk that talk\n\nWalk that walk\n\nBut it is not the lyrics that make the song great. A classic 12-bar R&B blues tune, it starts out with a short guitar riff, followed by a four-note response from guitar and bass. This is then repeated two times, and is one of the great openings to any R&B song.\n\nHere is a scene from The Blues Brothers. Jake and Elwood are trying to round up members of their old ensemble to re-form the Blues Brothers Show Band. As they drive along an inner-city Chicago street, we hear a street musician playing an electric guitar. It is John Lee Hooker, and he is playing Boom Boom in front of a diner called the Soul Food Cafe.\n\nHooker essentially reprises his recording of Boom Boom. His deep rasping voice is just perfect for this tune, and he plays his signature electric guitar licks. The line “haw haw haw haw” is instantly recognizable to anyone who has heard a ZZ Top song. The guitar part is sufficiently iconic that everyone who covers the song (more than 150 covers at present) reprises the same notes.\n\nAfter listening to Hooker, Jake and Elwood step into the Soul Food Cafe, a greasy-spoon diner, where they are addressed by the waitress (Aretha Franklin). At this point, we immediately realize that this version of Blues Brothers has been overdubbed into Italian. Matt “Guitar” Murphy, who is apparently a cook at this establishment, greets the Blues Brothers. When Jake & Elwood invite Matt to re-join their band, Aretha breaks into “Think,” warning Matt of the consequences should he leave her (spoiler alert: Murphy joins up with Jake & Elwood, and leaves Aretha despite her admonition).\n\nWhat a great R&B song! Aretha (who co-wrote the tune) is in great form, with a superb group of backup singers. Apparently it was nearly impossible for Blues Brothers director John Landis to film Aretha in this scene, because she never performs a song the same way twice. As a result, she had no idea how to ‘lip-sync’ her song, as she could not remember how she had performed a given take.\n\nAnyway, the combination of the two songs is priceless, and it is great to see John Lee Hooker’s appearance in this classic movie.\n\nBoom Boom reached #16 on the Billboard R&B charts in 1962. It was also something of a crossover hit as it climbed to #60 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop playlists. Strangely, Boom Boom was not included in the Blues Brothers soundtrack album.\n\nIn the late 60s, Hooker began collaborating with rock musicians. He was one of the R&B greats who merged the blues with rock ‘n roll. His first major collaboration was with the blues-rock group Canned Heat; in 1970, they released an album Hooker ‘n Heat. Hooker’s 1989 album The Healer included collaborations with Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt, Robert Cray, Los Lobos and George Thorogood.\n\nIn 1995 the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame produced a list of “The Songs That Shaped Rock ‘n Roll.” Hooker’s Boom Boom and Boogie Chillen were included on that list. Boom Boom was also inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nJohn Lee Hooker was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. He was also awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000 (Hooker won four Grammy Awards between 1990 and 1998).\n\nIn 2001, John Lee Hooker died in his sleep at his home in Los Altos, California. He was a terrific artist whose main fame came rather late in his life. But better late than never!\n\nThe Animals and Boom Boom:\n\nEric Burdon is a great British blues vocalist. He was born in 1941 in Newcastle, England to a working-class family. Early on, Burdon developed a love for music, especially the blues.\n\nEric had particularly grim memories of his childhood education. He had the following to say about his primary-school education:\n\n“Some teachers were sadistic– others pretended not to notice– and sexual molestation and regular corporal punishment with a leather strap was the order of the day”.\n\nLike so many British Invasion musicians, Burdon attended Art College, where he and his pals listened to as much American blues music as they could get their hands on. In 1962 Burdon joined a Newcastle band, the Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo. Shortly after Burdon joined, the group changed its name to The Animals.\n\nBelow is a photo of Eric Burdon and the Animals in the 60s. Eric Burdon is second from right.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe original Animals consisted of Burdon on lead vocals, Price on keyboards, Chas Chandler on bass, Hilton Valentine on guitar and John Steel on drums. The quintet quickly established a reputation for their fusion of blues with hard rock, and they moved to London once they had developed a following. The Animals became an important part of a 60s British blues revival, a group of musicians that included the Yardbirds and the Rolling Stones.\n\nThe Animals soon positioned themselves as a successful British Invasion band. Burdon’s great bluesy vocals were combined with Price’s inventive keyboard work and Valentine’s creative guitar solos.\n\nThe group notched a number of hits, including their cover of House of The Rising Sun that reached #1 on the Billboard pop charts. Other Animals hits included We Gotta Get Out of This Place and Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood.\n\nSo here are Eric Burdon and The Animals in a live performance of Boom Boom. This took place at London’s Wembley Stadium in 1965.\n\nWell, both the audio and video here are rather crappy, but I hope you can sense the excitement that this group generated, and their devotion to iconic blues songs. Alan Price on keyboards is quite talented, whereas the other instrumentalists are simply competent. But it is evident that Eric Burdon is a great blues vocalist. One can easily see the influence that Burdon’s hero Ray Charles had on Eric’s vocal style.\n\nUnfortunately, the “golden era” of The Animals did not last long. Their first hit was in mid-1964, and Alan Price left the band in 1965. He was followed by John Steel one year later.\n\nThere were a number of reasons for the rapid break-up of The Animals. For one thing, the musical rights for the Animals songs belonged to Alan Price. Burdon and the other Animals were under the impression that the Animals tunes had been a collaborative effort with everyone contributing. They claimed that Price was listed as the songwriter merely because his name (Alan) was first alphabetically.\n\nNevertheless, Price was the sole recipient when the royalty checks began rolling in. This caused considerable resentment among his bandmates, and that was coupled with dodgy management of the group. The Animals re-shuffled their lineup, but the “New Animals” lasted only until 1969.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1971, Burdon moved to San Francisco and joined forces with the California funk-rock band War. As “Eric Burdon and War,” the group had one big hit with the song Spill The Wine.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1984, Eric Burdon and the Animals were in a nearly constant state of breaking up, re-forming, and breaking up again. Following that period, Burdon has continued a solo career for an additional 40 years.\n\nThere was a period of a few years in the 1980s when Burdon lost the rights to “The Animals.” However, he re-gained the rights a few years later. A pivotal issue in the lawsuit between Burdon and John Steel was that Burdon had gone on tour as “Eric Burdon and The Animals.” The judge ruled that this implied Burdon had relinquished the rights to “The Animals.” Ain’t the law weird?\n\nThe Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. However, Eric Burdon did not attend the ceremony, and the band did not perform at the event. In 1996, Chas Chandler died of an aneurysm.\n\nNot surprisingly, several touring groups have used the name “The Animals.” In 1982, Hilton Valentine and John Steel formed a group named “Animals II.” That group continued on as “Animals and Friends” after Valentine left the group in 2001.\n\nIn 1998, Eric Burdon formed a group called “Eric Burdon and the New Animals,” which was re-named “Eric Burdon and The Animals” in 2003. In 2016, Burdon formed yet another group,\n\nIt’s nice to see Eric still on tour, and it is refreshing that his pipes are still in good form. “Don’t let me be misunderstood,” I hope that Eric Burdon continues on tour for as long as his health allows.\n\nBuddy Guy and Boom Boom:\n\nAbout 35 years ago, I saw the great blues singer and harp player Junior Wells perform at Chicago’s Checkerboard Lounge. The venue made a strong impression on me – it was really a dump! Everything about the place, from the storefront to the club’s neighborhood to the décor, struck me as grubby and low-class.\n\nAnd the food was also pretty basic. On the other hand, the music was terrific. Junior Wells was an extremely talented blues musician. Both his singing and harmonica playing were first-rate and a real treat.\n\nAfter the show I was talking with my friends, and I remarked on something that had impressed me. “The house band was really rocking,” I said, “particularly the guitarist, who was just terrific.”\n\n“I should hope so,” said my friend, “because that was Buddy Guy performing with his old friend Junior Wells.” I was embarrassed to tell my friend I didn’t know who Buddy Guy was, so I bought one of his albums the next chance I got. I was blown away to experience one of the greatest blues guitarists of all time.\n\nBelow is a photo of Buddy Guy performing in New York in 1970.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBuddy Guy has had an epic career. After he arrived in Chicago from his native Louisiana in the late 1950s, he began backing up musicians such as Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf at Chess Records studios.\n\nTheoretically, Guy’s career should have taken off at this time, but the Chess Records brass were convinced that Buddy Guy’s performing style would never be commercially successful. In fact, Chess Records CEO Leonard Chess described Guy’s music as “noise.”\n\nSo Chess relegated him to backing up their stable of stars, or saddled him playing soul ballads or jazz instrumentals on his solo releases. In the meantime, blues guitarists who heard Buddy play were blown away by his talent and creativity.\n\nListening to artists like Jimmy Page, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jeff Beck and Bill Wyman rave about Buddy Guy’s playing style and his technical innovations, one would expect that Buddy was a proven superstar. However, although he had an established reputation in Chicago blues circles, on the national level he was still toiling in relative obscurity until the early 1990s. In fact, Buddy’s circumstances were sufficiently dire that\n\nas late as 1967, Guy worked as a tow truck driver while playing clubs at night.\n\nBuddy’s big break finally occurred when Eric Clapton produced an epic series of concerts at London’s Royal Albert Hall in 1990 and 1991. Clapton invited many of the world’s premier guitarists to appear on those shows, and Buddy Guy was one of the invitees.\n\nThe sessions produced a couple of CDs and a DVD of the performances, titled 24 Nights. Buddy Guy’s guitar playing at these concerts established him as a legitimate superstar, and he rapidly signed a recording contract that jump-started his career. Since then Buddy Guy has gained worldwide fame as one of the great blues guitarists. In 2005, Buddy Guy was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, where he was introduced by Eric Clapton and B.B. King.\n\nHere is Buddy Guy in a live version of Boom Boom. This took place at the 2008 Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival in New Brunswick, Canada.\n\nYou may notice that Buddy Guy’s version is extremely close to the original by John Lee Hooker. This is because many of Buddy’s concerts include a segment where he plays guitar in the style of other great bluesmen. Here, Buddy is playing and singing Boom Boom in the style of John Lee Hooker, sort of an homage to his old friend.\n\nUntil now we have emphasized Buddy Guy’s guitar playing. However, he is also a terrific blues vocalist. He has a powerful voice, and is a really impressive singer. Buddy can instantly switch from ear-splitting power chords to barely audible notes, and he has clearly mastered (and sometimes introduced) a host of playing styles and special effects.\n\nSeveral guitarists, including Eric Clapton, readily admit to “borrowing” various of Buddy’s licks. Even Jimi Hendrix copied some of Buddy’s theatrical tricks, such as playing the guitar behind his back, or with his teeth. I saw Buddy Guy perform about 2 years ago; although he was then 81 years old, and looking rather frail, he still produced some awesome sounds.\n\nAfter watching Buddy Guy perform, one has to ask – what was Leonard Chess thinking? Why didn’t Chess see what appears immediately obvious, namely that Buddy Guy was one of the great guitarists of our time? Perhaps Buddy’s guitar technique was so advanced that Leonard Chess couldn’t relate to it? This is hard to fathom.\n\nEven in 2019, Buddy Guy performed over 100 concerts. We hope that he continues to perform as long as humanly possible. What a living treasure!\n\nSource Material:"
