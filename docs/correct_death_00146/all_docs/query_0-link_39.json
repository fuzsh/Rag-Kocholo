        "text": "(1917–2001). American singer, guitarist, and songwriter John Lee Hooker was considered one of the greatest and most distinctive blues artists. A primitive guitarist, he is known for playing simple harmonies, five-note scales, and one-chord, modal harmonic structures. He introduced the world to the country-blues rhythms of boogie music. His first recording, “Boogie Chillen” (1948), helped lay the foundation for rock and roll, and his signature driving rhythm and rich, deep baritone voice produced a unique sound that influenced rock groups such as the Rolling Stones.\n\nHooker was born into a sharecropping family in Clarksdale, Mississippi, on August 22, 1917. He learned the guitar from his stepfather and developed an interest in gospel music as a child. In 1943 he moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he made his mark as a blues musician. On such early records as “Boogie Chillen,” “Crawling King Snake,” and “Weeping Willow (Boogie)” (1948–49), Hooker, accompanied only by an electric guitar, revealed his best qualities: aggressive energy in fast boogies and no less intensity in stark, slow blues. Owing to contractual problems, he recorded under an array of pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker, John Lee Cooker, Delta John, Texas Slim, and Birmingham Sam and His Magic Guitar. Later hits included “Dimples” (1956) and “Boom Boom” (1962).\n\nHooker toured widely from the 1950s and appeared in the motion pictures The Blues Brothers (1980) and The Color Purple (1985). His album The Healer, released in 1989, was an enormous success and won a Grammy Award for best blues recording. Later albums included Mr. Lucky (1991) and the Grammy-winning Don’t Look Back (1997). Hooker was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. He died on June 21, 2001, in Los Altos, California."
