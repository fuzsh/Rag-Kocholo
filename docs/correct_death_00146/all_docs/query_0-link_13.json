Legendary blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. The son of a sharecropper from Tutwiler, MS., he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar adaptation of  Delta blues. He learned to play guitar at age 7 from his stepfather, blues musician William Moore. Another early influence was Shreveport bluesman Tony Hollins, who dated his sister Alice. He taught Johnnie \"Crawling King Snake\" and \"Catfish Blues\" as a teenager. He ran away from home at age 14 and headed to Memphis, TN. where he performed at the New Daisy Theatre on Beale St. for money. In the 1940's he relocated to Detroit, where he gained quite a following on the Hastings St. blues circuit. It was here that he put down his acoustic and bought his first Epiphone electric guitar. His recording career began in 1948. His first single \"Boogie Chillen\" became a hit, and best selling record of 1948-49. He recorded throughout the 50's and 60's for several labels, including Chess Records in Chicago. In 1962 he gained greater exposure touring with the American Folk Blues Festival. His most famous appearance was in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers performing \"Boom Boom\" in the role of a street musician. His greatest commercial success came in the early 90's with several albums of blues classics he recorded in collaboration with Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt, Jimmie Vaughan, Van Morrison and others. His music has been covered by many huge artists including The Allman Brothers Band, ZZ Top, The Doors, The Rolling Stones and The Grateful Dead.
