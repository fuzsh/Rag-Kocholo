        "text": "1918 Â· Attempting to Stop the War\n\nTo end World War I, President Wilson created a list of principles to be used as negotiations for peace among the nations. Known as The Fourteen Points, the principles were outlined in a speech on war aimed toward the idea of peace but most of the Allied forces were skeptical of this Wilsonian idealism.\n\n1920 Â· The Detroit Wall\n\nThe Detroit Wall is a half mile long wall that was constructed to serve as a wall of racial separation as a physical barrier between white and black homeowners in northwest Detroit. Today the wall is mostly gone with only a small portion of it located at a local park."
