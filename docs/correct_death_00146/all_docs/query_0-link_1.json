        "text": "In 1943, Hooker was \"discovered\" by record-store owner named Elmer Barber, who helped record him and get him gigs. Presently, he was signed to Modern Records, which put out the single \"Boogie Chillun,\" which was an immediate hit.\n\nPeople say the music industry is corrupt now, but in those days it was really fast and loose. \"They got me really big,\" Hooker said, \"but record companies is all crooks. They wasn't giving me that much money, not my royalties. And what makes it bad is, you know they're dealing from the bottom of the deck. ... Ain't no wool on my eyes; I know what they're getting [from me], but I want to get famous, and that's what it took. If I would fight with 'em to get a fair deal, I wouldn't a got nowhere.\"\n\nTHROUGHOUT THE 1950s, Hooker made records and toured mostly to black audiences, but by the late '50s, blues was gaining popularity with whites, coasting on the coattails of the folk revival. In 1959, Hooker played at the Newport Folk Festival with Joan Baez and Bob Gibson, and later on that year he went to London for the first time.\n\nHooker was huge in London, where he was wildly embraced by--among others--young rock musicians who covered his songs. In the '60s, the Animals, the Yardbirds and the Spencer Davis Group all recorded versions of his songs. The Rolling Stones publicly worshipped him, and Jimi Hendrix often credited Hooker as a big influence.\n\nDid Hooker ever feel resentful that they were stealing his stuff? \"Yeah, I did,\" he told me. \"But I wanted them to do it. They got a hold of me and did my sound, but that way people know where they got it from. They knew it come from me and 'Boogie Chillun.' And I knew they cared a lot, that was the thing. They tried to sound like me, but they just couldn't. They came close, though.\"\n\nBack in the United States, his relationship with the mother of his children broke up, and he came to California, driving himself all alone in a Cadillac to Oakland. He lived there for many years before relocating to the other side of the Bay in the early '80s and having his career resurrected by a renewal of interest in the blues by white pop stars.\n\nTo me, Redwood City always seemed like the oddest place on earth to find the living embodiment of the blues. But on second thought, why not? The blues, as Hooker said, are universal. They belong everywhere, in town and in the country, in Europe and in America, in heaven and in hell. The blues belong to the past, but they also belong to the future--and for life everlasting, amen.\n\nRemember John Lee Hooker: On Sunday (July 8), JJ's Blues presents a barbecue and blues day for friends and musicians to celebrate the great bluesman's life and music. The event takes place at JJ's, 3439 Stevens Creek Blvd., San Jose. (831.243.6441)\n\n[ San Jose | Metroactive Central | Archives ]"
