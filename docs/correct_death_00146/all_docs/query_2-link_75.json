        "text": "ROCK AND POP\n\nMusicians and night-club proprietors live complicated lives; it’s advisable to call ahead to confirm engagements.\n\nB. B. KING BLUES CLUB & GRILL\n\n237 W. 42nd St. (212-997-4144)—May 31: If there’s a bluegrass group out there that can give Alison Krauss & Union Station a run for their money, it’s Rhonda Vincent & the Rage. A terrific singer and instrumentalist (primarily she plays the mandolin), Vincent fronts a crack unit consisting of the guitarist Josh Williams, the fiddler Hunter Berry, the bassist Mickey Harris, and the banjo player Kenny Ingram. The night promises lightning-fast picking and harmonies as close and gorgeous as they come. June 4: The British hard-rock journeyman Glenn Hughes played bass for Deep Purple back in the early seventies and logged some hours fronting a mid-eighties incarnation of Black Sabbath. His most recent solo album, “Music for the Divine,” from last year, found him branching out into funk with the aid of members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nBOWERY BALLROOM\n\n6 Delancey St. (212-533-2111)—Through June 1: The National, a tight quintet of Ohio transplants with a penchant for shimmering, au-courant indie rock, wraps up a five-night home-town stand. June 4: The singer-songwriter Keren Ann.\n\nFILLMORE NEW YORK AT IRVING PLAZA\n\n17 Irving Pl., at 15th St. (212-777-6800)—June 1: CSS, an artsy coed ensemble from São Paulo that approaches dance rock with an old-fashioned punk attitude. (The members claim that they didn’t know how to play their instruments when they first got together, a few years ago.) Their album, “Cansei de Ser Sexy” (Portuguese for “tired of being sexy”), is full of bubbly guitar-and-synth-fuelled English-language romps about the socialite Paris Hilton, the fashion magazine Visionaire, and other twenty-first-century pop-culture ephemera. With the lascivious Tampa-based rappers Yo Majesty. June 4: The Phish keyboardist Page McConnell.\n\nHIGHLINE BALLROOM\n\n431 W. 16th St. (212-414-5994)—June 2: The British hip-hop outfit the Brand New Heavies came out of London’s acid-jazz scene in the eighties with an accessible hybrid of soulful grooves and smooth funk. They had a number of R. & B. hits in the late eighties and early nineties, when their lead singer was N’Dea Davenport, a lithe dynamo with a sensuous voice and an arresting presence. She left the group for a solo career after their 1994 album, “Brother Sister,” was released, but she reunited with them last year for the record “Get Used to It,” and now she’s back fronting the band. June 5: The Pipettes, who formed in Brighton, England, a few years ago, are three young women (plus an all-male backing band that stays in the shadows). The stylish trio favor polka-dot dresses, synchronized dance moves, and celebratory pop crafted in the classic Phil Spector mold. Their wink-and-a-nod approach (the joyful single “School Uniform” spreads the love evenly between boys and girls) has sent them up the English charts, though they have yet to win over much more than the blogosphere here.\n\nJOE’S PUB\n\n425 Lafayette St. (212-539-8777)—May 31: The Soul of John Black. John (JB) Bigham, a veteran guitarist who has played with everyone from Miles Davis to Eminem and is perhaps best known for his work with the funk-ska outfit Fishbone, leads this Los Angeles band. The group’s self-titled début, from 2003, was an exceptional and eclectic collection of R. & B. that drew on folk and rock sources. “The Good Girl Blues,” Bigham’s new release, goes straight to the roots of American music, paying a shrewdly contemporary tribute to the likes of Leadbelly, John Lee Hooker, and Muddy Waters. June 3: Fairport Convention gives an acoustic performance. Back in the late sixties, this legendary British folk-rock unit launched the careers of Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny, among others. With the founding member Simon Nicol still steering, the band sounds as rowdy and randy as ever. Their latest release is “Sense of Occasion.”\n\nJONES BEACH THEATRE\n\nWantagh, N.Y. (212-307-7171)—June 5: Fall Out Boy and +44 (featuring former members of Blink 182) may upset cranky old punk-rock purists (who consider them wan pretenders), but don’t tell that to their sizable audiences of teen-age fans, who revere them as if they were the Sex Pistols and the Clash reincarnated.\n\nMADISON SQUARE GARDEN\n\nSeventh Ave. at 33rd St. (212-307-7171)—May 30: The former Pink Floyd linchpin Roger Waters. After the departure of the mentally unstable Syd Barrett, the bassist Waters became the band’s guiding force, writing some of the music and virtually all the lyrics for a series of seventies-defining albums, none more successful than “Dark Side of the Moon,” from 1973, which charted on the Billboard 200 list for an astounding fifteen years (according to Waters’s people, an estimated one out of every fourteen Americans under the age of fifty owns the record). Waters brings his “Dark Side” world tour to the area this week, performing the high-concept record in its entirety, complete with vintage light-show effects. The other half of the performance will include nuggets from other Pink Floyd albums of the seventies and perhaps a nod to the sixties material as well, following Barrett’s death, last year.\n\nRIVER TO RIVER FESTIVAL\n\nThe musical portion of this free downtown cultural celebration gets under way on June 1 with the folksy harmonies and psychedelic experimentation of the Animal Collective. (South Street Seaport, Pier 17. For more information, visit www.rivertorivernyc.com.)\n\nROSELAND\n\n239 W. 52nd St. (212-307-7171)—June 5: The Tennessee band Kings of Leon was dubbed the “Southern Strokes” upon its début a few years ago by a besotted British press. Since then they have impressed a few foreigners who are slightly more influential in this country—U2, for example, who took them on tour. The Kings are here with songs from their latest record, “Because of the Times.”\n\nTOWN HALL\n\n123 W. 43rd St. (212-840-2824)—The Nashville angel Gillian Welch has been busy of late. In recent years she has accompanied Emmylou Harris, Solomon Burke, and Ryan Adams—and she’s even taken up the drums for Old Crow Medicine Show. The latest place to find her is in the company of Conor Oberst, the singer-songwriter also known as Bright Eyes. His new album, “Cassadaga,” finds Oberst and his band establishing their own alternative-country sound, with Welch helping out on the compelling cut “Classic Cars.” The two are here through June 1.\n\nWEBSTER HALL\n\n125 E. 11th St. (212-353-1600)—May 31: The Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, a California trio, is named for the crew in Brando’s “Wild One.” They’ve backed off (a bit) from their speedy, Stooge-like origins, but they still have plenty of leather-jacket attitude. The songs from their new record, “Baby 81,” brim with power hooks, but blues roots are more in evidence, and a strong acoustic guitar provides a sturdy engine.\n\nJAZZ AND STANDARDS\n\nBIRDLAND\n\n315 W. 44th St. (212-581-3080)—May 30-June 2: Regina Carter had a banner year in 2006, releasing a heartfelt album, “I’ll Be Seeing You: A Sentimental Journey,” and receiving a MacArthur fellowship. Expect the afterglow of such accomplishments to color the performance of this acclaimed violinist, whose music ranges freely from standards to classical- and pop-influenced material.\n\nBLUE NOTE\n\n131 W. 3rd St., near Sixth Ave. (212-475-8592)—May 29-June 3: The Bobby Hutcherson quintet. The vibraphonist’s forthcoming album, “For Sentimental Reasons,” is a relatively mellow affair, but there’s still plenty of juice left in this mature improviser. His band here includes the pianist Renee Rosnes, the guitarist Russell Malone, and the drummer Al Foster.\n\nDIZZY’S CLUB COCA-COLA\n\nBroadway at 60th St. (212-258-9595)—May 29-June 3: The Bill Charlap trio. Working with the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Kenny Washington, Charlap displays the poise and taste, and, increasingly, the depth of such grand piano stylists as Hank Jones and the late Tommy Flanagan. The trio’s new album is “Live at the Village Vanguard.”****\n\nFEINSTEIN’S AT LOEWS REGENCY\n\n540 Park Ave., at 61st St. (212-339-4095)—Through June 2: The actor Peter Gallagher is a multitasking performer as comfortable on a Broadway stage as he is in front of a TV or film camera. For his Feinstein’s début, “Songs and Stories,” he’ll offer an insider’s picture of a versatile working life.\n\nVILLAGE VANGUARD\n\n178 Seventh Ave. S., at 11th St. (212-255-4037)—May 29-June 3: The veteran drummer Billy Hart leads a band of younger players: the saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Ben Street, and the pianist Ethan Iverson, on a busman’s holiday from the Bad Plus. The Vanguard Jazz Orchestra holds sway on Mondays."
