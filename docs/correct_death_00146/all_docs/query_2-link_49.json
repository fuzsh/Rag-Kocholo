        "text": "John Lee Hooker\n\nAlone: Live at Hunter College, NYC 1976\n\nBMG\n\nA Blues Masterclass From a True Master.\n\nWhere was the ‘sound desk’ that this was recorded on in 1976 when I was buying bootlegs in the 70’s and 80’s?\n\nThe quality on offer here is as clear and sensitive as any ‘Live recording’ I’ve heard this current century; and coupled with John Lee Hooker’s ‘special delivery’ means that this album is essential listening for Blues enthusiasts anywhere and everywhere.\n\nApparently some of these songs and, most notably the first album have been released before; but on this release both sets are here in all of their righteous and stereophonic glory… for the first time.\n\nNeatly Hooker’s set list here as an intriguing mix of old and new, hits and misses too, with everything sung with the self-confident swagger we associate with the great man; starting with I Miss You So, which features some of the sharpest and scariest guitar I ,ay ever have heard and Hooker drops each and every note in as if they are musical time bombs.\n\nHooker introduces the second song in his trademarked slow drawl; the dark and mysterious “I’m Bad, Like Jesse James” thus …\n\n“I hope you dig the lyrics on this\n\n… Dig what I’m gonna do to this cat...”\n\nand you’re compelled to do just that …. and the outcome will have you smiling and still working out the meaning several songs later.\n\nGrowing up, as I did in the 1970’s while there was a Blues Boom’ in the NE of England (that never went away’, I wish I had a pound for every version I think I’ve heard of I’ll Never Get out of these Blues Alive, Boom, One Bourbon One Scotch One Beer, Boogie Chillun and of course Crawling King Snake (all of which can still be heard somewhere tonight) but hearing John Lee Hooker 50+ years after this recording was made of him sitting by himself in a College venue with just his semi-acoustic for accompaniment is really and truly spell binding.\n\nHistory shows that in 1976 John Lee Hooker and his contempories was ‘out of fashion‘ with the British Blues Boom being replaced by Glam Rock and America diving head first into Heavy Rock; so hearing the crowd’s loud appreciation for every song here and Hooker’s own confidence oozing out of every note and word has to be heard to be believed in many ways.\n\nAs well as the obvious songs we’d all expect there are some stunners here that I don’t believe I’ve heard before, with When My First Wife Left Me, the punchy You Ain’t Too Old To Shift Them Gears and the shear heart break throughout all 7 minutes of I Wish You Could Change Your Ways will stay with me forever; and show not just what a great songwriter John Lee Hooker was; but what a Poets heart he had too.\n\nPrimarily this album appears to have been released fr the burgeoning vinyl market, but my download copy still sounds as sharp as a tick on the office hi-fi ….. so don’t worry if you’re not a hipster.\n\nIt would be all too easy to tell you that any of the Classic Songs of his are my Favourite Tracks; but as usual I’m going left of centre and choosing something I’d not heard before; and even then it’s a tie between two magnificent songs ….. Put Your Hand on Your Hip and Dark Room which somehow for one man and a single guitar sounds as ‘heavy’ as most everything from Cream or Moby Grape’s canon of work (yes, that’s a gross exaggeration on my behalf but listen once and tell me I’m totally wrong.)\n\nWhichever way you look at his age; Hooker was in his 50’s when this concert took place, and ‘Greatness’ hadn’t quite been bestowed on him by the Blues Cognoscenti, but Hooker sings and plays these songs with as much confidence and self-belief in his skills as if he’s headlining a sold-out stadium full of fawning acolytes … and I love him even more because of that.\n\nReleased 23rd June 2023\n\nhttps://johnleehooker.com/"
