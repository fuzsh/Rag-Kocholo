        "text": "1912\n\nBorn on August 22, in Tutwiler Mississippi (not far from Clarksdale), son of preacher and share-cropper William Hooker (born 1871 or even earlier; died according to some files in 1923, other information says much later) and Minnie Ramsey (probably born 1875; died around 1950). They raise a family of eleven children (not all survive).\n\n1917\n\nThis is the most frequent published date of Hookerâs birth. Hookerâs Social Security card (ctsy Jim OâNeal), registered late 1942, while living in Lambert, Mississippi, states that Johnie (sic) Lee Hooker was born in Glendora, Tallahatchie County on August 22, 1917, to William Hooker and Lee Ethel Moore (ed note: prob the by-then remarried Minnie).1920\n\nThe Hooker family moves to the nearby Fewell plantation in Vance, Mississippi.\n\n1922 or poss 1926Hooker's parents separate and John's mother remarries to sharecropper and spare-time blues singer William Moore. John Lee is the only child of the Hooker's who moves with his mother to Moore's farm in Lambert, Miss (again not far from Clarksdale).\n\n1928\n\nStarts to play the guitar seriously. John had been given a guitar as a present from Delta blues singer Tony Hollins earlier and a new guitar from Moore now. John is inspired by Moore (who plays with Charley Patton, Blind Lemon Jefferson and Son House).\n\n1933-1934\n\nAfter a couple of earlier trips to Memphis (to stay with an auntÂ´s), Hooker leaves Mississippi for Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n1935\n\nArrives in Cincinnati, Ohio - singing the gospel and the blues (after a short spell in Knoxville, Tennessee).\n\n1939-1942\n\nJoins the Army forces near Detroit - and later possibly traveling South again. He was registered in Lambert, Mississippi in October 1942 (and possibly also visited Alabama and New Orleans).\n\n1943\n\nSettles in Detroit, Michigan, working as a janitor and playing the blues at night. Short-lived marriage with Alma Hopes - one daughter, Frances, and yet another failed marriage with Sarah Jones (divorced 1944).\n\n1944\n\nMeets and soon marries Maude Mathis (around 16 at the time) - a marriage lasting for 25 years. Their first child, Diane, born on November 24, 1946 - the second Vera (later known as Zakiya) born on April 1, 1948 - and more to come, including John Lee Jr (in January, 1952) and Robert (in July, 1953). Later came daughters Karen, and Shyvonna, plus Lavetta (Williams).\n\n1947\n\nReceiving yet another guitar - this time from T-Bone Walker, who like many others called Johnnie, \"The Kid\". Settles in a rooming house on Madison Street and finds more club works around Hastings Street, jamming with Eddie Burns and his partner John T. Smith, and with guitarist Andrew Dunham in clubs like the Forest Inn and Club Basin, and with his own small combo featuring James Watkins,pno and Curtis Foster,dms.\n\n1948\n\nHookerÂ´s first manager, Elmer Barbee, records several demos during the Summer in Barbee's record shop (and also \"Miss Sadie Mae\" in Toledo). Barbee brings the demos to record producer Bernie Besman around September and Besman produces HookerÂ´s first commercial recordings at United Sound Studios on 5840 2nd Blvd - with Joe Siracuse the engineer (a total of 10 tracks - plus alternates - are cut at this first regular session). Besman leases the recordings to the Bihari BrothersÂ´ Hollywood-stationed label Modern Records as John Lee Hooker & His Guitar. On November 3, the first Hooker single is issued, titled \"Boogie ChillenÂ´\" - which actually is the B-side of \"Sally May\". That same month Hooker starts \"moon-lighting\", as manager Barbee sells several recordings to Detroit producer Joe Von Battle - the first pseudonym record being \"Black Man Blues\", released as Texas Slim on King Records in November or December - other recordings, which Barbee sells to Battle are resold from Battle to Savoy and its subsidiary Regent (RegentÂ´s \"GoinÂ´ Mad Blues\" as by Delta John and SavoyÂ´s \"Low Down Midnite Boogie\" as by Birmingham Sam are issued during February and March 1949). The pseudonym records will continue to appear on the market during HookerÂ´s years with Modern Records. Hooker lives with his family at Jameson Street off of McClellan and Charlevois in Detroit.\n\n1949\n\n\"Boogie ChillenÂ´\" hits the Race Records Juke Box Chart #1 in February. \"Hobo Blues\" b/w \"Hoogie Boogie\" (the latter cut at Hooker's second session for Besman, probably on February 18), issued in March (both hit the Race Records Chart, #5 and #9), \"Weeping Willow Boogie\" and later \"Crawling King Snake\" become HookerÂ´s Modern Records three follow-up 78s. The latter, peaking at the new R&B Chart #6 in December, is coupled with \"Drifting From Door To Door\" (which is actually a re-titling of one of BarbeeÂ´s first demos, \"When My First Wife Left Me\"). BarbeeÂ´s production for the tiny Danceland label is issued (as by Little Pork Chops), but noone recognizes the record (Barbee also cuts a Hooker demo of \"Cotton PickinÂ´ Boogie\" with James Watkins at the piano - as all Barbee-recordings waxed at 609 Lafayette Street). Around August Joe Von Battle (who records Hooker in his shop - JoeÂ´s Record Shop at 3530 Hastings Street) cuts several Hooker tracks as Texas Slim for King Records (the first issues being \"The Numbers\" and \"Nightmare Blues\"). In November and December Besman issues the first two of several singles on the local Detroit label Sensation Records, \"BurninÂ´ Hell\" (featuring Eddie Burns on harmonica) and \"Huckle Up Baby\" (the latter record peaks at the R&B Chart #15 in February 1950).\n\n1950\n\nSeveral Texas Slim recordings are issued on King (sold to the label by Joe Von Battle - with two of the tracks recorded by Idessa Malone). \"House Rent Boogie\" c/w a terrific rendition of \"Wandering Blues\" (based on Charles BrownÂ´s classic \"DriftinÂ´ Blues\" and which Hooker had recorded in several versions earlier), produced by Idessa Malone on Staff Records, is issued in December as by Johnny Williams and in March 1951 Modern release the Besman produced record of the boogie (\"John LÂ´s House Rent Boogie\"). Around the end of the year an obscure record on Gone Records surfaces as by John Lee Booker and his Guitar, titled \"Mad Man Blues\", recorded by Joe Von Battle, where Hooker calls himself Sam (on previous pirate recordings Hooker had often called himself Poor Joe, Poor Slim, and Poor Tony). The single will be reissued during 1951 on Chess Records.\n\n1951\n\nResigns a contract with Bernie Besman up to February 29, 1952 (although BesmanÂ´s last recording session for Modern is dated May 22, 1952). Hooker records several titles as by Johnny Williams for Gotham in the early part of the year (or possibly in late 1950) - a Philadelphia label - although the recordings are done in Detroit - possibly by Joe Von Battle. The last Gotham single though, \"Mean Old Train\", issued with the obvious pseudonym John Lee in March 1952. Hooker records direct for Chess Records in Chicago on April 26, issued as John Lee Booker during the latter part of the year (a.o. \"Leave My Wife Alone\"). On some of the tracks Hooker is accompanied by Eddie Kirkland. The original \"IÂ´m In The Mood\" (with - probably again - Eddie Kirkland on second guitar) is recorded with multi-vocal-tracks on August 7 by Besman and becomes a great hit (reaching US Pop #30 and hitting the R&B Juke Box Chart #1 in November - the hit lasts into 1952). In October Chess Records issue \"Ground Hog Blues\" (a new version of an unissued recording originally done for Gotham) c/w \"Louise\" as by John Lee Booker. Several early Barbee-recordings appear on the Chicago-based label Chance during lat 1951 and early 1952 as by John Lee Booker and his Guitar, including the fine \"Talkin' Boogie\".\n\n1952\n\nModern Records go to court, winning the right to reissue the Chess-recording \"Ground Hog Blues\" b/w \"Louise\" on their label (now issued as by John LÂ´ Hooker in January). Hooker debuts as a radio DJ and tours with Eddie Kirkland and with Muddy Waters in the South. On April 24 Hooker waxes a second huge Chess session (this time probably in Detroit). \"High Priced Woman\" from the Chess productions of April 1951 is issued, followed by \"Walking The Boogie\" c/w \"Sugar Mama\" from the 1952 session - but most tracks from the second session, a.o. \"The Journey\", will not be issued until the LP market is hitting Europe during the early 1960s. During the Summer Bernie Besman moves to Los Angeles and the Biharis decide to produce Hooker themselves from now on (with Joe Bihari travelling to Detroit to cut records - still with BernieÂ´s engineer Joe Siracuse in the studios). BesmanÂ´s last Hooker production will be \"ItÂ´s My Own Fault\" (issued a couple of years later on Chess, featuring Bob Thurman,pno) and Modern RecordsÂ´ first Bihari-productions will result in the single \"Rock House Boogie\" c/w \"ItÂ´s Been A Long Time Baby\".\n\n1953\n\nEddie Kirkland is featured on most of the Hooker recordings of 1953 (one of the best Modern cuts is \"Down Child\"). Hooker continues his pirate recordings - now making several singles, a.o. \"Stuttering Blues\", for Henry Stone on DeLuxe (prob. in Cincinnati) as by John Lee Booker (the recordings will re-appear on the Stone-associated labels RockinÂ´ and Chart during 1954 and 1956).\n\n1954\n\nSigns a contract with Specialty Records and makes recordings for that label at Esquire Recordings Studios in May, produced by Johnny Vincent (a.o. the single \"IÂ´m Mad\" and a new version of HookerÂ´s signature melody, \"Boogie Rambler\", featuring Johnny Hooks,tens; John Griffith,pno; Theo Roosevelt,b; and regular drummer Tom Whitehead). A second Specialty session is held at United Sounds (where Besman had made his recordings) in October, produced by BesmanÂ´s engineer Joe Siracuse. The recordings from that session will remain unissued until the 1970s. Although contracted to Specialty Hooker continues to record for Modern into 1955 (and makes recordings for Devora BrownÂ´s Fortune Records).\n\n1955\n\nHis last Modern single, \"IÂ´m Ready\" (with Otis Finch,tens; Thurman, Kirkland, and Whitehead) is issued in October and Hooker signs with the Chicago label Vee-Jay Records, owned by Vivian Carter and her brother Jimmy Bracken - the first single, \"Mambo Chillun\", is issued in November (featuring Jimmy Reed,hca - and recorded at Universal Studios).\n\n1956\n\nThe classic \"Dimples\" is recorded in Chicago for Vee-Jay in March (with a combined Chicago/Detroit rhythm section comprising Eddie Taylor,gtr; George Washington,b; and Whitehead,dms).\n\n1957\n\nBecomes an established Vee-Jay artist, recording a.o. the fine \"I See Yu When YouÂ´re Weak\" (although his label-mate Jimmy Reed is selling better).\n\n1958\n\n\"I Love You Honey\" on Vee-Jay Records hits the R&B Chart #29 in December (featuring Detroit-pianist Joe (Edward) Hunter plus Eddie Taylor,gtr; Everett McCrary,b; and Richard Johnson,dms).\n\n1959\n\nJaques Demetre and Marcel Chauvard \"introduce\" Hooker to EuropeÂ´s record buyers, and The first Vee-Jay LP, \"IÂ´m John Lee Hooker\", is issued (including several re-cuts of his famous Modern hits and with some tracks featuring drummer Earl Phillips).

Chess Records issue the classic Hooker album comprising 1951-52 recordings, \"House Of The Blues\", and follow it up with \"John Lee Hooker Plays And Sings the Blues\" in 1961.\n\n1961\n\nThe third Vee-Jay LP, \"The Folk Lore of John Lee Hooker\" is issued, featuring a.o. a handful of tuff rhythm & blues originals with Lefty Bates,gtr & hca (not Jimmy Reed, but Lefty himself); Quinn Wilson,b; Earl Phillips;dms and possibly Pops Staples also present. The six recordings of January 4 (of which only four are included on the album) are nowadays all true classics: \"Want Ad Blues\", \"Will The Circle Be Unbroken\", \"IÂ´m Going Upstairs\", \"I Left My Baby\", \"Hard Headed Woman\", \"IÂ´m Mad Again\". Bob Dylan debuts in New York - opening for Hooker at GerdeÂ´s Folk City. Hooker uses Eddie Kirkland to back him on an album recording for Savoy (Fancourt lists the session in 1959). The recordings stayed in the can and were not issued until more than ten years later as \"SittinÂ´ Here ThinkinÂ´\" on Muse - only one track, \"When My Wife Quit Me\", was to be issued on a Savoy various-artists LP in 1964. Hooker records his \"BurninÂ´\" LP in Chicago around Christmas for Vee-Jay with Detroit musicians including reeds (session-men: Joe Hunter (prob not Ivy Jo),pno; Hank Cosby,tens; Mike Terry,bars; Larry Veeder,gtr; James Jamerson,bsg; Benny Benjamin,dms) after a long period of \"folk blues\" waxing.\n\n1962\n\n\"Boom Boom\" (from \"BurninÂ´\") hits US Pop #60 in July (and the Hot R&B Chart #16). Vee-Jay issue \"The Best of JLH\" (a compilation of his 1955-1961 period in Chicago). Hooker tours Europe with the Original American Folk Blues Festival package (including T-Bone Walker, Memphis Slim and Willie Dixon).\n\n1963\n\n\"The Big Soul of John Lee Hooker\" album on Vee-Jay, featuring \"Frisco Blues\", is issued (with a female backing - not the Vandellas but Mary Wilson and the Andantes). Atco Records issue the album \"DonÂ´t Turn Me From Your Door\" in February (featuring Henry Stone DeLuxe tracks of 1953 and new recordings of 1961, the latter ones recorded in Miami), where one really can trace HookerÂ´s gospel roots (and in 1969 Stax Records find more Stone tracks of 1961 to issue on \"ThatÂ´s Where ItÂ´s At!\" - some of them previously issued on Guest Star and Storyville). Hooker refers to the electric bass player featured on several of the tracks as \"Earl\". John Lee again uses the soon-to-be-famous Detroit \"Motown\" musicians to back him on half of the tracks of the Vee-Jay \"On Campus\" album, featuring \"DonÂ´t Look Back\" (including reeds, rhythm - and brass - and this time possibly The Vandellas). Another classic from that LP is \"Birmingham Blues\". JLH cuts several tracks at the Newport Folk Festival originally issued on Vee-Jay (\"Concert At Newport\") and remixed at Vanguard Records in 2002 (\"Live At Newport\").\n\n1964\n\nMakes his last session for Vee-Jay Records in early/mid-year, including the original version of \"It Serves Me Right (To Suffer)\" (featuring a lead guitarist who may be Wayne Bennett). Kent Records (a Bihari label) issue \"Original Folk Blues\", comprising famous Modern tracks. Hooker tours Britain with John Mayall and a UK issue of \"Dimples\" reaches UK Pop #23 and he plays it on \"Ready Steady Go\" TV. Hooker also waxes an album with Tony McPheeÂ´s Groundhogs in London in November. The album will appear on several labels under several titles years later, although the most well-known are \"...

The Bluesway album \"If You Miss Â´Im ... I Got Â´Im\" is recorded in May in Los Angeles, where Hooker is backed by cousin Earl Hooker and his band with Jeff Carp,hca (Earl dies in Chicago on April 21, 1970).

It is not the first \"alternate\" Besman issue. Specialty Records and United Artists had already come up with three LPs during 1970-71 (\"Alone\" and \"GoinÂ´ Down Highway 51\" on Specialty and \"Coast To Coast Blues Band - Any Where Any Time Any Place\" on United Artists). The ABC album \"Never Get Out Of These Blues Alive\" (including the title track duet with Van Morrison, recorded in September 1971) reaches US Pop #130.

Ed Michel produces the underrated, and last ABC album, \"Free Beer And Chicken\", recorded in Sausolito and Los Angeles May 14-23 (this time with the brass direct behind Hooker - no dubs).

An album covering the Hooker tracks appears on U.S. Collectables \"Gotham Golden Classics - The Rare Recordings\". Hooker records with Canned Heat again in January and in October a re-rendition of \"Baby Lee\", featuring Robert Cray, is produced by Roy Rogers and recorded at Russian Hill in San Francisco by engineer Samuel Lehmer (who will engineer most of HookerÂ´s later recordings). The recordings will be featured on \"The Healer\" album of 1989.\n\n1988\n\nFinds himself a new manager, Mike Kappus. The new association had started slow already in 1976 (when Kappus started to be Hooker's agent) but - from now - incredible things will happen - with the Blue Rose organization (Kappus, Roy Rogers and JLH) and the Rosebud Agency - giving Hooker a completely \"new career\" after more than 40 years in business. Roy Rogers produces several titles with guest artists including Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt, Los Lobos and George Thorogood in and around San Francisco during April and May - completing the album that in the year-to-come will make Hooker quite a rich man.\n\n1989\n\nBernie Besman issues \"40th Anniversary Album\" on DCC (comprising re-titlings of old Besman Detroit-tracks). In the UK the album is issued a year later on Demon as \"The Detroit Lion\". Hooker waxes Jimi HendrixÂ´ \"Red House\", featuring Booker T. Jones in March.

During 1992 - 1994 Ace Records in England (and Flair and Specialty in US) issue several CDs comprising Modern, Besman and Specialty originals, the most famous being the 1993 CD \"The Legendary Modern Recordings 1948-1954\" - with SpecialtyÂ´s chronological \"Graveyard Blues\" (featuring Besman recordings 1948-1950) and \"EverybodyÂ´s Blues\" (Besman 1950-1951 and almost all Specialty recordings of 1954) also truly worthwhile buys.

Zakiya Hooker and John Lee Hooker, Jr. keep HookerÂ´s tradition alive together with the whole Hooker Estate.\n\n2003\n\nAn official John Lee Hooker web site - www.johnleehooker.com is founded, and 2003 is declared \"The Year of the Blues\".

During the original rock ' n' roll years of 1956-1958 Hooker delivered a total of a further seven Vee-Jay singles (although Hooker toured heavily).\n\n2006\n\nIn the early months the reissue label Hip-O releases a 20-track collection featuring recordings from Hooker's long career (from \"Boogie Chillen'\" to \"The Healer\"), titled \"The Definitve Collection\", which serves as an almost perfect sample for a Hooker \"beginner\". Hip-O follow up with a 2CD-set featuring a further more 15 classics in April, 2007, titled \"Gold\". During the Summer Proper Records (ex-Charly) issue i nice litte \"public domain\" 4CD-box titled \"The Boogie Man\", featuring 98 recordings from the Detroit-period (including the Modern hits and several psedonym recordings). On October 31 a 4CD-box, titled \"Hooker\" is issued on Shout!Factory in co-operation with the Hooker Estate, covering the whole of Hooker's career. The Box really has all the true gems and is THE TRUE HOOKER ANTHOLOGY featuring 26 Detroit 48-55, 26 Chicago 56-64, 15 Coast-to-Coast 65-91 and 17 Frisco 88-98 recordings.\n\nfrom mediabistro.com\n\nNeed Some Money:\n\nJohn Lee Hooker estate, pursued by IRS, licenses catalogue\n\nThis scoop from Billboard today /May 19, 2006/ just about breaks our heart:\n\nJohn Lee Hooker could not read or write, according to his daughter, but the legendary Delta bluesman's estate is hoping to educate a new legion of fans about his 50-year musical legacy. The Hooker estate, which is controlled by daughter Zakiya Hooker, has licensed five of his best-selling albums from the '80s and '90s to reissue specialist Shout Factory for release in North America and two discs for release in Europe. The six-figure deal is for seven years.\"\n\nTo even see JLH's name in print about pains me. Back in the mid 90s, when I'd just gotten back from China and was working as a house slave for Charlie Rose, I tried to book Hooker on the show. It turned out, John Lee hated to fly, and wasn't gonna come to New York; Charlie wasn't about to fly to Detroit. Not making that segment happen remains my most unhappy career moment to date. Of course, Charlie would go to DC to tape a whole special on Johannes Vermeer, but... That I didn't push Charlie to go to Detroit, now that that John Lee is lamentably gone forever, simply kills me.\n\nWell, anyway. There is some good news in the Billboard piece: \"Out by year's end will be an 84-track, four-disc boxed set, the first ever for Hooker. Shout Factory chief operating officer Bob Emmer expects half the material on the $59.98 set to come from its newly acquired albums, while the other half will be licensed from current rights holders, including EMI, Fantasy and Vee-Jay.\" I am preordering that monster right now.\n\nTrack listing (AllMusicGuide with review)\n\nJohn Lee Hooker Box Set Named #1 Reissue of the Year by Rolling Stone in December 2006\n\nand # 1 Reissue of the Year at the Blues Foundation Awards in May 2007 /more on this/ More\n\n2007\n\nShout!Factory start to reissue CDs from Hooker's Rosebud years - now with bonus tracks, and also reissue the legendary \"I'm John Lee Hooker\" album.\n\n2008\n\n32 tracks are included on the Shout!Factory 2-CD-set \"John Lee Hooker Anthology - 50 Years\" (with 30 of the tracks from the \"Hooker\" 4 CD-set plus \"Jealous\" and \"Boogie from Russian Hill\").\n\nCompiled by Claus RÃ¶hnisch\n\nJohn Lee at YouTube"
