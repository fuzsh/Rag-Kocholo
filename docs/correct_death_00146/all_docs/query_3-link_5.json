I don’t normally comment on the concert reviews included on this site, but this is a case where I will agree to disagree with Mr. Kanzler’s assessment:\n\n“In John Steinbeck’s ‘Of Mice and Men’ a character named Lenny underestimates his own strength. So in the process of hugging animals and people to show his affection, he destroys the life in them. George Thorogood treats the blues the way Lenny treated the objects of his affection – with deadly overkill.\n\nThorogood and his (aptly named) Destroyers appeared at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic Thursday night in a show recorded for later broadcast on MTV, the music video pay channel. “You’ll be throwing your Destroyer records out the window and buying new ones by the artists we’re going to bring out tonight,” Thorogood told his audience, referring to a galaxy of blues artists who came on during the course of the two-hour show to guest with him and the Destroyers. Unfortunately, the guests hardly were given much of a chance to do their own thing, as they were relentlessly pummeled by the heavy metal volume and lack of sensibility of Thorogood and his cohorts, aided and abetted by rowdy fans more interested in hearing themselves scream than in listening to the music.\n\nAmong the most sorely abused of the guest victims were Willie Dixon and John Lee Hooker, two blues giants who were forced to sing to the jackhammer beat of the Destroyers, in the process sacrificing most of the humor and subtlety they command when singing with a less distracting rhythm section.\n\nGuitarists Elvin Bishop and Albert Collins fared better, using their clean, piercing instrumental tones to cut through the Destroyer barrage and give Thorogood an abject lesson in how blues guitar solos can be built with the force of a dramatic line, not just the power of an over-amplified guitar. And next to Thorogood’s rock reductionism of the blues even John Hammond Jr., usually painfully correct in his blues atavism, sounded pretty good on vocals and harmonica.\n\nGeorge Thorogood obviously loves the blues, as evidenced by his choosing to do many selections made famous by his guests and others, like Muddy Waters’ (sic) ‘Bad to the Bone.’ But loving the blues is not enough if you don’t understand them, and Thorogood obviously has not advanced much beyond a childish, undiscerning glee in his comprehension. He does not seem to have the least inkling about the subtleties of dynamics, timing and emotion that make great blues players great.\n\nCompared with Bishop and Collins, Thorogood’s guitar work cannot even be considered blues. It is repetitious, loud, raw-toned like scraping metal, and relies on power chording rather than blues chords. In short, it is heavy metal at its worst. The Destroyers are as bombastic as their leader, especially the ham-handed bassist and a tenor saxophonist who doesn’t realize that screams and honks should come as the climax of a solo, not comprise the entire solo.\n\nGeorge Thorogood actually may believe that in exposing blues giants like Hooker, Dixon and Collins to his audience, he is initiating them into a better understanding of the blues… [The] TV show may give more exposure to the blues guests than the live show did, since the sound can be remixed for TV and watchers can adjust volume below the scalding point.”\n\nSource: Newark Star Ledger.

Pg. 6-2.\n\nConcert Reaction:\n\nDivina Infusino of the Milwaukee Journal wrote about all three acts appearing on the Summerfest Main Stage on July 5, 1982 in Milwaukee:\n\n“Setting the tone was Ely, an Austin, Texas, rockabilly maniac who turned out to be the surprise hit of the evening. With a six-piece band, including an accordion, saxophone and keyboard player, Ely picked at every grass root of American music — Memphis country, Western swing, 50s rock ‘n’ roll, and delta blues — and threw them into a modern, unified, rough-riding context.\n\nHair slicked back, dressed in cowboy black, Ely exuded a barefaced wildness, rampaging over stage, audience and music. Ely’s voice just couldn’t leave a melody line alone. He stuttered it to a climax and hiccupped it for emphasis. When that didn’t work, he yelped or howled. When he unplugged his microphone while charging down the stage hill toward the audience, his screams became silent ecstasy. Meanwhile his band coiled the music into a taut spring, then released the tension with tight but unbridled fury. The crowd went crazy and unexpectedly demanded an encore.\n\nThen, veteran rocker Bonds took the stage, his head arched to the sky, his face grinning wide. When Bruce Springsteen pulled Bonds out of the low-rent, lounge act circuit two years ago, he set Bonds up for stardom… Bonds evoked Springsteen’s name more than once during his 90-minute show. Yet, despite the arrangements’ indelible Springsteen trademarks of wailing sax and New Orleans rhythms, this was definitely a Bonds show, one performed with whole-hearted enthusiasm, sincerity and a voice that sounded just as good as when it first filled the airwaves in 1961...\n\nOne wondered whether George Thorogood and the Destroyers could top the two opening acts. In previous years, Thorogood was a hot, rhythm and blues guitarist who played with all his might, but eventually grew tedious. Just back from opening for the Rolling Stones’ European tour, Thorogood had obviously gained some new expertise. This time, he worked his guitar in tandem with a saxophone player, creating new peaks, valleys and dynamics in his music.\n\nThorogood continued like this for two hours, starting slow and gaining momentum, with only a brief lag of tension in the set.., George Thorogood always wanted to be Chuck Berry. Now he’s learning to be himself.”\n\nSource: Milwaukee Journal. July 6, 1982. Pg. 7.\n\nJoe Cannariato of the Milwaukee Sentinel wrote these words about the Destroyers’ concert at Summerfest in July 1982:\n\n“It couldn’t have been better. Pleasant summer weather combined with superb performances by George Thorogood and the Destroyers, Gary U.S. Bonds and the Joe Ely Band on Summerfest’s Main Stage Monday night.\n\nAbout 18,000 people partied — there’s no other way to describe the fun the spectators were having — to three outstanding acts. It was a night of rock ‘n’ roll the way it should be...\n\nFrom the first note, Thorogood was white-hot. Dressed in a red and white striped sequined tuxedo jacket, blue T-shirt and white pants and shoes for Independence Day, the lightning-fast guitarist hopped, kicked, strutted, danced and Chuck Berry-one-foot-bopped-it for more than two hours of sizzling rock, country and rhythm and blues.\n\nThorogood delighted the crowd by changing the lyrics of every song to include a Milwaukee reference. It was his guitar playing, however, that hypnotized the audience. From country chops to mournful R&B wails to energetic classic rock ‘n’ roll licks, Thorogood made his guitar talk.”\n\nSource: Milwaukee Sentinel. July 6, 1982.

Please send me a note if you know of any.\n\nConcert Reaction:\n\nVictoria McGlothren of the Wisconsin State Journal filed this report about the Destroyers’ October 1982 concert in Madison:\n\n“Thorogood’s dexterous mastery of his cream-colored Gibson guitar thrilled the eyes, but the persistent high volume assaulted the ears, and put a heavy-metal taint on his swinging rock and sultry blues.\n\nA king would have incorporated dynamics – loud and soft, for example – into his art. Playing to a packed house in the 2,200-seat Oscar Mayer Theater, Thorogood declared midway through the concert, “If it ain’t loud, it ain’t rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\n[…]\n\nWith the raucous “One Bourbon, One Shot, One Beer,” Thorogood and Hank (Hurricane) Carter on saxophone demonstrated the theatrics that have made the group popular with concert goers. The pair fought a sort of musical battle with Thorogood playing a lick bringing Carter to his knees, then Carter repeating the strain “pummeling” Thorogood with repetition.\n\nMany music lovers in the theater were clad in costumes, including Thorogood who sported a black t-shirt with a white skeleton screen-printed on it. His face was painted black-and-white to match. Several times throughout the evening, Thorogood yelled, “Man, I love Halloween.” He went on to prove it during one of his two encores by playing “Monster Mash.”\n\nSource: Wisconsin State Journal. Nov. 1, 1982.\n\nReviewer Phil Davis of the Capitol Times had this to say about the Destroyers’ concert in the Oscar Mayer Theater in 1982:\n\n“Not to be outdone by such Halloween celebrants as a pregnant, cigar-chomping nun or a super-strength Tylenol capsule, Thorogood hit the stage in his own costume – a hobgoblin muumuu and deep pile fright wig. His three piece band, the Destroyers – Jeff Simon, drums, Bill Blough, bass, and Hank Carter, saxophone – were similarly attired. And for the next few hours Thorogood demonstrated why as an opener on the last [Rolling] Stones tour it had been necessary to give him an extra half hour of stage time: the crowds can’t seem to get enough of his rollicking, firebrand rock.\n\nAlthough Thorogood works within a limited musical scope […] he’s such an effusive, exuberantly believable personality he can make each number seem distinctly different. Whether duckwalking across the stage, reaching out above the heads of the fans and anointing them with his guitar neck, or simply reveling in the delicious cacophony of his own razor-edged guitar noise, Thorogood always seem to be having the time of his life. And it’s infectious.\n\nSure, there were moments when the blues progressions seemed to blur into one overlong 12 bar boogie-fest. But Bach can get pretty repetitive too. And when Thorogood hit the bone-pulverizing groove of Bo Diddley’s “Who Do You Love,” he struck a mainline of primal feeling and rhythm. It was beautifully unexplainable. Like love. Like life.”\n\nSource: The Capital Times. Nov. 1, 1982. Pg. 36.\n\nOther Notes: None.\n\nFate of the Venue: The Madison Civic Center, including the Oscar Mayer Theatre, underwent a major renovation in 2006.
