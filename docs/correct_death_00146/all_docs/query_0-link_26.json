        "text": "Singer, Songwriter and Guitar Master of the Delta, Talking and Memphis Country Blues, Creator of the Boogie Blues\n\nJohn Lee Hooker was a Blues singer, songwriter and guitarist. Though he lived in Detroit during most of his career, he is not associated with the Chicago-style blues prevalent in the north as much as he is with rural southern styles such as delta blues, country blues, folk blues and front porch blues. The year of John's birth is under debate. He is the youngest of eleven children of William Hooker (1871-1923) and Minnie Ramsey (1875-?). His recording career began in 1948. He recorded under numerous pseudonyms such as Johnny Lee, John Lee, John Lee Cooker, Texas Slim, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and his Magic Guitar, Johnny Williams and The Boogie Man.\n\nJohn rarely played a standard beat, making it difficult to use backing musicians. He recorded and toured with Eddie Kirkland. He also recorded with Eddie Taylor. John appeared in the 1980 movie \"The Blues Brothers\". He recorded over 100 records.\n\nAwards and Recognition: John Lee Hooker has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, has won several Grammy Awards, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. Two of his songs, \"Boogie Chillen\" and \"Boom Boom\" were named on the list of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. \"Boogie Chillen\" was included as one of the Songs of the Century.\n\nSources\n\nWikipedia\n\nJohn Lee Hooker Biography (2011)\n\nMusician. He was a pioneering and prolific Blues artist who recorded over 100 albums. Songs include \"Boom Boom,\" \"Boogie Chillen',\" and \"Hoogie Boogie.\" He was the inspiration for many rock and blues musicians. Hooker was taught to play the guitar by his stepfather. At the age of 14 he began playing in bars in Memphis, Cincinnati and Detroit. His first hit was \"Boogie Chillin',\" in 1948, of which he has recorded over 30 versions.
