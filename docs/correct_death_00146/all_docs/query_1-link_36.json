        "text": "\"Some come from rich families. Some come from families that don't have money ... Kids are so strong nowadays. They want to get out there with what's happenin'. They think dope is the thing. They get so far gone they get wasted. They got no place to go but back home, but they ain't goin' back there. So they're turnin' to the blues. Some of 'em don't know what the blues are, but that's what it is ... heartaches, misery.\n\n\"It's sad to see beautiful people wasted on drugs. They get so far gone. They wanta turn back but they can't turn back. They can't support their habits and they sell the clothes off their back--even sell the clothes off your back, but still they don't mean to hurt you. But somethin' hurted them and they are tryin' to get the monkey off their back. Once they do that they're quiet for awhile. They may steal from you, then they're sad later. Some people really want to hurt them, but they are good people.\n\n\"I got to these meetings, these halfway houses, and talks to 'em. Intelligent they are, and very sensitive. But they at a stage where they can't help themselves. They're not bad people, not by a long shot. It really is sad 'cause they wish they could change things. I try to find time to play for those people, like benefits. You know?\n\n\"I was just old fashioned. When I was comin' up there never was such a thing as all this stuff ... this drugs. I had never seen none. I just seen heroin here about two years ago--I didn't even know what it looked like. I didn't even know what cocaine looked like. I never smoked pot. I never used no kind of drugs.\n\n\"I tried pot once but it didn't do nothin' for me. I used to drink, but I don't use hard liquor. Not any more. But I never did go overboard. I always could handle it in my music. I'd never get to the place where I couldn't play, couldn't stand up. I used to get pretty stoned, but I could always do my work.\"\n\nHooker moved to the West Coast in the early '70s. After eight years in Oakland, he moved to the Morgan Hill/ Gilroy area for about five years. These days Hooker resides in upwardly mobile Redwood Shores in a tract home close to the bay and the salt air.\n\nHe says he enjoys playing the smaller clubs. \"I'd rather play them than play those big ol' sophisticated clubs ... people 'preciate it more. I can get out 'n' walk around and hang out with my audience--stand there and have a beer with them. I've played them all, a lot of big clubs, but I get more feeling out of the little ones.\n\n\"When I played Carnegie Hall--that's a big, big name--I didn't feel nothin'. It's like punchin' a time clock. They fined me $800 for going over one minute--they're strictly money and business over there in New York. It's prestige. But it's ridiculous.\n\n\"The little clubs, if you feel good, you just go for it. The people are jumpin' up and down. They screamin' and hollerin'. They boogieing. That makes you play better. But, if they're sitting there lookin' at you like a statue, you get pretty nervous. 'Hey,' you ask yourself, 'what am I doing wrong? Don't they feel? Ain't I doin' nothin'?' You get a big round of applause but when you go to playin', they're just sitting there looking at you.\n\n\"But in them funky clubs--some small, some packed with 2,000 people, folks all dressed in jeans ... places with old beat-up walls and bathrooms--it's funky, but it's good. It's real good.\"\n\nHooker has delighted in pushing the careers of young talent. He remembers when Bob Dylan was \"just another person from the streets.\"\n\n\"I was the first person to put him on the bandstand--when I was playin' at Goody's Folk City in the Village back aroun' '65 or '66. He came there ... When I heard him I knew he had a lot of potential. My manager, Al Grossman, heard him and dragged him up and he never looked back. I always go see him when he's around. I'm glad to see him doin' so well again.\n\n\"There are a lot of great artists and blues people I've played with, but I would say that Stevie Wonder is somebody I'd like to work with. I know'd him from a little kid, 9 or 10 years old. I watched him grow up. He used to come on my street and play at a house of a friend of ours called Dempsey, Daniel and MacDaniel on Jamison Street in Detroit.\n\n\"It would be a pleasure just to be on his show. I see him every once in a while just to sit down and talk to him about his kid days. I run into him at the Circle Star--he called me up on stage. He said, 'Let's call up the master--the creator.'\n\n\"That made me feel good, too. No matter how long you been doin' this, nice things make you feel good when they're said about you.\"\n\nOn Hooker's recent tour he visited Florida--Miami, Jacksonville, Daytona Beach, Key West--and New Orleans. \"I played at a real famous ol' place that Professor Longhair used to work called Thibideaux's. You've probably heard of Professor Longhair? They may call me King of the Boogie, but he started a lot of this stuff.\"\n\nJust as the late pianist Professor Longhair 'invented' the romping boogie-woogie left hand, when Hooker leans forward in his straight-back chair and tantalizes his audience with a barrage of guitar chokes and hammerings, one could easily believe he discovered the blues guitar.\n\nHooker is proud of his backup band. \"Don't forget to mention my musicians,\" he says. \"The young musicians that play with me--the oldest one is the organist Deacon Jones. He's 42. It's a real, real good band with Michael Osborne on lead guitar, Tim Richards on drums, Kenny Baker on tenor sax and Larry Hamilton on bass.\n\n\"At 70, I'm not thinkin' about retirin' just yet. I may have to get on a cane or get on my knees and play. But as long as I'm able, I'm gonna do it. It keeps me kinda warm. I don't do it as much as I used to. I call my own shots. I tell my manager whenever I feel like goin' out. I let him know three or four weeks in advance and they start bookin'. They realize I'm not a spring chicken anymore.\n\n\"I've been thinkin' very, very strong about just producin' and then kick back and do something on my own once in a while.\n\n\"Ooooh, there are so many good blues artists out there now and they are serious. So many tryin' to do it. There are so many different groups that are so good. I'd like to give 'em a push. I'm goin' out and listenin' to more of them these days.\n\nThe phone rings; it's Hooker's daughter, who needs a ride home from the fast-food restaurant where she works. (He counts seven children. \"Then I got some laying around that I don't know about,\" he adds with a laugh.)\n\nThere's time for one more question, about the origins of the blues. With a warm smile, the patriarch responds with a brief litany.\n\n\"Well, you're diggin' deep now. Where's the real roots? The real roots is ever since the world was born. The real roots of the blues was here when the world was born.\n\n\"The roots was here when they made man and they made women. The trouble started. The heartache started. Now how long ago that been, I don' know. But now that's the real roots. When I got here they was here and when I leave here they gonna be here.\"\n\nWith that, he pulls on one of his many hats, jumps into the Supra with custom plates that say LES BOGY, and, with a twist of the wrist, backs out of the driveway. He slides the transmission into gear, and his tail lights disappear down the subdivision street. There's bound to be a stop sign ahead, but the Boogie Man won't slow down before he has to.\n\nRemember John Lee Hooker: On Sunday (July 8), JJ's Blues presents a barbecue and blues day for friends and musicians to celebrate the great bluesman's life and music. The event takes place at JJ's, 3439 Stevens Creek Blvd., San Jose. (831.243.6441)\n\n[ San Jose | Metroactive Central | Archives ]"
