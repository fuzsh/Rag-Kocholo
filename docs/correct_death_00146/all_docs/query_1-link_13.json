        "text": "In all the long history of the blues, there has been no figure more singular than John Lee Hooker, who has died in his sleep aged 83. Where other singers rhymed, he sang in blank verse; where other guitarists might skip through the changes, he would play entire songs on one or two chords; and where other blues veterans were fortunate to be rediscovered once, he bounced repeatedly from obscurity or semi-retirement back into the limelight.\n\nFor most African-American musicians of Hooker's generation, to title an album Mr Lucky would be to exercise at least a little irony, but he did enjoy more strokes of good fortune than usually come a bluesman's way. That he could draw about him, even in old age, a crowd of admiring fellow musicians and would-be collaborators was largely due to the hypnotic effect of his music, to the mantra-like chanting over the relentlessly repetitive beat of guitar and foot, which seemed to absorb listeners and accompanists alike into a huge heartbeat.\n\nThose qualities were evident in his first hit, Boogie Chillen (1948), an apparently impromptu synthesis of spoken narrative and sung verses with abrupt gear-changes on the guitar. Such structural wilfulness was not uncommon among the blues musicians of the 1920s and 30s but, for much of his life, Hooker was exceptional - \"the last,\" Ry Cooder called him, \"of those unstructured, free players.\" Cooder, together with Van Morrison, Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt and other musicians, helped Hooker assert his primacy among the senior bluesmen of the late 1980s and 90s.\n\nWhen he started his recording career, some 40 years earlier, he was on his own, though so popular did he become after the success of Boogie Chillen that he briefly turned into a multiple personality, recording for half a dozen labels under as many pseudonyms: Texas Slim, Delta John, Johnny Williams, Birmingham Sam & His Magic Guitar. \"At that time,\" he would recall, \"I began to believe in myself. I knew, then, I was in a field of my own.\"\n\nHooker was based in Detroit, where he had moved in 1943, working during the day as a janitor at Dodge Motors or Comco Steel, and, at night, playing in the black clubs around Hastings Street. Never much given to reminiscence, he managed to preserve a good deal of vagueness about his early life, whether in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where he was born into a family of 11 children, or in Memphis and Cincinnati, where he spent periods in his teens.\n\nIn Clarksdale, his stepfather taught him some things on guitar, including the open-G tuning he would employ to such resonant effect, and what would become one of his favourite songs, When My First Wife Quit Me. He also listened attentively to the obscure Mississippi bluesman Tony Hollins, from whom he derived one of his early successes, Crawling King Snake, though most of his highly personal conception of blues-singing and playing appears to have come from within him.\n\nI'm In The Mood, a characteristically skewed reconstruction of the pop song I'm In The Mood For Love, gave Hooker another hit in 1951, but the day of the solo bluesman was passing, and when he signed with a new label, the Chicago-based Vee Jay Records, in 1955, he began to work with small backing groups. The other musicians flattened his more baroque rhythmic contours and some of the hectic excitement was lost, but the success of Dimples (1956) proved the change of setting to have been a commercially astute move.\n\nWhile maintaining his name in the ghetto record stores, he also, exceptionally, developed a parallel career as a folk-blues artist, playing without amplification and recalling songs from an earlier, more rural era of the blues. \"I have created about three fields,\" he would say proudly. \"A folk field, a blues field, and a jump field for the kids. If it was necessary, I could do hillbilly stuff.\"\n\nSuch dexterity enabled Hooker, in the early 1960s, both to perform at the Newport folk festival and to have a hit in the rhythm 'n' blues chart with Boom Boom, which even entered the British Top 20 in 1964 and made possible a succession of British tours. He had first visited Europe with the first of the American folk-blues festival troupes in 1962.\n\nBy the late 60s, the folk-blues bubble had burst, and both the music business and its market had other preoccupations. Hooker, whose audiences were now almost entirely white, responded with songs about the Vietnam war and miniskirts. In the 1970s, he became a blues magnet, attracting collaborators such as the American band Canned Heat and his longtime admirer Van Morrison, who joined him in stream-of-consciousness raps like Never Get Out Of These Blues Alive.\n\nBy the end of the decade, however, Hooker seemed to have wearied of touring and recording, and when the near-silence prolonged itself through the 1980s, most blues enthusiasts assumed he had vanished into retirement.\n\nIt was another admirer half his age, the guitarist Roy Rogers, who, with Hooker's manager Mike Kappus, discovered the formula to reactivate the sleeping giant, pairing him with artists as different from him, and each other, as the young bluesman Robert Cray, the Hispanic rock band Los Lobos, and the bluesy singer Bonnie Raitt, who remade I'm In The Mood with him as a steamily erotic duet. The result, The Healer (1989), became the bestselling album in blues history, to be followed by Mr Lucky (1991), which repeated the twinning format with Cooder, Morrison and Keith Richards.\n\nIf there was less of Hooker's self-willed guitar to be heard, the years seemed to have added potency to his other resource, the dark, sombre instrument of his voice - \"That deep, well-like sound,\" Cooder called it, while for Raitt it was \"one of the saddest things I've ever heard.\"\n\nBy now as nearly a household name as a blues artist is ever permitted to be, Hooker was sought by film-makers to add an indigo shade to their soundtracks, and by advertisers to fix his stamp upon brands such as ICI, Martell brandy, Foster's lager and, of course, Lee jeans. He even exploited himself, opening a music club in San Francisco, the Boom Boom Room.\n\nEnjoying his prosperity, Hooker now worked only when he chose, but when he did sit down on a stage with his guitar, he wove much of his old spell. Though he had been lauded in the 1970s as a matchless exponent of the boogie beat - one of the most successful of his scores of albums was titled Endless Boogie - he cared more about telling a story.\n\n\"Every song I sing,\" he said, \"is something that happened to my life or somebody else's life in this world. You might lose your money or your car, or can't pay the rent - every person has had these heartaches and tribulations. That's why everybody digs the blues. When I sing these songs, I feel them down deep and reach you down deep\".\n\nHooker is survived by his fourth wife, Millie, and by six children from his previous marriages, including musicians Zakiya and Robert.\n\nJohn Lee Hooker, blues musician, born August 22 1917; died June 21 2001\n\nUseful links\n\nVirgin: John Lee Hooker\n\nRosebud Agency: John Lee Hooker\n\nWorld's Greatest Blues Singer: John Lee Hooker\n\nBoom Boom Room\n\nBlue Flame Cafe: John Lee Hooker\n\nHarry's Blues Lyrics Online: John Lee Hooker\n\nSound clips\n\nBoom Boom (from SonicNet)\n\nClips from John Lee Hooker: The Ultimate Collection 1948-1990 (from Amazon)"
