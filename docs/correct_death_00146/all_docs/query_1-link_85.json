        "text": "Detroit’s dean of the blues is set to be honored with a special summer tribute, including a posthumous key to the city.\n\nThe late bluesman John Lee Hooker will be celebrated by local and visiting performers at the latest edition of Detroit Music Weekend, scheduled July 2 outside Music Hall.\n\nThe free festival will feature a daylong lineup of artists performing in celebration of the influential singer-guitarist, including Michigan mainstay Bettye LaVette, Detroit blues queen Thornetta Davis and Serbian-born star Ana Popovic. Detroit’s Jimmy D. Scott will close the evening with an all-star jam that includes Kern Brantley, Howard Glazer and Harmonica Shah. Tosha Owens and Eliza Neals also fill the bill.\n\nFor fest organizer Vince Paul, president of Music Hall, the real coup is the booking of Zakiya Hooker, the 74-year-old daughter of the late musician and a veteran blues artist in her own right. She’ll perform with a band that includes her husband, Ollan Christopher Bell (of the ‘70s soul group the Natural Four) and Canadian guitarist Anthony Reed.\n\nThe Detroit native, who left the city for California in the mid-‘70s and now lives in Georgia, said she’s thrilled to come home for a tribute to her father in the city where he made his name.\n\n“When I got the word from Vince, the first thing I said is that it’s way overdue,” Hooker said. “Detroit is where (John Lee Hooker) became famous. It’s where ‘Boogie Chillen’ put him on the map. I was really touched that they’ve taken the time to pull this together.”\n\nZakiya Hooker will accept a key to the city in honor of her father, who died in June 2001, presented by the office of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. She said much of the Hooker family is expected to attend, including some of the late star’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nDetroit Music Weekend’s John Lee Hooker tribute will be staged at Music Hall’s new amphitheater space, built last year on the venue’s former parking lot at Madison Street and Grand River Avenue. Initially devised as a workaround amid pandemic limitations on indoor gatherings, the outdoor performance area is likely to endure as a permanent fixture outside Music Hall.\n\nThe July festivities will happen just down the road from the onetime Hastings Street district where Hooker plied his musical trade. Having migrated to Detroit in the early 1940s, drawn by a job with Ford, the Mississippi-bred bluesman became a staple of the city’s Black clubs while making a crucial transition to electric guitar.\n\nWith his signature foot-pounding beat and a sound that melded downhome Delta blues with urban urgency, Hooker became a hot Detroit draw. Recording for assorted labels — sometimes under aliases to sidestep existing record contracts — he began to pile up hits, with his groundbreaking 1948 single “Boogie Chillen” leading a catalog that grew to include “Crawling King Snake,” “I’m in the Mood,” “Boom Boom,” “Dimples” and more.\n\n“I always call him the triple threat — great writer, great singer, great guitarist,” said Paul. “That’s an unusual mix. His voice was priceless. There’s something with many of our great stars, where their voice resonates inside our bodies. And his is one of them. It somehow broke through your forehead and got inside of you.”\n\nBy the time of his late-career resurgence in the 1990s, when he became the toast of the rock community, Hooker cut one of the most distinctive figures in the blues world, his sharkskin suits, fedoras and wraparound shades making for an unmistakable look.\n\n“John Lee Hooker was far and away Detroit’s king of cool,” said Paul.\n\nDetroit Music Weekend was launched by Music Hall in 2017, conceived as a way to honor the city’s greats with performances and other civic bells and whistles. The inaugural edition featured what turned out to be Aretha Franklin’s final hometown performance — a two-day Queen of Soul celebration that included a ceremonial renaming of Madison Street (Aretha Franklin Way) and a key to the city presented to Franklin by Duggan.\n\nThe 2018 DMW was headlined by the Jacksons, who performed and received a key to the city. After skipping 2019, the fest returned in summer 2020 with a scaled-down, socially distanced program of local acts, becoming the city’s first significant music event after the onset of the pandemic.\n\nPaul said he opted to devote this year’s event to Hooker after learning earlier this year that the long-running Ann Arbor Blues Festival would be on hiatus.\n\n“Suddenly there was a gap in the programming,” he said. “Why isn’t anyone doing a blues festival in Detroit? Then it just domino’d.”\n\nHis first call was to local blues powerhouse Davis (“a no-brainer,” he said), followed by LaVette. Both had prior commitments on July 9, Paul’s targeted fest date. So he moved the event up a week.\n\nNext came Popovic, Owens and Neals — and suddenly, Paul found himself with a “women of the blues” theme.\n\n“And then I figured I’d throw in a few guys,” he said.\n\nScott and company will close the outdoor event with a sprawling band featuring a horn section and battery of 20-plus musicians led by Brantley, the well-traveled bassist-keyboardist known for his touring work with Lady Gaga and others.\n\nBrantley is also helping select six young musicians who will perform as part of a juried showcase that day at Aretha’s Jazz Café inside Music Hall. Finalists will be announced ahead of the festival.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.\n\nDetroit Music Weekend: Honoring John Lee Hooker\n\nWith Thornetta Davis, Bettye LaVette, Ana Popovic, Jimmy D. Scott and others\n\nNoon-10 p.m. July 2\n\nFree."
