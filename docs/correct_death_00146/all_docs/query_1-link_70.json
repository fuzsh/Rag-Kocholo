        "text": "Bluesman John Lee Hooker, whose foot stompin' and gravelly voice on songs like Boom Boom and Boogie Chillen electrified audiences and inspired generations of musicians, died Thursday (June 21, 2001). He was 83.\n\nMr. Hooker died of natural causes as he slept at his home in Los Altos, south of San Francisco, said agent Mike Kappus and manager Rick Bates.\n\nThe veteran blues singer from the Mississippi Delta estimated he recorded more than 100 albums over nearly seven decades. He won a Grammy for a version of I'm In The Mood, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award at last year's Grammys.\n\nThrough it all, Mr. Hooker's music remained hypnotic and unchanged _ his rich and sonorous voice, full of ancient hurt, coupled with a brooding, rhythmic guitar. He sang of loneliness and confusion. His music was raw, primal emotion.\n\n\"He just kept going. . . . He wanted to keep working,\" said John Wooler, senior vice president at Virgin Records America and president of Point Blank Records, Mr. Hooker's label. \"He was planning to do a new record, but he hadn't started.\"\n\nHis distinctive sound influenced rock 'n' rollers as well as rhythm and blues musicians.\n\nAmong those whose music drew heavily on Mr. Hooker's style are Van Morrison, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt and ZZ Top. In 1961, the then-unknown Rolling Stones opened for him on a European tour; he also shared a bill that year with Bob Dylan at a club in New York.\n\nEven in the '90s, when his fame was sealed and he was widely recognized as one of the grandfathers of pop music, Mr. Hooker remained a little in awe of his success, telling the Times of London, \"People say I'm a genius, but I don't know about that.\"\n\nLike many postwar bluesmen, Mr. Hooker got cheated by one fly-by-night record producer after another, who demanded exclusivity or didn't pay. He fought back by recording with rival producers under different names: Texas Slim, John Lee Booker, John Lee Cocker, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and the Boogie Man, among others.\n\nHis popularity grew as he rode the wave of rock in the '50s into the folk boom of the '60s. In 1980, he played a street musician in The Blues Brothers movie. In 1985, his songs were used in Steven Spielberg's film The Color Purple.\n\nHe hit it big again in 1990 with his album The Healer, featuring duets with Carlos Santana, Raitt and Robert Cray. It sold 1.5-million copies and won him his first Grammy, for I'm in the Mood.\n\nWooler got to know Mr. Hooker over the past decade through the album label and said the blues master was a \"very humble, sweet man, always in good spirits.\"\n\nBorn in Clarksdale, Miss., in 1917, Mr. Hooker was one of 11 children born to a Baptist minister and sharecropper who discouraged his son's musical bent.\n\nHis stepfather taught him to play guitar. By the time he was a teenager, he was performing at local fish fries, dances and other occasions.\n\nHe hit the road to perform by the age of 14. He worked odd jobs by day and played small bars at night in Memphis, Tenn., then Cincinnati and finally Detroit in 1943.\n\nIn Detroit, he was discovered and recorded his first hit, Boogie Chillen, in 1948.\n\n\"I don't know what a genius is,\" he told the London newspaper. \"I know there ain't no one ever sound like me, except maybe my stepfather. You hear all the kids trying to play like B.B. (King), and they ain't going to because, ooh, he's such a fine player and a very great man. But you never hear them even try and sound like John Lee Hooker.\"\n\n\"All these years, I ain't done nothin' different,\" he added. \"I been doing the same things as in my younger days, when I was coming up, and now here I am, an old man, up there in the charts. And I say, well, what happened? Have they just thought up the real John Lee Hooker, is that it? And I think, well, I won't tell nobody else! I can't help but wonder what happened.\""
