        "text": "John Lee Hooker is hardly the first name that comes to mind when thinking of country blues. Though he was Mississippi born and bred, even his earliest work is strikingly different from the early Delta blues tradition of legends like Charley Patton or Robert Johnson. From the start, his was an individual, urban voice and manner, but that’s not to say that his music necessarily feels less archaic than the acoustic blues of the pre-war period. Despite Hooker’s preference for electric guitar, a band format and his contemporary lyrical ideas, there was a whole mysterious and melancholy lost world of ancient music in his droning delivery that seems to have in it echoes not just of the ‘20s, but of the traditional chants of the Gurunsi people of Ghana and Burkina Faso.\n\nBe that as it may, by the end of the 1950s, with a decade of recordings under his belt, Hooker found himself recording various projects that looked back beyond his contemporary work and into the past of his youth and childhood. Partly this was due to the resurgence of interest in the blues that led to the rediscovery of Johnson and his peers and successors — and established the idea of Delta blues as a genre in itself — but it was also a commercial matter, with Hooker and his labels courting the newly burgeoning folk scene of the late ‘50s and early ‘60s. The folk aspect of his work is exemplified by the records he made for the Vee-Jay label like Travelin’ and The Folk Lore of John Lee Hooker. These albums capture Hooker’s idiosyncratic manner at its most stark, accompanied by bass and drums, and they are among the finest and most atmospheric albums of his career. The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker is something else again.\n\nWhen, at the end of the 1950s, the now middle-aged bluesman found himself in New York City at the studios of the authentic trad-jazz oriented Riverside Records, he was given a very specific assignment. The key word for Riverside was authenticity — and ironically, to that end, they had Hooker play in a manner that was essentially alien to his work. The result was The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker, an anomaly in Hooker’s career, but a fine and unusual record nonetheless. A solo, acoustic record, it’s an album in which Hooker offers his interpretations of material that was mostly made famous by figures who were by then already semi-legendary; Blind Lemon Jefferson, dead since 1929, Patton, who had died in ’34 when Hooker was starting to learn guitar, Sonny Boy Williamson I, who departed the earth in ’48, the same year that Hooker first entered a recording studio.\n\nThere’s something slightly perverse about getting a musician from Mississippi to record the blues of artists from Texas and Tennessee in the name of authenticity, and it’s tempting to say that this music comes from a different tradition to Hooker’s — but that’s only partly true. “Black Snake” is a typical example. It’s generally credited — as “Black Snake Moan” — to Texan blues legend Jefferson, but the version Hooker sings is far closer to the sinister “Black Snake Blues” by another Texan singer, Victoria Spivey, with its refrain “Some black snake been sucking my rider’s tongue.” But in place of the piano accompaniment of Spivey’s version and, quite unlike the nimble guitar of Jefferson’s, Hooker’s menacing strum and harsh picking comes straight from the Delta tradition, and his brooding vocal sounds like nobody else. Similarly, he transforms the lilting, lightly weary Leroy Carr song “How Long Blues” with its laidback piano into something more primal and monotonous. Again, it’s a telling transformation; Carr was nothing if not a pioneer of modern, urban music and his “How Long” is a blues for the 1920s, rather than some traditional, mournful dirge, but Hooker manages to suggest roots far deeper and darker than are audible in Carr and Scrapper Blackwell’s charming original.\n\nAs if to underline that for the artist himself, The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker was first and foremost a stylistic exercise, Hooker recorded an acoustic version of his own 1955 single “Wobblin’ Baby” in the manner of the older material on the album. It’s not entirely successful, lacking the feral drive and rhythm —not to mention the distortion — of the original, but he recreates some of its tension by use of barely-in-tune guitar and it has a vocal of more subtlety, and with more of an echo of the Delta tradition, than the bulldozer approach of the original allows.\n\n“Tupelo Blues,” a song with its genesis in the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, makes for an instructive comparison, because a haunting version of it, recorded live around the same time as this one, appears on The Folk Lore of John Lee Hooker album. Hooker’s guitar on that version is acoustic too, but accompanied by a bass player and drummer, Hooker becomes a showman, and his delivery of the lyrics is masterful and dramatic. In the studio, with just his guitar and the tapping of his foot to keep time, Hooker delivers instead a skeletally beautiful, solemn and hushed version of the song, his tone almost conversational and amazingly venerable for a man then only in his forties. Neither version of the song is obviously superior; in the live one the ghosts of Tupelo seem to walk, in the studio version the presence of bad memories suppressed but never really gone feels almost palpable.\n\nPatton was already playing a version of his railroad classic “Pea Vine Blues” when the Mississippi flooded in 1927 and compared to the timeless desolation of his 1929 recording, Hooker’s “Pea Vine Special” feels almost sprightly. Compared to Patton’s opaque vocal, Hooker’s diction is uncharacteristically impeccable, but he does imitate Patton’s long keening tones perfectly. It’s a nice performance, but definitely an extrovert re-casting of the gnomic Delta blues for the ‘60s, rather than a dive into those dark and impenetrable waters. Hooker sounds far more at home with a laconic version of Williamson I’s “Good Morning, Li’l School Girl,” itself a precursor of the kind of urban, hustler’s blues that he made his own in the ‘50s and ‘60s. Typically, Williamson’s jaunty, knowingly winning charm becomes something a little slier and more predatory in Hooker’s version.\n\nThe album ends with “Behind the Plow,” an apparently autobiographical song about Hooker’s origins in Mississippi which draws on various old folk and blues songs to give a precise but probably misleading picture of the singer’s early days working in the fields, which is atmospheric and likable and more to the point, was probably the exact kind of thing that the Riverside label was looking for at the time. As the album fades out, John Lee Hooker, a man whose career would be defined by urban, woman-chasing, bragging boogie-blues music, is mumbling about his old grey mule; it’s a strange album really.\n\nNow 60-plus years later, The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker feels both authentic and ersatz — an evocation of an era and idiom by a man who had been there and who knew exactly what it was, but whose own calling had taken him in a different direction. Within just a few years, Hooker would be internationally feted and a host of young, mostly white musicians would be taking the kind of blues he really liked into the mainstream and the Top 40 singles chart, but this album remains a fascinating glimpse of another path he could easily have taken."
