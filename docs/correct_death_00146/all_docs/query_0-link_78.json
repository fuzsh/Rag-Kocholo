        "meta_description": "Chill Out by John Lee Hooker John Lee Hooker (c. August 22, 1912 – June 21, 2001) was an American blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of Delta blues. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including talking blues and early North Mississippi Hill country blues. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct…",

        "text": "JLH:Well the first person that really helped me, which don’t get any credit, but the best one gets all the credit but he shouldn’t get it. A guy in Detroit called Elmer Barber, 609 East Lafayette Street in Detroit. He’s the one that discovered me. He had a little old record shop there, down Lafayette and Senewa in Detroit. But anyway, I used to go to his shop at night. At day, every night I had a little job working, you know. And he had this little record shop. He would record records and stuff, blanks downstairs. They didn’t have tapes. They had these blanks, you know.\n\nAnd I would go down, he’d take me there. He heard me, said, Oh kid, you got a voice. And he would take me there and record me and we sit down there, would eat and drink wine till about two or three o’clock in the morning. But every night, and I would sleep during the day whenever I wasn’t working, something like that. And sometime I had to work, too. And he is the one that really discovered me.\n\nThen he brought me to Bunny Bessman on Woodward Avenue. They had a big, big record store, they did. Kind of like Tower Records, you know? And he had a little label called Sensation label. I walked in there, he came in there and they heard me, you know. They said, Oh kid. Said hey brother, where you find him and brought me. Oh, this is my talent. And he turned me over to Bunny.\n\nAnd, and all these songs that I wrote, he had this little label put on his label, Sensation label, and he would tell people that he wrote the song, but you know, he never wrote a song. And he, you look on all of his, the records, you may see his name on a lot of them. I, you know, we won’t go there. But he did not discover me, but he made the way for me after Barber, Barber, you know, got me going. He’s the one that got me on Modern Record, the big label. Made me known after he got, after Barber, turned him over to me after Barber discovered me and turned me over to him. So he’s the one put the hype to me, to the big labels and like Modern Records and stuff like that. His label couldn’t handle Boogie Chillen. You might, you may, you heard of Boogie Chillen. It was a big one.\n\nSo I recorded it on Sensation label. And he released me out to Modern Records. But he had a small label and Modern had this big, big label. So that’s, then he, he claimed he wrote that, he didn’t. But he, that’s how I started out working for little plants in Detroit, little bars and going to what I grew up with, and loved so much which I do now.\n\nI raised my family in Detroit and when I first come to Detroit I wasn’t married, come at a very young age. Then got married then, all my children was born in Detroit, grew up there. And I see the hard times and the good times that all are right there, and I come up the hard way. And I know what the hard way is. I know what it’s like to scuffle, coming through the hard times and getting into the big times and a big star. I know how to cope with it and I know what it’s like being, coming up in it the hard way. And I don’t forget that. And I don’t leave it behind. That’s always in the back of my mind, what you have to come through, most of them. It wasn’t handed to me on a silver platter. I got it through the hard times.\n\nNow I have learned to appreciate that and to live with that. I won’t forget my roots, I don’t care who tried to get me to leave my roots behind and go be a superstar which they say I am, I don’t know. Or that’s fine, but I’m not going to leave that behind. I’m going to always stick to my roots, which I love the blues so much. Every day, every night when I lay down in my bed, I’m, I’m sometime I’ll be humming it in my sleep, tune that comes to me and people who I love.\n\nI reach out and get people and I let them, just take them in and just, I give away so much to the people, I mean money-wise here, trying to help, you know, which are the poor people that who really needs it. You look at the people in the streets, sleeping in the streets, hard time. I wonder why these people have to do that. There were more people like me, we could get out and reach out there and get those people, I don’t think it would be, it would be a better world.\n\nBut I can’t save the world, but I can, I say I can be John Lee Hooker, not forget about the people, the poor people and the people that go out there and buy my records that work five days a week they work in the plants and the fields from buying John Lee Hooker’s records. And they is part of me, just as much as me. Wasn’t for them I wouldn’t be here. And that’s the reason I love people to death. Ain’t nobody going to change me from not doing that."
