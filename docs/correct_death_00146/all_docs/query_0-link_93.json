        "text": "Twenty-five years ago,\n\n, which didn't yet have that name, needed a star -- a big star -- as its first headliner.\n\nDelmark Goldfarb, organizer of what was then called the Rose City Blues Festival, called John Mazzocco for help.\n\nMazzocco, a longtime Portland bass player, had spent the previous year with\n\n's band. He had recently returned home to join local blues great Curtis Salgado and his band, the Stilettos.\n\nMazzocco had actually lived with Hooker in San Carlos, Calif., when playing in his band. The Portland native quickly put Goldfarb in touch with Hooker's management.\n\nHooker eventually agreed to come to Portland, but insisted he'd only play if he were met at the airport with a white limousine -- \"my limbo\" in Hook-speak.\n\nIt was a go after a call to Hooker's manager (who also handled Robert Cray) and the sum of $2,000 was agreed to. The first formal blues fest in Portland had its headliner. (Goldfarb confirms that someone picked Hooker up at PDX, though the make and model of the car has been lost to memory.)\n\nThe 25th anniversary of anything significant requires reflection, I guess. The event Hooker headlined was the first in a long line of what is now called the Safeway Waterfront Blues Festival -- the largest blues festival on the West Coast and the second-largest blues festival in the United States.\n\n[\n\n]\n\nLooking back, Goldfarb recalls stopping for gas on the way to the airport after the first blues festival (where Salgado and the Stilettos had served as Hooker's backing band).\n\nWhen the gas cap was replaced and the engine started, Hooker said, \"Let's boogie.\" Kinda funny when you think about it: He's the guy who invented boogie.\n\nJohn Lee Hooker died in Los Altos, Calif., on June 21, 2001.\n\nAs a photographer with The Oregonian for more than 30 years, I've photographed nearly every blues fest and nearly every story associated with it: the food, the weather, the workshops, the guitars, the faces in the crowd, the fireworks.\n\nOn the festival's silver anniversary, the following images are my tribute to Hooker and the other wonderful musicians -- artists now gone -- who made the festival one of Portland's most popular summer events."
