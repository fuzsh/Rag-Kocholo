John Lee Hooker (August 22, 1912 or 1917 – June 21, 2001) was an American blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of Delta blues. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including talking blues and early North Mississippi Hill country blues. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s–1940s piano-derived boogie-woogie. Hooker was ranked 35 in Rolling Stone‘s 2015 list of 100 greatest guitarists.[

The 1990s saw additional collaboration albums: Mr. Lucky (1991), Chill Out (1995), and Don’t Look Back (1997) with Morrison, Santana, Los Lobos, and additional guest musicians. His re-recording of “Boom Boom” (the title track for his 1992 album) with guitarist Jimmie Vaughan became Hooker’s highest charting single (number 16) in the UK. Come See About Me, includes performances filmed between 1960 and 1994 and interviews with several of the musicians.

Hooker owned five houses in his later life, including houses located in Los Altos, California; Redwood City, California, Long Beach, California, and Gilroy, California.

Hooker died in his sleep on June 21, 2001, in Los Altos, California in his home.
