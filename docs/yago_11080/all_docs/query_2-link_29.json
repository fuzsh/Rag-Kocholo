        "text": "The Human Dutch, the documentary that lends its title to this series, offers a funny and compassionate look at the Dutch and their national characteristics and foibles. The black comedy The Northerners presents a more satricial, and even surrealistic, view of the inhabitants of one town.\n\nSecond feature start time: 8:35 pm. Part city symphony, part ethnographic essay, The Human Dutch is an award-winning documentary that reveals what is unique about a country where \"even the monuments are small and cozy.\" (Bert Haanstra, 1963; 85 mins.)\n\nLongtime theater director Alex van Warmerdam brings a surrealist tone to The Northerners, a deadpan social satire focusing on the eccentric inhabitants of an unfinished Dutch subdivision circa 1960. (Alex van Warmerdam, 1992; 105 mins.)\n\nThe Human Dutch was conceived by the UCLA Film and Television Archive and the Nederlands Filmmuseum in association with the Consulate General of the Netherlands, Los Angeles. The program is presented with the support of the Dutch Cultural Fund.\n\nsupport credits\n\nSeason support provided by the Rohauer Collection Foundation and the Corporate Annual Fund of the Wexner Center Foundation.\n\nContemporary films, international films, and visiting filmmakers presented with support from the Ohio Arts Council."
