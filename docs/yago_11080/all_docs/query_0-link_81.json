        "text": "Earth\n\nA rather overextended and dull 1996 tale about a Spanish soil fumigator, his work at a vineyard, and his relationship to two women. Julio Medem directed.\n\nJustice Denied\n\nA Canadian documentary by Paul Cowan about the murder of a black teenager in a small town in Nova Scotia 20 years ago and the unjust sentencing of a Micmac Indian for the crime. On the same program, three Canadian shorts: Ikwe, Places Not Our Own, and Hunters & Bombers.\n\nFilms by Suzan Pitt\n\nAmerican independent animator Suzan Pitt will be present to introduce a program of her work, including the Chicago premiere of her remarkable and inventive Joy Street (1995), her midnight classic Asparagus (1978), and two earlier works, Crocus (1971) and Jefferson Circus Songs (1973).\n\nJudex\n\n1916\n\nI’m Not Rappaport\n\nIntent on exposing some crucial issues about aging and quality of life and trying to be funny at the same time, this 1996 endeavor, adapted by director Herb Gardner from the play he wrote, can’t hide its stage origins—or prevent us from concluding that the story must be far more effective onstage than it is […]\n\nAntarctica\n\n0 hour 40 min\n\nGloria\n\n1 hour 50 min\n\nKing Kong\n\nIt’s madness to try to remake a myth, but even so, John Guillermin’s jokey, low-camp film (1976) seems awfully inadequate. Instead of the primal antisocial fantasy of the Schoedsack-Cooper original, Guillermin and his screenwriter, Lorenzo Semple (the man responsible for the 1966 Batman, which should give you some idea) serve up labored puns (an oil […]\n\nWestern\n\nAn interesting, offbeat 1997 French road movie by Manuel Poirier, about a Spanish lady-killer (Sergi Lopez) and a Russian immigrant (Sacha Bourdo) traveling and quarreling their way through Brittany. A rambling but ultimately rather affecting comedy-drama by a talented filmmaker who’s almost completely unknown here, this has a deft feel for lower-middle-class life in rural […]\n\nThe Leopard\n\nNot the Visconti masterpiece but an African-jungle cliff-hanger that sounds like Romancing the Stone in French commercial disguise: a retired secret service agent teams up with a prudish woman editor to solve the mystery of a scientist’s murder and, not incidentally, scratch up some new material for an espionage novel. With Claude Brasseur, Dominique Lavanant, […]\n\nMarch Caresses\n\nA semicomic Polish feature by Radoslaw Piwowarski (1989) about rebellious teenagers partying and playing rock ‘n’ roll at the home of a prominent Jewish family in the late 60s; after Israel’s six-day war the town turns the parties into an excuse to force the Jewish family to emigrate. Presented by the B’nai B’rith Hillel Foundation.\n\nThe Big Parade\n\nThe second feature of People’s Republic of China director Chen Kaige (Yellow Earth) concentrates on the military training of cadets at Peking’s Tiananmen Square in preparation for the huge celebration of the 35th anniversary of the Chinese Revolution in October 1984. Eschewing individual stories and concentrating on process, this film, photographed by Yellow Earth‘s Zhang […]\n\nCape Fear\n\n1 hour 45 min • 1962\n\nTumbleweeds\n\nUnsubtle injections of cinema verite and a plot reminiscent of Martin Scorsese’s Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore propel this southern-white-trash mother-daughter road movie. Four-times-married Mary Jo (Janet McTeer) needs companionship to survive but flees town after town once her luck runs out. By the time she shacks up with a ticking bomb of a truck […]\n\nHome On the Range\n\nA conventionally made documentary by Adam Horowitz with a potent subject—the dispute between the native inhabitants of the Marshall Islands’ Kwajalein atoll and the U.S. Army, which has been using the Kwajalein lagoon as a target for hundreds of test missiles over the past three decades. In 1936 the inhabitants signed a 50-year lease with […]\n\nTa Dona\n\nAdama Drabo’s 1991 Malian feature follows a young forestry-commission employee who leaves his village in search of a plant with mythical healing powers.\n\nEvita\n\nAlan Parker directs Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 1978 musical about Argentina’s national heroine, Evita Peron, with Madonna in the title role—coscripted by Oliver Stone, who previously teamed up with Parker on Midnight Express. With Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, and Jimmy Nail.\n\nSound and Fury\n\nFilmmaker Josh Aronson steps into a hornet’s nest of controversy in this compelling documentary portrait of an extended family’s struggle over whether to get their deaf children cochlear implants. Peter and Nita Artinian, both deaf from birth and strong proponents of deaf culture, are forced to confront the issue when their five-year-old daughter asks for […]\n\nFilms by Richard Myers\n\nThree films by the independent filmmaker, a former faculty member at Kent State University: The Path (1961, 20 min.), Deathstyles (1972, 50 min.), and 37-73 (1973, 54 min.).\n\nMe and My Brother\n\nRobert Frank’s controversial, troubling 1968 feature is provisionally a documentary about Julius Orlovsky, the catatonic brother of Allen Ginsberg’s lover, but it also employs actors to depict both his subject (Joseph Chaikin) and Frank himself (Christopher Walken). Not an easy film to watch, but certainly an interesting one.\n\nSunday\n\nThe beautifully acted story of an impromptu, one-day romance between an unlikely middle-aged couple: a former IBM accountant (David Suchet) living at a Queens homeless shelter for men and a struggling English actress (Lisa Harrow) who mistakes him for a famous film director who once auditioned her. Writer-director Jonathan Nossiter’s tender feature, winner of the […]\n\nBitter Sweet\n\nSonia Valentine directed this 2002 murder mystery set in a Puerto Rican fish factory. 120 min.\n\nHard Times\n\nPG • 1 hour 33 min • 1975\n\nBread and Roses\n\nWho wants to think about Mexican janitors—illegal aliens, working in the buildings where movie stars do business with their agents—who decide to unionize to end their exploitation? Ken Loach, an unreconciled, unreconstructed Marxist, that’s who. And thanks to this stirring piece of agitprop, I do too. Paul Laverty’s screenplay is regrettably reluctant to offer certain […]\n\nU.s. Shorts\n\nFive works to be shown on video: Luis Valdovino’s experimental and ironic look at immigration laws, Work in Progress (1990), and his equally experimental A World of Dance; Rene Perez’s El Senor Ramirez; and two collectively made documentaries, Chill Out and Treat Me Right."
