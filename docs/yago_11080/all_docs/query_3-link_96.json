        "text": "Directed and produced by Bert Haanstra, Glass is the 10-minute short film from the Netherlands which took home the 1959 Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. The film is a study in contrast between the meticulous handmade crystal made in the Royal Leerdam Glass Factory, and the automated glass bottle making machines of the time.\n\nBrent Lambert\n\nWebsite\n\nFacebook\n\nX (Twitter)\n\nWriter, editor, and founder of FEELguide.
