        "text": "The film focuses on the Uruguayan urban left-wing guerrillas, the so-called Tupamaros, and was filmed at the height of their operation and within their members — the filming was clandestine and carried out by various people who didn’t know the real purpose of the film, which shows the history of the struggle and the desperation that led to the guerrillas’ operationalisation."
