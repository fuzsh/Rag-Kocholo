        "text": "Fascinations: Progress\n\n26th Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival\n\nFestival Dates: October 25-30, 2022\n\nhttps://www.ji-hlava.com/programove-sekce/fascinace-pokrok\n\nFilm page: https://www.ji-hlava.com/filmy/a-potom-jsme-pochodovali\n\nFascinations: Progress\n\nThis year, in the ongoing series of retrospectives devoted to the history of avant-garde film through the ways of representation of certain topic or motive, we want to map the representation of “progress”. Something inscribed in the nature of the avant-garde itself, the topic was also widely represented – typically with enthusiasm and admiration, but sometimes also critically. We are interested in films from the beginning of cinema until today. The works from the beginning of cinema and between-the-war period. The “classical” works and “big” names, but also not so well-known films and authors.\n\nFilm Database\n\nAbstract Experiment in Kodachrome\n\ndirector: Slavko Vorkapich\n\noriginal title: Abstract Experiment in Kodachrome\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1950\n\nrunning time: 2 min.\n\nAdmiral Cigarette\n\ndirector: William Heise\n\noriginal title: Admiral Cigarette\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1897\n\nrunning time: 30 sec.\n\nAnd Then We Marched\n\ndirector: Lynne Sachs\n\noriginal title: And Then We Marched\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 2017\n\nrunning time: 3 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nOne day after the presidential inauguration in January 2017, the Womenʼs March took place in Washington D.C. Footage from the demonstration, shot with Super8 camera, is combined with archival footage of the protest marches from various moments in the US history. A visual whirl of the protesters᾽ faces and banners is accompanied by a childʼs voice which is trying to express as accurately as possible what it means to fight for oneʼs own rights.\n\nbiography\n\nLynne Sachs (* 1961) is an experimental filmmaker and poet, a director of more than 40 films and the author of many installations, performances and web projects. In her work she explores the relationship between the close and the remote, the intimate and the public, the visual and the audio.\n\nBeginning a Skyscraper\n\ndirector: Robert K. Bonine\n\noriginal title: Beginning a Skyscraper\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1902\n\nrunning time: 40 sec.\n\nCase Sound Tests\n\ndirector: Theodore Case\n\noriginal title: Case Sound Tests\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1925\n\nrunning time: 10 min.\n\nEarly Superimpositions\n\ndirector: Frederick S. Armitage\n\noriginal title: Early Superimpositions\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1900\n\nrunning time: 1 min.\n\nEnergy Energy\n\ndirector: Karel Doing\n\noriginal title: Energy Energy\n\ncountry: Netherlands\n\nyear: 1999\n\nrunning time: 7 min.\n\nEuropa\n\ndirector: Stefan Themerson, Franciszka Themerson\n\noriginal title: Europa\n\ncountry: Poland\n\nyear: 1931\n\nrunning time: 11 min.\n\nFuturo\n\ndirector: Mika Taanila\n\noriginal title: Futuro – Tulevaisuuden olotila\n\ncountry: Finland\n\nyear: 1998\n\nrunning time: 28 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nA plastic puzzle of 16 parts, made in Finland: UFO, uterus, butterfly, playhouse. This prefabricated building, to be placed on the top of the mountains or the African coast, represented the dreamy future the humankind was about to enter in 1968. The story of the rise and fall of Futuro is the story of the idea of a future man, the idea which emerges and disperses.\n\nbiography\n\nMika Taanila (* 1965) is a Finnish experimental filmmaker and visual artist. In his films and video installations he often explores the history and the present of the utopian visions. His work has been screened at the major festivals and displayed in the galleries of contemporary art.\n\nGlass\n\ndirector: Bert Haanstra\n\noriginal title: Glas\n\ncountry: Netherlands\n\nyear: 1958\n\nrunning time: 10 min.\n\nInterim\n\ndirector: Stan Brakhage\n\noriginal title: Interim\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1952\n\nrunning time: 25 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nStan Brakhage’s debut film tells the story of the surge, pacification, and outflow of desire awakened by an accidental encounter between two beings temporarily frozen in time — a man and a woman — who stand below an arcade of viaducts as one car after another speeds by above them. The sensual piano accompaniment was complemented by Brakhage’s roommate and future composer, James Tenney.\n\nbiography\n\nStan Brakhage (1933–2003) was a prominent, American experimental filmmaker, educator, and author of several books. Throughout his prolific filmography, you’ll find strong intimate films, exhilarating social documentaries, and purely abstract cinematic works; four-minute and four-hour works; and films shot with or without a camera.\n\nInterior NY Subway, 14th Steet to 42nd\n\ndirector: Gottfried Wilhelm Bitzer\n\noriginal title: Interior NY Subway, 14th Street to 42nd Street\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1905\n\nrunning time: 5 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nThis groundbreaking film shot six months after the opening of the New York subway follows a train traveling from Union Square to Grand Central Station. The dark tunnel is illuminated not only by the train that’s transporting the cameraman, but also by the headlights of a car driving along the sideline. The lighting takes full advantage of the architecture of the tunnel, which is reinforced with white columns arranged closely together one-by-one.\n\nbiography\n\nG. W. Bitzer (1872–1944) was an American cameraman known mainly for his work he did for D. W. Griffith. At the beginning of his professional career, he worked for the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, the first-ever production company in the US devoted solely to filmmaking, for which he also shot a film of the newly opened New York subway.\n\nIntrospection\n\ndirector: Sara Kathryn Arledge\n\noriginal title: Introspection\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1941\n\nrunning time: 6 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nAn abstract dance film presenting disembodied parts of dancers clad in tight clothing that move around freely in a blank space. With this film, Arledge helped create a new film genre – ciné-dance – in which the dancing body rids itself of its physical limitations and takes on a pure form.\n\nbiography\n\nSara Kathryn Arledge (1911–1998) was a prominent, American experimental filmmaker whose most important works were Introspection (1941–1947) and What Is a Man? (1958). She also spent time painting and creating hand-painted glass slides, which she then compiled into the “stable films” Tender Images (1978) and Interior Garden (1978).\n\nJack’s Dream\n\ndirector: Joseph Cornell\n\noriginal title: Jack’s Dream\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1938\n\nrunning time: 4 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nJack, a puppet dog, has a lucid dream where he encounters not only his brave counterpart but also a dragon, a king, and a princess. The plotline of this small puppet drama alone is, perhaps, enough to label it a surrealist work; but on top of that, the film is interspersed with shots of a sinking schooner and galloping seahorses. The soundtrack to the film was provided by Larry Jordan.\n\nbiography\n\nJoseph Cornell (1903–1972) was an American surrealist, self-taught artist, a creator of collages and boxes with found objects, and a film collector. From the 1930s, he also created film collages using found footage, and in collaboration with filmmakers such as Stan Brakhage, Rudy Burckhardt, and Larry Jordan, he also made his own films.\n\nLearned Spontaneous Movements\n\ndirector: Dóra Maurer\n\noriginal title: Megtanult önkéntelen mozgások\n\ncountry: Hungary\n\nyear: 1973\n\nrunning time: 9 min.\n\nLeaving the 20th Century\n\ndirector: Max Almy\n\noriginal title: Leaving the 20th Century\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1982\n\nrunning time: 10 min.\n\nManhatta\n\ndirector: Charles Sheeler, Paul Strand\n\noriginal title: Manhatta\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1921\n\nrunning time: 9 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nRegarded as one of the first avant-garde films made in the US, Sheeler and Strand’s Manhatta is a dialogue of poetry, photography, and New York City. In the poem Mannahatta, which appears in the title cards throughout the film, Walt Whitman invokes the “original name” of his city, the word “resounding, healthy, untamed, musical, self-sufficient.” The bearer of this name is represented by 65 shots emphasizing the contours of artificial, natural, and human layers that intersect within it.\n\nbiography\n\nCharles Sheeler (1883–1965) studied painting and drawing but made his living as a photographer working for architects. His own artwork stems from urban and industrial photography. Paul Strand (1890–1976) made a name for himself as a photographer in New York, having been attracted to modern architecture, the play of light and shadow, and the faces of impoverished immigrants.\n\nMr. Edison at work in his chemical laboratory\n\ndirector: William Heise, James H. White\n\noriginal title: Mr. Edison at work in his chemical laboratory\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1897\n\nrunning time: 1 min.\n\nOil – A Symphony in Motion\n\ndirector: M.G. MacPherson\n\noriginal title: Oil – A Symphony in Motion\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1933\n\nrunning time: 7 min.\n\nPalace of Electricity\n\ndirector: James H. White\n\noriginal title: Palace of Electricity\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1900\n\nrunning time: 1 min.\n\nRhythm in Light\n\ndirector: Melville Webber, Ted Nemeth, Mary Ellen Bute\n\noriginal title: Rhythm in Light\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1934\n\nrunning time: 5 min.\n\nRose Hobart\n\ndirector: Joseph Cornell\n\noriginal title: Rose Hobart\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1936\n\nrunning time: 19 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nOscillating between homage and obsession, the film distills the gestures, expressions, and posture of Rose Hobart, the heroine of the exotic Hollywood drama East of Borneo (G. Melford, 1931). Cornell’s version of the film, reckless with the plot and other characters, slowed down, shrouded in violet blue, complete with Brazilian underscore and eclipse shots, frees Hobart from the encumbrances of cliché, stereotyping, and narrative gossip.\n\nbiography\n\nJoseph Cornell (1903–1972) was an American surrealist, self-taught artist, creator of collages and found-object boxes, and film collector. From the 1930s onwards, he also created film collages using found footage and made his own films in collaboration with filmmakers such as Stan Brakhage, Rudy Burckhardt, and Larry Jordan.\n\nScene from the Elevator Ascending Eiffel Tower\n\ndirector: James H. White\n\noriginal title: Scene from the Elevator Ascending Eiffel Tower\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1900\n\nrunning time: 2 min.\n\nScience Friction\n\ndirector: Stan VanDerBeek\n\noriginal title: Science Friction\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1959\n\nrunning time: 10 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nVanDerBeek describes his neo-Dadaist film collage, shot using the technique of phase animation, as “a social satire aimed at the rockets, scientists, and competitive mania of our time”. In his vision, science inevitably becomes an accomplice of power, a means of torture, manipulation, and control that ultimately threatens not just some, but the entire planet.\n\nbiography\n\nStan VanDerBeek (1927–1984) was an American multimedia artist, thinker, and inventor who began working with film in 1955. Science Friction was named the best experimental film at the 1962 Oberhausen Film Festival. In 1964 he built the Moviedrome, an audiovisual laboratory for multimedia experiments, in a former silo.\n\nThe Dickson Experimental Sound Film\n\ndirector: William K. L. Dickson\n\noriginal title: The Dickson Experimental Sound Film\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1894\n\nrunning time: 1 min.\n\nThe Light Penetrates the Dark\n\ndirector: Otakar Vávra, František Pilát\n\noriginal title: Světlo proniká tmou\n\ncountry: Czechoslovakia\n\nyear: 1930\n\nrunning time: 4 min.\n\nThe Maltese Cross Movement\n\ndirector: A. Keewatin Dewdney\n\noriginal title: The Maltese Cross Movement\n\ncountry: Canada\n\nyear: 1967\n\nrunning time: 6 min.\n\nTransformation by Holding Time (Landscape)\n\ndirector: Paul de Nooijer\n\noriginal title: Transformation by Holding Time (Landscape)\n\ncountry: Netherlands\n\nyear: 1976\n\nrunning time: 2 min.\n\nTwo Marches\n\ndirector: Jim Hubbard\n\noriginal title: Two Marches\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1991\n\nrunning time: 9 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nThe first March on Washington for Gay and Lesbian Rights took place in October 1979, and another eight years later. In a non-violent juxtaposition of footage from both marches, Hubbard allows us to reflect on subtle and distinct shifts in the modes of protest expression, atmosphere, and shared perspectives.\n\nbiography\n\nJim Hubbard (* 1951) is an experimental filmmaker who has made films and videos centered around protests organized by members of the LGBTQ and AIDS communities. He founded the MIX festival of gay and lesbian experimental film and video in New York. He’s building a collection of interviews with people infected with AIDS.\n\nUnreal News Reels\n\ndirector: Joseph Cornell\n\noriginal title: Unreal News Reels\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 1924\n\nrunning time: 8 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nJoseph Cornell’s original compilation from his own film collection is based on the low-budget slapstick cartoons produced in the 1920s and 1930s by the Weiss Brothers, which Cornell turns into a parody of newsreels through subtle textual intervention.\n\nbiography\n\nJoseph Cornell (1903–1972) was an American surrealist, self-taught artist, creator of collages and found-object boxes, and film collector. From the 1930s onwards, he also created film collages using found footage and made his own films in collaboration with filmmakers such as Stan Brakhage, Rudy Burckhardt, and Larry Jordan.\n\nVelocità\n\ndirector: Pippo Oriani, Guido Martina, Tina Cordero\n\noriginal title: Velocità\n\ncountry: Italy\n\nyear: 1930\n\nrunning time: 13 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nAlthough Marinetti wrote the Manifesto of Futurist Cinema, Velocità is seen by some as the only futuristic film in its own right. Beside a dense intertextual network and a mechanic dance of the screen titles and objects dancing to stop-motion beats, the movie features a unique showcase of air painting on film and a few swinging frames from the streets of Turin.\n\nbiography\n\nPippo Oriani (1909–1972) was an architect and painter who claimed allegiance to the second wave of futurism. Velocità is his only film. He cooperated on it with Tina Cordero and Guido Martina, the founders of the Futurista Film company and the authors of the 1931 manifesto The Avant-garde Integral: Marinetti and futurism in film.\n\nYear 2000\n\ndirector: Gianfranco Brebbia\n\noriginal title: ANNO 2000\n\ncountry: Italy\n\nyear: 1969\n\nrunning time: 13 min.\n\nAnd Then We Marched\n\nhttps://www.ji-hlava.com/filmy/a-potom-jsme-pochodovali\n\ndirector: Lynne Sachs\n\noriginal title: And Then We Marched\n\ncountry: United States\n\nyear: 2017\n\nrunning time: 3 min.\n\nsynopsis\n\nOne day after the presidential inauguration in January 2017, the Womenʼs March took place in Washington D.C. Footage from the demonstration, shot with Super8 camera, is combined with archival footage of the protest marches from various moments in the US history. A visual whirl of the protesters᾽ faces and banners is accompanied by a childʼs voice which is trying to express as accurately as possible what it means to fight for oneʼs own rights.\n\nbiography\n\nLynne Sachs (* 1961) is an experimental filmmaker and poet, a director of more than 40 films and the author of many installations, performances and web projects. In her work she explores the relationship between the close and the remote, the intimate and the public, the visual and the audio."
