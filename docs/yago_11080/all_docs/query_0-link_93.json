        "text": "What should children watch?\n\nDisclaimer! This was written as an e-mail to a friend who made the mistake of asking me \"what should children watch?\" This was my rant on one of my favourite subjects:)\n\nWhen to start?\n\nStart as late as possible. What children need in the initial years (from 0 to 7 years) are real experiences. Through real experiences, they make sense of the world and learn about themselves. (All learning has to happen from their own real experiences). So in a developmental point of view, in this stage of life, they are not looking for images of the experience. They are looking for those real experiences. Films and videos simulate an experience for them without them actually going through that experience themselves. That limits their opportunity for learning and sensory exploration in this most vital stage of brain development.\n\nSo ‘real play’ is the fundamental need in early years. Exposing children to media is our need to keep them out of our way; it is not their real developmental need. Daily morning and evening, one hour each if you can take them to a park or beach or a garden or any other open space where they can freely run around - that will be great to begin with. It will be wonderful to see how they work with their bodies in climbing the trees or jumping in the water or rolling on the sand. And when they are at home, let them dirty their hands and play with whatever is ‘real' around them. We will be amazed at their ability to play creatively when we let them loose and make them part of our normal life. They usually have no interest in toys but they love to join in mixing wheat and water when we are making rotis. They make a beautiful mess but that is a far more enriching experience than a Disney film in this age.\n\nChildren should be able to experience different materials in this age. Textures, flow, temperatures, weather conditions…how many children are encouraged by their parents to get wet in the rain? Which, incidentally, is one of the most amazing real experiences for a growing body. There is a variety of toys available in the market but all of them are made from one single material - hard plastic. By playing with these toys, the child is missing out on the experience of understanding a whole range of materials and textures from real life. Then comes the colours; toy companies like Funskool, etc., have reduced the entire colour palette to a few primary colours, leaving out an entire world of colours. Everything is either bright yellow, green, blue or red...it is criminal.\n\nThe famous experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage has said this beautifully - when a small baby crawls over a lawn of grass, she is seeing hundreds of colours in front of her, that 'wonder' lasts till we call all those colours ‘green’:) So it is very important that we let children explore the world around on their own without much of our intervention. That exploration will become the foundation for a curious adult. Early media exposure will kill that exploration.\n\nSo in short; absolutely no media till the age of 7.\n\nHow to start?\n\nWe adults, consider films and videos as entertainment (so not to be taken seriously). We believe learning is something which we do in a classroom or with textbook. But for an early year brain, there is absolutely no distinction between learning and entertainment. For them everything is ‘learning’. Everything we expose them to in their early years will have a deep impact on shaping their brain and a life long effect on their personality.\n\nWhen we start showing films and media to children (preferably after the child turns 7) we can start with some simple real action short films (no cartoon/animation). Don’t choose something which they can watch passively but always choose something which demands their attention, something which demands their involvement, something that can start a conversation between the child and the parent. Through these conversations, they slowly learn to decode images and learn the language of cinema. Also through conversations, they develop the skill of understanding meaning from different perspectives. Once this foundation is built, they will never be a passive audience.\n\nWhy no animation?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with animation as a filmmaking technique; it is exciting. But the problem is that most of the popular films made in this format are designed for passive viewing. They want the child to forget everything and just be mesmerised by the visuals and sounds. This is not good news for a brain whose top developmental priority is interaction and involvement.\n\nThe dramatic structure which Disney and Pixar films use in the animation films is the same structure of a typical Hollywood film - which is emotionally manipulative. The child goes through various simulated emotions without actually going through any of those experiences. The response hormones which the body creates while watching these actions on screen do not get neutralised by the body, because there is no corresponding physical action on the child's part. So these unresolved emotions get stored in the body as toxins.This is very damaging for the body and mind of the child.\n\nAlso the pace of these popular animation films is a problem. In an average hundred minute film, there are about 2000 to 3000 cuts. This means the child is bombarded with many images, actions, movements, angles and magnifications in a short span of time. Once the child gets used to this pace, the ordinary, everyday life starts looking too boring and a moment of silence becomes unbearable.\n\nThen there is a whole market attached to these films. Through the films, these big studios make children fall in love with the main few characters and then these characters become merchandise. And slowly, the young pure minds of the children are trapped in the world of these few popular characters without much choice. It can limit all their exploration outside of it, not just in their thinking, but everything from their water bottles to their chappals will be taken over by these creatures. It is not possible anymore to buy a good ergonomically designed water bottle for your child; the final decision will be made based on the character image on the product. We can’t anymore have a conversation with a child about what material is best for their shoes. They are only interested in the peripherals.\n\nWhen we talk about it, many people ask us this question, \"By not exposing your child to animation films, are you 'controlling' her life too much from her normal environment?\" My answer to them is another question….\"Do you know the size of the marketing department in Disney?\" Hundreds of people are working there to control our child’s taste. So if we don’t control our child's environment, they will:)\" I believe we have better interest in our child's future than a Disney studio marketing department.\n\nOur journey so far:\n\nHaving said that, implementing these thoughts are a huge struggle. It is not easy, it takes a lot of patience and hard work to find the films, access best copies and then present it to the child in a proper setting.\n\nSharing our journey here, just as an idea - maybe these are not the best, but this is what we could do in that point in time. You may find better options if you do your own research.\n\nThe first moving film which Maya saw was A Chairy Tale, ​a short film by Norman McLaren. We have seen this little film many times together. We had interesting conversations around this simple film. We spoke about the subject, its meaning, its filmmaking technique, music, etc. That whole year we focused on seeing many short films. We have watched each film over and over again. Mainly we chose classic short films of Dutch master filmmaker - Bert Haanstra. The objective was to familiarise her with the language and grammar of film. Once the child knows the language of cinema in its fundamental elements, the child can appreciate cinema much better. The child will easily realise when it is being emotionally manipulated or there is a real emotion conveyed. Bert Haanstra’s films are the masterclass on film editing and structure. Best examples to get to know the fundamental language of cinema! His films are Zoo, Glass, Mirror of Holland etc. (Many of them are available in youtube)\n\nEach of these films gave us the opportunity to have great conversations with Maya: Zoo about human animal relationship, Glass about art and industry. Mirror of Holland about the beauty of looking at everything upside down…literally:)\n\nThere were many more short films we found, which we kept playing for next few years. By the time she was ready to sit through longer duration of time and developed good understanding of language, we found documentaries of David Attenborough.\n\nDavid Attenborough documentaries\n\n​\n\nHe is a blessing to this planet. His films are the best thing that can happen to a curious child. His beautifully narrated films will give children a perspective of how we humans are a small part of the larger scheme of things. This is an important lesson every growing child should learn to build a sensitivity towards the natural world. Also these are great films to watch as a family together and learn about life, death, sex, reproduction, our roles, our responsibilities..so on.\n\nPlanet Earth, Blue Planet, Natural Curiosities, Birds, Life on Earth, Frozen Planet….there are plenty and they are easy to access.\n\nAlso there are many other simple image based documentaries which Maya loved watching, here is one such: Babies (France)Thomas Balmès\n\nJacques Tati films\n\nTati is a great gift to both children and adults; he is subtle, a master of mime and comedy. He made only a handful of films in his whole career but each film is a master work, made with elaborate sets and choreography of events. Maya loved them. We have seen some of them at least 10 times already. Hulot's Holiday, Mon Oncle, Playtime, Traffic, Parade, etc.\n\nThen there was a natural progression to films of Keaton and Chaplin:\n\nBuster Keaton\n\nThe master of slapstick comedy. Sourcing good quality prints is tough. But we have managed. The best films are: The Goat, Sherlock Jr., The General, Steamboat Bill Jr., The Cameraman…so on.\n\nCharle Chaplin\n\nThe universal problem with Chaplin films is that everyone thinks they have seen all Chaplin films but people have rarely looked at Chaplin seriously and seen the amazing body of work he has created. He is the greatest artist cinema has ever produced. There are only seven or eight films. Maya has seen all his films many times over and we still watch it every now and then. We also have a book on his life and work. Maya keeps referring to the book and reads about each film, how it was made, etc. Chaplin is an ideal classic cinema experience a child should grow up with.\n\nNext was our search beyond these classics and masters to find more contemporary films:\n\nThere are no good children's films.\n\nUnfortunately yes! We have spent a lot of time and effort looking for good children's films. But it is a dead end. The so called children's films are films made by adults who think this is what children want to watch. Children’s films today can fall into two categories; one is the market oriented films which want to hijack children's imagination and treat them like zombies. And the other category is to give children a moral message through stories. Both are damaging. There is hardly any children's film which engages with children, demanding their participation as equals and respects their intelligence.\n\nSo we have stopped looking for children's films any more. Instead we have selected good adult films which are suitable for children to watch. Adult films without any heavy violence or any other content which she is not ready to watch. Iranian films came handy in this situation. Because of Iran’s heavy censorship rules, most of the Iranian adult films are clean to be watched by children. But that is not the only reason for choosing Iranian films. Iranian films' base is poetry, so they are very subtle, intelligent and they have many layers...they open up possibilities for interpretation and conversations.\n\nSome of the adult films Maya has seen and enjoyed:\n\nA Moment Of Innocence Mohsen Makhmalbaf,The Day I Became A Woman Marziyeh Meshkiny, Gabbeh Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Close-up Abbas Kiarostami, Where Is the Friend's Home Abbas Kiarostami, Bicycle Thieves Vittorio De Sica, 12 Angry Men Sidney Lumet, High and LowAkira Kurosawa,Drifting Clouds Aki Kaurismäki, MahabharataPeter Brook (This a great gift for children, the only film version of Mahabharata minus the glitter).\n\nWe also watch lots of interesting documentaries together:BarakaRon Fricke, Samsara Ron Fricke, Food Inc. Robert Kenner, Where to invade next?Michael Moore, Bowling for ColumbineMichael Moore, Pina Wim Wenders, Buena Vista Social Club Wim Wenders, Ape and Super-ApeBert Haanstra, The Salt of the Earth Wim Wenders, Lo and Behold Werner Herzog, Nanook of the North Robert J. Flaherty.\n\nThere are many more films we have explored, this is just to give you an idea of what is possible. (Please see the link at the end of this post for the full list of 100+ films)\n\nFilms of their interest.\n\n​\n\nSometime in between all this, we get a glimpse of what the child's real interest is. Maya was very clear that Ballet is her interest. So apart from the above mentioned films, we got lots of Ballet recordings. She keeps watching them once in a while. Also we got many documentaries about various ballet companies, choreographers, costume designers, behind the scenes, rehearsals, etc.\n\nTV or no TV?\n\nThis question pops up every now and then in these discussions. 'No' is the answer to conventional television. This means a lot to the family. If you have the habit of watching TV, you will have to give that up till the child is 20years:) We had a TV at home. After Maya was born, we gave away our TV and disconnected the cable connection. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar has some really nice documentaries and some rare adult films suitable for children but their children's section has got only the usual and avoidable content.\n\nLast but not the least; How to watch?\n\nIt is not all about getting the best content; it is also important to look at the ritual of watching a film. This is very, very important, as important as the content. We have to create a nice environment so that films can be watched the way they are meant to be enjoyed. Show films only on your home theatre set up. In a nice evening, after a nice bath, bring the children, make them sit down and relax a bit, give them something nice to eat or drink (so no distraction of eating while watching the film) and then dim the lights, switch off your phones and show the film in a proper HD print, in total darkness, in a large screen, with best sound, right volume settings, etc. Even if it is a 10 minute short film from youtube, let's stream it through Apple TV and watch it on the proper home theatre experience with all the rituals. Also timing is important; having a dedicated movie time will help so that the viewing is not interrupted.\n\nMany of these films mentioned above are very subtle films and they demand lot of attention from the audience on image and sound. They will fall flat if shown in an environment which doesn’t do justice to the sound or image or if there is any other distraction. So no watching films on mobiles, iPads, laptops and TV. We have to teach our children to take cinema seriously as the most engaging art form of our time and give it the respect it deserves.\n\nAs the Russian filmmaker Alexander Sokurov once said:\n\n​“Films are a window to the world, you should watch it at least in a window's size”.\n\n******\n\nThis is the link to see the full list of films Maya watched so far:\n\nhttps://mubi.com/lists/the-films-maya-watched-so-far\n\n​\n\n******\n\n​Why is he trending?\n\nAbbas Kiarostami passed away on 4th July 2016 at the age of 76. Ever since he passed away, there has been a lot of interest about him. I am hearing his name in unexpected places, from unexpected people. I am getting phone calls and SMSes from people who are looking for DVDs of his films and people are forwarding me his interviews and articles. I was surprised when an old friend and a big film buff from Delhi whom I had been trying (without much success) to convince to watch a few Kiarostami films finally called yesterday to know where he could download a copy of Where is my friend’s home?.\n\nThis is not just my experience; Kiarostami was everywhere on social media for the past few days. It got to a point in which, some girl innocently commented to a friend who posted a Kiarostami interview, “Why is he trending, any reason…?” Since 4th of July, so much of material has surfaced in mainstream Indian media, internet and social media about Kiarostami (Economic Times, Times of India, Hindu, DNA, Express, Outlook,…you name it.) Lots of people are reading it, liking it, talking about it, sharing it, watching his interviews and even watching his films.\n\n​\n\nAll this is making me happy even though this is a sad occasion. Finally lots of people are going to discover Kiarostami. And lots more who had tasted cherries before are going to re-discover Kiarostami (which is great because his films demand multiple viewing and lots of contemplation). But what I found interesting is that like in a possible Kiarostami script the reason for this new found interest in him and his work is caused by his ‘death’. He was trending because he was no more.\n\nAre we obsessed with ending?\n\nIt was not that he was not news worthy when he was alive. He was the winner of every possible award on earth like Roberto Rossellini Prize, Francois Truffaut Award, Pier Pablo Passolini Award, Federico Fellini Medal, Akira Kurosawa Award, Palme d’Or at Cannes, Silver Lion at Venice, Gold Leopard at Locarno, and in 2000 a historic poll conducted among the critics and directors across the world voted him as the most important ‘director of the decade.’\n\nLeave the recognitions aside; for the past four decades Kiarostami was consistently pushing the boundaries of cinema by creating highly experimental, innovative and original work. \"Kiarostami represents the highest level of artistry in the cinema.\" - Martin Scorsese said this ten years ago. Not just in cinema but in poetry, photography, installation and performing arts as well. “The films of Abbas Kiarostami are extraordinary. Words cannot describe my feelings about them and I simply advise you to see his films.” said Akira Kurosawa. But still we never heard enough about him in the media and social media when all that great work was happening.\n\nKiarostami’s creative energy was flowing in its full stream till the end. But we have failed to observe this beautiful flow while it was alive. The irony is that Kiarostami was an artist who constantly reminded us of the importance of observing. His films are about observation, they are made with passionate observation and they demand deep observation. The Haiku kind of poems he has written about simple observations of a moment. His photographic work is the product of his lonely drives across Iran’s landscape observing trees, birds, animals and snow. But we belong to another kind of an audience who didn’t want to observe what was happening quietly and naturally. We just want to know what happens in the end.\n\nWerner Herzog gave us a sweet warning when Kairostami was alive. Herzog put it beautifully, “We don’t know it yet, we are living in the age of Kiarostami” I think the first part of this line captures the truth best; we were living in the age of Kiarostami, but we didn’t realise it till that age ended. Like in a conventional film, we were just obsessed with the ending.\n\nBeauty of the open ending.\n\nIn many of Kiarostami’s films the ending is abrupt. His films end when you least expect. He ends without revealing much, he never concludes anything for the audience, he leaves it open for you to make your own conclusion. By ending a film in this way, he pushes the audience to return to the film in their mind and begin an enquiry to find the beautifully hidden truths, to fill in the playful gaps he created and become part of the creative process of Kiarsotami. So the ending of a Kiarostami film becomes a beginning for the audience.\n\nThis is exactly what happened with his departure. He was 76 and perfectly healthy and in his best spirits. He was working on exciting projects, including a new film to be filmed in China. No one was expecting an end. And then all of a sudden he decided to roll the credits. Unlike how it is done conventionally, he didn’t fade away to an obvious ending. He ended at the most unexpected moment. That is why his abrupt ending is generating so much of attention and has become a beginning for many of us to find Abbas Kiarostami.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nIt sprouted\n\nblossomed\n\nwithered\n\nand fell to the ground.\n\nNot a soul to see it.\n\n-Abbas Kiarostami\n\n1. The Ozu effect\n\nThere is something unique about Japanese master filmmaker Ozu’s films. Most of his films are about the day-to-day lives of simple families. These films are mostly set within the four walls of the house; the camera hardly moves out of the house. But through the subtle observation of the characters within the family and their relationship, he brilliantly reflects upon the larger social and political changes happening outside of the four walls. By spending enough time and deeply observing the otherwise insignificant events happening within the family, we the audience can sense the larger forces playing in that society in that time. Nothing is direct, it is all in the air for us to see. These simple family dramas (without much drama) are more ‘political’ than any other ‘political films’.\n\nSimilar to an Ozu film, the subtle changes happening in my own little family have given me insights into the larger political and social changes happening in our country ever since AAP happened. Till few weeks back the atmosphere in the mornings at our house was never pleasant. As soon as we woke up, Shilpa and myself wanted to drink our tea and read the newspapers quietly but Maya (our 6 year old daughter) wanted to ask questions about what we are reading and wanting to have a conversation about it. So there was a constant tension in the house because for us reading the newspaper was our activity and we didn’t want to be disturbed by Maya and from her point of view she couldn't understand why couldn’t we explain what we were reading. We kept on telling her that she won’t understand most of the things which come in the paper - it is only for big people.\n\nBut the truth was that we didn’t know how to explain to her the news we were reading; scams, rapes, political murders, inflation, price raise, terrorism, farmers suicides etc. Everything was negative and hopeless. We didn’t know how to explain all these concepts to a child who came to this world totally innocent and hopeful. So we made our efforts to keep her quiet in the morning and she kept protesting.\n\nToday we are a happy family right from early morning. In the mornings now all three of us sit together and read the newspaper. We read about a chief minister who travels in the same car as our WagonR. We read about a chief minister who stopped his car at the traffic lights and asked people about how they were doing? We read together about a chief minister who said I don’t want a large house to stay. We read about a chief minister who made electricity and water charges affordable to the common man. We together read about a chief minister who sat on the street and protested till the central government listened to his demands (Maya loved this story since she has done this couple of times herself on MG Road and CMH Road) These are simple concepts to explain to a six year old and reassure her about the goodness of the world she was born into. Like in an Ozu’s film I see this bit of happiness we share in our family, as a reflection of what is going on around. There is a new energy and hope which even a six year old can feel.\n\nOn a bit more serious note, I myself was feeling a bit low for sometime now. There was an unknown kind of sadness, a sense of hopelessness, frustration, anger, a feeling of trapped energy inside. There could be many reasons for it, from personal relationships to professional uncertainty to a sort of frustration in looking at the world around in which my daughter is going to growing up in. Even though I have done many things to overcome this feeling including yoga and meditation, I was still feeling weak, helpless and had kind of given up. But in the past one month I am finding that there is a new kind of energy within me. I am not feeling all that bad anymore. I feel some kind of strength and confidence that I won’t give up. I didn’t want to make that wild connection but still as what happens in an Ozu film, the emergence of Aam Aadmi Party may have something to do with my new found energy.\n\n2. The signal man\n\nThe other day I was at Banaswadi railway station. Banswadi is a tiny railway station in Bangalore, there are no markings or signboards on the platform to know about the coach position of your train. It was night and since my train stops there only for one for one minute, it was critical for me to get an idea of where my coach was going to stop. Then I saw in front of the station master’s office a railway official was waiting with the signal flags. I went upto him and asked him for the coach postion. He got so upset and started to shout at me saying that his job was to show the signal and not answer my questions. I didn’t argue with him, I just turned around and walked away. While walking, just for the fun of it I said (more to myself than to him) “Jab Aam Aadmi Party aayega, toh sub kutch theek ho jayega’’ (when Amam Aadmi party comes, everything will be alright) After hearing this he walked with me and showed me the position of my coach in the platform and went back.\n\nI was thinking, why did he do it? Was he scared that I am an AAP guy and I am going to complain about him? No, anyway giving this information was not his responsibility, so he was not scared of any complaint. I think he did what he did because he suddenly found a new relationship with me as another common man, unlike earlier where he looked at me as another class. He felt that he has got a responsibility towards me as a fellow citizen beyond his work. It has nothing do with AAP directly but i think the energy that has been brought in by AAP has beautiful side effects like this; many people have started to feel that they have a responsibility towards other common men.\n\n3. I love people who break the law\n\nLots of people including many APP supporters were upset about AAP's decision to go on a dharna. But in my case, I became more of an admirer of AAP after the dharna than before. If you are out there to change the system, you have to break the rules. You have to start new practises. You have to shake up the system. You can’t do things in ‘proper channel’ because that proper channels and processes are what got us here in this mess. Rules are made by the people to help the people, we shouldn’t become slaves of rules and systems we have created for our own good. We should be able to challenge them and change them if our intentions are right and we have a larger cause.\n\nGrowing up in Kerala with Dharnas and Harthals every other day, I couldn’t understand why people were making a big deal about a chief minister sitting on a peaceful dharna for two days. Above that calling this dharna 'Anarchy' is an insult to the word Anarchy. Every one from the other established parties, media and the President of India himself criticised AAP for not sitting in the office and ‘governing’ like all other elected governments do. Essentially what they are saying is you were activists before the election, now you are a government, so you have to change your behaviour and become like us.\n\nThey want AAP to come to their side; the elite club of power. Which in India is a nexus of political class, industry and media. In the time of Lokpal agitation this nexus perceived Arvind Kejriwal and friends as some insignificant outsider trying to disrupt the system. Later when those protesters decided to contest elections the nexus perceived them as the outsiders trying to become insiders. Now when the protesters won the election and came to power, the nexus expected them to have become insiders. But AAP refuses to join the club and wants to remain an outsider. That is what is making AAP unique. That is also what is making the nexus very uncomfortable; they don’t know how to deal with this new animal. So they started blabbering all kinds of things like lack of governance, immature, anarchy, gimmickry, unconstitutional, dignity of the government etc.\n\nBut I love the way in which AAP is willing to try new experiments and dirty their hands. They don’t want to be in any conmfort zone, they are taking risks, they are not willing to let go of anything they believe strongly. So I sincerely hope AAP ignores the opinion of the media, other conventional political parties, the President of India and Captain Gopinath. They should go ahead and break more rules and disrupt the system. AAP, please stay as activists, please stay as an outsider.\n\n4. The gang rape by media\n\nWhen the entire mainstream english news channels are ganging up in attacking AAP, one should understand that AAP is doing something right. The way in which Times Now, CNN IBN, NDTV, Headline Today and News X is going about attacking AAP is shocking. It is totally manipulative and unethical. Media doesn’t realise that any sensible person can see through them and figure out what is going on. I kept wondering why these experienced journalists are doing this? Then I realised this gang rape of AAP started ever since AAP government refused FDI in retail and ordered an audit of the power companies’ accounts; till then AAP was the darling of the media. Again when I came to know most of these media houses are owned by the Ambanis and Birlas, it completes the picture.\n\nMedia somewhere believes that they have created AAP and now they have the power to kill it as well. It is in a way a real test for the media about their impact - it will be interesting to wait and watch what will happen.\n\n5. Simplicity in a complex time\n\nLast Sunday’s Hindu carried an an article against AAP in which the writer complains: “Kejriwal has reduced everything to simple, practical solutions”. I don’t understand why she is saying it is a problem? We live in complex times. If someone has managed to come up with simple, practical solutions we should appreciate it. I will call it the the genius of Arvind Kejriwal to make the complex into a few simple practical solutions.\n\nIn my whole career in communication and design I tried to achieve this in my work; find simple and practical solutions to what appears to be a complex problem. And every time I tried to do that, there was always resistance because many people make a living out of those complexities. They have to justify their existence by making everything they do seems like rocket science.\n\nSimplifying is the hardest thing to do. It is a difficult process to take out all the unnecessary layers to get to the fundamental of the problem and then come up with a soloution. When Modi says ‘Good Governance’ it is a complex abstract concept. What is governance? What is good? For whom? We have no clue about how it affects our everyday lives. When Rahul Gandhi says ‘Inclusive Growth’ we don’t see any clear path in which he is going to achieve this for us, and there is no way to measure the result. But when Kejriwal says ‘People in an area should decide how government money is to be spent in that area’, it is a simple, practical, measurable solution.\n\nCan you find a more simple and fundamental expression than ‘Power to the people’ when talking about democracy? Look at the symbol of AAP - a party which came to clean up the system can’t have a better symbol than the broom. This clarity of thought and simplicity of expression is what makes me look up to AAP.\n\n6. To my dear friends\n\nMany of my dear friends warn me not to get all excited about AAP. They tell me to wait and watch. Because AAP hasn’t shown their true colours as yet. Some say they are another bunch of opportunists, some say they are right-wing people in disguise, some say they are old fashioned leftists, some say they are funded by foreign organisations to disrupt our country. Frankly I am not as well informed as my friends on all these matters, so my friends could be right in these theories. Right now I find AAP interesting and I am attracted to it. If tomorrow AAP shows their true colour and if they turn out to be any of the ones mentioned above then I won’t support them and I will have no ego problems or shame in changing my opinions. As a Vipasana meditator I know how not to get attached to anything deeply.\n\nTwenty five years ago when most of the young boys of my age where busy exploring girls, in a small village in Kerala, I and a group of virgin mallu boys used to meet everyday in a bookstore owned by one of our friend's father to discuss politics. And the nights we spent sticking posters and writing walls for the parties as the foot-soldiers. Being born in Kerala in that time meant you had politics in your blood. We were concernd about everything from the state, national and international politics and its impact on our societies. All of us had different political beliefs; some worked actively for the party sacrificing a lot and some supported the party. But all of us believed that we are working for a better world. But as time passed, we realised slowly that our parties have failed us, big time. The parties have existed only for the sake of the party. Our group has dissolved and we moved to many parts of the country. Many of us never felt like engaging with politics again, we also lost touch which each other. Few days ago out of the blue one of them contacted me from Delhi. We haven't spoken about AAP in our conversation, but I knew exactly why he felt like getting in touch with me, he was excited like hew was twenty five years ago. Since the emergence of AAP, I am also feeling a similar kind of involvement with politics which I felt twenty five years back.\n\nSo please let me enjoy this while it lasts.\n\nChe Guevara to Gandhi\n\nUnderstanding Mohesen Makhmalbaf\n\nThe first Mohesen Makhmalbaf film I saw was 'A Moment of Innocence' and it has stayed with me till today as my favorite film and Mohesen Makhmalbaf has become the film maker I admire most. Finally in July 2004 I got an opportunity to meet and talk to him and his family when they were in Delhi to present the works of Makhmalbaf Family for the Cinefan Film Festival. This is a compilation of many thoughts Mohesen Makhmalbaf shared in our conversation about his journey from an activist to a film maker, about his distinctive film making style, about media, education, politics and his going back from a film maker to activist which is a journey he takes very often. Makhmalbaf talks:\n\n1. Activist to Filmmaker:\n\nI was born to parents who were married only for six days. I was created in those six days and then my father left my mother. But they both were fighting over my custody. Finally my father kidnapped me and I was kept as a virtual prisoner in his house for almost one and a half years. But the positive side to it was my aunt decided to take up the task of educating me; she would borrow all kinds of books from the neighbors for me. So at a very young age, I got to read a lot of literature, fiction, religious books etc., Looking back, I think that is the reason why I became a writer later on; I have written about 30 books till today. I didn't go to university or I didn't even finish my high school because of the bad financial situation at home. Instead I started working since the age of 12. I did almost 13 different jobs from working in the bazaar, in magazines and so on.\n\nAround that time, I got interested in politics and became a political activist after seeing so much of life and conditions in my country. Influenced by the ideals of Che Guevara, my friends and I wanted to change the system and bring in the revolution. In one such activity, I decided to attack a police man and while disarming him, I ended up stabbing him. Luckily the injury was not fatal. But I ended up in jail. Later on I made 'A Moment of Innocence' which is based on this incident and my reflections on the same at a later age. I was 17 when I went to jail. I was imprisoned for about 5 years and I spent those years thinking about many issues concerning my society and the way in which we where trying to change the system. Slowly I realised that with all due respects to Che Guevara, I found Gandhi a bigger person and non violence seemed a better way to bring about the change I was seeking in my society.\n\nWhen I came out of the prison I changed my position from political to cultural. I believed and still believe that the problems of Iranian society are not political and can't be solved by a change in government or a change in policy. The problems are cultural and can only be solved by changing something in peoples' minds, in their way of thinking. The Iranian society believes there is only one way of life, one language, one power and one truth. This belief leads to fascism. So when I came out of prison I started writing stories, novels, articles and later on started making films. Then came the revolution and many of my friends who were in prison with me became Presidents and Prime ministers. My friends created the revolution and I created Samira. I was 23 when Samira was born and I stayed focused on my work in the cultural area.\n\n2. Making mirrors not windows:\n\nI have made 16 feature films and 6 short films. Apart from their social and cultural impact it, it helped to develop a new style of cinema in Iran. With my work and the work done by other good Iranian film makers we could create a new version of Iranian cinema, which is accepted and appreciated all over the world today. The reason for this is because we found our own way of expression which is very different from Hollywood and Bollywood. Hollywood for me is like a factory, an industry where most of the films are same in content and style. There are very few new things happening in Hollywood cinema; for them it is business not art and nothing to do with the culture of their society. We tried to be more close to the real Iranian culture; for me our kind of cinema is something like a 'mirror'. A mirror that we hold in front of the soul of people, so that they can look at themselves. When you look at yourself in the mirror you may want to change something in yourself. Or one can check the truth of what one sees in this mirror. Is it really my self or is it the image I had about myself? And if you find that something is missing you can change yourself.\n\nTo me Satyajit Ray is a mirror in Indian cinema. He put a mirror in front of the soul of India in the Trilogy, but in Bollywood I can't find the real Indian soul. Same with Hollywood. If you travel inside of USA you will see a very different kind of life, but in their cinema most of the time people are killing each other. We are sitting here talking and life goes on around us and outside, but when you see a Bollywood cinema most of the time people are dancing and fighting. It has nothing to do with the real life, this is not a mirror in front of people. Maybe Hollywood and Bollywood are something like a 'window', a window for people to find another world to merely enjoy and a business for the people who make them. Please India; Stop Bollywood!\n\nFor me and my family, film making is a cultural, political and humanist activity. It is not a business. Last year Samira was in India and she won a prize at IFFI and she got 12,000 dollars. She didn't want to take that money with her. The poor children of India have more need for that money than Samira so she donated that money in India. An artist doesn't need lots of money or fame; rather an artist needs a heart, feelings and honesty.\n\n3. Creating fiction from reality:\n\nOur way of film making is very open in nature. Many times we work without a complete script. When you have a complete script it means you have a question and an answer. But if you have only an outline it is something like finding the answer for your question. And we let the wind blow into our script, then you see the reality coming in by itself in the script. Even when we choose our actors, we don't go around looking for someone we created sitting in our house. We find characters and allow them to bring in their life and their experiences into the film. Some times it is their own dialogues and reactions that they use in the film. This is to get something that is as close to reality, which is very integral to the kind of work we do. Many times the main character in our films doesn't even know the story till we finish shooting the film. They discover the story day by day and they grow along with the story. If they know everything from the beginning their performance becomes artificial.\n\nAnd our camera work too is very close to reality. It is like looking through eyes, many people mistake our films for documentaries. But no! Every thing is planned and created, but created from the reality around us. So maybe our films are something between documentary and fiction. Like the Italian Neo Realist films which are very close to the day to day life. Forget about sets, make up, lighting and all the things the industry imposes upon us to use. This is one kind of cinema, our kind of cinema, but not the only kind or the manifesto of cinema. There should be all kinds, it is not good for the world if there is only one kind of cinema and film festivals are the democratic place to see different views on cinema.\n\n4. Teaching to believe in oneself:\n\nSamira was in school and she was frustrated by the education they give in Iranian schools. Every thing is religion, language is religion, geography is religion, science is religion, mathematics is religion and so on. Samira was sick of that kind of education and a few times she even tried to kill herself. I got scared and asked her to quit studies and she told me that she wanted to make films. That is the time I approached Iranian Government with the proposal to start a film school which could provide film education for 1000 children but the Government refused my proposal. So we started a small private film school at home.\n\nWe called it the Makhmalbaf Film House and there is a little story behind the name. This was the time when I had finished my film 'A Moment of Innocence' and the Government demanded a lots of cuts in the film if we wanted to show the film in theaters. Unfortunately my producer was willing to accept those cuts because he had invested lots of money in the film. But I was not willing to accept. I told him that I will give him the money and buy the film from him. So I called my wife Marziyeh, Samira, Mysam and Hana and told them - we have two ways before us. One - keep the film and sell the house. Second - keep the house and give up the film for censorship. Every one voted for keeping the film so we sold our house and used that money to get the film back. We kept just a name instead of the house -Makhmalbaf Film House and there was no physical space, only the name. Most of the students were from family. My wife, Samira, Mysam, Hana and few friends. Our school was not a conventional film school. People learnt cooking, swimming, traveling and all kinds of things apart from film making. In the true sense I have given them only one thing - which is the ability to believe in themselves. In conventional education we kill the self confidence in children, because we keep on repeating and repeating every thing that someone has found before us. Why we are in this world if we have to follow things which have been found before? I believe If you can have some kind of an education which will teach you to believe in yourself, then miracles will happen.\n\n5. Staying rooted in the storm:\n\nI don't make films to give people a message nor even to show them reality. I want to show different perspectives of reality because I believe there is nothing like truth. Truth is not just one-sided, there may be another side to the truth. I try to show my audience a different side of truth so they can become more democratic-minded. There is a saying in Iran, Truth is a mirror in the hands of God, broken. And all of us have got a piece of it. We think what we have in our hand is the truth. No! Every one has a piece of truth. May be you can say I prefer this piece which I have in my hand, but you can't say that is the only truth. When you think there is only one truth, there is no democracy, no conversation. To me cinema is a conversation.\n\nIn this century one of the most important issues we face will be the influence of satellite television. They let us know things which they think we should know and they don't let us see things which they don't want us to think about. They didn't want us to know about Afghanistan before September 11. After September 11 they told us to pay attention to Afghanistan. But after one year they told us to stop, now it is time for you to see Iraq, now after some time they will tell us stop, we will show you another truth. The Afghan women are under the Burkha of Islam, and we are under the Burkha of CNN and BBC. We have to cut it open and come out of it. One way to come out of the satellite influence is through pure cinema because cinema provides the other side of truth, and make us capable of thinking for ourselves without any influence of media which is in the hands of power. We have to start thinking freely for a better world.\n\nIt is not easy. The wind is too strong in these times in which we are living. It is blowing from all sides, but if we think for ourselves, if we think deeply, we will become rooted and will be able to stand on our own feet. So that no wind can take us away.\n\n6. Filmmaker to Activist:\n\nBut while making films in the past 30 years I understood that making a film is not enough and it is not the only thing. For instance if you are making a film about poor people then you cannot forget them and move on to the next film. You will have to make an effort to change a few things for them socially and politically too. During the time of Taliban, two years before September 11, I made a secret trip to Herat City in Afghanistan. I was shocked to see more than 20,000 people dying by the road sides because of hunger and suffering. I decided to inform this situation to the world. If you see Khandahar you will know it is not merely a film. It is sharing of lots of information about a country that is forgotten. I wrote a book 'The Buddha was not Demolished in Afghanistan.' It collapsed out of Shame.' I carried copies of the book when I went to Cannes Film Festival. I gave it to lots of journalists who wanted to talk to me about film making. I gave about 300 interviews and after I finished each interview I gave them the book and told them - here is a country which has been forgotten by the world, please write about it, write about the sufferings of Afghan people. But many of the journalists didn't understand, some didn't even believe something like that can happen in this world. After 3 months, September 11 happened and suddenly there was lots of attention on Afghanistan. All satellite channels were full of Afghanistan, but most of the time it was only talk.\n\nI used the post September11 atmosphere to change some things for the Afghan people. First I made the documentary 'Afghan Alphabet' about the Afghan refugee children in Iran who were not allowed to go to school because they don't have a visa or enough legal documents. 700,000 children couldn't go to school for the past 8 years because of the Iranian law. To me this was the same thing as Taliban rule in Afghanistan. I had continuous talks with Iranian Government for about 3 months and also the film was shown widely in Iran and rest of the world. Finally I could make the Iranian Government change the law and last year 500,000 Afghan children went to school in Iran. Same with Afghanistan. 98% of women and 80% men couldn't go to school in Afghanistan during Taliban time. So for 3 years I stopped film making and worked on something like 80 projects for Afghan children's education, setting up schools, finding teachers, etc. I used all my resources and all the money I got as awards. For me this was better than making a film.\n\nAn invitation to observe.\n\n1. Five: Titled as “Five Long Takes Dedicated to Yasujiro Ozu,” the film consist of five 15 to 20 minutes episodes with a short piece of music in between them. The episodes are unedited (apart from the last one) single takes with a fixed frame of a digital camera. Shot on the shores of the Caspian Sea in northern Iran, where Kiarostami originally went to write a screenplay for another film.\n\nA little piece of wood being tossed by the waves; people taking a morning walk on the beach; a playful group of dogs on the beach; a group of noisy ducks walking from one side to other; a reflection of the moon in a pond accompanied with music created by a chorus of frogs. As it has been established here, Five is not a film which can be explained; it has to be experienced. In my opinion, a very rewarding experience.\n\n2. It is a Kiarostami film: I have seen Five in a festival screening along with few of my friends. These friends of mine have seen many Kiarostmi films including Taste of Cherry, Close-up and Wind will Carry Us and they loved those films a lot (they hadn't seen Ten at that point of time). They were as much excited about seeing the latest Kiarostami film as I was. But after seeing Five they came out completely disappointed or rather angry.\n\nEven though we saw many other films that day apart from Five, when we met up in the evening for dinner Five came up for discussion again. My three friends wrote off the film unanimously and later the discussion progressed on to questioning the credibility of Kiarostami as a filmmaker. I was the only one for the film, because I strongly believe that a film like Five has to be seen in the context of the film maker's journey. With almost 20 films to his credit and number of masterpieces, he has contributed to the world cinema. We the audience are now responsible to look at a Kiarostami film in the context of his artistic growth. It will be unfair to separate the film from the filmmaker and appreciate it or reject it.\n\nTen years back just before Kiarostami made 'Taste of Cherry' he was going through serious personal trauma and was faced with questions of choosing life or death. That experience was followed by the making of the film 'Taste of Cherry', which is about a man who is looking for someone to help him commit suicide. Over the later ten years, Kiarostami has changed a lot, so have his films. And it will be cruel to insist that Kiarostami should continue to make films like what he made ten years back because we the audience loved those old films.\n\nTo me Five is a continuation of the journey Kiarostami started with 'ABC Africa', and followed with 'Ten' and explained in 'Ten on Ten'.\n\n3. One word film: Just to refresh the memory, let me repeat this incident - In one of the screenings of 'Ten' in a film school, some film students told Kiarostami, \"Just because you are a famous director, you can get away with something like this. If we do it, no one will tolerate some thing so simple!\" In reply, Kiarostami narrates Kundera's story: Kundera relates how his father's vocabulary diminished with age and, at the end of his life, was reduced to two words: \"It's strange! It's strange!\" Of course, he hadn't reached that point because he had nothing much to say anymore but because those two words effectively summed up his life's experience.\n\nAt the end of that conversation, Kiarostami said: \"Ten is my own 'two words'. It resumes almost everything. I say 'almost' because I'm already thinking about my next film. A one-word film perhaps.\"\n\nThe next film he made was 'Five'. If 'Ten' was made with just two camera angles, in 'Five' Kiarostami further reduced the point of view to one. If 'Ten' had 10 edited episodes, 'Five' consist of 5 long single takes. If 'Ten' had few actors, then 'Five' had none. And most importantly, if 'Ten' was an effort to make a film without the presence and direct involvement of a director, in 'Five' the director gives up his complete control and becomes just a spectator.\n\n4. End of Cinema: Ever since the making of Ten or may be even before that, many digital films have sprouted all over the world. A digital film revolution has been predicted by many including Kiarostami. But the trouble was most of the people who went in for digital medium, chose it as a cheaper alternative for the 35mm film they always wanted to make, but couldn't find a financer. As it should be, they were disappointed with the out come, because the image 'quality' of these digital films were much inferior to the celluloid one.\n\nAs a result most of the discussions going on today about digital filmmaking tend to revolve around the 'resolution' and 'economics' rather than what this new medium can offer to a filmmaker or a possibility of a new kind of cinema. Many purists of celluloid cinema refuse to even call it 'cinema', and the digital evangelists are happy with the slogan that 'now any one can make a film.' But none have discussed or are even aware of the enormous artistic possibilities digital filmmaking offers.\n\nWhen every one was trying hard to achieve 35mm quality through digital filmmaking, Kiarostami made digital films which 35mm can never ever achieve. First in 'Ten' and now with 'Five'; which demonstrate it more than any other film. 'Five' liberates itself from the elements of conventional cinema like quality of images, composition, angles, camera movements, acting, editing and esentially the trump card of all directors-the mise en scène. What Jean-Luc Godard famously said seven years back makes more sense now: \"Cinema begins with DW Griffith and ends with Abbas Kiarostami.\"\n\nBy making 'Five', Kiarostami in a way declared the insignificance of these conventional elements in his cinema. Like it is said in a Zen poem 'It is not the clay the potter throws, which gives the pot its usefulness, but the space within the shape'.Thus with 'Five', Kiarostami replaces all these so called 'critical' elements which he removed from cinema with something very essential not only to filmmaking but to life itself -'observation'.\n\n5. An invitation to observe : 'Five' is a film made by observation and it is about observation and it demands observation. In these five single takes many interesting things happen on the frame without any form of manipulation from the director. He and his camera just take on the role of an observer who is willing to spend time. The film also provides an opportunity for the audience to do the same. There is enough time given within the film for observation and contemplation. Quite unlike the earlier Kiarostami films which are open ended and leave the audience with a lot of unresolved questions and encourage them to keep on going back to the film seeking answers. In 'Five' it is more of the experience of that moment in which one watching the film becomes more critical. As Kiarostami put it \"It is an invitation to observe things which, in oneself, are not particularly worthy to be looked at. It is a means of stopping and of concentrating.\"\n\nBut while the film engages itself in observing the nature around; the camera which facilitates this observation doesn't move around to catch any action. Action falls inside the static frame set by the filmmaker. For example the drifting wood in the first episode breaks into two pieces precisely when we are looking for some thing 'dramatic' to happen in the frame. In another incident in the fourth episode when all the ducks are walking in one direction, suddenly one of them stops in the middle of the frame, turns and starts walking back and the other ducks start to follow. To me this is the most interesting and magical quality about the film; nothing is scripted, created or manipulated. All the events just happen in front of a fixed frame of a rolling camera. Did nature play out this drama in front of Kiarostami's camera? or was he lucky enough to be there to record it when it was happening? Or do these things happen all the time if one is really willing to observe?\n\n\" It is as if I recited a poem which had already been written. All already exists, it is there to be seen, included and understood. I simply observed it. It let me escape from the obligation of narration and of the slavery of mise en scène.”\n\n- Abbas Kiarostami.\n\nTen: It is the journey\n\n1. The story: Ten is the story of Akbari, a divorcee and her relationship with her son Amin. She drives her car around the city and talks to her son who refuses to listen to her point of view. Apart from her son, a couple of other women take lifts in her car; each one has her own problems and views to share. After the 10th conversation the film ends exactly how it started.\n\n2. The Subject: The condition of women in Islamic societies has been an important subject to many Iranian filmmakers. Samira and Mohsen Makmalbaf, Jafar Panahi and Majid Majidi have all made very powerful films on this subject. The Asian and the western audience saw these issues as only an Islamic society's problems. But significantly Kiarostami's Ten takes out the Islamic reference from the issue and makes it a larger universal film about the man-woman relations and its politics. When we see the film it is not so hard to imagine it as a story of a woman in India.\n\n3. Outspoken Kiarostami: Ten in my opinion is the most outspoken film Kiarostami has ever made. Unlike the usual, very subtle Kiarostami film, Ten addresses the issues in a one to one fashion. Marriage, divorce, love, sex, prostitution, God, freedom, prejudices, choices etc. have been discussed with great detail in a very direct approach. And the sides Kiarostami takes are obvious and self-explanatory, so I find no need to write about those aspects of film. On the other hand I will try and put down some thoughts on his method of filmmaking. Having said that, in a Kiarostami film it is hard or impossible to separate the technique from the content. And that quality is what elevates this film to a level, which no other film in the recent past been able to reach.\n\n4. Digital film: Ten can be seen as a manifesto piece for digital film making. If we try to understand the development in Kiarostami's film making process over the years, it looks like digital film making technology has been developed for him. Or at least it came in at the right time. It is not a coincidence; it is an inevitable union of vision and technology. Ten comprises all the qualities digital filmmaking can offer. The almost invisible quality of the camera, not almost but the complete absence of the camera man, lights, crew, etc. which make the actors in front of the camera more comfortable, and help them being themselves. Which is what Kiarostami has always been searching for - people being themselves. And slowly for Kiarostami film making has become close to painting, just the artist and his work of art. But in the case of Ten it has taken a further leap. Even the artist is not present; it is just the work of art developing by itself.\n\n5. A film without director: Kiarostami makes a very significant statement in this film by not putting his name as the director. His name appears in the beginning as the co-producer of the film along with Marin Karmitz and at the end of the film as part of the cast list. In his earlier films, Kiarostami has always tried to provide a great sense of reality by not using professional actors, using documentary footage, people playing themselves and so on. In Ten, he goes one step ahead by declaring the absence of 'the director' himself. There is no one looking through the camera and correcting the actors or prompting them. The actors sit in a car and it moves, they talk and the camera records all that happens. I remember reading in an interview in which Kiarostami said, I am not the creator of the film but if I didn't exist this film wouldn't have happened.\n\n6. Countdown: This looked bit out of place to me. Not as subtle and dignified as the usual Kiarostami motif that he uses to keep reminding the audience that they are watching a film. (The last video sequence in the Taste of Cherry and the reference to camera in Close-Up etc.) And I hope the interpretation of it is not something like the real film/story begins after the count down - that is after the end of the film. I would be a little disappointed if a master like Kiarostami did use such an obvious device. My understanding about this is that at the end of a countdown we expect some thing dramatic to happen, or may be a beginning of something. But the film ends at the place, which is almost where it started, leaving the issues unresolved for the mother and her son and their relationship. Like the completion of a full circle and you are back to where you started, the count down device helps reinforce this fact.\n\n7. The cast: The acting of the boy and few others sit in the car amazed me. I was even more amazed when I read recently that the women who played the mother Akbari is in real life an actress by profession but a divorcee and the boy who played Amin (the son) is her own son named Amin. Now Kiarostami again surprises us with the unique space he creates which is in between reality and fiction. Was Amir talking to his own mother in an off screen real life about what he felt about his parents separation? Or was he just acting on Kiarostami's brief? If it is real what happened to them at the end of the film? What did he feel about all this?\n\n8. Two words: In one of the screenings of Ten in a film school some film students told Kiarostami, \"Just because you are a famous director, you can get away with something like this. If we do it no one will tolerate some thing so simple!\" In reply, Kiarostami narrates Kundera's story: Kundera relates how his father's vocabulary diminished with age and, at the end of his life, was reduced to two words: \"It's strange! It's strange!\" Of course, he hadn't reached that point because he had nothing much to say anymore but because those two words effectively summed up his life's experience. When we look Ten carefully the issues the film deals with are so complex that only a person like Kiarostami who has a great vision and experience can sum it up in two words.\n\n9. The Moving car: A moving car is an important element in any Kiarostami film, in other words all his films are part of a journey. In Ten there is no reference of the beginning or end of this journey it is always captured in the middle of the journey. It is not important to Kiarostami where you started and where you reach. It is the journey that is most important to him, not the destination. In another level this helps to explain the ending of the film. At the end it looks like nothing is resolved, the woman didn't even drive her car in to the horizon to depict her freedom, which could be a typically positive ending. But things end exactly where they started like an unhappy ending. True, in appearance everything remains the same to every one. But not the same in meaning…at least for her, and for a sensitive audience too. This change in meaning is what makes us capable of dealing with this world, and makes the journey worthwhile. I was reminded of the Zen saying -\"Before enlightenment I chopped wood and carried water, after enlightenment I chopped wood and carried water.\"\n\n10. The Story: Ten is the story of Akbari, a divorcee and her relationship with her son Amin. She drives her car around the city and talks to her son who refuses to listen to her point of view. Apart from her son, a couple of other women take lifts in her car; each one has her own problems and views to share. After the 10th conversation the film ends exactly how it started."
