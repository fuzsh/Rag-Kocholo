Directed and produced by Bert Haanstra, Glass is the 10-minute short film from the Netherlands which took home the 1959 Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. The film is a study in contrast between the meticulous handmade crystal made in the Royal Leerdam Glass Factory, and the automated glass bottle making machines of the time.
