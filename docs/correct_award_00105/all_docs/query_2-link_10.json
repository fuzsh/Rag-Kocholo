        "text": "Mr. Naipaul, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001, wrote about the liberation movements that swept across Africa and the Caribbean, where he was born.\n\nThe New York Times writes:\n\nMr. Naipaul personified a sense of displacement. Having left behind the circumscribed world of Trinidad, he was never entirely rooted in England. In awarding him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001, the Swedish Academy described him as “a literary circumnavigator, only ever really at home in himself, in his inimitable voice.\n\nV. S. Naipaul was the Nobel Prize–winning author of more than twenty books of fiction and nonfiction. He received numerous honors including the Man Booker Prize for In a Free State in 1971 and a knighthood for services to literature in 1990.\n\nRead the rest of the NYT tribute below.\n\nWatch V.S. Naipaul present his 2 minute speech at the Nobel Banquet, December 10, 2001."
