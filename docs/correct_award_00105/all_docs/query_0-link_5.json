        "text": "Award\n\n2001 Nobel Prize in LiteratureVidiadhar Surajprasad NaipaulDate\n\n11 October 2001 ( ) (announcement)\n\n10 December 2001\n\n(ceremony)\n\nLocationStockholm, SwedenPresented bySwedish AcademyFirst awarded1901WebsiteOfficial website\n\n← 2000 · Nobel Prize in Literature · 2002 →\n\nThe 2001 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the Trinidadian-born British writer Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul (1932–2018), commonly known as V. S. Naipaul, \"for having united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories.\"[1][2] The Committee added: \"Naipaul is a modern philosopher carrying on the tradition that started originally with Lettres persanes and Candide. In a vigilant style, which has been deservedly admired, he transforms rage into precision and allows events to speak with their own inherent irony.\"[3] The Committee also noted Naipaul's affinity with the novelist Joseph Conrad:\n\nNaipaul is Conrad's heir as the annalist of the destinies of empires in the moral sense: what they do to human beings. His authority as a narrator is grounded in the memory of what others have forgotten, the history of the vanquished.[3]\n\nLaureate[edit]\n\nMain article: V. S. Naipaul\n\nIn the heart of many V.S. Naipaul's works, colonialism and post-colonial society are the main settings, and the key themes are alienation and identity in a heterogeneous society. When A House for Mr Biswas was released in 1961, it was an enormous hit and Naipaul's big break on the world stage. His other well-known literary prose include A Flag on the Island (1967), The Mimic Men (1967), In a Free State (1971), Guerrillas (1974).[4][5]\n\nDeliberations[edit]\n\nV. S. Naipaul had been considered by the Nobel committee for many years. He was nominated in 1973 by committee member Artur Lundkvist,[6] and according to another member, Anders Österling, Naipaul was one of the main contenders for the prize the following year.[7]\n\nReactions[edit]\n\nThe choice of V.S. Naipaul caused mixed reactions. In the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet professor Sture Linnér praised Naipaul's writing: \"He is one of the greatest, not just in our generation but on the whole in modern literature.\" In the same newspaper, critic Mats Gellerfelt heavily criticised the Swedish Academy's decision to award Naipaul. Gellerfelt argued that Naipaul had his best time as a writer long behind him, a \"postcolonial literature's favourite grandad\", and pointed out three superior candidates for the prize: \"In the art of writing novels there are today giants such as Antonio Lobo Antunes, Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes, perhaps the three most prominent novelists alive and still remarkably active and productive, right in the middle of a creativity booming with vigour.\"[8]\n\nNobel lecture[edit]\n\nV. S. Naipaul delivered his Nobel Lecture entitled Two Worlds at the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on 7 December 2001.[9]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
