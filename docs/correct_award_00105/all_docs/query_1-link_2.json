        "text": "Sir Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 2001\n\nResidence at the time of the award: United Kingdom\n\nPrize motivation: “for having united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories”\n\nLanguage: English\n\nPrize share: 1/1\n\nLife\n\nBritish author V.S. Naipaul was born in Trinidad, with family roots in India. At the age of 18, he left Trinidad for studies in the United Kingdom, where he ended up staying. Naipaul made his debut with the novel The Mysterious Masseur in 1957. Naipaul has devoted much of his life to travel in different places in the world, which has come to be reflected in his novels as well as his travel writing and reportage.\n\nWork\n\nAt the core of many of V.S. Naipaul’s novels is colonialism and post-colonial society, where identity and alienation in a multicultural world are central themes. The novel A House for Mr. Biswas became a great success when it was published in 1961, and it also became Naipaul’s international breakthrough."
