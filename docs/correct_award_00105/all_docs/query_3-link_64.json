Naipaul, the Trinidad-born Nobel laureate whose precise and lyrical writing in such novels as \"A Bend in the River\" and \"A House for Mr. Biswas\" and brittle, misanthropic personality made him one of the world's most admired and contentious writers, died Saturday at his London home, his family said. He was 85.\n\nHis wife, Nadira Naipaul, said he was \"a giant in all that he achieved and he died surrounded by those he loved having lived a life which was full of wonderful creativity and endeavor.\"\n\nHis friend and fellow author Paul Theroux said that he had been in poor health, but had taken pride in having his work recognized."
