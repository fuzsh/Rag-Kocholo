        "text": "Famous Indian author VS Naipaul passed away on Saturday at the age of 85.\n\n\"He was a giant in all that he achieved and he died surrounded by those he loved having lived a life which was full of wonderful creativity and endeavour,\" his wife Lady Naipaul said in a statement, as per PTI.\n\nVS Naipaul was born on August 17, 1932 in Trinidad. He was awarded the Booker Prize in the year 1971 and Nobel Prize in Literature in the year 2001.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSome of his most famous books are A House for Mr Biswas, An Area of Darkness -- which is an account of Naipaul's trip through India in the early 1960s -- Miguel Street, India: A Million Mutinies Now, The Middle Passage and The Overcrowded Barracoon.\n\nHere are some facts you shouldn't miss about the Nobel Prize winner, VS Naipaul:\n\nV S Naipaul was born as Sir Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul\n\nIn his early attempts at writing at Oxford, Naipaul used to feel that his writings were very artificial\n\nHe used to become very depressed thinking he did not have an ability to write\n\nWhen he was only 20 years old, he took a spontaneous trip to Spain, where he quickly spent all the money he had saved\n\nHe called his trip to Spain \"a nervous breakdown\" and later called it \"something like a mental illness\"\n\nWhen Naipaul's father died in the year 1953, he worked odd jobs and borrowed money from his wife Patricia to support himself\n\nNaipaul moved to London in 1954. In December that year, Henry Swanzy, the producer of a BBC weekly programme called Caribbean Voices, hired Naipaul as a presenter\n\nHe used to write short reviews and conduct interviews at BBC. He worked for Caribbean Voices for four years\n\nHis famous character 'Bogart', who played a part in the first story of Miguel Street, was inspired by a neighbour he knew as a child in the Port of Spain\n\nAfter he wrote his first story, Naipaul completed the whole of Miguel Street in five weeks\n\nIn the year 1964, Naipaul was also asked to write a script for an American movie. The novella was called A Flag on the Island, which was later published but since the director did not like it, the movie was never made\n\nHe was knighted in 1989\n\nThe Mystic Masseur (2001) movie was based on his book by the same name published in 1957\n\nHe won major recognition with his fourth novel, A House for Mr Biswas.\n\n(Main image courtesy:alchetron.com)\n\nInterested in General Knowledge and Current Affairs?
