His authority as a narrator is grounded in his memory of what others have forgotten, the history of the vanquished.\"\n\nNaipaul's first published literary work was The Mystic Masseur, which was quickly followed by a collection of short stories - Miguel Street.\n\nThe release said his first two books 'established Naipaul as a humorist and a portrayer of street life'.\n\nHis most famous book, at least for the Indian audience, A House for Mr Biswas followed, putting him on the fast track to literary greatness.\n\nThe press release described the book thus: \"One of those singular novels that seem to constitute their own complete universes, in this case a miniature India on the periphery of the British Empire, the scene of his father's circumscribed existence.\"\n\nAbout his masterpiece, The Enigma of Arrival, the release said, \"Naipaul visits the reality of England like an anthropologist studying some hitherto unexplored native tribe deep in the jungle. With apparently short-sighted and random observations he creates an unrelenting image of the placid collapse of the old colonial ruling culture and the demise of European neighbourhoods.\"\n\nV S Naipaul has been awarded a number of literary prizes, among them the Booker Prize in 1971 and the T S Eliot Award for Creative Writing in 1986.\n\nHe is an honorary doctor of St Andrew's College and Columbia University and of the Universities of Cambridge, London and Oxford.\n\nIn 1990, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth.\n\nSome of the selected works of V S Naipaul:\n\nThe Mystic Masseur.
