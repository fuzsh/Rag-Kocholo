        "text": "Sir Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul was born in Chagunas, Trinidad on 17 August 1927 and he died in London on 11 August 2018, leaving behind a rich, vibrant and challenging legacy of fiction and non-fiction. His novels, for example A House for Mr Biswas and A Bend in the River, have been recognised as great literature. His non-fiction, for example A Million Mutinies Now and Beyond Belief, is controversial and has managed to upset Muslims, Africans, Caribbeans and women. He was a much garlanded writer, winning the Booker Prize in 1971, receiving a knighthood in England in 1990, and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2001. John Mair, Richard Keeble and Farrukh Dhondy have edited a collection of new and previously published articles and contributions about V.S. Naipaul and his legacy. Written by some great scholars, friends, journalists, and enemies, reflecting on his legacy, this book is a timely appreciation of the man, his work and his times."
