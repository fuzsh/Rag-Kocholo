        "text": "Sir V.S. Naipaul, who with elegant, uncompromising calm has critiqued the ideals of everything from Islam to postcolonial life, won the Nobel Prize in literature Thursday.\"I thought I was no longer in the running, you know? I thought I had fallen away,\" the 69-year-old novelist and essayist said in an interview from his home in Wiltshire, England.Naipaul, long rumored as a Nobel candidate, is the first writer of Indian descent to win since Rabindranath Tagore in 1913. He said receiving the prize was a \"tribute both to India, my ancestors\\' land, and to other countries in the subcontinent.\"Best known for the novels A Bend in the River and A House for Mr. Biswas, Naipaul was born in Trinidad and moved to England to study at Oxford. He used the West Indian island as his first subject and then extended his writings to include India, Africa, North America and the Islamic communities of Asia.British author Martin Amis said Thursday he was delighted by Naipaul\\'s win.\"His level of perception is of the highest, and his prose has become the perfect instrument for realizing those perceptions on the page,\" Amis said, adding that Naipaul\\'s travel writing \"is perhaps the most important body of work of its kind in the second half of the century.\"The Nobel literature prize, first awarded to French author Sully Prudhomme in 1901, is worth $943,000 in this centennial year.The academy cited Naipaul for his \"incorruptible scrutiny\" of postcolonial society and his critical assessments of Muslim fundamentalism. Academy head Horace Engdahl conceded this year\\'s choice might be seen as political in the wake of terrorist attacks in the United States and the American retaliation.\"What he\\'s really attacking in Islam is a particular trait that it has in common with all cultures that conquerors bring along &#151; that it tends to obliterate the preceding culture,\" Engdahl said.At a reading in London last week, Naipaul condemned what he called the \"calamitous effect\" of Islam and compared it to colonialism.\"To be converted, you have to destroy your past, destroy your history. You have to stamp on it, you have to say, \\'My ancestral culture does not exist, it doesn\\'t matter,\\'\" he said.Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul has the reputation for being a tough-minded, misanthropic man with no use for such literary rituals as publishing parties and flattering blurbs for his peers. In Sir Vidia\\'s Shadow, a highly unflattering book published in 1998, former friend Paul Theroux wrote that \"he elevated crankishness as the proof of his artistic temperament.\"Asked by the Associated Press how he would celebrate winning the Nobel, Naipaul replied: \"I don\\'t have the talent for celebrating. Maybe I\\'ll just stop worrying for a day or two.\"Naipaul has been in the news lately, and not just because of his comments about Islam. In a recent interview, he mocked E.M. Forster, author of A Passage to India and other novels. \"He just knew the court and a few middle-class Indians and a few garden boys whom he wished to seduce,\" Naipaul told the Literary Review. He also took on James Joyce\\'s Ulysses, saying that \"Joyce was going blind and I can\\'t understand the work of a blind writer.\"Like Joyce, Ireland\\'s famous exile, Naipaul has an uneasy relationship with his native country. As a student at Oxford, he wrote to his family: \"I shall die if I had to spend the rest of my life in Trinidad.\" Referring to the English, he vowed \"to beat them at their own language.\"\"We honor and respect Naipaul and we are proud of his achievements no matter how much we grumble about some of his pronouncements that Trinidad is primitive and uncivilized,\" said Ken Ramkhand, a professor of literature at the University of the West Indies. \"The ordinary Trinidadian is always proud of his heroes. Naipaul is a hero.\"This year\\'s Nobels started Monday with the naming of medicine prize winners, followed by the physics award on Tuesday and chemistry and economics on Wednesday.The peace prize is to be announced today in Oslo, Norway."
