        "text": "(1932–2018). The novels of V.S. Naipaul are about individuals in developing countries who are seeking an identity and trying to make sense of their lives. His nonfiction works follow a similar theme, dealing with postcolonial societies that are in conflict, searching for a future that is altogether uncertain—and often sinking into violence and repression. Throughout his works, one finds an unflinching portrayal of the problems wrought by imperialism and the shattering effect these have on everyday people. Naipaul was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1990 and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2001.\n\nVidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul was born in Caguanas, Trinidad, on August 17, 1932. He attended school in Port of Spain and then went to England in 1950 to study at Oxford University. After graduation he settled in London, where he worked at a variety of jobs before gaining success as a writer. His first work, The Mystic Masseur, was published in 1957 and established his gift for portraying street life. His next efforts, such as The Suffrage of Elvira (1958) and Miguel Street (1959), were similar in their ironic accounts of life in the Caribbean region.\n\nIn his next novel, A House for Mr. Biswas (1961), he used his father’s experiences in Trinidad to portray a Brahmin Indian living halfway around the world from home. Naipaul won Britain’s Booker Prize for In a Free State (1971), a book of three stories set in different countries. Subsequent novels include A Bend in the River (1979), Finding the Center (1984), and The Enigma of Arrival (1987). The latter work, considered by some to be his masterpiece, is somewhat autobiographical in its portrayal of a writer from the Caribbean who travels to the countryside of England. Later fiction included A Way in the World (1994) and Half a Life (2001), a novel about an Indian immigrant to England and then Africa. This immigrant becomes “half a person,” as Naipaul has said, “living a borrowed life.” Naipaul published Magic Seeds, a sequel to Half a Life, in 2004.\n\nIn his nonfiction works, Naipaul used a literary style to draw his readers into the world of his subjects. Among his nonfiction works are The Return of Eva Perón (1980), Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey (1981), India: A Million Mutinies Now (1991), Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples (1998), Reading and Writing: A Personal Account (2000), The Writer and the World (2002), Literary Occasions (2003), and The Masque of Africa (2010). Naipaul died on August 11, 2018, in London."
