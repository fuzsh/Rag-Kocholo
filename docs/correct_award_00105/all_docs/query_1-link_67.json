        "text": "The British author VS Naipaul has died at his home in London aged 85, his family said in a statement.\n\nLady Naipaul said: \"He was a giant in all that he achieved and he died surrounded by those he loved having lived a life which was full of wonderful creativity and endeavour.\"\n\nSalman Rushdie was among the literary figures who paid tribute on Saturday night with a tweet that hinted at the way Naipaul's prickly persona and unflinching prose could alienate friends and provoke admirers.\n\n\"We disagreed all our lives, about politics, about literature, and I feel as sad as if I just lost a beloved older brother,\" he wrote. \"RIP Vidia.\"\n\nVidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul was born to descendants of indentured Indians in colonial Trinidad in 1932. From there he rose to become one of the giants of Twentieth Century writing, publishing more than 30 books ranging from comic novels set in his homeland to memoir and travel writing.\n\nHe moved to Britain to study at Oxford in 1950 after winning a government scholarship to study at any Commonwealth university in the world.\n\nIt was a step on a journey that earned him a knighthood in 1990 for a career distinguished by extravagant critical praise for works such as A Bend in the River and A House for Mr Biswas.\n\nThe Swedish Academy praised him as \"a literary circumnavigator, only ever really at home in himself, in his inimitable voice\".\n\nYet his descriptions of life in the colonial world and depictions of modern rootlessness split audiences. While to many readers in Britain and the US he offered a way into reading about African or Caribbean nations, he generated hostility among people who thought he had left them behind.\n\nAs Edward Said, a former professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University, once put it, although Naipaul, in the West is seen as \"a master novelist and an important witness to the disintegration and hypocrisy of the third world, in the postcolonial world he's a marked man as a purveyor of stereotypes and disgust for the world that produced him - though that doesn't exclude people thinking he's a gifted writer.\"\n\n\"I think that consumed her. I think she had all the relapses and everything after that,\" he said in a 2001 biography.\n\n\"She suffered. It could be said that I killed her. It could be said. I feel a little bit that way.\"\n\nIn later life, he also became embroiled in a bad-tempered literary feud with Paul Theroux. Their friendship was shattered in 1996 when Naipaul offered personally-signed and dedicated copies of Theroux's books for auction.\n\nIt was ended with a handshake at the Hay Literary Festival in 2011.\n\n\"He will go down as one of the greatest writers of our time,\" Theroux told the Associated Press.\n\n\"He also never wrote falsely. He was a scourge of anyone who used a cliche or an un-thought out sentence. He was very scrupulous about his writing, very severe, too.\""
