Life

British author V.S. Naipaul was born in Trinidad, with family roots in India. At the age of 18, he left Trinidad for studies in the United Kingdom, where he ended up staying. Naipaul made his debut with the novel The Mysterious Masseur in 1957. Naipaul has devoted much of his life to travel in different places in the world, which has come to be reflected in his novels as well as his travel writing and reportage.

Work

At the core of many of V.S. Naipaul’s novels is colonialism and post-colonial society, where identity and alienation in a multicultural world are central themes. The novel A House for Mr. Biswas became a great success when it was published in 1961, and it also became Naipaul’s international breakthrough.
