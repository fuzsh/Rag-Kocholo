A bit talky at times, but look who's talking: Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney and Little Richard are among those recalling glory days, including the triumphs of the Beatles and Motown; Bob Dylan's groundbreaking exit from folk; Pink Floyd's classic 'Dark Side of the Moon' album; and the ascendance of the electric guitar, courtesy of the sounds of Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix."
