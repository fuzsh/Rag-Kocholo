[Cheers and applause] With the beautiful Little Richard from down in Macon, Georgia! I want you all know that I am the king of rock ‘n’ roll!\n\n[Cheers and applause]\n\nBig Freedia He had to stand up for hisself… because of the music industry. They just never gave him his flowers.\n\n[Now, Little Richard is seen in a brief montage of televised interviews. Contemplative instrumentals play. Text on screen: Producer, Joanna Boateng. Dearl Nelson. Director, James House. Richard: King of Rock ‘n’ Roll.]\n\nInterviewer: Would you welcome Little Richard? And here he is.\n\n[Cheers and applause]\n\nRichard: Shut up! [Laughs]\n\nInterviewer: What a life you have had.\n\nRichard: See, I was rockin’ all the time. Then my spirit start rollin’. That’s where it came from.\n\nInterviewer: You said you turned away from the “devil’s music.”\n\nRichard: What shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul? – I believe you’re the only person who ever claimed to be both the king and the queen of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\n[Now, a view of Los Angeles, California in 1985. A woman addresses Little Richard.]\n\nWoman: Richard, do you have, like, a favorite side?\n\nRichard: Yes, this is my little side. And this is my big side. I like both of them. [Laughs]\n\nRon: At that point in his life, Richard wasn’t playing rock ‘n’ roll. We were very, very close friends. I met Richard, um, in Los Angeles in the ’70s and became part of his band. We bonded.\n\nRichard: Your eyes may shine, your teeth may grit… but none of my suns you will get. [Laughs]\n\n[Continued aerial footage of Los Angeles and photos of Little Richard.]\n\nRon: Years later, I would go visit him. He was living at a hotel on Sunset Boulevard. With a spiral staircase and all of that. I’d go to the lobby and hang out, and then Richard would come down from the elevator. And there’s people in the lobby, and they’d say, “That’s Little Richard.” He’d say, “Oh, hey, baby!” And he was waving at everybody. And he would embrace people, and they would ask him to sign autographs. And he would sign autographs. So we’ll get through that. Then the driver would come. He would just want to ride.\n\n[A limousine plays a Little Richard single.]\n\n– ♪ Good golly, Miss Molly ♪\n\n♪ Sure like to ball ♪\n\n♪ Ooh, good golly, Miss Molly ♪\n\n♪ Sure like to ball ♪\n\n♪ When you’re rockin’ and a- rollin’ ♪\n\n♪ Can’t hear your mama call ♪\n\n♪ Ahh ♪\n\nRon: The conversation along the road could be about anything. We’d talk about his life, you know, the beginning of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\n– ♪ When you’re rockin’ and a-rollin’ ♪\n\nRon: When I came on the scene, there wasn’t no rock ‘n’ roll. Everybody was playing blues. You know?\n\n[Little Richard is seen in the back seat. Text on screen: #AmericanMastersPBS.]\n\nRichard: ♪ Dun-dun, dun, dun ♪\n\n♪ Dun-dun, dun, dun, dun- dun ♪\n\nThat’s — Every blues singer in the country was doing that. And I got tired of —\n\n♪ Dun-dun, dun, dun ♪\n\nYou know, I created rock ‘n’ roll. Didn’t even know what I was doing.\n\nRon: My experience with Richard was that he was always trying to tell his story. Richard, he wanted to be heard. It was because of what he’s been through. He was there in the beginning. His story is the story of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\n[Tender music plays over black and white footage of a residential street in Macon, Georgia in 1932. A sign reads: WHITE ENTRANCE.]\n\nHe was born in Georgia. Macon, I believe. He’s in the South, so, you know, there’s the Jim Crow stuff, you know, segregation. But Richard would say when he was, you know, 10 years old, he wasn’t aware of stuff like that.\n\nRichard: I’m from a little country town where you see the chickens are all over the yard. You know, it’s like a little country town. And you would hear people singing all over the neighborhood.\n\n[Black and white footage of Black individuals picking cotton. A tune is sung.]\n\nRichard: And then late at night, I would run down the street singing. Everybody wanted to kill me in the neighborhood. Um, left at the next corner. But it was really, really something. And I used to play the piano every Sunday, you know —\n\n♪ Gimme that old-time ♪\n\n♪ Talking about religion ♪\n\n♪ Gimme that old- time religion ♪\n\n♪ Religion that it used to be ♪\n\n[A cassette tape plays in a vehicle.]\n\nTyina Steptoe, Writer & Historian: One thing that always strikes me about Little Richard — when he would talk about his hometown, two of the themes that always came out were religion and music. Every Black community in the South had a church on every corner.\n\n[African Americans gather in archived church footage.]\n\nChurchgoers: ♪ You gotta be set free ♪\n\n♪ Yeaaah! ♪\n\nTyina: In those churches, you know, they would improvise. They played loudly, to be heard. People are singing with their feelings.\n\nRichard: There’s a lot of Black churches that play gospel music. You can’t tell it from rock ‘n’ roll ’cause the Black churches are so rhythmy. You go into some Black churches, they have a better band than I ever had in rock ‘n’ roll!\n\nTyina: Before there was a rock ‘n’ roll, those churches were rocking.\n\nRichard: When I was a little boy, I said, “One day, I’m gonna do that.” And so I was singing gospel music every day. I always liked women singers. I liked the way the ladies sing high. And I loved Mahalia Jackson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and the Clara Ward Singers. I’d be like —\n\n♪ Oooh ♪ You know? I wanted to be like that.\n\n[“Packing Up” by Clara Warn & The Famous Ward Singers]\n\n– ♪ Packin’ up ♪\n\n– ♪ Gettin’ ready to go ♪\n\n– ♪ Gettin’ ready to go ♪\n\n– ♪ Gettin’ ready to go ♪\n\n– ♪ Packin’ up, ooh, Lord ♪\n\n– ♪ Packin’ up, packin’ up ♪\n\n– ♪ Lord, oh, Lord ♪\n\n– ♪ Packin’ up, packin’ up ♪\n\n– ♪ Packin’ up, packin’ up ♪\n\n– ♪ Whooo- ooh! ♪\n\n– ♪ Packin’ up, packin’ up ♪\n\n– ♪ Whooo- ooh! ♪\n\n– ♪ Packin’ up, packin’ up ♪\n\n– ♪ Whoo- hoo- ooh! ♪\n\n[Ron listens to the song with headphones, then takes the headphones off.]\n\nRon: Absolutely. You can hear in that, of course, the famous “Whoo!” So even all those early on gospel songs like that went — ♪ Nuh- nuh- nuh, nuh, nuh- nuh ♪ That’s what they’re doing. And Richard took it to be — ♪ Nuh- nuh- nuh- nuh- nuh- nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh ♪ He made it rock ‘n’ roll. With the higher voice.\n\n[“True Fine Mama” by Little Richard]\n\n– ♪ Whoo, come back, baby ♪\n\n– ♪ Come back, baby ♪\n\n– ♪ Don’t leave me here ♪\n\n– ♪ Don’t leave me here ♪\n\nRichard: You could hear I took all those little things that I had from a little boy, and I just put them together and made the songs.\n\n♪ Don’t disappear ♪\n\n♪ Yes, true fine mama ♪\n\nWhen I was a boy, I knew that I was different.\n\n[Black and white footage and photos of a young family. In new footage, a young boy applies blue eyeshadow and red lipstick. Tender instrumentals play.]\n\nTyina: Richard Penniman came from a huge family. His mother eventually had a dozen children. And his family described him as being trouble.\n\nRichard: I was so flamboyant. You know, I was wearing my mother’s makeup and lipstick, everything all over me.\n\nTyina: Even as a young boy, he’s developing a style that didn’t play by the rules.\n\nRichard: I used to play house with my cousins and I wanted to be the mama, you know? The girls loved you, but the boys hated you. They’d call me “sissy,” “punk,” “freak,” “faggot.” And they used to want to fight you. And so I had my first experience with a boy. I told my mother. And she used to tell me to hush.\n\nTyina: In the 1940s, homosexuality is a crime.\n\nMan in TV footage: Most Americans are repelled by the mere notion of homosexuality. A vast majority believe that homosexuality is an illness.\n\n[Tender instrumentals become tense. Continued stills of a younger Little Richard.]\n\nRichard: My grandfather was a preacher. My daddy, he said he wanted seven boys and I was messing it up because I was gay. Right at the light. That’s it. You know, so I was always considered a bad boy.\n\nCharles Moore, Little Richard’s Valet: Back in the ’70s, sometimes on the road he would come see me in my room, and we would talk. I never forgot what he told me about his dad. When he saw his son dressed with a wig on, with makeup on, he tied him down and beat him. Beat him until he’d go unconscious. But Richard said it didn’t faze him. He did his own thing regardless of his dad. No one could tell him. He would say, “Be what you want to be.” And that — To me, I admired him. I still do admire him for that.\n\n[Little Richard’s limo arrives at a diner. He eats inside.]\n\nRichard: My daddy, he put me out. He told me I had to do what he wanted me to do or else get out, and so I didn’t do what he said, I got out.\n\nRon: He left home, but his whole life he wanted to be accepted by his dad, but his dad ended up dying before that happened. His father got in an argument with one of Richard’s friends. The guy shot him. His friend killed his dad. I can only imagine, you know, what it was like in terms of that guilt. Inside of him, there was something always fighting.\n\n[A radio station interview.]\n\nTom Schnabel: You’re listening to KCRW 89.9 FM. My name is Tom Schnabel.\n\nRoger Steffens: And I’m Roger Steffens. Welcome to KCRW, Richard.\n\nRichard: Oh, I’m so glad to be here. I’m just speechless. I just — I got to just get — ♪ Whoo! ♪\n\nRoger: ♪ Whoo! ♪\n\nTom: As well as Charles White who is the author of a brand- new book called “Richard: The Quasar of Rock.”\n\nCharles ‘Dr. Rock’ White, Biographer & Friend: When I started to write his life story, he used to say, “Dr. Rock, I’m omnisexual.” [Laughs] Because, really, he was torn — torn by it.\n\nRoger: Now, listen, do we call you “Little” or do we call you “Richard”?\n\nRichard: Oh, whatever is suitable and fitting.\n\nCharles: Sexuality was a dilemma for him. But it wouldn’t be obvious.\n\nRoger: You know, my first impression is you’re not little at all.\n\nRichard: Oh, no.\n\nRoger: I don’t mean you’re overweight, but, I mean, you are tall.\n\nRichard: Oh. Everything is big, I must admit. [Laughs]\n\nCharles: He has great — great humor and great fun.\n\n[Charles brings out a heavy bin of cassette tapes.]\n\n[Grunts] [Laughs] Alright. They’re all Little Richard. I interviewed him for the book. He always wanted to be a great musician. But, really, he wanted to be accepted.\n\n[Little Richard on cassette tape. Up-tempo music begins.]\n\nRichard: So, I left my hometown when I was 14, and that’s when it all started. I joined a show called The Broadway Follies. To me, they was the nicest people I’d ever met. I became their vocalist. And they changed my name to Little Richard.\n\nBobby Rush, Blues Musician & Friend: Little Richard came up through the Chitlin’ Circuit like I did. Let me explain Chitlin’ Circuit. At that time, all across the South, it was segregated. And so if you were Black, you had the Chitlin’ Circuit. It got its name because they always served the inside of a pig, a hog, the chitlin’, the guts. And so everybody was eating chitlins in joints like this we’re sitting in now. You know, my mama told me to leave Caldonia alone. That’s what she told me. No kidding. Louis Jordan, “Caldonia.” I sung that song every night ’cause I didn’t know no other song but that song.\n\n♪ Caldonia, Caldonia ♪\n\n♪ What make your big head so hard? ♪\n\n[Black and white stills of the Chitlin’ Circuit.]\n\nRichard: I thought I was famous then. But there wasn’t nobody screaming over me but me.\n\nBobby: I remember Little Richard and I — Oh, this story. When I came off the stage, it was his time because he was starting the show. He said, “Bobby Rush, don’t go nowhere. Stand right there.” He said, “Ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell you something about this man here.” Oh, I got my chest stuck out. I’m waiting for the glory. He said, “Myself and Bobby Rush… we are the prettiest men in the world.” [Laughs] And I did like this. I said… [Laughs] He thought he was the best- looking man in the world. You know? But one thing he had was talent.\n\n[Text on screen: #AmericanMastersPBS. Tender instrumentals play over footage of a New Orleans street.]\n\nSo, we would do the show, get up the next morning, and go to the next town. If you come to New Orleans, you play the Dew Drop, man. [Laughs] When you went to the Dew Drop, man, it was like Carnegie Hall in New York, man. You was, like, in heaven, man. It was it.\n\nDeacon John, Former Band Leader, The Dew Drop Inn: The Dew Drop Inn. Well, this was the hippest place to play in town. Little Richard came in here, and one time, I was his opening act. Richard was a really flamboyant dresser with glamorous suits and ties that he wore with the hair up, with the bouffant.\n\nRichard: It was quite popular in those days for men to wear their hair like that. So I just took it a step farther, put mine a few inches higher than everybody else. I was the only guy wearing eyelashes. I was the only man wearing makeup.\n\n[Continued stills of gatherings at The Dew Drop. Jazzy instrumentals play.]\n\nDeacon: You know, a lot of people thought he’s some wild and crazy guy. But, you know, everybody from all walks of life came into a place like the Dew Drop. We had doctors, lawyers, pimps, prostitutes, rich, poor, you know, LGBT, you name it. Even the emcee, Patsy, she was a female impersonator. And Patsy might come out in a big gown with can- can slips and said, “Good evening, darlings. Welcome to the Dew Drop.” And Patsy would lift up the evening gown and said, “Come on and get the rest.” [Laughs] It was New Orleans, man.\n\nBig Freedia, Rapper & Performer: The drag scene is definitely a thing that New Orleans has been doing for a very long time. We got the whole setup from all the older queens who came before us. Being a queer kid from New Orleans, I can relate to what Richard went through back then. When you meet people that’s just like you, it feels just fabulous. That gives you a moment to lay your hair down and be yourself. You can talk the way you want to talk. You can walk the way you want to walk. When you’re different, you’ve got to have that support, you know, a community of people that shows you the ropes.\n\nRichard: These guys, these female impersonators. I went with them, and they wanted me to dress as a woman. Instead of saying “he,” they would say “she.”\n\nTyina: He creates this Princess LaVonne character, and she would just dazzle the audiences.\n\n[Footage of an individual performing on stage.]\n\n– ♪ Ain’t that good news? ♪\n\n– ♪ Ain’t that good news? ♪\n\n– ♪ Ain’t that good news? ♪\n\n– ♪ Ain’t that good news? ♪\n\n– ♪ Ain’t that good news? ♪\n\n– ♪ Everybody’s blues crazy ♪\n\nRichard: I wore the eyelashes and the head bands, and I’d have so much mascara on, it looks like mud. [Laughs]\n\n– ♪ The blues ♪\n\nTyina: So, at this point, he’s writing blues music. He’s singing and performing R&B.\n\n– ♪ Everybody’s blues crazy ♪\n\nTyina: There’s this great story where he’s whipping his hair around, and he turns to the audience and says, “I’m the king of the blues. And also the queen, too.” [Laughs]\n\n♪ Ain’t that good ♪\n\n♪ News ♪\n\nTyina: And so even though the Princess LaVonne character gets retired, I think that he took her with him. ♪\n\nRon: Richard was the greatest marketer of himself or anyone that I knew. Was constantly putting himself out there. So, he sent his demo tape to Specialty Records.\n\n[Low instrumentals play over black and white footage of Little Richards.]\n\nRichard: I waited one year. Can you imagine them having me wait a whole year?\n\n[A reel-to-teel tape plays.]\n\n♪ Taxi, taxi, take me anywhere ♪\n\n♪ Taxi, taxi, take me anywhere ♪\n\nVoice of Art Rupe, Founder of Specialty Records: We didn’t listen to the tape right away. It was a scratchy tape, and it was poorly recorded.\n\n[Telephones ringing]\n\nHe just kept calling us. So, finally I said, “Find that tape.” And we found it, and we listened to it.\n\nRichard: ♪ She got my money, but I don’t even care ♪\n\nArt: And so if it hadn’t been for Richard’s persistence, we would have never met Little Richard.\n\n[Footage of New Orleans, 1955.]\n\nRichard: They had me to meet them in New Orleans, and I met them down there.\n\nRichard: Alright. Stand by, please. This is “Wondering.” Done with a lot of feeling. Take one. I recorded some blues. I recorded “Wondering.”\n\n♪ I’m ♪\n\n♪ Wonderin’ ♪\n\nRobert “Bumps” Blackwell, Producer, Specialty Records: I just stopped the session because we were getting no place fast. Great singer singing a good song. So what? And we went into the Dew Drop Inn. There was a piano. All of the boosters, rounders, pimps, whores, and everything else was hanging around. And that was when I began to know and understand Richard. ‘Cause that’s all you gotta do, is give Richard an audience, turn the lights on, and the show is on.\n\n[A piano tune gains tempo.]\n\nRon: And Richard jumped on the piano and did —\n\n♪ Awop-bop-a-loo-bop, alop-bam-boom ♪\n\nSo they heard it and say, “Wait a minute. What’s that?” It was a hook that they had never heard before. But Richard had been singing that phrase for years, you know, on the Chitlin’ Circuit.\n\nRichard: And so I started singing. Awop-bop-a-loo-mop alop-bam-boom. If it don’t fit, don’t force it. You can grease it and make it easy. If you want it, you got it. Tutti-frutti, good booty.\n\nDeacon: The lyrics could be interpreted as gay sex. They’re not gonna play that on the radio!

We were in the same house but different locations.\n\n[Solemn guitar instrumentals play.]\n\nDeacon: It makes me sad, and it makes me angry, too.

Is there anybody here think we gonna break in? This neighborhood was the neighborhood. I enjoyed it because my brothers and sisters, you know, I had moved them from Macon, Georgia, here. And this is the first time they had a chance to live in a house like this. You know, in Macon, they had homes like this, but only white people lived in them. And for them to have the opportunity to live in a home like this with cars that was theirs felt good to give them something that I never had before.

And he stayed private.\n\n[Solemn instrumentals over continued photos of Little Richard.]\n\nRon: At that time, Richard discovered how Specialty Records, the way things were done with the royalties. I don’t know the percentages of the contract, but it was terrible. It was terrible.\n\nRichard: If you spoke for your money, you was a troublemaker. But if you just went along with the program, didn’t say nothing, you was a “good boy.” Never a man — a “good boy.” Mind, the record company’s not paying me my royalties. I had to work all the time.\n\nHB Barnum, Friend & Bandmate: Richard asked, would I come on the tour. Richard had such charisma. That, along with his tremendous talent, was just — made it natural, you know? I said, “Of course.” Oh, it was exciting. I mean, you know, I was young. I was raised in Los Angeles, so when I went South, that was quite an experience for me.\n\n[A sign reads: We want white tenants in our white community.

It was fun, you know, because this is the first time that I can tell him what to do. He’d say, “Oh, baby, you work me too hard. You work me like a slave.” So it was quite an experience for me and an honor for me. We were talking about we was gonna go on the road and do a world tour and everything. Nothing really happened.\n\n[A slow piano tune takes over from guitar instrumentals.]\n\nTyina: By the late ’60s to early ’70s, Richard’s new rock ‘n’ roll records were not selling. Richard blamed the record label.\n\n[Richard rides in his limo at night.]\n\nRichard: I started asking about my money, and they stopped pushing my records. Soon as I wanted my money, they stopped playing them because they didn’t want to pay me. That’s the way it went. That’s the way it was.\n\nTyina: Little Richard felt like it was because of racism. And what is true is that, in the world of popular music, people are associating rock ‘n’ roll with white performers. Now rock ‘n’ roll has a white face.\n\n[The Rolling Stones’ “Jumping Jack Flash” plays.

And then you say, “Well, I’m just gonna do what I do best.”\n\nTyina: Even though Little Richard was being outsold by the people who were inspired by him, the response from Richard, it’s so defiant.\n\n[Fans greet Richard as he walks to his limo.]\n\nRichard: And that’s when I started looking more and more fabulous.\n\nFan: You’re beautiful!\n\nRichard: Everything I put on was a diamond.\n\n[Crowd cheers as Little Richard performs.]\n\nRon: When I started working with him in the ’70s, he took it up at least another hundred notches.

As soon as he showed me that and said that, we were done. Like, “Let’s go, bro. I know — I got it.” Little Richard was just so far ahead of his time.

I love you!” [Laughs] “You want this? I’ll do it to you. Take off your clothes, and let’s do it.” There was just people like that. And he — he knew where to get them, how to get them, especially if there’s drugs involved.\n\n[Richard rides in his limo.]\n\nRichard: Everybody liked to go to orgies — everybody. I just enjoyed sex in its entirety. Sex, to me, was like a smorgasbord. You should just go and pick whatever you want. And if you knocked on my door, and I wanted mo’, fo’ sho’.\n\nCharles Moore: He did it in excess. Everything in excess. You know? Women, men, orgies. Wine, whiskey, weed, angel dust, cocaine, heroin — It was called a speedball when you mixed the two. You inject the pure stuff, it can kill you, like some people I know, some musicians I know that did that. It’s not good.\n\n[Troubled instrumentals play. A photo is shown of Little Richard singing at a microphone.]\n\nHe had some demons he had to fight. But I saw a side of Richard, he just wanted to have peace and maybe someone — either a man or woman — that he could share his life with. Someone that he loved.\n\nRichard: I was lonely. I felt that no one wanted me. Although you had millions of fans screaming over you all over the world, but you just wanted somebody to be with you personally that said, “Little Richard, I love you. I care for you, Richard.”\n\nLee Angel: Someone told him that I was looking for him, and he reached me. I flew to Los Angeles, and at the airport, 12:00 in the afternoon, L.A.X, 17 crazy-looking guys got out of a limousine, and Richard got out with this red and gold bat-winged outfit and his pompadour and his makeup yelling, “Shut up!” I saw the loneliest man I’d ever seen in my life. He was drinking. He was doing drugs. He was smoking, which is funny. In the beginning, Richard didn’t do anything. He did not believe in anyone doing these things. He had me try PCP for the first time, and it just… [Sighs]\n\n[Footage of Richard speaking, muffled. Troubled instrumentals continue.]\n\nLee Angel: He just wasn’t the person I knew anymore.\n\nRichard: That’s when I found out that I had really fallen. You know, I started looking real old, and I got real small, and I got so that I didn’t want to see my mother and my sisters and brothers. ‘Cause I didn’t want them to see me in that condition. So I said, “It’s time to get right with God.”\n\nCharles Moore: During that time, well, he changed. He came to my hotel room. We talked for hours about his life. He didn’t want to be gay anymore.\n\n[A picture of a shirtless Little Richard.]\n\nCharles Moore: It’s a pitiful thing to see a person not loving himself.

And we went and checked into a hotel and just have a good time to get high and let it all hang out. The next morning, my brother fell dead from a heart attack.\n\nRon: When Richard’s brother Tony died, that had a profound effect on him. He felt he should have gone to see his brother. And so that guilt laid on him, and it magnified in his mind. This was the last straw. The parties and the cocaine, it’s the orgies, all of that was over.\n\n[Gospel music plays.

Well, the Bible said, “For what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give…”\n\nRev. Minson: Sweet hearing his voice. And the first time I saw him administer the gospel, I just knew this was — this was an incredible guy.\n\nRichard: I came here tonight to tell you that Jesus loves you.

I mean, what — When you come out and pronounce it publicly like that, to say, “Okay. I took a left turn instead of a right turn, but I’m on the right path now, and this is the reason why.

This is the person who brought queer aesthetics into rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nDavid: Little Richard. [Cheers and applause]\n\nTyina: But you can really see a sadness. I think that he does have this kind of internal conflict about the music that he was performing and the way that he presented himself.\n\nDavid: When you see yourself in action in the old days, you want to get back into it on that level?\n\nRichard: I’m just so glad God brought me out of that. I never knew I looked like that. [Laughter] I’m just so glad that God was able to clean me up and wash me up, and thank you, Lord.\n\nTyina: I think he came there to almost apologize.

Well, what are you going to sing, Gladys?\n\nGladys: I’m gonna try to do “Them There Eyes” for you.\n\nInterviewer: “Them There Eyes.”\n\nLorraine Toussaint, Narrator: Blues singer and pianist Gladys Bentley made her only television appearance on Groucho Marx’s “You Bet Your Life” comedy show.\n\n– ♪ I fell in love with you the first time ♪\n\n♪ I looked into them there eyes ♪\n\n♪ You’ve got a cute little way of flirtin’ ♪\n\n♪ With them there eyes ♪\n\nDwandalyn Reece, Curator of Music & Performing Arts, National Museum of African American History & Culture: Gladys Bentley, the way that she presented herself was usually in a tux and a top hat, but she also had the makeup. She’s always playing with identity and presentation and fluidity.\n\nVoiced by Lisa Wilkerson: “I have violated the accepted code of morals, but the world applauded my piano playing and song styling. Even though people bitterly condemned my personal way of living, they still could appreciate my artistry as a performer.”\n\n– ♪ Yes, baby, them there eyes ♪\n\n[Gladys concludes her song to audience applause. Now, a black and white photo of three young Black children sitting on a stoop.]\n\nLorraine: Gladys Bentley was born in 1907 to a working-class family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father was African-American, her mother, an immigrant from Trinidad.\n\nLisa: “It seems I was born different. At the age of 9, I stole my brothers’ suits and began to feel more comfortable in boys’ clothes than in dresses.”\n\nDwandalyn: Early on, she knew that she was attracted to women. She didn’t feel like her body represented who she was.\n\nCookie Woolner, Historian, University of Memphis: Her parents are concerned about her budding lesbianism. They take her to doctors, hoping to cure her, to make her a “normal” woman. We have the rise of medical experts who study the science of sex, who are introducing terms like “homosexual” and “heterosexual.” But most doctors at this time saw same sex desire as pathological.\n\n[An old report on screen titled: The Homosexual Neurosis. Excerpt from a variety of articles: A perversion now commonly noted. The civil responsibility of sexual perverts. Opinion favors sterilization law. To begin sterilizing ‘unfit’. Says science must supply the remedy. Ladies be sure your pants are buttoned.]\n\nLisa “Some decide to take the reins of their destiny in their own hands. That is the way I reacted to being an unwanted child.”\n\nLorraine: In 1923, at age 16, with dreams of becoming a musician, Bentley ran away from home to live in Harlem, New York, then the epicenter of the Harlem Renaissance.\n\n[Black and white video footage of a slice of life in Harlem, New York.]\n\nDwandalyn: It was a flowering time of African-American arts, letters, cultural expression. When African-Americans left the South with the Great Migration, they really create lives for themselves in places like New York, Chicago, Detroit, building these urban communities that were tolerant, that supported experimentation and different kinds of identities.\n\n[Photos and video footage of Duke Ellington, Langston Hughes, W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston. Jazzy piano music plays. A news article reads: U.S. Has Voted Dry. Photos from the prohibition era.]\n\nCookie: One of the reasons Harlem emerges as such a central site for queer African-Americans at this time is because this is the Prohibition Era. So from 1920 to 1933, it is illegal to purchase alcohol. But, of course, we have the emergence of speakeasies, where people are able to purchase bootleg alcohol and take part in other illicit activities, from gambling, to interracial dancing, or same-sex dancing. So the entertainment industry becomes a really important alternative for black women, who really didn’t have many other opportunities for work.\n\nLorraine: Bentley first worked on the Harlem party circuit. Then a job opened up at a nightclub.\n\nCookie: The club was actually looking for a male piano player, but she insisted that this would be the perfect time for them to start using a female instead.\n\nLisa: “My hands flew over the keys.”\n\n[“Worried Blues” composed & performed by Gladys Bentley.]\n\n– ♪ What make you menfolk treat us women like you do? ♪\n\n[Scatting]\n\n♪ I don’t want no man that I got to give my money to ♪\n\n[Scatting]\n\n“When I finished my number, the applause was terrific.\n\n[Applause]\n\nI was offered work right on the spot.”\n\nLorraine: Bentley soon became a headliner at various clubs and theaters.\n\n[Archival photos and articles read: ‘Pansy’ Places on Broadway. “Pansy Club” now with racket getting bolder. Pansy Parlors.]\n\nCookie: We have clubs such as The Ubangi Club, where Gladys Bentley performed, which are appealing more to explicitly queer audiences. We have what’s known as the Pansy Craze going on. This interest in queer culture that white people had in this period.\n\nDwandalyn: Gladys Bentley sometimes was billed as a male impersonator, showing queerness and flirting with women onstage and singing songs with lyrics that are upsetting all the cultural norms about identity.\n\n[“Big Gorilla Man” composed & performed by Gladys Bentley. Photos of Gladys appear.]\n\n– ♪ That big gorilla ♪\n\n♪ A woman killer ♪\n\n♪ And I ought to know ♪\n\nLorraine: Bentley’s lyrics were known for their bold content, highlighting her cross-dressing tendencies and her feelings towards women.\n\nDwandalyn: She was not the only person who cross-dressed. Ethel Waters did it, Marlene Dietrich did it. Women in their own ways were challenging conceptions of what a woman could be.\n\n[A performance of “Masculine Women, Feminine Men” from 1926.]\n\n– ♪ …that I need so bad ♪\n\n[Scatting]\n\n[Music ends]\n\nShirlette Ammons, Musician: Gladys Bentley represents this lyrical and sexual prowess that women like me can wear onstage that is not ladylike.\n\n[Shirlette raps in a park with musicians.]\n\n♪ They just gonna lean so fresh, so clean ♪\n\n♪ For them boys in skirts to butch bulge in jeans ♪\n\nMy name is Shirlette Ammons.\n\n♪ …convene ♪\n\n♪ Sook, Lex, Shirlette, perfect connect ♪\n\n♪ Like ♪\n\nI am a musician, writer, and television producer.\n\n♪ I need to lose some sleep ♪\n\n♪ I need the struggle, resistance ♪\n\n♪ and the comic relief ♪\n\nJust knowing that Gladys existed, and existed so proudly and so openly, changed my life and completely gave me license to be all the things that I am — black, Southern, queer, an artist.

A low instrumental beat plays.]\n\nLorraine: In 1928, Bentley began a recording career that would span two decades. She traveled to clubs all over the country and inspired characters in several books.\n\nLisa: “The clubs where I worked overflowed with celebrities. I had made my mark in show business.”\n\n[Text on screen: Miss Bentley was an amazing exhibition of musical energy– a large, dark, masculine lady, whose feet pounded the floor. New text: Gladys Bentley and Her Entertainers. The Talk Of The Town. Seek to Ban Songs Of Gladys Bentley. Gladys Bentley, the masculine-garbed, smut-singing entertainer.]\n\nLorraine: But beyond the world of show business, Bentley’s lifestyle faced criticism.\n\nCookie: There was really no way that someone like her could be viewed as a respectable figure at this time. This is the Jim Crow era, right? There’s such a concern about racial uplift, upward mobility that a figure such as Bentley is seen as so deviant that many in the mainstream African-American community were not a fan, to put it mildly.\n\nDwandalyn: There were people such as Adam Clayton Powell or traditional mainline churches that had views of homosexuality that did not fit the tenets of Christian beliefs. And for many people, it was an aberration, something going against what God dictated. And so that backlash existed.\n\n[Continued photos from news articles: In Sermon Sunday Morning, Dr. A. Clayton Powell Denounces Degeneracy and Sex-Perverts. Homosexuality and sex-perversion among women, said Dr. Powell, has grown into one of the most horrible debassing, alarming and damning vices of present day civilization.]\n\nLorraine: Bentley’s act fell on hard times in the mid-1930s.\n\nCookie: The Depression definitely made a difference in the entertainment world, and with the end of Prohibition, we actually see more regulation of nightclub spaces. There’s a concern about bar spaces that are seen as disorderly, and “disorderly” was often a code word for gay at this time.\n\nLorraine: In 1937, Bentley moved to Los Angeles, California. But there she faced challenges to her desire to perform onstage in men’s clothing.\n\n[Archival photos of Los Angeles, California. Ads for Gladys Bentley shows at Mona’s Club 440.]\n\nCookie: The state of California actually had anti-cross-dressing laws that went back to the 19th century to keep entertainment good and clean. And there were times where she was banned from performing because of her cross-dressing.\n\nLorraine: In the early 1950s, Bentley adapted her public image to match the times.\n\n[A montage of news articles denouncing sex perversion, cross-dressing, and homosexuality.]\n\nCookie: The post-World War II era becomes incredibly conservative, especially around norms of gender and sexuality, and this leads to what is known as not only the Red Scare, but also the Lavender Scare. And this kind of comes to a head with the firing of hundreds of government employees who are thought to be gay.\n\nDwandalyn: And possibly as a reaction to those times, she had to change her performance style to stay employed and to keep doing her line of work.\n\n[August 1952 issue of Ebony magazine. An article written by Gladys Bentley titled, “I’m A Woman Again.]\n\nCookie: This is when we see her publish an article in Ebony magazine with the title “I Am a Woman Again.”\n\nLisa: “For many years I inhabited that half-shadow no-man’s-land which exists between the boundaries of the two sexes. Today I am a woman again, through the miracle of modern medicine, living a normal existence.”\n\nLorraine: In that same article, Bentley stated that she consulted a doctor to receive hormone treatments and also married a man.\n\nCookie: I think she is spinning a tale of respectability. Right? A tale of someone who wants to be seen as fully human in this very repressive time.\n\nDwandalyn: If you read that article really closely, it really is a plea for tolerance and understanding. She’s not condemning who she was or is, but really explaining the struggles of what it meant to live her life.\n\nShirlette: She went back into the closet so that one day I would never have to do that.\n\n♪ Unh, pacifists might laugh at this ♪\n\n♪ Might ask me if I’m a masochist ♪\n\nBut this is a white boys’ game still. When you’re making music that represents a marginalized history and the gatekeepers still don’t look like you, that’s something that a lot of musicians and artists who are black or queer are constantly battling.\n\nLorraine: Bentley was studying to become an ordained Christian minister when she died of complications from a flu virus at age 52.\n\nDwandalyn: I see her as a pioneer. She’s somebody we can all look up to, whether we’re gay, lesbian, bi, heterosexual. She invited us to be our whole selves, and that’s what we all want to be.\n\n[“Red Beans & Rice Blues” composed & performed by Gladys Bentley]\n\n♪ Red beans and rice ♪\n\n♪ Greasy bacon in the pot ♪\n\nLisa: “I have earned the distinction of being the first and, in some cases, the only performer of my race to crash the most plush glitter spots.

There were very few African-Americans who recorded at that time. But we have many descriptions of her voice from the press, how powerful it was and the emotion and the sympathy that you could hear when she sang.\n\n[Article text reads: Mme.

I give out melody because God filled my soul with it.”\n\nJulianna: Jones was born Matilda Sissieretta Joyner in 1868 in Portsmouth, Virginia, just after the end of the Civil War. Her parents were devout Methodists. Her father, a pastor, had been born into slavery.\n\nMaureen: In 1876, the family moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where her father had been offered a ministerial position. They went north looking for a better life than in the South.\n\nJulianna: Jones began singing in the church choir at an early age.\n\nLorraine: “After singing a solo at a Sunday school concert, some people said to my mother, ‘The child sang a high C. You should let her learn music.'”\n\nMaureen: Maybe it was a benefactor at the church who got the money together. She went to the Providence Academy of Music and got some vocal training.\n\nJulianna: She married a hotel porter in 1883 at age 15 and had a daughter, who died as a baby. In 1886, Jones pursued additional vocal training in Boston.\n\n[“Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” sung by Fish Jubilee Singers. 1909.]\n\n– ♪ Swing low ♪\n\nJulianna: She began touring music halls throughout the Northeast to great acclaim…\n\n– ♪ Coming for to carry me home ♪\n\n…and was hired by a white manager as the lead vocalist of the Tennessee Jubilee Singers, performing arias, gospel, and popular tunes.\n\n– ♪ Coming for to carry me home ♪\n\nMaureen: She’ll be limited to concert appearances because there isn’t any opportunity for her to sing in opera. Opera companies weren’t hiring African-American singers, and most white American musicians were not going to appear on the same stage with Sissieretta.\n\nJulianna: In 1888 and 1890, Jones and the troupe toured throughout the Caribbean to packed racially mixed concert halls. The second tour was managed by an all- black team, including her husband.\n\n[A map of the West Indies.\n\nHarolyn: That’s when she was given the title of the greatest singer of her generation.\n\n[“Carmen” by George Bizet.

And unfortunately, it stuck throughout her entire career.\n\nLorraine: “It rather annoys me to be called the Black Patti, but I have a voice and I am striving to win the favor of the public by honest merit and hard work.”\n\nJ’Nai Bridges: To be so gifted in these times as a black person, I can imagine was one of the most frustrating things because she couldn’t just be Sissieretta Jones. She had to be the Black Patti, which was demeaning. My name is J’Nai Bridges, and I’m a mezzo-soprano opera singer. Recently I made my Metropolitan Opera debut singing Queen Nefertiti in “Akhnaten” by Philip Glass. The first time that I walked onto the stage, I think my heart skipped a beat, maybe three, but it really felt like I was home.\n\n[J’Nai performs on stage: “Carmen” by George Bizet.

The following year, she became the first African-American woman to headline a concert on the main stage at Carnegie Hall, slated on the same program as noted abolitionist Frederick Douglass.\n\n[“Ave Maria” by Charles Gounod.
