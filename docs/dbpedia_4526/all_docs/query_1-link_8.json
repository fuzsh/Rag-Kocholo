        "text": "In addition to competition and reality shows, network television found success in some tried-and-true old genres in the new century. Procedural dramas thrived, especially on CBS. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (CBS, begun 2000) was the top-rated show for three consecutive seasons, from 2002 through 2005, and engendered two spin-offs: CSI: Miami (CBS, 2002–12) and CSI: NY (CBS, 2004–13). NBC’s Law & Order, which debuted in 1990, broke into the top 10 for the first time in 2000–01 and inspired four spin-offs: Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (NBC, begun 1999), Law & Order: Criminal Intent (NBC/USA, 2001–11), Law & Order: Trial by Jury (NBC, 2005–2006), and Law & Order: Los Angeles (NBC, 2010–11). The medical serial ER (NBC, 1994–2009) remained a hit, but it was eventually displaced in the top 10 by a new medical serial, Grey’s Anatomy (ABC, begun 2005). The legal drama, a standard genre since the days of radio, was represented by The Practice (ABC, 1997–2004) and Boston Legal (ABC, 2004–08), both created and produced by David Kelley, who had written for L.A. Law (NBC, 1986–94) and had created the legal comedy-drama Ally McBeal (Fox, 1997–2002).\n\nDesperate Housewives (ABC, 2004–12) rejuvenated the prime-time soap opera, one of the most popular programming forms during the last quarter of the 20th century. After the highly successful runs of shows such as Dallas (CBS, 1978–91), Dynasty (ABC, 1981–89), Falcon Crest (CBS, 1981–90), and Melrose Place (Fox, 1992–99), the genre seemed to have played out by 2000. Desperate Housewives, however, with its provocative title and mischievous and intertwined story lines, consistently achieved high ratings.\n\nThe situation comedy was in bad decline in the early 2000s. The big hits of the 1990s were departing one after another, and there were few new sitcoms to take their places. Roseanne left the air in 1997, followed by Seinfeld in 1998. Both Friends (NBC, 1994–2004) and Frasier (NBC, 1993–2004) completed their network runs in 2004, and Everybody Loves Raymond (CBS, 1996–2005) concluded the following year. Although there were few traditional sitcoms left, new half-hour comedies shot in a single-camera style without a live audience began to find success, if not the spectacular hit status of the earlier sitcoms. Scrubs (NBC/ABC, 2001–10), The Office (NBC, 2005–13), My Name Is Earl (NBC, 2005–09), and 30 Rock (NBC, 2006–13) were among this new generation of comedy series.\n\nShortly after the September 11 attacks, Fox introduced 24 (2001–10), an innovative espionage drama. Like Murder One (ABC, 1995–97), a legal drama from the 1990s, each season of 24 was like a miniseries, presenting a single story line (with many intertwining threads) that concluded at the end of the season. In the case of 24, however, each 24-episode season represented a single 24-hour day; each episode presented an hour in the life of intelligence agent Jack Bauer (played by Kiefer Sutherland). Another notable program was Lost (ABC, 2004–10), perhaps the most narratively complex series in American TV series history. Borrowing elements of the paranormal from previous series such as Twin Peaks (ABC, 1990–91) and The X-Files (Fox, 1993–2002), Lost followed 48 survivors of a plane crash on an island in the Pacific, employing a dizzying number of tricks, from flash-forwards and flashbacks to parallel times and spaces. It was a perfect show for the Internet age, engendering amateur speculation and analysis from bloggers around the world.\n\nMany argued, however, that the most interesting new programs of the 2000s were coming from cable, not the networks. Not regulated by federal indecency rules that limit content on over-the-air programs from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm, cable channels could, and did, present more “adult” content than their network counterparts. Basic cable channels began introducing original programming in the early 2000s that garnered a significant amount of critical acclaim and awards. FX aired The Shield (2002–08), Nip/Tuck (2003–10), Rescue Me (2004–11), Over There (2005), and Damages (2007–10; Audience Network, 2011–12); TNT supplied The Closer (2005–12), Saving Grace (2007–10), and Raising the Bar (2008–09); USA Network’s Monk (2002–09) won seven Emmy Awards; and AMC’s Mad Men (begun 2007) won six in its first season, including that for Outstanding Drama Series.\n\nThe premium pay-cable channels HBO and Showtime continued to offer extraordinary examples of literate and sophisticated television art in the new century. Although HBO’s subsequent series did not reach the ratings heights of Sex and the City or The Sopranos, the network did continue to bring out acclaimed dramas such as Six Feet Under (2001–05) and The Wire (2002–08), comedies such as Curb Your Enthusiasm (begun 2000) and Entourage (2004–11), miniseries such as Angels in America (2003) and John Adams (2008), and experimental oddments such as K Street (2003) and Carnivale (2003–05). Showtime’s output of original scripted series also picked up in the early 2000s, with such notable series as The L Word (2004–09), Weeds (2005–12), Dexter (2006–13), and The Tudors (2007–10)."
