        "text": "Essential Question\n\nHow did radio influence American life in the years before the birth of Rock and Roll?\n\nOverview\n\nFrom its birth in 1920 to the rise of television in the early 1950s, commercial radio played a central role in American life. For much of this era, the radio itself held an honored place in the center of the home. Entire families would gather around it to hear important news events, listen to live music, or catch the latest installment of a hit drama or comedy series such as The Lone Ranger or Amos ‘n Andy.\n\nBut by the early 1950s, technological shifts—most notably the introduction of television into the family living room—heralded significant changes in the American people’s relationship with radio. The rise of smaller, portable radios meant that individuals could now listen virtually any time or place. The growing popularity of television rendered radio drama and comedy series nearly obsolete; listeners were less satisfied with merely listening to stories on radio when they could see them unfold before their eyes on television.\n\nBut far from disappearing from American life, as some predicted, radio instead reinvented itself in the early 1950s. Recorded popular music would come to play an increasingly central role in radio programming over the next two decades, as opposed to the live performances that dominated the airwaves in the decades prior. As the major networks, such as NBC and CBS, shifted their attention from radio to television, radio stations came more and more under local control, allowing for greater experimentation and creativity in programming. One such local owner, Todd Storz of WKOH in Omaha, Nebraska, pioneered a new format in which listeners could hear recordings of their favorite songs over and over again, paving the way for what would soon become known as “Top 40” radio. Some stations began playing a broader range of recorded music, including some that emphasized Rhythm and Blues performed by African-American artists. These changes set the stage for radio to play a central role in the Rock and Roll explosion of the late 1950s.\n\nView More\n\nObjectives\n\nUpon completion of this lesson, students will:\n\nKnow (knowledge):\n\nThe changing nature and influence of radio on American life in successive eras, from the 1920s through the early 1950s\n\nHow radio helped create a “mass culture” in American society\n\nHow commercial radio transformed itself after the rise of television from a medium that emphasized dramatic and comedy series to one that increasingly centered around music-based programming\n\nBe able to (skills):\n\nCompare and contrast the style and influence of commercial radio in successive eras in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s.\n\nImages\n\nActivities\n\nHomework Preparation:\n\nRecommended\n\nAsk students to interview a family member or neighbor over the age of 65 about his or her memories of radio as s/he was growing up. Students should ask the following questions and record answers in their notebooks:\n\nApproximately how old is the person? (Based on this information, try to identify the decade in which s/he grew up.)\n\nHow often did the person listen to radio?\n\nWhat did s/he generally listen to? Music? News? Sports? Dramas? Something else?\n\nWhen and where did s/he tend to listen?\n\nDoes s/he have any specific memories of listening to radio that stand out?\n\nOverall, how important was radio to his/her life while growing up?\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\nOn a sheet of paper, ask students to write down the amount of time (in minutes or hours) they spend each day listening to radio.\n\nShare sample responses.\n\nDiscuss:\n\nOn average, do students listen to radio a lot, a little, or not at all?\n\nWhat do students listen to on the radio? Music? Sports? News? Talk? Something else?\n\nDo they generally listen to AM, FM, streaming, or satellite radio?\n\nWhere do they listen?\n\nWhen do they listen?\n\nDo they listen alone, or with others?\n\nHow does listening to something on radio differ from watching it on television or the Internet?\n\nOverall, do they feel radio plays a significant role in their lives? Why or why not?\n\nIf students have completed the homework assignment (above), discuss the following:\n\nHow do their own answers differ from the answers given by the person they interviewed? (Be sure to elicit specific information about the age of the person interviewed and the decade in which s/he grew up.)\n\nOverall, did radio seem to play a bigger part in the lives of the adults they interviewed than in their own lives? Why do they think this might be the case?\n\nIf students have not completed the homework assignment, explain that radio played a central role in the lives of many individuals who grew up in the 1930s through the 1950s, and discuss:\n\nWhy might this be the case? What other news and entertainment options are available today that were not available to people growing up in those decades?\n\nHow do students imagine their lives might be different if they had to rely on radio as a main source of information and entertainment? How might their perception of the world be different if this were the case?\n\nProcedure:\n\nDivide students into groups of 3-5. Distribute Handout 1 – An Overview of the Early History of Radio to all groups.\n\nAsk a student volunteer to read the handout aloud. Other students should follow along, underlining key words and terms.\n\nDiscuss with the class as a whole:\n\nWhen did radio first become an important part of American life?\n\nWhat is commercial radio? What kinds of programs did it offer in the early days?\n\nWhy did radio became so popular so quickly? What did it offer?\n\nWhen did the popularity of radio begin to decline and why?\n\nExplain that in this activity, each group will investigate the importance of radio to American life in the years leading up to the birth of Rock and Roll and report its findings to the rest of the class. The four groups are (instructors should duplicate groups in order to accommodate overall class size):\n\nEarly Radio in the 1920s.\n\nHandout for Group 1 – Radio in the 1920s\n\nVideo: Earl Burtnett and his Biltmore Hotel Orchestra\n\nVideo: Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll\n\nThe Golden Age of Radio in the 1930s\n\nHandout for Group 2 – The Golden Age of Radio in the 1930s\n\nVideo: “Back of the Mike”\n\nVideo: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Fireside Chat\n\nVideo: “War of the Worlds”\n\nRadio During World War II\n\nHandout for Group 3 – Radio During World War II\n\nVideo: Edward R. Murrow in London\n\nVideo: Franklin D. Roosevelt, “Day of Infamy” speech\n\nVideo: “You Can’t Do Business with Hitler”\n\nRadio in the Late 1940s and Early 1950s\n\nHandout for Group 4 – The Late 1940s and Early 1950s: The Birth of Television and the Rebirth of Radio\n\nVideo: The Lone Ranger on Radio and TV\n\nVideo: Elmore James, “Dust My Broom”\n\nEach group will examine a series of readings, pictures, and videos relating to its time period in order to answer the following questions:\n\nWhy was radio important to American citizens during this period?\n\nWhat were some of the key features of radio and radio programming during this period?\n\nWhen and where did people listen to radio during this period?\n\nDistribute the appropriate packet of readings and resources to each group.\n\nOptional: If students have access to the Internet, ask them to identify at least one additional online resource relating to radio in the period they are studying. They will use this resource to support their overall findings.\n\nAllow each group sufficient time to review its document set and watch the videos listed in the handout.\n\nEach group should then work to prepare a short presentation (no more than five minutes) to the class on the period it has studied, answering the questions listed above, and including at least one short sample of a radio broadcast from that era.\n\nGroups will work together to decide on an appropriate format for their presentation. Students should be encouraged to create something original that reflects the subject matter at hand. (For example, they might perform a live radio broadcast in the style of the era they have studied.)\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nHave each group make its presentation to the class. Instruct students to take notes highlighting key points of the other groups’ presentations.\n\nAfter all groups have made their presentations, discuss the following:\n\nHow did radio programming change over time?\n\nOverall, how significant a role did radio play in American life and culture during this era?\n\nHow did the rise of television impact radio?\n\nHow do you think the changes to radio in the late 1940s and early 1950s helped to pave the way for the rise of Rock and Roll?\n\nWriting Prompt:\n\nDescribe the impact of radio on American society from 1920 to the early 1950s. Cite specific evidence from this lesson and address the following:\n\nHow did radio change the way Americans received information and their sources of entertainment?\n\nHow did radio influence the ways Americans lived?\n\nWhy did radio play such a significant role in this era?\n\nExtensions:\n\nUsing the information discussed in this lesson, ask students to create a timeline of radio history from the 1920s to the early 1950s.\n\nAsk students to research and report on the introduction and early development of radio in your community. Students may be able to find information at a local historical society, and may also find it helpful to research entertainment sections of local newspapers of the period, which may have published daily radio broadcast schedules. It may also be helpful for students to interview older residents who may have personal memories of early radio in the community. Student research should address such questions as:\n\nWhat was the first radio station in your town/city? If there wasn’t one, what stations did people in your town/city listen to in the 1920s—1950s?\n\nWhen and how did other radio stations come into being?\n\nWho were some of the important radio personalities in the community?\n\nWhat was the influence of local radio stations on local history and culture?\n\nHow did the influence of radio in this era compare to the influence of the Internet on American society in recent years?\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout 1 – Overview of the Early History of Radio Handout for Group 1 – Radio in the 1920s Handout for Group 2 – The Golden Age of Radio in the 1930s Handout for Group 3 – Radio During World War II Handout for Group 4 – The Late 1940s and Early 1950s: The Birth of Television and the Rebirth of Radio\n\nStandards\n\nNew Jersey State Standards\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Reading\n\nNJSLSA.R7: Integrate and evaluate content presented in diverse media and formats, including visually and quantitatively, as well as in words.\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Writing\n\nNJSLSA.W2: Write informative/explanatory texts to examine and convey complex ideas and information clearly and accurately through the effective selection, organization, and analysis of content.\n\nNJSLSA.W4: Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development, organization, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.\n\nNew York State Standards\n\nNew York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards\n\nReading Anchor Standards\n\nIntegration of Knowledge and Ideas\n\nStandard 7: Integrate and evaluate content presented in diverse media and formats.\n\nWriting Anchor Standards\n\nText Types and Purposes\n\nStandard 2: Write informative/explanatory texts to examine and convey complex ideas and information clearly and accurately through the effective selection, organization, and analysis of content.\n\nPresentation of Knowledge and Ideas\n\nStandard 4: Present information, findings, and supporting evidence so that listeners can follow the line of reasoning.
