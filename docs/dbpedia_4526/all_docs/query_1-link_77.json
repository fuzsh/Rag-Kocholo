        "text": "With a victory in January as the most-watched cable news network, Fox News Channel has hit a huge milestone, becoming the first news network to rank number one in total day and prime time ratings for 22 consecutive years, according to ratings data compiled by Nielsen.\n\n“Marking another historic feat is a true reflection of the unwavering dedication and outstanding talent that we have throughout the entire organization of Fox News Channel,” said Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott in a statement released by the network.\n\nIn January, Fox News nearly swept the list of the 100 highest-rated telecasts for the month, taking 98. CNN had just one, and MSNBC finished the month with none. Overall, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable television in daytime, and placed second in prime time, just behind ESPN. In prime, Fox delivered an average total audience of 1.9 million viewers in January, beating MSNBC (1.1 million viewers) and CNN (612,000 viewers).\n\nFox News also took first place among viewers 25-54, the key demographic of younger viewers most valued by advertisers, with an average audience in January of 207,000 in prime.\n\nThe most-watched show in cable news for the month was FNC’s The Five, with a total audience of 2.950 million viewers, followed by Jesse Watters Primetime (2.826 million viewers), Hannity (2.504 million viewers), The Ingraham Angle (2.202 million viewers) and Special Report with Bret Baier (2.198 million viewers)—all airing on the Fox News Channel.\n\nIn the key demo, Jesse Watters Primetime was the highest-rated show in cable news, with a total audience of 299,000 viewers, followed by Gutfeld! (283,000 viewers), Hannity (276,000 viewers), The Five (257,000 viewers) and The Ingraham Angle (223,000 viewers)—all airing on Fox.\n\nThe highest-rated cable news show not airing on Fox was MSNBC’s The Beat with Ari Melber, which placed 10th overall with a total audience of 1.513 million viewers. Rounding out the top 15, MSNBC’s Deadline: White House was 11th (1.483 million viewers), and The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell was 13th (1.463 million viewers).\n\nCNN’s highest-rated show on the month was Anderson Cooper 360, which finished January in 28th place overall with a total audience of 731,000 viewers. No other CNN show placed in the top 30, with CNN’s revamped prime time lineup The Source with Kaitlan Collins landing in 34th place (602,000 viewers), CNN Newsnight finishing 38th (452,000 viewers) and Laura Coates Live in 39th place (357,000 viewers)."
