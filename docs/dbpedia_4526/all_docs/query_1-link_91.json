        "text": "Lazarus says 'Billion Dollar Lab\" drives ad sales but also lays foundation for future live events\n\nThe past three Olympic Games, in South Korea, Japan, and China, challenged the NBC Olympics team (and viewers) with vast time zone differences and, of course, the Covid pandemic. So nearly everyone was waiting to see how the Paris Games would do not only ratings wise but in terms of an actual event with crowds at full capacity and one of the world’s most beautiful cities as a backdrop.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon in Paris key NBC executives involved with the Games, Mark Lazarus, Chairman NBCUniversal Media Group; Rick Cordella, President, NBC Sports, and Molly Solomon, Executive Producer and President of NBC Olympics Production, held a media call to discuss all of those things and more with the media.\n\nLazarus said that the enthusiasm in Paris for the Olympics is reminiscent of the London 2012 Games and that with average viewership of 34 million viewers in the U.S. (up 79% from the Tokyo Games in 2021) NBC is off to a great start on TV and streaming.\n\nDriving that success was targeted marketing and promotion of the athletes, Paris, and Team USA.\n\n“As a result, NBC stations have been delivering big numbers for all the athletic competition, as well as their local news and all of their shoulder programming,” he said.\n\nAnd the streaming side has also found success.\n\n“At this point, we’ve got more than eight billion streaming minutes and counting with still plenty of time to continue to grow big numbers on that,” he said. “And speaking of billions, our ad sales has been very strong [and this is] our biggest ad sales total ever.”\n\nWith the athletic competitions taking place six hours ahead of the East Coast back home the effort around Primetime coverage is unique and Lazarus credits the team for creating two shows at once: following the live action during the day and then creating the primetime show which airs in the U.S. when the city of lights is asleep and resting up for the next day.\n\n“It’s a really complex piece of work,” says Lazarus.\n\nExplains Solomon: “Every time you have an Olympics, you get a new time zone, a new puzzle, really, to put together. And we’ve gone back in time to remind ourselves that America, it doesn’t matter if they know the results. They want to know the stories of the athletes and how it played out.\n\n“And so that’s why the prime time shows, I think, are resonating. You can watch live in the afternoon if you’re a sports fan and want a quick hit of it. But when you come back in prime time, you get to see how it all happens.”\n\nThe top storyline for U.S. viewers has, clearly, been the performance of the American women’s gymnastics team and women’s all-around gold medalist Simone Biles. And the way NBC Olympics produced the gymnastics coverage is a perfect example of the live/not-live workflow. The gymnastics events end around 8 pm in Paris which is 2 pm on the East Coast, giving the team there some time to re-package it in the most compelling way possible.\n\n“If you’ve ever watched gymnastics live, it’s pretty darn complex and complicated,” says Solomon. “But we’re able to take a few hours to really lay out how it happened and the stories of the athletes [for primetime].”\n\nCordella said Solomon and the team have done a fabulous job of taking prime time and doing something different with it that get viewers to tune in even if they know the results.\n\n“Historically the fear has been if results were known people would tune out and go somewhere else,” says Cordella. “But when you add the entertainment level that we’ve added to the prime-time show, we’re seeing people come back and see it in a different light. We added context around big events, so if you saw Simone and the team win the medal on Tuesday, you’re still happy to come back in the evening to see it again.”\n\nThe Social Media Effect\n\nThere was a time, not too long ago, when the perception was that social media and its need for short-form content like highlights would negatively impact TV ratings, especially for events that have already taken place. But Cordella says products like “Gold Zone” on Peacock, “Watch with Alex Cooper,” and NBC’s collaborations with YouTube and social media platform stars shows a different approach. The goal was to make the 7,000 hours of content sign in a new way on social media.\n\nAdded Solomon: “I think we’ve very much leaned into the fact that if things are happening on social and you have unique content on social, it all flows through to promoting the Olympics and what’s happening. And we really tried to integrate social into our broadcast as well because that’s how we all experience media.”\n\nShe pointed to coverage of French swimmer Leon Marchand’s double gold on Wednesday night as an example of how the NBC Olympics team is using social media.\n\n“Our creators culled all of the reactions across Paris, and that wasn’t possible without doubling down on creators and giving access to what’s happening in France on social media,” she said. “I think it’s really paid off in our broadcast presentation.”\n\nLazarus said that social media and streaming is about distilling down the event.\n\n“It’s about amplifying the broadcast and the broadcast amplifying them, working together,” he added. “And as a company we have all of these assets and platforms and that we’re working with to seamlessly push people back and forth, leading to this great set of viewership and numbers across all dayparts and platforms. We’re not ignoring one for the other. They’re working in concert together.”\n\nTechnical Legacy\n\nLazarus referred to the Olympics as a “billion-dollar lab” as the team gains an understanding of how to approach production as well as how to use technology effectively. And the end results and learnings, he said, can ripple across not only sports but other content as well.\n\n“I think this is going to [give us] an excellent set of data that we will certainly deploy against not only other sports properties but look at other live events that NBCUniversal has on our calendar,” he said. “We are a company that’s rich in big live events certainly around the holidays, with Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and Christmas at Rockefeller Center. Some of these technologies can be deployed against other live events and we’ll continue to experiment.”\n\nLazarus mentioned the Al Michaels A.I. product, where A.I. is used to clone Michael’s voice and have his voice do highlights without Al having to be physically involved, is something NBC is proud of developing.\n\n“That has allowed people to get the content that’s interesting [to them] and it’s a new innovation that we’re very proud of and the partnership with Al has worked well,” he said. “It has resonated with a lot of our Peacock subscribers.”\n\nCordella added that the Multiview feature on Peacock is a perfect example of something that was launched for the Olympics but could impact other sports.\n\n“You’re likely to see it in Premier League coverage on Saturday mornings as that’s one we invested in,” he said. “And I think adding entertainment, making shows fun…what Molly and the team have done in prime time is something we’re looking to do that a lot more in other concepts throughout the year.”\n\nThe Olympics is still a day away from the half-way mark and today the focus begins to shift to a final week filled with track and field, soccer finals, golf, and events like weightlifting, the marathon, and, new this year, breaking. And the NBC Olympics team, in both Paris and Stamford, is working hard to deliver all of that action, and more, to viewers.\n\n“All of our success we’ve had thus far wouldn’t be possible without the tireless work of our teams both here in Paris and across the Atlantic to Stamford,” added Cordella."
