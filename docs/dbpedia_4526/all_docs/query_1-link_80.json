        "text": "Nearly six decades later, the Apollo 11 moon landing still stands at the most-watched TV program of all time.\n\nAcross all networks, upwards of 150 million people tuned in to watch humans touch down on the surface of the moon. No other TV program in U.S. history has even come close to touching that record.\n\nIn second place is Super Bowl LVIII, which drew just over 123M for the Chiefs third title in five years. In fact, there are 18 Super Bowls among the Top 25 most-watched TV programs in history — and no, it’s not just the last 18 consecutive years as the record holders range from 1986 to 2023. Over the years, 12 Super Bowls have managed over 100M viewers.\n\nAs of now, to crack into the Top 25 takes more than 92M viewers, which is an increasingly hard metric for TV to hit. That’s why, as time goes on, it’s very likely that even more Super Bowls will snatch up spots on this list.\n\nAmong the others currently on the list are former President Nixon’s resignation, the O.J. Simpson police chase, and the M*A*S*H finale. See below for all 25.\n\n1.

With 115.1M viewers on Fox, it stands as the most-watched Super Bowl ever and second most-watched TV program in history.\n\n4.
