        "text": "American television network\n\nTelevision channel\n\nThe Prime Time Entertainment Network (PTEN) was an American television network that was operated by the Prime Time Consortium, a joint venture between the Warner Bros. Domestic Television subsidiary of Time Warner and Chris-Craft Industries. First launched on January 20, 1993, and operating until 1997, the network mainly aired drama programs aimed at adults between the ages of 18 and 54. At its peak, PTEN's programming was carried on 177 television stations, covering 93% of the country.[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOrigins\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the time of PTEN's founding, co-owner Chris-Craft Industries owned independent television stations in several large and mid-sized U.S. cities (among them its two largest stations, WWOR-TV in New York City and KCOP-TV in Los Angeles) through its BHC Communications and United Television divisions, which formed the nuclei of the network.[2]\n\nPTEN was launched in 1993 as a potential fifth television network (the second since the demise of Star Television Network, launched in 1990, but shutdown the year after, in 1991), and was created in reaction to the launch of the Fox network (which debuted in October 1986, seven years before PTEN launched) as well as the successes of first-run syndicated programming during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It offered packaged nights of programming to participating television stations, beginning with a two-hour block on Wednesday evenings, with a second block (originally airing on Saturday, before moving to Monday for the 1994-95 season) being added in September 1993.[3] Originally, the station groups involved in the Prime Time Consortium helped finance PTEN's programs; however, that deal was restructured at the beginning of the network's second year.\n\nThe service sought affiliations with various television stations not affiliated with the Big Three television networks. However, close to half of PTEN's initial affiliates were stations that were already affiliated with Fox; as a result, these stations usually scheduled PTEN programming around Fox's then five-night prime time schedule (although Fox would expand its schedule to seven nights with the addition of programming on Tuesdays and Wednesdays on January 19, 1993, the day before PTEN launched). PTEN launched on January 20, 1993, with two series: the science fiction series Time Trax and the action drama Kung Fu: The Legend Continues.[2]\n\nDemise\n\n[edit]\n\nPTEN faced two obstacles created by its parent companies which would affect the network. On November 2, 1993, the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner announced that it would form its own fifth network, The WB, as a joint venture with the Tribune Company,[4] Six days earlier, on October 27, Chris-Craft Industries announced the launch of the United Paramount Network (UPN), in a programming partnership with Paramount Television division of Viacom (which would become part-owner of the network in 1996). As a result, the core Chris-Craft independent stations (as well as those owned by Paramount) would serve as charter stations of the new network; Chris-Craft also chose to pull out of the partnership to focus on operating UPN.\n\nThe network also faced issues from some PTEN-affiliated stations that took issue with the network's barter split, which gave nine minutes of advertising time per hour to the syndicator, leaving only five minutes for the stations to sell and program locally. PTEN also ran into difficulty when the studio was forced to let stations out of their back-end commitments for several series. PTEN adopted a variable schedule for the 1995-1996 season, for affiliates to schedule around The WB and UPN's programming on the night of their choosing. With Chris-Craft pulling out of the venture, PTEN essentially became a syndication service for its remaining shows, before ceasing operations altogether in 1997. One of the two series that aired during the service's final year of operation, the science fiction drama Babylon 5, would later be revived by TNT, where it aired for a fifth and final season beginning in 1998.\n\nProgramming\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer programming\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries\n\n[edit]\n\nBabylon 5 (February 22, 1993, as a television film; January 26, 1994 – October 27, 1997, as a weekly series)\n\nKung Fu: The Legend Continues (January 27, 1993 – January 1, 1997)\n\nPointman (January 24, 1994, as a television film; January 26 – November 27, 1995, as a series)\n\nTime Trax (January 20, 1993 – December 3, 1994)\n\nFilms and mini-series\n\n[edit]\n\nThe History of Rock 'n' Roll (March 6, 1995) 10 hour documentary[5]\n\nIsland City (March 2, 1994)\n\nThe Wild West (March 22–26, 1993)\n\nAffiliates\n\n[edit]\n\nCity of license / Market Station[6] Channel Albany, NY WXXA-TV 23 Alexandria, LA K47DW 47 Amarillo, TX KCIT 14 Anchorage, AK KYES 5 Atlanta, GA WATL 36 Augusta, GA WFXG 54 Augusta, GA WJBF 6 Bainbridge, GA WTLH 49 Bakersfield, CA KUZZ-TV 45 Baltimore, MD WNUV 54 Baton Rouge, LA WGMB 44 Billings, MT KSVI 6 Birmingham, AL WABM 68 Bloomington, IL WYZZ-TV 43 Bloomington–Indianapolis, IN WTTV 4 Boise, ID KTRV-TV 12 Boston, MA WSBK-TV 38 Bryan, TX KYLE[A] 28 Buffalo, NY WUTV 29 Cadillac, MI WGKI 33 Cape Coral, FL WFTX 36 Cape Girardeau, MO KBSI 23 Cedar Rapids, IA KOCR 28 Charleston, WV WVAH-TV 11 Charlotte, NC WJZY 46 Charlottesville, VA WVIR-TV 29 Chico, CA KCVU 30 Cincinnati, OH WSTR-TV 64 Cleveland–Canton–Akron, OH WUAB 43 Colorado Springs, CO KXRM-TV 21 Columbia, SC WACH 57 Columbus, GA WLTZ 38 Columbus, OH WBNS-TV 10 Corpus Christi, TX K47DF 47 Danville, KY WDKY-TV 56 Davenport, IA KLJB-TV 18 Dayton WKEF 22 Denver KDVR 31 Derry WNDS 50 Des Moines KDSM-TV 17 Detroit WXON 20 Dothan WDHN 18 El Centro KECY-TV 9 El Paso KCIK-TV 14 Elmira WETM-TV 18 Eureka KBVU-TV 29 Evansville WFIE 14 Fairbanks K07UU 7 Fargo KVRR 15 Flint WSMH 66 Fort Collins KFCT[B] 22 Fort Pierce WTVX 34 Fort Smith KPBI-LP 46 Fort Worth–Dallas, TX KTXA 21 Gary, IN–Chicago, IL WPWR-TV 50 Grand Rapids WXMI 17 Great Falls KFBB-TV 5 Green Bay–Appleton, WI WGBA 26 Green Bay–Appleton, WI WACY 32 Greensboro–High Point–Winston-Salem, NC WGGT[C] 48 Greenville WYDO[D] 14 Hartford–New Haven WTIC-TV 61 Helena K21DU[E] 21 Henderson–Las Vegas KVVU-TV 5 Hilo KHBC-TV[F] 2 Honolulu KHNL 13 Houston KTXH 20 Huntsville WZDX 54 Jackson, MS WAPT 16 Jackson, TN WMTU 16 Jacksonville WNFT 47 Jamestown KJRR 7 Johnstown WWCP-TV 8 Kansas City KSMO-TV 62 Kingsport, TN WKPT-TV 19 Kingsport, TN W30AP 30 Kirksville, MO–Ottumwa, IA KTVO 3 Knoxville WKCH-TV/WTNZ 43 Kokomo WTTK[G] 29 Lafayette, LA KLAF-LD 46 Lansing WSYM-TV 47 Little Rock KLRT-TV 16 Louisville WDRB 41 Los Angeles KCOP-TV 13 Lubbock KJTV-TV 34 Lynchburg WJPR[H] 21 Madison WMSN-TV 47 Memphis WLMT 30 Miami WDZL 39 Midland, Texas KPEJ 24 Milwaukee WVTV 18 Minneapolis KMSP-TV 9 Mobile WPMI-TV 15 Monroe KARD-TV 14 Montgomery WCOV-TV 20 Morehead City WFXI 8 Nashville WZTV 17 New Orleans WNOL-TV 38 Ocala WOGX 51 Oklahoma City KOCB 34 Omaha KPTM 42 Orlando WOFL 35 Panama City WPGX 28 Pembina KNRR[I] 12 Philadelphia WPHL-TV 17 Phoenix KUTP 45 Pittsburgh WPTT-TV 22 Plattsburgh W27BI/WWBI-LP 27 Portland, ME WPXT 51 Portland, OR KPTV 12 Portsmouth–Norfolk, VA WGNT 27 Providence, RI–New Bedford, MA WNAC-TV 64 Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville, NC WLFL 22 Reno KAME-TV 21 Richmond WRLH-TV 35 Roanoke WFXR-TV 27 Rochester, NY WUHF-TV 31 Sacramento KRBK-TV/KPWB-TV 31 Salina KAAS-TV[J] 18 Salinas KCBA 35 Salt Lake City KJZZ-TV 14 San Angelo K55AA[K] 55 San Antonio, TX KRRT 35 San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose, CA KBHK-TV 44 Santa Fe, NM KASA-TV 2 Santa Maria, CA KCOY-TV 12 Savannah, GA WJCL 22 Secaucus, NJ–New York, NY WWOR-TV 9 Shreveport, LA KMSS-TV 33 Spokane, WA KHQ-TV 6 Springfield, IL WRSP-TV 55 Springfield, MO KDEB-TV 27 St. Louis, MO KPLR-TV 11 St. Petersburg–Tampa, FL WTOG 44 Sweetwater, TX KTXS-TV 12 Syracuse, NY WSYT 68 Tacoma–Seattle, WA KSTW 11 Thief River Falls, MN KBRR[L] 10 Tijuana–San Diego, CA XETV 6 Toledo WUPW 36 Tucson KTTU-TV 18 Urbana WCCU[M] 27 Visalia, CA KMPH-TV 26 Waco, TX KWKT-TV 44 Wailuku, HI KOGG[N] 15 Washington, DC WDCA 20 Waterbury, CT WTXX 20 Wichita, KS KSAS-TV 24 Wichita Falls, TX KJTL 18 Winston-Salem, NC WNRW 45 Vanderbilt, MI WGKU[O] 45 Yakima, WA K53CY 53 York, PA WPMT 43\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
