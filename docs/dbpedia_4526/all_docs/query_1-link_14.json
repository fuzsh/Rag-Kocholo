        "text": "Primetime TV in the US is in decline and has been for a number of years, but more choice especially with Cable & Netflix just means the audience is far more spread out.\n\nBut couldn't the same be said regarding streaming increasing in the UK also? I don't see any cable series getting millions of viewers in the US either. The UK also has lots of popular digital channels like ITV3 which can get up to a million viewers in primetime. Most US cable channels only get a few hundred thousand viewers at most and there are only a few really popular ones.\n\nThen you aren't really paying attention.\n\nI'd also just add that ITV3 does not regularly get a million+ viewers in or out of prime time.\n\nIn terms of US television ratings being 'poor' the answer for the decline is ultimately the exact same as it is in the UK. The key difference between the UK and US markets is that US audiences have, by and large, been quicker to adopt new technology than the UK market and so the declines have been more pronounced and happened at a much faster pace. As an example of this cable/satalite television became popular at a much faster rate in the US than it did in the UK which led to audience fragmentation much quicker than we've seen in the US this has also resulted in a lot more cable/digital channels in the US vs. the UK. It is worth taking a look at audience shares for broadcast in the US vs. the UK. There are times when the difference is very striking, audiences haven't abandoned the traditional big broadcasters in the UK in the same way they have in the US. The US was almost much quicker to adopt PVR than the UK which has led to more pronounced catch-up viewing at a much faster rate. Equally the US has seen cord cutting for cable taking place at a faster pace with faster adoption of streaming services. This has been sped up further by the big entertainment companies in the US all aggressively targetting streaming arguably at the expense of more traditional distribution something the UK hasn't really done.\n\nThere are a number of reason why US network shows rate badly, especially compared with in the past:\n\n1. Rise of streaming\n\n2. Much of US network output is crap, with hardly any 'watercooler' shows being produced\n\n3. US networks are all involved in streaming services now, and seem to be putting better shows on there to encourage subscribers\n\n4. Commercial load is just horrendous now on network tv, 20 minutes of ads an hour is common\n\n5. American Cable tv channels are much better funded than our own and offer way more competition to network tv, than our own non terrestrial channels do here\n\nThe one real outlier is the NFL, which rates extremely well."
