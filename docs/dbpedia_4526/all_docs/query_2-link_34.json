        "text": "By the end of the 1950s, television had become the favored form of mass communication for Americans. For the first time in history, people everywhere could view events live in their homes. The televised broadcasts of the Nixon-Kennedy debates, the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam War, the 1968 Democratic Convention and man's landing on the moon had a profound effect on Americans. Using advertisement for revenue, three broadcasts networks--ABC, CBS, NBC--and a few independent stations delivered an endless supply of entertainment and news to the American home.\n\nBianculli, D.
