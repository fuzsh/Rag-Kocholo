This important letter-writing initiative aims to grant open-water lifeguards the benefits and recognition of Emergency First Responders. Despite being the first line of defense in life-threatening ocean rescues, most open-water lifeguards in the U.S. are not considered First Responders and are not entitled to the benefits available to police officers, firefighters and EMTs.\n\nInspired by the heroic lifeguard characters in the upcoming action-drama series Rescue: HI-Surf, premiering on FOX Sunday, September 22, the network and USLA are supporting a campaign aimed at recognizing open-water lifeguards for what they clearly are: First Responders. The \"LIFEGUARDS FIRST\" campaign webpage allows citizens to submit a pre-populated letter to their representative urging them to support and co-sign House Concurrent Resolution 41, which officially recognizes open-water lifeguards as First Responders.\n\nNew pulse-pounding Hawaiian lifeguard drama Rescue: HI-Surf -- from prolific, award-winning executive producer/director John Wells (Shameless, The West Wing, ER) and executive producer/writer Matt Kester (Animal Kingdom, Outsiders) -- will make its series debut with a special premiere on Sunday, Sept. 22, immediately after the FOX NFL doubleheader (8:00-9:00PM ET/5:00-6:00PM PT, live to all time zones), followed by its time-period premiere on Monday, September 23 (9:00-10:00PM ET/PT).\n\n\"Our new action-drama Rescue: HI-Surf captures the incredible skill and bravery of open-water lifeguards, and every episode is inspired by the heroic, real-life first responders who save lives every day under seemingly impossible conditions,\" said Michael Thorn, President of FOX Television Network. \"But through our work on this series, we were troubled to learn that despite their essential, courageous work, they are not considered Emergency First Responders in most places and don't receive the recognition and benefits they deserve. With today's announcement of 'LIFEGUARDS FIRST,' we are supporting the USLA to turn the tide on this important issue.\"\n\n\"The USLA is excited to collaborate with FOX in rallying Congressional Co-Sponsors for House Concurrent Resolution 41, which will recognize open water lifeguards as official emergency response providers,\" stated Peter Davis, President of the USLA. \"This vital measure will ensure that lifeguards across the nation are acknowledged as first responders, granting them the respect and benefits commensurate with their critical role in public safety.\"\n\nYesterday, Monday, August 5th, FOX and USLA brought the campaign to Manasquan, NJ during the Manasquan Lifeguard Tournament, and will bring the initiative to beach pop-ups in New Jersey on Saturday, August 24th and Los Angeles on Saturday, August 31st. The beach pop-up events will include shaved ice trucks, immersive photo opps, appearances from the Rescue: HI-Surf cast and other VIPs, and opportunities to spread awareness and further support the movement by visiting the branded microsite to put locals' voices behind this cause and contacting their local representative about getting open-water lifeguards classified as First Responders.\n\nRescue: HI-Surf follows the personal and professional lives of the heavy-water lifeguards who patrol and protect the North Shore of O'ahu - the most famous and dangerous stretch of coastline in the world. Each episode will feature these dedicated, heroic and adrenaline-seeking first-responders saving lives in the difficult and often life-threatening conditions of Hawaii's Seven Mile Miracle. The series stars Robbie Magasiva (Wentworth, Bad Behaviour), Arielle Kebbel (The Vampire Diaries, John Tucker Must Die), Adam Demos (Sex / Life, UnReal), Kekoa Kekumano (The White Lotus, Aquaman), Alex Aiono (Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin, Doogie KameƒÅloha M.D) and Zoe Cipres (Roswell, New Mexico). In addition, Sea Shimooka (3 Body Problem, Arrow), Shawn Hatosy (Animal Kingdom) and Ian Anthony Dale (The Resident) will appear in recurring roles. Rescue: HI-Surf is co-produced by Warner Bros. Television and FOX Entertainment Studios. Matt Kester created the series. Kester, John Wells and Daniele Nathanson are executive producers and co-showrunners. Erin Jontow (John Wells Productions) is also an executive producer. Wells directed the series' first two episodes, and Kester and Nathanson are writers on the series with Kester writing the series premiere.\n\nAbout FOX Entertainment:\n\nWith a legacy spanning nearly 40 years, FOX Entertainment is one of the world's most recognizable media brands and a prolific content producer across its iconic broadcast network and both owned and third-party platforms worldwide.

Lifeguards are unique members of the public safety system as they stand watch and patrol for hours to prevent drowning and injury in the aquatic environment, and at any moment may have to race into the ocean to rescue a swimmer in distress or provide emergency aid for a victim suffering from a medical crisis. This concurrent resolution recognizes lifeguards as members of a selfless and heroic fraternity, who like their fellow first responders, purposefully race into danger to save a life."
