Now, 30 years later, the band returns with a new offering entitled Radio Silence, which features 11 tracks of pure adrenalized classic rock influenced music, and also features special guest appearances by guitar legend George Lynch, King’s X frontman dUg Pinnick and Korn drummer Ray Luzier.\n\nby Taboola\n\nPromoted Links\n\nYou May Like\n\nWide Thumb\n\nClearart\n\nFanart\n\nBanner\n\nUser Comments"
