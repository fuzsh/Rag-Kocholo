        "text": "Synchronicity, the fifth and final studio album from The Police has received lavish expanded editions for its 40th anniversary. The album, originally released in 1983, was the group’s most successful release, topping the Billboard chart for a whopping 17 non-consecutive weeks thanks to the success of the #1 single, “Every Breath You Take” and such popular tracks as “Wrapped Around Your Finger” and “King of Pain.” The Synchronicity 40 expanded editions, which arrived July 26, 2024, via Interscope/Geffen/A&M, feature a wealth of bonus material including dozens of previously unreleased alternate takes, out-takes, instrumentals and Sting’s never-before-heard original demos, as well as dozens of live concert recordings from 1983. A 6-CD set is available in the U.S. here and in the U.K. here. A 4-LP collection is available in the U.S. here and in the U.K. here. [A 2-CD set is available in the U.S. here and in the U.K. here. There’s a picture disc as well: U.S. and U.K.]\n\nIn their brief career, The Police—Sting, Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland—released just five studio albums. Signed to A&M Records, the British group, formed in 1977, released their 1978 debut album, Outlandos d’Amour, which featured the single, “Roxanne.” They recorded three more albums over the next three years and thanks to incessant touring and such hits as “Don’t Stand So Close To Me” and “Every Little Thing She Does is Magic,” the trio became one of the music world’s biggest acts. Their timing was also perfectly synchronized with the launch of MTV and on June 17, 1983, when Synchronicity was released, The Police were on top of the music world.\n\nThe album received five Grammy Award nominations in 1984 and won three (Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, Song of the Year (“Every Breath You Take”) and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal). It ultimately sold 15 million copies worldwide, with 8x certified Platinum in the U.S.\n\nListen to the “Every Breath You Take” demo\n\nThe limited edition Synchronicity 40 Super Deluxe 6-CD set includes a 60-page, lavish hardback color book featuring new liner notes and interviews, unseen visual material and archival memorabilia, rare and unseen photos, printed inner wallets and four art print photographs, all housed in a hardback slipcase.\n\nCopeland talks about the album’s photo shoot.\n\nRelated: The inside story of MTV’s disastrous Police contest\n\nListen to Sting’s demo of “King of Pain”\n\nListen to many previously unreleased demo recordings, alternate versions and live performances below.\n\nThe Police Synchronicity 40 Super Deluxe 6-CD Edition Track Listing\n\nCD 1 (Original Album Remastered)\n\n1.
