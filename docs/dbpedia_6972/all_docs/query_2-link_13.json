        "text": "Leonard \"Lenny\" Christopher James Nolan Tucker Feder is a high-powered talent agent and one of the five main characters in the two \"Grown Ups\" films. He is married to fashion designer Roxanne Chase and they have one daughter, Becky Feder and two sons, Greg Feder and Keithie Feder. He is embarrassed of his successes when he is around his childhood friends.\n\nChildhood[]\n\nNot much is known about Lenny's childhood beyond the fact that he was born on September 9, 1966, when he met his best friends Eric Lamonsoff, Kurt McKenzi, Marcus Higgins and Rob Hilliard in kindergarten (also to Dickie Bailey but how they went to different classes stopped being friends) in sixth grade he had an affair with a girl named Penny they shared a chewing gum at recess she asked him for a note if he liked her hair better with a barrette or with a band he replied that with a barrette (which she As an adult he still has and believes that he still feels something for her) it is not known what happened to their romance and that a bully who came from Texas named Tommy Cavanaugh bothered him but he never defended himself (according to Lenny he used steroids and had pimples on his barros and that it was all a joke) In 1977 the 5 friends formed a basketball team that ended up winning a youth championship during the celebration in a house by a lake their coach encourages them to live their lives the same way they played the game. After graduation, the five friends lived their lives separately and lost contact.\n\nGrown Ups[]\n\nAll Lenny Wants Is His Kids To Get Away From Electronics And Play Outside At The Lake House He Grew Up At. He Is Married To Roxanne Who Is A Fashion Designer. His Job Is A Hollywood Movie Agent. That Is One Of The Big Reasons His Nickname Is Hollywood. He Is Also Very Rich And Lives His Family And Friends.\n\nLikes: Chutes And Ladders, Basketball, Waterparks, Women, Money, Burgers, Outdoors, Fishing\n\nGrown Ups 2[]\n\nThree years after the events of the first film, Lenny Feder has relocated his family back to his Connecticut's face and Grepeeeeegy jumped into a pool to save the deer from splashing. Eventually, Lenny is able to get the deer out of the house just in time to take his children Greg, Keith, and Becky to their last day of school. Roxanne brings up the idea of their family having another baby, but Lenny says their family is perfect as it is, upsetting Roxanne. Then, the guests arrive.\n\nAfter dropping off their kids, Lenny, Eric, Kurt, and Marcus spend the day roaming around town, reminiscing about the amazing summers they used to have when they were kids and Lenny's childhood bully, Tommy Cavanaugh. Lenny argues that he could take Tommy as a kid and he can still take him. Eventually, the friends go to see Becky's ballet recital, where Lenny runs into Tommy, whom Lenny is visibly terrified of. Tommy threatens that if Lenny ever lies again about being able to beat him up, he'll publicly beat Lenny up.\n\nLenny arrives home to help Roxanne set up for a 1980s-themed party for their friends. As all of their friends begin to arrive, Roxanne urges Lenny to consider having another baby. Lenny continues to protest the idea and is left dumbfounded when Roxanne reveals that she is pregnant. Lenny, feeling overwhelmed by this discovery, goes off to drink with his friends.\n\nThe Feder's party goes well most of the night until Tommy Cavanaugh shows up and disrespects Lenny in front of everyone, so Lenny challenges Tommy to a fight. In a surprising turn, Tommy decides to take a dive so that Lenny can look tough for his kids, and the two develop a mutual respect. Soon after, the angry frat boys arrive at the house looking for retribution for the damage to their frat house.\n\nAfter all the commotion dies down, the four friends have pancakes at Eric's mom's house. Mrs. Lamonsoff reassures Lenny that a new baby is a wonderful thing and eventually he will never be able to imagine life with just three kids (and also mentions that Eric was an accidental baby because they were in the bathroom at a New England Patriots game). Lenny has a change of heart and returns home, telling Roxanne he is sorry and excited about the new baby, and they reconcile.\n\nGallery[]\n\nLenny Feder/Gallery\n\nAudio Gallery[]"
