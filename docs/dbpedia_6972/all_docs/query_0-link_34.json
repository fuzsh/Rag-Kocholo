        "text": "WELCOME. I am a classical-contemporary composer who writes music for a range of chamber and large ensembles, and who also writes for jazz combo and big band. I’m from a musical family and started composing when I was twelve years old. My father, Rocky Winslow, has a background touring with jazz big bands and now makes his living playing and teaching jazz trumpet as a professor at California State University, Chico, while my mother played percussion in groups like The Blue Man Group and taught private lessons. Both parents encouraged my creativity, and I naturally spent a lot of time avoiding the summer heat by writing stories and drawing. I did not gravitate towards music the way I did towards my other interests, but once it came time for Jr. High School, my feelings changed. My Jr. High School had a great band music program, and it was there an interest in music really began for me. I started borrowing different instruments and writing just a few measures at a time for my friends to play. By the time I was about to enter High School, I had written my first wind ensemble piece. This interest continued, nurtured by continued musical experiences in symphonic and jazz ensembles, and I started taking private composition lessons from composer and director Leonard Duarte.\n\nAfter High School I pursued my composition interest as an undergraduate at California State University, Chico, with Professor David Dvorin. As Chico State offered a Bachelor of Arts degree, I spent five years studying multiple subjects in addition to music, like human physiology and astronomy. I was even fortunate enough to enrich my education with a double major in Asian Studies and spent a year abroad in Japan. ですが、日本語で話しましょう! Looking back, I see a major part of the repertoire I have to offer were inspired by all of these different subjects I studied. During this time I continued playing my trumpet as well, and through performing I was exposed to several orchestral and band composers like Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Holst, and John Adams, as well as legendary new and old jazz composers like Count Basie, Maria Schneider, Bill Evans, and Thelonious Monk.\n\nMusical composition for me is an act of discovery. It makes me push through feelings of doubt or insecurity to allow entirely new creations to find their way onto paper. Then I interact with software, peers, and professionals to bring them to life, a collaborative and community-oriented process that creates connections and friendships. When I listen to a piece of music I have written and I feel entertained, or even like I’m transcending something, it really feels like I’ve spent my time creating something valuable. Music too, in general, just seems to add magic and spice to life. That’s why I do it, and if something of mine makes you feel entertained or like you’re transcending something too, then my dream is fulfilled. Thank you for visiting my website today."
