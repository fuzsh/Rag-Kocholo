        "text": "The band members of Jumping Jack Flash (“JJF”) are not entirely sure what it is about the music of The Rolling Stones that causes such a great reaction in audiences, but they see it on a nightly basis. They see it in the audience’s eyes, and on their faces. The audiences can’t help but get up and dance, sing along, and feel the pure joy of hearing the soundtrack to their lives. Maybe it’s the raw energy of the Stones or the swagger of Mick Jagger. Or maybe it’s the fact that everyone on stage and in the audience gets to celebrate some of the greatest music of all time!\n\nJumping Jack Flash had their debut on January 15, 2005, at the then-called Freighthouse Saloon in San Juan Capistrano, CA. Since then, the band evolved and grew into the international touring, critically acclaimed show that fans and venues agree is the number one Rolling Stones tribute band in the world! The raw high energy, the swagger, the pure rock & roll; JJF brings it all just like the real Stones, and audiences can’t get enough!\n\nJoey “Jagger” Infante (Mick Jagger), Young Hutchison (Keith Richards), Christian Hernandez (Brian Jones & Ronnie Wood), Jon McCracken (Charlie Watts), and Matt Quilter (Bill Wyman) have not only mastered every detail in the look of the Rolling Stones but in their sound as well. Bringing audiences the closest experience to the real thing you can possibly get!\n\n…besides the actual Stones of course!\n\nSince their debut, Jumping Jack Flash has brought their Rolling Stones recreation to the elegant Winspear Performing Arts Center in Edmonton, Canada, a SOLD-OUT show at the Pacific Amphitheater in Irvine, CA, and to 14,000 fans at the Fiesta del Sol in Mexicali, Mexico; along with many more incredible venues and private events.\n\nIncluding a notable show in 2015 when Jumping Jack Flash performed at the famous west-coast venue the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, CA just three days before the actual Rolling Stones did!\n\nMeet the cast members of Jumping Jack Flash: THE tribute to the Rolling Stones!\n\nJon McCracken\n\nas CHARLIE WATTS\n\nIn his early 30s, Jon, a Los Angeles native, developed a deep love for music. His passion ignited at the tender age of six and was influenced by Ringo Starr. The drums became his instrument of choice as he honed his skills throughout school. Jon's dedication to music led him to participate in various musical ensembles such as the high school jazz band, marching band/drum line, and orchestra.\n\nContinuing his pursuit of excellence in music after graduating from high school, Jon enrolled at Musician's Institute in Los Angeles. Since then, he has been working as a full-time professional musician. His talent has taken him to renowned venues across the continent including the prestigious Carnegie Hall in New York City.\n\nPresently, Jon continues to reside in Los Angeles for some reason and pursues his musical career performing with major acts, live and in the studio, such as Jumping Jack Flash, The Chambers Brothers, The Fab Four, The Who Experience, and The Police Academy. All while running his own business, MC Produced, which creates and manages all of JJF's media.\n\nPhoto by Van Brianne Photo"
