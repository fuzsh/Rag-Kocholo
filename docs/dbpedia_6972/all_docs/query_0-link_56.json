        "text": "Note: Below is an archived post from 2023…\n\nThe post below is from the Q105 archives from my first flight with Breeze Airways back in 2023 when they first launched service from Tampa. It’s a year later since I wrote this piece. I gave Breeze a second chance.\n\nUpdated Version:\n\nMy 2024 Breeze Airways Review\n\nOriginal article from back in July 2023:\n\nWhen Breeze Airways announced their non-stop service to my hometown of Portland, Maine, I jumped on it fast. A roundtrip direct flight both ways to New England for only $120? No stops in New Jersey or DC? Sign me up. I was so excited I bought two roundtrip flights the day they went on sale. Breeze Airways was new to me but for that price and convenience, I was willing to give them a shot.\n\nSo how did it go?\n\nI love flying in and out of Tampa International Airport so I knew that part would be great. The Breeze Airways staff was friendly. The planes were nice. The flights were cheap and on time. But there were two big negatives that will probably keep me from flying with Breeze again. Let’s go over the positives and those 2 big strikes. Only one of the two will probably be an issue for you.\n\nUP NEXT: Another Miserable Flight on Breeze Airways\n\nSo the two big strikes against Breeze Airways? No WiFi and the uncomfortable seats. The seats having those annoying headrests digging into my shoulders probably won’t be an issue for you. I’m crazy tall. If you’re of normal height, I think the headrests being so big will probably be a positive.\n\nWould I fly with Breeze Airways again?\n\nMaybe. As for not having WiFi or any kind of entertainment on board, that’s kind of unforgiveable to me in 2024. I know Breeze Airways is going for that no frill discount airline business model, but pick at least 1 – have a video monitor or give me some WiFi so I can entertain myself for those 3 hours. Even if I have to pay a few bucks for the WiFi, it’d be a game changer and would make me consider flying with Breeze again.\n\nMy second fight with Breeze Airways\n\nHear Geno on the air weekday afternoons. Geno's passions include fat guy food, concerts, sports, travel to Europe and South America, and old school music. Geno's radio career began in his hometown of Portland, Maine. Since then he's been on the air from Boston to Tampa to California."
