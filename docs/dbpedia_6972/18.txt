Artist Biography

Available in:

Originally formed in the late '80s, Roxanne garnered commercial success with their 1988 self-titled debut album, which was well received with two songs charting on rock radio; “Cherry Bay” and “Sweet Maria”, as well as a cover of Wild Cherry’s “Play That Funky Music” which hit #63 on the Billboard singles charts and was in full rotation on both dance and rock stations simultaneously.

As with many bands from that era, facing the decline in interest for AOR rock due to the onslaught of the grunge scene, the guys in Roxanne went on hiatus. Now, 30 years later, the band returns with a new offering entitled Radio Silence, which features 11 tracks of pure adrenalized classic rock influenced music, and also features special guest appearances by guitar legend George Lynch, King’s X frontman dUg Pinnick and Korn drummer Ray Luzier.
