"I grew up barefoot and naked in San Francisco, California with a European father and hippie mother, and moved to New York at eighteen looking for something a little more upbeat," Roxanne Conso recalls. Meanwhile, her future groom, Romain Pavee, was growing up right outside of Lyon, dreaming of coming to America for work one day. After stints in Paris and St Tropez, Romain also landed in Manhattan. And, like many New York City love stories, Roxanne and Romain met at work. Both worked in the bustling, exciting and chaotic hospitality industry and became inseparable. "My father is originally from Belgium, and Romain's French charm made me feel at home," Roxanne remembers. Romain now works as the Director of Guest Services for Avenue and Marquee, Strategic Group's main New York City venues. His now-wife serves as his counterpart, working as the Lead Host for Butter Group, at NYC hot spot Up&Down.

The couple had been dating for four years when Romain proposed. "We were already living together and enjoying a full life of love and laughter, and both knew we eventually wanted to be married," Roxanne explained, "but the proposal caught me totally by surprise!" The bride's California roots lead to a deep connection with the golden hour at Main Beach in East Hampton; "while spending one weekend in Bridgehampton, Romain suggested we grab some lemonades and head to Main Beach to catch that special light right before sunset. We were sitting on the beach, and I remember saying, 'I think the ocean…' and before I could finish my sentence, Romain had an engagement ring in his hand and was saying, 'what do you think about this? Will you marry me?' The sky was a gorgeous orange color, draping the edge of the sand and sea with a golden glow–of course, I said yes."
