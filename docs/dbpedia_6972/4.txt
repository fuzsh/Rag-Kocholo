Roxanne was formed in Riverside, California in 1986 by vocalist Jamie Brown and bassist Joe Infante, joined by guitarist John Butler and drummer Dave Landry. By 1987 they had risen to the top of the heap in the LA music scene and landed a deal with Scotti Brothers Records (a now defunct subsidiary of CBS). Roxanne disbanded after a year of touring in a van with no support from the label.

Debut Album:

Roxanne released their debut album Roxanne in February 1988.

While enjoying moderate success with the single “Cherry Bay” at AOR radio, they simultaneously rose to number 63 on the Billboard singles charts with their cover of Wild Cherry’s “Play That Funky Music“. The album was filled with mainly party rockers, and highlights such as the ballads “Over You”, “Not The Same”, “Cherry Bay” and “Can’t Stop Thinking”. The track radio found most interesting was a cover of Wild Cherry’s “Play That Funky Music”. Krescendo Records re-released the 1988 album in 2008 with a digital remastering.

In 1988 Roxanne appeared on The Late Show and performed “Play That Funky Music” and “Cherry Bay” to a live studio audience.

Roxanne was also released in Japan as Burning Through the Night with a different cover and a slightly different track listing, including two songs unheard in the US: “Burning Through the Night” and “My Way”.

Return 30 Years Later with Radio Silence:

On October 26, 2018 Roxanne released their first album in 30 years, Radio Silence. It was released on Rat Pak Records. The album was preceded by four music videos (for the songs, “Super Bad,” “Someone To Kill,” “Thin Blue Line” and “Go Fuck Yourself,” the last of which featured guest appearances by dUg Pinnick of King’s X and George Lynch, formerly of Dokken).
