Additionally, borrowers who want in person service at a brick-and-mortar lender might find Wells Fargo is their best choice.\n\nCompare Personal Loan Rates\n\nWells Fargo Personal Loan Pros and Cons\n\nWells Fargo Personal Loan Pros\n\nEstablished brick-and-mortar lender. If having a well-established lender is important to you, Wells Fargo is one of the oldest and largest institutions you can use. Other large banks like Chase and Bank of America don't offer personal loans.\n\nRelationship discounts. Instead of the more common auto-pay discounts offered by lenders to anyone who sets up automatic payments on their loans, Wells Fargo offers discounts to current customers who pay their loans through their consumer checking accounts.\n\nLarge loan amounts. You can borrow up to $100,000 with Wells Fargo, which is significantly higher than many other comparable lenders. For example, you can borrow up to $35,000 with Discover.\n\nNo origination fee or prepayment penalty. You won't have to worry about origination fees with Wells Fargo. Origination fees are taken out of your overall loan proceeds. Additionally, you can pay off your loan early if needed.\n\nWells Fargo Personal Loan Cons\n\nA history of mismanaging customer information. Wells Fargo has been at the heart of numerous scandals over the past several years, including creating fake bank accounts to meet sales goals, predatory lending practices to minorities, and overcharging customers on home and auto loans.\n\nA history of mismanaging customer information. Wells Fargo has been at the heart of numerous scandals over the past several years, including creating fake bank accounts to meet sales goals, predatory lending practices to minorities, and overcharging customers on home and auto loans.\n\nNo online applications for non-customers. Only current customers are eligible to apply for loans through Wells Fargo's online portal or by phone. Non-customers must apply by visiting a branch and talking with a banker.\n\nHefty late fees. Wells Fargo will charge up to $39 late payment fee. Other personal loan lenders don't charge any late fees.\n\nHow to Apply for a Wells Fargo Personal Loan\n\nYou'll need to meet the following requirements to apply for a personal loan with Wells Fargo:\n\nMeet the legal adult age requirement for your state\n\nProvide a valid Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification number\n\nHave a physical US address\n\nAfter verifying you qualify, here are the next steps to follow:\n\n1. Check your rate. Wells Fargo allows borrowers to prequalify for its loans by applying through its website — though you'll have to be an existing customer to apply online. If you're not a customer, you'll need to visit a branch and talk with a banker to apply. You'll be able to get your rate without impacting your credit score. You'll need to input your name, email address, state of residence, desired loan amount and purpose, and other information.\n\n2. Look over your loan offerings and choose the one that makes sense. After you submit your initial information, Wells Fargo will send you potential loan terms. A shorter term length means bigger monthly payments — but you'll save more in interest. You'll need to send in a formal application, which may also require additional documents, like W-2s, pay stubs, or bank statements.\n\n3. Confirm your loan terms and plan for repayment. After you sign the document accepting your loan terms, your loan will be approved and funded. Make sure you've added your loan payments into your budget.\n\nIs Wells Fargo Trustworthy?\n\nThe Better Business Bureau, a nonprofit organization focused on consumer protection and trust, gives Wells Fargo an F grade. The BBB measures companies by evaluating businesses' responses to consumer complaints, honesty in advertising, and transparency about business practices.\n\nThe BBB gives Wells Fargo an F rating because of the business' failure to respond to 25 complaints and government actions against the business. Most recently, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in December 2022 ordered Wells Fargo to return $2 billion to customers and pay a $1.7 billion penalty for legal violations involving auto loans, mortgages, and deposit accounts. The bank illegally charged fees and interest penalties on auto and mortgage loans. Additionally, it misapplied payments to those loans for many customers.\n\nIf Wells Fargo's history bothers you, you may want to consider other options on Insider's list of the best personal loans.\n\nWells Fargo Personal Loan Alternatives\n\nWells Fargo Personal Loan vs. Discover Personal Loan\n\nYou can borrow up to $100,000 with Wells Fargo, which is a much higher maximum loan amount than a Discover personal loan. If you need a larger personal loan, Wells Fargo may be a better option.\n\nWells Fargo's repayment terms range from one to seven years, while Discover's terms range from three to seven years. If you want a shorter term length — and to save money on overall interest in the process — Wells Fargo may be the choice for you.\n\nA distinguishing feature of Discover is its 30-day money-back guarantee on its personal loans. If you decide within 30 days of receiving your loan that you no longer want it — perhaps you found a better rate elsewhere — you can return the funds via check and won't be charged any interest. Wells Fargo doesn't have a similar unique perk.\n\nWells Fargo Personal Loan vs. Upstart Personal Loan\n\nApproval on Upstart Personal Loan isn't dependent solely on credit scores. For people who have struggled with credit in the past, Upstart will factor in a few other pieces of information for a better shot at approval.\n\nUpstart also can charge origination fees up to 8%, while Wells Fargo doesn't charge any origination fees. See the best lenders offering personal loans with no origination fee.\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us: How We Rated Wells Fargo Personal Loans\n\nWe rate all personal loan products in our reviews and guides on a 1-5 scale. The overall rating is a weighted average that takes into account seven different categories, some of which are judged more heavily than others. They are:\n\nInterest rate (20% of rating)\n\nFees (20% of rating)\n\nTerm lengths and loan amounts (15% of rating)\n\nFunding speed (15% of rating)\n\nBorrower accessibility (15% of rating)\n\nCustomer support (7.5% of rating)\n\nEthics (7.5% of rating)\n\nEach category's weighting is based on its importance to your borrowing experience. Rates and fees have the most direct impact on the overall cost of your loan, so we weigh those the most heavily. Customer support and ethics are still very important parts of the borrowing experience, but do not directly tie to a personal loan's terms, so they have less of an impact on the overall rating.\n\nSee our full ratings methodology for personal loans for more details.\n\nWells Fargo Personal Loan Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Wells Fargo legit?
