        "meta_description": "I walked into the main floor, which give or take a few steps was the ground floor of a large and tall building. I have zero recollection of where I parked. San Francisco wasn't as crowded for finding a parking spaces in 1964. It was not important to my story. It is not as if I needed to find my getaway car quickly.\n\t\n\tThat is San Francisco, California USA. I believe it was a skyscraper building, pretty impressive, and likely the main Branch not just for San Francisco, but likely for all of the Wells Fargo Bank branches. The year was 1964, I think. I was still in High School, and barely had gotten my Driver's License. I was about 16½ years old.\n\t\n\tThe picture was aided by my wonderful friend, Curt J. or Curtis Johnson, here on Flickr. He said I could use one of his many gun pictures to illustrate my story. I no longer have the actual gun from 1964, and believe it or not, I never took a picture of it when I had it. Also, believe it or not, I did not ever write down the manufacturer, size, brand, etc. I think it was a Smith & Wesson six-shooter, but I'm not positive. I did, as a teenager, make note of some of the details about one part of the grip. Those recollections will be in my story. \n\t\n\tI spent hours and hours with an old photo program and my elderly skills trying to get a picture of one of his guns and of my bare hand holding it. Anyway, that is my real hand, and the gun is merely representative of the gun I had. Of the pictures of Curt's I could find, it looked the most like what I remember, but not exactly.\n\t\n\tI'm curious how many of you have ever walked casually into a famous bank with a gun very visible in your hand? \n\t\n\tMORE STORY to COME\n\t*****************************************************************\n\t\n\tIt was about 1963, I had just gotten my California Driver's License (see that Tiny True Story just in the last few days here on my Flickr site). During the previous year, my family had a visit from Alabama of an eccentric uncle on my Mother's side. I didn't realize how much she disliked him until much later in life. She told me she wanted to outlive him if it killed her. (BTW, she did not. She died at 86 and he was about 85 at the time, but he lived a few more years. Back to 1963ish, he was visiting California and staying in one of the most modest 3 bedroom suburban tract houses one could imagine. He probably sensed the animosity between himself and my parents, but I didn't. I was enthused to have an Uncle. He invited me to sit with him in one of the little bedrooms. It was not a sexual thing. He just wanted a captive audience, and my parents were not really giving him an audience of any sort. I was young and a bit gullible, but I still admired this Uncle of mine that I had hardly ever gotten to know. First he said he wanted me to have some property, and he *quitclaimed* over to me, a 20 acre gold-mining claim in Montana. He said he wanted me to have it because I believed his stories, etc. That mining claim is another story. \n\t\n\tBecause of my enthusiastic and non-judgmental response, he continued with something else he wanted to give me. He pulled out a pistol, not aimed at me, but just so i could see it. He had, in me, as a nice teenage girl who was rather deprived of family nearby that were very interested in me; so here he was telling me some interesting things. I had no real reason not to believe any of his stories. He said the gun had belonged to Jesse James. Wow, I thought, not because Jesse was such a nice guy, but because even at my young age, he was a very famous folk hero to some people. Certainly famous.\n\t\n\tUncle Jim no doubt noticed my interest and enthusiasm. He told me stories about one side of the handle on the gun was cherrywood and one was not. I forget which was which over these many decades, but he showed me that outlaws would often carve a notch in their gun handle for each person they had shot in gunfights. He said their were 12½ notches and he showed me. I watched many different series of Westerns on TV back then, and this was mesmerizing stuff. He said that because I had been such an enthusiastic listener that he was going to give me the gun. Never did I ever have one single thought of firing it. I was just enchanted with the history of it and provenance. \n\t\n\tIn this private bedroom scene, receiving the gold mining claim (no actual mine on it at the time), and then a real gun that belonged to a famous outlaw, I had definitely become a fan of Uncle Jim. Because I told the truth about 99% of the time, I assumed he did too. There was not a speck of sexual flirtation, other than that I suppose guns can be (but aren't always) symbolic. Uncle Jim did nothing flirtatious at all (I'm happy to say). Looking back at, I think charming me with cool gifts was a way to get back at my mother (his sister). Kind of like, well your daughter doesn't hate me so Nyah, nyah, nyah,\n\t\n\tHe left to go back to Alabama, and I had fun showing my friends the mining claim and the gun. Some people expressed doubt that the gun could have actually belonged to Jesse James. Others said outlaws often played cards (poker) and often may have won 8 or 12 different pistols from other outlaws, within an evening or two. \n\t\n\tThe doubts about the gun started haunting me a bit. I posed some questions occasionally. Someone (and I'm sorry, I don't recall who, or I would give them credit for the suggestion) said Wells Fargo Bank, Main Branch, in San Francisco actually had/has a small museum. You should show your gun to the curator, and I bet he could tell you if it's authentic or not. The described little museum sounded wonderful to me, a definite fan of TV westerns. When other kids might doodle smiley faces, or a cabin with smoke coming out of the chimney, or flowers, I would often doodle a stagecoach and try to draw some horses pulling it. The person telling me about the museum said it actually had a real Wells Fargo Stagecoach in it. I had never seen a real one, just television shows. and many, if not all of them were only in Black & White TV at the time. I really wanted to go to this museum.\n\t\n\tI had my brand new California Driver's License, symbolically still hot in my little hand, and I should have been terrified to drive across the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge for my first time by myself. But I wasn't. I don't even remember if I took any money for parking or bridge fare with me. But I believe the Wells Fargo Bank Main Branch was in a Skyscraper and I did find it. Remember, no Google or cellphones back then. \n\t\n\tOn the drive over the bridge from Piedmont. and Oakland, where I lived, and across the bridge, I was ruminating a bit about what to say and what to do, and I recalled, probably from Westerns or Police shows on TV, that several times I had heard it was against the law to carry a concealed weapon. I didn't ever want to get arrested for anything. I said to myself, \"Self, just carry it in the bank lying across your flat hand; so that anyone who sees it will know it isn't being brandished as a weapon at all. By the way my gun never had a bullet or cartridge (I'm still not sure which is the proper word) in it the entire time I owned it. It was empty when Uncle Jim gave it to me, also. I walked into the main floor of this famous bank, with my gun lying across my left hand, and didn't know where to find the museum I had been told about. So I went in the main floor area, off of a good sized lobby, and saw many tellers and customers transacting business. \n\t\n\tThere was an older gentleman seated near the entrance to all these tellers, and had he not been there, I was confident enough (does confidence = foolishness sometimes) that I would have gotten in line for a teller to ask where the museum was. The man I mentioned was a bank guard. In a very, very calm voice he said, \"Can I help you ma'am?\" Other than the gun, I probably did look very sweet, innocent and naive. I replied that I had received this gun (obviously to him what I was talking about) and was told it had belonged to Jesse James. I was also told that this Wells Fargo Branch has an Old West Museum, and that the Curator would probably know and perhaps authenticate my gun. The guard got up from his chair and he walked/escorted me down the hall to the museum and introduced me to the curator. The gun was still in my hand, but like in my photo above, not in any position to fire it at anyone. By the way, there was a very cool, authentic stagecoach in the little museum.\n\t\n\tThe guard left to go back to his position, and I'll bet he doesn't encounter too many people like me. The Curator at the museum said that likely my gun was a tourist item, for people who admired The James Brothers. He didn't think my gun was old enough on the one hand. On the other hand, he said outlaws played many card games, and often would receive winnings from other players, not from cash, but from weapons. \n\tI was disappointed.\n\t\n\t I think I owned my gun, 5 years or less, but because I did own it for a while, later in life some letters and an envelope and a receipt from the widow of Frank James were gifted to me. They are real as can be, and had I not already owned the questionable gun,  I would not likely have ever been given them. My parents were at a cocktail party many miles from our home, and the host/hostess couple talked about their family mementos from Frank James's widow. I think Frank outlived Jesse by 30 years, and died in 1915. I'm not up to looking it up on my computer right now. I've already posted the real items from Mrs. Frank James, here on Flickr. I guess they're around 107 years old now. And by the way, those authentic items were not even closely related to my Uncle that gave me the gun.\n\t\n\tTHE END\n\t\n\t*******************************************************************\n\tSeems like someone always wants to know what happened to the gun? After owning it for about 5 years, and feeling that most likely it was some sort of souvenir from a tourist stand in Alabama or Missouri, I was disillusioned and disappointed and sold it at flea market in Alameda. California for $5.00 cash. I know, I know, I probably should have kept it anyway, but my memories and my story here are worth more than just what $5.00 would have bought in the mid 1960s. To me, almost 60 years later, I'm OK with my time with the gun. It had a place in my life and was the catalyst for me to receive some authentic ephemera (is that the correct word) from the widow of Frank James. I would never have received those letters, news clipping from Frank's funeral and some kind of transfer slip from the Adjutant General of Kentucky that is very old. I would never have walked into a bank with a gun in my hand either.\n\t;o)\n\t\n\t****************************************************************************\n\tFor ABCs and 123s (group) \"H\" is for Hand as in \"Gun in My Hand\"\n\t\n\t(GunInHandSizeBitBetterMayPost053122)",
