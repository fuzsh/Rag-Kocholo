I have searched and every post pertained to Credit Cards so any info would be great.\n\nThanks\n\nRegardless of prior experiences of others, I would make the request.\n\nSince they have permitted you to establish a new account, then perhaps they will allow you to pay from that account under your condition that they terminate the collection authority granted to the debt collector.\n\nThat is, of course, conditional on the assumption that they have not sold the deb to that debt collector.\n\nIf they sold the debt, then they cannot now accept any payment or cancel the collection authority obtained by their purchase of the debt."
