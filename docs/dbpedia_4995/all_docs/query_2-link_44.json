The Will Call is located at the Box Office on the North side of the building, next to the VIP Entrance. We are unable to accept Will Call drop off from patrons.\n\nPatrons must present the actual credit card used to place the order, a valid photo ID and a purchase confirmation number.\n\nFor special occasions, check out our Premium Seating options to learn more about Club Box seats and Suites for Wells Fargo Center events.\n\nIf you are organizing a school trip, church outing, or other event with a group, we recommend you contact our Group Sales department for potential savings offers."
