        "text": "From the Search for Jobs page, you have two options:\n\nEnter search criteria such as the job opening ID or job title, a keyword you want to see in the job title or description, or a location in the Search field.\n\nApply the filters located at the top of the page.\n\nUnderstand targeted search\n\nIt is recommended to use targeted search. Because Search for Jobs is a global search tool, we recommend you use the search criteria and filters to narrow your list of job requisitions that match your areas of interest.\n\nNotes:\n\nYou may enter search field criteria without applying any filters or apply one or more filters without entering any search field criteria.\n\nWhen you use a combination of search criteria and filters, it is necessary to enter information into the Search field to conduct your search, and then narrow down your results by using the filters. Or you can apply filters first and then utilize the Search feature.\n\nThe job requisition list automatically updates when you make a selection in a filter category to display the requisitions that meet your criteria.\n\nYou can make multiple selections in any given filter. For example, you can select multiple locations for specific states and cities. You may also make selections within more than one of the filter categories.\n\nWithin each filter a number appears next to each of the selections indicating the number of requisitions associated with that selection. The filter selections are not alphabetical. They are ordered in decreasing order by number of requisitions aligned to the filter selections.\n\nTo clear your search criteria, click the Clear All button just below the filters at the top.\n\nUnderstand the Search field\n\nKeywords. You can narrow your search by using keywords that match those in the job title, job description, or qualifications.\n\nRequisition ID. This is an identification number assigned to each job requisition. The format of the ID is R-XXXX. You must enter the “R-“.\n\nUnderstand the filters\n\nNumbers in parentheses next to filter categories — e.g., California (43) — indicate how many job openings from your search results are in each filter category.\n\nYou may apply multiple filter categories to a search (e.g., Location, Job Family Group), and within any filter category, you can apply multiple selections.\n\nWhen you click any of the location filters, the tool populates job openings with those filter values (e.g., state, region, city). For example, if you select North Carolina for the state filter, the tool populates job openings that list North Carolina as the location. When a requisition shows Multiple, that position is open to more than one location.Location. There are four location filter categories: Region, Country, State, City. You can select multiple options for each category. You do not have to select a country or state before selecting a city. However, due to the number of cities we have business sites, it is recommended that you narrow a location search by country and/or state first.\n\nFull or Part-Time Status. Search job openings by different statuses: full-time or part-time\n\nJob Family Group. Search by Wells Fargo's job categories group. If a Job Family Group filter is applied, a user can search for jobs within a specific career area. Multiple job families can be selected to expand and enhance your search results.\n\nJob Family. Search by Wells Fargo's job categories. If a Job Family filter is applied, a user can search by specific job family within a career area. Multiple job families can be selected to expand and enhance your search results.\n\nEmployee Type. This is available under ‘More’ category. Search job openings by different statuses: regular, fixed term, or flexible\n\nSearch Results\n\nAfter you click the Search field or click on one or more filter options, the page refreshes with a list of jobs that meet your criteria.\n\nFrom this list you can:\n\nSee high-level information about the jobs that meet your search criteria.\n\nSee a detailed job description by clicking the individual listing which will display the requisition details in a split screen view enabling you to retain your original search results.\n\nAdding your experience and skill information: To enter information in the Work Experience, Education, Certifications, and Language Skills sections, click Add in the respective section and you will be prompted to provide relevant details. Note that if you add a resume, you are not required to fill out any of these sections with one exception. If you are applying for a job that is designated as an early talent job opening, you are required to provide additional school and degree information.\n\nWork Experience: If you are entering information about your current job click the I currently work here button and enter your start date. Click Add Another to add more work experience. Click Save and Continue when finished.\n\nEducation: This section will allow you to list one or all of the degrees you have earned, along with the field of study and the school where you acquired the degree. You can also enter multiple degrees. Note that if you are applying for an early talent job, you will be required to provide additional pertinent information about at least one degree. Enter in School or University name. Select Degree from dropdown menu. Click Add Another to add more education. Click Save and Continue when finished.\n\nCertifications: In this section, enter any licenses or certifications. To see a list of available licenses or certifications click within the search bar and click “Various”. This will expose the list of available selections. You can optionally provide the certification number, issue date and expiration date. Click Add Another to add more work certifications. Click Save and Continue when finished.\n\nLanguages: List any languages you are proficient in. You will be asked to indicate if the language entered is your primary language and what proficiency level (Beginner, Intermediate or Fluent) you are in Reading, Speaking and Writing in this language.\n\nSome positions require an On-Demand Screen (ODS), which is provided by a third-party vendor. An ODS is a type of preliminary interview where applicants record video responses to pre-set questions. If the job requisition you applied to requires the submission of an ODS, the third-party vendor will email you instructions. It is important you follow the instructions provided in the email as quickly as possible.\n\nMany positions require a phone screen interview with a recruiter. If you are selected for a recruiter phone screen interview you will be contacted to schedule a date and time. The method of scheduling may vary from being invited to self-schedule or you may be contacted by Recruiting directly to set up a date/time.\n\nSubmission of this information is voluntary and refusal to provide it will not subject you to any adverse treatment. You also may change or deselect previous choices to this question at any time. Information you submit will be treated as confidential. Disclosure and usage will be limited to: (i) supervisors and managers who need to know if you can benefit from work accommodations; (ii) first aid and safety personnel when necessary; (iii) government officials auditing compliance with applicable laws; (iv) disclosure where otherwise required by law; and (v) in support of Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunity regulations and Wells Fargo Diversity programs.\n\nYou are not required to disclose that you have a disability as part of the application process. However, if you need an accommodation at any time during the application process, you may be asked to disclose information about your medical limitations as part of Wells Fargo's Accommodations process.\n\nIf due to a chronic medical condition or disability you need accessibility or accommodation assistance in the job application or interview process, candidates in the United States can contact our Accommodations Management team by telephone at 1-877-255-1606 or via email at AccommodationRequest@wellsfargo.com.
