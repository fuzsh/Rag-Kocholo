        "text": "I first got the Bilt Rewards Mastercard in November 2021. When the program launched they were with another bank, and launched with Wells Fargo in March 2022. Wells didn’t buy the back book. I suspect the lack of revolve by cardmembers – early adopters like me aren’t a super profitable bunch! – led to this decision.\n\nSo there have been Bilt credit cards from two different issuers, although all new cards over the past 27 months have been Wells Fargo cards.\n\nThe legacy cards are being sunset December 31. Keeping a Bilt card means having to apply anew for the Wells product.\n\nThis option pops up in the Bilt app, and if you accept it’ll take you to a pre-filled application.\n\nThey give you 10,000 points for applying by August 31 (whether you’re approved or not)\n\nI went through and applied. This hurts me with Chase’s 5/24 limits, but I:\n\nKeep my Bilt engagement. They have better transfer partners than anyone, I love spending on the first of each month, and I love their transfer bonuses. I’ve benefited from 100% transfer bonuses or better with Air France KLM, Virgin Atlantic and Alaska (and sort of regret skipping Air Canada, Hawaiian). I love the benefits of Platinum, like a free Blade helicopter transfer.\n\nFinally get tap to pay. Probably the thing that kept me from using the card most was not being able to use this feature.\n\nPick up 10,000 more points… which will hopefully turn into 20,000 (or more) later on with a transfer partner.\n\nOnce I submitted my application I was immediately awarded 10,000 points. I was also instantly approved by Wells Fargo. I don’t currently have any cards with Wells Fargo, and they gave me a $50,000 credit limit which is great.\n\nI find Bilt to be the most interesting and engaging program out there currently. They introduce new features and partnerships regularly so I’m glad they decided to keep me as a co-brand cardmember.\n\nThe legacy card is still valid through December 31, 2024. They will ultimately be closed by their issuer. I suppose if there’s one extra step in this that I don’t love it’s that autopay for the Wells card requires setting up a separate Wells Fargo account, rather than just being all handled in the app.\n\nOf course there’s no requirement for legacy cardmembers to apply for a new Wells Fargo card. The old one still works through end of year, and there are plenty of ways to earn with Bilt outside of the co-brand.\n\nMore From View from the Wing\n\nAbout Gary Leff\n\nGary Leff is one of the foremost experts in the field of miles, points, and frequent business travel - a topic he has covered since 2002.
