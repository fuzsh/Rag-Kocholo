        "text": "Summer is peak concert time in Philadelphia. The sun is shining, temps are rising and open-air venues all over the city welcome top-tier talent to the stage.\n\nThe concert calendar is looking especially stacked with names like Missy Elliott, Olivia Rodrigo, P!NK and Bruce Springsteen all slated for the coming months.\n\nFestival season hits its stride with a homegrown event, the Lancaster Avenue Jazz & Arts Festival, which returns to West Philly for the annual celebration of jazz music, plus local vendors and food trucks. Fans of heavier music can head to Underground Arts and Franklin Music Hall for This is Hardcore, a festival dedicated to none other than hardcore.\n\nEven post-summer the concerts show no sign of slowing down. Charli XCX and Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Justin Timberlake are coming to town this fall.\n\nWhy go home after the encore? Book the Visit Philly Overnight Package and get free hotel parking and choose-your-own-adventure perks, including two tickets to The Franklin Institute, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, or the National Constitution Center and the Museum of the American Revolution. Or get cozy with the new Visit Philly 3-Day Stay hotel package, which includes buy-two-get-a-third-free hotel nights at participating hotels.\n\nLooking for more great concerts? WXPN’s concert calendar is your go-to stop for awesome concerts every day of the week in Greater Philadelphia.\n\nBelow, find the top concerts headed to Philly for 2024 — and check back often for updates throughout the year.\n\nNow in its fifth year, this traveling emo, pop-punk, and alternative rock festival stops in Philly for a full day of music and summer fun. This year, the festival is headlined by the bands Mayday Parade and The Maine with performances by The Wonder Years, We the Kings, Real Friends, Knuckle Puck, Daisy Grenade, Hot Milk, and Diva Bleach. General admission is standing room only, so be sure to bring a blanket and comfy shoes.\n\nWhere: The Mann Center, 5201 Parkside Avenue\n\nread more\n\nProving ’80s and ’90s nostalgia will never go out of style, New Kids On The Block heads out on its first solo headlining tour in a decade. (The band has had a couple of co-headlining jaunts in there, but this one is all New Kids.) Keeping in line with the pop music of the time, Paula Abdul and DJ Jazzy Jeff offer support.\n\nWhere: The Mann Center, 5201 Parkside Avenue\n\nread more\n\nContinuing his Gravel & Gold Tour from last summer, the country musician performs hits from every era of his 20-year career, like What Was I Thinkin’, Drunk On A Plane and Gold.\n\nWhere: Freedom Mortgage Pavilion, 1 Harbour Boulevard, Camden, NJ\n\nread more\n\nAugust 21 & 23, 2024\n\nAfter illness forced The Boss to postpone last summer’s Philly tour dates, Bruce Springsteen makes good on his word with these rescheduled dates at Citizens Bank Park. All previous tickets will be honored for the new dates. If you slept on buying tickets the first time around, now’s your chance to get in on the glory days.\n\nWhere: Citizens Bank Park, 1 Citizens Bank Way\n\nread more\n\nCome to their window — er, The Mann Center to see an epic pairing of Melissa Etheridge and Indigo Girls. Whether you’re into smoky vocals or folk harmonies, you’ll get a sampling of the best the ‘90s has to offer.\n\nWhere: The Mann Center, 5201 Parkside Avenue\n\nread more\n\nWhere were you in 2001? Alt-rock band Incubus was releasing Morning View, the band’s hit album that catapulted it to mainstream popularity and spawned a ton of hits including Wish You Were Here, Nice To Know You and Warning. The group, joined by the band Coheed and Cambria, returns to the City of Brotherly Love this August to celebrate its recent re-recording of the album.
