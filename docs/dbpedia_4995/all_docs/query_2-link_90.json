        "text": "Ahead of his show with Green Day at Citizens Bank Park, Billy Corgan called up Brent Porche at WMMR Philadelphia to give us an idea of what we can expect from the Smashing Pumpkins’ stadium set.\n\nBilly gave us a run-down of the album Aghori Mhori Mei, which was announced last month and release just two weeks later. The two also covered wrestling, of course, and Billy will be back in our town at the end of August for NWA 76 at 2300 Arena.\n\nJoin us at the show this Friday 8/9 at the ballpark! Tickets and details are on MMR’s official Concert Calendar. Between Green Day, the Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid and the Linda Lindas, Brent Porche will be broadcasting live from the concourse, so stop by and say hi. Plus: keep an eye on Pierre’s page for a backstage interview with Tre Cool.\n\nBilly Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins on WMMR\n\nRELATED: Brent Porche at WWE Money in the Bank\n\nCatch Brent Porche on-air and online weekdays between 3PM – 7PM on WMMR. Brent loves to celebrate important musical anniversaries and milestones on my show, especially on Double Shot Tuesdays! He is honored to continue to the legacy of ‘MMR’s Local Shots Artist of the Month feature every Wednesday on-air at 6:30pm and via the Local Shots Headquarters page online, anytime at WMMR.com."
