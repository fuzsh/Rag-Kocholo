He’ll report to CEO Bill Rogers\n\nSince 2019, Hagerman has served as CIO for consumer technology, chief technology officer, and head of consumer lending technology at Wells Fargo. During the previous 17 years, he held leadership positions at JPMorgan Chase.\n\nFormer CIO Scott Case left in April after leading the unit since the merger of BB&T and SunTrust created Truist in 2019. He was among several changes in senior Truist executive posts in the past year.\n\n“Steve has deep experience serving clients, inspiring teams, and driving business results through technology innovation and modernization,” Rogers said in a release. “His purposeful leadership, broad expertise and focus on client experience aligns with our strategy and our culture.”\n\nThe Marine Corps veteran is a graduate of Franklin University."
