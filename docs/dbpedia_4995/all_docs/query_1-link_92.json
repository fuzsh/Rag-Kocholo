        "text": "Wells Fargo customers may be eligible for payments as a result of a $2 billion settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe settlement covers more than 16 million Wells Fargo accounts that were subject to “illegal practices, including misapplied payments, wrongful foreclosures, and incorrect fees and interest charges.” CFPB said.\n\nWells Fargo customers from 2011 to 2022 are potentially covered by the settlement. Wells Fargo is required to notify its customers if they are included but if you believe you are eligible for a payment and have not received a letter yet, you should first contact Wells Fargo at 844-484-5089. If that that does not resolve the issue, you can submit a complaint online.\n\nThe amount of repayments will vary. For automobile repossessions, you could be reimbursed at least $4,000. Another $77.2 million will be paid to some 3,200 customers who had issues working with the company to modify their loan payments to avoid foreclosure.\n\nWhat types of loans could be included?\n\nAuto loans\n\nAuto loan borrowers that prepaid for GAP coverage – which insures the amount owed on a car loan if you have an accident or your car is stolen. Wells Fargo acted unfairly by not refunding money when the loan terminated early, for example if it was paid off ahead of schedule CFPB said.\n\nSome customers’ auto loan payments were not applied correctly to their balances, leading to higher interest charges, late fees and wrongful repossessions.\n\nSome auto repossessions were also mismanaged, including how the vehicles were sold after repossession.\n\nMortgage loan borrowers\n\nSome mortgage loan borrowers were unfairly turned down when they requested modifications to their loan to avoid foreclosure. They also may have been charged incorrect fees and other costs.\n\nWells Fargo wrongly reported some customers as deceased, overstated attorney fees that meant applications were denied instead of approved and brought thousands of wrongful foreclosure actions.\n\nBank account holders"
