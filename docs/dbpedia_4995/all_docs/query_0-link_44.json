        "text": "Wells Fargo Center signage will come down this weekend.\n\nRoad closures will take place from 7 to 11 a.m. July 14.\n\nNo new name is set to go up in place of Wells Fargo yet.\n\nThe Wells Fargo name will be removed from the downtown skyscraper at 1 Independent Dr. this weekend, causing road closures.\n\nWells Fargo Center, now known as 1 Independent, is in the process of being replaced as the primary tenant for the 37-story building after the banking company downsized its leased space earlier this year. Part of that undertaking is the removal of the building's current signage.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Jacksonville Sheriffâ€™s Office personnel will close the streets around the building during the project. The Main Street Bridge will also experience periodic closures throughout the process.\n\nIn addition to road closures, no access to the building will be permitted during the specified time frame until the sign removal is complete. Here are the details of the removal plans.\n\nSee vintage photos: Jacksonville's Wells Fargo Center was iconic from the start. See throwback photos here\n\nWhen will downtown streets be closed?\n\nAccess is expected to be restricted from 7 to 11 a.m. on Sunday, July 14.\n\nWhat streets will be affected?\n\nPortions of Bay, Laura and Main streets and Independent Drive as well as some crosswalks will be closed off in the area surrounding the building. The Main Street Bridge, which is in the flight path, will also experience periodic closures during this time.\n\nHow will the signage be removed?\n\nA helicopter will assist in the removal of each letter and transport them to a designated area near EverBank Stadium.\n\nWill the Wells Fargo name be replaced?\n\nAs of Wednesday, there are no plans to replace the Wells Fargo name with new signage, building management representatives said.\n\nWhat was Wells Fargo Center called in the past?"
