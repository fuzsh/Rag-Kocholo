        "text": "North Texas’ growing financial sector employment was a major factor in Wells Fargo’s decision to build its almost half-billion-dollar campus in Irving.\n\nThe California-based bank’s 850,000-square-foot, 22-acre office project started construction Tuesday on a lakeside site in Las Colinas.\n\n“We are thrilled to be able to join the other financial services companies,” said Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf. “It’s one of the great attractions to the community here — the talent base.”\n\nSan Francisco-based Wells Fargo will consolidate workers from more than a dozen North Texas operations into the new campus when it opens in two years, Scharf said.\n\n“Over the past five years, we’ve gone from 5,800 employees in the area to 6,800 with nearly all of that growth coming in technology, operations and risk management jobs,” Scarf said at the groundbreaking. “We are incredibly excited about this campus we are building here. It allows us to deepen our commitment to the region logistically by bringing people together.”\n\nAbout 3,000 Wells Fargo workers will be housed in the Irving campus, which is designed to eventually double in size with a second phase of construction.\n\nWells Fargo’s two-building high-rise campus is being built at the northeast corner of West Las Colinas Boulevard and Promenade Parkway, a block south of West Northwest Highway. It’s across the street from the Irving Convention Center and the Toyota Music Factory entertainment, restaurant and retail center.\n\nThe office towers will be in heavily landscaped grounds, with walking and bicycle trails along Lake Carolyn. The new campus will include fitness and wellness centers and a cycling studio. Inside the buildings, employees will have use of a library, lounge coffee shop, a food hall and a dining hall overlooking the lake.\n\nDallas architect Corgan designed the buildings. Austin Commercial is the general contractor.\n\nCommercial property firm Jones Lang LaSalle represented Wells Fargo in its search for a location, considering multiple North Texas sites.\n\nThe sprawling office campus is being constructed by Dallas developer KDC, which also did huge North Texas projects for companies including Toyota, JPMorgan Chase, State Farm Insurance and Pioneer Natural Resources.\n\nCEO Steve Van Amburgh said Wells Fargo is one of the most expensive developments taken on by KDC.\n\n“It’s because of the size and with inflation,” Van Amburgh said. “It’s the largest and has more expense associated with it. It’s been three years in the making.”\n\nTo help pay for the massive development, Wells Fargo is receiving a $5 million grant from the Texas Enterprise Fund. The city of Irving has pledged $31 million in financial support.\n\n“The initiatives that are directed to this project are the largest that this city has ever committed,” Irving mayor Rick Stopfer said. “The new Wells Fargo campus will hold thousands of employees and create new jobs and opportunities for our community.”\n\nStopfer said he toured Wells Fargo office centers in Minnesota, Arizona and other locations when Irving was in negotiations with the bank.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott was on hand for Tuesday’s groundbreaking and praised the bank’s decision to make a large commitment.\n\n“This is a huge project and big day for Irving, for Las Colinas, for the entire state of Texas,” Abbott said. “We could not be more happy and more proud. This is a Texas-size investment in the future of Las Colinas and Irving that will improve our communities for a long, long time.\n\n“This is going to leave a massive footprint for what they are going to be able to accomplish here with this almost half a billion dollar capital investment.”\n\nAbbott said Wells Fargo’s project will add to the state’s growing financial services sector. The Texas economic development office estimates the state’s financial services workforce at more than 558,000, with employment increasing by 23% since 2010.\n\n“Texas is home to the largest financial services workforce in the entire United States,” he said. “What this project will do by its expansion is boost that ranking even higher.”\n\nThe Wells Fargo campus is the latest win for Las Colinas, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Chicago-based industrial equipment giant Caterpillar relocated its headquarters to Las Colinas last year. Kelly-Moore Paint, the California-based independent paint company, is currently considering a head office move to Irving.\n\n“Day in and day out we are working to make sure to bring quality right here at home in Irving and Las Colinas,” said Beth Bowman, president of the Irving-Las Colinas Chamber of Commerce."
