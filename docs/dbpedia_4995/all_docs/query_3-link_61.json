Produced by Revue Productions, the series aired in a half-hour format until its final season, when it expanded to a full hour and switched from black-and-white to color.[1][2]\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nSet in the 1870s and 1880s, the series starred Oklahoma native Dale Robertson as Wells Fargo special agent Jim Hardie, noted at the time as \"the left-handed gun\". The character was fictional, but the series' development was influenced by the biography of Wells Fargo detective Fred J. Dodge. Agent Hardie was shown working cases in many areas of the Old West, occasionally interacting with legendary outlaws such as Jesse James and Belle Starr, as well as with other American historical figures. Hardie's own history was rarely discussed, but one episode gave a detailed backstory, portraying him as a Louisiana-born drifter who almost became an outlaw before finding his true mission in life.\n\nIn the final season, when episodes were longer, Hardie was given a base of operations, in a town called Gloribee, and four regular supporting characters were added. Hardie usually rode a chestnut gelding with a white blaze on his face and four white stockings. The horse actually belonged to Dale Robertson, and was named \"Jubilee\".[3][4]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLead\n\n[edit]\n\nDale Robertson as Jim Hardie, Wells Fargo agent\n\nRecurring\n\n[edit]\n\nJack Ging as Beau McCloud\n\nWilliam Demarest as Jeb Gaine (1961–1962)\n\nVirginia Christine as Ovie (1961–1962)\n\nLory Patrick as Tina (1961–1962)\n\nMary Jayne Saunders as Mary Gee Swenson (1961–1962)\n\nNotable guest stars\n\n[edit]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nNat Holt was the producer of Tales of Wells Fargo, and Les Martinson was the director.

Pall Mall and General Foods were the sponsors.[9]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nA review of the series's first episode in the trade publication Variety described the show as \"strictly formula, with none of the characterization or human values that have embellished the better class of TV westerns to date.\"[9] It said that Robertson seemed \"authoritative enough\" in his role but compared the overall product to the lesser of two films in a double feature.[9] In summary the review said that the show was better suited for syndication because \"network exposure implies the willingness to depart from the routine.\"[9]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nBroadcast\n\n[edit]\n\nThe pilot for Tales of Wells Fargo originally premiered as an episode of the anthology series Schlitz Playhouse of Stars.\n\nIn the 1960–61 season, Wells Fargo was scheduled opposite ABC's detective series Surfside 6 and CBS's new sitcom Bringing Up Buddy, starring Frank Aletter.\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nTimeless Media Group released the first two seasons on DVD in Region 1.[10]\n\nDVD name Ep # Release date The Complete First and Second Seasons 52 October 25, 2011\n\nRatings\n\n[edit]\n\nFor its first two years, the series was in the top 10 of the Nielsen Ratings. During the 1957–58 season, it was ranked number three,[11] and during the 1958–59 season, it was ranked number seven.[12]\n\nMerchandise\n\n[edit]\n\nThe television series also spawned a number of publications for young readers, including the hardcover book Danger at Dry Creek (Golden Press, 1959), and a series of Dell Comics and Little Golden Books.
