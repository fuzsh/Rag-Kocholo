        "text": "When you borrow from the bank for your home mortgage loan, you have to pay it back over time in regular monthly payments. But in a way, making your mortgage payment is like paying yourself because over time you are building equity and ultimately total ownership.\n\nLet's look at how this works. There are four components to a mortgage payment. Principal, interest, taxes and insurance. Principal is the amount of the loan. You pay down principal over the term of your loan. Interest is the cost of borrowing money.\n\nThe amount of interest you pay is determined by your interest rate and your loan balance, and the term of the loan. Taxes are the property assessments collected by your local government. Homeowners insurance is required financial protection you must maintain in case your property is damaged by fire, wind, theft or other hazards.\n\nMortgage insurance could be required if you need to make a smaller down payment. This means you can borrow a larger percentage of your home's value and the insurance protects the lender if you're unable to make your mortgage payment.\n\nIt's always best to speak to your home mortgage consultant to know exactly what you need. In the early stages of your mortgage term, only a small portion of your monthly payment will go toward repaying your original principal. As you continue to make payments through the years, a greater portion will go to reducing the principal that you owe and reducing the interest, while taxes and insurance will still be required.\n\nUnderstanding the components of your mortgage and how they change over time puts you in a better position to manage it throughout your loan. Your Wells Fargo Home Mortgage consultant can talk with you about how to understand your bill, how to pay your loan down faster, and how building equity can help you in the future. They are here for you no matter what your needs or questions. So enjoy home ownership as you pay your mortgage and yourself every month.\n\nWells Fargo Home Mortgage is a division of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n\nÂ© 2014-2022 Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
