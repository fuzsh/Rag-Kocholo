It includes game insights, training routines, and behind-the-scenes looks at the team’s activities and tournaments.\n\nThe Data Behind the Impact\n\nThe impact of YouTube golf content creators is not just anecdotal; several recent statistics underscore their influence:\n\nContinuous Rise in Golf Participation: The National Golf Foundation, keepers of industry statistical data, has shown a continuous rise in both on and off-course participation for the last several years. Surprisingly to some, the COVID-19 pandemic was actually a good thing for golf. The numbers for on course, off course, and those who enjoyed a mix of both shook out like this the past three years:\n\nOn Course Only Off Course Only Both On & Off Total 2021 12.6 Million 12.4 Million 12.5 Million 37.6 Million 2022 13.2 Million 15.5 Million 12.4 Million 41.1 Million 2023 12.1 Million 18.5 Million 14.4 Million 45.0 Million\n\nThis growth is partly attributed to the visibility and appeal generated by golf content on YouTube, especially for those in the off-course and mixed segments.\n\nEngagement Metrics: Channels like Rick Shiels have videos that consistently receive hundreds of thousands of views, indicating a strong and engaged audience. A significant proportion of these views come from instructional content, suggesting that many golfers are turning to YouTube for learning and improvement.\n\nEquipment Sales Impact: YouTube content has a remarkable influence on equipment sales. According to a 2023 report by Golf Datatech, golf equipment sales surged by 10% in 2022, with many attributing this growth to the influence of online reviews and tutorials by trusted YouTubers.\n\nDiversifying Content\n\nGolf YouTubers now produce a diverse array of content, from tutorials and club reviews to global collaborations and unique challenges. This variety caters to different interests and skill levels, making the sport more appealing to a broader range of people. The increased focus on data-driven content has also seen creators incorporating statistical analysis and expert insights into their videos, enhancing their educational value.\n\nProfessional Golf Finally Taking Notice\n\nAs I reported recently on RG.org in my article, “YouTube Golf: Transforming the Game, One Click and View at a Time, And Mainstream Golf Has Now Officially Taken Notice,” the powers that be in mainstream professional golf are starting to take notice of the influence that golf content creation is having on the game. The PGA TOUR’s recent announcement of its inaugural “Creator Classic”, an event scheduled to run the Wednesday before the 2024 TOUR Championship, will bring together some of the best golf digital creators to compete on the East Lake layout.\n\nYou have to think that this year’s U.S. Open Champion, Bryson DeChambeau, who recently surpassed the 1 Million subscriber mark on YouTube, may have been a factor in tipping the scales of YouTube Golf being more widely recognized.\n\nImpacts and Future\n\nYouTube has undeniably revolutionized the way golf is perceived, learned, and enjoyed. The platform has empowered creators to share their love for the game, break down traditional barriers, and inspire a new generation of golfers. With influential figures like Rick Shiels, Grant Horvat, Bryson DeChambeau, the Bob Does Sports crew, and the team at Good Good leading the charge, the future of golf looks brighter, more inclusive, and more engaging than ever before. As content consumption continues to evolve, the role of YouTube in shaping the world of golf is set to grow even further, driving the sport toward new heights.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE1\n\nLEGIT0\n\nWOW0\n\nLOL1\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP1\n\nOB1\n\nSHANK2\n\nWe’re proud to once again partner with 2nd Swing Golf to bring you GolfWRX Members Choice 2024! 2nd Swing has more than 100,000 new and pre-swung golf clubs available in six store locations and online.

That’s the wealth of story lines that Lydia Ko provided the legion of golf journalists today. It’s easy to get elated by these opportunities, but elation leads to distraction, and then, who knows where the story goes?\n\nIt’s best to begin with the facts. Lydia Ko began the final day of play at the 2024 Olympic Games, in a tie with Switzerland’s Morgane Metraux. As Metraux faded from medal contention, perhaps due to unfamiliarity with the situation, Ko shined. She posted a one-under 71 and reached 10-under par. A spirited, final-day rush from unheralded Esther Henseleit of Germany was not enough to catch Ko, and the wunderkind from New Zealand captured the gold medal by two shots. China’s Xiyu Lin reached seven-under par and held off a quartet of golfers at minus-six, for the bronze medal.\n\nThese facts would be a spectacular story on their own, but there is much more to the story. Ko collected her 20th LPGA tour victory in January of this year, and moved within one point of earned entry into the LPGA Hall of Fame. This particular HOF is the hardest to reach of all in sport. There is no voting, no lobbying the electors, just performance. On more than one occasion from January to July, Ko entered the final round in contention for victory, but could not complete the puzzle. With her victory at the Paris Olympics, Ko became the 34th member of the LPGA hall of fame.\n\nNot enough? Jump in a time machine with me, and travel to Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, for the 2016 Olympic golf tournament. The first of its kind in over a century, and Lydia Ko earned herself a silver medal. Inbee Park, the queen bee of LPGA at the time, ran away with the gold by five shots. Forward we go, to Tokyo in 2021, when the 2020 Olympic games were finally celebrated. There, Ko lost a playoff for a second-consecutive silver medal, to home-country Mone Inami. The lost playoff may have been the best thing to happen to Ko, as it set her up for the KoFecta, the collection of all three Olympic medals.\n\nConsider the weight of this achievement. Lydia Ko batted flawlessly, for the cycle, in three Olympic attempts. The medals at Rio fit within a six-shot margin, from 268 to 274. In Tokyo, it was even tighter. All three medalists posted 267 or 268. In Paris, three shots. from 278 to 281. Lydia Ko was able to reserve a space at the table for all three dinners. It makes you wonder if she even should bother with the 2032 games in Brisbane, Australia. What’s left to achieve?\n\nDay four at Paris envisioned a series of potential resolutions. Morgane Metraux of Switzerland potentially could secure a podium spot from nowhere, and collect a medal for the Swiss Guard. Nelly Korda might finally find her game, and surge a la Scottie Scheffler last week, on day four. Rose Zhang could continue her trend toward the top, and collect one of the coveted discs. Sadly, none of the three was able to match par, much less break it. Metraux ballooned to 79, and fell out of the top 15. Korda signed for 75, and slipped to a tie for 22nd. Zhang smacked the golf ball 74 times on Saturday, and tied for eighth.\n\nSo what happened? Well, let’s keep it to the medalists. Xiyu “Janet” Lin finished birdie-birdie-bogey-birdie, to move one shot past Bianca Pagdanganan, Hannah Green, Amy Yang, and Miyu Yamashita. Germany’s Esther Henseleit, a two-time winner of the Magical Kenya Open on the Ladies European Tour, dropped the day’s top round (66) and surged past all but Lydia Ko. She notched birdie on her final two holes, moving to -8, a shot past Lin.\n\nIt was left to Kween Ko to polish the final medal in the collection. She turned in 34 shots, survived a chunked approach to the water, at the 13th hole, and made an elegant birdie at the last, to win by two. Let’s recall that the 18th hole has been the waterloo of many a golfer over the past two weeks. Ko’s drive found the fairway, 209 yards from glory. She eschewed a heroic hybrid over the H2O. Instead, she laid up, fairway right, and pitched to just under eight feet. With the flair of a three-time medalist, a hall of famer, and one of the greats of her generation, Ko stroked the putt home, waved, and smiled the greatest of smiles.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE4\n\nLEGIT0\n\nWOW1\n\nLOL0\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP0\n\nOB0\n\nSHANK0"
