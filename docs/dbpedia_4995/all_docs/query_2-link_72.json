        "text": "Missy Elliott is easily the best Melissa to ever do it, and that’s saying something. But all jokes aside, Missy has been a fixture in my musical universe since I was a jit. Her experimental music and unsettling iconography sometimes frightened me, but left me incapable of looking away. At the time, no one else sounded like Missy with her flawless blend of rapping and singing. No other female MC looked like her either: a plus-sized jawn in bright baggy clothing with a compelling visual shot through a fisheye lens. The experimental essence of Missy is forever seared on the brains of 80s and 90s babies.\n\nWhen the futurist visuals dropped for “Out Of This World,” Missy’s first headlining tour, I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the same time-hopping, jaw-dropping energy would be palpable.\n\nThe night kicked off at Wells Fargo Center with Missy’s right-hand man Timbaland, who bopped around the stage to numerous tracks spanning his more than 30-year career. Songs included “Promiscuous Girl,” “Ayo Technology,” and “Pony.” Unfortunately, Timbaland’s performance left much to be desired as he was alone on stage rapping along to only parts of the songs that played. Either way, his presence was a solid palate-warmer for what was to come.\n\nThe Princess of Atlanta, Ciara, was the next person to grace the Wells Fargo Center stage. She kicked off her set with her 2024 debut single “Goodies” which was followed by “Oh” and “Ride.” As a tween who was listening to Ciara at the onset of her career (like many of the other people in attendance), it was nice to see that she was still able to expertly execute all of the iconic dance moves that so many of us mimicked in our bedroom mirrors. Ciara and her dancers gave us everything we needed and more.\n\nSince dancing is a major component of Ciara’s artistry, it made sense for her to have a bevy of dancers backing her up. For Busta Rhymes, all he needed was his omnipresent hypeman and co-conspirator Spliff Star. The pair pit verses from songs like “Hands Where My Eyes Can See,” “Make It Clap,” and the “Never Leave” remix as they played around with volume and speed. Busta and Spliff have been doing this for so long that their playful rap game of cat and mouse left audiences captivated without all the other pomp and circumstance like backup dancers and pyrotechnics."
