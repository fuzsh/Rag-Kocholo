        "text": "“TALES OF WELLS FARGO”\n\nDale Robertson has always believed the key to the success of his “Tales of Wells Fargo” lay in the fact it was not an adult western—or a kid’s western either. He promoted the series as a family show, often criticizing the so-called adult westerns on the air. “If there’s anything that annoys me, it’s the gimmicks. They’ve lost sight of some of the basic values. Give me a Gary Cooper or Joel McCrea every time. You invest in them and it’s like putting money in the bank. And for good reason, they’re also nice people.”\n\nThe same can be said of the ruggedly handsome, southpaw gunhand Dale Robertson who debuted NBC’s “Tales of Wells Fargo” on Monday nights from 8:30-9 (ET) on March 18, 1957, and ramrodded the series to the #3 position in the Nielsen ratings during the ‘57-‘58 season. As Wells Fargo agent Jim Hardie, Robertson was a private-eye on horseback sent each week to investigate trouble along the stage route. Many of the episodes were in the capable directorial reins of Earl Bellamy with director of photography being Republic alumni Bud Thackery.\n\nDayle LeMoine Robertson, born in Harrah, OK, in 1923, grew up around horses. Determined to be an actor, he eventually landed a small role as Jesse James in Randolph Scott’s “Fighting Man of the Plains” (‘49), produced by Nat Holt, and signed a seven year contract with 20th Century Fox during which time he starred in “Return of the Texan”, “Outcasts of Poker Flats”, “O’Henry’s Full House”, “Silver Whip”, “City of Bad Men”, “Gambler From Natchez” and others.\n\nProducer Nat Holt (1893-1971) had proposed “Tales of Wells Fargo” a couple of times to Robertson and he turned it down. As Dale explained, “Nat Holt called me about 4-5 times and wanted me to do the pilot for this television show, ‘Wells Fargo,’ but I kept saying no because I had about three pictures I was supposed to do down in Mexico. He finally called so many times I said, ‘Lemme\n\nsee the script.’ It was so bad I never had to worry about going into television. But by doing it I could pay Nat back, ‘cause he was the producer of my first film, ‘Fighting Man of the Plains’. I felt like I owed somebody somethin’. So I said I’d do it. I never figured in a million years that thing would ever sell. By this time they’d promised me 50% ownership of it. Now, no one goes out and doesn’t try to make the best picture you can. You change the script, dialogue, whatever you have to change to make it better. That’s what we did, changed it all around. Very little of the original… Anyway, when we got through with it, the first people that looked at it was the American Tobacco company and they bought it. I must say, after we got into it, I’m glad I did it because I enjoyed ‘Wells Fargo’. We has 63 people in the crew, we never went over schedule or over budget one time. We never had one harsh word in all those years; and we used lots and lots of new faces that had never been on the screen before.”\n\nThe pilot aired as “A Tale of Wells Fargo”, an episode of “Schlitz Playhouse of Stars” on Dec. 14, 1956. The series made its debut the following March without fanfare and quickly overtook CBS’ “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts” in the ratings.\n\nRobertson rode his own horse, Jubilee, throughout the run of the series in which he owned half interest. Usual sponsor was Pall Mall cigarettes. Besides Godfrey, for five seasons “Tales of Wells Fargo” out-gunned a lot of competition from ABC and CBS—“Bold Journey”, “Father Knows Best”, “Bringing Up Buddy” and “Bourbon Street Beat”.\n\nProducer Nat Holt was replaced in the 5th season by Earle Lyon (see his comments). With the 6th season (‘61-‘62) NBC expanded the series to an hour, changed the theme music, made it in color, added a whole “family” of secondary characters and moved “Wells Fargo” to Saturday night (7:30-8:30ET) where it was opposite the powerful “Perry Mason” on CBS. Cost, ratings and a new format were too much for the series and “Wells Fargo” was canceled after the June 2, 1962, episode.\n\nFor the record, in the 6th season, Jim Hardie acquired a horse ranch near San Francisco and five new regulars: Jack Ging as his assistant Beau McCloud, William Demarest as ranch foreman Jeb Gaine, Virginia Christine as their neighbor, the widow Ovie, with Mary Jane Saunders and Lory Patrick as Ovie’s daughters Mary Gee and Tina.\n\nJack Ging (born 1931 in Alva, Oklahoma) worked into the ‘90s and is now semi-retired. William Demarest (born 1892) entered films in 1926. After “Wells Fargo” he became famous as Uncle Charley on “My Three Sons”. He died in 1983. Mary Jane Saunders (born 1943) left show business in the mid ‘60s. Lory Patrick (born 1933 in W. Virginia) left the business in ‘67 and married actor Dean Jones in ‘73. She wrote the best selling book HEARING GOD. Virginia Christine (born 1920) started in films in ‘43 but is best remembered as Mrs. Olsen, TV spokeswoman for Folger’s Coffee. Dale Robertson lived for years with his wife Susan on their ranch in Yukon, OK, and only recently relocated to San Diego to be near relatives.\n\nJack Ging Recalls\n\n“Tales of Wells Fargo”\n\nLory Patrick Recalls\n\n“Tales of Wells Fargo”\n\nProducer Earle Lyon Recalls\n\n“Tales of Wells Fargo”"
