        "text": "The PGA Tour’s Signature Event in Charlotte has a new sponsor and, just for next season, a new venue.\n\nThe Tour announced Tuesday that Truist Financial Corporation will take over the sponsorship of the former Wells Fargo Championship in a seven-year agreement with the PGA Tour and regular host venue Quail Hollow Club.\n\n“We are honored to be the title sponsor of the PGA Tour’s Charlotte-based Signature Event and thrilled that Philadelphia and Charlotte, two vibrant growth markets for Truist, will be featured on the PGA Tour,” said Truist Chairman and CEO Bill Rogers in a press release. “We look forward to partnering with the PGA Tour to elevate this wonderful championship event and Truist’s deep community impact, and to further fulfill our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities.”\n\nBut, with Quail Hollow set to host the PGA Championship for the second time in 2025, the Tour also announced the inaugural Truist Championship would be staged at the Philadelphia Cricket Club’s Wissahickon Course in its typical slot, May 5-11, the week before the PGA Championship.\n\nThe event has been a mainstay on the PGA Tour’s calendar since its introduction as the Wachovia Championship in 2003 and counts previous winners like Tiger Woods, Jim Furyk, Vijay Singh, Rickie Fowler, Max Homa and Rory McIlroy, who exploded past Xander Schuauffele in the final round to win this year’s event.\n\nWells Fargo had been the title sponsor since 2011 but announced last December it would not be renewing its sponsorship after the 2024 event, its second as a $20 million Signature Event.\n\nAll but two editions of the tournament have been played at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte. The 2017 tournament was held at Eagle Point Golf Club in Wilmington, N.C., ahead of Quail Hollow hosting its first PGA Championship. The 2022 edition was held at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm, outside Washington, D.C.\n\nThe 2025 Truist Championship will mark the debut of the Philadelphia Cricket Club’s Wissahickon Course on the PGA Tour, but the club has no lack of championship pedigree. The 1922 A.W. Tillinghast design underwent a restoration in 2014 by Keith Foster and has since hosted the 2015 PGA Professional National Championship, the 2016 Senior Players Championship and the U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship this past May.\n\nAt the 2016 Senior Players, strong winds and firm conditions saw no player break par for 72 holes as Bernhard Langer made a dramatic par save to win by one over Miguel Angel Jimenez and Joe Durant at one over.\n\nThe club has indicated no changes are expected to be made to the 7,119-yard, par-70 course save for rerouting it. During the Senior Players, the 517-yard par-4 4th hole played as the 18th hole as grandstands were not able to be constructed around the traditional 18th hole.\n\nThe club features a total of 45 holes, including the 9-hole St. Martins Course, located within the city of Philadelphia, which previously hosted the 1907 and 1910 U.S. Opens when it was an 18-hole layout. The Militia Hill course, located at the same Flourtown location as Wissahickon, is a 2002 Hurdzan/Fry design."
