        "text": "Pros Explained\n\nHighly accessible—numerous locations: With approximately 4,900 branches and over 12,000 ATMs across 37 states and the District of Columbia, Wells Fargo is one of the more easily accessible large banks in the United States.\n\nFrequently waived monthly fees: While Wells Fargo does levy maintenance fees on many of its deposit accounts, the bank does provide a number of methods for avoiding them. Most clients can easily qualify for one of the many waivers.\n\nInnovative, secure data-sharing, and money management apps: In 2017, Wells Fargo partnered with Intuit to provide a seamless and completely secure connection for customers who use Mint, QuickBooks online, and TurboTax online. This pioneering move allows Wells Fargo customers to easily share data with these Intuit products so they can handle their financial chores without risking their accounts' security.\n\nCons Explained\n\nLow interest rates: Account APYs tend to skew lower at traditional brick-and-mortar banks than at their online counterparts. Still, Wells Fargo offers very lackluster rates (currently 0.01%-0.02%) on all of its savings options. In addition, every savings account also carries a monthly fee, meaning your account may essentially earn a negative amount if you are unable to avoid the charge—if your account dips below the minimum daily balance, for example.\n\nOverdraft fees levied up to three times daily: Wells Fargo charges a $35 overdraft fee for its Debit Card Overdraft Service every time you overdraw your account. Unfortunately, the bank's policies allow up to three overdrafts per day, meaning you could be staring down $105 in overdraft fees from a single day's mistakes. On the other hand, if you've signed up for Overdraft Protection, you will be charged one fee per business day, but the fee amount will depend on the type of account from which the funds are withdrawn to cover the overdraft.\n\nHistory of costly scandals: In 2016, news began to emerge that for years, Wells Fargo employees had engaged in illegal practices—behavior that resulted in extra charges for customers and opening fake accounts, along with improperly repossessed homes and autos—and has been forced to pay billions in fines imposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWho Is Wells Fargo Best for?\n\nWells Fargo will appeal to customers who want a well-established traditional bank with a large geographic footprint. It will be a great fit for those who:\n\nNeed a bank that is present in the majority of the United States, including the District of Columbia\n\nCan easily keep a minimum balance in their checking and savings account to avoid fees\n\nWant to use Mint, QuickBooks online, or TurboTax online to handle their accounting and financial affairs\n\nWhat Does Wells Fargo Offer?\n\nWells Fargo has a full array of the usual financial products and services for their customers. These include:\n\nSavings accounts\n\nChecking accounts\n\nCertificates of deposit\n\nCredit cards\n\nSavings Accounts\n\nCreated specifically to encourage savings, the Wells Fargo Way2Save Savings Account has a low minimum deposit of $25 and a monthly service fee of $5, which can be waived with either a $300 minimum daily balance or by setting up automatic transfers from linked Wells Fargo checking accounts. In addition, Wells Fargo automatically waives the monthly fee for account holders under the age of 24.\n\nAnother savings encouragement is the Save As You Go® transfer, which moves $1 from your Wells Fargo checking account to your Way2Save account with each qualifying transaction. These transactions include any non-recurring debit card purchases and any time you pay a bill using the Wells Fargo online bill pay option.\n\nWells Fargo also touts the use of your Way2Save account as a method of overdraft protection for customers who also have checking accounts. If you sign up for this optional service, Wells Fargo will transfer money from your Way2Save account into your checking account to cover an overdraft. However, this service doesn't prevent you from being charged a $35 overdraft fee once per business day. The fee can be avoided if a covering transfer or deposit is made on the same business day.\n\nThe APY on Way2Save accounts is currently set at 0.15% and there is no minimum balance required to earn it.\n\nWells Fargo's Platinum Savings account comes with the option to write checks. They also don't have any restrictions on the number of monthly withdrawals you can make from the account.\n\nSavers can expect an APY of 0.25% with Platinum Savings, but there is a relationship bonus APY of 0.26% if you also link a Portfolio Relationship by Wells Fargo account (see below). Close the qualifying checking account and you lose the bonus rate.\n\nCustomers can open a Platinum Savings account with only $25 and there is no minimum balance requirement to earn interest. However, there is a $12 monthly fee that can only be waived by maintaining a $3,500 minimum daily balance.\n\nArticle Sources\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.
