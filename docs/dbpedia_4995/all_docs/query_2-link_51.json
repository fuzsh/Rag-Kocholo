        "text": "If you make your deposit on a business day before the cutoff time displayed at the banking location, ATM, or on the Wells Fargo Mobile® app, we will generally credit the deposit to your account the same business day. If you make your deposit after the cutoff time or on a non-business day, we will credit it to your account on the next business day.\n\nBusiness days are Monday through Friday, except for federal holidays.\n\nCutoff times are displayed in all locations. The cutoff time for most Wells Fargo ATM locations is 9 p.m. local time.
