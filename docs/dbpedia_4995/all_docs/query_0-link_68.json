        "text": "I’m fairly certain that it isn’t often one gets the chance to photograph a band as legendary as the Red Hot Chili Peppers. At least it isn’t often that I do!\n\nAs I was in the pit setting up to photograph I couldn’t help but be reflective. My first thought was, how can I get the shots I want in just a short three songs (the amount many bands allow photographers to shoot). And then, I wondered what songs I would get.\n\nThe band opened with Monarchy of Roses, and my photographing concluded with Scar Tissue. I mentioned to a friend of mine that at one point I was taken from my lens and almost forgot what I was there to do. I was so absorbed into the stage performance that I had put my camera down and stood in awe, just watching. This was the first time I had seen Josh Klinghoffer play as a Chili Pepper and I was impressed—his energy just as frenetic as the next one which I believe is the hallmark of a live Chili Pepper show. I can only imagine you can’t be taught this, and it must be an inherent trait that one possesses in order to sustain a show just like the one I was fortunate enough to see.\n\nSo, I was standing there and just watching while they played through Can’t Stop and didn’t realize I wasn’t taking pictures until the photographers were walking on each side of me! OH NO! I need to get back to it; and so I did. It was one of the most fun, and colorful stages I’ve photographed yet. I can only imagine the hard work, effort and planning a show like this requires to put on.\n\nAnd did I mention the overall vibe of the venue? Everyone was beyond happy? How often do you go to a show where people move out of the way for each other, smile, talk, and share stories about how long they have liked the band, or how they are FAN-atics? It was a great night, and I only wish I could say more, but I will leave it to this photo set to say the rest."
