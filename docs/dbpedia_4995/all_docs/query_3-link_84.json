        "text": "I opened this credit card because it was highly regarded on NerdWallet. Although they claim to reward you for spending more within the first few weeks, they have placed a hold on my paid-off account to prevent my ability to gain more rewards. Within 1.5 weeks, I have called customer service four times and escalations twice to follow up, but each time they claim the issue would be resolved shortly, except it lingers. Since I had planned to use my card, I have even filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau in hopes it would expedite the release of the unexplained hold, yet I've had no luck. Terrible. I wish I would have known about their credibility.\n\nI keep getting transfer fees on my account of $40, $50, when I haven’t transferred in a couple months. Last time I called and she said it was due to a transfer I had made where I was called the transfer fee plus another $200 fee that seemed the same thing but she said it was different. I am not going to use the card anymore and cancel it when it is paid off.\n\nI wish I had read these reviews before I signed up for a Wells Fargo credit card. Live and learn, They are the worst card company I have ever encountered. I received the card, and activated it online, then tried to enroll in online banking so I could use the phone app. Every attempt failed. Each time they told me to call a number, where there were long delays and people who did not understand or solve the problem.\n\nOn the fourth phone call, I was told that they had my cell phone number recorded as a land line and therefore everything was impossible. The only solution was to visit the local WF ATM and go through some elaborate and ill-defined procedure that would magically solve all problems. This has to be one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard. Rather than endure another minute of this nonsense, I asked them to close the account. This seems to be the only thing they were capable of doing, although it took an inordinately long period of time to accomplish, and I had to repeat information I had already given them at least three times. Now I get to see whether they actually close it or not. I will never again deal with WF for any reason.\n\nI would rate the Wells Fargo Active credit card with less than 1 star if I could. Wells Fargo is a scam. Their customer service SUCKS and online banking is horrible. I paid off my entire balance yesterday and magically another balance appeared today. Whipped out my calculator to figure out exactly what it was from since I hadn’t used card. Couldn’t. So I called WF customer service. Was placed on hold for a while and when the guy came back on he said that the reason there was more to pay is because it was an amount that was unpaid. I told him that that was common sense and completely unhelpful to the very specific question I asked when he got on the line. What were the charges for and why wasn’t it there when I paid what showed as the full balance when I hadn’t used the card.\n\nHe said for me to calculate it myself and that he couldn’t and no one else could walk me through that either (A COMPLETE LIE). He then said he would transfer me but that no one would be able to help me. He placed me on hold and I have been on hold ever since. Don’t care how long, I’m not hanging up the phone. They suck. Please don’t get this card. Trying to get out of it with all my might and switch to only using my trustworthy credit union.\n\nI closed my account due to very poor service, long wait times on the phone, unresponded emails. When I tried to cut the card, I could not, as there is a metal plate inside the card. I took the card to a local branch office, and they refused to help... they would not take the card back and could not destroy it either.\n\nAbsolutely horrible customer service and stolen $2200.00 from me! I have been trying to get someone from this company to help me since 5/15/24 track down a balance transfer done to Wells Fargo from Elan Financial and still not resolved or applied to my account as of 6/26/24, even after putting in a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is still awaiting resolution.\n\nI wish I could give them a rating of less than 1 star. I was told three times on a recorded line that there would no transfer fee for my transaction. I was charged 5% ($475). I did file an inquiry but as expected no help. Please look elsewhere. They are horrible.\n\nI wish I read these reviews before signing up for the Wells Fargo credit card active cash. I’ve only had it for 2 months and I can’t log in to the website. Their app doesn’t work and I can’t even make a payment through automated phone. It shows that I don’t even have an account although I get a bill in the mail from the charges I did. When I call them they say everything looks good on their end so I shouldn’t have a problem logging onto any of these services yet their IT department couldn’t even help. The only way I can make a payment is my customer service and talking to someone. To top it off I had fraudulent charges on my account and my bill is due soon so they ordered me a new card but I can’t make a payment till that goes through! Don’t bother with this company!!! I’m gonna do a balance transfer to another trusted credit card and close this damn card!!!\n\nThis is the worst bank/credit card company I’ve ever dealt with. If you call for help no doubt you will be transferred to 5 different people who can’t help answer any questions. Also do not rely on the banking app because it will do you no good. I will never do anything through Wells Fargo again in my life. Horrible experience."
