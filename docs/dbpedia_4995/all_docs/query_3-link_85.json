The Wells Fargo Platinum card is no longer available.\n\nComparing the best Wells Fargo credit cards\n\nCredit cardBest forCreditCards.com ratingAnnual feeWells Fargo Reflect® Card Long intro APR4.2 / 5$0Wells Fargo Active Cash® CardEveryday cash rewards4.1 / 5$0Wells Fargo Autograph℠ CardVarious reward categories4.2 / 5$0Wells Fargo Autograph Journey℠ CardBest for travel3.9 / 5$95Hotels.com® Rewards Visa® Credit CardOccasional hotel guests3.6 / 5$0\n\nEditor’s picks: Wells Fargo credit card details\n\nWells Fargo Reflect® Card: Best for long intro APR\n\nWhy we picked it: It touts one of the longest introductory APR offers on the market, which can give cardholders some breathing room to pay down credit card debt.\n\nBiggest drawbacks: It has no rewards program whatsoever, which may lead some cardholders to a different card with significant long-term value. However, the real drawback here is the balance transfer fee, which is 5% ($5 minimum) and you must transfer your qualifying balance within 120 days of account opening to qualify for the introductory APR.\n\nAlternatives: Since this card doesn’t feature a rewards program, anyone who wants to earn cash back, points or miles should look elsewhere – but if you prefer the same issuer, the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card or Wells Fargo Autograph Card could be a better fit.\n\nBottom line: If you’re looking for a long window to pay back high-interest credit card debt or a large purchase, look no further.\n\nRead our Wells Fargo Reflect® Card review.\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash® Card: Best for flat-rate rewards\n\nWhy we picked it: For a card with no annual fee, the Wells Fargo Active Cash card offers a competitive welcome bonus and generous unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases; earnings never expire so long as your account remains in good standing, making it simple to maximize earnings on daily purchases. Plus, with its simple rewards structure, there are no rotating categories to keep track of and no enrollments required.\n\nBiggest drawbacks: No bonus categories to speak of means people who want to maximize earnings should pair this with a higher-earning card. Ancillary benefits and card perks are also very limited compared to other cards.\n\nAlternatives: A rewards-seeker who wants to capitalize on special offers and bonus rates should look to other rewards cards, specifically ones with rotating cash back categories such as the Discover it® Cash Back.\n\nBottom line: Anyone looking for a simple and flexible way to earn rewards on daily spending will see a lot of value from this well-rounded, multi-faceted Wells Fargo card. Pairing 2% cash rewards with a welcome bonus and introductory APR offers makes for a worthwhile card.\n\nRead our Wells Fargo Active Cash Card review.\n\nWells Fargo Autograph Card: Best for everyday spending\n\nWhy we picked it: You can earn 3X points in several categories such as restaurants, travel, gas stations, transit, popular streaming services, and phone plans, plus 1X points on other purchases – which is unlike any other Wells Fargo credit card and is a great card to use toward rewards on everyday purchases.\n\nBiggest Drawbacks: It doesn’t reward grocery store purchases, has a short intro APR period and high APR range and doesn’t have many redemption options, especially for travel.\n\nAlternatives: If you want to earn maximum rewards on grocery stores or travel, or if you want more flexible redemption options, the Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card or the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express are ideal picks.\n\nBottom line: If you want a simple rewards system that earns points on a variety of categories, then this card could be a great choice for you.\n\nHotels.com® Rewards Visa® Credit Card: Best for occasional hotel guests\n\nWhy we picked it: You’ll enjoy a number of ancillary travel perks, including no foreign currency conversion fees, certain travel protections, and automatic Hotels.com® Rewards Silver status, which entitles you to extras, like free Wi-Fi or complimentary breakfast, at select properties.\n\nBiggest drawbacks: The rewards program is complex. It functions more like a small business loyalty program where you earn “stamps” to put toward nights on future Hotels.com bookings, and it can take some time to master.\n\nAlternatives: If you travel frequently or are looking for luxury perks, you’ll be better served by a premium rewards-filled travel card such as the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card or Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card.\n\nBottom line: If you book trips through Hotels.com (even occasionally), you can leverage the card to earn stays without an annual fee.\n\nRead our Hotels.com® Rewards Visa® Credit Card review.\n\nWhat is Wells Fargo?\n\nWells Fargo & Company is one of the “Big Four” banks of the U.S., alongside JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup.

Want to build or improve your credit? Earn the highest cash back rewards for the things you spend the most on? Or do you want to make interest-free payments on purchases or past debt for a set period of time? Whatever your goal, chances are there’s a credit card for you, but to determine which one would be the best fit when choosing, you should ask these three questions:\n\nHow will my credit score impact my application?\n\nWhen you know what features you’re looking for, you’ll need to know your credit score and compare the cards that best fit you and your creditworthiness. With Wells Fargo, most of its credit cards require a good to excellent credit score to qualify, so if you have a bad to fair credit score or limited credit history, you have much lower chances for approval.\n\nHowever, a tool like CardMatch can do a lot of the work for you. By answering a few questions, you’ll quickly get credit card options tailored to your needs and credit profile, and one of your options might even be a Wells Fargo card. But before you apply, see if you can get preapproved with Wells Fargo.\n\nAre there any fees associated with the card?\n\nIt’s important to ask yourself whether the fee structure of a Wells Fargo card will fit your lifestyle. For example, if you want to do a balance transfer, you should be aware that Wells Fargo’s balance transfers typically come with a balance transfer fee.\n\nAlso, if you ever plan to travel, look for a card with no foreign currency conversion fees, such as the Wells Fargo Autograph Card or the Hotels.com Rewards Visa Card. If you only plan on using your card occasionally, then you can probably do without annual fees altogether — which you can luckily avoid with most Wells Fargo credit cards. But keep in mind that you should also be aware of any potential late fees, penalty APRs or cash advance fees as well.\n\nDo I want to earn rewards?\n\nOf course, rewards programs are a fantastic benefit since they allow you to earn money back on your purchases. Some Wells Fargo cards, such as the Wells Fargo Autograph Card, reward specific categories such as gas stations or restaurants, while others offer flat-rate rewards on purchases such as the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card. Earning rewards, on the other hand, may be on the back burner for you if you prefer to focus on improving credit or paying off existing debt, so the Wells Fargo Reflect Card would be a good fit for this goal. But if you determine that rewards are important to you, you should first figure out which type of rewards program works best for you before applying for any Wells Fargo credit cards.\n\nShould you get a Wells Fargo card?\n\nWhat credit score is needed for a Wells Fargo credit card?\n\nFeaturing options with strong rewards and extended intro APR windows, many Wells Fargo’s credit cards require at least a good credit score (in the 670 – 739 range on the FICO scale) for approval. It’s best practice to see if you prequalify with Wells Fargo to avoid a hard inquiry on your credit report and to get a good idea of whether you’d be approved or not. If you aren’t yet in the credit range to obtain a Wells Fargo card, you can use other credit cards to build your credit score for more possibilities. Secured cards, student cards and cards for bad credit can be essentials on the journey to carrying high-end cards.\n\nWells Fargo’s rewards program\n\nYou can redeem rewards through various options, including travel, merchandise, online exclusives and more. Cash back, statement credits and travel perks offer the best value, but taking a glimpse at the options might lead you elsewhere:\n\nCash back. Request through an eligible redemption account via My Wells Fargo Deals, PayPal or a check in the mail ($25 increments) or withdraw earnings from a Wells Fargo ATM ($20 increments).\n\nStatement credit. Redeem your earnings in increments of $25 by applying them directly to your credit card balance.\n\nTravel. Flights, hotels, rental cars and more can be booked through the Wells Fargo Rewards travel portal.\n\nGift cards. Purchase digital or physical gift cards by redeeming points for 1 cent each.\n\nMerchandise. Enter the Wells Fargo Rewards merchandise portal’s online auction to bid on merchandise using your points.\n\nDigital downloads. Purchase music, e-books and more using your points. Be aware that prices vary and it’s likely you’ll get less than 1 cent of value per point this way.\n\nSend a gift. You can send anyone with any type of Wells Fargo account a gift of cash using your points. Points can transfer to friends and family if they have access to Wells Fargo Rewards and you even have the option to gift points to charity.\n\nValue of Wells Fargo Rewards\n\nBankrate’s latest points and miles valuations estimates that Wells Fargo Rewards points are usually worth 1 cent per point for most redemptions\n\nWhen compared to other rewards programs, Wells Fargo Rewards are a bit different. Unlike Chase Ultimate Rewards or American Express Membership Rewards, points aren’t transferable to airline loyalty programs. This is often the best way to increase the value of rewards points, putting Wells Fargo Rewards at an immediate disadvantage.\n\nWhen compared to other rewards programs, Wells Fargo Rewards are a bit different. Unlike Chase Ultimate Rewards or American Express Membership Rewards, points aren’t transferable to airline loyalty programs. This is often the best way to increase the value of rewards points, putting Wells Fargo Rewards at an immediate disadvantage.\n\nAll in all, Wells Fargo Rewards points are still competitive from a value standpoint but limited in their flexibility.\n\nOther benefits of having Wells Fargo cards\n\nFrom the famous cellphone protection to auto rental collision damage waivers, the Wells Fargo cards offer respectable benefits. Here’s a list of some of the often-seen perks of Wells Fargo cards:\n\nZero liability protection and 24/7 fraud monitoring to protect against unauthorized transactions\n\nChip technology for added security\n\nRapid Alerts can be used to track purchases and get notified when there’s suspicious activity\n\nCellphone protection will help protect your mobile device from covered damage or theft when you pay your monthly cellphone bill with your eligible Wells Fargo card (a deductible applies)\n\nWith an auto rental collision damage waiver, you’ll get auto coverage for damage due to collision or theft\n\nEmergency card replacement and cash disbursement are available by calling the number on the back of your card when you need an emergency cash advance or a replacement card delivered\n\nOverdraft protection to ensure that you’re not harshly penalized when accidentally charging too much\n\nUse My Money Map to create a budget and manage your spending\n\nFree access to your FICO score to track your progress\n\nRoadside dispatch and travel accident insurance to help whenever you’re in a bind with your vehicle\n\nTravel and emergency assistance services to assist when you may need them the most\n\nHow we picked the best Wells Fargo credit cards\n\nResearch methodology: We analyzed Wells Fargo’s catalog of credit cards to identify their top offers on the market. While a large number of factors contribute to the quality of a credit card, the following were our most important criteria in evaluating and choosing the best here:\n\nTerms of 0% intro APR period: Wells specializes in intro APR offers for both purchases and qualifying balance transfers. We looked for its longest offers on the market (which are some of the best amongst all credit cards) and considered its after-offer APRs when narrowing down cards.\n\nAvailable rewards: With not all of its cards earning rewards, we made sure to include choices that do give cardholders a little incentive for their spending. We found welcome bonuses and solid rewards and included those options here.\n\nRates and fees: We looked for Wells Fargo’s no annual fee options as well as ones that have reasonable ongoing APRs, avoid hidden fees and unnecessary charges, and aren’t overly costly for executing a qualifying balance transfer.\n\nOur full criteria include: Rewards flexibility, welcome incentives, balance transfer fees, regular APR, savings period, credit needed, security, ease of application, rewards potential and miscellaneous benefits.\n\nAdditional information on Wells Fargo credit cards\n\nFor more information on all things Wells Fargo credit cards, continue reading content from our credit card experts:"
