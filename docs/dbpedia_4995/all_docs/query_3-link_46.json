        "text": "Wells Fargo Rewards is a new credit card rewards program offering flexible points when cardholders of select cards make qualifying purchases or other transactions. Depending on the card you have, every purchase may earn points at a flat rate or different types of purchases may earn at varying rates determined by the spending category.\n\nNew members may also earn bonus points when being approved for a new credit card in the program and meeting certain spending criteria.\n\nHow Much Are Wells Fargo Rewards Worth?\n\nWells Fargo keeps things simple by keeping most reward redemptions worth a flat 1 cent each. Here’s a quick look at common redemption options:\n\nRedemption Value Per Point\n\nCash back or statement credits\n\n$0.01\n\nTravel booked through Wells Fargo\n\n$0.01\n\nPay With Rewards at select merchants\n\n$0.01\n\nGift cards\n\n$0.01\n\nIn addition, Wells Fargo now allows members with eligible cards to transfer points to partnering travel loyalty programs. When doing so, the value of your points will be determined based on the airline or hotel program rather than through Wells Fargo Rewards. Redemptions could yield more or less than the 1 cent per point offered through the Wells Fargo travel portal depending on how you use them. Strategic use could make these worth 2 cents per point or more, offering outsized value.\n\nSimilarly, redemption values for points redeemed toward merchandise may vary and often yield less than 1 cent per point when you exchange your Wells Fargo Rewards for purchases like this. You’re likely better off shopping for a deal to purchase the item elsewhere and cashing out your rewards for a statement credit to reimburse yourself afterward.\n\nWells Fargo offers multiple cards that earn Wells Fargo Rewards. Each card offers different benefits and earning rates and you may be able to earn points through opening new credit cards to earn welcome bonuses, daily spending on qualifying charges and shopping through the Wells Fargo Rewards online portal.\n\nPersonal Wells Fargo Credit Cards\n\nCard Annual Fee Welcome Offer Earning Rates Major Benefits\n\n$0\n\nEarn 20,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 in purchases in the first 3 months\n\nEarn 3 points per dollar at restaurants, travel, gas stations, transit, popular streaming services and phone plans, 1 point per dollar on other purchases\n\n0% introductory APR on purchases for 12 months from account opening. A variable APR of 20.24%, 25.24%, or 29.99% applies for purchases after the intro period ends and for balance transfers. The card has a balance transfer fee of up to 5%, minimum $5\n\n$95\n\nEarn 60,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 in the first 3 months of account opening\n\nEarn 5 points per dollar on hotels, 4 points per dollar on airlines, 3 points per dollar on other travel and restaurants and 1 point per dollar on other purchases\n\nReceive a $50 annual statement credit with a $50 minimum airline purchase.\n\n$0\n\nEarn a $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first 3 months\n\nEarn 2% cash rewards on purchases\n\n0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers, then a 20.24%, 25.24%, or 29.99% variable APR applies. Balance transfers made within 120 days qualify for the intro rate and fee of 3% (min. $5) then a fee of up to 5% (min. $5) applies\n\nWells Fargo Business Credit Cards\n\nRight now, there are no business credit cards available to new applicants that earn Wells Fargo Rewards.\n\nCards Not Accepting New Applications\n\nWells Fargo has several discontinued cards that may also earn rewards points if you already hold the card. Be aware that some redemption options may not be available to you; See your cardholder agreement for current rewards eligibility and details.\n\nThis information was collected independently by Forbes Advisor and may no longer be accurate as the product terms change.\n\nWells Fargo Propel World American Express: Earn 3 Wells Fargo Rewards points on dining out and ordering in, popular streaming devices, gas stations, rideshare, transit, travel including flights, hotels, homestays and car rentals. Earn 1 Wells Fargo Rewards on all other purchases.\n\nWells Fargo Visa Signature Credit Card: Earn 5 Wells Fargo Rewards points per dollar spent on up to $12,500 on grocery, gas and drugstore purchases for the first six months and 1 Wells Fargo rewards point per dollar thereafter.\n\nWells Fargo Rewards Card: Earn 5 Wells Fargo Rewards points per dollar spent up to the first $12,500 spent on gas, grocery, and drugstore spending for the first six months. All other purchases earn 1 Wells Fargo rewards point per dollar.\n\nWells Fargo Business Platinum Credit Card*: With this card, you can choose your rewards: Cash Back or Rewards Points. Cash Back option: Earn 1.5% cash back on every $1 spent; Reward Points option: Earn 1 point on every $1 spent and receive 1,000 bonus points when your company spend is $1,000 or more in any monthly billing period.\n\nWells Fargo Business Elite Signature Card*: Earn 1.5% cash back per dollar spent or earn 1 point per dollar spent and receive 5,000 bonus points when the company spend is $10,000 or more in any monthly billing period.\n\nWells Fargo Business Secured Credit Card*: Earn 1.5% cash back per dollar spent on qualifying purchases or earn 1 point per dollar and receive 1,000 bonus points when the company spend is $1,000 or more in any monthly billing period.\n\nWells Fargo Bank Rules\n\nLike most banks, Wells Fargo has its own application restrictions that you may need to consider if you are hoping to open a new card.\n\nWells Fargo may not approve you for a new credit card if you have opened a Wells Fargo card within the last six months. That means Wells Fargo allows you to earn one welcome offer, no matter which card, in a six month period. If you get a card with a 0% intro APR offer, for example, you won’t be eligible to get a card that earns a welcome bonus—even if you close the card—for six months.\n\nPool Points Between Wells Fargo Cards\n\nIf you hold more than one Wells Fargo Rewards card, your points will be combined into a single balance automatically unless you have automatic redemptions turned on. If so, you can still request the accounts be pooled anyway. Cardholders may also optionally combine points with someone else who is a joint owner of the account. This gives you the opportunity to take advantage of each card’s bonus categories and earn the highest return on spending possible with your combination of cards, which may include cards that are no longer open to new applications.\n\nThough the Bilt World Elite Mastercard® (rates & fees) is issued by Wells Fargo, it earns Bilt Rewards points rather than Wells Fargo Rewards, which means balances between these two programs cannot be combined.\n\nFor most redemptions, using your Wells Fargo Rewards is a straightforward process. You can redeem them in a number of ways, including travel, as a statement credit toward your card balance, a cash withdrawal from an ATM, credit toward an eligible Wells Fargo loan (like a mortgage or personal loan), transferring them to travel partners or to buy gift cards or merchandise.\n\nTransfer Wells Fargo Rewards to Travel Partners\n\nTransferring rewards points to partner airlines and hotels can be the most complex redemption option, but it may also lead to outsized value. It’s not unheard of for points applied to award flights or free hotel nights to be worth two, three or even five cents per point.\n\nWells Fargo Rewards partners include:\n\nAer Lingus AerClub\n\nAir France-KLM Flying Blue\n\nAvianca Lifemiles\n\nBritish Airways Executive Club\n\nChoice Privileges\n\nIberia Plus\n\nCurrently, all airline transfers can be made at a 1:1 ratio. Transfers to Choice Privileges are at a 1:2 ratio, meaning that 10,000 Wells Fargo Rewards would convert to 20,000 Choice Privileges Rewards.\n\nWells Fargo doesn’t have any control over award availability or pricing with its transfer partners, so it’s best to confirm your travel reservations are available at an acceptable price before transferring your rewards. Once you’ve requested the transfer, the transaction is irreversible.\n\nUse the Wells Fargo Travel Portal\n\nWells Fargo Rewards can be used for various forms of travel including flights, hotels, cruises, car rentals or vacation packages. You can also use your rewards toward the cost of experiences, like a safari excursion, a tee time on the golf course or exploring ancient ruins.\n\nUnlike transferring your points directly to an airline or hotel, using the travel portal keeps your points worth an easy-to-remember one cent each. That might be a lower value than a points transfer, but it allows you to book with any brand of your choosing without worrying about blackout dates or other common availability restrictions.\n\nRedeem for Cash Back\n\nUsing your points for cash back takes on somewhat of a new meaning when it comes to Wells Fargo. In addition to using your points as a statement credit, you can also get cash back through an ATM. Redemptions are only available in $20 increments when you use a Wells Fargo ATM. There’s a minimum redemption of 2,000 points.\n\nRedeem for Purchases\n\nYou can redeem Wells Fargo Rewards for purchases you’ve already made with your card. You must have at least 100 points available in your account (worth $1), and you must have enough points to cover the entire transaction. When you redeem points for purchases, a statement credit is issued to your account, but you still need to pay the minimum payment.\n\nRedeem for Gift Cards\n\nWells Fargo has an extensive selection of gift cards that you can use your Wells Fargo Rewards to buy. Wells Fargo Rewards are worth 1 cent each when redeemed for gift cards.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Rewards site may run specials on gift cards where you can purchase them at a discount, allowing you to score a higher return on your points. Deals like this pop up more often around holidays.\n\nYou can also donate your Wells Fargo Rewards to charity by using them to purchase a CharityChoice gift card, a project of Special Kids Fund, or by redeeming them to support disaster relief via the American Red Cross.\n\nUse Wells Fargo Rewards Through PayPal\n\nLink your Wells Fargo card to PayPal Wallet and use your rewards for eligible purchases at checkout when you shop online. You don’t have to use all your rewards at once and can adjust the amount to use for the purchase.\n\nOther Ways To Use Wells Fargo Rewards\n\nLastly, you can redeem your Wells Fargo Rewards for merchandise. There are several categories you can choose from, including:\n\nHome decor\n\nBags and luggage\n\nCookware\n\nBed and bath\n\nSmall appliances\n\nSome of these categories have thousands of options. Whether or not the redemption is a good one will depend on the price charged by competitors. If you find an item cheaper elsewhere, remember you can redeem your Wells Fargo Rewards to your account and use the balance to fund the purchase from the cheaper retailer.\n\nHow Long Does It Take To Redeem Wells Fargo Rewards?\n\nRedemptions will show as deductions from your rewards balance immediately, but Wells Fargo says it may take five to seven business days for statement credits to appear on your account. Statement credits may reduce your balance, but you are still responsible for making payments if a payment is due.\n\nAir France-KLM Flying Blue\n\nFlying Blue is a program that requires some hunting to find a good deal, but when you know where to look, there are fantastic sweet spots. The loyalty scheme doesn’t publish an award chart, but you can find some great deals, particularly when flying to or from Europe. Flying Blue also offers discounts in the form of Promo Rewards: These are advertised specials on select routes, which may save you up to 25% compared to the standard price of an award ticket.\n\nAvianca LifeMiles\n\nA member of Star Alliance, Avianca LifeMiles provides access to a number of award redemptions on its own routes as well as partners like United, Lufthansa and Asiana, all without adding fuel surcharges to the cost of an award ticket. The mileage required for reward flights is competitive and it’s one of the few programs that provides discounts on premium tickets when one or more legs of your journey is only available in economy.\n\nChoice Privileges\n\nWhile Choice Privileges isn’t the most prestigious of all hotel programs, they have an expansive footprint across the United States and other countries, including properties in locations that may not be served by more upscale brands. Hotel redemptions begin at just 8,000 points for a free night, which is equivalent to only 4,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points thanks to a 1:2 transfer ratio."
