        "text": "The Card Design Studio service allows you to customize the look of your personal credit, debit, or business credit or debit card to create a unique, distinctive card that reflects your personality and interests or showcases your business. You can customize your card using your own image or logo , or select an image from our image library.\n\nTo get started, simply sign on to access Card Design Studio. Locate the card you wish to customize and click Customize Now. If you plan to use your own image to customize the design of your card, to save time we recommend that you make sure your image is ready to upload before you begin and that it complies with our image guidelines.\n\nIf your card is available for customization, you will find it listed as Eligible on the Card Design Studio service page. If you are a Wells Fargo customer, you can use the Card Design Studio service as long as:\n\nYou have an eligible and activated debit card. Debit cards not eligible for customization include The Private Bank Cards, ATM deposit cards, Campus Cards, and ATM cards.\n\nYou have an eligible and activated credit card. Credit cards not eligible for customization include AutographSM, Active Cash®, Reflect®, Cash Wise®, The Private Bank, and Wells Fargo Advisor cards.\n\nYour accounts are in good standing.\n\nYou have access to your cards via Wells Fargo Online®.\n\nSimply sign on to access Card Design Studio.\n\nPersonal Credit Cards with Multiple Cardholders\n\nIf you have a personal credit card with multiple cardholders, each card can be customized with a unique image or design. Account holders can customize a card for anyone on the account, including additional cardholders, but please note that all cardholders on the account will be issued a new card with a new expiration date each time any credit card on the account is customized. To prevent processing delays, we recommend that you customize all cards on the account within the same session.\n\nBusiness Cardholders\n\nEmployees and business owners can customize their own cards. Business credit cardholders can also customize the card of any authorized signer, provided they have access to the card via their Wells Fargo Business Online®.\n\nCards Unavailable for Customization\n\nIf you are a personal credit card customer, the Card Design Studio service is available for selected personal Visa® and Visa® Signature Cards. Autograph, Active Cash, Reflect, The Private Bank, Wells Fargo Advisor and Cash Wise credit Card products are not eligible for the Card Design Studio service.\n\nDebit cards not eligible for customization include The Private Bank Cards, ATM deposit cards, Campus Cards, and ATM cards.\n\nCards Temporarily Unavailable for Customization\n\nIf your card is listed on the Card Design Studio service page but the Status is not listed as Eligible, your card will be temporarily unavailable to customize because it is currently in one of the following statuses:\n\nCard Status—Processing. The Processing status indicates that you’ve recently requested a customized card and your selected image and customization are currently being reviewed for approval.\n\nCard Status—Available Soon. The Available Soon status indicates that you are not able to customize the design of your card at this time. Reasons for the Available Soon status include:\n\nYour card is about to expire. If your card is eligible for customization but is about to expire, it will be temporarily unavailable for customization. Once you receive and activate your reissued card that we will mail to you, your card will be listed as Eligible for customization on the Card Design Studio service page. Please note: There may be a slight delay before your new card is available for customization.\n\nYour card was recently lost or stolen. If you recently reported a lost or stolen card, your card will be assigned a new number and your previous card number will no longer be listed as eligible for customization. Once your new card number has been created, you will see your card listed as Eligible on the Card Design Studio service page.\n\nYou have a new card. If you just opened your account and only recently activated your card, there may be a slight delay before your new card is available for customization.\n\nCard Status—Customized. The Customized status indicates that Wells Fargo has approved your customized design and your new card has been issued.\n\nOnce your card is available to be customized, the card status will automatically change from Processing or Available Soon to Customized or Eligible on the Card Design Studio service page.\n\nPersonal Credit Cards with Multiple Cardholders\n\nIf you recently customized one or more personal credit cards, there will be a waiting period before you can customize additional cards on your account.\n\nTo customize the design of your card, you can select an image from our image library or upload your own image. Business customers can upload a company logo, a photo depicting your business “storefront,” or another image that captures an aspect of your business. Most images can be cropped, scaled, rotated, or flipped using tools provided in the Card Design Studio service.\n\nAll of the images in our image library are approved for use in the design of your card. If you choose to upload your own image, it must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\nImage Guidelines\n\nWells Fargo reserves the right to accept or reject any artwork, images or logos. The guidelines below will help you choose an acceptable image. If your image does not meet these image guidelines, or if we reject it for any other reason, we will send you an email and invite you to try again using a different image.\n\nFor all images you must:\n\nUse one of the following file formats: .jpeg, .jpg, .gif, .png, or .bmp.\n\nUpload a file that is less than ten megabytes (that is, 10 MB or 10,000 KB).\n\nOwn the image or have permission from the owner to use the image on your card.\n\nGet approval from the owner if you use any logo, name, or tag line that isn’t yours.\n\nFor background images you must have pixel dimensions that are greater than or equal to 840x840.\n\nFor photos and logos you must have pixel dimensions that are greater than or equal to 400x400.\n\nImages that include any of the following will be rejected:\n\nThird-party trademarks, logos, copyrighted materials, advertising, and branding.\n\nName, image and likeness of celebrities, musicians, athletes, entertainers, or other public figures.\n\nTelephone numbers, URLs, account numbers, addresses, or email addresses.\n\nCartoon characters or artwork that you have not created and/or do not have permission from the copyright owner to use.\n\nViolent, offensive, anti-social, or death imagery – including any other material that could be perceived as violent.\n\nProvocative, lewd, or sexual content – including nude, semi-nude, or partially clothed pictures of people of any age.\n\nDead animals, including game animals.\n\nPolitical or religious imagery or text.\n\nSymbols representing money or other content that might result in confusion at the merchant, or that might result in card fraud.\n\nSocially unacceptable or discriminatory behavior or signs (For example, gangs, hatred, drug or alcohol abuse, graffiti, profanity, or other obscene behavior or gestures).\n\nImages of flags, unless it is one of the flag-related images from our image library.\n\nPhotos altered using emojis or other images from third party phone app processes or features, including lens and filters.\n\nBusiness Customers\n\nBusiness cards may display your own company logo, an image depicting your business “storefront,” or another image that captures an aspect of your business, provided it meets the Image Guidelines listed above.\n\nCustomers with Multiple Cards\n\nYou may use the same image on all the cards on your accounts, or differentiate your cards using a distinct image for each card. You can only design one card at a time, so you will need to customize each card individually.\n\nRemoving Your Customization\n\nFor personal credit cards\n\nTo remove the customization from your card, please call us at 1-800-642-4720\n\nFor debit cards and business credit cards\n\nTo remove the customization from your card, simply visit the Card Design Studio service page and click Remove (listed under Next Steps). Alternately, you can call us at 1-800-225-5935 (for all business cards) or visit your nearest Wells Fargo branch (for all debit and prepaid cards).\n\nIf you decide to remove your customization, we will send you a Wells Fargo card with a standard non-customized Wells Fargo image.\n\nUpdating Your Customization\n\nYou can update your customization at any time. However, if you recently customized your debit or credit card, there may be a waiting period before you can submit your next customization request. To find out if your card is eligible for customization, please visit the Card Design Studio service page. Eligible cards will be listed with an Update link (listed under Next Steps)."
