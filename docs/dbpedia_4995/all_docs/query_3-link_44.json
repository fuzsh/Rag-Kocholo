        "text": "Find answers to questions about your credit card account, billing statements, payments, managing your account online, and contacting us.\n\nMy credit card account\n\nWhy did I receive a credit card?\n\nThe credit card from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is associated with the account you applied for when you recently financed a purchase. Use this card as a convenient way to make future purchases at participating businesses on the credit card program.\n\nIf you didn't apply for a credit card account with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., please contact us at\n\n1-877-805-7744.\n\nFor your protection, sign the back of your credit card and keep it in a secure location. If you haven't received your card within 7 – 10 days of being approved for credit, call 1-877-805-7744, Monday – Friday, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Central Time.\n\nIs this a one-time loan?\n\nNo, this is a credit card account financed through Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and monthly payments are required as long as you have an account balance. You can use your available credit over and over at participating businesses.\n\nWhat is the difference between this card and a general-purpose credit card?\n\nThis credit card, issued through Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is used for financing purchases at participating businesses that may offer special financing options. A general purpose credit card can be used for multiple types of purchases anywhere that card is accepted, but it generally doesn't offer special financing options. Please review your statement and materials that came with your credit card if you'd like more information.\n\nWhere can I use this card?\n\nYou can use your card again where you opened your account. For certain credit card programs, you may be able to find other businesses where you can use your card to finance additional products and services. Please review your statement and materials that came with your credit card for more details.\n\nAre there additional benefits of this card that I should be aware of?\n\nYes! Eligible Wells Fargo Online® customers get free access1 to Credit Close-Up® which includes:\n\nMonthly refresh of your FICO® Credit Score and Experian® credit report\n\nCredit monitoring alerts\n\nDebt-to-Income calculator and more\n\nLearn more\n\nWhen do my promotional terms end?\n\nIt depends on the type of financing promotion you have, but the date your special terms end is shown on your statement. Remember, reduced rate and 0% APR promotions apply to your financed purchase until the balance is paid in full. If you financed with a No Interest if Paid in Full promotion, interest accrues on the purchase balance at the regular APR for Purchases from the date of purchase on any outstanding balance. Paying only the minimum monthly payment will not pay off the purchase balance before the end of the promotional period. But, you won't pay any interest charges as long as you pay the purchase balance in full within the promotional period.\n\nWhat does Regular Terms mean, and when does it apply?\n\nRegular terms means the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for Purchases stated in your cardholder terms and conditions and will apply toward:\n\nCertain remaining balances not paid within the required promotional period\n\nFees\n\nPurchases made without special financing terms\n\nHow do I request a credit limit increase?\n\nPlease call Customer Service at 1-877-805-7744 to request a higher credit limit.\n\nWhy is my account closed?\n\nPlease call Customer Service at 1-877-805-7744.\n\nWhy did I get a call about my account?\n\nWe call cardholders to verify that their financed product or service has been received, to make sure customers are satisfied with their purchase, and to confirm that their account has been charged correctly.

Take the tour to learn more.\n\nHow do I set up automatic payments?\n\nYou can set up automatic payments through Wells Fargo Online. Or, you may call Customer Service at 1-877-805-7744 to request the enrollment form. It can take 30 - 60 days to process your automatic payment enrollment form. Continue making the minimum payment until your statement reflects that the automatic payment has been set up within the Important Information section on your statement.\n\nHow long should I allow for my payment to reach you?\n\nWe suggest allowing at least:\n\nWells Fargo Online payments\n\n3 - 5 business days using non-Wells Fargo bank accounts\n\n1 business day for Wells Fargo Online payments paid using Wells Fargo bank accounts\n\nBy mail: 7 - 10 business days\n\nBy phone: Same day (for payments by Midnight, Pacific Time)\n\nYou can choose to use a bill payment service other than Wells Fargo Online to make payments with us. Please refer to that service provider for the accuracy and timeliness of your online bill payments. For the other payment methods, please refer to the service provider for details.\n\nWhat happens if my payment is late?\n\nPlease make sure we receive your payment on or before the due date on your statement. Otherwise, late fees and/or interest may be applied to your account.\n\nTo avoid late fees, remember:\n\nYou must pay at least the minimum payment due each billing cycle on or before the minimum payment due date.\n\nSome electronic payment services still issue paper checks mailed through the U.S. postal service.\n\nMake sure there are enough funds in your bank account to cover the payment amount.\n\nAllow enough time for payments to reach us by the due date shown on your statement.\n\nYou can make one-time payments or schedule automatic payments through Wells Fargo Online.\n\nCan I change my payment due date?\n\nYes, you may be able to change the date your minimum payment is due at Wells Fargo Online or by calling Customer Service at 1-877-805-7744.

It can take up to two billing cycles to process the due date change. You still need to pay your minimum payment by the due date reflected on your statement until the change is processed.\n\nCan I pay ahead on my account?\n\nIf you want to pay more than the minimum payment, you can do that any time, but you must make at least the minimum payment every billing cycle. For example, if your minimum payment amount is $40 and you pay $80 by the due date in January, that amount won't cover both January and February minimum payments. You must still make the $40 minimum payment by the February due date.\n\nHow is my payment applied?\n\nYour payment applies first to the minimum payment due (including past due amounts) for that billing cycle. Anything over the minimum payment due generally applies first to No Interest if Paid in Full (deferred interest) promotions in the last two billing cycles before the expiration date of the promotion (when applicable); then to regular term balances with the highest APR to the lowest APR; and then to all other sub-accounts based on expiration date.
