        "text": "NEW HAVEN, Conn. â€“ Texas A&M football's Conner Weigman was named to the Walter Camp Player of the Year Preseason Watch List, presented by David McDermott Lexus, the Walter Camp Football Foundation announced Monday morning. The Walter Camp Award is the nation's fourth-oldest individual college football accolade.\n\nWeigman has completed 155-of-251 passes for 1,875 yards and 16 touchdowns in nine games at Texas A&M. The sophomore led the Aggies to a 2-1 start in 2023 before suffering a season-ending injury in Week 4. He passed for 979 yards on 82-of-119 attempts and eight touchdowns through the air, while adding 63 rushing yards on 12 carries and two scores a season ago. The Cypress, Texas, native tossed five touchdowns in the 2023 season opener, marking the most scoring strikes in regulation by an Aggie quarterback since Johnny Manziel in 2013. He set a career high in completions (31) at Miami in Week 2, followed by completing 25-of-29 passes for 337 yards and a score against ULM. The 86.2 completion percentage marked the highest (min. 20 attempts) in school history.\n\nThe Walter Camp Preseason Watch List will be narrowed to 10 semi-finalists in early November and three finalists will be announced on Nov. 26. The 2024 Walter Camp Player of the Year recipient, which is voted on by the 133 NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision head coaches and sports information directors, will be announced on the ESPN Home Depot College Football Awards Show held on Dec. 12."
