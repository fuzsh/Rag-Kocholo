Oil over a daguerreotype, 1852\n\nGranger holds millions of images spanning more than 25,000 years of world history, from before the Stone Age to the dawn of the Space Age\n\nMedia ID 10409994\n\n1852 Balcony Banker Banking Brick Daguerreotype San Francisco Sidewalk Storefront Wells Fargo\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nThis print takes us back to the bustling streets of San Francisco in 1852, capturing a significant landmark of that time - the Wells Fargo Bank. The image is an oil painting layered over a daguerreotype, creating a unique blend of artistic techniques from that era. The scene showcases the grandeur and architectural beauty of this historic bank building. Standing proudly amidst the city's evolving landscape, it exudes an air of confidence and prosperity. The brick exterior stands tall with its intricate detailing, while a charming balcony overlooks the vibrant street below. A group of well-dressed men can be seen on the sidewalk outside the bank's storefront, perhaps engaged in discussions related to banking or commerce. Their hats and attire reflect middle-class fashion trends prevalent during this period. This photograph not only captures a moment frozen in time but also serves as a testament to America's growing financial sector during the mid-19th century. It symbolizes progress and innovation as Wells Fargo played a crucial role in facilitating trade and commerce across the West Coast. As we admire this remarkable piece from Granger Art on Demand, let us appreciate how far we have come since then while acknowledging our roots and honoring those who laid down foundations for modern-day banking systems.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nSAFE SHIPPING\n\n30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
