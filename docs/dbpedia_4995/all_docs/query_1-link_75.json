        "text": "How long will the door be unlocked?\n\nAfter you have entered your PIN, the door will be unlocked for five (5) seconds before re-locking and requiring you to swipe your One Card and enter your PIN again.\n\nWhat if I forget my PIN?\n\nPlease come by the Golden Eagle One Card Office to create a new PIN if you do not remember your PIN. To ensure your security and privacy, we are unable to issue a PIN over the phone or email.\n\nWhat if there is an emergency? Who should I call?\n\nIn the event of an emergency, please contact Campus Police at (323) 343-3700.\n\nIs there an expiration date on my One Card?\n\nThe One Card is valid as long as you are employed and/or current enrolled student. However, the door access privileges will expire at the end of each term.\n\nWhat happens if my One Card is lost or stolen?\n\nYou should log in to your Transact eAccounts to deactivate your card using your CalStateLA email account credentials. Once login, select Card Services and click on \"Deactivate Card.\"\n\nIf you are unable to log in to your Transact eAccounts, please contact the Golden Eagle One Card Office at (323) 343-6800 immediately so that we can deactivate the card in question. You can then come in to obtain a new card for a $5.00 replacement fee.\n\nCan I lend my One Card to someone else?\n\nNo. For security reasons, we encourage you not to share your One Card. The owner of the One Card assumes all financial and criminal liability for any misuse.\n\nWhat is the Wells Fargo banking option that is available to Cal State L.A. One Card holders?\n\nWhen your Cal State L.A. One Card is linked to a Wells Fargo Everyday Checking account, you can use it to make PIN-debit purchases and for your free access to your cash at Wells Fargo ATMs nationwide. This is not a credit card. It is a debit card. Funds for ATM or PIN-debit transactions using your Cal State L.A. One Card are deducted from your primary linked Wells Fargo checking account.\n\nWhat do I need to bring to open a new Wells Fargo Everyday Checking account?\n\nYou will need two valid forms of identification:\n\nGovernment-issued identification card from the federal, state, tribal, or foreign government. Examples include: Driver's license, State issued ID card, passport, and military ID.\n\nSecondary identification from a recognized business, educational institution, or government agency. Examples include: Student ID, Social Security card, Resident Alien card, and Matricula card.\n\nWhat if I already have an existing Wells Fargo account?\n\nYou can LINK your new Cal State L.A. One Card to your existing Wells Fargo checking account by visiting the Wells Fargo banking location on campus in the University Student Union, Room 103.\n\nWhat should I do if my Cal State L.A. One Card is lost or stolen?\n\nFor cards that are linked to a Wells Fargo checking account, you must notify both the Golden Eagle One Card Office and Wells Fargo as soon as possible. Lost One Cards without the banking option only need to be reported to the Golden Eagle One Card Office.\n\nIs there a monthly service fee associated with the Wells Fargo Everyday Checking account?\n\nCal State LA students who open a Wells Fargo Everyday Checking account will have their monthly service fee waived by linking their account to their Cal State LA OneCard. This benefit is available for currently enrolled Cal State LA students.\n\nWhere can I open a new Wells Fargo Everyday Checking account?\n\nOpen your Wells Fargo Everyday Checking account at the on-campus Wells Fargo banking location in the University Student Union, Room 103. To speak to a Wells Fargo banker for additional information, please call 323-224-3972.\n\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A. Member FDIC."
