After each performance, enjoy curated food and drink specials at participating restaurant locations at Hudson Yards.\n\nDuring the Summer Concert Series, Wells Fargo customers receive exclusive access to the Wells Fargo Customer Lounge in The Bosque, with complimentary snacks and beverages. Click here to learn more.\n\nKeke Palmer is an Emmy Award-winning actress, singer/songwriter, producer, author, television host, and a passionate voice of the millennial generation. Since debuting her first studio album So Uncool in 2007, Palmer has released three mixtapes, one compilation album, and four EPs. She released her second studio album, Big Boss, in May 2023 with an accompanying sold out tour along with a subsequent deluxe album, featuring four new singles.\n\nChayce Beckham is one of the most buzzed about newcomers in country music today, having won over millions of hearts while competing on Season 19 of American Idol. From the first audition, superstar Katy Perry highlighted how Chayce's gravelly vocals sound like “the heart of America.” Armed with a determination to make something of himself and the unwavering support of his family, Chayce auditioned for the competition show after undergoing a particularly difficult year to ultimately become the first-ever show winner to claim the title with an original song—kickstarting his journey to fulfilling his lifelong dream of becoming a singer, songwriter and entertainer.\n\nSince first stepping into the pop spotlight at age 17, David Archuleta has embodied the kind of genuine star power that can’t be manufactured. After years of dazzling audiences with his radiant personality and phenomenal voice—the Miami-born singer/songwriter experienced a major personal transformation that radically altered his identity as an artist. As shown on his recent single “Hell Together,” Archuleta has dramatically expanded the landscape of his songwriting and devoted himself to making pop music with equal parts uncompromising emotion and exhilarating impact. As he continues to unlock new levels of freedom in his music and beyond, Archuleta has found an endless source of inspiration in his growing passion for dancing, raves, and festival culture.\n\nHailing from Western Massachusetts, the New York-based singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist went from playing open mics and coffeehouses to making history as “the youngest champion ever on NBC’s The Voice.” Standing on the precipice of adulthood, Brynn chronicles growing up in real-time on her aptly titled full-length debut album, Out of The Blue. She vividly depicts the complexities of relationships, leaving home, and finding purpose. Brynn makes the kind of pop music you can practically see unfold in front of you—in hues of blue.\n\nTrousdale is a powerful female band consisting of Quinn D’Andrea, Georgia Greene and Lauren Jones. Their melodic and heartfelt harmonies are often compared to The Chicks and The Staves, but the girls draw inspiration from a wide array of music, including Crosby Stills and Nash, Kacey Musgraves and HAIM.\n\nBeach Weather catches a vibe somewhere between the most disparate of extremes. They write hooks universal enough for even the biggest arena full of people, yet introspective enough for even the most introverted wallflower to ponder. Their breezy guitars and sun-soaked choruses barely veil an honest exploration of emotional tumult, anxiety, and loneliness. Musically, the group teeters on an axis of nostalgic melodies and future-facing provocation."
