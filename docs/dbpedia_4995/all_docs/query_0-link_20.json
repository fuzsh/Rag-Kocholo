        "text": "(Background sound: horses galloping. Horses pulling a stagecoach with two men riding on top appear at a distance in a grassy meadow with a blue sky.)\n\nhey-yeah\n\n(Background sound continues: The narrator begins to speak.)\n\nWells Fargo Bank’s new character checkbook has the kind of men who came West and left the others behind. There’s Buffalo Bill from Scott County Iowa,\n\n(Background sound continues: When the narrator says “… There’s Buffalo Bill from Scott County Iowa, …,” the shot zooms in closer on the two men. One is holding the reigns and driving the stagecoach, the other is holding a shotgun. The heads of the horses are close, and the camera pans left as the stagecoach passes by.)\n\nJoshua Norton self-appointed Emperor of the United States, around the horn in ’49, Wyatt Earp out of Monmouth Illinois,\n\n(Background sound continues: When narrator says “… Wyatt Earp out of Monmouth Illinois,” the shot changes to a wide view of the stagecoach and team of 6 horses galloping through a wide-open field. The grass in the field is brown and there is a big blue sky above. A few sparse trees are in the background.)\n\nMark Twain from Monroe County Missouri, and they are all on new character checks.\n\n(When the narrator says, “and they are all on new character checks.” The horses and stagecoach stop their motion and the screen begins to narrow and a black frame appears around the image. The words Wells Fargo Bank appear in the upper left of the image and the whole image transitions into a stagecoach check. The background sound of horses galloping stops when the motion stops.)\n\nOh of course we still have Wells Fargo’s famous stagecoach checks.\n\n(When the narrator says, “Oh of course we still have Wells Fargo’s famous stagecoach checks,” The check transitions to the upper right of the screen and three additional checks with stagecoach themes appear. They are grouped together and clockwise from top left are; A grey background with a white silhouette of the stagecoach and horses; the previously described stagecoach and horses in a open field; an orange check with the stagecoach and horses riding into a bright yellow sunset; and an orange check with the stagecoach and horses featured in the center of the check. On the bottom of the screen in the black framing, in white text, appears the words: “They say you’re part of the west.”)\n\nA 1971 TV commercial for the scenic stagecoach check featured running horses, who wore makeup to resemble the horses on the checks, and a rolling stagecoach. Similar commercials ran from 1968 until the 1970s. (30 seconds) Photo Credit: Wells Fargo Corporate Archives."
