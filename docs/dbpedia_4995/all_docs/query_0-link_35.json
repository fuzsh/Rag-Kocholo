        "text": "Greta Van Fleet visited Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia on Tuesday, September 19, 2023. The band is currently touring the world on their Starcatcher World Tour promoting their new album Starcatcher. The album features “Meeting The Master,” and “Farewell For Now,” as its top singles.\n\nGreta Van Fleet at Wells Fargo Center\n\nThe band’s Philadelphia date was just another huge MMR Concert Event. The US leg of the tour continues through September 23, when the band will play one show in Cleveland, Ohio. Then, they will depart, heading for Germany for their first European date on November 6.\n\nGreta Van Fleet is a band comprised of three brothers and one childhood friend hailing from Michigan. Formed in 2012, the band has since released three full-length albums. Anthem of the Peaceful Army, The Battle at Garden’s Gate, and now Starcatcher. The Kiszka brothers: Josh, Jake, and Sam, along with Danny Wagner burst onto the scene with From The Fires, their 2017 EP.\n\n93.3 WMMR and The Local Concert Scene\n\n93.3 WMMR has been a part of the local concert scene for over 50 years. Our dedicated staff of on-air personalities consistently continues to travel to venues in the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding area to see some of the best performers in the world.\n\nThe presence of WMRR DJs at local concert venues continues to be one of the hallmarks of the station and the undying passion we have for Rock & Roll. Check back at WMMR.com and all the station’s social media platforms for the latest concert coverage in addition to music news and everything that’s happening at the station."
