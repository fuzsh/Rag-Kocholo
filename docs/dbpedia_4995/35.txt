Personalize your Wells Fargo Card with images that reflect what’s important to you.

You can customize your card by putting one of your own photos right on your card, or choose an image from our online image library. Here are some ideas to get you started:

A favorite photo of family or friends

A picture of your pet

Your child’s artwork

An image of your favorite hobby or other interest

The Card Design Studio service is only available for customers who already have an eligible Wells Fargo Credit Card. Once your new card arrives, you can create a custom card that’s as unique as you are. All Wells Fargo Credit Cards are subject to credit qualification.
