"That suspect go out of the SUV and began immediately ransacking a display case. At that point, two more unknown suspects exited out of another vehicle which was parked at the curb in front of the building," FBI special agent Brian Weber told KCBS.

Weber said the suspects held a guard at gunpoint while committing the robbery and then drove away in the car that had been parked in front of the building.

"The suspects all wore black ski masks and black gloves during this incident and really all we can say at this time is that they are male and approximately 6 feet in height," he said.

The photos taken from surveillance show the SUV after it had crashed through the front of the museum, as well as at least two of the three suspects.
