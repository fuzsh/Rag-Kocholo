        "text": "The St. Louis Blues have been a part of the NHL since 1967. In 2018-19, the Blues crafted one of the most historic seasons in the history of sports, climbing from last place in the standings halfway through the season to capturing the franchise’s first Stanley Cup Championship.\n\nDuring more than 50 years of operation, the organization has established itself as one of the premier professional sports franchises in the country. With nine division titles, a Presidents’ Trophy and more than 20 former team members enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame, the Blues have etched one of the most storied histories in the NHL. Through their history, the Blues have hosted more than 35 million fans and invested millions in the St. Louis community via Blues for Kids, the team’s charitable foundation."
