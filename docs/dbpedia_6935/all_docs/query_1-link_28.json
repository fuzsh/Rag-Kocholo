        "text": "The state came very close to legalizing sports betting in 2022, but ultimately came up just short.\n\nSupporters of legalized sports betting in the state legislature are a persistent bunch, not giving up on their dream of sportsbook apps becoming available in the state. In 2024, HB 2331, a bill to legalize and regulate mobile sports wagering, was introduced and passed out of the House of Representatives Special Committee on Public Policy by a 5-2 vote. The vote was the first step in the legislative process toward legalization. The bill would also allow for retail sportsbooks at existing casinos and would let professional sports facilities open up retail sportsbooks as well. Check out this SportsHandle article for more on HB 2331.\n\n‚öñÔ∏èIs Missouri sports betting legal?No. üö´What is the legal betting age in MO?21+ üì≤How many potential sportsbooks are there in MO?7 üìåCan you use DraftKings Sportsbook in Missouri?No, you can't.\n\nBelow we‚Äôll cover all aspects of sports betting in Missouri. This includes current gaming infrastructure, to early attempts at sports betting, to the 2022 effort. Plus, we‚Äôll forecast what the future might hold for the Show-Me State.\n\nWhile Missouri waits for sports betting legislation, Kansas has already crossed the finish line. Bettors in Missouri can stroll across the state line and wager legally with any of Kansas‚Äô top sports betting apps. You just need to be inside the state of Kansas when you place your bet.\n\nGambling in Missouri\n\nMissouri has a long history of in-state gambling, originating in 1984 when the ‚ÄúShow Me State‚Äù first approved its very own state lottery. Much like many of the other states bordering the Mississippi River, Missouri decided to legalize riverboat casinos in 1992. That made it one of the first Midwestern states to authorize casino gambling of any kind.\n\nThe decision also resulted in the foundation of the Missouri Gaming Commission. That was a unit developed to regulate the state‚Äôs riverboat casinos. The first two casino boats officially set sail in 1994, marking the first time legalized casino gambling took place in Missouri.\n\nThe Missouri Gaming Commission still exists today. It oversees all gaming in the state, from the riverboat casinos to daily fantasy sports contests.\n\nDaily fantasy betting and HB 2320\n\nSimilar to casino gambling, daily fantasy sports were not offered in Missouri for quite some time. All of that changed in 2016, when the state legalized and began regulating DFS contests offered by various third-party operators.\n\nThis was a vital part of the ongoing process toward legalizing sports betting in Missouri, as House Bill 2320, a placeholder used to jumpstart the sports betting conversation in the state, proposed the idea of allowing DFS operators to add sports betting to their menu of services.\n\nWith top-notch bookmakers like FanDuel and DraftKings already offering DFS platforms in Missouri, the idea of adding sports betting only made sense.\n\nBut House Bill 2320 would end up being just the first of many attempts to legalize sports betting in Missouri. Nearly four years later, lawmakers in the state continue to weigh their options in hopes of getting it done soon.\n\nCheck out the rest of this page for a detailed history of the state‚Äôs ongoing legal battle, potential future operators, banking options, and everything else there is to know about legalized sports betting in Missouri.\n\nMissouri sports betting FAQ\n\n2018: Sports betting conversation begins\n\nThe journey to legalizing Missouri sports betting officially began in January, 2018. House Bill 2320 was introduced by Representative Bart Korman at the state‚Äôs 99th General Assembly. The bill‚Äôs purpose was to jumpstart the legal sports betting conversation in Missouri.\n\nIt would ‚Äúauthorize the Missouri Gaming Commission to establish standards and procedures for sports wagering‚Äù in the state, if passed.\n\nIf approved, HB 2320 would allow any person or entity that is licensed to operate excursion gambling boats to begin offering sports wagering as well.\n\nThe bill also suggested the idea of allowing daily fantasy sports providers, like DraftKings or FanDuel, to add sports betting to their menu of available offerings. The first known version of HB 2320 failed to mention any details in regards to licensing, fees, or taxes.\n\nMajor League Baseball, National Basketball Association get involved\n\nIn February, 2018, a new, unnamed Missouri sports betting bill was introduced. This was being pushed by Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. The two leagues did so in hopes of acquiring data rights, along with receiving a 1% integrity fee on each bet placed.\n\nLater that month, two bills known as the ‚ÄúComprehensive Missouri Sports Betting and Sports Protection Act‚Äù were brought to the table courtesy of state senator Denny Hoskins (Senate Bill 1013) and state representative Dean Plocher (House Bill 2535).\n\nBoth bills would authorize sports betting on Missouri‚Äôs riverboats and online, along with adhering to MLB and the NBA‚Äôs requests to control league data and receive integrity fees. The bills also included a 12% tax on adjusted gross receipts and a 2% administrative fee for the Gaming Commission Fund.\n\nIn March, a few weeks after each of the aforementioned bills seemed to stall a bit, legislators added new sports betting language into Senate Bill 767, a preexisting bill centered around video gaming.\n\nThe modified bill described how existing casinos would handle sports betting, including the implementation of retail books at these locations. The bill also detailed the application process for those seeking a license. If passed, SB767 would include:\n\na $10,000 application fee,\n\na $5,000 annual renewal fee,\n\nthe same 12% tax rate, and\n\n2% administrative fee mentioned in the Comprehensive Missouri Sports Betting and Sports Protection Act above.\n\nMovement stalls, Greitens controversy to blame\n\nUnfortunately, the new SB 767 didn‚Äôt make the cut for the Missouri House Budget Committee‚Äôs public hearing in April. The hearing entailed lawmakers reviewing three separate pieces of legislation, including the original House Bill 2320.\n\nDean Plocher‚Äôs HB 2535, one half of the Comprehensive Missouri Sports Betting and Sports Protection Act, would also be examined, along with a new House Bill 2406. Introduced by Representative Justin Alferman, HB 2406 called for a 6.25% tax on sports betting revenues, as opposed to the 12% rate proposed by HB 2535.\n\nBoth HB 2406 and HB 2535 would also allow for sports betting on mobile under the condition that players register for an account in person.\n\nThe hearing ended without an agreement, thus leaving the discussion on the table. After a quiet few weeks, Korman referenced Gov. Eric Greitens‚Äô ongoing sexual assault allegations.\n\nThat was a part of the reason why legislation was unlikely to pass before the May 18 deadline. It ultimately ended up being correct. No bill was passed, officially closing the books on any hopes of legalizing sports betting in Missouri in 2018.\n\nTwo new bills at the end of the year\n\nPlocher remained persistent, stating in November 2018 that he anticipated the Missouri sports betting discussion to pick up again when the House and Senate returned to session in January 2019.\n\nA few days later, Hoskins pre-filed another bill for 2019, one that would cut the proposed 1% integrity fee in half to 0.5%, redirecting all proceeds to an ‚ÄúEntertainment Facilities Infrastructure Fund‚Äù that would go towards improving the state‚Äôs convention centers and recreational facilities.\n\nAside from this caveat, Hoskins‚Äô new bill was essentially a copy of SB 1013.\n\nHouse Bill 119, a pre-filed sports betting bill courtesy of Representative Cody Smith, was also thrown into the fire in December 2018.\n\nSmith‚Äôs bill provided a major twist on the aforementioned league fees, offering a .75% royalty fee to the professional leagues and a .25% royalty fee to the NCAA for wagers involving at least one FBS football team or Division I men‚Äôs basketball team.\n\nThe bill also stated that any royalties received by public universities would be ‚Äòused solely for athletics compliance‚Äô and offered a much lower 6.25% tax on adjusted gross revenue.\n\n2019: Key issues halt progress\n\nMissouri‚Äôs 2019 legislative session kicked off with three bills in circulation: Hoskins‚Äô SB 44, Smith‚Äôs HB 119, and Senator Lincoln Hough‚Äôs new Senate Bill 222, which came with a 6.75% proposed tax rate.\n\nSB 44 wasn‚Äôt particularly welcomed by the Senate during an early February hearing. It was largely in part because of its proposed integrity fee.\n\nHough‚Äôs SB 222 fared better in front of the Senate Economic Development Committee. It was opposed by the professional leagues because it didn‚Äôt give them a payout. House Bill 859, the House version of Hough‚Äôs Senate Bill 222, also surfaced during this time and received a second reading right out of the gate.\n\nIn April, 2019, after months of deciding which direction the state would like to go, the Missouri House committee became the first in the nation‚Äôs history to advance a sports betting bill that included royalty fees benefiting the professional sports leagues and the NCAA.\n\nHB 119, pre-filed in December 2018 by Smith, was amended to include a 0.6 percent ‚Äúentry and facilities infrastructure fee‚Äù and would allow for up to three online ‚Äúskins‚Äù per license holder. The House General Laws Committee voted it through, 7-3, and HB 119 to legalize Missouri sports betting would now move onto the House floor.\n\nHearings\n\nMonths went by with little progress. Then, a hearing was held by the Special Interim Committee on Gaming in the Missouri House of Representatives in October 2019 to discuss sports betting, DFS, and video lottery terminals.\n\nAmong the key issues debated were the league‚Äôs integrity fees and whether players will be allowed to register for an account online, both seemingly holding back the process.\n\nAfter attending five hearings on sports betting towards the end of the 2019 calendar year, members of the Special Interim Committee on Gaming believed that the reluctance to pass Missouri sports betting legislation was going to end up harming the state, as 18 others would have legalized sports betting by the turn of 2020.\n\nThe pre-filing window for 2020 opened up on Dec. 1, 2019 and was immediately greeted by Senate Bill 567 from Hoskins and Senate Bill 754 courtesy of Senator Tony Luetkemeyer. Both bills called for state-wide Missouri mobile sports betting, royalties to be paid to the professional leagues and the NCAA, and a data mandate.\n\nBoth bills would also allow for remote registration, but differed greatly in terms of taxes and fees:\n\n2020: Pandemic looms large\n\nMissouri‚Äôs 2020 legislative session got off to a hot start on Jan. 30 when Representative Dan Shaul‚Äôs House Bill 2088 cleared the state‚Äôs House Special Committee on Government Oversight.\n\nThe bill, which sought to legalize both retail and online sports betting in the state, came with a 0.25% royalty to the professional leagues and the NCAA, a 9% tax rate on sports betting revenue, and an official league data requirement.\n\nUnder HB 2088, future operators would be required to pay $25,000 to apply for a Missouri sports betting license, $50,000 for the license itself if selected, and an additional fee of $10,000 every five years. On top of sports betting, HB 2088 also addressed video lottery terminals.\n\nAbout one month later on Feb. 26, lawmakers at one of the state‚Äôs hearings began to discuss the ongoing controversy surrounding official league data.\n\nSmith, the original sponsor of HB 119 sports betting bill, unveiled House Bill 2284 at the hearing. It originally required sportsbooks to pay a 0.25% royalty to the MGC on ‚Äúsporting events conducted by registered sports governing bodies.‚Äù\n\nThis caveat was later removed by Smith, who appeared before the Missouri House Special Committee on Government Oversight alongside Representative Phil Christofanelli, a Republican who authored House Bill 2318.\n\nHB 2318 did not include any provisions on official league data, proposed a 6.75% tax rate on sports betting revenue, and was weighed by the committee with the intent of combining it with HB 2284.\n\nUnfortunately for residents of Missouri, the COVID-19 pandemic affected effectively ended any possibility of lawmakers getting sports betting legislation done in 2020.\n\nThree new bills filed in December\n\nBy December 2020, both Hoskins (Senate Bill 18) and Luetkemeyer (Senate Bill 217) pre-filed their own respective sports betting bills to be presented at the 2021 session. Joining them with a third bill was Senator Caleb Rowden with his Senate Bill 256.\n\nAll three bills would legalize retail and mobile sports betting under the condition that platforms are tethered to brick-and-mortars in the state and overseen by the Missouri Gaming Commission.\n\nLike many of the state‚Äôs previous competing bills, the three bills differed in terms of application fees, tax rates, royalties, and the ongoing issue surrounding official league data.\n\n2021: Hoskins prepares loaded super-bill\n\nIn February 2021, Missouri lawmakers met to discuss the pre-filed sports betting bills from Hoskins, Luetkemeyer, and Rowden. The Missouri Gaming Commission showed early favoritism to Rowden‚Äôs SB 256.\n\nHoskins took control of the floor for most of the hearing, pestering Rowden about his bill‚Äôs minuscule proposed tax rate of 6.75%, which would easily be one of the lowest in the U.S. In comparison, Hoskins‚Äô SB 98 would call for a 9% tax rate.\n\nIt would provide a royalty fee to the professional leagues, and would require the use of official league data. The Missouri Gaming Commission seemed to oppose all of them. Unfortunately for Hoskins, SB 98 failed to get voted off the Senate floor. That ruined any chances of getting it approved in 2021.\n\nIn late July, it was reported that Hoskins had already been preparing plans for a massive sports betting and gaming bill ahead of the Dec. 1 pre-filing window, in hopes of finally getting a legalization done in 2022.\n\nHoskins‚Äô super-bill would include sports betting, horse racing, slot machines at non-casino locations, and even betting on esports.\n\nBoth Hoskins and Rep. Dan Shaul, who cited bordering states with legal sports betting as one of the main reasons Missouri needed to move fast, would file respective sports betting bills that would resemble Hoskins‚Äô SB 98.\n\nThe pair of 2022-centric bills would include retail wagering at existing casinos, statewide digital sports betting, and reasonable tax rates and fees. Among the topics up for discussion would be:\n\nThe use of official league data;\n\nWagering on Missouri colleges/college sports;\n\nIn-person registration;\n\nWagering at pro sports venues.\n\nMissouri professional sports teams make strong push\n\nIn October, a Missouri lawyer filed nine ballot initiative petitions with the secretary of state‚Äôs office that, if passed, would effectively legalize sports betting in the state.\n\nThe proposal would appoint the Missouri Gaming Commission to regulate all wagering. It would also limit betting to professional sports teams only. All tax dollars gained would be used to improve Missouri‚Äôs education system and road projects.\n\nEach of the nine proposals, which are backed by the Kansas City Chiefs, Kansas City Royals, St. Louis Blues, and St. Louis City Soccer Club, would prevent Missourians from wagering on college sports, regardless of whether or not the game involves an in-state school.\n\nHouse Bill 1666\n\nAs soon as the calendar turned to December, the first sports betting bill of 2022 was filed by Rep. Christofanelli. He authored House Bill 2318 two years before. House Bill 1666 would call for a 6.75% tax rate and no league data mandate. It would also allow for sports governing bodies to ban specific events or bet types if necessary.\n\nLicensees would get hit with a $50,000 application fee upfront along with an additional $20,000 in administrative fees. They would get another $20,000 in renewal fees in order to ensure their license remains active.\n\nThe Missouri Gaming Commission would oversee all operations. Third-party commercial operators would need to partner up with the state‚Äôs existing gambling boats in order to offer online wagering.\n\nHouse Bill 2080\n\nA fifth Missouri sports betting bill, from Shaul, was filed at the end of December. Shaul‚Äôs HB 2080 would call for statewide digital wagering with no requirement for in-person registration.\n\nIt would also call a $50,000 application fee, and a 6.75% tax rate. It would allow bettors to wager on professional, college, amateur, and esports events. The condition would be that sports governing bodies have the right to ban or prohibit specific markets.\n\n2022: Missouri gets close, but no cigar\n\nJanuary got off to a hot start, as six of Missouri‚Äôs professional sports teams and casino operators banded together to back a proposal that would allow for statewide mobile betting tethered to existing retail locations.\n\nUnder this legislation, the Royals, Chiefs, Blues, St. Louis City SC, and Kansas City Current would each be in line to receive an online skin or mobile platform. Casino operators would be entitled to three online skins per physical property owned ‚Äì capped at six total skins. Tax would be set at 10% and the deal would include an official league data mandate.\n\nIn response to the pro team-casino operator proposal, Sen. Dan Hegeman and Luetkemeyer each filed bills reflecting a similar layout. Both Hegeman‚Äôs SB 1046 and Luetkemeyer‚Äôs SB 1061 would call for a $50,000 application fee for retail licenses, a $100,000 fee for digital licenses. It would allow teams to:\n\nBuild a sports district around their venues;\n\nAppoint the Missouri Gaming Commission as regulator;\n\nSet the tax rate at 10%;\n\nAllow for the use of official league data on specific bets.\n\nHoskins immediately expressed his concerns with the supergroup‚Äôs plans, as the longtime sports betting-backer continued to push for video lottery terminals in the state, something many others have opposed.\n\nPromotional write-offs, problem gambling funding among key issues\n\nA discussion among the Missouri House Committee took place in late February. There was a pair of new proposals in HB 2502 and HB 2556 headlining the talks. The bills‚Äô proposed tax rate of 10% resulted in backlash from various members of the committee, drawing comparisons to neighboring Illinois‚Äô 15% tax rate.\n\nThe committee also took issue with the bills calling for just $250,000 to be allocated to problem gambling services. They were claiming the number was far too low. This caveat would prove to be a dealbreaker of sorts, as the committee declined to discuss or vote on the bills just a few days later.\n\nThey cited three key areas to address when making changes to their proposal:\n\nProblem gambling;\n\nOff-site wagering fees;\n\nPromotional write-offs.\n\nIn early March, the Missouri House Committee consolidated HB 2502 and HB 2556 into one solid bill to be known as HB 2502 in the House Special Committee on Public Policy. An amendment was added to the bill to raise the commitment for problem and responsible gambling from $250,000 to $500,000, thus getting the committee on board.\n\nThe amendment also tinkered with promotional play write-offs, now allowing brands a 100% write-off in the first year, with steps down over the following five years.\n\nAmendment 3 passed the committee, along with the consolidated bill, and was sent to the House floor. Despite this, both Chair Scott Cupps and Vice Chair Dottie Bailey continued to express concerns with the proposal.\n\nCupps discussed the possibility of pledging even more money towards problem and responsible gambling. They raised the proposed tax rate of 10%, and hashed out the ongoing issue surrounding off-site user fees.\n\nThe debate continued\n\nLater that month, Missouri‚Äôs House approved HB 2502 and HB 2556 to the Senate for further consideration. The bills, backed by a series of Missouri casinos and professional sports teams, would allow for statewide mobile wagering as well as retail wagering at existing brick-and-mortar casinos and carry a much lower tax rate of 8%.\n\nHoskins continued to oppose the low tax rate. He suggested his own proposal of 21% would generate more funds for the state‚Äôs educational system.\n\nA heated debate between the state of Kansas and the state of Missouri ensued in early April. Kansas City Chiefs were the main topic of discussion. Representatives from the team did their best to downplay any rumors of a possible relocation from Missouri to Kansas.\n\nThey stated that the franchise is committed to its current lease at Arrowhead Stadium. They explained that this location is set to run for at least nine more years.\n\nThe talks occurred after Kansas legislators added a late amendment to their sports betting bill that would devote 80% of tax dollars earned towards causes used to attract professional sports franchises into the state.\n\nIn late April, HB 2552, a bill sponsored by Rep. Dan Houx and backed by Missouri‚Äôs sports teams and casinos, was placed on the Senate‚Äôs ‚ÄúInformal Calendar for Perfect‚Äù. It happened after the General Accountability and Fiscal Oversight Committee labeled it as a ‚Äúdo pass‚Äù.\n\nIf approved, the bill‚Äôs proposed 8% tax rate would likely increase, along with the addition of stronger problem and responsible gambling language.\n\nHoskins remains determined despite missing out on 2022\n\nLater that week, Hoskins put an end to the two sports betting bills that opposed his views, delivering a four-hour filibuster in front of a Senate chamber that was hardly filled.\n\nIn the end, the biggest advocate for Missouri sports betting over the years ended up being the biggest roadblock of all. It was largely because the proposed initiatives did not involve Hoskins‚Äô requested video lottery terminals.\n\nIn exchange for crushing the bills, Hoskins offered up 153 other amendments to the chamber ‚Äì one for every $1 million in tax revenue that he claimed would be lost by the state if sports betting is legalized without the implementation of video lottery terminals.\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, a stand-alone sports betting bill was presented to stakeholders on the night, nine days before the session was set to end. The proposal boasted a 15% tax rate, a $1.25 million annual fee per skin, three skins per casino company (capped at six), and one skin per professional sports team.\n\nThe bill did not include a full-blown legalization of Hoskins‚Äô video lottery terminals. It would allow players to place parlays at lottery retailers throughout the state.\n\nImmediately after those discussions ended, Hoskins took to Twitter to announce that although he attempted to pass a sports betting bill that night, he ultimately ‚Äúran into some resistance‚Äù and would be unable to do so. After being pestered by Senator Bill White over various concerns, Hoskins decided to pull the amendment and once again return to the drawing board.\n\nMissouri sports betting right now\n\nSo, where does sports betting currently stand in Missouri? In early February 2024, legislation to legalize sports betting in the state was introduced and passed by a committee of jurisdiction, the first step on the long legislative road toward legalization. We remain hopeful that 2024 will be the year that sports betting finally becomes legal in the Show Me State.\n\nPotential online sportsbook operators in MO\n\nIf and when a proposal makes its way to the ballot and sports betting is eventually legalized in Missouri, commercial operators would certainly line up fast. While nothing is set in stone, various context clues can give us an idea on which brands are likely to arrive with the Missouri online market.\n\nCaesars Sportsbook\n\nThe entertainment giant already owns and operates multiple casinos in the state. That includes Harrah‚Äôs North Kansas City, Horseshoe St. Louis, and Isle of Capri Boonville. It makes Caesars Sportsbook a clearcut option to launch in Missouri.\n\nESPN BET\n\nSimilar to Caesars Entertainment, Penn Entertainment already owns and operates its fair share of physical properties in the state.\n\nBetween the Argosy Casino Riverside, Hollywood Casino St. Louis, and River City Casino, PENN should have more than enough mobile skins at its disposal to ensure a skin for ESPN BET.\n\nBetRivers\n\nIn February 2022, Rush Street Interactive announced that it had entered into a strategic partnership agreement with PENN Entertainment. The deal effectively grants the company market access in Missouri, joining four other states currently awaiting BetRivers‚Äò arrival.\n\nThe popular sportsbook brand is already live in plenty of states. It should be considered a lock to add Missouri to its list following the news.\n\nBally Bet\n\nBally Bet is another up-and-coming online platform that is still working to get situated throughout the United States. Bally Bet is live in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Indiana, New York, Virginia and Ontario.\n\nUsing its Bally‚Äôs Kansas City location as a point of entry, expect Bally Bet to make a push into Missouri at some point down the road.\n\nFanDuel\n\nNot only has FanDuel been providing its Daily Fantasy Sports services to Missouri since 2016, but the brand also has a longstanding relationship with Boyd Gaming, which owns and operates multiple casino properties in the state.\n\nBoyd Gaming also owns a small stake in FanDuel and even agreed to a strategic partnership deal with the brand in 2018, setting up FanDuel-branded retail sportsbooks at Boyd properties across the nation. With both the Ameristar Casino St. Charles and Kansas City currently up for grabs, we anticipate FanDuel linking up with Boyd Gaming ahead of any Missouri moves.\n\nDraftKings\n\nDraftKings, like FanDuel, has been offering its DFS product in the state since 2016. Unlike FanDuel, DraftKings does not have any pre-existing ties to the Missouri casino market.\n\nRegardless, the bookmaking brand is easily one of the biggest in the nation. It is currently live in more than fifteen different states from Oregon to Connecticut. DraftKings should have no problem acquiring market access in Missouri if it chooses to do so.\n\nPotential land-based sportsbooks in MO\n\nMissouri is home to its fair share of brick-and-mortar casinos. It leaves plenty of options open for whichever brands decide to eventually open up a retail sportsbook in the state. We expect all of the following locations to pursue sports betting opportunities when granted the ability to do so.\n\nBanking options in MO\n\nUpon arrival, all of Missouri‚Äôs online sports betting platforms should offer players the same incredible deposit and withdrawal options previously used throughout other states. Missouri-based bettors can expect some variation of the following banking methods, depending on which provider they choose:\n\nSports markets in MO\n\nAs soon as legalized sports betting goes live in Missouri, players will gain access to a wide range of sports markets to bet on. Home to some of the most successful franchises in professional sports over the past decade or so, Missouri is sure to cover all of the bases.\n\nWhether you want to bet on Patrick Mahomes to lead the Kansas City Chiefs to another Super Bowl, the St. Louis Blues to replicate their magical run from 2019, or the St. Louis Cardinals to pull off another David Freese-esque miracle in the World Series, Missouri online sportsbooks should have it all.\n\nPlayers can expect to choose from, but will not be limited to, the following sports markets:\n\nBaseball (MLB)\n\nBasketball (NBA, NCAAB)\n\nBoxing\n\nCricket\n\nFootball (NFL, NCAAF)\n\nGolf (PGA)\n\nHockey (NHL)\n\nMMA\n\nRugby\n\nSoccer\n\nTennis\n\nBet types in MO\n\nOnce you‚Äôve selected the sports market(s) of your choosing, it‚Äôs time to lock in some action! With few restrictions discussed at any of the state‚Äôs hearings on sports betting thus far, players should end up with a full menu of bet types at their disposal.\n\nThe entire list of offerings will ultimately depend on the sportsbook provider you choose. However Missourians can expect to find any of the following bet types available on their app or website:\n\nStraight/Single\n\nMoneyline\n\nPoint Spread\n\nTotals (Over/Under)\n\nParlay\n\nTeaser\n\nPlayer Props\n\nFutures\n\nLive Betting\n\nBetting on college sports in Missouri\n\nRep. Shaul‚Äôs HB 2080 pushed to allow wagering on college sports. A series of nine proposals from a group backed by the Chiefs, Royals, Blues and other local sports teams aimed to prevent it. We‚Äôll see what the legislature eventually agrees upon.\n\nDivision I college football teams in Missouri\n\nIf the state ultimately decides to ban wagering on all college sports, or just wagering on college teams located in Missouri, a few local favorites could get left off the board. Luckily for college football fans, there aren‚Äôt a ton of Division I football teams in the state:\n\nMissouri Tigers (FBS)\n\nMissouri State Bears (FCS)\n\nSoutheast Missouri State Redhawks (FCS)\n\nDivision I college basketball teams in Missouri\n\nWhile Mizzou is the only major football program in the state, Missouri college basketball has a much stronger presence. The state is home to five DI basketball programs that play in an assortment of respectable conferences. They include:\n\nKansas City Roos (Summit)\n\nMissouri Tigers (SEC)\n\nMissouri State Bears (Missouri Valley)\n\nSaint Louis Billikens (Atlantic 10)\n\nSoutheast Missouri State Redhawks (Ohio Valley)\n\nProfessional Missouri sports teams\n\nOdds are subject to change.\n\nKansas Chiefs\n\nLeague: National Football League\n\nFounded: 1959\n\nStadium: Arrowhead Stadium\n\nLocation: Kansas City, MO\n\nPartners/Sponsors: TBD\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs were founded in 1959 as the Dallas Texans by AFL charter member Lamar Hunt. They wouldn‚Äôt get their current name until the team‚Äôs relocation in 1963. That was one year after Dallas won its first AFL Championship in 1962.\n\nThe franchise would go on to win its second AFL title in 1966 and another in 1969. It happened to be the final AFL Championship Game in history before the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. Following the team‚Äôs 1966 AFL title, the Chiefs lost to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl I. They beat the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 to win Super Bowl IV.\n\nThe franchise experienced a ton of success in the early 1990‚Äôs, reaching the playoffs in seven out of eight seasons under Marty Schottenheimer from 1990-97 ‚Äì including a few years led by quarterback Joe Montana.\n\nDespite this, Schottenheimer‚Äôs teams managed to make it past the Divisional Round just once, resulting in a 30-13 AFC Championship loss to the Buffalo Bills in 1994. This would mark the beginning of a dark era for the organization, resulting in zero playoff victories from 1994 until 2015.\n\nMahomes era\n\nEverything changed for KC when it drafted Patrick Mahomes out of Texas Tech in the 2017 NFL Draft.\n\nSince becoming the Chiefs‚Äô starting quarterback in 2018, Mahomes has led the Chiefs to the Super Bowl in 2020, 2021 and 2023, winning in ‚Äô20 and ‚Äô23.\n\nKansas City Royals\n\nLeague: Major League Baseball\n\nFounded: 1969\n\nStadium: Kauffman Stadium\n\nLocation: Kansas City, MO\n\nPartners/Sponsors: TBD\n\nThe Royals entered Major League Baseball as an expansion franchise in 1969, joining the Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Pilots. The organization spent its first three seasons playing its games at Municipal Stadium, former home of the Kansas City Athletics.\n\nAfter moving into its permanent home at Kauffman Stadium in 1973, the young franchise quickly made its presence felt by reaching three consecutive ALCS from 1976-78.\n\nThe Royals fell short in all three games but would return to the playoffs four more times over the next seven seasons, culminating in their first World Series title in 1985 over the in-state rival St. Louis Cardinals. The franchise struggled following the end of the George Brett era, notching just one winning season from 1995 until 2012.\n\nThe team spent a lot of this time building up its core from within, eventually resulting in homegrown talents such as Salvador Perez, Eric Hosmer, and Alex Gordon, among many others, leading the Royals to back to back World Series appearances in 2014 and 2015.\n\nAfter falling short the first time around to Madison Bumgarner and the San Francisco Giants, Kansas City avenged their defeat by securing the franchise‚Äôs second World Series title in 2015, a 4-1 series win over the New York Mets.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n\nLeague: Major League Baseball\n\nFounded: 1882\n\nStadium: Busch Stadium\n\nLocation: St. Louis, MO\n\nPartners/Sponsors: TBD\n\nOne of the oldest and most successful entities in Major League Baseball and professional sports in general, the St. Louis Cardinals organization dates to 1882 and owns 11 World Series titles, the second most in baseball history.\n\nThe franchise spent 18 seasons from 1882-99 known as the St. Louis Brown Stockings, Browns, and Perfectos before permanently becoming the Cardinals in 1900. The club is responsible for some of the most important moments in the sport‚Äôs history. They include Branch Rickey‚Äôs implementation of a farm system in the 1920s.\n\nIt resulted in four World Series titles during his run as manager/general manager from 1919-42. Although Rickey moved on to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1943, the Cardinals success didn‚Äôt stop there. The team would go on to win two more titles in 1944 and 1946 led by the bat of the great Stan Musial.\n\nThe organization would fail to qualify for the postseason in each of the next 17 seasons, officially ending their playoff drought with a World Series title in 1964.\n\nLed by Bob Gibson on the mound and Lou Brock on the base paths, St. Louis returned to the World Series in 1967, winning yet again with the same core before appearing in back-to-back championships and falling to the Detroit Tigers in 1968.\n\nFollowing another 13-year drought with no playoffs, St. Louis captured its ninth World Series title in 1982. They were led by Hall of Fame skipper Whitey Herzog and legendary shortstop Ozzie Smith.\n\n2006 breakthrough\n\nFollowing the Mark McGwire era that resulted in a legendary home run chase but little team success, it would take the historic franchise more than 20 years to secure its next championship. Manager Tony La Russa finally broke through in 2006 with his core consisting of Albert Pujols, Yadier Molina, and Adam Wainwright.\n\nIn 2011, lifted by the heroics of David Freese, the Cardinals beat the Texas Rangers to win their 11th World Series title, a National League record that still stands today and is unlikely to be broken anytime soon.\n\nSt. Louis Blues\n\nLeague: National Hockey League\n\nFounded: 1967\n\nStadium: Enterprise Center\n\nLocation: St. Louis, MO\n\nPartners/Sponsors: TBD\n\nThe Blues were founded in 1967 as an NHL expansion team. The franchise spent its first 27 seasons playing at St. Louis Arena before moving to the Enterprise Center in 1994.\n\nDespite owning the most postseason appearances in NHL history outside of the Original Six, St. Louis won its first Stanley Cup in 2019. That ended a 52-year title drought and 49-year gap since the organization‚Äôs previous championship appearance.\n\nWith the win, St. Louis became the final active member of the 1967 expansion to bring home a Stanley Cup.\n\nSporting Kansas City\n\nLeague: Major League Soccer\n\nFounded: 1995\n\nStadium: Children‚Äôs Mercy Park\n\nLocation: Kansas City, MO/Kansas City KS\n\nPartners/Sponsors: TBD\n\nFounded in 1995 by Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, Sporting Kansas City is one of Major League Soccer‚Äôs original 10 clubs. Known as the Kansas City Wizards from 1995-2010, the franchise was rebranded in November 2010. The reason was to go along with its new home, Children‚Äôs Mercy Park, which opened in 2011.\n\nSporting KC has two MLS Cup titles. The first was over the Chicago Fire in 2000 as the Wizards and the second in 2013 over Real Salt Lake.\n\nSt. Louis City Soccer Club\n\nLeague: Major League Soccer\n\nFounded: 2019\n\nStadium: Centene Stadium\n\nLocation: St. Louis, MO\n\nPartners/Sponsors: TBD\n\nSt. Louis City SC became the most successful expansion franchise in the history of North American sports by winning the Western Conference in its first year of existence.\n\nNo expansion team had ever done that in any American team sport."
