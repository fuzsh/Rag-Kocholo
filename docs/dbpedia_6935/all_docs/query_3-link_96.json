        "text": "TAMPA, Fla. -- Sid Solomon III, who with his father brought NHL hockey to St. Louis, died Sunday in Tampa after a bout with cancer, a family friend said. He was 51.\n\nSolomon was executive vice president of the St. Louis Blues. His father, Sid Solomon Jr., who died five years ago, had been the club's president and chairman.\n\nThe Solomons paid $2 million for the St. Louis expansion franchise, which was officially granted April 6, 1966, and played its first game Oct. 11, 1967.\n\nThe family later suffered financial difficulties and sold the franchise to Ralston Purina July 27, 1977.\n\nThe family friend, lawyer Jim Cullen, said Solomon's sons, Sid IV and Tim, were with him when he died Sunday at 5:15 a.m. at a Tampa hospital.\n\nHe had been ill for the last 11 months, suffering from cancer of the shoulder and chest. He first contracted the disease 20 years ago, but it had been in remission until last year.\n\nA native of St. Louis, Solomon moved to Florida 10 years ago and had lived in Stewart and Fort Pierce before moving to Tampa two years ago. He constructed and managed golf courses and condominiums and recreational facilties, and developed them with a group of partners.\n\nIn addition to the two sons, Solomon is survived by his wife, Carol, of Tampa; a daughter, Patti, his mother Jean Solomon and a sister, Suzie Solomon, all of St. Louis."
