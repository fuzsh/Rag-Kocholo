        "text": "Summer is finally upon us, and that means we finally get to stop listening to sad girl music and looking out at the rain (unless you‚Äôre based in the UK, that is). Now it‚Äôs time for lively, summery bangers. The kind that make you want to drink, be merry and dance the night away.\n\nLuckily, summer is a pretty big genre in the music world. And though we‚Äôve included this year‚Äôs bangers (Sabrina Carpenter, we‚Äôre looking at you), there‚Äôs got to be room for the very best golden oldies too. This list covers decades of summer jams. All you have to do is supply the drinks. Here‚Äôs our ultimate summer playlist for 2024. Enjoy!\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nüé§ The best karaoke songs\n\nüçª The best drinking songs\n\nüéâ The best party songs\n\nüé∂ The best ‚Äô80s songs\n\nüï∫ The best pop songs\n\n1. ‚ÄòHere Comes the Sun‚Äô by the Beatles\n\nWe know, this isn‚Äôt exactly the tune that makes you want to hit the day fests and sink vodka tonics. But it is sort of the ultimate summer banger to ever exist, if you think about it. When our cold, dark hearts get that first hit of sunshine, when we throw open the windows to see summer in bloom, that‚Äôs what this song feels like. Happy. Enchanting. Full of hope before the cold winter falls on us once again. Summer‚Äôs here, folks!\n\n2. ‚ÄòEspresso‚Äô by Sabrina Carpenter\n\nAmerican pop-star Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs latest single features neither poetic lyrics or groundbreaking instrumentals, but it doesn‚Äôt need to. ‚ÄòEspresso‚Äôs‚Äô snappy, sub-three minute length, almost nonsensical lines and easy, groovy sound are apparently the only ingredients you need for a sizzly, summery track. The fact you‚Äôre immediately lured in with the catchiness of the chorus makes it virtually impossible to skip, but why would you? Espresso is girly, cheeky, addictive and will inevitably be in 2024‚Äôs pop hall of fame. Sing it with us: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm working late, ‚Äòcause I‚Äôm a singerrrr‚Äô.\n\nAdvertising\n\n3. ‚ÄòEverybody Loves the Sunshine‚Äô by Roy Ayers\n\n‚ÄòMy life, my life, my life, my life / In the sunshine‚Äô ‚Äì summertime odes don‚Äôt come much simpler, sweeter or sexier than this 1976 slow jam by jazz vibraphonist turned soul sensation Roy Ayers. Even if you don‚Äôt think you know this classic tune, you've likely heard it sampled by Mary J. Blige, Common, P.M. Dawn and plenty of others.\n\n4. ‚ÄòHoudini‚Äô by Dua Lipa\n\nWe all know Dua as a disco queen but ‚ÄòHoudini‚Äôs‚Äô production (from Tame Impala‚Äôs Kevin Parker and Danny L Harl) certainly packs a little extra punch. Harder and fuller with its almost psychedelic synthesizers and straight-to-the-point lyrics, a fieriness to the song that makes it (literally) perfect for the summer. Listen to it now and picture yourself at a day fezzie, ditching some loser boy in the dance tent for your girlies at the main stage. Cheers to that huns.\n\nGeorgia Evans\n\nCommercial Editor, Time Out\n\nAdvertising\n\n5. ‚ÄòSummertime Sadness‚Äô by Lana Del Ray\n\nBrought to us by the queen of floaty white dresses, flower crowns and heart shaped sunglasses, Lana Del Rey is a harbinger of summer herself. And despite the sombre tone, 'Summertime Sadness' is a certified anthem for the warmer months. This is one for the rainy summer days (God knows we have enough of them), staring out the train window as you trace the droplets. Pure main character energy.\n\n6. ‚Äò(Sittin‚Äô on the) Dock of the Bay‚Äô by Otis Redding\n\nOkay, so this lazy-day masterpiece, recorded mere days before Redding‚Äôs death in a plane crash, doesn‚Äôt specifically single out that it takes place during summertime. But just try to listen to the lapping waves, Redding‚Äôs whistling and singing about clearing your mind, and that lovely sonic tranquility throughout without conjuring your most relaxing summer vacation.\n\nAdvertising\n\n7. ‚ÄòVon Dutch‚Äô by Charli XCX\n\nThe lines of ‚ÄòI'm just livin' that life / Von Dutch, cult classic but I still pop‚Äô are really all you need to feel like a fucking superstar this summer. Channel your inner brat and strut around London with this on full blast, canned vodka cranberry to hand, and embrace Charli‚Äôs supercharged electroclash dance production.\n\nGeorgia Evans\n\nCommercial Editor, Time Out\n\n8. ‚ÄòEverywhere‚Äô by Fleetwood Mac\n\nLet‚Äôs be real: there‚Äôs a hell of a lot of Fleetwood Mac songs that could appear on this list. Their songs reek of summer, only to be played once it‚Äôs light out past 9pm and the BBQ‚Äôs been resurrected from its grave. But ‚ÄòEverywhere‚Äô, in my opinion, is the ultimate summer tune, to be sung while dancing around with your pals in the garden after many wines. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs feel-good, and it truly never gets old.\n\nAdvertising\n\n9. ‚ÄòLovely Day‚Äô by Bill Withers\n\nSun, rain or hurricane, it doesn‚Äôt matter what the weather is doing, cue up this classic gem from revered soul man Bill Withers and you‚Äôll agree that it is indeed a lovely day. Fun fact: Near the end of the song, Withers holds a single note for 18 seconds, which is purportedly the longest note in a U.S. Top 40 single in history. We can only assume the tune‚Äôs inescapable buoyancy is what lifted him to such a feat.\n\n10. ‚ÄòSummertime‚Äô by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong\n\n‚ÄòSummertime‚Äô is a gorgeous lie. As written by George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward for the seminal 1935 American folk opera Porgy & Bess, it‚Äôs a lullaby sung by a poor young mother in the slums of South Carolina, assuring her child of a tranquil world that is nowhere around them. (Fish don‚Äôt jump on Catfish Row, and the living sure as hell isn‚Äôt easy.) Originally sung in a classical soprano range, ‚ÄòSummertime‚Äô has been reinvented in many modes, including Janis Joplin‚Äôs achingly desperate 1968 account. But it‚Äôs hard to beat the warm, soothing version that Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong recorded for their 1957 Porgy & Bess album. Curled in the warm voices of these peerless vocalists, you‚Äôre transported to a gentler place, with the Daddy and Mammy of jazz standing by.\n\nAdvertising\n\n11. ‚ÄòBaian√°‚Äô by Nia Archives\n\nNow this is a proper summertime banger. ‚ÄòBaian√°‚Äô is a brilliant assault on the eardrums, blending 90s jungle and breakbeat with Brazilian flavour. It‚Äôs an affirmation not only of Nia Archives as a proper party starter but a crate-digging musical mastermind who is primed to take over dance stages at your favourite festivals.\n\nGeorgia Evans\n\nCommercial Editor, Time Out\n\n12. ‚ÄòGood Vibrations‚Äô by the Beach Boys\n\nTeeming with key shifts, complex harmonies and unorthodox instrumentation (it features a cello, a jaw harp and an electrotheremin), this Beach Boys classic was a feat of both composition and production. It took seven months, four different recording studios and over $50,000 to create this sunny masterpiece.\n\nAdvertising\n\n13. ‚ÄòWalking on Sunshine‚Äô by Katrina and the Waves\n\nJust try not to bop your body when the brass kicks in at the ten-second mark of this jolt of pure pop joy. Katrina and the Waves‚Äô 1985 radio hit isn‚Äôt literally about summer at all; it‚Äôs about the excitement of awaiting a visit from someone you love (and the thrill of knowing that he or she loves you in the first place). But the song‚Äôs irresistible feel-good energy suggests that summer is less a season than a state of mind that can be tapped into anytime ‚Äì even, in the original music video, on a cold and cloudy day.\n\n14. ‚ÄòSchool‚Äôs Out for Summer‚Äô by Alice Cooper\n\nThese days, shock-rock godfather Alice Cooper‚Äôs idea of summertime fun is hitting the links at some tony country club. But back in 1972, Cooper and his rough-and-tumble band perfectly captured the rowdy spirit of the last day of school ‚Äì which Cooper rated as second only to Christmas as the most important day on the calendar.\n\nAdvertising\n\n15. ‚ÄòSummer Breeze‚Äô by Seals and Crofts\n\nNothing says summer like a little harmony-driven folk-pop, and this 1972 AM Gold staple epitomizes that mini movement about as well as any track we could name. We‚Äôre not sure what Jim Seals and Dash Crofts were getting at when they sang of the\n\n‚Äòjasmine in my mind‚Äô ‚Äì or what strain of weed might‚Äôve inspired that trippy turn of phrase ‚Äì but there‚Äôs no resisting the bittersweet tug of this tune, covered by everyone from Cincinnati soul faves the Isley Brothers to '90s goth-metal masters Type O Negative.\n\n16. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Summer‚Äô by Gladys Knight & the Pips\n\n‚ÄòI can just feel that soft summer breeze,‚Äô sings the aptly nicknamed Empress of Soul in this cut about finally ‚Äì finally ‚Äìwelcoming the warm weather, as strings swirl against a syruppy groove and, of course, the Pips doing their thing.\n\nAdvertising\n\n17. ‚ÄòDancing in the Street‚Äô by Martha and the Vandellas\n\nMartha and the Vandellas appear elsewhere on this with their 1963 Motown breakthrough, ‚ÄòHeat Wave.‚Äô But their even more enduring contribution to the estival catalog is 1964‚Äôs ‚ÄòDancing in the Street,‚Äô an exuberant call to booty-shaking action cowritten by a young Marvin Gaye (who also played drums on the recording). In this case, it‚Äôs not love that brings a sense of summer, but summer that brings a sense of love: an occasion for people ‚Äòacross the nation‚Äô and ‚Äòaround the world‚Äô to join in celebration. This democratic attitude took on civil-rights overtones when ‚ÄòDancing in the Street‚Äô was appropriated as an unofficial anthem of the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles. But Martha Reeves insisted that it was not intended in that spirit. ‚ÄòMy Lord, it was a party song,‚Äô she said, and whatever else it might have become, no one can argue with that.\n\n18. ‚ÄòHot Fun in the Summertime‚Äô by Sly and the Family Stone\n\nReleased in August 1969, ‚ÄòHot Fun in the Summertime‚Äô by funk trailblazers Sly and the Family Stone dropped at the height of the band‚Äôs career, after its legendary performance at Woodstock earlier that summer. It even landed the group the No. 2 spot on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, as well as No. 3 on the Billboard soul charts in the autumn of 1969. And how could it not? The song‚Äôs happy-go-lucky melody, coupled with frontman Sly Stone‚Äôs soulful tone, makes for a tune that perfectly encapsulates the mood of every summertime to come in a just a two-and-a-half-minute time span.\n\nAdvertising\n\n19. ‚ÄòHot in Herre‚Äô by Nelly\n\nFor summer ‚Äô02 pretty much the entire planet was Nellyville, and the St. Louis rapper exhorted people of all genders (but mostly women) to strip down for their own good. A typical first response would be apprehension ‚Äì from the man with the Band-aid on his face? But logically speaking, his argument follows (if heat, then no clothes), and he was smart enough to tap the Neptunes for the song's frisky production. After enough listens, it's impossible not to agree, whether your ‚Äòherre‚Äô is a sweaty club, a hot summer night or, the argument could be made, anywhere on our globally warming earth. Hot, it certainly is.\n\n20. ‚ÄòSunny Afternoon‚Äô by the Kinks\n\nThis is 1966 anthem is probably the only tune on the list that doubles as a tongue-in-cheek protest against high progressive taxation: ‚ÄòThe taxman‚Äôs taken all my dough, and left me in my stately home,‚Äô sighs Ray Davies's bon vivant narrator, adding, ‚ÄòAnd I can‚Äôt sail my yacht, he‚Äôs taken everything I‚Äôve got.‚Äô Wry and funny, ‚ÄòSunny Afternoon‚Äô is also one hell of a summer tune. From its languid melodies to Davies‚Äôs hypnotic vocals, we might as well all be ‚Äòlazin‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì or ‚Äòblazin‚Äô‚Äô depending on how you hear it‚Äì ‚Äòon a sunny afternoon in the summertime.‚Äô\n\nAdvertising\n\n21. ‚ÄòWater Get No Enemy‚Äô by Fela Kuti\n\nPretty much any selection from the oeuvre of the revered godfather of afrobeat would suffice for setting a funky, chilled-out vibe at an afternoon shindig, but this cut from Kuti's lauded 12th studio album, Expensive Shit, is probably his best known. Clocking in at eleven minutes, a full five and a half minutes pass before Kuti even sings a note. By the time he does, there‚Äôs no escaping the groove.\n\n22. ‚ÄòSummertime‚Äô by DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince\n\nBefore rushing the stage at the Oscars and proving himself the ultimate Wife Guy, Will Smith just wanted to kick it in the park in a Speed Racer shirt with half the population of Philadelphia around him and reminisce about chasing girls, driving slow and eating barbecue at the family reunion. Maybe the only Big Willie hit that‚Äôs persisted as an unironic classic, ‚ÄòSummertime‚Äô literally sounds like summer in the city, the chill-as-hell beat - sampled from Kool and the Gang‚Äôs ‚ÄòSummer Madness‚Äô - radiating like heat off a sidewalk.\n\nAdvertising\n\n23. ‚ÄòCruel Summer‚Äô by Taylor Swift\n\nWith an unlikely assist by indie glam-pop shapeshifter St. Vincent, Swift‚Äôs standout Lover track is slice of blissed out agit-pop lucidity. Producer Jack Antonoff seemingly channels French electronic hero Kavinsky, of all people, and adds a dose of sugary sweetness to the pulsing beat, allowing Taylor‚Äôs increasingly manic delivery to spill over into a controlled tailspin of frustration across the boardwalk without ever losing control. You can practically hear Olivia Rodrigo taking notes in the background.\n\n24. ‚ÄòSun is Shining‚Äô by Bob Marley and the Wailers\n\nThis track might open with the reggae icon singing, ‚ÄòSun is shining, the weather is sweet / Make you want to move your dancing feet,‚Äô but it‚Äôs more likely to inspire you to lay outside with a frosty beverage in hand than get down. Mellow even by Marley & Co.‚Äôs standards, it's a perfect soundtrack choice for a chilled-out afternoon.\n\nAdvertising\n\n25. ‚ÄòThat Summer Feelin‚Äô‚Äô by Jonathan Richman\n\nNo one does wistful nostalgia and pure, unadulterated joy quite like Jonathan Richman, the reformed punk godfather turned wide-eyed purveyor of childlike wonder. Still, there‚Äôs a knowing edge to Richman‚Äôs recollections: ‚ÄòThat summer feeling‚Äôs gonna haunt you the rest of your life.‚Äô\n\n26. ‚ÄòIt Was a Good Day‚Äô by Ice Cube\n\nA few years ago, internet sleuths deduced that the specific ‚Äògood day‚Äô described in this gangsta rap classic was actually a random Monday in January. But hey, in Southern California, pretty much every day is summer, especially when you‚Äôre Ice Cube. Over a slow-stepping Isley Brothers sample, the usually scowling ex-NWAer details an exceptionally blessed 24 hours, one with no ham, no pigs, a romp with a high school crush and a Fatburger nightcap.\n\nAdvertising\n\n27. ‚ÄòWatermelon Sugar‚Äô by Harry Styles\n\n‚ÄòTastes like strawberries on a summer evening,‚Äô Harry Styles croons seductively on this low-key funk banger about his love for delicious, vitamin-enriched fruits in the sun. Wait‚Ä¶ this is about sex, isn't it?\n\n28. ‚ÄòSummer in the City‚Äô by the Lovin‚Äô Spoonful\n\nThe Lovin‚Äô Spoonful begins its brilliant rock portrait of urban mood swings in a prelude of pent-up anticipation. Three quick pullbacks on the musical slingshot, each followed by a bang of drums like a backfiring car ‚Äì and then it‚Äôs straight into the fast lane, with hard-driving verses that barely come up for air. In tautly evocative language, the song limns a Jekyll & Hyde portrait of a city split into sweltering days (‚ÄòAll around, people looking half dead / Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head‚Äô) and cool, exhilarating nights of randy tomcats on the prowl. Real street sounds (car horns, a jackhammer) add texture to the midsong musical interlude, which lets the song catch its breath before launching back to its urgent rhythms.\n\nAdvertising\n\n29. ‚ÄòRock the Boat‚Äô by Aaliyah\n\nOk, this one if very certainly not about the joys of mariner life. Aaliyah‚Äôs horned-up slow jam makes Harry Styles sound like a master of subtlety, and the R&B groove makes this the perfect dockside summer jam. Or, more accurately, a great song for when you go below the deck.\n\n30. ‚ÄòSaturday in the Park‚Äô by Chicago\n\nAccording to fellow Chicago founding member Walter Parazaider, Robert Lamm penned this 1972 single after a particularly inspiring jaunt through Central Park, while the band was in NYC recording their fifth studio effort, Chicago V. The song remains one of the outfit‚Äôs signature tunes and, as you maybe could have guessed, the perfect soundtrack for a sunny afternoon in the park.\n\nAdvertising\n\n31. ‚ÄòCalifornia Gurls‚Äô by Katy Perry\n\nYou can‚Äôt help but jam out to the absurdly cheery, bubblegum-smacking melody and catchy lyrics in this global megahit (featuring Snoop Dogg, no less). Perfect for driving down the highway with your windows down, ‚ÄòCalifornia Gurls‚Äô is a summer tune for the ages, even if you are a die-hard, true-blue New Yorker. (It's a retort track to Jay-Z‚Äôs and Alicia Keys‚Äô NYC anthem ‚ÄòEmpire State of Mind.‚Äô)\n\n32. ‚ÄòHeat Wave‚Äô by Snail Mail\n\n‚ÄòHeat wave, nothing to do / Woke up in my clothes having dreamt of you,‚Äô sings Lindsey Jordan mournfully, before she and the rest of the band kick things up a notch to achieve an enjoyable, '90s-indie vibe.\n\nAdvertising\n\n33. ‚ÄòHot Girl Summer‚Äô by Megan Thee Stallion featuring Nicki Minaj & Ty Dolla $ign\n\nWhen two of hip-hop's reigning queens declare it to be ‚ÄòHot Girl Summer,‚Äô then dammit it's hot girl summer... every single time the song comes on, from here to eternity, whether it‚Äôs summer or not. The song is well on its way to enjoying the same perrennial status as Will Smith‚Äôs ‚ÄòSummertime,‚Äô only this time things are about as far away from Smith's G-rated beach bumming as you can get... unless that G has a string attached.\n\n34. ‚ÄòCruel Summer‚Äô by Bananarama\n\nTo any fan of The Karate Kid ‚Äì in which this icily funky 1983 dance-pop hit soundtracked Daniel LaRusso‚Äôs disastrous attempt to fit in at his new high school ‚Äì ‚ÄòCruel Summer‚Äô will forever symbolize those sweltering dog days when the sun‚Äôs beating down and you just can‚Äôt catch a break. To everyone else, it‚Äôs a ready-made anthem for whatever warm-weather blues might have you bumming.\n\nAdvertising\n\n35. ‚ÄòSummer Madness‚Äô by Kool & the Gang\n\nMadness isn‚Äôt exactly the emotional state that this gorgeous, easygoing 1974 instrumental track evokes; instead, it‚Äôs the perfect soundtrack for a sultry afternoon spent lazing in the park. Its swooning synth, shimmering Rhodes piano and hazy-day melody have been sampled countless times ‚Äì notably for DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince‚Äôs ode to backyard barbecuing, ‚ÄòSummertime‚Äô ‚Äì but more than that, the track has served as inspiration for pretty much every chill-out act worth its downtempo groove, from Air to Zero 7.\n\n36. ‚ÄòSummer Rain‚Äô by Johnny Rivers\n\n‚ÄòAll summer long, we spent dancin‚Äô in the sand,‚Äô sings rock & roller Johnny Rivers on this urgent, romantic 1967 hit, ‚Äòand the jukebox kept on playin‚Äô Sgt. Pepper‚Äôs Lonely Hearts Club Band.‚Äô While your teenage, sandy embraces may have been soundtracked by something far more modern, it‚Äôs a blissful head trip to imagine yourself in the middle of this song.\n\nAdvertising\n\n37. ‚ÄòBe Thankful for What You Got‚Äô by William DeVaughn\n\nThere‚Äôs no escaping the smooth allure of this tune‚Äôs signature line, ‚ÄòDiamond in the back, sunroof top/ Diggin‚Äô the scene with a gangster lean.‚Äô Ludacris, N.W.A., Ice Cube, Parliament-Funkadelic, Massive Attack and Rihanna have all referenced the 1974 hit by the little-known Washington D.C. singer-songwriter, who may as well have been singing to New Yorkers when he said, ‚ÄòYou may not have a car at all‚Ä¶ Just be thankful for what you‚Äôve got.‚Äô Come summertime, that‚Äôs plenty.\n\n38. ‚ÄòAsk‚Äô by the Smiths\n\n‚ÄòSpending warm summer days indoors‚Ä¶‚Äô Oh, you know the type ‚Äì maybe you‚Äôve been the type ‚Äì the kind of melancholically minded, poetic youth who simply can‚Äôt risk your delicate complexion or even more delicate disposition in the dazzle of sunshine and the risk of actual fun. Morrissey ‚Äì the scrooge of summer ‚Äì we salute you for this 1986 Smiths classic, urging shy types to come on out of their shells: ‚ÄòIf there‚Äôs something you‚Äôd like to try, ask me, I won‚Äôt say no, how could I.‚Äô It is summer, after all.\n\nAdvertising\n\n39. ‚ÄòIn the Sun‚Äô by Blondie\n\nTurns out the Ramones weren‚Äôt the only New Yorkers who yearned to hit the beach.‚Ä¶ This deep cut from Blondie's debut LP conjures rolling waves and warm nights effortlessly, thanks in part to twangy surf guitars and Clem Burke‚Äôs rumbling drums.\n\n40. ‚ÄòI Know Where the Summer Goes‚Äô by Belle and Sebastian\n\nYes, summer is fun, but good gosh can it be melancholy, too. Beloved Scottish indie troupe Belle and Sebastian won over legions of sensitive fans with this swoonsome number from 1998 EP This Is Just a Modern Rock Song. As if its odd little Proustian sensory rushes weren‚Äôt enough (‚Äòthe smell of hot desk‚Äô), just get two minutes into the song, when angelically voiced Stuart Murdoch sings a line where ‚Äòflowering cherries rain on kids like you‚Äô ‚Äì and all the music stops for just long enough to stall your heart."
