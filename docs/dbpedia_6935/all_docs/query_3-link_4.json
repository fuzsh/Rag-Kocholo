        "text": "Recap\n\nThe franchise was founded in 1967 as one of the six teams from the 1967 NHL expansion and is named after the W. C. Handy song \"Saint Louis Blues\". They play their home games at the 19,150-seat Enterprise Center in downtown St. Louis, which has been their arena since moving from St. Louis Arena in 1994.\n\nThe Blues were one of the six teams added to the NHL in the 1967 expansion, along with the Minnesota North Stars, Los Angeles Kings, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and California Seals. St. Louis was the last of the six expansion teams to gain entry into the League; the market was chosen over Baltimore at the insistence of the Chicago Black Hawks. The Black Hawks' owners, James D. Norris and Arthur Wirtz, also owned the decrepit St. Louis Arena. They sought to unload the arena, which had not been well-maintained since the 1940s, and thus pressed the NHL to give the franchise to St. Louis, which had not submitted a formal expansion bid. The Black Hawks owners felt they could establish a \"lovable loser\" (much like the Cubs) with the St. Louis Hockey Team. NHL president Clarence Campbell said during the 1967 expansion meetings, \"We want a team in St. Louis because of the city's geographical location and the fact that it has an adequate building.\""
