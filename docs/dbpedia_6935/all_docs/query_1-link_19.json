The Ducks only other trip to the Final came in 2006-07, where they defeated the Ottawa Senators in five games.\n\nArizona Coyotes/Winnipeg Jets\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1979-80First Stanley Cup Final: Never\n\nEither as the original Winnipeg Jets or the Arizona Coyotes, this franchise has never played in the Stanley Cup Final. The closest it has ever come was 2011-12, when the Coyotes won the Pacific Division and lost to the Los Angeles Kings in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nBoston Bruins\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1924-25First Stanley Cup Final: 1926-27\n\nThe NHL's first American franchise, the Boston Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Final in their third season and fell to the original Ottawa Senators. Two years later, 1928-29, the Bruins made it back to the Stanley Cup Final and beat another expansion team, the New York Rangers.\n\nBuffalo Sabres\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1970-71First Stanley Cup Final: 1974-75\n\nIn just their fifth NHL season, the high-flying Buffalo Sabres reached the Stanley Cup Final for the first time and lost to the Philadelphia Flyers in six games. Buffalo also lost its only other Stanley Cup Final appearance in 1998-99 to the Dallas Stars.\n\nCalgary Flames\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1972-73First Stanley Cup Final: 1985-86\n\nAlthough they entered the NHL in 1972 as the Atlanta Flames, the Flames didn't reach the Stanley Cup Final until after they moved to Calgary.

After losing in five to the Detroit Red Wings, the Hurricanes returned to the Stanley Cup Final in 2005-06 and defeated the Edmonton Oilers for the only championship in team history.\n\nChicago Blackhawks\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1926-27First Stanley Cup Final: 1930-31\n\nLed by eccentric owner Major Frederic McClaughlin, the Blackhawks were not a stable franchise in their early seasons, frequently changing coaches and icing \"unique\" lineups, which were mostly predicated by their owner's desire to dress American players at a time U.S. NHL players were rare. Despite several moving parts, Chicago reached the Stanley Cup Final in its fifth season, 1930-31, but lost to the Montreal Canadiens. The Blackhawks made it back to the final in 1934, winning the first of the team's six Stanley Cups.\n\nColorado Avalanche\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1979-80First Stanley Cup Final: 1995-96\n\nThe Avalanche never advanced beyond the conference final during their 16-year run as the Quebec Nordiques, but won the Stanley Cup in their first season in Denver, 1995-96.\n\nWatch: Youtube Video\n\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n\nFirst NHL Season: 2000-01First Stanley Cup Final: Never\n\nThe Blue Jackets have gradually become a potent force in the NHL, and have now made a handful of playoff appearances. Columbus, however, is yet to advance out of the first round.\n\nDallas Stars\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1967-68First Stanley Cup Final: 1980-81\n\nAs the Minnesota North Stars, today's Dallas Stars reached the Stanley Cup Final in both 1980-81 and 1990-91, but lost to the New York Islanders and Pittsburgh Penguins, respectively. Their first trip to the Final after moving to Dallas in 1993 came in 1998-99, when they beat the Buffalo Sabres for the only championship in team history.\n\nDetroit Red Wings\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1926-27First Stanley Cup Final: 1933-34\n\nPlaying their early seasons as both the Detroit Falcons and Detroit Cougars, today's Red Wings, as the Red Wings, reached their first Stanley Cup Final in their eight season, 1933-34, and lost to the Chicago Black Hawks, whose name was spelled in two words at the time. . Detroit won its first two Stanley Cups, back to back, in 1936 and '37.\n\nEdmonton Oilers\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1979-80First Stanley Cup Final: 1982-83\n\nWhile the other teams - Quebec Nordiques, Hartford Whalers, Winnipeg Jets - that joined the NHL from the World Hockey Association in 1979 struggled early, the Edmonton Oilers didn't, largely aided by a teenage Wayne Gretzky. Quickly adding several other future Hall of Famers - Mark Messier, Jari Kurri, Paul Coffey, et al - the Oilers reached the Stanley Cup Final in their fourth season and were swept by the New York Islanders. The following spring, the Oilers started a run where they won five Stanley Cups in seven seasons.\n\nRELATED: McPhee fielding calls for Expansion Draft-related transactions\n\nFlorida Panthers\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1993-94First Stanley Cup Final: 1995-96\n\nOf all the 1990s NHL expansion teams, none reached the Stanley Cup Final quicker than the Florida Panthers, who were swept by the Colorado Avalanche in their third NHL season. Although that was the Avalanche's first season, it must be noted that Colorado's true expansion year came in 1979-80 as the Quebec Nordiques.\n\nLos Angeles Kings\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1967-68First Stanley Cup Final: 1992-93\n\nBefore winning two Stanley Cups in three seasons starting in 2011-12, the Kings had only made it to the Stanley Cup Final one time in the team's 45-year history. That came in 1992-93, where despite three contests reaching overtime, Los Angeles lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games.\n\nMinnesota Wild\n\nFirst Season: 2000-01First Stanley Cup Final: Never\n\nThe Wild have yet to reach the Stanley Cup Final since entering the NHL in 2000-01, but reached the Western Conference in their third season, 2002-03, before losing to the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.\n\nMontreal Canadiens\n\nFirst Season: 1909-10First Stanley Cup Final: 1915-16\n\nFounded seven years before the NHL was founded as a member of the National Hockey Association, the Montreal Canadiens reached their first Stanley Cup Final in 1915-16 and defeated the Portland Rosebuds, who were largely the forerunner of today's Chicago Blackhawks.

That decade started a near two-decade run of success for the Devils, who reached the Stanley Cup Final for the first time in 1994-95 and swept the Detroit Red Wings to win the first championship in team history.\n\nNew York Islanders\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1972-73First Stanley Cup Final: 1979-80\n\nBy their third year, the Islanders were Stanley Cup contenders, although a string of late playoff defeats in the late '70s kept them out of the Stanley Cup Final until 1979-80. That year, they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in six games, winning the first of four straight Stanley Cups.\n\nWatch: Youtube Video\n\nNew York Rangers\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1926-27First Stanley Cup Final: 1927-28\n\nAlthough 1967, when the NHL doubled in size from six teams to 12, is recognized as the NHL's first expansion, there was previously expansion in 1926.

In its second season, New York reached the Stanley Cup Final for the first time and defeated the Montreal Maroons.\n\nOttawa Senators\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1992-93First Stanley Cup Final: 2006-07\n\nAlthough an earlier team called the Ottawa Senators existed in the early 20th century and won several championships, the modern franchise was founded in 1992.

By the early 1990s, the Penguins had added Jaromir Jagr and Ron Francis, among others, to the fold. Pittsburgh beat the Minnesota North Stars in its first trip to the Stanley Cup Final in 1990-91, and then the Chicago Blackhawks the following spring to win its second straight championship.\n\nWatch: Youtube Video\n\nSan Jose Sharks\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1991-92First Stanley Cup Final: 2015-16\n\nDespite several strong teams and first places finishes, the San Jose Sharks didn't reach the Stanley Cup Final until the franchise was 25 years old. San Jose lost its only Cup Final to the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games last spring.\n\nSt. Louis Blues\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1967-68First Stanley Cup Final: 1967-68\n\nAlthough it deserves a slight asterisk, the Blues reached the Stanley Cup Final in each of their first three seasons. The asterisk being that when the NHL expanded from six teams to 12 in 1967, the format guaranteed that one of the six new franchises would reach the Final. The Blues were the expansion representative in the Final in all three seasons under this arrangement, and were swept all three years. St. Louis hasn't made it back to the Stanley Cup Final since.\n\nTampa Bay Lightning\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1992-93First Stanley Cup Final: 2003-04\n\nAfter badly struggling throughout most of their early seasons, the Lightning acquired talents such as Martin St. Louis, Vincent Lecavalier and Brad Richards in the early 2000s.

They first appeared in the Stanley Cup Final as the Maple Leafs in 1931-32 and defeated the New York Rangers.\n\nVancouver Canucks\n\nFirst NHL Season: 1970-71First Stanley Cup Final: 1981-82\n\nEleven years after entering the NHL, the Canucks made a Cinderella run to the Stanley Cup Final in 1981-82 and were swept by the New York Islanders.
