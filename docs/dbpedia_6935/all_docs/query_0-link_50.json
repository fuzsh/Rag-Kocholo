This beautiful durene Home (blue) Blues jersey features the striking bluenote logo on the chest with Crisp’s #19 sewn onto the sleeves and back in tri-color lettering with the blue being formed by a tight zig-zag stitch on the sleeve numbers and all tackle twill on the back. Rawlings size 44 and washing instructions tags are inside the back left hem. Two repairs on the left sleeve along with heavy red paint transfers. Several stick marks on the right sleeve #9 and two repairs on the left chest. Pilling inside both sleeves and inside the back."
