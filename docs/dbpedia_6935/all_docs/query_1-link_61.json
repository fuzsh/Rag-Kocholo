On May 29, following a brief retreat after the attack on Fort Randolph in Point Pleasant, Mason County, Native American warriors attacked Fort Donnally in present Greenbrier County. Militiamen John Pryor and Philip Hammond, disguised as Native Americans, traveled from Fort Randolph to Fort Donnally, notifying residents of the impending attack. At one point, Hammond and Dick Pointer, one of Colonel Donnally's slaves, allegedly held off the attackers by themselves. Troops from Camp Union commanded by Matthew Arbuckle and Samuel Lewis ended the attack the following day. In 1795, the Virginia General Assembly freed Pointer from slavery in appreciation for his actions. Source: Rice, West Virginia: A History, 41.\n\n1832. On January 20, Charles Faulkner of Berkeley County delivered a speech before the Virginia General Assembly in which he denounced slavery on economic grounds. William Lloyd Garrison began publishing the speech annually in his abolitionist newspaper Liberator, as an example of anti-slavery sentiment in the South.

Source: Rice, West Virginia: A History, 104.\n\n1859. On October 16, John Brown and his followers seized the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Jefferson County. Their goal was to ignite a slave rebellion and establish a colony for runaway slaves in Maryland. The raid was a disaster for Brown. He and his men were trapped in a small engine house and local slaves did not revolt as expected. Ironically, the first casualty of the raid was a free black baggage handler, Heyward Shepherd, who was shot when he confronted the raiders. Brown was hanged for treason in Charles Town on December 2, after declaring slavery would not be abolished without great bloodshed. Source: Bushong, Historic Jefferson County, 179-189.\n\n1862. On January 27, Ohio County minister and convention delegate Gordon Battelle proposed that the new state constitution provide for the gradual abolition of slavery rather than the immediate abolition he had proposed on 2 December 1861. This version of the proposal became the basis of the Willey Amendment. Source: Rice, West Virginia: A History, 145.\n\n1862. On July 14, the West Virginia Statehood bill was passed by the Senate, changing the slavery provision of the West Virginia Constitution to allow for the gradual emancipation of slavery. After Senator Charles Sumner had demanded that immediate emancipation be included in the final bill, Waitman Willey proposed the compromise for gradual emancipation, which passed. John Carlile, after attempting to block or delay passage of the bill, voted against it, due to the inclusion of the Willey Amendment (although Carlile was a slave owner himself, his statehood bill also provided for slave emancipation). Senator Benjamin Wade noted that Carlile's \"conversion\" was \"greater than that of St. Paul.\" Source: Rice, West Virginia: A History, 147-148.\n\n1863. On January 1, President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation freed all slaves in areas of rebellion, but did not apply to states loyal to the Union, including the future state of West Virginia.\n\n1863. On July 15, the governor approved an act giving African Americans the same rights to criminal trial as whites. However, blacks were denied the right to serve on a jury.

Storer was the first African- American college in West Virginia. The institution had been established by the Free Will Baptist church as a school for runaway slaves during the Civil War. In 1867, Storer was incorporated by the state as a school for African Americans under the leadership of the Rev. Nathan C. Brackett. Storer trained many prominent black educators and lawyers during its nearly ninety-year history. Source: Bushong, Historic Jefferson County, 267.\n\n1869. On March 23, the West Virginia State Senate ratified the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by a vote of 10 to 6, with 6 either absent or abstaining. The Fifteenth Amendment granted African Americans the right to vote. The previous day, the House of Delegates ratified the amendment by a vote of 22 to 19. The approval of the amendment caused many conservative Republicans to ally with the Democrats, leading to approval of the Flick Amendment, which enfranchised former Confederates. Source: Sheeler, \"The Negro in West Virginia Before 1900,\" 192-193.\n\n1872. On May 20, an Ohio County circuit court indicted Taylor Strauder, a Wheeling carpenter, for murdering his wife. During the court's July term, Strauder was convicted and sentenced to be hanged. This case was eventually tried in the United States Supreme Court, in which it was ruled unconstitutional to try an African American in a court system which forbade eligible African Americans from serving on juries as was the case in West Virginia. Source: Sheeler, \"The Negro in West Virginia Before 1900,\" 204.\n\n1873.

On June 11, Charleston Mayor Snyder and the city council appointed Ernest Porterfield as a police officer, the first African American to receive a public job in Kanawha County and possibly West Virginia. Within one hour, the remainder of the white police force, including Chief Rand, resigned. Rather than ask for Porterfield's resignation, Snyder hired a new force.

Washington of Malden, Kanawha County, began a lecture tour of the state, encouraging African Americans to vote for Charleston as the permanent state capital. Since West Virginia's creation, the state capital had alternated between Charleston and Wheeling. In August 1877, voters selected Charleston as the permanent state capital over Clarksburg or Martinsburg.\n\n1881. On February 3, the governor approved a bill, allowing all eligible voting citizens, including African Americans, to be jurors. In their October 1879 Taylor Strauder decision, the U.S. Supreme Court had found the West Virginia law forbidding African Americans from serving on juries to be unconstitutional.

On September 13, discontented with the Republican, Democratic, Union Labor, and Prohibition parties, 49 African-American delegates convened in Charleston and nominated their own election ticket, consisting of the following: W. H. Davis of Kanawha County for governor; E. A. Turner of Brooke County for auditor; Alfred Whiting of Hampshire County for treasurer; T. M. Thurston of Hampshire County, Edward Turner of Brooke County, Albert Alexander of Hampshire County, John A. Jefferson of Kanawha County, and John Jordan of Mason County as presidential electors. An Executive State Committee was formed, consisting of the following: H. C. Hawkins, W. S. Peen, John Rose of Mason County, Albert Alexander, W. A. Hunter of Barbour County, E. A. Turner, Peyton Murry of Kanawha County, Aaron Jordan of Pocahontas County, and Alex Davis of Upshur County. This was the first major election in the state in which African Americans became a significant voting force. After the election, Democrats accused Republicans of bringing in African Americans from Virginia to vote illegally for Nathan Goff. Accusations pointed to voting irregularities in Mercer County, McDowell County, Wyoming County, Fayette County, and Raleigh County. These and other accusations of fraud caused a dispute over the election results. Democrat A. B. Fleming was finally determined to be the winner in 1890, over a year after the election.

On March 4, the West Virginia Legislature passed an act establishing the West Virginia Colored Institute at Institute in Kanawha County. The West Virginia Colored Institute, later renamed West Virginia State College, became one of the leading black institutions of public learning in the nation. It was created following the state's rejection of a proposal to take over Storer College in Harpers Ferry, Jefferson County. The act was approved by the governor on March 17.

On November 16, the trial of Williams v. Board of Education of Tucker County began. Carrie Williams was a black teacher in the segregated school system of Tucker County. The board of education tried to save money by cutting African-American school term from eight to five months. Williams taught for the entire eight-month term and sued the board for the extra three-months' pay. Williams' lawyer J. R. Clifford argued that African-American schools should receive the same funding and have the same rights as white schools. Williams' court victory was the first in the nation to determine discrimination on the basis of color to be illegal. Source: Trotter, Honoring Our Past, 184-186.\n\n1900.

On March 30, the New-Kanawha Power Company broke ground on the Hawks Nest Tunnel and Dam, part of the New River power project, with an estimated 800 men employed. Over the next five years, at least 476 workers, mostly migrant African Americans from the South, died from silicosis, a disease caused by inhaling silica rock particles. The deaths were attributed to inadequate safety practices by the contractors, Rinehart and Dennis, who were employed by the Union Carbide Corporation. Some of the dead were buried in a mass grave to hide the actual number of casualties. Fifty years later, one study placed the death toll as high as 764, making it the worst industrial disaster in United States history.

On May 17, the United States Supreme Court handed down its Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas decision prohibiting segregation of schools based on race. Future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall represented Brown, while the boards of education of several southern states were represented by Clarksburg native John William Davis. The decision prompted the gradual desegregation of West Virginia's public schools and colleges. West Virginia State College quickly integrated whites into its program; Bluefield State College integrated more slowly. The state withdrew funding for Storer College, which closed within a matter of years. The Brown decision also resulted in the integration of public institutions and the discontinuance of agencies such as the Negro Bureau of Welfare and Statistics. Source: Johnson, \"Integration in West Virginia Since 1954,\" vi.\n\n1954. On June 1, State School Superintendent W. W. Trent sent letters to all county public school superintendents, suggesting proper methods of school integration:\n\nAs segregation is unconstitutional, boards of education, in my opinion, should begin immediately to reorganize and re-adjust their schools to comply with the Supreme Court's decision. In some instances where there are but few Negro pupils, and where all buildings at this time are accommodating a maximum number of pupils, and in some instances a number too large for convenient accommodation considerable time may be required before segregation is entirely eliminated.\n\nSource: Johnson, \"Integration in West Virginia Since 1954,\" 7.\n\n1954. On September 14, West Virginia NAACP Charleston Branch president Willard A. Brown spoke to African Americans at the White Sulphur Springs Baptist Church, concerning the decision of the Greenbrier County Board of Education to maintain segregated schools. During the meeting, white protestors shut off the lights and fired guns outside the church. A U.S. Supreme Court decision the following month placed more pressure on school systems which resisted desegregation. Consequently, all counties in West Virginia, including Greenbrier, began integrating schools by January 1956. However, White Sulphur Springs students voted to hold their prom in December instead of May to prevent African Americans from attending the annual affair held at The Greenbrier. Despite such incidents, the desegregation of West Virginia's public schools was less turbulent than most other southern states.\n\n1957.

King, an African-American minister from New Jersey, announced a Charleston restaurant was the first to refuse him service on a trip from Birmingham, Alabama. That same month, several African-American boxers walked out of the All West Virginia Amateur Boxing Tournament, sponsored by the Charleston Gazette. The protest occurred because one of the boxers was asked to sit in the balcony of the American Legion Armory rather than on the main floor. Gazette promotion manager James Dent resolved the situation, stating the newspaper would not permit the arena to be segregated.

On August 11, the state's first chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) was formed in Charleston and began boycotts of the Woolworth, Kresge, and Newberry five-and-ten-cent stores which refused to serve African Americans at their lunch counters. The following month, the five-and-ten-cent stores integrated. CORE targeted other cities, including Bluefield and Huntington. Boycotts led to the integration of restaurants, department stores, and movie theaters, although some businesses remained segregated until the late 1960s.
