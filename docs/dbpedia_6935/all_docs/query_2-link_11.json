        "text": "The first owners of the Blues, Sid Salomon Jr. and Sid Salomon III were the men behind the franchise's origin. Awarded the team for the NHL's 1967 expansion, the Salomons oversaw early team success and empowered players like Barclay and Bob Plager to cement themselves as St. Louis legends.\n\nThey famously treated the players like royalty, including presenting Red Berenson with several gifts following his team-record six-goal performance on Nov. 7, 1968: a 1969 Chevrolet station wagon, a canoe and a 20-gauge shotgun."
