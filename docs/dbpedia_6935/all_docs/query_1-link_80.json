        "text": "Throughout the year, the Sip Advisor will alphabetically travel the National Hockey League (NHL), discovering the best and worst each team has to offer in a variety of subjects. We will also feature a drink based off the franchise. Today, we *looks at calendar*… ugh, travel to Toronto to investigate why the Maple Leafs have often been named the “Most Hated Team in Hockey”:\n\nEstablishment Story: The Toronto hockey team was founded in 1917. The club was known as the Arenas and later St. Patricks, before finally receiving the Maple Leafs moniker in 1927, when the team was bought by Conn Smythe. An Original Six franchise, the Leafs were rebranded by Smythe to match the national symbol of Canada. They were also to wear red and white jerseys, but briefly wore white and green, before settling on their iconic blue and white.\n\nStanley Cups: None since 1967 and that’s all that really matters. Seriously, though, the Leafs have won 13 championships, all of which occurred when the league consisted of only six teams. The Leafs have two recognized dynasties, from 1946-51 and 1961-67. Not only has the team not won a Stanley Cup since 1967, they have no Finals appearances since then, as well, with five Conference Finals losses during that time.\n\nCelebrity Fan: Somehow, the Leafs have quite the collection of celebrity supporters. Actors Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, Will Arnett and Keanu Reeves support the team, along with musicians Justin Bieber and Drake. Professional wrestler Edge is a fan, as is astronaut Chris Hadfield. As for female celebs, tennis star Bianca Andreescu can often be seen rocking the blue and white. Personally, I think they’re all nuts!\n\nSuper Fan: Steven Glynn, better known by the moniker Steve Dangle, turned his Leafs fandom into a career. Dangle went from posting YouTube videos to becoming an analyst for Sportsnet. His book This Team Is Ruining My Life (But I Love Them): How I Became A Professional Hockey Fan, was released in 2019 to critical acclaim. Today, Dangle co-hosts a podcast and the blooper web series Steve’s Dang-Its.\n\nMascot: Carlton the Bear is a polar bear, named for the street Maple Leaf Gardens was located. Carlton wears jersey number 60, in homage to the address of the iconic arena. Carlton debuted for the 1995-96 season. At the 2000 NHL All-Star Game in Toronto, Carlton hosted the inaugural Mascot Summit. Carlton is on track to surpass long-time Leafs player George Armstrong for most appearances with the franchise during the 2023-24 season.\n\nTradition: The Leafs greatest ritual is losing, particularly in the first round of the playoffs, if they even get there. Just kidding! When the team has made the post-season in more recent years, fans have gathered in Maple Leaf Square, located outside Scotiabank Arena. This has provided the Sip Advisor with many moments of schadenfreude, as Toronto supporters have been visibly crushed by losses. I must admit, their tears sustain me!\n\nAppearances in Media: The Leafs most prominent appearance in popular culture is in the Mike Myers’ movie The Love Guru, where Myers plays a guru tasked with fixing the team’s players, particularly star Darren Roanoke. The Leafs were also heavily featured in the 1971 Canadian film Face-Off. Another notable appearance in media is Toronto’s inclusion in the children’s book The Hockey Sweater.\n\nEvents/Scandals: The Harold Ballard years as owner of the Leafs were filled with controversies, with perhaps the most notable blemish on the franchise being the Maple Leaf Gardens child sex abuse scandal. Ballard owned the arena during the time a trio of employees abused at least two dozen children. Ballard was also convicted of 47 counts of fraud, theft and tax evasion, during his ownership tenure, serving one-third of a nine-year prison sentence.\n\nRivalry: Everyone hates the Leafs, right? Okay, they do have a substantial fan base, much of whom probably don’t like me very much, but I’m not wrong that many revile Toronto. Enemy teams include the Ottawa Senators (Battle of Ontario), Montreal Canadiens (only two Canadian clubs, divided by language and other cultural differences, until 1967), Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings, and Buffalo Sabres (Battle of the QEW).\n\nTragedy: Bill Barilko spent his entire NHL career with the Leafs. He was the overtime hero of the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals, but disappeared that off-season while on a fishing trip. In 1962, the wreckage of the plane Barilko had been travelling in was discovered. Barilko is the subject of The Tragically Hip song Fifty Mission Cap, which has become an anthem of sorts for Leafs fans. Also, Leafs prospect Rodion Amirov succumbed to a brain tumour in August 2023.\n\nPlayer Nicknames: As much as I hate the Leafs, their fans have come up with some creative monikers for players. Tops among them, would be Optimus Reim for goaltender James Reimer. The name was based on Optimus Prime from the Transformers franchise. Other popular culture nicknames for players include The Cat (Felix Potvin), from the character Felix the Cat, Captain Crunch (Wendel Clark), based off the children’s cereal, and Uncle Leo (Leo Komarov), borrowed from Seinfeld.\n\nLine: Many trios in hockey history have been dubbed ‘The Kid Line’, but the original played for the Leafs during the 1930s. Joe Primeau was 23 years old, while his linemates, Charlie Conacher and Harvey Jackson were only 18 when they were put together in late 1929. The unit only won one Stanley Cup together, despite five Finals appearances. The line has remained popular over the years, with a children’s book published in 2001.\n\nCaptain: George Armstrong was captain of the Leafs for a club record 12 seasons. He played his entire 21-campaign career with the team, winning four Stanley Cups. Armstrong’s jersey number 10 was retired by the Leafs in 2016. Another notable captain for Toronto was Mats Sundin, who in 1997, became the first non-Canadian to wear the ‘C’ in franchise history. Sundin served in the role for 11 seasons, becoming the longest serving non-North American born captain in NHL history.\n\nEnforcer: Tie Domi is the Leafs single-season and all-time penalty minute king, with 365 and 2,265 minutes in the sin bin. Domi also has the most fighting majors in NHL history with 333, a majority of those recorded during his time with Toronto. Domi was originally drafted by the Leafs in 1988, but didn’t play for them until 1995, after stops with the New York Rangers and Winnipeg Jets.\n\nFamily Values: Perhaps the most notable family members to play together with the Leafs were brothers-in-law Shayne Corson and Darcy Tucker, from 2000 to 2003. Tucker is married to Corson’s sister, with the two also previously playing for the Montreal Canadiens together. Father and son combos to play for the Leafs, include Mike and Nick Foligno, Bryan and Mason Marchment and Tie and Max Domi.\n\nReturning Players: Wendel Clark spent three stints with the Leafs. He was drafted first overall by the team in 1985, playing nine seasons (three as captain) in his first tenure. Clark then spent two campaigns with other teams, before returning to Toronto for another go around. Clark retired after the 1999-2000 season, following a final 20 games with the Leafs. Fellow franchise icon Doug Gilmour also ended his career with the Leafs in 2003, injured in his first game back after a trade deadline deal.\n\nShort Stint: For a time, each season seemed to feature the Leafs bringing in an aged star – or two – hoping they would add something to their upcoming playoff chances. This included Tom Barrasso (four games in 2002), Phil Housley (four games in 2003), Glen Wesley (12 games in 2003), Brian Leetch (28 games in 2004), and Ron Francis (24 games in 2004). Another brief tenure with the club, belongs to Joe Thornton, who suited up with Toronto for 51 games in 2020-21.\n\nUndrafted: Borje Salming was brought to the NHL from Sweden as a free agent in 1973. By the end of his long tenure with the Leafs, he changed the perception of European players being seen as soft. This was perhaps best exemplified when Salming had his face accidentally stepped on by a skate in 1986, requiring over 200 stitches and cosmetic surgery to repair. Salming holds a number of Leafs records for a defenseman.\n\nTrade: One of the largest transactions in NHL history was the 1992 10-player deal between the Leafs and Calgary Flames that brought cult hero Doug Gilmour to Toronto. During his first full season with the Leafs, Gilmour recorded 127 points and earned the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward in the league. Gilmour’s tenure would also see the team make back-to-back appearances in the Conference Finals.\n\nSigning: The Leafs struggled mightily from the late 2000s to the mid 2010s, exacerbated by a number of misguided free agent deals. This included contracts for Jeff Finger (four-year, $14 million in 2008), Mike Komisarek (five-year, $21.5 million in 2009) and David Clarkson (seven-year, $36.75 in 2013). Finger played half his contract with Toronto’s minor league affiliate, Komisarek had his contract bought out in the final season and Clarkson was traded after two campaigns.\n\nDraft Pick: The Leafs have picked first overall twice in their history, taking Wendel Clark in 1985 and Auston Matthews in 2016. Some of their other top picks include Darryl Sittler (8th overall in 1970), Lanny McDonald (4th overall in 1973), Morgan Rielly (5th overall in 2012), and Mitch Marner (4th overall in 2015). Perhaps their greatest diamond in the rough selection was taking Tomas Kaberle 204th overall in 1996. He would go on to play 12 seasons in Toronto.\n\nHoldouts: During the 1981-82 season, Darryl Sittler requested a trade due to the deterioration of his relationship with Leafs management and ownership. When no deal was reached after months of waiting, Sittler left the team, at the advice of his doctor, on the basis he was “mentally depressed”. Sittler was eventually dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers, ending his 12-season tumultuous stint with the franchise.\n\nBuyouts: Mikhail Grabovski had completed the first season of his five-year, $27.5 million contract, when the Leafs surprisingly used one of their compliance buyouts from the 2012-13 lockout on him. This meant Grabovski was due $14.33 million over the next eight seasons. Two days earlier, the Leafs used their other compliance buyout on defenseman Mike Komisarek, owing him $2.33 million over two years.\n\nUnique Game: Given the Leafs profile, the team has been used for many marquee NHL events. This included the 2014 Winter Classic and 2017 NHL Centennial Classic, both against the Detroit Red Wings, a 2018 Stadium Series contest versus the Washington Capitals, and the 2022 Heritage Classic opposite the Buffalo Sabres. Toronto also played two 1993 pre-season games against the New York Rangers in London, United Kingdom.\n\nGoal: Each game of the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals went to overtime, with the Leafs pulling off a 4-1 series victory over the Montreal Canadiens. Bill Barilko scored the Stanley Cup-clinching goal at 2:53 of Game 5’s extra period. Another famous tally in Leafs lore is the one Bobby Baun scored in overtime of Game 6 of the 1964 Stanley Cup Finals, while playing with a broken ankle. The Leafs would win Game 7 4-0, earning their third consecutive championship.\n\nFight/Brawl: Things got out of hand during a 2013 pre-season game versus the Buffalo Sabres, leading to a brawl. When Buffalo enforcer John Scott went after Toronto star Phil Kessel, newly-signed Leaf David Clarkson left the bench to protect Kessel. This resulted in an automatic 10-game suspension for Clarkson, who never got going in Toronto, and was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets after 118 games and only 15 goals and 26 points, despite an annual salary of $5.25 million.\n\nInjury: When Leafs forward Ace Bailey suffered a severe head injury, following a hard check by Eddie Shore of the Boston Bruins, two major developments came from the incident. First, the inaugural NHL all-star game was played months later to raise money for Bailey and his family. Second, at that all-star benefit game, Bailey’s number 6 jersey was retired, becoming the first player in professional sports history to receive such an honour.\n\nPenalty: Leafs enforcers have a history of getting into trouble. Tiger Williams was charged with assault (later acquitted) for a 1977 stick hit on Dennis Owchar, which required 46 stitches to seal. A decade later, John Kordic high sticked Keith Acton, resulting in a 10-game suspension. Tie Domi had two infractions earn him lengthy bans, one for sucker punching Ulf Samuelsson in 1995 (eight games) and another for elbowing Scott Niedermayer in the 2001 playoffs (rest of series and eight games the following season).\n\nWildest Story: When Brian Spencer was to make his debut with the Leafs on December 12, 1970, he informed his father, Roy, of the good news. Later, Roy tried to watch the game on TV, but was greeted with a Vancouver Canucks-California Golden Seals contest instead. Upset, Roy drove 135 km to the closest TV station, where he threatened employees at gunpoint to air the Leafs game. A standoff with police and shootout ensued, resulting in Roy’s death. Brian would later also die by gunshot during a drug robbery.\n\nBlooper: In one of the most viewed NHL videos of all-time, enforcer Tie Domi was banished to the penalty box during a game in Philadelphia. A Flyers fan was heckling Domi, so the enforcer squirted his water bottle into the crowd. Another angered fan ended up falling into the penalty box when the pane of glass separating players from the audience gave way. Domi punched the fan multiple times before being pulled away. Domi was fined $1,000 for the incident.\n\nMiscellaneous: In an event that would make international headlines, the Leafs lost a 2020 game with Emergency Back-up Goalie David Ayres in net for the opposing Carolina Hurricanes. Worst of all, Ayres was employed by the Leafs, as a building operator/Zamboni driver. Ayres became a legend following the 6-3 victory, receiving his own day in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the story is set to become a Disney feature film.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs: Toronto Maple Leafs\n\n0.75 oz Blue Curacao\n\n0.75 oz Irish Cream\n\nI still find it hard to believe, as a youngster, I was a fan of the Leafs. Today, everything about Toronto and their sports landscape irks me. This is because the sports networks are all based there and we who live elsewhere in the country are treated to an unwanted deluge of coverage on Toronto teams.\n\nThroughout the year, the Sip Advisor will alphabetically travel the National Hockey League (NHL), discovering the best and worst each team has to offer in a variety of subjects. We will also feature a drink based off the franchise. Today, we visit La Belle Province, to learn about one of the most storied sports franchises in the world, the Montreal Canadiens:\n\nEstablishment Story: The Canadiens are one of the NHL’s Original Six franchises, being founded in 1909 and playing in the National Hockey Association. In fact, the team is the longest continuously operating ice hockey team in the world, predating the formation of the NHL. The team was given the name ‘Les Canadiens’, as it was supposed to be comprised of French players and supported by Montreal’s francophone community.\n\nStanley Cups: The Canadiens hold the NHL record for Stanley Cup victories with 24. Montreal’s dynasty teams of 1955-60, 1964-69 and 1975-79 largely contributed to this total. The Canadiens have appeared in a total of 35 Stanley Cup Finals. Introduced in 1985, Montreal has never won the Presidents’ Trophy, awarded for best regular season record. Had it always existed, the Canadiens would have won it on 21 occasions.\n\nCelebrity Fan: As you can expect, given the club’s reverence with French Canadians, there are a number of celebrity supporters of the Canadiens. Among the team’s most famous fans are singer Celine Dion, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, actors Jay Baruchel, Viggo Mortensen and William Shatner, and mixed martial arts fighter Georges St-Pierre. Legend has it, Mortensen wore a Canadiens jersey under his armor while filming the Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nSuper Fan: I believe every Canadiens fan to be a super fan in their own right. After all, supporting the team is like a religion in Montreal. In fact, the Canadiens launched their own Hall of Fan in 2022, with the original inductees being Sunil Peetush, Maika Parisien and Thommy Boudreau. Perks of the honour included an induction ceremony and having their names on a banner in the Molson Ex Zone, within the Bell Centre, as well as watching a game from a suite.\n\nMascot: Youppi! was the mascot of Major League Baseball’s Montreal Expos from 1979 to 2004, before the team was relocated to Washington, D.C., becoming the Washington Nationals. Needing a new team to support, Youppi! joined the Canadiens. His jersey number is an exclamation mark. Youppi was the first Canadian mascot to be inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame, earning the honour in 2020.\n\nTradition: The Canadiens team motto is “Nos bras meurtris vous tendent le flambeau, à vous toujours de le porter bien haut.” This translates as “To you from failing hands we throw the torch. Be yours to hold it high.” The slogan comes from the famous World War I poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae. Canadiens fans have also been known for the chants “Olé, Olé, Olé”, along with the team’s goal song and “Nah Nah Nah Nah Hey Hey Hey Goodbye”, as the team wound down a game with victory imminent.\n\nAppearances in Media: The Hockey Sweater is a cherished children’s book, which was later turned into an animated short, titled The Sweater. The story is about a little boy who’s gifted a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater, despite living in Montreal and being a loyal Canadiens fan. It is based on author Roch Carrier’s childhood experience. The book and short are so iconic, a line from the story appeared on Canadian $5 bills for a time.\n\nEvents/Scandals: Occurring on March 17, 1955, the Richard Riot transpired because beloved Canadiens superstar Maurice Richard was suspended for the remainder of the 1954-55 season, including the playoffs, following an altercation with a linesman. When NHL president Clarence Campbell appeared at the Montreal Forum for the Canadiens next game, fans revolted causing $100,000 worth of property damage, only being quelled by Richard asking for supporters to stop.\n\nRivalry: Many view Montreal’s feud with the Boston Bruins as one of the NHL’s greatest rivalries. The two teams have faced each other in the playoffs countless times and heated matchups aren’t restricted to the post-season. The Canadiens also have checkered histories with geographically close teams in the Toronto Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators and would still be enemies of the Quebec Nordiques and Montreal Maroons, if those clubs still existed.\n\nTragedy: The Canadiens long history includes numerous tragedies. First, days after the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals were cancelled due to the Spanish flu pandemic, player Joe Hall died of pneumonia. Next, goalie Georges Vezina succumbed to tuberculosis in March 1926. Later, in 1937, star Howie Morenz perished due to a coronary embolism, while recovering from a broken leg (more on that below). Finally, prospect Neil Carnes was killed in a 1989 motorcycle accident.\n\nPlayer Nicknames: Canadiens fans and media work diligently to create nicknames for their beloved players. Some of the best, include Boom Boom (Bernie Geoffrion), Big Bird (Larry Robinson), Roadrunner (Yvon Cournoyer), Rocket/Pocket Rocket (Maurice/Henri Richard), Flower/Blond Demon (Guy Lafleur), Chicoutimi Cucumber (George Vezina), Goal Caufield (Cole Caufield), WiFi (Arber Xhekaj), Jesus Price (Carey Price), and Saint Patrick (Patrick Roy).\n\nLine: The Punch Line of Toe Blake, Elmer Lach and Maurice Richard were formed during the 1943-44 season and instantly had great chemistry. The following campaign, the trio finished first, second and third in league scoring. They would win two Stanley Cups together. Two championships, however, pale in comparison to The Dynasty Line of Guy Lafleur, Steve Shutt and Pete Mahovlich/Jacques Lemaire, who won four straight Stanley Cups from 1976 to 1979.\n\nCaptain: Amongst other notable leaders, Jean Beliveau gets the nod here. He led the team for 10 years, winning four Stanley Cups in five seasons from 1965 to 1969. Even after his career wrapped, Beliveau continued to leave his mark on the Canadiens, winning seven Stanley Cups as an executive with the team. Beliveau was named to the Order of Canada in 1998 and had his name added to Canada’s Walk of Fame in 2001.\n\nEnforcer: Chris Nilan, nicknamed Knuckles for his fighting skills, holds the Canadiens team records for career (2,248) and single-season (358) penalty minutes. He was a member of Montreal’s 1986 Stanley Cup squad. When the Canadiens closed the fabled Montreal Forum and began auctioning off pieces from the historic building, Nilan bought the penalty box… a home away from home.\n\nFamily Values: It’s pretty special when three generations of a family played for the same team. Bernie Geoffrion, his son Dan and his grandson Blake all suited up for the Canadiens. Add in Howie Morenz, whose daughter married Bernie and was mother to Dan and grandmother to Blake, for a non-direct fourth generation. Additionally, brother combos to play together for Montreal include Maurice and Henri Richard and Frank and Pete Mahovlich.\n\nReturning Players: Howie Morenz is a Canadiens legend, playing the first 11 seasons of his career with the team and winning three Stanley Cups, while becoming one of the NHL’s first stars. After time with the Chicago Blackhawks and New York Rangers, Morenz returned to Montreal for the 1936-37 campaign. Sadly, Morenz broke his leg late in the season and weeks later, died of a coronary embolism, caused by blood clots from the injury. 50,000 fans attended his funeral held at the Montreal Forum.\n\nShort Stint: A number of notable Russian players had limited tenures with the Canadiens. This includes Alexander Radulov, who revived his NHL career with the team in 2016-17, before leaving for the Dallas Stars; Ilya Kovalchuk, who played 22 games with Montreal in 2020, between stints with the Los Angeles Kings and Washington Capitals; and Alexander Semin, who played a mere 15 contests with the Canadiens in 2015, before he was waived and had his contract terminated for failing to report to the minor leagues.\n\nUndrafted: The Canadiens signed Mike Keane on September 25, 1985. Keane would spend eight seasons with Montreal, winning a Stanley Cup in 1993 and serving as team captain for half a season. He was part of the infamous Patrick Roy trade, accompanying the star goalie, where they would win another championship in 1996. Keane would win a third Stanley Cup with the Dallas Stars in 1999. He retired having played 1,161 regular season games and 220 playoff contests.\n\nTrade: Goalie Ken Dryden was actually drafted by the Boston Bruins 14th overall in 1964, but was traded a couple weeks later to the Canadiens. Legend has it, Dryden’s agent never told him of being drafted by Boston and he only became aware of how he actually ended up in Montreal midway through his career. Although Dryden only played eight NHL seasons, he won six Stanley Cups and five Vezina Trophies as the league’s best goaltender.\n\nSigning: Among the Canadiens best deals was bringing in Brian Gionta with a five-year, $25 million pact in 2009. Gionta would be named the team’s captain in 2010, serving in the role until the end of his contract. One of the worst signings by Montreal was adding hometown enforcer Georges Laraque. Brought in to add toughness to the team, Laraque only lasted a season and a half of his thee-year, $4.5 million deal before being released and bought out.\n\nDraft Pick: One of the savviest moves the Canadiens ever made was trading for the California Golden Seals first round draft pick in 1971. Highly touted Quebecois players Guy Lafleur and Marcel Dionne were available to be chosen that year and when the Golden Seals finished last in the league, the Canadiens earned the right to select first overall. They eventually decided to pick Guy Lafleur, who became a Montreal legend over 14 seasons with the team.\n\nHoldouts: Some of the Canadiens most iconic players have endured interesting contract disputes with the club. Ken Dryden’s 1973-74 disagreement resulted in the netminder articling for a law firm, a requirement needed to earn his law degree. Guy Lafleur decided to retire 19 games into the 1984-85 season, unhappy with coach Jacques Lemaire, a denied trade request and his contract. Finally, Patrick Roy’s mid-season statement he would not play for the team again led to his trade to the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nBuyouts: Karl Alzner was one of the worst free agent signings in Canadiens history. In 2017, the stay-at-home defenseman was given a five-year, $23.125 million deal. In his second season with Montreal, he was demoted to the minors and would only play four more games for the team, before his contract was bought out in October 2020. This resulted in a $3.33 million payout over four years.\n\nUnique Game: The Canadiens have been part of a number of international tours and showcase events for the NHL. This includes the 1938 Detroit Red Wings–Montreal Canadiens European Tour (first NHL games outside North America), a 1975 New Year’s Eve game vs. Moscow Central Red Army (played during the Cold War), the 2003 Heritage Classic vs. Edmonton Oilers (first regular season outdoor game), 2011 Heritage Classic vs. Calgary Flames, and 2016 Winter Classic vs. Boston Bruins.\n\nGoal: On March 18, 1945, Maurice Richard became the first player in NHL history to score 50 goals in 50 games. Richard finally reached the plateau with 2:15 left in the last game of the season, en route to a 4-2 win for Montreal. Richard’s achievement was even more notable for how much opposing players were targeting him, with an increase in slashes, hooks and other interference, as he pursued the feat.\n\nFight/Brawl: Canadiens teams of the 1980s were involved in a number of notable brawls. There was the infamous 1984 Good Friday Massacre with the Quebec Nordiques, but also a pair of lesser known melees deserving of some attention. These include a 1986 fracas that moved onto the Boston Bruins bench and tunnel to the dressing rooms, as well as a 1987 punch-up with the Philadelphia Flyers that occurred before the game had even begun.\n\nInjury: A couple of serious injuries have ended Canadiens players careers. First, in January 2000, Trent McCleary took a slapshot to the throat, crushing his larynx and requiring immediate life-saving surgery. With his air passage 15 per cent narrower, McCleary was unable to resume his career. Second, while playing for the Canadiens’ American Hockey League affiliate, Blake Geoffrion suffered a depressed skull fracture following his fall from a hip check, resulting in his eventual retirement.\n\nPenalty: A little more about the incident which led to the Richard Riot, Maurice Richard had a long history of retaliation penalties, stemming from physical and verbal attacks from opposing players. On March 13, 1955, Richard was involved in a skirmish with Boston Bruins player Hal Laycoe and when referees tried to intervene, Richard punched linesman Cliff Thompson twice, knocking him unconscious. A match penalty resulted and Boston police even tried to arrest Richard.\n\nWildest Story: As a teenager, the Canadiens pursued Jean Beliveau, attempting to sign him to contracts that would ensure he eventually played for the team. As Beliveau appeared to not be interested in turning pro, the Canadiens decided to buy the league Beliveau was playing in, the Quebec Senior Hockey League, turning it into a minor pro circuit and giving the Canadiens the rights to all players in the league, particularly Beliveau.\n\nBlooper: When Doug Gilmour was penalized during the 2002 playoffs, he responded by slamming the penalty box door. This caused the glass to shatter, although Gilmour barely reacted to the mess he had created. Gilmour has said after that game, which he thought may be the last of his career, Canadiens owner George Gillett came to him with a wheelbarrow of glass. When Gilmour signed a few pieces, Gillett asked him to sign some more to be sold later.\n\nMiscellaneous: On November 1, 1959, goalie Jacques Plante blocked a shot with his face, resulting in a broken nose. While Plante had practiced with a mask previously, head coach Toe Blake wouldn’t allow him to wear it during games, fearing it would obstruct his vision. On this night, Plante returned to the ice after being stitched up, donning the mask. He went on an 18-game unbeaten stretch, popularizing the use of the mask as protective equipment.\n\nMontreal Canadiens: Habitant\n\n1.5 oz Whiskey\n\nSplash of Lemon Juice\n\nDash of Maple Syrup\n\nDashes of Peychaud’s Bitters\n\nGarnish with a Maraschino Cherry\n\nThis cocktail was created by Larry Dennis of the Seignory Club in Quebec. Les Habitants is a popular nickname for the Canadiens. Other monikers for the club include Le Bleu-Blanc-Rouge, La Sainte-Flanelle, Le Tricolore, Les Glorieux, Le Grand Club, and Les Plombiers.\n\nThroughout the year, the Sip Advisor will alphabetically travel the National Hockey League (NHL), discovering the best and worst each team has to offer in a variety of subjects. We will also feature a drink based off the franchise. Today, we throw on the cowboy boots and leather chaps, en route to Calgary, to investigate how hot them Flames really are:\n\nEstablishment Story: The Flames relocated from Atlanta – where they had played from 1972 to 1980 – keeping the Flames nickname from their predecessor. The Flames filled a professional hockey void in the city that had existed since the World Hockey Association’s Calgary Cowboys had folded in 1977. The team has been locally owned by a group of oil tycoons and others since 1981.\n\nStanley Cups: The Flames have a sole Stanley Cup, winning the championship in 1989. They have appeared in two other Stanley Cup Finals, losing to the Montreal Canadiens in 1986 (the same team they would defeat in 1989) and coming up short against the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2004. The Flames 1989 triumph was the only time the famed Montreal Forum witnessed an opposing team capture the Stanley Cup.\n\nCelebrity Fan: The famous Hart wrestling family is synonymous with Calgary. Therefore, it’s no surprise Bret ‘The Hitman’ Hart is a fan of the Flames. Hart was even a co-founding owner of the Western Hockey League Calgary Hitmen, along with Flames star Theoren Fleury. The Hitmen are now owned and operated by the Flames ownership group. Other notable Flames fans include Letterkenny creator Jared Keeso, country musician George Canyon and golfer Graham Delaet.\n\nSuper Fan: A couple Flames fans have been profiled for the man caves they have created, dedicated to the team. Dean McCord and Chris Payne have each created settings to watch games that are the next best thing to being in attendance at the Saddledome, with large TVs, memorabilia and lighting/sound effects. Both of their homes have become popular places for their friends to enjoy Calgary games.\n\nMascot: Harvey the Hound was the NHL’s first mascot, debuting in 1983 as the Flames first “pound” draft selection. A memorable moment for Harvey occurred in 2003, when he was taunting Edmonton Oilers coach Craig MacTavish, who proceeded to pulls Harvey’s tongue out and throw it into the stands. Harvey has also served as the secondary mascot of the Canadian Football League’s Calgary Stampeders.\n\nTradition: Since the 1986 playoffs, when the Flames battled and defeated the Edmonton Oilers, fans have filled the Saddledome, all donning Flames jerseys, t-shirts and other paraphernalia, creating the C of Red. Flames playoff victories feature fans flocking to the Red Mile, a stretch of 17th Avenue SW, in Calgary. Prior to the Red Mile, fans celebrated on 11th Avenue SW, known as Electric Avenue.\n\nAppearances in Media: Iconic X-Men character, Wolverine, is a Calgary Flames fan. This makes sense, as Wolverine’s fictional backstory has him being from Alberta. His devotion to the Flames goes so far, that in Wolverine: First Class #6, his game watching is interrupted by some robots, causing him to go nuts on the machines, all while clad in a Flames jersey. MacGyver was also a big Flames fan, often wearing various merchandise on the hit 80’s TV show.\n\nEvents/Scandals: The Flames organization’s attempts to build a new arena, replacing the 39-year-old Saddledome (one of the oldest rinks in the league) can best be described as a rollercoaster ride. Deals have been made and later reneged on, while team management and Calgary city council continue to clash. The latest is that the two sides have resumed talks over a new home for the Flames, but no one can predict how it all finally plays out.\n\nRivalry: The Battle of Alberta, against provincial nemesis the Edmonton Oilers, is one of hockey’s greatest rivalries. Between 1983 and 1990, the Flames and Oilers dominated the NHL, with one of the teams appearing in the Stanley Cup Finals each year, totalling six Stanley Cup wins. Other top opponents of the Flames include the Vancouver Canucks, with the two teams having met in many playoff clashes.\n\nTragedy: Two Flames prospects have sadly passed away following being drafted by the team. First, George Pelawa was selected 16th overall in 1986, but was killed in a car accident that summer. More than two decades later, Mickey Renaud was drafted 143rd overall in 2007, but died suddenly, due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickening of the heart), on February 18, 2008.\n\nPlayer Nicknames: Nicknames in sports are common, but it’s rare when a player goes out and trademarks their moniker. Johnny Gaudreau spent the first eight seasons of his career with the Flames and became known as Johnny Hockey during that time. Gaudreau took inspiration from Johnny Manziel, who trademarked the nickname Johnny Football in 2014, when he was a big time college football quarterback, before quickly fizzling out as a professional.\n\nLine: Two of the highest scoring lines in Flames history never received the nickname treatment. This includes the units of Gary Roberts, Robert Reichel and Theo Fleury and Johnny Gaudrea, Matthew Tkachuk and Elias Lindholm. One trio that did gain a humourous moniker was the Full Pension Line of Milan Lucic, Trevor Lewis and Brad Richardson, based on each player surpassing the minimum games needed to earn a full NHL pension.\n\nCaptain: Jarome Iginla was named captain of the Flames for the 2003-04 season, with Craig Conroy relinquishing the ‘C’ to his teammate. Iginla would serve in the role until he was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins at the 2013 trade deadline. He had spent 16 seasons in Calgary, setting a number of club records along the way. Iginla’s number 12 was retired by the Flames in 2019.\n\nEnforcer: Tim Hunter holds the Flames records for total penalty minutes (2,405), penalty minutes in a season (375) and penalty minutes in a playoff run (108). Hunter played 545 games for Calgary – his hometown team – being a member of the 1989 Stanley Cup-winning squad. Hunter left the Flames as the final pick of the 1992 Expansion Draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning, although he was quickly traded to the Quebec Nordiques.\n\nFamily Values: Two pairs of brothers have played for the Flames at the same time. First, Robyn and Richie Regehr patrolled the Calgary blueline together for 20 games over two seasons. Later, Dougie and Freddie Hamilton spent parts of three seasons playing together with the Flames. It should also be noted, a number of the Sutter brothers have had roles with the team, including Brian, Darryl and Brent each coaching the club.\n\nReturning Players: Theo Fleury is one of the most beloved players to ever suit up for the Flames. His 1999 trade away from Calgary, following 11 seasons with the club, was emotional for all parties. In 2009, after six years away from the NHL, Fleury attempted to make a comeback and there was only one place he wanted it to happen. After recording four points in four pre-season games, Fleury was released from his tryout, but was able to retire as a member of the Flames.\n\nShort Stint: Jaromir Jagr is a legend in the game of hockey, but his time with the Flames is best described as anything but legendary. Jagr signed with Calgary as the 2017-18 season was about to begin. Three months later, the Flames were in talks to terminate Jagr’s contract, following one goal and six assists in 22 games. Jagr returned to HC Kladno, the club he owns, where he still plays to this day.\n\nUndrafted: When Martin St. Louis retired, he was fifth all-time in points by an undrafted player, but his success came after leaving Calgary. As for players who are best recognized as a member of the Flames, defenseman Mark Giordano was signed after attending Calgary’s 2004 summer camp. In 2019, at the age of 35 and serving as the Flames captain, Giordano would win the Norris Trophy, as the NHL’s best defenseman.\n\nTrade: One of the best deals the Flames ever made, as well as one of their worst transactions, both involved Doug Gilmour. Gilmour was acquired by Calgary in 1988, the centerpiece of a seven-player deal with the St. Louis Blues. The Flames would go on to win the Stanley Cup that season. Then, in 1992, a disgruntled Gilmour was dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs, this time the focal point of a 10-player swap.\n\nSigning: Two of the Flames worst contracts ever went to forwards Troy Brouwer (four-year, $18 million in 2016) and James Neal (five-year, $28.75 million in 2018). Brouwer was bought out of his deal after two increasingly disappointing seasons, while Neal was traded after one campaign, with the Flames taking back Milan Lucic’s equally bad deal (seven-year, $42 million in 2016) with the Edmonton Oilers, in return.\n\nDraft Pick: The highest the Flames have ever drafted, was fourth overall in 2014. They selected Sam Bennett, who is considered a bust with the team, although he has since gone on to some success with the Florida Panthers. As for good picks, Calgary’s 1984 draft was particularly fruitful, as they added Gary Roberts (12th overall), Paul Ranheim (38th), Brett Hull (117th) and Gary Suter (180th). They joined 1981 draftess Al MacInnis (15th) and Mike Vernon (56th).\n\nHoldouts: Joe Nieuwendyk was the captain of the Flames in 1995, when he endured a contract dispute with the organization. Nieuwendyk sat out until he was traded to the Dallas Stars on December 19, 1995, in exchange for Jarome Iginla and Corey Millen. The deal worked out for both teams, as Nieuwendyk would eventually win a Stanley Cup with Dallas in 1999, while Jarome Iginla became the face of the franchise for more than a decade.\n\nBuyouts: Michael Stone’s 2019 buyout was notable not for how long or how expensive the compensation would take to pay out, but because over a month later, the Flames signed him to another deal. Originally, he was the odd man out on full defense corps, resulting in the final season of his three-year contract being bought out. When an off-season injury to fellow d-man Juuso Valimaki occurred, Calgary circled back to a known commodity and inked Stone to a league minimum deal.\n\nUnique Game: The Flames have played in two Heritage Classic contests. First, in 2011, they defeated the Montreal Canadiens at McMahon Stadium, in Calgary. Then, in 2019, they lost to the Winnipeg Jets at Mosaic Stadium, in Regina, Saskatchewan. The Flames also opened the 1998-99 season with a pair of games against the San Jose Sharks in Tokyo, Japan, as well as playing two 2018 exhibition matches against the Boston Bruins, in Shenzhen and Beijing, China.\n\nGoal: Flames captain Lanny McDonald had sat out much of the 1989 Stanley Cup Finals, but was reinserted into the lineup for Game 6. With the game tied, McDonald scored to give Calgary the lead, en route to the franchise’s only Stanley Cup. The marker would prove to be McDonald’s final NHL goal, as he would retire after the championship victory. McDonald lifting the cup and parading it around the ice is among the greatest images in Flames history.\n\nFight/Brawl: Stu Grimson was only a rookie when he defeated one of the NHL’s toughest fighters in Dave Brown of the Edmonton Oilers. The rematch didn’t go as well, with Grimson suffering skull fractures from the one-sided beating. Emergency surgery for Grimson was required, but the enforcer went on to a long career, earning a reputation as a feared pugilist and one of the best nicknames the sports world has ever heard, the Grim Reaper.\n\nInjury: In November 1991, Gary Roberts was hit from behind by Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Bob Rouse, needing a stretcher to be removed from the ice. This was the start of neck issues for Roberts, who would eventually have to play wearing a brace. After missing much of the 1994-95 and 1995-96 seasons, Roberts decided to retire, at the age of 30. Thankfully, after some training and lifestyle changes, Roberts was able to return to hockey in 1997, playing 12 more seasons.\n\nPenalty: On January 27, 2016, Flames defenseman Dennis Wideman was hit hard into the end boards. On his way back to the bench, Wideman seemed to take his frustrations out on linesman Don Henderson, knocking the official to the ice with a crosscheck. Wideman was suspended for 20 games, later reduced to 10 games by an arbiter. Henderson, who suffered a concussion and never officiated another NHL game, sued Wideman and the Flames for $10.25 million, but the case was stayed by the court.\n\nWildest Story: Social media can actually be an effective tool, as seen when former NHL player Akim Aliu took to Twitter in 2019, accusing Flames coach Bill Peters of directing racial comments towards him when they were both with the minor league Rockford IceHogs. Days later, Peters resigned from the team, while an investigation was being done by Flames team management. Since then, Peters has only coached briefly in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\nBlooper: The Flames nearly committed a massive off-ice blunder in February 2013, when they signed Colorado Avalanche holdout Ryan O’Reilly to a two-year, $10 million offer sheet. Had the Avalanche chose to not match the contract, Calgary would have had to compensate Colorado with draft picks AND could have still lost the player through waivers, since O’Reilly had played games in the Kontinental Hockey League, prior to signing a NHL contract.\n\nMiscellaneous: No article about the Flames could be complete without mentioning Bearcat Murray – the most recognizable trainer in NHL history. Murray joined the Flames with their 1980 arrival in Calgary and stayed with the team on the bench until retiring in 1996, when he moved into the role of a community ambassador. Fan clubs for the recognizable trainer popped up in both Boston and Montreal and Murray was even inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009. He passed away in June 2022.\n\nCalgary Flames: Calgary Flames Martini\n\n2 oz Dry Vermouth\n\n1 oz Gin\n\n1 oz Vodka\n\n1 oz Chambord\n\n1 oz Peach Liqueur\n\nGarnish with Raspberries\n\nFour ounces of Dry Vermouth, as the recipe called for, seemed excessive, so I scaled it back to two ounces. Apparently, this beverage can be found in bars along Calgary’s Red Mile and is popular with many patrons.\n\nStick and Puck\n\nToday, we begin our 52-week tour around the world. Our first stop is the Sip Advisor’s homeland of Canada. The country’s greatest export (other than myself and Crown Royal) is the sport of hockey. It is our national pastime and just simply what we do best. With that in mind, here are some of the wackiest tales from the ice!\n\nBrotherly Love\n\nFighting in hockey is completely accepted… in fact, it’s expected. But even this battle of fisticuffs surprised most fans. On Apr. 7, 1997, with the regular season winding down, the Hartford Whalers faced the Buffalo Sabres. As a scrum ensued in front of Hartford goalie Sean Burke, teammate Keith Primeau grabbed the primary culprit and ended up dropping the gloves with his own brother Wayne. Afterwards, legend has it that both siblings called their mother to apologize for the melee!\n\nFan Fest\n\nOne of the craziest moments in hockey history occurred on Dec. 23, 1979 during a Boston Bruins-New York Rangers tilt in the Big Apple. During a player scrum at the end of the game, a fan managed to cut Bruins player Stan Jonathan’s face with a rolled up program, as well as take his stick. This caused Jonathan’s teammates Terry O’Reilly and Peter McNab to venture over the Plexiglas and into the stands to apprehend the fan. The brawl’s highlight featured future NHL coach, general manager, and broadcaster, Mike Milbury, beating the guilty fan with his own shoe. O’Reilly, McNab, and Milbury were all suspended and fined, while the fan was sentenced to six months in jail.\n\nWishing for a Mulligan\n\nWhen a player is streaking in on an empty net, most fans would conclude that the goal is a gimme. But there are two notable exceptions to the rule. One saw Nashville Predators rookie Craig Smith flying into the opponent’s zone all alone, only to fire the puck over the net and out of play, even while others assumed he had scored. The more infamous incident occurred when former first overall draft choice Patrik Stefan lost control of the puck while hot dogging and was forced to watch in horror as the Edmonton Oilers went the other way to tie the game with seconds left.\n\nKarma’s Coming\n\nDuring a Jan. 26, 2001 contest between the Chicago Blackhawks and Colorado Avalanche, forward Steve Sullivan was struck with a high stick and injured, requiring stitches. He was promptly heckled by a fan, but as the old saying goes: “Karma is a bitch!” Later on in the evening, the puck ended up leaving the playing surface and hitting the same fan who had jeered Sullivan earlier. Sullivan took this opportunity to chirp the fan back… oh, and he also scored two short-handed goals after re-emerging from the trainer’s room.\n\nUnsportsmanlike Conduct\n\nThe referees never get the call right. This is universally accepted. On one trip to the penalty box, however, a frustrated Doug Gilmour took his anger out on the poor door, slamming and destroying it. With shards of glass everywhere, Gilmour looked a little sheepish still sitting in the box and was perhaps a little surprised at his own strength. If you ever wondered why they nicknamed Gilmour “Killer”, you might have your answer here!\n\nBat-Man\n\nHad this game been played around Halloween, things would have been all the more spookier. Throughout most of the contest, a bat was spotted flying around the arena, even coming down to the ice surface and buzzing by players heads. Finally, Buffalo’s Jim Lorentz knocked it out of the air with his stick, before it was carried off the ice. Moments later, fog encompassed the ice surface making it difficult for play to resume. I guess Dracula was pissed and trying to extract his revenge on the guilty parties.\n\nThe Most Dangerous Job\n\nMascots are a very polarizing topic. Some people love them, while others loathe them. I get their appeal to young kids, but I’m personally not a fan… and neither is Terry O’Reilly, it would seem. Yes, this is the same Terry O’Reilly who went into the New York stands in the brawl listed above. On this fateful night, California Golden Seals mascot Krazy George was working his mojo and taunting the Boston Bruins by beating away at a drum. This apparently was enough to set off the man known as “Bloody O’Reilly” and the “Tasmanian Devil”, as he proceeded to jab George with his stick and chase him away from the penalty box.\n\nCanada: Black Tooth Grin\n\n1 oz Crown Royal Whiskey\n\n1 oz Wiser’s Spiced Whiskey\n\nSplash of Cola\n\nGarnish with Gum and Strawberry Syrup\n\nSo much fighting in hockey… brother vs. brother, players vs. fans, players vs. mascots… that’s why we love the game so much! Do you have a wacky hockey moment you expected to see on this list? Drop the gloves with the Sip Advisor and leave a message!\n\nSip Advisor Bar Notes (3.5 Sips out of 5):\n\nWhat can I say about Crown Royal Whiskey that hasn’t already been said… it’s a freakin’ Canadian institution and one of my favourite spirits of all time. This drink was actually created by late Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, but I thought it also fit the bill for an article about hockey players, given their many unfortunate examples of dental damage! It was a good cocktail, with which I subbed in Wiser’s Spiced Whiskey (another Canadian product) for Seagram’s 7 Whiskey. Then I used pieces of Gum and drips of Strawberry Syrup to portray some of that aforementioned dental damage!\n\nWelcome Back\n\nSome players just don’t look right in jerseys that differ from the one they’ve worn for years. In most of the big leagues, athletes can sign one-day contracts so that they may retire as a member of the team that made their career. Other times, a trade brings that star back into the fold. Then, there’s always returning from retirement. Here is some of the greatest returns home in sports history.\n\nTrevor Linden – Vancouver Canucks (NHL)\n\nTrevor Linden, captain of the Vancouver Canucks was traded to the New York Islanders in 1998. After bouncing around to a couple other teams, the Canucks reacquired the heart and soul leader of their last championship appearance team. In Linden’s first game back (which I attended with the Sip Family), he notched a couple points and was named the second star of the game, allowing fans to dedicate all their energy specifically to one of the team’s most legendary figures. A few years later, Linden left the game the right way, serenaded by the fans who adored him for so many years, and making a final trip around the ice surface that hosted so many memories for all involved.\n\nDoug Gilmour – Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL)\n\nGrowing up, for some bizarre reason that I may never be able to explain, I was a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Please collect your jaws from the floor… sadly, it’s true. My favourite player was Doug Gilmour, a gritty and talented player, who nearly led the team to their first Stanley Cup since 1967. Gilmour was traded to New Jersey in 1997, but would return to the Leafs at the 2003 trade deadline, causing fans to rejoice. Sadly, in just his second shift back with the team, he collided knee-on-knee with Calgary’s Dave Lowry and was done for the season, later calling it a career that summer.\n\nHulk Hogan – World Wrestling Entertainment\n\nIn the 1980’s, Hulk Hogan’s symbiotic relationship with the then World Wrestling Federation launched both entities into the stratosphere. Working together, Hogan became one of the most popular wrestlers of all-time, while the WWF became the first promotion to enjoy national mainstream exposure and success. Hogan left the company in 1993 to perform in World Championship Wrestling and didn’t return to the soon-to-be-renamed WWE until 2002. He originally returned as a bad guy, but fans would not have any of that, cheering for Hogan to once again become the “Real American” character most had grown up with. They got their wish and fans feverishly ate up the nostalgia act.\n\nKen Griffey, Jr. – Seattle Mariners (MLB)\n\nKen Griffey, Jr. grew up in the Seattle Mariners organization, debuting in 1989 and even playing alongside his father, Ken Griffey, Sr. Griffey became the face of the franchise and even the entire league, adorning video games, posters, t-shirts, and other merchandise. The slugger was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in 2000, as he wished to play closer to home and be more involved in the lives of his children. Griffey’s numbers declined following the trade, but petitions were signed by Seattle fans to bring him back. Finally, in 2009, Griffey returned to the Mariners. His second tenure had its issues, like Griffey being accused of napping in the clubhouse during games, but he was honoured into the team’s Hall of Fame in August 2013.\n\nMichael Jordan – Chicago Bulls (NBA)\n\nAfter winning three straight NBA titles in the early 90’s, there was nothing left for Michael Jordan to accomplish. When his father was murdered that summer, Jordan retired from basketball and decided to try his hand at professional baseball, hoping to realize his father’s dream of him playing in the Majors. When his baseball dream fizzled out, it was back to the hard court and the Bulls for Jordan. Another three NBA Championships followed before Jordan left the game again in 1999. His last return to basketball was with the Washington Wizards, a team he had part-ownership with and had been President of Basketball Operations.\n\nMario Lemieux – Pittsburgh Penguins (NHL)\n\nLike Jordan, Mario Lemieux kept returning to the game he loved after time away from the rink proved he still had too much passion for the sport to watch from the sidelines. Super Mario returned from cancer and a retirement to put up all-star level numbers and pad his legacy as one of the game’s greatest players. While he never won another Stanley Cup, he was an integral member of Canada’s gold medal victory at the 2002 Winter Olympics and also saved the Pittsburgh Penguins franchise as owner of the team, ushering in the Sidney Crosby era.\n\nDrink #253: Homeward Bound\n\n1.5 oz Spiced Rum (I used Sailor Jerry’s)\n\nTop with Lemonade\n\nGarnish with Lemon Wheel\n\nWhat was your favourite return home? As above, it can be an athlete, an actor, or hell, it could be Ron Jeremy’s long-awaited return to the world of pornography!\n\nSip Advisor Bar Notes (3.5 Sips out of 5):\n\nThis was a simple, but very enjoyable cocktail. I love the name about as much as I adore Sailor Jerry’s Spiced Rum and the moment I saw this recipe advertised at a local bar, I knew I’d be making it when I went home. The caramel-flavour of the Spiced Rum works nicely with the tart Lemonade and makes for one fine drink!"
