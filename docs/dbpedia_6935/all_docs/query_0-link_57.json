        "text": "My favorite summer as a hockey fan was and remains the summer of 1967, when the NHL doubled in size. Six new teams joined the league, meaning dozens of new players to follow. Sure wish the Expansion Draft on June 6, 1967, had been televised, and could today be enjoyed on YouTube. There were 120 players selected during the draft. Seemingly the expansion teams benefited at least as much - if not more - from the wheeling and dealing which went on while the draft proceded, than from the draft itself.\n\nDuring the sixth round of the draft, the St. Louis Blues selected defenseman Rod Seiling from the New York Rangers, who had protected blueliners Harry Howell, Larry Hillman, Jim Neilson and Arnie Brown. Rangers' GM Emile Francis then traded four players - Tim Ecclestone, Gary Sabourin, Bob Plager and Gord Kannegiesser - to the Blues for Seiling. Three of those four players would make a significant contribution to the franchise in St. Louis.\n\nI've never really looked at it that closely but here is the draft order and selections.\n\n1967 NHL Expansion Draft Picks at hockeydb.com\n\nA sortable list of players drafted in the 1967 NHL Expansion draft, including their career scoring after being drafted\n\nthis is a good resource as well\n\nAlso if these boards had been around then and for the WHA it would have been really exciting to look back on the posts about it.\n\nI've never really looked at it that closely but here is the draft order and selections.\n\n1967 NHL Expansion Draft Picks at hockeydb.com\n\nA sortable list of players drafted in the 1967 NHL Expansion draft, including their career scoring after being drafted\n\nthis is a good resource as well\n\nAlso if these boards had been around then and for the WHA it would have been really exciting to look back on the posts about it.\n\nI'm hoping to use this thread to look closely at the goings-on surrounding the first expansion. The more I find out, the more fascinating it becomes for me. Love to get my hands on The Hockey News from 1967, and especially the issue(s) dealing with the draft.\n\nFunny how the sharks played at the cow place 25 years later.\n\nI'm hoping to use this thread to look closely at the goings-on surrounding the first expansion. The more I find out, the more fascinating it becomes for me. Love to get my hands on The Hockey News from 1967, and especially the issue(s) dealing with the draft.\n\nDid hockey news put it all online yet?\n\nHope there is proper appreciation of James Norris Jr. by fans of the St. Louis Blues. One of the six expansion teams in 1967 was established in St. Louis at the insistance of Norris. He - majority owner of the Chicago Black Hawks - gave his fellow owners of the six then operating NHL teams a choice: (A) place a team in St. Louis, and have the owners of that expansion team purchase the St. Louis Arena (which had been the home of the first NHL team in St. Louis, and was owned by the Norris family); or (B) there would be no expansion. There had to be unanimous consensus for expansion to proceed. Plan A was chosen.\n\nNorris was also the main obstacle to a team being placed in Buffalo - who did not consider that city to be big league, in terms of sports. His death in 1966, and the efforts by the Knox brothers - after that first expansion - to demonstrate that Buffalo was a hockey town resulted in the Sabres arriving with the second expansion in 1970."
