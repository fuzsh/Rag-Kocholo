The St. Louis Blues are a professional ice hockey team in St. Louis, Missouri. The team is named after the famous W. C. Handy song "Saint Louis Blues." The franchise was founded in 1967 as an expansion team during the league's 1967 NHL Expansion, which expanded the team from six teams to twelve. The team's first owners were insurance tycoon Sid Salomon Jr., his son, Sid Salomon III, and Robert L. Wolfson, who were granted the franchise in 1966. Sid Salomon III convinced his initially wary father to make a bid for the team.

The Blues were originally coached by Lynn Patrick, who resigned in late November after recording a 4-13-2 record. He was replaced by assistant coach Scotty Bowman, who thereafter led the team to a winning record for the rest of the season.

The Blues were the oldest active-NHL team never to have won the Stanley Cup, although they played in the Stanley Cup Finals three times in 1968, 1969 and 1970. But in 2019 they found themselves in a rematch 49 years in the making with the Boston Bruins, and finally brought Lord Stanley's Cup home to Saint Louis.
