The qualifications include spending on research and development (if the firm spends 15% of its revenue on R&D), the caliber of the founding members (if half of the founding team possess a doctorate or higher), and intellectual property (if the company obtains an invention patent or a nationally or internationally registered program).

The final requirement is to present a prototype. According to the press release, the applicant for the label must “present at least one prototype of the submitted innovation,” which can “take several forms, such as an electronic platform in final or demo version, a prototype of the product if it is industrialized, a link to the application of the company concerned, or an illustrative video.”
