        "text": "Agricultural structure\n\nIn 2022, the Algerian olive-growing area will exceed 440,000 ha, representing an estimated 34% increase between 2012 and 2022.\n\nThe average farm covers 2.81 hectares, with 230 trees producing 221 quintals of fruit.\n\nOf the 6 million olive trees in the Algerian orchard, over 5 million are in production, with a yield of 23 kg per tree. An expansion program is currently underway. It includes the creation of intensive olive groves and an increase in irrigated area. This project will almost double the size of the orchard, reaching 900,000 hectares under cultivation in Algeria by 2024.\n\nHistorically, olive growing has been highly concentrated in Kabylia and the north of the country. However, the project plans to extend this cultivation to other Algerian regions.\n\nAlgeria's food self-sufficiency policies are taking advantage of the opportunity to grow olive trees.\n\nThe famous cru de Tablazt in the Haute Soummam region, which won a medal at the 1910 Brussels World's Fair, the bitter Kabylie olive oils from the forest edges of the Bibans, the jade-green oils from the Illoula foothills, the heavy olive oils from Haute Kabylie with their fleeting aromas of pine and oak, the orange-pink oils from Seddouk, the golden-brown oils from the Babors coastline.\n\nLong considered the best, olive oil from the orchards of Kabylie seems to be being dethroned by that of Jijel, with the Nutris company and its new olive oil factory, and even that of Sig with its specific variety, the sigoise, processed for decades by companies such as Sarl BHS - les Ravissantes.\n\nA study** carried out by the consultancy firm PWC and Immar-Maghreb for PASA (Pôle Soummam en Algérie - 2022) reveals that:\n\n99% of those surveyed also consume other vegetable oils (rapeseed, soya, etc.).\n\n41% of Algerians consume olive oil\n\n66% for its health benefits\n\n38% for taste\n\n35 % out of habit\n\n28 % for beauty reasons\n\nThe price reaches 705 DA/l in Kabylie, but 813 DA/l in other regions of Algeria.\n\n74% of customers buy olive oil through parallel channels\n\n37% self-consumption\n\n23% by donation (solidarity economy)\n\nThe production margin is reduced to 40%.\n\n86% of customers believe that the oil they consume is of good quality, taste and smell.\n\nHowever, 90% of the diaspora would like glass packaging, even if it means paying a little more, while Algerian consumers feel that the price is already too high and should be lowered.\n\nThe secret: quality olive oil\n\nTo stand out from the competition, you need to produce top-quality oil, free from defects. Algerian producers have understood this. They have banished ancestral methods to improve productivity, hygiene and quality.\n\nChemical composition, degree of acidity, taste, color. All these criteria can be used to determine exactly what makes a good olive oil. But for Algerian consumers, the country produces some of the best olive oil in the world.\n\nOrganic olive oil won a gold medal at the 2023 International Organic Olive Oil Competition in Geneva, Switzerland. This latest accolade comes on top of all the medals it has won in recent years in Tokyo (Japan), Berlin (Germany), Italy, Oslo (Norway) and twice in Dubai.\n\nThe Dahbia brand targets the organic market, with olives harvested in the morning and crushed in the afternoon.\n\nA study** carried out by the consultancy firm PWC and Immar-Maghreb shows that opinions on labeling differ between the diaspora and nationals:\n\n69% opted to indicate the region where the fruit was harvested, while others (64%) chose the region of production or quality.\n\nAmong residents surveyed, 57% are content to use a label indicating quality and region of crushing.\n\nAlgerian olive oil exports are booming. According to data from the Ministry of Trade, in 2021 these exports involved 600,000 liters mobilized by 78 operators to 19 countries, representing a value of US$2 million. By 2024, the target is US$5 million."
