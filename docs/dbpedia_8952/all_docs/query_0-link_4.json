        "text": "In March 2011, the Algerian Ministry of Commerce published a note to all importers reminding them of the obligation to present proof of conformity of the products to be imported by means of a certificate of conformity or quality certificate for all exports to the country, to ensure that they meet the relevant legal and regulatory requirements that apply to them. This obligation is imposed by the Law 09-03 of 25/02/2009 relating to the protection of consumers and the prevention of fraud and by the Decree 05-467 of 12/12/2005, on the conditions and procedures for checking the conformity of imported goods at customs. The required Certificate of Conformity may also be referred to as the \"Certificat de contrôle de qualité\". This document must certify that the goods are in compliance with the regulations and technical standards of the country. The original copy of the certificate of conformity is required for each shipment and should be issued in the exporting country. This is a mandatory document. These provisions first of all establish that the mandatory label must be firmly attached to the packaging or printed on it. The indications (name under which the product is distributed, references of the manufacturer, of the importer, indication of the net content expressed in metric international units, methods of use of any precautions), must be reported clearly, legibly and using indelible ink. For the import of food, it is provided that if the volume or weight is less than 5 liters or 5 kg, any material for transport can be used except glass or transparent plastic that have the shape of bottles or jars. A note was published on the Algerian Ministry of Commerce website (March 2012) referring to the data of the importer indicated on the labels and packaging of goods destined for Algeria. This note became necessary after numerous shipments were found, and consequently blocked, in which the labels on the packaging reported incorrect data of the importer (name and address). These checks were carried out by the Quality and Fraud Control Service active on the Algerian border under the authority of the Ministry of Commerce. Therefore, starting from 1 July 2011, all shipments that do not report the correct data are blocked and rejected by Algerian customs, without the possibility of derogation. Consequently, exporters must ensure that they obtain the exact identity and relative references of the importer, and that the same data is indicated on the markings of the products being shipped, avoiding over-labeling, double labeling, company names and different addresses. Product packaging regulation is also present in product labeling legislation. With reference to the authorized languages ​​relating to packaging and labeling, it is specified that all products sold at retail on the Algerian market must be accompanied by an information brochure in Arabic. Please note that all food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products must be \"halal\", that is, in compliance with the precepts of the Muslim religion, and it is recommended that you obtain this certificate before exporting.\n\nNote the following:\n\nThis website and the information contained therein have been developed and provided by the Studio Legale de Capoa for information purposes only.This website is not intended to be, and does not replace, legal assistance.
