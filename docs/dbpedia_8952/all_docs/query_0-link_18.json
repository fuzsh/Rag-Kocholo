        "text": "Hello everyone in Algeria,\n\nI’m writing this on behalf of OSM’s Data Working Group. A question has been asked recently about the use of “name” tags within various areas within Algeria, and I was asked to raise this in this forum. The problem is that in some places in Algeria, the “name” tag has swapped between French, Arabic and combinations such as “French then Arabic” and “Arabic then French” over the years.\n\nAs this document describes:\n\nhttp://wiki.osmfoundation.org/w/images/d/d8/DisputedTerritoriesInformation.pdf\n\nOpenStreetMap tries to follow the “On The Ground” rule - if the majority of people in an area refer to it as “Name A” instead of “Name B”, then the name within OSM should be “Name A” (though of course other language names can co-exist, and all communities are free to make their own maps from OSM data using name:ar, name:ber, name:fr or another name).\n\nThere’s no need for the “name” tag to have the same language across a country. To take an example closer to where I live, in a predominantly Welsh-speaking part of Wales the “name” of http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/24433881 is the same as the Welsh name (name:cy), whereas in a predominantly English-speaking part, the name of http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/4801016 is the same as the “name:en”. Of course, communities worldwide can decide to do something different - for example, the Belgian community decided to use both languages in the “name” field of http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2404021 (though that’s quite rare and can be confusing for those that do not know what is happening).\n\nWhat the Data Working Group would like to encourage would be for people to record all the names for a place that are in use, including where relevant Arabic (name:ar), Berber (name:ber), French (name:fr) and any others that might apply. This is in addition to whatever is chosen as for the “name” tag. Having all names recorded means that maps that can show multiple languages (of which http://mlm.jochentopf.com/ is a proof-of-concept example) can show the correct language when someone switches to that language.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAndy Townsend (SomeoneElse), on behalf of OpenStreetMap’s Data Working Group.\n\nGoogle translate to French: https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&tl=fr&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.openstreetmap.org%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fpid%3D506642%23p506642&edit-text=, Arabic: https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=en&tl=ar&u=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.openstreetmap.org%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fpid%3D506642%23p506642\n\nHi guys, and thanks for this discussion\n\nI always thought that one should use the country’s official language for the name tag, and the other name tags for any eventual translations, would be better especially for mobile application users because so many names displayed on a small screen would really look very ugly, but that’s just my opinion. If OpenStreetMap’s Data Working Group decides to use multiple names standard, then I will be using that as well even though I really don’t completely agree with it.\n\nI understand that using Arabic names can be tedious for a lot of contributors, but I also really wish that my country’s official language would appear on its map. I’m doing all I can to accomplish that, but I can’t do much because of my crappy internet.\n\nHi,\n\nI was invited in the conversation, in fact I’m editing Waze map most of the time, and ocasionally OSM too as I find that it is complementary.\n\nAs I don’t know arabic, I edited everything in french in the beginning.\n\nThen I asked the local community about what they like, and finally I started to rename cities with the french name and the arabic name (Waze doesn’t support localization for map elements).\n\nIn fact there are not 2 but 3 languages at least in algeria:\n\nThe algerian arabic that most algerian speaks. It is not official arabic, people can speak algerian arabic and not understand the official arabic.\n\nFrom what I know is that most people speak that algerian arabic everyday.\n\nOld people who went to school before independency can read and write french, but most of the time are unable to read or write arabic.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia 11 million people older than 5 year understand french. It is a lot but not everybody.\n\nThe school is now in arabic so young people can read and write arabic, but university is in french, so educated people unsually speaks french.\n\nAfter that I don’t know the community of editors of OSM in algeria, but are they able to write arabic ? If not, what is the solution ?\n\nFrom my experience on Waze, only very few local editors are active, and 90% are working in French (maybe because I created the map in french in the beginning I don’t know).\n\nAnd in the update requests from end users, 90% are also in french.\n\nAnother thing, I don’t know very well the east of the country but it seems arabic is less important there, for a lot of cities you even don’t find the arabic name on Wikipedia.\n\nHi again\n\nI also just noticed that if you download Tunis’s offline map on Android OSMand app, you can see that if you use only Arabic on a map, it displays correctly, but if you use a combination of French and Arabic, the Arabic part shows those ugly rectangles.\n\nSee for yourselves :\n\nIf it was for me, I will only use Arabic in *name *tag, French in name:fr and I will even make an effort to add name:ber even if I really don’t speak Berberian. If only I have a decent internet …\n\nEast or west, they’re all the same. The lack of Arabic translations in Wikipedia does not reflect our interest to our language, it simply reflects our disinterest to online voluntary contributions (and that because of a lot of other reasons), if I may say.\n\nOur dialect is a mixture of Arabic and French, and I can guaranty that 99% of educated people (not to brag, but me being one of them in an educative environment) you are talking about can perfectly understand Arabic as well as French.\n\nCordially.\n\nI have to admit, one thing that surprised me when I looked at the map in Algeria was the lack of “name:fr” in some places where the “name” is in French - having it also in name:fr would make it easier for multilingual maps to recognise the language of the “name” tag (this was based by having a look at nodes with various tags using Overpass in part of Algeria - http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/9V4 - change the\n\nnode[\"name:fr\"]({{bbox}});\n\npart of the query to “name:ar” or “name:ber” to see other languages).\n\nUnfortunately the layers available on the openstreetmap.org front page don’t easily allow the selection of map tiles showing different languages, though it is possible to create your own using something like the instructions at https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-14-04/ and then use a bit of browser trickery to insert those tiles in place of one of the layers on osm.org - http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:SomeoneElse/Your_tiles_from_osm.org).\n\nA number of different OSM regions have created maps “in their own style” and their own language - if you look at the map at openstreetmap.de for example you’ll see German names for places in central Europe that have many names in different languages. If anyone would like to try and render Algerian map tiles showing name:ar, name:ber or name:fr locally it should be possible on a regular PC, since Algeria doesn’t have a huge amount of data in it in OSM, though obviously hosting that somewhere that other people can see it would involve some ongoing expense. If anyone wants to try and set up a tile server for a particular language please ask (either me directly, or on help.openstreetmap.org, or on IRC http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IRC).\n\nHi,\n\nSomeoneElse was writing to us on behalf of OSM’s Data Working Group and not on behalf of the Algerian Government that never opened data to public. SomeoneElse noticed that there is a problem in the algerian OSM Map.\n\nLink : http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/FR:Data_working_group\n\nNow, I have to replay to our friend abdeldjalil : I’m against all the double names separated by a “-” in the tag “name:” but I’m okay to submit a request to the OSM Working Data Group to study this case.\n\nLast time I was reading something about ISO2 and ISO3 concerning “naming”, sorting and filtering.\n\nAbdeldjalil, I contribute to name the places that I know more in arabic, don’t worry I’m even okay to write the name of all the villages and POI’s in japanese, this is not a problem.\n\nI think that it’s okay to name some places in arabic using the generic tag “name:” but other places and POI’s doesn’t actually have an “arabic” name but can be only transliterated into arabic.\n\nNow, I have to add something that may be seem “bizarre” but, if one day, we have to push the OSM algerian map to be adopted as an OpenGov plateform (leaf) I’m sorry to say that everything must be written in arabic … and here I agree with you.\n\nYes I contribute in arabic using “name:ar” but everywhere else I use latin … may some OSM Contributors add “name:ar” to all the POI’s we’ve created before :\n\nThis is a “Kabyle” land and the name of every village is written in latin in the real world but I added “name:ar” may be “someone else” will take benefit of the arabic tagging. Why not ? I’m not against.\n\nThis Kabyle area has a “name:ar” and no “name:ber”\n\nBut I’m against naming like this : “الطاهير - Taher” or even more “الطاهير Taher” or tri-naming in arabic-dash-french-dash-berber.\n\nBecause if we consider OSM as a big database then name:fr=Taher is corresponding to name:ar=الطاهير and never a “mix-humburger” of names is corresponding to a single name written in an ISO standardized language.\n\nTo avoid what we call “War Map Edits”, I was asking … So what’s the solution ?\n\nan ar.openstreetmap.org like Wiki is doing ? Will you name all the chinese villages in arabic ?\n\nA Leaf server hosted is Algeria ? A good Idea (the best) but who is gonna host it ? Algeria Telecom ? Not even in your dreams ! None is supporting the movement of Free Open Source Software here !\n\nYes I have already read this : http://blog.jochentopf.com/2012-06-24-choosing-a-language.html\n\nEdit August 27th, 2015 :\n\nSignalisation routière bilingue (wiki fr) : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalisation_routi%C3%A8re_bilingue\n\nBilingual sign (wiki en) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilingual_sign\n\nJochen Topf\n\nI think, latin alphabet should be a fallback and the user must be free to render/filter/sort using a name:iso if he wants since there still a problem in displaying a “mixed lang. name” in some plateformes such as Android (square caracters).\n\nIn the future, to propote berber language over all the territories of Algeria, the administration will show the locations in tri lingual names. Do you imagine the length of “name:” tag ?\n\nThere will be even War Edits to have “name:” first name in arabic, then berber, then fr. Other contributor will come to revert them to : Berber, Arabic, then french. So the problem is not yet solved.\n\nHave a nice day … and fun on OSM\n\nSalutations amicales."
