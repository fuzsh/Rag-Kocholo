We were looking for a press able to print high quality labels with short set-up times and waste and Gidue provided us exactly what we were looking for.’\n\nNuova Gidue distributor Saverio Monopoli commented: ‘Since its launch, the MX press has demonstrated itself as a top entry level press, that provides high quality results and that no needs great investment in terms of price. It is a press dedicated to the production of labels and, thanks to its short web-path, it minimizes the set-up waste while high precision drive-belts guarantee a perfect printing register over time. The press requires no maintenance, no operator intervention and no specific greasing’.\n\nCristina Toffolo, Nuova Gidue's vice-president of marketing, concluded: ‘We are proud to have Concept Emballage in our clients portfolio and we hope to build a long-term relationship based on customer satisfaction and mutual growth in the packaging industry’."
