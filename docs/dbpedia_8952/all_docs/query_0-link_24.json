        "text": "The Algerian Ministry of Commerce published a note in March 2011 to all importers reminding them of the obligation to submit proof of conformity by way of a certificate of conformity or certificate of quality for all exports to Algeria; this is to ensure that they meet legal and regulatory requirements that affect them.\n\nThis obligation is enforced by law 09-03, dated 25/02/2009, and decree 05-467 dated 12/12/2005, on conditions and procedures of conformity control of imported goods at customs.\n\nIntertek can help exporters to Algeria comply with this notice by offering inspection services to obtain the necessary Certificate of Conformity.\n\nThe required Certificate of Conformity can also be referred as the “Certificat de contrôle de qualité”. The original copy of the Certificate of Conformity is needed for every shipment and should be issued in the country of export. It is a mandatory document for Algerian Customs clearance.\n\nHow To Arrange An Inspection\n\nFirstly, contact your local Intertek office, details can be found within the contact us section of the site.\n\nOne of our export consultants will go through the inspection requirements with you and supply you on the same day with a quote for the work with details of our terms and conditions.\n\nYou will then need to supply us with your export documents: these may include a Certificate of Origin, Test Reports (if applicable), Letters of Credit, and the packing list.\n\nUpon receipt, we will arrange a mutually convenient date, time, and location for the inspection to be carried out.\n\nYour Certificate of Conformity will then be issued within a maximum of 24 hours of the inspection if the results are satisfactory."
