        "text": "Gallus Group, a subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HEIDELBERG), today announces that specialty print company Eurl Imprimerie La Tulipe has broadened its capabilities with the acquisition of a Gallus Labelmaster 440. Marking the company’s first foray into the world of flexographic printing, the investment represents a step change in terms of business growth and market opportunity, bolstering and diversifying its existing portfolio of HEIDELBERG offset machines. Installed at the company’s headquarters in Sidi Bel Abbès, Algeria, the new Gallus Labelmaster will now enable Imprimerie La Tulipe to print on a wider range of substrates with best-in-class print quality – expanding its customer base and opening up new, profitable business development.\n\nThe strategic investment in Gallus’ Labelmaster technology is a key milestone in Imprimerie La Tulipe’s growth plan, and its commitment to delivering market-leading industrial packaging solutions for the pharmaceutical, agri-food and personal hygiene sectors. The wide-ranging capabilities of the Gallus installation has significantly strengthened the company’s offering to the Algerian labels market and equips the business to continue its advancement towards not just addressing shortages in niche packaging solutions across the Algerian market, but in leading these commercial print and packaging spaces country-wide.\n\nRenowned for its unrivalled price-performance ratio, the Gallus Labelmaster series also brings the company superior print speeds of up to 200 meters per minute with unrivalled accuracy – driving productivity for Imprimerie La Tulipe and improving margins. The company’s new press setup includes eight flexographic printing stations, a cold foil unit and rotary die-cutter, as well as the ability to backside print on glue. Importantly, however, based on Gallus’ trademark modular system, the installation also provides the company with the ultimate flexibility to add, switch or remove units as needed into the future, delivering a critical level of responsiveness to adapt to business and market changes – ever important in today’s challenging industrial and economic landscape.\n\nEstablished as a subsidiary of heritage print provider, Dib Printing, in order to specialize in reaching specific, niche corners of the print market, Imprimerie La Tulipe benefits from its rich, longstanding history in traditional printing technologies, as well as the expertise of its founder, Amine Dib, in hybrid and digital solutions. According to Dib, it was the team’s prior experience with HEIDELBERG, and its confidence in Gallus and HEIDELBERG’s combined expertise, that played a crucial role in the investment decision. “Together with our parent company, we have almost a half-century’s experience working with HEIDELBERG, achieving significant growth and success with its machines over the years,” he explains. “When it came to diversifying our portfolio and venturing into flexo, this made the decision very easy – there was simply no other label manufacturer we’d trust more than Gallus.”\n\nWith its unrivalled expertise in the label sector, complemented by HEIDELBERG’s global support network, Gallus provided a seamless installation for Imprimerie La Tulipe. Installed in the summer of 2023, the new Gallus Labelmaster 440 was up and running and at full capacity within a matter of weeks, and now serves as a core part of their day-to-day business processes.\n\n“Being new to flexo technology, it was critical for us to choose a press that both integrated well with our current operations and was relatively quick and easy for our team to learn,” adds Dib. “The expert training and support provided by Gallus – as well as the intuitive HMI touch operation – not only guaranteed us a smooth transition into this new area but meant that we saw almost immediate results.”\n\nIdeally positioned to unlock a smooth and profitable entry into the label segment, the Gallus Labelmaster 440 boasts a range of innovative performance features. It includes high levels of automation and cloud integration, enabling remote access and diagnostics – ultimately, equipping print providers with the tools to be future-ready, today.\n\n“As ever, we’re delighted to be able to share our knowledge, insights and, importantly, our market-leading solutions with print houses such as Imprimerie La Tulipe. They are a great business, and one who shares our commitment to growth, innovation and evolution,” concludes Dario Urbinati, CEO, Gallus Group.\n\n\"Whilst we see the presence of digital technologies growing across the current landscape, the flexo market also continues to thrive. Investments such as this one are a key example of that – and a testament to its enduring potential. Here at Gallus, we are passionate about building a smart, connected printing industry in which conventional and digital machines interplay seamlessly. Flexo remains a core technology, delivering countless benefits and opportunities for businesses worldwide, complemented by the flexibility and adaptability of new, digital solutions. We eagerly anticipate supporting Imprimerie La Tulipe on this transformative journey and witnessing the positive impact the Gallus Labelmaster 440 will bring to the business and its customers.\""
