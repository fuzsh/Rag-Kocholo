Our experienced immigration professionals partner with businesses of all sizes to develop immigration strategies that can help you achieve your goals.\n\nAlgeria’s immigration system provides limited options for employers of foreign nationals​. While business visitors may obtain a Business Visa to stay in Algeria for up to 90 days, they are advised to limit their stay to 15 days. Foreign nationals whose stay exceeds 90 days require a Residence Permit.\n\nThere are two main work authorization types: Annex 13 Declaration (valid for 15 days with permissible extensions for a maximum stay of 90 days over a 12-month period); and Work Permit (valid for one year, with permissible extensions). Both types of permits are processed locally and each province (wilaya) may apply its own interpretation of the requirements.\n\nFragomen can also consult on citizenship matters and, as permitted within the confines of local law, may be able to offer citizenship assistance."
