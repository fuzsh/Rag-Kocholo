        "text": "Health and Vaccinations\n\nThere are no mandatory immunisations for travellers to Algeria though you should be up-to-date with Typhoid, Tetanus, Polio and Hepatitis A. Malaria is present in some parts of Algeria so we recommend you seek advice from your local GP or travel centre as to the correct immunisations and preventative treatments.\n\nCurrency\n\nIn Algeria the official unit of currency is the Dinar.\n\nTo check out the latest exchange rate for the places that you are visiting you can go to www.oanda.com.\n\nCultural Sensitivity\n\nOn our tours you will frequently interact with local people, each with their own distinct customs and traditions. We therefore ask you to be considerate and to treat them with respect. Your tour-leaders and guides will always be able to advise you accordingly.\n\nIn mosques and conservative areas in the south of Algeria, women may be expected to cover their arms, legs and heads and men should abstain from wearing shorts at all times.\n\nLanguage & Religion\n\nIn Algeria, Arabic is the official language and Berber is also considered a nationally recognised language. French is also widely spoken although it holds no official status.\n\nMost Algerians adhere to the Sunni branch of Islam and in addition there is a small Christian minority.\n\nTime\n\nAlgeria is 1 hour ahead of GMT.\n\nA useful website to check the time zone differences is www.worldtimezone.com.\n\nFood and drink\n\nWhilst Algerian cuisine is not as diverse as neighbouring Morocco, you can still expect to find tasty soups, freshly baked bread, tagines and couscous in places.\n\nAlcohol is not widely available throughout Algeria except in the larger cities in the north. Local Algerian wine is available in places and rated as being pretty good! It is permitted to bring alcohol into the county, but you should be very discreet about when and where you consume it.\n\nTravelling Solo In Algeria"
