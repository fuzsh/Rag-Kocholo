        "text": "DVD Releases for April 22, 2008\n\nApril 21st, 2008\n\nIt's a slow week by nearly every measure: big releases, overall quality, overall quantity, spotlight reviews, etc. This is great news for me since recently a package arrived with several DVDs, all of which were late. I'm not quite completely caught up, but I am very close. As for this week's releases, there were only a handful of releases that were even in contention for DVD Pick of the Week. Both The Savages - DVD and The Orphanage - DVD or Blu-ray earned excellent reviews, but their home market releases were only average. Cloverfield - DVD wasn't as good a movie, but the DVD had the best combination of movie quality and special features. The specter of a Blu-ray release notwithstanding, it is the DVD Pick of the Week. More...\n\nStarting Out on Top of the Per Theater Chart\n\nNovember 27th, 2007\n\nStarting Out in the Evening earned first place on the per theater chart with and average of $10,888 in seven theaters. This should be enough for it to expand over the holidays, but probably not enough to get noticed during award season. Margot at the Wedding was in second place with and average of $10,767 after increasing its theater count to 35. Finally, the re-re-re-release of The Polar Express added just over $150,000 in 15 theaters for an average of $10,024 and a total of $338,000 during its latest round in theaters. More...\n\nMovie Website Reviews for Weekend of November 23, 2007\n\nNovember 24th, 2007\n\nThere are not a whole lot of movies on this week's list, but at least we had a race for top spot with both This Christmas - Official Site and Enchanted - Official Site. Both had their strong points, but in the end Enchanted was able to take home the crown. More...\n\nFilling Up on Smaller Films\n\nNovember 22nd, 2007\n\nAward season should be heating up, but you couldn't really tell by the limited releases this week. I'm Not There looks promising, but there are too many question marks regarding its Oscar and box office chances. Starting Out in the Evening is the only other release with Oscar potential, but it will need to make a box office splash for voters to take notice. More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - November 18, 2007\n\nNovember 18th, 2007\n\nThis week's round of new movie release information contains release dates for Eagle Eye, Dragon Ball Z, Angels & Demons and more! More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - October 7, 2007\n\nOctober 7th, 2007\n\nThis week's round of new movie release information contains release dates for Case 39, Inkheart, Four Christmases and more! More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for September 16 - September 22, 2007\n\nSeptember 22nd, 2007\n\nNot a long list this week, but at least we had a clear winner for the Weekly Website Award, Resident Evil: Extinction - Official Site. IN the coming weeks we should see some big sites launch as award season starts to heat up. More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - July 22, 2007\n\nJuly 21st, 2007\n\nThis week's round of new movie release information contains release dates for Big Stan, Valkyrie, Monsters vs. Aliens and more.
