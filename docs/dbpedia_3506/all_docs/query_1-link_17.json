        "text": "Touches of magic realism indicate we are in an ideal world where love will, if not conquer everything, then pretty much hug it into submission.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Jun 14, 2008\n\nA lightweight and sentimental exercise that succeeds at little except maybe inspiring the viewer to go out and find a decent curry.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/4 | Dec 7, 2007\n\nThis movie's heart is in the right place, which is one way of saying it's terrible.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/4 | Nov 30, 2007\n\nA cloying blend of Bollywood sentiment and Amlie whimsy, Nina's Heavenly Delights is a lesbian-foodie fairy tale that keeps its appetites well under control.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/5 | Nov 30, 2007\n\nIt's ironic how a film whose outcome depends on the difference between technical perfection and perceived, artistic greatness, would itself prove a slave to shallow screenplay mechanics deprived of nuance.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/4 | Nov 25, 2007\n\nYou know a cross-cultural, gender-bending dramedy has issues, when its most memorable moment is a blasphemous, bouncy Bollywood musical finale featuring a female impersonator.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/4 | Nov 25, 2007\n\nParmar scores pleasant performances across the board...Yet the story is bland, like it's been over-workshopped in a screenwriting class, too polite and too smooth around the edges.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Nov 24, 2007\n\nThe novelty value of an east meets west cultural dynamic isn't enough to disguise how late Nina's Heavenly Delights is to the celluloid coming out party.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Nov 20, 2007"
