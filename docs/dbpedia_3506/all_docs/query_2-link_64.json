She falls in love with a lawyer (Patrick Dempsey). With James Marsden and Timothy Spall; the erstwhile Disney animator Kevin Lima directs.\n\n\"HITMAN\"From the beloved classic video game. Timothy Olyphant is the rogue Agent 47, on the run across Eastern Europe as he tries to outwit both Interpol and Russian military intelligence. Xavier Gens directs.\n\n\"I'M NOT THERE\" At each stage of his life, Bob Dylan is played by a different actor (Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw) — a highly original device that dates back at least to Sacha Guitry's 1937 \"Pearls of the Crown.\" Todd Haynes directed; with Julianne Moore, Michelle Williams, Bruce Greenwood, David Cross and Charlotte Gainsbourg.\n\n\"THE MIST\" Frank Darabont's first feature since \"The Majestic\" (2001) sounds a little less inspirational than his \"Shawshank Redemption\" and \"Green Mile,\" though it is also based on a Stephen King novella. Thomas Jane plays the leader of an embattled group of small-town citizens fighting for their lives against mysterious creatures that have arrived in a mysterious storm.\n\n\"THIS CHRISTMAS\" Preston A.

The impish French actor Mathieu Amalric plays Bauby; with Emmanuelle Seigner, Marie-Josée Croze and, in one of his last roles, Jean-Pierre Cassel.\n\n\"FLAWLESS\" Sounds like a good old-fashioned heist picture, with a janitor (Michael Caine) teaming up with a midlevel executive (Demi Moore) for a raid on their mutual employer, the London Diamond Corporation. Directed by Michael Radford (\"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\" \"Il Postino\").\n\n\"OSWALD'S GHOST\" Robert Stone's documentary looks at the consequences of the Kennedy assassination in terms of the growing paranoia of American politics. Among the interviewed: Norman Mailer, Gary Hart, Tom Hayden, Mark Lane and Edward Jay Epstein.\n\n\"PROTAGONIST\" Inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, the filmmaker Jessica Yu follows four individuals through all-consuming quests: a German ex-terrorist, an evangelist who has turned from his gay past, a bank robber and a student of the martial arts.\n\n\"TEETH\" A high school girl who campaigns for chastity discovers she possesses a vagina dentate.

This one emanates from a Tudor cottage surrounded by disturbingly pink snow and features Jared Padalecki as the artist himself. With Peter O'Toole and Marcia Gay Harden; directed by Michael Campus (evidently the same Michael Campus who directed the 1973 blaxploitation classic \"The Mack\")."
