        "text": "Kerry Weeks\n\nHere's my story. I'm nine years old-- first time going to summer camp. And my grandfather gives me-- before I go, he gives me his old pocket knife. It's practically an antique. And so the first thing all of us boys do when we get to camp is we pull out our knives and we start throwing them at things, trying to get them to stick the way Daniel Boone did. And because it's the 1970s, there's nothing unusual about a bunch of young children throwing sharp knives around.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nAnd I got mine to stick in the floorboard. It was like, \"wong.\" And it was great. But when I pulled it out, the tip broke off.\n\nBut anyway, camp goes on. And a few days later, I notice my knife is missing. And I look everywhere for it. I look high, I look low. It's gone.\n\nBut then one day, I'm walking through camp and I see this group of boys throwing knives at a tree and something tells me I should check this out. And sure enough, there's this boy in there throwing my knife. Now, there's no mistaking this knife because the handle was red and green, but the colors met in the middle and kind of swirled together in a trippy, psychedelic way. And I've never seen a knife like that before or since.\n\nSo I walk up to this boy. He's a little older, but I walk up to him and I say, hey, that's my knife. And he says, no, it's mine. And I say, no, that's my knife. My grandfather gave it to me. And he says, no, he didn't.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nHe says, my grandfather gave it to me. And I'm confused all of a sudden. Maybe I should have thought this through a bit more. I thought he would just hand it over. And the other boys-- they move in close. And I'm thinking, could it be possible that his grandfather gave him the exact same knife that my grandfather gave me? Is this a thing and I just didn't know it?\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBut I look at the knife he's holding in his hand and I look at the blade and I see that the tip of the blade is squared off, as though it were broken. And I say, that's my knife because I broke the tip off when I stuck it in the floor. And he says, what, that? No, it came that way so you can use it like a screwdriver.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nAnd I look at the other boys and I'm not getting any help from them. And so I wander off, just thinking to myself, screwdriver. I never thought of that.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nWell, as you can imagine, this really bugged me. And I don't mean just while I was at camp, but for the rest of my life.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nAnd I kept thinking, why did I fold so easily? Why didn't I go to the counselors? And the only thing I can think of is this.\n\nI'm the son of a physicist. And I used to ask my dad these questions all the time like, Dad, how far away is the sun? Dad, how fast is the speed of light? Dad, what's the closest star? And he would give me these answers and these numbers that were just so [BEEP] huge, I couldn't get my mind around them.\n\nSo my point is this. I, better than most other children, had an idea of just how vast the universe is.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nAnd therefore, how infinite the possibilities are. So the thing is, at the time, I thought, well, maybe the kid's telling the truth. The only reason why I bring this up is because this is what I was thinking of when, some 32 years later, I become the landlord of a small apartment building. And one of the first things I did as a landlord was I threw this guy out because he was a small time drug dealer.\n\nOn the day he's moving out, I get a call from his neighbor across the hall-- a guy I call Budweiser Bob. And Budweiser Bob says, hey, that druggie is stealing your refrigerator.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nAnd so I hop down there. And sure enough, in the driveway is a pickup truck. And in the back of the pickup truck is a refrigerator.\n\nSo I charge up the stairs and I demand to know just what the hell is going on. And Nick, the druggie, calmly tells me-- he says, dude, when I moved in here, that refrigerator was so gross, I bought my own refrigerator and swapped it out. And I put that one in storage. And now I'm just putting it back.\n\nAnd I look in the kitchen. And sure enough, there's another refrigerator. It's a little old, a little dirty, but it's working.\n\nAnd I'm trying to think this through. Would someone really go to all that trouble of just swapping out a refrigerator and then putting it in storage and bringing it back? Or would a guy go to the trouble of stealing a used refrigerator just to screw his landlord and replacing it with an even more used refrigerator?\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nAnd well, the answer to both these questions is yes.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBut I look up, and there's Nick. And he's expecting me to say something. And there's his buddies, who are helping him move. And they're expecting me to say something. So I walk up to Nick and I look him in the eye and I say to him, you sweep up real good before you leave.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBecause there's just too many possibilities in this universe. Thank you.\n\n[APPLAUSE]"
