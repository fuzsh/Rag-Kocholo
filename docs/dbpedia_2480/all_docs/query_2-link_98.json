Anderson was associated with Washington State University (formerly Washington State College) from 1931 to 1963. He was chair of the Department of Physics for 30 years. He initiated a program of research on electronic work functions at WSU, which led to the establishment of a number of work function values still accepted as standard.\n\nDr. Anderson’s enthusiasms inspired many science students. After earning his doctorate at Harvard University, he taught in Berlin, Germany and Peking, China. He was excited about the WSU Department of Physics and wanted to build it into the ‘best physics department west of the Mississippi.’\n\nDuring World War II, Anderson and several colleagues won a contract from the Office of Scientific Research and Development to study radar waves. They experimented by sending radio signals from Mount Spokane to Steptoe Butte and the Blue Mountains. In winter they backpacked their equipment up the mountains over roads closed with drifted snow. Once they were mistaken for spies and could only explain that their mission was top secret and to please check with the Navy. Their work permitted detection of enemy vessels 600 miles away instead of the 150 that was formerly possible. At war’s end, Anderson was award the Presidential Certificate of Merit.\n\nDr. Anderson retired from WSU in 1963. He died in 1990 at the age of 92. He has two surviving sons, John H. Anderson of Bellingham, Washington, and James G. Anderson of Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nCLAIRE & WILLIAM BAND GRADUATE FELLOW-THEORETICAL PHYSICS\n\nWilliam and his wife, Claire May spent a lifetime devoted to the study of physics. Dr. Band was a native of Liverpool, England and was educated at the University of Liverpool. After receiving his M.Sc. degree in 1927, he served as a lecturer at Liverpool until 1929. He then took a position as lecturer at Yenching University in Peking where he later served as assistant professor, professor and department chair until December 7, 1941. On that morning, he and his wife, Claire May, started a walk through the interior of China that lasted for two years and brought them to Chunking.\n\nIn Chungking he served as science representative in the British Embassy Liaison Office until January 1945. From 1947 to 1949 he was a research associate at the Institute of Metals at the University of Chicago. Dr. Band was professor of physics at WSU from 1949 to 1971 and department chairman from 1962 to 1966.\n\nBand’s research was very broad ranging. During his early years he engaged in both theoretical and experimental work. Since 1939 his interests became almost exclusively theoretical. His seminal work on nucleation theory was noted by a 1972 NSF Workshop on Nucleation dedicated to him. Dr. Band was the author of well over a hundred scholarly papers.\n\nCLAIRE MAY BAND MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP IN PHYSICS\n\nThe Claire May Band scholarship was established by professor emeritus William Band in 1989 in loving memory of his wife, Claire May Band. William and Claire May spent a lifetime devoted to the study of physics. In his autobiography, Dr. Band described his wife as being an “enthusiastic and courageous” participant in all their “adventures”. This scholarship in physics was established in 1989 to recognize outstanding students in the physics program at Washington State University.\n\nWilliam Band was a native of Liverpool, England and was educated at the University of Liverpool.

During this period Claire and Bill made many close friends and had many exciting adventures in China and the Orient which have been related in detail in their books “Dragon Fangs” and Two Years with the Chinese Communists,” and in his unpublished autobiography.\n\nBill’s D.Sc. degree opened up opportunities in America that stimulated their mutual devotion to such a degree that they became known as the “Duet,” and remembered fondly from the tribute. Bill was widely published in his specialty and was honored following his retirement for his research on cluster theory at the First International Nucleation Theory Workshop held in Atlanta, Georgia in 1972. Bill and Claire remained active in retirement, deeply appreciated by colleagues and friends for their intelligence and unfailing good humor. All were saddened by Claire’s passing away in 1988. It is Bill’s devotion to Claire an d to the ongoing pursuit of new knowledge in the physical sciences which stimulated the establishment of this fund.\n\nThe purposed of this fund is to establish a Distinguished Professorship in Physics.\n\nPAUL A BENDER PHYSICS ENDOWED SCHOLARSHIP\n\nThis award is given in memory of Paul A Bender who was a professor of physics at WSU from 1960-1989. Dr. Bender received the bachelor and master degrees from Grinnell College and Washington University in St. Louis and the PhD at the University of Colorado in 1960. His first faculty position was at Drury College in Springfield, Missouri. He and Dian then moved west to join the WSU community. His research focus was in geophysics, where he pioneered the use of electron spin resonance for characterizing igneous rocks. His courses in optics, mechanics, and geophysics were popular, as he delighted in bringing dramatic demonstrations of the way things work to the classroom and laboratory. As a result, many exhibits and working experiments were developed which have delighted students and visitors alike. Paul Bender died in July, 1989 of Marfan’s Syndrome at 58 year old.\n\nDICKINSON TOM & DIANE ENDOWMENT IN PHYSICS\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences is proud of the many excellent research opportunities that we offer to our undergraduate majors.
