        "text": "A couple of emails about the Gillette murder case today and a discussion with my wife got me thinking about Dreiser and his novels.\n\nThe chief influence on Dreiser the novelist — at the outset — was Balzac, not Zola. The influence of novels like The Wild Ass’s Skin and Père Goriot was immense.\n\nIt has been long known that Sister Carrie was Dreiser’s reworking of true story involving his sister Emma and Lorenzo A. Hopkins, the prototype of George Hurstwood.\n\nThe story was not an obscure one. Hopkins’s theft from his employer Chapin & Gore (not Fitzgerald and Moy’s, as most people who get their facts from Dreiser’s novel assume) was headline news at the time.\n\nIt will probably sound as if I am showing off, but it is apparent to me how often it’s the case that literary scholars and biographers never go much deeper than the author’s works and published information — i.e., secondary sources — in their research; never look elsewhere for critical information.\n\nThis was the case with my discoveries about Lorenzo A. Hopkins — the real George Hurstwood. He died in Brooklyn, where he was working as a bartender. He did not go back to his wife in Chicago, as some writers have speculated. (Most biographers, to their credit, dismissed this.)\n\nHe had one daughter about whom I found some facts in census and other records, including her marriage record. Her name was Maria and she was married in 1900 at the age of 30. She would have been age 19 at the time of Hopkins’s theft.\n\nNo one ever bothered to find out what happened to the real Mrs. Hurstwood: Margaret (Menkler) Hopkins. I found two key records: her suit for divorce from Hopkins; and her subsequent marriage to Alfred D. Lutz, president of the Acme Copying Company in Chicago, in 1892.\n\nMargaret Lutz was murdered by Alfred Lutz’s brother Charles in 1900, subsequent to a dispute he had with Maragret and his brother Charles over his employment at the firm. Margaret took an active interest in the business.\n\nNone of this was known before.\n\nNo one bothered to try and find the real identity of “Don Ashley” — the lover, in Warsaw, Indiana, of Theodore Dreiser’s jilted sister Sylvia — or the death of Sylvia’s abandoned son Carl Dresser, a bellhop, in Chicago; and possible connections (in Dreiser’s mind) with the fictional Chicago bellhop Clyde Griffiths, and perhaps, in Carl’s mind (he died of asphyxiation from illuminating gas), with Hurstwood’s suicide in Sister Carrie.\n\nMarie Pergain and the toothpick incident\n\nThere is loads of information about her. She was a lounge singer and (briefly) a concert pianist; a silent movie actress; and the lover of the Hungarian pianist Ervin Nyiregyházi, whom both Deriser and Helen knew well.\n\n“Marie Pergain—possibly a fictitious name” — Swanberg\n\n“Marie Pergain, probably a pseudonym” — Lingeman\n\n“Miss Pergain’s identity has been a mystery, with many commentators on Dreiser’s Harlan experience holding that since she doesn’t seem to exist outside of that occasion, her name is probably a pseudonym. The mystery has been cleared up. …” — Donald Pizer, “John Dos Passos and Harlan: Three Variations on a Theme,” Arizona Quarterly, Spring 2015\n\n(No acknowledgment of my groundbreaking article.)\n\n“A platinum-blonde Hollywood bit player in the late 1920s who was also a serious student of the piano, Marie Pergain (1911–51) was Nyiregyházi’s mistress in Los Angeles for several years. She met Dreiser in New York in 1930 and began a relationship with him that lasted until early 1932.” — Pizer, Op. cit.\n\nPizer jauntily throws out these facts, as if they were discovered by him. He barley acknowledges his sources.\n\n— posted by Roger W Smith\n\nApril 2024\n\n*****************************************************\n\nSee:\n\nLorenzo A.

Smith on which this post is based has been updated as of March 16, 2017 with some new content based upon news accounts appearing in Chicago newspapers in February 1886.\n\nTheodore Dreiser drew heavily on real life incidents in writing his first novel, Sister Carrie. The main persons behind the story were his sister Emma and her lover, Lorenzo A. Hopkins.\n\nI have done some investigating attempting to dig out more facts about Emma, about Hopkins, and about their relationship and children. There is much confusion despite what scholars have already managed to uncover. Dreiser himself gave sketchy accounts in his autobiographical writings.\n\nI was aware that Hopkins’s wife, before he became involved with Emma Dreiser, was named Margaret and that they had one child, a daughter named Maria, who around 18 years old when Hopkins stole money from his employer in Chicago and absconded with Emma.\n\nThere was a Margaret Lutz, a married woman who seemed to be right age as Hopkins’s wife, who was murdered in 1900 — 14 years after her husband absconded — by her brother-in-law and who was, at the time, living just down the street (on the same block) from where she and Hopkins were previously living. Could this be the same woman as Margaret Hopkins, who had remarried a man surnamed Lutz?\n\nIt turned out that it indeed was. The key to proving this was that I recently found records of Margaret Hopkins’s divorce from her first husband, Lorenzo Hopkins, and her marriage to Alfred Lutz around eight years before she was murdered.\n\nAttached below as a downloadable Word document is a new article of mine about the case and its relationship to the portrayal of Hurstwood and his wife Julia in Sister Carrie.\n\n— Roger W.

Hopkins; 1847-1897) was the real life counterpart of the character George Hurstwood in Theodore Dreiser’s novel Sister Carrie.\n\nGertrude Amelia Hopkins (1894-1973), Theodore Dreiser’s niece, was the daughter of Dreiser’s sister Enema Dreiser (1863-1936). Emma was the real life counterpart of, and model for, the lead character in Sister Carrie.\n\n*****************************************************\n\nAbstract/Summary:\n\nTheodore Dreiser’s first novel, Sister Carrie, was based on real people and incidents: Dreiser’s sister Emma; and, Emma’s lover L. A. Hopkins with whom she eloped after Hopkins, a married man, stole money from his employer in Chicago.\n\nIn the novel, Carrie Meeber’s lover, George Hurstwood, commits suicide. Very little has been known hitherto about the identity of L. A. Hopkins, the real life model for Hurstwood, or what became of him after he and Dreiser’s sister Emma, the model for Carrie Meeber, settled in New York City.\n\nThis article provides information about Hopkins and his death. It also provides information about the life of Dreiser’s sister Emma after Hopkins’s death and about the children of Hopkins and Emma; they had two children whom Dreiser met in 1894 when he first visited New York City: George Nelson and Gertrude Hopkins. The former, George Nelson, did not relate to Dreiser in later life, though in his youth he had some contact with Dreiser’s brother Paul Dresser. The latter, Gertrude Hopkins, was Dreiser’s favorite niece.\n\n— Roger W.
