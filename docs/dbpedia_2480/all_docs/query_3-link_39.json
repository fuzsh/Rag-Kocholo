        "text": "Thomas C. McGonigle, 85, of Barrington, IL passed away peacefully at Good Shepherd Hospital on February 9, 2023. He was born on October 15, 1937 in Chicago, IL to parents Charles and Mary McGonigle.\n\nTom was a man of many loves, most notably his faith and family. He was a member of St. Anne Parish of Barrington where he served as a long-time volunteer.\n\nHe earned a scholarship to Northwestern through the Chick Evans Scholars Foundation as a golf caddy. His love for golf continued well into his retirement years and he shared that passion with family and friends. He was also an accomplished sailor and delighted in cruising his sailboat on Lake Michigan and the Caribbean with family and friends (although his wife Betty couldn't swim and was terrified most of the time).\n\nTom was a Civil Engineer and well-respected business leader serving as Vice-President of Sales for International Harvester before moving on to a distinguished career at Komatsu-Dresser."
