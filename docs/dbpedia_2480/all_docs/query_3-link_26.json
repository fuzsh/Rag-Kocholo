        "text": "Terre Haute, Indiana is a second home to me. My wife and aunt are from Terre Haute and numerous members of our family, including myself, graduated from Indiana State University. This city has a rich history including being known as the birth place of the Coke bottle. In addition, Terre Haute was the hometown of railroad labor organizer Eugene V. Debs, author and novelist Theodore Dreiser, song writer Paul Dresser, poet Max Ehrmann, philanthropist and entrepreneur Chauncey Rose , world champion boxer Bud Taylor, and Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman. Even 1908 Chicago Cubs Star Mordecai “Three Finger” Brown owned and operated a service station in Terre Haute after his playing days and is buried in Roselawn Memorial Park on Terre Haute’s north side. These are just a few names of Terre Haute trailblazers. However during my research I came across a Terre Haute native that I didn’t know but wouldn’t soon forget. This Terre Haute woman’s achievements helped open the door for other women to practice law in Indiana. Her name was Elizabeth (Bessie) Jane Eaglesfield and she was the first female to practice law in Indiana and one the first 15 women lawyers in America.\n\nBessie graduated from Terre Haute High School in 1871. She took an interest in the law and enrolled at the University of Michigan while also studying law with Terre Haute attorney, William Mack. At that time, state law required that only “resident voters” could legally practice law. Women did not gain the right to vote until 1920. On September 8, 1875, William Mack filed a motion requesting that Bessie be allowed to practice law. According to an article by Mike McCormick of the Terre Haute Tribune Star, Vigo Circuit Court Judge Chambers Y. Patterson found that she was “…of good moral character, a voter, and a resident of this state, and the Court, being advised, so admits said Bessie Eaglesfield.” At age 22, Bessie Eaglesfield became the first female attorney in Indiana and was practicing law in Terre Haute. She also was the first woman to earn a law degree from Michigan College. In 1881 she moved with her son to Indianapolis where she practiced law and owned and operated a fancy goods shop on North Pennsylvania Avenue. Later in 1885 she moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan. She learned how to pilot steam boats in Lake Michigan and delivered fruit packets between Benton Harbor, Chicago, and parts of Wisconsin. She continued to practice law while becoming the first woman to pilot a steam boat on the Great Lakes. She was known as shrewd and successful businesswoman and also a real estate mogul. In 2013 she was inducted into the Michigan Women’s Hall of Fame for her achievements in business and law.\n\nEaglesfield made Indiana legal history in 1875 but it wasn’t until June 14, 1893, 18 years later, that the Indiana Supreme Court would render a decision regarding female lawyers. Antoinette Dakin Leach, a court reporter, was granted the privilege to practice law. In this decision (re Leach, 134 Ind. 667, 34 N.E. 641 (1893), Supreme Court judge Leonard J. Hackney’s opinion that women, though not allowed to vote, could be admitted to the bar based on their qualifications. Although the court granted Leach a license to practice law, opponents of the decision delayed her admission to the Indiana State Bar Association until 1909.\n\nThis article is in honor of a true pioneer in the legal system, business world, and the waterways of the Great Lakes. It is my hope that the articles I write about legal history will continue to lead me and those who read them to people like Bessie Eaglesfield and Antoinette Dakin Leach. Their names should be known and their stories told and retold."
