WILLIAM DRAMM Kustka, Schmidt, Dramm Boys Drown; Small Boat Capsizes One Mile Out Norbert Kustka, August Haese Are Rescued On Sunday Afternoon BOYS SHOUT FAREWELL Small Sailboat Fills With Water Leaving Five In Craft To Flounder Three Manitowoc boys were drowned and two companions were rescued Sunday afternoon when their small sailboat capsized and sank about a mile off the Manitowoc lighthouse. The dead are: George Kustka, 22, 1016 N. 15th street. William Dramm, 19, 909 Park street. Milroy Schmidt, 18, 1809 Belmont St. Norbert Kustka, 17, a brother of George Kustka, and August Haese, 17, 1824 Belmont St., were rescued. Almost exhausted, they were picked up by the Esperanza II, Two Rivers pleasure yacht owned and skippered by Dr. Herman Kahlenberg. Search continued today for the bodies of the three youths. The lake is about 40 feet deep where the tragedy occurred. The sailboat had originally been an old steel lifeboat. It was built over by a club of boys and christened the Maybee. The boat was apparently caught in a trough as the attempt was made to turn it and head it for the harbor. One wave partially filled the boat and a second wave overturned it and sank it. The boys were unable to reach for life preservers in the cabin of the craft. According to August Haese, who gave the most coherent account of what took place, George Kustka, Dramm and Schmidt lost their lives when they became exhausted trying to swim toward the pier. Schmidt and Dramm, he said, both shouted farewell warnings to their companions as they were forced to give up their struggles. George Kustka never spoke, according to Haese. Were Floundering While all five youths who started out from the harbor here at 3 p.m. could swim. Haese and Norbert Kustka were the more proficient. Dramm was handicapped by a stiff shoulder which was broken in an accident some time ago. After waves nearly filled the Maybee it settled and sank from sight so quickly that the five aboard were soon floundering about in the choppy waters of the lake. The air tight bulkheads that were part of the steel lifeboat had been taken out to make room for the engine and cabine, built into the Maybee after a club of north side boys acquired the boat. Ballast added to the keel of the boat weighed it down. Norbert Kustka was at the tiller of the Maybee leaving the harbor. The engine was started to give the boat headway to the end of the piers. Sail was made and the engine was shut off. According to Kustka it was decided to turn back in the harbor when the mile post, a buoy located almost directly due east of the piers, was sighted just ahead. Wave Strikes Kustka put the helm over and the Maybee came around broadside to the swells running in toward the shore. Suddenly a big wave struck the craft and it partly capsized and began to fill with water. Quickly all five aboard clambered on the upper side of the Maybee in an effort to right her and bail out the water. A gust of wind and another wave completed the hazard of the youthful sailors. The boat filled more rapidly and suddenly started to sink. \"Pull off your clothes and swim toward the piers.\" Haese yelled as he took the lead toward the piers, almost a mile distant. All sensed the danger but no one sought to grab any of the others, according to Haese. \"We all started to swim toward the piers but the choppy seas made it hard,\" Haese said. Finally crowds on the pier and along the shore noticed the tragedy being enacted before their eyes. In the harbor, returning to Two Rivers, was Dr. Herman Kahlenberg in his power sailboat, the Esperanza II. With him was his wife, Alice, and two guests, Roland Klinkner and Lester Bentley. Spied Two Boys Edward Hamilton aboard a snipe boat in the inner basin and others on the pier motioned Kahlenberg out into the lake. He started his engine at full speed and drove in the direction they pointed. Soon just ahead two heads bobbed up and down in the lake. The Esperanza first came upon Haese. (continued on page 2) He was swimming toward the pier and did not appear to be in serious trouble. But 100 feet beyond Norbert Kustka, hindered by his clothing, was in distress. A ring life preserver was thrown to Haese and the Esperanza went to Kustka's rescue. He had partly sunk from sight when the rescue party reached his side. A long pike pole in the hands of Bentley and Klinkner was shoved over the side toward Kustka. Instinctively he grabbed it and he was pulled toward the side of the Esperanza. Mrs. Kahlenberg reached over and grabbed Kustka and soon he was on deck. The Kahlenbergs next turned toward Haese. He was clinging in the life preserver and trying to swim toward the pier at the same time. He was hauled aboard the rescue craft. The lake was scanned in all directions but the other three could not be seen. The Esperanza turned about and headed for the piers. Kustka had swallowed considerable water and lapsed into unconsciousness. Call Coast Guard In the meantime the alarm spread and soon the Two Rivers coast guard crew, in charge of Boatswain Mate Joseph Czechanski, put out and small craft from both this port and Two Rivers joined in the search. After an hour's search of the lake's surface dragging operations were started. The coast guard crew and the Schuette yacht Gesine dragged the bottom of the lake in the vicinity of where the Maybee sank from sight until 1 a.m. today and returned later this morning. When the Esperanza docked at the foot of North Sixth street with Haese and Norbert Kustka the inhalator squad from the north side fire station was waiting. While Haese was whisked away to his home on Belmont street Kustka was fed oxygen from the hose line while at the same time the firemen and physicians massaged his body and administered artificial respiration. In a few minutes Kustka revived but the treatment was continued for a half hour. He was placed in the city ambulance and taken to the hospital. He was able to return to his home late today. Large Crowds News of the triple drowning spread about the city like wildfire. Soon the shore line from Commercial street north to the Little Manitowoc was lined with hundreds of persons watching the searching parties. Even after darkness settled over the water last night the crowds of watchers stood along the shore. The Maybee, the steel lifeboat changed over into a sailing sloop and equipped with a gasoline engine, was in trouble before although Haese and Kustka insist the boat was seaworthy. Last June Norbert Kustka and Lester Musil, Menasha avenue, took the Maybee out in the lake. The motor died and an offshore wind prevented them from getting the craft back into port. They cast anchor a mile off the piers and remained most of the night until the coast guard from Two Rivers, in search for them, located the disable craft and towed it into port. Originally the Maybee served many years as a lifeboat on either one of the Goodrich boats or a Reiss freighter. It was secured by a club of boys, ten or more in number and rebuilt to provide a cabin forward and place for an engine at the stern. Arthur Haese Jr., 1824 Belmont street, a brother of one of the two boys saved, intended to make the trip Sunday aboard the Maybee, but he had an engagement to see a friend off to school and did not join the five others for the fatal cruise. First of Season The triple drowning Sunday marked the first fatalities of the summer season in Manitowoc and came a week after the life guards went off duty at the bathing beaches here. August Haese is a member of the junior life saving corps at Lincoln high school and has been proficient in swimming classes ever since leaving the eight grade. George Kustka, 22, one of the three drowning victims, resided at 1016 North 15th street and was the principal support of the family. He was employed as an attendant at the Deep Rock Oil companyon North 11th street. He was a graduate of the Lincoln high scool a few years ago and since leaving school has been employed. The survivors are his father Anton, four sisters, Agnes, Pauline, Mabel and Margie, and a brother, Norbert, one of the two saved Sunday. Norbert Kustka is employed as delivery boy for a meat market. The John Dramm family is among those who were sadly bereaved when the youngest member, William, died in the accident yesterday. He was 19 years of age. An ardent sailor, William had only yesterday put up his sloop, the Arab, for the winter. He was a member of the Manitowoc Yacht club and took a keen interest in maritime activities and history. He had collected one of the finest assortment of photographs of vessels built in or sailing from Manitowoc in the city. The collection encompassed vessels sailing from here during the past fifty years. His interests also led him to assemble a very excellent collection of postage stamps and he was a member of the local stamp collectors club. Besides his school work, William assisted in the Dramm floral shop and meat market. He enjoyed the out of doors and delighted in hunting and fishing. By confirmation he was a member of the First Lutheran church where he had many friends among the younger people. Going To School Milroy Schmidt, 18, son of Mr. and Mrs. Leo Schmidt, 1809 Belmont street, was born March 23, 1916. He attended the Lincoln high school for three years and took several courses at the Vocational school last year. \"He was already enrolled in the Vocational school this year and had planned on finishing high school,\" Mr. Schmidt said today. Milroy, together with the other accident victims, spent a great deal of time on the water. His interest in boats had taken up most of his spare time during the past few years. During the Homecoming celebration here, he and the others managed a speed boat ride service on the river. Besides his parents, Milroy is survived by a brother, Orley, aged 13, and a sister, Roma, aged 16. Manitowoc Herald Times, Monday, September 10, 1934 p.1 (Note: There are 2 more columns about the drowning on page 1) ********* LOCATE BODIES OF TWO; RITES ARE ARRANGED Bodies of Milroy Schmidt and William Dramm Found About a Mile Off Piers Bodies of two victims of the triple drowning off the harbor here a week ago Sunday when the sloop Maybee capsized and sank were recovered from the lake this morning. The first body found was that of Milroy Schmidt which floated to the surface a little more than a mile north of the piers near the pond nets of Richard Lade. Two hours later the body of William Dramm was found a mile off the north pier within a few hundred years of where the Maybee sank. Search continued today for the body of the third boy, George Kustka. The Schmidt body was first noticed by Mr. Lade early today when he went to lift his nets along the shore between here and Two Rivers. He put back to Manitowoc at once and notified the police station which in turn called the coast guard at Two Rivers. Accompanied by John Nehring, engineer on the White Swan, and Officer Aaron Peters, Lade took his boat out again. Hands Clasped The body was soon located and the boat awaited the coast guard to assist in lifting it from the water. Mr. Nehring climbed aboard the surf boat of the coast guard and assisted members of the crew in putting the body on board. Except for trousers it was fully clothed. There was a blue sweater over two shirts. Both hands were clasped tightly together. There were no marks or scars on the body. After depositing the Schmidt body on the dock near the Elks club Capt. Rogers took the coast guard crew out to continue the search. For a time there was no trace of a body but soon after a carferry passed into the harbor from across the lake, the currents lifted the body of the Dramm boy to the surface about a mile northeast of the north pier. This body was fully clothed, except that a blue outer coat had been removed. Funeral services for William Dramm, 19, youngest member of the John Dramm family, will be held Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. from the home, 909 Park street. The services will be in charge of the Rev. D.G. Ristad of the First Lutheran church of which the deceased was a member. Interment will be at Evergreen. Companions of the dead youth will act as pallbearers. William Dramm was born in this city in 1915 and after attending the Lincoln high school here assisted in the Dramm meat market and floral shop.

DRAMM (d. 1929) JOHN G. DRAMM DIES AT HOME THIS MORNING Pioneer Business Man of City For Fifty Years Dies After Extended Illness A long period of illness, extending for more than two years, at 4:30 oclock this morning brought death to John G. Dramm, 79, for over 30 years one of the best known business men of the city and county. Death occurred at the family home on Park street and members of his immediate family were at his bedside when the end came. Mr. Drumm was a resident of Manitowoc for more than 50 years, locating in this city in 1878 and since that time he has been actively engaged in the meat market business here. Coming here from Milwaukee, he was employed for a time at the meat market of Fred Lohe, Sr., corner of Eighth and Washington streets, becoming a partner in the venture with the retirement of Mr. Lohe, Sr. The business was conducted under the firm name of Lohe and Dramm for a number of years, the partnership being severed in 1901 when Mr. Dramm opened his own shop on Park street in the location of his present store. Two years ago, ill health forced him to retire from the active management of the business which has since been conducted by members of his family. Served in German War Born in Eckernfoerde in the province of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, on December 11, 1850, Mr. Dramm spent his early boyhood and manhood in Germany. As a young man he served in the Prussian army in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 and in the following year migrated to this country, locating at Milwaukee for several years while in the employ of a brother who conducted a meat market there. In 1855(sic), Mr. Dramm married Miss Anna Lohe, daughter of his partner and when Mr. Lohe, Sr., retired his interest was taken over by his son, Fred Lohe, Jr., and the two conducted the business for some years. In addition to his widow, Mr. Dramm is survived by six children, Herman, William and John at home, Eugene at Elmhurst, and Marie and Elsa at home. Funeral on Friday Funeral services will be held at the Dramm home on Park street Friday afternoon at 2 oclock, Rev. Machmiller and Rev. Koeninger being in charge. For many years, Mr. Dramm was an active and devout member of the German Ev. Lutheran church.

The boy died three hours after emptying the quarter-pint bottle of liquid. Death was due to the effects of nicotine poisoning, According to Coroner Theodore Teitgen, who said the active ingredient of the preparation was nicotine. The death was termed accidental and no inquest is planned. Saturday afternoon the boy accompanied his father down town to do some shopping. A large amount of chicken feed and supplies were purchased by the father and then they went home, driving into the driveway along side the home. According to Mr. Drees the boy remained seated in the front seat while the father took the supplies out of the car. The small bottle of louse compound was in the front seat and while the father was going back and forth, the boy apparently drank the contents of the bottle. When the boy started crying, Mr. Drees went to see what the trouble was and found the empty bottle and some of the contents spilled on the childs clothes. The father rushed into the house to get some milk to pour down the boys throat while the mother called a doctor. The mild antidote had the effect of bringing much of the contents of the boys stomach up while the lad was being rushed to the hospital. However, the boy died at 8:15 p.m. Funeral Tuesday.

Manitowoc Man, Who Will Hereafter be Known as John L. Dreng  First to Take the Step in County. Because, as he thinks, the name he bears is too common and ordinary, John L. Olson, residing at 907 St. Clair street this city, wants it altered and has taken advantage of the law passed by the recent legislature which provides that any citizen many make change of name by filing an affidavit with the register of deeds of the county setting forth reasons for the desired alteration together with a brief and concise history of the life of the individual. Mr. Olson has met the conditions imposed by the law and the necessary affidavit is on file at the office of Register of Deeds Mueller. The chief objection which Mr. Olson raise to the name he has borne for so many years is that it is common and ordinary and allow of conflict with that of other citizens in place where he resides. He confesses a partialty for his native country and is desirous of being known by a name he is entitled to assume from his homestead and the kingdom of Norway where he was born, that of Dreng. The affidavit is sworn to before Albert L Hougen. A fee of fifty cents accompanied the affidavit, which may be recorded in any other county in the state by payment of a like sum. Mr. Olson enjoys the distinction of being the first Manitowoc county man to seek a change of name under the new law.
