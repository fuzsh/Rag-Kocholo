        "text": "In February 1886, L. A. Hopkins stole cash from his employer, Chapin & Gore, in Chicago and fled with Theodore Dreiser’s sister Emma.\n\nThe couple wound up living in New York.\n\nThe story provided the factual basis on which the plot of Sister Carrie is based, as did the two persons involved. Emma Dreiser became Carrie Meeber (Sister Carrie) in the novel, Hopkins became Carrie’s lover George Hurstwood.\n\nThe full name of L. A. Hopkins was Lorenzo A. Hopkins. His dates were 1847-1897. He died in Brooklyn, New York on December 21, 1897 and is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery, Maspeth, Queens County became a borough of New York City in 1898.\n\nDescendants of Johann Paul Dreiser\n\ndescendants of Henry Schnepp\n\ndescendants of Theodore Dreiser\n\nDescendants of Johann Paul Dreiser\n\nDescendants of Henry Schnepp\n\nDescendants of Theodore Dreiser\n\nThis post contains three reports (downloadable PDF files above) showing the genealogy of branches of the Dreiser and Schnepp (aka Schänäb) families.\n\nThe Schnepp or Schänäb family were ancestors of Theodore Dreiser’s mother, Sarah Maria (Schnepp) Dreiser, and of his second wife, Helen Esther (Patges Richardson) Dreiser.\n\nThese reports were generated using genealogy software. Each report shows the ancestor going back to a beginning point, so to speak, and then shows that ancestor’s descendants for a few generations down to the present (to the extent known).\n\nThe report entitled “Descendants of Theodore Dreiser” merely shows genealogical facts about the author and his spouses. There were no descendants.\n\n— Roger W. Smith\n\nSeptember 2019; updated May 2020\n\nMargaret Dresser (born Margeruite May Steinman in 1867) was Theodore Dreiser’s sister-in-law. She was the wife of Dreiser’s brother Alphons J. Dreiser.\n\nTheodore Dreiser seems to have had minimal contact in later years with his brother Al, Margaret’s husband.\n\nIn his The Last Titan: A Life of Theodore Dreiser, Jerome Loving states (footnote pg. 448): “The last known address for Al Dreiser was in 1934, at 1235 Muirhead Street, Los Angeles; he had apparently written Dreiser about his share of the royalties from the publication of The Songs of Paul Dresser.”\n\nState of California\n\nDepartment of Health Services\n\nCertificate of Death\n\nMargaret Dresser\n\ndied August 7, 1961 at 7:25 p.m.\n\nFemale\n\nCaucasian\n\nbirthplace, Ohio\n\ndate of birth, February 2, 1867\n\nage, 94 years\n\noccupation, Housewife\n\nWidow\n\nPlace of death, Camarillo State Hospital, Camarillo, Ventura Co., Calif.\n\nlength of time there, 8 years 9+ months\n\nlast usual residence, Hillhaven Sanatorium\n\ncremation, August 9, 1961, Westwood Memorial Park Crem., Los Angeles\n\ncause of death, Arteriosclerotic Heart Disease\n\nAssociated with Senile Brain Disease, with Psychotic Reaction\n\nGeorge Kates Nelson (1892-1955) was Theodore Dreiser’s nephew.\n\nHis wife, Gunda Ryerson Nelson, was born in Norway and died in Freeport, Nassau Co., NY on December 7, 1944.\n\nGeorge Nelson was born in Manhattan on April 25, 1892. He took the surname of his stepfather, John Nelson. He gave his father’s name as John. Yet, he was the son of Dreiser’s older sister Emma and her (common law?) husband Lorenzo A. Hopkins.\n\n— posted by Roger W. Smith\n\nMarch 2016\n\nGertrude Amelia Hopkins (1894-1973) was Theodore Dreiser’s niece. Below is an image of her death certificate.\n\n*****************************************************\n\nNote: The late Harold J. Dies gave me a copy of Gertrude Hopkins’s death certificate. I would not have been able to obtain one otherwise, since only relatives can obtain such a record from the state of New York. It is an invaluable document. Gertrude was Theodore Dreiser’s favorite niece and knew Dreiser and his second wife Helen well. See my article\n\n“Lorenzo A. Hopkins, Emma Wilhelmina Dreiser, and Family”\n\nposted on this site at\n\nRoger W. Smith, “Lorenzo A. Hopkins, Emma Wilhelmina Dreiser, and Family”\n\n— posted by Roger W. Smith\n\nMarch 2016\n\nobituary , Mrs. Helen Esther Dreiser\n\nNew York Times, Saturday, September 24, 1955\n\nHelen Dreiser was Theodore Dreise r’s second wife. She was born Helen Esther Patges in 1984 in Oregon. Her first husband, who she married in Oregon, was Francis Dawson Richardson. She married Theodore Dreiser in the state of Washington in 1944. She died at the home of her sister in Oregon on September 22, 1955."
