        "text": "Paul Simpson Warren, 87, of Oro Valley, Ariz., and formerly of Riverside and Barrington Hills, died Jan. 6, 2012.\n\nMr. Warren graduated from Culver Military Academy in Indiana and was a state champion in skeet shooting. During World War II, he served as a pilot in the Army Air Corps at the rank of lieutenant.\n\nHe was also a graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology and followed his father as president of Gunthrop Warren Printing Co. in Chicago.\n\nMr. Warren remained interested in flying after the war. He owned and flew his own planes and was a volunteer pilot for Care Air Transport in Arizona. He also volunteered during his retirement for the Oro Valley Police Department.\n\nAccording to his family, Mr. Warren was a man of honor and honesty, but also a practical joker, a dapper dresser and a man with a gifted sense of humor and a mastery of limericks. He will be remembered by friends and family for his generosity.\n\nMr. Warren was preceded in death by his parents, Mary Bell Simpson Warren and Paul Gunthrop Warren; his first wife, Melissa Ann Jones Warren, and his second wife, Joan Phillips; and his son, William Wood Warren.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Christine Melissa (Robert Nemitz) Warren, of Edina, Minn.; Sydney Ann Warren of Los Angeles; and Paul L. Warren, of Lyons. He is also survived by his grandchildren, Lauren Rachel Carlstrom, Chase Simpson Carlstrom (fianc e Jessica Peyerl), Promise (Rick) Ringbakk, Paul M. Warren and Colin Arthur Warren; his niece, Deborah Denniston (Charlie) McBride; his nephews, Brackett Badger (Kathy) Denniston, Jay Baldwin Denniston and Blair Alexander (Katerina) Denniston; and his devoted caregivers, Teresa Montalvo and Joe Tolliver, and those staff at Casa De La Luz hospice.\n\nA memorial service was held Jan. 9 in Tucson, Ariz. A private service this spring will be held at St. Markâ€™s Episcopal Church Memorial Gardens in Barrington Hills.\n\nMemorial donations are appreciated to the American Heart Association, the Humane Society or a charity of choice.\n\nAdair Funeral Homes, in Tucson, handled arrangements."
