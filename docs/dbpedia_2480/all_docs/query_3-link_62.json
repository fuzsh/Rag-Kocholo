He was born in Chicago, Illinois, on October 1, 1950, to John and Clara Dobler. He is survived by his six children, Mark (Dina), Erin (Chad), Abbey (Casey), Franco (Molly), Holli (Jarrod), and Stephen (Haylie), and 12 grandchildren; and his sisters, Corrine, Cathy (Mitch), and Casey, and brothers Clifford (Iljosa), Chris and many cousins, nieces, and nephews. He is preceded in death by his wife Joy (2018), his parents John and Clara, and his sister Cindy.\n\nConrad grew up in Twentynine Palms, CA and called Wyoming his homebase from 1968-1986. With Laramie, Wyoming and the Teton mountain range always holding a special place in his heart. He settled in the Kansas City area for over 30 years and found lifelong friends through his many business ventures and involvement with the St. Thomas More community. In 2019, he relocated to Pueblo, Colorado to live with his daughter, Erin and her husband, Chad Lewin. Together with their kids Mati and Brady, Erin and Chad cared for Conrad in his final years and gave him the opportunity to finally relax and “kick his shoes off, baby”. He also had a dedicated caregiver, Nancy, who always laughed at his jokes while caring for him and became a close friend of his and the family’s.\n\nHe attended the University of Wyoming on a football scholarship, where he was a standout offensive and defensive lineman. Dobler was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1972 NFL Draft and played for the team until 1977. He then went on to play for the New Orleans Saints (1978-1979) and the Buffalo Bills (1980-1982). Conrad was a three-time Pro Bowler and three-time All-Pro. In 2003, he was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. Throughout his 10-year career, he earned a reputation as one of the most tenacious and hard-hitting offensive linemen of his era. Despite facing health challenges after his football career, Conrad was always grateful for the opportunities and experiences the sport provided him.\n\nOff the field, Conrad was a loving husband and father, who cherished spending time with his family and friends. He was most proud of his large, blended family and the loving relationships they have with each other. His quick wit brought laughter to those around him, and he was a great storyteller who loved to entertain others with his antics.\n\nHe worked hard to provide for his family performing speaking engagements, product endorsement, and hosting a sports-talk radio show before starting his own successful business—all the while gifting his children with unforgettable experiences and treasured memories.\n\nThroughout his journey, Connie displayed remarkable strength and resilience, never losing his fighting spirit despite the obstacles he faced. He would be the first to tell you he wasn’t perfect, but he lived life without regrets and with immense gratitude for his many blessings.\n\nConrad didn’t just have a season of play and mirth—he enjoyed a life filled with it. His adventurous spirit, and larger-than-life personality will be greatly missed by all who loved him.\n\nVisitation will be held at Muehlebach Funeral Home on Friday, March 3 from 4:00-7:00 p.m. located at 6800 Troost Avenue, Kansas City, MO. A funeral mass at St. Thomas More Parish will be on Saturday, March 4 with the eulogy starting at 9:30 with Mass of Christian Burial at 10:00 a.m. A reception will follow."
