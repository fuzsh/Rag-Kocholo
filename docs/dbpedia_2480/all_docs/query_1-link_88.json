        "text": "DESCRIPTION/HISTORY\n\nSt Louis Cemetery Number 1 is one of three Roman Catholic cemeteries which make up Saint Louis Cemetery. It opened in 1789, to replace the old Saint Peters Cemetery, once located closer to the heart of the city. New Orleans was redesigned after the huge fire of 1788. It was thought that it would be healthier to have the cemetery further away from where people lived.\n\nThough this high walled St. Louis Cemetery Number 1 is only one square block in diameter, it is the resting place of over 100,000 departed New Orleans citizens, due to burial customs, based on practicality. Because New Orleans has issues with high ground water, and a lack of land for burial, nearly all the graves are in above-ground vaults, which offered a variety of choices, showing the creativity of the human spirit. One does see one or two very old slab graves, with a slab of cement, bricks on top of the burial site, to keep the coffin(s) from popping out!\n\nThe traditional family vault ranged from simple to very grand: The deceased was placed in a wooden coffin, that was put in the above ground rectangular slot in the vault, and kept there for a year and a day. The coffin was then removed, and the bones were put in a bag, labeled and shoved to the back of the vault, leaving room for the next family member who may pass on. Sometimes the vault had another slot for an emergency, in case a death happened in the family or group before the year and a day time frame had elapsed. The grander the vault, the more slots were available. Sometimes, another vault space was borrowed in cases of multiple deaths in one year.\n\nThere were also group vaults, where a group of families or an organization got together and bought a large vault for their final resting place. These group vaults took on a variety of shapes in this cemetery of house-like vaults, which altogether resemble a neighborhood of structures for the dead.\n\nAlleys and pathways wind around the various vaults of the very prominent, making the way to the very back of the cemetery, to the resting place of the lowly of their society. The paupers field area of unmarked graves is located here, for people who couldn’t afford to buy a vault, and had no one to offer a space in another vault for burial. Also in the back of the cemetery is where the Protestant and Jewish minorities were buried, separate from the Catholics, yet still allowed in the cemetery.\n\nSt Louis Cemetery Number 1 is the final resting place of a variety of characters; some of the very notable, others that were flawed yet good citizens, and some very infamous characters with personal issues as well.\n\nIn the notable category\n\nOne can find the family vault of Etienne de Boré, King’s Musketeer turned sugar entrepreneur and Mayor of New Orleans.\n\nOne can find the family vault of Paul Morphy, a world famous chess champion.\n\nAlso of note is the large memorial vault honoring the remains of the men who died in the Battle of New Orleans.\n\nFlawed yet good citizens\n\nBernard de Marigny is best known for his love of gambling, and bringing the game of Hazard (craps) to New Orleans, though he also served honorably on the New Orleans City Council and as President of the Louisiana Senate. Because of his debts from gambling, Bernard sub-divided part of his plantation into sixty ft lots, which he sold to individuals for home development, becoming a real estate broker for a time, making money to feed his habit and support his luxurious, spoiled life-style. At the end of his life, he died without money because of his gambling, which eventually ate through the family fortune.\n\nInfamous characters with personal issues\n\nModel citizen turned Brigand, Barthelemy Lafon – Got off to a great start, as an architect, engineer, city planner for the City of New Orleans, making some great contributions. In 1803, when Americans began to flood New Orleans, he became Deputy Surveyor of Orleans County, and developed new housing and buildings in the Lower Garden District. However, after the Battle of New Orleans, he gave up his gifts and service, and joined the notorious Lafitte brothers, becoming a pirate and smuggler, being seduced by the thrills and easy, ill-gotten money. He died from yellow fever.\n\nVoudou Priestess – Marie Laveau – She and then her daughter sought fame and attention through practicing Voudou “magic” for both the good of people and to bring negative consequences to those whom they thought deserved it. They developed huge followings and cult status.\n\nHISTORY OF MANIFESTATIONS\n\nThere are numerous reports of paranormal activity, earning this cemetery the honor by some as the most haunted cemetery in the United States. Here are just a few.\n\nWhen a grave isn’t properly respected as a person’s remains, and honor due them is missing, entities have become restless, and haunt the area. Sometimes having personal regrets about life’s choices can cause restless spirits.\n\nVoudou Priestess – Marie Laveau\n\nMarie began life as an illegitimate daughter of a neglectful plantation owner and a free creole women. She married at 18 to a Haitian free man. Marie became a hair dresser to the wealthy after he died. She began to practice Voudou, and developed a huge following, by doing both good works, and other not so nice acts through her supposed magical powers, conjured up from a dark power.\n\nHer practice was based on elements of the Catholic religion, African religion and culture. Realists say that the results of her magical powers were based on the information she was able to gather through her hair dressing occupation and the vast network of informants made up of the creole servants, working in the wealthy households. Others say she actually used the black arts of darkness.\n\nWhy? Perhaps she was trying to get even or have power and respect from her father’s class, and society in general, becoming something above her lowly beginning. Her many followers came from all walks of life, from the wealthy to the poor.\n\nShe did volunteer to take care of the sick along side the priest during the many epidemics which rolled through New Orleans, perhaps to develop good PR among the people, or perhaps because she did have a heart and a will to do good, underneath all her issues, and her quest for power and fame. When she died, her daughter, also named Marie took over her mother’s Voudou cult.\n\nMarie Laveau was buried in an unmarked tomb, not in the family vault. Because of the fame and attention she received through practicing Voudou ” black magic”, the authorities didn’t want to turn the cemetery into a shrine for her followers. Her daughter Marie, also a Voudou Priestess was buried in the family vault years later, which may seem unfair to Marie Laveau, and perhaps has some regret about becoming involved with Voudou, as she is also seen praying twice a day at Saint Louis Cathedral-Basilica.\n\nThe Entity of Henry Vignes – Victim of a betrayal by a trusted person\n\nHenry was a seaman, who foolishly gave the papers to his family’s vault to his landlady, who owned the building where he lived. He trusted her to be in charge if he died at sea. She proved to be of poor character, and she sold his vault for her personal gain. When he suddenly died, before he could seek justice, there was no vault to put him in, so he was buried in an unmarked grave in the back of this cemetery in the pauper’s field area.\n\nSuffering a sudden, unexpected death, especially at the hands of another can cause restless spirits.\n\nThe entity of a young man – known as Alphonse – Never has gotten past his own demise…\n\nHe is lonely and misses his loved ones terribly. He seems to long for his home, and mourns his own death. This entity behaves like his life was suddenly taken from him, perhaps the victim of a member of the Pinead Clan, or a disease.\n\nMANIFESTATIONS"
