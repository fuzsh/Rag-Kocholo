Born Johann Paul Dreiser Jr., the son of German immigrants, he changed his name at age twenty. At one point in his early years, his father sent him to seminary school to become a Roman Catholic priest, but he left to join a traveling musical show. He could play the organ and composed sheet music that was sold after performing. By the turn of the century, his style of music had fallen from favor. Although he was wealthy at one point in his career, overspending made him nearly impoverished by 1903, forcing him to live with his sister. While living with his sister, he died of a brain hemorrhage and died. His body was held for almost a year until the funeral arrangements were paid in full. His burial was on November 23, 1907, without a stone. His brother Theodore Dreiser became a well-known novelist.\n\nSongwriter.
