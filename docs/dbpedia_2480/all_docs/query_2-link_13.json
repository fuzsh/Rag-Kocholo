N.\n\nFrom the painting by Elizabeth Newell\n\nPaul Dresser - On the Banks of the Wabash at the Country Club, Terre Haute\n\nThis postcard, posted in Terre Haute on May 30th, 1934, has just the printed text 4492\n\nPaul Dresser was born Johann Paul Dreiser to John and Sarah Dreiser at 318 South Second Street in Terre Haute on April 22, 1857, 1858 or 1859. Wikipedia says 1857, Indiana Historical Society says 1858 and Vigo County Historical Society says 1859. Running away from home at age 16 he later became a famous songwriter and was one of the most popular of the 1890's. He wrote \"My Gal Sal\" and \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" which on March 14, 1913 became Indiana's state song. Despite his fame he was not very careful with his money and died a poor man at his sister's home in Brooklyn, N.Y. on January 6, (or the 30th ,again according to the source) 1906. His younger brother, Theodore Dreiser, became famous as an author.\n\nThe single story house, seen in the fourth, probably romanticized, postcard view was constructed in 1850 and purchased by the Dreisers in 1859. The original brick structure consisted of a living room, bedroom, and lean-to kitchen. Paul's father added a front porch and second story to the house. Access to the upper story is an outside stairway, an arrangement typical of houses of the era. The house is significant as the Dresser birthplace, but also as an example of how 90 percent of Hoosiers lived in the pre-Civil War period of the 1850's. In 1963, the house was moved to Dresser Drive in Fairbanks Park and now stands as depicted in the first postcard.. In 1967, the Indiana General Assembly designated the home a State Shrine and Memorial, and the National Music Council listed it as \"A Landmark of American Music\". The home is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\"\n\nRound my Indiana homestead wave the cornfields,\n\nIn the distance loom the woodlands clear and cool.\n\nOftentimes my thoughts revert to scenes of childhood,\n\nWhere I first received my lessons, nature's school.\n\nBut one thing there is missing in the picture,\n\nWithout her face it seems so incomplete.\n\nI long to see my mother in the doorway,\n\nAs she stood there years ago, her boy to greet!\n\nChorus\n\nOh, the moonlight's fair tonight along the Wabash,\n\nFrom the fields there comes the breath of new mown hay.\n\nThro' the sycamores the candle lights are gleaming,\n\nOn the banks of the Wabash, far away.\n\nMany years have passed since I strolled by the river,\n\nArm in arm with sweetheart Mary by my side.\n\nIt was there I tried to tell her that I loved her,\n\nIt was there I begged of her to be my bride.\n\nLong years have passed since I strolled thro' the churchyard,\n\nShe's sleeping there my angel Mary, dear.\n\nI loved her but she thought I didn't mean it,\n\nStill I'd give my future were she only here.\n\nThis page created 26th January 2008, last modified 3rd January, 2010"
