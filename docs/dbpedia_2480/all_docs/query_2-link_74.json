        "text": "Ronald Larrieu\n\n“The Self Made Man”\n\nRonald Larrieu Sr. entered our world November 9, 1937, in Chicago IL, to the union of Fernand Anselmo and Esther Boutté Larrieu, who both preceded him in death. He departed this life on August 16, 2023. Affectionately, known as Ronnie, he was the fifth child born of this union. Ronnie and his siblings, Warren, Antonia, Donald and Stanley lovingly experienced brotherhood with their parents’ and extended parents’ children, Balifimu (Paul), John, Fernand Jr., Baba Tyehimba (Russell) and Nathaniel. John and Tyehimba are Ronnie’s only two surviving siblings.\n\nRonnie wed his God sent wife, Joycelin Walker, on July 12, 1958, who preceded him in death. He leaves behind his devoted four children, Teronia, Donna, Eva, and Ronald Jr.; his exceptional eleven grandchildren, Amber, Benjamin, Brittny, Marsella, Briana, Olivia, Lauren, Daniel, Tatiana, Jhazaria and Roy; and his outstanding six great-grandchildren, Jamya, Jesiah, Cloé, Bella, Khaliah, and Radiance to cherish his memory.\n\nRonnie and his siblings’ life fortune was being raised in a large extended family that possessed a guiding nucleus of elders strengthened by independence and woven together by interdependence. Family holidays and outdoor family events filled with food, fun, and music were the greatest joys and simple childhood treasures Ronnie held so dear. Ron’s philosophy on life was rooted in the meager beginnings of a dresser drawer for a bassinet. His parents migrated to Chicago from New Orleans to make a better life for their young family. As young boys, Ron and his brothers wonderfully played army men and nibbled on bread balls of ammunition from their pockets. As a young, devoted husband, Ronnie strived to provide his family with the absolute best hard work could afford and was committed to maintaining his wife and children. Like Lake Pontchartrain, Ronnie extended himself, and kept working hard for his wife and children pushing onward to new heights and new beginnings. Like the New Orleans Causeway Bridge over that vast waterway, Ron Larrieu pushed himself, his children, and anyone found under his wing, to excel in school, sports, arts, education, business, wealth, and health. Ron Larrieu “The Self Made-Man” gave himself to countless family and friends, planting the seeds of opportunity and the notion of “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.”\n\nRon contributes his success to a stern mother, who schooled him to “Take Can’t, Out of Your Vocabulary” and high school coaches who believed in him and taught him how to win. Raised a Catholic, Ron grew into a man of strong convictions. Possessing the spirit of a Gulf Stream Hurricane, Ronald forged the philosophy of excellence, self-reliance and fortitude of heart that exceeded beyond measure. He rose to his heights on the footprint of the standard buck, carrying the persona of a businessman, making him the right fit into Chicago’s City Hall’s Black businessmen scene, and a pioneer exemplar for America’s rising Black entrepreneurs. Ron, “The Self Made Man” valued family traditions and a prideful life. As one of Chicago’s leading minority businessmen, he took pride in setting a high work ethic and conquering spirit hurdling life’s obstacle course. He believed in upward mobility and lived within the clouds of possibilities found in the impossible. Often Ron would gather his children and grandchildren in the kitchen and drill them on the old teachings from his childhood. His sermon rang with sayings like, “the early bird catches the worm, you got to always be a step ahead, you must follow through and keep your eye on the ball, you can’t just finish the race, you got to push harder than the guy next to you, it is mind over matter.” His most profound words were, “see, there is only one first place winner, and you must ask yourself, ‘what must I do to be the NUMBER ONE WINNER’ ”. Then he would finish his story of how African American’s always had to do more and be better than the next and that meant arriving early to the job and finishing late, going the extra mile. That is the standard he lived, breathed, and preached. His advice to you would be not to worry about where you started and when you end. He would tell you to focus on the DASH and not to look back.\n\nRon Larrieu “The Self Made Man”\n\nD -- A – S -- H\n\n1952 --- IL.
