        "text": "By: Allen Shotwell Ph.D. | Ivy Tech | Terre Haute Campus\n\nThe Golden Age for steamboat traffic on the Wabash River near Terre Haute occurred between the Civil War and World War I. Although the Steamboat Era in the United States peaked in the 1830s, the Wabash did not see the same level of traffic as other rivers in the early nineteenth century because its navigability was never actively improved and maintained by the Federal Government the way Ohio and the Mississippi rivers were. Only after the Civil War ended and the Erie Canal became less viable, did the federal government, encouraged by Indiana politicians, invest in making the Wabash River more navigable, allocating money to the Army Corps of Engineers for clearing the river and keeping an open channel.\n\nCommercial Activity\n\nUriah Shoemaker was one of the earliest Terre Haute businessmen to invest in steamboat traffic on the Wabash River after the Civil War. He purchased a surplus Army steamboat, the Romeo, and hired it out for hauling goods and for transportation up and down the river. The Romeo made regular trips downriver to Vincennes and upriver as far as Covington. Shewmaker only operated the steamboat for two years before selling it, but even after Romeo’s short stint was finished, the Shoemaker family remained prominent in river commerce in Terre Haute, maintaining a boathouse and boat manufacturing business well into the twentieth century. Other companies followed Uriah Shewmaker’s lead, including the Hudnut Hominy Company, a national company that produced hominy and other products from corn and had its headquarters in Terre Haute. The Hudnut Company used steamboats to haul corn grown in the river bottoms to their plant in Terre Haute at harvest time. During the rest of the year, they used their boats to transport people and other products like wood up and down the river.\n\nRiver commerce played a large enough role in the Terre Haute economy, that local newspapers regularly reported on river traffic, accidents, and water levels. One reporter assigned to the river beat was Edward Price Bell, who would go on to report for Chicago newspapers, to work in London as a foreign correspondent, and even to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. But it wasn’t just commerce that connected Terre Haute citizens to the river. The Wabash was also a place for all kinds of leisure activities.\n\nLeisure Activity\n\nLeisure boating on the Wabash River was prominent in the late nineteenth century and a favorite hobby for many Terre Haute residents. Many wealthy and elite families had their own boats that they used to cruise the river or to go on hunting and fishing trips at various places along the Wabash, including Greenfield Bayou south of the city. Various clubs, like the Joker Club, were also formed so that their members could pool their funds to purchase or build leisure boats. One well-known boat was the Diana built by Commodore Chauncy Twaddle of Terre Haute and his friends and used by them for hunting and fishing excursions south of the city. Sunday school classes, church groups, and businesses also regularly used the river for excursions trips, hiring river barges and steamboats to go picnicking along its banks or to visit various locations for outings.\n\nThe River’s Effect\n\nDuring its Golden Era, the Wabash River was a major aspect of daily life in Terre Haute. Many of the city’s most famous residents in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made references to the river and felt deep connections to it. One of the best examples is the writer, Theodore Dreiser, who the city and the river in a book about a car trip he had taken with his friend, the artist Franklin Booth, from New York City to Indiana where they had both grown up. Theodore’s brother, Paul Dresser, famously wrote the song, “On the Banks of the Wabash” a sentimental song about youth and young love, but Theodore’s book, A Hoosier Holiday, was written much later after Paul had passed away. It described Theodores view of Terre Haute and the river when he came back to visit the place where he had grown up and included illustrations by Booth. Dreiser and Booth were caught up in the city’s industriousness, and choose a view of the city along the Wabash River, as seen from the western bank, as representative of this defining characteristic. The Wabash River meant different things to people from Terre Haute. The two brothers, Theodore and Paul, incorporated it into their art in different ways. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, just like today, the Wabash meant commerce, leisure, and industry."
