        "text": "March 21st, 2024\n\nI am so sorry to learn that Jarvis died. We worked together for many years and I was thinking of him because itâ€™s tax season. Jarvis made doing taxes less stressful. He was considerate, funny, really detail oriented and fast. I send my deepest sympathy to Robin, his sons and the family.\n\n~Petra M Blix\n\n~Client and friend, Chicago, IL\n\nDecember 5th, 2023\n\nSince 1976 Jarve was always my good friend and confidant. I will always remember him.\n\n~Stephen and Mia Bronson\n\n~Friend and collegue., Scottsdale\n\nDecember 5th, 2023\n\nOur world is a sadder place without Jarvis in it. It would be a much better place if more people followed the examples and principles that Jarvis set and lived by while he was with us. A true friend for life, certainly mine, he lived each day as a man of honor and integrity willing to help those less fortunate than him when afforded the opportunity. He was my mentor in business and in life. I will try to continue to follow the path he set me on, but he will always be a tough act to follow. I miss him so much but know he will not be forgotten by all those in his life that he touched as only he could.\n\n~HENRY E LUKEE\n\n~Close friend and business partner, ORLANDO, FL\n\nDecember 5th, 2023\n\nWhen I first met Jarve, I knew that he was someone special!\n\nJarve was my boss, teacher, friend, financial advisor, mentor, confidant and phone a friend if I was ever on Cash Cab or Who wants to be a Millionaire.\n\nI will hold our last conversation deep in my heart and so fortunate we were able to express the admiration and love we had for each other.\n\nSending Robin, Paul, Allie, Adam, Michael and the rest of the Friduss family, my deepest condolences.\n\nRest in peace Jarve XOXO\n\nDebbie\n\n~Deborah Clarke\n\n~Boss and Friend, Huntley IL\n\nDecember 5th, 2023\n\nIâ€™m so grateful my life came into contact with Jarve.\n\nHe was my boss at FLS, my life coach how to live a good life, my health coach towards self control with chocolate, and the best St. Patrickâ€™s day leprechaun Iâ€™ve ever encountered.\n\nWe would meet at 3:00 for a 5 minute chocolate break during tax season. A tradition I carry on today.\n\nIn those moments I am transported back to his corner office and our brief, but deeply cherished, chats and laughter for those few minutes.\n\nWhen the light hits the paperweights that he shared with me, and a rainbow appears, I canâ€™t help but hear him tell about the technique used to create the weight and how his eyes sparkled when he spoke.\n\nAnd the excitement when a new weight was unveiled in the office!! Anyone who was in the office would pause to see the new treasure.\n\nSending my prayers today and Iâ€™ll keep a candle lit.\n\n~Kathie Schneider\n\n~Friend and colleague, Prospect Heights Illinois\n\nDecember 5th, 2023\n\nHe was so charming,\n\nHe also was smart,\n\nI loved him so much,\n\nWith all of my heart.\n\nAlways so thoughtful\n\nAnd always so kind,\n\nCompassionate, with\n\nA razor sharp mind.\n\nHappy and loving\n\nAnd truly the best\n\nOf men, by accounting,\n\nTo which l attest.\n\nHis beautiful life\n\nPlayed out like a song\n\nOf symphonic notes,\n\nBoth mellow and long.\n\nMay he sleep soundly,\n\nIn well deserved peace,\n\nWhile my memories\n\nOf him, never shalll cease.\n\nDiane Kulwin Dresser\n\nCousin, Westlake Village, California\n\n~Diane Kulwin Dresser\n\n~Cousin, Westlake Village, California\n\nDecember 2nd, 2023\n\nMy deepest condolenceâ€™s to the family.
