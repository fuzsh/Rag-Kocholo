        "text": "The 2024 State Fair is underway through August 18th, offering an assortment of food and fun activities for the whole family to enjoy.\n\nREAD MORE: Enjoy the Indiana State Fair on a Budget During $2 Tuesdays\n\nOn Tuesday, August 6, 2024, I made the three-hour drive up to Indianapolis, Indiana, for the Indiana State Fair with some co-workers. It was my first visit to the State Fair in almost 10 years, so I was excited to check out the festivities and chat with folks about their experience. While the heat could certainly be felt, that didn't stop us from taking in the State Fair one stop at a time.\n\nFirst of all, the Indiana State Fair staff were very kind and helpful. Anytime we had a question about where to go, they were happy to lend us their time. I'd like to give a special shoutout to \"Rosie,\" who was working near the front gate. She was one of the sweetest laddies I've ever met and even gave us a ride back to our vehicle at the end of our trip. Thanks again, Rosie.\n\nWhen we first arrived at the fairgrounds, we took a stroll along the stretch of food vendors eagerly slinging goods to hungry hoosiers. I walked by a trailer that had some very interesting food items pictured all over the outside, which made me hungry just looking at it. I was intrigued.\n\n\"Our bestseller here is the fried pickles and the Outlaw Fries,\" said Carlos, who was one of the hardworking employees at the food stand, which was actually called \"Outlaw Fries.\" He added that the fries are cut like a thick potato chip, fried to perfection, and topped with queso, bacon, green onion, and sour cream. They certainly smelled fantastic. When it came time for lunch, however, I decided to go with some classic chili-cheese fries. They did not disappoint.\n\nMany would agree that Tuesday is perhaps one of the best days to visit the Indiana State Fair, given the \"$2 Tuesdays\" promotion. During this promotion, folks can enjoy $2 admission, $2 rides, and even select $2 food deals. In fact, I ran across some folks who were happily enjoying their $2 corn dogs while soaking up the State Fair atmosphere. One of those folks was Tamika, a lifelong Indianapolis resident.\n\n\"I come because of tradition. I grew up in this neighborhood,\" she said. \"We've been walking over here since I was a little bitty kid, and now my mother lives across the street, so we walk over here a few times a year to partake in the State Fair and the food.\"\n\nIn addition to the hefty food scene, fairgoers can also learn all about Indiana's farming and agricultural roots. While stopping by the Glass Barn, our group had the opportunity to do a quick scavenger hunt, which awarded each of us a brand-new hat. (I wore mine the rest of the day.) Additionally, we stopped by the Purdue Extension Building, where I found someone pouring an assortment of bright-colored liquid into containers.\n\n\"I have a bunch of jugs with sodium alginate solution in them, and they're colored for fun. We're going to use them as a way to repurpose algie into making string,\" said Amanda Limiac, who works in the Agriculture & Biological Engineering Department at Purdue. She added the string would be used to make friendship bracelets, adding to the running list of fun activities kids can enjoy at the Indiana State Fair."
