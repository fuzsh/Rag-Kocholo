        "text": "It’s a grave without a body – a searing reminder of the violence of that day and the enduring heartache of those whose loved ones were taken from them on 9/11.\n\nElaine Leinung lost both her son and her cousin in the World Trade Center attacks – but she has been able to bring home only one of them, her cousin.\n\nNow, the city Medical Examiner’s Office has called off the effort to identify remains, dashing any hope for the time being that Leinung will be able to bury her son, 22-year-old Paul Battaglia, beneath the headstone that she has for him.\n\nHe is one of more than 1,100 unidentified victims.\n\nIt was Leinung’s cousin, Harry Taback, 56, who helped Paul get a job at insurance brokerage Marsh & McLennan on the 100th floor of the north tower.\n\nToday, Taback and Battaglia both have headstones at a cemetery in Staten Island – Taback’s grave holds his remains, identified more than a year ago, while Battaglia’s grave is empty.\n\n“I wanted someplace that we could go to and say that he was here and he was a member of our family,” said Leinung, of Brooklyn. “It was really important to me that I could feel that he was here.\n\n“I felt that he could see us doing it, and that was important to me,” she said, holding back tears. “The priest even blessed the stone.”\n\nLeinung said it brought her comfort to know that, in a way, her son and cousin are still together.\n\n“They were killed together. They should be buried together,” she said. “I’ve kind of made peace with it.”\n\nAlthough she once hoped to bury her son, Leinung said she has come to terms with the fact that the his remains may never be found or identified.\n\n“I always knew that he could not get out,” she said. “I kind of always knew that we wouldn’t get any remains back because he was so high up in the building.”\n\nAfter hearing that the ME’s Office had stopped trying to identify remains, Leinung said she actually was a little relieved.\n\n“It’s really not going to bring me any comfort,” she said. “It’s only going to bring back memories of ‘How did he go?’\n\n“You don’t want to leave a piece of your loved one unclaimed somewhere.\n\n“On the other hand, it’s like, how much can you go through?”\n\nLeinung has put up a “shrine” in her home, consisting of mementos, photos and poems about her son.\n\nShe also visits his grave on Staten Island, where his headstone identifies him as “Victim of World Trade Center tragedy.”\n\n“I didn’t want people to think he was killed by a drunk driver or was using drugs or something,” she said.\n\nOthers who lost relatives whose remains were not identified were stirred by the Medical Examiner’s Office announcement.\n\nMonica Iken, who lost her husband, Michael, called the suspension of efforts to identify victims “disturbing information.”\n\nBut she holds out hope that new DNA techniques will be developed. She also takes comfort in the idea that there may be a memorial park for 9/11 victims.\n\n“If I never get my husband back, at least we can have a place to go,” she said. “That will connect him with his spirit.”\n\nBill Doyle bought a plot for his son Joey, a Cantor Fitzgerald worker.\n\n“Now there’s nothing in it,” he said. “I was going to have Joseph being with my wife and I. Now I don’t know what we’re going to do there.”\n\nCharles Wolf, whose wife Katherine, 47, worked on the 97th floor of the north tower, still can’t muster the courage to claim her jewelry and other personal effects.\n\n“The form is still sitting on my desk,” he said. “I haven’t even read it yet.”\n\nBut Wolf said the close ties he had with his wife will never be lost.\n\n“The force within us that makes you you and me me never dies,” he said.\n\n—-\n\nIKEN\n\nMonica Iken keeps a memorial to her husband, Michael, in her bedroom. It is a huge chest that contains “everything about our love” and is the special way the 34-year-old Iken mourns Michael, a trader who died on the 84th floor of the south tower on 9/11. Monica doesn’t have Michael’s remains because they haven’t been identified – along with the remains of some 1,100 others. But she says that unlike other 9/11 families, she could never mourn her husband by placing his gravestone over a patch of grass in a cemetery. “I couldn’t put his stone some place where I couldn’t go to it,” she said. So she has the chest, which she can always go to. And when she finds new things that remind her of their years together, she places them inside. “This is my memorial. That is his chest,” she said.\n\n-Andy Geller\n\nWOLF\n\nCharles Wolf, 50, hasn’t received any of his wife Katherine’s remains; he believes she was “vaporized.” “It was instant vaporization,” he said. “And that, to me, is what has saved me in so many respects – knowing that my wife didn’t feel any pain. I thank God that she didn’t have to make the choice of whether to stay or jump.” Wolf has only a wooden urn filled with dirt from the site and an American flag, which the city gave to relatives of all the victims. Both items are in storage because Wolf lives in a small apartment in Greenwich Village. Wolf, who often visits a private garden at the Midtown office of his wife’s former employer, Marsh & McLennan, said bringing her home hasn’t been a priority for him. What’s important is that he keeps her in his heart, he said.\n\n– Stephanie Gaskell\n\nDOYLE\n\nAn empty grave waits for Joey Doyle in Staten Island’s Resurrection Cemetery. The 25-year-old Cantor Fitzgerald worker died Sept. 11 and his remains were never found – but Doyle’s father, Bill, won’t be filling his son’s grave with clothes or pictures or other loving mementos like some families have done. Doyle often wanders into Joey’s old bedroom, looking at his baseball trophies, the award he received from the FDNY for a winning essay he wrote about firefighters at age 7, and the pictures covering the dresser and walls. On the front lawn of his Staten Island home, Doyle keeps a recent photograph of a smiling Joey along with statues of St. Joseph and Mary. An enormous flag listing each victim’s name completes the memorial. On holidays, neighbors drop by to say a prayer and drop flowers in front of the photo.\n\n– Heidi Singer"
