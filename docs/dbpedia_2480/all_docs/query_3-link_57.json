This page contains information on the \"Main Dresser Line\" of John and Mary Dresser, who settled in Rowley, MA on October 10, 1638.\n\nAdditional Dresser Family History can be found at Dresser genealogical information produced by Jim Dresser of Groton, Vermont.\n\nAdditionally, if your last name is Dresser and you would like to have your e-mail address be yourname@dresser.net , please e-mail Paul, at paul@neis.net.\n\nPrimitive personal names doubtlessly originated soon after the invention of spoken language in the dark ages preceding recorded history. For thousands of years thereafter first or given names were the only designations that men and women used. At the dawn of history, the world was less crowded than it is today. Every man knew his neighbor, so one title of address was sufficient.\n\nGradually, with the passing centuries and the increasing complexity of civilized society, a need arose for more specific designations. While the roots of our system of family names may be traced back to early civilized times, the hereditary surname as we know it today dates from scarcely more than nine hundred years ago.\n\nTrue surnames, in the sense of hereditary appellations, date in England from the year 1000. Largely they were introduced from Normandy, although there are records of Saxon surnames prior to the Norman Conquest. During the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042- 1066) there were Saxon tenants in Suffolk bearing such names as Suert Magno, Stigand Soror, Siuward Rufus, and Leuric Hobbesune (Hobson); and the Domesday record of 1085-1086, which exhibits some curious combinations of Saxon forenames with Norman family names, shows surnames in still more general use.\n\nBy the end of the twelfth century in England, hereditary names had become common, but not universal. During the reign of Edward V, a law was passed to compel certain Irish outlaws to adapt surnames; \"They shall take unto them a Surname, either of some Town, or some Colour, as Blacke or Brown, or some Art or Science, as Smyth or Carpenter, or some office, as Cooke or Butler.\" As late as the beginning of the nineteenth century, a similar decree became effective compelling Jews in Germany and Austria to add a German surname to single names that they had previously used.\n\nA surname is a name added to a baptismal or given name for the purpose of making it more specific and of indicating family relationships or descent. Classified according to origin, most surnames fall into four general groups: 1) those formed from the given name of the sire; 2) those arising from bodily or personal characteristics; 3) those derived from locality or place of residence; 4) those derived from occupation.\n\nThe surname Dresser belongs in that large group of English family names which were derived from occupations. One authority is of the opinion that the first bearer of the name was a \"dresser\" of plants or a gardener, while another contends that the name refers to the cloth-dressing trade. Preparers of meat for banquets were once called \"dressers\".\n\nThe original founders of the Dresser family probably came from Denmark during the Danish invasion of England in the 9th century. They were among those who settled in Yorkshire, England, about 876 AD. There is recorded history back to the 1300's in the Yorkshire environs.\n\nIn 1301 Ada (m) Dreyster of Patrick Brompton paid fealty towards the war with Scotland. In 1327-33 the same of another Ada Dresser of Pickering-cum-Gotland paid taxes presumably for the French Wars. In 1337 William Dressure was a witness on a land deed at Bolton Percy. There was a Henry Dresser living in Yorkshire in 1470 whose signature appears on several documents. Other spellings were found as Dressur in 1471, as John Deser and William Drysser in 1545, and finally to an Edward Dresser in 1600.\n\nOur line comes from the Ada Dreyster of Horton or Ada of Pickering- cum-Gotlan 1327-1333:\n\nWilliam Dressure de Bolton-Percy AD 1379.\n\nJohn Drissur of Caterton near Tadcaster. d. 1479\n\nWilliam Drysser, Acaster Selbye. b. 1495 d. 1560 Styllynslete.\n\nRobertus Dresser, Stillington. b. 1518 d. 1588 m 1577\n\nChristopher Dresser, Grimstone, d. 1626 m. Mararet- Wd Gilling 1620\n\nJohn Dresser, b. 1605, Skewsby, Grimstone, Yorkshire, England.\n\nDRESSERS OF NOTE\n\nEgbert Stanley Dresser,(1835 - 1895) Enlisted August 1862 in Company H, 104th Illinois Infantry as a Corporal. He participated in the Tattahoma Campaign and was with General Sherman on his \"March to the Sea\" during the Civil War. He mustered out as a sergeant in June 1865.\n\nEliza Dresser married Moses Spofford, a descendant of an ancient Yorkshire family ancestor who sailed on the Mayflower to America. Eliza was married June 3, 1835, and was a noted beauty of the period.\n\nReverend Charles Dresser, Episcopalian minister of Springfield, Illinois, performed the wedding ceremony of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd, November 4, 1842. On January 7, 1844, he sold his home in Springfield to Abraham and Mary. This is the only home the Lincolns ever owned. This home is now a national monument and is preserved in Springfield.\n\nLouise Dresser, b. 1888 in Indiana. She, along with Janet Gaynor and Gloria Swanson, was a nominee for best actress for the first Motion Picture Oscar in 1928. She was the leading actress in the silent movie \"A Ship Comes In\". Janet Gaynor won the award.\n\nIn 1620, Ezekiel Rogers, b. 1590 Wethersfield, England, a Chaplin of the family of Sir Francis Carrington of Hatfield, Broad Oak, Essex, became Rector of the Rowley Church. After 18 years of service he ran afoul of Archbishop Laud. Rogers, an unbending Puritan, accused Laud of bitter attacks on the Puritan sect, calling him \"the Persecuting Prelate.\"\n\nIn 1638, Rogers was suspended as Rector because he refused to read an 'accursed' \"book of Sports\" to his congregation advocating dancing, archery, leaping and May games after divine services on Sunday. Like the staunch Puritans, he decided to migrate to America with about twenty of his parishioners and their families.\n\nMy Great G.G.G.G.G.G.G. Grandfather, John Dresser1*, b. 1605 Skewsby, Grimstone, Yorkshire, England and his wife Mary, b. 1609, were one of those families that sailed from Hull, England, on the ship \"John\" of London for America. Among the cargo on the ship \"John\" was the first printing press to reach America from England.\n\nThey arrived in Salem, Massachusetts, on October 10, 1638, where they spent the winter. In May of 1639, these people purchased 3000 acres of land between Ipswich and Newburyport, Massachusetts from the Massachusetts Bay Company for about 800 pounds and established a settlement known as \"Rogers Settlement\". Rogers leadership prevailed in this colony for 22 years. He died and was buried in the Rowley Cemetery in 1660 at the age of 70.\n\nLater, it was named Rowley in memory of Rowley, England, from where they had recently come.\n\nBetween 1620 and 1640 about 4000 families entered America in search of political and religious freedom during the reigns of James I and Charles I of England. These Rowley settlers were a part of this migration. They soon built many houses (see picture of Dresser Homestead) and were the first people to begin making cloth in the new world.\n\n* Exponent # denotes generations from John Dresser, immigrant from Yorkshire, England.\n\nBold FaceDuane Woodward, Jr. 11 my direct family line.\n\nThus, John Dresser1 was one of the pioneer settlers of Rowley, Massachusetts, and became, it is recorded, \"A man of standing and possessed an excellent estate.\"\n\nAnother line of Dressers began in America with John A. Dreszinski, who was born in Germany in 1882. His two sons, Brune Alexander and Bernard, both emigrated to America in 1912 or 1913. Here they changed their last name to Dresser.\n\nMidway between South Cove and Cottingham in Yorkshire, England stands the old St. Peter Rowley Church built early in the 13th century. Only the church survives today of the old village of Rowley, which had a population of about 150 people in the early part of the 17th century. Services are still held in this church today.\n\nIn 1643, a committee was approved by Freeman of the town toassign and register the \"several lots\" of 1 & 1/2 acres each to the various families. John Dresser1 was assigned one lot on Bradford Street bounded on the south side by Thomas Ellethrop's house lot.\n\nJohn Dresser1 was buried in Rowley, Massachusetts, on 19 APR 1672 in his 67th year. He and Mary had five children:\n\n1. John, Jr.2 b. 1641 m. Martha Thorla 21 NOV 1662 d. 14 MAR 1724.\n\nHe was a Freeholder, Selectman, Tithingman and Rowley Representative to the Massachusetts General Court 1691, 1692, 1700, 1705 and 1706. He was a member of the Governor's Council in 1680 and was at one time Associate Justice of Norfolk County.\n\nHe was a Lieutenant in Rowley Foot Company from 16 OCT 1681 to 1698. In 1687 he, with others, resisted rebellion against \"Taxation without representation.\"\n\nMartha Thorla d. in Rowley 29 JUN 1700. John2 remarried Rebecca Dickson on 7 JUN 1702.

His letter to Major General Warren follows:\n\nTHE RICHMOND CAMPAIGN\n\nReport of Lieutenant George W. Dresser, Fourth U. S. Artillery, Inspector of Artillery, of operations. October 27, 1864\n\nOctober 29, 1864\n\nGENERAL: About 2:30 p.m. October 27, I left Fifth Corps headquarter, near Armstrong's Mill, in company with yourself and staff, joined General Crawford, commanding Third Division, Fifth Corps. Found him with his division, skirmishes engaged, his right flank resting on Hatcher's Run, about on a line with General Griffin's line, and line extending in a westerly direction toward the saw-mill road (the road passing by Dabney's steam- mill), with his left refused to protect left flank. His whole line was advancing. After finding it impossible to get a battery through the thicket, to be poster to enfilade the enemy's line in front of General Griffin on the other side of the run, I started my return to Fifth Corps headquarters. Took a direction nearly due south for a short distance, then bore to my left (east) to follow the banks of the run back to Armstrong's Mill. Skirmishing was going on in front of General Crawford and General Griffin; heard no firing anywhere else. I did not reach the bank of the run. About a quarter of a mile from where I left General Crawford, having passed through a bramble, then dry, but evidently wet after heavy rains, running from west to east, I came upon a trail recently made by passage of column of troops, direction from northwest to southeast, and southeast of the little field, where ambulances were afterward captured, came upon tail of rebel column resting in road, sitting down, arms in their hands and in good order. Supposing them prisoners at first, asked, \"To what regiment do you belong?\" Answer, \"Tenth Alabama.\" Asked, \"Where is your provost guard?\" Answer, \"None here; we are a brigade, Wilcox's old brigade.\" Saw at least two companies. Bore toward the creek until I came into a bramble, similar to one referred to above, then turned short to left, and guided by firing, reached General Crawford. Reported facts, and at General C.'s suggestions, started to Second Corps with Captain Stacey, of Second Corps staff, to report the same to General Meade, reported to be there. Captain S. had just come from Second Corps to report that \"General Hancock was about to try to carry the bridge in his front, and if he (General C.) heard firing in that direction he would know what it was.\" About three minutes after leaving, General C. heard artillery fire. Captain S. remarked, \"The attack is just commencing.\" Took our direction by the firing. Half a mile from General C. met rebel stragglers asking how to get out; told them to follow us. But a few paces farther on was ordered to halt by about a dozen rebel calvary. Thicket very dense, and we on no road. Wheeled about (having been going northwest). Bearing to our right (after wheeling) soon struck a small road. Passing along this about 400 yards, met rebel calvary picket, which we charged past. In a few moments met Major Bingham, of General Hancock's staff, going to tell General Crawford attack had not succeeded; warned him of danger down that road (since have heard that a short distance from where I left him Thirty-ninth North Carolina Infantry took him prisoner); then passed on, captured two ambulances and officers in the little field beyond the Crow house (from Second Corps). I found the right of Second Corps resting at the intersection of road I went up, with the road leading from Boydton pike, near Mrs. Rainey's, the line running along the latter road from the intersection toward the house. Here saw General Mott. He told me the rebels had turned and doubled up his right flank. No infantry firing then. Artillery firing still going on; continued till, on my return, which I commenced as soon as informed that General Meade had gone to Fifth Corps, I had passed Dabney's steam-mill. The road was filled with dead horses and stragglers as far as the mill. Near the edge of the woods (near Armstrong's Mill) I met Captain Gentry, going to General C. with dispatches. Reached General headquarters a little after dark - between 5 and 5:30. I left General C. for Second Corps after 4:16 p.m. Reported facts to General Warren and Meade at headquarters.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nGEO. W.

Will\n\n4. George\n\nThe following is from \"A Pioneer Mother\", a biography written by Elizabeth's daughter, Pearl Anderson:\n\nElizabeth Mae Dresser8 was born in Illinois, May 5,1854. She was the 8th child of her parents, John7 and Jane Dresser.\n\nHer father was a descendent of the Dresser family that migrated to America in 1638, landing on the coast of Massachusetts with other pilgrims of their time.\n\nIn 1856, the Dresser family went to Minnesota and took a homestead in Sibley County, then the frontier of the west. Here her real hardships commenced. The Civil War, following closely upon their period of settlement, made life harder for the pioneer women, for every able bodied man was taken, leaving only the very old, and the very young boys to provide for and protect the women and children.\n\nDuring this trying time, the Indian up-rising, also known as the Minnesota Massacre of 1862, took place. Thus, a double burden was borne by the already over loaded pioneers. The hardships were made more hazardous by the constant fear of Indian raids of the poorly protected little homes.\n\nTwice the Dresser family were forced to leave their farm home just before the harvest season, and seek protection at Fort Ridgley, only to return and find their stock driven off and their fields of grain burned. Fortunately, their buildings were left standing. Upon their second return a sod fort was erected in which several families took refuge until the state militia gained control of the Indian bands and subdued their depredations. This fort was known as \"Fort Dresser\".\n\nIn these environments the little Elizabeth Mae Dresser lived her childhood. When she was eleven years old her mother died (1866), and the burden of keeping house for the family developed upon her young shoulders. Meanwhile, her education was not neglected for she attended the local school and became a proficient pupil in all subjects then taught.\n\nAt the age of 18, Elizabeth went to live with friends in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where she remained until 1857, when she went to Grand Forks, Dakota Territory.\n\nComing from Minneapolis to Grand Forks making the trip partly by train and partly by steamboat, she was married to Ezra Anderson, July 3, 1875 by Rev. G. M. Curl. Mr. Anderson was local agent for an overland stage company at the time of their marriage, and the following year was elected sheriff of Grand Forks County. Grand Forks was then only a small village on the very frontier, and on the out-skirts of civilization.\n\nDuring the years that followed nine children were born to them. Five of them died in infancy. Grief over these little ones remained with Mrs. Anderson as long as she lived. Cold winters, no roads, lack of modern conveniences, no doctors or nurses, the pioneer mother cared for her dying babies, sometimes alone, and sometimes with the help of friends or neighbors.\n\nBravely she met life, and bravely she carried on for the sake of her husband and her other children. She grew to feel that North Dakota was so much a part of her very life that she never left the state except for infrequent visits to her childhood home, always returning with a feeling that she belonged.\n\nShe was called by death January 4, 1930, and a wonderful mother passed away. Her four children are Blanche, Pearl, Will and George.\n\n9. Nelly (or Kelly)8 b. 1857 Dryden, Minnesota\n\n10. Ardell8 unknown date in Dryden, Minnesota\n\n11.

She d. 20 DEC 1965 in Los Angeles\n\n12. Edward A.8 b. 1861 Dryden, Minnesota.\n\nWilliam Clarence8 was b. in Dryden, Minnesota, and was the eleventh child born to John7 and Jane Dresser. When he was five, his parents moved to New Auburn, Minnesota.\n\nThe following is from his hand written autobiography:\n\nBorn AUG 3rd 1858 in Township of Dryden, Sibley County, Minn. When 5 years of age my parents moved to New Auburn, same co. and state.\n\nAttended district schools until 12 years of age. At 12 commenced to work on farm of my brother-in-law, Norman Hubbard. Wages $10.00 a month. Attended school during winter months. At 14 went to Minneapolis, attending school six months, after which I commenced to learn the mechanist trade in the shops of Walker Bros., same city.\n\nBecoming dissatisfied with that kind of work - after serving one and a half years, quit the job and went to Illinois to live with uncle Elijah Dresser7 on his farm near Lindenwood, Ogle County, attending school during the winters of 1875 and 1876 and working on farm during summer months.\n\nNot content in that state, I returned to the old house in mid September 1877- visited there a while and in Oct. went to Grand Forks, Dakota.\n\nDec. 1877 went to Bismarck, Dakota. Aug 1879 left Bismarck by steamer and stage for miles City, Montana, where I worked for a few weeks prior to going into the hunting business at the Little Porcupine Camp, 40 miles up the Yellowstone River, filing on 200 acres of land adjoining the Jackson Ranch.\n\nMay 1880 - went overland with covered wagon to Bozman, Montana (300 miles west) with another rancher and bought 125 head of cattle- (my share- only 25 head)\n\nWinter of 1879-'80 and '81 engaged in hunting buffalo, etc.\n\nBecoming tired of frontier life, I sold out my small interests- relinquished my homestead rights and returned to Minn. returning to New Auburn all fall and part of winter. Then going to Grand Forks, Dakota in March 1882, where I purchased 160 acres 12 miles out. Made final proof in six months. Rented some land in spring of 1884. Went to work in attorney's office in Grand Forks (loans and investments for E. L. Emory).\n\n1886 - head collector for McBride Collection Agency for 2 years - till Feb. 1888. March 1888 - went to New Rockford, North Dakota and opened up an office - General collections and loans - fairly successful. Sold out Spring 1891 and went to Duluth, Minn., where I engaged in promoting two or more mining companies.\n\n1893 was forced to go to work for salary for Buford & Burrell C. of St. Paul. Worked at that for about one year, then moved back to New Rockford, ND, where I went into partnership with W. O. Baird under the firm name of \"The Baird and Dresser Land Co.\" - Real Estate loan and collection business.\n\nAfter New Rockford organized as a city I was appointed city auditor, and, later on, police magistrate, holding the two offices several years.\n\nDec. 1924 moved to Los Angeles, CA where we still reside at 5939 Monte Vista. Engaged in the real estate business.\n\nWilliam 8 and Ada had seven children:\n\n1. William Ernest 9 b. 31 Mar 1893 Duluth, Minnesota d. 14 JUN 1973\n\n2. Grace Woodward9 b.
