        "text": "THEODORE DREISER At the Gates of the City 1871-1907. By Richard Lingeman. Illustrated. 478 pp. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. $22.95.\n\nTHIS first volume of Richard Lingeman's two-part biography of Theodore Dreiser reaches only seven years beyond the initial publication of ''Sister Carrie,'' when, in the wake of early neglect, the book was successfully reissued. Its 1907 revival - and victorious arrival - is an appropriate biographical climax. A first novel by the son of a German Catholic immigrant, ''Sister Carrie'' is also the first recognizably ''American'' novel - American in the way we feel it now. Springing up in a period when the novel's tone was governed chiefly by aristocrats of English-speaking stock - William Dean Howells, Edith Wharton, Henry James - Dreiser's driven prose uncovers the unmistakable idiom of a raw Chicago and the New York of dumbwaiters and flophouses. To find one's way into the streets and flats of Dreiser's two cities is to experience the unfolding of literary history - to see how the English novel, itself an immigrant, finally pocketed its ''papers'' and became naturalized.\n\nBut to enter these cramped flats and teeming streets is to re-experience personal history as well. Dreiser's salesmen and managers, his factory girls and $2-a-week boarders, his images of shirtwaists, sweatshops, horsecars, are the fabric of our grandparents' world; we know it with the kind of intimacy we cannot bring to Hawthorne's Puritans or James's high-caste international visitors. ''Sister Carrie'' is a turn-of-the-century vat boiling with the hot matter - and cold materialism - of old Broadway, West Side apartment houses newly built, glimmers of restaurants, hotels and theaters that once were remote names out of newspapers in our own households. Unless you are descended from John Quincy Adams - unless no one in your family ever passed through Castle Garden - ''Sister Carrie,'' read now and for the first time, is an oddly private voyage home: a time machine into the harrowings of an era not yet dimmed, when jobs meant unbroken drudgery and when the eight-hour working day, Social Security and publicly funded relief were futuristic socialist visions. Into just such confrontations and predicaments our immigrant relations tumbled.\n\nRichard Lingeman's impressive marshalings build toward the consummation of this landmark work, and if a new life of Dreiser needs any justification at all, then the unremitting veracity and inclusiveness of ''Sister Carrie'' are reason enough. It is strengthening to Mr. Lingeman's undertaking that he is preceded by an already admirable procession of biographers and critics - among the latter the late Ellen Moers, unsurpassed in robust Dreiserian advocacy. Still, a fresh biography becomes a necessity only if more life is imagined for it, more than there was before. Biography remains, after all, the one form where the chronological empowerment of character, in the way of the 19th-century novel, continues to dominate - with the difference, of course, that the life in it is ''real.'' Some biographies require no successors - Leon Edel's ''Henry James'' springs to mind - because their subjects are permeated with the conviction of sufficiency. It is not that they have been recorded merely; they have ''come to life,'' and break through the page once and for all. In this sense there is still plenty of room, and opportunity, for the psychological illumination of Theodore Dreiser - for a biography with the blood-force of a novel.\n\nMr. Lingeman, a cultural historian whose last book, ''Small Town America,'' combined economics, litera-ture, sociology and history, is an ardent explorer of background, context, milieu. ''Theodore Dreiser'' is scrupulously, massively - devotedly - constructed; everything is in it, including a clear passion for the social issues of the period. And it is immaculately rendered, free of tendentiousness of any kind. But it is an expository library construction, not an elastically breathing imaginative reanimation. The great Dreiserian riddle is not even so much as approached, still less appraised: how is it that a workhorse daily journalist - a needy and febrile Grub Street factotum grinding out newspaper copy at fire-truck speed - could transform himself into a novelist of such encompassing gritty recalcitrant power? Mr. Lingeman asserts this miracle without examining it. ''Dreiser's great strength,'' he tells us at the halfway mark, ''is his empathy with his characters, which reaches its peak [ in ''Sister Carrie'' ] in the final scenes about Hurstwood. In the supreme effort to make believable the climactic downfall of this, the most strongly imagined figure in the book, Dreiser became Hurstwood, producing his every thought, his every emotion, from inside himself.'' (That Dreiser would become Hurstwood again later on, and far less metaphorically, is a vivid connection with the future Mr. Lingeman crucially lets slip.) Yet Mr. Lingeman, from inside himself, offers no comparable becoming. His Dreiser is for the most part a product of strong information, not strong imagining. Hence ''Theodore,'' as Mr. Lingeman calls his subject - with undelivered intimations of insight - remains just that: a subject, a datum on the surface of the text. Theodore - the living Dreiser - is not exactly there. But his evidences are everywhere, and they are rich and dense. A biography of information is not overwhelmingly inferior to a biography of psychological re-creation; and flashy re-creation (such a thing is possible) without the dedicated accumulation of a store of diligent accuracies is a cheat. Mr. Lingeman's biography of information is never a cheat. On the contrary. Such patient assimilation of old and new particularity not only earns our homage, but, on its own terms, exhilarates. Once warned that Theodore - Dreiser as mind - is not exactly there, we can marvel at what is. AND what is there, punctiliously there, is a chronicle of emergence - of an especially American kind. Dreiser was an obsessive reader of Balzac, but his own story is tonally different from that of Balzac's young man from the provinces who sets out to seize literary fame in the glorious city. In much of Dreiser's America, city and boondocks were alike in newness and rootlessness; both were more provisional than traditional, more contingent than composed. The Midwest was only just fashioning itself; a family line was often no longer than a single generation. Dreiser's father was himself, to use that striking old immigrant's tag, right off the boat; his English was never unblemished. All 10 of his children (Theodore was the ninth) were given combinations of names that would have been more at home in his native Mayen in Alsace-Lorraine than in Terre Haute, Ind. All the children eventually Anglicized their Christian names - Alphons Joachim, for instance, became Al -and the oldest, Johann Paul Jr., changed Dreiser to Dresser and ended as Paul Dresser, the celebrated songwriter. The mother of this first-generation family came of an earlier German-American migration. A Mennonite, she abandoned the ''plain people'' strictures of her sect and converted to Roman Catholicism to please her rigidly devout husband.\n\nContinued on page 29 These shifts of vowels and allegiances, these fresh and strange alliances, would have been unthinkable in any society less bent on mutation. Emerging from the American backwater was not so much a matter of making one's way as it was of finding a way to make oneself up. Dreiser was determined to emerge - he allowed himself no other course - because he was born, so to speak, sunk. His father, a wool worker, rose briefly to mill manager and then, after a head injury, descended into unbalanced religious fanaticism and irreversible joblessness and poverty. The mother moved the children from Hoosier town to Hoosier town, taking in washing and boarders. Dreiser's brother Paul sang in blackface and for a time lived with the madam of a prosperous bordello. Dreiser's sisters went off to be ''kept.'' One gave birth to an out-of-wedlock child. Another, Emma, fled first to Canada and then to New York with a Chicago thief and absconder named Hopkins: the flagrant domestic seed of ''Sister Carrie.'' In New York, Hopkins, like the fictional Hurstwood, collapsed into indigent apathy. So, finally, did Dreiser's father. Respectability was no part of Dreiser's family inheritance; he grew up on the underside, among the spurned. At 20 he stole money to buy himself an overcoat. If, in later years, he wrote with a journalist's detachment of the ''curious shifts of the poor,'' it was nevertheless out of bitter familiarity. For Dreiser, being poor was life, not hypothesis. THE instruments of his emergence were two. The first was social gentility: Sara White, nicknamed Jug, the woman he romantically fixed on to marry (he went on dreaming and letter-writing through a drawn-out courtship), belonged to a prominent small-town Missouri family of transplanted Virginia aristocrats. The second instrument was journalism. Dreiser's climb from legman to freelance to full-time reporter to ''magazinist'' to editor, with pratfalls and loss of footing along the way, is the sovereign thread of Mr. Lingeman's narrative. It includes Dreiser's peculiarly dependent friendship -an entrance into psychological twinship - with his fellow journalist Arthur Henry: ''If he had been a girl, I would have married him,'' Dreiser once remarked. Instead, Henry moved in with the newlyweds, Dreiser and Jug, on West 102d Street, and the pair - Dreiser and Henry - formed a writing partnership, sharing assignments and fees. The summer before, they had shared Henry's house on the idyllic Maumee, in Ohio. Urged on by Henry -with whom he eventually broke - Dreiser began writing his first fiction.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
