Dodge Daily Chronicle reported:\n\nFOREWARNED BUT HEEDLESS\n\nYoung Couple Make Wills Before Going Aboard Eastland\n\nStrange presentiments and forebodings of the Eastland disaster were repeated in the silences about the biers in Cicero, Hawthorne, and Morton park yesterday. One unheeded warning to a young married couple particularly was on every one's lips.\n\nThis was so uncanny a firsthand investigation was made to find just how plainly the fates had spoken. The young couple had been so sure of death they had made their wills before going aboard the Eastland.\n\nTheir little flat is now locked and empty, for the young bridegroom and bride are side by side in the morgue. But Mrs. Paul Altman, the landlady at 4817 West 22nd Street, was found.\n\n\"Both had a dread of the boat,\" said Mrs. Altman. \"Now they are dead. They were married just six weeks, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Janke, and they were so happy, Friday night when Mrs. Janke was fussing over the lunch, she stopped and expressed a fear that something would happen to the boat.\"\n\n\"Later Mr. Janke rang my bell. 'Here is my key and the $50 for my mother if we don't come back from the trip,' he said.\"\n\n\"I still have their key. Their relatives came this morning and opened the flat. They found a letter on the dresser and also a will. Mrs. Janke wished that her mother might have her bracelet and rings and I gave them the money. Both bodies were shipped to New Hampton, IA, yesterday.\"\n\n\"Her father had the same kind of presentiment, he said, and warned the young couple to keep off the boat. That is why he did not go - because of his foreboding of evil.\"\n\nCopyright © Ft. Dodge Daily Chronicle\n\nreprinted from the Ft.
