        "text": "A couple of emails about the Gillette murder case today and a discussion with my wife got me thinking about Dreiser and his novels.\n\nThe chief influence on Dreiser the novelist — at the outset — was Balzac, not Zola. The influence of novels like The Wild Ass’s Skin and Père Goriot was immense.\n\nIt has been long known that Sister Carrie was Dreiser’s reworking of true story involving his sister Emma and Lorenzo A. Hopkins, the prototype of George Hurstwood.\n\nThe story was not an obscure one. Hopkins’s theft from his employer Chapin & Gore (not Fitzgerald and Moy’s, as most people who get their facts from Dreiser’s novel assume) was headline news at the time.\n\nIt will probably sound as if I am showing off, but it is apparent to me how often it’s the case that literary scholars and biographers never go much deeper than the author’s works and published information — i.e., secondary sources — in their research; never look elsewhere for critical information.\n\nThis was the case with my discoveries about Lorenzo A. Hopkins — the real George Hurstwood. He died in Brooklyn, where he was working as a bartender. He did not go back to his wife in Chicago, as some writers have speculated. (Most biographers, to their credit, dismissed this.)\n\nHe had one daughter about whom I found some facts in census and other records, including her marriage record. Her name was Maria and she was married in 1900 at the age of 30. She would have been age 19 at the time of Hopkins’s theft.\n\nNo one ever bothered to find out what happened to the real Mrs. Hurstwood: Margaret (Menkler) Hopkins. I found two key records: her suit for divorce from Hopkins; and her subsequent marriage to Alfred D. Lutz, president of the Acme Copying Company in Chicago, in 1892.\n\nMargaret Lutz was murdered by Alfred Lutz’s brother Charles in 1900, subsequent to a dispute he had with Maragret and his brother Charles over his employment at the firm. Margaret took an active interest in the business.\n\nNone of this was known before.\n\nNo one bothered to try and find the real identity of “Don Ashley” — the lover, in Warsaw, Indiana, of Theodore Dreiser’s jilted sister Sylvia — or the death of Sylvia’s abandoned son Carl Dresser, a bellhop, in Chicago; and possible connections (in Dreiser’s mind) with the fictional Chicago bellhop Clyde Griffiths, and perhaps, in Carl’s mind (he died of asphyxiation from illuminating gas), with Hurstwood’s suicide in Sister Carrie.\n\nMarie Pergain and the toothpick incident\n\nThere is loads of information about her. She was a lounge singer and (briefly) a concert pianist; a silent movie actress; and the lover of the Hungarian pianist Ervin Nyiregyházi, whom both Deriser and Helen knew well.\n\n“Marie Pergain—possibly a fictitious name” — Swanberg\n\n“Marie Pergain, probably a pseudonym” — Lingeman\n\n“Miss Pergain’s identity has been a mystery, with many commentators on Dreiser’s Harlan experience holding that since she doesn’t seem to exist outside of that occasion, her name is probably a pseudonym. The mystery has been cleared up. …” — Donald Pizer, “John Dos Passos and Harlan: Three Variations on a Theme,” Arizona Quarterly, Spring 2015\n\n(No acknowledgment of my groundbreaking article.)\n\n“A platinum-blonde Hollywood bit player in the late 1920s who was also a serious student of the piano, Marie Pergain (1911–51) was Nyiregyházi’s mistress in Los Angeles for several years. She met Dreiser in New York in 1930 and began a relationship with him that lasted until early 1932.” — Pizer, Op. cit.\n\nPizer jauntily throws out these facts, as if they were discovered by him. He barley acknowledges his sources.\n\n— posted by Roger W Smith\n\nApril 2024\n\n*****************************************************\n\nSee:\n\nLorenzo A.

Smith\n\n*****************************************************\n\nRevealing Dreiser’s 10-Year Love Secret\n\nFirst Details of the Mysterious Second Marriage of the Eminent Novelist\n\nBy Laura Lou Brookman\n\nSo Theodore Dreiser has been happily married all these years and virtually nobody guessed it?\n\nIt took Dreiser, America’s frankest and, many say, foremost, novelist, to prove that a celebrity can have a private life. He did it by marrying a movie actress!\n\nFantastic? Well, that’s the way it happened. And not until Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, the former Helen Richardson of the movies, began singing with Enoch Light’s orchestra in a New York restaurant, was anyone aware that there WAS a Mrs. Dreiser, other than the novelist’s first wife, from whom he separated years ago.\n\nThe novelist and the movie actress were married in California “between 10 and 15 years ago.”\n\n“We kept our marriage quiet for certain reasons,” says the pretty, brown haired, slightly buxom Mrs. Dreiser. “There was a Mexican divorce in Mr. Dreiser’s first marriage.”\n\nNot so successful has Dreiser been in the public eye on other occasions. There were the times, for instance, when he:\n\n(1) Faced court charges that his first novel was “lewd” and “profane.”\n\n(2) Went to Russian, wrote a book about it, and was accused of plagiarism by Dorothy Thompson, wife of Sinclair Lewis.\n\n(3) Had a fight with Nobel-Prize-winning Novelist Sinclair Lewis at a dinner party.\n\n(4) Went with a committee of New York liberals to investigate labor conditions in the Kentucky coal fields, and was put on the spot by local authorities, who accused him of doing his investigating in a hotel room with a pretty member of the committee.\n\n(5) Appealed to courts to prevent the release of the film version of his novel “American Tragedy.”\n\nThese are just a few of the highlights in the stormy career of the dynamic novelist and playwright who now is 66 years old. His home is a rustic retreat at Mount Kisco, N. Y.\n\nDreiser’s complete reticence about his present marriage is all the more remarkable because of the detailed frankness with which he has described personal affairs heretofore.\n\nParticularly outspoken was his response to charges made against him and ___ [illegible] Marie Pergain when they, with a party of others, made that trip to the Harlan County, Kentucky, coal fields in 1931.\n\nA grand jury indicted them on grounds of misconduct and won the praise of fellow townspeople resentful of the “interference” of the easterners in local labor affairs.\n\nSaid Dreiser: “If I were in a silk-hung boudoir with the most beautiful woman in the world and the door was locked, noting would follow but esthetic conversation.”\n\nWitnesses who appeared before the grand jury testified that they had seen Miss Pergain enter Dreiser’s hotel room at 11 p.m. They were sure she had not emerged by 3. a.m. because they had placed toothpicks against the door and the toothpicks were still standing at that time.\n\nTo this the novelist replied: “I want to assure all persons of both sexes of my inescapable private morality.\n\n“What is this toothpick game? I’d like to know. If the toothpicks are up you’re guilty. If they’re down you’re all right. Evidently mine were up.”\n\nWarrants of arrest were never served, because both Dreiser and Miss Pergain were outside Kentucky by that time.\n\nDreiser’s first marriage – to Sarah Osborne White of St. Louis – took place in 1898. He was then a reporter and he met Miss White, a school teacher, when his newspaper sent her and other winners of a popularity victory contest to the Columbia Exposition in Chicago. Dreiser went along to report their adventures.\n\nHe described his schoolteacher sweetheart thus:\n\n“There was something of the wood or water nymph about her, a seeking in her eyes, a breath of wild winds in her hair, a scarlet glory to her mouth … If only this love affair could have gone on to a swift fruition it would have been perfect, blinding. … But love, as it is in most places, was a slow process. … There must be many visits before I could place on arm on her. .. Well, I reached the place where I could hold her hand, put my arms about her, kiss her, but never could I induce her to sit on my lap.”\n\nAfter Dreiser left St. Louis for New York to work on newspapers and magazines, Miss White came east and they were married. It was a union that proved far from smooth. Dreiser’s fortunes ebbed and rose and ebbed again.\n\nWhen he became editor-in-chief of Butterick Publications, including five fashion magazines, he seemed to be getting up in the world. From this post he was discharged abruptly, following an incident said to have involved a pretty secretary. Dreiser has denied this, saying he left of his own accord.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dreiser separated permanently in 1909. A friend who knew them well said:\n\n“One night I went to see them up on Morningside Drive. There they were in the dining room. She was sprinkling clothes on the same table where he was correcting proof. I felt a lack of understanding in that. He, on the other hand, was subject to fits of terrible depression.”\n\nBy that time Dreiser had already made his mark among discriminating critics as an author of realistic novels of great power, but had not achieved public popularity.\n\nHowever, he had enough money to make a trip to Europe in 1912, and there he met Ellen Adams Wrynn, the painter, who is credited with considerable influence on his later writing and success. She is one of the women included in his frank and revealing book, “A Gallery of Women.”\n\nOf her he said:\n\n“She was one of those women where I lost out. She didn’t want me, that is, not until year later, and then I wouldn’t have her. She was just the same, but it is a rule with me not to moon over anyone.”\n\nBetween 1914 and 1919 Dreiser published eight books and made a bare living. After that he went to California, wrote another book, “A American Tragedy,” and — almost without knowing how it happened – found himself affluent, his books on best seller lists, and offers for screen and stage rights mounting to fabulous sums.\n\nHe took a handsome Manhattan apartment on 57th street and there, for five years, on Thursday nights New York’s ultra-sophisticated set used to gather – novelists, poets, singers, dancers, editors, critics – to talk and hear Dreiser talk.\n\nNot all of them knew the story of that apartment – the story of the Face Across the Street.\n\nIt was a woman’s face, and it was always there at the same window. When Theodore Dreiser went in or out of the building, when he welcomed guests, and when he saw them depart, the woman’s face was always there.\n\nThere was no particular expression on the face. It was just watching.\n\nIt was the face of Sarah Osborne White Dreiser, the novelist’s first wife.\n\nShe had taken the apartment across the street so that never, for one moment, could her former husband forget her.\n\nIt was about the time that the film version of “An American Tragedy” was produced. Dreiser saw it. declared it misrepresented the meaning of his novel, and brought suit to prevent the picture’s release. The attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nFinally, in 1931, after a trip to Russia, Dreiser gave up the 57th street apartment for an estate at Mt. Kisco.\n\n“I’m going to leave New York,” he said. “I used to love to walk these streets, but now they are too miserable. They are meaningless. I can’t bear the brick or the cement or the color or lack of color that goes to make up the city. New York is a handsome woman with a cruel mouth.”\n\nCould it have been the Face at the Window across the street of which he was thinking?\n\nWomen seem to have been involved, almost invariably, in Theodore Dreiser’s long series of difficulties.\n\nThe fray in which the eminent novelist smacked the equally eminent Sinclair Lewis was a sequel to charges of Lewis’ wife, Miss Thompson, that Dreiser had plagiarized material from her writings in his volume on Russia.\n\nMiss Thompson never actually brought suit, but the affair made headlines. A little later Lewis and Dreiser met at a dinner party for a group of literati. Lewis, asked to make a speech, refused, saying, “There are three men here who are antagonistic to me and whom I don’t like.”\n\n“Who are the other two?” Dreiser demanded.\n\nLewis answered – and was slapped twice. Said Dreiser afterward, “The two slaps I gave Lewis were the only possible answer to a vile insult. I consider the incident closed.”\n\nSaid Lewis, “it’s a shame two gentlemen can’t have a private squabble without letting the world in on it.”\n\nIt was during his stay in California from 1919 to 1922 which produced “An American Tragedy” that he met Helen Richardson, his present wife. She was 18 years old (about half his age), young and beautiful.\n\nFor Dreiser, Miss Richardson gave up her plans for a career. Today she says, “I always wanted to sing, but I felt I couldn’t leave Mr. Dreiser. Now when he talks about committing suicide I know he’ll change his mind as soon as he’s had his breakfast coffee. He’s a wonderful man – after breakfast.”\n\nHer husband has no objections to her present work, since he has always believed that when anyone has an urge to express himself he should do so.\n\nMrs. Dreiser has written one manuscript, but hasn’t any intention of trying to make a name for herself as a writer. “Mr. Dreiser,” she says, “is enough writer for 10 families.”\n\nShe is amused when mistaken for the novelist’s daughter – as she has been frequently. She describes herself as “a tragic person,” given either to a great deal of gaiety or deep depression. She is domestic, likes to cook and care for a home, but is well pleased to be setting out on a new career."
