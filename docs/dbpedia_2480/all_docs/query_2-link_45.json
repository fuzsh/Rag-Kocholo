WABASH SOUTHLAND SHOPPING CENTER MEADOWS SHOPPING CENTER Dresser Portrait Donated for Home By Et'LETA SLOVEK The imminent realization of permanent Terre Haute memorial to Paul Dresser, beloved native son and internationally acclaimed song- writer who brought fame to the city and immortalized the Wabash River, continues to bring financial gifts from far and near as well as treasured keepsakes. One such memento of the bygone era in which Dresser lived was contributed to the Vigo County Historical Society last week and another is expected in the near future, according to Mrs. Robert I .\n\nClark, chairman of the society-sponsored Paul Dresser Birthplace Preservation Committee. The article given is a large oil painting of Dresser turned out some 30 or 40 years ago by the late Frank Erxleben, son of one of Terre German immigrant families of more than 100 years ago. The painting was donated by his widow, Mrs. Elsie Erxleben, resident of 1340 Liberty avenue, and his daughter, Mrs. Max F .\n\nWalker of 2205 Putnam street. Wishes of Painter. Mrs. Erxleben said she wished the painting to hang in the Dresser home when it is restored on the northwest corner of First and Farrington streets in Fairbanks Park. The family feels this act would have pleased the creator of the painting who often had refused to sell it, stating that want the painting to leave Terre Members of the committee report that $2,030.76 has been raised through public contributions toward the $5,000 to $6,000 needed to move the Dresser birthplace from its present location at 318 South Second street to the park memorial site .\n\nIn connection with the City Park granting of a 50-year, rent-free lease on the 200 foot square site and the City Department of agreement to purchase the house and sell it to the society for a $1 token fee. Mrs. Erxleben and others are joining the move to as- aemble all Dresser mementos under one roof. The painting was partially done from Mr. ory of Dresser, whom he knew as a neighborhood chum and later as a friend and close companion .\n\nIt depicts a head and chest portrait of Dresser before a background of the moonlight showered Wabash flowing along Sycamore lined banks. The other painting is of Eugene V. Debs, American Socialist leader, who was also born in Terre Haute (1855-1926) and with whom Mr. Erxleben. also enjoyed a close friendship .\n\nDebs, twice elected Terre Haute city clerk and a member of the Indiana Legislature in 1885, organized the American Railway Union, served as its president for four years and led the 1894 strike that resulted in his arrest and six months imprisonment for a contempt of court. In 1897, he joined the Socialist movement and was the candidate for President of the United States from 1900 through 1912. He declined the 1916 nomination. He edited numerous Socialist and union publications and was an advocate of industrial unionism. Both paintings are enclosed in walnut frames that have been in the Erxleben family for nearly 200 years .\n\nThey were brought to this country' more than 100 years ago by Mr. parents, then holding original oil paintings of Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph and his empress. During World War public sentiment forced the family to store the paintings in a barn and the musty conditions eventually deteriorated the canvasses beyond repair. However, the frames were preserved and restored for the Dresser and Debs creations. Mr .\n\nErxleben studied art at the Chicago Art Institute and later turned his talents to sculpturing, finally evolving his ability into the then very new art of concrete sculpturing of garden statues. When the facade of the old Post Office Building was moved to the Dresser Drive area in the establishment of the Chauncey Rose Memorial, the adorning eagles were damaged. The city fathers reportedly called upon Mr. talents to fashion replacement guardians of the monument. CHURCH OF CHRIST SCHOOL TO OPEN ONLY OIL OF DRESSER IN EXISTENCE DONATED TO Elsie Erxleben (right) and her daughter, Mrs .\n\nMax Walker, librarian at the Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library, display unique painting of Paul Dresser done by their late husband and father and which they have donated to the Vigo County Historical Society and the Wabash Valley Museum. It will be hung in the Paul Dresser home when it is moved from 318 South Second street and restored on the memorial site in Fairbanks Park. Photo by Martin. Numerous efforts were made during the lifetime to purchase the paintings, particularly the one of Dresser, which family sources accredited as the only oil portrait of the songwriter.
