The Woodrow Wilson Birthplace sits on a gorgeous crest in Staunton’s Gospel Hill. Today, it is the site of the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum. This is a fun place for all ages to visit and tour.

The birthplace of the 28th president of the United States of America is filled with historical exhibitions which showcase Wilson’s formidable years. Other galleries and exhibits are devoted to his presidency, the suffrage movement, prohibition and WWI. All total, there are seven galleries to explore. You can view the restored 1919 Pierce-Arrow limousine, see what a WWI trench was really like complete with lights and sounds from the battlefield, and view authentic weaponry that was used at the time.

The home itself is a spectacularly restored Greek Revival manse. Manse? Yes, the home is called a ‘manse’ as it is designated by the Presbyterian Church. Wilson’s father was the Reverend Joseph Ruggles Wilson, a pastor and professor. They moved to the home in March of 1855 and Woodrow Wilson was born there, in the home, on December 28, 1856. Period antiques and artifacts that belonged to the family can all be viewed.
