        "text": "Overlooked by tourists and snubbed by New Yorkers as the place located on the other side of the Hudson, Hoboken boasts quite a remarkable history that goes well beyond being the birthplace of Sinatra and home to the best freshly-made mozzarella this side of the Atlantic.\n\n17th century to the American Revolution\n\nLocated on the bluff of green-colored serpentine rock, Hoboken was first spotted by Henry Hudson’s navigator in 1609.\n\nThe origin of the name Hoboken is unknown, but you are welcome to pick a theory. One is that Native Americans referred to the area as Hobocan Hackingh, meaning “Land of the Tobacco Pipe” since the stone was used to carve pipes for smoking tobacco. Or it’s simply a corruption of the Native American place name Hopaghan. A third theory is that settlers named it after the Flemish town Hoboken outside Antwerp.\n\nThe land came into possession of William Bayard, whose country estate on Castle Point was burned down during the Revolutionary War. Since Bayard was a loyalist, he fled the country, and the State of New Jersey seized the property.\n\nFrom the 1780s to 1820s\n\nThis is the point when the story of Hoboken starts in earnest. In 1784 the land confiscated by the Revolutionary government of the state of NJ was sold at a public auction to Colonel Stevens.\n\nStevens — a revolutionary hero, the Treasurer of New Jersey, and an inventor extraordinaire — moved his family to a new mansion on Castle Point in 1814, making Hoboken his permanent home.\n\nBefore the 18th century was over, Colonel Stevens established America’s first patent law, imported camellias and chrysanthemums from England to be cultivated in America, and launched “Hoboken Turtle Club” — the first American social club, whose members included John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr.\n\nColonel Stevens met the dawn of the 19th century by designing the first steamboat and sending it on the first-ever ocean voyage. He followed it up by establishing the world’s first commercial steamboat ferry running from Manhattan to Hoboken.\n\nBy the 1820s, Stevens transformed the Hoboken waterfront from a rustic promenade into one of the largest pleasure grounds in the country, visited by as many as 20,000 people a day!\n\nFrom the 1820s to 1855\n\nHoboken of the first part of the 19th century became quite a destination: its riverfront with its Sybil’s Cave drew thousands of pleasure-seekers, John Jacob Astor built a summer home in Hoboken, and Napoleon III, the future emperor of France, chose Hoboken as his American residence in exile.\n\nColonel Stevens founded the Hoboken Land and Improvement Company, which laid out a regular system of streets on an orderly street grid punctuated with parks.\n\nAt this time, the first ferry slip, which became a standard worldwide, as well as the first steam railroad, were designed in Hoboken. Another notable: the first yacht club in the US – New York Yacht Club – was formed in Hoboken.\n\nThe event that put Hoboken in the national spotlight was the baseball game played on June 19, 1846. For the first time in history, the game, which later became the most favorite American pastime, was organized and played according to the rules and is since considered the birth of modern baseball.\n\nFrom 1855 – the End of WW1\n\nThe city entered a different chapter from a vacation spot/pleasure ground to a bustling industrial port. Continental European shipping lines, competing with British ones for the New York market, found abundant space along the Hudson in Hoboken. Hoboken established itself as a major transportation center and a port for trans-Atlantic shipping lines, including such giants as Holland America, North German Lloyd, and Hamburg-American.\n\nHoboken’s harbor became an essential dock for German shipping vessels carrying goods and bringing immigrants. A German immigrant population became so significant that people referred to Hoboken as little Bremen. The Irish and later Italians followed the Germans.\n\nThe primary industry during Hoboken’s industrial days was shipbuilding, but at various times the city was home to major industries with household names: Lipton Tea, Maxwell House Coffee, Wonder Bread, and Hostess. The Tootsie Roll, slide rule, zipper, and ice cream cone were all born in Hoboken.\n\nHoboken was incorporated as a city in 1855, and its population exploded from under 3,000 people in 1850 to 10,000 in 1860 to 20,000 in 1870. By virtue of its role as a gateway to America and the presence of so many small factories, Hoboken snowballed to 70,000 in 1910!\n\nIn 1917, the Federal government chose Hoboken as the primary port of embarkation for the troops in World War I. As some two million American troops boarded the vessels headed to the front, General Pershing declared: “Haven, Hell or Hoboken by Christmas .”\n\nPresident Wilson declared war on Germany and seized German liners and German property on the waterfront under eminent domain. The Hoboken Germans were deported or sent to Ellis Island.\n\nFrom the 1920s – 1970s\n\nAfter the Germans left Hoboken, its population was dominated by the Irish, but then came the Italians…\n\nThe most famous Hoboken son, an American icon, the most celebrated Italian American — Frank Sinatra, was born and started his legendary music journey in Hoboken.\n\nIn the 1920s, Hoboken’s character changed to somewhat more frivolous. The town attracted bohemian crowds and developed quite a theater scene. One New York producer proclaimed Hoboken the “Last Seacoast of Bohemia.” During the 1920s, when Prohibition was the law, it was happily ignored and essentially unenforced in Hoboken, gaining our little town a reputation as a den of vice. According to a contemporary newspaper, “Jazz bands spoil a ‘quiet glass of beer’.”\n\nThe Decline of the economy caused by the commercial freeze of its piers during World War I led to a lack of employment and horrible corruption in Hoboken’s shipyards. This unfortunate chapter in the city’s history, once again, put Hoboken in the national spotlight. Film director Elia Kazan shot his masterpiece “On the Waterfront” in Hoboken. Not only was it the first American film shot entirely on the location, but it also received twelve Academy Award nominations and won eight, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Director for Kazan.\n\nThe 1960s\n\nIn the late 1960s, after the shipping industry left Hoboken, many major factories such as Lipton and Keuffel & Esser also left. The Erie Lackawanna Railroad ceased its ferry service across the Hudson to New York. Hoboken waterfront fell into disrepair, and many of Hoboken’s industries moved away or closed up shop. The city was considered something of a post-industrial wasteland.\n\nFortunately, such places are beloved by creative types. Hoboken was discovered by artists escaping high Manhattan prices. An intact 19th-century city with an easy connection to NYC by the path and cheap rents was quite a find.\n\nThe 1970s to the Present\n\nIn the 1970s, people began to notice Hoboken’s then-affordable, beautiful brownstones in such close proximity to the city. In the 1990s, a major waterfront renovation project turned old abandoned piers into beautiful parks. Manhattan-based companies began to see the city as a viable alternate office location.\n\nNow Hoboken is a vibrant little town with the energy that matches its neighbor across the Hudson. No longer a bargain, it has fancy hotels, a plethora of eating establishments, and its real estate has become rather expensive.\n\nThis is a not-so-brief story of Hoboken, a truly unique little town that went from a quiet village to an exclusive summer resort to pleasure grounds to a major bustling port. The tiny town was once the most densely populated place in the United States and a major industrial center. Hoboken was a point of embarkation of American troops to WWI, a city of immigrants, and the birthplace of Frank Sinatra. It was called the gateway to America and was thrown into the national spotlight more than once. A stone’s throw away from Manhattan with its sweeping views, gorgeous waterfront, and with its brownstone-lined streets, it still retains its 19th-century charm.\n\nHoboken timeline\n\n1609 – First mentioned by Henry Hudson, noticed for white/greenish stone color\n\n1630 – The land across from New Amsterdam was acquired from West India Company for private ownership.
