        "text": "Monday is Presidents Day, so why don't we take a closer look at the one president who actually lived in Wilmington -- Woodrow Wilson, ol' No. 28, who served from 1913-1921.\n\n1. His father, Joseph Ruggles Wilson, was pastor of Wilmington's First Presbyterian Church from 1874 to 1882. Young Woodrow, who was born in 1856 in Staunton, Va., lived in Wilmington while taking a year off between his freshman year at Davidson College and his sophomore year, when he transferred to Princeton. (A plaque to Wilson can be found at First Presbyterian.)\n\n2. He was, apparently, the first person to ride a two-wheeled bicycle in Wilmington. (This, from local historian Diane Cashman.)\n\n3. According to biographer Erick Montgomery, Wilson dreamed of going to sea and spent a lot of time sitting down at the Wilmington docks, watching ships.\n\n4. To keep his mind sharp, though, he actually sat in on some classes at Wilmington's Tileston School and was tutored by its headmaster, Amy Bradley.\n\n5. Most people in Wilmington knew him as \"Tom,\" or \"Tommy.\" Thomas was his first name. (According to Montgomery, he didn't start going by \"Woodrow\" until he entered law school, because he thought it sounded more impressive.)\n\n6. Wilson was the only president, so far, to earn a Ph.D.\n\n7. He's one of the most prolific men ever to occupy the Oval Office. His papers fill up 500-plus reels of microfilm in the Library of Congress. Among his works is a long, scholarly book, \"Congressional Government,\" in which he argued that the United States should switch to a parliamentary system like Great Britain's.\n\n8. On the other hand, he didn't learn to read and write until he was 11. (The Civil War was a bit of a distraction.)\n\n9. Wilson married Edith Bolling Galt in 1915, a year after his first wife died. He was one of three presidents to marry while in office. (John Tyler and Grover Cleveland were the other two.)\n\n10. He screened the first film in the White House -- D.W. Griffith's \"Birth of a Nation,\" which he described as \"like writing history with lightning.\" Wilson, who segregated the federal government, approved of the film's pro-Ku Klux Klan story line.\n\n11. He also made the first live remote radio broadcast in 1923, speaking on the Armistice from his Washington home after he left office.\n\n12. An auto enthusiast, he made daily drives around the capital in his beloved Pierce Arrow. He was the first president to advocate federal funding for highways.\n\n13. Entombed in Washington's National Cathedral, Wilson is the only president buried in Washington. (William Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy are buried nearby at Arlington National Cemetery.)"
