        "text": "This article explores German-American war relief for Germany during World War I, concentrating on the period of American neutrality, 1914-17. Based on financial ledgers, meeting protocols and the publications of ethnic organizations, it shows how German-American charity served as a force of mobilization on behalf of the old fatherland after August 1914 even as American public sentiments turned increasingly hostile towards Germany. The article nuances common notions of American humanitarianism during the period of neutrality and broadens our understanding of how German-Americans (and by extension, ethnic groups more generally) tried to balance political loyalty to their \"hostland\" with emotional attachment to their \"homeland.\"\n\nThe pressures of the First World War contributed to a renegotiation of citizenship within the United States as many citizens sought to reinforce and often to prove their loyalty to the state. Wartime developments and political rhetoric exacerbated ethnic tensions, leading many Americans to voluntary vigilant organizations like the American Protective League, an auxiliary organization of the Department of Justice aimed at public surveillance of German-Americans or anyone not contributing to the war effort. Vigilant organizations targeted German ethnicity in New York. Many desired to end Germanic influences by varying means that included abolishing German language education in public schools. Vigilant voluntarism left its mark on the social, cultural, and political lives of German-Americans in New York. Americans of German ethnicity navigated wartime anxiety in differing, often personal, ways, varying from overt expression of loyalty, to voluntary suppression of their heritage. This paper focuses on the culture of vigilance in New York State and provides specific individual German-American responses in New York City. What emerges is a picture of social and cultural adaptation in wartime New York, along with a new understanding of obligations of citizenship during war.\n\nFrom a comprehensive study of the public addresses of Woodrow Wilson in the period following the outbreak of the war in Europe in August 1914 to the war's conclusion in June 1919, this essay examines Wilson's transformation of the long-held vision of America as merely a great example of liberty to its embodiment as the self-sacrificing champion of liberty. It will demonstrate how this transformation of the American \"self\" was inextricably connected to a changing image of the war and the construction of an enemy image of the German government.\n\nThis article examines the history of the Great War in New York City and the means by which it has been remembered and forgotten through the presence and absence of war memorials. New York City played a unique role in the history of the Great War, contributing to the war effort even before the declaration of war by the United States in 1917. The wartime experiences in the city were accompanied by political and racial tensions as fears of foreign influences undermining the city and the wider nation were ever-present. In a city which had witnessed large-scale immigration over the preceding century, fears of unrest or unpatriotic and un-American behaviour preoccupied both the city and the federal government. Nevertheless, the wartime contribution of the city's foreign-born residents was substantial as large numbers registered for military service. As a means of reaffirming the principles of patriotism and an ‘American’ identity for the city, after the Armistice the official bodies and veterans groups worked to develop a singular expression or ‘spirit’ for the local war memorials. As the schemes for a central war memorial for the city floundered, the local memorials served as a means for residents to adopt and adapt this hegemonic expression of ‘American’ identity and form specific memories of the war for each community."
