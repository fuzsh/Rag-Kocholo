        "text": "History\n\nWhile Hoboken and Jersey City are just small pieces of land when it comes to the United States’ geography, we’re no strangers to having presidents visit our area. In honor of President’s Day, we’re taking a trip down memory lane to share the various presidents who have visited Hoboken and Jersey City to show their love for our neck of the proverbial woods — and maybe eat some delicious food, too. Read on to find out more about presidents who have visited Hoboken and Jersey City.\n\nBill Clinton, Barack Obama, + George W. Bush in 2017 + Donald Trump (Date unknown)\n\nIn 2017, former Presidents George Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama joined forces at The President’s Cup at Liberty National Golf Club in Jersey City. The three former Presidents were seen embracing each other in a photo taken with JC Mayor Steven Fulop. The camaraderie shown in this picture restores our faith in politics and reminds us that at the end of the day, we are all just human. The NJ State Golf Association details that Liberty National is one of four golf clubs in the United States to host The President’s Cup, an international golf competition. Former president Donald Trump has also been reported to have visited a course in Jersey City on a separate occasion.\n\nRead More: How These Three Hobokenites Made History in Honor of Black History Month\n\nPresident Joe Biden in 2012\n\nAfter the devastation of Superstorm Sandy, President Joe Biden visited the Mile Square to tour the Hoboken Terminal after suffering severe water damage from all of the flooding. While here, President Biden made sure to stop by the iconic Benny Tudino’s for a slice and even sat down to talk with pizzeria owner, Bari “Benny” Drishti, for a bit — may he rest in peace.\n\nPresident Biden also made it a point to swing by the now-closed Hudson Tavern to visit bar owner Tom Brennan (brother of Former President Obama’s National Security Advisor). In a YouTube video, He was spotted walking outside, interacting with Hoboken residents, and even squeezing in a few selfies at the Hoboken PATH train.\n\nRonald Reagan in 1984\n\nRonald Reagan made his debut in Hoboken at — what better than — the St. Ann’s Italian Festival in 1984 as part of his campaign. As he ate with other Hoboken residents and parish members, he spoke about what led him to Hoboken (if the answer wasn’t zeppoles, then he was duped).\n\nThe invitation to the festival looked so appetizing, however, that he just couldn’t turn it down. Sources say his wife even said to him at one point, “Honey, I think you ought to go to Hoboken.”\n\nAnd although Sinatra already preached about his hometown to Reagan, he felt compelled to pay the Mile Square visit, especially to try one of our famous zeppoles.\n\nWoodrow Wilson in 1919\n\nDuring World War I, Woodrow Wilson and his troops were based out of Hoboken. The Mile Square served as the main port for major shipping and passenger lines. Being a city right on the water was incredibly helpful during this time and Hoboken became a military town. According to The United States World War I Centennial Commission, former President Woodrow Wilson declared that all enemy aliens were not permitted to “live, work, or even travel within 100 yards of docks, piers, and waterfronts,” which left a thousand German families without homes. Hoboken even went through a Prohibition in order to prevent soldiers from drinking, closing 278 of 338 saloons throughout the town.\n\nSee More: Presidents Who Have Visited Essex County\n\nTeddy Roosevelt in 1909\n\nTeddy Roosevelt traveled a lot throughout his lifetime. A photographer captured a blurry photo in front of an Abercrombie & Fitch sign on the Hoboken waterfront before him boarding a ship departing for Africa in March 1909."
