The Woodrow Wilson Birthplace, referred to as "The Manse", which is the name of a Presbyterian minister's home, was originally built in 1846 by the Staunton First Presbyterian Church. Wilson's father, Joseph Ruggles Wilson, was ordained 1855 and along with his wife Jessie Woodrow Wilson and their daughters Marion and Annie, moved into this house. Thomas Woodrow Wilson was born in what is now called the "birth room" on December 28, 1856. The Wilsons left The Manse in 1858 when Joseph Wilson accepted a call from a congregation in Augusta, Georgia. The house was opened to the public in 1941, being formally dedicated as a museum by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

The Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum, located in Staunton Virginia, features a museum that explores the life and times of Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), a 6800-square-foot Research Library, and the 28th President of the United States' birthplace.
