Woodrow Wilson

Born in Virginia in 1856, Thomas Woodrow Wilson had seen the horrors of war. His father was a Presbyterian minister in Augusta, Georgia, during the Civil War and a professor in charred and ruined Columbia, South Carolina, during Reconstruction. Wilson never forgot how war scarred not only the land, but also the bodies and minds of people.

As a young boy, Wilson had difficulty learning to read, but his father helped him. As an adult he became a brilliant, thoughtful scholar. He earned degrees from Princeton University, the University of Virginia Law School, and Johns Hopkins University. He became a college professor in political science. In 1902, he became president of Princeton.

A group of politicians in New Jersey talked Wilson into running for governor in 1910. They thought they could control the quiet college professor. Were they ever wrong! Wilson reformed New Jersey's government and made it a model for other states. When he ran for president in 1912, he won.

As president, he did everything he could to keep the United States out of war. In fact, he won election to a second term with the slogan "He kept us out of war." But the aggressive acts of Germany soon put an end to America's neutrality. In 1917, Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany to make the world "safe for democracy." Americans joined in the war effort with great patriotism. President Wilson even kept sheep on the White House lawn. He sold their wool to raise money for the Red Cross.

Before the war ended, Wilson already had definite ideas about how to have a lasting peace. He put these ideas into his Fourteen Points. But the nations that wrote the Treaty of Versailles did not agree with Wilson. With his health failing, he began to travel around the county to persuade the people that the United States must join the League of Nations. The effort was too much, and he suffered a stroke and nearly died. His wife, Edith Bolling Galt, nursed him until he died in 1924.
