        "text": "Boynton Coat of Arms\n\nThis Boynton family coat of arms is reproduced from the Genealogy of the Descendants of William and John Boynton (1897) - the full text is available for free online reference. The family coat of arms is shown in \"true heraldic colors\" exactly as Sir Henry Somerville Boynton - the Baronet (at that time) - was using it (except that the label below the helmet has been dropped as that is used to identify the version used by the eldest son). The significance of the elements of the coat of arms are summarized as follows.\n\nThe heraldic appendages of a knight are the helmet, mantle, wreath, and crest. The helmet of the knight stands full faced, with the visor open, which signifies direction and command. (The closed visor signifies preparation for battle while the open visor represents a return from battle, with glory and victory.)\n\nThe crescent, or new moon, has been an honorable symbol, employed by many of the eastern nations. Hence the conquests of the Christian leaders during the crusades have given rise to the assumption of crescents as heraldic insignia in our shields of arms. This form represents the new moon as she appears about the time of the autumnal Equinox, when seen in Syria and other regions near the northern tropic, that is, with her horns toward the Zenith.\n\nUndoubtedly, the goat was assumed for a crest by the Boyntons during the Crusades, as indicative of their undaunted courage.\n\nBoynton Genealogy 34 Generations\n\nTorchill Bovington (per \"Betham's History, Genealogy and Baronets of the Boynton Family in England\")\n\nBartholomew de Boynton --- Lord of the Boynton manor in 1067.
