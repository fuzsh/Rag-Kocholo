        "text": "FREEHOLD – The Downtown Concert Series will continue on Feb. 17 at 7:30 p.m. with an evening of music by the East End Quartet, known for presenting concerts that have been described as “deep and powerful, sweet and high, fast and madcap.”\n\nThe Downtown Concert Series is hosted at St. Peter’s Church, 33 Throckmorton St., Freehold.\n\nThe East End Quartet features close collaboration with composers, in-house arrangements and an eclectic range of its members own transcriptions for the saxophone quartet, according to a press release.\n\nThe program in Freehold will feature Antonin Dvorak’s second Piano Quintet featuring pianist Szu-Yi Li, Astor Piazzolla’s “Four Seasons of Buenos Aires” and the world premiere of “Symphony Cocteau,” a work written for the East End Quartet by English composer Graham Lynch.\n\nThis quartet performs almost exclusively from memory, according to Jonathan Wintringham, who plays the soprano saxophone, and is one of its founding members.\n\nWintringham said the musicians work collaboratively to produce new arrangements and present concerts that are “eclectic, engaging and representative of diverse musical styles.”\n\nMyles Boothroyd, also a founding member, is the alto saxophonist. Matthew Amedio is the tenor saxophonist. Timothy Harris, a founding member, plays baritone saxophone.\n\nFor additional information and to purchase tickets, visit DowntownConcertSeries.org or call 732-431-8383."
