        "text": "Across the UK, wildflower meadows play a vital role in our environment, providing food and habitat for many pollinators and insects. Pupils in the Eco Committee at Wintringham Primary Academy recently spent time with sustainable homebuilder, Stonebond, to create their own wildflower garden within their school, and learn all about how simply sowing these seeds can support a rich and biodiverse eco-system.\n\nWintringham Primary Academy’s Eco Committee is a group of ten pupils that take time within their studies to learn more about the natural environment and how to pave the way towards a sustainable future. On Thursday 25th April, together with Stonebond and landscaper, Dan Statham from Down to Earth, the students designed a raised wildflower garden for the school grounds. The team then met up six weeks later to install their design and plant the wildflower seeds. This will be enjoyed by students and teachers for years to come, whilst enhancing the surrounding environment. The children had a full and insightful experience, learning about the benefits of planting these beautiful and diverse flowers, from poppies to cornflowers, and all the children in the school were gifted with their own wildflower seed balls to plant in their own gardens at home.\n\nAnnette Cole, Sales & Marketing Director at Stonebond comments: “We take pride in our sustainable approach to housebuilding and our homes are developed with the environment and wider community in mind. Landscaping is an important part of all our schemes, and we ensure areas of biodiversity and green open spaces are an integral feature.\n\n“It’s was a great opportunity to work with children at Wintringham Primary Academy, a thriving school that is just minutes’ walk from our development; it was lovely to see so much enthusiasm from the children. ”\n\nDan Statham, Landscaper at Down to Earth adds: “It was a very exciting project to share with the children – they were so enthusiastic and eager to learn from us about the positive impact that gardening and wildflower meadows can have on the wider world around them! They also loved creating the design, and seeing all the bright and vibrant colours that will appear in their new garden.”\n\nMaxim Hall, Assistant Headteacher at Wintringham Primary Academy says: “We’re very grateful to Stonebond for working with us on this project, as it will add significant value to our school. Our new wildflower garden will support biodiversity, while teaching the children valuable lessons about our natural world. I anticipate that pupils and teachers alike will also benefit from the garden from a wellbeing perspective, too.”"
