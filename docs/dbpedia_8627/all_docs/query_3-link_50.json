        "text": "Welcome to St. Peter the Apostle!\n\nOn behalf of the Parish Staff we invite you to explore our historic community of faith. For two centuries, the people of St. Peter the Apostle have worked and worshipped together for the greater glory of God. Our beloved parish has a wonderful history and many people have been a part of that heritage given to us by those who have gone before us, and we continue to work to spread the Word of our Lord. We feel a strong connection to the dear ones who have gone before us, leaving a legacy of love. We look forward to continuing that legacy and welcome with open arms all who wish to worship here.\n\nSt. Peter’s is an active and growing community. For parishioners and visitors alike we invite you to worship with us, learn about the faith with us and celebrate with us. I hope that St. Peter’s can be a spiritual home for you to find the Lord Jesus and know of his love for you.\n\nPeace,"
