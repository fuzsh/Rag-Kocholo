        "text": "The guide to our church can be found here\n\nAll Saints Church, Thorpe Bassett\n\nDating from the 12th century this small village church was extensively restored in 1878-80. The 12th century doorway with chevron-moulded round arch remains and the north wall contains elements of medieval headstones and cross slabs. There is an early plain tub font and 14th century effigy of a priest reclining on a tomb chest under an arched niche in the chancel north wall. The chancel paving provides a good example of copied medieval tiles which are simply impressed with a linear motif.\n\nChurchwarden\n\nMr D Harrison (David), Wintringham South Wold Farm, Settrington High Street, Malton, YO17 8BQ\n\nTel: 01944 768548\n\nPage updated 24 May 2021\n\nWe are currently in vacancy and without a Vicar, however we are very pleased to have Rev. Cate from West Buckrose working with us one day a week. Please contact her at 01653 619928 or Revd.cate@btinternet.com, or the Church wardens with any inquiries"
