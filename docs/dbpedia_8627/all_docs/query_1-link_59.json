The program will feature Ludwig van Beethoven's epic \"MissaSolemnis\" with full chorus and orchestra. The concert will be followed by a reception with an opportunity to meet the artists.\n\nBeethoven wrote this large-scale Mass setting for orchestra, choir, and soloists as a gift to his patron and friend Archduke Rudolph Rainier, who was being ordained as an Archbishop in 1820. Beethoven was at the full height of his creative powers at this point and held nothing back for this work. The ever-increasing scale of the project soon became apparent as Beethoven worked on the Mass for three additional years, with the first performance of the work finally taking place in the spring of 1824.\n\nWritten at the same time as his more famous Ninth Symphony, this work is often viewed as one Beethoven’s supreme achievements, cited as one of the great choral works alongside Bach’s \"B-minor Mass” and Mozart’s “Requiem”. It is an incredible display of virtuosity for the choir, orchestra, and soloists alike and is rarely performed in its entirety. Join us for this exciting opportunity to experience thrilling music in a beautiful setting!\n\nThe Masterworks Concert is always a highlight of the Steeple Concert series, with soloists, full chorus featuring the choir of St. Paul’s Church and the community, and professional orchestra. The conductor is Mark Hyczko, Director of Music at St. Paul’s.\n\nThe concert will take place on Sunday, May 19, at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, 414 East Broad Street, in Westfield, NJ. Tickets to the concert are priced at $40 for adults and $20 for students, and are available on the Steeple Concerts website at www.steepleconcerts.org. Parking for the concert is available in the St. Paul’s parking lot off Euclid Avenue or on St. Paul’s Street next to the church.\n\nThe Aizuri Quartet has been praised by the Washington Post as “astounding” and “captivating”. The string quartet brings its “meld of intellect, technique and emotions” to at St. Paul’s Church in Westfield on Sunday, March 10 at 5pm as part of the Steeple Concerts series. The group, founded in 2012, programs an eclectic mix of music to present the string quartet as “living art”. The program will be followed by a reception at which you will have an opportunity to meet and greet the performers. The concert will be at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, 414 East Broad Street, Westfield, NJ.\n\nThe Aizuri Quartet was named the recipient of the 2022 Cleveland Quartet Award by Chamber Music America, and has received numerous honors from the M-Prize Chamber Arts Competition, the Osaka International Chamber Music Competition in Japan, and the Wigmore Hall International String Quartet Competition in London.\n\nTheir albums include music ranging from the 11th-century Hildegard von Bingen to contemporary American composers. NPR praised their latest album as one that “convincingly connects the dots in wildly diverse music stretching over eight centuries…arousing solemn contemplation, cosmic curiosity, folksy delight and introspective scrutiny.” In addition to traditional chamber music venues, the quartet has appeared eclectic variety of settings: In addition to the world’s great chamber music series, Aizuri has appeared with legendary Indie Rock band Wilco on CBS’s The Tonight Show with Steven Colbert and in the Kronos Quartet’s Kronos Festival at SFJAZZ.\n\nThe Aizuri Quartet draws its name from “aizuri-e,” a style of predominantly blue Japanese woodblock printing that is noted for its vibrancy and incredible detail. You will not want to miss the opportunity to hear the quartet bring their eclectic, engaging and thought-provoking programs to Westfield.\n\nTickets to the concert are priced at $30 for adults and $15 for students, and are available on the Steeple Concerts website at www.steepleconcerts.org.

The concert will be at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, 414 East Broad Street, Westfield, NJ. The program will be followed by a reception at which you will have an opportunity to meet and greet the performer.\n\nVirtuoso pianist Ilya Yakushev, with many awards and honors to his credit, continues to astound and mesmerize audiences at major venues on three continents.\n\nIn the 2022-23 season, Ilya Yakushev performed as piano soloist with Meridian Symphony, San Luis Obispo Symphony, St. Petersburg Philharmonic, Dubuque Symphony, Las Vegas Philharmonic and Fort Wayne Philharmonic in addition to over 40 recitals in North America and Mexico.\n\nHighlights of Yakushev’s 2023-24 season include return appearances with the San Luis Obispo Symphony, St. Petersburg Philharmonic, and Glacier Symphony, as well as a performance with the Panama City Symphony.\n\nIn February 2014, British label Nimbus Records published “Prokofiev Sonatas Vol. 1” CD. American Record Guide wrote “Yakushev is one of the very best young pianists before the public today, and it doesn’t seem to matter what repertoire he plays – it is all of the highest caliber”. Volume 2 was published in January 2017, as well as an all-Russian repertoire CD in September 2017.\n\nIn past seasons, he has performed in various prestigious venues worldwide, including Glinka Philharmonic Hall (St. Petersburg), Victoria Hall (Singapore), Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall (New York), Davies Symphony Hall (San Francisco), and Sejong Performing Arts Center (Seoul, Korea). His performances with orchestra include those with the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra, St. Petersburg Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony, BBC Concert Orchestra, Boston Pops, Rochester Philharmonic, Utah Symphony, and many others.\n\nWinner of the 2005 World Piano Competition which took place in Cincinnati, OH, Mr. Yakushev received his first award at age 12 as a prizewinner of the Young Artists Concerto Competition in his native St. Petersburg.

The duo, based in England and opening their current US tour with this concert, features violinist Adam Summerhayes and accordionist Murray Grainger. The concert will be at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, 414 East Broad Street, Westfield, NJ. The program will be followed by a reception at which you will have an opportunity to meet and greet the performers.\n\n“Gypsy” music is smoke and mirrors; a virtuoso illusion—we all know what it sounds like, and the music is real enough, but it is not born of an ancient “Gypsy” tradition. Instead, centuries ago, traveling “Gypsies” (or Roma, as they are correctly known) began to twist the local music around them into tantalizing, mysterious and pulsating new versions. Hungarian “Gypsy” music is really mostly indigenous Hungarian folk music. As the Roma traveled west, they adapted their impressive musical skills—particularly on the violin. In addition, the klezmer influence is unmistakable. Despite its varied sources, “Gypsy” music remains one of the world’s most instantly recognizable musical brands: vibrant, expressive, sensuous and fiery.\n\nAdam Summerhayes and Murray Grainger have been playing together for over a decade, performing at many festivals, including Glastonbury, Edinburgh Festival, and Shrewsbury Folk Festival. Their music has been broadcast on BBC Radio and they were awarded the Instrumental Album of the Year 2022 by the prestigious UK music magazine FATEA.\n\nIn addition to his career as a folk musician, Adam Summerhayes’s classical pedigree is impeccable, with direct links via his grandfather to the violinists who premiered Brahms’s and Tchaikovsky’s violin concertos. The New York Times has described his performance as “astonishing, all-out virtuosity”. Murray Grainger, one of Britain’s most influential and innovative accordionists, studied at the Royal Academy of Music and has performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Liverpool Philharmonic, and Scottish Ballet. An accomplished player of both piano and button key accordions (as well as the bandoneon and the accordina) he has collaborated with composers creating new works for the instrument.\n\nThis is sure to be a highlight of the 2023 musical season and a concert you will not want to miss!\n\nTickets to the concert are priced at $30 for adults and $15 for students, and are available on the Steeple Concerts website at www.steepleconcerts.org. More information about upcoming concerts in the 2023-2024 season is also available on the Steeple Concerts website. Parking for the concert is available in the St. Paul’s parking lot off Euclid Avenue or on St. Paul’s Street next to the church.\n\nSteeple Concerts is proud to announce our next season of world-class music coming to downtown Westfield. This year's lineup features a violin/accordion duo specializing in Roma (\"gypsy\") music, a virtuoso pianist, a world-renown early music vocal quartet, an 'astounding' string quartet, and the annual Masterworks finale with choir and orchestra. All concerts are scheduled at 5:00 on Sunday afternoons at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, 414 East Broad Street, Westfield, NJ.\n\nThe season kicks off on Sunday, September 24 with the Vagabond Duo. This innovative ensemble pairs England’s ‘Paganini of the violin’ playing the most brilliant and seductive of gypsy melodies with a master accordionist in an award-winning duo, whose music has been described as ‘gorgeous stuff.‘ (BBC)\n\nThe season continues on Sunday, November 12 when Steeple Concerts presents the virtuoso pianist Ilya Yakushev. With many awards and honors to his credit, he continues to astound and mesmerize audiences at major venues on three continents, while his playing has been described as “one of the very best young pianists before the public today, and it doesn’t seem to matter what repertoire he plays – it is all of the highest caliber” (American Record Guide.)\n\nOn Sunday January 21, 2024 Steeple Concerts will host one of the most pre-eminent vocal ensembles in the world. Praised for a “rich, natural sound that’s larger and more complex than the sum of its parts,” (NPR) New York Polyphony is one of the foremost vocal chamber ensembles active today. The four men, “singers of superb musicianship and vocal allure,” (The New Yorker) give vibrant, modern voice to repertoire ranging from Gregorian chant to cutting-edge compositions. Their dedication to innovative programming, as well as a focus on rare and rediscovered Renaissance and medieval works, has not only earned New York Polyphony two GRAMMY nominations and wide acclaim, but also helped to move early music into the classical mainstream.\n\nPraised by The Washington Post for “astounding” and “captivating” performances that draw from its notable “meld of intellect, technique and emotions,” the Aizuri Quartet will perform at Steeple Concerts on Sunday March 10, 2024. Come hear the ensemble that was described by The New York Times as “genuinely exciting,” “imaginative” and “a [string] quartet of expert collaborators.”\n\nThe season concludes on Sunday, May 19, 2024 with the annual Masterworks Concert featuring the choir of St. Paul’s Church and community with a professional orchestra. The concert is always a highlight of the season and offers an opportunity to hear major works for chorus and orchestra in a live setting. In celebration of its 200th anniversary, this year we will present Ludwig van Beethoven’s late masterwork - the epic “Missa Solemnis.”\n\nSteeple Concerts at St. Paul’s is proud to present its annual Masterworks Concert at 5:00 PM on Sunday, May 21, at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, 414 East Broad Street, in Westfield, NJ. The program will feature Antonin Dvorak’s epic \"Stabat Mater\" with full chorus and orchestra. The concert will be followed by a reception with an opportunity to meet the artists.\n\nDvorak began composition of the \"Stabat Mater\", a traditional text on the grief of the Virgin Mary at the crucifixion of her son, in 1875 shortly after the death of his infant son. He completed the work in 1877, but not before he and his wife had lost their two other children. Although he was not widely known before he began composition of the \"Stabat Mater,\" it did not receive a public performance until 1880, after the widespread popularity of his now-famous Slavonic Dances. The work moves from the sorrow of Mary to an optimistic expression of hope and was a resounding success throughout Europe and the United States.\n\nThe Masterworks Concert is always a highlight of the Steeple Concert series, with soloists, full chorus featuring the choir of St. Paul’s Church and the community, and professional orchestra. The conductor is Mark Hyczko, Director of Music at St. Paul’s. Join us for this exciting opportunity to experience live music in a beautiful setting.\n\nThe concert will take place on Sunday, May 21, at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, 414 East Broad Street, in Westfield, NJ.

Price, Joseph Haydn, and Antonín Dvořák.

The Westerlies navigate a wide array of venues and projects with the precision of a string quartet, the audacity of a rock band, and the charm of a family sing-along.

Praised by The Strad as “stylish and accomplished,” she embraces an eclectic musical life as a multi-instrumental soloist and collaborator. Ms. Hunt recently released her third album, which is part of an ambitious recording project featuring Bach’s complete Cello Suites and Sonatas for Viola da gamba and harpsichord performed on an array of period instruments. In high demand as viola da gamba soloist and continuo cellist for the Passions, Cantatas, and Concertos of J.S. Bach, Ms. Hunt performs and records extensively with the nation's leading period instrument ensembles. She is a founding member of the Cramer Quartet, a period instrument string quartet performing classical and early romantic repertoire. As a chamber musician, she has performed at the Morgan Library & Museum, the Library of Congress, Caramoor, La Jolla Music Society SummerFest, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nPhiladelphia native Sylvia Berry has performed extensively at home and abroad as a soloist and chamber musician. Hailed by Early Music America as \"a complete master of rhetoric, whether in driving passagework or [in] cantabile adagios,” she is known not only for her exciting performances, but for her engaging commentary about the music and the instruments she plays. Her disc of Haydn's London Sonatas - recorded for Acis on an 1806 Broadwood - garnered critical acclaim. A review in Fanfare enthused, “To say that Berry plays these works with vim, vigor, verve, and vitality, is actually a bit of an understatement.”\n\nMs. Berry is one of North America's leading exponents of the fortepiano, as well as other historical keyboard instruments, including the harpsichord, virginal, and clavichord. She dedicates herself to the performance practices of the 18th and early 19th centuries, with an avid interest in the sociological phenomena surrounding the music of that period. In addition to her performing activities, Ms. Berry is a respected scholar and has written and lectured widely on these topics.\n\nThe Steeple Concert season continues on Sunday, March 27, with a concert that showcases The Westerlies, a brass quartet based in New York with a program that will explore jazz, roots and chamber music influences.\n\nThe season concludes on Sunday, May 15, with the traditional Masterworks Concert featuring the choir of St. Paul’s Church with orchestra.

She has performed as soloist with the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and New Jersey orchestras, as well as others in the US, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. As a solo and chamber music recitalist, she has performed at Carnegie’s Weill Recital Hall and in other cities around the globe.\n\nThis summer Min Kwon premiered America/Beautiful, a project in which she commissioned a diverse group of more than 70 of today’s leading American composers to each compose a variation on “America the Beautiful.” The goal of the project was to paint a sonic picture of her adopted country in all of its sprawling complexity, and ultimately try to find the beauty at the core of the American experiment and its credo of 'e pluribus unum' (out of many, one). The series of concerts were streamed online beginning on July 4 of this year.\n\nMin Kwon holds Doctor of Musical Arts and Master of Music degrees from The Juilliard School and a Bachelor of Music degree from The Curtis Institute of Music, and has completed post-doctoral studies in Salzburg. Dr. Kwon is Professor of Piano at Mason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University, since 2002 and is also the founder and director of the Center for Musical Excellence (CME), a non-profit dedicated to mentoring and supporting gifted young musicians.

Now in their second decade, the quartet performs regularly across North America, Europe, as well as touring in Asia and Brazil. Recent highlights include their debut at New York’s Lincoln Center, a return to London’s Wigmore Hall, and performances at Stanford University’s Bing Concert Hall as winners of the prestigious John Lad Prize.\n\nThis “technically superb” string quartet “brings refinement and prowess to both new and established repertoire” (The Strad). Formed at The Juilliard School in 2008, Tesla quickly established itself as one of the most promising young ensembles in New York, and has quickly proven to be one of the most in-demand American string quartets on today's concert scene.\n\nThe program will includes works by Franz Schubert (String Quartet No. 15 in G major) and Caroline Shaw (Plan & Elevation: The Grounds of Dumbarton Oaks).
