        "text": "A peaceful medieval church\n\nThis beautiful and peaceful church, with an elegant spire, was built from the Norman period to the fifteenth century.\n\nThe oldest part of the church is the Norman chancel with its priest's door and corbel table; the nave and west tower are of the fourteenth century, although externally the tower has crenellated parapets and Perpendicular tracery of the fifteenth century. The church is full of interesting furnishings including Jacobean bench pews, medieval carvings and stained glass. Look carefully and you might also find green men, mythical beasts and sword markings...\n\nThe graveyard is filled with eighteenth and nineteenth-century monuments to the former inhabitants of this sleepy village.\n\nYour support and generosity is what helps us keep the doors to these special places open. We could not do it without you.If you would like to donate to the upkeep and maintenance of St Peter’s please text WIM to 70970 to donate £5 or to 70191 to give £10 every donation really does make a difference to these beautiful churches.\n\nThank You.\n\nEnjoy a spell of calm reflection with our Mindful Moments: https://izi.travel/en/browse/fbc0691f-49e2-4f12-b965-38be2d0c4650\n\nWintringham St. Peter - Your Church Tour Nocturnal Neighbours St Peter's WIM.pdf Yorkshire Wolds Way-Wintringham to East Heslerton loop.pdf"
