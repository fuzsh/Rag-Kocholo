The tower and spire are 15th century. There is a Norman font with a tall octagonal cover which is painted with winged cherubs and is dated 1736. There is also much 17th century woodwork including pews, alms box, nave roof, pulpit and reading desk. There is some fine 15th century stained glass in the windows.\n\nThe church is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.\n\nPage updated 20 Jul 2016\n\nWe are currently in vacancy and without a Vicar, however we are very pleased to have Rev. Cate from West Buckrose working with us one day a week. Please contact her at 01653 619928 or Revd.cate@btinternet.com, or the Church wardens with any inquiries"
