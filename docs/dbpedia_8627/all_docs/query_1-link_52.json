        "text": "A unique multimedia art installation celebrating the long-standing connection between bats and churches is to be displayed at Walpole St Peter church this spring.\n\nThe installation, entitled On A Wing And A Prayer, was commissioned by Bats in Churches, a five-year, £5m partnership between Bat Conservation Trust, Natural England, Church of England, The Churches Conservation Trust and Historic England.\n\nFunded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund the project aims to help church communities find ways of coexisting in harmony with their resident bats.\n\nThe artwork will be on display at St Peter’s from Thursday March 30 to Sunday April 16.\n\nKnown as the Cathedral of the Fens, St Peter’s church in Walpole St Peter is used by common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as smaller numbers of brown long-eared bats.\n\nDavid Galloway, churchwarden at St Peter’s, said: \"The church community at Walpole St Peter is looking forward to welcoming the artwork to the church. It’s another opportunity for residents to learn more about our colony of bats, after so many people came to our successful bat night in 2021.\"\n\nCreated by professional artist and Bats in Churches volunteer Ilene Sterns, On A Wing And A Prayer is an immersive and multi-layered artwork set to recordings of bats inside churches, slowed down to be audible to the human ear.\n\nThe artwork was commissioned by Bats in Churches to highlight the long-standing relationship between bats and churches, and to commemorate the project after it concludes in 2023.\n\nIlene said: \"As an artist I have always found inspiration in nature and history. And as a Bats in Churches volunteer I have spent many hours marvelling at the remarkable winged mammals that make these ancient buildings their homes.\"\n\nThe artwork was unveiled at the church of St Michael the Archangel in Compton Martin, Somerset, in October 2022. It was then moved to the church of St Sampson in Cricklade, Wiltshire for a special bat weekend attended by more than 500 members of the community. From there it visited the church of St Peter in Wintringham, Yorks and\n\na bat-themed community day attracted more than 100 visitors in just four hours. Most recently it has spent a month at the church of Holy Trinity in Tattershall, Lincolnshire.\n\nDiana Spencer, engagement officer at Bats in Churches, said: \"We are thrilled to have commissioned Ilene to create this atmospheric and immersive artwork celebrating our project. So far On A Wing And A Prayer has been a huge success and we are very excited to bring the artwork Walpole St Peter where it will celebrate and highlight the\n\nharmonious co-existence between bats and churches.’\""
