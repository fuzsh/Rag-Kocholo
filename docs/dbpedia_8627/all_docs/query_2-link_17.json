        "text": "A fishermen's church overlooking the sea\n\nLikened to an old mariner gazing out to sea, St Stephen's stands majestically on the hillside between Whitby and Ravenscar, overlooking Robin Hood's Bay. Built in 1821, its appearance can be severe but the church resonates with the history of a resilient North Sea fishing community.\n\nInside, painted box pews, a full-length gallery and a three-decker pulpit, designed for the preaching of the Word, have all survived. The sea is a recurring theme throughout and there are memorials to the shipwrecked in both the church and churchyard. Successful lifeboat rescue missions are listed and there is also a touching display of rare maiden's garlands - 'crowns' used in the funeral processions of young and chaste women.\n\nOutside, windswept gravestones huddle tightly round the church walls. Some recall tragedies: strangers who drowned on the coast or locals whose lives were cruelly claimed by the sea.\n\nYour support and generosity is what helps us keep the doors to these special places open. We could not do it without you. If you would like to donate to the upkeep and maintenance of Old St Stephen’s please text FYL to 70970 to donate £5 or to 70191 to give £10. Every donation really does make a difference to these beautiful churches.\n\nThank You!\n\nTake A Stroll Amongst The Stones and uncover some of the fascinating history of the church and the lives and deaths of the community around it.\n\nEnjoy a spell of calm reflection with our Mindful Moments.\n\nChurchyard Trail .pdf Fylingdales Old St. Stephen - Your Church Tour"
