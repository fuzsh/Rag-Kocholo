        "text": "A tall tower and wonderful views\n\nSt Andrew's stands in a large peaceful churchyard at the southern end of the hamlet. With wonderful views over the surrounding countryside, this village church, completed in 1877, boasts a striking 32-metre spire.\n\nThe church is in the Transitional style, with an Italian feel. The exuberant Victorian interior - designed as a complete, unified scheme by G E Street - is particularly impressive.\n\nInside, the oak pews are set in an oak-boarded floor, and the stone pulpit is particularly fine.\n\nYour support and generosity is what helps us keep the doors to these special places open. We could not do it without you.If you would like to donate to the upkeep and maintenance of St Andrew’s please text EHE to 70970 to donate £5 or to 70191 to give £10 every donation really does make a difference to these beautiful churches. Thank You.\n\nEnjoy a spell of calm reflection with our Mindful Moments: https://izi.travel/en/browse/fbc0691f-49e2-4f12-b965-38be2d0c4650\n\nEast Heslerton St. Andrew - Your Church Tour Yorkshire Wolds Way-Wintringham to East Heslerton loop.pdf"
