The \"Borough\" family \"Arms\" consisted of: \"A.[Argent] on a saltire sable five swans of the first\".\n\nAlso, the following information about Brough Hall near Catterick, Yorkshire, comes from the book Victoria County History: A History of the County of York North Riding, by William Page, Editor, 1914, Volume 1, pages 301-313.\n\nBROUGH (Burgh, till xvii cent.) was held by Tor before the Conquest and by Enisan of Count Alan in 1086. Enisan's successors, the lords of Constable Burton (q.v.), had a mesne lordship here.\n\nAmong the tenants in 1286, when Brough was held in 'divers fees,' was evidently William de Burgh, who was party to an agreement concerning 7 oxgangs here in 1296 and was the principal tenant in 1301. He or his son William settled the manor in 1348 on himself in tail-male, with remainder to his daughter Elizabeth wife of Richard de Richmond, whose heirs took the name of Burgh. They were succeeded by a son John who died in 1412. His son William rebuilt Catterick Church. He died in 1442 and his son Christopher succeeded him. On his death without male issue the manor passed to the heirs of his younger brother William. William had two sons, William and George. The former left at his death sons William and Christopher. Their line, however, ended in heiresses and the manor passed to the heirs of George. Roger Burgh, his grandson, died seised in 1574; he seems to have broken the entail, for the manor was inherited by his daughter and heir Elizabeth wife of Sir Ralph Lawson. Ralph died in 1623, and was succeeded by his grandson Henry. He died in 1636, leaving a son and heir Roger. Roger was succeeded by his brother John, whose lands were sequestered in 1653, and sold by the treason trustees to John Rushworth. They were restored by Charles II, who made John Lawson a baronet in 1665. He was succeeded by his son Henry, who left a son John. John was succeeded by another Henry, who also had a son John. This Sir John died without issue, and the estate and baronetcy passed to his brother Henry, who was succeeded in 1834 by his nephew William Wright, son of his sister Elizabeth. William took the name of Lawson, and was made a baronet in 1841. His grandson Sir Henry Joseph Lawson is the present baronet.\n\nIn addition, the following information about Brough Hall near Catterick, Yorkshire, appeared in the publication Country Life by John Cornforth, October 12, 1967, pages 894-898:\n\nBrough, lies about a mile to the south-west [of Catterick], and makes it more difficult for a stranger to grasp the Lawson family's ancient connection with the village. For centuries they and their medieval and Tudor predecessors, the de Brughs or Broughs, maintained the bridge []known as Catterick Bridge] and were buried in the church that Katherine de Brugh and heirs on built in 1412.\n\n…It is necessary to explain how the Lawsons came to Brough in the second half of the 16th century. Henry (Maire) Lawson, who inherited in 1811, traced his ancestors back to the Leonard Lawson of Burwell, alias Bywell, 13 generations back from the Ralph Lawson who acquired Brough. This Leonard Lawson appears to be the same man as Lawrence of Corbridge, whom H. H. E. Craster identifies as the first of the family: he appears in a subsidy roll of 1336, and was a burgess of Newcastle and a householder in Corbridge. Craster accepts that William Lawson, who married Agnes Cramlington about 1425, was a closely related descendant of his. Through this marriage Cramlington came to the Lawsons, and the senior branch continued to hold part of it until they died out in 1791.\n\nOne of William Lawson's youngest great-grandsons, James, was a Newcastle merchant and mayor of the town in 1529 and 1540. He bought property at Byker, just to the east of Gateshead on the Tyne, and at West Wetfen. Ralph Lawson was James' grandson, and acquired Brough through his marriage in 1565 to Elizabeth Brough, the heiress. The Broughs were a family as old as the Lawsons, and seem to have held the property at least since the reign of Edward II [1307-1327].\n\nIt is not clear when Elizabeth Brough's father died and Brough came to the young couple, but Ralph and Elizabeth Lawson were certainly the builders of the middle part of the present house. Ralph Lawson was only 15 in 1561-62 and at Douai in 1568, and so it is unlikely that they started to build until after that, probably in the 1570s or 1580s. The reason for attributing the house to them is heraldic evidence on all three floors. Both the ceilings in the great hall and the present kitchen on the first floor bear their arms: two achievements occur, one showing the arms of the Lawsons quartered with those of the Cramlingtons and the Swinnows, Ralph Lawson's mother's family, together with the Lawson crest; and the other showing the arms of the Lawsons impaled with those of the Broughs, the Lawson arms quartered as before, and the Brough arms quartered with a coat I have not identified. In subsidiary panels appear the Lawson martlet, the Lawson rising sun, the Swinnow boar, and the Brough swan. Fragments of a frieze on the top floor also incorporate the complete Lawson crest, a rising sun supported by two flexed arms on a wreath."
