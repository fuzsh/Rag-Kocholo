The Church of St Peter is a large church with a Norman chancel with later windows and nave. The tower and spire are 15th century. There is a Norman font with a tall octagonal cover which is painted with winged cherubs and is dated 1736. There is also much 17th century woodwork including pews, alms box, nave roof, pulpit and reading desk. There is some fine 15th century stained glass in the windows.

The church is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.
