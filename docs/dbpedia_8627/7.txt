A peaceful medieval church

This beautiful and peaceful church, with an elegant spire, was built from the Norman period to the fifteenth century.

The oldest part of the church is the Norman chancel with its priest's door and corbel table; the nave and west tower are of the fourteenth century, although externally the tower has crenellated parapets and Perpendicular tracery of the fifteenth century. The church is full of interesting furnishings including Jacobean bench pews, medieval carvings and stained glass. Look carefully and you might also find green men, mythical beasts and sword markings...

The graveyard is filled with eighteenth and nineteenth-century monuments to the former inhabitants of this sleepy village.
