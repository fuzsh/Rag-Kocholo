The relationships between the State Militia (National Guard) and the Federal Government have been more tlearly established in various Congressional actions starting with the Dick Act of 1903 and other Federal legislation in 1908, 1916, 1920 and 1933. In 1952 Congress restated these policies and that the strength of the National Guard as an integral part of the 1first line of defense of this Nation must be at all times maintained and assured.\n\n2. The National Guard represents tradition in the best sense of American history. Although the units vary in background and current activities, they are by and large, reservoirs of pride and patriotism at a grass roots level. They are substantial buffers against efforts to replace traditional ways with ''progressive\" ways in which there is no place for pride of land and reverence of the past.\n\n3. The Governor of a State is the Commander-in-Chief of all National Guard forces located in his State. He may call them to State Active Duty under any emergency conditions that he deems appropriate. These troops are indeed the State's armed forces during periods other than National emergencies. This concept of National Guard structure was conceived by the Nation's founders and is reflected in the Constitution of the United States. It has existed for over 300 years. It is a successful operation and has figured most prominently in winning all of America's wars. It effectively progresses in p~ace because it has the backing and support of the Congress, the people, the Governors and the communities.\n\n4. In return for Federal support within the States, the Guard is obligated to meet certain requirements directed by the Federal Government, among them:\n\na. To train personnel in accordance with programs published by the Department of Defense.\n\nb. To meet standards of proficiency as required. Such proficiency to be tested through observation and examination by Regular establishment personnel.\n\nc. To meet Department of Defense standards in all officer promotions and appointments.\n\nd. To maintain unit strengths as directed by Federal policies.\n\ne. To maintain all equipment in accordance with Federal policies.\n\nf. To maintain acceptable standards of housing and security for personnel and arms.\n\nHaving accomplished these goals, the National Guard is considered our country's first line Ready Reserve Force and available for Federal duty on appropriate call or order.\n\n5. The Federal Government's obligations in the National Guard structure are:\n\na. Provide Federal Recognition to units meeting the requirements.\n\nb. Furnish equipment, uniforms and arms, and pay and allowances for armory drills and field training.\n\nc. To provide training aids, literature for armory drills and camp facilities for field training.\n\nd. To provide certain National Guard personnel with six (6) months active duty training, and advisory personnel for both field training and armory training.\n\ne. To match State funds 75% tti 25% for armory construction.\n\nf. To provide school facilities for training of National Guard specialists.\n\ng. To provide personnel or funds for full time maintenance of Government equipment at concentration sites.\n\nMISSION of the\n\nNATIONAL GUARD OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nTo provide units of the reserve components for the Army, adequately organized, trained and equipped, available for mobilization in the event of National emergency or war, in accordance with the deployment schedule, and capable of participating in combat operations, in support of the Army's war plans. This mission may include the defense of critical areas of the United States against attack.\n\nMISSION of the\n\nARMY AND AIR NATIONAL GUARD OF THE SEVERAL STATES\n\nTo provide sufficient organizations in each State, so trained and equipped as to enable them to function efficiently at existing strength in the protection of life and property and the preservation of peace, order and public safety, under competent orders of the State authorities. (From \"Department of the Army Policies Pertaining to the Reserve Components of the Army,\" October 1953).\n\nMISSION of the\n\nAIR NATIONAL GUARD OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nTo provide trained units and qualified individuals to be available for active duty in the United States Air Force in time of war or National emergency and at such other times as the National security may require, to meet the requirements of the United States Air Force in excess of those of the Regular components thereof, during and after the period needed for procurement and training of additional trained units and qualified individuals to achieve the planned mobilization. (From Air Force Regulation 45-1, 1 January 1953).\n\nSECTION IV\n\nFISCAL STATE FUNDS - MILITARY DIVISION\n\n1. The. Department of Defense appropriation for Fiscal Year 1966 amounted to $735,000.00. Of this amount $527,650.00 was for the. Military Division. There w~s also a Supplemental appropriation for the Military Division o $100,000.00. In addition, $1,339.60 was carried over from Fiscal Year 1965, and $9,476.59 was transferred from the Civil Defense Division, which is reporting separately, leaving a balance for the Military Division of $638,466.19.\n\n2. Actual expenditures and funds obligated for the operation of the Military Division, this department, and its activities for Fiscal Year 1966, by object, were as indicated below:\n\nPersonal Services Travel Expense Supplies and Materials Communication Services Heat, Liqht, Power ~nd Water Printing and Publicity Repairs and Alterations Rents Insurance and Bonds Equipment Purchases National Guard Units Transfer of Funds:\n\nRetirement and FICA Merit System Health Insurance Miscellaneous Services: Laundry and Subscriptions Registration Fees Janitorial Services National Guard and Adjutants\n\nGeneral Association Dues Obligated, 30 June 1966\n\nLess Reimbursement for Communication, Printing, Maintenance and Janitorial Services furnished other activities Tn+~ 1 Outlay\n\n$251,001.25 7,870.51 14,996.76 18,084.05 4,451. 75 558.35 19,459.51 1,150.14 21,243.51 5,428.27\n\n167' 172.53\n\n25,467.39 924.79\n\n5,230.00\n\n298.71 341.50 1,575.68\n\n1,109.90 33,870.98 $580,235.58\n\n21,086.08 $559,149.50\n\n3.

It will be noted that the major expenditure above was for grants to our Army and Air National Guard units. Section 86-802, Code of Georgia, provides for such grants to defray expenses for necessary maintenance and utility expenses of unit facilities, and for the welfare of its members. These funds are prorated among our 123 Army and Air units on a quarterly basis\"\n\n5. As of 30 June 1966, there were forty (40) full-time and two (2) part-time military and civilian employees paid from State funds in the Military Division of this department.\n\ni\n\nj\n\nSECTION V\n\nPUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE\n\n1. Established to implement the necessary recruiting and promotional programs that serve to enhance membership in the Georgia Army and Air National Guard~ the Public Information Office of the Military Division, State Department of Defense, is staffed by one public information officer and one senior stenographer. An additional function of this office is to create a public awareness of the Guard and to maintain a high degree of acceptance of its aims and missions.\n\n2. The two primary missions of the information office are internal and external programs to achieve the goals of this office. Within the National Guard structure in the State~ this office provides the following services:\n\nThe Georgia Guardsman Magazine\n\n3. In line with the concept that an informed soldier or airman is more efficient, this office publishes bi~onthly The Georgia Guardsman magazine as the primary organ of its internal information program. Distributed in bulk to all ARNG and ANG units in the State for dissemination to enlisted men and mailed directly to each officer, 5,500 copies of each edition are printed by this office.\n\n4.\n\nelude;\n\nResponsibilities of this office in producing the magazine in-\n\nao Writing and reporting on stories of statewide interest concerning the Guard and recording the event by word and picture\n\nb.

Additionally, this office provides fact sheets, folders and pamphlets for interested persons who desire information on the National Guard. In this manner, direct contact is established between this office and the public. Indirect contact is the essence of the external information program which consists primarily of the following:\n\nNews Releases\n\n9. Major events taking place in the National Guard of Georgia are called to the attention of the public by this office with the release of news articles to the State's news media. Examples of the types of releases forwarded to press 9 radio and television news outlets during the period of this report are as follows:\n\na.

Three separate news releases concerning Civil Defense training exercises and exhibits\n\n10. Stories of lesser importance were also distributed. These included news of promotions 9 assumptions of command, attendance at schools~ awards and decorations~ special achievements, etc. In the cases of conferences and encampments listed above, these events generated more news and therefore more localized releases were disseminated. Large quantities of hometown releases and photographs were sent to news media throughout the state from the sites of field training activities. These efforts were in conjunction with assigned public information personnel when assistance was necessary during peak periods of news reporting.\n\nSpecial Events\n\n11. Non-routine activities of this office during the year consisted of the following functions 9 some of which are annual assignments of the public information officer:\n\na.

Both still and motion picture photography was employed by this office to provide more graphic coverage of National Guard activi~ ties. The most extensive use of still photography was during Annual Field Training activities of the 48th Armd Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia when approximately 3,000 prints were made of the Division's training activities.\n\n13.

Money\n\nrequested from the National Guard Bureau for this project was received and construction completed on 6 January 1966. The Data Processing Machines were received from IBM on 14 January 1966. IBM machines presently on hand are as follows:\n\n026 Key Punch\n\n2\n\n056 Key Verifier\n\n1\n\n082 Sorter\n\n1\n\n087 Collator\n\n1\n\n407 Tabulating Machine\n\n1\n\n514 Reproducer\n\n1\n\n548 Interpreter\n\n1\n\n602 Calculator\n\n1\n\n2. At present, civilian payroll, time and attendance records, fiscal accounting, performance data reports, NG unit personnel reports, Self Service Supply Center cataloging and inventory, equipment status, and depot requisitions have been converted to data processing procedures. Plans are being made to add additional functions to ADP during Fiscal Year 1967 which will include stock control and accounting.\n\n3. Utilization of the IBM machines has continued to increase since the date of receipt of the machines. During the month of June 1966, the machines were utilized for a total of 517 hours of operation. As additional functions are added to ADP, machine utilization will be increased.\n\nCHAPTER II ARMY NATIONAL GUARD\n\nsECTION IX\n\nORGANIZATION\n\n1.

Personnel and administration for the Georgia Army National Guard are handled by the Army Personnel Branch of the Adjutant General's Office. This branch prepares and publishes all orders; provides reproduction services; maintains all officer and enlisted personnel records for both the active and inactive National Guard; maintains all records pertaining to, and submits all reports on the strength of the Georgia Army National Guard. Also, administers awards and decorations, processes line of duty investigations and security clearances, and provides guidance and assistance on ad~nistration to units in the field. This branch is responsible for microfilming all officer and enlisted records in the Army and Air National Guard and any other vital records of the department. The branch is also responsible for requisitioning, storing, and distribution of Federal and State forms and publications.\n\nArmy National Guard Strength\n\n2. Fiscal Year 1967 began with an actual strength of 774 officers, 112 warrant officers and 6704 enlisted personnel for an aggregate strength of 7590, The year ended on 30 June 1966 with an actual assigned strength of 787 officers, 107 warrant officers and 7330 enlisted personnel for an aggregate strength of 8224. A break down of actual and authorized strength is shown in Section IX of this report. In spite of the fact that on 1 December 1965 the 48th Armored Division was reorganized to reflect a priority aggregate strength of fifty (50) percent of its current Table of Organization the strength figure indicates an overall increase of 634 individuals. This is attributed to units being able to retain any one over the priority aggregate of a unit for a period of one (1) year, or until reaching this figure by normal attrition, and the ability to enlist individuals from inactivated USAR units without regard to strength limitations.\n\nPersonnel Actions (Officers)\n\n3. The Officers' Section processed 92 applications for initial appointment in the Georgia Army National Guard, 262 request for reassignment or transfer, and more than 1,200 officer and warrant officer efficiency reports and medical examinations were screened thoroughly before being forwarded to the National Guard Bureau. During the year, this section processed 135 applications for promotion of officers and warrant officers to a higher ~rade, 63 officer and warrant officer records were processed for separation\n\nrom the active Georgia Army National Guard, 16 officer and warrant officers ~reordered to leave, and 141 were ordered to appear before Federal Examin~9 Board. This section maintains current status and locator file cards on :0~ officer: and warrant officers. This section also maintains an up-to-date\n\n~ determ1nation card on all officers in the Georgia Army National Guard 1~: processes all correspondence and reports pertaining to elimination, man-\n\nory PrQmotions and declinations.\n\nPersonnel Actions (Enlisted)\n\n4. During this fiscal year, this section processed more than 7,250 individual morning reports, This processing included receipt, checking for correctness, posting of status changes, and verification before transmittal to the National Guard Bureau for statistical purposes. The 98 units of the Georgia Army National Guard have a large turnover of personnel, causing the section to process some 18,237 personnel records a year. The section is responsible for preparing various certificates of service pertaining to individuals who have, from time to time, served in the military service of the State of Georgia. The section carefully screens all 201 files and othe1 pertinent records to insure that all necessary documents and other material having a direct bearing on the individual's service are included. It is from these records that the section prepares and submits statements of service and other military information when needed. Great care is exercised in the preparation of these statements of service by examination of enlistment records, service records, special orders, morning reports, and payrolls for completeness and accuracy. It is most important that this information be carefully checked since statements of service can affect the individual's benefits, rates of pay, and conditions of retirement. Approximately 1,497 requests for statements of service were received during the year ranging from Civil War service to the present time. In addition to the above, the section handled the following personnel actions during the year: 1,522 new enlistments; 1,484 reenlistments; 1,522 total gains; 1,306 total losses; 82 transfers to inactive National Guard; and 71 transfers from inactive to active.\n\nSecurity Clearances\n\n5. The Army Personnel Branch processes all requests for security clearances and maintains a master file of such clearances for members of the National Guard. During the fiscal year, approximately 250 security clearances were processed to Third United States Army for classification categories of Top Secret and Secret.\n\nLine of Duty Investigations\n\n6. The branch is responsible for establishing the necessary procedures for, and reviewing all line of duty investigations made on individuals who sustain an injury or disease while attending annual active duty for training or armory drills. During the fiscal year, 33 formal line of duty investigations and 16 administrative determinations were processed and reviewed Of the 33 line of duty investigations, 9 cases involved personnel in an armory drill status, and 24 cases resulted from annual active duty for training.\n\nProperty Control Auditor\n\n7. The Property Control Auditor performed 129 audits of unit fund accounts of Georgi~ Army National Guard units and 22 Georgia Air National Guard units. Conducted annual property inventory and maintained property records of all State property within the Georgia National Guard. Maintains\n\natorage, issues and turnf-in df all_State.propeGrty to include awards and deco-\n\ntions for personnel o the Georgia National uard. Further, he received,\n\nrtrocessed applications, and issued 3,564 distinctive Georgia National Guard\n\nricense plates to individuals of the Guard and processed approximately 350\n\n:~PlDiecpaatritomnesnt\n\nfor transfer of National Guard license plates. Also, Loan Officer for the Small Agencies Credit Union for\n\nserves State em-\n\nployees.\n\nService Schools\n\na. As the equipment issued to the Georgia Army National Guard becomes\n\nmore complex and increases in cost, and the educational requirements for promotion are increased, it is es~ential that selected personnel be sent to schools conducted by the active Army. The Department of the Army has made the following types of schools available to personnel of the Georgia Army\n\nNational Guard:\n\na. Army Service Schools.\n\nb. Army Extension Schools (These schools provide a means whereby an individual may qualify himself professionally and educationally through correspondence courses, and are very beneficial to individuals who cannot get away from their civilian work to attend the regular service schools).\n\nDuring the fiscal year, this branch processed 210 applications for various service schools and issued 152 orders directing attendance at service schools for the number of officers and enlisted men indicated below:\n\nOfficers & Warrant Officers\n\nEnlisted Men\n\n116\n\n36\n\nThis figure includes 14 individuals who attended the Special National Guard Army Officer Candidates Schools at Fort Benning, Georgia, and Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The program is supported entirely from Federal funds, and $162,267.00 were allocated to the State by the Federal Government to support this program during the fiscal year. It should be noted here that the total funds expended this fiscal year were much smaller than the preceding year. This is due to a large cut back in school funds by the Department of the Army.\n\nAwards and Decorations\n\n9. The division is responsible for the awards and decorations program to include:\n\nState Decorations (Georgia Distinctive Service Medal; Georgia Meritorious Service Medal; Georgia Medal for Valor; and the Georgia Distinctive Foreign Service Medal)\n\nState Service Medals (Georgia National Guard Service Medal, and State Active Duty Ribbons)\n\nCommendations by The Adjutant General\n\nArmed Forces Reserve Medal\n\nFederal Awards\n\na. Outstanding awards and decorations for the fiscal year just passed are indicated in Section II of this report.\n\nPre-Camp Conferences\n\n10. Federal funds were made available to the State during the fiscal year for the purpose of conducting pre-camp conferences and reconnaissance of the annual field training area. These conferences allow commanders and staff officers to coordinate and complete details pertaining to field training prior to departure from home station. This section issued 57 orders ordering over 126 individuals for 288 man days of this training.\n\nNew Reserve Enlistment Program\n\n11. The New Reserve Enlistment Program became effective 11 August 1963, This program was in effect a revision of the Six Month Training Program (RFA 55). The program requires all non-prior service personnel who enlist in the Army National Guard to complete an active duty period at a Regular Army training installation. During the fiscal year, 102 non-prior service personnel from the Georgia Army National Guard entered this training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, or Fort Benning, Georgia. This makes a total of more than 8,640 trainees from the Georgia Guard who have received this valuable training since its inception in 1957. The drop in trainees scheduled into the program during the fiscal year was caused by increased Selective Service calls to build up the Regular Army for the Vietnam crisis. The State has over 1500 trainees awaiting a quota into the program at this time.\n\nMicrofilm Section\n\n12. During the year, this section continued the task of microfilming all records to be retained. After screening each record to insure that only essential records were microfilmed, the section reduced some 220,000 individual images to film. After the films are processed, the old records are shipped to the State Archives for storage. This section also does research of individual records to obtain information required for Statements of Service.\n\nMilitary Publications\n\n13. The Publication Section of the Adjutant General's Office has the mission to procure, issue and warehouse all administrative, technical, training and supply publications and blank forms required by all activities and units of the Georgia National Guard to enable them to accomplish their assigned mission. This section is responsible for the receipt and distribution\n\nall units and activities of the Georgie National Guard, all new or re-\n\nt~sed publications or forms issued by the 1 Adjutant General of Georgia,\n\n~ artment of the Army, and the National Guard Bureau.

Training Categories\n\nTraining in the Army National Guard falls in five (5) general categories:\n\na. Armory training assemblies.\n\nb. Week-end or Multiple Unit Training Assemblies (MUTA).\n\nc. Annual Active Duty for Training (ACDUTRA).\n\nd. Service schools.\n\ne. Army Extension Courses (correspondence)o\n\n3. Attachments for Training Supervision\n\nIn order to achieve effective coordination and supervision of training, units of the 48th Armored Division are attached as follows:\n\nHeadquarters, 48th Armored Division\n\nHHC, 48th Armd Div - Macon 148th Aviation Battalion 248th Signal Battalion 560th Engineer Battalion\n\n1st Brigade, 48th Armored Division\n\nHHC, 1st Bde, 48th Armd Div - Macon 2d Battalion (M) l2lst Infantry 3d Battalion, 108th Armor 4th Battalion, 108th Armor\n\n2d Brigade, 48th Armored Division\n\nHHC, 2d Bde, 48th Armd Div - Forsyth lst Squadron, 748th Cavalry lst Battalion, l08th Armor 2d Battalion, l08th Armor lst Battalion (M), l2lst Infantry\n\n3d Brigade, 48th Armored Division\n\nHHC, 3d Bde, 48th Armd Div - Winder 5th Battalion, l08th Armor 3d Battalion (M), l2lst Infantry 4th Battalion (M), l2lst Infantry\n\nHeadquarters, 48th Armored Division Artillery\n\nHHB, 48th Armd Div Arty - Savannah lst Battalion (105, SP), ll8th Artillery 2d Battalion (105, SP), ll8th Artillery 3d Battalion (105, SP), ll8th Artillery lst Battalion (155, SP), l79th Artillery- Atlanta lst Battalion (HJ), 214th Artillery- Elberton\n\nHeadquarters, 48th Armored Division Support Command\n\nHeadquarters and Band - Decatur 348th Medical Battalion 448th Supply and Transportation Battalion 548th Administration Company - Atlanta 648th Maintenance Battalion\n\n4. Supervision and Control of Training\n\nCommand and control of the units of the Georgia Army National Guard is exercised through the normal military chain of command. As an example, the 48th Armored Division has 21 Battalion Headquarters which are the first controlling echelon above company level. The 3 Brigades, the Division Artillery, and the Support Command Headquarters constitute the 5 major command headquarters which supervise the battalions. Also, division headquarters supervises directly three separate battalions of the division; these are the Aviation, Engineer and the Signal Battalions. Supervision and control of these organizations is accomplished by multiple means. Visits to units are made by Staff Qfficers from battalion and higher headquarters. Staff Q;fficers inspect, observe and report their findings to the unit commander and to the headquarters directing the visit. Written records of staff visits tp units are made and a copy is submitted to Division Headquarters and The State Adjutant General. In addition to visits by Staff Officers, each unit receives a command inspection by the Commander of a higher headquarters at least once a year. Other methods are used to determine the effectiveness of individuals and units. These are records and reports to include Annual General Inspections, conducted by Third Army Headquarters; Command Management Maintenance Inspections and check~ ing training schedules to insure compliance with training directives.\n\n5. Service School Training .\n\nOne of the principle means of improving the military education\n\n:;myd qualification of personnel of the Army National Guard is through Service Schools. During FY 1966, 96 individuals attended a rvice school. Twenty-one (21) other individuals are awaiting orders. :total of $159,224.69 in Federal funds has been committed for service schools for FY 1967.\n\n6. Annual General Inspections\n\nThe high point of armory training is the annual general inspection, when Inspectors General of the Regular Army test the proficiency of the unit in such fields as:\n\n1. Adherence to prescribed Army training directives. 2. Alert and mobilization readiness. 3. Supply, administration and motor maintenance. 4. Care and maintenance of weapons, armories, records, vehicles and equipment. 5. Personal knowledge, morale and appearance of individuals. 6. Leadership qualities of officers and noncommissioned officers.\n\nThe 97 units (company size) inspected during the training year were graded as follows:\n\nSuperior\n\n- 19\n\nExcellent - 69\n\nSatisfactory - 9\n\n7. Annual Active Duty for Training\n\nAnnual Active Duty for Training consists of two weeks of field training and is normally conducted at an Army Post where logistical and administrative support are provided as needed by the Regular services. Units of the Georgia Army National Guard attended field training at Fort Stewart, Georgia, during the training year. A part of this train~ ing is the movement to and from the camp from local armories emphasizing training in convoy discipline, bivouacs, security and road march procedure.\n\nTraining includes practical tactical exercises on suitable terrain and with logistical support not available at armory and week-end train-\n\ning sites. Combined unit exercises teach teamwork in operations at battalion, brigade and division level. It further orients all participants on capabilities and functions of supporting and allied organic forces.\n\nThe active duty field training also affords boards of Regular Army Officers an opportunity to evaluate, analyze and measure the combat efficiency of National Guard units, personnel and equipment. Results are disseminated to Department of Defense agencies concerned. The\n\nunits of the Georgia Army National Guard were rated as follows:\n\nSuperior\n\n- 28\n\nExcellent - 67\n\nSatisfactory - 0\n\nSECTION XIII ARMY TECHNICIAN PROGRAM (CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES)\n\nTECHNICIAN STRUCTURE - MISSION AND PURPOSE\n\n1. Federally supported civilian employees with Georgia Army National Guard units are termed Army National Guard Technicians. Federal funds, allotted to Georgia, expended for the payment of salaries of these technicians who are, in most cases members of the National Guard unit with which they are employed, directly contribute to the administration and operation of the Georgia Army National Guard; however, a small portion of these technicians are female and non-guard male employees and are not required to be members of the Georgia Army National Guard.\n\n2. This program is administered for The Adjutant General of Georgia by a Technician Personnel Officer.
