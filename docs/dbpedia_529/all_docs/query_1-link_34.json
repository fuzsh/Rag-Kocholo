        "text": "At The Atlas Group, we believe the value of an advisory team is best measured by the goals that clients achieve. Balancing meaning and metrics with our strong competencies and heartfelt care, we share a desire to deliver a wealth management experience beyond what clients expect, but certainly deserve.\n\nIt is our practice to:\n\n• See each client as an individual – with important pursuits, purposes and people in their lives.\n\n• Help clients plan and prepare for financial transitions, as well as likely and unlikely circumstances.\n\n• Ask questions that lead to thoughtful discussions and strategies, such as:\n\n\"What's on your mind?\"\n\n\"What's your definition of financial success?\"\n\n\"What financial or life lessons do you want to make sure your family knows?\"\n\n\"For whom are you responsible – a spouse, elderly parent, adult child?\n\n\"What about your employees – are you looking out for them, if something were to happen to you?\"\n\n\"What's on your bucket list?\"\n\n\"What drives you?\"\n\n\"Why have you come to us?\"\n\n• Listen carefully to clients individually, in family meetings, at curated client gatherings, and in focus groups with outside moderators. On these occasions, we want to understand what we are doing well and where we can improve.\n\n• Show clients how intergenerational wealth strategies can help lead to desired lifestyles and legacies.\n\n• Assist business owners and executives with the design and management of their executive compensation plans and corporate retirement plans. Our commitment extends to their employees through our team's financial wellness and employee education resources.\n\n• Demonstrate that \"going the extra mile is never going out of our way.\" We have accompanied clients to local Social Security offices and on tours of assisted living facilities. We have sat with clients in hospital rooms and at funerals. On a regular basis, we host meetings in our office with clients, their CPAs and attorneys to align tax-minimization and estate planning strategies."
