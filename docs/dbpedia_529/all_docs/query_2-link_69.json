Summers and Rene Chartrand. Consisting of quarto-sized plates to provide images of French, British, and Canadian uniforms, the review feels this would be a very helpful work in identification of uniforms often confused with American militia or Confederate soldiers. The second review is of Gallant Fourteenth: the Story of an Indiana Civil War Regiment by Nancy Niblack Baxter. The author drew from primary source documents such as diaries and letters to compose a regimental history with descriptions of the individuals and battles along with a collection of images. Finally, the book The Hardtack Regiment: an Illustrated History of the 154th Regiment, New York State Infantry Volunteers by Mark H. Dunkelman and Michael J. Winey is reviewed. The volume includes several images of members of the regiment, complete with biographies.\n\nJohn Hartranft, Defender of the Union by Harry Roach (pp. 4-9)\n\nA little known commander from Pennsylvania, Col. John Frederick Hartranft was often involved in some of the major campaigns of the Civil War. After his 90-day militia regiment left the day before the fighting at First Bull Run (their enlistment had expired), Nartranft remained and fought with valor, eventually receiving the Medal of Honor for his rallying of two Massachusetts regiments at the end of the action. He returned to Pennsylvania and raised the 51st Pennsylvania Infantry, which was often linked with the careers of Edward Ferrero and Ambrose Burnside. Despite being a teetotaler, Hartranft led his hard-drinking 51st at New Bern, during the last push at “Burnside’s Bridge” at Antietam, at Fredericksburg, Chattanooga, and several other campaigns, often without due recognition. He was hailed as the “Hero of Fort Stedman” at the end of the war, culminating his career as Brevet Major General.\n\nImages of the 51st Pennsylvania Infantry (pp. 10-13)\n\nA collection of 19 images of members of 51st Pennsylvania Infantry follows the biographical article of their colonel, John Hartranft.\n\nThe Havelock by Don Dillon (pp. 14-15)\n\nThe article and accompanying images features the seldom used uniform hat cover, which draped over the back of the neck in order to protect from sunburn and heatstroke. Popularized during the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857 and a staple of the French Foreign Legion, the havelock was only popular at the beginning of the Civil War as it did not provide the air circulation that soldiers preferred. One of the four images includes an alternative to the havelock in the form of a kepi with a brim as worn by the 5th New Hampshire Infantry.\n\nSunshine Soldiers: New Jersey’s Nine Months Regiments at the Battle of Fredericksburg by Joseph G. Bilby (pp. 16-23, 13)\n\nThe author uses many personal stories to describe how New Jersey developed a nine-month system of militia service in parallel with a regimental system requiring three year commitments. The article describes the chaos of training camp and the politics behind the election of officers, using the election of George Mindil as the “Boy Colonel” of the 17th New Jersey due to his recent service with General Phil Kearney, who had recently been killed at the Battle of Chantilly. Mindil got his regiment into disciplined order while training them in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol building, while other nine-month regiments were not as disciplined. As the nine-month regiments moved towards and then into Fredericksburg, the men had different experiences – from participating in looting to experiencing the horrors of the fighting–which augment the overall story of the Battle of Fredericksburg.\n\nThe Girl I Left Behind Me by Carol Villa (pp. 24-31)\n\nThirty-three different images, most of them cartes de visite, ambrotypes or tintypes, illustrate this pictorial of the men who fought in the Civil War with the women for whom they fought. The images provide a wider sense of the more common forms of dress of the era than do the periodicals of the time, which were often the more elaborate “fashion plates” that guided more understated lifestyles. A few of the images are taken outdoors: one was at Lookout Mountain and another is of a woman riding sidesaddle on a horse led by a soldier. However, most are studio images that include wives, sisters, children, and mothers.\n\nBack Image\n\nA touching image of Lt. Col. Judson Kilpatrick of the 2nd New York Cavalry and his wife, who is wearing a fur-trimmed winter mantle with muff.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. 3, No. 3\n\n(32 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover Image\n\nA previously unpublished quarter-plate melainotype taken in 1866 of General Robert E. Lee astride his horse Traveller.\n\nEditor’s Page (inside front cover)\n\nThe editor announces not only a change in address, but his marriage to Military Image attorney.\n\nMail Call (p. 2)\n\nLetters from subscribers provide their comments about past issues and suggestions for those in the future. Of interest was a recently discovered photograph of “Stonewall” Jackson. The editor described how the identification of the casual soldier in a private’s coat was made.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 3)\n\nThe feature begins with a review of Autographs of the Confederacy by Michael Reese II, which is based on the collection of autographs compiled by John F. Mayer, who was a clerk in the Confederate War Department. The beautifully bound book contains the signatures of many notable individuals, including all of the Confederate general officers, some of which are extremely rare. The second review is of The Image of War, 1861-1865, Volume 1: The Shadows of the Storm edited by William C. Davis. Containing over 650 images with context provided by noted specialists, this first of a projected six volumes was given high marks.\n\nMemoirs of a Rebel, Part I: South Mountain and Sharpsburg by John Calvin Gorman (pp. 4-6)\n\nEdited by his grandson, George Gorman, North Carolina journalist John C. Gorman wrote out his memoirs of his time as a captain in Company B, 2nd North Carolina Regiment. This first installment for Military Images describes the action at South Mountain and the battle fought at Sharpsburg, including a stirring description of what it was like to fight in the “Bloody Lane” where so many of both sides fell.\n\nThe Hanging by William Christen (pp. 7-8)\n\nThe author takes the reader on a sleuthing mission to discover the truth behind two postcard photographs found in his grandfather’s collection of World War I photographs. Taken on board the Indiana in 1918, the details of the story behind the gleeful seamen, a lack of officers, and a hanging victim are revealed.\n\nU.S. Army Uniforms of the Civil War, Part III: The Artillery by Robert Borrell, Sr. (pp. 9-15)\n\nA collection of 19 images accompanies this article which describes the uniform requirements of the Federal artillery as worn in the Civil War by both enlisted and officer ranks, and by light and heavy artillery. One trio of images shows the wear of frock and sack coats as well as the shell jacket, while another trio shows the wear of Hardee, kepi, and plug hats. An interesting feature of the pictorial is the close-up images of a gold bullion artillery insignia worn on the kepi of 2d Lt. Eben Hall of the 4th Connecticut Infantry as well as two different commercially purchased badges engraved with a soldier’s name.\n\nThe Few, the Forgotten: The Confederate States Marines by David L. Sullivan (pp. 16-21)\n\nDifficult to research as the official records of the Confederate States Marine Corps were burned in Richmond at the end of the Civil War, the article traces the development and history of this little known group. With service as diverse at guarding shipping in dock at New Orleans to participating in on the Virginia as it fought at Hampton Roads to fighting at Saylor’s Creek, the four companies of the Confederate Marines were involved in conflict with the Federals consistently throughout the war. The article includes several images of notable Confederate Marines along with short biographies.\n\nHarvard Crimson to Horizon Blue: The Odyssey of Parker Ellis by Dale Biever (pp. 22-23)\n\nMany young American men, several from Ivy League schools, decided to fight in World War One long before the United States entered the conflict in 1917. One of these was Parker Ellis, who left Harvard in early 1917. Photographs that accompany the article show his transition from an ambulance driver for the American Field Service in France and Italy to his training with the French Foreign Legion. Eventually serving as a lieutenant with the 260th Artillery, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery for his actions in the field in October 1918, shown in a portrait taken in 1919. He was not yet 22 years of age.\n\n“U.S. Official:” A look at the Signal Corps photos of the First World War by Philip Katcher (pp. 24-26)\n\nFive large format images, each marked with a “U.S. Official” stamp, from the collection of the author show very different aspects of the conflict. From soldiers of the Signal Corps wearing special gas masks that allowed them to communicate normally to camouflaged snipers returning from the trenches to a group of Americans with a captured German Howitzer, these images provide detail that many other images of the time were unable to obtain. The collection also includes a group photograph of a mobile “Dental Car” sent from New York, with dentists ready to apply their skills. The final image of the pictorial is a unique view of troops of different nations from both sides of the conflict – German and Austrian, American and British – apparently celebrating the Armistice that called an end to the fighting of World War One.\n\nPrivate Benjamin Franklin: Company H, 2d Minnesota Cavalry by William Gladstone (p. 27)\n\nThe article presents a fund-raising carte de visite featuring Private Franklin, the only soldier of the era to undergo and survive partial amputation of all four limbs. Caught in a snowstorm after escorting a wagon train as part of his Indian fighting duty, and without shelter or food for a week, Franklin was the only survivor from the detail. He was rescued by friendly Indians and brought to Fort Ridgley for treatment. While provided with a small government pension, Private Franklin sold copies of his carte de visite for a quarter as a way to earn extra income, a “not uncommon practice after the Civil War.”\n\nStragglers (pp. 28-31)\n\nFrom Company H, 31st Michigan Infantry celebrating the birthday of General Robert E. Lee in Savannah in 1899 on their way to Cuba to some unique personal additions to regulation uniforms, this edition of “Stragglers” includes some unusual images. A previously unpublished image of Col. Frederick G. D’Utassy of the 39th New York “Garibaldi Guard,” an unofficial “foreign legion” fighting with the Union, is presented. Readers are also given a quiz to test their knowledge: How many of the four images of soldiers in grey are Yanks?\n\nBack Image\n\nThe elaborate image of a sergeant in the 2nd Regiment, Wisconsin National Guard, Oshkosh from between 1878 and 1886 is featured.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. 3, No. 2\n\n(32 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover Image\n\nCaptain Houston B. Lowerie, adjutant of the 6th North Carolina Infantry, Law’s Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia, killed at Sharpsburg.\n\nEditor’s Page (inside front cover)\n\nThe editor addresses the perception of readers that the publication has a Union bias. Most of the MI staff reenact with the 4th Texas Infantry, and he notes that there will be a number of Confederate focused articles in upcoming issues. The editor repeats his call for Confederate stories, as the submissions of the readership determine the contents of the magazine.\n\nMail Call (p. 2)\n\nA number of readers send in their appreciation for the quality of the publication and for some of the articles in particular. One letter provides additional details on Christian Fleetwood, whose portrait was featured on a recent issue.\n\nVirginia in October: Or Losing the Buckland Races by Alexander S. Barnes (p. 3)\n\nThe portrait of Lt. Willard Glazer of the Second Harris Light Cavalry of New York accompanies this article, which describes his capture by the Confederate cavalry led by Stuart and Gordon. Fought outside of Buckland Mills, Virginia on October 19, 1863, the rout of the Federal troops became known by the Rebels as the “Buckland Races.”\n\nThree Views of the Militia by H. Michael Madaus (pp. 4-5)\n\nTaken of different units from the “Old Northwest Territory” between 1860 and 1879, these images of full militia companies are considered quite rare. The first is from the Waukesha Home Guard taken in 1860 prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. They feature grey uniforms with dark trousers which were replaced with the state issue militia uniform when they became Company F, 5th Regiment, Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry in 1861. The second image is of a company of apparently new recruits from during the war, perhaps called up to engage in the Great Sioux Uprising or to become part of a new Union contingent. A notation on the reverse identifies the unit as being from Sheboygan in 1863, but a comparison between the picture and Wisconsin records of the “Lima Home Guards” or the “Sheboygan Falls Home Guard” do not match the weaponry shown. Finally, another enigmatic unit apparently from Illinois is shown, wearing uniforms of the 1872 regulations.\n\nAcross the Plains by Mark H. Jordan and Dennis S. Lavery (pp. 6-9)\n\nExcerpted from an upcoming biography on John Gibbon called Iron Brigade General, the article describes the Army convoy that left Fort Leavenworth in June 1860 for Camp Floyd, Utah. The article goes into detail regarding the family life of the Gibbons family during the trek, including humorous incidents that happened along the way, such as buffalo being chased by a lieutenant on a mule (future Confederate General John B. Villepigue) and a colonel who declined to eat a pie made from crow (future Union General Philip St. George Cooke). The others who took part in the journey reads almost like a “who’s-who” of the Civil War, such as Bernard Bee and John Buford, and brings a more relaxed and human image of these men who now have such martial reputations.\n\nA Leatherneck in France, 1917-1919 by Albert E. Powis (pp. 10-15)\n\nThe personal recollections of a machine gunner who served with the U.S. Marine Corps in France are published for the first time in this issue of Military Images. Covering his service in the 66th Co., 1st Btn., 5th Marines from training through the trenches of France and then back home, these frank and candid descriptions allow the reader to discover how trenches were built, what the weaponry was like, and what the fighting was like that got his unit called the “U.S. Devil Dogs” by the enemy. It is powerful and compelling reading, accompanied by several of Powis’ collection of photographs of his comrades and officers at war.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 15)\n\nThis issue of MI includes reviews of three publications. The first is The 4th Mariends and Soochow Creek: the Legend and the Medal by F.C. Brown, J.E. Lelle, and R.J. Sullivan which describes the “China Marines” that served in the Shanghai International Settlement from 1927 to 1941. The second book is Ten More Texans in Gray, edited by W. C. Nunn, which is a sequel to a previous work. Each of the ten biographies is written by a graduate student of the editor at Texas Christian University and covers a range of influential Texans who fought for the Confederacy. Lastly is a guide entitled Civil War Genealogy by George K. Schweitzer, which provides a wealth of resources for those beginning research on their Civil War ancestry.\n\nSurvey: Warriors in Grey by T. Sherman Harding (pp. 16-23)\n\nThis pictorial article features 22 separate images of Confederate soldiers, many of them unidentified, from the collection of Mr. Harding as photographed by George Mensch and Ray B. Wooster. Some of the unusual images include a ninth-plate ambrotype of a Confederate with a buttoned up tri-corner hat that converted into a slouch hat when unbuttoned, a sixth-plate ambrotype of fully-equipped soldier with all his equipment, and a sixth-plate ambrotype of two Confederates wearing “militia” shirts.\n\nMemoirs of Carlos W. Colby edited by Joseph Bilby (pp. 24-29)\n\nServing in Company G of the 97th Illinois Infantry, Colby wrote his memoirs of his service in the Civil War in 1910 when his eyesight began failing. There is no formal history of his unit outside of this memoir, and is of historical value as the 97th Illinois took part in some lesser known campaigns. The editor provides corrections when needed and context to the memoirs. Colby recounts the action at Vicksburg that led to his award of the Congressional Medal of Honor, his many encounters with General Grant, and his exploration around the city of Vicksburg after its surrender. The memoirs provide a great deal of information about a military career that saw a great deal of action, some tragic, some humorous, and some laden with irony.\n\nStragglers (pp. 30-31)\n\nFive different images are included in this edition of “Stragglers” with two of them posing questions for the readership. A quarter-plate tintype of a Union soldier shows an unusual pistol in his belt and a rare 1858 Enfield rifle; three firearms experts were unable to come to a consensus as to the make of the pistol. A very young Yankee first sergeant wearing a frock coat with very unusual markings was also submitted; another collector has an image of a different soldier wearing the exact same unique frock. Readers are asked to provide their insight to these two puzzling images.\n\nBack Image\n\nAn unidentified New York Zouave wearing a plaid shirt is featured.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. 3, No. 1\n\n(32 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover Image\n\nA touching portrait of 1st Lieutenant Winfield Scott Hancock with his three year old son Russell, taken in 1853.\n\nEditor’s Page (inside front cover)\n\nThe editor explains the effect of “hard” images, such as daguerreotypes, tintypes, or ambrotypes, and how these led to what today appears to be “backwards” images and why issues of Military Images does not change these from their original appearance.\n\nMail Call (pp. 2-3)\n\nThe readers’ letters include several clarifications to images from previous issues. Of interest is a comparison of the obverse and reverse of two cartes de visite of Sergeant Amos Humiston, father of the “Children of the Battlefield” images from the Civil War. One is a retouched version that was used for fundraising purposes, with the addition of a beard and Army jacket.\n\n“Galloping Jim” Parker: Cavalryman Extraordinaire, 1872-1918 by Gordon Harrower, Jr. (pp. 4-9)\n\nIncluding ten images spanning the career of “Galloping Jim” Parker and excerpts from an unpublished monography by his son, the reader is treated to an overview of the life of a veteran of the Indian Wars, the Philippine Insurrection, and the Spanish-American War. Parker was also an instructor of cavalry tactics at West Point and eventually commanding the 11th Cavalry. Some of the images are postcard photographs which provide glimpses into the inspection of his cavalry units, from three day recruits to a review at the Texas maneuver camp in 1911 which features a Wright flyer overhead. Not selected to be the commander of the A.E.F. that went into France to fight in World War One, Parker organized can commanded the unit that today is known as the “Big Red One.”\n\nU.S. Army Uniforms of the Civil War, Part II: The Sack Coat by Michael J. McAfee (pp. 10-15)\n\nEssentially the uniform coat worn by the common soldier, the sack coat was a cheaper, mass-produced garment that was to be worn in fatigue situations. Shorter than the frock coat and without a waist seam, this four-button coat was the standard for Union soldiers. The 15 different images provided in this pictorial article show how the uniform was worn, from one “perfect fit” example to many personal alterations done by the soldiers themselves.\n\nWilliam Lytle and the “Boody Tinth” Ohio by James F. Neel (pp. 16-18)\n\nThis article was inspired by a junk yard find of a photograph of ten Union soldiers with the inscription on the reverse describing it as the burial party of Brigadier General William H. Lytle, the commander of the 10th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. A graduate of West Point in 1843, Lytle became a lawyer, only leaving to serve during the Mexican War. Lytle became prominent in 1857 not for being named as major general of the Ohio militia, but as a poet, whose work “Antony and Cleopatra” gained national attention. He saw a great deal of hard action and was wounded several times in the Civil War, eventually leaving the 10th for other command although remaining particularly beloved by the “Bloody Tinth” and its Irish contingent from Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon his death during the Chickamauga campaign in October 1863, members of the 10th were selected to return their general to his home of Cincinnati for burial.\n\nPassing in Review (pp. 19, 31)\n\nThree books are featured for review in this issue of Military Images. First is The Horse Soldiers, 1776-1943 by Randy Steffen. This is a four volume set that covers all aspects of how the cavalry was outfitted, and is highly recommended. The second book passing in review is The Civil War Engagement at Cool Spring, July 18, 1864 by Peter J. Meaney, providing a “fully documented account” of this Virginia battle coming after the Battle of the Monocacy. Lastly is The Great War and Modern Memory by Paul Fussell, an academic work that provides insight into aspects of World War One as diverse as poetry and impact on the use of the English language to the psychology and impact of catastrophe on collective memory. Special attention is given to lesser known poets and writers, as well as the familiar, such as Siegfried Sasson or Wilfred Owen, showing a disconnect between the experience of the trenches and civilian perceptions of the experience.\n\nAntebellum Photography in the Collections of the U.S. Army Military History Institute by Michael J. Winey (pp. 20-30)\n\nA pictorial article with 16 images, the author selected the images for what they are able to tell the reader. The first, for example, is an outdoor daguerreotype that depicts Old Fort Howard in Green Bay, Wisconsin, taken between 1849-1852 when the fort was briefly put back into use. Not only can one see the layout of the fortification, but also uniform styles in use that date back to 1829 regulations. Other images provide detail on 1832 general officer uniforms as well as the opportunity to view younger images of well-known Civil War generals such as Major General Cadmus M. Wilcox of the Confederacy as a 2nd lieutenant and Major General John F. Reynolds as Commandant of Cadets at West Point. A group of officers serving as the U.S. military board observing the militaries of the Crimean War, including a young George McClellan, is juxtaposed with what appears to be a wedding portrait of a happy couple, a second lieutenant in dress frock with a smiling young woman at his side.\n\nPerry’s Saints: A History of the 48th New York Volunteers by Dale S. Snair (pp. 32-35)\n\nFocusing on the careers of two of its outstanding officers, Colonel James H. Perry and Captain James M. Nichols, the author tells the story of the 48th New Yorkers. Perry had a background not only as a veteran of the Texas army fighting against the Mexicans, but also as a minister in Brooklyn where his unit of volunteers was recruited. It was his background as a minister that led the 48th to be known as “Perry’s Saints.” Perry died suddenly at Fort Pulaski, Georgia. Nichols was a 2nd lieutenant in Company G when the unit was formed, and eventually became known as the first man to command the use of the machine gun in warfare. Although the Billinghurst-Requa gun was not a success, Capt. Nichols eventually was put in command of the 48th during the fighting at Cold Harbor in 1864 and took part in the assault at the Crater as well. Resigning his commission due to continuing fatigue from malaria, Nichols left the war, but the 48th continued on, taking part in Sherman’s campaign against Johnston.\n\nTwo Rare Photographs by Stephen Guglielmi and Mark Katz (pp. 36-37)\n\nTwo very rare images are presented for the first time to Military Images readers. A sixth-plate “crayon daguerreotype” of Brevet Lt. Col. Joseph Hooker that dates from 1849 was found in an attic of a Port Arthur, Texas home. The article provides a good deal of information regarding the photographer and the condition of the daguerreotype. In juxtaposition to “Fighting Joe” is another rare image that features “Stonewall” Jackson his adversary at Chancellorsville. This 1862 image is from a quarter-plate ambrotype of a very casual Lt. Gen. Thomas Jonathan Jackson at his camp in Winchester, Virginia, with three others.\n\nStragglers (pp. 38-39)\n\nSix different images are presented. Two images feature musicians: one has young fife and drummer boys from the Civil War while the other shows a musician holding a rare 1872 pattern helmet. World War One soldiers are in one photograph taken in November 1918 wearing flash goggles and winter gear. A rare image of a Volunteer Maine Militia sailor and an officer wearing an overcoat typical of 1900 are also part of the feature.\n\nBack Image\n\nConfederate Corporal Dillard Crowder is pictured in a sitting pose.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. 2, No. 6\n\n(32 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover Image\n\nChristian A. Fleetwood, Sergeant Major of the 4th U.S. Colored Troops, recipient of the Medal of Honor for gallantry in the Battle of Chaffin’s Farm on September 29, 1864.\n\nEditor’s Page (inside front cover)\n\nThe editor provides remarks on the installation of the memorial dedicated to 20th Regiment, New York State Militia, in recognition of its role in the repulse of Pickett’s Charge on July 3, 1863 on the 118th anniversary of the battle.\n\nMail Call (p. 2)\n\nReaders to the publication provide corrections to past issues as well as some intriguing possibilities for the technique that created a rare photograph featured in a past “Stragglers” feature.\n\nRobert Ramsey, C.S.M.C by David Sullivan (p. 3)\n\nTwo images of the same Confederate States Marine Corps officer, Second Lieutenant Robert Ramsey are featured, allowing the reader to get a rare glimpse at the uniform worn by this branch of Confederate service. The article also gives a narrative of Ramsey’s service record, which saw him in Confederate Marine Corps service from October 1861 to July 1862. He did see distinguished service before, during, and after his stint with the Marines, but he also saw trouble, having two court-martials and several other legal charges brought against him.\n\nFight of the Crows: The 15th New Jersey Infantry at the Battle of Cedar Creek by Joseph G. Bilby (pp. 4-15)\n\nThe author provides a detailed accounting of the fighting in the Shenandoah Valley under General Phil Sheridan that culminated in the Battle of Cedar Creek in mid-October 1864. The reader is provided with the opportunity to read about the experiences of many soldiers from the 15th New Jersey, including officers whose images are featured in the article. Some images of the Valley that were taken at the time are also included. Most striking is the image taken of Sergeant Edwin Ulmer, which shows the scars from his hip amputation. Ulmer was one of eight men who survived this extreme surgery. A reunion photograph taken in 1907 accompanies an “Epilogue” which outlines the post-war lives of some of the surviving soldiers from the article.\n\nBlack Troops in the U.S. Military, 1862-1918 by Don Dillon (pp. 16-25)\n\nA pictorial with 22 different images, this article ties in with the cover image and gives an overview of different aspects of black service in the U.S. military. The article is broken up into three sections and features the uniforms, individual images, and a discussion of the changes seen in how the military utilized this group of soldiers. For example, a “before and after” series of cartes de visite of Drummer Jackson were produced by abolitionists during the Civil War. The service of blacks between 1866 and 1899 included the “Buffalo” soldier and the arrival of the first black cadet at West Point, featured in an informal photograph of the Class of 1880. The era of 1900 to 1918 saw the restriction of blacks from combat service under Woodrow Wilson, but this did not keep the black soldier or sailor from participating in the U.S. military, as shown by the three photographs at the end of the article.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 25)\n\nFour very different books are reviewed in this issue of Military Images, beginning with Fritz Nagel’s work entitled Fritz: The World War I Memoirs of a German Lieutenant. It recounts the author’s service in a combat-support unit with humor and unexpected tales of his activities, to include smuggling his own wife into his encampment for a five-week visit. The second offering is Collection, Use, and Care of Historical Photographs by Robert A. Weinstein and Larry Booth; while not focused on military photography, it does provide an excellent guide to careful preservation of historical images. Third is the book Muddy Glory: American ‘Indian Wars’ in the Philippines, 1899-1935 by Russell Roth. The book traces the development of the American fighting force from smaller Indian conflicts to one that provided the basis for leadership in World War Two, making a parallel with the Vietnam conflict. Last is Richmond Redeemed: The Siege at Petersburg by Richard J. Sommers, a highly researched academic work which focuses on four days of fighting focusing on Cockade City in a highly readable text.\n\nThe 29th Connecticut Infantry by William Gladstone (pp. 26-27)\n\nThe author of this brief regimental history purchased five stereo photographs that led him to investigate the black unit they documented: the 29th Connecticut Infantry. The three outdoor images shown are of the unit upon their deployment to Beaufort, South Carolina in April 1864. The stereo photographs are attributed to Sam A. Cooley; other sets of the images are held by both the National Archives and the Library of Congress.\n\nStragglers (pp. 28-30)\n\nThis issues has a combined 14 different images submitted by various readers. Of note is a series of three that depict the same individual (James Krom of the 120th New York Infantry): prior to enlistment, about the time of his wounding at Gettysburg, and after promotion to sergeant. Another is Major Walter A. Van Rensselaer from the unit mentioned on the Editor’s Page of the current issue. A group image of what appears to be Confederates is offered with a request for any clarifying information.\n\nRear Image\n\nThe ninth-plate ambrotype of this soldier, Private Luther Ladd of the 6th Massachusetts Infantry, was used as a negative to reproduce this photograph. It was also used to create memorial issues throughout the Civil War. Private Ladd was killed in the Baltimore riots of April 1861 as his unit made its way to Washington, D.C.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. 2, No. 5\n\n(32 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover Image\n\nThis “April Fools” issue of Military Images features a ninth-plate tintype of a Massachusetts militia man wearing his uniform backwards. It does offer the reader a very good look at the details on the back of the uniform coat.\n\nEditor’s Page (inside front cover)\n\nThe editor explains the images found on the front and back of this month’s issue.\n\nMail Call (p. 2)\n\nThe readers contributed a logical solution to one of the cryptic messages found in a previous issue. Another reader writes that he was able to identify the uniform worn by an officer in a recently purchased quarter-plate tintype he had purchased based on an article he had read.\n\nJohn Stocking, U.S.N: Unsung Hero of the Monitor by Charles S. Schwartz (p. 3)\n\nAccompanied by a full-body carte de visite of Boatswain’s Mate John Stocking, the short article provides the information known about the sailor, who was swept overboard while trying to disconnect his ship, the USS Monitor, which was tied up while being towed by the USS Rhode Island.\n\nOrigins of the Confederate Uniform by Philip Katcher (pp. 4-7)\n\nThe article shows that there is a distinct European influence on the designs of the Confederate military uniform. Many components, such as the rank on the collar and the intricate lacework on the arms of the officer coat, came from the Austrian military. The lacework or braid was also called the “Austrian knot,” and was also used by the French military to designate rank on the kepi, which the Confederate military also had adopted in part and called the “French pattern.” Some aspects of the Union uniform were kept, such as chevrons for non-commissioned officers and branch of service colors; the exceptions were for the Confederate medical corps which was assigned black and the cavalry which was given yellow. While not all of the dress regulations were able to be effectively enforced, the article does provide a good deal of detail on what the intended Confederate uniform was to look like.\n\nThe Children of the Battlefield by William Gladstone (pp. 8-9)\n\nAfter dying on the streets of Gettysburg, an unidentified soldier grasped an ambrotype image of three children. He was buried, and the image was turned over to Dr. J. Francis Bourns, who had carte de visite images made and saw them distributed so the identity of the fallen soldier could be made and his family notified of where he lay. Philinda Humiston was able to identify her children Franklin, Alice, and Frederick, and her husband Amos was reinterred at the National Cemetery at Gettysburg as a result. A total of five different issues of “The Children of the Battle Field” cartes de visite were issued, creating a fund to support the Soldiers’ Orphans Home in Gettysburg. The Humiston children were brought there for their education, and Mrs. Humiston was employed as matron. The article provides a great deal of information about the Humiston family, details about the different issues, and how fundraising was generated by the distribution of the children’s image.\n\nYerba Buena Island, California: A Look at the New U.S. Naval Training Station in 1901 by John Stacey (pp. 10-15)\n\nTwelve different images accompany this article about the history behind the training station, the facilities that were provided to the “apprentices and landsmen” who were trained there, the ships they used, what skills they learned, and some of the demographic data about the first year. From sleeping in hammocks to doing wash as a group activity to taking a class on naval mathematics, the photographs included provide a glimpse into the life of a naval trainee at the start of a new century.\n\n“Your affectionate son…:” The Civil War Letters of Pvt. Harley J. Hilborn, 145th Pennsylvania Volunteers by Eileen F. Conklin (pp. 16-21)\n\nThis issue of Military Images takes a touching and in-depth look at another popular kind of memorabilia, that of the personal letter written home. The letters that Private Hilborn wrote to different members of his family give the reader a great deal of insight into his life from a new recruit in September 1862 through his experiences fighting up to and including his wounding in Fredericksburg in December. He was transferred to Douglass Hospital in Washington, D.C. and wrote from his hospital bed, describing his experiences and eventually asking his father to come and see him. His father arrived the day before he died of his injuries on January 2, 1863.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 21)\n\nTwo books are reviewed in this issue. The first is Cry Comanche by Harold H. Simpson, which provides a history of the Fifth U.S. Cavalry, receiving a mixed review. The second book discussed is the reprinting of The Twentieth Maine: A Volunteer Regiment of the Civil War by John J. Pullen.\n\nMilitary Monkey Business by Don Dillon (pp. 22-25)\n\nKeeping with the “April Fools” theme from the front cover, this pictorial features ten images of military men letting loose in one way or another. In one photograph from Japan taken between 1908 and 1913 shows sailors and a Marine sharing Kirin Lager in a “wetting down party.” Two forms of punishment are shown, with one man being guarded while being confined to the barrel of a cannon and one man “riding a rail” that was crafted to look like a horse. Different action shots of men in the Civil War staging friendly-looking fights are shown, as is one shot of a Pennsylvania National Guardsman taking aim at a “crazed Moro” at a 1909 encampment.\n\nA Lancaster Lad Goes to War in 1898 by Clifford B. Weaver (pp. 26-27)\n\nThe adventures of Private Peter Allabach, Jr. of Company L, 4th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, are the focus of this article as he made his way toward the Spanish-American War. Two photographs, likely taken at home while on furlough, complete the story.\n\nStragglers (pp. 28-31)\n\nEighteen different images comprise the “Stragglers” from this issue. An unidentified Marine officer in his immaculate dress uniform taken in Yokohama, Japan in about 1890 leads off. There are many images of Civil War POWs, including “Happy Family, Cell No. 1” consisting of Confederates captured in Morgan’s Raid and a barefoot Union soldier after his release. One of the images includes “Buckskin Charlie,” a Civil War veteran of the G.A.R, along with two other Southern Utes in a photograph taken in Colorado in the 1880s.\n\nBack Image\n\nThe image of a soldier taken with a statue of an elephant on the table next to him reveals that he has “seen the elephant.” This was mid-19th century symbolism meaning that he has seen combat and survived.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. 2, No. 4\n\n(32 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover Image\n\nA sixth-plate tintype image of a Yankee cavalry man in a sitting pose.\n\nEditor’s Page (inside front cover)\n\nThe editor of Military Images answers the frequent concern that the magazine does not include enough articles on the Confederacy. The editor reminds readers that the content of the publication comes from the readership, and that someone needs to write the articles with Confederate content to have it included.\n\nMail Call (p. 2)\n\nThe author of the cover article on the 9th Infantry and Colonel Liscum received a response from General Matthew B. Ridgway, providing further context on the history of the unit and the regard for which Liscum was held. Another helpful letter came from Rene Chartrand of Parks Canada and provided correction and context for a few images for which he held expertise.\n\nThe Narrow Escape of Francis Marion White by Ronn Palm (p. 3)\n\nIn a twist of fate between “honorable opponents” in October 1864, the competition between the “Old Ringgold” of the Union and McNeill’s Rangers of the Confederacy led to the Rangers intervening on behalf of one of their opponents against John S. Mosby’s Rangers. After being ordered to destroy a still in “Mosby’s Confederacy,” the men of the Ringgold Cavalry apprehended a Baptist minister who was one of Mosby’s men. Their commander, General Averell, ordered a court martial and hung the man, leaving his body to dangle at the side of the road. A while later, Pvt. White realized he had forgotten his saber and rode back, only to be captured by Mosby’s men and also sentenced to hang. Some of McNeill’s men were able to convince Mosby that White had nothing to do with the minister’s hanging, leaving White to be transferred eventually to Andersonville and to survive the war.\n\nThe Carson Valley Expedition of 1860 by Barry Taylor (pp. 4-6)\n\nIt began with a conflict between the Paiute Indians who were looking for some kidnapped girls and the inhabitants of a Pony Express station northeast of Virginia City. One man got away, and there was a demand for retribution from the residents there. A small informal detachment of miners, rogues, and militia eventually found the Paiutes, which killed the leader, Major William M. Ormsby and several others at the Battle of Pyramid Lake. A few stragglers made it back to Virginia City, and when the word reached California about the incident, General N.S. Clark, Commander of the Department of the Pacific, organized what became known as the Carson Valley Expedition. Eventually catching up with the Paiutes at Pinnacle Mount, the expedition was able to defeat them.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 7)\n\nChristopher M. Calkins’ monograph Thirty-six Hours Before Appomattox covers the lesser-known fighting at places like Sayler’s Creek, High Bridge, Farmville, and Cumberland Church, providing a wealth of information about these battles to include personal anecdotes, maps, photographs, bibliographic references, and other accumulated evidence.\n\nAmerican Eagles of the Great War by Charles G. Worman (pp. 8-11)\n\nThe article discusses the achievements of four Medal of Honor recipients, all of them aviators from World War I, including images of the men in France. Lt. Frank Luke was a leading American ace with a confirmed 18 victories (14 balloons, 4 aircraft) when he went missing near Verdun. His grave was located after the Armistice, with French locals telling the story of how Luke was killed while firing into a group of Germans who had surrounded his landed aircraft. Eddie Rickenbacker had been a race car driver, and had been assigned to the U.S. flying school at Issoudun due to his knowledge of gasoline powered engines. He learned to fly and by the end of the war, he had earned the most victories, with a total of 26 confirmed. Lt. Rickenbacker earned his Medal of Honor for attacking seven German aircraft on his own, downing two of them in September 1918. The last two recipients, Lt. Harold Geottler and Lt. Erwin Bleckley, were killed together as they searched for the “Lost Battalion” in the Argonne. They were charged with dropping supplies to the men on the ground, which were hard to spot visually. Geottler was flying the aircraft, while Bleckley had the role (as indicated by the half wing insignia on his uniform) of making observations. Geottler was shot by anti-aircraft fire and the plane dove and crashed, throwing Bleckley from the craft to die later from internal injury.\n\nThe Governor’s Guard: 2d New York Mounted Rifles by Robert A. Braun (pp. 12-15)\n\nThe article follows the newly formed unit as it gathered in early 1864 and prepared for war as a mounted rifle unit. Although without horses for their first seven months in the field, the Guard was on duty during the Battle of the Crater at Petersburg and took part in the expedition to destroy the Weldon Railroad. They were given mounts in November 1864 and fought until they ran out of ammunition during the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House. The last man from the unit killed in action fell at Clover Hill, less than two hours before the nearby cease-fire at Appomattox Court House.\n\nU.S. Army Uniforms of the Civil War, Part I: The Frock Coat by Michael J. McAfee (pp. 16-21)\n\nDescriptions of how the frock coat was worn by Federal soldiers of the Civil War are given, accompanied by seventeen different carte de visite images that illustrate each point made in the article. Examples of many variations, especially with those soldiers who were musicians, show how the frock was worn. The reader can see how buttons and double- or single-breasted frocks denoted rank, as well as how a brevet rank can be distinguished.\n\nThe Lytle Greys by Robert Kochan (pp. 22-24)\n\nLarge images of these Civil War veterans from Cincinnati, Ohio allow the reader to see how they began as Company B of the Cincinnati Zouaves Independent Militia in 1868. When the other four companies disbanded in 1872, they were renamed “The Lytle Greys” in honor of Cincinnati native General William Lytle who fell at Chickamauga in 1863. They saw active service in the Nelsonville Coal Riot of 1874. Known as a particularly successful competition until 1877 when military law was changed in Ohio, they then were integrated into Company B, First Infantry Regiment of the Ohio National Guard. The article provides detail on their uniforms, which changed three times between 1868 and 1877.\n\nWhat’s In an Ambrotype? Part I: Using the ambro as a negative by Edward Steers, Jr. (p. 25)\n\nPart I of this article discusses the way new technology can utilize the unique qualities of the original ambrotype. These were one-of-a-kind images produced on glass, usually as a negative, and then coated or backed to create a positive or “corrected” image. These old images can be teamed with an enlarger to provide detailed prints due to their incredibly clear nature. The sixth-plate image provided by the article has gone through this process, and a detailed image, enlarged more than 60 times the original, reveals the seal of the state of Vermont on one of the buttons.\n\nWhat’s In an Ambrotype? Part II: Hidden Messages by Jack E. Moore (pp. 26-27)\n\nPart II of this investigation of the ambrotype considers what might be found not in the image, but behind the image. Taking two ambrotypes out of their protective cases in order to clean the protective glass, the author of this part found what appears to be hidden messages. Two were found behind the ninth-plate ambrotype taken of Oliver Hazard Perry, Jr. in approximately 1863. Quite cryptic and in one instance very small, the meaning of these little pieces of paper remains a mystery. The other ambrotype yielded a different kind of mystery. The artist found a paper “heart-in-hand” cut out behind a sixth-plate ambrotype of a Maryland trooper, measuring about 2-1/2” in length. With a paper heart woven into the wrist area of the hand, the silhouetted hand held the message “friendship, love, and truth I give to you my heart and hand.” The signature had been scratched out, making it unclear if the ambrotype had been a gift to a young lady, or if the paper cutting had been a gift to the young soldier.\n\nStragglers (pp. 28-31)\n\nA variety of images complete this issue of Military Images, from a 1936 U.S. Army vessel (a minelayer) in the Philippines, to a vignette on a carte de visite showing Federal soldiers preparing their mess. Two unique cartes de visite stand out as well. One is of Edwin H. Stoughton as a colonel of the 4th Vermont Infantry, well before his infamous capture from his bedroom in Fairfax Court House with the rank of brigadier by John Mosby in March 1863. The other is of Major Harvey B. VanVohis of the 18th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment, with whiskers that rival those of General Ambrose Burnside, who was featured on page 16. An additional pair of images were of note, with one of an ambrotype in need of restoration to reverse peeling and the other consisting of a black-and-white photograph on oiled paper backed with a colored drawing of the subject, “giving it the effect of a color photograph.” An appeal for information about both of these last images was made.\n\nBack Image\n\nA cabinet photograph of Private Harry J. Martin of the Nevada Volunteers taken at Camp Clark in Carson City, 1898.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. 1, No. 6\n\n(32 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover Image\n\nA half-plate tintype of Pvt.

The image was taken by John Winders in November 1862.\n\nEditor’s Page (inside front cover)\n\nThe editor of Military Images assesses the first year of publication. The cost of publication and its impact on limiting the length of the magazine are addressed, as are more positive aspects of the first volume.\n\nMail Call (pp. 2-3)\n\nLetters from readers include ideas for future issues and several questions or corrections about identifications of soldiers, uniforms, or equipment from recent articles.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 3)\n\nTwo publications are given review in this issue. The first is Four Brothers in Blue by Robert Goldthwaite Carter, a republication that features the Civil War era letters set within a chronological narrative by the author. Second is New England’s Civil War Veterans by Jay S. Hoar, who provides a wealth of information regarding the identities of the last survivors of the war from New England.\n\nJunius Peak: Texas Confederate by Robert W. Stephens (pp. 4-5)\n\nComplete with an image of the subject, the article describes the military and law enforcement accomplishments of Junius “June” Peak of Texas. He was a runaway to the Civil War, eventually becoming a Confederate cavalryman. After the war, he returned to Texas and became a deputy sheriff, city marshall for Dallas, a member of the Texas Rangers taking on both outlaws and “marauding Indians” in West Texas.\n\n9 July 1864: The 14th New Jersey Infantry at the Battle of the Monocacy by Joseph Bilby (pp. 6-15)\n\nThis article is the second part of a series on two New Jersey regiments that saw extensive action in the Civil War. The author describes the details of the Battle of the Monocacy which took place in Maryland between the Confederate forces of Lieutenant General Jubal Early and the Federal forces of Major General Lew Wallace outside of Frederick, Maryland. A collection of ten different images of soldiers from the 14th New Jersey Infantry accompany the article. While the Battle of the Monocacy was a Confederate victory, it delayed the Confederate troops so they were unable to advance into Washington, D.C. as planned. The author also provides an “Epilogue” where he tells the post-war stories of several men who had impact in the battle.\n\nNaval Uniforms of the Civil War, Part IV: Enlisted men of the U.S. Navy by John Stacey (pp. 16-21)\n\nAccompanied by 11 images from the era, including one carte de visite of a very little boy who might be a powder monkey, this article discusses the uniform regulations that were in effect before, during, and after the Civil War. The author describes several examples of how naval servicemen of various enlisted ranks were able to personalize their uniforms and explains how difficult it was for them to standardize their uniforms during the war. The article also includes a picture of stamped embroidery insignia patterns that would have been finished with embroidery by the individual sailors, as well as three finished examples, showing the degree of skill many of these sailors possessed.\n\n“In Camp and Field”: Civil War Outdoor Views from the Collection of Robert J. McDonald (pp. 22-28)\n\nThe pictorial article includes several different types of outdoor images. Many of the items include encampments, formal and informal groups, individual soldiers, soldiers on their mounts, and others. The images give the reader a better glimpse of the daily life of a Civil War soldier by providing an outdoor context.\n\nStragglers (pp. 29-31)\n\nThe regular MI feature includes a wide variety of images, from a 1850-era daguerreotype of two California caballeros with rare arms to a photograph of a barbershop set-up with the Light Battery M, 7th Artillery taken in Puerto Rico in 1899 after the Spanish-American War. One of the more unusual images is a carte de visite of what is possibly a French Caribbean constabulary submitted by a reader from France. Also included is an albumen image of the U.S.S. Little Rebel with a brief history of how this Confederate gunship became part of the Federal naval arsenal.\n\nBack Cover\n\nTwo images grace the back of the issue. The image on the left was discovered in the effects of a deceased relative and may have some connection to the Wray family of Brunswick County, Virginia. The larger image on the right is a carte de visite image of Private Washington Watson, who was 61 upon his enlistment with the 148th Pennsylvania although he stated that he was 43 years of age. A skilled lumberjack, he was discharged with a disability designation of “old age” from the Pioneer Detachment of the II Corps of the Army of the Potomac in 1865.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. 1, No. 5\n\n(28 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover Image\n\nIndian scout Al-Che-Say, chief of the White Mountain Apache tribe, is one of several Native Americans featured in this 1890 photograph.

Rather than being a publication dedicated to the images of the Civil War, he notes the other topics covered in past issues, and requests a variety of articles from the readers.\n\nMail Call (p. 2)\n\nFurther investigation shows that the identity of the “Mystery Zouave” discussed in the previous issue is still a mystery, and the clarification between the American private and the Imperial Russian NCO in the Boxer Rebellion cabinet photographs from the previous issue is made. A correction is also made regarding the type of firearm identified in an image as well.\n\n“Jack” of the 102d P.V. (p. 3)\n\nBeginning as a scrappy firehouse mascot, a bull dog named “Jack” followed when most of the members of the Niagara Fire Company enlisted in the 102nd Pennsylvania Infantry in August 1861. The excerpted article tells the story of “Jack” and his service, accompanied by two cartes de visite of the loyal mascot dog.\n\nOtto Scheu, R.A.: Adventures in the Regular Army at the turn of the century by Joseph Bilby (pp. 4-10)\n\nA German immigrant arriving in the U.S. in 1887, Otto Scheu was one of the many soldiers of the Regular Army, serving in various infantry and then engineering units until his retirement 1912. The article, with images, outlines several different timeframes in Scheu’s service, from the frontier army to fighting in the siege of Santiago in the Spanish-American War to the fighting against Aguinaldo in the Philippines. The unique aspects of Scheu’s military career were the fact that his image was featured in a photograph taken of wounded soldiers in Cuba published in Collier’s Magazine in July 1898, and that his experiences as a prisoner-of-war in the Philippines (including being saved by Aguinaldo himself) were featured in the New York Journal Advertiser in December 1899.\n\nThe 20th N.Y. State Militia: A regimental history of “The Ulster Guard” by Seward R. Osborne, Jr. (pp. 11-13)\n\nBeginning with a short history of the unit prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, the article traces the history of the “Ulster Guard” from its initial three-month service in 1861 to its first action at the Second Manassas to defending against Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg to raising its national colors over Petersburg. The article includes three cartes de visite of the unit’s Civil War commanders, as well as a group image of the officers of the 20th N.Y.S.M. in September 1863. A poignant image of Hugh Donohue and Reuben Van Leuven from Company D shows the two friends and neighbors sitting together; the former was wounded at Second Manassas, while the latter was killed at Gettysburg.\n\n“Mustering In”: An ambrotype in the collection of William Gladstone (pp. 14-16)\n\nThis pictorial features a half-plate ambrotype of what appears to be a mustering ceremony taken in the backyard area of a city or town. Turning the focus onto different parts of the photograph, the reader gets a deeper sense of the activity that the ambrotype captured. Surrounding a water pump and trough, the fife and drummer boy appear to be playing while a man nearby speaks, holding out his hat for emphasis. A woman on the balcony of a neighboring house watches the activity, providing us a glimpse into a part of her house, while an important looking man on a chair in the yard holds onto a dog. The ambrotype allows MI readers a glimpse into an unusual event taking place in an everyday setting.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 17)\n\nTwo different publications are reviewed in this issue. The first review covers both volumes I and II of World War One Collectors Handbook, by Dennis Gordon, Hayes Otoupalik, and Paul J. Schulz, which is a very helpful guide for those interested in collecting or the history of World War I artifacts and memoribilia. The second review is of A Pictorial History of the Battle of Gettysburg which is unauthored and appears to be geared towards the tourist rather than the scholar.\n\nNaval Uniforms of the Civil War, Part III: Confederate Images from the collection of John Bracken (pp. 18-21)\n\nThe Director of the Virginia Confederate Museum shared 17 carte de visite images of Confederate naval officers. With all but one subject identified, the collection ranges from Rear Admiral Raphael Semmes to several captains of blockade runners. Brief background information on each subject’s naval service is provided and unique aspects of their uniforms are indicated.\n\nIndian Scouts of the U.S. Army by Jacques Noel Jacobsen, Jr. (pp. 22-24)\n\nAccompanied by images of different Indian Scout units, the article discusses the history of the Indian Scout in the service of the U.S. Army, delineating between before and after 1866, when scouts were enlisted into the Army as were other members of the Regular Army. The article discusses in brief some of the more notable actions of the Scouts, including the Crow scouts working with Custer, the last campaign against Geronimo, the scouts with Pershing chasing Pancho Villa in Mexico, and the Navajo in the Pacific during World War II.\n\nStragglers (pp. 25-27)\n\nThree trios of images submitted by readers are featured. The three examples of rare weapons includes a carte de visite of Capt. John McDonald Laughlin of the 104th Pennsylvania holding a model of a siege gun in his lap, possibly after the siege of Charleston in which his unit participated. The second trio highlights a group of cavalrymen, including a Canadian volunteer cavalry soldier from about 1866. The third trio is of “Three Rebs” including one serious Georgian wielding an 18” Bowie knife in the sixth-plate ambrotype.\n\nBack Cover\n\nThe image is a sixth-plate ambrotype of Illinois infantryman Private George W. Walker from Company H of the 13th Illinois Volunteer Infantry.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. 1, No. 4\n\n(28 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover Image\n\nThis issue of Military Images features a confident Trooper Charles E. M. Gilmore of the 4th U. S. Cavalry in a cabinet photograph taken in approximately 1905.\n\nEditor’s Page (inside front cover)\n\nThe editor responds to frequent observations made by readers regarding what appears to be “backwards” images published in prior issues. Due to the processing technology of the time, these “hard” images were very similar to a mirror image, as there was no use of a negative image that was familiar in later eras. While some subjects would reverse their cartridge boxes or sabers for the purpose of an image, the ambrotype, daguerreotype, or tintype would still have certain uniform features shown in reverse, such as buttons, belts, or insignia.\n\nMail Call (p. 2)\n\nA reader appears to have identified the Zouave featured on the cover of the second issue of Military Images as Cpl. John A. Anderson of the 155th Pennsylvania Zouaves.\n\nPatriotic Picture Frames of the Great War by Dale Biever (pp. 3-5)\n\nThe article features several examples of how images were displayed during the First World War. In a collection of nine images, the author provided a wide variety of both manufactured and homemade frames. Many of the manufactured frames could be easily changed to represent a particular branch of the service, and foreshadowed symbols more associated with the Second World War. Some of the handcrafted frames include a small life preserver and a frame made from the tip of an aircraft propeller.\n\nLt. Wilson’s Scrapbook by Dennis Gordon (pp. 6-11)\n\nThis article comes from a forthcoming book by the author, and uses the images taken by Lt. John E. Wilson, chaplain to the 167th and 168th Transportation Companies. Both companies saw service at the end of the First World War, which involved fighting in the Russian Civil War with the White Army and other Allied nations against the Bolshevik Red Army on the North Russian Front. Almost 800 men were assigned to these units and were responsible for maintaining and operating railroad lines in the area outside of Murmansk from April to July 1919. The photographs taken by Lt. Wilson document some of this little-known episode in American military history.\n\nThe Search for Private Beetem (pp. 12-13)\n\nThe article outlines the search for the identity of one soldier whose image was found in two different items up for sale at a flea market in Pennsylvania in 1979. By connecting a clue from each image, the carte de visite and the 4×5” albumen photograph were able to bring to life for MI readers the story of Private John W. Beetem, who served in Company L of the 13th Pennsylvania Cavalry from August 1862 to July 1865.\n\nBob Kelchner’s 7th Cavalry Album (pp. 14-20)\n\nThis article focuses on thirteen portraits taken from a photograph album that contained images from Troop E of the U.S. 7th Cavalry dating from 1895 to 1912. While most of the subjects are unnamed, the album allows a very interesting view of the uniforms worn by the troops during that time, which included service in the Spanish-American War and the occupation of Cuba. The article poses many possibilities for why the men wear a mix of old and new uniform components. Some of the troopers also wore uniforms that were not regulation, such as the trooper wearing a knit turtleneck sweater underneath his uniform or the soldier who modified the collar of his regulation fatigue coat to that of his own liking.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 21)\n\nThe article reviews the newly revised A Photographic Supplement of Confederate Swords with Addendum by William. A. Albaugh, III.\n\nNaval Uniforms of the Civil War, Part II: U.S. Naval Engineers by John Stacey (pp. 22-24)\n\nThe author of this article, the second in a series highlighting the uniforms of the Federal navy, focuses on changes in uniform regulations as shown by four cartes de visite highlighted in the article. The author also provides a great deal of information on the background of the uniform regulations for naval engineers prior to the Civil War.\n\nStragglers (pp. 25-27)\n\nThere is a wide variety of images in this issue, some of which have a few surprises involved. One carte de visite image appeared to be a British sailor but with some research, turned out to be probably from a theatrical production. Another fascinating image submitted by a reader was a cabinet photograph taken in Tientsin, China, during the Boxer Rebellion, depicting an American private and an Imperial Russian NCO sitting in a painted prop automobile. Even more fascinating was the fact that another image of the two was submitted by a different contributor, with the same two soldiers wearing switched uniforms.\n\nBack Image\n\nThe image shows a soldier most likely from a Pennsylvania Zouave regiment, but wearing a wonderful striped turban with tassel, holding an unusual firearm."
