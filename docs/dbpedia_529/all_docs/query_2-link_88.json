The following is from The Kingston Daily Freeman, Wednesday, May 7, 1884. “The Division Encampment of the Sons of Veterans of the United States, Department of New York, held in the City Hall, called together a fine looking body of young men dressed in neat blue uniforms and had the day been a pleasant one we think they would have generally enjoyed their visit to this city as not much more could have been done by Tappen Camp No. 1 of this city and also by our citizens generally for their proper entertainment. The City Hall furnished them a fine place in which to meet and the young men by their gentlemanly and martial bearing proved they were worthy of what was done for their pleasure. The business meeting was called to order in one of the lower rooms of the hall about 10 o’clock. Col. James E. Purdy was the chairman. The report of the committee on credentials showed that various camps were represented as follows: Tappen Camp No. 1 by alternate representative William R.

Tobias; Ellsworth Camp No. 10 by regular representative William L. Walsh; Kilpatrick Camp No. 11 by alternate representative S.M. Bowers and past captain H.M. Hapgood; Lymerson Camp No. 14 by regular representative S.A. Waterman; Veteran Camp No. 5 by regular representative G. A. Bender and past captain S.A. Waterman; Phil Kearney Camp No. 19 by regular representative George Sefts; Poney Farnum Camp, No. 17 by alternate M.J. Downing; A.H. VanDegraft Camp No. 18 by Post Captain I.B.

In the large room a fine collation had been prepared by the lady friends of Tappen Camp and Pratt Post GAR for the boys and those whom they wished to entertain, after serving the report. When the collation had received the attention it deserved, Lt. O’Reilly of Tappen Camp and son of alderman O’Reilly of the city made a welcoming speech to the division encampment to which Post Col. James E. Purdy responded. Col R.W. Anderson, the Commander of Pratt Post and organizer of the first camp of Sons of Veterans in the State of New York, then spoke of that which had led to the organization of the Sons of Veterans and gave much information for their instruction and guidance.

Baldwin. At the steamer’s dock there were numerous cheers given and received by both parties and its hoped the representatives were pleased with their visit to our city.\n\nIn the evening Tappen Camp gave a campfire which was attended by the fife and drum corps and many members of the Pratt Post besides a large number of friends of the Sons of Veterans.
