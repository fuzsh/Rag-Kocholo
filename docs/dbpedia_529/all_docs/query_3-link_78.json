It refuses to wake up and acknowledge that the peace and civilization on which its dreams rest will be at grave risk if the U.S. and its allies don't act. That means you in the military have not yet received your due applause. But it doesn't make your task any less vital, or your commitment to it any less heroic. The world will applaud, in time--and the sound will echo down the corridors of history.\n\nPosted by: elly on March 10, 2003 07:05 PM\n\nGod Bless You, God's Speed and go KICK SOME *!!!

Every day, in almost every media, the right to say what you want to say is being tested. We don't have to agree with everything we hear, but we do have the right to say what we want. Our job as Americans is to live according to our own personal ideals while recognizing the rights of other Americans. Let every American make up their own mind in regard to the politics and policies of this nations citizens. The majority of us here in the US support our troops and pray to have our sons,daughters, grandchildren, husbands and wives and aunts and uncles come home safe and sound from the job they have chosen to do.\n\nThank you all from the bottom of this grandmas heart.\n\nPosted by: grandma mimi on March 10, 2003 07:36 PM\n\nEvery day I thank my lucky stars you guys are out there doing the heavy lifting for all of us.

To which I would reply: to suggest that the just war tradition is obsolete is to suggest that politics--the organization of human life into purposeful political communities--is obsolete. To reduce the just war tradition to an algebraic casuistry is to deny the tradition its capacity to shed light on the irreducible moral component of all political action. What we must do, in this generation, is to retrieve and develop the just war tradition to take account of the new political and technological realities of the twenty-first century. September 11, what has followed, and what lies ahead, have demonstrated just how urgent that task is.\"\n\nThere will always be \"anti-war\" protestors that honestly believe that there is no such thing as a \"just war.\" I disagree.

Time I should be asleep, well past the time I used to. The only problem is that for a little over a year now, it's the time things get quiet. Quiet enough that you hear things you never used to. Or things that didn't used to matter much. You hear a jet on patrol, and you can tell by the sound of it that it's coming down the Hudson real fast. Must be on patrol, hope to God it's on patrol. You think to yourself unspeakably, I hope it's not what I remember hearing on 'that' morning walking to work. And you feal grateful it's not sirens ... can't bear those. And it's not the silence I'll face in the morning ... sitting on a subway car stopped in between stations. Everyone around me waiting to hear what's up. Looking at the faces around you, wondering. Wondering the same damn thing everyone else is. The silence that you don't even dare break with a joke.\n\nWhy do I write this? I write it to let you know that there's a ton of folks in this town who live, and work, and try to sleep at night ... not on the front lines, not really facing anything ... but who think of you often. Who pray you'll be delivered success in you are there to do. Who pray they can forget that day this city changed in a way you couldn't begin to imagine (or I couldn't ... except I do). And who hope against hope, it won't change again.\n\nI write to let you know, that while I pray that I will forget that day (and know I will) ... I pray even more that I will never forget what you are there doing for us. I write to thank you for peace of mind your sacrifice brings. I write to let you how grateful one man is for what you are doing. To thank you for doing what needs to be done. To thank you for doing it not for yourselves, not for the glory, not for the dumb reasons you hear folks spouting off about. I thank you for doing it because it needs to be done.\n\nI thank you simply. I thank you deeply. And I go to sleep knowing who makes that possible.\n\nPosted by: naughjo on March 11, 2003 12:50 AM\n\nI don't think you're making a sacrifice. A sacrifice means to take a lesser value over a greater value; you're choosing to fight for freedom rather than live as a slave (and that isn't a sacrifice) - that's called rational self-interest, and I applaud you all for it. Show no mercy on the enemy, win the war, ensure America's security, liberate Iraq, and come home safely. Oh, and when the time comes, enjoy the celebrations (both in Iraq and at home); you'll have earned them.\n\nPosted by: Jonathan on March 11, 2003 01:01 AM\n\nTHANK YOU so much for what you are doing.

He was upset (rightfully so) at having to leave mid-term. He was nervous and scared (again rightfully so). But he packed up his bag and went, because that is his job.\n\nI didn't tell him I was sorry, because he wasn't doing anything wrong.\n\nI didn't tell him his situation sucked, because it was important for him to believe he was going off to do something good.\n\nSo I said, \"Congratulations!\"\n\nI reminded him that he is well trained and ready to take on the dangers. I reminded him that he is lucky to be serving under an administration that understands the needs of its enlisted troops. I reminded him that we will clean house in Iraq quickly and (from our end) pretty painlessly. I reminded him that while he may be losing a semester of college, he will be gaining some incredible veteran's benefits as a combatant in a foreign war. He can look forward to medals, promotions, pay raises, and special VA benefits when he returns. I reminded him that his time on active-duty counts towards his time-in-service requirements for the Illinois Veterans' Grant, meaning his one-semester sacrifice will help him finish school for free when he returns.\n\nAnd then I said \"Good luck and keep your powder dry.\"\n\nI know full well that going to war sucks. I joined the military to go to the first Gulf war and spent 6 years in uniform. But I also know that what our boys and girls need to hear right now is not sympathy and grief, but encouragement and enthusiasm.

Force should be resorted to when the absence of force does not affect an imperative national objective and should always be used when less force guards against the use of more force at a later time. A lesser force used against Hitler in 1937 would have prevented the need for a greater force used against him beginning in 1941.

We can take out a madman who kills his own people directly or leaves them to starve, and will only get worse. Liberating Iraq is long overdue. It should have been done four years ago when Sodom threw out the inspectors. I am embarrassed by the moral and mental bankruptcy of France, Germany, Russia and China. The UN refuses to rise from the disgusting lows of corruption, self-interest, and the contempt that they have for real freedoms. To allow France and Russia to protect Saddam after being paid off by lucrative oil contracts from him is a grave injustice to the freedom-loving world. The UN that allows terrorist regimes like Syria to vote on the security council makes itself illegitimate and therefore irrelevant. The UN does not give us legitimacy, but the other way around.

Ingemi on March 12, 2003 01:32 PM\n\nI know that just as some people Stateside have doubts about the morality of your cause, some of you in the armed forces may also have doubts, perhaps because of the debate back home.\n\nIf you doubt for a moment that the cause is just, or wonder why many in the world are expressing such doubts, here's an excerpt from a recent article which sheds light on the insincerity of the appeasers and the blindness of our foreign critics ...\n\n--\n\nJust after the celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birthday, it is appropriate to remember his lament: \"The world has never had a good definition of the word 'liberty.'\" With Hussein flouting international law, and President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair attempting to enforce it, portrayals of Bush as Adolf Hitler  as we saw and heard in the \"human-rights\" protests  betray an ignorance of liberty, an ignorance of right and wrong, an ignorance of common sense. Because Bush and Blair are putting together a coalition of countries to oust Hussein, they are labeled the warmongers and tyrants. We live in a confusing time indeed.\n\nLincoln described liberty by a useful analogy: \"The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as a liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty.\" Lincoln made it clear who the sheep was and who the wolf was. It is equally important to recognize who the liberator is. Those who march against the U.S. and the U.K. today, those who condemn Bush and Blair and remain silent when it comes to Hussein, are in league with the wolf's view that the shepherds are destroying liberty. The people of Iraq will soon know what Afghanis know. The true wolf was devouring Afghanis, the true shepherd saved them.\n\n--\n\nThe full article is here:\n\nhttp://nationalreview.com/comment/comment-bennett031103.asp\n\nIf you'd like to read more about the phony hand-wringing of the appeasement movement, here's a spirited column denouncing the 'Crocodile Tears' being shed in Paris, the U.N., and elsewhere ...\n\nhttp://www.nypost.com/seven/03102003/postopinion/opedcolumnists/70280.htm\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n--\n\nWe must accept, from today onward, that America shall often need to act alone or with a handful of courageous allies. Increasingly, we will need to do that which we recognize as strategically and morally necessary, disregarding those states, in Europe and elsewhere, that weep so readily for the dead while caring so little for the living.\n\nWe must accept the world's jealousy as a given and must not become distracted by attempts to placate European racists who refuse to set high standards for governance in developing states. Indeed, nothing so abets tyranny and oppression today as French and German condescension toward black, brown or yellow populations - and their unspoken conviction that nonwhites remain inferior.\n\n...\n\nWe Americans can expect neither gratitude, understanding nor support from the baroque regimes of France, Germany and their fellow travelers. Chancellor Schroeder? Bill Clinton without the moral fiber. President Chirac? The mouth of de Gaulle, the soul of Petain, and the morals of a pimp. Humanitarian Belgium? Yeah, just ask the Congolese. The European anti-war movement? Necrophiliacs licking the corpse of Josef Stalin.\n\nEuropeans will always be willing to weep over the dead. The United States must take a stand for the living. In Iraq. And beyond.\n\n--\n\nI offer all of my support to all of you. Perhaps the bravest among you be those who have doubts and reservations about the war, but will nonetheless muster the courage to prosecute it. I believe your bravery and courage will inspire all of us to be more resolute in our determination and more convinced in the morality of our values, and for that most of all, we are already greatly in your debt.\n\nPosted by: Keith on March 12, 2003 02:36 PM\n\nI know someoone post this paragraph but here it is again.\n\n\"It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat.\"\n\n- THEODORE ROOSEVELT (Paris Sorbonne,1910)\n\nI have nothing in my heart but love, and nothing in my mind but prayers for your strength, safety, and success, for every single one of you.

Her body was so badly burned all that could be done was to scoop some ashes out of the southwest wall and present them to her family.\n\nI am filled not with rage, but resolve. And my spirits are lifted knowing the magnificent courage, commitment and talent of our fighting men and women. You will show the Euro-appeasers, faux-moralists and worst of all, the aspiring Sadaamites the futility of their cause.
