        "text": "Why Play Division III Athletics?\n\nIf you’re a high school athlete, you may be thinking about how to continue your athletic career at the collegiate level. One option that you may want to consider is playing Division III, which makes up the largest subdivision in NCAA with 450 programs across the country. Division III athletic programs, such as Marywood University, provide a balance of academic and athletic opportunities, allowing students to excel in both areas. Being a Marywood University Pacer affords you the opportunity to experience your academic and athletic pursuits, the purest example of what it means to be a student-athlete.\n\nAttending a Division III school is a great option for those who desire a close community with high potential to build connections that last beyond the college years. In all of Marywood’s 22 varsity sports, there is a family-like connection that student-athletes have with their teammates and coaches, not to mention with their professors in the classroom as well. Lifelong relationships are created from the large amount of quality time the players spend with each other on campus and in the athletics program. Furthermore, coaches can spend more individual time with the athletes because the team sizes are smaller. This is beneficial for player development, since students have easy access to communicate with their coach about performance feedback. Again, the same support applies to the classroom with Marywood’s 11:1 student-faculty ratio.\n\nIt has been said many times that only part of a college education stems from the classroom experience. Another truly valuable, vital component of a student’s education comes from out-of-classroom experiences like athletics and other student life activities. Since learning comes in all forms students should investigate all aspects of their college experience.\n\nDivision III athletics are an integral part of our educational system at Marywood University, and the benefits of playing and learning at the college level should be considered by all student-athletes who want to pursue a quality education while competing in the sport that they enjoy. Take time to investigate all options and make an educated decision on what best fits you, your dreams, and your goals.\n\nVisit NCAA.org for more information about Division III athletics. | Learn More About Marywood University Athletics »\n\nMarywood University also has a co-ed competitive esports program for student-athletes to sharpen their skills and further expand their college experience."
