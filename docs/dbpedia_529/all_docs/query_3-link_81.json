        "text": "Military Service in the 19thÂ Century\n\nFor much of the early history of the United States, where the first generation of Latter-day Saints gathered, military and paramilitary units were organized geographically. Latter-day Saint communities in Missouri, Illinois, and Utah mustered militia units that were often composed of Church members, with local Church leaders serving as commanders.1 Occasionally, militia units composed of Latter-day Saint volunteers served as part of the Regular Army of the United States.2 Several Latter-day Saint units, such as the well-known Mormon Battalion, fought for the United States in the Mexican-American War (1846â48), the American Civil War (1861â65), the Spanish-American War (1898), and World WarÂ I (1914â18).3\n\nDuring the Spanish-American War, EliasÂ S. Kimball, the first commissioned Latter-day Saint chaplain in the United States military, struggled to balance the religious neutrality of his commission with the specific needs of Latter-day Saint soldiers assigned to his regiment. Unable to hold regular worship services and prevented from offering counsel specific to Latter-day Saint beliefs and doctrine, Kimball often felt frustrated, an experience future Latter-day Saint chaplains would share.4 Church leaders devised certain accommodations for Latter-day Saint soldiers in other military units. They encouraged wards and branches with members serving in the military to send scriptures, Church literature, and regular correspondence to their soldiers. They urged members of wards and branches near military encampments to invite soldiers to join in local services and to fellowship them where needed. Permission was sometimes granted to soldiers in active combat or other remote locations to organize their own Mutual Improvement Association (MIA) groups, the first of which was organized in 1898 near Manila, Philippines, during the Battle of Manila.5 Under the auspices of this âMutual Improvement Association of the Far East,â Latter-day Saint servicemen met to study the scriptures, partake of the sacrament, and attend social events.6\n\nThe Two World Wars\n\nDuring World WarÂ I, numbers of Latter-day Saints served on both sides of a major international conflict for the first time in the Churchâs history.7 Regular correspondence from home wards and branches reached soldiers serving from the Central powers of Germany and Austria and the Allied nations of Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. Sometimes, as with the 13thÂ Mounted Rifles (the so-called âAlberta Regimentâ) of the Canadian Army, a number of Latter-day Saints held regular Church meetings. Lieutenant Hugh B. Brown, a future General Authority, led efforts to provide spiritual support to Latter-day Saints in his regiment.8\n\nThe entry of the United States Armed Forces into the war in 1917 impelled Church leaders to develop new programs to support Latter-day Saint servicemembers. Three Latter-day Saints received commissions as chaplains in the United States Army, and servicemembers across the world were encouraged to seek local congregations wherever stationed. MIA groups were organized near training bases or combat arenas where servicemembers were prevented from attending regular wards and branches.9\n\nAs the Second World War broke out in the 1930s, Church leaders had learned from World WarÂ I and were prepared to develop a more thorough support network for servicemembers. In 1940 and 1941, as the number of Latter-day Saints engaged in the conflict began to climb, leaders created new distribution channels for sending Church literature and correspondence to servicemembers abroad. MIA groups provided the main nucleus of Latter-day Saint camaraderie in the field. The Military Servicemenâs Committeeâorganized in 1941, with Elder HaroldÂ B. Lee of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as chair and HughÂ B. Brown as coordinatorâdevised a servicemember support plan that included a formal process for calling and setting apart MIA group leaders.10 The committee also published the Handbook for Chaplains and Group Leaders and pocket editions of the scriptures and other Church literature for servicemembers. A directory, updated annually, provided servicemembers with contact information of local branches, wards, and missions wherever they were stationed. Local Church members served as assistant coordinators to connect nearby military posts with local congregations.11\n\nWhile the number of Latter-day Saint chaplains increased during World WarÂ II, the Military Servicemenâs Committee preferred calling enlisted men as group leaders. The arrangement allowed for more overtly Latter-day Saint worship meetings to convene without running against military policies requiring nondenominational services. Young men set apart as group leaders before leaving home could organize groups and hold meetings wherever they were stationed, including while in combat.12 MIA groups were organized in every theater of the war, including some prisoner of war camps, and many of the servicemembers who attended took every opportunity to share the gospel with fellow soldiers and local people with whom they interacted. Many servicemembers, like L.Â Tom Perry, a United States Marine and future Apostle, collaborated with military companions, other churches, and branch members to rebuild areas devastated by the war.13"
