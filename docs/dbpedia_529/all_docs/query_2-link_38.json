        "text": "DMAVA is in the people business. I recently marked 100 days since I assumed the duties and responsibilities of Deputy Commissioner of Veterans Affairs (DCVA). I wish to extend a tremendous thank you to the individuals who have taken the time to meet with me and share their feedback on how we can sustain and improve the programs and services that we provide to Garden State Veterans and their families. These actions should be guided by The Adjutant Generalâs priorities of people, readiness, modernization, and organizational development and reform.\n\nThat first priority means acknowledging the efforts of the state and federal personnel who work daily to support our communities. Our success or failure is measured by our collective ability to deliver programs and services to the populations that we serve. I joined our organization in a uniform in 2010 and as a civilian employee in 2018. My new role as DCVA reinforces my deeply held conviction that our team comes to work each day committed to serving those who served and the people who love them.\n\nThis begins by ensuring that Veterans and families engage with an organization characterized by safety, openness, respect, and trust. As Deputy Commissioner, I expect that our decisions and actions will foster a climate of mutual respect regardless of an individualâs race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, sex/gender (including pregnancy), marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, familial status, religion, affectional or sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait, genetic information, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, or disability. There will be zero tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or sexual assault.\n\nWe serve New Jerseyâs heroes. The quality of our work and the pride that we take in our work should reflect that. We support one another. There will be times when we are called upon to assist in the completion of projects outside of our normal duties. I expect leaders at every level to build teams of competence, mutual trust, and shared understanding.\n\nWhether caring for a resident at a Veterans Memorial Home or helping someone secure federal benefits, our team will be helpful and courteous in our interactions with others. We will make ourselves available to provide assistance and satisfy requests from Veterans, family members, Veterans Service Organizations, and our public and private partners. The first answer to a question should not be no. Within the boundaries of state and federal regulations, and understanding that time is always a factor, our team will work to identify alternate solutions and facilitate a satisfactory outcome to every engagement.\n\nFor those we serve, placing a priority on people means taking decisive action to foster resilience and reduce suicides. This is my personal and professional objective. As Co-Chair of the Governorâs Challenge to Prevent Suicide Among Service Members, Veterans, and Their Families, my work will be guided by two principles: complementing, not recreating, the noble work already being done by our stakeholder partners (i.e., U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars) and bringing together leaders in the veterans and behavioral health spaces to identify challenges and develop courses of action to overcome them. For example, DMAVA is in the process of awarding grant funding that will promote connectedness in the Veterans Community through Mental Health First Aid Training for Veterans Service Organizations and others.\n\nWhile the above is a good start, when it comes to reducing suicide, I want us to do more. I welcome ideas and input from all.\n\nEspecially in the area of U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare services, reliable and accessible transportation continues to be one of the chief challenges for New Jersey Veterans. This is a complex problem that involves county, state, and federal government. In addition to the selfless and important work of Veterans Service Organizations, DMAVA currently provides funding to county governments to provide no cost transportation.\n\nEarlier this year, the Veterans Benefits Bureau published and disseminated a guide to serve as a point of entry for county administered transportation. In the coming months, I would like our team to assume a greater leadership role in developing solutions to this challenge. At the direction of The Adjutant General, we will convene a Veterans Transportation Working Group to identify immediate and long term courses of action to improve services and assistance to some of the most vulnerable Veterans among us.\n\nExcellence is our objective. Our actions will determine our success. This begins with clarity of purpose, pride in our work, and a deep understanding of our mission. It all starts with people. There are few better missions we can be assigned to."
