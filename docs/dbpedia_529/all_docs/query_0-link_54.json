I'm now in therapy to deal with the horror, shame, anger and grief I still harbor from the Vietnam era. I've been devouring the letters he wrote me during his short, tragic time \"in country,\" and I yearn to connect with ANYONE who served alongside Lal. He was a gentle soul--a rock'n'roll drummer from Red Wing,Minnesota. Easy-going, slender, dark hair, deep eyes, and a sweet crooked grin. He was shot in the chest (or so they said)and I never got a satisfactory account of what happened. I was too young, naive, intimidated by the military, and in shock to ask the right questions. His last letters had descriptions of some of his squad: LEE (squad leader from Kentucky) SLACKO (a Mormon from Utah) GREG (a guitar player from Iowa) UTCH (former squad leader from Pennsylvania) and AL (a soul-brother from Florida) ARE ANY OF YOU OUT THERE?
