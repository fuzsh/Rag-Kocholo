        "text": "Real Estate Law has been a core practice area at Hinman, Howard & Kattell since the firm’s founding over a century ago, and remains one of the firm’s largest departments. With offices throughout New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, and New Jersey, Hinman, Howard & Kattell is able to offer clients local convenience combined with the skills of a large firm.\n\nCommercial Real Estate and Financing\n\nOur Commercial Real Estate and Financing attorneys assist clients in every facet of the acquisition, development and disposition of real estate, including joint ventures, public-private financing, industrial development agency transactions, municipal bond closings, shopping center and commercial leases, operating and franchise agreements. We also represent a number of institutional lenders in commercial lending.\n\nWe also work with municipalities regarding zoning, planning, subdivision and permits, and we assist clients in identifying and dealing with environmental issues, and in handling restructuring, workouts and real-estate-related litigation matters.\n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nHinman, Howard & Kattell’s Residential Real Estate attorneys have many years of experience and close thousands of real estate transactions each year for buyers, sellers and mortgage lenders. We help buyers and sellers throughout the closing process, from the signing of the contract to the delivery of the deed at the closing table. We help review our clients’ contracts and mortgage commitments, negotiate inspection issues, update and examine abstracts of title, and schedule and attend the closing with our clients. The firm’s attorneys take the responsibility of assisting our clients with the purchase of a home very seriously. As lending and housing issues have gained national attention and buying a house becomes more complex, we firmly believe that working with an experienced real estate attorney is the best way to insure a smooth closing process and avoid post-closing issues.\n\nHH&K’s attorneys are agents for Fidelity National Title Insurance Corporation and Westcor Title Insurance Corporation, and can assist our clients in obtaining a mortgage title insurance policy for their lenders and an owners’ title insurance policy for themselves. We can also conduct our own title searches in-house to expedite the closing process. Title insurance premiums are regulated by New York State."
