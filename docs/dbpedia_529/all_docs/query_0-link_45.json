It looks as if the subscription through the banks of the county will be about $119,000.\n\nCertain subscriptions through banks outside the county which ought to be credited to this county will run the subscription to about $130,000.\n\nThe total allotment for the county was $112,500. I think the banks have several days yet to finish making their report. When the final reports are all in, I will give you the result.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. S. ROBERSON.\n\nChapel Hill, N.

C.\n\nEnclosed is copy of a letter I have just written Mrs. Long making a report on the work of the Woman's Committee in Orange County.\n\nYou may be interested in the reports from the various townships. So far as we have them, they are as follows:\n\nChapel Hill township - 42 men 21 women $34,100 Hillsboro township--\n\nMrs. T. Norfleet Webb, Ch. 24 men 19 women 24,000 Cheeks township--\n\nMiss Efland, Ch. -- 10 4,700 Cedar Grove township--\n\nMrs. J. P.

BERRY,\n\nCounty Chairman.\n\nChapel Hill, N. C.,\n\nMay 13, 1919.\n\nMrs. John A. Long, State Chairman,\n\nWoman's Liberty Loan Committee,\n\nKinston, N. C.\n\nMy dear Mrs. Long:\n\nI have to make the following report for the Woman's Committee for Orange County.\n\nThere was obtained by direct solicitation of the women $67,300 from 79 men and 56 women. I worked with the Chairman for men in sending out two circular letters and various literature to every tax payer in the county. Just what was the direct result of this, I am unable to say, but I believe it should add at least $10,000 to the amount obtained by the Woman's Committee, which would make $77,300. So far as we are able to get the figures from the banks at the present time, the county has subscribed a little over $131,000, which is twenty per cent over our quota of $112,500. It may be said then that the Woman's Committee obtained 5/7 of the county's quota, and 8/13 of the bonds sold in the county.\n\nTrusting this will give you the information desired, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. M. BERRY, Chairman\n\nWoman's Committee for Orange County.\n\nPage 71\n\nY. M. C. A.\n\nA Y. M. C. A. drive was held November 11-19, 1917. Orange County's quota was $200.00. The Committee for raising this money was composed of the following gentlemen: N. W. Brown, G. K. Collins, and T. M. Grant. On Sunday, November 11, at 7:30 P. M. at the Methodist Church. Mr. George E. Dey, M. A. from Camp Green, Charlotte, delivered an address in which he explained the great need of the Y. M. C. A. and outlined the work that it did.\n\nOn Sunday, November 18, at 3 P. M. a grand Y. M. C. A. Rally was held at the court house. Such a large crowd attended that even all standing room was taken and many crowded about the halls and staircases. Maj. John W. Graham presided. The meeting was opened by Scripture lesson and prayer offered by Dr. Benton, rector of St. Matthews Church, after which Rev. G. H. Allen, Army Y. M. C. A. Secretary at Camp Greene, Charlotte, made an address, telling of the Y. M. C. A. work at the training camps. At the close of this address, Hon. S. M. Gattis outlined briefly what the county was doing for the boys. He commended the local committee for the effective manner in which they were handling the campaign. After hearing the reports from various committees from schools, churches, etc., the total amounted to $1,400.00. The rest of the $2,000.00 was subsequently raised, although Orange County was credited with only $18,000.00, as through some mistake about $200.00 from the Chapel Hill community was credited to another county.\n\nOn Thursday night, September 19, 1918, a meeting was held in the court house at Hillsboro for the purpose of organizing\n\nPage 72\n\nOrange for the coming United War Work drive. The meeting was opened with the singing of the Star Spangled Banner by the Community Chorus, followed by a prayer by Rev. Mr. Oldham. The Chorus then sang the \"Song of a Thousand Years\", after which Hon. S. M. Gattis introduced the speaker of the evening, Mr. Will Erwin of Durham. Mr. Erwin delivered an address on the Y. M. C. A. and the great need to support it. At the close of the address he requested that the county be organized for work in the coming drive. The following nominating committee was appointed: Miss Henrietta P. Collins, Mr. G. K. Collins, Rev. Mr. Oldham, Mr. N. W. Brown. While the nominating committee were consulting, Mr. Warner, a Y. M. C. A. worker from Durham, gave an account of the work among the soldiers. The nominating committee then returned with the following report.\n\nFor Chairman . . . . . Mr. N. W. Brown,\n\nFor Secretary . . . . . Mr. R. H. Claytor,\n\nFor Treasurer . . . . . Mr. H. Winder Webb,\n\nFor Obtaining Speakers, etc., . . . . . Rev. H. S.

S. Roberson; Amount raised, $300.00\n\nReport of North Orange: Chairman for North Orange, Mr. R. H. Claytor. Those assisting Mr. Claytor were:\n\nMiss Ida Lloyd, Hillsboro Miss Mary Spurgeon, Hillsboro Miss Mary Jones, Hillsboro Miss Charlotte Brown, Hillsboro Mr. Owen Robertson, Hillsboro Mr. J. C. Webb. Hillsboro Miss Annie Cole, Hillsboro RFD #1. Mrs. Cain Roberts, Hillsboro RFD #1. Miss Vesta Breeze, Cedar Grove, RFD #1. Miss Alice Hughes, Cedar Grove, Mr. C. C. Compton, Hebane, RFD #3. Miss Lettie Thompson, Efland, Miss Murray, Efland, Mr. Fred McNeer, Hillsboro, Miss Nell Browning, Hillsboro,\n\nMr. J. L. Brown, Hillsboro, was treasurer of this fund. The quota for North Orange was $500.00. We raised $500.01.\n\nPage 75\n\nEPIDEMIC OF SPANISH INFLUENZA.\n\nEarly in October, 1918, Dr. D. H. Hill, State Chairman of the Council of Defense, sent letters to all County Chairmen warning them of the spread of Spanish influenza, which was threatening the whole country. In this letter he made suggestions as to what steps should be taken, etc.\n\nIn accordance with this, Mr. J. C. Webb called a meeting of the representative men to meet with the County Commissioners and plans were made for Relief Work. It was realized at this meeting that there was no County Board of Health, and so one was created, with Dr. Spoon of Hillsboro as County Health Officer, who with the following constitute the Board of Health: Dr. B. B. Lloyd; Ed N. Cates Chmn. Co. Board of Commissioners; Jeff Turner, Mayor of Hillsboro; R. H. Claytor, County Supt. of Schools.\n\nMr. T. N. Webb was appointed County Chairman of the Relief Work, with Dr. J. S. Spurgeon to represent the Hillsboro School District. The other districts were as follows:\n\nMr. Sterling Browning, representing the Eno District.\n\nMr. Carl Forrest, representing the Efland District.\n\nMr. John P. Hughes, representing the Cedar Grove District.\n\nMr. Eubanks, representing the Chapel Hill District.\n\nRev. Harvey Bradshaw was appointed to have charge of the town of Hillsboro and Mr. C. H. Robertson that of West End.\n\nOn October 7, the Board of Health ordered the closing of all churches, schools, theatres, etc., and forbade all meetings of every kind, in order to prevent, if possible, a spread of the disease which had already broken out in the community.\n\nPage 76\n\nWith the appearance of the first case, assistance was given in nursing and furnishing suitable nourishment and necessities by citizens of the town, and Dr. Spurgeon's family, Rev. Mr. Bradshaw, Miss Nellie Russell, and Mr. Chester Turner were among the first to render aid and continued to do all in their power.\n\nWhen the epidemic spread to the Eno Mill district, the officials of the mill opened a diet kitchen at the West Hill school, and financed it for about seven weeks. Miss Elizabeth Cornelius, Home Demonstration Agent, was placed in charge of this undertaking and proved herself most efficient and faithful throughout the long siege. Without her it could not have been accomplished. Mr. C. H. Robertson supervised this work and rendered every assistance possible, and as chairman of West Hill was untiring in his efforts to do everything in his power. Misses Emma Robertson and Mildred Durham were Miss Cornelius' assistants during the entire time and Miss Rebecca Wall also rendered valuable aid for several weeks. As many as 150 people were fed daily for some time, and an average of 90 for most of the time. Not only the sick were furnished with nourishment, but the families with no one to cook or provide for them were furnished with the proper diet. Mrs. Emerson and Miss Allie Graham were secured by the Mill to do nursing, and Miss Duncan, the deaconess at the Mills, with these two, rendered most valuable service and gave unstintingly of their time and strength. After preparing the nourishment the ladies at the diet kitchen went with the nurses to deliver it where it was needed.\n\nEno Mill also secured another trained nurse, Miss Whitfield, and Bellevue Mill secured Miss Smith from Durham. Mr.\n\nPage 77\n\nChester Turner and Ross Turner (colored) did noble service as volunteer nurses wherever the need arose.\n\nAs County Chairman, Mr. T. H. Webb was most active and efficient and untiring in his labors, and was especially helpful when the need was great in the Bellevue district. He and Mrs. Webb sent food and clothing to those in need.\n\nRev. Mr. Bradshaw worked long and faithfully when the epidemic extended into the town, collecting and delivering nourishment furnished and made by ladies throughout the town. He was assisted in this by Mrs. J. C. Webb driving him to the homes where he had to go, and when it was impossible for Mrs. Webb to continue, a car and driver were furnished by Mr. J. C. Webb for this purpose until the epidemic was past.\n\nAs soon as the need for nurses was felt, Miss Henrietta Collins volunteered to go wherever needed, and later Miss Virgie Cole volunteered, but they were not called upon to serve.\n\nThe Relief Work was organized and carried on by the County Board of Health, but most if not all workers were members of the Red Cross. Below are the minutes of a meeting held in connection with this work.\n\nA special meeting of the Executive Committee of the Red Cross was held October 26th, at 10:00 o'clock in Major Graham's office. There were present Major Graham, Mr. Robertson, Mrs. J. C. Webb, Mrs. W. H. Webb, Mr. T. N. Webb, Mr. N. W. Brown, Miss H. P. Collins, Mr. Bradshaw and Dr. Spurgeon. This meeting was for the purpose of co-operating with the Committee for the Relief of the Influenza Epidemic, of which committee Mr. T. N. Webb is County Chairman. A motion was carried that there be appointed a chairman of a Nursing Committee of each of the two school districts to whom application may be made for nurses to serve anywhere in our jurisdiction, a record of volunteers to be reported to the Secretary, who was to keep it. Mr. T. N. Webb was appointed Chairman of this Committee for the West Hill School District and Miss Russell for the Hillsboro District.\n\nPage 78\n\nA canvass of the town was made the day of this Red Cross meeting to tell the people of the need for nurses and to ask for volunteers who might be called upon if necessary. The Red Cross was asked to furnish gauze face masks and this work was done at the work room as long as a supply was needed.\n\nThe ladies of the Red Cross were asked to make garments for the sick in emergency cases, and this was gladly done at a moment's notice. People were very generous in furnishing butter-milk and soup not only those in town but a quantity of milk was furnished by people out of town, especially east of town. The Rev. Mr. Hester, Mr. and Mrs. C. H. Robertson, and Mrs. J. C. Webb alternatively collected this milk for use at West Hill and in town. Among those who helped by serving or furnishing nourishment are:\n\nMiss Hattie Kirkland,\n\nMrs. Giles,\n\nMrs. Tom Jackson,\n\nMrs. Frank Weaver,\n\nMrs. James Scarlett,\n\nMrs. Jesse Martin,\n\nMrs. Cain Roberts,\n\nMrs. John Bacon,\n\nMrs. W.

D. Benton, Director; Mrs. Shepherd Strudwick, Accompanist; Mrs. Norfleet Webb, President; Mrs. Allen Browning, Vice-President; Mrs. Grover Bivins, Secretary. It was decided to meet at the court house every Thursday evening at 8:00 o'clock. Mrs. Norfleet Webb offered the use of her piano for the duration of the war and her offer was gladly accepted.\n\nThe Community Chorus was in existence for some time before its formal organization and sang patriotic songs at all the public meetings, gatherings, etc. On August, 1918, a concert was given and the proceeds, amounting to $73.00, were given to the local Red Cross Chapter. On account of the epidemic of Spanish influenza the Chorus did not meet from October till January. Then one meeting was held in the High School building, but on account of a second outbreak of the epidemic no more meetings were held until March. It was decided to have the High School as the permanent meeting place. The Chorus has planned to give four concerts a year and give the money to the Daughters of the Confederacy to help erect a Public Library as a memorial to the Orange County Confederate soldiers. The Community Chorus has over fifty members.\n\nPage 81\n\nLOCAL EXEMPTION BOARD.\n\nJames H. Webb, Chairman,\n\nR. L. Strowd, Secretary,\n\nDr. C. D. Jones,\n\nMEDICAL BOARD.\n\nI. H. Manning,\n\nR.

P. Efland, of Efland, N. C., Mr. J. C. Webb called a meeting of representative men of Orange County to meet at the Commercial Club in Hillsboro, June 1919, to make plans for the celebration of the home-coming of the soldiers of Orange County. Mr. Webb was appointed chairman of the Celebration Committee, with authority to appoint all other committees. As a result the following were appointed:\n\nCommittee on Finance: S. A. Johnson, J. H.

Webb, to furnish a Pageant representing historical events in Orange County from Revolutionary days through the World War. The work of preparing and producing this pageant is entirely under the direction of Mr. A. Vermont of the University.\n\nAt the request of the Chairman of the Celebration for the returned soldiers, Mr. C. H. Robertson, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Red Cross, called a meeting of the Red Cross Executive Committee and other representative workers in the Red Cross at the court house on June 20, 1919, at six o'clock. After the meeting was called to order the chairman asked Mr. Webb to explain the purpose of the meeting, which was to enlist the help of the ladies of the Red Cross in decorating the town and in serving the dinner of the soldiers on July 16, 1919. He made known the plans for the day and all expressed themselves as most anxious to do everything possible for the success of the day. Mr. Robertson then appointed Mrs. W. L.

Long weeks of planning, working and preparing culminated that day in a celebration of which the people of Hillsboro and of Orange County may well be proud. Early in the morning automobiles, carriages, buggies and wagons began streaming into town and soon side streets and vacant lots were lined with machines, horses, mules and vehicles of all kinds, and streets and squares were thronged with eager, happy crowds gathered to welcome home again from battle-field and training camp the brave young soldiers and sailors of Orange County. Streets and public buildings, stores and houses had been beautifully decorated with flags and bunting and \"Welcome\" banners which filled the town with bright colors and added greatly to the beauty of the scene. The towns of Durham and Chapel Hill most generously lent all their flags and decoration supplies and did all in their power to help supply the necessary material. Every care had been taken by the people of the town to provide for the comfort of their guests. At intervals along the streets were placed barrels of ice water and lemonade booths, and two rest rooms were provided for the ladies, one at the Masonic Lodge and one at the Hillsboro Commercial Club.\n\nThe Committee on arrangements expected fifteen thousand people and the crowd fully realized their expectations. Visitors came not only from all the surrounding country, but also from the towns of Chapel Hill, Durham and Raleigh. The exercises of the day were opened by a parade which formed at the Baptist Church and marched to the Court House in the following order:\n\nConfederate Veterans, Page 113\n\nRed Cross Workers,\n\nBoy Scouts,\n\nWhite soldiers and sailors,\n\nColored soldiers and sailors,\n\nColored Red Cross Workers.\n\nThe Governor was escorted to the speaker's stand by Gen. J. S. Carr and a representative company of the Confederate Veterans.\n\nImmediately after the parade the crowd gathered about the court house square to hear the Governor's address. The address of welcome was delivered by Hon. Frank Nash in behalf of the Mayor, immediately following which Governor Bickett was introduced by Major John W. Graham. The Governor delivered a splendid address.\n\nImmediately following the Governor's address the crowd adjourned to Cameron Park, where dinner was served to the men in uniform, Confederate Veterans, Boy Scouts, Summer School students taking part in the play, and the Governor's party, and other official guests. The dinner consisted of fried chicken, ham and rolls, pickle, sliced bread, barbecue, coca-cola, ice-cream and cake, and owing to the efficiency and untiring efforts of the ladies in charge it proved a great success. Fully a thousand guests were served. Hon. S. M. Gattis was toastmaster, and at the close of the dinner ten-minute talks were made by Gen. J. S. Carr, Col. Sidney Minor, Col. Don Scott. Col. J. H. Pratt, Maj. L. P. McLendon and Capt. Sandy Graham. Dinner was served to the colored soldiers and sailors at the colored school house. The hams and chickens for both dinners were contributed by the people throughout the surrounding country and were prepared and cooked by the ladies of the town.\n\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon the play \"Esther Wake\" was to be given at Cameron Park by students of the University of\n\nPage 114\n\nNorth Carolina Summer School, under the direction of Mr. Adolph Vermont, who himself wrote the play which represents scenes from the early history of Hillsboro and Orange County. Long before the appointed time the hillside facing the natural stage was covered with a crowd of over five thousand people eagerly awaiting the beginning of the performance, which took place immediately after an introductory address by Mr. Albert Coates of Chapel Hill and a few words by Mr. Vermont. The play, which is itself a fine piece of work, was splendidly acted, the costumes were beautiful and the scenes most interesting, so that it was a great regret and disappointment to all when a heavy thunder storm interrupted the second act and continued with such violence that it was impossible to go on with the play.\n\nBut in spite of the inclement weather, at its close the day was considered by all a splendid success and will long be a bright spot in the memory of those who had the pleasure of taking part in it. A committee under Mr. S. Strudwick served as special police and traffic managers for the day, and it may be said that no crowd could have been more generally good-natured, quiet and well-behaved than that which attended the celebration. We feel that this account would be incomplete without a few words of thanks and appreciation for those who have made this celebration possible. Chief among these is Mr. J. C. Webb, Chairman of the Orange County Council of Defense, to whose anergetic, efficient and untiring efforts is largely due the success of the day. But he was not alone. Chairmen of committees, committees themselves, workers and helpers of all kinds together with loyal citizens throughout the county gave unstintingly of their time and energy,\n\nPage 115\n\nas well as of their goods and substance, for the success of the occasion. It was an undertaking close to the hearts of all the people, in which all heartily co-operated and in which all thoroughly proved their generosity and their ability. So popular was this movement that the funds for expenses were largely oversubscribed.\n\nHOME COMING CELEBRATION IN CHAPEL HILL.\n\nOne of the greatest patriotic celebrations ever staged in Chapel Hill took place Saturday, May 10th, 1919, honoring the young and old veterans of the surrounding country. It was a big success. Chapel Hill citizens demonstrated their ability in doing things in this grand celebration. They simply outdid themselves and they deserve the praise they are receiving from all sides. Despite the lowering clouds, which threatened rain early in the day, and kept many families from coming to Chapel Hill, hundreds of people were here, so that when the parade started at 11 o'clock both sides of Franklin and Columbia Streets were lined with men, women and children, representing Orange, Alamance, Chatham and Durham counties, in large numbers joined hands in extending to the old heroes, of which there were about thirty in number, who wore the grey, and the heroes of the world war, who went from this community to camp and battlefield and to other branches of the service, a hearty \"Welcome Home\".\n\nThe parade, which included in the line of march the Confederate Veterans, the overseas and training camp troops, the former S. A. T. C. students, the navy, marine and aviation men, the school children, the Boy Scouts, the flag girls, the Y. M. C. A. and the Red Cross groups, Colonel Joseph Hyde Pratt and his staff,\n\nPage 116\n\nthe Daughters of the Confederacy and the Home Guard, marked the opening of the day's celebration.\n\nThe parade was followed by appropriate exercises in Memorial Hall, when eloquent addresses paid fitting tribute to old and new soldiers. Splendid speeches were made by Dr. Archibald Henderson, Major L. P. McLendon, and Colonel Joseph Hyde Pratt. The spacious hall was filled to overflowing, which is to say that over 2,000 crowded in. Major William Cain presided.\n\nAn elaborate spread was served to the overseas and training camp men, speakers and guests following the speech-making program. The local Daughters of the Confederacy were mainly responsible for the huge success accorded the occasion, although all Chapel Hill organizations co-operated in a splendid manner. Dr. A. H. Patterson, chief marshal, was chairman of the program committee.\n\nThe parade, which began at 11 o'clock, was divided into three divisions, Lieut. E. R. Rankin was marshal of the first division, which included the band under the direction of L. F. Parker, the members of the U.D.C., the flag girls, under Miss Schell, the civil war veterans in autos, and the school children. The second division of which Lieut. F. W. Morrison was marshal, was composed of the Red Cross and Y. M. C. A. groups, the Home Guard, the march of the allies, the Boy Scouts, and the flower girls.\n\nLieut. A. B. Sims was marshal for the third division, which included Col. Pratt and his staff; the overseas troops under the command of Lieut. H. A. Whitfield; the troops from the training camps under the command of Lieut. R. F. Moseley; the naval contingent\n\nPage 117\n\nunder the command of Ensign Grady Pritchard; the aviation and marine contingents, the color companies; the service flag bearers, and the speakers for the memorial exercises.\n\nColonel Pratt served in the capacity of general of the divisions. First Lieut. Graham Ramsey acted as colonel of the regiment, which First Lieut. Bruce Webb served as major of the University battalion. In Colonel Pratt's staff were Major P. H. Winston, First Lieut. Thorndike Savillo, and all unattached second lieutenants and other commissioned officers.\n\nChapel Hill was bedecked in gala attire for the occasion. National and Confederate flags and \"Welcome Home\" banners were stretched across the streets at close intervals. The stores were also prettily decorated. The automobiles and other floats were a blaze of color.\n\nMajor William Cain, one of the best and most favorably known Confederate veterans in these parts, presided over the exercises in Memorial Hall, which were opened by invocation by Rev. E. L. Baskin, formerly chaplain in the army. Major Cain, in opening the exercises and introducing the speakers who were to follow, praised in highest terms the undaunted spirit of the North Carolina troops, \"who like crusaders have battled in a just cause and returned covered with glory and honor\". The 30th Division, he pointed out, which won immortal distinction, was composed largely of North Carolina troops. He voiced the welcome of the community in having the boys back again from the training camps and battle scarred fields of France.\n\nDr. Archibald Henderson, himself the son of a Confederate\n\nPage 118\n\nveteran, was the next speaker on the program. He declared that the traditions of the '60s is today enhanced and enriched by the legacy of 1917 and 1918. \"Today,\" he said, \"in the same breath we celebrate a lost and won cause. But\", he said, turning to the veterans, \"your glory is enhanced rather than dampened by your participation in a lost cause, for you won imperishable fame which is secure.\" He referred to the military leaders of the Confederacy as some of the greatest the world has ever known, citing instances where European commanders in the past war have declared that the strategies of Lee, Jackson and Forrest were unsurpassed. He paid a high tribute to the valorous troops who broke the unbreakable Hindenburg line and praised their unmeasured courage and devotion.\n\nProfessor George M. McKie read a list of the Chapel Hill and University students who have made the supreme sacrifice, and paid a tribute to the dead heroes.\n\nMajor L. P. McLendon, of Durham, who commanded Battery C. of the 115th Artillery, which was composed of many Chapel Hill boys, expressed the happiness of the men in returning home from France and their appreciation of the welcome accorded them by people everywhere and especially at home. He paid a high tribute to the late Charles B. Wills, a Chapel Hill boy who made the supreme sacrifice in France. He declared that the best two good results of the war were the abandonment of the selfish doctrine of localism and seclusion, and the revival of patriotism which apparently was on the wane.\n\nColonel Joseph Hyde Pratt, who commanded the 105th\n\nPage 119\n\nEngineers, after expressing the appreciation for the reception accorded the soldiers, declared that the men never realized that America could be appreciated so much until they returned. He gave unstinted praise to the enlisted men, who at all times and under all circumstances did their work willingly. The fullest co-operation was maintained between the officers and privates, he said. He also took occasion to pay a glowing tribute to the American navy, declaring that no navy has ever accomplished such a tremendous piece of work in such a short while as the American navy during the war.\n\nA benediction by Rev. E. L. Baskin concluded the services."
