        "meta_description": "Richard B. “Rich” Mangum of Nampa, Idaho, passed away Sunday, December 8, 2013. Memorial services will be held Monday, December 16th, 2013, at Summers Funeral Home, Ustick Chapel (3629 E. Ustick Rd.) at 10:00 am. Directly following will be a graveside service at Dry Creek Cemetery in Eagle, Idaho.  Richard was born January 24, 1963, in Burley, Idaho, to H. Kay and Richard C. Mangum. Richard lived the majority of his life in Eagle, Idaho. He attended Meridian High School (Class of 1981). He then joined the military and was a heavy equipment operator. In 1982, he married Julie Caward, and they had four children: Lisa, born March 1983; Loni, July 1987; Jerry, January 1989; and Jeff, May 1990. One of the joys of Richard's life was becoming a Grandpa to his three granddaughters, Riley, Regan and Averi.  His favorite name to call them was 'Little Booger Pickers.'  Richard will miss the upcoming birth of his first grandson, Jaxson, in January.  In February 2008, Richard married his soul mate, Tracie deBoer.  Richard and Tracie both shared a love of NASCAR racing, and Richard’s favorite driver was Kevin Harvick.  Richard was a walking, talking encyclopedia of NASCAR; if you had any questions, he was the man to ask. They also shared a love of the outdoors.  Every weekend, Rich and Tracie would take off to their cabin in Centerville, Idaho. Sitting around the campfire with his family and friends in Centerville, Richard enjoyed life to the fullest, going on long 4-wheeler rides, snowmobiling and getting firewood.  Richard was at home when he was in Centerville; it was his get-away from the hustle and bustle of town.  He will be greatly missed by his family and all who knew and loved him.  Richard is survived by his wife, Tracie deBoer, of Nampa, ID; his mother and step-father, H. Kay Mangum and David Orm of Eagle, ID; his sisters and their husbands, Pamela (Scott) Lottman  of Boise, ID; Vicki (Chris) Rodgers of Kuna, ID; and Peggy (Steven) Wallace  of Kuna, ID.  He is also survived by his children, Jerry (Ashlee) Mangum of Kuna, ID; Lisa Mangum (Mitch) of Kuna, ID; Loni Mangum; and Jeffrey Mangum of Boise, ID; two nieces and a nephew; and recently a great grandniece.  He was preceded in death by his brother, Jerry; his father, Richard; and his stepfather, LaVond; his maternal and paternal grandparents; and several aunts and uncles.",
