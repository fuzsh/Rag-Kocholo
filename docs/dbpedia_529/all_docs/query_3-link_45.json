        "text": "Hicks wrote, in part, “… You have pierced the healing wounds of passion in my heart and set them to bleeding again. Father, once more I tell you … I am an altered boy….” After his Naval service, his life took many turns, many of them notorious. He practiced law, took up acting and traveled widely. Hicks fought in the Yucatan at the tail end of the Mexican War where he earned the nickname “Yankee Dare Devil.” His descendant notes that he was involved with the Filibusterers, a rogue military group led by William Walker, which plotted to overthrow governments in Central America. He ventured there many times and, on a planned trip to Nicaragua in 1856, he was arrested before his ship, the Orizaba, set sail from the United States and held in $2,000 bail. He argued that he was not sailing as a U.S. citizen but as an officer in the Army of General Walker in the service of an independent government. He was soon released and became deeply involved in the theater, playing Iago in Othello at the Old Broadway Theater in 1858 and Hamlet a year later at Burton’s Theater. Hicks starred in several productions with William Booth, the brother of John Wilkes Booth, President Abraham Lincoln’s assassin. He traveled to Europe in the fall of 1860 where he joined the forces of Giuseppe Garibaldi and his Red Shirts in their quest to unite Italy. He wrote to his sister and the Daily Alta California about his experiences, boasting:\n\nI arrived in Naples and proceeded immediately to Caserta, the head-quarters of the Dictator [Garibaldi], who received me like a Prince, saying, ‘It gives me much pleasure to welcome a representative from the great and glorious Republic, America.’ For two days I was quartered at the Royal Palace, and feasted at the Royal table, with the Dictator and his staff… We are now occupying Santa Maria and San Angelo, near the walls of Capua, and the Royalists keep up an almost incessant bombarding from morning till night, wasting powder and shells. Our camp is all alive and we are hourly expecting a general battle, which will be the most fearful of any which has taken place. I am now writing to an accompaniment of the booming of the enemy’s cannon and the call of our own bugle. We are ready for them.\n\nUpon his return to New York, Hicks lectured about his Italian adventures and admiration for Garibaldi, including a speech in Bennington, Vermont, where his wife lived, but headed South at the onset of the Civil War. He enlisted as C. Carroll Hicks as a third lieutenant, mustered into Company A of the 10th Georgia, and appeared on the rolls at Camp Fairfield, Virginia, on May 28, 1861. He was appointed captain and acting quartermaster on June 26, 1861, at which time he was ordered to report for duty to the 10th Georgia Regiment’s Company G from which he was absent with leave in Richmond, Virginia, in August and resigned on September 5, 1861. Although Hicks referred to himself as “colonel,” his descendant notes that his obituary reports that Hicks was given that title by Victor Emmanuel for his bravery in Italy. He then gained notoriety as a blockade runner. An article dated February 21, 1863, in The New York Times identified him as a Confederate detective from Richmond, Virginia, and noted that he had been arrested at the St. Nicholas Hotel in New York City that day. He was held as a political prisoner at Fort Lafayette (see document below), off the Narrows in Staten Island, a site where high file Confederates were imprisoned. On February 23, he was turned over to the Office of the Provost Marshal General of the War Department in Washington, D.C. Upon hearing of Hicks’s arrest as a spy, the Bennington [Vermont] Banner, which had praised Hicks after his speech on Garibaldi called him “an undoubted traveling specimen of unadulterated rascality.” The following newspaper account of March 24, 1863, includes information that Hicks fought at the Battle of First Bull Run; this, however, appears not to have been true and is most likely an embellishment of Hicks’s “larger than life” story. The correspondent in San Francisco’s Daily Alta California reported:\n\nA Notorious Secessionist in Trouble. Charles Carron (sic) Hicks, a Secessionist of considerable notoriety, was arrested in the barroom of the St. Nicholas Hotel, about half-past four o’clock yesterday afternoon, on suspicion of being a spy. The prisoner, it appears, attracted the attention of the officer by his loud abuse of the Administration and profuse praise of Jeff. Davis and the Southern Confederacy. He openly boasted of his having once held a commission in the rebel army, and spoke of Stonewall Jackson and Jeff. Davis in the warmest terms. When receiving some change from the barkeeper for a round of drinks, he became very indignant at being offered some postal currency, and said he would take nothing but specie or Confederate bills. He had no faith in Lincoln’s “greenbacks,” he said, and became so abusive in his remarks that the officer deemed it his duty to take him into custody.\n\nUpon being brought before General Wool, the prisoner acknowledged his name and said he commanded a regiment of rebel soldiery at the seven days’ battles before Richmond. Subsequently he said he was appointed Provost-Marshal at Richmond, and after serving several months in that capacity he grew tired of the service and threw up his commission. Upon being asked if he had his discharge from the rebel Secretary of War, he replied in the negative.\n\nAfter considerable questioning, General Draper decided to imprison the accused until he would give a satisfactory account of himself or take the oath of allegiance.\n\nWhen the Slave States seceded, and the news of the attack upon Fort Sumter reached this city, Hicks, who was always a fire-eater, immediately started for Charleston, and offered his services to the rebels. He procured a position as Captain in an artillery regiment, but soon rose to the position of Colonel, and at the Battle of Bull Run distinguished himself by his bravery and determination “to kill off the d— — —d Yankees,” as he expressed it. Subsequently he took a position on General Winder’s staff at Richmond, and for a long time acted in the capacity of Provost-Marshal.\n\nWe next hear of him as a blockade runner, and in one of the Southern newspapers he is spoken of as a person who has done the Confederacy some service by the skillful manner in which he landed a valuable cargo at Charleston. The Richmond Dispatch of the 17th instant advises us of his very latest movement, and under its local head makes mention of him as follows:\n\nA FORMER CITIZEN TURNED TRAITOR— A few months since the privateer Retribution sailed from a Southern port, having as captain Vernon Locke, a well known English shipmaster, and as first and second officers Captain Parker, formerly of the privateer Dixie, and Charles Carroll Hicks, formerly of General Winder’s police. It was the declared intention of Captain Locke to run all his prizes into Wilmington, North Carolina, if possible. After being out a week he captured the brig T. Elliot, of Boston, on board of which was placed a prize crew in charge of Hicks with orders to make his way into Wilmington. The Yankee papers, in giving an account of the retaking of the prize, says she was delivered up by her crew. It appears that after Hicks got possession of the T. Elliot he cruised around for a short time and finally bore away to St. Thomas, where the vessel was given up to Commodore Willis’ squadron.\n\nFrom the above extract it would appear that Hicks is a double traitor. We are inclined to doubt the truth of the Dispatch’s statement, however, and think that the paragraph is intended as a ruse to throw us off our guard concerning the rebel’s real movement. His mission at the North cannot be a very friendly one at all event, and he should be under the strict surveillance of the police during his stay in this city.\n\nHis descendant notes that Hicks served 190 days as a prisoner of war at the Old Capitol Prison, where he wrote to his brother Julius (see), a Union soldier, “I have left the Confederacy forever…I came to New York in good faith…but I am at present in prison.” In spite of Julius’s request to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to visit his brother, Julius’s request was denied. Eventually, Charles Hicks was pardoned on condition “that he not enter the service of the vessels again.” He was released on August 24, 1863, and according to a news article, “He states that he was kindly treated and rendered comfortable by the officers of the prison, and has reason to regret only his confinement.”\n\nHicks returned to his acting career with a traveling troupe, married again, this time to the stage actress known as Ellen Grey (often cited as the author of the mysterious “Ellen Eyre” letter to Walt Whitman) in 1866. By 1868, he returned to the practice of law in Fort Wayne, Indiana, but was in financial difficulty. That same year, he became involved in politics supporting Horatio Seymour, the governor of New York who was seeking the Democratic nomination for President; Seymour was a critic of President Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation. When Hicks stumped for Seymour in Indiana, the New Albany (Indiana) Daily Commercial, referred to Hicks as a “malignant rebel” and reported, “A fine fellow is he to instruct the people of Indiana ‘how to maintain the Constitution.’” After his law practice floundered, he achieved some success as a traveling fabric salesman, eventually settling in Philadelphia. He was living in Philadelphia in 1884 when he was briefly confused with a British daredevil named Hicks who was embroiled in military intrigue in Egypt and Sudan. It took months for reporters to straighten out the details of the identity of William Hicks, the adventurer. In 1904, he became a resident at the Old Men’s Home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he died. Section 180, lot 12164, grave 6.\n\nHICKS, JR., HENRY W . (or A.) (1839-1863). Captain, 165th New York Infantry, Company B; private, 7th Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company F. Of English birth, he enlisted at New York City as a private in 1861 and mustered into the 7th Regiment, one of the first units to take up arms. The 7th was at Washington, D.C., and later fought at the Battle of First Bull Run, Virginia, on July 21 before mustering out in August 1861. When the 7th Regiment was called up in 1862, Hicks re-enlisted on May 25, 1862, mustered into the 7th Regiment that day, and mustered out with his company after three months on September 5 at New York City. He re-enlisted at New York City as a captain on September 18, 1862, and was immediately commissioned into the 165th Infantry, part of the 2nd Duryée Zouaves. He was officially promoted to captain on December 3, 1862, with rank from September 18. Hicks wrote to his brother from Port Hudson, Louisiana, on June 11, 1863:\n\nDear Sam:\n\nWe have made an attack on the Batteries here and we have sustained very heavy loss and were repulsed, as I have already informed you through a letter to mother. We are about to make another assault, and I have been detailed, with one hundred and fifty (150) men, to lead it. That is to be the forlorn hope. I send this through a friend of mine who is kind enough to volunteer to see it posted from New Orleans. The affair will be pretty desperate. I will let you know at the earliest opportunity what the result may be. I merely wrote this to let you know where I am and to be prepared for anything that may happen. In case I fall, I will bid you now an affectionate farewell.\n\nYour affectionate brother,\n\nHENRY W. HICKS, Jr.\n\nActing Major 165th N.Y.S.V., 2d Zouaves\n\nDon’t say anything to the family until you hear the result. If I fall, my friends in the regiment will inform you.\n\nHis obituary in the Evening Post notes that he was engaged in all of the assaults on Port Hudson, in one of which he led his regiment with “distinguished gallantry.” Hicks was discharged on July 13, 1863, as per Special Order 169, from Headquarters, Department of the Gulf. He died from typhoid fever on August 19, at his home in Clifton, Staten Island. Although William Swinton, in his History of the Seventh Regiment (1876), states that Hicks was mortally wounded at Port Hudson, that is incorrect; his obituary, which confirms his Civil War service, confirms that he died at home from typhoid fever, contracted at Port Hudson. Section 75, lot 11819.\n\nHICKS, JR., JOHN M. (1839-1881). Private, 13th Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company G. After enlisting as a private at Brooklyn on May 28, 1862, Hicks mustered into the 13th Regiment, Heavy Artillery, and mustered out three months later on September 12 at Brooklyn. As per the census of 1880, he was a wholesale grocer. His funeral took place at the home of his father at 115 Remsen Street in Brooklyn. Hicks died from bronchitis. Section 60, lot 777.\n\nHICKS, JULIUS C. (1825-1866). Major, 16th New York Heavy Artillery, Companies E, A, and I; captain, 15th New York Engineers, Company D. Originally from Rutland, Vermont, and a builder by trade, Hicks was 5′ 7″ tall with blue eyes, brown hair and a light complexion at the time of his enlistment. After enlisting as a captain at New York City on May 9, 1861, he was commissioned into the 15th New York Engineers the next month on June 17, and mustered out on June 25, 1863. Returning to service on December 16, 1863, he re-enlisted as a captain at Rikers Island, New York, and was immediately commissioned into Company E of the 16th New York Heavy Artillery. He was discharged on March 1, 1864, upon report of the examining board, and was promoted to second lieutenant on June 1, 1864, effective upon his transfer to Company A. Hicks rose to the rank of captain on June 22, 1864, effective upon his transfer to Company I that day. On November 13, 1864, he was promoted to major and was transferred to the Field and Staff. As per his widow’s pension application, Hicks was treated for hemorrhage of the lungs from the fall of 1864 until his discharge. He mustered out on August 21, 1865, at Washington, D.C.\n\nJulius and Charles Carroll Hicks, a Confederate officer and spy (see) were brothers. He succumbed to consumption, contracted while in the line of duty, at his home at 108 East 14th Street in New York City. His widow, Armenia Hicks, applied for and received a pension in November 1866, certificate 104,949. In support of Mrs. Hicks’s pension request, numerous written testimonies were forwarded to the Pension Bureau. Hicks’s local physician attributed his tubercular consumption to exposure and hardships while serving in the Army. Hicks’s mother-in-law, with whom he resided, testified that Hicks never applied for a pension because he fully expected to recover and that having “comfortable pecuniary circumstances” would not need one. However, “he at last got so bad that he was unable to leave the house, and before he sought to obtain his pension could not bear the necessary fatigue to make application for the same.” Colonel J. J. Morrison of the 16th Heavy Artillery wrote that Hicks had been in good health without any complaints until the fall of 1864 when he had a lung hemorrhage, a condition that continued to plague him until his discharge and one contracted in the service and while in the line of duty. One of the surgeons who treated him during his last months of service noted that in the spring of 1865, the lung hemorrhage was very profuse and that at the time of Hick’s discharge, he was “laboring under the same disease.” Other written testimonies attested to his general good health while in service except for instances of “camp diarrhea.” He was the brother-in-law of William Wallace Horton (see). Section 180, lot 12357.\n\nHIDDEN, HENRY B. (1839-1862). Lieutenant, 1st New York Cavalry, Company H. A native New Yorker, he was born into a wealthy family. His maternal great-great grandfather, Thomas Ivers, was one of the “Tea Partiers” from New York. Hidden was also a brother-in-law of shipbuilder William Webb. He was educated at top schools, then spent time with a merchant in Havana perfecting his Spanish, and sailing with his brother-in-law to St. Petersburg and other European cities. During the Civil War, he enlisted at New York City on August 5, 1861, and was immediately commissioned into the 1st New York Cavalry, also known as Lincoln’s Cavalry. One biography notes that he was 5′ 10″ tall, graceful and genial in spirit. That biography states that in his six months in camp, he never tired of drill or his “mud-beleaguered quarters.” On March 9, 1862, he died of a gunshot wound to the neck while leading a charge of 14 dragoons against 150 Confederate infantry at Sangster’s Station, Virginia. His biography notes that he was found, face-down with his blood-stained sword in his hand. Colonel George W. Taylor, 3rd New Jersey Volunteers, wrote about Hidden’s gallantry:\n\nI had under my orders of the First New York Cavalry 16 men and one corporal, under First Lieutenant Hidden. Just before leaving the railroad I ordered this officer to advance in the open fields and reconnoiter, and if the force was not greatly superior to his own he might charge them. He went off at a brisk trot, nor did he check his horses until he charged into the midst of their pickets, the enemy being greatly superior in numbers, and having the advantage of cover of pines. He lost his life in the gallant charge, but drove the enemy into rapid retreat, leaving arms and many knapsacks and blankets. Thirteen prisoners were taken, with a lieutenant and non-commissioned officer. They proved to be the First Maryland Regiment.\n\nHidden is believed to be the first Army of the Potomac cavalry officer killed in action and the first officer of a Union volunteer cavalry killed in the Civil War. His brother and brother-in-law went to Washington, D.C., to recover and bring back his remains. On March 15, 1862, the officers of the regiment met at Camp Kearny, Virginia, to issue resolutions of condolence for his family. They said of Hidden:\n\nIn his death we have lost an esteemed friend, a gallant soldier and a brilliant social companion. While far in advance of the army, attached to a small command for the purpose of ascertaining the location and strength of the enemy, he was called upon to perform extraordinary services and to undergo unusual hardships. He shrank from no emergency, but was only too anxious to be placed where the danger was greatest. When finally brought face to face with an opposing force far superior to his as regards numbers, he did not hesitate a moment, but at the head of fourteen men charged upon one hundred and fifty well-armed infantry, driving them from the field, capturing thirteen prisoners, and utterly dispersing the entire force while cutting his way to the officer commanding the enemy. His brilliant career was ended forever by a single shot which killed him instantly. In the language of his commanding officer, “Lieutenant Hidden has illustrated, in the sacrifice of his life, the whole cavalry service. He has introduced for it a new era.”\n\nThe committee resolved that they “sincerely regret that our duties in the field would not permit us to pay his remains that attention which we should otherwise have claimed as our privilege to do.” He was eulogized at his funeral as a young man who “was anxious to find an opportunity to tread the path of honor, beset as it might be with dangers.” His desire for good was seen in his regiment, “where the men loved him devotedly, would follow him to the death, and mourned his loss with the bitter tears wrung so hardly from the eyes of stern manhood.” On March 16, the 71st Regiment, New York State Militia, Company F, escorted his remains to Green-Wood Cemetery. Hidden’s coffin was draped in an American flag and his horse, Chance, followed the hearse with an empty saddle and draped spurs as the cortege moved along streets filled with throngs of people. His grave is marked by a bronze relief by Karl Muller. He last lived on St. Marks Place in Manhattan. Hidden’s charge inspired two artists; Victor Nehling painted An Episode of the War-The Cavalry Charge of Lt. Henry B. Hidden in 1875, a work on display at the New-York Historical Society, and Frank Leslie illustrated the skirmish at Sangster’s Station in The Soldier of Our Civil War in 1893. Section 9, lot 11307.\n\nHIGGINBOTHAM (or HIGINBOTHAM), THOMAS H. (1827-1864). Lieutenant colonel, 65th New York Infantry, Company K. Higginbotham enlisted at Tiffin, Ohio, as a captain, on July 1, 1861, and was commissioned into Company K of the 65th New York on August 3. After a promotion to major on November 2, 1863, he was transferred to Field and Staff, and later became lieutenant colonel on January 6, 1864. Taken as a prisoner of war on May 10, 1864, at Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia, he was paroled a month later on June 15, and was killed in battle at Cedar Creek, Virginia, on October 19, 1864. Section 107, lot 15442.\n\nHIGGINS, MARTIN (1832-1894). Private, 5th New York Heavy Artillery, Battery D. After Higgins enlisted as a private at New York City on March 24, 1862, he mustered immediately into Battery D of the 5th New York Heavy Artillery, and deserted on May 22, 1862, at Fort Schuyler, New York Harbor. In civilian life, he was a broker in sugar and molasses and owned property in Brooklyn.\n\nAs per an article in the New York Tribune on April 23, 1877, Higgins, in a fit of religious mania, was throwing five dollar bills into a fire on Chatham Street. His obituary notes that he was committed to the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum in 1877. The obituary states that at the time of his death at the Bloomingdale Asylum, the gentleman in charge of his estate had paid $17,000 for his care there and that the $6,000 remaining in his estate would be turned over to the county by the public administrator because there were no relatives and no will. John Cowen, the man in charge of his estate, wrote in an affidavit that Higgins had told him that he was brought up in a charitable institution in New York City, had no knowledge of his parents and no relatives. Section 135, lot 27263, grave 2193.\n\nHIGHAM, CHARLES EDWARD (1838-1909). Private, 8th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company H. A New York City native, Higham served twice in the 8th Regiment, first when he enlisted as a private in 1861 and served for three months. In 1862, he returned to the same company of the 8th Regiment, New York State National Guard, for three months. The 1880 census and a New York City Directory list him in the wood business. In 1899, he applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 1,014,558. According to his obituary in the New York Herald, he was a member of the Cornelius Vanderbilt Post #136 of the G.A.R., and the New York Council of the Royal Arcanum. His last address was 1420 Boston Road in the Bronx. Josephine Higham, his widow, applied for a pension in 1909, application 925,619, but there is no certificate number. Section 11, lot 10171, grave 9410.\n\nHILDEBRAND, ALEXANDER G. (1840-1902). Landsman, United States Navy. A Brooklynite, Hildebrand was a stage driver according to the census of 1860. He enlisted as a landsman at New York City on the USS North Carolina, a receiving ship, on August 20, 1862. At that time, he listed no occupation and was 5′ 5¼” tall with dark hair, dark eyes and a dark complexion. He first served at the Washington Navy Yard from September 2 through September 16, 1862, then served onboard the USS Arletta, a mortar schooner that was part of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, until June 9, 1863. The Arletta delivered munitions to Union ships in the vicinity of Wilmington, North Carolina, during his service on that vessel, then headed for Beaufort, North Carolina, where she was stationed as of June 19, 1863. Subsequently, Hildebrand was on the USS Penobscot until August 3, 1863. He was discharged from the USS North Carolina at the Brooklyn Navy Yard ten days later. Hildebrand’s gravestone confirms his service aboard the USS Penobscot, a steam-operated gunboat that was built in 90 days in Belfast, Maine, delivered to the Navy in January 1862 at Boston, Massachusetts, and assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. The Penobscot destroyed the Confederate schooner Sereta off Shallotte Inlet, North Carolina, in June 1862, forced the British ship Pathfinder aground in November of that year, and forced the blockade runner Kate ashore off the Carolina coast in the summer of 1863. The Penobscot was then stationed in the Gulf of Mexico in January 1864 where it joined the blockade off Texas.\n\nAs per the census of 1880, Hildebrand was employed as a laborer. His Civil War service is confirmed by the Veterans Census of 1890. In 1893, he applied for an invalid pension from the Navy, citing inability to work due to rheumatism, hemorrhoids, and heart disease. Hildebrand stated that his hemorrhoids and rheumatism first troubled him in 1866. His affidavit stated that he took care of himself, his disabilities were not due to any “vicious” habits and that he was now troubled with kidney disease. Although his initial application, 38,876, was rejected, he ultimately was approved for an invalid pension of $12 a month as of July 20, 1895, certificate 23,239. The census of 1900 lists him as a bartender. William Hildebrand (see), his brother, also served in the Navy during the Civil War. He last lived on Water Street in West Brighton, Staten Island. His death was due to chronic tuberculosis meningitis. Section 50, lot 9072, grave 1.\n\nHILDEBRAND (or HILDEBRANT), WILLIAM F. (1839-1916). Landsman, United States Navy. Like his brother Alexander Hildebrand (see), he served as a landsman in the United States Navy. A native of New York, Hildebrand enlisted at New York City on August 15, 1864, on the receiving ship USS Vermont and was then assigned to the mortar schooner USS George Mangham for service in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. At that time, he was a teamster who was 5′ 6¼”” tall with hazel eyes, black hair,a dark complexion, and no marks or scars. On April 26, 1865, he was reassigned to the USS Tallapoosa in the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. He was discharged from the USS Ino at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on July 18, 1865, under the name “Hildebrant.”\n\nIn 1882, Hildebrand moved to Staten Island from New York City. His service in the Civil War is confirmed by the Veterans Census of 1890. In 1894, his request for an invalid pension from the Navy was granted under certificate 21,223, and noted “disease of the rectum.” Hildebrand declared that he had bleeding piles (hemorrhoids) and kidney disease. He wrote that the piles started bothering him after leaving the Navy in 1865 and continued to trouble him thereafter. He also stated that the disabilities could not be attributed to “any vicious habits of mine.” The doctors reported that one of his two external piles was the size of a hickory nut and the other, the size of a white bean. At the time his pension was first approved, he received $6.00 per month His original pension payment was increased to $8.00 per month in 1904 and indicated “partial inability to earn a support by manual labor.” According to his pension applications in 1907, 1909, and 1912, he had been working as a huckster (peddler). In addition, his pension application noted that he was 5′ 7½” tall and 140 pounds with black and gray hair, black eyes, and had several tattoos including his initials “W.F. H.” and a female pirate on his left forearm, the goddess of liberty on his right arm, and a star and rose on his right hand. As of May 15, 1914, his pension was increased from $19.00 per month (1912) to $22.50 per month. He last lived at 40 Water Street in West New Brighton, Staten Island. His death was attributed to cerebral apoplexy. Section 50, lot 9072.\n\nHILLBERT (or HELBERG), JOHN JOSEPH (or JAMES) (1843-1910). Private, 1st New York Cavalry, Company F. A native of Germany, he enlisted as a private at New York City on May 14, 1864, and immediately mustered into the 1st New York Cavalry. He was borne on the rolls as James Helberg. According to his soldier records, he was taken as a prisoner of war on March 26, 1865, at White House, Virginia, and paroled four days later at Boulware & Cox’s Wharf. As per his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, which confirms his Civil War service, he was confined in Libby Prison for nine months. This, however, seems doubtful; his military records do not indicate such imprisonment. Libby was primarily used as a prison for officers, not enlisted men, and he only served about a year-there does not seem to be a nine-month period during his service when he might have been imprisoned. He mustered out on June 27, 1865, at Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nHillbert’s obituary indicates that he had been a resident of Brooklyn for fifty years. The obituary also notes that he had been a commercial traveler and subsequently was an inspector in the Brooklyn City Works Department for fourteen years. He was a member of Sumner Post #24 of the G.A.R. and was trustee of the United Presbyterian Church in Cypress Hills. Hillbert last lived at 95 Grant Avenue in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, where he died from heart failure. According to his will, at the time of his death, his personal property totaled $50.

Hilliard, a native of New York, enlisted and mustered into the 71st National Guard when his unit was called into service on June 17, 1863. He was discharged with his regiment after 30 days on July 22. The 1880 census and Hilliard’s obituary in the Tribune state that he was a city weigher. As per his obituary in the New York Herald, he was a member of the Lafayette Post #140 of the G.A.R. and the 71st Veteran Association; members of both organizations were invited to his funeral. He last lived at 222 West 22nd Street in Manhattan. Sadly, Margaret P.

(1838-1886). Corporal, 5th New York Infantry, Company D. Hills was born in New York City. At the start of the Civil War, Hills was employed by the United States Marshal’s Office and was also a hatter. He enlisted at New York City as a private on April 25, 1861, and mustered in on May 9. Hills was slightly wounded at Second Bull Run, Virginia, on August 30, 1862. His wounding likely occurred when the 5th was overrun by the Texas Brigade of Longstreet’s Corps.

A New York State native, Hinchman enlisted at New York City as a private on July 9, 1861, and mustered into the 5th New York, known familiarly as Duryée’s Zouaves, four days later. On May 4, 1863, he transferred into the 146th New York where he was promoted to corporal at some point before his discharge on July 19, 1864, at Petersburg, Virginia. The 1870 census lists him as a clerk. In 1873, he applied for a invalid pension that was granted under certificate 128,936. His death certificate notes that he was a laborer. As per his obituary, his funeral was held at the home of his brother, William Hinchman (see); members of the 5th Regiment were invited to attend his funeral. He last lived in New York City. He died of phthisis. Section 188, lot 15158.\n\nHINCHMAN (or HUNCHMAN), WILLIAM (1835-1897). Corporal, 119th New York Infantry, Company F; 5th New York Veteran Infantry, Company B. Born in Hyde Park, New York, Hinchman was 5’8″ and a boatman by trade. On July 18, 1862, he enlisted at New York City as a corporal, mustered into the 119th on September 4, and was discharged for disability on January 25, 1863. He re-enlisted as a private at New York City on August 29, 1863, mustered into the 5th Veterans on October 19, and was promoted to corporal on August 5, 1864. On August 19, 1864, he was wounded at Weldon Railroad, Virginia, suffering a fracture to his left ulna and a severe arm injury necessitating the amputation of his arm just below the elbow on September 14. He was discharged for disability on May 17, 1865, at Ward’s Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Hinchman also served in Company E of the 4th New York at some point. He and John Hinchman (see) were brothers. As per his obituary in the New York Tribune, he was a retired grocer who was well-known in his neighborhood. He had been traveling with his son in Niagara Falls a few days before his death, caused by heart disease. His last residence was 20 Grove Street in New York City. Section 188, lot 15158, grave 3.\n\nHINCKEN, EDWARD BOYD (1843-1888). Corporal, 23rd Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company G. A native of New York State, Hincken enlisted as a private and served with the 23rd Regiment for 30 days in 1863. His last residence was 272 Berkeley Place in Brooklyn. He died of Bright’s disease. As per Kings County Estate Files, when his will was probated in January 1894, he owned no real estate but had a personal estate of $15,000. His son, daughter, niece, and two grandsons and two granddaughters were named as heirs to his estate. Two of the grandchildren who were named in the will and were infants when the will was written, did not have access to any of their money until they reached the age of fourteen. Section 103, lot 7661.\n\nHINES, HENRY C. (1838-1912). Regiment postmaster, 1st Minnesota Infantry, Company A. A native of Brooklyn, New York, he was a farmer in Polk County, Minnesota, in 1860. A year later, he was a bookkeeper and resident of St. Paul. During the Civil War, Hines enlisted as a private on June 24, 1861. He did not travel East with the 1st Minnesota but traveled on his own to meet up with the Regiment and mustered in at Centerville, Virginia, on July 20, 1861, where he became the drummer for Company A. Hines distinguished himself the next day at the Battle of Bull Run. As per a newspaper report from Minnesota, Hines, who was unarmed, was side-tracked and on a by-road when he was stopped by a Confederate trooper from the Virginia Cavalry. After making a motion to shake the cavalryman’s hand, Hines snatched the rebel’s sword, demanded his revolver, and made him dismount. Taken prisoner by Hines, the cavalryman was then turned over to a captain of a nearby regiment.\n\nHines, who had a background in bookkeeping, was discharged for promotion to regimental postmaster on August 16 of that year. He remained detached as a mail agent for Sedgwick’s Division in October 1862. The St. Paul Daily Union reported on December 10, 1862, that Hines was made postmaster for the Right Grand Division of the Army of the Potomac. On May 24, 1863, the Pioneer Press reported that Hines had returned to Minnesota on the Milwaukee Railroad and was there for a few days. The article noted, “…we are glad to hear he has made a handsome little pile of green backs. Harry has our thanks for a huge bundle of late papers.” Although the date of his discharge is unknown, it is thought to be in May 1863 when he came home and married. He was fortunate to have been discharged before July 2, 1863, when the First Minnesota, badly outnumbered, was sacrificed in order to close a gap in the Union line at Gettysburg. The 1870 census notes that he was living in St. Paul and selling hats and coats. He joined St. Paul’s William Acker G.A.R. Post #21 on May 17, 1870. As per the 1900 census, he was living in Franklin, New Jersey. In 1904, he applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 1,091,382. Anaemia is listed as the cause of death. Section 192, lot 32886.\n\nHINGLE, HENRY W. (1840-1891). Private, 84th New York (14th Brooklyn) Infantry, Company E; Veteran Reserve Corps. A Brooklyn native, Hingle enlisted there on April 18, 1861, and mustered into the 14th Brooklyn on May 23. As per his muster roll, he was a clerk who was 5′ 7″ tall with blue eyes, light hair and a light complexion. He was listed as wounded and sick from May 1862 through June 1863. Subsequently, he was on detached service as a clerk at the United States Army General Hospital in Fairfax Seminary, Virginia, in November and December 1863. During his time in service, the 14th fought in Virginia at the Battles of First and Second Bull Run, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville and at the Battle of Antietam, Maryland. He transferred to Veteran Reserve Corps on July 1, 1863, and to the Invalid Corps on February 15, 1864, from which he mustered out on June 6, 1864, at New York City.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Hingle worked as a clerk and as a paymaster clerk for the City Railroad. As per his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, which notes that he died after a short illness, he was a member of the Fourteenth Veterans’ Association, the Erastus T. Tefft Post #335 of the G.A.R., the Royal Arcanum, and the Capitoline Council of the Order of United Friends. He last lived at 571 Quincy Street, Brooklyn. In 1891, his wife applied for and received a widow’s pension, certificate 351,283. Section 200, lot 26319.\n\nHINMAN, RICHARD H. (1827-1862). Surgeon, 67th New York Infantry. After enlisting as a surgeon on May 14, 1861, at Brooklyn, he was commissioned into the Field and Staff of the 67th New York on June 24, 1861, at Camp Plymouth in New York Harbor. He was hospitalized with malarial fever at Fortress Monroe, Virginia, on April 29, 1862, and advised to go home to restore his health. He died at his home in Brooklyn on May 22, 1862. Although the surgeon’s paperwork indicates that he died from convulsions at the termination of his illness contracted at Yorktown, his obituary notes that he died from malaria and his soldier record states that he died from disease. His home in Brooklyn was at 128 Remsen Street.\n\nClarissa Hinman applied for and received a widow’s pension of $25.00 per month as of September 15, 1863. Although her pension terminated upon her remarriage in 1866, she reapplied, pursuant to the regulations of the Act of March 3, 1901, after her second husband died. She declared in 1902 that she was unable to find work in the canning establishments in San Jose, California, where she lived and at age 75 was in need of support and re-instatement of her widow’s pension. A note to the Pension Agency states that she died January 3, 1905 and that her pension certificate number was 5,951. Section 78, lot 4556.\n\nHIPPER, JOHN H. (1843-1862). Private, 3rd Maryland Infantry, Companies I and B. Though there is some indication that he was interred at Antietam National Cemetery, there was only one soldier named John Hipper who died during the Civil War, and it appears likely that he was disinterred and moved from Sharpsburg, Maryland, to Green-Wood Cemetery. (Hipper’s gravestone at Antietam National Cemetery is numbered 2562.) Hipper enlisted as a private at New York on September 15, 1861, for a period of three years, and mustered immediately into Company B of the 3rd Maryland at Williamsport, Maryland. The 3rd Maryland was part of 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, 12th Corps.\n\nThere is some discrepancy as to the actual date and cause of his death. Although some military records indicate that Hipper died at Antietam of disease on September 21, 1862, the company muster roll states that Hipper died on September 23 of wounds received at Antietam; the official casualty sheet also indicates that the cause of casualty was “wounded at Antietam” and lists the date of death as September 21, 1862. Green-Wood Cemetery’s records state that, on September 18, 1862, John Hipper, a soldier, died of wounds received at the Battle of Antietam. Before his enlistment, his last residence was Middagh Street in Brooklyn. He was interred at Green-Wood on January 7, 1863. Hipper’s index card at the New York State Military Museum notes that he has marble headstone on his grave at Green-Wood Cemetery. In 1890, his father applied for a survivor’s pension, application 454,180, but there is no evidence that it was certified. Section 115, lot 13536 (Soldiers’ Lot), grave 56.\n\nHIRLEY (or HURLEY), ORLANDO (or OLIVER) V. (or B.) (1836-1896). Private, 38th New York Infantry, Company I; 17th New York Veterans’ Infantry, Company K. Hirley was born in New York. After Hirley enlisted as a private at Horseheads, New York, on May 21, 1861, he mustered into the 38th New York on June 8. His muster roll indicates that he was paid $8.72 from May 7 to June 3, 1861. On July 21, 1861, he was wounded by Confederate gun fire at the Battle of First Bull Run, Virginia, returned to his regiment in January 1862, and was discharged for disability on May 2, 1862, at Washington, D.C. On May 31, 1862, he applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 11,698. Hirley re-enlisted as a private at New York City on September 9, 1863, mustered into Company K of the 17th Veteran’s’ Infantry five days later, and was listed as having deserted at Staten Island on October 20 of that year. However, that might not be accurate; another record indicates that he was discharged at Staten Island on that date.\n\nThe 1879 New York City Directory reports that he was in the shipping business. He was mentioned in an undated newspaper article that he paid Charles F. Junier, a shipping agent at 49th South Street, fees in excess of those allowed by law to procure berths on the schooner J. Nickerson. His last residence was 1879 Dean Street in Brooklyn; his death was caused by pneumonia. Section 127, lot 8259, grave 179.\n\nHIRSCH, HENRY C. (1831-1868). Private, 178th New York Infantry, Company I. Of German origin, Hirsch enlisted on August 19, 1863, at New York City, as a private. After mustering into the 178th New York on September 3, he deserted two weeks later on September 17 at Camp Sprague, Staten Island. He last lived on Van Brunt Street in Brooklyn. Section D, lot 7078, grave 268.\n\nHIRSCH, JOSEPH (1832-1883). Private, 56th Regiment, New York State National Guard. Hirsch’s birthplace is noted as “United States” on his death certificate; however, he is listed on a passenger list as arriving in New York City from LeHavre, France, on the Helvetia on June 20, 1855, and is listed as being born in Bavaria (Germany) on the 1860 census. In 1865, Hirsch enlisted as a private and served in the 56th National Guard (new organization). Further details of his service are unknown. As per his death certificate, he was an iron molder. His last residence was 175 Sackett Street, Brooklyn. He died of pulmonary congestion. Section 2, lot 5499, grave 1738.\n\nHOAGLAND, CORNELIUS NEVIUS (or NEVENS) (1828-1898). Chief surgeon, Second Brigade; surgeon, 71st Ohio Infantry; first lieutenant, 11th Ohio Infantry, Company H. He was born in Hillsborough Township in Somerset County, New Jersey, into a family descended from an early New Amsterdam settler. His great-grandfather, Christopher Hoagland, was justice of the peace in Somerset County in 1776 and then was a member of the state legislature. Cornelius’s family moved to Ohio in 1834, where they first had a farm and then owned an inn. Cornelius Hoagland attended public schools, studied Latin privately with a tutor, and later studied medicine, graduating from Western Reserve University in 1852. That same year, he married Eliza Morris, the daughter of a judge; the couple had three daughters. He opened his medical practice in Miami County, Ohio. Also interested in politics, he was elected Miami County Auditor in 1854 and 1856.\n\nAt the onset of the Civil War, Hoagland enlisted as a second lieutenant on April 22, 1861, was promoted to first lieutenant two days later, and was commissioned into Company H of the 11th Ohio, known as the Lafayette Blues, on April 26, 1861. He was subsequently discharged for promotion on June 17, 1861. On October 28, 1861, he enlisted as a surgeon and mustered into the 71st Ohio Infantry on that date. The regiment, part of the Army of the Tennessee, was first sent to Paducah, Kentucky, then participated in the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee (also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing) in April 1862. He then was detached to Clarksville, Tennessee, and later to Gallatin, Tennessee, where his health suffered. After resigning on September 7, 1863, and restoring his health, he mustered in again on November 11, 1863, and was appointed chief surgeon of the Second Brigade in 1864. At the time of the latter appointment, the Second Brigade, in the Atlanta Campaign, was at the front in Atlanta, Georgia. Hoagland was seriously wounded at the Battle of Nashville, Tennessee, on December 16, 1864, by a Minie-ball shot to the breast. The Second Brigade then wintered at Huntsville, Alabama, before returning to East Tennessee in the spring of 1865. Hoagland mustered out on November 30, 1865. At the time of muster out, the troops were ordered to Columbus, Ohio, where the official discharge took place the first week of January 1866. During his service, he was frequently in charge of major field hospitals.\n\nAfter the Civil War, he gave up his medical practice, opened a drug store in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with his brother Joseph, and sold baking powder, a venture that became extremely successful. Living in Brooklyn as of 1868, William Ziegler and John H. Seal were brought in as investors in 1873 and the Royal Baking Company was formed. Falling back on his medical training, Cornelius Hoagland developed Hoagland Laboratories at 335 Henry Street in 1887 to investigate bacteriology, medical science, pathology and physiology. According to The Doctor (1887), the laboratory, a crowning achievement of Long Island College Hospital, was the first institution in the United States, equipped and endowed by private means for the sole purpose of original medical research. The five-floor edifice, which opened on October 1, 1888, had an animal laboratory, lecture halls, private research rooms, bacteriological laboratory, photographic rooms, and an office for Dr. Hoagland.\n\nAs per one biography, the death of his grandson to diphtheria in 1884 reawakened his medical interests and reinforced his belief that the study of medical bacteriology offered mankind great hope against disease. To the original expenditure of about $100,000 he added an initial endowment of $50,000. (Another endowment of $24,000 was made before his death.) Of the original investment, the following expenditures were made: site, $24,000; building, $56,606.74; cabinetry and furniture, $6,675.19; apparatus, $4,090.17; library, $3,093.09; pavement, $1,064.65; total, $95,529.84. According to Lyman Horace Weeks, editor of Prominent Families of New York, a series of biographies, a bronze memorial plaque on the Henry Street façade of Hoagland’s facility read, “the first laboratory in the United States erected equipped and endowed by private means for the sole purpose of bacteriology.” About 82 students and physicians studied bacteriology there and another 1,360 students, many of whom became practicing physicians, studied histology and pathology.\n\nConcurrent with their wealth in the baking powder business, the Hoagland brothers began purchasing real state on Shelter Island for summer recreation and vacation homes. As per Patricia Shillingburg in her article, The Hoagland Brothers on Shelter Island from 1881 to 1896 (2003), which confirms the brothers’ Civil War service, the two men dominated civic life in the Shelter Island Grove and Camp Meeting Association of the Methodist Episcopal Church, also known as The Prospect. By 1886, they had built substantial homes on a prime location overlooking Greenport Harbor, helped run the aforementioned association and founded the Shelter Island Yacht Club in 1886. Shillingburg notes that Cornelius also was interested in horse racing and that his horse, “Lancewood,” came in third in three races at Greenport Driving Park in August 1885. In 1887, Cornelius, concerned with the growing population of Greenport, founded the Greenport Water Company, to tend to the community’s growing need for water service and fire protection. By 1896, the two had sold their properties on Shelter Island and were no longer a presence there.\n\nApparently, there were business controversies related to the running of the Royal Baking Powder Company. After Seal, one of the original investors, died in 1886, Joseph Hoagland wanted to sever his ties with Ziegler and buy him out. Ultimately, Ziegler, who sued Joseph Hoagland for unfair business practices, won his suit on appeal in 1889. At the same time, Cornelius and Joseph were quarreling and Cornelius bought the Cleveland Baking Powder Company in 1887, became its president and moved the factory from Albany to Brooklyn where he managed it successfully.\n\nAn expert photographer with a specialty in photo-micrography, Cornelius Hoagland’s slides were used by many lecturers. He was a fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society of London, a regent of Long Island College Hospital, and a trustee and director of many financial and benevolent institutions. In addition, he directed the Brooklyn Eye and Ear Hospital, and became a proponent and philanthropist in the kindergarten movement hoping to benefit children at an impressionable age. In addition, he was a director of the People’s Trust Company, the Dime Savings Bank and the Brooklyn Heights Railroad as well as having connections to other corporations and colleges (Syracuse University, Antioch College and Adelphi College). Hoagland was a life member of the American Geographical Society, the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, and the Long Island Historical Society. He belonged to the Union League, the Ohio Society, and the Oxford, Brooklyn, Down Town Germania and Hamilton Clubs. As per his obituary in the New York Herald, he was a member of the Military Order Loyal Legion United States Commandery, a patriotic fraternal association, whose members were invited to attend his funeral.\n\nAs per Schillenburg’s article, his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle noted, “To few men is it given to carry the burden of large wealth with such gracious usefulness. No more loyal friendship existed anywhere than he had to give, and no more vital interest was entertained in all public concerns than he cherished.” His last residence was 410 Clinton Avenue, Brooklyn. Section 156, lot 20101.\n\nHOAGLAND, JOSEPH CHRISTOFFEL (1841-1899). Unknown rank, Quartermaster and Subsistence Departments, Ohio Regiments. Hoagland was born in Miami, Ohio, the descendant of Dutch families who had settled in Somerset County, New Jersey. His great-grandfather, Christopher Hoagland, was justice of the peace in Somerset County in 1776 and then was a member of the state legislature. Joseph’s family moved to Ohio in 1834, where they first had a farm and then owned an inn. He was the brother of Cornelius Hoagland (see). Joseph was educated in a high school in Troy, Ohio. As per Patricia Shillingburg in her article, The Hoagland Brothers on Shelter Island from 1881 to 1896 (2003), Joseph served in the Union Army as of 1861 mainly in the quartermaster and subsistence departments and was detailed by Ohio’s Governor Tod for special service at Camp Chase in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nAfter the Civil War, he married Caroline Matlack of Dayton, Ohio; the couple had three children. Embarking in business with his brother, the two opened a drug store in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and sold baking powder, a venture that became extremely successful. Living in Brooklyn as of 1868, Joseph and his brother brought William Ziegler and Jon H. Seal in as investors in 1873 and the Royal Baking Company was formed. Joseph took much pride in the success of his company noting that after sinking $500,000 a year into advertising, an enormous sum at that time, customers were willing to pay more for his product. He excelled at marketing, used logos like “absolutely” pure, was a hit with bakers and became one of the “kings” of the New York business world. (By the end of the 19th century, the brand was on six continents; it is still sold today.)\n\nConcomitant with their wealth in the baking powder business, the Hoagland brothers began purchasing real estate on Shelter Island for summer recreation and vacation homes. As per Patricia Shillingburg, the two men dominated civic life in the Shelter Island Grove and Camp Meeting Association of the Methodist Episcopal Church, also known as The Prospect. Shillingburg notes that Joseph became president of the board of that organization in 1881 and held that office until 1889. He owned a large yacht, the “Day Dream” and also the “Lagonda,” which welcomed the French vessel, the “Isere,” which brought the Statue of Liberty to New York Harbor in 1885. Hoagland later welcomed Auguste Bartholdi, the sculptor of the Statue at a huge party at the Hamilton Club in Brooklyn at the corner of Remsen and Clinton Streets. By 1886, the brothers had built substantial homes on a prime location overlooking Greenport Harbor, helped run the aforementioned association, and founded the Shelter Island Yacht Club that same year. In 1896, the two had sold their properties on Shelter Island and were no longer a presence there.\n\nApparently, there were business controversies related to the running of the Royal Baking Powder Company. After Seal, one of the original investors, died in 1886, Joseph Hoagland wanted to sever his ties with Ziegler and buy him out. Ultimately, after an acrimonious dispute, Ziegler, who sued Joseph Hoagland for unfair business practices, won his case on appeal in 1889. At the same time, Cornelius and Joseph were quarreling and Cornelius bought the Cleveland Baking Powder Company in 1887, became its president and moved its factory from Albany to Brooklyn where he managed it successfully.\n\nBy 1895, Joseph was the sole owner of the Royal Baker Powder Company with a trademark valued at $10,000,000. He was also president of the New York Tartar Company, whose baking product was related to his brand. He belonged to the Chamber of Commerce, Holland Society, Down Town and Hamilton Clubs as well as the Atlantic and New York Yacht Clubs. In addition to his Brooklyn residence, he had a summer residence, “the Auldwood,” on the Shrewsbury River in Sea Bright, New Jersey. He died in Manhattan. Hoagland’s death was attributed to kidney failure. Section 80, lot 17341.\n\nHOAGLAND (or HOOGLAND), WILLIAM H. (1832-1862). Captain, 12th New York Infantry, Company D; second lieutenant, 12th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company A. Originally interred at Green-Wood, Hoagland’s remains were removed from the cemetery on June 2, 1863. A native New Yorker, he enrolled there on April 19, 1861, to serve for three months and mustered into Company A of the 12th New York State Militia on May 2 as a “second second lieutenant.” Also borne on the rolls as William H. Hoogland, he was promoted to second lieutenant on June 5, (although another document indicates that this promotion was to first lieutenant), and mustered out with his company at New York City on August 5. Hoagland re-enlisted at New York City as a captain on November 19, 1861, and mustered in on January 20, 1862, to serve for three years. He was commissioned as captain of the Company D of the 12th New York Infantry on February 27, with rank from February 3, and was killed in action at Fredericksburg, Virginia, on December 13, 1862. Interment at Green-Wood was on December 26, 1862.\n\nHODGE (or HODGES), WILLIAM ALEXANDER (1837-1885). Private, 84th New York (14th Brooklyn) Infantry, Company I; 1st Division, 1st Army Headquarters; ordnance clerk, 5th Army Corps; 5th New York Veterans Infantry, Company G. Hodge was born in Ireland. At the time of the 1855 New York State census, he lived in Brooklyn with his parents and siblings, all of whom were Irish-born and who immigrated to the United States in 1844. Craig Heberton IV researched Hodge’s life, career as a photographer, and Civil War service; his report was published in December 2022, as the cover story in Battlefield Photographer, the Journal of the Center for Civil War Photography (Volume XX, Issue 3), in an article entitled, “William A. Hodge: The Man in the Tam o’Shanter.” The piece shed light on Hodge’s previously unknown work during the Civil War. The details of Hodge’s experiences, as related by Heberton, form the basis of this biography.\n\nHeberton notes that Hodge was listed as a “daguerreotypist” in the 1857-1858 Brooklyn Directory. (Dauguerrotypes were the first successful commercial photography images.) As per the 1858-1859 New York City Directory, he was a camera operator working at 233 Broadway Avenue with the prominent Meade Brothers. At the time of the 1860 census, he was in the daguerrotype industry.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Hodge enlisted as a private at Brooklyn on June 30, 1861, and mustered into Company I of the 84th New York, familiarly known as the 14th Brooklyn, on August 1. He was detailed to the non-combat Labor Corps on September 1. On November 18, 1861, he was detailed to the Balloon Corps, was on furlough as of January 28, 1862, when his father, an undertaker, fractured his arm, and returned to the corps in the spring after he extended his 14-day absence. On June 26, 1862, when Hodge’s father was living in New Jersey, a state official wrote to Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, the head of the Balloon Corps, stating that William was being paid 40 cents a day while others who had the same skills were reimbursed $3.20 to $5 per day, and that his father and sisters were somewhat dependent on him. Hodge was described as one of three mechanics in the Balloon Corps on January 1, 1863.\n\nAs per Heberton, Hodge was recommended for the Balloon Corps by his superiors because of his artistic ability and photography skills, making him capable of making maps of the surrounding terrain and enemy positions, an important function of the corps. Maps created through aerial surveillance were distributed to staff officers and commanders as troops approached Richmond and near Yorktown, on the Chickahominy River. Heberton postulates that through Hodge’s map-making aptitude, he came in contact with assistants of the renowned Civil War photographer, Matthew Brady. Heberton also connects a photo of Hodge owned by his great-great granddaughter showing Hodge with deep-set eyes, bushy brows, a cleft chin, long thin nose and small ears covered with poufy hair, to a musket-toting assistant accompanying Brady’s assistants in Manassas, Virginia, in March 1862, the same time the 14th was in the area. Hodge was on the muster rolls of the Balloon Corps in April, May and June of 1863, when he was stationed in Washington, D.C. He returned to the 14th Brooklyn in the summer of 1863.\n\nAs per Heberton, a photo, which is the highlight of the article, including and identifying Hodge wearing a tam, was taken at a photographer’s camp of the Army of the Potomac in October 1862, shortly after the Battle of Antietam. That photo was taken in Berlin (now Brunswick), Maryland. A handwritten notation on the half-stereo albumen print which identifies him as “Hodges” also identifies Matthew Brady, three other photography assistants and two African Americans, a cook and a teamster. The photo also shows photographic equipment and materials. That image is now housed at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery. As per Heberton, the Balloon Corps arrived near Antietam four days after that battle. This would place Hodge near the site where Brady was photographed with him, as cited above. Heberton and his assistant searched genealogical information, and confirmed Hodge’s identity through his great-great granddaughter, Edith Smith, who had other photos of her ancestor.\n\nHeberton notes that he found 12 photos, mostly from 1862, showing Hodge with Brady’s photographers. He also includes photos in the article that Smith possesses. In one photo in his article, Hodge is sitting on a box of photographic plates with a notation on the back written by Smith’s great-great grandmother, “Your father & his work/cook [?] near the Potomac 1863.” Smith’s grandmother added in red ink, “Civil War photographer.” In addition, Heberton emphasizes the connection between photography and balloon reconnaissance at the time of the photos.\n\nWhen the Balloon Corps was disbanded in 1863 after Major General George McClellan was removed from command, Hodge was detailed on September 5, 1863, to the 1st Division, 1st Army Headquarters until his transfer to the Ordnance Department 5th Army Corps on April 30, 1864, where he served as an ordnance clerk. He then was transferred to Company G of the 5th New York Veterans, on June 2, 1864, until his honorable discharge on July 2, 1864. Heberton indicates that the Army’s register of approved sutlers and other civilians for 1865 names Hodge as the photographic assistant to C. Glenn, the official photographer of the 2nd Division of the 5th Army.\n\nHodge returned to studio work after the war. His marriage certificate of January 3, 1867, reports that he was an “artist” residing in New York City. The 1870 census notes that Hodge was living in Brooklyn with his wife and young daughter. At that time, he was employed as a photographer; the couple subsequently had a son. He was also listed as a photographer in the 1872 Brooklyn Directory working at 363 Broadway Avenue with Abraham Bogardus. Subsequently, Hodge was listed in the 1875 and 1879 Brooklyn Directories; the latter directory shows a home address at 116 Hoyt Street. Heberton notes that Hodge was listed in the 1880 Easton, Pennsylvania Directory with his wife incorrectly identified as deceased.\n\nHodge died of consumption at the House of Rest in New York City. As per Heberton, Annie E. Hodge applied for a widow’s pension on November 17, 1891, attaching a death certificate and stating that he suffered his first pulmonary attack two years before his death. Heberton adds that Annie supported her application with other documents that showed that her husband continued to serve in the 14th New York State National Guard until his discharge on July 11, 1873 and had been elected treasurer of Company I as per the January 1, 1870 Brooklyn Daily Eagle.

He had a tattoo, “G.S.W.,” on his left bicep. In 1863, he suffered a hernia when, while on patrol in North Carolina, he and his horse fell at least 15 feet off a rise. Hodgson mustered out on June 12, 1865, at Richmond, Virginia. In 1891, he applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 988,373. He resided at 1060 Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan, but spent the end of his life in the Home for Old Men and Aged Couples in Manhattan where he died of a homorrhage.

(1837-1889). Second assistant engineer, United States Navy. Hodgson was born in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. During the Civil War, Hodgson enlisted in the United States Navy on December 9, 1861, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was appointed to the rank of third assistant engineer that day and ordered to the USS Oneida on January 7, 1862. During his duty, the USS Oneida participated in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron under Admiral David Farragut. On April 24, 1862, the ship joined in the attacks on Forts Jackson and St. Philip below New Orleans, Louisiana, drove off the Confederate ram that sank the USS Varuna, and destroyed the CSS Governor Moore. During the ensuing Vicksburg Campaign, Hodgson was injured in the left calf by a shell at Vicksburg, Mississippi, on June 28, 1862, and then transported to Cairo, Illinois. The medical report indicated a line of duty injury noting an extensive lacerated wound to the integument (skin and underlying areas) of the calf when he was struck by a piece of shell. Hodgson was a patient at Moline City Hospital (Illinois) from July 7, 1862, until September 1, 1862; he was on crutches until April 1863. He was promoted to second assistant engineer on September 8, 1863, and assigned to the USS Shenandoah on May 28, 1863. On August 10, 1863, he was detached from the Shenandoah on recommendation of the Medical Department because he was not fit “for active duty at sea.” Subsequently, he was assigned to the USS Pembina on October 6, 1863. He tendered his resignation on January 6, 1866, at Washington, D.C. His resignation was officially accepted on December 21, 1868.\n\nHodgson applied for and received a pension from the Navy, certificate, 1,102, as of February 19, 1868, retroactive to January 6, 1866, at the rate of $6.66 per month, noting a shell wound to the left leg. The Surgeon’s Report of May 28, 1870, stated that there was tissue damage, impaired muscular action, and locomotor damage that is “one half and permanent.” At that time, he was 5′ 8½” tall and 170 pounds. On January 24, 1876, he wrote in an affidavit to the Pension Bureau claiming that he was entitled to an increase because he could not pursue his profession as a land surveyor because of his disability. Hodgson attested that he could not put his left heel on the ground without great pain and could not stand or walk for a long time without great pain. His pension was increased $4.00 per month in June 1888. His death certificate indicates the cause of death as mania a potu (madness from drinking). His last residence was 31 Washington Street in Hoboken, New Jersey. Fannie Hodgson, his wife, eventually received a widow’s pension from the Navy, certificate 5467, after her first claim in 1890 was rejected because her husband died of a disease not due to his military service. General William Tecumseh Sherman wrote a letter to the Pension Bureau asking that Fannie Hodgson’s claim should be investigated to see whether she had remarried or been without means of support after her husband’s death. A Navy comrade testified in an affidavit that Hodgson’s calf injury left him permanently disabled. Section 67, lot 1812.\n\nHOE, WILLIAM ALBERT (1841-1912).

His enlistment record and the 1870 census hint to a birth year circa 1843; however the censuses of 1850 and 1860 which show him living with his parents in Niskayuna in Schenectady, New York, where his father was a farmer, indicate that he was born in 1846 or 1848, and his online family tree notes 1844.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Hogan enlisted as a private at New York City on April 25, 1861, and mustered into Company G of the 5th New York on May 9. His muster roll notes that he was paid $6.84 from April 25 through May 14, 1861. A volunteer fireman before the war, he was sent with wagons from Savage’s Station, Virginia, on June 28, 1862. He was listed as missing at Manassas, Virginia (Bull Run) on August 30, 1862, where the 5th was heavily engaged, and returned to the regiment in September 3. He was detailed to the Pioneer Corps (an engineer unit) in November 1862 and mustered out with his company on May 14, 1863.\n\nAlfred Davenport, who wrote “Camp and Field Life of the Fifth New York Volunteer Infantry, collected the newspaper announcement of Hogan’s death (which specified his late residence as 42 Gouverneur Street, New York, matching both the date of death and the address of the man interred at Green-Wood) and noted that, though quiet and modest, Hogan was one of only eight men in the regiment who carried a musket and was present at every fight that it took part in. He further noted that Hogan never spent a day in a hospital during his service.\n\nAs per Hogan’s online family tree, he married Mary Ann McKinley in New York City on December 21, 1864; they had six children. That document notes that the couple lived with his folks in Schenectady, New York, in 1865 before moving to New York City by 1870. As per the 1870 census, Hogan was 27 years old, lived with his wife and two children in New York City and worked as an engine driver. The 1875 New York State census reports that he lived with his wife and children in Brooklyn. The 1880 census reports that he lived at 42 Gouverneur Street in New York City, his last address. He was an engineer who was married with children. As per Green-Wood Cemetery records, his death was attributed to meningitis; however, his cause of death is recorded as cholera in the New York Episcopal Church Records for 1881-1882. Section 17, lot 17245, grave 312.\n\nHOGAN, TIMOTHY (1835-1899). Contractor, Confederate States of America. Originally from Liverpool, England, Hogan immigrated to the United States on or about August 21, 1848. He was a sailor from the age of thirteen, was a seaman on the Dreadnaught, then was a ship’s captain of the Black Ball liners until 1856 when he became a stevedore in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1858, he established the firm of Brown & Hogan there. During the Civil War, he contracted with the Confederate States of America to fortify New Orleans; he was building earthworks there when Admiral and Flag Officer David Farragut captured the city on April 20, 1862.\n\nAfter spending time in Quebec, Hogan came to New York in August 1863, as per his naturalization papers. In 1872, he established Pinder & Hogan, a major stevedoring company in New York City, then ventured into building large steamships. He established the first steamship line to San Francisco, California, with the Conemaugh, Mineola and Montauk, and had an interest in ships traveling to Calcutta, India. The 1880 census reports that he was living in Brooklyn and working as a stevedore. On February 28, 1899, he became a naturalized citizen. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he headed T. Hogan & Sons on Bowling Green in Manhattan at the time of his death. His interests extended into the ship brokerage business and shipping properties. Although one obituary printed the rumor that he lost $250,000 in his interest in the Monarch Line, his losses were actually $40,000. Among Hogan’s many business ventures were the Lone Star Line, three vessels that traveled to Galveston, Texas; the Menantic Steamship Line, Limited, in Avonsmouth, England; and a joint partnership with Sanderson & Son and other firms in Liverpool for freight and cable lines. The Hogan family sold the CSS Merrimac to the United States government at the beginning of the Spanish-American War; the ship, a collier (coal supply vessel), was exploded and sunk by Naval Constructor Richmond Hobson in Santiago Harbor, Cuba, in a failed attempt to block the harbor.\n\nA vice president of the Produce Exchange, he was at one time a director of the Maritime Exchange. Hogan was on the board of the directors of the Cuban and Pan-American Express Company, the Brooklyn Bank, and on the board of managers of the Sheltering Arms Nursery. In addition, he was a member of the Atlantic and Larchmont Yacht Clubs, the Marine and Field Clubs, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the last year of his life, Hogan sold two of the vessels of the Lone Star Line, the Matteawan and the Miami to a California line after engaging in a rate war with the rival Mallory Line. He was a member of St. Matthew’s Protestant Episcopal Church. A millionaire, he last lived at 131 West 86th Street in Manhattan where his funeral was held. He died suddenly of cardiac arrest while coming home on a train after vacationing at Loon Lake in the Adirondack Mountains. Section 176, lot 21797.\n\nHOGG, DAVID (1822-1875). Captain, 42nd New York Infantry, Company I. Born in England, Hogg enlisted on June 22, 1861, at Long Island, New York, and was commissioned into the 42nd New York, also known as the Tammany Regiment, that day. On November 4, 1861, Lieutenant Colonel James J. Mooney, the commanding officer, wrote from Poolesville, Maryland, about the Battle of Ball’s Bluff, Virginia, on October 21. He noted in his field report that Hogg took command in “… taking care of and conveying the wounded to the hospital, and in standing in the intrenchments (sic) as a guard under a heavy and incessant fire from the enemy. Notwithstanding the inclement wind and storm that prevailed during the night, the men performed the disagreeable task assigned them without a murmur…” He was discharged on August 28, 1862, as per Special Order No. 77. At some point, Hogg was honored by his friend, John Morrissey, Esq., with a presentation sword, sash, belt, sword knot and shoulder braces at the Louisiana Hotel on Houston Street. Many of Hogg’s friends attended the ceremony in which Captain Hogg responded to the tributes made to him. In 1868, his application for an invalid pension was granted, certificate 95,578.\n\nAs per the census of 1870, Hogg was working as a clerk. He last lived at 272 Seventh Street, Manhattan. His obituary notes that he died after a painful illness. In 1876, Marietta Hogg, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension, certificate 174,653. According to a descendant, he is buried in the lot next to his good friend and comrade, Colonel William A. Lynch (see) of the 42nd New York. Section 2, lot 7516.\n\nHOGG, THOMAS (1820-1892).

Section 80, lot 4936.\n\nHOHORST, LOUIS (1844-1879). Corporal, 173rd New York Infantry, Company A. Of German birth, Hohorst immigrated to the United States, leaving from Bremen, Germany, aboard the passenger ship Orpheus, and arriving in New York City on August 23, 1856. During the Civil War, he enlisted at Brooklyn on September 19, 1862, as a private, and mustered into the 173rd New York on October 30. As per his muster roll, which incorrectly states that he was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Hohorst was a baker who was 5′ 6″ tall with brown eyes, light hair and a light complexion. On May 1, 1865, he was promoted to corporal. He mustered out on October 18, 1865, at Savannah, Georgia. He last resided at 248 Hamilton Avenue, Brooklyn. According to his obituary, he died several days after he sustained injuries at the Pierrepont stores when a heavy bale of goods fell and struck him on his back. Annie M. Hohorst, who is interred with him, received a widow’s pension in 1890, certificate 333,787. Section F, lot 18293.\n\nHOLBERTON, WAKEMAN (1839-1898). First lieutenant, 72nd New York Infantry, Company C. Holberton, who was born in New York City, was educated there and in Europe. According to a biography of Holberton in Trout Fishing in the Catskills by Ed Van Put (2014), he learned the sport of fly fishing around 1860 and developed a passion for that sport. During the Civil War, he enlisted at New York City as a second lieutenant on September 1, 1861, and was commissioned into the 72nd New York the same day. At some point, he was promoted to first lieutenant of his company before he was discharged on June 13, 1862. His obituary in The New York Times, which confirms his Civil War service, reports that he fought as a member of Sickles Brigade. He was also borne on the rolls as Huffman.\n\nVan Put’s biography states that at the close of the War, Holberton became involved with the fishing tackle business and was the proprietor of the Sportsmen’s Emporium on Nassau Street in Manhattan. He was also a representative for the famous McBride flies used in fly-fishing. Because of his fame as a knowledgeable fly-fisher, he was patronized by the best anglers in the country. In addition, he took up the pursuit of sketching and painting fishing and hunting subjects. He honed his craft by living in the woods and at the seashore and inland river banks for weeks at a time. Considered an expert on the Catskills, the Adirondacks and the Yellowstone region of the West, he wrote articles for Forest and Stream, often using the pen name of Scarlet Ibis, about catching bass with flies. A sportsman, he was a member of several clubs including the New York Association for the Protection of Game and the Neversink Club, a trout-fishing club in the Catskills of which he was the secretary-treasurer. (The Neversink Club restricted its members to catching 25 fish per day with a size limit of 7 inches.) Holberton advocated making a standard system for naming flies because anglers did not know the names of the fly or flies they had success with; each similarly-named fly was tied differently, leading to confusion. He invented a style of tying flies that was patented as the “Fluttering Fly,” because it was tied in the opposite direction of standard flies. In 1882, he produced a chart showing a hand-painted brook trout surrounded by a border of sixty-four fly patterns, each given a name and titled, Standard American Trout Flies. He later produced a similar chart with a set of forty flies titled Standard American Black Bass and Lake Flies. In 1887, he wrote The Art of Angling. He went to Newfoundland and Labrador to hunt caribou and fished in every famous stream and lake in America, becoming renowned as a fly-caster.\n\nAlso an artist, Holberton painted trout, birds, and lakes and rivers. His interest in protecting the wilderness of the Adirondack Mountains from encroaching business led him to write to The New York Times in 1889, “…I see the folly of allowing the destruction of that magnificent country which supplies so many of our rivers and furnishes sport and recreation for thousands.” Holberton also advised anglers, “Do not catch or kill more fish or game than you can use; do not keep fingerlings, or fish for numbers, or descend to poaching in any shape; treat farmers civilly, and respect their rights; by so doing, you will find that your angling trips will be a joy forever.” The New York Times praised his work, Recollections of an Angler, a personal account for his family containing 101 pages of one season’s fishing trip in New York, Pennsylvania and Yellowstone including articles, five full page watercolors and 48 smaller watercolors, and 130 pen and ink sketches. His major essay, “That Big Trout,” appeared in Outing Magazine in June 1893, detailed a fishing trip along the Lycoming River near Ralston, Pennsylvania. That piece described roasting trout on buttered paper, wrapped in wet newspaper and nested in the hot coals of a “dry wood’ fire and reaching the ultimate prize: catching the big trout that was “king of the waters.” The excerpt below details his big catch:\n\n…The law at that time forbade trout-fishing after August fifteenth. One dark, showery afternoon, a few days before the close of the season, I started out to try for a few trout, which I needed as models to finish a picture I was painting. Among other favorite spots, I visited the pool under the railroad bridge. After considerable hard work I managed to secure half a dozen fair specimens, and was about turning back, when I thought, as it was dark under the mountains, I would try one cast more with a bright fly; so I selected a No. 8 white winged coachman and a fresh leader, and tried it once more. Just below me a newly fallen tree laid close over the water, and a lucky cast dropped the coachman well under the branches. There was a sob and a big bell in the water. I struck sharply, and thought to myself, “I’ve got him!” I felt it at once, and knew that I was fast to that big trout. Slowly and grandly he sailed up-stream, fortunately without the other flies hooking to the fallen tree. What a monster he looked, with his dorsal fin cutting through the water! He seemed too dignified to show much fight, but pulled strongly, and I was afraid to put too much strain on him. For fifteen minutes (and it seemed like an hour) he kept me on the anxious-seat, but at last I got the landing net under him and the big trout was mine. I had my boy with me, carrying a pail, so I plumped him in and hurried back to the hotel, where I put him in a big washtub under the spring. Here he lived for some time, the wonder of the village, and so at last I had caught the big trout I had been hoping for for years. He was seventeen inches long, and weighed two pounds plump—a royal fish for a mountain stream, though not equal to a Rangeley monster. Still, I have yet to catch a larger one, and I have been trout-fishing for many years.\n\nOther articles by Holberton appeared in Harper’s Weekly and the American Angler. In 1895, he applied for an invalid pension that was granted under certificate 931,251. According to his obituary in The New York Times, Holberton was a near invalid the last four years of his life after becoming paralyzed in his left side and arm caused by exposure during a winter caribou hunt in Newfoundland. His last residence was in Hackensack, New Jersey. Holberton’s funeral took place at the Christ Church of Hackensack. The cause of his death was apoplexy. Sarah Holberton received a widow’s pension shortly after his death in 1898, certificate 535,976. The pair of oil paintings, below, painted by Holberton in 1871, sold at auction in 2013 for $3,750.
