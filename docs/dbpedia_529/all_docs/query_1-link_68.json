        "text": "2024 Recipient\n\nMichael Sinkus '74, M'76, P'90\n\nMichael Sinkus '74, M'76, P'90 says he remembers feeling \"academically and socially unprepared\" as a first-year student when he arrived at Bucknell. His time on campus — made possible through assistance from an anonymous donor — helped nurture and expand his appreciation of culture, opening him up to the vast and diverse world around him. This combination of support and education instilled in Sinkus a lifelong mission: to extend similar opportunities to as many young individuals as possible. He has dedicated himself to serving impactful world-changing institutions in the non-profit sector.\n\nAfter receiving his bachelor's and master's degrees from Bucknell, Sinkus broadened his experience at Yale University before joining the fundraising firm Marts & Lundy in 1978. Founded by previous Bucknell President Arnaud Marts, Sinkus credits his Bucknell connection for the kick-start to his consulting career. Over the course of his 45 years at the firm, Sinkus served many different roles within the company, including CEO and Chair of the Board. He earned recognition as a disruptor and pioneering force in the fundraising space, setting a new standard by implementing analytics throughout the field. In addition, he used his expertise in higher education to advocate for financial aid, the liberal arts, and critical thinking. His impact extended through the numerous clients he generously aided in contributing their resources to the causes they valued.\n\nSinkus routinely engages with other alumni and friends of the University to encourage them to give back to Bucknell. He has served on the Bison Board for Athletics, the Bucknell Alumni Association (including the executive committee), multiple Reunion committees, and is a member of both the William Bucknell Society and the Bertrand Society.\n\nSinkus credits his success to his many Bucknell role models and mentors who inspired him throughout his life and career, including President Charles Watts, Vice President Ronald \"Pete\" Pedrick, Professor Ralph Rees, Dean Robert Chambers, Golf Coach Brad Tufts, and President John Bravman. He also credits many loyal classmates, and is honored to receive this award in celebration of their 50th Reunion."
