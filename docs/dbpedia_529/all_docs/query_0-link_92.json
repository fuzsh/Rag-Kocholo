        "text": "Details\n\nParent Category: Incident Alert Archives\n\nCategory: Electrical Accidents\n\nPublished: 03 September 2010\n\nElectrical Accidents #8\n\nThis page was last updated on 05/06/2010\n\nOIL FIELD WORKER KILLED IN ELECTRICAL ACCIDENT\n\nSTAFF August 21, 2003\n\nKILGORE - An industrial accident claimed the life of a 22-year-old man Wednesday when a power line came in contact with a piece of oil field equipment on which he was working. Rusk County Sheriff Department officials said Juan Martin Jimenez was killed when the oil derrick he was working on raised up and touched an overhead electrical power line. Jimenez was working for Signal Well Service Inc., on a oil lease property off Farm-to-Market Road 2012 a few miles south of Kilgore. RCSD officials said Jimenez was transported to Laird Memorial Hospital where he was pronounced dead by B.H. Jameson, Gregg County justice of peace. James Dacus, Signal Well Service general manager, said Jimenez was an employee of the company for a year and a half. \"We are just crushed by this. He was a excellent employee and a great person. It is hard, but we went to work today to deal with it the way we know how,\" he said. Dacus said Jimenez's funeral expenses and the cost for transportation of his body to Mexico would be paid for by the company. \"We talk about safety everyday and sometimes you get complacent. This was no one person's fault, but an unfortunate accident we wish we could undo,\" he said. Jimenez is survived by his parents and family in Mexico and several cousins in the Kilgore area.\n\nElectric shock injures air station civilian\n\nPublished \"Saturday By CHRIS BENDER Gazette staff writer\n\nThe second serious electrical accident in a week at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort left a civilian contractor badly burned and in critical condition Thursday morning. Julio Martinez, 47, of Beaufort suffered burns to his hands and body while working on the air station's 2,400-volt runway lighting circuit. His co-workers had to perform CPR to keep him alive, said Arlene Mellinger, communications manager for Johnson Controls, the company Martinez worked for. Just one week before, Cpl. Erik S. Hultgren died from electrocution while testing a 1,000-watt floodlight set on a generator. A memorial service was held Wednesday at the base. Two of Martinez's co-workers nearby revived Martinez, a former Marine. He was taken to Beaufort Memorial Hospital then moved to Doctor's Hospital Burn Center in Augusta, Ga., one of the region's top burn centers. Mellinger said his vital signs were good and he was in critical but stable condition. Officials aren't sure what caused the shock, said air station spokesman Master Sgt. erence Peck, but the accident is being investigated. The incident occurred at about 8:15 a.m., he said, while Martinez, an electrician, was working on a part of the runway near U.S. 21. \"The other employees didn't actually see it happen,\" Mellinger said. \"(Martinez) is the only one who actually knows and we haven't been able to talk to him yet.\" The employees who revived Martinez had recently undergone CPR training, Mellinger said. \"We always make sure our employees have the proper safety training É and (CPR) is part of it,\" Mellinger said. \"His co-workers probably saved his life.\" Mellinger said Martinez's condition was being monitored. Johnson Controls has contracted with the air station for the past five months, working on operations and maintenance, Mellinger said. Part of the contract includes working on the electricity and heating plant. Peck said there are 500 civilian employees on the base. Johnson Controls has 47 employees on the base, Mellinger said.\n\nMen Die Trying To Rescue Coworker; Crane Came In Contact With Wire\n\nA man was electrocuted and two co-workers died trying to save him Thursday when a crane struck an overhead power line at a concrete plant and exploded. As electricity coursed through the rig, two men rushed to assist its driver, who had been hurled from his cab. One began administering CPR, but the rescue attempt went horribly awry when the second worker touched the still electrified crane, sending a deadly jolt through all three men, authorities said. \"He put his hand on his shoulder, and he steadied himself on the crane, and that's when they all got it,\" said Telford Borough Police Chief Douglas Bickel. Other rescuers, terrified that they too would be shocked and killed, then had to stand by until the live wire was shut off by a utility, said George Strickland, general manager of the JDM Materials plant in suburban Philadelphia where the accident took place. Late Thursday afternoon two of the victims were identified. The crane operator was Robert Forepaugh (pictured, left side of picture), 68, the owner of the demolition company that was subcontracted by JDM Materials. One of the other workers killed was Forepaugh's nephew, George Frederick (pictured, right side of picture), 41. \"It seemed like an eternity. I don't know how long it actually took,\" Strickland said. The 9:15 a.m. accident left the crane a smoking ruin. Hours after the disaster, a 7,200 volt electrical line remained draped over its boom. Strickland said the three worked for a Bensalem company that had been hired to demolish an old structure at the plant. Witnesses said the crane was backing up when it ran into the wires, Strickland said. Homes across from the construction site were evacuated so people would not enter the area around the electrocution because electricity goes into the ground. About 600 people were without power for about an hour. Power continues to be off at the plant, but is expected to be back Friday.\n\nMan hurt in electrical mishap\n\nBy JOANN LIVINGSTON Daily Light Managing Editor\n\nWaxahachie fire personnel responded to the scene of an electrocution at St. Gobain Containers late Tuesday morning. The call came in at 10:01 a.m., with engine No. 1 arriving at the scene in the 2400 block of N. Interstate 35 with East Texas EMS at 10:09, according to the reports. The nature of the call was to assist East Texas with a possible electrocution,” Assistant Fire Chief Randall Potter said. The affected individual was working with an outside contractor; information was unavailable on the nature of that work. “They were at the rear of the building up in a tower-type structure,” Potter said. “A workman – I don’t know how – touched or got into 440 volt electricity, and it electrocuted him.” Firefighters had to climb up into the tower through pipes to reach the man. “He was somewhat responsive and could answer a few questions,” Potter said. “Our units packaged him, placed him on a backboard and secured him and brought him down to where East Texas was up in the tower, waiting to give treatment.” The department’s ladder truck and rope gear were called out as firefighters assessed how to complete the removal of the man from the structure. Those were cancelled en route, however, when other workmen on the scene were able to get an elevator in the tower working again. The man was transported to Baylor Medical Center in Waxahachie by East Texas, with the fire department clearing at 10:28 a.m., according to the reports. The man’s name, age and residence were unavailable; he was employed by D G & G Electric out of Midlothian. A spokesman for St. Gobain said the worker was treated and released after about four hours at the hospital. The incident is under investigation, she said.\n\nLehighton men electrocuted while drilling well\n\nThe Associated Press 8/17/2003, 2:59 p.m. ET\n\nALBRIGHTSVILLE, Pa. (AP) — A well-drilling rig hit a high-voltage power line at a construction site, killing a father and son, authorities said. Martin Schafer, 49, and his 24-year-old son, Benjamin, died in the Friday evening accident at the Mount Pocahontas housing development, according to the Carbon County coroner's office. Their rig tilted on soft ground, causing it to hit the power line, police said. Colleagues said the hardworking pair were trying to finish a job after working all day. Last year, another man was electrocuted in Carbon County when he tried to pull his dog away from a power line that fell to the ground in Hickory Run State Park.\n\nWe Energies employee electrocuted\n\nBy Last Updated: Aug. 14, 2003\n\nA We Energies employee was electrocuted Thursday while installing a utility pole in Franklin, authorities said. The accident was reported shortly after 2 p.m. in the 9400 block of W. Oakwood Road, a statement from the Franklin Police Department said, after the victim, a 38-year-old man from Muskego, and two other workers had just set the pole into the ground. As the crew was lowering the boom on a utility truck, the boom touched a live wire, causing electrical current to run through the boom, the truck and a piece of equipment that was connected to the truck and which the victim was holding, the statement said. Police did not release the man's name. We Energies spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said late Thursday she had no information on the accident, which is under investigation by the utility, the Franklin Police Department, the Milwaukee County medical examiner's office and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. \"This is a very tragic situation for the employee and the employee's family, and we extend our deepest sympathy,\" McCarthy said.\n\nUPDATE AGL fined $100,000 over electrocution\n\nEnergy retailer AGL Electricity was fined $100,000 for safety breaches which led to the electrocution of a 36-year-old Melbourne carpenter. Paul Psaila received a fatal electric shock when he touched a piece of metal carrying a 240-volt current from a live electricity cable attached to the garage roof of a suburban Rosanna home unit on February 9, 1999. But outside the court, the victim's widow, mother of three daughters Marie Psaila, said she thought the punishment \"grossly inadequate, given that what happened cost my darling Paul his life\". But she said even if the firm had been fined the maximum of $250,000, it still would not be enough. \"There is no adequate (monetary) penalty for a company like AGL -- the true punishment is in the conviction.\" She said her youngest daughter, the then four-year-old Madeleine, who witnessed the accident needed psychotherapy treatment for two years and suffered from post traumatic stress disorder. Judge Michael Strong in the Victorian County Court said work on installing the cable had been carried out by two qualified and experienced linesmen seven weeks before Mr Psaila died. \"On this occasion the job was done incompetently,\" the judge said. Insulation on the cable became damaged and a metal bracket \"charged with electricity became a death trap\". Mr Psaila died when he touched the bracket. The judge said the two linesmen, who were not charged with any offence, were men of experience and their work involved, or should have involved, checking the connection. There was a need for electricity suppliers to realise that linesmen, however competent and experienced, will occasionally make mistakes with potentially lethal consequences, Justice Strong said. It was clear that what was lacking was an independent system of inspection, the judge said. \"The court must respond to the jury's verdict by sending a clear message to this industry that more rigorous scrutiny is required of work by linesmen,\" he said. AGL was last week convicted by a jury of failing to ensure that people other than its employees were not exposed to health and safety risks. The maximum fine for the offence is $250,000. The judge said it would be wrong to impose the maximum sentence because the breaches were not \"blatant\". After the sentencing, WorkSafe Victoria executive director John Merritt said: \"This case supports WorkSafe's proposition that it is practicable to have a system for auditing and inspecting the installation of power cables and that doing these things can save lives.\" \"Our concern is that this is a real public safety issue. In this case, the actions of AGL Electricity put others at risk and resulted in a man dying.\" A spokeswoman for AGL said the company had no comment to make on the sentencing remarks made by the judge.\n\nIvy Tech Construction Worker Injured\n\nWeb Producer: Kerry Corum\n\nA construction worker was hurt after cutting through a live electrical wire at Evansville's Ivy Tech State college. The unidentified worker was taken to the hospital for observation. He works for a Michigan company, and company officials say the injuries are not life threatening. Authorities were told, the man was cutting through wiring in the ceiling of a building that's being rennovated, when the accident occured.\n\nUPDATE Pearland worker killed while atop power lines\n\nBy: PATRICK REYNOLDS, Journal Staff August 13, 2003\n\nAn investigation continues this week into a power-line accident that took the life of a Pearland man a week ago in Webster. Nicholas Garland, 22, a North Houston Pole Co. employee, was performing routine maintenance on a high voltage line near NASA Road 1 and Sarah Deel about 9:30 a.m., Aug. 6, when he was shocked with about 130,000 volts of electricity, Webster fire officials said. The electric charge knocked Garland unconscious. Fire officials said the accident occurred about 75 feet in the air. His co-workers tried to help him until firefighters arrived. \"The crew from the North Houston Pole Line Company did CPR up in the air on the high wire for approximately 20 minutes before he was brought down by a bucket truck,\" said Lt. Eddie Havlice with the Webster Fire Department. He was then transported by Life Flight helicopter to Memorial Hermann Hospital. Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials said they are not sure why Garland was electrocuted and are conducting an investigation into the incident. \"The line was supposed to be dead and apparently it was not,\" Havlice said. WFD requested assistance from the Houston and Forest Bend fire departments when bringing him down from the power pole. Garland is survived by his mother Aida Garland; father Joe Garland, wife Geri; brothers, Nathan Garland and wife Michelle, Joe Garland III and wife Samantha; and nieces and nephews. Visitation was held Friday from 5 p.m. to 9 at Corl's Family Funeral Home, 2422 Broadway in Pearland. Funeral services took place Saturday at 10 a.m. in the funeral home chapel.\n\nUPDATE State agency finds electrocution, fire could have been prevented\n\nAugust 11, 2003\n\nAn electrocution that killed a man working at a western Pennsylvania mine and a fire that burned and smoldered for several weeks inside another mine could have been prevented, the state Department of Environmental Protection said in final reports released Monday. Christopher St. Clair, 41, of Lisbon, Ohio, was electrocuted June 13 while changing fuses at Mountain Spring Coal Co.'s Mine No. 1 in Shippingport, about 35 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, state police said. Investigators found that the coal company had modified the mine's power substation without the state agency's approval, causing an unsafe working environment, the report said. Also, the investigation found that mine electrician Numan Lambert and mine foreman and superintendent David Chambers allowed St. Clair to work in an unsafe situation, according to the report. The agency ruled that Lambert and Chas cannot hold their positions in the state for at least a year, when they can reapply. Chambers said his attorney advised him to not comment on the report. Mine officials and all employees, including Lambert, were advised to not comment, he said. A second DEP investigation found that frictional heat generated by an improperly maintained coal belt likely started a fire that was discovered Jan. 6 in the Consol Energy's Mine 84, about 25 miles south of Pittsburgh, the agency said. The fire, which burned for about a week and smoldered into February, started in a tunnel used to move miners and machinery along a two-mile block of coal. More than 80 miners were alerted to the fire by carbon monoxide sensors and escaped without injury. Mine officials should have detected that the belt was faulty, the report said. The agency asked Consol to improve its firefighting and inspection techniques before it could reopen the mine. Joe Cerenzia, a spokesman for Consol, said the company disputed the report but declined further comment, citing a possible appeal.\n\nMan in critical condition after rescue from electrical tower\n\nUpdated: 8/6/2003 9:57:43 AM By: News 24 Houston web staff\n\nA contract worker in Webster is in critical condition today after being shocked by a power line he was working on. The man, who is an apprentice with the North Houston Pole Company, was performing general maintenance on a power line on NASA Rd. 1. The line was supposed to be dead, but turned out to be a hot power line, officials said. \"This morning at approximately 9:30, we responded to an electrical shock. An apprentice from the North Houston Pole Company was working on a high line. The line was supposed to be dead and grounded -- apparently it was not. The apprentice touched the tower and the wire and was shocked,\" said Lt. Eddie Havlice with the Webster Fire Department. \"We don't know how much he was shocked with. The line carries approximately 138,000 volts. The crew from the North Houston Pole Company did CPR up in the air, on the high wire, for approximately 20 minutes before he was brought down by a bucket truck. The fire department continued CPR and loaded him into life flight helicopter and was transported to [Memorial] Hermann Hospital in critical condition.\" The victim's name has not yet been released.\n\nWorker electrocuted while renovating Casselberry movie theater\n\nCASSELBERRY, Fla. A construction worker helping renovate a movie theater was electrocuted Tuesday.\n\nThe worker was rushed to Florida Hospital in Altamonte Springs shortly after the 1 p.m. accident, said Lt. Dennis Stewart, a Casselberry Police Department spokesman. The worker's name was not released. Moments after the accident, a co-worker rushed next door to the Seminole County sheriff's district 5 office looking for help, said Steve Olson, a sheriff's office spokesman. A sheriff's investigator and a sergeant responded, Olson said. \"They didn't do CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) because he was breathing and had a pulse,\" Olson said. \"They were trying to talk to him, but he wasn't responding.\" Casselberry police and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration will investigate the incident, Stewart said.\n\n2 workers hurt in electrical accident in Coventry\n\n08/04/2003 Journal and projo.com staff Posted 11:56 a.m.\n\nCOVENTRY -- Two men were injured this morning while working on high-voltage electric lines, officials said. The men were upgrading electric service on Hopkins Hill Road for an Amgen plant under construction. They were moving 7,200-volt electric lines onto new utility poles. They work for Hawkeye Construction of Patchogue, N.Y., which was hired as a subcontractor by Narragansett Electric. They had been working in the area for about six months. Today was supposed to be their last day on the job. Details of the 9:35 a.m. accident are unclear, but one of the men apparently suffered first- and second-degree burns on his face, neck and arms, the Coventry police said. He was taken by ambulance to Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. Another worker was taken to Kent County Hospital in Warwick. He apparently was not burned but was shaken up by the accident, which apparently involved a flash of fire. Their names were not available. It is the second serious accident involving high-voltage power lines in less than a week. On Tuesday in West Warwick, two workers were killed and a third was injured when aluminum scaffolding they were carrying came into contact with a 7,200-volt power line. Electric customers in the area today lost power for about a half hour. The accident is being investigated by the Coventry Police Department, the Hopkins Hill Fire District, OSHA and Narragansett Electric. -- With reports from Journal staff writer Meaghan Wims\n\nWorker Apparently Electrocuted Near Power Pole; Helicopter Transports Victim To ORMC\n\nA man was rushed to Orlando Regional Medical Center Monday after being electrocuted while working near a power pole. The patient was flown to the hospital with burns over nearly half of his body, WESH NewsChannel 2 reported. He was working on a roof at Russell Aluminum in Sanford Monday morning.

It touched the bare, copper wire, which is about 30 feet off the ground and runs parallel to the house. \"We are not putting blame on anyone,\" said police Lt. Albert A. Giusti Jr. \"They were hired to do a job, and, unfortunately, this accident occurred.\" The men had a permit to do roofing and siding work on the three-family home at 22-26 Pleasant St. They had been working at the house for the past several weeks, according to neighbors. -- With reports from the Associated Press.\n\nUPDATE UI Employee Dies After Electrical Arcing; Shelton Man Dies At Bridgeport Hospital\n\nBRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- One of three United Illuminating Co. employees injured in an electrical accident earlier this month has died. David Bagdasarian, 49, of Shelton, died at Bridgeport Hospital Thursday. Bagdasarian had been burned after he and two other UI employees surveyed electrical equipment in an outdoor cage in a parking lot at Sikorsky Aircraft's factory on Main Street in Stratford. The three men were surveying the equipment in preparation for work they were to do that weekend when an electrical arcing occurred. Bagdasarian, who was a power deliver cable splicer, is the 10th UI worker to die from an on-the-job injury since 1966, said Kevin Moore, a spokesman for the New Haven-based utility. Two other UI employees also were injured in the explosion July 10. Neither hospital emergency nor UI officials have identified the men or commented on the extent of their injuries.\n\nMarysville man electrocuted on the job identified\n\nLAKE STEVENS -- The Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office has released the name of a man who died after being electrocuted at a work site Tuesday afternoon. William Ross, 51, was using a cable to guide a piece of steel to the ground at Concrete Nor'West in the 15400 block of 84th Street NE. The crane lifting the steel hit a high-voltage power line, according to Snohomish County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Jan Jorgensen. The Marysville man was taken to Providence Everett Medical Center, where he died a short time later. The medical examiner's office ruled the death an accident. The state Department of Labor and Industries will conduct a standard investigation to determine if the company failed to protect the worker's safety, said department spokeswoman Elaine Fischer. That investigation likely will take two to three months, she said.\n\nContractor electrocuted on top of light tower\n\nThe Associated Press 7/24/2003, 2:37 p.m. ET\n\nJOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) — A contractor who was replacing lights on top of a 90-foot baseball stadium light tower died of electrocution, authorities determined Thursday. John H. Lill, 72, died Wednesday at the historic Point Stadium in Johnstown, said Jim Zangaglia, Cambria County chief deputy coroner. The light standard carried 4,100 volts of electricity. \"I don't know how much went through him but there's that much juice that lights up that tower,\" Zangaglia said. Lill, retired city electrician, was replacing lights in preparation for a baseball tournament at the ballpark when he stopped responding to radio contact, Johnstown Recreation Director Cliff Kitner said. Firefighters climbed the steel tower and found Lill unconscious. He was pronounced dead less than an hour later. Because Lill worked for himself, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration won't be participating in the investigation, Zangaglia said. Information from: The Tribune-Democrat\n\nMiner killed in Raleigh County; sixth state fatality of year\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va.

The Portsmouth Fire Department and the state fire marshal are investigating the exact cause of the accident. The city’s electrical inspector and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration have been notified of the incident. The 49-year-old man, from Salem, was treated on the scene by paramedics and taken to Portsmouth Regional Hospital. In stable condition, he was later transported to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was treated for burns on his chest, neck and arms, according to Achilles. The man was working for TCI Electric Inc. An individual answering the telephone at TCI Electric Inc. declined to comment on the incident or identify the worker. Northeast Circuit City display technician Derek Bonzagni, 23, was the first to find the injured electrician. Bonzagni said the man was working on a circuit breaker in the electrical room to fix \"lighting issues\" at the store. He saw the lights flicker on and off and heard the buzzing of the current after the transformer exploded, he said. \"I’ve done electrical [work],\" said Bonzagni. \"I knew what happened. I opened up the warehouse and saw the guy laying there all burnt. \"I told the man, ‘I’ll call the ambulance and we’ll meet him up front.’ I don’t know if he understood me or not.\" Bonzagni said the man was sitting up in a chair at that point. \"I’m still shaking from it,\" he said. Circuit City representative Cathy Hess couldn’t say for sure what the electrical problems were that the man was there to fix. The store was evacuated immediately and remained closed for the rest of the day. Hess also couldn’t say when the store will reopen. According to Achilles, there was extensive smoke damage throughout the building.\n\nWorker injured in sugar factory blast\n\nJuly 21, 2003 11:56\n\nA MAN has been taken to hospital with serious injuries today after an explosion at the sugar beet factory at Cantley. Edmund Osborne, 53, received head injuries in the sugar dust explosion which triggered a blaze at the plant which, at its height, was tackled by about 50 firefighters. Mr Osborne, from Lowestoft, who works for east coast electrical contractor firm LEC Marine, was carrying out work in an electricity substation at the site when the blast occurred. It is thought that the explosion blew apart a wall and that Mr Osborne was struck by falling debris. He was taken to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital but his injuries are not thought to be life threatening. Initial reports to police suggested that more people were missing in the blast, but everyone was eventually accounted for. Two other contractors from the same firm were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation, but did not require hospital treatment. The explosion caused a fire to spread to a conveyor belt on the second floor of the plant in an area close to the silos before moving into the roof area. The explosion also caused damage to a nearby electricity substation. The plant has its own fire crew and they tackled the blaze before reinforcements from Norfolk Fire Service arrived. Station Officer Graham Joy, from Norfolk Fire Service, who attended the scene, said: \"It would appear there was a dust explosion, which subsequently caused a fire. \"It was a fairly major fire, but we have brought it under control. Fire crews are now damping down, making the building safe. \"The fire was confined to some cladding in the roof area. The explosion was fairly large. It seems to have been somewhere within the building but has caused some damage to a substation where it seems to have vented itself out.\" A spokesman for British Sugar said Mr Osborne's family had been notified. \"At this stage there has been an incident at the site that has resulted in a fire and one person being injured. \"Everyone else has been accounted for,\" he added. Delivery driver Stephen Brown, of Freethorpe, was at the scene when the explosion happened. He was working for TR Transport to deliver sugar to Felixstowe for export. He said: \"There was a big bang and I saw flames lapping up the side of the building. \"If the fire had taken hold it could have been a big deal.\" PC Geoff Marshall, of Acle police station, said: \"There was an explosion in an area close to the silos which resulted in a fire. \"The explosion blew out a wall and falling bricks injured a contractor who was standing nearby. \"An investigation has been launched. I suspect it will be several days before they right was has happened.\" Train operators on the nearby line were also informed of the explosion to make sure emergency crews had access over a rail crossing. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed and are to carry out an investigation. The police and fire services are also to carry out separate investigations. The factory does not start processing sugar beet until the autumn. During the summer months it undergoes maintenance work.\n\nShock sends worker to hospital\n\nBy Doug Murphy Staff Writer\n\nA workman was shocked and slightly injured while wiring lights at Desert Vista High School around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday.

He was conscious but he was in shock and he was shaking.\" Belco spokeswoman Linda Smith said the company CEO Gary Madeiros and other senior officials immediately went to the hospital to meet the worker and his family. She said an investigation is underway into the incident and Belco crews would be working in Southampton for the remainder of the day to restore power. \"The guys were working on a cable test and had come out just this morning when it happened,\" she said. \"He has severe burns and has been assessed in Bermuda but is likely to be flown out today.\" Bermuda Fire Service staff officer Lt. Dana Lovell said there was now a joint investigation between Belco and Fire officers. \"We understand that it was a very large electrical spark that caused the burns. He did not get electrocuted. \"It is a bit early to speculate. We do not have all the facts at the moment but in due course we will know everything.\"\n\nChesapeake Police Believe Norfolk Repairman Electrocuted to Death\n\nChesapeake police believe a Norfolk repairman was electrocuted to death Wednesday afternoon while repairing a retail store's air conditioning system.

The Stockton man was airlifted to Eden Valley Medical Center in Castro Valley and later transferred to the burn unit at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, where he remained in critical condition Tuesday night, city officials said. \"Apparently the burns are really, really bad,\" said Deputy Fire Chief Steve Jones. The 28-year-old man, whose name wasn't released, was severely burned on both hands, on at least one side of his body, and on one foot. Witnesses started CPR, and an emergency helicopter arrived within five minutes of the accident, Jones said. Charles Sanford, owner of Charles B. Sanford Construction, said his employee accidentally drilled into a 12-kilovolt primary distribution circuit serving the area. He was trenching to install telephone equipment, city officials said. The worker started work with Charles B. Sanford Construction in Winton on Monday, Sanford said. Sanford said he is a friend of his sons. \"I believe that unfortunately it was an accident,\" said Sanford. \"He was operating a drill, which doesn't require much safety training.\" Sanford said the area had been checked by two groups who tested for, but did not locate, the circuit. Matt McCabe, a spokesman for Alameda Power & Telecom, which operates and maintains the electrical system that was drilled into, said the incident occurred 11:30 a.m. on West Ranger Avenue. The distribution circuit was installed initially by the U.S. Navy to serve portions of the former Alameda Naval Air Station. Sanford Construction is a subcontractor to Mobile Modular. The company is retained to install temporary facilities to house a Head Start project being run by the Alameda Point Collaborative. The incident resulted in an electrical outage to approximately 300 customers.

WALKER and LUTHER TURMELLE , Special to The Press 07/12/2003\n\nSTRATFORD -- An early morning explosion at Sikorsky Aircraft Friday left one United Illuminated Co. worker in critical condition and two others hospitalized, and sent investigators scurrying to discover what caused the accident. UI spokesman Kevin Moore said the three utility workers sustained serious injuries when a lightning arrestor on a transformer caused a flash arc to strike the workers. The incident occurred at about 8:45 a.m. as the workers were assessing tasks that were supposed to be done on the transformer this weekend, he said. A lightning arrestor is a piece of equipment that channels electrical surges into the ground to prevent other equipment, such transformers, from being damaged. The incident occurred in an enclosed, caged-in area at the rear of Sikorsky’s main parking lot on River Road, Moore said. \"They were up there checking some transformers (when the incident occurred),\" said Stratford Police Capt. Harvey Maxwell. Moore did not comment on the specific nature of the workers’ injuries, but said \"we hope for a speedy recovery.\" The three workers identities were not released Friday, though Moore said their families had been contacted regarding the incident. One was listed in critical condition and the other two were listed in fair condition at Bridgeport Hospital’s Burn Unit, Moore said. \"They are experienced UI employees who have each been with us a minimum of 20 years,\" Moore said, adding that the three are part of the Power Delivery Underground Group. Moore said Sikorsky Aircraft, UI, and the Bridgeport office of Occupational Safety & Health Administration are cooperating to thoroughly investigate what happened so that it does not occur again. Sikorsky Aircraft spokeswoman Sheena Steiner said the explosion did not interrupt any electric flow to the plant or stop work there. Maxwell said his department had limited involvement in the explosion situation and subsequent investigation because it’s a \"standard industrial accident.\" Moore said it was \"more than 10 or 15 years ago that something of this magnitude happened.\" \"The workers safety is our number one priority,\" Moore said, \"It’s very important for us to find out what happened.\" A review of OSHA data on the company on the federal agency’s Internet site found the last time UI was cited for a violation by the agency was in July 1991 and involved problems with accident prevention signs. The violation initially carried a fine of $1,875, but the agency and UI officials reached an informal agreement later that month in which the company agreed to pay $1,200. According to OSHA records, the last time the agency investigated an accident at the company occurred in August 1983. That was one of six accident investigations that OSHA conducted at UI between January 1978 and August 1983.\n\nUPDATE Second ESB worker dies after accident\n\nJuly 11, 2003\n\nThe ESB has said the death of a second staff member following the accident at Tarbert Power Station in Co Kerry last week has come as a devastating blow for staff and the company.

Huston Street, Barberton. But I haven't been able to get any answer. James Krivanek (who I believe is another owner, is at 440-473-2672, I haven't reached him) Ronald C. Krivanek, co-owner of Barberton Steel & Iron, Inc., was electrocuted Friday after trying to resolve a power issue at the East Huston Street plant. Krivanek, 48, of Coachman Court in Brecksville, was pronounced dead at 11:17 p.m. in the emergency room of Barberton Citizens Hospital, according to the Summit County Medical Examiner's office. The death was ruled accidental. There was no answer at the steel plant on Saturday. A woman at the home of James Krivanek III, Ronald's brother, declined to comment. Barberton police Chief Mike Kallai said workers heard a loud pop and then saw Krivanek lying against the insidef the fence surrounding a power substation on the property. Krivanek was inspecting the substation after workers informed him they weren't getting enough power, said Kallai, who was unable to provide more details. Jill Skapin, spokeswoman for the medical examiner, said it appeared a transformer might have blown. Art Graham, a dispatcher for FirstEnergy, said the company supplies about 12,500 volts of electricity to the substation at Krivanek's company. Kallai said Saturday there wasn't much for the police department to investigate and that he expected FirstEnergy would be assisting the company in determining what went wrong. The accident occurred around 10:40 p.m., Kallai said. In June 1989, Barberton Steel & Iron reported it was investing $600,000 to improve the company's electrical system, increasing its manufacturing capacity by 25 percent. It also planned to spend $220,000 to modernize the system.\n\nNews in brief from eastern Pennsylvania\n\nSCRANTON, Pa.

John Clay worked in construction, his friends say he could fix or build almost anything. So seeing Clay die during a fix-it project was a complete surprise. Storms knocked out power to the area during the holiday, so 58-year-old Clay and his friend, Roger Lucas, had a plan to re-trip the circuit breaker. They used a Hi-lo to work on the breaker box, 30 feet in the air. Clay used a metal rod to knock it into place, the shock shot him all the way to the ground. \"He touched the wood and the breaker at the same time,\" said friend Billy Schneider. \"The wood acted as a conductor and it grounded him as he was electrocuted.\" Schneider attempted CPR, but it was no use. Clay was later pronounced dead on scene by paramedics. Friends say Clay had confidence to do anything. He figured they could fix the problem beforde the power company. \"John had displayed to everyone who had known him that he was basically capable of almost anything,\" said Schneider. Clay was from Switzerland. He had a reunion planned with his family whom he had not seen in decades. They were notified of the news on the fourth.\n\nMan dies in hydro wire accident east of city\n\nBy BRIAN KELLY, The Sault Star Monday, July 07, 2003 - 09:00\n\nLocal News - A Midland, Ont., man is dead after making contact with a live hydro wire early Saturday afternoon near Bruce Mines. John Franklin Stephens, 29, was a member of a K-Line Contracting crew doing planned maintenance work on Cloudslee Road in Plummer Township northeast of the community. The road is about two kilometres from Highway 17. Stephens was working on an overhead distribution line from an elevated bucket when the accident occurred shortly after noon Saturday. “At that particular time they were in the process of reactivating a line and something went wrong,” said Sgt. John Lewis of the East Algoma detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police. Fellow workers applied first aid to Stephens. He was transported to Thessalon Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:24 p.m. No foul play is suspected. A Ministry of Labour investigation continued on Sunday. The Stouffville, Ont.-based contracting company had been subcontracted by Great Lakes Power to work on its overhead distribution lines. “We’ve been striving for a perfect safety record so we’re very upset about this event,” said Kim Osmars, vice-president and general manager of GLP’s transmission and distribution division, on Sunday. “We’re working with the appropriate authorities to review the accident and the causes leading up to the accident.” Osmars, declining to identify the victim or the contracting company, described the firm GLP hired as “excellent” and having a “good reputation” in the industry. “They’ve been working with us for awhile,” he said. While the accident continues to be investigated, Osmars also declined to say how long company employees had been working in the area or how many GLP customers in Bruce Mines were without power until about 11:30 p.m. Power was off for almost 12 hours while the OPP and Ministry of Labour investigated the accident scene.

The 34-year-old Taupo man, employed by Electrix, was working inside the Wairakei substation when the accident occurred around 11am yesterday. He was knocked unconscious when power surged through one of his hands and out the other, leaving him with a hole in one palm and serious burns. \"He was working on a high voltage transmission area where the line meets some other equipment,\" Transpower spokesman Wayne Eagleson said. Mr Eagleson said such accidents rarely occurred. He would not comment on whether the man was lucky to be alive after being struck by 220,000 volts, but pointed out that most power lines in residential areas carried only 11,000 volts. The Tranz Rail rescue helicopter flew the man to Rotorua Hospital. He was said to be recovering well last night. Transpower and Occupational Safety and Health are investigating.\n\n1 Worker Killed, 4 Hurt By High-Voltage Power Line; Truck Touches 115,000-Volt Line\n\nJune 30, 2003\n\nREHOBOTH, Mass. -- One worker was killed and four others were seriously injured Monday when they were shocked by high-power electrical lines in Rehoboth, News Channel 10 reported.

Progress Energy Florida employees were installing new equipment at the substation 2 miles west of Interstate 75 on State Road 54 at 10:30 a.m. when a \"very small, contained explosion\" occurred, spokesman Aaron Perlut said. Perlut did not release the name of the employee, but said his injuries were not life threatening. Pasco County Fire Rescue officials said the man was taken to a hospital in a helicopter. Ernie Holzhauer - spokesman for Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative, which owns the substation - said 6,411 customers in the Wesley Chapel area experienced an outage. Power was restored in seven minutes, he said. The explosion did not interrupt power to any Progress Energy customers or damage the substation. Progress Energy was investigating the cause of the explosion. \"We take any kind of accident very seriously,\" Perlut said.\n\nMan Dies After Being Electrocuted\n\nAltoona -- A Johnstown man died in an unusual accident yesterday. Altoona Police say Christopher Kujanpaa was painting this house when his roller touched a high voltage line. The jolt sent him into immediate cardiac arrest. Two women, who were swimming in their pool, saw what happened and rushed over to help. He died at the Altoona Hospital.\n\n4,000 homes without power after explosion; Residents likely to stay in dark until this morning; Six homes evacuated but residents later allowed back\n\nSTEVE KRAVITZ AND CYNTHIA LEE STAFF REPORTERS\n\nAn explosion and fire at a hydro distribution substation left 4,000 households in a large swath of west-end Toronto without power last night. The fire broke out around 7 p.m. in a Toronto Hydro transformer in the Dupont St. and Ossington Ave. substation and soon spread to another part of the station, blanketing the area with thick clouds of black smoke. One hundred firefighters and 25 trucks responded to the four-alarm blaze. Toronto Fire Platoon Chief Larry Fry said the main concern was that the intense heat would ignite more fires nearby. Six houses and a nearby factory were subsequently evacuated. Residents, however, later returned to their homes, which were undamaged. Though firefighters had the blaze under control by 9:45 p.m., residents living in the area bounded by Bloor St. and St. Clair Ave. and from Dufferin St. east to Spadina Ave. were left in darkness by the loss of the substation. Last night, a Toronto Hydro spokesperson said the power would probably be out until this morning. Spokesperson Laurie McFadden said two transformers were damaged and a crew was trying to operate the local distribution grid with the remaining two transformers. \"Our goal is to get power back as quickly as possible,\" she said. McFadden said hydro officials still did not yet know the cause of the fire, but Fry speculated it may have been a malfunction in the transformer. Emergency crews at the scene expressed concerns about possible PCBs at the site. But hydro officials said the company no longer uses the toxic material in its transformers. Still, hazardous materials crews were called in to monitor and try to disperse the thick smoke. \"It wasn't your ordinary wood smell,\" said local resident Helen Brown, who lives a block from the substation. \"The smoke was black and went straight up to the west,\" she said. Brown said she was glad the power outage did not happen during last week's heat wave and that her only concern now was that the food in her fridge not spoil. Student Roddy Gangoo said he \"was kind of ticked off\" because he couldn't even finish cooking the chicken he was going to have for dinner. \"There it goes, into the garbage,\" he said. Residents are advised to unplug or turn off all appliances including TVs, computers and other sensitive equipment to avoid possible damage when power resumes, hydro officials said.\n\nMan Dies While Trimming Trees\n\nJun 21, 2003\n\nA man cutting limbs off a pine tree in South Richmond was apparently electrocuted yesterday afternoon when one of the branches hit a nearby power line. The victim, whose identity was not released, died in the tree and had to be removed by Richmond firefighters once Dominion Power workers cut the power to the lines. The death remains under investigation. Rescuers were called to the front yard at 58 Rodman Road, which is off Old Midlothian Turnpike, shortly before 4 p.m.\n\nUPDATE Underground Services (1983) Ltd. fined $150,000 for health and safety violation\n\nBELLEVILLE, ON, June 19 /CNW/ - Underground Services (1983) Ltd., a Bolton, Ont. construction company, was fined $150,000 on June 17, 2003 for a violation of the Occupational Health and Safety Act that resulted in the death of two workers. On October 26, 2001, workers were removing \"jersey barriers\" (concrete road barriers) at a highway road and bridge repair project when a cable on a crane, which was being used to lift the barriers, came in contact with a 44,000-volt overhead power line. The incident occurred as one of the workers, who had been signalling the crane operator, went to speak to a second worker. At the time, the crane was in a stopped position. While the signal worker's back was turned, the crane started to back up and the second worker yelled for the signal worker to alert the crane operator of the nearby overhead wires. However, before the signal worker could warn the operator, the crane's cable came in contact with the power line, which was located 11.58 metres (37 feet, 11 inches) above the highway, and the crane became energized. The signal worker was electrocuted while trying to get between the crane and centre median to warn the operator. The operator was electrocuted while trying to leave the crane's cab, possibly after seeing the signal worker fall. Both workers died as a result of their injuries. The incident occurred on Highway 401 near Highway 62 in Belleville. Underground Services (1983) Ltd. had been contracted by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation to conduct the highway repairs on Highway 401 between overpasses on Highways 37 and 62. Underground Services had, in turn, contracted some of the work to a crane company, which employed the two deceased workers. As constructor, Underground Services had overall responsibility for the safety of all employers and workers on the project. Underground Services (1983) Ltd. pleaded guilty, as the constructor, to failing to ensure warning signs were posted in prominent locations where there was a potential hazard from energized overhead power lines, as required by Section 44 of the Regulations for Construction Projects. This was contrary to Section 23(1)(a) of the act. The fine was imposed by Justice of the Peace Sheila Matchett of the Ontario Court of Justice in Belleville. In addition, the court imposed a 25- per-cent victim fine surcharge, as required by the Provincial Offences Act.\n\nElectric Power Line Shocks Worker\n\nTuesday, June 17 6:00pm By Norm Jones\n\nAn electric power line shocked a man Tuesday while he worked in Lycoming County. The shock so severe, it seriously burned him. It all happened while he watched over a prison inmate. The work going on was part of the Lycoming County's Jail Work Release Program. Now investigators want to know why the men were so close to the lines. The man injured is a construction foreman. He was working with a prisoner in Montgomery when the motorized life they were in got dangerously close to the line. It was an accident that some say, didn't have to happen. But when it did, Montgomery resident and Emergency Medical Technician Danielle Bryson happened to be nearby, and looking in that direction. She explained she saw the lift touch the power lines, saw sparks fly, and yelled for the men to get away from the machine The foreman, Michael Niedermyer of Williamsport, bumped into the wire, sending an electric current through his body. Danielle Bryson said she asked other men to keep checking on his pulse and breathing while she went to get help. When crews arrived, they immediately attended to Niedermyer and the inmate, while prison officials investigated. Warden David Desmond told us that all of the prison's work crew foremen are experienced in various trades and construction. The County had rented the lift from a local company. A spokesman there told us most of the inmate workers and foremen at this particular site did pass a safety certification test to operate the lift. Warden David Desmond said that included Niedermyer. Officials told Newswatch 16 the inmate was not injured and as of 6:00 Tuesday evening. Niedermyer was still receiving treatment at a hospital.\n\nUPDATE Companies plead guilty to safety breaches\n\nJune 18 2003 By Selma Milovanovic\n\nTwo companies yesterday pleaded guilty to safety breaches over the death of an electrical worker and serious injuries to another who performed hazardous tasks while unsupervised. John Murphy died while replacing a power pole four years ago, the Melbourne Magistrates Court heard. Mr Murphy was a leading hand of a Skilled Engineering crew employed by United Energy to replace a power pole in Oakleigh on January 27, 1999. Mr Murphy was standing in a cherry-picker and working with 240-volt power lines when a colleague, Daryl Webster, who was delegated the job of safety observer, told Mr Murphy he was going to the crane truck to get tools, just before Mr Murphy suffered an electric shock. United Energy and Skilled Engineering pleaded guilty to failing to ensure a safety observer was present and performed their duty, and failing to ensure protective matting was used. United Energy also pleaded guilty to failing to provide a safety observer in the case of a worker who suffered burns to 50 per cent of his body after suffering an electric shock. On July 16, 1997, Jamie Moore was subcontracted by United Energy to do maintenance work on an electrical substation in Dandenong. The court heard that at the time of the accident there was no supervisor present. Prosecutor Paul Holdenson, QC, said an industry code of practice provided that where it was considered a person or equipment might contact live apparatus, a safety observer needed to be present. Ross Ray, QC, for United Energy, said that since the accident, the entire industry had enforced the issue of safety observers far more rigorously. Magistrate Jelena Popovic adjourned her decision to June 25.\n\nUPDATE Louisiana company cited for safety violations in Mississippi\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor fined a Louisiana-based company $46,800 for safety violations at a job site in Gulfport where a worker was injured by an electric shock. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Marlin Contracting Co., Inc. for a Jan. 2 accident. Marlin Contracting, a utility contractor in Harvey, La., had eight employees working on a power line when one member of the crew, who had been on the job for two days, received a shock and severe burns. The worker remains partially paralyzed from his injuries. OSHA issued 12 citations for violations of safety standards. The company is charged with: -Failing to provide safety training for employees working with high-voltage electrical lines and operating aerial lift equipment -Failing to maintain the required distance between workers, equipment and energized power lines. -Not providing tools certified for use on power lines. -Not inspecting and discarding damaged tools or insulating equipment. -Failing to provide adequate traffic barriers and high visibility clothing for ground employees working near traffic areas. \"This accident could have been prevented if the company had taken precautions required by OSHA regulations and industry practice,\" said Clyde Payne, OHSA's Jackson area director. Marlin Contracting has 15 working days to contest the OSHA citation and proposed penalties.\n\nUTILITY WORKER KILLED AS HE RESTORED STORM OUTAGE\n\nA Nashville Electric Service lineman has been electrocuted as crews worked to restore power outages caused by storms.

Nearly a month later, the maintenance work in the storm's aftermath has taken another. Danny Ray Butler, an employee for Southwest Tennessee Electric Membership Corp., died Sunday night at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital after a broken utility pole fell on him. Butler, 54, of Spring Creek, was a service truck operator and groundsman for Southwest. \"He was as good as his word ... if he said he was going to do something he did it,\" said his wife, Sue Butler, 38. \"He was as honest as the day was long, and he was a very, very good husband and father.\" Starting to cry, she said, \"I'll miss him very, very much.\" Butler and co-worker Jason Brown were responding to a service call Sunday evening off Ranger Road in the Beech Bluff area, where a damaged service pole had most likely been split by last month's tornadoes. While Butler was disconnecting the lines, the pole broke and fell on top of him, said Trent Scott, marketing coordinator for Southwest. The owner of the rental property, where the service pole only affected that particular property's electricity, said he had not been to the scene since the storm and assumed the damage was caused by the tornadoes, Scott said. Butler was conscious at the scene, but was pronounced dead at 9:30 p.m. Sunday at Jackson General, Scott said. \"There is no better human being in this world than him,\" said Jimmie Burchett, a close family friend. \"He would do anything he could to help anybody. He was a very good man, a good father, he loved his work, a great person all around.\" Butler, who was born and raised in Madison County, had worked for Southwest since September 1995. He leaves behind his wife of 14 years, daughter Jauvada Arnold, two stepdaughters, Mandy Pickard of Pinson and Crystal Hill of Spring Creek, two grandchildren, Josh Grant and McKenzie Pickard, and a brother Billy Butler of Chatsworth, Ga. \"We are extending our sympathies to his family,\" Scott said.\n\nUPDATE Lawrenceburg City Employee's Electrocution Investigated\n\nReported by: 9News Web produced by: Liz Foreman\n\nTuesday, inspectors will be back on the scene where a Lawrenceburg city worker was electrocuted. John Davis, 59, was electrocuted Monday afternoon while working on an underground transformer box by the river levy at the end of Walnut Street. Investigators are trying to figure out why he was working on the transformer alone. Davis had only two years left until retirement. He left behind his wife, two children and several grandchildren. Mayor Tremain has closed down the city for the rest of the week except for all emergency personnel.\n\nUPDATE NESTLE AND MONOTRONIC FINED £245,000 FOLLOWING ELECTROCUTION\n\nOne of the country’s largest food and drink manufacturers, Nestlé UK Ltd, was on Friday 30 May fined £220,000 following a fatal accident in 1999 when a contractor’s employee was electrocuted undertaking work at Nestlé’s factory in Nestles Avenue, Hayes, Middlesex. The man’s employer, Monotronic Ltd, was fined £25,000. Isleworth Crown Court ordered Nestlé to pay £30,000 in costs. The Health and Safety Executive prosecuted both companies after the accident on 25 November 1999. Anthony Allen, an electrician for Monotronic Ltd, Lind Road, Sutton, Surrey, was electrocuted while pulling out redundant cables from trunking in the coffee plant in the factory. Monotronic Ltd was charged with breaching Section 2(1) of the Health and Safety at Work, etc., Act 1974, for failing to ensure the safety of its employee. Nestlé UK Ltd was charged with breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work, etc., Act 1974, for failing to ensure the safety of people not employed by them but affected by its work. HSE Principal Inspector Samantha Peace said after the verdict: “Some 18 workers were killed by contact with electricity in 1999 – one of them was Anthony Allen. His death could have been avoided if Nestlé had ensured its contractors either followed or had in place a safe system of work, similar to the system Nestlé managed for its own employees. “Every company, however large or small, must ensure that contractors have safe systems of work and follow them. This is particularly important for electrical work.”\n\nTri-State Worker Killed On Job Site; Few Details Available About Man's Electrocution\n\nPolice are investigating an incident in which a man was electrocuted at a job site Monday afternoon.

On August 7, 2001, an electrician was doing electrical work at a new electrical substation at Lac Des Iles Mine near Highway 527 when the worker's right hand came in contact with a live electrical component on a 4,160-volt control panel. The worker received second-degree burns. Prior to doing the electrical work, steps had been taken to de-energize the circuit and breaker control, but the system had not yet been tested to ensure it was fully de-energized. Unknown to the electrician, there was a back feed of electricity running from an old electrical substation. A Ministry of Labour investigation found there was no current, permanent, single-line electrical drawing posted in a conspicuous location at the substation that would have shown the electrical back feed. There was also no notice warning that either side of a disconnecting device could be energized. Both were requirements of the Ontario Electrical Code. The electrician had also not been informed of proper high- voltage procedures for working with energized equipment. The worker was employed by a Thunder Bay electric company, which had been contracted to do electrical work at the electrical substation at Lac Des Iles Mine, which produces a mineral called palladium. Lac Des Iles Mines Limited pleaded guilty, as an employer, to 1. Failing to post a current, permanent, legible, single-line electrical drawing in a conspicuous location at the electrical substation, as required by Section 155(1) of the Regulation for Mines and Mining Plants. This was contrary to Section 25(1)(c) of the act; 2. Failing to post on an emergency tiebreaker electrical panel a notice warning that electrical contacts on either side of the disconneting device could be energized, as required by Section 155(1) of the Regulation for Mines and Mining Plants. This was contrary to Section 25(1)(c) of the act; and 3. Failing to inform, instruct and supervise workers on proper high-voltage procedures. This was contrary to Section 25(2)(a) of the act. Justice of the Peace Tom Logan, of the Ontario Court of Justice in Thunder Bay, fined the company $20,000 on the first count, $20,000 on the second count and $10,000 on the third count. A supervisor pleaded guilty to failing to post a current, permanent, legible, single-line electrical drawing in a conspicuous location at the electrical substation. This was contrary to Section 27(2)(c) of the act. Justice of the Peace Logan fined the supervisor $5,000. In addition, the court imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge on the fines against the company and supervisor, as required by the Provincial Offences Act.\n\nUPDATE Hydro One Network Services Inc. fined $100,000 for health and safety violation\n\nTORONTO, May 29 /CNW/ - Hydro One Network Services Inc., a Toronto-based company which provides maintenance, repair and operational services to Hydro One Networks Inc., an electricity transmission and distribution subsidiary of Hydro One Inc., was fined $100,000 on May 27, 2003 for a violation of the Occupational Health and Safety Act that resulted in serious burns to two employees. On October 11, 2001, two construction workers were taking measurements and verifying positions of parts they were making at a Toronto transformer substation when a metal measuring tape being used by one of the workers came in contact with energized equipment. The worker suffered burns to the right bicep area, the arms, hands, face and neck. The second worker suffered flash burns to the eyes and a temporary loss of vision. At the time of the incident, the first worker was on a scaffold platform and the second worker was on a ladder leading up to the scaffold platform. One end of the scaffold was located 1.5 metres (five feet) away from the energized equipment. The workers had been fabricating a framework for a wall that was to be used to extend the walls between transformer bays at the transformer substation, which was owned by Hydro One Networks Inc. at 83 Charles Street in Toronto. Hydro One Network Services Inc. pleaded guilty to failing, as an employer, to ensure that tools, ladders, scaffolding and other equipment and materials capable of conducting electricity were not stored or used so close to an energized electrical installation, equipment or conductor that they could make electrical contact with an energized conductor, as required by Section 194 of the Regulations for Construction Projects. This was contrary to Section 25(1)(c) of the act. The fine was imposed by Justice Robert Bigelow of the Ontario Court of Justice at Old City Hall in Toronto. In addition, the court imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge, as required by the Provincial Offences Act.\n\nUtilities worker shocked east of Grand Island\n\nBy Gretchen Fowler Publication Date: 05/29/03\n\nA Grand Island Utilities Department worker was shocked shortly after 11 a.m. today when he apparently grabbed a wire he shouldn't have. Bob Smith of the Utilities Department said crews were working at a home on Hermitage Place, just west of the Hall/Merrick county line, when the accident occurred.

Craige Diaz, 48, was working alone, replacing a transfer switch, when he was electrocuted, according to university spokeswoman Bonnie Martin. Columbia County Deputy Coroner Diane Benner said university employees found him down and started performing CPR. Benner added that no one's exactly sure how much time had passed between the time Diaz was fatally shocked and when he was found. She did say, though, that the last time anyone had contact with him was 45 minutes to an hour before he was pronounced dead at Bloomsburg Hospital at 2:24 p.m. Martin said Diaz didn't work for BU. He was an employee of Emergency Systems Service Co., of Quakertown. Chief Coroner Dr. Michael Kenny said the electric current probably sent Diaz into a cardiac arrhythmia. \"Electricians are always shocking themselves and unfortunately, this time it was a fatal case,\" said Kenny.
