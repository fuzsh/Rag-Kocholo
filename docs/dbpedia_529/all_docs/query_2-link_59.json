        "text": "Special Dispatch to the New-York Times.\n\nWASHINGTON, Tuesday, May 23, 1865.\n\nThe Army of the Potomac has passed in review. The first day's pageant is over, and to the correspondent falls the duty of depicting a scene almost devoid of incident, save in its grand aspiration. Every circumstance has combined to make it a complete success. The weather has been magnificent; the air, delightfully tempered by the rains of the past week, is cool and fragrant, and dust is for the time subdued.\n\nWashington has been filled as it never was filled before; the hotel-keepers assert that the pressure upon their resources never was so great, and thousands of people have been nightly turned away to seek a place of rest where best they might.\n\nThe train which left New-York on Monday evening consisted of twenty-one overcrowded cars, and only reached Washington at ten o'clock this morning, an hour after the grand column had begun to move. Still are the crowds pouring in, particularly from the West, with the friends and admirers of SHERMAN's great armies, which pass in review to-morrow.\n\nThough the city is so crowded, it is yet gay and jovial with the good feeling that prevails, for the occasion is one of such grand import and true rejoicing, that small vexations sink out of sight. With many it is the greatest epoch of their lives; with the soldier it is the last act in the drama; with the nation it is the triumphant exhibition of the resources and valor which have saved it from disruption and placed it first upon earth.\n\nSo the scene of to-day (and that of to-morrow) will never be forgotten, and he who is privileged to be a witness will mark it as a white day in the calendar, from which to gather hope and courage for the future.\n\nAs you are already informed, the troops participating in this most interesting pageant that has ever been known in the history of the country, left their camps yesterday and marched to positions convenient to the city. The Ninth Corps, which was encamped near Alexandria, left their camp at an early hour yesterday morning, and marched through Alexandria, along the turnpike, thence to Long Bridge, across the bridge, and through Maryland-avenue to a field about one and a half miles east of the Capitol, where they encamped for the night.\n\nThe order of their march was just the reverse of that observed in the review to-day, the Third Division taking the lead, and followed by the Second and First. Gen. TIDBALL's Artillery Brigade followed the lead of the First Division, but moved beyond the locality where it encamped, so as to bring it in the rear of the corps as it formed this morning. The Fifth Corps also moved out of its camp yesterday, and bivouacked last night on a field near the Long Bridge, accompanied by the Artillery Brigade of Brevet Brig.-Gen. C.S. WAINWRIGHT.\n\nThe Second Corps, accompanied by the Artillery Brigade of Lieut.-Col. J.G. HAZARD, did not move out of camp yesterday, as it was near enough to the city to take its place in the line before the movement commenced this morning.\n\nAt four o'clock this morning reveille was sounded in the camps of all the organizations composing this vast army, and by six o'clock breakfast had been eaten, baggage packed and loaded on the wagons, and the troops were ready for duty. The assembly call was sounded in the Ninth Corps at six o'clock precisely, and half an hour afterward the First Division of that corps, Maj.-Gen. WILCOX commanding, formed on a street east of the Capitol, and moved down till the head of the column rested on Third-street east.\n\nThe Second Division, Brig.-Gen. S.G. GRIFFIN commanding, formed in the rear of this in the order published in our report of yesterday, and in its rear was the Third Division, Brig.-Gen. JOHN J. CURTIN commanding. The Artillery Brigade attached to the Corps, Brig.-Gen. JOHN C. TIDBALL commanding, formed in the rear of the latter, [???]nd the entire line extended from Third-street east, about one and a half miles, and comprised altogether an aggregate of about thirty thousand men. These troops are for the most part those who on the memorable 2d of April, attacked the rebel works on the immediate front of Petersburgh, and succeeded, after fifteen hours' hard fighting, in driving the enemy back and thus compelling the evacuation of Petersburgh and Richmond. Their commanding officers, who to-day rode at the head of the corps, divisions, brigades and regiments, are, with few exceptions, those who commanded on that occasion, and you may rely upon it they felt proud of the noble men who followed them in this triumphal march to-day. Among the exceptions we regret to name Maj.-Gen. POTTER of the Second Division, whose wound is not yet sufficiently healed to admit of his participating in this pageant. Brevet Maj.-Gen. HANTRAUFT, of the Third Division, who is detached and appointed to take charge of the assassins of the President and Secretary SEWARD; Col. WINSLOW, of the One Hundred and Eighty-sixth New-York, who is at home, still suffering severely from his wound, and several other gallant officers whose names have slipped my memory at the present moment.\n\nThe cavalry corps, comprising the division of Gens. CUSTER, one brigade of Gen. DAVIES' division, and the division of Gen. DEVIN, formed on Maryland-avenue, also east of the Capitol; the horse artillery brigade, Col. J.M. ROBERTSON commanding, was formed on Third-street east, north of Maryland-avenue. The Provost-Marshals' brigade, Brevet Brig.-Gen. G.N. MACY commanding, formed on Third-street, east, south of Maryland-avenue, and the Engineer Brigade, Brig-Gen. H.W. BENHAM commanding, formed on Fourth-street, east, south of Maryland-avenue.\n\nThe whole army was soon in motion in the following order, which was officially promulgated from the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac yesterday:\n\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Monday, May 22, 1865.\n\nThe following order, in column of corps, divisions, brigades, and regiments, for the review on the 23d inst., is published for general information, viz.:\n\nMaj.-Gen. GEORGE G. MEADE commanding.\n\nGeneral Staff.\n\nHeadquarters Escort -- Squadron 1st Massachusetts Cavalry, Capt. E.A. Flint commanding.\n\nCAVALRY CORPS.\n\nMaj.-Gen. Merritt commanding.\n\nGeneral Staff.\n\nHeadquarters Escort -- 5th U.S. Cavalry, Lieut. Urban commanding.\n\nBy command of Major-Gen. MEADE.\n\nGEO. D. RUGGLES, Assistant Adjutant-General.\n\nThe preparations for the reviewing of the troops were concluded at a late hour last night, the stands being all erected and arranged according to the discretion of the authorities in charge. The main stand on the left of the avenue and immediately in front of the President's house, was that devoted to President JOHNSON, Gen. GRANT, who is reviewing officer, the members of the Cabinet, prominent military and naval officers, heads of departments, the Diplomatic Corps, and the ladies. This platform was neatly roofed and provided with seats for several hundred people. Much of its rough exterior was tastefully concealed by a profuse drapery of national and State colors, while in the folds at intervals flashed out the names of Shiloh, Donelson, Stone River, Vicksburgh, &c.\n\nBoth to the right and left of this stand were long-raised platforms, with seats for a thousand or more, provided by private munificence, for sick and wounded soldiers, but to which many officers and some civilians were admitted by ticket.\n\nOn the opposite, or north side, of the avenue, the government erected one stand for state officials of high degree, while the enterprise of the friends of the different army corps, and the several military State agencies, occupied the entire remaining space between Fifteen-and-a-Half and Seventeenth streets, with well-constructed platforms, which, being vis-a-vis to the President and his distinguished companions, gave thousands a most excellent view of of the entire scene.\n\nAs the hour for the head of the column to appear approached, all eyes were bent on the faces beneath the canopy, which marked the station of the Commander-in-Chief and the Lieutenant-General, but they are not yet there.\n\nHANCOCK's martial form appears, accompanied by a bevy of ladies, and then TORDERT, of the cavalry, and soon the clear-cut features of SHERMAN are pointed out, and closely scanned by the multitude. STANTON and WELLES, and HARLAN, bearing gracefully his new honors, and MCCULLOCH and the other Cabinet officers are in the second tier from the front, and sandwiched most delightfully between them are wives, sisters and little ones. It is 9 o'clock, and with military promptness the column starts from the Capitol, at the head of Maryland-avenue, Gen. MEADE, and Staff, and escort, taking the advance. At 9:15 o'clock Gen. MEADE reaches the point where Gen. GRANT and the President are expected; but they have not yet reached their stations, and the General, the Staff and escort pass without the honor of a review.\n\nThe President arrives in his carriage. Directly after, however, almost at the same moment, Gen. GRANT and Staff walk briskly from their headquarters and assume their designated positions. Gen. MEADE and Staff having passed, they now return dismounted, and soon the sharply-defined head of the Commander of the Army of the Potomac adds another to the group of distinguished persons, on whom the eyes, the opera-glasses, and even the photographers' lenses are resting. And now begins the review proper, the renowned Cavalry Corps, first mobilized by HOOKER, first successfully fought by PLEASONTON, and which has gained such great renown under SHERIDAN, and now led by MERRITT, begins to pass by in platoons of sixteen horsemen each, with sabres drawn. The drum corps opposite the reviewing-officer peals out a salute, and the march commences.\n\nJust here is the most exciting little incident of the day. CUSTER leads his famous division around the corner of Fifteenth-street when some fair hand throws out a beautiful wreath; the General catches it upon his arm, but the movement so frightens the magnificent stallion which the General rides, that he becomes unmanagable and dashes up the avenue at a frightful speed; but CUSTER is too good a horseman to be so easily unseated; minus hat and sabre, holding on to the wreath with one hand, he brings his steed down with the other, and curbing him severely, brings him back to his good behavior and in his place at the head of the division, and horse and rider, with superb spirit, have afforded the spectators the finest equestrian exhibition of the day.\n\nCUSTER and his steed gone, now come the troopers, each man in this division being decorated with a scarf or tie, known as the Custer Tie, red in color, and made of any material, from the finest silk or merino to the coarsest flannel, thrown back over the shoulders, giving the entire body a peculiar and interesting appearance.\n\nCAPEHART's brigade of West Virginia Veterans, as trusty a body as ever drew a sabre, are singled out for their fine appearance; and immediately following is young PENNINGTON, with his brigade, looking as much at home with a cavalry sabre as when he pounded over Virginia's rough roads with his famous battery.\n\nA part only of the Second Cavalry Division, under Gen. DAVIES, is here; one brigade followed by a brigade of cavalry belonging in Washington, under Brig.-Gen. CHAPMAN.\n\nThe rear of DAVIES' division is most gracefully brought up by a lonely contraband on a mule, who, looking the picture of independence, receives the cheers and laughter of the crowd with great self-complacency.\n\nThe First Division of the corps under Brig.-Gen. THOMAS C. DEVIN, a worthy son of New-York, follows next in order, the reserve brigade, under the soldierly-appearing GIBBS leading. Col. FITZHUGH follows with his brigade, and his platoons are noticeable for the fine order in which they move. The \"first shall be last,\" and the First Brigade, under Col. STAGG, Michigan's gallant horsemen, with banners all too small for the names of the battles they have fought. They fitly hold the left of the line, and are followed by those pets of the cavalry -- the horse batteries brigaded under their chief, Col. ROBERTSON. Here are old acquaintances, WILLISTON, RANDOLPH and RANSOM, who, with their 3-inch rifles and brass twelves, have raided it with the cavalry all up and down every valley and highway in Old Virginia. The batteries move by sections, the buglers playing their calls in chorus, with fine effect.\n\nNext in order is Gen. MACY, Provost-Marshal General of the Army of the Potomac, with his mixed command of infantry and cavalry, the law and order brigade of the army. The fine marching of the two small regiments of regulars attracts even the unpracticed eye.\n\nThe stalwart form of Maj.-Gen. BENHAM, of the Engineer Brigade, is next seen leading the men to whose enduring valor and patience, under the most trying circumstances, we are indebted for many of our greatest victories. Twice or thrice, and even half a score of times, they have bridged every notable stream of war. So efficient have they become, that they can bridge such a stream as the Hudson in a few hours. At the rear of the brigade are two of their mammoth pontoon boats -- a novel sight to unaccustomed eyes.\n\nThe cavalry corps, with their artillery brigade, have occupied one hour and fifteen minutes in passing this point. The infantry forces proper of the army, the Ninth Corps, Maj.-Gen. PARKE, began moving by the reviewing officer at 11:15 A.M. Enthusiastic friends have showered bouquets and wreaths of laurel upon officers, men and horses. Gens. PARKE and WILSON are bedecked with these sweet gifts, even to the trappings of their saddles. The Ninth Army Corps! Where has it not been? Early in the war I followed its banners to Roanoke. Then it became attached to the Army of the Potomac, and fought at South Mountain, Antietam and Fredericksburgh. Then away to Kentucky; thence to Mississippi; then back again to East Tennessee, in the glorious defence of Knoxville; then once more to Virginia, to the Wilderness, to the James, to the Appomattox, and, finally, to the great victory. It has been all cut to pieces a score of times, and yet nearly 25,000 men march before our eyes, and among its organization I still find vestiges of two regiments whose first charge I witnessed on Roanoke Island, Feb. 8, 1862 -- perfect veterans in every sense. The first Colonel of one is Brevet Maj.-Gen. HARTRANFT, who saved Fort Steadman, and beat back the enemy with a division of new troops never before under fire. The first Colonel of the other is Brevet Maj.-Gen. FERRERO, commanding a division of colored troops at Richmond. The second Colonel is Brevet Maj.-Gen. POTTER, severely wounded in the late battles before Petersburgh, not yet recovered. Then there is the Seventy-ninth New-York, still a battalion left, the highlanders whose bag-pipe puts forth its strains the same as ever; and the One Hundredth Pennsylvania, the round heads of the early South Carolina campaigns; but Oh; those flags, slowly but appreciatively, the audience begin to mark and applaud the tattered banners, some stained and worn, others torn to threads, barely clinging to the staff, and others still carefully gathered around the staff, the threads all too priceless less to lose a single one. How many volumes those banners speak; how much more eloquent than any words are they?\n\nThe Ninth Corps proper kept so well closed up, and moved in such excellent order, that it occupied but fifty minutes in passing the reviewing officer. It was then followed by DWIGHT's division, formerly of the Nineteenth Corps. Heroes of the Gulf, of the swamps and the bayous of Louisiana and of the Shenandoah Valley, this division had moved from its camp near Bladensburgh at 1 o'clock A.M., and marching to the city via the Baltimore Turnpike, had formed on Four-and-a-Half-street, with its right resting on Maryland-avenue, and when the order for marching was given, it filed to the right along Maryland-avenue, passing around the Capitol, and tell in line in the rear of the Ninth Corps.\n\nThe Ninth Corps' badge is a shield with an anchor and crossed, and readily distinguishable from that of any other corps in the army, but the badge of the Nineteenth, being a square with corners cut out or looped, giving it the appearance of a Maltese cross, is frequently taken for that of the Fifth Corps, which it closely resembles. For this reason many persons were to-day unable to identify it, and its appearance in the line caused the supposition that the First Division of the Fifth Corps had been divided.\n\nThis division numbered about eight thousand men, and it appeared to excellent advantage. It has seen a great deal of service, having been engaged in the Department of the Gulf, where it participated in the battles of Bisland, Alexandria, Plainstone, Port Hudson, Coxe's Plantation, Pleasant Hill, Mansura, Yellow Bayou and Lebrodville, and in the Shenandoah Valley. It was with Gen. SHERIDAN at Charlestown and Winchester, Opequan, Fisher's Hill and Middletown. For several weeks past, it has been lying in camp in this vicinity. The Second and Third Divisions of this corps are at present in the South, doing garrison duty. Their history has been written in the accounts of the campaigns in the Carolinas.\n\nThe Fifth Corps, numbering about 23,000 men, moved across the Long Bridge at 3 o'clock this morning, and forward on Tenth-street south, with its right resting on Maryland-avenue. It also filed to the right and marched along Maryland-avenue, passing around the capitol in the rear of the Nineteenth Corps, followed by Gen. WAINWRIGHT's artillery brigade. During the interval between the passage of the corps, the spectators on either side rushed to the front of the stand, where were the President, GRANT, SHERMAN and others, and indulged in an informal review of these gentlemen, who bore their inquisitive glances gracefully, and after repeated calls they severally arose and bowed their acknowledgments. But this scene was brief, for the Maltese cross of the Fifth Artillery Corps is wheeling into the avenue, the military figure of Maj.-Gen. GRIFFIN at the head of the line. Headquarters and staff and escort passed, and the First division follows with the gallant CHAMBERLAIN. No right by the rules of life and death to be there, but still there, leading his troops in the day of triumph as modestly as in the days of adversity. The First and Second brigades pass, and then comes the Third, four thousand strong, the consolidated remnant of the old First division of that corps, the brigade from which such soldiers as BUTTERFIELD, and RICE, and VINCENT, and half a score of others have graduated to higher rank. Still in its ranks are vestiges of these regiments which made Hall's Hill an encampment in the Winter of 1861 and 1862; the Eighty-third Tennessee and Sixteenth Michigan. The rest are all gone; \"gone whence the note of victory cannot call them.\"\n\nThe Second Division is next in order, the robust form of Brevet Maj.-Gen. AYRES at its head. AYRES battery was famous at the first battle of Bull Run. The cordon of batteries did great work on FRANKLIN's front at the first Fredericksburgh battle, and AYRE's division of infantry, once under SYKES, enjoys like fame. I remember it was all regulars. Now that the command is reduced to a handful and scattered almost to the winds, but in its place are good and sturdy men. In the Fourteenth New-York I recognized the remnant of the Ellsworth Avengers, formerly the Forty-fourth New-York, who gave RICE and CHAPIN to the service to fall at Spottsylvania and at Port Hudson, still with this division are the Zouzous, a relic of the famous Fifth New-York, the original DURYEA's Zouaves. The long line of distinguished officers both living and dead which this regiment has given to the service passes at once before my eyes. I think of THEODORE WINTHROP and his Cecil Dreeme; of WARREN living, and WINSLOW dead; of WINTHROP who fell at Dinwidhy just when his work was o'er; of young PARTRIDGE who fell at Gaines Mill, and of many more whose names live, though their bodies are dust.\n\nThe Third Division is now passing by. It possesses a peculiar interest. It is all that is left of the famous Third Army Corps, and it is still permitted to wear its old emblem -- the White Diamond.\n\nGen. MOTT sits his horse well, though I left him (April 14) crippled by a severe wound, which was not his first. In the First Brigade is the Fortieth New-York, (the veteranized Mozrrt Regiment,) still strong in numbers. The Seventy-third New-York is the only district regiment left of the organization known as the Excelsior Brigade.\n\nIn the Third Brigade I find one relic of the famous New-Jersey brigade, the Seventh Regiment under Col. PRICE, which at Chancellorsville took seven battle-flags from the enemy, though it lost Col. FRANCINE. This division -- a corps in miniature -- have not lost their love for the hand that first moulded and fashioned into shape JOS. HOOKER.\n\nThroughout the entire line the troops appeared in excellent condition and spirits, and although they have decidedly opposed the task involved in this parade, after having commenced the march it seemed to have become a pleasant duty, and they performed it as they have many others more laborious and dangerous, with cheerfulness.\n\nThe reception the troops met with, though it may be equal to anything they could expect in this city, with its cosmopolitan characters, is not such as citizens of a large city -- such as New-York or Philadelphia -- would anticipate. It is true, there were splendid displays of flags, and above Pennsylvania-avenue and Fifteenth-street the pavements, windows and balconies, and in some instances roofs, were crowded with people of all ages and sexes, who frequently cheered and waved their handkerchiefs or small flags in their hands. At other places along the route of march no proper demonstration was made. It was, therefore, quite refreshing this morning, when the head of the column arrived opposite the north side of the Capitol, to witness the scene that awaited them there. The entire hill side was literally covered with children dressed in holiday attire. The girls were gaily bedecked with ribbons of different colors and the lads were sashes or rosettes of similar hue. A number of mottoes, printed in large and legible letters, were prominently arranged in the rear of the groups, and in appropriate places were banners and flags of various sizes. Before the eye could become interested with the details of this chkrming spectacle, the hundreds of juvenile voices were heard singing, in a highly-artistic style, \"The Battle-Cry of Freedom.\" We soon learned that the assembly was composed of the scholars, teachers and trustees of the public schools of the city, who had chosen this method of welcoming home the heroes of the war for the Union. The different colored ribbons, sashes and rosettes designated the several districts to the schools of which the wearers belonged -- the red representing the first, white the second, blue the third, and green the fourth. Among the most prominent of the inscriptions was one explanatory of the scene: \"The public schools of Washington welcome the heroes of the republic.\" This hung immediately over the entrance to the east portico of the capitol, and was painted upon a large white banner. Opposite to it, over the entrance to the western portico, was another similar banner bearing the inscription, \"The only national debt we can never pay is the debt we owe to the victorious Union soldiers.\" Other banners arrayed against different parts of the building between these two bore the mottoes, \"Honor to the Brave,\" \"Union and Freedom Forever,\" \"Welcome Brave Soldiers,\" \"Defenders of the Country,\" etc. At intervals on the hillside, evergreen bushes, dressed with clusters of flowers enhanced the beauty of the scene, and the interest was increased when several children were observed standing ready to bestow upon the soldiers these, charming boquets. Nearly all the Generals, and many of the field officers, were recipients of these favors, and the fair lasses were not a little elated to see their gifts highly prized and carefully preserved by those upon whom they bestowed them. Besides the song named above, the scholars also sung several others equally appropriate and as only a portion of them sung at once after the first piece the singing was continued most of the time while the column was passing. To aid the effect of this well-planned entertainment the schools were accompanied by the Cliffburne Barracks Band, and the band of the Ninth Veteran Reserve Corps, who filled the intervals between the vocal performances by playing a number of popular airs. The soldiers were not slow to appreciate the compliment intended by this welcome, and several times gave utterance to their approbation by hearty cheers for the public schools of Washington.\n\nAfter passing this point, the sidewalks became densely crowded with spectators of both sexes, and every available place for overlooking the column, such as windows, balconies, &c., was filled with ladies. Most of these expressed their welcome by waiving handkerchiefs, bowing, smiling, and clapping their hands. This was especially the case when they recognized an acquaintance in the column whose attention they desired to attract, and their demonstrations frequently elicited cheering from the troops.\n\nOn arriving opposite the Metropolitan Hotel, several regiments, cheered lustly, Gov. FENTRN, of New-York being upon the balcony. His care and attention has endeared the Governor to the troops from his State and his presence was sufficient to account for the enthusiastic demonstration indulged in.\n\nAgain on reaching Willard's Hotel, there was loud cheering in compliment to Gov. CURTIN, of Pennsylvania, who was a witness of the pageant from the balcony in front of that building. There were also loud demonstations in front of a stand on Fifteenth-street south of the Treasury building, where a large number of friends and relatives of the officers and soldiers were assembled.\n\nDuring the entire march along Pennsylvania-avenue no unpleasant incident occurred to mar the general harmony. The street was kept entirely clear of pedestrians not belonging to the army, and by this careful management no opportunity for accident or disorderly proceedings occurred. All the liquor establishments were closed by order yesterday, and will remain so until Thursday morning.\n\nThe day has been memorable and enjoyable beyond expectation or precedent."
