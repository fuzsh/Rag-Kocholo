        "text": "Episode 99 – In this episode, we welcome Chief Judge Chris Dillon of the North Carolina Court of Appeals. As North Carolina's intermediate appellate court, the Court of Appeals reviews proceedings that occur in trial courts for errors of law or legal procedure. On the podcast, Dillon discusses his path to becoming a Court of Appeals judge, the role of the Court of Appeals in our court system, and the importance of mentorship and civil education for students, young lawyers, and the general public.\n\n\"I had been at the Court for four months and remember a student at UNC called and asked to be my intern, and I really wasn't that familiar with the role or that judges had interns,\" Dillon said on the podcast. \"The intern came over and I discovered what I really love about this job was that you get the chance to mentor. Interns come to the Court of Appeals to learn and be mentored and I love that.\"\n\nChief Judge Chris Dillon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, the youngest of five children. He received both his undergraduate degree and Juris Doctor from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Following law school, Judge Dillon practiced law at Young Moore Henderson and was licensed by the North Carolina Real Estate Commission as a broker. In addition, he has taught various real estate focused courses at both UNC School of Law and Campbell School of Law as an adjunct professor. Judge Dillon was elected to an eight-year term on the North Carolina Court of Appeals in 2012, and was appointed as Chief Judge on January 1, 2024.\n\nThis interview was conducted by Judicial Branch Communications Office Summer Intern Sophie Strach.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 98 – In this episode, we feature excerpts from an interview with Russell M. Robinson II, the founding partner of the Robinson Bradshaw law firm. Robinson was born in Charlotte, NC, in 1932 and attended Princeton University for most of his undergraduate years. He then earned his Juris Doctor from the Duke University School of Law. Robinson is the author of Robinson on North Carolina Corporation Law, a publication providing coverage of the business corporation, limited liability company, and nonprofit corporation statutes in North Carolina.\n\nIn the interview, Robinson shares the 5-year journey of writing the first edition of his book, how he and his partners started their law firm, and his opinions on how the practice of law has changed over the years.\n\n\"The practice of law has fundamentally changed and not for the better,\" Robinson said on the podcast. \"More and more lawyers take-on their clients' position and lose their independence to be able to examine that position because it becomes their position too. That's an undermining of professionalism that I think is really regrettable.\"\n\nThis interview was conducted in 2018 by John R. Wester of the Robinson Bradshaw law firm for the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism's Historical Video Series. A full version of the interview can be found on the NCcourts Youtube Channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 97 – In this episode, we welcome the Honorable Louis A. Bledsoe, III, the Chief Judge of the North Carolina Business Court. On the podcast, Bledsoe shares about his path to becoming an attorney and judge, the role of the Business Court and how it functions, and he reflects on the joys and challenges in today's legal community.\n\n“My favorite part (of being a judge) has been, whether through the case management process or through judicial resolution, to help the parties find their way to a resolution of the dispute that they have,” said Bledsoe on the podcast.\n\nThe North Carolina Business Court is a specialized forum of the superior court division. Cases involving complex and significant issues of corporate and commercial law in our state are designated by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina as complex business cases for assignment to a Business Court judge who oversees resolution of all matters in the case through trial. Established in 1996, the Business Court has locations in Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh, and Winston-Salem.\n\nThe Honorable Louis A. Bledsoe, III presides as Chief Judge of the North Carolina Business Court with chambers located at the Mecklenburg County Courthouse in Charlotte. He has served as a Business Court judge since July 1, 2014 and as Chief Judge since July 1, 2018. He announced his retirement for January 2025.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 96 – In this episode, we feature excerpts from a 2004 interview with late Judge Robinson O. Everett (1928-2009), former Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for Armed Forces. Everett graduated from Harvard University at age 19 and was admitted into the North Carolina Bar Association by age 22. Originally from Durham, North Carolina, Everett was part of Duke Law School's faculty for over 50 years - founding the University's Center on Law Ethics and National Security. In the interview, Everett shares of the importance of mentorship, his family, and the many different facets of law as he traveled from North Carolina to Washington over the course of his more than 50-year career.\n\n\"One of the nice things about being a lawyer is that you occasionally have opportunities to do something that will be very far-reaching,\" Everett said on the podcast. \"Where you can hopefully bring about a result that will make things better for everyone.\"\n\nThe interview was conducted by Hon. William A. Creech for the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism's Historical Video Series. A full version of the interview can be found on the NCcourts Youtube Channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 95 – On this episode, we welcome Rufus Edmisten who served as the deputy chief counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee (1973-74). The Committee's final report, released on June 27, 1974, was partly responsible for the resignation of President Richard Nixon on August 9, 1974. On the podcast, Edmisten reflects on the high-profile nature of his work on the Committee, his relationship with Committee Chairman U.S. Senator Sam Ervin, and recounts the history-defining moment in which he personally delivered the subpoena to the White House for Nixon's secret Oval Office tapes.\n\n\"I knew it was going to be a big day, and when I got (to the White House) I read the subpoena title but then did a little impish thing too,\" said Edmisten on the podcast. \"I had a little U.S. Constitution in my back pocket that Senator Ervin used to carry around, and something about my Boone upbringing said, 'whip that baby out on them.' So I pulled it out of my right back pocket and said, 'I heard you need one of these down here too.'\"\n\nRufus L. Edmisten was born and raised in Boone, North Carolina, and earned an undergraduate degree from UNC-Chapel Hill and a Juris Doctor from the George Washington University Law Center in Washington, DC. He served as North Carolina Secretary of State, North Carolina Attorney General, and was the Democratic nominee for Governor in 1984. He is currently a lawyer in private practice.\n\nThe interview was conducted by North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts Communications Director Graham Wilson.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 94 – In this episode, we feature an excerpt of a 2004 interview with the late James D. Blount, Jr. (1927–2015), who worked as a prominent attorney in Rockingham and Wake counties. Blount's 50-year legal career included working as lead counsel in over 300 civil jury trials, and numerous stints serving as a volunteer in civic and community organizations. Originally from Wilson County, Blount served in the United States Navy before earning an undergraduate degree from UNC-Chapel Hill and a Juris Doctor from UNC School of Law. In the interview, Blount shares about the importance of professionalism and the lessons learned from his lengthy legal career.\n\n\"One thing (I've learned) is that you may have a whole lot of clients but that client only has one lawyer,\" Blount said on the podcast. \"He deserves to have his phone calls returned, questions answered, to be made to feel good about his case, and to be told the truth about it.\"\n\nThis interview was conducted by attorney Samuel G. Thompson for the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism's Historical Video Series. A full version of the interview can be found on the NCcourts Youtube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 93 – In this episode, we profile Safe Babies Court, a new specialty court that aims to reduce the time a child spends in foster care before reaching a safe and permanent home. Guests include Chief District Court Judge J. Corpening, District Court Judge Rebecca Eggers-Gryder, Safe Babies Court State Director Polly Handrahan, and Safe Babies Court State Coordinator Kristin Stout. The panel discusses the need for Safe babies Court, how it works, and the impact the Court is already having in communities across the state.\n\n\"We are on the precipice of changing lives forever by changing a baby's life, changing a family's life, and making it less likely that the family will intersect with child welfare again,\" said Judge Corpening on the podcast. \"That makes our communities healthier, better, and safer. This is really significant work.\"\n\nNorth Carolina is engaged in a three-year pilot process that will begin implementation in Brunswick, Durham, Mitchell, New Hanover, and Yancey counties over the next year. The goal of Safe Babies Court is to improve the long-term well-being of children ages birth to three (or five in some areas), and their families, in the child welfare system. This program connects babies and their families with intensive support designed to promote healthy child development while working to ensure a safe exit from foster care as soon as possible. The process results in frequent court contact and family decision-making meetings for parents, the child's representatives or caretakers, and court personnel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 92 – Today is \"Meck Dec Day,\" a day that commemorates the signing of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence on May 20, 1775. A date that is enshrined on the North Carolina state flag.\n\nIn this episode, we listen to a 2023 recording of Chief Justice Paul Newby explaining the significance of Meck Dec Day to an audience of law clerks and staff gathered in the Supreme Court of North Carolina’s law library.\n\nIn his remarks, Newby shares the context in which the Mecklenburg Declaration was signed, and the controversy over its authenticity.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 91 – In this episode, we feature an excerpt of an interview with the late Margaret Adams Harris (1916–2014) who worked as a prominent Guilford County attorney. Throughout her career, Harris was dedicated to public service. Most notably, she served on the Duke University board of trustees and worked to implement Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and served as chair of the Greensboro City Board of Education during desegregation. In the interview, Harris shares about attending college and law school immediately following the Great Depression, having former Chief Justice Susie Sharp as a contemporary, and balancing life as a mother and attorney.\n\n\"You're making a big commitment when you determine to be a lawyer and it becomes a major part of your life, but shouldn't be all of your life,\" said Harris on the podcast. \"You still have your family and your community to which you still have a responsibility. I think you need to face this fact and make sacrifices where necessary.\"\n\nThis interview was conducted by former Executive Director of the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism Mel Wright for the Commission's Historical Video Series. A full version of the interview can be found on the NCcourts Youtube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 90 – This episode of All Things Judicial features a panel of three experts on the North Carolina Judicial Branch: former Supreme Court of North Carolina Associate Justice and North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts Director Franklin Freeman, former Wake County Chief District Court Judge Ned Mangum, and former Wake County District Attorney Colon Willoughby. The panel discussed the history of the court system, the different levels of our courts, and expressed sincere appreciation for their time serving people through their court positions. The panel was recorded before a live audience in March 2024.\n\n\"One of the things that made me want to be a part of our court system is that it's the last place left where we can get Republicans and Democrats working quietly together trying to solve people's problems,\" said Mangum on the podcast. \"You have elected public servants who care about what they do and you never hear their names, which is the way it ought to be.\"\n\nFranklin Freeman was a senior assistant to Governor Mike Easley. Prior to that position, he served as an associate justice on the North Carolina Supreme Court and as chief of staff to Governor Jim Hunt. In addition, Freeman served as director of the North Carolina Administrative Office of Courts and as secretary of the North Carolina Department of Corrections.\n\nNed W. Mangum served as a Wake County district court judge for over 16 years, including over two years as Wake County chief district court judge. Before that, he served as Wake County district attorney and as an assistant district attorney.\n\nColon Willoughby's 27-year career as Wake County’s district attorney ranks him as one of North Carolina's longest-serving district attorneys. In addition, Willoughby served as president of the Wake County Academy of Trial Lawyers, director of the Wake County Bar Association, president of the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys, and a member of the National District Attorney’s Association board of directors.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 89 – The latest episode of All Things Judicial features an excerpt of an interview with the late Francis I. Parker who served as a Mecklenburg County attorney for over 50 years. Parker was a founding member of the Parker Poe law firm, served in WWII and the Korean War, and held the position of associate justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina. In the interview, Parker shares about his early years, his legal career in Charlotte, and outlines what professionalism means for lawyers in North Carolina’s legal community.\n\n\"A lawyer cannot have his or her ethics determined by the client, even it it means losing the client,\" said Parker on the podcast. \"If a lawyer purports to be his client's lacky, and engage in activities that he ought not to, sooner or later he's going to be in real trouble.\"\n\nThis interview was conducted by former Executive Director of the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism Mel Wright for the Commission's Historical Video Series. A full version of the interview can be found on the NCcourts Youtube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 88 – In this episode, we focus on the Chief Justice's Task Force on ACEs-Informed Courts, which released its Final Report in November 2023. Podcast guests on this episode include Task Force members: Seth Banks, elected District Attorney for Avery, Madison, Mitchell, Watauga, and Yancey counties; Judge Angelica McIntyre, Chief District Court Judge for Robeson County; and Judge Mario Perez, District Court Judge for Pitt County. This episode is hosted by Mike Silver, Training and Services Director for the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts.\n\n\"This idea of ACEs and being trauma-informed in our courtrooms is a novel concept ... it hasn't really been (holistically) applied anywhere else in this country,\" said D.A. Banks on the podcast. \"This Task Force was really at the cutting edge and I'm thankful for the leadership for pointing us in that direction.\"\n\nThe term \"ACEs\" refers to \"adverse childhood experiences\" and \"adverse community environments.\" The Task Force's mission is to understand the impact of ACEs on children and develop strategies for addressing adverse childhood experiences within our court system.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 87 – In this episode, we feature an excerpt of an interview with the late Roy W. Davis, Jr. who served as a Buncombe County attorney for almost 55 years. Davis held many prestigious positions in the legal community such as president and vice president of the North Carolina Bar Association, president of the 28th Judicial District Bar, and member of the North Carolina Board of Law Examiners. The interview was conducted in 2009 when he was awarded the Chief Justice's Professionalism Award from the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism.\n\n\"I always thought you ought to try to be an example, you ought to try to do it right, you ought to try to live to the standards of the profession at it's best,\" said Davis on the podcast.\n\nDavis attended Davidson College and the University of North Carolina School of Law. He began his legal career in the U.S. Army J.A.G. Corps in Alabama before becoming President of the Van Winkle Law Firm in Asheville, NC. This interview was conducted by Attorney Philip J. Smith for the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism. A full version of the interview can be found on the NCcourts Youtube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 86 – In this episode, we feature an interview with two former Perquimans County judges: Emergency Superior Court Judge J.C. Cole and former District Court Judge Janice Cole who also served as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina. They have a unique and interesting story as husband and wife who met while working in federal law enforcement in New York City, and as African Americans who worked as attorneys in Eastern North Carolina then held consecutive judgeships in the same judicial district. In the interview, Judge J.C. Cole shares his judicial philosophy of being strict but compassionate from the bench, and prioritizing empathy for humanity over judicial authority.\n\n\"When I talk to people, I am J.C. Cole who just happens to be a judge and not Judge Cole,\" said J.C. Cole on the podcast. \"You just have to be a human being first and not a person who seems so far and above everyone else.\"\n\nJudge Janice Cole met her husband while she worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, a job she earned through her experience as one of the first women working as a patrol officer for the N.Y.P.D. In the interview, she shares about breaking the many barriers as an African American woman during her career as a patrol officer, assistant U.S. attorney, private attorney, district court judge, and U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina.\n\n\"I felt with my ability I could overcome (sexism and racism),\" said Janice Cole on the podcast. \"When people see that you can produce, when they see you in the courtroom, when they see your ability and style ... they want somebody that they think is going to be able to help them win. Once I could show those skills then I think that broke down the barriers.\"\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 85 – This episode of All Things Judicial features an interview with Chief Assistant District Attorney Jennifer L. Martin who has served as a Forsyth County prosecutor since 1999. On the podcast, Martin shared about her upbringing in Stokes County and how the court led by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren impacted her decision to become a lawyer. Later in the episode, she explored a common theme that runs through the lives of the criminal defendants that she has prosecuted during her 25-year career.\n\n\"In my experience the most common denominator of my defendants are that they have dropped out of high school and that they have been born and live in poverty,\" said Martin on the podcast. \"I know that poverty can be a factor but it is not the defining moment of your life. Poverty does not mean crime.\"\n\nChief A.D.A. Martin has served in the Forsyth County District Attorney's Office from 1999 to the present, and teaches as a member of the extended faculty at Elon University School of Law and High Point University School of Law. She graduated in 1996 with a B.A. in English from Wake Forest University and earned a J.D. from the Wake Forest University School of Law in 1999.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 84 – This episode of All Things Judicial features an interview with District Attorney Spencer Merriweather who has served as Mecklenburg County's chief prosecutor since 2017. On the podcast, Merriweather shared about his upbringing in Alabama where as a young boy he witnessed an impactful trial in which his mother served on the jury. Later in the episode, he explained that one of the most important aspects of serving as the district attorney is ensuring that each victim's voice is heard in court.\n\n\"I don't have all the answers to the ills of the justice system but I do think it is important that people are met with a sense of empathy,\" said Merriweather on the podcast. \"It's important that people know that someone in their government is fighting for them.\"\n\nDuring his tenure as D.A., Merriweather has prioritized the prosecution of dangerous offenses by establishing and later expanding the Violent Crimes Team. In addition, he created a trauma-informed unit known as the Special Victims Team that works to seek justice for victims of domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, and human trafficking.\n\nMerriweather was sworn into office in 2017 and was subsequently elected in 2018.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 83 – The latest episode of All Things Judicial features excerpts of an interview with former Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism Executive Director Mel Wright who retired December 31, 2023. Wright became the Executive Director of the North Carolina Chief Justice’s Commission on Professionalism in November 1999, and served in that capacity until August 2017. He resumed this role from March 2019 through December 2023 and was succeeded by Lenoir County attorney Jimbo Perry.\n\n\"Professionalism is important because it deals with things such as competency, ethics, and how you represent clients the best way you know how,\" Wright said on the podcast. \"We have ethical rules that we have to abide by and that is the minimum. Professionalism is a step higher I think.\"\n\nThis interview was conducted in 2023 by the current Executive Director of the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism Jimbo Perry. A video of this interview can be found on the NCcourts YouTube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 82 – The latest episode of All Things Judicial features excerpts of an interview with former Forsyth County attorney William F. Womble (1916-2016) who was the very first recipient of the Chief Justice's Professionalism Award. He begin practicing law with Manly, Hendren & Womble immediately following graduation from Duke University School of Law in 1939. Just two years later, Womble was drafted by the United States Army to serve in WWII until the war's end in 1945. Throughout his career, he became a highly regarded attorney that championed public service and mentorship. In one notable public service role, he worked to desegregate the North Carolina Bar Association during his tenure as its president in the 1960s.\n\n\"That is something we always say to the young lawyers and it's one thing that we think has held our firm together,\" said Womble on the podcast. \"It's getting to the basics, the ideas of practicing honesty and integrity and being a student of the law. Those things don't change.\"\n\nThis interview was conducted in 2001 by former Executive Director of the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism Mel Wright. A video of this interview can be found on the NCcourts YouTube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 81 – This is a special episode of All Things Judicial where we celebrate North Carolina Constitution Day by featuring excerpts of a discussion between Chief Justice Paul Newby and former University of North Carolina School of Law Professor John Orth on the history of the North Carolina Constitution. North Carolina Constitution Day is December 18, the anniversary of the day the first North Carolina constitution was ratified in 1776.\n\n\"The Greek philosopher Aristotle defined a 'constitution' as the 'arrangement of offices in a state' and that is essentially what the state constitution does in state government,\" said Orth on the podcast. \"But that does not mention what we think of as so important which are the rights which are protected by, not created by, but protected by the state constitution.\"\n\n\"With regard to Professor Orth's question 'what is a constitution,' my response would simply be that it's a foundational social contract among 'we the people' with regard to the relationship between the people and government,\" said Newby on the podcast. \"Particularly with regard to individual rights versus the government.\"\n\nThis discussion was recording earlier in 2023 and the complete video can be found on the NCcourts YouTube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 80 – In this episode, we feature excerpts of an interview with former Randolph County District Court Judge Lillian B. Jordan. She practiced family law for 17 years and served as a district court judge and emergency district court judge. In the interview, she discussed her early life and the monumental decision to go to law school, which was rare for women at that time.\n\n\"One reason I wanted to go (to law school) was I wanted to be a role model for young women to see that women can be lawyers,\" said Jordan on the podcast. \"I happen to know of quite a few young women who did go to law school and were very successful lawyers because they did see me as a lawyer.\"\n\nThis interview was conducted in 2011 by attorney Bonnie Kay Donahue for the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism. A video of this interview can be found on the NCcourts YouTube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 79 – The latest episode of All Things Judicial focuses on Veterans Treatment Court (VTC) in District 11A which covers Harnett, Johnston, and Lee counties.

In the interview, guests discuss the court's process, the issues veterans face returning to civilian life, and Campbell shares his experience as a graduate of VTC before becoming its director.\n\n\"I was struggling with opioid addiction. I was using substances to help combat all of the craziness that was going on in my head. Subconsciously, I didn't even realize what was going on,\" said Campbell on the podcast. \"This court truly did save my life. I don't think I would be sitting here talking about any of this had it not been for this court.\"\n\nVTCs are one of six types of Recovery Courts within the Judicial Branch. These courts are designed to assist chemically dependent offenders with their court ordered treatment plans. The VTC in District 11A is one of eight VTCs in the state which have the mission to help veterans involved in the court system due to mental health disorders, trauma, and substance use. The goal of each VTC is to connect eligible veterans with benefits and treatment earned through military service.

Stevenson Crihfield from Guilford County. Crihfield practiced law for over 50 years in Guilford County and helped bring attention to mental health issues amongst attorneys. In the interview, he discussed his early life and career and shares a personal story about an attorney’s suicide that led him to focus on the issue of mental health in the legal profession.\n\n\"We did a scientific survey of the bar and what we learned was that there were an awful lot of lawyers that were not doing well in a variety of ways,\" said Crihfield on the podcast. \"11 percent of the bar reported that they had thoughts of suicide in the last 30 days.\"\n\nThis interview was conducted in 2015 by Special Superior Court Judge Andrew R. Hassell for the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism. A video of this interview can be found on the NCcourts YouTube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 77 – Each Halloween season, All Things Judicial releases a special episode called \"Fright Court,\" where the focus turns to ghostly legends associated with North Carolina's courthouses and legal community. In this year's episode, we focus on courthouse ghosts in New Hanover and Mitchell counties, and dive into the folklore of the 1866 murder of Laura Foster and subsequent trial and execution of her accused killer, Tom Dula (Dooley). This story became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon beginning in 1958 when the Kingston Trio released a murder ballad which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.\n\n\"I've always believed that the hanging of Tom Dooley here in our little town of Statesville, North Carolina is the most widely recognized execution in U.S. history,\" said Steve Hill, curator of the Statesville Historical Collection. \"Everybody wanted to make a dollar off of Tom Dooley while they could, and a lot of people did.\"\n\nThe first segment of this episode is an interview with John Hirchak, who, along with his wife Kim, operate the Ghost Walk of Old Wilmington and The Black Cat Shoppe. Hirchak shares stories about three spirits who occupy the historic New Hanover County Courthouse, and we discuss possible explanations for hauntings.\n\nThe second segment is a dramatic reading of an article published by the Mitchell County Historical Society which details firsthand accounts of seeing and hearing a ghost which haunts the historic Mitchell County Courthouse.\n\nIn the third segment, we meet Margaret Ferguson Carter Martine from the Whippoorwill Academy and Village in Wilkes County. She recounts the Dooley story and shares her personal connection to a key figure in that historic event.\n\nThen we travel to Iredell County where we meet Keith Ryan, Director of the Historic Sharpe House. He shares details about May 1, 1868, the fateful day Tom Dooley was hanged in Statesville.\n\nIn the final interview of this episode, we meet Steve Hill, curator of the Statesville Historical Collection. He provides insight into the worldwide impact of the Dooley story.\n\nYou can find out more about All Things Judicial or hear previous episodes in the Fright Court series by visiting NCcourts.gov.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 76 – In this episode, we feature excerpts of an interview with attorney Claude R. Wheatly, Jr. from Beaufort County. Wheatly was licensed to practice law in 1941 but postponed his legal career to enlist in the U.S. Army after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor later that year. Post WWII, he returned to Beaufort County where he earned recognition and praise as a general practitioner for over 70 years. In the interview, Wheatly gives advice to new attorneys and shares stories about his life and career which included an account of being held at gunpoint by a disgruntled client. The interview was conducted by attorney James T. Cheatham in 2005 for the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism.\n\n\"Just because your opponents may be experienced trial lawyers and you are a beginner, don't let that frighten you,\" said Wheatly on the podcast. \"Look into the facts of the case. Because they are experienced does not mean they are right.\"\n\nThis interview is part of the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism's Historic Video Series. A video of this interview can be found on the NCcourts YouTube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 75 – In this episode, we focus on legal deserts and the lack of access to legal representation in some of North Carolina's rural communities. Our guest is the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism's (CJCP) Co-Executive Director Jimbo Perry. In addition, we hear from attorneys Sarah Beth Withers (Beaufort) and Reatter Neal (Franklin) who share about living and working as attorneys in rural communities. In the first segment, Perry defines the legal desert issue and describes CJCP's role in recruiting attorneys and increasing access to justice in rural areas of the state.\n\n\"I've been trying to get the truth out about what is called by many a legal desert, and in my mind the truth is that these places are really a legal oasis,\" said Perry on the podcast. \"They're a place that can really capture the imagination and heart of why people went to law school in the first place.\"\n\nA \"legal desert\" is defined as a county which has fewer than one attorney for every 1,000 residents. In North Carolina, 48 counties fit this definition despite having experienced a population growth of almost one million residents over the last decade (2010-2020). One of the reasons for this effect, is that the population growth has occurred in North Carolina's 30 urban counties, with the fastest growth having occurred in the Raleigh, Charlotte, and Wilmington areas. That trend may result in 70% of North Carolina counties going without new attorneys able to provide legal services to residents in small, rural communities. But the attorneys who do locate in designated legal deserts often find high satisfaction in their careers and significant lifestyle improvements over their time spent in urban communities.\n\n\"You have control over your career. You have control over your family life. It gives you the freedom to set your own calendar and decide what kind of law you want to practice,\" said Sarah Beth Winters on the podcast. \"I don't have to put-in 80+ hours a week to create the lifestyle that I want because living in a rural community is cheaper. It's been able to give me a really strong sense of community and family that's very rewarding.\"\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 74 – In this episode, we feature an interview with Raleigh attorney Robert L. McMillan, Jr. Focusing primarily on criminal defense, McMillan was licensed to practice law in 1949 and practiced almost continuously for more than 50 years–with the only interruption being called into military service for the Korean War. During the interview, McMillan shares about his early years in Wake and Scotland counties, serving in the United States Marine Corps during WWII and Korea, and he reminds listeners that the practice of law is a professional calling. The interview was conducted by Raleigh attorneys Wade and Roger Smith in 2012 for the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism.\n\n\"The criminal defense lawyer makes his contribution to our system of government, not when he gets an acquittal for his client. He makes his contribution when he does his very best,\" said McMillan on the podcast. \"Sometimes it's an acquittal, far more often there's a guilty verdict or a guilty plea, but he does it within the confines and the framework of our system of justice.\"\n\nThis interview is part of the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism's Historic Video Series. A video of this interview can be found on the NCcourts YouTube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 73 – In this episode, we highlight Judicial Branch strategies and successes in reducing the pending case backlog in the North Carolina court system. We explore the challenges of holding court during the pandemic and the strategies implemented to reduce pending cases by 25%. This episode is hosted by North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts (NCAOC) Director Ryan Boyce and guests include NCAOC Research Policy and Planning Manager Emily Mehta, Chief District Court Judge Scott Ussery, and elected District Attorney Jon David. Judge Ussery and DA David represent Bladen, Brunswick, and Columbus counties.\n\n\"Chief Justice Newby arrived in 2021 and his first order of business was issuing a statewide order that allowed local judicial officials, like Judge Ussery and DA David, to resume jury trials,\" said Director Boyce on the podcast. \"They are the ones who knew their districts, and the Chief's vision was to give these folks the authority to hold, or not to hold, jury trials based on their districts' needs.\"\n\nWith trials postponed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pending case count peaked at 1.2 million cases. The latest statewide figures indicate that the case backlog has been reduced to 900,000, which represents a 25% reduction. State court dockets are in better shape now then they were even before COVID. Creativity on the local level is one factor credited with this success.\n\n\"We got approval to go off-site and we went five miles down the road and found a gymnasium, cafeteria, and media center, and for 11 months we held court,\" said Judge Ussery on the podcast. \"We did everything we could as the stakeholders in our community to make sure the system didn't stop.\"\n\nOther successful backlog reduction strategies included installing advanced technology in courthouses, streamlining case management processes, and relying on the Judicial Branch's most import resource–its people.\n\n\"I work around heroes and they understand that with the enormous responsibilities of this job come service and sacrifice,\" said DA David on the podcast. \"This was simply a challenge to overcome and we found a strategy to protect and serve our communities against this difficult backdrop.\"\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 72 – In this episode, we feature an interview with former North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts (NCAOC) Director Jim Drennan. Drennan was an expert on court administration issues, judicial ethics, and criminal sentencing while serving as a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Government. While there, he helped establish the Judicial College which provides education and training for judges, magistrates, and clerks of court. The interview was conducted by former NCAOC Director Franklin Freeman in 2012 for the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism.\n\n\"I have had the great privilege of working closely with people who manage the judicial system,\" said Drennan on the podcast. \"They work hard every day to make justice a reality for people in this state.\"\n\nDrennan began his career with the UNC School of Government in 1974. He taught and advised on court administration issues, judicial ethics and fairness, criminal sentencing, and judicial leadership. While on leave from the school from 1993–1995, he served as director of the NCAOC. Drennan is a graduate of Furman University and Duke University School of Law.\n\nThis interview is part of the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism's Historic Video Series. A video of this interview can be found on the NCcourts YouTube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 71 – In this episode, we focus on the life changing work of Recovery Courts located in Brunswick County. In the first of three segments, we are joined by recent recovery court graduate Dedriana Ruby Bryant and Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Jason Disbrow who discuss Ms. Bryant's journey through the Recovery Court process. In the second segment, Judge Disbrow shares about the structure, origin, and philosophy of the Recovery Courts. In the final segment, we hear excerpts from the recent Recovery Court graduation that was held on July 27 in Bolivia, North Carolina.\n\n\"What I want folks to understand is that treatment courts work because it gets to the root of the problem,\" said Judge Disbrow on the podcast. \"You're treating the whole person ... punishing someone for being addicted flies in the face of what I believe from a judicial perspective. I think they're worth it because everyone is worth trying to help.\"\n\nThere are 71 Recovery Courts in 37 North Carolina counties. They are charged with handling chemically dependent individuals in adult criminal court, juvenile, and abuse, neglect and dependency cases. Recovery Courts also serve veterans and people with mental health issues who find themselves in court. The program offers individualized treatment plans which include counseling, supervision, drug testing, sanctions, and incentives for meeting recovery goals.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 70 – This episode of All Things Judicial features a tour of the Supreme Court of North Carolina's History Room. In a 2010 interview, former Supreme Court of North Carolina Chief of Protocol and Historian Danny Moody walks listeners through the Court's 200-year history by describing many of the invaluable artifacts contained in the Court's collection. Located on the first floor of the Supreme Court Building in Raleigh, the History Room is a repository for precious works of art, historical documents and photographs, and antique furniture dating back to the court's earliest years. The interview was conducted by Raleigh Attorney Wade M. Smith for the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism.\n\n\"This is the 1779 law license of William R. Davie who founded the University of North Carolina and it is the oldest known North Carolina law license,\" said Moody on the podcast. \"It was signed by three judges (which) composed the entire North Carolina judiciary at that time. These three judges also decided the Bayard v. Singleton case, one of the more important cases in American jurisprudence.\"\n\nThis interview is part of the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism's Historic Video Series. A video of this interview can be found on the NCcourts YouTube channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 69 – In this episode, we feature an interview with Chief Justice Paul Newby and his wife, Mrs. Macon Newby. The Chief and Mrs. Newby completed a historic 100-county courthouse tour which began in Murphy (Cherokee County) in May 2021, and ended with a final stop in Manteo (Dare County) in October 2022. They greeted judges and courthouse staff at each of the courthouses to thank them for their hard work and dedication in keeping courts operational and accessible to North Carolinians. Judges and courthouse staff are essential in fulfilling the Judicial Branch's constitutional \"open courts\" mandate to provide equal justice to all in a timely manner.\n\n\"This (tour) gave us the opportunity to learn from (judges and courthouse staff). The local courthouses know much better what allows them to efficiently administer justice,\" Chief Justice Newby said on the podcast. \"We have diversity in every way you can imagine, but what we have in common is the desire of all of our judicial official and employees that their be equal justice for all.\"\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 68 – This episode features excerpts of an interview with former Judicial District 18 (Guilford County) Chief Public Defender Wallace C.

In the interview, Harrelson shares how he chose the law as a profession, the implementation of North Carolina's public defender system, and the details of one of his most memorable cases.\n\n\"(Public defenders) had to set a standard of representation that showed that you were doing what the office was set up to do–providing the best representation possible,\" said Harrelson on the podcast. \"It took a period of time to convince all the parties that the public defender program was what was needed to be spread throughout the state.\"\n\nWallace \"Wally\" Harrelson was born in Cherryville, North Carolina, and graduated from Duke University with an undergraduate degree in political science. Harrelson attended Duke University School of Law and graduated in 1962. He served as a prosecutor in Guilford County and then worked in private practice until his appointment by Governor Bob Scott in 1970 as the first Chief Public Defender in the state.

Ray with the Person County Sheriff's Office. These security professionals share personal stories and discuss a wide range of topics that include guarding against threats to courthouses and courthouse personnel, handling the media and jurors, providing first responder medical treatment, and projecting a generally positive attitude as the public's first contact at North Carolina's county courthouses.\n\n\"We don't have anything to sell, but we can sell ourselves,\" said Major Newkirk on the podcast. \"And that means a pleasant attitude because it might not be a pleasant reason why they're (at court), but we can make it a very positive interaction with people while they're there.\"\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 66 – The latest episode of All Things Judicial features an interview with Supreme Court of North Carolina Associate Justice Trey Allen. With Associate Justice Richard Dietz, Allen is one of the two newest members on the Court having been elected in November 2022. On this podcast episode, listeners will get to know Allen who shares about his Robeson County upbringing, educational and professional experiences, and his outlook on his new job of serving as a supreme court justice.\n\n\"A lot of thought and a lot of effort is required to be a good justice on our Court,\" said Allen on the podcast. \"I try to bring a sense of my own fallibility, a determination to get it right, and a strong work ethic to the job.\"\n\nAllen grew up in Robeson County, graduated from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke in 1997, and graduated from the University of North Carolina School of Law in 2000.\n\nFollowing law school, Allen spent more than four years as an officer in the United States Marine Corps which included a deployment to Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The interview was recorded in 2006 as part of the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism's Historical Video Series and was conducted by attorney Hank Van Hoy. In the interview, Brinkley shares how his career was inspired by his father's criminal defense of an African American tenant farmer before an all-white Davie County jury, and Brinkley reminds lawyers that they have a duty of public service because of their unique position as members of the Bar.\n\n\"I have always had the view that a license to practice law in North Carolina was not actually a license, but should be considered a privilege,\" said Brinkley on the podcast. \"Because of that, members of the Bar have a duty to repay the public by offering public service in various forms.\"\n\nBorn in Lexington, North Carolina, in 1926, Brinkley served in the U.S. Navy and fought in World War II and the Korean War. After returning to Lexington, Brinkley graduated from the UNC School of Law, served as a staff attorney in the North Carolina Office of the Attorney General, and worked in private practice.

Our guests are wife and husband, former North Carolina Court of Appeals Judge Lucy Inman and screenwriter and producer Billy Warden. Inman and Warden engage in an entertaining and passionate discussion about their favorite legal-themed movies, the levels of realism in courtroom drama, and why courtroom dramas have proven popular with non-lawyer audiences.\n\n\"I think the reason we like these courtroom dramas is ... lawyers and judges have so much power over our lives,\" Inman said on the podcast. \"But to see them struggle, to see them stumble, and to see them fail, reassures us that they are not as all-powerful as we might think they are.\"\n\nJudge Lucy Inman served as a judge on the North Carolina Court of Appeals from 2015–2022 and served as a North Carolina Superior Court judge from 2010–2014.

The second oldest courthouse in the state, built in 1786, is located in Beaufort County, in the City of Washington. Allegedly, this courthouse is haunted by the ghost of a defendant named Reverend George Washington Carawan, who was tried for murder in 1853. We interviewed Terry Rollins, Youth Services Librarian at the Brown Library in Washington, to get the full story about this remarkable case.\n\n\"(After the trial) people started reporting something very strange occurring in this building,\" said Rollins on the podcast. \"Those stories have persisted decade after decade, and year after year, since 1853.\"\n\nThe second segment of the podcast involves former Supreme Court of North Carolina Associate Justice George Brown, and his wife Laura Ellison Brown. The justice and his wife were local benefactors in the City of Washington, who after their deaths, bequeathed their estate to establish a public library. The Brown Library found a permanent place on the justice’s old homesite, but some report that the Browns continue to visit the library almost 100 years after their deaths.\n\nThe reports of hauntings in North Carolina's courthouses are unverified. However, witness claim that they are true. Are some of North Carolina's courthouses haunted? Listen to the podcast and you be the judge.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEpisode 48 – Each year, the North Carolina Judicial Branch recognizes Conflict Resolution Day which falls on October 20, 2022.
