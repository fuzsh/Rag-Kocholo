        "text": "When Ocala Police Department Chief Michael Balken asked this morning at OPD’s community room, “If I can get all of the mayors upfront,” six people, including Ocala’s current mayor and five predecessors, sat down to discuss their experience leading the city.\n\nThe mayors gathered at OPD at the suggestion of former Mayor Gerald Ergle.\n\nWayne L. Rubinas, a lawyer, who served as mayor from 1980 to 1988, drove to the event from his home in Tallahassee. His wife and all his children were born in Ocala, and he said the city will always have a special place in his heart. However, he remembered being called a “carpetbagger” when he decided to run because he had only lived in Ocala for seven years at the time.\n\nAccording to Rubinas, the only “arrows in the quiver” the mayor has is the “bully pulpit” and “veto power,” which he used not only to perform the largest task the mayoral position, overseeing the police department, but also preserving the aesthetics of Ocala through advocating to council to put in a tree ordinance intended to force more developers to preserve trees as well as the creation of the historic district.\n\nIn a conversation following the event, he told the “Gazette” that if a community “is not vigilant about preserving its history, it loses its common fabric.”\n\nRubinas recounted when OPD first decided to add a motorcycle unit to the fleet of vehicles. He remembered asking department leaders to find motorcycles that not only met the need of the officers but also were made in the U.S. He said it was right about the time that the popular TV show, “Chips” started. He recalled telling the chief at the time, to the laughter of the audience, “If I ever see two motorcycle police officers riding side by side, we are going to suspend the program for a while.”\n\nCurrent Marion County Commissioner Craig Curry, who served as mayor of Ocala from 1988-1989, told the audience, “I think I have a unique position in the community in that I’m not sure that there is anyone else who has served on city council, mayor and county commission.\n\n“Someone asked me this morning, ‘Which office did you prefer?’” he continued. “I said, ‘I think probably the mayor. Because number one, you really have a tremendous bully pulpit. Number two, you set your own agenda,” adding that the role had fewer Sunshine Law restrictions and the mayor could talk freely with the council members because he was not a voting member.\n\n“It’s a unique position,” he added.\n\nErgle, who served as mayor from 2001 through 2005, said he started the role with the desire to be “the people’s mayor.” He focused a lot on revitalizing downtown. He credited Ocala getting a real ice-skating rink downtown for several years after hed had seen one in Orlando.\n\n“I thought, if Orlando can freeze a rink, so can Ocala,’’ he recalled. “It brought hundreds of thousands of people downtown.”\n\nErgle said he also tried to build bridges between residents in the outlying equine community and those who lived in the city.\n\nRandy Ewers, who served as mayor from 2005-2011, encouraged Mayor Ben Marciano to be prepared to keep learning because “things are always going to change, different challenges and different opportunities will present themselves.”\n\nRueben Kent Guinn, who served as mayor from 2011 through 2023, said one of his prouder moments working with the OPD was bringing Greg Graham back to Ocala as the police chief. Graham died in 2020 in a plane crash.\n\nMariciano, a close friend of Graham, complimented Guinn, saying the decision to return Graham continued to impact the department positively because of how good Graham was at developing people.\n\nYet, the job was harder than anticipated, Marciano admitted. During the first month in office, he was faced with significant challenges, including the Paddock Mall fatal shooting that impacted so many residents. Marciano took a leadership role by making sure crisis counseling was available to those impacted.\n\n“I’m blessed to be the mayor of the best city in the country,” Marciano told the audience before turning to the former mayors, adding, “I’m sure you felt the same.”\n\n_____________________________\n\nCity of Ocala Mayors\n\n1867 – 1869 Col.
