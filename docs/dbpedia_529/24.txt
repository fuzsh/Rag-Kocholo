Treat, Richard S. "Extracts from a Civil War Diary." Naples Record. 4 March 1925 to 19 August 1925.

Resource submitted by Noah Andre Trudeau, who also wrote:

In researching archival newspapers online for a project not directly related to this regiment I came across something that seems pretty remarkable to me, the Civil War Diary for 1863-1865 written by Richard S. Treat in Company G of the 148th New York. What made it remarkable was that it was serialized over a period of 25 weeks in the Naples (New York) Record, a weekly newspaper, in the year 1925. Here's an index to that collection, with NR=Naples Record issue, and DI=diary days published in that issue. I'll also

note that the odd jump in chronology in the June 17 and 24 issues is not a typo. I found all issues using the fultonhistory site.
