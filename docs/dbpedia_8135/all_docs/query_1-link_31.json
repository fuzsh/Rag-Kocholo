It was my hobby that I found a lot of peace in. I did some work as a translator before this, but my writing was still just a hobby. In 2018, when my fiancé died, is when I started writing professionally and published my first book.\n\nWhy did you choose to write in your particular field or genre?\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by medieval times. One of my favorite movies is Braveheart and when in college, I studied ancient cultures and languages. However, that’s not the only reason I wrote this book. What got me interested in this particular story was researching my family history. I have a master’s degree in ancient languages and cultures, so when I came across the story of Princess Nesta of Wales being captured and taken to Ireland, I had to know more. So upon searching, I learned about her entire family and the very intense story of her father fighting for his kingdom.\n\nWhat is the most important thing that people DON’T know about your subject/genre that they need to know?\n\nThe most important thing people don’t know is that historical fiction is based on real history. As a matter of fact, most of this is real. The only thing that is fictional is the dialog and Rhys’ friends Aberthol and Llewelyn."
