        "text": "Born on this day 1937 in Margam, near Port Talbot\n\nAnthony Hopkins - Oscar winning actor.\n\nHopkins' schooldays were unproductive as he found that he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting, drawing and playing the piano, than attend to his studies. His life path altered at age 15, following a brief encounter with Richard Burton, who encouraged him to become an actor. To that end, he enrolled at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff and then after two years national service, he moved to London and was invited by Laurence Oliver to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. From that moment on, he was to enjoy a successful career in cinema and television, with his remarkable acting style reaching the four corners of the world.\n\nIn 1998, Hopkins gave £1m to the National Trust in order for them to buy a large piece of land on Snowdon and therefore save it from private development. To learn scripts, Hopkins reads them out loud 250 times. He also learns a new poem every week to exercise his memory.\n\nHumphrey (VI) de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford(c. 1249 – 31 December 1298) - was an active participant in the Welsh Wars, who had inherited major possessions in the Welsh Marches from his mother, Eleanor de Braose.\n\n1270 - Following the rebellion aganst King Henry III of England during the Second Barons' War of 1263–4 and the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267, at which Llywelyn ap Gruffudd was recognised as Prince of Wales by King Henry. Llywelyn had extended his territory into the Marches, taking much of de Bohun's land. Therefore much of de Bohun's focus was on reconquering these lands through private warfare against Llywelyn.\n\n1272 - While Edward I was away crusading, Llywelyn refused to pay him homage, partly because of the military actions of de Bohun, which Llywelyn saw as violations of the Treaty of Montgomery.\n\n1276 - de Bohun was present at a royal assembly where a judgment was passed against Llywelyn.\n\n1277 - Edward I declared war on Llywelyn, with de Bohun serving in Anglesey.\n\n1282 - War with Wales broke out again; this time a full-scale war of conquest. de Bohun assuming the role as Constable of England.\n\n1294–95 - de Bohun fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn.\n\nBorn on this day 1878 in Llanfihangel-ar-Arth, Carmarthenshire and brought up in Rhydlewis, near Llandysul.\n\nDavid Caradoc Evans - journalist, author and playwright.\n\nEvans's best known work is a series of short stories called My People in which he highlights the hypocrisies he sees in the piety of non-conformist Christianity with the harsh reality of people living in poverty. The work attracted savage criticism from the press at the time and they referred to Williams as \"the best hated man in Wales\".\n\nThe Gop is a neolithic mound which lies north of Trelawnyd in Flintshire. It is the biggest prehistoric monument in Wales and was probably built around 3,000BC. Excavations have indicated that it was used as a look-out or hill fort and further down the hill there are are caves where burials date back possibly to 6,000 BC.\n\nJohn Wynne (1650 – 31 December 1714) - the industrial pioneer and high Sheriff of Flintshire, was born and lived in Trelanwnyd\n\nHe had plans to turn Trelawnyd into the centre of the North Wales lead industry and an industrial town of some importance. He built houses, established a weekly market and built the Nonconformist chapel in 1701 as well as a grammar school at \"plas yn dre\". He also obtained permission to rename the village \"Newmarket\" in 1710. However his plans ultimately came to nothing, but Wynne was responsible for the village's growth and its population did top over 600 residents.\n\nRas Nos Galan\n\nThis is a race held in memory of Griffith Morgan (1700–1737) “the fastest man of his time”, known better as Guto Nyth Brân, from Llwyncelyn, near Porth. It is run every year on New Years Eve at Mountain Ash, over the course of Guto's first ever race. It has become a tradition of this race for a mystery runner to compete and over the years this has included Iwan Thomas, Linford Christie and Alun Wyn Jones At the conclusion of the race, a wreath is then placed on Guto's grave in Llanwynno graveyard. There is also a commemorative statue of Guto in Mountain Ash.\n\nIt was said that Guto's speed was first noticed, when he managed to catch a wild hare. Another legend has it that he could run the 7 miles, to the local town of Pontypridd and back home again, before his mother's kettle had boiled.\n\nSeeing his potential the local shopkeeper, Siân o'r Siop (Siân from the Shop), became his trainer and manager and organised a race on Hirwaun Common against an unbeaten English Captain, for a £400 prize. Guto won the race won easily and kept on winning, remaining unbeaten until he was 30. Over the years, Guto and Sian had fallen in love and Guto decided to retire to enjoy a quiet life with Sian.\n\nHowever, in 1737, a new champion runner had emerged, called the \"Prince of Bedwas\" and Sian persuaded Guto to have one last race against Prince, for a prize of 1000 guineas. The race was over the 12 miles from Newport to Bedwas and was a very even contest. Nearing the finish, Prince held a slender lead, however one last lung bursting effort from Guto, saw him cross the line first. However, in the celebrations after, Guto collapsed and died in Sian's arms.\n\nRowan Williams' 10 year term as Archbishop of Canterbury came to an end on 31st December 2012 and at a ceremony at Lambeth Palace, he gave the official robes that he had worn on his enthronement to the president of the National Museum Wales, where they will be displayed and will remain the property of the people of Wales.\n\nThe traditional carol \"Deck the Halls\" originates from the Welsh melody first found in a musical manuscript by Welsh harpist John Parry Ddall in 1741, It was subsequently published and named \"Nos Galan\" (\"New Year's Eve\") in 1784. Subsequently, the tune spread widely, with Mozart using it in a piano and violin concerto and Haydn in the song \"New Year's Night.\"\n\nBorn on this day 1860 in Newport.\n\nHorace Sampson Lyne - who won five caps for Wales, before retiring and becoming the WRU's longest serving president. Lyne is also notable as one of the six representatives that set up the International Rugby Board.\n\nTraditionally in the Western Church, the First Day of Christmas is Christmas Day, therefore 31st December is the Seventh Day of Christmas.\n\nOn the seventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me - Seven Swans a Swimming.\n\nSeveral species of swan are found in Wales, but it is the mute swan that is most common, its population having recovered following the ban on lead fishing weights in 1987. Small numbers of Bewick and Whooper swans, over winter in Wales, with both species specially protected due to their small and vulnerable populations.\n\nA history of Swans\n\n* In Greek mythology, the story of Leda and the Swan describes Helen of Troy as being the daughter of Zeus disguised as a swan and Leda, Queen of Sparta. Other legends refer to the otherwise silent Mute Swan singing beautifully in death, hence the phrase swan song.\n\n* A coat of arms was originally a knight's personal badge and many depicted birds especially swans. Later Henry V carried a swan on his pennon at Agincourt\n\n* From the 12th century, the mute swan was a valuable commodity and was regularly traded between noblemen. It was also a favourite food of royalty and the owners of swans were duty bound to mark them by way of a succession of unique nicks in the beaks of their birds. It was and still is the duty of the Royal Swanmaster to organise the annual swan-upping and traditionally the British Monarch retained the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water. Today it serves as a check on the health of the swans\n\n* Swansea is thought not to be named after the Swan, even though Swansea City F.C have adopted the Swan as their emblem and nick name. The name is considered to be of Viking origin.\n\nBorn on this day 1921 in Blaenavon, Monmouthshire\n\nKen Jones - arguably, Wales’ greatest ever all-round sportsman.\n\nJones was not only a Welsh and Lions international, who won 44 consecutive caps for Wales and whose most famous score came in 1953, against the All Blacks. His pick up and try from a Clem Thomas kick gave Wales a famous victory and is still the last time we beat New Zealand. He also triumphed as a sprinter at the Olympic Games of 1948, when he was part of the Great Britain 4x100 metres relay team that won silver and later won a silver medal in the 220-yard sprint at the 1954 European Championships, when he had the honour of captaining the British team.\n\nBorn on this day 1931 in Dyserth, near Rhyl.\n\nSir John Houghton - A world-renowned expert on global warming, who was the lead editor and co-chair of the Nobel Peace Prize winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) scientific assessment working group.\n\nHe was brought up as an evangelical Christian by devout Christian parents and strongly believes in the connection between the environment and Christianity. He is currently an elder at Aberdovey Presbyterian Church.\n\nAmong his career achievements are;\n\n* Professor in atmospheric physics at Oxford University.\n\n* Chief Executive of the Met Office.\n\n* Founder of the Hadley Centre, which is one of the United Kingdom's leading centres for the study of climate change.\n\n* Chairman of the John Ray Initiative, an organisation which seeks to connect the environment, science and Christianity.\n\n* Founder member of the International Society for Science and Religion.\n\nIn 2013, Sir John was anounced as an Advisory Board member for Sure Chill Technology, a technology that allows refrigerators to stay at 4C for more than 10 days without power and is used mainly in Africa' to store vaccines and other medical supplies.\n\nTwm Sion Catti\n\nTwm Sion Catti, was born Thomas Jones in Tregaron around 1530, the illegitimate son of Catherine Jones and the local squire.\n\nTwm was brought up as a Protestant, so when the Catholic, Mary I became Queen, he went into hiding and initially earned his living by robbing the rich of West and Mid Wales. However as the law officer started to close in on him, he fled to Geneva and only returned when the Protestant Elizabeth I ascended to the throne and gave him an official pardon.\n\nOne tale tells how when a farmer was looking for him for stealing one of his bullocks, Twm disguised himself as a beggar and gave the farmer directions to Twm's house and offered to mind his horse whilst he went in. Twm then, not only galloped off on the farmers horse, but convinced the farmers wife that her husband was in serious trouble and that he needed to return with money. Suitably convinced the farmers wife gave Twm the money, who the rode off for London\n\nTwm is also remembered for the caring way he treated his many victims, who is reported to as firing an arrow at, to pin them to their saddle rather than killing them. Twm arch enemy was the Sheriff of Carmarthen, whom he hid from in a cave on Dinas Hill, near to the village of Rhandirmwyn.\n\nLater in life, Twm changed his ways and married Joan, a wealthy heiress in theTregaron area and even became a respected Justice of the Peace.\n\nChristmas Customs in Wales.\n\nThe Mari Lwyd.\n\nThis was the Welsh tradition during the Christmas season of carrying a horse-figure from door to door by a group of Mari Lwyd singers. Although now extinct in most parts of Wales, it is still performed in some parts of Glamorgan., where it is not yet completely extinct. The group would often be invited into the house, where they would be given food, beer or money and then entertain the household with a farewell song.\n\nTraditionally in the Western Church, the First Day of Christmas is Christmas Day, therefore 30th December is the Sixth Day of Christmas.\n\nOn the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave to me - Six Geese a Laying.\n\nThe Brecon Buff is one of the few native breeds of geese in the UK, however, many species of wild geese over winter in Wales. However, the Greenland white fronted goose is becoming increasingly rare, with its last remaining population in Wales to be found on the Dyfi Estuary.\n\nA brief history of the goose;\n\n* About 3 000 years ago, the ancient Egyptians deliberately fattened geese for eating.\n\n* The Greek poet Homer mentions Goose Husbandry in 700BC.\n\n* The Romans in c 625BC recorded an efficient system for keeping geese for their meat, fat and feathers. They were also used as guard animals, famously saving Rome from the Gauls in 390, by raising the alarm.\n\n* In the early middle ages, geese were an important part of the European peasant economy, as they were cheap to keep and gained weight quickly.\n\n* In the 18th Century, geese accompanied cattle, when Welsh drovers took them to English markets. They were fitted with protective boots and were fast travellers as they could graze as they moved. There was also an increasing market for their feathers for use as ink quills.\n\n* During the 1930’s and 40’s goose fat was used as a remedy for colds.\n\nIvor the Engine was first released on television on 28 December 1959.\n\nIvor the Engine is a children's television series that tells of the story of a little green locomotive living in the \"top left-hand corner of Wales\". His friends include Jones the Steam, Evans the Song and Dai Station. The series was later revived in 1975 when new episodes in colour were produced for the BBC.\n\nThe series was written and narrated by Oliver Postgate, with his friend Peter Firmin providing the artwork, which originally consisted of cardboard cut-outs painted with watercolours. It was produced in a disused cow shed at Firmin's home near Canterbury, with the sound effects being endearingly low-tech, for example, the sound of Ivor's puffing was made vocally by Postgate himself.\n\nPostgate drew inspiration for the series from a World War II encounter with Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railway fireman, who described how steam engines came to life when steaming them up in the morning. Postgate decided to locate the story to North Wales, as he considered it more inspirational than the flat terrain of the English Midlands.\n\nBorn on this day 1861 in Swansea\n\nDavid 'Dai' Gwynn - former Wales rugby international, whose playing career was notable for being in the side for Wales's first home game, at St Helens's against England in 1882 and then in 1890, being in the team that beat the English for the very first time. Gwynn later moved north and played for Oldham and when he retired, he became heavily associated with Swansea Cricket Club and umpired for the club.\n\nCharity fundraiser Andrew Craig made his 52nd ascent of Snowdon, on 28th December 2011 to end his marathon of climbing Snowdon every week for a year.\n\nCraig from Caernarfon braved snow, ice, fog, heavy rain and blistering heat to raise money for Breast Cancer. It was the idea of his wife, Lynne, who suggested he should do the challenge after one of her best friends died from the disease and another had been recently diagnosed.\n\nO Little Town of Bethlehem (in Wales)\n\nThe Welsh Bethlehem is a remote and peaceful village that lies in the foothills of the Brecon Beacons in the Tywi Valley, to the northeast of Llandeilo, However in December every year, thousands of people visit the village, to receive a Bethlehem postmark on their Christmas cards, which results in the local post office, that usually only opens on Tuesday, having to open for six days of the week.\n\nThe Welsh Bethlehem is overlooked by an old Iron Age fort, Carn Goch, with both the Welsh castle of Dinefwr and the Norman fortress of Carreg Cennen located nearby. The name Bethlehem came into common parlance in Wales once Bishop Morgan translated the Bible into Welsh in 1588 and while the village was originally known as Dyffryn Ceidrich, the name Bethlehem was soon given to the local chapel and by the time of the Methodist Revival in the mid 19th century, the village was also being called by the name of its chapel.\n\nTraditionally in the Western Church, the First Day of Christmas is Christmas Day, therefore 28th December is the Fourth Day of Christmas.\n\nOn the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me - Four Calling Birds\n\nCalling appears to be an Americanisation of Colly, the Old English term for ‘black,’ Colly birds, therefore, refer to the common blackbird.\n\nThe blackbird was the fifth most spotted bird in the 2013 Big Garden Birdwatch in Wales.\n\nThe Common Blackbird was seen as a sacred in Greek folklore and like many other small birds in medieval times, it was trapped as an easily available addition to the diet. A sixteenth-century amusement was to place live birds in a pie.\n\nThe Dan yr Ogof Caves were first discovered on 27th December 1912, by Tommy and Jeff Morgan, who were trying to find the source of the river Llynfell that flowed through their farm land at the base of the cliffs at Dan yr Ogof.\n\nThe brothers had tried previously but had been prevented from penetrating far into the mountain by a large lake. Undeterred they returned with coracles, candles, a piece of rope and an old revolver, using arrows in the sand to find their way back. They crossed not one lake but four and discovered a labyrinth of caves, passages and chambers, a 330 million years old wonderland of stalactites and stalagmites. They were eventually stopped by a small passage that was too small to crawl through.\n\nNot long afterwards, they started charging a small entrance fee to take people into the caves by candle light and opened the caves properly to the public in 1939. However, during World War II, the government closed the caves down and used them to store ammunition and works of art. Water from the caves was also piped to Swansea when the water mains were damaged by bombs during the blitz on the city.\n\nIn 1963, a local girl called Eileen Davies, a member of the South Wales Caving Club, managed to crawl further into the caves, to discover over 10 more miles of caves and passages, with expert cavers believing that there are still more to discover.\n\nBorn on this day 1931 in Swansea.\n\nJohn Charles - former Wales soccer international, who is considered by many to have been the greatest footballer that Britain ever produced. He was a world class centre-half or centre-forward, who could also play full-back or midfield, if required. At 6ft 2ins and 14 stone, Charles had an tremendous physique, but he was also extremely agile for a big man. He possessed a delicate first touch, good control and was masterful in the air.

It lies on a steep ridge near Llandeilo overlooking the River Tywi.\n\nA timeline of the history of Dinefwr Castle;\n\nc. 871 - Traditionally, a castle was first constructed by Rhodri the Great.\n\nc. 900 - Dinefwr became the chief seat of Rhodri's grandson Hywel Dda, the first ruler of the Kingdom of Deheubarth and also most of Wales.\n\n1155 - 1197 - Rhys ap Gruffydd (the Lord Rhys), ruler of Deheubarth rebuilt the castle.\n\n1197 - On Rhys ap Gruffydd's death the castle passed to his son Rhys Gryg.\n\n1233 - When Rhys Gryg died his son Rhys Mechyll inherited Dinefwr and his other son Maredudd inherited Dryslwyn, only five miles away.\n\n1244 - When Rhys Mechyll died, his son Rhys Fychan allied with King Henry III of England against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd who was supported by Maredudd.\n\n1256 - Llywelyn ousted Rhys Fechan from Dinefwr giving Maredudd control of Dinefwr.\n\n1257 - Rhys Fychan accepted Llywelyn as overlord and had his lands, including Dinefwr, restored. Maredydd, in turn switched sides and paid homage to Henry III.\n\n1277 - King Edward I of England invaded Wales and captured Dinefwr.

They were first domesticated from the Indian and Southeast Asian red jungle fowl and appear in China about 6000 BC and in India about 2000 BC. There are artistic depictions of the bird adorning Egyptian royal tombs and they are recorded as accompanying Roman armies, where apart from being an important part of the diet, their behavior was carefully observed before battle, with a good appetite indicating a likely victory. According to Cicero, when one contingent of hens refused to eat before a battle at sea in 249 BC, the angry consul tossed them into the sea. History records that he was defeated.\n\nThe rooster plays a crucial role in the Gospels in helping to fulfill the prophecy that Peter would deny Jesus “before the cock crows.” and Pope Nicholas I, ordered in the ninth century that the rooster should be symbolized on top of every church as a reminder, which is why some churches have cockerel-shaped weather vanes.\n\nThe fact is that the male of the species can be quite a fierce animal, meant that they have been bred and trained for fighting and in the parts of the world where it is still practiced, it has claims to being the world’s oldest continual sport. Cock-fighting was outlawed in Britain in 1849 and the idea of exhibitions took root as a way of continuing competition, with the first Standards being produced in 1865 for just a handful of breeds to try to maintain uniformity. Then at the turn of the century, with the importation of breeds from the continent and America, the number of traditional and hybrid breeds increased dramatically."
