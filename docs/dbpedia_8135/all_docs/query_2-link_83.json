        "text": "Most of the information we have today about the Princes of Wales comes from a manuscript called âBrut y Tywysogionâ.\n\nâBrut y Tywysogionâ tells the story of the Princes of Wales from 682 to 1282 â 600 years of history.\n\nBy around 1086, the Normans had completely conquered England, but it took them several centuries to conquer the whole of Wales.\n\nDuring this time, the Age of the Princes (1063-1283), the Welsh had many strong and important leaders.\n\nThe Normans came to Wales from France and were the first people to conquer Wales successfully since the Romans. It took them 200 years to succeed.\n\nIn 1066, William the Conqueror came from Normandy in France to conquer the lands of the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nOne of the first things he did was to build castles along the border between England and Wales, and along the south Wales coast.The Normans wanted to conquer Wales in its entirety.\n\nOne example of these castles is Chepstow Castle.\n\nBut the leaders of the small kingdoms that existed in Wales at the time had different plans, namely, to fight the Normans.\n\nIn one battle, Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd lost her head as she led an army against the Normans in Kidwelly in 1136. Although she died in the battle, she inspired the Welsh to further rebel, and her son Lord Rhys became one of Walesâ strongest leaders.\n\nRhys ap Gruffudd was a prince of an area called Deheubarth, one of the Welsh kingdoms. Rhys ap Gruffudd eventually became known as Lord Rhys.\n\nRhys ap Gruffuddâs parents were:\n\nGruffudd ap Rhys (prince of a part of Deheubarth)\n\nGwenllian ferch Gruffudd (Owain Gwyneddâs sister)\n\nHenry II, the King of England, attacked Deheubarth four times to try and keep Rhys under control. Eventually, Henry II and Rhys came to an understanding after Rhys gave two of his sons to the King as hostages, and Rhys kept his kingdom.\n\nRhys celebrated the completion of the reconstruction of Cardigan Castle in stone in 1176 with a grand Christmas festival. This was the first âeisteddfodâ in Welsh history.\n\nLord Rhys was a talented and astute prince. He loved the arts and was a brave warrior.\n\nBut during his final years his ambitious sons rebelled against him, and after his death, the principality of Deheubarth was shared between them.\n\nDress\n\nDressing in the right way was important to the Princes of Wales.\n\nTheir clothes were made of the most expensive and fine materials. They used something called heraldry; a special dress worn by certain families.\n\nThey often decorated their costumes with pictures that linked them to brave people who had worn them in the past, for example a picture of furious lion.\n\nThis ensured that they looked very brave and important.\n\nPoets\n\nThe Princes of Wales paid poets to sing and recite poems about them.\n\nEach prince had his own personal poet, who lived in court with him so that he could sing about the life and character of the prince.\n\nThe poets performed their poems to the accompaniment of the crwth, harp and pibgorn. People would then recite the poems outside the court, as a way of spreading news about the prince and for people to learn how wonderful their leaders were.\n\nReligion\n\nReligion was very important to the Princes of Wales.\n\nIn the Age of the Princes, if people had enough money, they paid someone to pray for them.\n\nThe princes also paid for churches and monasteries to try and secure a place in heaven.\n\nThey could also pay to be buried in a holy place.\n\nAnother famous Welsh Prince was Llywelyn ap Iorwerth. He was born at Dolwyddelan Castle in 1173.\n\nHe was a prince of Gwynedd but wanted to be a prince on the whole of Wales. To do this, he had to gain the kingdom of Deheubarth.\n\nLlywelyn received the support of the king of England when he married King Johnâs daughter Joan in 1205. But King John wasnât happy when Llywelyn won the Powys area in 1208, so the king attacked Gwynedd in 1211 and 1212.\n\nBut Llywelyn regained his lands and retained his status in Gwynedd and elsewhere in Wales. In a âparliamentâ in Aberdyfi in 1216, Llywelyn called the princes of Wales together to pay homage to him, that is, they had to recognise that Llywelyn was the leader of them all.\n\nIn 1218, in the Worcester Treaty, Henry II also had to recognise that Llywelyn I was Walesâ leading prince.\n\nLlywelyn won the title âLlywelyn the Greatâ, which inspired the career of his grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd."
