Unknown\n\nCadell+\n\nTudwal Gloff+\n\nRhodri Mawr King of the Britons\n\nBorn: Abt 820\n\nMarriage (1): Unknown\n\nDied: 878 aged about 58\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nSource: http://www.ancientwalesstudies.org/id55.html\n\nSee also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodri_the_Great:\n\nRhodri ap Merfyn (c. 820Â– 878), later known as Rhodri the Great (Welsh: Rhodri Mawr), succeeded his father, Merfyn Frych, as King of Gwynedd in 844. Rhodri annexed Powys c. 856 and Seisyllwg c. 871. He is called \"King of the Britons\" by the Annals of Ulster. In some later histories, he is referred to as \"King of Wales\", although the title is anachronistic and his realm did not include southern Wales.\n\nThe son of Merfyn Frych, Rhodri inherited the principality of Gwynedd on his father\"s death in 844, and Powys from his uncle. He proceeded to marry Angharad, daughter of the ruler of Seisyllwg, which he duly inherited on the accidental death of his brother-in-law in 871.\n\nThis enlarged kingdom covered all of northern and central Wales, stretching down to the Gower peninsula in the south.\n\nRhodri\"s fame sprang from his success as a warrior after his many battles with the Vikings. Anglesey bore the brunt of the attacks, and it was there in 856 that Rhodri won his great victory over Horn, the leader of the Danes.\n\nIt was not only from the west that the kingdom of Rhodri was threatened. By becoming the ruler of Powys, his mother\"s land, he inherited the old struggle with the kingdom of Mercia and in 878 Rhodri and his son, Gwriad, were killed in battle against the English.\n\nApart from these bare facts, little information about Rhodri survives to the present. Yet his prestige was such that to be \"of the line of Rhodri\" was a powerful factor in later Welsh power struggles.\n\nRhodri's grandson Hywel Dda built on the foundations he had laid, creating the kingdom of Deheubarth. This extensive geographical unit with its common legal system was, arguably, the closest there has ever been to a unified and independent Welsh state.\n\nRhodri married."
