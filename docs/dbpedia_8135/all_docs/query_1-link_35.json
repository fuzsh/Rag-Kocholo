        "text": "Pedeir Keinc y Mabinogi or 'The Four Branches of the Mabinogi', surely the work of an author from Gwynedd or northwest Wales, are twelfth-century tales of love and adventure; and one character in them is Gwydion, a magician of Gwynedd. Amongst his exploits is disguising himself as a poet from Glamorgan (in South Wales) and thereby deceiving a Gwynedd sorceress, who is fooled into welcoming him as a storyteller and entertainer. In a similar way he had already tricked a prince of Dyfed (or southwest Wales). Although pure legend, the episodes have a semi-historical parallel in bards who unwittingly produced conflict between Deheubarth (southern Wales) and Glamorgan. According to the antiquary Rice Merrick (d. 1587), the feud was the result of royal passion, as at Troy. Its Helen was the wife of Iestyn (d. 1100?), Lord of Glamorgan; its Paris was Rhys (d. 1093), Prince of Deheubarth. Rhys became obsessed with Iestyn's wife after hearing poets describe her. Yet she was loyal to her husband as Helen was not to Menelaus. Disappointed in his lust, Rhys began threatening his neighbour. Hence an antagonism between Dyfed and Glamorgan that led to disaster for both. The 'Glamorgan bards' in these two narratives are the theme of this paper, with three main conclusions: (a) The sources are evidence neither for the eleventh century nor for the special excellence of verse in Glamorgan; (b) Glamorgan's representation in the Four Branches is consistent with authorship by a member of Gwynedd's ruling house who (through marriage) lived in Dyfed; (c) there is, in contrast, no link whatever between the tales and the Celtic monastery of Clynnog (in west Gwynedd), despite assertions by some.\n\nAs a hub of Irish Sea communication and interchange, the Isle of Man has been home to many cultures and languages over the centuries – Gaelic, Norse, English. But in the eighth century, the Venerable Bede was quite certain that Man was an island of the Britons (meaning ‘Welsh’). Bede was not alone in perceiving Man in this way. Embedded within the vast and labyrinthine corpus of genealogies surviving from medieval Wales is authentic information concerning the Brittonic dynasties that ruled Man during the eighth and ninth centuries. There is evidence that these same dynasties drew on Irish legends preserved in the famous ‘Book of Invasions’ in order to place Manx dynastic history within the panorama of Irish and Brittonic legendary history. This article explores these themes and suggests that more can be said about Manx history during these murky centuries than is usually thought possible.\n\nThis dissertation examines the first generation of Latin chronicles patronized by the Norman conquerors of southern Italy and Sicily in the eleventh century: Amatus of Montecassino’s Ystoire de li Normant, William of Apulia’s Gesta Roberti Wiscardi, and, Geoffrey Malaterra’s De Gestis Rogerii Comitis et Roberti Guiscardi Ducis. These chronicles constitute meaningful assertions regarding the nature and actuality of Norman lordship in the region at a time of great precarity for the Siculo-Norman imperial project: the succession of the second generation of Norman lords. Indeed, I argue that these early texts must be examined in their pre-kingdom context, as the heavy work of conquest is often clearest in spaces of imperial precarity and anxiety. In addition, this dissertation is grounded in an understanding of the world-creating function of historical texts. It contends that each chronicle’s curated historical world reveals the ways in which the eternally-incomplete process of conquest continuously remade the collective identities, affinities and alterities, that gave shape to the socio-political, historical, emotional, and geographical landscapes of Norman Italy and Sicily. It first explores the internal logic of each history (and its respective historical world) individually, focusing on the specific preoccupations and aims of each historian, in order to explore their implications for current historians’ understanding of medieval conquest. These three distinct and interconnected worlds are then brought into conversation with each other in order to examine the logic of the Norman conquest more broadly. In particular, this dissertation contends that the process of conquest embodied in these histories was grounded in the twinned forces of alienation and appropriation as the chronicles worked to naturalize the bodies, emotions and lineage of the foreign conquerors within the landscape while simultaneously alienating their local subjects from it. In doing so, the chronicles obscured the rupture inherent in conquest behind the mask of continuity provided by these acts of naturalization."
