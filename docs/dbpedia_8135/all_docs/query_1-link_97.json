        "text": "The names of these fevers are problematic and do not seem to reflect contemporary fever terminology. For that reason, I have chosen to translate them literally rather than attempting to associate them with any particular medieval disease category. Pughe and Diverres translate teirton vud as ‘latent fever’. Teirton is borrowed from the Latin tertiana (‘tertian fever’), that is ‘fever attributed to the humour choler becoming putrified… fever attacks … that recur every second day’ (Norri, ‘tertian fever’), and mud means ‘mute’. Pughe takes teirton to refer to ‘fever’ in general rather than to tertian fever in particular, and he may be correct in this, however I have used the term ‘tertian fever’ throughout as I cannot be certain of the identification of this condition. For a discussion of these names see Morfydd Owen, ‘Names for sicknesses and disease in medieval Welsh’, in S. Zimmer (ed.), Kelten am Rhein: Akten des dreizehnten Internationalen Keltologiekongresses, vol. 2 (Mainz am Rhein: Verlag Philipp von Zabern, 2014), pp. 205–16, especially p. 211.\n\nPughe and Diverres render teirton gryd as ‘intermittent fever’. Cryd means ‘shivering, shaking’, although it is also used to refer to fever in general. See Book 2/32, 6/53, 6/54, 6b/53, 6b/54, 6b/55, 8/9, 8/15 and 9/61 for remedies for cryd (‘fever’). The analogues for the remedies suggested for this fever in the recipes at Book 1/10–12 suggest that they are meant to treat a tertian fever – that is, an intermittent fever caused by putrefying yellow bile. It may be that teirton gryd represents an independent Welsh disease name. The assonance between mud and cryd may also be significant, and may have played a role in the word choice here.\n\nI have followed Pughe and Diverres in rendering brat gyfarfod as ‘ephemeral fever’ – that is, a ‘fever of short duration (in most texts said to last only one day); thought to be caused by bodily spirits disturbed by excessive heat’ (Norri, ‘ephemera’). According to John Davies of Mallwyd’s 1632 Dictionarium Duplex, bratgyfarfod indicates febris ephemera, and Thomas Wiliems of Trefriw describes it as a diaria febris (GPC, ‘bradgyfarfod’). Literally meaning ‘a meeting of betrayal, a conspiracy’, it would seem to indicate a fever of sudden onset or short duration, although this is far from certain.\n\nDiverres renders gwall dwymyn tentatively as ‘cerebral fever’ based on the context, rejecting Pughe’s interpretation of this ailment as ‘typhus’. Used adjectivally before a noun in close compound, gwall can mean ‘poor’ ‘bad’, ‘unwise’, ‘ill’, ‘false’ or ‘accidental’ (e.g. gwallgyngor ‘bad counsel’, gwallsynnwyr ‘insanity’, gwalltrefn ‘disorder’, gwalltan ‘accidental fire’, later developing into ‘devouring fire, consuming fire’). Of these compounds, gwalltan is the only one to appear before the seventeenth century, and it occurs in the legal texts (GPC ‘gwall’). Gwall twymyn could thus mean something like ‘false warm fever’, or, under the influence of gwalltan, something like ‘consuming warm fever’, which is how I have interpreted it.\n\nPughe and Diverres identify iewydd as butcher’s-broom, and GPC defines it as ‘unknown kind of plant’, and analyses it as a combination of the elements iau (‘liver’) and gwŷdd (‘wood, shrub’). It does not appear in the medieval glossaries, and I have nothing upon which to base a translation, so I have left it.\n\nPughe and Diverres translate creulys uendigeit as tutsan based on WB (1813) and creulys war as dwarf elder. Creulys fawr is the usual term for dwarf elder in the glossaries, and this is how I have interpreted it as well. Creulys fendigaid does not appear in them, although plant names incorporating the element bendigaid (bendigaidlys, dail y fendigaidd) appear for tutsan from the fifteenth century, and the sixteenth-century glossary in BLAdd15045 has crevlvs vawr vendicaid for dwarf elder. It may be that creulys war was originally a gloss on creulys uendigeit, both referring to dwarf elder: this is how I have interpreted it. Note that this doublet (a’r greulys uawr a’r greulys uendigeit) appears again in the RBH copy of Book 1/13, and may indicate that the RBH scribe has mistaken a gloss for another herbal ingredient on two occasions. Note also that the analogous remedies at Book 6/8 and Book 8/20 contain crelys and crewlys vendigeit respectively, arguing that this is the same herb. Middle English analogues to that recipe suggest that the herb in question is dwarf elder.\n\nPughe translates pybyrllys as ‘pepper mint’. I have interpreted it tentatively as Spanish pellitory based on the medieval glossaries. Nevertheless, there may be some confusion in those particular glossary entries, as ‘pepper wort’ does not seem an apt description for the chamomile-like Spanish pellitory. Pughe may be correct here, otherwise this name may be meant to indicate another type of ‘pepper-wort’ such as dittander.\n\nGPC gives a range of meanings for bolwst including bellyache, gripes, colic, rupture and hernia (GPC ‘bolwst’). The seventeenth-century individual responsible for the English-language notes throughout the medical texts in RBH (described by Daniel Huws as a poor hand. See his ‘Llyfr Coch Hergest’, p. 25) interpreted it as dropsy. Pughe and Diverres translate bolwyst as ‘abdominal complaint’ based on the two elements of which it is composed, bola (‘belly’) and gwst (‘pain, difficulty, malady’). Pughe, following the seventeenth-century annotator, interprets the different types of bolwyst as different types of dropsies and translates bolwyst lyn as ‘ascites’, bolwyst goludd as ‘peritonitis’, bolwyst belleneu as ‘abdominal tumor’ and bolwyst wynt as ‘tympanites’. I have interpreted bolwyst as a compound of bola (‘sack, cod, scrotum’) and gwst (‘pain’) and interpreted it as ‘hernia’, because the four Welsh names seem to correspond with the description of different types of hernias found in treatments of this condition (see the discussion in ‘Further Notes’ for such treatments).\n\nPughe and Diverres interpret the form gwrinc in RBH as bog-myrtle. The forms vrum and vrm in Rawl and BLAdd are difficult to interpret. The latter may in fact be vrin (‘urine’), but this does not explain the former. Both may represent the adjective gwrm (‘blue’), used as a feminine noun, and referring to a blue flower or plant. I am unable to offer any further suggestions for the form vrum, so I have left it.\n\nPughe and Diverres translate RBH’s vusyc as ‘moss’ by interpreting it as an error for misyc and positing it as a form of the word mwsogl (‘moss’). The forms in Rawl (vussic) and BLAdd (uussuc), and those at Book 1/14, indicate that the form in RBH is not a mistake, but rather that it was meaningful to all three scribes, although that meaning is not apparent today. I have left the word as it is in the Welsh text rather than accept Pughe and Diverres’s suggestion, because, as well as the violence done to the word itself, this suggestion also means that all three scribes have interpreted the masculine mwsogl as a feminine noun.\n\nBerw (lit. ‘boiling’) can refer to the state of boiling, a boiling liquid or the bubbling or foam that arises during the process of boiling. Given the following condition (tra gafer, ‘while it can be had’) I have interpreted berw here as the short-lived product of the process of boiling and translated it as ‘foam’.\n\nMagl is borrowed from Latin macula and retains a similar range of meanings. The primary meaning (‘spot, blemish, stain’) is retained in the numerous remedies for magl ar y llygad (‘a spot on the eye, cataract’). See Book 4/18, 7/9, 8/11, 9/36 and J/11 for these. The secondary meaning (‘snare, noose, trap, fetter’) may be related to this, and refers to material that is spotted or blemished, i.e. with holes. Thus medieval Latin macula refers to netting, mesh, and mail armour (DMLBS ‘macula’). Where magl does not specifically refer to an eye blemish, I have taken it in this second sense, to refer to some sort of netting or mesh material, in this case being used as a restraint or a truss. See Book 3/7 for another example of magl being used in this way.\n\nThe remedies distinguish between two types of milk, that is llaeth (‘milk’) and llefrith (‘fresh milk’). The Welsh translation of John of St Paul’s Flores Diaetarum has llaeth for lac (‘milk’), which it describes as cold and wet in nature. The Welsh translator uses the word llefrith to translate lac recens (‘new milk’), which is distinguished from lac in being hot in nature. See T. Lewis (ed.), A Welsh Leech Book, or Llyfr o Feddyginiaeth (Liverpool: D. Salesbury Hughes, 1914), p. 68 for the Welsh text, and Elena Parina, ‘A Middle Welsh Translation of Flores Dietarum’, Indo-European Linguistics and Classical Philology, 19 (2015), pp. 623–9 for a discussion of the relationship between the Welsh and Latin texts.\n\nThis form does not appear in any of the medieval glossaries and its meaning is unclear. Pughe and Diverres translate it as ground-ivy, but the latter notes that D. Silvan Evans interprets it as creeping persicaria or knotgrass based on the identification of other canwraidd forms with members of the genus Persicaria L., in combination with the descriptor rhedegog (running or creeping). The medieval plant-name glossaries seem to use canwraidd to refer to plants identified as mugworts, including mugwort, red mugwort, and tansy. ‘Creeping mugwort’ may refer to a plant in this category, but it is not clear which one.\n\nI have followed Diverres here in translating taraw ar as ‘mix with’ rather than as ‘add to’. BLAdd may preserve the more correct reading, in which the bark is to be pounded with the hands before being added to the liquid, rather than the whole concoction being mixed with the hands as in Rawl and RBH.\n\nThe end of this recipe in Card has been replaced by the end of another recipe, as it is a cure for haemorrhoids, not maladies of the eye and sight. In RBH the remedy ends with dietary advice for the patient to ensure he has regular bowel movements, which is more appropriate and probably correct. See the note in the Welsh edition for the text.\n\nMan has a wide array of connotations, including ‘spot, blemish, stain, mark, pimple, boil, swelling’ (GPC ‘man2’). I have interpreted it as ‘boil’ due to the directions given in recipe 2/5 for man gwedu y bwryo y dam (‘a man which has expelled its contents’). This indicates a matter-filled swelling, and also agrees with the description of man which accompanies a Latin charm in Card, rac y mann a phob ryw gyuot o’r a uo ar dyn (‘for man and every type of swelling that might be on a person’, p. 1).\n\nJones translates gwaetlys as knotgrass. Pughe and Diverres translate RBH’s uedlys as meadowsweet, interpreting it as meddlys (‘meadow-wort’). I have interpreted BLAdd’s vetlys as gwaedlys based on the reading in the similar recipe in Book C/1. See Index 2 for an explanation of gwaedlys as vervain, although note that this identification is uncertain, and it may also be meant to represent eyebright. The Middle English analogue given in ‘Further Notes’ argues for the former.\n\nThe form vennwen is not immediately comprehensible. Diverres, following Pughe, takes it to represent mennwen and interprets it as a copying mistake for meiwen. He translates this as thorn-apple based on WB (1813). The thorn-apple originates in North America and is not a native British plant. It is also highly poisonous and would not be suitable for applying to the teeth. See D. Bown, The Royal Horticultural Society Encyclopaedia of Herbs, revised edition (London: Dorling Kindersley Ltd, 2014), p. 190 for information on this plant. I have interpreted the form as mennwen for meinwyn (‘a fine linen cloth’). This interpretation is also supported by the analogue provided in the discussion in ‘Further Notes’.\n\nPughe and Diverres interpret craf y geifir as ramsons. See Index 2 for an explanation of this herb as honeysuckle. According to the glossaries, it would also be possible to interpret this herb as annual or dog’s mercury, but the poisonous nature of this herb and the analogues provided in ‘Further Notes’ argue against it.\n\nDiverres interprets the RBH reading atrwm as the name of an astringent. Pughe translates it as ‘natron’, i.e. a soda ash mined from Egyptian deserts used primarily in glass-making (Lev, pp. 118–19). I have translated it as ‘atrament’, that is vitriol, because, despite the toxic nature of this substance, it was used in remedies to combat worms. See the discussion in ‘Further Notes’ for examples.\n\nPughe and Diverres translate ammwydon bron as ‘mammary glands’, while Jones translates the form mwydon assen found in the version of this triad at Book 7/4 as ‘the soft parts between the ribs’. Amwydyn (pl. amwydon) seems to be a variant on mwydyn (pl. mwydon), which stems from a root meaning ‘pith, soft core’. This seems, on comparison with Book 7/4, to be a reference to the soft tissue of the rib cage, as Jones surmised, and this is how I have interpreted it as well.\n\nThe word llyngeranc seems to be a compound of llyn (‘liquid, water’) and cranc (‘cancer’), and I have taken it to refer to a cancerous tumour filled with a liquid substance. The similar remedies at Book 4/5 and Book 8/10 as well as the analogues in the note indicate that this remedy is meant to treat a cancer.\n\nPughe translates gwilammec as ‘feasting’, while Diverres interprets it as a growth on the eye. William Salesbury defines it as ‘sore yeyes’ in his 1547 dictionary, while John Davies of Mallwyd defines it as conjunctivitis or glaucoma in 1632. Thomas Jones defines it as a cataract in his 1688 dictionary, and John Walters describes it as a blood-shot or a haw in the eye in 1770. See GPC, ‘gwilammec’ for these. Given the confusion about the nature of this condition, I have translated it as ‘sore eyes’ following Salesbury.\n\nThis refers consistently to the membrane around the brain, which is not a bone. It may be that the scribe of RBH has changed cryadur to iat (‘cranium’) to correct this. The use of iat is also in keeping with the assertion in RBH that none of these bones are with a person when he is born, as the bones of the head have not yet knitted together, although the dura mater is certainly present.\n\nThe introduction in Rawl does not make mention of the Physicians, merely stating that the texts had been collected together trwi borth Duw goruchaf (‘through the help of almighty God’). This is a direct verbal echo of the longer preface found in BLAdd and RBH. Rawl has a second introduction which does mention the Physicians at f. 26r: ‘Llyma gan borth Duw goruchaf geluydyt a gynullwt o dysc Medygon Myduei, a phrovadwy yw’ (‘Here with the help of almighty God is the art that has been collected together from the learning of the Physicians of Myddfai, and it is proven’). This introduction appears at the beginning of a selection of recipes from Books 5, 6 and 7 as well as several unique recipes which appear in this edition under the title ‘Rawlinson Unique’. The recipes from Book 5 and Book 6 in this section differ from the main versions of those books, and seem to have been reworked, or they may represent a different translation of the same material.\n\nJesus 22, ff. 1r–v: ‘Llyma rosyn y uengineth o dysc Medygon Myuei, a [ph]rofadwy eu bot yn wyr, n[id] amgen no Rywallon ved[yc] a’y veibyon, sed ynteu y rra[i] hynny, Kadwgo[n], [G]rufut, ac Einon. Hyn o lyuyr a dyl[ai] pop medyc y wybot yn [gyff]redyn, a’y gadw ganthaw yn da rac ovyn pallv o’[e] geluydyt, megys dallav y klaf o’e wall ef … (‘Here is the rose of medicine, from the learning of the Physicians of Myddfai, and it is proven that they are true, namely, Rhiwallon the physician and his sons, that is those men, Cadwgon, Gruffydd, and Einion. Every physician should know this book generally and should keep it with him well in case his art fails him, such as blinding the patient through his error …’). I have supplied the text in brackets at some points where the manuscript is illegible.\n\nRhys Gryg (d. 1234), the son of Rhys ap Gruffudd of Deheubarth. After many years of conflict with the sons of Gruffudd ap Rhys over the control of parts of Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, Rhys Gryg was confirmed as lord of Ystrad Tywi, including the castle of Dinefwr, by Llywelyn ap Iorwerth in his gathering held at Aberdovey in 1216. See J. B. Smith, ‘Gruffudd ap Rhys (d. 1201)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, January 2008) (http://www ​.oxforddnb ​.com/view/article/11700, accessed 9 November 2016).\n\nThe reading in RBH is more accurate here. Breint (‘status, honour’) generally refers to an individual’s status, while dylyet refers to his rights, what is owed to him. Here, the physician is owed this payment, which is based on services rendered, not on his status. For these terms see Dafydd Jenkins, Hywel Dda: The Law (Llandysul: Gomer, 1986). I am grateful to Dr Sara Elin Roberts for clearing up this point for me.\n\nThe adjective gwlyborog (‘watery’) may refer to the condition of the eye, i.e. that it is watery, or it may refer to the nature of the humour causing the condition, i.e. caused by excess phlegm, or perhaps excess red humour (blood). Analogues to this recipe indicate that it is meant to treat watering eyes caused by an excess of humours in the head, either phlegm or blood.\n\nYsceueint can mean ‘lung’ or ‘lung disease’. My interpretation of ysceueint as pneumonia is based on the description of the symptoms, and similar descriptions in contemporary English and Latin medical texts. Gilbertus Anglicus describes pneumonia as being caused by the three humours that dwell in the lungs: phlegm, choler, and black bile. This may be what the three types of ysceueint described here are meant to represent, with white pneumonia being that caused by phlegm, and black pneumonia that caused by black bile.\n\nPriddell means ‘earth, dirt, dust’, but also ‘earthenware vessel’. Pughe interprets this passage as recommending a laxative to the patient, while Diverres questions whether the patient was supposed to be lying on the ground during treatment. I have interpreted it as ‘earthenware vessel’ and taken this instruction to apply to the cordial rather than to the patient. This word is also used at Book 5b/31 where padell and krochan are found in other manuscripts, both of which refer to vessels.\n\nPughe suggests sharp dock for twrch, while Diverres interpret it as tutsan. Twrch does not appear in the medieval glossaries, but later dictionaries have dail y twrch for tutsan and llysiau’r twrch for white briony. See ‘tutsan’ in Index 2 for examples. I have translated this herb as tutsan rather than white briony because of white briony’s violent purgative qualities. This remedy is to be given after an emetic and thus a further emetic would not be called for. Nevertheless, the identification of twrch is uncertain here and may require revision.\n\nPughe translates ysgeueint gornwydoc as ‘pulmonary abscess (empyema)’. I have interpreted it more literally as ‘ulcerous pneumonia’, a condition commonly dealt with in medieval medical manuals. This condition was also known as ptisis or consumption, and it was believed to be caused by ulcers on the lungs which prevented them functioning and allowing heated vapours to leave the body, thus causing fever. It was normally treated through diet and environment, although strengthening tonics were also prescribed. See Demaitre 2013, pp. 221–30.\n\nPughe translates llyngranc as ‘crusted scall’ and Diverres translates it as ‘goitre’. The word is a compound of llyn (‘liquid, water’) and cranc (‘cancer’), and I have taken it to refer to a cancerous tumour filled with a liquid substance. The similar recipe at Book 8/10 as well as the analogues in the note indicate that this remedy is meant to treat a cancer.\n\nThat is, from the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (September 8) until Candlemas (2 February). There must be some confusion in the source text of all three copies of this recipe. BLAdd has the spider bite being poisonous for the best part of the year, from the Feast of the Nativity (8 September) until the feast of Mary in August, that is, the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August), while Rawl has the spider bite being poisonous during the roughly three-and-a-half weeks from the Feast of the Assumption (15 August) until the Feast of the Nativity (8 September).\n\nPughe and Diverres interpret this plant name as roec taking the initial ‘r’ as part of the name rather than the definite article, and translate it as stinking goose-foot, perhaps based on the forms rhogai, rhoglus in WB (1813), from arogl (‘smell, stink’), which refer to this plant. The anonymous reader of this volume for the University of Wales Press suggested that it may be a reference to heather based on the form ehöeg (‘heather-coloured, purple’) which, according to GPC, also occurs as hoec (GPC ‘ehöeg’). I am grateful for this suggestion, which I reproduce here.\n\nPughe and Diverres translate magyl as ‘seton’ (one of many possible meanings of this word). It is difficult to understand how the juice of a plant might be used to form a seton, and the recipe states that the leaves are to be used to break the magyl, not to form it. For this reason I have chosen to translate magyl as cataract here. While the symmetry of the text is lost, it makes more sense, it reflects the most common meaning of magyl, and there is no guarantee that recipes such as this were meant to be symmetrical.\n\nThe meaning of these items is uncertain. Diverres suggests that uagla is a form of bagl (‘crozier, cross’), and translates o uagla as ‘by the power of’. He also suggests that these items may contain the kabbalistic formula AGLA. A similar charm in the margin of Rawl supports this as it asks the person to carve phrases beginning with ‘on agla’ into apple rounds for the patient to eat. See the ‘Further Notes’ on this recipe for that text.\n\nThe identification of this herb is uncertain: the version of this remedy at 7/13 calls for violet, but analogues for this remedy use mugwort. The recipe at 5/13 claims that medyges is similar to amranwenn (‘mayweed’). William Salesbury identifies the type of mugwort known as artemisia tenuifolia or matricaria as phenicul y cŵn or amranwen in his Llysieulyfr, both of which refer to mayweed (LlS, p. 18). It may be that medyges is meant to represent matricaria, that is a type of artemisia which is similar to mayweed. A scribe behind the reading at 7/13 has substituted the more familiar (if incorrect) violet for medyges, causing the confusion that we now see.\n\nJones translates idwf as ‘gangrene’. English analogues for recipes treating iddwf, as well as the referents of the Old Irish term idu, from which the Welsh is borrowed, indicate that it should be understood as gout. While Old Irish idu carries the primary meaning of ‘pain’, in medical contexts it is used consistently to translate the term artetica passio (‘gout’). See the Irish translation of Rosa Anglica for examples (Wulff pp. 264 and 316). I am grateful to Stefan Schumacher and David Stifter for pointing out that Welsh iddwf is a borrowing from Irish, not a cognate. The possible context of such a borrowing is deserving of further investigation.\n\nJones translates canker as ‘cancer’. The explanation of this condition as clefyt a ys y kic i gilyd (‘the disease in which the flesh consumes its own’) indicates that this should be understood as a cancrene, that is, gangrene (Norri, ‘cancrene’), rather than cancer. Cancer was often confused with cancrene in medieval texts. See Demaitre, ‘Medieval Notions of Cancer’, for examples. Lanfranc of Milan describes cancrene as round ulcers that ‘ben foule & comeþ of dedinge of þe skyn, for þe natural spiritis comen not þerto’. He identifies a corruption that takes over the patient’s entire limb as ‘herpes estiomenus, þat is as miche to seie as etyng him-silf’ (Fleischhacker, p. 293). The phrases clefyt a ys y kic i gilyd and the related condition y kic a ys y llall (‘the flesh which eats the other’), which appear in Book 10/34–8 and 10/45 seem to be attempts to render this condition of herpes estiomenus or estiomene, that is, the flesh that eats itself. For a discussion of this condition see Alessandra Foscati, Ignis sacer. Una storia culturale del ‘fuoco sacro’ dall’antichità al Settecento (Florence: SISMEL, 2013). I am grateful to Dr Foscati for making this work available to me.\n\nJones suggests cumin for this ingredient (BLAdd’s kofui) based on the reading in Llanstephan 182. The reading in Card (koeyn) is also difficult, and both may be the result of an unrecognised abbreviation. The fact that both begin with a ‘k’ suggests that these represent a borrowing from English, or perhaps Anglo-Norman. Analogues suggest that this ingredient should be some sort of resin, perhaps colophony, which is a resin produced from turpentine. The version of this recipe found in Heinrich, pp. 189–90 contains this ingredient.\n\nJones interprets Card’s scoparis calamite as two items, broom and calamint. The fragmentary nature of the Cardiff manuscript at this point makes this reading understandable. The gloss on this substance in BLAdd (‘blessed resin’) indicates that the item is a gum or a resin. The version of the ‘Gratia Dei’ recipe in Hunt’s Anglo-Irish collection of recipes (1990, p. 247) indicates that the resin storax calamite was included in some versions of this recipe.\n\nJones translates crauanc y llew as monkshood based on a single entry in Thomas Lloyd’s c.1730 dictionary (GPC ‘crafanc’). Monkshood is a poisonous plant, and unlikely to have been recommended for consumption in this way. The glossary entry in Llanstephan 82 suggests buttercup for this ingredient, although it may also be meant to refer to pes leonis or lady’s-mantle. Buttercup is an irritant and is an unexpected ingredient in such a remedy, but neither is lady’s-mantle usual here, as this was revered as a treatment for wounds and not generally recommended to treat coughs.\n\nAnalogues for the recipe at 4/27 which advises using medyges to see whether a patient will live or die indicate that it should be interpreted as a type of mugwort. William Salesbury identifies the type of mugwort known as artemisia tenuifolia or matricaria as phenicul y cŵn or amranwen, both of which refer to mayweed (LlS, p. 18). It may be that medyges is meant to represent matricaria, that is a type of artemisia which is similar to mayweed.\n\nI have translated gwaew as ‘pain’ here rather than ‘sharp pain’ as this seems to be a treatment for a specific condition in which the word gwayw (lit. ‘spear’) is standing in for Latin passio, that is sciatica passio, or pain in the sciatic nerve originating in the lower back (Norri, ‘sciatica passio’). Latin passio (and ME passioun) carries the primary meaning of ‘pain’. In medical contexts however, ME passioun carries the primary meaning of ‘sickness, specific morbid condition of body or mind’, with ‘pain’ as a secondary meaning. It also refers to a ‘sore’ or ‘an aching area on the body’, as well as being used in a number of specific disease names (Norri, ‘passio’ and ‘passion’). See Book 5/44 for another example of gwayw for passio with reference to a specific disease name, that is, passio artetica or gout, and Book 8/3 for an example of gwayw for passio referring to a physical sore.\n\nThe prefix dya- in dyalaw indicates that that is a reference to a compound medicine composed around one main herbal ingredient. I have suggested dialoes, that is a compound based around aloe, but it may also be meant to represent dialtea, a compound based around marsh-mallow (see Book 7/19 and Book 8/24). This identification is uncertain: such medicines are usually taken internally, and it is unusual to see them used as an ointment, as in this remedy. However the use of aloe as a purgative to remove excess blood in Lanfranc of Milan’s advice for treating this condition may also argue for dialoes. See the discussion in ‘Further Notes’ for this advice, and MED ‘dia’ for further examples of such compounds.\n\nThe meaning of this word is not apparent. It may be related to cymhibau (‘lungs’ or ‘pipes’, although John Davies of Mallwyd also suggests ‘fistulae’): this word appears elsewhere in our corpus referring to the lungs (Book 3/9). It may be meant to refer to a lung disease. The other word for ‘lung’ in this corpus (ysgy-faint) also refers to a lung disease, which I have translated as ‘pneumonia’ based on analogues to the description (see Book 3/9 for this recipe). As I have been unable to find any analogues to this recipe, I have not ventured a translation for kymhybys.\n\nThere may be some confusion here as the egwyd refers to the bones of a horse’s leg between the fetlock and the hoof (the pastern), while morddwyd generally refers to the thigh. I have translated it as ‘haunch’, perhaps indicating that the marrow is to be taken from the back legs.\n\nA recipe in the sixteenth-century Welsh Leech Book tells how to clarify honey through heating it, being careful not to let it boil, and skimming the scum off the top. The text goes on to explain that this honey is useful in making every type of medicine because it will never harden (Lewis, §140).\n\nShoes were used in medieval medicine: the component parts (leather, arnament, wax, pitch) are also found in many remedies. However lludw llopaneu may also represent a mistranslation of Middle English sho asshe, that is, not ‘shoe ash’ but rather ‘she ash’, a particular variety of ash tree which was char-acterised as feminine. See MED ‘assh(e’ and the discussion in ‘Further Notes’ for examples.\n\nThe readings in BLAdd and Rawl are difficult to interpret and may indicate dependence on a common source. The scribe of Card has interpreted this ingredient as ‘seaweed’, and that is how I have translated it. The scribe of the sixteenth-century Welsh Leech Book has understood this ingredient as morđynad gwnion (‘white horehound’), which may be the correct interpretation (Lewis, §26; see also Lewis, §210).\n\nJones translates gwaw idwf as ‘pain from gangrene and swelling’. I have rendered it as ‘gout’ based on the interpretation of gwayw iddwf as a rendering of Latin passio artetica or ‘gout’. See Book 5/14 for another example of a likely use of gwayw to render Latin passio. Recipes treating iddwf or gwayw iddwf often correspond with those treating gout in Middle English and gutta in Latin. I have translated gwayw iddwf as gout rather than arthritis because while both terms describe specific modern-day conditions, the former was also used as an umbrella term for those illnesses caused by the dripping of the humours down the body into the joints, thus encompassing all types of arthritis and joint pain as well as gout proper (Demaitre 2013, p. 323). While Latin artetica also covered this semantic ground, modern English ‘arthritis’ does not.\n\nJones transcribes this as ord mel and conjectures that it may be a combination of Latin ordeum (‘barley’) with English ‘meal’. I am unable to offer any suggestions for ordwel, unless it is meant for cordwal (‘cordovan leather’), but this seems unlikely. The differences between the text in Card, Rawl and BLAdd (which has been overwritten in a later hand) may indicate that all three were dealing with a single source which was difficult to interpret at this point.\n\nJones translates Card’s reibellis as rheinberries. The scribe of Rawl took the second ingredient to be bellys. MED has a possible use of bellys to mean poppy, but that identification is uncertain (MED ‘bellys’). Alternatively, it may represent the Latin bellis, referring to daisy. The differences between the text in Card, Rawl and BLAdd (which has been overwritten in a later hand) may indicate that all three were dealing with a single source which was difficult to interpret at this point.\n\nDiverres assumes that tan gwyllt corresponds with Middle English ‘wild fire’ which can refer to a number of skin conditions (MED ‘wīlde fīr(e’) and translates it as erysipelas, while Jones renders it as gangrene. A copy of this recipe in the fifteenth-century manuscript Jesus 22 has y taan bendigeit here (p. 142), that is, ‘blessed fire’, which seems to be a rendering of ignis sacer or St Anthony’s Fire. Ignis sacer can also refer to gangrene. See the note at Book 5/1 for details and references.\n\nThe word ayrbrown is otherwise unattested, making identification difficult. The translation follows the reading irfrwyn (‘fresh rushes’) in Card rather than brytwn (‘southernwood’) in RBH; brwynen appears in the glossaries for several Latin terms for rush (biblius, cirpus, iuncus). See Index 2 for these. Nevertheless, it may be that the RBH reading is correct, or that the editor of the RBH version has interpreted this ingredient as southernwood with good reason, as there are analogues for treating paralysis with southernwood. See the discussion in ‘Further Notes’ for examples. Ayrbrown may also be an attempt to render ambrotanum, the Latin for this herb.\n\nBLAdd’s llaeth guew is difficult to interpret, and may represent an unfamiliar, idiosyncratic, or dialect form. The scribes of Rawl and Card have replaced this ingredient with llaeth geiuyr (‘goat milk’). which may indicate that it was not familiar to the common source of this section of those two manuscripts. Nevertheless, the corresponding recipe at Book 8/63 (found in BLAdd and Rawl) also calls for llaeth gueu, which indicates that it was a meaningful phrase. Pughe translates RBH’s llaeth geyueu as sweet milk, while Diverres renders it as curdled milk. Neither provides an explanation for his translation: Diverres’ interpretation may be based on the verb ceulaf (‘to curdle’) but the soft mutation here is unexpected. The version of this remedy in the sixteenth-century Welsh Leech Book has lefrith kroew (‘sweet fresh milk’) for this ingredient (Lewis, §245). I have interpreted guew as an attempt to render gwiw (‘proper, worthy, fine’) and translated it as ‘fine milk’. It may be, however, that this is incorrect, and that llaeth gwew refers to a specific type or state of milk which has since become unfamiliar.\n\nDiverres notes that the normal usages for taro ar (‘strike, throw, hit upon’) make this verb difficult to interpret in the context of the recipes. He normally translates it as broyer (‘crush’), and occasionally as malaxer (‘mix’) depending on the context (see p. 23 n. 6 for his explanation). Neither of these usages are recorded elsewhere. Jones translates taro ar as ‘put with’ (p. 389) or ‘cast upon’ (p. 379). In a similar way, I have taken taro in one of its regular senses, ‘to throw upon’, and interpreted it as a direction to throw the herbal ingredients on the liquid ones, and translated it as ‘add to’ throughout.\n\nDiverres and Jones identify gwenyn as balm. While the Greek name of this herb does mean ‘bee’, and the Middle English term for it was ‘bee-wort’, it is unlikely that a Welsh audience, reading gwenyn would come up with balm, or any other herb, rather than bees. See ‘melilot’ in Index 2 for the Welsh bee-wort (gwenynllys). Bee ashes were used in medieval medicine, for example, in a remedy to remove hair in Peter of Spain’s Thesaurus Pauperum (Treasury, p. 9).\n\nThis phrase could also have the opposite meaning (‘for an impediment in defecation’), which would make it a remedy for constipation rather than diarrhoea. The version of the remedy at 6b/45 and that found in the sixteenth-century Welsh Leech Book suggest that it should be seen as the latter.\n\nPughe and Diverres identify this herb as tarragon based on the RBH form dragrans which they interpret as tragrans, and Jones translates Card’s dragans as dragonwort. See Index 2 for an explanation of dragans as dragon arum, although note that it may also refer to common bistort. This herb may have been unfamiliar to the scribe of BLAdd who has interpreted it as fragans (‘strawberry’). Analogues indicate that the scribes of Card and RBH are correct, and that this ingredient should be dragans.\n\nThe first of these texts seems to be a paraphrase of Constantine the African’s book of simples known as Liber graduum. The second is Liber de virtutibus herbarum which was erroneously ascribed to Albertus Magnus. For this text see Isabelle Draelants (ed.), Le Liber de virtutibus herbarum, lapidum et animalium (Liber aggregationis). Un texte à succès attribué à Albert le Grand (Florence: Sismel – Edizioni del Galluzzo (Micrologus Library 22), 2007). For a transcription of both these texts and a French translation see Diverres, pp. 126–37. Diverres noted the source of the first of these texts, but not the second.\n\nThe version of this remedy at 4/27 calls for an herb called medyges, which seems to refer to a type of artemisia or mugwort, which would accord well with the analogues to this remedy. The presence of violet here may be due to the actions of a scribe who has substituted a more familiar herb name from his own dialect for the less familiar medyges.\n\nThe Latin texts are a paraphrase of Constantine the African’s book of simples known as Liber graduum. The second is Liber de virtutibus herbarum which was erroneously ascribed to Albertus Magnus. For this text see Isabelle Draelants (ed.), Le Liber de virtutibus herbarum, lapidum et animalium (Liber aggregationis). Un texte à succès attribué à Albert le Grand (Florence: Sismel – Edizioni del Galluzzo (Micrologus’ Library 22), 2007). For a transcription of both these texts and a French translation see Diverres, pp. 126–37. Diverres noted the source of the first of these texts, but not the second.\n\nI have translated gwaew here as ‘sore’ rather than in its more usual meaning of ‘pain’ as this recipe seems to be describing the gwaew as something with a physical presence on the body to which this ointment can be applied. This seems to be another example of gwaew (lit. ‘spear’, later developing into ‘sharp pain, shooting pain’) taking on the connotations of Latin passio/Middle English passioun, which has a similar range of uses. See the note at Book 5/14 for further examples.\n\nAlso known as isinglass, this is an adhesive made from the swim bladders of fish, and was often used in plasters and wound-healing as it could be moulded to the flesh and would then dry to form a hard surface. The GUL Hunter 95 Antodotarium includes fish glue in a list of ‘regeneratiue medicines in depe olde sores þat ben chosen and experte’ (f. 166r, MC), while the Book of Operacion in the same manuscript describes how a broken nose should be set with a linen cloth which has been dipped in fish glue (f. 113v, MC).\n\nI have translated cornwyt as ‘boil’, despite the fact that I have translated man in recipe 8/2 in the same way. Like man, cornwyd has a range of meanings including ‘boil, abscess, sore’; however the claim found in the herbal Campau’r Cennin (‘the Virtues of the Leek’) that the juice of the leek is good y aedduedu cornwyt (‘to mature a cornwyd’, BLAdd f. 72v) indicates that it is some sort of boil or sore that can come to a head, rather than an open ulcer.\n\nThe identification of this blue stone is uncertain. GPC suggests either turquoise or copperas, i.e. blue vitriol, for glasuaen, both of which occur in the form of blue stones. While turquoise was noted as a precious stone with healing properties, I have not come across its use in powdered form in this way. It is more likely that this substance is a reference to copperas or iron sulphate as this mineral is found elsewhere in this corpus as a treatment for corroded flesh or gangrene. While the logic of its application to a boil is clear, the point of ingesting it is not as obvious. It may also be that this ‘blue stone’ was intended to refer to lapis lazuli, although the logic of its inclusion in a remedy to treat a boil or swelling is not clear.\n\nGloes can have many meanings including ‘pain, swooning, epilepsy, convulsions’. I have interpreted it as ‘vomiting’ here based on its usage in other texts in the corpus of medieval Welsh medical texts. It is used in the text Rhinweddau Bwydydd to translate vomentes, and in the translation of Agnus Castus found in the fifteenth-century manuscript Peniarth 204 to render Middle English castyng. The analogues given in ‘Further Notes’ also argue for this interpretation.\n\nThe nature of this disease is unclear, as I have been unable to find analogues for this remedy or the following one. Callon may refer to the belly, entrails, womb, stomach, or heart. Diseases of the heart could encompass anything from heartburn to ‘cardiacle’, a disease characterised by heart tremors, but in most cases the heart was implicated in producing fevers. See Demaitre 2013, pp. 230–8 for discussion. It may be, however, that these remedies are meant to treat some sort of digestive problem or diarrhoea. A remedy in the sixteenth-century Welsh Leech Book for y flix (‘flux’) describes that condition as haint calon (Lewis, §471).\n\nGwenithfaen (lit. ‘wheat-stone’) refers to granite today, but it is not clear when it became associated with that stone. GPC describes it as a hard, granular stone, and this may be what the gwenith (‘wheat’) element in the name refers to, possibly reflecting the granular appearance of granite. However the earliest references to gwenithfaen in GPC all seem to indicate a stone specifically used to heat liquids. The sixteenth-century Welsh Leech Book contains directions to heat a liquid a gwenithfaen brwd (‘with a warm gwenithfaen’), and Thomas Lloyd describes it as ‘a stone that bears the fire’ in his 1730 dictionary (GPC ‘gwenithfaen’). For this reason, I have translated gwenithuein as ‘heating stones’.\n\nLlysseu meir may be a misunderstanding of consolida maior, which normally refers to common comfrey, while pot marigold is consolida media. Common comfrey was known as a bone-knitting herb. The herbal Agnus Castus recommends that the root be roasted and eaten to heal internal injuries and notes ‘þis herbe helyth brokyn bonys’ (AC, p. 180). Recipe 8b/54 has celidonia mawr here, which may be a misunderstanding of consolida maior, with the scribe having missed the abbreviation con. A similar mistake occurs in Book 5/1, where the scribe of Rawl misinterprets the abbreviation for con and renders what was probably consolidon maior (‘common comfrey’) as y sylidon maior (‘greater celandine’).\n\nThe scribe of RBH interprets the herb name in his source as consolida maior (‘common comfrey’), probably correctly. The difference between Card and RBH here may be due to a misinterpretation of a Latin abbreviation, with the scribe of Card having missed the abbreviation con. A similar mistake occurs in Book 5/1, where the scribe of Rawl misinterprets the abbreviation for con and renders what was probably consolidon maior (‘common comfrey’) as y sylidon maior (‘greater celandine’).\n\nIt is difficult to know, in the absence of analogues, whether this remedy is meant to treat cancer or gangrene. The first term (cankyr) is used to refer to both cancer and gangrene, while the second (y crank, lit. ‘the crab’) refers only to the former.\n\nCallon can refer to the heart, belly, entrails or stomach. This remedy is meant to stimulate the appetite, which suggests that it should be interpreted as ‘stomach’ here. See Book 5/22 and Book 8/50 for other remedies treating callon which may refer either to the heart or to the belly.\n\nThis could refer to the dog-rose or to the sweet-briar. The Middle English version of this recipe has ‘crop of red brer’ for this ingredient. According to MED, red brer refers to dog-rose, but several examples given by the editors equate this herb with eglantine, that is, sweet-briar (MED ‘brēr’).\n\nJones translates frangk a cens a rosin as ‘frankincense and incense and resin.’ While cens is used on its own to refer to incense on two occasions in this collection (10/13 and 59), the compounds frangk a sens (10/11, 21 and 47) and frangk encens (10/58) indicate that when combined with the element frangk, this should be considered as a single item and translated as frankincense. It is unclear to what type of incense cens may be referring when found on its own. It may also be referring to frankincense. There does not seem to be a good reason for preferring ‘resin’ to ‘rosin’ as a translation of rosin. The latter, being a brittle substance, is much more amenable to being pounded into a powder than is resin\n\nJones interprets bwys orpiment as bwys o’r piment and translates it as ‘a pound of all spice’. Piment is a spiced wine: the fact that a pound of it is called for makes it unlikely that this is what the recipe is referring to. Orpiment is a yellow sulphide mineral which was often used in medieval medicine to treat cancers and festering wounds, often in combination with quicklime.\n\nJones translates cleuyt … o grawn as ‘suppurating diseases’. While this conveys the literal meaning of crawn (‘pus, festering’), it does not convey the meaning of what is being expressed here. Analogues to this passage indicate that it is a discussion of the different types of fistulas (MED ‘festre’). Like Middle English festre, it is apparent that Middle Welsh crawn can refer to both festering and fisula (Norri, ‘fester’).\n\nIf my translation is correct, this recipe contains vervain twice. This may be a reflection of the two types of vervain mentioned by Pliny and recorded in subsequent herbals. The glossary in Card also notes two types of vervain, a white and a blue. It may also be the case, however, that the second (gwaetlys wenn) refers to another herb: in the Welsh glossaries, eyebright is given the names gwaedlys fawr and gwaedlys fechan. One glossary, however, has y waydlys wen as a possible name for this herb (Peniarth 204). See Index 2 for these examples.\n\nThis could also refer to garden chervil, which also appears as cerfoile in Middle English (MED ‘cerfoile’). I have translated it as honeysuckle as this ingredient is commonly found in the Middle English versions of this remedy, while garden chervil is not. It also agrees with the opinion of the individual responsible for the sixteenth-century marginalia.\n\nThe grain was both a unit of weight and of volume. When used as a liquid measure, the grain represented an amount of liquid equal to the weight of a grain or a barleycorn, in practice a drop. See R. E. Zupko, ‘Medieval Apothecary Weights and Measures: The Principal Units of England and France’, Pharmacy in History, 32 (1990), 57–62 [PubMed: 11622729]; 58 for this measure.\n\nLlwydi (‘greyness’) usually refers to mildew or mould, but as honey does not normally develop mildew or mould, I have interpreted it here as the white foam that tends to form on the surface of the honey when stored as the air bubbles in it are released.\n\nThe term llawen orawenus is a formulaic expression describing happiness that occurs in a number of literary texts. In the fourth branch of the Mabinogi, it describes the men of Gwynedd returning home having killed their southern rival Pryderi. See I. Williams (ed.), Pedeir Keinc y Mabinogi (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1930), p. 73 for this text. It is also used in Brut y Brenhinedd, Ystoria Bown de Hamtwn, and Saith Doethion Rhufain. See GPC ‘gorawenus’ for further references.\n\nSee Index 2 for an explanation of gwaetlys as vervain, although note that this identification is uncertain, and it may also be meant to represent eyebright. Neither herb is generally known as a ‘bloodwort’, and neither is reputed to be effective in stopping bleeding."
