        "text": "According to Wikipedia Angharad was a fairly common name for medieval Welsh royal and noble women.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angharad1\n\nThat means that any writer interested in medieval Welsh history is likely to have read of one or more women named Angharad. Any writer who sets a story in a society resembling medieval Wales is likely to give his female characters names based on medieval Welsh female names including Angharad.\n\nSince the Welsh royal and noble families intermarried, anyone living in the prsent who can trace their ancestry to any medieval Welsh royalty and nobility are likely to be descended from at least one woman named Angharad.\n\nFor example Angharad ferch Meurig was the wife of King Rhodri the Great (c. 820-878) and thus the ancestress of most of the medieval Welsh kings.\n\nAngharad ferch Owain ap Edwin of Tegeingl married King Gruffudd ap Cynan of Gwynedd (c. 1055-1137) a distant descendant of Angharad ferch Meurig and Rhodri the Great, and was the mother of several children including King Owain Gwynedd whose children included Iorwerth, father of Llywelyn The Great, father of Angharad ferch Llywelyn who married Maelgwn Fychan Deheubarth and had children who married, and were descended from three women named Angharad.\n\nLlywelyn the Great had another daughter Elen who married secondly Sir Robert De Quincy and was the ancestress of many English nobles including the mothers of Richard Plantagenet Duke of York (1415-1460) and Henry VII.\n\nLlywelyn the Great had another daughter Gwladus Ddu who married secondly Ralph de Mortimer and was the ancestress of many English nobles including Richard Plantagenet Duke of York (1415-1460), who was the first Yorkist claimant to the English throne.\n\nLlywelyn the Great had another daughter Elen the younger who married secondly Domnall I, Earl of Mar, and had a daughter Isabella who married King Robert the Bruce and had a daughter Marjorie who was the mother of King Robert II the first Stuart king of Scotland.\n\nSo this means that any person who is descended from Welsh royalty and nobility, and any person descended from Scottish kings beginning with Robert II (reigned 1371-1390) and any person descended from English kings after Edward IV (reigned 1460-1483) are descended from one or more women named Angharad. And those groups include most people descended from late medieval English and Scottish nobility and many people descended from European royalty of the Renaissance and later periods.\n\nCertainly many thousands of persons living today can trace their ancestry to women named Angharad.\n\n."
