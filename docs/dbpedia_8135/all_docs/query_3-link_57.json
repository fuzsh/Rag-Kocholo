        "text": "Dinefwr Castle was a stronghold of the Deheubarth, the medieval kingdom of south-west Wales. It was the legendary seat of King Hywel ap Cadell (c. 880-950 AD), better known as Hywel Dda ('Hywel the Good'), who first codified traditional law into the Laws of Hywel Dda. Prince Rhys ap Gruffydd (c. 1132-1197) built some of the castle. He is best known as patron of the 1176 Eisteddfod - the first known incarnation of the most important Welsh-language cultural festival, which is still held annually. The castle is managed by Cadw and sits within The National Trust’s Dinefwr Park; home to the ancient White Park Cattle. These beasts reputedly sprang from Llyn y Fan Fach, and inspired a poem by Gillian Clarke (b. 1937). Whilst in the area, pop in to Wright’s Food Emporium in Llanarthney, which offers a great selection of local produce."
