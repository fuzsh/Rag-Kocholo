        "text": "If you still use twitter, you may have noticed discussions among the writing community regarding how best to start your latest work in progress. Lots of theories prevail, but often the best way to get ideas on how to “break the ice” on a story is simply to read the opening lines of existing books.\n\nFor me, I tend to use two or three strategies, depending on the book. Most of my biographies employ Prologues as introductions. These are usually set after the death of the biography subject (the exception being “Empress Matilda of England” which opens with Thomas Becket arriving at the White Tower to visit his pal, King Henry II Plantagenet). The biography subject is introduced in these prologues through discussion between historical persons, many of them part of another biography I’ve written – but not always! When I do not use a prologue, I open with an original poem. When you realize my first publications were poetry, this makes complete sense.\n\nHere then are the first lines for each of my biographies. All of these books are available in both digital and paperback editions at a retailer near you. Many also available in English language audio edition. See applicable audio links with each book.\n\nBoudicca: Britain’s Queen of the Iceni.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“Tell me a story, Mother?” asked an eight-year-old girl with curly dark hair and dark eyes.\n\n“What story would you have me tell, Moira?” asked Keita as she heated milk over the hearth fire, the sleeves of her green woolen tunic dress rolled up neatly and out of the way as she stirred.\n\nWatching her mother, Moira handed her the rennet from a lamb slaughtered the day before, “Tell me about our people.”\n\nCatherine de Valois: French Princess, Tudor Matriarch.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“I Margaret take thee Edmund to be my lawfully wedded husband,” vowed Margaret Beaufort in front of the door of the small chapel in Bletsoe Castle in Bedfordshire where she was born and raised as the daughter of the duke of Somerset, John Beaufort and his wife, Margaret Beauchamp . At just twelve years old, Margaret’s tiny frame complimented that of her Welsh bridegroom, the twenty-three year old Edmund Tudor whose bloodline as a descendant of the Welsh prince Gruffydd ap Rhys radiated in his dark hair and blue eyes. The wedding vows taken, their priest opened the big red door into the chapel for the wedding mass.\n\nMary Queen of the Scots: the Forgotten Reign.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\nWoe to Thee, Oh Scotland\n\nWoe to thee, oh Scotland\n\nOur Pictish mothers’ tears like highland rain\n\nFor the queens of old are forgotten\n\nTheir valour now seen as depraved.\n\nWhere is your love for your queens\n\nFor Picts and Scots, Gaels and Brigantes?\n\nFor fair Mary your queen — cast aside\n\nAnd praised instead the Puritan’s hateful hand.\n\nYou drove the fairest queen far away\n\nTo die disgraced on an English axe\n\nSpilling the fairest and most Scottish blood of all.\n\nAnd with her died the Scottish heart: brave and free.\n\nQueen Elizabeth Tudor: Journey to Gloriana.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\nThe white sails of the Abigail shined brightly from its three tallest masts. As the crew readied the ship to depart Plymouth and as the ship’s final passengers boarded, Edward Drinker, a lad of thirteen years from Sussex looked at the water with a mix of excitement and fear. What would life in the New World be like? Were things really so bad in England so as to be worth risking so many lives on a four month voyage to Massachusetts Bay Colony? What would the other passengers think of his family’s Quaker values and beliefs? Would they be accepted for choosing to worship without a priest or formal clergy, praying together in silence as they waited for inspiration and wisdom from the Holy Spirit?\n\nEmpress Wu Zetian.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“Miss? Miss, where do you think you are going?” asked the British soldier gruffly, grabbing the arm of the well-dressed teenaged girl walking down Dongjiaomin Lane, her dark brown hair contrasting against her ruby-encrusted hair pin.\n\n“Hands off me, barbarian!” snarled Hua-Lin with fire in her green eyes. “I am no coolie, no slave! Who do you think you are grabbing me as if I were some animal?”\n\nThree soldiers joined the first soldier, surrounding Hua-Lin menacingly. Closing in close to her body, they fondled the silk of her finely embroidered Manchu gown, its design marking her as a great-granddaughter of the Qianlong Emperor. Laughing, the youngest of the soldiers unbuttoned two of the buttons over her chest securing her gown together while the others pinned her arms behind her back, his intent only too clear to the noble Hua-Lin, “May the ravens and falcons of Abka Hehe devour your heart!”\n\nGwenllian ferch Gruffydd: the Warrior Princess of Deheubarth.\n\nGwenllian’s Tears\n\nCry out for me, my people.\n\nWhere my blood was spilt, let your voices be heard forever more.\n\nCymru in all your glory:\n\nDeheubarth, Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Powys, Dyfed\n\nYnys Môn where I was born!\n\nLet not these conquerors go unanswered\n\nSwear to me you shall never forget.\n\nWe are Cymraeg.\n\nWe are forever.\n\nEmpress Matilda of England.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\nThomas Becket glided up the Thames to the White Tower, the polished white stones of the castle shining in the light rain. As the boat docked he carefully strode up the path to the heavy gate. Instantly recognized by the guards he walked through confidently, navigating the palace expertly. Princess Matilda greeted him playfully, “Thomas! You are back!”\n\n“I am. How are you and your brothers?”\n\n“Father is cross with Richard again.”\n\nBecket laughed, “I’m not surprised. How old is he now?”\n\n“Four.”\n\n“And you are five now, Matilda?”\n\n“I’m almost six. I’m a big girl,” proclaimed Matilda proudly.\n\nBecket laughed, “And so you are, Matilda. And so you are!”\n\nHypatia of Alexandria.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“Magistra, the books you wished to borrow have arrived!” knelt the young novice as her prioress tended a patient at Disibodenberg in Naheland in west-central Germany.\n\nPrioress Hildegard rose and wiped her hands on a towel, “Excellent. Did the brother specify how long I may borrow them?”\n\n“No, Magistra.”\n\nHildegard headed towards the priory library, “Well then I will have to ask him myself before he departs.”\n\n“May I ask—what is so important about these particular books?”\n\n“They are the writings of ancient Greek mathematicians and astronomers. Wisdom of the ancient world, a world that was very different from the one we live in today,” answered Hildegard.\n\nCleopatra VII: Egypt’s Last Pharaoh.\n\nSynesius of Cyrene meandered casually through the library at the Serapeum, its massive domed roof a reminder that this was a Greek, not Egyptian, architectural masterpiece. Every few yards he stopped and looked at the shelf labels near him. Finally, after about twenty minutes he saw the small figure of his mistress standing next to a distant shelf as she organized the scrolls upon it. Smiling, Synesius approached her with a reverent bow, “Salve, August Mistress!”\n\nHypatia turned to him and motioned for him to rise, “What brings you to the library so early in the morning, Synesius? I thought you had reading to complete before our class this afternoon.”\n\nMargaret of Wessex: Mother, Saint, and Queen of Scots.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\nThe White Tower of London rose up against the foggy Thames River, its glistening white limestone walls concealing its true purpose as a symbol of conquest and dominion over the Saxons and its ruling House Wessex. A royal barge glided up to the Tower from the Thames. Four royal guards marched from the Tower to meet the docking barge as two more guards on the boat rose expectantly. Soberly the princess royal, Matilda, Kaiserin of the Empire of the Romans, stepped onto English soil for the first time in fifteen years. Ceremoniously the guards marched the unwilling princess from the Thames to King Henry’s throne room.\n\nBowing, Kaiserin Matilda found herself face to face at last with the father she barely knew as a child, “Salve Henrice rege Angliae et Normaniae.”\n\n“Salve Matilde, imperatrix romanorum!” saluted King Henry in return. “Welcome home, Matilda. How was your journey?” asked King Henry.\n\nHildegard von Bingen.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\nKatharina von Bora rose from her bed wearily to the sound of church bells tolling matins, the cloudy sky outside concealed in the early morning darkness as snow flurried across Nimbschen monastery near Grimma in Saxony. Easing herself into greater wakefulness, she changed into her simple undyed wool tunic dress that was the foundation of her nun’s habit. Combing her short hair gently and without the benefit of a mirror to guide her hand, Katharina poured herself a cup of water from a stoneware pitcher and quenched her thirst before covering her hair with her veil, slipping on her plain leather shoes, and navigating her way through the cloister.\n\nReaching the church sanctuary she found herself late, the hall already filled with Gregorian chant, “Ave Maria, O auctrix vite, reedificando salutem, que mortem conturbasti et serpentem contrivisti, ad quem se Eva erexit erecta cervice cum sufflatu superbie.”\n\nKatharina von Bora: First Lady of the Reformation.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“C’est un rempart que notre Dieu, Une invincible armure, Notre délivrance en tout lieu, Notre défense sûre,“ sang Anne Rochefeuille as she played on the harpsichord at the Château in Avignon. Next to her were scattered open books gleaned from the château’s massive library.\n\nDrawn to the music, Bishop Armand-Jean du Plessis, brother to the Seigneur de Richelieu, sat down near her to listen. Though the song was heretical in any language, or, more exactly, by a heretic, he loved his Anne’s singing dearly. Putting an arm around Anne, he kissed the back of her neck affectionately, “Bon matins, ma chérie.”\n\nAnne stopped the music to turn and kiss him properly, “Bon matins, Armand.”\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nEleanor, Fairest Eleanor\n\nTell me tales of romance and chivalry!\n\nBeautiful ladies in elegant castles\n\nWooed by knights filled with courtesy and poetry!\n\nRobin Hood fighting for justice!\n\nFor her, the troubadours did first sing!\n\nEleanor, fairest Eleanor!\n\nForever shall we sing of thee!\n\nTell me about the real Eleanor!\n\nThe daughter who inherited her father’s wealth and lands\n\nMore than enough to make her queen of France.\n\nFalconer. Dancer, Singer\n\nCrusader. Lover. Queen. Mother\n\nAh Eleanor, we do love thee!\n\nMore than Matilda’s daughter-in-law.\n\nMore than Henry II’s estranged wife\n\nMore than mother to kings of England\n\nEleanor, fairest Eleanor!\n\nForever shall we sing of thee!\n\nHis Red Eminence, Armand-Jean du Plessis de Richelieu.\n\nA Good Man?\n\nDreams of red fill my heart\n\nWhere once the dry bones of history lay.\n\nThe dazzling red velvet cappa magna.\n\nThe zucchetto covering his crown.\n\nThe sly words spoken in secret.\n\nThe blood spilled by his word.\n\nLong ago there lived a cardinal made villainous by a book\n\nAn adventurous novel made of cloaks and corsets, swords and pistols.\n\nA Scot whose voice echoes with the ages as he plays the cardinal on screen.\n\nBlack leather to make a good man seem villainous.\n\nWho was the real man behind these veils?\n\nThe First Minister of France?\n\nA dutiful son?\n\nA man of peace who led armies to victory on the battlefield?\n\nWas he simply the French version of David Beaton or Thomas Wolsey,\n\nRightfully hated and despised as Dumas teaches us to regard him?\n\nOr was he something more?\n\nA reluctant priest.\n\nHis majesty’s servant.\n\nA diplomat.\n\nA good man.\n\nFourteen biographies with fourteen beginnings! Are you excited to read more? Find links to the Legendary Women of World History series and to His Red Eminence on this blog.\n\nAll of these books are available in multiple languages including your choice of French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and Italian. Both Boudicca and Gwenllian are also available in Welsh, part of my commitment to preserving the Welsh language for centuries to come.\n\nIf you still use twitter, you may have noticed a recent discussion among the writing community regarding how best to end your latest book. After all, you have spent weeks or months, sometimes years writing your book, but how then do you best end it?\n\nI like to end my books on a high note – which is odd when you realize that biographies necessarily end with the death of the biography subject. But death doesn’t have to be sad; every one of the people whose stories I am telling have a legacy, an impact on both the lives of those who knew them and on us today.\n\nHere then are the final lines for each of my biographies. All of these books are available in both digital and paperback editions at a retailer near you.\n\nBoudicca: Britain’s Queen of the Iceni.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\nMoira sat and looked intently at her mother, letting her eyes un-focus and letting herself go into the trance that marked the Sight, “You were my mother before.”\n\n“I was.”\n\n“Are we finally together again? Have I finally found you?”\n\n“Yes, Alys, you have.”\n\nCatherine de Valois: French Princess, Tudor Matriarch.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“In time, Jasper and I were allowed to enter King Henry’s service where we all became the best of friends – just as she wanted us to be from the beginning.”\n\nHenry hugged Edmund affectionately, “And so we are. No brothers can be closer than we are. Mum would be proud.”\n\nMary Queen of the Scots: the Forgotten Reign.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\nNineteen years of imprisonment in England followed. Nineteen years of sorrow and pain. Until at last she fell victim to her own envy for Elizabeth’s crown, falling into a trap made for her by English spymaster William Cecil. In October fifteen eighty-six the nobles of England tried Queen Mary for treason against Queen Elizabeth, the verdict and sentence decided before the trial began. For weeks Queen Elizabeth debated, delaying the sentence of death. Until at last on the eighth of February fifteen eighty-seven Queen Mary stood proudly to face her death as the queen she was. Words of compassion she spoke that morning. Gifts she gave to all those who were kind to her. Beneath her black velvet gown she wore crimson, the colour of Catholic martyrs. She died that day with grace and charm. “In my end is my beginning,” was her life-long motto. All those who hated her in life came to love her in death with memory warm and glowing.\n\nAnd so with love conclude we this tale of love, of courage, of Scotland.\n\nQueen Elizabeth Tudor: Journey to Gloriana.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“The final years of Elizabeth’s reign became known as the ‘Golden Age’ with the queen now called ‘Gloriana’ in honour of her triumph. Theatre and arts expanded, England grew rich, and the Spanish Empire waned. On the twenty-fourth of March sixteen hundred and three Queen Elizabeth died in her palace in Richmond. News immediately spread to King James of Scotland, Queen Mary’s beloved son, who was quickly proclaimed King James the First of England, the first king to rule over England, Scotland, and Wales. The first King of Great Britain.”\n\n“Do you think the divide between England and Scotland will ever heal?” asked Elizabeth.\n\n“Only time will tell, my friend. We may never know. But think of this: we will be one of the first from England to live in the new world. To that I say, let the adventure begin!”\n\nEmpress Wu Zetian.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“There are people who are smarter, more educated, perhaps wiser in China and around the world. But this no one can deny: the world is a better place because she dared defy traditional ideas of womanhood. She dared do what is right, not just for herself, but for all people.”\n\nGwenllian ferch Gruffydd: the Warrior Princess of Deheubarth.\n\nYears passed in constant warfare with the English. In time Gwenllian’s brother Owain Gwynedd became king after their father. In Deheubarth younger son Rhys ap Gruffydd became Gwenllian’s greatest legacy. For from his bloodline flowed the great hope for Wales when Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur was born in Ynys Môn. And though the castle where Princess Gwenllian was born did not survive to Owain’s time her life was still remembered in Gwynedd, in Deheubarth, and across all of Wales. As Owain helped King Henry the Fifth win against French at the Battle of Agincourt and as he secretly wed the dowager queen Catherine de Valois years later, the story of his foremother Princess Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd stayed ever dear to his heart. Did his grandson, Henry Tudor remember the valour of Princess Gwenllian as he killed King Richard III in fourteen eighty five at the Battle of Bosworth Field? Who is to say?\n\nThe world is a strange place and history has a funny way of making right the evil deeds done against the innocent. And so one must think that surely in some place beyond this physical world, Princess Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd, the warrior princess of Deheubarth watched the coronation of Queen Elizabeth Tudor, a woman born of her blood and legacy, and smiled.\n\nEmpress Matilda of England.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“Eleanor is right,” added Matilda. “Sooner or later Thomas would have to choose between his duties to the pope and his duties to England. Maybe not now, or this year, or even this decade, but eventually the subject will come up. Right now Becket is your man, your servant, and no one else’s.”\n\n“My mind is made up on this matter,” declared King Henry. “You will be ordained as a priest and elevated as my archbishop of Canterbury.”\n\nThomas Becket paced before meeting the king’s eyes, “Very well then. Your wish is my command. But do not say you were not warned by the wisest women in all of England!”\n\nHypatia of Alexandria.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“Hypatia’s murder had a chilling effect on intellectual life in Alexandria. Though it did not immediately end advanced learning in the city, Cyril’s increase in power and authority sent a clear message that anyone who challenged the teachings of the Church, no matter how unintentionally, could expect the same fate.\n\n“What about Bede? Does this mean his books are worthless?”\n\n“Bede was first and foremost a monk,” explained Prioress Hildegard. “His loyalties were first to mother Church. For all must submit to the rulings of our church leaders and profess agreement with them, no matter if they are right or wrong. To fail to do so is to risk being burned as a heretic. Who will risk that when it is far easier to obey the Holy Father in Rome? And yet … I cannot obey. The visions God gives me supersedes everything. Popes, bishops, archbishops are all men! I do not know yet what the answer is to the problem, but this I do know: I will find the answer!”\n\nCleopatra VII: Egypt’s Last Pharaoh.\n\nHypatia shook her head, “More tragic is that these books here in Alexandria are the only records that contradict Octavian and those who sought his favour like Plutarch, books no doubt the Patriarch of Alexandria will see burned at the soonest opportunity.\n\n“Remember that tyranny always comes at the expense of the Truth. Never forget that. And above all else, never stop resisting those who offer the most convenient explanations for why things are as they are. Be kind and patient with others, civil in your disagreements. Question everything you see and hear. Verify every story. Seek the Truth and the Truth will find you—if you are wise and if your heart is kind.”\n\nMargaret of Wessex: Mother, Saint, and Queen of Scots.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“It was my mother who commissioned a proper biography of her, you know. She made sure that everyone who knew and remembered my mother told their story to be recorded. She was such a pious woman, even though in her piety she took away long cherished customs and traditions. And if this new clan system that is rising up in opposition to royal authority endures, then we must count that too as part of Margaret’s legacy. For it was out of love for her that Malcolm took away so much cherished heritage. The Picts never wrote things down, you see, unlike the Welsh. What was lost because of Malcolm’s love for Margaret will never be restored. Alba may endure, but it is a changed land forever,” remembered Matilda.\n\n“We can only go forward, Your Highness. Never back. And though you grieve, rightly, for the loss of your beloved husband Heinrich, surely you must understand: you too will heal. For you are the hope of many queens and kings. You are the blood unbroken of Princess Bethoc of House Dunkeld of Alba. You are the blood unbroken of Æfgifu of York of House Wessex. And you are the heiress of the Angevin dynasty through your father. Whatever the future holds for you, milady, your legacy, and therefore your grandmother’s, will endure forever.”\n\nHildegard von Bingen.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“But it was not simply the number of books that remains impressive, Katharina. She challenged the severe restrictions put on women, especially by the Church, and won most of the time. She revolutionized the role of women and won improvements in the lives of women that even today are difficult to catalogue thanks to her wisdom and hard-earned respect from secular rulers. Few people in history have made greater contributions to our society and culture. She did it all through peaceful means. Her sword was her pen, her well-earned reputation as a wise woman, and her willingness to serve God by serving others,” finished Abbess Johanna.\n\n“A true role model for all of us –women and men, religious and secular,” concluded Katharina.\n\n“Do not forget Hildegard, Sister Katharina. For her example will serve you well if you join Martin Luther’s reformation of the Church.”\n\n“I will not forget and shall apply these lessons for all of my life. God asks nothing less. Her legacy shall live in my heart. Now and always. A-men.”\n\nKatharina von Bora: First Lady of the Reformation.\n\nAudio edition available.\n\n“Disease broke out in Saxony. In December 1552 Katharina fled to nearby Torgau, hoping to escape the Black Death. Falling, she broke her hip and died. She was buried in St. Mary’s Church in Torgau where she is remembered and honoured as few women are.\n\n“Without seeking power or glory for herself, without high birth or wealth, Katharina von Bora changed our world through the power of love and the power of living her Faith instead of talking about it. Conscious of the attention she received as Martin Luther’s wife, she strove to be the model pastor’s wife, the virtuous woman of Proverbs 31. She succeeded beyond all imagination.”\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nYoungest son John Lackland ascended the English throne, taking a new wife, also named Isabella, after Isabella of Gloucester secured her annulment from him. Together John and Isabella of Angoulême had five children, despite John’s continued infidelities and persistent agitations. In 1215 John’s agitations towards his clergy and nobility culminated in the Great Charter – the Magna Carta – John’s most enduring legacy.\n\nFor Eleanor’s part she spent the remaining years of her life in retirement in Anjou, cared for by the nuns at Fonteyrault Abbey near Chinon. In 1204 she died and was buried there at the abbey. She was eighty-two years old.\n\nHis Red Eminence, Armand-Jean du Plessis de Richelieu.\n\nThe world was readying itself for Armand’s exit from the stage of life. Without Anne’s steady hand, Armand found it harder to fight off his illnesses. Often, despite the happiness of his bird’s company, he dreamed of her and remembered the vision of her spirit he saw as she died. The Phoenix, glorious phoenix—and the angel she said was what his spirit looked like. As the usual lethal plots raged and old enemies died off, Armand prepared to die, remembering his Anne and pondering many of the things she said.\n\nTuberculosis set in, making it hard to breathe. The final illness, these final pains. He was ready. For heaven? For another life as a human being? The Hour of Becomings? A wedding among the standing stones in France? Wales? England? Scotland? He did not know. But he hoped with all his heart that everything that Anne sensed and told him was true—that he would see her soon somehow, somewhere, by some divine plan his humanity could not comprehend. To serve together in government. To teach. To learn. To wed. But most of all to love.\n\nFourteen biographies with fourteen endings! Are you excited to read more?

Both Boudicca and Gwenllian are also available in Welsh, part of my commitment to preserving the Welsh language for centuries to come.\n\nGwenllian ferch Gruffydd is the national heroine of Wales. Also called the “Welsh Maid Marian” she is a likely historical model for the fictional character in the Robin Hood tales, successfully defending the south-central kingdom of Deheubarth for nearly 20 years at the side of her husband, Gruffydd ap Rhys. As I share in my youtube video, Gwenllian became foremother to the Tudor dynasty through her descendant, Owain ap Tewdur (Owen Tudor).\n\nLearn more about Gwenllian in your favorite language (including Welsh) in paperback and digital editions at your favorite retailer, including Amazon, Apple, Barnes/Noble, Kobo, and Smashwords.\n\nGwenllian Meets Gruffydd ap Rhys\n\nThree nights later Prince Gruffydd found himself unable to sleep. Dressing himself in the dark he put on his warmest cloak and headed into the main courtyard for some fresh air.\n\nThe sky above him glistened with stars that seemed especially bright after the storm that greeted him before. In the starlight stood a lady with red hair neatly braided down her back and covered only with a simple circlet. Gruffydd approached her, “Noswaith dda, f’arglwyddes.”\n\nThe lady turned to him, “Noswaith dda, f’arglwydd.”\n\n“You do not cover your hair like most ladies do,” observed Gruffydd.\n\n“Cymraes ydw i. I have no need for English fashions.”\n\n“They say even the great ladies in Scotland wear the veil.”\n\n“The nobles of Scotland care more about money than they do honour. The Normans bought them. You cannot buy me.”\n\n“Spoken like a true lady of this land,” smiled Gruffydd.\n\n“Aberffraw is my home. I need no other.”\n\n“Well said, f’arglwyddes.” Gruffydd took a step closer to her, “May I beg your indulgence and inquire of your name?”\n\n“Gwenllian ydw i,” she smiled. “Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd ap Cynan.”\n\nGruffydd fell to his knees, “F’arglwyddes!”\n\n“Gruffydd ap Rhys ydych chi?” asked Gwenllian.\n\n“Ydw. How long have you known my name, Your Highness?”\n\n“It is not hard to guess who you are, Gruffydd. And since your brother’s gait is impaired by his injuries it is only logical that you would be the heir to Rhys ap Tewder’s throne.”\n\n“The English are a cruel enemy to fight,” affirmed Gruffydd.\n\n“Do you think I know nothing of warfare? My mother is a daughter of the king of Dublin. My father has fought his entire life to free Gwynedd from English control. Do you think only my brother Owain studies the arts of war? Nay, my lord. I am Welsh, not some Norman lady who lives to breed at her father and husband’s pleasure. When it is time for me to marry it shall be of my own choosing!”\n\n“Of that I have no doubt, Your Highness.”\n\n“Why do you call me that?”\n\n“Why not? You are a princess and if I may be so bold, a very beautiful young woman.”\n\n“Perhaps it is the starlight. Perhaps in the light of day you will think otherwise.”\n\n“I am willing to find out. Are you willing to let me see you by daylight?”\n\n“Before or after you touch me as King Henry touched your sister?” asked Gwenllian astutely.\n\n“I swear to you my lady I shall not touch you in such a manner short of binding myself to you in accord with the laws and customs of this land.”\n\n“So be it then,” agreed Gwenllian as she turned to return inside.\n\n“May I see you another time? By daylight or starlight or candle? I care not how I see you, my lady. Please, I ask you, may I see you again?”\n\n“You are our guest. If it pleases you for me to join you when you dine, you need only ask my father and I will come.”\n\nThe next evening Princess Gwenllian glided down the stairs into her father’s banqueting hall in a pale blue gown edged with embroidered white roses and yellow daffodils. Seated next to King Gruffydd in a place of honour Prince Gruffydd smiled at her, his eyes widened with appreciation for both the beauty of the princess and her choice of gown. The prince turned to the king, “Might I ask a favour of you, f’arglwydd? Please kindly permit your daughter to dine in the seat next mine?”\n\nKing Gruffydd looked at him keenly, “You have already become acquainted?”\n\n“Not by candlelight, no. Only by starlight!” replied Prince Gruffydd distantly, his thoughts fixated upon the princess.\n\nPrincess Gwenllian reached her father and hugged him warmly. The king kissed her cheek, “Do you know this man, Gwenllian?”\n\n“I am still a maid if that is what you are asking,” teased Gwenllian. Straightening up she looked her father in the eye, “We spoke briefly in the courtyard. I was studying the stars and our guest came out in pursuit of fresh air to calm restless limbs.”\n\nKing Gruffydd nodded, “You may dine next to him if you desire.”\n\nSmiling Gwenllian sat in the empty seat next to the prince. Prince Gruffydd turned to her quietly, “You look beautiful tonight, Your Highness. Did you wear this gown to please me? I could not help but to notice the cenhinen pedr embroidered among the roses. A most beautiful flower. Oh but to show you the cenhinen pedr in Ceredigion! There is one special field I know in Aberystwyth where they bloom like a carpet of gold. The ladies of Aberystwyth have taken to wearing them in their hair on Saint David’s Day. Did you know that?”\n\n“Saint David was born in Ceredigion was he not?”\n\n“Yes. The leek is his symbol. Legend has it he bade those fighting for Welsh freedom against the Saxons to mark their allegiance by wearing a leek in their hats.”\n\n“What is Ceredigion like?”\n\n“It is on the shores of the Irish sea. It rains a great deal. In Aberystwyth the stormy tide sometimes reaches higher than the walls around your castle. It is best to not be too close to the beach when the weather storms like that,” laughed Prince Gruffydd playfully.\n\n“The storms get pretty bad here too sometimes, especially with one wall of the castle on the cliff above the sea,” agreed Gwenllian.\n\nFrom across the table Prince Hywel eyed his brother, “What are you two whispering about, Gruffydd?”\n\nPrince Gruffydd turned his attention to Hywel, “The weather if you must know.”\n\n“The weather?” asked Hywel incredulously. “Why would you whisper about the weather?” Princess Gwenllian looked at Hywel. Infectious laughter burst from her heart. Prince Gruffydd joined her. Queen Angharad shook her head gaily as the entire table, including the king’s oldest son Prince Owain, fell into mirth.\n\n“Cymraes ydw i. I have no need for English fashions,” in one simple line from chapter two of “Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd, the Warrior Princess of Deheubarth” Princess Gwenllian summarizes her entire life and legacy, a legacy that has touched billions of lives.\n\nBut who was she and if she was really so influential, why have few people outside of Wales ever heard of her?\n\nBorn in 1097, Princess Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd was the daughter of King Gruffydd ap Cynan of the Welsh kingdom of Gwynedd. Gwynedd’s rugged mountains empowered its rulers to remain independent longer than any other Welsh kingdoms in the country. Today the county of Gwynedd remains one of the largest and includes Snowdonia National Park. But historically Gwynedd the kingdom was much larger than its modern namesake. In medieval times Gwynedd’s capital was Aberffraw Castle on the island of Ynys Môn (English: Anglesey). Readers of “Boudicca, Britain’s Queen of the Iceni” should recognize the name Ynys Môn because the island was the center of British druidry and therefore bore the brunt of Roman aggression towards Brythonic and ancient Celtic culture and religion. Ynys Môn has a long tradition of being a historical hot spot (and one worthy of your next visit to the United Kingdom).\n\nSo it should be no surprise that Ynys Môn would be home to Wales’ most pivotal leaders.\n\nTurn of the 12th century Wales was turbulent. After his victory near Hastings in October 1066, William the Conqueror (now William I of England) set his sights on conquering the entire island of Britain. Many of the Scottish nobles were bribed into vassalage. But the north of England and the Welsh kingdoms were different. If William I and his new Angevin dynasty wanted to control these lands, he would have to take them by force!\n\nWilliam I began this task immediately. In 1067 construction began on the first Norman castle, Chepstow in modern day Monmouthshire in southeast Wales. Located approximately 32 miles north of Cardiff, Chepstow’s location in the kingdom of Gwent made it the perfect fortress for attacking the southern kingdoms of Gwent, Morgannwg, and Deheubarth which in Gwenllian’s time had expanded to include most of south central Wales, including the kingdom of Ceredigion.\n\nStanding in the way of this Norman Conquest of Wales were King Gruffydd ap Cynan of Gwynedd and King Rhys ap Tewdwr of Deheubarth. Though often forced to retreat into exile in Ireland, both men blocked the outright and permanent conquest of their realms, passing on their fight to their sons and daughters.\n\nIt was in this environment that Princess Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd was born. Like her famous brothers, she was raised in a kingdom constantly under attack. Everyone — including the king’s daughter — needed to be battle ready or risk losing life and home to William Rufus’ and King Henry I’s notoriously brutal soldiers.\n\nGwenllian’s life changed forever in 1113 when King Rhys ap Tewdwr’s two surviving sons sought sanctuary at Aberffraw after recently escaping exile, torture, and imprisonment at Norman hands. For Prince Gruffydd ap Rhys and Princess Gwenllian it was true love almost from the beginning of his time there. In 1115 they married and Gwenllian moved to Gruffydd’s Dinefwr castle as its co-sovereign, beginning a twenty year war of resistance against the much stronger Normans thanks to their successful use of the Welsh longbow fired from the cover of forest, the same tactics used by the fictional Robin Hood and Maid Marion against similar Norman knights. Unlike Robin Hood and Marion, Gwenllian and Gruffydd’s stakes in these battles were far greater: if they failed, tens of thousands of Welsh would be enslaved by the Anglo-Normans. Their kingdom was at stake and it was their job to defend it — at any price.\n\nGwenllian paid that price in February 1136 when Maurice de Londres captured her following a desperate winter battle. Instead of ransoming her as the code of chivalry demanded, Maurice chopped off her head, making Gwenllian the first sovereign ever executed by the English. It was an atrocity that could no be ignored.\n\nTo this day “revenge for Gwenllian” remains a Welsh battle cry of outrage, an execution that remains well remembered. The Welsh have not forgotten Gwenllian and never will. To truly understand the history and culture of the British people it is vital that you discover her story as well.\n\n“Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd, the Warrior Princess of Deheubarth” is available in English, Welsh, German, and Spanish on Amazon, Apple, and a retailer near you."
