        "text": "History of the Name Gruffudd\n\nGruffudd is a popular Welsh name for boys, meaning “strong lord”. The name is thought to have originated from the Common Brittonic name Grippiud or Gripuid.\n\nThe Gruffudd name is a Welsh boy’s name that’s an old form of the name Griffith. It is pronounced, “GRUF fith.” Variant spellings of the name include “Griffin,” “Gruffud,” and “Gruffydd.” Gruffudd evolved from the names Gripuid and Grippiud, and it was the ancestor of some names like Gruffydd.\n\nGruffudd is a name with a rich history in Wales. It was the name of several Welsh kings and princes, including Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, the last king of Wales. The name is also associated with a number of other notable Welsh figures, including the poet Gruffudd Fychan and the composer Gruffudd ab Adda.\n\nPeople with the Name Gruffudd\n\nThe name dates back to at least the Middle Ages. The Welsh prince, Llywelyn the Great, had a son named Gruffudd (or Gruffydd) ap Llywelyn (1198 – 1244), with ap meaning “son of.” Gruffydd ap Rhys (c. 1081 – 1137) was a prince who ruled Deheubarth and fought the Normans. Gruffudd and its variants were common names among medieval Welsh royalty.\n\nGruffudd and its variants are still sometimes used today. Gruffudd Glyn, for example, is an actor who has performed in “Thor: The Dark World” and “The Theory of Everything.” He will also be in an upcoming movie called “The Martian.”\n\nThe meaning of Gruffudd is “prince” or “strong lord.” Some say it also means “red-haired.”\n\nPopularity\n\nIn recent years, the name Gruffudd has seen a resurgence in popularity in Wales. It is now one of the most popular Welsh names for boys and is often ranked in the top 100 most popular names in Wales.\n\nAlthough the spelling Gruffudd was not in the top 100 baby boys’ names in Wales, Gruffydd was in 93rd position in 2021.\n\nUseful Resources"
