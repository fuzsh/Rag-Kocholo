        "text": "(‘the south part’), one of Wales's larger medieval kingdoms. Formed during the reign of Hywel Dda (died 949/50) by combining, through marriage, Seisyllwg and Dyfed, it covered the west and south‐west of Wales and sometimes extended into Brycheiniog. Its capital, Dinefwr, acquired legendary status, but, unlike Dyfed and Ceredigion, the name has not been revived."
