        "text": "I say in my bio that my ancestors came from Wales. While Woodbury is a Saxon name, my umpteenth great grandfather, William Woodbury, self-identified as a Welshman when he came to Salem in 1628, but he is not the main source of my Welsh ancestry. I discuss the origins of the name ‘Woodbury’ and its Welsh possibilities here: https://sarahwoodbury.com/about/the-origins-of-the-name-woodbury/\n\nI am also descended from a host of Morgans, Thomas’, Kemries, Johns, Rhuns etc. The line I’ve researched most successfully descends from Llywelyn ap Ifor born around 1300. Six generations later, Sir John Morgan (1448) was knighted and is featured here: http://tredegarhouse.blogspot.com/2006/05/sir-john-morgan-7.html\n\nOne of his sons, Thomas, married Elizabeth Vaughn and had Rowland (who became sheriff in 1588). The line then goes Henry-Thomas-Robert to Samuel, who had two children: Anna and Robert. Anna, born in 1685, married Hezekiah Ober. Their child, Joanna, married Elisha Woodbury, 8 generations up from me through my father. In turn, Robert married Mary Thorndike. Their son, Paul, is also 8 generations up from me, through my mother.\n\nIn addition, a reader was kind enough to inquire about my ancestry and explained that Llywelyn ap Ifor’s wife, Angharad, was descended from Rhydderch ab Iestyn, whose father Iestyn is thought to be another son of Owain ap Hywel Dda. The line from Rhydderch comes via his grandson Caradog ap Gruffudd. Caradog married Gwenllian, daughter of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, King of Powys and later also of Gwynedd.\n\nAs to Llywelyn ab Ifor, his father, Ifor ap Llywelyn, married Tangwystl, who was the daughter of Rhys ap Hywel ‘Sais’. The father of Hywel ‘Sais’ was Rhys ap Gruffudd, The Lord Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth. (So it goes: Lord Rhys – Hywel ‘Sais’ – Rhys – Tangwystl). The Lord Rhys was the grandson of Gruffydd ap Cynan (King of Gwynedd) through his daughter Gwenllian. Gruffydd, in turn is descended not only from Rhodri Mawr but Brian Boru, High King of Ireland and Sitric Silkbeard, King of Dublin.\n\nLlywelyn ab Ifor’s grandfather, Llywelyn, married Nest, daughter of Hywel ‘Felyn’, son of Gruffudd ab Ifor ‘Bach’, Lord of Senghenydd. Ifor Bach’s wife was also called Nest, and she was the daughter of Gruffudd ap Rhys and sister to the Lord Rhys ap Gruffudd.\n\nSome of these people can be seen here (in 2nd chart from top, begun in first chart):\n\nHe explains that this is yet another example of how dynastic lines became entwined, which makes many Welsh people kinsmen. It also (particularly in the example of Rhydderch ab Iestyn) provides a better sense of how battles between various lines began, each claiming some inheritance from a common ancestor.\n\nThis is the family tree of the Kings of Wales, also very much a matter of intertwining lineages: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_Wales_family_trees\n\nIn addition, while the above ancestral lines indicate that I am a descendant of many medieval kings, including Gruffydd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd; Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, King of Powys; Brian Boru, High King of Ireland; Lord Rhys, Ruler of Deheubarth; and Sitric Silkbeard, King of Dublin, imagine my delight to learn that I am also descended from King Henry I of England through his illegitimate eldest son, Robert of Gloucester (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifor_Bach). Robert’s illegitimate daughter, Mabel, married Gruffydd ab Ifor Bach, Lord of Senghenydd (above, son of Ifor Bach and Nest). I descend directly from one of their children. As my son is wont to say, how cool is that?"
