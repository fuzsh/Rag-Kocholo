        "text": "Dyfed was one of several Welsh kingdoms that emerged in South West Wales in 5th century following the departure of the Romans. The kingdom was the former lands of the Déisi, later subsumed into the principality of Deheubarth.\n\nThe Déisi were a class of people in ancient Ireland. In Latin, the land of the Déisi was Demetae, which eventually evolved into Welsh as Dyfed.\n\nDyfed covers approximately the same geographic extent as the ancient Principality of Deheubarth, excluding the Gower Peninsula and the area west of the River Tawe."
