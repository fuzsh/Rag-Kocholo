In North America the surname King has absorbed several European cognates and equivalents with the same meaning for example German König (see <a href=\"https://en.geneanet.org/surnames/Koenig\">Koenig</a>) and Küng French <a href=\"https://en.geneanet.org/surnames/Roy\">Roy</a> Slovenian Croatian or Serbian <a href=\"https://en.geneanet.org/surnames/Kralj\">Kralj</a> Polish <a href=\"https://en.geneanet.org/surnames/Krol\">Krol</a>. It is also very common among African Americans. It is also found as an artificial Jewish surname.2: English: occasionally from the Middle English personal name King originally an Old English nickname from the vocabulary word cyning cyng ‘king’.3: Irish: adopted for a variety of names containing the syllable rí (which means ‘king’ in Irish).4: Native American: loose translation into English (and shortening) of a personal name such as Cheyenne Vehoeso ‘Little Chief’ which is from a diminutive of veho ‘chief’. See also <a href=\"https://en.geneanet.org/surnames/Chief\">Chief</a>.5: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 金 possibly based on the Foochow dialect spoken in Fuzhou in Fujian province see <a href=\"https://en.geneanet.org/surnames/Jin\">Jin</a> 1.6: Chinese: Cantonese form of the surnames 景 荊 敬 and 經 also variant Romanization of the surnames 井 see <a href=\"https://en.geneanet.org/surnames/Jing\">Jing</a> 1-4 and 6.7: Chinese: possibly from Cantonese form of the Chinese name 敬 (meaning ‘esteem respect’) a monosyllabic personal name or part of a disyllabic personal name of some early Chinese immigrants in the US.\n\nLearn more"
