As a result, the dates sometimes attached to individuals conflict with dates attached to their parents or children. Darrell Wolcott, President, Center for the Study of Ancient Wales, has constructed estimated birth years for those coming before and following Tudor Trevor which seek to resolve the conflicts. Born in Jefferson, Texas in 1935 Darrell Wolcott grew up in Ohio. After a career in banking he took early retirement in 1996, and returning to his place of birth he created and endowed the Center for the Study of Ancient Wales (a non-profit foundation with a library of some 3200 volumes) located in Jefferson, Texas. The foundation has constructed a small castle to house its library and offices and acquired copies of thousands of source and secondary works related to the history of Wales, many of which are otherwise unavailable outside Britain. At present he is its sole researcher.\n\n↑ Harleian genealogies 1: Gwynedd part 1, amb\n\n↑ T.J. Griffiths, T.J.
