Thereafter, he was called Rhys Gryg and his son later become known as Rhys Mechyll who also named a son Rhys Fychan, usually called Ieuanc.\"[2]\n\nHe married three times[6][2] and had more than a dozen children.[6]\n\nIn 1233/4,[7][1][4] \"Rhys the Hoarse\"[1] (Rhys Gryg) was mortally wounded while attacking Carmarthen Castle under the banner of Llywelyn the Great.[4][8] He was buried \"near the grave of his father\",[1] at St David's Cathedral in Pembrokeshire.[4][3]\n\nPrince\n\nRhys Gryg was a prince of Wales,[4] but not the Prince of Deheubarth. That was his father, Rhys ap Gruffudd (1132-1197), who had \"succeeded as sole ruler [of Deheubarth] in 1155 on the death of Maredudd\". After Rhys ap Gruffudd died on 28 April 1197,[3] Deheubarth was \"no longer a united and harmonious whole\", even though his son Gruffydd's \"claim to Dinefwr and the headship of Deheubarth was conceded\".[9]\n\nMaelgwn ap Rhys ap Gruffudd had been in exile abroad in 1197 but \"returned bent on gaining a large share of the ancestral lands\". He was unsuccessful, opposed by his brother Gruffudd and nephews Rhys and Owain following Gruffudd's death in 1201.[10] Rhys Gryg also battled against his nephews, the sons of Gruffudd, for several years.[2]\n\nRhys Gryg \"was an unreliable man, who rebelled against his father, played off one of his brothers against another, and played off king John against Llywelyn ap Iorwerth. Physical bravery he certainly had, but no consistency can be discovered in his actions - other than self-seeking.... From 1215, he was tolerably loyal to Llywelyn ap Iorwerth\".[4][9]\n\nIn 1216, the \"Aberdovey council\"[4] divided Deheubarth \"between Maelgwn, son of Rhys, and his brother, Rhys the Hoarse, and Rhys and Owain, the sons of Gruffudd, son of Rhys, at Aberdovey, in the presence of Llywelyn, son of Iorwerth, when all the Welsh princes, for the most part and all the wise men of Gwynedd were summoned thither together.\"[1]\n\nRhys was allotted \"the whole of Cantrev Mawr, except Mallaen, and the Cantrev Bychan, except Hirvryn and Myddvai; and [the commotes of] Cydweli and Carnwyllon.[1]\n\nIn 1227, his son Rhys Mechyll gained possession of Rhys Gryg's castle of Llanymddyfri in exchange for his father's freedom, whom he had captured at Llanarthneu.[11]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nSee the following Timeline section for significant dates in the life of Rhys Gryg and the Locations section (below) for more information about significant locations, which includes a brief explanation of cantrefi and commotes that has external links to maps of Deheubarth.\n\nBirth Location: Rhys Gryg's birth in Deheubarth, Wales is probable, as his father was the Prince of Deheubarth. However, Rhys may have been born in Powys, as his mother was the daughter of the king of Powys - Madog ap Maredudd ap Bleddyn ap Cynfyn.[12] Deheubarth and Powys were two of the Ancient Kingdoms of Wales (see WikiTree's category, Wales, Ancient Kingdoms).\n\nBirth Year Estimate: That he was born about 1165 is Wolcott's estimate.[2] Estimates run from c1150 to c1190 (athough that last is probably meant for his son Rhys). For example\n\nc1150, per his WikiTree profile as of 8 July 2023 (since changed to c1165) - 1150 is too early if his parents married in 1155 (per Wolcott).[2]\n\nc1170, per the FamilySearch Welsh database, which referred to him as \"of Carmarthenshire, Wales\" and \"of the tribe of Rhys ap Tewdwr\"[13]\n\nc1190, per Genealogics,[14] but c1190 is given in WikiTree,[15] as the year his son Rhys was born.\n\n4th Son? Most sources say that he is the 4th son of Rhys ap Gruffudd,[4] but the text for his father's WikiTree profile (Ap_Gruffydd-59), as of 9 July 2023, lists him second to Gruffudd.[15] One source calls him \"Lord Rhys's youngest son\",[16] but his father's profile says there were nine sons. The dates on WikiTree profiles for Rhys ap Gruffudd's children lands Rhys Gryg as the 3rd son (of 5).[15]\n\nDeath: Brut y Tywysogion says he died in 1233,[1] but the Dictionary of Welsh Biography says he died in 1234, after being mortally wounded in \"the attack on Carmarthen castle, in 1234....\"[4]\n\n\"The castle was the site of a siege in 1233-4\".[7] The 3-month siege of the castle was broken in March 1234,[17] so this is apparently an old/new date issue (in 1233, the new year would have begun in March, not on 1 January).[18]\n\n\"...March 1234, Henry de Turberville sailed with a fleet from Bristol and... broke up the improvised bridge, with great slaughter of its defenders.\"[17] Turberville came in defense of Carmarthen Castle. The defenders of the improvised bridge were those attacking Carmarthen Castle: \"towards the end of this year (1233)... earl Richard (Richard MarshalI, earl of Pembroke), Rhys Gryg... besieged the fortress (of Carmarthen)\".[17]\n\nBrut y Tywysogion says that Rhys Gryg \"died at Llandeilo the Great, and was buried in Menevia, near the grave of his father.\"[1] His father was buried at St David's in Pembrokeshire.[3] (For details about these locations, see the Death and Burial section, below.)\n\nFamily\n\nHe is well documented as the son of Lord Rhys and Gwenllian of Powys.[4][19] His wives and children are not so well documented.\n\nSources do not agree on the order, or number, of his wives. Nor do they agree on the number of his children, when they were born, or by whom.[20] The presentation of his wives and children in this profile is based on careful consideration of those various sources.[21]\n\nThe 1185 date of his first marriage (per WikiTree as of 9 July 2023) is based on the estimated birth year of 1170 for his wife Ellyw.[22] An analysis in the previous version of this profile arrived at \"about 1195\" for his first marriage:[23]\n\nIf by his first wife he had 12 children,[13] assuming 2 years each would be 24 years before he married (2) in 1219. This puts his first marriage about 1195, which works with c1165 for his birth and the estimated dates for all three wives (see below).\n\nAlthough the article in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography about him does not mention any wife,[4] most sources say that Rhys married (2) a daughter of Richard de Clare.[24][25] Sources agree that his marriage to a de Clare daughter occurred in 1219, but disagree on which of Richard's daughters she was. At one point, Batrum had Rhys's second wife as \"NN f. Gilbert\".[26] Boyer retained Gilbert as the father of Rhys's second wife.[27]\n\nBrut y Tywysogion does not name which de Clare daughter or which earl of Clare:\n\n\"1219... Rhys the Hoarse married the daughter of the earl of Clare\".[1]\n\nWhile neither Richardson nor Cawley identify the first wife of Rhys Gryg, the second is identified as a daughter of Richard de Clare by both:[24][25]\n\n[?Joan], third daughter of Richard de Clare and his wife Amice of Gloucester[28]\n\n\"MATILDA [Joan] de Clare, [widow of WILLIAM de Briouse,] daughter of RICHARD de Clare Earl of Hertford & his wife Amice of Gloucester\"[25]\n\nBartrum calls her Matilda[6] (Latin for Maud). Wolcott calls her Joan.[2] Cawley and some others are inclined to treat Maud and Joan as one person.[25] Richardson names them sisters, treating them as two different persons.[29][30][31] Following Richardson,\n\nMaud de Clare, widow of William de Brewes,[30] did not marry Rhys Gryg.\n\nHer sister \"[?Joan]\"[28] (Joan de Clare in WikiTree)[15] did marry Rhys Gryg.\n\nRichardson does not mention a first wife for Rhys nor any children except Maredudd and Hywel. Wolcott names Ellyw, but has Joan de Clare as Rhys's first wife, Ellyw ferch Trahaearn as his second, and Gwenllian his third. Wolcott names son Rhys Mechyll, but does not identify his mother.[2] Bartrum, who also lists three wives, shows Rhys Gryg's son Rhys Mechyll as the son of \"Ellyw f. Thomas (or Trahaearn)\", Rhys Gryg's first wife.[6]\n\nIf Ellyw was the mother of Rhys Fychan - later known as Rhys Mechyll - then she and Rhys were married before 1213 (he was imprisoned 1213-1215, obtaining his release by \"giving his son Rhys Fychan as a hostage\").[2] Cawley also concludes that Rhys Mechyll was too old to have been the second wife's son.[11]\n\nWives:\n\nEllyw (c1170)[2] ferch [Thomas/Trahaearn] ap Gwgan/Gwgon,[32] married about 1185[33][20]\n\nJoan de Clare (born c1180),[2] married 1219[34][35]\n\nGwenllian (c1165)[2] ferch Elidyr ap Owain ap Idnerth ap Cadwgan ap Elystan Glodrydd[36][37][38]\n\nBartrum's chart for \"Rhys Gryg ab Yr Arglwydd Rhys\", d. 1234, lists 16 children, showing his first wife Ellyw as the mother of his son Rhys - annotated with \"(1)\". The chart's annotations for his son Maredudd show only that Ellyw was not his mother, having both \"(2)\" and \"(c)\". Those are the only two children with annotations to indicate which of Rhys Gryg's three wives was their mother.[6][20]\n\nGenerations: Bartrum includes generations in his charts. For example, both Rhys and his wife Ellyw are in generation 5.[39] All of his sons except Meurig are in the 6th generation (Meurig is in the 7th); three daughters (Arrdun, Angharad, and Ellyw) are in the 6th generation and the other three are in the 7th (Gwenllian Gethin, Jonet, and the unnamed [NN] wife of Cadwgon ab Owain).[6]\n\nBirth Order: As mentioned above, sources do not agree on the birth order of his children, assuming that children were listed by the source in birth order. Nor do the sources all agree that Rhys's mother was not the same as Maredudd's and Hywel's. One source (Genealogics) lists all three among Ellyw's children by her husband \"Rhys Gryg 'the Hoarse' aka Rhys Fychan Lord of Cantref Mawr and Cantref Bychan\".[14]\n\nThe following list of children is in the same order presented in Bartrum, which shows daughters first, followed by sons.[6] Additional notes on the children (below) are listed in the order they are numbered by Genealogics.[14]\n\nChildren\n\ndaughters\n\nArrdun[6][40]\n\nAngharad[6][40]\n\nEllyw[6][40]\n\nGwenllian Gethin[6]\n\nJonet[6][40]\n\nunnamed daughter[6]\n\nAles[14]\n\nsons\n\nRhys Mechyll[6][4][25][40]\n\nIorwerth[6][40]\n\nIeuan[6]\n\nLlywelyn Ddiriaid[6][40]\n\nGruffudd[6]\n\nMaredudd[6][4][25][24][41]\n\nPhilip[6]\n\nHywel[6][24][25]\n\nMeurig[6]\n\nCaradog[6][40]\n\nNotes about Children: Genealogics had a numbered list of children,[14] which is reflected in the following. Additional notes include who their mother was, according to which source, birth years from their WikiTree profiles, and additional information from Bartrum's chart. Not listed below, for the most part, is information from an earlier version of this profile, which had most all of them \"of Carmarthenshire\" and born \"about 1200\" (four - Gwenllian \"Gethin\", Jonet, [unknown], and Meurig - were born \"about 1230\").[23]\n\n1.
