        "text": "Their long forgotten names ooze magic and promise mystery greater than fiction.\n\nThis was the world of ancient Wales and its lost kingdoms. They’ve seen kings, battles and conquests and some of the names still live on in the country we know today.\n\nWales was rarely one kingdom and, following the departure of the Romans in the fifth century, it evolved into several, some of which were smaller, “petty” kingdoms.\n\nMountains, forests, glens, rivers and moors contributed to a strong sense of localism and autonomy. But there was also a sense of nationality and of being “Welsh”.\n\n“In the earlier period, between the fifth and seventh centuries, you had Brythonic [the term for indigenous Britons] kingdoms not only in Wales – for example Gwynedd, Dyfed, Powys, Gwent – but in England and southern Scotland, including Gododdin, Rheged and Elfed,” said Dr Rhun Emlyn, a medieval historian at Aberystwyth University.\n\n“These kingdoms were gradually conquered by the Anglo-Saxons and the Scots. Between 1,000AD and the conquest of Wales by Edward I in the 1280s the main kingdoms were Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth, but you also had minor kingdoms.”\n\nThe kingdoms often overlapped in time and geography as lands were conquered or marriages arranged.\n\nThe lost kingdoms of Wales\n\nGwynedd\n\nThe kingdom of Gwynedd emerged in the fifth century. In 825, Merfyn, the son of Maelgwn Fawr became king of Gwynedd. He married Nest of the house of Powys and their son, Rhodri, married Angharad of the house of Seisyllwg (a petty kingdom which covered Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi). By the time of his death in 878, Rhodri was king of a realm extending from Anglesey to Gower.\n\nBut he was not the only ruler of Gwynedd to rise to eminence. Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, whose father, Llywelyn ap Seisyll, ruled both Gwynedd and Powys, became the ruler of both kingdoms after killing Iago ab Idwal. He later seized Deheubarth and Morgannwg with brutal methods and from 1057 to 1063 the whole of Wales recognised his kingship. “For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor Successor,” wrote historian John Davies in his History of Wales.\n\nDyfed\n\nThe kingdom of Dyfed was of Irish origin. In the Dyfed area there are still 20 inscribed stones bearing letters in Ogam, the script of the Irish, who carried out raids on the area (and other places like the Isle of Man) in the fourth century. In fact, there were once forts along the River Taff further east to guard against raids by the Irish. Dyfed roughly covered Pembrokeshire and what is now the west of Carmarthenshire, taking in the area that bordered the rivers Teifi, Gwili and Tywi, though it lost Ystrad Tywi to Ceredigion, a “petty kingdom”, in the seventh century. Though Norman lords exerted their influence after their conquest, princes (including Llywelyn ein Llyw Olaf in the 13th century) fought to recover the region until Edward I’s conquest of Wales settled the matter.\n\nPowys\n\nThe kingdom of Powys roughly covered the top two thirds of the county of Powys as it is today and part of the West Midlands. It was ruled by a dynasty claiming descent jointly from the warlord Gwrtheyrn and the Roman emperor, Magnus Maximus.\n\nIt split following the death of Madog ap Maredudd in 1160 and the southern part became Powys Wenwynwyn while the northern part became Powys Fadog. Powys Wenwynwyn and Gwynedd became bitter rivals. The former often allied with England to weaken its rival.\n\nDeheubarth\n\nDeheubarth came into existence in 920 when Hywel Dda combined the kingdoms of Dyfed and Seisyllwg. It covered the areas now known as Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, but also took in the Gower. Hywel had his base at Dinefwr, near Llandeilo, but the area was later repeatedly overrun by the Welsh of the north and east, including Llywelyn ap Seisyll of Gwynedd and Rhydderch ab Iestyn of Morgannwg.\n\nThere were then repeated Norman incursions but in the 12th century Lord Rhys briefly got the kingdom back to the status Hywel had reached around 200 years earlier. But when he died, his kingdom was divided among his several sons and after Edward I’s conquest, it was divided into Ceredgion, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire.\n\nBrycheiniog\n\nBrycheiniog was where the southern part of modern Powys is today. It was ruled by the Tamblyn family in the early middles ages and a buffer between England and Deheubarth in the west.\n\nBetween 1088 and 1095 it was conquered by the Normans but remained characteristically Welsh. It was transformed into the Lordship of Brecknock. Later it formed the southern and larger part of Brecknockshire. Brycheiniog’s main legacy is that it lent its name to Brecknockshire and Brecon.\n\nErgyng\n\nErgyng was a Welsh kingdom between the 5th and 7th centuries dubbed “Archenfield” by the English. It lay mostly in what’s now western Herefordshire, spreading into modern Monmouthshire. It had been part of Glywysing – now Glamorgan – and Gwent. In the 5th century it had become independent under Gwrfoddw Hen and under King Peibio Clafrog in the mid 6th century.\n\nGwent\n\nThe kingdoms of south east Wales emerged from a combination of Roman settlements and ancient tribes like the Silures. South-east Wales had been the most Romanised area of the country. The kingdom of Gwent lay between the rivers Wye and Usk and existed from the end of Roman rule in the 5th century until the Norman conquest of the 11th century.\n\nIts courts and diocese were separate from the rest of Wales until its conquest by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. It recovered its independence after his death in 1063. But Gwent was the first Welsh kingdom to be overrun by the Normans, by 1086.\n\nGlywysing\n\nGlywysing lasted in various forms from the fifth century to the 12th in an area covering what is now the Vale of Glamorgan, Bridgend and Cardiff, as well as stretching further north into the Valleys. It was ruled in the sixth century by Tewdrig ap Teithfallt, who, according to legend, became a hermit at Tintern and passed on the land to his son, Meurig. But he came out of his life of solitude to help Meurig in a battle against invading Saxons, when he was mortally wounded.\n\nPengwern\n\nThis petty kingdom sat in what’s now Shropshire, adjoining Wales’ modern border. It’s widely regarded as being the early seat of Powys’ kings before they moved west to Mathrafal, near present-day Welshpool. Little is known about its foundation or exact location. The 7th century Powys prince Cynddylan ap Cyndrwyn was associated with rule over Pengwern.\n\nHe joined forces with Mercia’s king Penda to protect it. They fought the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria at the Battle of Maes Cogwy – Oswestry – in 642. Here their mutual enemy, King Oswald, was slain.\n\nThe rise, fall and variations of these kingdoms spanned centuries.\n\n“It was a period of great flux and kingdoms could fragment into smaller units or conquer other kingdoms to become larger,” Dr Emlyn said, adding that kingdoms were also divided into smaller units called ‘cantrefi’ – ‘hundreds’ in English.\n\nAmong the most important kings of this period were Maelgwn Gwynedd, Rhodri Mawr, Hywel Dda, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, Owain Gwynedd, The Lord Rhys, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd.\n\n“They would have called themselves Britons in the earlier period but gradually they came to call themselves ‘Cymry’ – two names for the same people,” Dr Emlyn said.\n\nAnd being British did not mean what it does now.\n\n“It meant the Welsh, as the descendants of the people who inhabited most of Britain before the Anglo-Saxons arrived,” Dr Emlyn said.\n\n“Using the word British as it is used today is only a modern phenomenon. Another aspect of their identity would be their Christian identity – by the centuries leading up to the conquest of Wales they would have seen themselves as belonging to the Christian people, to Christendom, an identity that covered most of Europe. An interesting feature when considering Wales in this period is that Wales, before it was conquered by Edward I in the 1280s, was the last remaining part of the Roman Empire in western Europe that hadn’t been conquered by ‘barbarian’ peoples.”\n\nAmong these barbarians were the Anglo-Saxons.\n\n“When the Anglo-Saxons were taking over parts of England the Britons there would have seen stark differences between themselves and the Anglo-Saxons,” Dr Emlyn said.\n\n“The Britons were Christians who had been influenced by Roman civilization and education in comparison to the Anglo-Saxons who were pagans from outside the Roman Empire, and would have been considered barbarians.”\n\nMiranda Aldhouse-Green, an emeritus professor who specialises in archaeology at Cardiff University, said: “When the Romans pulled out of Britain in the west, the area that we now call Wales was the source of fragmented tribes. They formed themselves into regional kingdoms. This was happening in the fifth, sixth and seventh centuries. One of the interesting sources of evidence of that can be found in the Mabinogion, where you get these descriptions of Dyfed and Harlech and all that.\n\n“One of the problems in understanding what was going on, how the Welsh language was blossoming, and how Wales was becoming identifiable as Wales is that the literature is very small,” said Prof Aldhouse-Green, who wrote Celtic Wales with Ray Howell.\n\n“You have the development of the British language, which becomes Welsh, whereas in England the language is formed by Latin and Anglo-Saxon.”\n\nProf Aldhouse-Green described how, from the eighth century on, there was a period of developing kingship aligned with Christianity and “a wonderful artistic tradition”.\n\n“It is a very volatile period and almost impossible to put your finger on the origins of these kingships,” she said.\n\n“You’re getting these very strong regional identities that are sometimes in conflict. In the later periods you’re getting the whole of Wales beginning to think of itself as an identifiable unit,” said Prof Aldhouse-Green\n\n“In a way the laws of Hywel Dda seem to cover the whole of Wales. That is the first time there is that mark of unification. The old kingdoms lose their identity but the politics has changed and the stage has changed. It’s a feeling of Welsh identity.”\n\nThis year archaeology graduate Stuart Wilson defied sceptics by discovering what is believed to be the lost city of Trellech having sunk £32,000 into a land plot.\n\n“When the Romans left what we had left was the British, and they split themselves up into various administrative areas,” the 38-year-old said.\n\n“We know for example in the area where I am, the Chepstow area, by 600AD this area was being administered from Caerleon, which would make sense because that was the old fortress.\n\n“Archenfield [Ergyng, a smaller kingdom covering western Herefordshire and parts of Monmouthshire] at that time was administered from Gloucester because that is a Roman city.”\n\nHe said the legends of King Arthur could have come from the ruler of Glywysing, Meurig, who married Onbrawst, the daughter of Gwrgan Fawr, ruler of Ergyng.\n\n“Their kingdoms became united by marriage,” Mr Wilson said. “Their son was called Athrwys, and that was where the legends of King Arthur came from. There was a real King Arthur.”\n\nA mass of Welsh history has gone unrecorded.\n\n“There is not a lot of documentation around and in terms of archaeology they tended to build in wood, which does not survive,” Mr Wilson said.\n\n“And they did not make pottery. They probably used leather for things like bowls, which also does not survive.\n\n“They would have identified themselves as members of their family, as people of their kingdom but also as being Welsh.”"
