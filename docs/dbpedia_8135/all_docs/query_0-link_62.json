Wales, the other British stronghold of Celtic art and society, is organized during this period into three kingdomsâGwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth, each ruled by their own princely family. Ireland is also fragmented, with a titular High King not in reality acknowledged by all the smaller kings under him, and without the strength to force obedience on them.\n\nWith the arrival of the Normans, art and architecture produced in England reflects French influence. The Norman and Plantagenet kings hold French territory during the period, and artists and objects travel between the two countries. Majestic cathedrals are erected from the end of the eleventh century; those at Durham, Canterbury, Ely, Wells, and Lincoln are among the most famous. By the end of the period, English embroideries are so renowned for their refinement that they are known throughout Europe as opus anglicanun."
