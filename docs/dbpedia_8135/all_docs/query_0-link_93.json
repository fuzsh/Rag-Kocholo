The Three Brothers of Deheubarth - Adda, Geraint and Rhisiart - pledge to help Shala, a knight from Kephira, regain his lands and become king. They agree to find the fabled jewels of the ancient Drenis kings, rumored to be hidden in a treasure cave. After many battles, they locate the singing stone marking the cave's entrance. Inside they find riches but only take what they need, leaving the rest for the cave's guardian, the sleeping giant Vachan. With the treasure, Shala raises an army and founds the city of Kephira, fulfilling the brothers' pledge.",
