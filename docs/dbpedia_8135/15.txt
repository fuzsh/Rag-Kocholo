General Information[]

Deheubarth, at its start, is a Catholic Welsh feudal monarchy located in the Wales area, Britain region of the Western Europe subcontinent. The kingdom will emerge from Dyfed in 920, gaining cores, bordering fellow Catholic Gwent, Powys and Gwynedd east and the waters of the Celtic Sea (North Atlantic region) west.

Deheubarth will be annexed by Catholic England in 1093, emerges from control of England in 1135, re-annexed by England in 1197, losing cores and never appearing on-map again.
