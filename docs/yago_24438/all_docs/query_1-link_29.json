        "text": "Milton Marx (October 23, 1892 – April 21, 1977), better known by his stage name Gummo Marx, was an American vaudevillian performer, actor, comedian and theatrical agent.[1] He was the second youngest of the five Marx Brothers. Born in Manhattan, New York City, he worked with his brothers on the vaudeville circuit, but left acting when he was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War I (years before his brothers, Chico, Harpo, Groucho, and Zeppo, began their film careers).\n\nLife and career[]\n\nMarx was born in Manhattan, New York City, on October 23, 1892.[2] His parents were Sam Marx (called \"Frenchie\" throughout his life), and his wife, Minnie Schoenberg Marx. Marx's family was Jewish. His mother was from Dornum in East Frisia, and his father was a native of Alsace and worked as a tailor.[3][4][5]\n\nAlthough the fourth Marx Brother in age, he was the first to make his debut, pretending to be a dummy in an act with his uncle Henry Shean (né Heinemann Schoenberg) in 1899. Milton was put into a costume with a papier-mâché head and pretended to be a dummy while Henry pretended to work him. The act may have only performed once and was not helped by Shean's deafness or Milton's stammer.[6]\n\nGummo, who in an interview said he never liked being on stage, left the group and joined the military during World War I. He wasn't sent overseas because the armistice was signed shortly afterward. Gummo's younger brother Zeppo took his place in the group. Gummo later went into the raincoat business.[7] After his Army career he joined with Zeppo and operated a theatrical agency.[8] After that collaboration ended, Gummo represented his brother Groucho and worked on the television show The Life of Riley, which he helped develop. He also represented other on-screen talent and a number of writers. Gummo was well respected as a businessman. He rarely had contracts with those he represented, his philosophy being that, if they liked his work, they would continue to use him, and if not, they would seek representation elsewhere.[9]\n\nAround the time he left his brothers' Vaudeville act, Marx applied for a patent for a clothes packing rack. On October 28, 1919, Marx was granted patent US1320335A.[10]\n\nGummo was given his nickname because he had a tendency to be sneaky backstage, and creep up on others without them knowing (like a gumshoe). Another explanation cited by biographers and family members is that Milton, being the sickliest of the brothers, often wore rubber overshoes, also called \"gumshoes,\" to protect himself from taking sick in inclement weather.[11]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nHe married Helen von Tilzer on March 16, 1929, and they were married until her death in January 1976. Their son, Robert, was born in 1930.[12]\n\nDeath[]\n\nGummo died on April 21, 1977, at his home in Palm Springs, California, aged 84, from a cerebral hemorrhage.[1] His death was never reported to Groucho, who by that time had become so ill and weak that it was thought the news would be a further detriment to his health. Groucho died four months later on August 19, at age 86.\n\nGummo and his wife Helen are interred next to each other in the Freedom Mausoleum at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.[13] Gummo's older brother Chico is in a crypt across the hall from them.\n\nLegacy[]\n\nHis grandsons are actors Gregg Marx, Chris Marx, and actor/producer Brett Marx, who as a child actor appeared as 'Jimmy Feldman' in 1976's comedy film The Bad News Bears.\n\nWhen Richard J. Anobile asked Groucho in The Marx Bros. Scrapbook which of his brothers to whom he was closest, Groucho replied, \"Gummo. He's a nice man, and that's more than I can say for Zeppo\".[citation needed]"
