        "text": "It has taken me over two years, but I have finally brought GROUCH BAG, my labor-of-love novel, to fruition. It launched this week in paperback and Kindle editions on Amazon. The book is intended for middle-grade and young-adult readers, but any lover of comedy will get a kick out of it, I think.\n\nIn this book, I sent 12-year old Josh Markowitz, the Class Clown of Patton Middle School, back to 1908 to convince the youthful Marx Brothers to take up comedy. At the time, and long before they received their famous nicknames, Julius, Adolph and Leonard Marx were struggling singers, trying to make it on vaudeville with an act called the Four Nightingales. (Leonard/Chico actually wasn't in the act. He was a piano player and hustler who made his living through gambling and pool-sharking.) Their mother Minnie Marx was their manager, and a ferocious stage mother who got them bookings and wanted them to stick to singing for a living. I figured the Marxes needed a boost from the future to encourage them to trust their natural instincts and be as funny on stage as they must have been in private.\n\nIt was a thrill for me to imagine scenes of the brothers at home and on the streets of New York. I tried to bring in many accurate historical elements, including their apartment on E. 92nd Street, with the enormous clock of Ehret's Brewery filling their lone window, and Harpo's brief stint as a bellhop at the Seville Hotel (now the Ace Hotel in Manhattan). Josh gets Shanghaied up the Hudson River to work in the textile mills of Oneida at one point in the book, and a key role is played by Frank \"Slivers\" Oakley, who was the Michael Jordan of circus clowns in his day. Frank Oakley's life was bittersweet: Earlier versions of my manuscript told of the death by suicide of Slivers a few years after the action of my book takes place, but I cut it out when I saw that it bogged down the story.\n\nGROUCH BAG is dedicated to my friend Sam Gladstein, a funny, cheerful guy who, as of this writing, is dealing with end-stage cancer in a Seattle hospice. Like writing about famous comedians who are long departed, I will always remember Sam for his big smile, booming voice and zest for life."
