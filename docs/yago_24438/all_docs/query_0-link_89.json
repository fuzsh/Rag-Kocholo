        "text": "There is no shortage of great Jewish comedians: Efraim Kishon, Sholem Aleichem, Woody Allen, Jerry Lewis and many others. But Groucho Marx is probably the best of them all. The success that American Jewish humor has had in the world is due to him.\n\nWoody Allen says there never was a comedian like Groucho. Mel Brooks has nothing but praise for him. Jerry Seinfeld thinks he's a genius. Anyone who watches his films, all released on DVD, just like his talk show “You bet your life” or read his books – the main ones are “Groucho and Me”, “Groucho letters”, “Memories of a Mangy Lover” – or even one of the more than 200 books about his life, you will agree with the big three comedians above. Groucho was the best of them all. Better than Efraim Kishon, SJ Perelman, Sholem Aleichem or anyone else.\n\nAbout your talk show, “You bet your life”, it is worth remembering that he was the first to do this type of interview program, which would inspire David Letterman and Jô Soares, just to name two famous interviewers.\n\nAnother invention by Groucho Marx was the famous “Escolinha”, where a group of students served as a “ladder”, that is, they gave the “cue” for his wonderful jokes. Groucho’s “Escolinha” began in “Vaudeville” and inspired several comedians in Brazil, including Chico Anysio, Ronald Golias and Carlos Alberto de Nóbrega.\n\n“Vaudeville” were variety theaters that emerged in the late 19th century in the United States and Canada. Artists and comedians performed, with music and comedy shows. Groucho's mother, Minnie, had a brother, Al Schoenberg, with the stage name Al Shean, who worked in that business. Due to the family's financial difficulties, Minnie thought that the way for her children to earn money was the world of shows. And like a good “Yiddish mame,” she was right.\n\nBut let's go back in time a little to tell Groucho's story. His parents, Sam and Minnie Marx, emigrated from the Alsace-Lorraine region to New York at the end of the 19th century. Julius Henri Marx, Groucho's real name, was born in 1890 on 78th Street, above a butcher's shop. But he spent little time in that house, because, according to him, they kept changing addresses because of his father's lack of skills, who thought he was a tailor. “Taking measurements is for the funeral home, which has to provide the coffin”, said Sam Marx. A good tailor knows the measurements just by looking at the customer.” The result, according to Groucho, is that “customers could be identified on the street, as they had one arm of their jacket shorter than the other and one leg of their pants longer.” As a result, the family always had to change addresses, hoping to gain new and unsuspecting customers, until they discovered their father's inability in the art of tailoring.\n\nBefore Groucho was born Leonard, nicknamed Chico; after Groucho came Adolpho, known as Harpo; Milton, aka Gummo and, finally, Herbert, whose nickname was Zeppo.\n\nWith five children to raise, life for the Marx family was extremely difficult. According to Groucho, “We were so poor that one day the garbage truck arrived at the house and I said – Daddy, the garbage man is there. – Tell him we don’t need anything, my father replied.”\n\nIt was thanks to Mom Minnie's obstinacy that the Marx Brothers, as they became known, entered the show business. Chico and Harpo didn't like going to school and this worried her, as she knew that without studies their children wouldn't have great opportunities in life. Groucho, on the other hand, loved studying, was an excellent student and was very sad when he had to leave school to follow his brothers in “Vaudeville”. His whole life he regretted not studying and completing the course. Self-taught, he tried to learn as much as possible, becoming a cultured and well-informed person. He read everything that came his way and the books he wrote are excellent.\n\nMinnie realized that Chico and Harpo had musical talents and while Chico learned the piano, Harpo picked up a harp abandoned by a family member in their house and became an excellent harpist (hence his nickname Harpo). With the brothers playing so well, and helped by their uncle Al Shean, they went on to earn a living in “Vaudeville”. Groucho had no musical ability and accompanied them to tell jokes and be funny. This was long before they debuted in the cinema. The other two brothers were too young for life on stage.\n\nLater, Milton, aka Gummo, at Minnie's insistence, also tried his hand at an artistic career, but he didn't have the slightest talent. He even participated in some films, but ended up becoming the manager of the Marx Brothers, as the three became known, Groucho, Harpo and Chico.\n\nLife in “Vaudeville” was not easy. The brothers had to travel from city to city to give presentations and earn a few bucks. The worst thing, according to them, was that Mom Minnie went along. I needed to take care of “the kids”. Until the day when, according to Groucho, at the insistence of the chorus girls and dancers who did not welcome the presence of the “Yiddish mame” with the group, they decided that they were already grown up and wanted to travel alone. Thanks to their talent, they began to be successful in “Vaudeville” and show business and were invited to do a film test in Hollywood. This was only possible after the appearance of talking films, as they performed playing and telling jokes.\n\nIn the first films, they repeated on screen what they did on stage, but, over time, they developed their own stories for cinema, with screenwriters and directors from the first Hollywood team.\n\nSuccess came when Irving Thalberg, the MGM wonderkid, also Jewish, began producing his films. Thalberg once said that “the world would not be in this state if Marx had been Groucho, instead of Karl (Marx)”. He was one of the greatest film producers of all time, despite dying prematurely at the age of 37.\n\nHe was mainly responsible for the success of the Marx Brothers. He chose great directors, such as Sam Wood and Norman McLeod, excellent screenwriters such as George Kaufman, Arthur Sheekman and Morrie Ryskind, and gave Groucho total freedom to create during filming. What seemed like improvisation was actually a hard work by Groucho who had a sarcastic and extremely Jewish humor.\n\nHe used a lot of self-pity and his jokes were always very clever. The kind of humor Americans call white. In addition to the writing team, each brother had a group of three or four gag men – comedians with the sole function of creating insights and jokes to add to the film. With a 100% Jewish team, the type of humor could only be Jewish.\n\nHarpo played the role of a mute and all his comedy was based on the look. He was the first great mime of the showbiz, TRUE clown, long before the emergence of the famous French mime Marcel Marceau, also Jewish! Harpo's visual humor allowed him, years later, to tour Europe and even perform in communist Russia, with great success.\n\nChico played the role of an Italian, compulsive gambler and rogue – which was no different from his real life. He was addicted to the game, he even ran away between recordings to go to the betting shop. He bet on horses, cards, races, lost everything he won and ended up being supported by his brothers.\n\nGroucho played the role of the conqueror and had a completely nonsense. His character had the walk of a mocking swindler, imitating a chicken, which became his trademark. In English, when talking about a wise-cracking hustler, you immediately know that this is old Groucho... He also had his eyebrows painted and a very thick mustache, which he later adopted by letting the real one grow. He always had a cigar in his hand or mouth. That was his great pleasure in real life. He never separated himself from this addiction.\n\nThe Marx Brothers reigned in Hollywood for years, leaving 13 films that are true masterpieces. Groucho alone participated in 13 other films, until almost 60 years old he thought it was time to stop. He was no longer old enough for the physical effort required by the character and the cinema, and he launched a radio program that lasted a few years. He was finally attracted to television, where he presented “You bet your life”, a mix of a question, answer and interview program. Groucho learned from his mother that “When you have something important to talk about, talk to the president”, and that is why throughout his life he wrote very funny letters, until one day he published them in the book “Groucho letters”.\n\nOf these, two exchanges of correspondence would become famous. One of them happened when the Marx Brothers, who worked at MGM, released the film “One Night in Casablanca”, shortly after the release of the great classic “Casablanca”, by Warner Brothers, directed by Michael Curtiz, with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. . Warner Brothers' lawyers sent him a letter saying the film's name was plagiarism and should be changed. First Groucho replied that it would be very difficult for anyone to confuse him with the beautiful Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman. Warner Brothers' lawyers, however, were not satisfied and the exchange of correspondence continued, without the lawyers, the Warner studio and the Warner brothers realizing that Groucho was just sharpening his caustic humor. Until, finally, Groucho sent a letter saying that if they thought they had rights to the name “Casablanca”, they, Julius, Leonard and Adolpho were Marx Brothers long before Jack, Sam, Albert and Harry were Warners Brothers and they would sue them for plagiarism. Either because they finally understood that everything was a joke, or out of fear of a lawsuit, Warner decided to close the case.\n\nAnother exchange of correspondence helped Groucho create one of his most brilliant and one of the most famous phrases of all time: “I don't join a club that accepts me as a member”. The story of the origin of this phrase is very funny.\n\nWhen he was already successful and rich, his daughter Melinda wanted to attend the Beverly Hills Club, an elitist club that did not allow Jews to enter and refused to accept the Julius Marx family. He then began an exchange of correspondence with the board, who did not realize that he was using all his caustic and Jewish humor to demoralize the refusal to be accepted into the club. One of the letters said that the Beverly Hills Club did not need to worry about the Marx family's Judaism because “as my daughter is half-Jewish, as she is the daughter of a mixed marriage, she promises to enter the pool only from the waist down.” After several letters from both sides, realizing that this exchange of correspondence would be harmful to the club, as Groucho made them public, they decided to accept him as a member to put an end to the matter. Then he sent the last letter that said exactly this “Please accept my resignation. I can’t go to a club that accepts me as a member.” Thus came one of the most famous and intelligent phrases in history.\n\nGroucho was a phraseist full hand. Upon receiving the book from a pedantic and arrogant author, who considered himself a humorist, he commented: “From the moment I picked up your book, I laughed compulsively. One day I intend to read it.”\n\nDespite working on television, he had a very critical sense about it: “I find television very educational. Every time I turn it on, I go to the other room and get a book.” She also has a great quote for unfriendly people: “I never forget a face. But in your case, I would be happy to make an exception.” Her sarcastic humor is present in this text: “She has that face because of her father. He is a plastic surgeon.”\n\nMarriage was also part of his mood. When a friend said “I would like to say goodbye to your wife”. Groucho quickly replied: “Me too.” Another: “Marriage is the main cause of divorce.” One more: “In Hollywood, the bride keeps the bouquet and throws the groom away.”\n\nFor me, one of the greatest examples of Groucho's intelligence and humor is the following dialogue: “Two ladies are in a restaurant and one of them comments: – The food in this place is horrible! – And the worst thing is that the portions are small – responds the other. That's life. We think it’s bad, but we complain that it’s short.”\n\nHe aged without losing his good humor and intelligence. As time passed, he also started to joke about old age and said: “Being old is nothing special, anyone can get old. All you need to do is live long enough.”\n\nGroucho worked hard all his life, afraid of the poor times of his childhood. He became rich by the standards of the time and also joked about it. At a dinner, he refused the bread that the waiter offered, because “he was rich enough to not need to eat any more bread”. Groucho lived a lot, but not enough for his fans. He says in one of his autobiographies that, at the age of 80, he heard emotionally from a fan, on the street, “Please, never die!”. He died at the age of 87, despite smoking cigars from a young age. He married three times, the last time to a woman who was 43 years younger than him, and this marriage lasted only fifteen years and, according to him, only one sentence remained: “The ideal woman should look like Marilyn Monroe (one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood) and speak like George S. Kaufman (genius writer, screenwriter and comedian)”. He had three children, Arthur, Miriam and Melinda, none of whom had the talent to follow their father's career.\n\nGroucho is probably responsible for the well-known Jewish-American humor, which is so successful around the world. He brought the intelligent, caustic, self-pitying humor of sthtels to America and Hollywood. Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Jerry Seinfeld, Jerry Lewis, Adam Sandler, Jack Benny, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, Billy Cristal and all American Jewish comedians owe it to Groucho Marx for opening the doors to the humor of Yiddish kopf."
