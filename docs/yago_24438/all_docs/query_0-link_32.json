        "text": "\"MINNIE'S BOYS\" recalls a time when musicals were overflowing and most of them sank -- like the 1969-70 season, which produced 30 Broadway and Off Broadway musicals and more than a dozen song and dance revues. Of such bounty, \"Company\" is the only Broadway candidate for posterity.\n\nUnlike that season's star-driven vehicles, \"Applause\" (Lauren Bacall) and \"Coco\" (Katharine Hepburn), \"Minnie's Boys,\" which prevailed upon an uneasy Shelley Winters to play a martyred mama to the Marx Brothers in ascent, has had a semblance of afterlife. And in stock and touring productions, the show, a 10-week casualty after eight weeks of previews, has certainly outlasted its fellow flops of the season. Does anybody revive \"Jimmy,\" \"Gantry,\" \"Georgy\" or \"Park\"?\n\nIt's no surprise that the Forum Theater Group, the state's repository of uncelebrated musicals with the accent on Jewish themes, is bringing back Minnie Marx (\"That Minnie Marx has her hands full\" goes the first lyric) and her \"five growing boys\" (the first song title). What is surprising is that the theater waited so long.\n\nUnlike \"Gypsy,\" which chronicles the chicaneries and uncovers the motivations of a crazed stage mother who manipulates the careers of two daughters, \"Minnie's Boys\" simplifies the machinations of Minnie Schoenberg (herself stage-struck, an impulse herein unexplored) to scattered good-hearted antics and gaffes.\n\nOne of her miscalculations almost wrecked a big chance for her boys, \"whose middle name is crazy,\" on the vaudeville circuit by antagonizing the fearsome E. F. Albee, the man who announced, \"I own vaudeville.\"\n\nSister of Al Shean (of the vaudeville team Gallagher and Shean), daughter of a traveling magician who \"made whole audiences disappear\" and wife to a poor but dapper and affectionate tailor (Sam Marx), Minnie is, in all connotations, more of a sketch than a driving force. (The role was originally written with Totie Fields in mind; it was Groucho Marx who reportedly insisted on Miss Winters.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
