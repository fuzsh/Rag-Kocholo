Cason contended that Rawlings’ description of ‘her’ character in Rawlings’ book Cross Creek made her out to be a ‘hussy’ and sued the author for invasion of privacy (the courts of the time found libel to be too ambiguous). It was a cause of action that had never been argued in a Florida court. “That was a time when a woman lawyer was a novelty in the South, and man’s moonshine was nobody’s business, and an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit was something of a brand-new issue, which eventually became a popular reason for going to court.” Jack Lyons, Theatre & Film\n\n~\n\nTHINKING CAP THEATRE\n\nA Public Reading of an Unproduced Screenplay\n\nabout the Death of Walt Disney\n\nSeptember 9 – 25\n\nBy Lucas Hnath\n\nTickets: $35 ($37.22 with s/c)\n\nFor Tickets: 813-220-1546\n\nwww.thinkingaptheatre.com\n\nPerformances:\n\nThursday – Saturday at 8 pm\n\nSunday at 5 pm\n\nThe Vanguard\n\n1501 S.

She meets TV producer-director Vito Pignoli when she (unsuccessfully) auditions for one of his commercials. Vito is charmed by Theda’s offbeat take on life. After the audition they share a cab, and Vito, the nice guy that he is, helps Theda carry her Christmas packages to her door. She invite’s Vito in, hoping he will read her latest ‘masterpiece’ and help connect her to a producer. Vito happily accepts the invitation, but he has other things on his mind. What happens there, on that fateful snowy Christmas Eve in Theda’s East Village apartment is the basis of this laugh-out-loud madcap comedy.\n\nThe Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)\n\nOctober 14 – 23, 2016\n\nBy Adam Long, Daniel Singer, and Jess Winfield\n\nDirected by Kimberly Rommel-Enright\n\nIn collaboration with Steve Enright\n\nTickets: $21\n\nPerformance Schedule:\n\nFriday, October 14 – 8 p m\n\nSaturday, October 15 – 8 p m\n\nSunday, October 16 – 8 pm\n\nWednesday, October 19 – 8 pm\n\nThursday, October 20 – 8 pm\n\nSaturday, October 22 – 8 pm\n\nSunday, October 23 – 2 pm\n\nHow on earth can three men do the impossible: act through William Shakespeare’s entire canon – 37 plays – in 97 minutes? By summarizing the canon through football plays, rap songs, and outrageously condensed comedy, mash-up titles (like Four Weddings and a Transvestite) of course! The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) hilariously summarizes all of Shakespeare’s plays using reenactments and audience participation. It is famous for holding the (self-proclaimed) record for the shortest production of Hamlet at 43 seconds. An extremely popular play that ran in London for nine years and has enjoyed countless productions in various languages throughout the world, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) entertains and teaches audiences facts about Shakespeare while ensuring them a rollicking good time.\n\nTick Tick… Boom!\n\nBy Jonathan Larson\n\nNovember 4 – 11, 2016\n\nDirected by Kimberly Rommel-Enright\n\nTickets: $23\n\nPerformance Schedule:\n\nFriday, November 4 – 8 pm\n\nSaturday, November 5 – 8 pm\n\nTuesday, November 8 – 8 pm\n\nWednesday, November 9 – 8 pm\n\nThursday, November 10 – 8 pm\n\nFriday, November 11 – 8 pm\n\nBefore Rent, there was Tick, Tick… Boom!

Leo is fresh from a cross-country bike ride, and assures Vera that he won’t stay long. Leo, however, is in crisis, confused by an on-again, off-again romance, furious with his mother’s incessant meddling, and grieving deeply for his best friend and biking partner, Micah, who is recently deceased. While Leo seeks solace in his grandmother, Vera finds companionship in another person since the loss of her husband, Joe. A finalist for the 2013 Pulitzer Prize in Drama, Amy Herzog’s 4000 Miles is a compassionate, intimate, and frequently funny play that examines the love of family we can choose, the family we can’t, and the healing power of trust.\n\nThe 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee\n\nConceived by Rebecca Feldman;\n\nadditional material by Jay Reiss\n\nMusic and Lyrics by William Finn\n\nBook by Rachel Sheinkin\n\nMarch 3 – 12, 2017\n\nDirector: TBA\n\nTickets: $23\n\nPerformance Schedule:\n\nFriday, March 3 – 8pm\n\nSaturday, March 4 – 8pm\n\nSunday, March 5 – 2pm\n\nTuesday, March 7 – 8pm\n\nWednesday, March 8 – 8pm\n\nThursday, March 9 – 8pm\n\nFriday, March 10 – 8pm\n\nSaturday, March 11 – 8pm\n\nSunday, March 12 – 2pm\n\nAn eclectic group of six-graders arrives at The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, each eager to win for very different reasons.

In hilarious, touching, and catchy songs, each speller reveals his/her hopes, struggles, and passions as they make their way through the competition. With an engaging, tuneful score by William Finn and a sweet, funny book by Rachel Sheinkin, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee causes audiences to fall in love, both with the show itself and its “perspicacious,” “jocular,” and “effervescent” spellers.\n\nBarefoot in the Park\n\nBy Neil Simon\n\nApril 7 – 16, 2017\n\nDirector: Jim Tyminski\n\nTickets $21\n\nPerformance Schedule:\n\nFriday, April 7 – 8pm\n\nSaturday, April 8 – 8pm\n\nSunday, April 9 – 2pm\n\nTuesday, April 11 – 8pm\n\nWednesday, April 12 – 8pm\n\nThursday, April 13 – 8pm\n\nFriday, April 14 – 8pm\n\nSaturday, April 15 – 8pm\n\nSunday, April 16 – 2pm\n\nCorie and Paul are newlyweds, fresh from their honeymoon.

When they don’t see eye-to-eye about their apartment, their neighbors, and their sex drive, the new marriage experiences its first patch of rough weather.\n\nChildren’s Series\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n\nBy Tim Kelly\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Bill Francoeur\n\nAugust 5 – 7, 2016\n\nDirector: Sean Gogan\n\nTickets: $15\n\nPerformance Schedule:\n\nFriday, August 5 – Sold Out\n\nSaturday, August 6 – 1 pm Sold Out\n\nSaturday, August 6 – 6 pm\n\nSaturday, August 7 – Sold Out\n\nAll our old friends, plus a few new ones, are here in this marvelous musical adaptation. We’ll meet the captivating Princess Snow White, the prince, the evil queen, and, of course, the seven mischievous dwarfs — Sarge, Gabby, Gloomy Gus, Ticklish, Spritely, Snore, and Slowpoke.

Listen to the tom-tom drums and the message spoken by the “Wordspinner” that opens and closes this charming adventure suitable for all age groups. The name Pocahontas, belonging to the daughter of the powerful Algonquin Chief Powhatan, means “She-Who-Likes-To-Be-Mischievous.” It’s a fitting name, because the princess enjoys playing tricks and games, especially with Wolf, Raven and Squirrel… her playmates in the forest. She also makes friends with the English settlers in the struggling community of Jamestown. They have no food, and sickness has almost wiped them out. Pocahontas would like to help them, but Thundercloud, the medicine man, forbids it. When Captain John Smith, the leader of Jamestown, comes to the Indian village, he is condemned to death. In a thrilling scene, Princess Pocahontas saves his life and finds a way for the Indians and the settlers to live in harmony and friendship. This colorful play features a wonderful cast of characters: Little Running Rabbit, Brave Eagle, Aunt Morning Star, Forest Spirits, Mother Earth and the people of Jamestown. Filled with Native American lore and true to the original legend, it’s an entertaining and fascinating page from our country’s history that glows with excitement and warmth.\n\n~\n\nMy Son the Waiter: A Jewish Tragedy\n\nBy Brad Zimmerman\n\nDecember 15, 2016 – January 29, 2017\n\nTickets: $45 – $65\n\nPhone: 855-448-7469\n\nOn Line: MySonTheWaiter.com\n\nGroups: 888-264-1788\n\nGroup Rates:\n\nWed/Thurs/Fri – Groups 12-19 $43.50 / Groups 20 + $38.50\n\nSat /Sun – Groups 12-19 $48.50 / Groups 20 + $43.50\n\nShowtimes:\n\nWednesday 7:30 pm\n\nThursday 2:00 pm & 7:30 pm\n\nFriday 7:30 pm\n\nSaturday 2:00 pm & 7:30 pm\n\nSunday 2:00 pm\n\nMizner Park Cultural Arts Center/Studio Theatre 2nd Floor\n\n201 Plaza Real\n\nBoca Raton, FL 3342\n\n(Opposite Lord & Taylor)\n\nmysonthewaiter.com\n\nLike Us on Facebook!
