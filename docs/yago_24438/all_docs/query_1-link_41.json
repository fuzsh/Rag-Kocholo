        "text": "\"A Night at the Opera\" was also the brothers' first film without Zeppo, although there were four members of the family in the film. Sam Marx, their father, appeared in two scenes as an extra. The three remaining Marx Brothers -- Groucho, Harpo and Chico -- made five more films at MGM -- \"A Day at the Races\" (1937), \"Room Service\" (1938), \"At the Circus\" (1939), \"Go West\" (1940) and \"The Big Store\" (1941). After taking several years off, they returned to the screen in \"A Night in Casablanca\" (1946) and \"Love Happy\" (1950) -- which is perhaps less significant as the Marx Brothers' final film together than it is as one of the first film appearances of a young actress named Marilyn Monroe.\n\nWith his film career essentially over, the 60-year-old Groucho moved to a new medium - television - as the host of \"You Bet Your Life,\" a comedy and quiz show that premiered in 1950 and ran for more than 10 years. Groucho started hosting \"You Bet Your Life\" on radio in 1947, and the show was popular more for Groucho's interviews with the contestants than for the actual question and answer portion of the show. Though Groucho never received any major awards during his film career, he won an Emmy in 1951 as \"Most Outstanding Personality\" for his work on \"You Bet Your Life.\" The show was also nominated for five Emmy awards, first as Best Comedy Show, and later as Best Quiz Show. In 1948, \"You Bet Your Life\" won a Peabody Award, which honors distinguished achievement and meritorious service in radio and television.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, a new generation of fans discovered the Marx Brothers. In May 1972, Groucho appeared in \"An Evening With Groucho,\" a sold-out performance at Carnegie Hall in New York City. In 1974, Groucho was given an honorary Academy Award, \"in recognition of his brilliant creativity and for the unequaled achievements of the Marx Brothers in the art of motion picture comedy.\"\n\nAfter Marx died in 1977, his remains were placed at Eden Memorial Park. Five years later, in May 1982, his ashes were stolen, and were found later that day at the gates of Mount Sinai Memorial Park in Los Angeles, about 12 miles away. The kidnapper -- or, in this case, ash-napper -- has never been caught, and so the questions remain. Why were Marx's ashes stolen? An obsessed fan looking for the ultimate souvenir? A ghoulish opportunist planning to make a ransom demand, then changing his mind? Or simply someone who thought the comedian should be buried at a more high-profile location closer to Hollywood?\n\nWhatever the reason, the management at Eden Memorial Park responded to the incident by moving Marx's remains to a more remote location in a room inside the mausoleum, and installing security monitoring devices throughout the cemetery. And they also are reluctant to give out the location of any of their more-famous residents.\n\nRecently, the American Film Institute selected a ranked list of \"America's 100 funniest movies\" of the past century. Even though the Marx Brothers made only 13 films together, they placed five in the top 100, including \"Duck Soup\" (ranked 5th on the list), \"A Night at the Opera\" (12th), \"A Day at the Races\" (59th), \"Horse Feathers\" (65th) and \"Monkey Business\" (73rd). \"Duck Soup\" also appeared in the 85th spot on AFI's list of the top 100 films of all time.\n\nGroucho was married three times, and had three children. His son, Arthur Marx, is a successful scriptwriter and author of several Hollywood biographies.\n\nMarx was born Julius Henry Marx in New York City, NY, on Oct. 2, 1890. He died on Aug. 19, 1977, in Los Angeles, CA. BIO\n\nBack to biographies page"
