        "text": "Going in chronological order of their deaths, on September 13, 1929, Minnie had a seizure on her way home from Zeppo and his wife's house from a Sabbath dinner, but Frenchy told the driver to turn around and go back to the house where the boys were still gathered. She died the next day in Harpo's arms.\n\nLeonard (Chico) Marx\n\nChico died of arteriosclerosis on October 11, 1961, being the first brother born, and the first to go.\n\nSecond born, second to pass; Adolph/Arthur (Harpo) Marx died during open heart surgery on September 28, 1964, the day of his and Susan's wedding anniversary. He, like the other brothers, had problems with his heart. He had many strokes and I believe one or two minor heart attacks. When Harpo died, he was cremated, and his ashes were reportedly sprinkled in the sand trap at the 7th hole of the Rancho Mirage golf course that he occasionally played golf at, and he donated his harp to the state of Israel. His death hit the living Marx Brothers, especially Groucho, the hardest. Because he spent most of his time with Chico and Harpo, he had the most memories with them. Because Harpo was gone, Groucho could no longer reminisce. Groucho's son Arthur said Harpo's memorial was the only time he ever remembers seeing his father cry.\n\nRancho Mirage's golf course\n\nThe only out of order death is Gummo's. He died on April 21, 1977, only four months before his brother, and his the brother he was closest to at that. When Gummo died, no one told Groucho because he was already really weak and ill at this time and they knew if they told him, it would make his health much worse.\n\nAs said above, Groucho died four months after his brother Gummon on August 19, 1977. Groucho had had strokes all his life when he got much older. He had to begin having fake salt on his food that Bill Cosby mocked him about. After Harpo's death, he became much worse. That's why again, as said above, they didn't tell him of Gummo's death. Groucho was cremated and he jokingly said he wanted his epitaph to say \"Excuse me, I can't stand up\" But now, it only bears his name, when he was born, when he died, and a star of David to represent his Judaism. Yes, the Marx Brothers were Jewish. Sadly, his death was a bit overshadowed because Elvis Presley died 3 days before.\n\nAlthough Groucho had the longest life span of all the brothers, Zeppo outlived him only a couple of years. He became sick with cancer in 1978, he sold his home and moved to a new one on the fairway off Frank Sinatra Drive. The doctors thought it was gone, but it wasn't and he told Barbara to take him back to the doctor, he spent the last few days of his life with Barbara and her family. Frank and Barbara both attended his funeral. Zeppo was the third brother to become cremated. Like Harpo, his were spread. But Zeppo's were spread over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nNone of them lived past the 1980s, yes, but we will never forget them."
