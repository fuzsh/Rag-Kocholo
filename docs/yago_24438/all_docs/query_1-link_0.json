        "text": "Mother and manager of the Marx Brothers (1864-1929)\n\nMinnie Marx (born Miene Schönberg, 9 November 1864 – 13 September 1929)[2] was the mother and manager of the Marx Brothers, a family of top-billed vaudevillians, top Broadway stars and, finally, film stars. She was also the sister of comedian and vaudeville star Al Shean.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMarx was born Miene Schönberg in Dornum, Kingdom of Hanover. Her parents Fanny née Salomons (1829–April 10,1901) and Levy \"Lafe\" Schönberg (1823–1919)[3] were members of the local Jewish community. Her mother was a yodeling harpist, her father a ventriloquist. Her younger brother, Abraham Elieser Adolf, the future \"Al Shean,\" was born in 1868.\n\nAbout 1880 the family immigrated to New York City, where Minnie married Samuel \"Frenchie\" Marx in 1884.[4]\n\nHer son Manfred died in infancy in 1886. Her other children were Leonard Joseph (born 1887), Adolph (1888), Julius (1890), Milton (1892) and Herbert (1901), who would grow up to perform as the Marx Brothers.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile managing the Marx Brothers, she went under the name of Minnie Palmer, so that booking agents would not know that the agent representing the Marx Brothers was their mother. She played the harp.\n\nAs a tribute to her, all the brothers' daughters were given names that began with 'M': Chico with Maxine; Harpo with Minnie; and Groucho with Miriam and Melinda. Gummo and Zeppo had no daughters.[citation needed]\n\nMinnie lived long enough to see her sons' 1929 film debut in The Cocoanuts, but died later that year of a stroke.\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nMarx died from a stroke on September 13, 1929, aged 64. She was buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, Queens. When her husband died four years later, he was buried next to her.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nMarx and some of her sons appear briefly as characters in Glen David Gold's novel Carter Beats the Devil; the narrative identifies her as Minnie Palmer, and only gradually offers clues that the struggling vaudeville act traveling with her are the later-famous Marx Brothers. Marx (played by Shelley Winters) was also the main character in the stage musical Minnie's Boys.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBiography portal"
