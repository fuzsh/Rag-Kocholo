        "text": "Samuel Marx, born Simon Marx (October 23, 1859 – May 10, 1933), was the husband of Minnie Marx, and father of the Marx Brothers.\n\nHe was born in Mertzwiller, Alsace, France in 1859, and he died on May 10, 1933 in Los Angeles, California. He met Minnie in New York where he was working as a dance teacher. They married in 1884 and had 6 sons. Their first son, Manfred, born 1885, died in infancy. The other children were born in 1887, Chico, 1888, Harpo, 1890, Groucho, 1892, Gummo and 1901, Zeppo.\n\nSam became a tailor, although not a very good one. He was a talented cook, often convincing the landlord to delay their rent paytime with a good meal. In his show An Evening With Groucho, Groucho reminisces about Sam Marx: In his last interview, Zeppo also told:\n\nSam Marx did a cameo appearance in his four sons' film Monkey Business (1931), sitting on top of luggage behind the brothers on the pier as they wave to the First Officer, the boys having slipped off the ship without being arrested as stowaways.\n\nExternal links"
