        "text": "He left The Marx Brothers just when they were reaching popularity because he felt he lacked the performing skills of his brothers. He joined the military instead to help with the war and was replaced by his younger brother.\n\nHis older brother Groucho Marx, who passed away only four months after him, was never told of his death as his family believed that it was a kindness not to tell him.\n\nHis nickname, and those of his brothers, were elicited by a comic strip called \"Knocko the Monk,\" which triggered a brief rash of nicknames ending in -o. During a backstage poker game in a vaudeville house, another performer, while dealing cards, offered \"a card for Chick-o,\" the brother who chased the chicks, and then \"a card for Harp-o,\" the brother who played the harp. Gummo's nickname came from his habit of sneaking up on people backstage, like some kind of \"gumshoe\" detective."
