        "meta_description": "Title supplied by cataloger.Adolph \"Harpo\" Marx (later Arthur \"Harpo\" Marx, 1888-1964) was an actor and comedian involved with film, television and stage. The second oldest of five Marx brothers, he was best recognized as the brother who never spoke, using a horn or whistle to do so instead, and using facial expressions and mime to get his point across. He wore a curly reddish wig, and became famous for pulling an infinite number of props stored inside his topcoat's oversized pockets. Harpo got his stage name due to the fact that he played the harp, though he was never formally trained. He made a number of notable television appearances in the 1960s, the two final being in the fall of 1962. Harpo married actress Susan Fleming in 1936 and unlike his brothers, stayed married to the same spouse until his death. They adopted four children: Bill, Alex, Jimmy and Minnie. Harpo Max died on September 1964 at the age of 75 after undergoing open-heart surgery following a heart attack, and his brothers took this death extremely hard. He was cremated and it is reported that his ashes were sprinkled into the sand trap at the seventh hole of the Rancho Mirage golf course.Pictured is Bill Marx and close friend, Cherie Dong. He is the eldest of Harpo Marx and wife, Susan Fleming's four adopted children. The photo may have been taken at uncle, Groucho Marx's funeral. Photograph dated August 21, 1977.",
