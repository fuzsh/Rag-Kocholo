        "text": "Having written about the Marx Brothers mother, and their maternal grandfather and their Uncle Al, we thought it better not to neglect their father, Simon “Sam” Marx (1859-1933), known universally as “Frenchie”.\n\nThe nickname arose not because Sam was ethnically French, but because he was from the Jewish community in Alsace. His native language was the Alsatian dialect of Yiddish. The Marx Brothers loved both their parents immoderately, but in Frenchie’s case, the love was not mingled with respect. He was a gentle soul, and a very weak disciplinarian. He was also not much of a breadwinner. In the old country, his father had been some sort of merchant. Frenchie himself earned his living as a famously bad tailor, who measured out his custom suits by eyeball, not a tape measure. There is lore (apparently apocryphal) that the vaudeville song “Sam, You Made the Pants Too Long”, popularized by performers like Milton Berle, Red Buttons, and Barbra Streisand, was about Frenchie. If it were true, I think we’d have heard more from the brothers about it. Ironically, everyone seemed to think that Frenchie was a wizard in the kitchen, however. Perhaps he would have had better professional success as a chef, rather than a tailor. But in any case, he was always needing to refund money to his customers, and the family struggled on account of it. Thus the lure of his wife’s family’s line: show business.\n\nApparently, the dashing and handsome Frenchie was not allergic to performing either. He had met Minnie while teaching a dance class. Gummo seems to have been the Marx Brother who inherited that talent from his dad. Both Gummo and Groucho were said to have favored Frenchie rather than Minnie. As for Chico and Harpo, Frenchie’s primary gift to them seems to have been skill at pinochle. (Although Harpo seems to have been the same kind of gentle, kind, pushover father as Frenchie). Lastly, it seems to me that as eccentric entrepreneurs in their second careers, Gummo and Zeppo were somewhat following in their dad’s footsteps. Frenchie was also often the designated audience plant whose job it was to cue laughter during their early days in vaudeville.\n\nYou can see Frenchie fleetingly in Monkey Business (1931). He has a cameo in that film. He died a few months later."
