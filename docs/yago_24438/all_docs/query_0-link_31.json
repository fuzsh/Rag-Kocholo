Because he later employed an Italian accent in the Marx Brothers' act, people assumed his name was pronounced \"Cheeko.\" Instead, Leonard was dubbed \"Chicko\" for his other consuming passion, women (or \"chicks\"), at which he was more successful than gambling, but when a typesetter dropped the \"k\" out of his name, the brothers let it stay as Chico. Chico was the brother who guided the Marxes to stardom. He took over the act's managment (amicably) from their mother, Minnie, and through audacity and charm, Chico secured the Brothers their first international (London) booking, their first Broadway show and their MGM contract with Irving Thalberg, among other successes.\n\nChico adopted the Italian dialect routines no doubt from the many Italian immigrants he grew up with in his New York City neighborhood. An avid gambler and womanizer (chasing \"chicks\" some say is how he got his nickname), he was an accomplished pianist with his own unique finger pecking style."
