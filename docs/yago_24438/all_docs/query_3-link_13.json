H. Brandt officiating. They were attended by the groomâ€™s brother and sister, Walter and Elsie Miller. The groom, who is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Ed Miller, who have just moved to the city from their farm in Pine Valley, Clark County, is an active and industrious young man. He is well posted on all lines of farming and knows how to make farming pay. He is a young man of good character in every way and well liked by his neighbors. The bride is well qualified to take the management of a home. She is bright and intelligent and makes friends readily. The young couple began housekeeping at once on the Miller farm south of the city. We join in wishing them success and happiness."
