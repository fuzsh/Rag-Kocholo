        "text": "Drawing the Marx Brothers\n\nThe Marx Brothers/1935\n\nOver the years I've drawn the funny and brilliant Marx brothers (and specifically Groucho Marx, who I had the pleasure of meeting on three separate occasions in my teenage years) a number of times. This portrait is my latest limited edition print, the three Marx brothers at the time they were filming \"A Night at the Opera\" at MGM in 1935.\n\nThe imaged was commissioned for the book \"The Art of the Marx Brothers\", to be published by Fantagraphics books in 2014, edited by Daniel Kinske, and will include hundreds of illustrations and cartoons of the Marx's, including many by the legendary Al Hirschfeld.\n\nThe Swedish wrestler/actor Tor Johnson appeared on \"You Bet Your Life\" in 1960. I transcribed the interview in 1982 and created this illustration to appear with it for STOP! magazine\n\n/www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcjwdRn_n-M\n\nGroucho Marx in 1975 celebrating his 85th birthday. Drawn in 1985, unpublished till now.\n\nRobin Williams, Ellen DeGeneres and Chris Rock channeling the Marx Brothers famous \"Stateroom Scene\" from \"A Night at the Opera\". Drawn in charcoal pencil for Entertainment Weekly, 1998\n\nCreated in 2006 for my book of portraits \"Old Jewish Comedians\", L To R: Groucho, Chico and Harpo\n\n\"More Old Jewish Comedians\" (2007) Zeppo & Gummo Marx\n\nFrom the NY Observer/2005, Groucho appears with T.S. Eliot in panel #2\n\nCover art created for the autobiography of comedy writer (\"At the Circus\", \"Go West\") and close friend of Groucho's, Irvng Brecher, \"The Wicked Wit of the West\" (a phrase coined by Groucho )\n\n\"You Bet Your Life\" starring Groucho Marx. This image was created as a limited edition print and features Groucho in 1960 at age 70.\n\nhttp://www.drewfriedman.net/prints/groucho.html\n\nGroucho Marx posed with his Captain Spaulding pith helmet circa 1972. Image created for the cover of the memoir \"Raised Eyebrows\" by Steve Stoliar (Bear Manor Media)\n\ncover designed by Monte Beauchamp\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCesar Romero Records\n\n↧\n\n\"Minnie's Boys\", The 1970 Broadway Musical\n\nMinnie's Boys\n\n\"A Rollicking New Marx Brothers Musical\"\n\n\"Minnie's Boys\", the legendary Broadway musical Flop about the early days of the Marx brothers and their mother/manager Minnie, (producer Sol Siegel's planned film biography of the Marx bros, also called \"Minnie's boys\" had been in the works several years earlier but never got beyond a script) the driving force behind their success, was first conceived by Groucho's son, writer Arthur Marx who proposed the idea to producer Arthur Whitelaw (or as S.J. Perleman referred to him in a letter to his friend Al Hirschfeld \"Outlaw\") in 1969.\n\nArthur Whitelaw\n\nThe idea for the show seemed like a good one at the time. The Marx brothers had become counter-culture heros to a new generation of young fans, their films enjoying renewed interest via film book bios, television showings, college campus screenings, and movie revival houses. A Broadway musical about the rise of the Marx's early days, beginning as a singing quartet, then onto vaudeville and Broadway success seemed like it couldn't fail, recreating some of their wild comedy sketches along the way, and featuring the ultimate stage mother, a variation of Mama Rose of \"Gypsy\", Minnie Marx.\n\nMinnie Marx\n\n1865-1929\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnie_Marx\n\nWhitelaw was friends with Groucho Marx, so the producer signed the 79 year old comedian on as the \"production consultant\", most likely to appease him and to avoid any possible Marx family lawsuits. From his home in Los Angeles, Groucho was consulted on many decisions to do with the early stages of the show, including choosing the books author and the pivotal role of the actress who would portray his mother.\n\nShelley Winters as Minnie Marx with fellow cast members\n\nportraying the four\n\nyoung Marx brothers (brother Gummo had retired from the act at this point)\n\nNeil Simon, at the time Broadway's most successful playwright, was first approached and instantly turned down the offer. Then the young stand up comedian and Marx brothers fan David Steinberg was offered the job and wrote a script, which was instantly rejected by Groucho. Finally, at Groucho's suggestion, what seemed to be the logical choice, his son Arthur, a veteran film and TV comedy writer who had enjoyed a big Broadway success several seasons earlier with his comedy \"The Impossible Years\" (Starring Alan King), and who had already written about his father and uncles in his book \"Life with Groucho\" (and a later followup \"Son of Groucho\")\n\nArthur Marx was hired to write the show's book along with his \"The Impossible Years\" collaborator Robert Fisher.\n\nArthur Marx, son of Groucho, grandson of Minnie\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Marx\n\nGroucho Marx, circa 1970\n\nFor the starring role of Minnie Marx, Whitelaw and Arthur Marx first suggested to Groucho the idea of casting the chubby comedienne Totie Fields, who could also sing. Groucho HATED the idea and famously dismissed her as being \"Too Jewish\". When two-time Oscar winner Shelley Winters was proposed (also Jewish) Groucho liked the idea of casting a method actress and larger than life movie star, plus he had always admired her \"big knockers\", so she was hired, despite being vocally challenged. Still, to Groucho she looked and sounded the part, large and loud, with \"Germanic\" (blonde) features, like his mother.\n\nTotie Fields: \"Too Jewish\"\n\nShelley Winters.\n\nGroucho admired her \"big knockers\"\n\nFor some reason (perhaps to keep costs down?) rather than hiring established Broadway songwriters such as Stephen Sondheim, Julie Stein, Jerry Herman, John Kander & Fred Ebb or Lee Adams & Charles Strauss, Whitelaw hired two Broadway novices, Hal Hackady (lyrics) and Larry Grossman (music)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Hackady\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Grossman_(composer)\n\nThe show was cast with five unknown actors portraying the young Marx brothers, and after a few false starts with various directors, Stanley Prager, who had directed many episodes of the classic early sixties sitcom \"Car 54 Where Are You?\" was hired and the production went into rehearsals.\n\nIt wasn't long after the previews began that word began to leak out that there were severe problems with the show, audience members were walking out and the laughs just weren't coming where they should, so comedy writers were being invited to assess the show and offer suggestions, to \"punch things up\", among them, veteran Marx brothers writer and longtime Groucho friend S.J.Perelman (who described what he saw to his friend Al Hirschfeld: \"a scalding descent into a tub of such merde as hasn't been seen outside a Catskill Summer Camp show\" and declined the offer to help),\n\nGroucho and S. J. Perelman\n\nand Joseph Stein, who had written the book for \"Fiddler on the Roof\". Stein would attempt to do extensive script rewriting.\n\nOne witness pinpointed what was perhaps the main problem: \"whenever Minnie's Boys got funny, their mom (in the shape of Shelley Winters) would come in and Gummo up the works\".\n\nThe poster for the show, artist unknown (to me)\n\nIn early 1970, Minnie's Boys seemed to be in preview limbo, always a bad sign, seemingly lurching along with no official announced opening date, the speculation that it was heading to be a big turkey after all (which even Groucho was privately admitting to friends). Shelley Winters was having problems memorizing the constantly changing dialog, was plagued with laryngitis, throwing temper tantrums, and the show was rumored to be in turmoil with constant changes to the flimsy script, and songs being added and subtracted nightly\n\nIt was at one of these previews in early 1970 that my family and I went to see the show and I ... loved it! Of course, being 11 years old, I tended to love every show I was taken to see, especially the big Broadway musicals. But I was already a huge Marx brothers fan so getting to witness the young Marx boys slowly evolve into the characters of the Marx brothers was thrilling for me, and if the music was unmemorable, and Shelley Winters shrill and unable to actually sing the songs (she \"yelled\" them), it didn't bother me. To me, I was witnessing the Marx brothers live in full color on stage!\n\nthe (actual) Marx brothers\n\nBy FAR the standout of the show was the character of Groucho in the guise of the young actor Lewis J. Stadlen (the son of famed voice artist Allen Swift), who had beat out almost 1000 other actors for the role and was making his Broadway debut. He INHABITED Groucho Marx, in voice, gestures, mannerisms (even perfecting the Groucho \"walk\"). He was truly memorable, evolving from the young sensitive Julius Henry Marx to the leering, wisecracking, cigar-chomping Groucho, and adding his own subtle moves along the way. He would deservedly go on to win the Drama Desk and Theatre World awards for his performance later in the year.\n\nShelley Winters and the young actor cast as Julius Henry Marx (Groucho), Lewis J. Stadlen. Stadlen would later write about Shelley Winters in his memoir:\n\n“she was a person who demanded to be difficult, as a means of exhausting the world around her.”\n\nThe five young men hired to portray the Marx brothers (before their haircuts) from the bottom up: Milton (Gummo) Gary Raucher, Leonard (Chico) Irwin Pearl, Adolph (Harpo) Daniel Fortus, Julius (Groucho) Lewis J. Stadlen, Herbie (Zeppo) Alvin Kupperman\n\nShelley Winters and Groucho Marx in New York during the previews\n\nWhen word reached Groucho that the show was in serious trouble during the early previews, he flew into New York on new years day 1970 for an extended stay at the Regency hotel in a halfhearted attempt to live up to his \"production consultant\" credit. Aside from appearing with the five young actors dressed as the Marx brothers on the Dick Cavett show, this would consist mainly of backstage reminiscing to the mesmerized cast and crew about the Marx brother's early vaudeville days and distracting everyone from rehearsing.\n\nArthur Whitelaw solved this problem by hiring a young, sexy personal secretary for Groucho, to keep HIM distracted by walking and dining with him throughout Times Square. Groucho would eventually even propose marriage to her (his marriage to his third wife Eden had just ended). Still, he was in attendance nightly at the Imperial Theatre during the previews, including the evening I would see the show.\n\nMy Minnie's Boys playbill, autographed by Groucho\n\nArriving at the Imperial theatre to see Minnie's Boys, I noticed a commotion in the lobby, and sure enough it was Groucho Marx himself, greeting fans and autographing playbills. I was thrilled to be in his very presence, even a clearly old and slightly befuddled Groucho (by 1970, he had already suffered several minor strokes) but I didn't approach him because the house lights were about to dim for the show to begin. I bided my time and sure enough, at intermission he was again stationed in the lobby autographing and greeting fans, his comely \"secretary\" close by his side. Being 11, I was able to tunnel my way through the crowds and burrow my way right up to him where I presented my playbill which he quickly inscribed and handed back.\n\nI was in heaven and little did I suspect that this would be the first of three times I would make his acquaintance. It was an amazing evening for me, aside from loving the show, also getting to encounter a true comedy legend, the one, the only... Groucho\n\nFrom the playbill, the cast and crew\n\nStill, despite my biased 11 year old perspective of the show, when it did finally officially open (after 64 previews) in late March, the reviews ranged from so-so to poor, with most of the New York critics complaining about the \"haphazard book\" and \"lackluster score\", \"lesser\" actors pretending to be the Marx brothers, a \"coy, watered-down version of Gypsy\", and Shelley Winters \"abrasive\" performance and \"obvious lack of singing talent\" as Minnie. Also, as pointed out by several Marx scholars, the script took quite a few liberties with the facts, including beginning the play with 5 young boys as the Marx brothers when in fact the youngest brother Zeppo was 14 years younger than Chico, the eldest. In other words, When Chico (and Harpo) were young teenagers, Zeppo was still an infant.\n\nOnly Lewis J. Stadlen as Groucho was singled out for unanimous praise.\n\nAs far as a show becoming an instant hit or flop, the only review that really mattered was Clive Barnes in the NY Times. Sure enough he hated the show more than any other critic and brutally savaged it; \"The idea of a musical on the Marx brothers before they really became the Marx brothers is splendid. What ever happened to it?\" He went on to site every imaginable reason for it's awfulness, including the low blow that the score by Grossman & Hackady was \"Gross and Hack\" and perhaps that, as good as Stadlen was, he might be a one trick pony and only be able to do a good Groucho imitation (speculation is that the Barnes review is the reason why Stadlen was not even nominated for a Tony award, such was the power of the Times. Stadlen would indeed go on to enjoy a long, celebrated career in musical comedies and be nominated for 3 Tonys), Barnes finally adding: \"You would be better at home watching the old movies\".\n\nNY Times Clive Barnes, not amused\n\nThat was the death knell. Even the esteemed elder critic and Marx brothers lover Walter Kerr's more positive review of the show in the Times Sunday edition (\"Where Minnie's Boys was smart, unbelievably bright, really, was in starting them out in birch-bark canoes , sans wigs, sans moustaches, sans tricks.... Minnie's Boys is partly patchwork, here and there conscienceless, stuck with a gags-to-riches formula. I had a perfectly good time because those four boys onstage honored the men they were not trying too hard to become...\") couldn't save it. It was now an official flop and would limp along for 80 more performances before finally closing at a huge financial loss.\n\nMinnie's Boys newspaper clippings and reviews\n\nOn a more positive note, flawed as it is, the show has been revived many times over the years, at colleges and regional theatres, including one touring 1972 production starring Kaye Ballard as Minnie, and another with Martha Raye and... the Hudson brothers (?!) which closed before it's announced opening. The show continues to find new audiences who enjoy the opportunity of seeing the Marx brothers once again come to life on stage.\n\nGroucho, Shelley Winters, Lewis J.

Stadlen recreating a Marx brothers vaudeville sketch, mincing as a young Groucho\n\nArny Freeman as Sam (Frenchie) Marx and Shelley Winters as Minnie\n\nOn opening night, with Zeppo and Gummo Marx also in attendance, Groucho took to the stage at the curtain call to a thunderous ovation, privately said to Shelley Winters: \"I never thought when I saw you at SAKS buying a sweater for your big knockers that someday you'd wind up playing my mother\", thanked the cast and his brothers, and proceeded to do \"the walk\" with Lewis J.

Perhaps the negative reviews for the show and score gave RCA second thoughts and the album was finally released by an obscure label called \"Project 3\". The score is really pretty good, the overture is especially exciting (which I remembered it being), and some of the songs are bouncy and first rate, one \"Mama a Rainbow\" (song by Adolph/Harpo in the show to his mother) was later recorded by both Jim Nabors and Steve Lawrence:\n\nSteve Lawrence/Mama a Rainbow\n\nThe song that came closest to capturing the spirit of the Marx's and Groucho though was \"You Remind Me of You\", sung by Lewis J. Stadlen to the Margaret Dumont-like character in the show:\n\n\"You remind me of you, cold sober or blind, up front or behind, you'll always remind... me of you\"\n\nI believe the main problem Larry Grossman and Hal Hackady faced was trying to erase the memory of so many brilliant and funny songs written by some of the top song writers of the day specifically for the Marx brothers and Groucho, among them \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\", \"Hello, I Must Be Going\", \"I'm Against It\", \"Ev'ryone Says \"I Love You\", \"Lydia the Tattooed Lady\", etc, etc., (none of which were used in Minnie's Boys) a nearly impossible task.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/MINNIES-BOYS-ORIGINAL-CAST-VINYL/dp/B0014HMTV6\n\nCast album back cover\n\nMarvin Hamlish wrote the incidental music and dance arrangements for Minnie's Boys and two years later he'd accompany Groucho on piano at Carnegie Hall for \"An Evening With Groucho\"\n\n1n 1979, Lewis J. Stadlen would revive his Groucho impersonation for a one man (and one woman on piano) touring show\n\nMany varying accounts has been written about the making of Minnie's Boys (the making of the show could be a book or film in itself), yet the books: \"Groucho, the Life & Times of Julius Henry Marx\" by Stefan Kanfer and \"The Groucho Phile\" by Groucho Marx provided me with much valuable information.\n\nThanks To Scott Alexander\n\n↧\n\nA Visit to MAD Magazine\n\nMAD publisher William M. Gaines\n\nIn 1974, when I was 15, I was fortunate to spend the afternoon visiting the MAD Magazine offices on MADison Ave. Along with my 2 brothers and our 2 older cousins (whose large vintage MAD collection we would devour on every visit), I was a longtime (almost obsessive) MAD fanatic/collector, and fantasized about someday joining the ranks of \"The Usual Gang of Idiots\" as one of their contributing artists. I had also amassed a large collection of EC comics.\n\nMy dad, who shared some mutual friends with MAD (and EC) publisher William M. Gaines, pulled a few strings and arranged for my visit. I had witnessed Gaines at various NY comic book conventions and at some evening functions at my high school Baldwin (His son Chris was also a student there and a friend) but this would be my first actual encounter with the legendary publisher.\n\nI somehow got the day off from school and was pretty nervous when I arrived at the MAD offices at 485 Madison on 52nd St, but was welcomed by a friendly receptionist who ushered me right into Bill Gaines office. Gaines, 52 at the time, was a bearded man with long, gray hippie-like hair, (legend has it that Gaines, who sported a crew cut up until the late sixties, woke up one morning and decided he no longer wanted to shave or have his hair cut. The rest is history) hugely fat with loose- fitting, sloppy clothing-- quite the sight and intimidating (to me) at first, but he instantly put me at ease by enthusiastically shaking my hand and enquiring about MY artistic goals.\n\nI had brought some samples of my drawings to show and he politely thumbed through them and told me he thought I had some talent. He also mentioned how much he enjoyed my father's books and plays. I also noticed that he had a strangely muffled and garbled voice, but also had a loud, infectious laugh. He was instantly likable, like a favorite eccentric fat-hippy-uncle.\n\nBill Gaines receiving a Japanese bath, art by Jack Davis\n\nBill Gaines office was a cluttered, messy mini-museum, filled with Zeppelin artifacts (he was obsessed with dirigibles, King Kong and the Statue of Liberty), A human skull (which he told me belonged to his father) stacks of MAD's and EC comics book collections and comic fan magazines (Squa Tront, etc). Instead of a view of the New York skyline, the lone window had a giant King Kong head peering in...\n\nGaines office window\n\nAmongst the debris and wall decor there was of course a lot of MAD and EC items, including 3 large framed color paintings above his desk depicting the three EC horror mascots, the Vault Keeper, the Crypt Keeper and the Old Witch, all of which I studied up close. I was in heaven...\n\nthe Vault Keeper by Johnny Craig\n\nthe Crypt Keeper by Jack Davis\n\nthe Old Witch by Graham Ingels\n\nBill Gaines at his desk\n\nGaines was clearly a busy man that day, at least a little too busy to spend a lot of time amusing an awkward long haired 15 year old, so he attempted to go about his regular business on the phone, also going over artwork and scripts, but instructed me to make myself at home at MAD and feel free to wander around the offices and say hello to everyone, but to make sure to come by his office to say goodbye before I left.\n\nAlfred E. Neuman morphing into Bill Gaines by Jack Rickard\n\nMeet the Staff of MAD on record:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zMMYWFY2BA\n\nI had my hopes high that I'd get to meet some of the MAD artists on my visit, especially some of my heros including Mort Drucker, Don Martin, Sergio Aragones and Al Jaffee, all cartooning Gods to me. Based on so many of the contributing artists and writers posing in MAD's parody ads over the years, my assumption had always been that the \"the Usual Gang of Idiots\" basically hung out all the time at the MAD offices, it being their \"official clubhouse\", an ongoing cartoonist party, not taking into account that the artists actually created their artwork at home.\n\nA back cover parody ad featuring the MAD staff (the young blonde actress on the lower left was the late Annie Rachel who co-starred with Tony Perkins in my father's play \"Steambath\" in 1970)\n\nThe fact was that many of the artists and writers would actually travel in to deliver their finished work in person because MAD (uniquely) paid contributers instantly (I'd come to learn this later). Also Bill Gaines famously supported camaraderie among his MAD contributers which included inviting them all on an exotic overseas vacation every year.\n\nDeparting Bill Gaines office, the next office door along the hallway belonged to MAD editor Al Feldstein...\n\nMAD editor Albert B. Feldstein\n\nAl Feldstein was a comics legend to me, an early EC comics artist whose early fifties, stiff, retro style of comic art I loved, and also the editor/writer (along with Gaines) of the EC horror, science fiction and crime comics, and MAD's editor since it's founding editor and writer Harvey Kurtzman had famously left (after editing the first 26 issues) following a dispute with Gaines. It was the Feldstein edited MAD magazine of the sixties which were my monthly bibles.\n\nAl Feldstein art from \"Tales From the Crypt\" #26\n\nI was excited to finally have the chance to meet Al Feldstein... or so I thought. His office door was open slightly so I stuck my head in and said \"Um... hi Mr. Feldstein, I'm here visiting the MAD offices for the day and Mr. Gaines told me to introduce myself to everyone...\". He (unsmilingly) looked up at me for a split second and then went right back to his paperwork, clearly having zero interest in anything to do with me. I waited a few seconds for him to say something... anything, but nothing came, so I slowly backed out.\n\n\"Oh well\" I thought, onward...\n\nMAD's hallways\n\nAssociate editor Nick Meglin\n\nThe next office I stuck my head into (this time with some slight hesitation) belonged to MAD associate editor Nick Meglin. My visit with Meglin was brief, he was also clearly busy (and on the phone), but, not knowing anything about me, couldn't have been friendlier and more charming, even taking the time to look at my drawing samples and suggesting that I think about going to art college after high school. Nick's book \"The Art of Humorous Illustration\" was essential reading for me at the time so I took his words to heart, and would (ironically) enroll at the School of Visual Arts three years later where Nick taught a night class, and he became one of my favorite (and funniest) drawing instructors.\n\nArt production head Leonard (\"The Beard\") Brenner\n\nI then wandered into the art department and instantly recognized the portly art production head Leonard Brenner from all the appearances he'd made in MAD ad parodies over the years. Brenner (known affectionally as \"the beard\" for obvious reasons)...\n\nLenny Brenner, \"The Beard\"\n\nwas in the middle of laying out some pages, but took the time to engage me while he was working and explain to me what he was doing. Also wandering around in the art dept was associate editor Jerry De Fuccio, who's handsome face I also recognized from many MAD ad parodies.\n\nDe Fuccio would also converse with me a bit and it soon became clear to me that he had been briefed by Bill Gaines about my visit. He went on and on about how much he admired my dad's writing.\n\nArt director John Putnam\n\nJohn Putnam, the art director (whose face I also knew well from the pages of MAD) with his disheveled white hair had the appearance of an absent minded college professor (he actually reminded me of a combination of Wally Cox and professor Irwin Corey). Putnam was intrigued when he learned I wanted to someday work for MAD and took some time to rummage through my drawings. Rather than simply appeasing a 15 year old wannabe cartoonist, he was blunt, strongly suggesting that I needed to \"slow down\", stop incessantly drawing \"funny faces\", and especially concentrate on anatomy by taking some figure drawing classes, again advice I would faithfully follow through on.\n\nthe gregarious Sergio Aragones\n\nThen, suddenly, into the art dept walked none other then the one and only... Sergio Argaones, MAD's king of \"Marginals\" and possibly the nicest cartoonist I've ever encountered, then or ever. I was thrilled to be in his presence. Sergio greeted me like I was a star and carefully studied (and even laughed) at my stack of drawings, and would also offer me sage advice on how to someday become a MAD artist (\"Work hard... Draw funny!\"), and couldn't have been more encouraging to this kid he didn't even know. He even sat down and drew this cartoon for me on handy MAD stationary , managing to squeeze in an Alfred E. Neuman, a reference to \"PLOP! (a humor comic he was contributing to at the time), and the 3 horror mascots he was then currently drawing for \"House of Mystery\" comics...\n\ncartoon by Sergio Aragones\n\nReceiving this drawing from Sergio was the highlight of my visit. My hope at the time was just to be able to encounter one of \"the idiots\" and I certainly wasn't disappointed. I returned to Bill Gaines office and thanked him for his staff's hospitality and told him what a fun and rewarding visit it was for me and then he presented me with this (cheap, crummy and now creased & banged up) Souvenir poster and sent me on my way.\n\nMy personal cheap, crummy souvenir (click to enlarge)\n\nPostscript: 18 years later, in 1992, I'd receive a call from MAD editor John Ficarra inviting me to illustrate a (test) page for them. After graduating from SVA, I hadn't attempted to become a MAD contributer after all, instead setting my sights on National Lampoon, Heavy Metal and more \"underground\" type publications such as RAW and R. Crumb's WEIRDO, before turning to more mainstream publications. But when the call came in from Ficcara, I thought \"Sure, why not\". I suppose I passed the test because I've gone on to create hundreds of pages of art for MAD, joining the ranks of the \"Usual Gang of Idiots\", a childhood dream fulfilled.\n\nAmong my many contributions to MAD was this parody of the then popular Joan Osborne song \"What If God Was One Of Us?\". The MAD editors decided that the perfect stand-in for GOD would be... William M. Gaines himself, who had just died several months earlier.\n\nA perfect choice I thought. Again I was in heaven...\n\nMORON MAD:\n\nRead all about THE MAD SHOW:\n\nhttp://drewfriedman.blogspot.com/2011/05/mad-show_04.html\n\nRead all about Alfred E.

It was published in book form in 1971 by Dutton. Many of the caricatures created for Hollywood Panorama were also reprinted in B&W in the book \"The MGM years\", also from 1971. His book \"Enchanted Faces\" appeared in 1991-- realistic portraits of film actresses between the two World Wars. Dubbed by some the \"Artist of the Stars\", his column \"Movie Memories\" appeared for 5 years in several newspapers.\n\nBob Harman\n\nWhen I was young I was an admirer of Harman's work and it always reminded me of another of my favorites, Al Kilgore. Like Kilgore, he was also obsessed with and had an appreciation for old Hollywood movies. His charming, whimsical style of caricature was clearly influenced by Al Hirschfeld (whose wasn't?) and especially the great MGM movie poster artist Jacques Kapralik.\n\nI wanted to share some of his work, especially for anyone who might be unfamiliar with it, and mainly several samples of his \"Hollywood Panorama\" pages which was/is pretty impressive to behold, especially seen as a whole. Dedicating ten years to creating it, It was truly a labor of love for Bob Harman. I for one would love to see the book back in print.\n\nThe 9 x12 oblong cover to Bob Harman's Hollywood Panorama.

Howard himself hired me on several occasions to draw him for his old WOR TV show... (including an illustration of Howard diapering a geriatric Henny Youngman... sadly, I have no record of the drawing). I also illustrated his two bestselling books, Private Parts & Miss America, and created the character designs for an animated TV show about his teenage years that was in development several years ago which unfortunately never came to pass (See below).\n\nHoward and I seem to have a mutual appreciation for one another's work, as he's enthusiastically discussed my art many times over the years on the air, beginning in 1991 by praising my and my brother Josh's book \"Warts & All\", and has also sited me numerous times as his \"favorite artist\".

Some character designs and animation was prepared for Howard to view but he was completely unhappy with it, so he called me and asked if I could do several character sketches, (he also told me he considered asking Robert Crumb as well, whose work he also admires), mainly of himself, his parents and his older sister Ellen.

It's a dark and cynical fictional account of a famous yet troubled, (self-destructive, womanizing, alcoholic), silent screen comedian named Billy Bright. Bright was loosely based on Buster Keaton, with parallels to Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel (Van Dyke's friend and idol), Harry Langdon, and Lloyd Hamilton, and possibly channeling some other \"difficult\" comedians both Carl Reiner & Dick Van Dyke might have at one time or another encountered.\n\nTrailers from Hellon \"The Comic\"\n\nThe film premiered in 1969 to little notice and several mixed to negative reviews. It soon wound up playing on a second bill with \"The Desperado's\", starring Vince Edwards and Jack Palance (which is when, at age 10, I first saw and loved The Comic. In fact, I returned to see it another five times that week. And... The Desperado's wasn't bad!) but over the years it's become a cult favorite. It's flawed for sure, much of the tone and dialog between Van Dyke and his co-star Michelle Lee sounds like re-scripted Rob and Laura Pertie banter (Michelle Lee's character is even named \"Mary\" and she even looks like Mary Tyler Moore. I've wondered if the part was first offered to MTM?) The reviewer in the New York Times wrote that Dick Van Dyke and Michelle Lee seemed like Rob & Laura Petrie gone sour.\n\nDick Van Dyke & Michelle Lee\n\nAnother of the film's drawbacks (and a pet peeve of mine) is that the actors appear in what is supposed to be the twenties, yet they sport late sixties hair styles and sideburns. (I have a \"sideburn theory\": By the late sixties, in an effort to remain \"hip & with-it\", every single adult male actor in Hollywood had sideburns. Directors simply didn't have the heart or the nerve to ask them to suddenly shave them off, even for a 20's period film).\n\nBilly Bright tests a Chaplin mustache\n\nBilly Bright's erratic, self destructive behavior is never fully explained, and the film's color can be overlit, harsh and garish. Aside from the costumes and automobiles, you never really get a sense of the film taking place back in the twenties (unlike say, \"The Artist\" which successfully takes you back to that same Hollywood period). Also, the lead actors in their aged makeup, especially Cornel Wilde and Michelle Lee are unconvincing (their hair is basically whitened). Only Mickey Rooney and Dick Van Dyke in his final, post- heart attack scenes seem truly old.\n\nThe film's writer & director Carl Reiner also appeared\n\nin The Comic playing Billy Bright's nasty agent Al Schilling\n\nYet in spite of those drawbacks, the film is a minor classic. The Comic was Carl Reiner's second film as director after \"Enter Laughing\", two years before, which was based on his play. Without the restrictions of network TV, he was clearly looking for darker, edgier material, and The Comic fit that bill. In fact his next film (in his original trilogy) \"Where's Poppa?\" with George Segal and Ruth Gordon would be his darkest and funniest comedy yet.\n\nThe Comic has more than a few truly memorable and even haunting sequences. The opening credits feature nothing but blaring music and a vintage Billy Bright tin toy, wound up yet constantly tumbling over, an analogy to Bright's troubled life. Dick Van Dyke and Carl Reiner lovingly recreated many inspired and truly funny vintage silent screen comedy scenes (in B&W) including this one...\n\n\"Dr. Jerk and Mister Hyde\"\n\nAnd there's a very funny sequence with an aged Billy Bright attempting a comeback (ala Buster Keaton) on the late sixties Steve Allen show surrounded by several clueless guests, screening an hilarious Billy Bright TV commercial for \"Whitey White\" laundry detergent (with a cameo by Isabel Sanford).\n\nTCM on The Comic: http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/353393%7C0/The-Comic.html\n\nThere is also a beautifully played and subtle performance by the legendary Mickey Rooney as Billy Bright's long suffering movie comedy co-star and (for some unexplained reason) only loyal friend \"Cockeye\". Then there's Dick Van Dyke himself, Oscar worthy as Billy Bright, particularly in the sad final scenes, slowly roaming down Hollywood Blvd with Cockeye, eyes covered in a game of attempting to identify the Hollywood walk of fame stars. Finally, Billy Bright alone, bald, unloved and forgotten sitting in his tiny Hollywood apartment, mouth agape, blankly staring at one of his old movies (\"Forget Me Nots\") on the late show while eating and dribbling a soft boiled egg down his chin, wondering what went wrong. Harrowing and still funny stuff. Despite it's flaws, The Comic is Carl Reiner's finest and finally most poignant film.\n\nMickey Rooney as Cockeye presents Billy Bright\n\n(recovering from a stroke) with a Billy Bright tin toy\n\nSeveral film clips from The Comic:\n\nhttp://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/360670/Comic-The-Movie-Clip-Love-Honor-And-Oh-Boy-.html\n\nDick Van Dyke was in his mid-forties when he made The Comic and he looks a bit old as the young and eager Billy Bright, arriving in Hollywood after his success as a Vaudeville comedian, but his sad, drawn face works perfectly in the later scenes of Billy Bright in decline. Van Dyke, who also struggled with alcohol problems, was the perfect choice for Billy Bright. He had appeared in several turkeys leading up to The Comic (\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" was his only late-sixties hit), and sadly, The Comic would also flop at the box office. He'd star in just one more film (the very funny Cold Turkey) before returning to television. Yet in this film he achieved something he had never actually pulled off before. Always likable, in The Comic, he made himself almost completely unlikable. He's simply note-perfect in this tailor made role and It's by far my favorite performance of his. Take a look (although for some reason it's still not on DVD yet! #$%?@#!) TCM screens it from time to time.\n\nThe original one-sheet poster for The Comic.

The psychologically suspenseful narrative, written by Al Feldstein but expanded and graphically designed by Krigstein, took place in a New York Subway station with flashbacks to the nazi Germany death camps and was the first mainstream comic story to deal directly with the still painful memory of the (then) decade old Holocaust.\n\nBernard Krigstein would illustrate 47 stories for EC, including several pieces for MAD working with it's brilliant editor Harvey Kurtzman, before becoming a full time painter and teacher, and what he created was innovative and startling, especially in the 1950's world of comic books.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Krigstein\n\nMaster Race opening page\n\nClosing page\n\nFrom MAD # 12, opening page\n\nClosing page.

I've been fortunate in receiving several personalized drawings from some of the legendary cartoonists (the \"Usual gang of Idiots\") who've worked for MAD over the years, including the above drawing by the great Harvey Kurtzman, the creator of MAD. This drawing is from 1980 (where I was most likely the main instigator in the weekly chaos that ensued during his class at the School of Visual Arts. Harvey privately thanked me on several occasions for keeping the class \"lively') and was used in the class publication Kar-Tunz, before Harvey's personal inscription was added.\n\nRead all about my memories of Harvey Kurtzman and his SVA class here:\n\nJack Davis sent me this inscribed drawing recently as a thank you for interviewing him last year at the Brooklyn Comics festival and for writing a tribute to him for the recent anthology of his work from Fantagraphics:\n\nSergio Aragonas drew this for me during my 1974 visit to the MAD offices.

Mark Newgarden was the editor and art director for the 1991 series, and the writers for the card fronts included Newgarden, Jay Lynch, Jordan Bochanis, John Mariano and myself. I drew about 22 tight pencil images which would (with one exception) be painted by the illustrator Patrick Piggott.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the cards I created (mostly parodying popular magazine covers of the day) were ultimately not used, the \"Lost Wacky's\". The problem was that Topps gave the go-ahead to proceed into a second series before the first series had even been marketed. When the numbers were finally crunched, it was decided that the team should move along with other satirical projects. Most of these pencil drawings have never been seen till now, aside from several turning up on a Wacky Packs site but incorrectly attributed to other artists.\n\npainting by Pat Piggott: PP (unused)\n\nPopps Magazine by DF\n\nfinished card painted by PP\n\nTV Died by DF\n\npainting by PP (unused)\n\nBOB magazine by DF\n\npainting by PP (unused)\n\nThe baby Splitters Club by DF\n\nfinished card by PP\n\nSAD by DF (ironically I'd become a regular in MAD, a \"Usual Gang of Idiot\" a year later)\n\nheh heh...\n\npainting by PP (unused)\n\nBoys' Lice by DF\n\npainting by PP (unused)\n\nChin magazine by DF/not painted/unused\n\nFamine circle by DF\n\nfinished art without lettering by PP (unused)\n\nMUMMOREX by DF\n\nfinished card painted by Tom Bunk\n\nHeaventeen/not painted/unused\n\nPaul E.
