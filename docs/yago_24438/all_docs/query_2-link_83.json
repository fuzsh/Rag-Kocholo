        "text": "By: Catherine Ramirez\n\n“If you can dream it, you can do it”\n\nHave you ever read this famous quote before? Perhaps you saw it written on an inspirational poster or a meme made on the internet? Have you seen it printed on a souvenir coin or on countless shirts and plaques sold by creatives on their do-it-yourself ETSY sites? Do you, like many others, incorrectly attribute this quote to something Walt Disney said?\n\nIf so, it is not your fault. When my oldest child was in the 3rd grade, he was given a homework assignment to come up with a family motto or saying. One such example given on the worksheet he brought home was the “If you can dream it, you can do it” quote wrongly giving credit to Walter Elias Disney, the famous pioneer of animated films, audio-animatronics, co-founder of the Walt Disney Company, and creator of Disneyland, to name a few of his many accomplishments.\n\nWhen I saw my child’s homework assignment, I was livid. I knew third party companies like Hallmark and Etsy small shop designers were falsely claiming this quote as Walt’s, but now it is being taught in a school? How could this be? Even the Anaheim Police Department shares this quote in their training manuals.\n\nWhat’s the Source?\n\nDo you still believe Walt Disney spoke these words? Then what is its source?\n\nLet me ask you a few more questions. Have you ever seen this quote printed from an interview Walt did in publication, such as an article in a newspaper or magazine? NO?\n\nPerhaps you heard a recording of a radio broadcast of Walt Disney saying these words? NO?\n\nMaybe you saw Walt Disney on television during a “Wonderful World of Color” segment and heard him speak these words directly into camera? NO?\n\nWell, then, did you read this quote inside some secret diary of Walt’s? NO?\n\nPerhaps, it was on a search engine, like Google for example. You type in the following words… “Walt Disney Quotes” and up on your computer or mobile device’s screen pops countless quotes and memes. Some quotes Walt did in fact say, while many other supposed credited quotes, Walt did not.\n\nAs a Cast Member working for the Walt Disney Company for more than 20 years, and a self-proclaimed Disney history enthusiast, I knew this quote was proven to be something Walt neither said, nor wrote down in any journal he had ever kept. There are no recordings of Walt saying this quote in publication, radio, or film. Nor had any Disney family member or colleague ever recall Walt Disney saying, “If you can dream it, you can do it.”\n\nAnd yet, this quote had to come from somewhere, and why are people attributing this quote to something Walt Disney said?\n\nTo understand the origins of this quote, you will first have to learn about corporate sponsorships that helped propel the attractions and exhibits over the years at the Disney Parks.\n\nCORPORATE SPONSORSHIPS\n\nWhen Disneyland first opened in 1955, Walt and Roy Disney looked to corporate sponsors in order to ensure some of the Park’s attractions would be in operation on opening day, like Kaiser’s Hall of Aluminum Fame.\n\nYears later, though Roy was ready to retire prior to his brother’s passing on December 15, 1966, Roy Disney decided to remain on the job to tackle one of the greatest projects the Walt Disney Company had ever been tasked with to date, the creation of Walt Disney World.\n\nWhile Walt Disney was indeed the dreamer, Roy was the businessman and doer. He would be the one to find ways to obtain the money to do the ideas Walt dreamed up, like finding the funds to finish Walt Disney’s first full length animation film, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” as just one of many examples.\n\nRoy would again find a way to find the funds to honor his brother’s dream of building Walt Disney World in Florida. Five years after Walt’s death, through hard work, leadership and great creative financial prowess, Walt Disney World would open debt free in 1971. The late Disney Imagineer Marty Sklar once said, “Without Roy Disney, this (Walt Disney World) would never have happened.”\n\nWhen it came to opening Epcot in 1982, although the budget was well over $1 Billion dollars, the Walt Disney Company again turned to corporate sponsorships to fork the bill. It would be these sponsorships that would end up paying for the majority of Epcot. It was the countries, like France, and Japan who would pay for and sponsor their country’s pavilion in the World Showcase, while corporations would pay millions of dollars a year to see their brand’s name alongside the Disney name on its attractions. The corporations would in turn, have some say on what the attraction they were sponsoring ended up looking like.\n\nKODAK AND FIGMENT\n\nOne such sponsor was Kodak which sponsored the attraction ‘Journey into Imagination with Figment.’\n\nThe loveable character Figment was originally drawn with a green pigmentation in original concept sketches.\n\nConcept Drawings of Figment Credit: Walt Disney Archives\n\nGreen was a problem for Kodak, as it was the color of Fuji-Film, Kodak’s competitor. Figment was then changed from green to purple, wearing a red and yellow sweater, the color of Kodak’s logo.\n\nIn the Imagination pavilion there was the Magic Eye Theater. During its preshow, an 8 minute long presentation featuring a song called, “Making Memories,” written by the Sherman Brothers was heard while award-winning amateur’s photos were displayed on a screen.\n\nWhen I listen to the ragtime catchy song, to me it plays more like a commercial jingle for Kodak, than anything else. It starts:\n\n“Long before the old Model T\n\n‘Round about the turn of the century\n\nFolks discovered a barrel of fun\n\nTaking pictures by the light of the sun\n\nSmile, hug, look at the camera\n\nHold your breath and say cheese!\n\nLittle did they realize back then,\n\nThey were making memories.\n\nMaking memories, making memories\n\nTaking pictures is making memories\n\nCatching little pieces of time\n\nMaking them yours and making them mine...”\n\nHow can memories reappear exactly? Why, by taking a snapshot with your Kodak camera on Kodak film of course.\n\nGeneral Electric, Disney, and EPCOT\n\n“When Walt first advanced his idea of EPCOT he said WED (Walter Elias Disney – precursor to Walt Disney Imagineering), couldn’t do it alone. We’re in the entertainment business and, obviously, we felt our strength was to entertain people and communicate through our entertainment. But we had to bring in other companies, like GE, to add their expertise in developing our communication about the future. It was important to the credibility of EPCOT that we create a synergism – with Disney as the communicator, the entertainer, and companies like GE and Exxon and Kodak as the experts, the people who really are in the businesses we’re portraying. How do you start out interpreting a corporate culture? Just like there’s a Disney way to our company, there’s a GE style. Every company has its distinctive culture and legend and ways that it sees itself. Our job was to create a pavilion specifically for GE, whose theme is ‘the achievable future…” Marty Sklar, WED’s Executive VP for Creative Development at the time.\n\n“Both our cultures are always changing – tuning to different times, adopting contemporary styles without giving up valued substance. It’s the spirit that led the Disney people to propose what they did and that led us to approve it – a vision of the future firmly rooted in what we know can someday be done.” – Karl Koss General Electric’s Liaison to WED.\n\nFrom 1955 throughout the 1980’s, it was an absolute great investment for a corporation to share their brand messaging at a theme park where hundreds of millions of guests visit each year.\n\nJust like Kodak sponsored ‘Journey into Imagination with Figment’, General Electric sponsored ‘Horizons’ in Future World.\n\nHORIZONS\n\nThe Horizon’s attraction that opened in Future World at Walt Disney World’s Epcot on October 1, 1983, was an attraction that was “dedicated to humanity’s future.” It was sponsored by General Electric until September 30, 1993. After the sponsorship ran out, The Walt Disney Company would continue to operate the attraction until late 1994. The attraction closed briefly and then reopened one last time in December of 1995, until finally closing forever on January 9, 1999.\n\nWait. Perhaps I am jumping into this too fast and too deep. What does this all mean? Why am I talking about Epcot and the Horizons attraction that no longer exists? Okay, let us step back and let me introduce some folks to you who I lovingly call, The Players.\n\nPlayer #1 Dave Smith – The Disney Legend, Archivist and Historian\n\nDave Rollin Smith was the founder of the Walt Disney Archives in 1970 and worked for the company for 40 years. He received the prestigious Disney Legends Award in 2007 and retired after his 40th anniversary in 2010. As Chief Archivist Emeritus, Dave stayed on with the Walt Disney Company as a consultant for another nine years until his death in 2019.\n\nDave was first hired by Roy O. Disney in 1970, 4 years after Walt’s passing. His very first assignment was to catalogue every single item that was inside Walt’s office, which had been left untouched since his passing. During Dave’s four decades at the Walt Disney Company, it was his duty to preserve all things Disney, from film to television, theme parks, animation and so much more.\n\nBob Iger, Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board of the Walt Disney Company stated, “He was the unsung hero of Disney’s history who, as our first archivist, spent 40 years rescuing countless documents and artifacts from obscurity, investing endless hours restoring and preserving these priceless pieces of our legacy, and putting them in context to tell our story, Dave was a true Disney Legend, and we are indebted to him for building such an enduring, tangible connection to our past that continues to inspire our future.”\n\nDave was a treasure and well known amongst Disneyland Resort Cast Members. My husband Marlon, who has worked for the Walt Disney Company since the early 1990’s, recounted a memorable time when he first met Dave Smith. In 1998, Marlon was in Glendale at the Walt Disney Studios and he wanted to meet Dave. He, along with another Cast Member, approached his secretary and asked if they could meet him. His secretary gave a warm smile and invited them right into Dave‘s office. Dave stood up from his desk and gave my husband a firm handshake and a big smile. He then began to give them a tour of his office. At one point Marlon noticed an Academy Award under glass and asked Dave if that was a real award. Dave told Marlon that it indeed was real, and in fact it was the Honorary Academy Award Walt had won in 1939 for his 1937 film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Dave then took the Oscar out of its case and gave it to my husband and let him hold it. More than 20 years later, my husband still talks fondly of that first meeting with Dave, when he let him hold one of Walt Disney’s Academy Awards.\n\nI myself would run into Dave from time to time, during the construction of Disney California Adventure Park, or after he had a speaking engagement or interview held at Walt’s Apartment above the firehouse in Disneyland. On a few rare sightings, I would catch a glimpse of Dave in the early mornings before the Disneyland Park opened. I worked in the TV/Film Production Department for the Disneyland Resort and our call times were often before sunrise.\n\nOn those few occasions, I would see a man walking onto the set. I would go to investigate and see that it was none other than Dave Smith. Sometimes Dave would be alone, and sometimes he would have a newly hired historian or archivist he was showing the ropes to. Dave would always have a clipboard in his hand with a blank piece of paper. He told me that if he had a clipboard and walked with a purpose, very rarely did anyone stop to ask him any questions. He liked to visit Disneyland in the early mornings, before it was opened to the guests, he was always taking note of all the changes happening inside the Park.\n\nDave was a kind man, he always wore a smile and graciously never tired of my questions, well, perhaps he did, but he never showed me that he was tired of providing me answers about the company. One of those questions I asked him about was if it was true that Walt never said the “If you can dream it, you can do it quote.” Dave told me it was a myth.\n\nThough Dave never told me personally it was written by someone else, he simply stated at the time that Walt Disney never spoke nor wrote those specific words.\n\nIt would be many years later when I would come across the same question being asked to Dave, while reading his book Disney Facts Revealed. In the book, Dave answers questions from his readers he has received over the last 30 years. On page 252 of the book, Dave shared a question asked of him from a fan from Chicago named Todd.\n\nTodd asks, “I’ve always been under the impression that Walt Disney himself said, ‘If you can dream it, you can do it.’ But I’ve never been able to find a source. Any idea if this quote was ever actually said by Walt himself?”\n\nDave’s Smith response was, “This is a very common urban legend. It is not a Walt Disney quote, but rather was written by Imagineer Tom Fitzgerald for the Horizons attraction at Epcot.”\n\nPlayer #2 Tom Fitzgerald – The Imagineer and Script Writer\n\nEnter Player 2 into the scene…\n\nTom Fitzgerald is a Senior Creative Executive of the Walt Disney Imagineering Management for the Walt Disney Company\n\nFor the past 42 years, Tom has worked for Walt Disney Imagineering bringing such iconic attractions to Disney Parks around the world like Star Tours to Disneyland in 1987.\n\nTom was a little boy when he went to the New York World’s Fair in 1964 and saw Disney’s ‘Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln.’ Seeing the audio-animatronic Lincoln as a young boy gave Tom the inspiration to one day work for WED.\n\nAfter graduating from Northwestern University, Fitzgerald would head to California to fulfill his childhood dream. Mission accomplished! In 1979, Tom was hired in the communications department at WED and by 1981, he was tasked to help write the script for the GE pavilion at Epcot.\n\n“Tom Fitzgerald was the main story person as the Horizons project got rolling. Tom added the warmth of story to scenes I was designing and modeling in small scale.” wrote George McGinnis, the last Imagineer hired by Walt Disney.\n\nIn 1983, Fitzgerald would explain in an interview he gave for a General Electric Promotional Booklet about the Horizons attraction that, “We wanted to emphasize the family unit. Some people think that it may not exist in the future, but our feeling was that advances in transportation and communication will bring families closer together.” He would go on to include, “The GE credo ‘Better than the best,’ is a phrase that we at Disney understand well.”\n\nHorizons – The Quote Connection\n\nWhen guests first approached the Horizons attraction, instrumental music could be heard through speakers playing the “New Horizons” theme song along with GE’s familiar musical notes to their tagline “We Bring Good Things to Life.”\n\nOnce guests arrive inside, a large sign was seen displayed next to the left of the sliding glass door entrance. It reads “If we can dream it, we can do it”\n\nDid you notice how this sentence does NOT read, “If you can dream it, you can do it”?\n\nFor the first time in the Walt Disney Company history, “If we can dream it, we can do it” is displayed on an attraction wall, 17 years after Walt Disney’s death.\n\nGuests would see this sign and then begin to queue for the flight from the Future Port. Flight 83 is what they will take, 83 is significant because that is the year the Horizons attraction first began taking passengers.\n\nBefore the guests were cleared for departure an announcer’s voice could be heard saying, “GE Horizons passengers…you are now cleared for departure to the twenty-first century.”\n\nThe attraction took guests to see new towns of tomorrow, like desert farms, floating cities, and space colonies.\n\nThroughout the flight, we witness Tom Fitzgerald’s script writing in action while the audio-animatronic family members recite various dialogue Tom wrote for them, like when the Mother character says, “I suppose people have always dreamed of the future. We sure do.”\n\nTo which the father character responds, “The only difference is that today, with what we know and what we are learning to do, we really can bring our dreams to life. It takes a lot of work, but the truth is, if we can dream it, we can do it.”\n\nDid you recognize that the use of General Electric’s tag line, “We bring good things to life” has been integrated and reimagined into Tom Fitzgerald’s script? He has adapted “we bring good things to life” to “we really can bring our dreams to life.”\n\nRemember, this attraction is a corporate sponsored attraction paid for by General Electric. The corporation is spending millions of dollars a year to have their logo and messaging interwoven throughout the ride. Fitzgerald has cleverly adapted a familiar tagline that almost everyone who rode the attraction would have been very familiar with at that time.\n\nAt the end of the attraction, similar lines are once again spoken by Father\n\nFather: Well, we’re almost back from the future.\n\nMother: Oh, it went by so quickly.\n\nFather: Yes, but one of the nice things about traveling into the future is that the journey’s just beginning.\n\nMother: That’s right\n\nFather: And I’ll tell you something, if we can dream it, we really can do it and that’s the most exciting part.\n\nA GE Logo was seen and then the following announcement is heard as guests begin to approach the exit platform.\n\nAnnouncer (1983 version): All of us at General Electric thank you for exploring Horizons. Please take small children by the hand and watch your step…\n\nAnnouncer: (1984 version) All of us at GE look forward to bringing good things to life for you, today and tomorrow. Now please take small children by the hand and watch your step…\n\nDave Smith asks Tom Fitzgerald\n\nA few decades after the Horizons attraction first opened, The Walt Disney Archives shared a question from their Ask Walt Disney Archives on the D23.com website.\n\nThis time the question is from a Krystina from Arizona.\n\nKrystina: “I heard that Walt Disney did not, in fact, ever say the famous quote, “If you can dream it, you can do it.” Is that true? If so, who did say it?\n\nDave Smith responds: “He never said this quote. If you check my book, Disney Trivia from the Vault, you can find the true story:\n\n“Despite its frequent publication, that is not a Walt Disney quote. We checked with Imagineer Tom Fitzgerald for the definitive answer: ‘I am very familiar with that line because I wrote it! It was written specifically for the Horizons attraction at Epcot and used in numerous ways, from dialogue in the ride to graphics. I find it amusing that the Science of Imagineering DVD series attributes it to Walt Disney, but I guess I should be flattered.”\n\nDoes the Misinformation begin with “The Science of Imagineering” DVD Series?\n\nWhat I would like to know, and I apologize if my tone changes briefly here, but, who decided to add this quote to the intro of the DVD series? I could find one writer, two producers, and a director listed for the series along with Disney Education Productions listed on IMDB (Internet Movie Database). I attempted to search for the four names listed and could not track anyone down to ask who thought to insert this quote.\n\nI would like to ask them what source did the writer or producers use to claim Walt Disney ever said, “If you can dream it, you can do it” when the foremost expert in Walt Disney history never found any such source with the entire archives at his disposal? Could a writer simply make a mistake? Perhaps they thought a quote by Walt Disney in the introduction of the DVD would make a good setup for the preface of what was about to be taught in the video series and he simply googled “Walt Disney quotes” like so many others, relying on Google to always provide the answers? Could someone truly be that careless?\n\nHaving worked in the Broadcast Services Television department, for the Walt Disney Company, you have the great minds of Disney at your disposal to verify and confirm information. Dave Smith was alive at the time the Science of Imagineering was produced. Why was this quote not verified prior to it being sold to the public and pushed for school usage? I would like to know those answers. The Walt Disney Archives have long disputed that this quote belongs to Walt Disney. I would like to better understand this apparent failure to do due diligence. This educational series has been played at schools for many years and can still be purchased on Amazon, shopDisney, and can be seen on YouTube as well. It appears, by all intents and purposes that Tom Fitzgerald is accurate that this could quite possibly be the origin of the falsehood that Walt said, “If you can dream it, you can do it.” Way to go Science of Imagineering DVD! Now I know why my then 3rd grader came home with this false information.\n\nNOW WHAT?\n\nFirst, when I talked to Dave Smith about this quote, it must’ve been in the late 1990’s. He never mentioned Tom Fitzgerald to me at that time. But years passed and the internet usage grew more wide and false quotes were beginning to surface more than before and at an alarming rate. In 2012 or so is when I began to first hear that Tom Fitzgerald originated the quote. As soon as I read about Dave’s source being Tom Fitzgerald and Dave, being a Disney Legend with unparalleled knowledge of all things Disney, how could I question that it could be anyone but Tom Fitzgerald? Dave had already long proven the quote to not be that of Walt’s. Dave was the founder of the Walt Disney Archives, remember? Chief Archivist Emeritus? The only person to enter Walt Disney’s office 4 years after he passed away to carefully chronicle Walt’s entire office space, piece of paper, record, everything. It was the information he received from Tom Fitzgerald, claiming the quote as his own, that finally had some weight to it, Tom is a credible source. It made sense. Tom Fitzgerald is the source of the quote. Right?\n\nMY QUEST TO SHARE THE TRUTH\n\nBy 2014, I had left Disney due to a progressive illness after 22 years of service with the company and was missing my home away from home. Starting at the age of 17 in 1992, Disneyland is where I met my husband. It was a magical place of friends and family that I was missing so terribly.\n\nBy 2019, I discovered Instagram, very much late to the social media game, it was not until last year that I finally joined Facebook, though that may have been a bad decision, but I digress.\n\nBut on Instagram I had found a wonderful world of people who liked Disney. At first, I was intrigued by how much these people liked Disney, like…WOW! These people really LOVE Disney. I mean REALLY LOVE Disney! Then I thought…hmm, maybe this is not for me. I had only viewed Disney from the perspective of a Cast Member and I didn’t relate to their perspective on Disney. But then I began noticing folks posting information that was blatantly inaccurate, unresearched, not verifiable. That is what rejuvenated me, though no longer a Disney Cast Member, I could at least attempt to share accurate information and set the record straight. I began to post historical content, information told to me firsthand by the Imagineers and historians that I worked with.\n\nWhile scrolling through some posts on Instagram, I pause. I see it. THE QUOTE. “If You can dream it, you can do it” credited to Walt Disney!\n\nSeeing this posted as a picture on someone’s feed, then another and then another. NO! Don’t they know?!? If they are truly Disney loving diehards, why are they sharing incorrect information?\n\nI took it upon myself to share the story, share Dave Smith’s legacy and the perceived fact that Tom Fitzgerald came up with the quote, “If you can dream it, you can do it.” I shared this quarterly on my Instagram page. Reminding people that Walt Disney never said this quote. It was my mission that I took on full force. I am a stay-at-home disabled mom; it was my ONE thing! THE ONE mission I gave myself.\n\nTHE PANDEMIC AND THE SPARK\n\nIt is now almost a year into the worldwide pandemic. While staying safe at home, I began to organize my Disney treasures I have collected over the years. I have a signed concept drawing lithograph of Jessica Rabbit by Imagineer and Disney artist Marcelo Vignali. I was curious of its value and if anyone else had one. It was a Cast Member exclusive when Mickey’s Toontown first opened in 1993. So, I hopped onto a site called Worthpoint, to see if my art piece had value. Though nothing resembling my piece could be found, I did notice a Walt Disney World Epcot GE Horizons 1983 puzzle with the GE Logo and the words If We Can Dream It We Can Do It tag line on the side of the box.\n\nMy AHA moment! A spark went off. GE. Horizons is sponsored by General Electric. IF WE CAN DREAM IT WE CAN DO IT. No lower case lettering. Wait. Read the script! READ THE SCRIPT!\n\nI then began to devour the Horizons script, word for word. There are only two places in the script where Fitzgerald writes these words for “Father” to say, in the beginning of the attraction and at the end. By all accounts, “If We can dream it, we can do it,” is not the same as, “If you can dream it, you can do it.” Different pronouns were used. “We” inspires the collaborative aspect in a society, much like the hope of future in the Horizons attraction. While “You” is to inspire one person. Do YOU have what it takes? What can YOU dream up? If YOU can dream it, YOU can do it.\n\nThough Tom took credit for the famous quote, “If you can dream it, you can do it” for Horizons, he was clearly referring to the line he adapted it to be, “If we can dream it, we can do it” as nowhere in the attraction is there signage or words heard spoken, “If you can dream it, you can do it.”\n\nThis made me think, since Tom adapted General Electric’s, “We bring good things to life.” To “We really can bring our dreams to life” for Horizons, is it just as possible that Tom saw “If you can dream it, you can do it” within the chronicles and journals of GE for inspiration? I went on a hunt to find the source.\n\nTHE PODCAST – RetroWDW\n\nFirst stop, a podcast. I never listen to podcasts. Not because I do not like them, I just do not feel I have the time. But this one caused me to stop. The Podcast is called RetroWDW and is a podcast of the Lake Buena Vista Historical Society. “Ok,” I thought, “it’s a historical society, I can listen to this.”\n\nWhile listening to the broadcast, four hosts, Todd McCartney, How Bowers, JT Kuzior and Brian Miles interview a woman by the name of Sheralyn Silverstein. A woman claiming to have written, “If you can dream it, you can do it” for General Electric in early 1981.\n\nAfter hearing Sheralyn’s interview on RetroWDW, it all made sense. She was the missing link. She was the AHA moment I was waiting for. But I needed to talk to her myself. I needed to know the who, what, where, when and why’s. I needed definitive answers.\n\nPlayer #1: Dave Smith had already long proven that Walt Disney NEVER said, “If you can dream it, you can do it.”\n\nPlayer #2: Tom Fitzgerald clearly wrote. “If we can dream it, we can do it” for the Horizons attraction at Epcot, SPONSORED by General Electric.\n\nWhat then was Sheralyn Silverstein’s part? How does she fit into this tale?\n\nPLAYER #3 SHERALYN SILVERSTEIN – THE COPYWRITER\n\nEnter Player 3 into the scene.\n\nI reached out to Sheralyn Silverstein via email at the end of January this year seeking an interview. My email was simple, but straight to the point, was she THE Sheralyn Silverstein that had claimed to have written that all too famous quote.\n\nShe responded, “Yes, you are contacting the right person. I’m Sheralyn Silverstein, and I did indeed write, “If you can dream it, you can do it.”\n\nI was so very joyful when Sheralyn agreed to be interviewed via that device we all have become familiar with this past year, Zoom.\n\nThe following are excerpts from this interview:\n\nAfter I received permission to record our audio conversation, we got right into her story.\n\nI asked Sheralyn how she felt about her quote being passed around as Walt Disney’s quote.\n\nS: Over time I was getting increasingly annoyed that Walt Disney was getting credit for this. What you write is coin of the realm. Your work is all you have to show for who you are and what you’ve done. How does he (Walt Disney) get credit? He had everything, but he didn’t have that. That was mine.\n\nC: When did you write this quote?\n\nS: Going back to the beginning of things, I got a job as a young writer with a company called Marsteller New York (subsidiary of Young and Rubicam, Y&R). At that time, I was the only female on the creative staff. It was rough and tough. It was competitive and a very hard environment, but it was also a great place to learn.\n\nAt that point in time, I was the youngest and lowest on the pay scale. I would often get the jobs that nobody else wanted to do. I would do the little ads for little publications. At one point I had to write an ad for a bank for Playbill Magazine and nobody wants that assignment, but I believed if I make something out of even the smallest thing, it is going to build my reputation and portfolio.\n\nSheralyn continued to tell me that the ad she wrote for Playbill Magazine won her an award in the ad business, and soon, people began to take notice of her. She began to earn more assignments and then the president of Marsteller New York, Lou Magnani, took notice of her too and saw to it that she would get the better assignments.\n\nS: In 1981 General Electric (GE) was a big company and the ad agency they worked with was BBD&O in New York (Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn originally founded in New York City in 1891). BBD&O is one of the best ad agencies and their tagline for GE was “We bring good things to life.” But General Electric was looking for another ad agency that would do some of the smaller types of ad work.\n\nAt any rate, GE asked us to pitch them with an idea about their recruitment division and ideas for other things. Of course, the bigger guns of the agency, the ‘big boys’ wanted to work on television for GE.\n\nWhile the ‘big boys’ were working on their television pitches, Sheralyn was assigned to work with a man by the name of Bob Green. Green was her senior, with many awards under his belt, who was annoyed by the assignment because he was paired to work on the recruitment pitch ideas with her, a Junior Copywriter.\n\nS: Bob and I worked on the recruitment and what I decided to do was I said, ‘Why don’t we use quotes for teachers and professors, and I’ll make them up.’\n\nOne of Sheralyn’s ideas was a picture of a kid with a teacher. The quote Sheralyn wrote for the teacher to say to her student was, “If you can dream it, you can do it.”\n\nSheralyn recalled Magnani telling her that he did not know if he liked it and thought her tag line was too ‘pie in the sky.’ She further reminisced that Bob, who did not want to work with her in the first place, seemed to express that it was the only good pitch she had come up with for the entire campaign. Sheralyn stuck to her guns and told Magnani that she liked her idea and that she believed in it.\n\nTHE PITCH\n\nSheralyn was too junior to be able to attend the meeting with GE. The Senior Copywriters at Marsteller New York would be making the pitch to GE with the new Charmain and CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch, in attendance. The Marsteller team had all the work lined up on a wall, TV ads, along with other smaller ad ideas including Sheralyn’s “If you can dream it, you can do it” were all in a line on the wall awaiting the pitch.\n\nAfter the meeting, Lou Magnani, came straight over to Sheralyn’s tiny little office space and told her that they could not have asked for a better meeting. He informed Sheralyn that Jack Welch came straight over to the wall and pointed to Sheralyn’s, “If you can dream it, you can do it” quote and he said, “That’s the reason I’m going to sign your agency!”\n\nS: It was like winning the lottery. This is something you dream about as a kid. I also got a bonus and a raise. It doesn’t happen like that very often.\n\nSheralyn went on to explain that GE was not going to be giving up their tag line, “We bring good things to life” because it was a brand line. What was happening was GE wanted to buy her line and keep it for recruitment advertising.\n\nIt was during this time that Sheralyn begins to show me the brochures and pamphlets she had kept from the original recruitment pieces she did for GE. Starting with this large brochure printed by General Electric in 1982, which includes GE’s brand messaging on the left, with the quote Sheralyn wrote, “If you can dream it, you can do it” on the right.\n\nPhoto Credit: Sheralyn Silverstein\n\nThe Proof Continues\n\nHEIGH HO HEIGH HO OFF TO GE SHE GOES\n\nS: They sent me off to Schenectady to their Research and Development facility. I got to meet some great scientists and a Nobel prize winner. GE was interested in attracting the top talent; the life blood of the company is its research.\n\nAfter meeting the great minds of General Electric’s R&D division, Sheralyn was set to write the words, while Marilyn Lowther, a talented art designer would design the brochure’s artwork. Several months after the brochures for the recruitment had been published, the president of the company, Magnani, called Sherlayn into his office to share some exciting news.\n\nS: He said they are going to use it (If you can dream it, you can do it). For their tag line (for Horizons) at Epcot. And that’s what they did.\n\nThat is most certainly what Disney did. Somewhere, somehow, someone saw a tag line that was seen in GE documentation, a line Jack Welch bought from the Marsteller New York ad agency that Sheralyn Silverstein wrote in 1981. The line was taken, and it was reworked. Sheralyn’s tag line for GE, “If you can dream it, you can do it” was beautifully rebirthed by Tom Fitzgerald to fit the communal futuristic landscape of the General Electric sponsored Horizons attraction with his reimagined line, “If we can dream it, we can do it” that was completed at Epcot in 1983.\n\nWALT DISNEY DID NOT SAY IT\n\nC: When did you first notice or become aware of your quote, “If you can dream it, you can do it” was attributed to Walt Disney? Did you just go online one day, or did someone bring it to your attention?\n\nS: I think partly because with Google coming along, there was so many things you could find out that you might have been curious about years ago, and when I started to put together my portfolio, I always keep my portfolio updated, I started to think about this, and the one reason why I kept it (Sheralyn is holding up an original pristine condition 1982 GE folder with the GE logo and her tag line, “If you can dream it you can do it” written inside) was because of that line, because it was going to get me jobs, and it did. It helped me. I wanted to protect what’s mine and I kept it along with other pieces of the campaign. So, I thought one day why I hadn’t ever put this quote on my resume.\n\nAnd so Sheralyn began to look online to see if her quote was out in this new internet world. It was a great quote, one that won her a promotion and several high-profile accounts. I am sure Sheralyn was excited as she began to search for her quote, and then…she sees it. She sees her quote. But wait, it is not attributed to her as the author.\n\nSheralyn recounts her first memory seeing her quote attributed to Walt Disney:\n\nS: I had found out (online) Walt Disney had said it. Wait. Wait. WAIT! No. He did not. HE DID NOT! That is not true. GE had it. If GE were going to use it, Disney would have said wait a minute. GE loved it. EVERYONE loved it. Then I kept looking into it and looking into it then I said no! No! NO! Then I dug this out (Sheralyn holds up her folder for me to see). Fortunately, I’m not a hoarder but I am a pack rat. I have portfolios from my entire career, things have changed, they’re all digital now, but I have the big black portfolios. I dug it out and I said, ‘There it is.’\n\nIt’s funny because you remember, always when you’re an author of things, where you were when you did it. I remember being in my house and freaking out. I was so worried I wasn’t going to be able to do it. It was very intimidating to work with Bob. He would tell me now, “What are you kidding?” But he was very good and he came from a very disciplined background and he wanted a good variety, I always had a lot of anxiety about that and self-doubt. But I remember this.\n\nC: Do you think you would ever contact the Walt Disney Company about this?\n\nS: No, but if they want to talk to me about it, I’m open. I’d be glad to talk to Walt Disney the man if he were still alive. I’d say, we both know. And as for the Imagineer (Tom Fitzgerald), I respectfully say he is incorrect.\n\nIt’s like I said, when you write something, and you’re a writer, if you see someone else taking credit for it. You think, that is something you would never do. It’s the only thing you have to get other jobs, to get recognition, you have to be vigilant about your work and protect it. And when people say you shouldn’t blow your own horn, yes you should, yes you should. (laughter) I’ve been in plenty of rooms with people blowing their own horns.\n\n“If we can dream it, we can do it” – Tom Fitzgerald\n\nMost diehard Disney history aficionados know that Walt Disney the man never said, “If you can dream it, you can do it,” that has long been a proven myth by Dave Smith and the whole of the Walt Disney Archives. The origin has become clear, to me, that Sheralyn Silverstein is the first to write these specific words for a campaign piece for General Electric in 1981. But why would Tom claim the quote as his own after the Science in Imagineering DVD series started to misquote this line?\n\nTom never wrote “If you can dream it, you can do it” for Horizons. He wrote “If we can dream it, we can do it.” An obvious reimaginated line, brilliantly written to not only bring together GE’s brand, the ride’s corporate sponsor, but also the futuristic possibilities the message of the attraction was telling. We, the people of the world can do it if we, together can just dream it.\n\nI reached out to Tom Fitzgerald requesting an interview and was informed by the WDI Communication team that, “Unfortunately, we are unable to offer an interview or email Q&A with Tom at this time. We appreciate the opportunity though!”\n\nThank you anyway WDI Communication team. I am hopeful I will be able to interview Tom Fitzgerald in the future, I am a huge fan of his and I will make myself available for whenever Tom is ready, I’ll be ready too!\n\nMy best conjecture as to why Tom claimed the If YOU can dream it… is that for the last 42 years of working in Walt Disney Imagineering, he has worked on a multitude of projects. From supervising the story development and production for Soarin’ Over California to story supervising one of my favorite of all time attractions, Pooh’s Hunny Hunt at Tokyo Disneyland. Fitzgerald is a script writer and story developer for countless WDI projects. He wrote and produced Star Tours, worked on the blending of the cinematic Pirates of the Caribbean world to the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction, including the famous pirate Jack Sparrow. He took over the creative direction of Epcot in 2014 and has been dreaming up and creating the magic for the Walt Disney Company since he was first hired in 1979. Is it just possible, that maybe, when hearing the misquote from the Science of Imagineering DVDs, the, “If you can dream it, you can do it” that Tom came across while working with GE triggered a memory, that made him think, hey, I wrote that! When, in reality, memories tend to get a bit muddled. Could that be? Because Tom did not write THAT quote. What he wrote, once again for the attraction’s script and signage, was, ‘If WE can dream it, WE can do it.”\n\nASKING JIM KORKIS – THE AUTHOR, HISTORIAN, ALL AROUND GREAT GUY\n\nWhenever I begin my research of any story I write for my Instagram posts or my blog, I tend to lean towards two historians and their books to help me verify and corroborate any information, Jim Korkis and the late great Chief Archivist Emeritus, Dave Smith.\n\nWhile researching my story, I thought to turn to Korkis to ask for his thoughts on the subject as he has written on the subject previously in various publications. And, like me, he has also confirmed the famous quote as Fitzgerald’s in the past. I think of Korkis as the Disney Detective. He provides corroborative evidence and never takes one account as the true story without dissecting countless other stories first to confirm the truth. He is everything a historian should strive and aspire to be like.\n\nKorkis has written 30 books about Disney and several other books about animation and has an additional two new books coming out the first week of May, Kungaloosh! The Mythic Jungles of Walt Disney World, which I hear has half the book devoted to Jungle Cruise, Trader Sam’s, and Disney’s Animal Kingdom Park, with two interviews with legendary Imagineer alumnus Joe Rohde! His 2nd book coming out is called Hidden Treasures of Walt Disney World Resort Hotels, which sounds like a great book sharing the histories and stories behind the resorts, and so much more.\n\nToday, Korkis contributes weekly to www.mouseplanet.com, www.yourfirstvisit.com, www.cartoonresearch.com, and monthly to www.allears.net\n\nHaving learned about Sheralyn, I thought Jim would be the person to turn to. To date, I have not yet seen Jim write about Sheralyn Silverstein and I wanted to know what he thought on the subject. What he thought of Tom’s claims from over a decade ago, but mostly, I wanted to know where he now stands on who authored the tag line, “If you can dream it, you can do it.”\n\nC: Do you agree that Tom must have forgotten how he reimagined the wording in the script he wrote for Horizons?\n\nKorkis: I don’t think Fitzgerald consciously borrowed that phrase to claim as his own. As a writer, you read tons of stuff and sometimes something gets buried in the subconscious that seeps out when you need something and it just seems right somehow. I have never heard of Fitzgerald ever taking credit for something from someone else.\n\nKorkis also stated: “However, that wouldn’t be the first time an Imagineer “borrowed” a phrase from elsewhere… the Imagineers dubbing the Epcot model at Carousel of Progress “Progress City” because sponsor GE was using the phrase at the time “Progress is our most important product.”\n\nC: Do you know about when the quote, “If you can dream it, you can do it” first started to appear as Walt’s?\n\nKorkis: As soon as Horizons opened (1983), people who saw it on the wall of the queue immediately assumed it was a Walt quote since Disney had often done that in the past including Epcot’s Living with the Land attraction.\n\nC: In your opinion, what is your stance on who first wrote “If you can dream it, you can do it”?\n\nKorkis: In my opinion, it seems like Silverstein should get credit for the line that we all know today.\n\nWho is Sheralyn Silverstein?\n\nSo now we all know Sheralyn Silverstein wrote, “If you can dream it, you can do it” for GE in 1981. What happened to her after she wrote the quote Jack Welch bought? The following are more excerpts from my interview.\n\nS: I was given opportunities to work on other things at Marsteller New York. I worked on ads for cars, women did not work on cars back then, they just didn’t. I never wanted to be pigeonholed into so called feminine products because you are female. You should be able to work on everything. So, I worked very hard to try to change that.\n\nAfter a few years Sheralyn would go one to write tag lines for everything from Dannon yogurt to Grape Nuts.\n\nS: I tell people if you walk down an aisle in the supermarket, every single aisle there’s something I worked on, every single aisle.\n\nNow a Creative Director/Copy Writer, Sheralyn Silverstein has gone on to create some amazing campaigns. For Olive Garden in 1997 she wrote, “When you’re here, you’re family,” which ‘Late Night with Jimmy Fallon’ ended up buying in 2016 and for Bank of America she wrote, “What would you like the power to do?”\n\nAnother campaign she worked on while working at BrandUnion, NY (now SuperUnion) was for the Lead the Way Fund. She was apart of a team, including Executive Creative Director Jamie Ambler, assigned to work on the project. Sheralyn sounded so very passionate about this campaign and these group of men and their families. She told me this was another campaign that she was most proud of to work on.\n\nShe explained that it was started by James P. Regan, who’s only son, Sgt. James (Jimmy) Regan was killed by an IED which targeted his vehicle in northern Iraq in 2007. His father turned to Sheralyn and Jamie to create a campaign that would help motivate people to donate.\n\nS: I came up with a line, “PEACE CAN BE HELL TOO.” It was rewarding for me to do this for them. ‘PEACE CAN BE HELL TOO’ is one of the best things I ever did. That’s for sure.\n\nTalking with Sheralyn Silverstein was an absolute privilege. Yes, I wrote her first AND last name…AGAIN! Maybe, just maybe, I’m trying to get you to remember it. So, the next time you hear or see that someone is quoting Walt Disney incorrectly as the person who said, “If you can dream it, you can do it” or even Imagineer Tom Fitzgerald, you can politely educate them with the history of the quote and the name of the Junior Copywriter who did not think her quote was too ‘pie in the sky’ for General Electric back in 1981.\n\nhttp://www.leadthewayfund.org\n\n(Click the link above if you’d like to learn more or donate to the Lead The Way Fund)\n\nFeatured at this year’s Epcot International Festival of the Arts at Walt Disney World, is artist Sam Carter. This may be Sam’s first experience at the Festival of the Arts but he’s no stranger to the guests. Sam is well known among Disney aficionados so it is no surprise that his artwork has been selling out. Perhaps it’s because Sam is able to capture the feeling and nostalgia of the attractions in the Pop Art style he creates, which quickly draws in his audience’s attention. Whether it be his “Crooning in the Tiki Room” piece depicting the birds brightly signing words from Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room attraction, or his “Progress” painting depicting the many eras in time the Father character John travels in the Carousel of Progress attraction, the art is captivating, purposeful, and just simply fun to look at.\n\nI was able to meet with Sam over a brief Zoom session. We talked about his love of Disney art, his long career at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California and how he became a WonderGround Gallery Artist creating memorable pieces of art.\n\nSam Meets The Master Illustrator\n\nSam: “Ever since I was a kid I was into Disney Gallery art. I don’t know how many 10 year old kids knew artists names like I did, but there was an artist named Charles Boyer, who did a ton of artwork for Disney and my mom knew I was into art and that I liked him. She found out that he was going to appear at the Disneyland Gallery and brought me to meet him. He autographed a lithograph for me, to this day it still hangs in my room, and I absolutely adore it. I think that’s what planted the seed, yep, that’s what I want to do.”\n\n(Photo Credit: Sam Carter) 10 year old Sam Carter with Disney Legend Charles Boyer\n\nDisney Legend Charles Boyer was Disneyland’s first full-time artist, and because of his 45 years with the resort, was known as Disneyland’s master illustrator.\n\nAfter Sam talked to Charles Boyer, just that one day was all it took for him to be inspired to study Boyer’s style. Sam began to notice Boyer’s composition, how he placed things in certain areas in his paintings and how he would paint his characters because, as Sam explained, “There’s a difference in how you draw a character, are you drawing the character how it appears in a cartoon or do you draw Mickey how he looks in his costume in a parade? You have to really decide what this is for and you have to be strategic, wondering who the audience is.”\n\nSam Becomes a Disneyland Cast Member\n\nMany of Sam’s art pieces reflect the best of Disney’s in-Park Entertainment, it’s self-reflective as Sam spent a great many years working in the parades at the Disneyland Resort.\n\nIn 1995, Sam would begin to work at Disneyland in the Parades and Show Support Department. He was hired as a float driver for the epic summer of when the best day and night parade of all time (in my humble opinion) ran together, The Lion King Celebration Parade by day and the Main Street Electrical Parade at night. In 1997, Sam would be inspired by another daytime parade he worked, the Hercules Victory Parade.\n\nThe entire time he was in the parade department, he was trying to get into the Art Department. By 2005, ten years later, Sam shared with me that he was trying to get noticed and it just wasn’t happening. Ten years had gone by and then he decided that he would paint a mural in the Parade building, located backstage.\n\nSam: “I painted the mural just for the fun of it (with permission of course). I loved the history and I thought the parade performers needed to know what part of this legacy they’re all in. Hey, you’re in a Disneyland parade! This goes back to Walt’s days and now you’re a part of that and I thought that was cool to teach that lesson to everyone that walked down those hallways.”\n\nHaving worked with Sam in the Parade Department and seeing the beginnings of his mural take shape was perhaps one of the coolest things I had ever seen during my years in that department. Sam had always been so gracious with his artistry. He would create the designs for the cast parade t-shirts, create keepsakes for the Tink Crew (masters of flight that helped Tinkerbell fly, if she didn’t have enough Pixie Dust that is) and for me, well, he created a team logo shirt when I was first diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1999. It was just something he did. To this day, if Sam created it, even if it was 25 years or more ago, we still have what he made for us. We all saw the talent Sam had and we, as a tight-knit Cast Member family were always so proud of him.\n\nThe building where the mural is located is occupied by all Cast Members required to pull off a parade, the performers, the float drivers, makeup artists, wig specialists, choreographers, and the like. Every time someone walks down the hallway, they are reminded that they are a part of that legacy that started back when Walt Disney first opened his park in 1955. It was another gift from Sam to his Parade family.\n\nNo one can walk through the parade building without seeing Sam’s mural, which finally led to eyes being opened by those in Disney Creative Entertainment. It wouldn’t be too much longer until Sam was on their radar, and soon thereafter, Sam would be hired as an Art Specialist designing events of all sizes for the Disneyland Resort in Creative Entertainment.\n\nThe Santa Car and John Lasseter\n\nAs a Creative Event Designer, Sam created some epic unforgettable moments at the Disneyland Resort. One in particular that came to Sam’s mind was the Cars Land Christmas Billboard Overlay. Which Sam described as “Super fun.”\n\nSam: “I loved that. It’s funny, because when I was drawing it, I had to check in with Pixar and send them my artwork for approvals. Pixar was making sure it was how it should be, and it was a humongous file. It kept crashing my computer!\n\nSam went on to tell me that he was bouncing off ideas with Dave Caranci, of Resort Enhancement, (who has since been promoted to Manager Creative Development at Walt Disney Imagineering) about the designs he wanted to create for the billboard. Sam told Dave he wanted to add snowflakes to the billboard and that’s when Dave let Sam know that his team was making snowflakes out of wrenches to be placed throughout Cars Land, which gave Sam the idea for the snowflake wrenches that he would then add to his billboard design.\n\nNext, Sam wanted to add a Santa car with reindeer to his billboard. He’d need to receive Pixar approval again, and that’s when he recounted an exciting moment.\n\nPhoto/Design Credit: Sam Carter\n\nSam: “I wanted a Santa car with reindeer. Pixar got back to me and actually sent me a scanned sketch from (John) Lasseter with his writing saying what he always pictured a Santa car would look like. I HAVE A SKETCH FROM JOHN LASSETER saying make it look like this! The reindeer are jet skis and Santa is a big red Chrysler with a sled. So, if you look closely at the artwork for Santa and the reindeer, that’s based off the artwork Lasseter had already envisioned and sent to me.”\n\nThe Buena Vista Street Christmas Tree\n\nI remembered Sam had also created something very special with the Christmas tree located on Buena Vista Street at Disney California Adventure Park and I asked him to explain to me more about the involvement of the design process.\n\nSam: “Oh yes, the tree design at Disney California Adventure Park. At Creative Entertainment, our offices are next door to Resort Enhancement and I became good friends with Dave Carranci. We were talking about Christmas and he was bouncing ideas off of me, what should a tree look like in 1930’s Los Angeles? We were brainstorming and thinking about it. Then he asked me to help with ornaments. Back in the 1930’s, Walt Disney licensed and sold Christmas lights with characters on each light and on each light was a bell. We both did research and we found pictures of what they looked like in the 1930’s. There’s this Clarabelle and Horace, Mickey and Minnie carrying a Christmas tree, and Goofy playing a flute. I hand drew each drawing as it looked back then. They were then made (from Sam’s drawings) and so now the ornaments at Disney California Adventure are based on the ornaments from the 1930’s. No one is going to know that, but what I’m hoping is, some grandma or grandpa is going to walk over there and see that and get a flashback, and think ‘I had that when I was a kid.’ I just hope one grandma or grandpa gets to see that. That’s what I’m hoping for. I haven’t heard of that happening yet, but it’s possible, right?”\n\nPhoto Credit Sam Carter: 1930’s Mickey Mouse lights far left and Sam’s designed bells, artwork and design by Sam Carter\n\nI don’t know if any grandparent has seen Sam’s ornaments and if, by doing so, it brought them back to a moment of joy from their childhood, but that continues to show how Sam creates his art. Everything he puts into his artwork is intentional to provoke a feeling, a memory.\n\n“Fight on for ol’ SC…”\n\nSam would remain with Creative Art Entertainment at the Disneyland Resort for seven years until 2012, when he was handpicked and offered a job as Creative Director of Design at the University of Southern California. It was an epic jump up for Sam. Although it was a great career move, it lacked the Pixie dust Sam was used to. But, the benefit of no longer being a Cast Member for the Walt Disney Company, meant that Sam could begin to consult for other theme parks and attractions, like at Universal Studios Hollywood’s Springfield land, where he created the Bumblebee Man’s Taco Truck design and designed a light parade for Six Flags Magic Mountain, all the while maintain his position at USC.\n\nPhoto/Design Credit Sam Carter Creative\n\nDuring this time, Sam also created an elevated North Pole fantasy voyage on the Queen Mary docked in Long Beach, California. For this special event, Sam would single handedly create the concept down to instructing the employees working the event on how important it was that they, too, were in on the magical story that the ship was travelling to the North Pole.\n\nPhoto/Design Credit Sam Carter Creative\n\nBecoming a WonderGround Gallery Artist\n\nNot working as a Cast Member had another benefit for Sam, he could now become a gallery artist, like Charles Boyer before him. WonderGround Gallery had long wanted Sam’s art pieces in their showroom, but because Sam was a Cast Member, there was a conflict, and they could not show his pieces. But by 2012, Sam was no longer an employee of the MOUSE, and so by 2013, Sam had his first art signing during his birthday weekend at WonderGround Gallery at Downtown Disney in Anaheim.\n\nPaintings by Sam Carter Art:\n\nSam: “It was a dream come true. I had a signing at WonderGround. I had 4 pieces in their gallery that 1st year. Beauty and the Beast, Wreck it Ralph, Mulan and the Lion King. After that show, I was trying to get in the show again, but it was taking a long time and I didn’t get back into the gallery until 2019. It took 6 years after my first signing to get another group of art going and that’s when I did my Fantasmic! piece, because I keep trying to push the Entertainment side. I also had the Country Bear Jamboree painting, which is one my most favorite things ever and those went crazy viral, people loved them and then WonderGround asked, ‘What more can you do? What else can you show us?’”\n\nPaintings by Sam Carter Art\n\nFour More Pieces…next stop Epcot\n\nSam pitched to WonderGround the ideas he had for his next art pieces and several of his ideas were chosen. Sam went on to tell me that these paintings became his quarantine projects and then he explained that while he calls his art paintings, they are digital art and he further explained his process,\n\nSam: “Ever since I started working at USC in L.A., I’d take the train there every day and I’d have my MacBook and digital drawing pad. I was doing all my artwork on the train so that’s how I left the acrylic paint in the dust and started doing digital pixels, I still call it paint because I draw it first and then draw it again on a computer.”\n\nBy the beginning of 2020, right before the pandemic happened, Sam had taken a leap of faith and left his Directorship at USC to concentrate on his consulting business, Sam Carter Art, as well as his art pieces for WonderGround.\n\nThe artwork that the gallery had chosen were two more Country Bear pieces to flank the piece he had created back in 2013 (Big Al to be displayed one side while Henry is on the other side). The Country Bear pieces ended up evolving into just Big Al for this year, but Sam is hoping he’ll create Henry for the other side in the future, as he has envisioned the three paintings being displayed together.\n\nFollowing Big Al, Sam was also approved to paint his Carousel of Progress piece, The Muses, (from the parade that Sam loved), and the Enchanting Tiki Room.\n\nCredit: Sam Carter Art\n\nSam: “It’s the first time where I think that these 4 pieces are the best things I have ever done. I can’t really say that about past artwork, I’m really picky with stuff I put out there. I took a lot of critique classes at Cal State Fullerton and the critiques are really beaten into you, so I’m able to not take it personally. I have a mindset of well, I make it perfect so no one can critique it. I put that amount of time into it. But, even if they do critique it, art is subjective, so they can have their own opinion, and that’s fine, but I make sure every detail I do, there’s a reason for it. Whether it’s my gallery art or whether it’s a design for a theme park. Nothing is done by accident, there’s a reason for everything and every piece is loaded with stuff.\n\n“Where the Birds Sing Words and the Flowers Croon…”\n\nI asked Sam about his creative process in painting these 4 newest iconic pieces that premiered at the Festival of the Arts at Epcot this year.\n\nSam: “Well, while I work on each piece, I listen to the music for the attraction. The Tiki Room is only 20 minutes long and it takes hours to make this painting, so I found on YouTube the Trader Sam’s background music so I listened to this cool music, and then I start to work on it. The music is going and the kids walk in and say, ‘Oh Tiki Room, cool.’ They don’t know what I’m doing, but they’ll see something on my computer screen and then they go to Disneyland and they’ll see it on the wall and they are like, ‘Hey, that’s what you did at home.’ They are starting to put it together. They know we’re going to Walt Disney World for Daddy’s art show. It’s pretty awesome.”\n\nCredit/Design: Carter Creative – Be sure to stop by the WonderGround tent in the Morocco Pavilion at Epcot to see Sam Carter through January 26th\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nI asked Sam if he had any exciting projects on the horizon and he told me that he is helping out with the design of a video game. He’s there to make sure that it has an elevated quality and style to it and he will also be doing the logos and branding. He tells me that he never thought he’d be working on a video game, but this is a perfect time for him to be working on it, because he can create from home. Though it won’t be out for another two years from now, Sam says he’s having a blast.\n\nSam also gave me an inside scoop and told me he designed the 50th anniversary popcorn buckets for Walt Disney World.\n\nSam: “I feel like Disneyland’s 50th anniversary was 10 minutes ago. So to be working on the 50th at Walt Disney World is so cool. I’m such a nerd for this kind of stuff. I’ve had it finished since over the Christmas break, but nobody will get to see it until October 1st when the 50th anniversary celebration begins. It’s so hard to work on stuff for a year or so and I can’t share it, I’m a chatty guy, I want to show it, but I can’t. When you design for a popcorn bucket, it’s a Walt Disney popcorn bucket, not a Sam Carter Art piece, but I still know I did it and it’s exciting to be a part of that.”\n\nIt’s in the Blood\n\nSam Carter, a self-taught artist, credits his parents for the abilities he has today. His mother would take Sam to Disneyland often and nurtured his artistic talent. Sam is also a son of an aerospace engineer. His father was a brilliant man who would find joy in drawing caricatures for his friends at work. It wasn’t until after his father’s passing that Sam took a closer look at the art his father had created. Seeing his father’s art hit him differently than it had before. Sam discovered that his father wasn’t just a strategic left brain thinker. He discovered his dad did indeed have creative skills. Sam has since discovered within himself, that he’s more like his father than he thought, as Sam said, “I’ve found myself drifting to left brain design since my artwork is so thought out and meticulously detailed.” Methodical creativity must run strong in the blood of the Carter family.\n\nSam: “The thing that I need to pinch myself on is when I look back, to being that 10 year old kid and getting excited to see Charles Boyer, it’s what I get to do now. So, whenever I get down on the dumps, I remind myself that I actually get to do what I’ve always wanted to do, and it’s not my full-time job, I do it for fun.”\n\nCheck out these fantastic short clips showing Sam creating some extra magic for 4 original pieces that can be purchased at Epcot during the Festival of the Arts.\n\nWhere you can find Sam: On Instagram @cartarsauce instagram.com/cartarsauce\n\nOn Twitter @cartarsauce http://Twitter.com/@cartarsauce\n\nWebsite: Creative Art Services Request or to access his store and blog. http://samcarterart.com\n\nIf you’ve visited a Disney theme park, then you’ve most likely seen the detailed artistry of the talented scenic artist John Rayburn. But who is John Rayburn and how was he able to paint some of the most iconic and beloved attractions and parade floats? From Splash Mountain, to Abraham Lincoln’s hands, to the very popular Disneyland holiday overlays at both the Haunted Mansion and “it’s a small world,” it all came about with a bit of luck, a lot of talent, and the “Baroque Hoedown.”\n\nI first met John when I started at Disneyland as a float driver in the Main Street Electrical Parade back in 1992. John’s long career with the Mouse started 12 years prior in 1980 when he was cast as a performer in the same nighttime classic parade. An amazing and talented performer with a seemingly unending amount of energy, John would continue to perform and entertain guests in various roles over the years until his final parade performance in the Christmas Fantasy Parade in 1998.\n\nIt was fun talking with John about his 18 years with Disneyland’s Parade Department and to reminisce about the time we were in the same unit for the “Cruisin’ the Kingdom Parade.” We had some good times during that parade, just don’t get him started on “Light Magic,” which John claims to still have vivid nightmares about. I’ll definitely have to save that story for another time. For today’s blog post, I want to share John Rayburn’s talent as an artist that began when he picked up a paint brush at the age of six.\n\nIt Was a Game Changer\n\nJohn Rayburn is a self-taught artist and has been painting nearly his whole life. At the age of 12 years old, he was painting models so expertly that the Military Shop, a local model hobby shop, asked him to paint their display models. He was too young to work for them, so instead, he was paid in merchandise. Being able to choose whatever he wanted from the store, as payment, was a deal John gladly accepted.\n\nIt was at this hobby shop in Lakewood, California where he met an employee named Jim Murphy. John likes to make the objects he paints look real and credits Jim with his first breakthrough into doing just that. John told me that the painting techniques Jim taught him, like which colors to look at for shading, were a game changer that would inevitably end up giving him a career.\n\nArt and the Disneyland Connection\n\nIn the late 1970’s, John’s older sister worked in the Parade Department. He said some of her friends from the parades would come over to the house and one of those friends was a guy named Richard Ferrin. John told me that Richard would always make a point to look at John’s models when he came over. At that time, Richard was not only a ride design Imagineer for the Walt Disney Company, he also moonlit as a performer in the Main Street Electrical Parade.\n\nJohn reconnected with Richard Ferrin in 1980, when John was finally old enough to work as a parade performer at Disneyland. Richard let John know that he was leaving Imagineering to start his own company with his friend Rick Bastrup called R&R Creative Amusement Designs, Inc. (R&R). As a ride engineer, Richard explained to John that he would need people to build architectural study models and asked John if he’d be interested in creating and painting the models. John jumped at the chance and started to work for R&R in Anaheim, California.\n\nAfter approval of one of John’s completed architectural model builds and paint samples for a job, John shared with me a conversation he had with Richard. It was a brief conversation that would further propel John on his career path:\n\nRichard: “What if you did that a bit bigger?”\n\nJohn: “What do you mean?”\n\nRichard: “You’ve already done the paint finish that we wanted, it’s approved, and now it needs to be done on the job site. Why can’t you paint it bigger? Instead of using a small brush (like the ones used on models) get bigger ones. Instead of a small air brush, get a larger one.”\n\nIt was not an outrageous suggestion, but it would take Richard in that moment to illuminate John’s mind to the possibility of taking on a new endeavor and hone new full-scale artistry skills. From that moment, John’s life as a model builder and painter would forever change, he was now a full-scale scenic artist.\n\nLiving Close to the Castle Has Its Advantages\n\nRichard started to send John on various job sites where he would meet folks from Disney who would end up pulling him in on various projects. Plus, folks from Disney knew Richard from Imagineering and would ask if he knew anyone local that can paint finishes fast and Richard would always recommend John as he could fix and match paint faster than anyone, plus he was a local and could get to the park faster than someone from Los Angeles. That’s how, as John says he, “got the in” at Disneyland.\n\nAt first Disney would use John to produce quick paint finishes, as well as paint repairs and paint blending for attractions including, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse, and the Jungle Cruise.\n\nYou May Get Wet at This “Laughing Place”\n\nPaint repairing on existing attractions to perfection undoubtedly proved to Disney that John was up for his first big job at Disneyland. For this project, John was assigned to scenic paint a new attraction, one that would be billed by Disney as the “Tallest, fastest, thrillingest attraction this side of Star Tours,” and that of course is none other than Splash Mountain, based on Disney’s 1946 film, “Song of the South.”\n\nJohn, along with an estimated 10 to 12 other scenic artists, age and grain artists and as John said, “a ton of general painters,” all contributed to the painting of the exterior and interior parts of the mountain. For any scenic elements that were added to the attraction after it opened, however, John became the sole scenic artist.\n\nSplash Mountain would open the summer of 1989, after a few months of delays, but in the minds of many guests, it was certainly an attraction that was well worth the wait.\n\nThe Work Keeps Coming\n\nJohn would continue to work on several more projects for Disneyland throughout the years, including painting the brand new Mickey’s Toontown, which opened to guests on January 24, 1993. John was also made the sole scenic artist the year after it opened, tasked with maintaining the land’s vivid hues as well as painting any and all upgrades.\n\n1993 Toontown Photos Credit: John Rayburn Consulting\n\nAND…ACTION…CUT…CUT…MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN!\n\nBy 2001, John was a proven scenic artist. So much so that he was assigned as a scenic artist for the brand new, yet to open, Disney California Adventure Park. John would work on the initial paint for the Park all the way up until the February 8, 2001, opening date. He was also the only scenic artist approved to be in the Park the full day prior to opening, as he was tasked specifically by Chris Runco, Concept Designer at Walt Disney Imagineering, to touch up paint at surrounding restaurants and the iconic Grizzly Mountain.\n\nJohn shared with me about an incident that I had all but forgotten until he brought it up, which I thought was quite humorous.\n\nBy 2001, I was now working mostly in the TV Productions/Broadcast Services Department at the Disneyland Resort and was working on a commercial film shoot for the new Disney theme park. We were supposed to film Grizzly River Rapids, but we couldn’t get a clean shot because there was a man painting on the mountain. Turns out, that man was John.\n\nJohn was given a mandate from Imagineering that he had full run of the entire park for 24 hours, allowing John to scan the park for needed touch ups. He had until 8AM on opening day February 8th , to complete the job. What John thought would be a relaxing day of just him and his paint brush, turned into something quite different.\n\nJohn told me, “I was doing a lot of touch up work on Grizzly for Chris (Runco) and I caused a big problem. There were about 300 people, all over the mountain. They were going to film a commercial but failed to ask Imagineering if they could have permission to do it. Runco’s answer was no, they couldn’t have permission because little old me needed to do a bunch of paint in the waterways. The film crew was furious with me! They had to remove their cameras and proceeded to stare at me for an hour and a half until I was finished.”\n\nWe were both able to laugh at it now, and it was certainly a good thing the film crew waited, not that we had a choice, but because of John’s extra touch of paint on Grizzly Peak mountain and it’s River Run waterways, it made for even more gorgeous scenery, not only for the crew to film, but for the guests who would be introduced to the park for their very first time once Disney California Adventure Park opened the next day.\n\nJohn Meets Garner Holt\n\nJohn was introduced to Garner Holt by Richard and Rick of R&R. They would work together on various projects, like the MGM theme park in Las Vegas. Garner would build the animatronics and John would paint the set pieces.\n\nDuring the 1990’s Garner had been trying to get his foot in the door with Disney to get some jobs going. But that proved difficult as Disney was using mostly internal staff and only a few outsourced vendors. Since John was working on projects with Disney, he was able to take some of Garner’s products to Lloyd Bressler, who was in charge of Imagineering Construction, and suggested that he should really take a look at Garner Holt because he was doing some amazing things with audio-animatronics.\n\nGarner’s first breakthrough with Disney was the creation of the puppetronic character Phil for the “Hercules’ Victory Parade” in 1996.\n\nWho’s This Garner Holt and Rayburn Fellow?\n\nGarner Holt Productions was now beginning to work more frequently on jobs with the Walt Disney Company, from parade float builds for Disneyland to set pieces for Tokyo DisneySea. But it wasn’t until after John Rayburn and Garner got into the Great Moment’s with Mr. Lincoln Theater that Garner Holt Production’s reputation was solidified.\n\nJohn said, “Redoing Lincoln Theater caused some nervous moments because it was something that Walt worked on. You had people on the internet wondering who was doing this stuff and who is this Garner Holt Company? Who’s this John Rayburn guy doing the paint? What are they doing and are they going to wreck this attraction?”\n\nBrad Kay, Imagineering Art Director, would assign John with the solo job of painting one of Walt Disney’s most beloved attractions. John painted the entire theater. He even painted Lincoln’s chair and touched up Lincoln’s hands.\n\nThe rehab was a great success for both John and Garner Holt. So much so, that they were both hired on for one more project of that year.\n\nOne More Job For 2001\n\nWhile working on Lincoln Theater, John shared that Brad Kay had told him that there was something coming up in the works for both he and Garner, but, he couldn’t tell John what it was. John persisted, and all Brad would say was that, “It’s going to be a very haunted overlay.”\n\nJohn said, “So I thought cool, it might be an overlay for the Haunted Mansion. I didn’t think too much of it. Then it came down from Brian Sandahl, Senior Art Director at the Disneyland Resort, to hire Garner Holt Productions for the overlay and Brad said I should paint it. So we ended up doing the overlay.”\n\nThis last big project of the year for John would prove difficult, painful, but oh so memorable. I am of course talking about the Haunted Mansion Holiday which is themed after Tim Burton’s film, “The Nightmare Before Christmas.”\n\n‘TWAS THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS…\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Haunted Mansion Holiday overlay at Disneyland was not dreamed up nor produced by Walt Disney Imagineering, rather, it was a collaboration between Disneyland’s Creative Director Steven Davison (who has since been promoted to Creative Director/ Walt Disney Imagineering Creative Entertainment) and Senior Designer Brian Sandahl, (who has since been promoted to Senior Designer/Show Development and Producer at Disney Entertainment Productions).\n\nAfter the success of “it’s a small world” Holiday, which opened in 1997, Davison’s next idea for an attraction overlay would be for the Haunted Mansion. Davison, along with Senior Writer Carolyn Gardner, would rewrite the classic poem, “‘Twas the Night before Christmas” for the attraction overlay.”\n\nOnce guests enter into the foyer of the Haunted Mansion, the Ghost Host begins to recite the following “‘Twas the Nightmare Before Christmas poem:”\n\n‘Twas a long time ago (now longer than it seems). In a place that perhaps, you have seen in your dreams. For the story that you are about to be told Began in the holiday worlds of old. I know you’re curious to see what’s inside. It’s what happens when two holidays collide!\n\n(Guests now enter the stretching room and the poem continues)\n\nWelcome, my friends, to our Christmas delight. Come witness a ghoulishly glorious sight. It’s time for our holiday tale to begin. There’s no turning back now-please, come all the way in. Our holiday tale is a tale that’s quite charming. But during this season, it’s sometimes alarming. So relax and reflect, feel free to take pause, While we tell you a tale about dear Sandy Claws. ‘Twas the nightmare before Christmas, And all through the house, Not a creature was peaceful-not even a mouse The stockings, all hung by the chimney with care, When opened that morning would cause such a scare. The children, nestled all snug in their beds Would nightmares of monsters and skeleton heads!\n\nBlacklight Paint, Blood, and More Blacklight Paint\n\nJohn shared with me that the installation of the overlay was a huge build out. There were a lot of unknowns for them because nothing had ever been taken into the ride since it’s opening on August 9, 1969, especially as an overlay.\n\n“The Install was horrendous. It was crazy. They had to get these big giant pieces back into places that had no access. The piece that really comes to mind that was really hard to bring in was the pumpkin mountain.” John said.\n\nJohn explained to me that the famous pumpkin mountain, which is made up of “3 to 4” pieces that stack on top of each other, are built within a metal frame. The problem was they had to get the mountain, piece by piece, to where it sits for the overlay, which is located behind the statues in the graveyard scene. There was no way to get the mountain into that area without having to tie ropes to each one of the pieces. The crew would then have to get up to the catwalks that are located high above the tracks of the attraction to be able to lift the pieces up on pulleys.\n\nJohn describes it as such, “The pieces had to all be swung over like Tarzan while crew were up on the high catwalks. Then they’d have to get the piece into position to bring it down in front of where the statutes are located because you can’t just slide it over. Below the statues is about a 15 foot drop down to the projectors below. It all had to be lowered in there, piece by piece.”\n\nBy the time the pumpkin mountain was Tarzan swung below the catwalk and put into place, it had been chipped up pretty bad, so John had to spend several weeks to repaint and repair it. The problem with the mountain, was, it’s situated in the pit where the projectors are. The tallest ladder they had that would fit in that area only got John halfway up the mountain, so he’d need to get a 15 foot pole to attach his paint brush to so that he would then be able to paint the areas located at the top half of the mountain.\n\nJohn tells me, “What sticks with me, is, it’s a lot of long hours, and you’re in the dark a long time and you kind of lose perspective. Is it day? Is it night? Everyone’s tired, and all of a sudden I begin to see these blotches going up the mountain. I was thinking, what is going on? I’m wearing socks, because I don’t want to leave shoeprints on it (blacklight paint picks up everything). I’m in my socks and so dust my socks off and climb back up the mountain but I keep seeing these big giant black blotches of something. I’m tired, my feet hurt really badly for some reason, and it’s cold! WHAT IS THIS STUFF?! I’m trying to wipe it off, I don’t have any regular latex paint on here, what have I got on this thing?! I’m trying to clean it off, but it’s semi dried. I didn’t know what was going on, so I had to start to paint over it, but see that it’s coming through the paint…and…OH MY GOSH, it’s going from bad to worse!”\n\nThen John Realized…\n\nThose black splotches he saw all up and down the mountain was blood! John’s feet were bleeding! Located down below in that area are dead broken Manzanita branches used for scenery. Those branches were slicing up John’s feet as he was going up and down the mountain, leaving a trail of blood. Seems rather fitting, being the Haunted Mansion and all, but poor John. He tells me he had to get peroxide to clean up the mountain to get it pristine again so that he would be able to reapply the blacklight paint. He tells me, “IT WAS CRAZY!” Every time I go past Pumpkin Mountain now, I’ll forever think of John leaving his trail of blood.\n\nJohn would paint all the lettering on the signs for the attraction, he’d paint the Jack Skellington and Zero animatronics that Garner Holt created, he’d paint the wreaths and design their snake like eyes in the stretching room, as well as paint the singing Venus Flytraps, and so much more. An installation that was supposed to last 3 years, has gone on to be an 18 year tradition (due to park closure the attraction did not run in 2020).\n\nPhoto Credit: John Rayburn Consulting\n\nWith a Disneyland Entertainment Art budget, Art Director Brian Sandahl did not have enough in his budget for an animatronic Sally for the 2001 opening, which he so desperately wanted. He would eventually get a Sally several years later…but not until Tokyo Disneyland got their’s first.\n\nChris Crump, Larry Nikolai and Tokyo Disneyland Open Their Haunted Mansion Holiday with Multiple Animatronic Versions of Sally in 2004\n\nShortly after the success of the Mansion’s holiday overlay, John was back at Garner Holt Productions working on something else when he gets paged to go to the phone and it’s to talk to Larry Nikolai, an Artist and now former Art Director/Producer at Imagineering. Larry asked John if he had any paint left over from when he painted the Haunted Mansion Holiday. John let him know he that he did. Larry then immediately told John that he’d meet him at Garner’s the next day.\n\nJohn continued to tell me, “The next day both Larry and Chris Crump (former Principal Show Production Designer at Walt Disney Imagineering, and son of Disney Legend Rolly Crump) walked into the shop at Garner Holt Productions. Larry introduced me to Chris. He’s a great guy that likes to have fun, he’s always laughing and is a very sharp designer. So they walk in and asked if I could produce all new paint samples, exactly as I had done it before for the mansion’s holiday overlay. I asked why, what’s going on?”\n\nThe build for Tokyo Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion Holiday went quite smoothly. John painted everything the exact same way he had done for Disneyland. The banners requiring lettering were all done the same way, same lettering, same colors, as he was able to use the original artwork as reference. He said all that was simple, the only difficult part was getting Sally’s lip color perfect.\n\n“The only colors that I had to do differently were for Sally. Larry came down for the day, he wanted to make sure Sally was perfect. He said ‘I want a perfect red. Once you get it, I’ll go home.’ I got the specific skin tone color he wanted, he signed off on that. But the lip color was his big thing, reds are extremely hard to mix. If you go one way a little bit, it’s wrecked. You have to throw it out and start all over again. You can’t add any black that’ll make it go too dark, because then it turns grey. You have to bring the color down to the purples and magentas. It’s a very fine line you have to walk. If you put just a tiny drip, it changes everything and it could go too brown, and then you have to throw that out and try again.\n\nI can mix color really fast. I can go into Splash Mountain and they would say the ride is opening in an hour and we’ll need you out of here; I can field mix it and it’s done. It’s fast. But reds are really hard to mix. Even spectrometers, if you go to a hardware store, and ask if they can mix a specific red… (John laughs) GOOD LUCK because spectrometers can’t do it either. But, I finally got it set and Larry approved it. I saved the colors and have the documents Larry signed approving the colors in case Magic Kingdom or another Disney park ever wanted to add the holiday overlay. (Did you hear that Walt Disney World?!)”\n\nJohn now had the colors and painted all the Sallys. The only exception, was he did not paint her pupils. Larry wasn’t sure where she would be positioned exactly at the Haunted mansion in Japan, so instructed John to not paint her pupils. Chris Crump would end up painting her pupils once she was installed into her positions at the mansion.\n\nAll of the set pieces would be delivered to a facility called the “Airport” where Imagineering had a hangar for the staging and packing of items to be shipped overseas. John would met Chris Crump at the “Airport” for one last minute touch up and to provide him with a paint kit before their overseas departure.\n\nIt was at this time that Chris shared some fun tidbits with John about his father Rolly Crump, retired Imagineer and Disney Legend who worked on the design of the original Haunted Mansion.\n\nOne of these fun tidbits was a story Chris would go on to recount about the ballroom dancers in the Haunted Mansion. He told John that as a little kid, he was walking through the mansion with his dad and the other Imagineers when he noticed something in the ballroom scene.\n\nChris said to his dad, “Why are the women leading the men?”\n\nRolly looks at everyone and shouts, “SEE! Even my kid sees it!”\n\nWhat had happened was the figures were set up with the men leading the women in the first room, but, when their image is reflected back into the ballroom, for the Pepper’s Ghost Optical Illusion, their image is reversed, so it appears as though the women are leading the men in the ballroom dance scene. Next time you go on the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland, make sure you look at the dancers, the women are leading the men!\n\nJohn went on to tell me that the Nightmare Before Christmas project for Tokyo Disneyland was all the fun from the first show, but without any of the problems they had originally encountered. No blood trails were left by John this go around! John said they could all relax and have fun while working on Tokyo Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion Holiday, that’s why John said it was one of his all-time favorite projects at Disney to date.\n\nBrian Gets His Sally!\n\nAnd as for Brian Sandahl and his dream of a Sally at Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion Holiday, well he would get one, eventually. Brian had always intended to have a Sally, but Disneyland Entertainment Art and Imagineering are two different beasts with two vastly different budgets to work with. Now that Garner had the molds, because he created them for Tokyo Disneyland, and John saved all the color information for her skin color and lips, the dream of a Sally at Disneyland was becoming a closer reality for Sandahl, but, it would take 15 more years from the time the holiday overlay first began for Brian’s dream to come to fruition. In 2016, Sally finally made it into the Holiday Mansion Overlay. After being painted to perfection by John Rayburn, she now resides in the graveyard scene, lovingly looking at Jack Skellington.\n\nLOOKING TO THE FUTURE\n\nGarner Holt Productions was the first outside company Disney has ever used to create an animatronic character for one if its attractions. Since then they have created more than 400 figures for Disney and its theme parks around the world and now are the world’s largest manufacture of Animatronics and Animatronic figures, parade floats, and so much more. When Disney shut down its Walt Disney Imagineering’s MAPO division, back in 2012, they turned over all the manufacturing of the attractions to Garner Holt Productions. In a statement made by Disney Legend Bob Gurr, he said, “Garner inherits all of Imagineering’s historic animation and show production designs and tooling.”\n\nAnd as for the Scenic Artist? John Rayburn has never been busier.

His top two favorite projects he’s ever painted were painting both the Timber Mountain Log Ride and the Calico Mine Ride at Knott’s Berry Farm, a theme park located just 7 miles from Disneyland.\n\nJohn Rayburn has his own business and you can find him on Facebook at John Rayburn Consulting.

From adorable nurseries to dental offices, to even backyard scenic artistry, like the famous Orange County backyard of architect David Sheegog. Imagine having a model of Splash Mountain in your backyard painted by THE GUY that painted the original Splash Mountain.\n\nI’ll be writing more about John in future. This blog post is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAn in depth interview with Misty Rosas of “The Mandalorian.” Written by Catherine Ramirez\n\nGeorge Lucas once described the late Peter Mayhew as a mime actor. Mayhew, who portrayed Chewbacca in the Star Wars Films for almost 40 years, had only the use of his eyes and body language as a means of expression as the 7’2” tall Wookie. To be able to express and convey so\n\nmany different emotions across a cinematic screen is no easy task, and yet Mayhew did it to utter perfection, all while performing within a suit. I have not seen another suit performer convey such emotion as Peter Mayhew did when he performed as Chewbacca, until I saw the Ugnaught Kuiil in, “The Mandalorian.”\n\nWho is Misty Rosas?\n\nTo understand Kuiil, you’ll have to understand the character’s suit actor, Misty Rosas. Misty was born in Mission Viejo, California and raised in the mountains at Los Piños in the Cleveland National Forest. She had a unique upbringing, enjoying the forest as her backyard.\n\nShe also became quite a skilled gymnast. Misty said that her mom took her to her first gymnastics class when she was 2 ½ years old, and quite often there would be tears when it was time for Misty to leave.\n\nMisty tells me, “Class was never long enough. I was immediately hooked! I loved gymnastics! I loved it so much that it was my life from age 2 ½ until I was 16. By the time I was 12 years old I was a Child Elite gymnast on the U.S. National Gymnastics Team, and again as a Junior Elite at age 13.\n\nThe Olympics were in my sights, but some dreams don’t come true. For me personally, I loved doing gymnastics, but I did not like competing! The mental, physical and emotional pressure just became too much for me, and all of that pressure manifested into an eating disorder. At 16 years old I had to make one of the most difficult decisions of my life, I had to walk away from the sport I loved so much because I was losing my battle with Anorexia. A battle I would fight for many, many years.”\n\nMemories of Misty’s childhood were bittersweet. There was joy but there was also heartbreak. Even with the heartbreak Misty was appreciative of the lessons she learned from her years of training and competing as a gymnast.\n\n“Like all things in life,” Misty tells me, “you’ve gotta take the good with the bad, and learn from the lessons! The invaluable lessons!”\n\nMisty went on to tell me that gymnastics not only taught her how to strength train, but the sport also trained her mentally and gave her emotional strength as well. All those years of gymnastics training gave Misty an understanding of how hard and how long she would have to work at something for it to become a reality.\n\nShe went on to explain, “You just gotta have faith in your journey and keep checking in with yourself. Do you love what you do? You have to love it more than anything because (for most of us) success doesn’t happen overnight. At the end of the day, something like Star Wars is the icing on the cake, and I appreciate it so much more because of all of the struggles I endured and the very long journey I’ve taken to be here now.”\n\nA Twist of Fate…and Some Imagination, Huh?\n\nMisty walked away from gymnastics, choosing to give up the dream of being in the Olympics at the age of 16, bravely disclosing to me that she was lost for a while. Misty ended up graduating high school early and enrolled at Saddleback College, a local community college located in Mission Viejo, California. There she enrolled in dance and voice classes. It’s in those classes where Misty would find her joy once more.\n\nThere were a couple of young ladies in Misty’s dance classes that were parade performers at Disneyland. Because of Misty’s demure height, they told her that she should audition at Disneyland because there were parts in her height range.\n\nMisty tells me, “I didn’t know how to approach auditioning, so I called up Disneyland and I went in for an interview but it was perhaps a lack of communication because the interview was not to work in Entertainment in the Parades Department, it was to work at the hotel. I told the interviewer that I was really trying to figure out how to be a dancer in the parades at the theme park.”\n\nBy a twist of fate, Disneyland Entertainment had just sent over a stack of flyers and Misty was given one. She was told that there was a new show coming out called Fantasmic! (Yes the exclamation mark is part of the title of the show) and she could audition for that.\n\nFate was certainly on Misty’s side. She would end up being one of the original Fantasmic! cast members in 1992. In the now world renowned show with two other incarnations, one of which was performed at Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, and the other version was performed at Tokyo DisneySea in Japan, Misty was cast as one of the dancing monkeys on King Louie’s Barge, based on Disney’s animated feature film The Jungle Book. On the same night, she would also become very good friends with Donald Duck, Minnie Mouse, and sometimes even Mickey Mouse, who liked to frequent the Mark Twain riverboat during the finale of the famous nighttime show.\n\n“It was fun to be a part of because it was a brand new show. The rehearsals during that period of time were long and grueling, but to be 18 and in a show that everyone wanted to see was pretty special.” Misty said.\n\nFull disclosure, I began to work at Disneyland in 1992, starting as a float driver in the Main Street Electrical Parade. That same year Misty began her debut on the River’s of America in Fantasmic! I also worked in Fantasmic! first as a barge driver from 1993 to 1994 (Ursula and Tick Tock) and then as a performer in Fantasmic! from 1999 to 2001. Though we both worked Fantasmic! in the early years, I didn’t know Misty until we both performed in the Lion King Celebration Parade at Disneyland.\n\nWe were both cast as the only two female pole climbers in the parade. From the moment I saw Misty climb and execute her stunts on the pole, 10 feet in the air, I was instantly humbled by her strength and elegance. Misty seemed to possess a strength that few others had. The ease and transitions of her skills going into every stunt looked as effortless as breathing in and out, but believe me, few skills on that pole were easy, but they certainly appeared so for Misty.\n\nTiming is Everything\n\nWhile Misty was performing at Disneyland, she also landed her first Motion Picture film role in Congo, directed by Frank Marshall. I asked Misty about her role and how she got it.\n\nM: “It’s timing. Timing is everything! My gymnastics career was the reason I was right for that role. Looking back, you only remember the joyous moments, but I know how hard it was to execute this role well because it took the producers a very long time to find the right people that would be able to handle the demands, especially for the role of the main gorilla character, Amy. It was a nationwide search to find Amy!\n\nProduction had called my former coach at SCATS Gymnastics (in Huntington Beach, California) and told him that they were looking for people under 5 ft tall. Little people. STRONG, little people, and the role was quickly narrowed down to gymnasts to perform as a Gorilla Artist, which is a type of suit performance work. They asked if he knew anyone over 18 years of age that he could recommend. I was 20. He called me knowing I was performing at Disneyland and that I had some suit experience, and he thought I should try for this role.”\n\nI asked Misty what it was like auditioning for the role of a gorilla and she shared with me that she had to go through a series of 3 separate auditions, each building upon the prior audition.\n\nFirst, she had to show them her upper body strength and overall coordination. The most extreme stunt that she could show the better because they wanted to see if Misty could handle weight on her arms. She performed a few impressive gymnastics skills. She also was given arm extensions and they wanted to see if she could walk and run using the arm extensions, in quadruped, like a gorilla.\n\nMisty says, “It was easy having been a gymnast. I have spent as much time on my hands as I have on my feet! Walking and running in quadruped felt quite natural to me. I made it through the 1st audition.”\n\nThe second audition would become more intense.\n\nMisty describes, “They brought the arm extensions back and these auditions were more intense because it was one on one with Peter Elliott (veteran gorilla performer). He wanted to see if I could act. We were in a dance studio. Just Peter, a camera, me and arm extensions.”\n\nPeter would direct Misty to very slowly walk around and mill about as if it was a typical ordinary day for the gorilla, and then he explained to her that, “Something is going to scare you and you have to react to it. You have to be scared! However you feel you would react, will you cower? Will you try to get away?” After that challenge Misty goes on to tell me about the next challenge, to be aggressive.\n\nOnce again Peter gave a direction. Misty recalls him saying, “You’re milling about in quadruped and a threat comes and this time charge at me and be aggressive, you’re welcome to vocalize.”\n\nMisty tells me that she knows she did end up using her voice, because her friend Jane, who was just outside waiting to audition, was stunned to learn that the voice she had heard so loudly was Misty’s.\n\n“That was you?” Misty remembers Jane asking.\n\nMisty went on to share with me about the final audition.\n\nM: “The final audition was at Stan Winston Studios. I got to meet Stan and fellow veteran gorilla suit performer, John Alexander, and Peter Elliott was there to guide us through this final call back audition. This audition would solidify who they were going to choose and for what roles. I didn’t know if I would get it but knew I had a good chance by that point. Stan wanted to meet everyone that was going to be a part of the film. He not only wanted to see movement, he wanted to see personality, a willingness to work well with a team, and the actor’s response to direction.”\n\nMisty is Cast as the Gorilla Amy in “Congo”\n\nM: “I gained a lot of suit performance experience having worked at Disneyland, but there is NOTHING that can prepare you for this type of suit performance work! I remember going in for the fittings, the various stages of fittings. The head cast, body cast, arm casts, hands and feet cast. Trying on the muscle suit, which is the first layer; then the hair tech. suit that goes over the muscle suit; then the animatronic head (The “blind” head. You do not have any line of sight in animatronic heads) and the head’s attached pack of batteries (Yes! Plural!); lastly, the arm extensions. It was overwhelming at first! …to say the least! I couldn’t see, and I felt like I couldn’t move! I had a lot of hard work a"
