        "text": "Texas' famous Shiner Bock hits Boston bars and retailers later this week.\n\nWhat Yuengling lager is to Pennsylvania ex-pats, Shiner Bock is to displaced southerners. For Boston though, that drought finally comes to an end this week. Spoetzl Brewery has announced that its flagship product is set to enter the Massachusetts beer market for the first time ever. Distributed by Burke Distributing Company, Shiner will be available at Boston area bars and retailers later this week, with the rest of Massachusetts scheduled for the end of July.\n\nFirst opened in 1909 by German and Czech immigrants, Spoetzl is Texas’ largest independent brewery. The iconic brand, once limited to in-state distribution is now the fourth largest brewery in America. Prior to its decision to expand into its 48th state, Boston was far and away the biggest city in the country where Shiner Beers weren’t available.\n\nIn addition to its famous Bock, other offerings will include Shiner White Wing, a Belgian-style white ale brewed with orange and coriander; Ruby Red Bird, made with Texas Ruby Red grapefruit and ginger; and the Family Reunion sampler, which includes Shiner’s Bohemian Black Lager, Wild Hare Pale Ale, Shiner Premium, and two limited editions – Kosmos Reserve and Shiner Kölsch."
