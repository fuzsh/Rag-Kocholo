The brewery was founded in 1909 by German and Czech immigrants who settled in Texas and decided to brew their own delicious beers. Spoetzl, a German immigrant brewmaster, produced many fine beers for the brewery, but his iconic brew, the Shiner Bock, is the best-known of the lot. Over the years, Spoetzl’s tasty brew has become the brewery’s signature drink with a loyal fan base that stretches across the whole of America."
