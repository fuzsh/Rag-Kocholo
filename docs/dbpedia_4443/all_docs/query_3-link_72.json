        "text": "Shiner Brewing\n\nHappy Harry’s Brewery of the Month – July 2024\n\nBy Thomas Pankratz\n\nI was fortunate to visit the Spoetzl Brewery back in February of this year and I gained even more of an appreciation of their products. The thing I appreciated the most about Spoetzl Brewery was their attention to detail in their tasting room and the hospitality we received from the folks at Shiner. As you walk onto the property you begin to realize and grasp how old this brewery is and the care they take to keep the antique aesthetic of the brewery perpetuating. I feel like they take the same mentality with the beer they make as well. Keep brewing very approachable great tasting beer and people will buy it. I and the rest of our Happy Harry’s team had a blast at the brewery as it was a beautiful Texas day where it reached almost 80 degrees. The Lemon Shandy especially tasted delicious. We can’t wait to return.\n\nAmerican-brewed bock beer may seem like a little-known style in the craft beer movement, but one not so small brewery in Texas perfected their version over a century ago. You probably know the name Shiner Bock and there’s a good reason—it’s a good beer. Shiner Bock has become the flagship of the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, Texas. They produce many other fine beers, but Shiner Bock is the best-known of the lot. The brewery is also not shy about claiming to be the ‘oldest independent brewery in Texas.’\n\nThe brewery was founded as the Shiner Brewing Association in 1909 by German and Czech immigrants with a desire for beer from the old country. Shiner Bock was introduced in 1913 and in 1915 German brewmaster, Kosmos Spoetzl, bought the brewery and gave the brewery his last name. Over the years, Shiner Bock has developed a loyal fan base. The story goes that, in true maibock fashion, this lager was originally only brewed to be served during Lent. It was a seasonal beer for many years and came out every spring to the delight of locals. In 1991, Shiner Bock went national and its following increased. It is now available throughout the U.S. and year-round.\n\nShiner Bock continues to produce great beers with a drinkability that is appreciated by all who try this brand. We hope they continue to impress for years to come! Cheers!"
