        "text": "My long held impression of Shiner (Spoetzl Brewery) has been one of abject disappointment. Shiner Bock, the brewery’s flagship beer, although drinkable does little to justify the style it purports to represent. Of their other year-round beers I’ve tried, Shiner Hefeweizen, Blonde, Black Lager and Dunkelweizen (now discontinued), not a one has managed to inspire. I suppose the disappointment is exacerbated by knowing that Shiner is the most widely represented of the Texan microbreweries and its beers are arguably among the poorest.\n\nBefore any Texan readers feel the need to defend the honour of this State icon by shooting this disgruntled foreigner, let me say that I may be slowly coming around. The first challenge to my negative stereotyping came in the form of their Christmas seasonal offering, Shiner Holiday Cheer, which has replaced their aforementioned and rather substandard Dunkelweizen.\n\nHoliday Cheer was a bolt from the blue from Spoetzl. Nothing I’d previously tasted from them prepared me for the richness and boldness of this beer. A dunkelweizen (dark-wheat beer) brewed with Texan peaches and pecans, like the ubiquitous Christmas music that pervades the malls of this country, it is far from subtle. But nor I should say, is it overbearing or cloying, unlike foresaid music. Just a happy blend of sweet fruit, caramelised sugar, a hint of spice and a lingering nutty backbone.\n\nLest I suspect for too long that this beer would prove an oddity in a stable of dwarves, Shiner announced two new beers within the space of three weeks. These are the Shiner Commemorator, and the Shiner Kosmos Reserve, named for the founder of the brewery, Kosmos Spoetzl.\n\nThe Shiner Commemorator is a traditional German doppelbock brewed to commemorate their 100th anniversary. It is made from a blend of two row Munich and Caramel malts, utilising both Hallertauer and Spalter Select hops. The specs according to Shiner’s press release are:\n\nABV: 6.8% OG: 17% Bitterness: 17 IBUs Colour: 30 SRM RDF: 60.7%\n\nThe reviews of this beer at Beeradvocate are all pretty positive. I’m excited to get a hold of this one!\n\nThe Shiner Kosmos Reserve remains enigmatic. It’s not due to make an appearance until sometime next month, and all I can find out about is it is a lager dry-hopped with aromatic hops (“hop jacked” according to the label). Shiner previously brewed a beer under the same name a decade ago, but they are apparently using a different recipe.\n\nAn unfortunate piece of news with this beer is that it is only to be released as a part of Shiner Family Reunion six and twelve packs. Which means that to sample just one of these, one is also purchasing five or ten of their ordinary beers, namely Shiner Bock, Blonde, Hefeweizen, Light, and Black. Perhaps they’ll offer it on tap at the brewery.\n\nSo Shiner, are we seeing a new move in a more adventurous direction, or is this a temporary stretch from mediocrity?\n\nI’d love to hear others thoughts on Shiner beer in general, and certainly if you’ve tried any of these new beers."
