        "text": "The Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, Texas, the 111-year-old independent craft brewery and brewer of the iconic Shiner Bock, announced Aug. 19 the launch of its new craft brewed hard seltzer Shiner Straight Shooter.\n\nJimmy Mauric, Shiner’s Brewmaster, stated, “When we set out to make our first hard seltzer we wanted it had to be genuinely craft brewed. With that in mind, we use just a few simple ingredients and water sourced from our artesian well. We brewed it so it would live up to its name ‘Straight Shooter’ – it is a straightforward, transparent, delicious and refreshing craft brewed hard seltzer.”\n\nShiner looks to offer up a unique take on a hard seltzer that is crafted in smaller batches using traditional craft brewing methods. Straight Shooter is also naturally gluten free with zero carbs, zero sugar, and 90 calories per serving.\n\nThe new hard seltzer will be available in four flavors: Wild Cherry, Lemonade, Mango, and Grapefruit & Lime and will be available in a variety pack 12-pack cans, Lemonade 6-pack cans, and Wild Cherry 6-pack cans. It will launch with retailers at the end of August and will be initially distributed in Texas.\n\nAbout Shiner and the Spoetzl Brewery"
