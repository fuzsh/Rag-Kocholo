Growing demand for the 106-year-old Texas beer was the driving force behind the 18,958-square-foot expansion. Upon completion, the brewery building size increased to 33,331 square feet which allowed the brewery to double its production. 5F utilized it’s BIM process to design-assist and coordinate thousands of feet of stainless steel process piping requiring both TIG and orbital welding applications. Below-grade plumbing utilities were required to be stainless steel as well to meet FDA food-grade compliance regulations."
