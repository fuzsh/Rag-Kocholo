Test Hill IPA and Screeching Sands are perfect refreshments after cruising across the dunes of Lake Michigan. While a pint of Fleming’s Field Cider or Electric Hart Belgian Brown will inspire conversation of local life. BHBC has bloomed from a family labor of love into a pillar of the community producing tasty beers you surely do not want to miss.\n\nCreston Brewery\n\nCreston Brewery opened its doors in 2016, in the Creston Business District of Grand Rapids Michigan. Started by an eclectic group of individuals committed to working together to support their local community and delight people with their tasty brewed creations. Rooted in a commitment to creativity and the importance of the brewing process, you can expect a wide variety of aromatic, floral and spicy ales as well as complex sessionable beers from Creston. Besides becoming business owners in the Creston Business District, the co-founders have planted trees in neighborhood parks and played roles in volunteer opportunities with Friends of Grand Rapids Parks. The co-founders also have backgrounds and passion for music and want to create a space where patrons can dance and enjoy their neighbor’s company. “We hope to be a place where people feel comfortable and relaxed enough to be themselves while also experiencing something new. That may be a new brew, a new flavor of food, a new song, a funky piece of art on the wall, or just meeting someone they may otherwise would never have met. Our focus is small because even the smallest things matter.”\n\nNorth Channel Brewing Company\n\nNorth Channel Brewing is an ode to the fascinating history of it’s’ hometown. NBC attempts to weave Manistee’s story into everything that they do including paying homage to their hometown’s nautical and industrial beginnings with offerings including, Cap’n Piles Pilsner, Salt City Blonde and Drawbridge IPA. North Channel Brewing is located in the historic North Channel Building on Washington Avenue in Downtown Manistee. Situated right next to the Manistee River and the drawbridge, it’s the perfect setting to enjoy one of our many craft beers while taking in the views of Downtown Manistee, the bridge, and the occasional freighter passing through.\n\nReed City Brewing Company\n\n“Small Town, Big Beer”. Reed City Brewery offers style-defining favorites, experimental one-offs, and even customer requests. Never shying away from a challenge, one of our most popular beers was created as a result of a request on opening day. The PB Porter, a deliciously rich porter with a generous addition of peanuts, quickly became a customer favorite. We’ve earned our slogan - \"Small Town - Big Beer\" - with hits like our US 10.2 Imperial IPA and Dark Stranger Double Rye. As the name suggest, RCBC is located in the heart of downtown Reed City. This family owned and run business has quickly become a corner stone of their community and a destination for beer connoisseurs.\n\nIn the Community\n\nLudington Beverage is an active member of the West Michigan community."
