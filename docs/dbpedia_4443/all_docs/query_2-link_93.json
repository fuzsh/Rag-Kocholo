        "text": "Today was an interesting day. I ended up at a street festival in Pennsylvania and then drove back to New Jersey. I spent afternoon doing some things around the house and now I’m watching “Best In Smoke.” It makes me realize how much I love cooking. I seriously can’t wait to do ribs next weekend. It’s about 10 hours of prep and cooking, but it’s totally going to be worth it. Anyways, onto the brew for the night.\n\nABV: 4.4%\n\nStyle: Bock\n\nTrivia: According to wikipedia.com, “Shiner Bock — Spoetzl’s flagship beer. Bock has been brewed since 1913, almost as long as the Spoetzl Brewery has been in business. However, it wasn’t until a few decades ago that Shiner began producing Bock year-round. Bock was considered a lent beer, and therefore was only made around that season. Today 80% of the beer made at the Spoetzl Brewery is Bock.”\n\nRandom: This is a brew that I’ve heard a lot about, but I’m afraid it’s going to be a brew with a lot of hype and not much follow up.\n\nThe brew poured with a one finger pure white head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing on the glass. The body is a dark, clear, mahogany brown with some visible carbonation. On the nose, I got some breadiness and a hint of sweet malt. There was nothing that was overly impressive about it. The taste is, well, pretty boring. I got a hint of brown sugar and sweetness, but that was it. It was incredibly watery and just under-whelming. I can’t believe that New Jersey waited so long for this. The finish was quick and nothing was really notable about it. I was expecting big things from this beer, but it was just flat for me. I wouldn’t have this again.\n\nUntappd Rating: 3.0/5.0"
