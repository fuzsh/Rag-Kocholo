        "text": "Then, one night when Steve and I were having a planning session–doing spreadsheets, figuring out cash flow, that sort of stuff–I saw the word stone written on something and said, ‘Hey how about Stone Brewing?’ …Silence. Sweet silence.\n\nIt felt perfect. After all, he didn’t say no right away! But seriously, it stuck. It worked for our purposes. A stone is small. A stone is solid. A stone is natural. I think we liked it because it was so simple.\n\nOne-legend goes that Geddes, on a routine jaunt from here to there, was stopped by Jamaican Police (whose uniform, it must be noted, featured a red stripe running down the side) for a routine check. Just then, a voice rang out from the brew house, “Boss, we need a name for this ale?” Geddes paused, glanced at the officer, and without much in the way of deliberation decided on the brew’s name.\n\nStory#2 – a tale with every bit as much credence as the previous one, gives credit to Eugene Desnoes. Shortly after he and Geddes brewed their first batch of ale. Desnoes won a 10,000 pound prize in something called a “Green Stripe” Sweepstakes. History does not afford us into whether or not Desnoes was a superstitious man, but it does suggest he decided to keep his good luck rolling by naming his beer for the new benefactor.\n\nSo, one way of another, Red Stripe gained a name and business boomed.\n\nEberhard Anheuser, who left Germany in 1843 … eventually went on to own the largest soap and candle company in St. Louis. Although he had no brewing experience, he became part owner of the Bavarian Brewery, which had first opened its doors in 1852. By 1860, Anheuser had bought out the other investors and the brewery’s name was changed to E. Anheuser & Co.\n\nAdolphus Busch … began working as a clerk on the riverfront and by the time he was 21, he had a partnership in a brewing supply business. It was through this enterprise that Aldolphus Busch met Eberhard Anheuser, and soon Adolphus was introduced to Eberhard’s daughter, Lilly. In 1861, Adolphus Busch and Lilly Anheuser were married, and shortly after that, Adolphus went to work for his father-in-law. He later purchased half ownership in the brewery, becoming a partner."
