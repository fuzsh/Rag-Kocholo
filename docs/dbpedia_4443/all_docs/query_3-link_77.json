        "text": "Shiner Bock is a German-style Bock that’s brewed by the Spoetzl Brewery, and for the purposes of this craft beer review, the lager was served in a lager glass from a 12 oz. can.\n\nWhat You Need to Know\n\nFor over 100 years, the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, Texas, has been producing this award-winning lager. So how was it? Let’s get to the review.\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Shiner Bock pours a crystal clear amber hue and is topped by a thick cap of dense cream-colored foam that shows fair retention. The head’s reduction doesn’t leave behind any lace or residue.\n\nAroma\n\nThe aroma is predominantly malty with a scent of baked bread slightly sweetened with caramel.\n\nFlavor\n\nThe palate is led by a taste of baked bread that transitions through mildly sweet caramel to a modest bite of floral hops. Tangy sweet dark fruit rounds out the finish.\n\nMouthfeel\n\nThe feel is smooth with a body that hovers around medium and less-than-moderate carbonation.\n\nOverall\n\nThe head retention isn’t as strong as preferred but otherwise, the Shiner Bock presents well. The aroma isn’t particularly strong but it is pleasant. The feel is slightly thin for the style but otherwise meets expectations. The palate is simple but for what it is, it’s still quite good.\n\nOverall, the Shiner Bock is a fairly well made brew. Simple but well made. It certainly doesn’t wow and that’s part of the problem. When one comes across a beer of such fame and so many accolades, expectations run high. This beer has a lot to live up to. And whether it does or not is up to the individual. Regardless, the Shiner Bock is certainly worthy of recognition for its longevity and its place in brewing history."
