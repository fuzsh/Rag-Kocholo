        "text": "Shiner, TX – FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – In August 2023, USA TODAY 10Best named the Spoetzl Brewery the best brewery tour in Texas and the second-best brewery tour in the country by their panel of beer experts and reader votes. This top publication highlights the best of the best across categories including food and beverage, hotels, destinations and more. With a readership of over 50 million, this ranking provides significant recognition for the Spoetzl Brewery. To determine which breweries offer the best tour experiences, USA TODAY 10Best assembled a panel of beer experts including Ale Sharpton, a world-renowned beer authority and Amber Gibson, a nationally recognized freelance writer who contributes to Forbes, Conde Nast Traveller and more. Once the selection of top breweries was published online in August, readers of USA TODAY 10Best were asked to vote for their favorite. After weeks of voting, the public ultimately selected the Spoetzl Brewery as one of their favorite ten breweries in the country. This news comes on the heels of significant expansions to the Spoetzl tour experience including a fully revamped brewery experience with audio-visual and interactive components, the brand-new onsite BBQ restaurant with a breadth of food offerings, the introduction of craft spirits and a brand-new distillery with a tour and tastings open to the public. The distillery also has a menu of craft cocktails, each tailored to incorporate the local heritage and flavors. Bottles of spirits including gin, vodka and moonshine are also available for purchase exclusively from the hospitality room for at-home enjoyment. “We are thrilled that The Spoetzl Brewery tour experience was recognized as one of the best in the country in such a reputable publication,” says Nick Weiland, Shiner’s Director of Marketing. “We’re hopeful that this ranking will inspire those from all over the country to check out the world-class brewery tour, distillery tour and BBQ restaurant we have here in Shiner, Texas at the Spoetzl Brewery.” Tours of the Spoetzl Brewery and Distillery are available 7 days a week.
