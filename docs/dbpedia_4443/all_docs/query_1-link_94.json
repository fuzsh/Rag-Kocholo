        "text": "More Info ▸\n\nCaution: so good it WILL make you shit yourself!!!! The brown ale to end all brown ales. Enjoy it, because there is no longer any reason to drink another. You’ve reached the pinnacle. A healthy blend of traditional British malts give this popular style a semi-sweet, biscuity, slightly roasted flavor. Oats thicken the mouthfeel, and a handful of specialty malts add complex chocolate, toffee, and caramel notes. The hops are mostly traditional, earthy British hops, but we cocked it up a bit with some Cascade late in the boil just to show those snooty Brits that we don’t approve of that Constitutional Monarchy crap.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nThis is our unique version of an ancient style. A style as old as the ocean trade routes of the last centuries of Great Ships. Not as old as the equator they had to cross twice enroute, nor as old as the 10,000 miles or so of Di-Hydrogen Oxide and Sodium upon which they sailed, but older than the Circulithium-4 Lentoid that binds the Lupulin Quartnate onto your taste buds. Weird. IPA has loads of “C” Hops balanced on a bed of fine English Crystal, Caramel & Munich Malts. Designed to pair well with food and pretty much everything else!\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nThis slushee style sour is fermented with all of the blackberry greatness, over two tons of Fresh Pure Blackberry Puree were used to create this thick and smooth sour that hits all the fruit notes. Additions of lactose and vanilla give hints of sweetness like vanilla frosting and blueberry muffins to round out sour candy finish.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nThis slushee style sour is fermented with strong notes of mango and pink guava. These over the top tropical flavors give way to a thick and creamy sour that hits all the right notes. Additions of lactose and vanilla give hints of sweetness to round out this massive brew.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nThis beer is owned by PBR and contract brewed by Miller. Lone Star Beer uses the finest hops from the Pacific Northwest with hearty grains from the Central and Northern Plains. Malted barley and corn extract combine to provide Lone Star with nature's finest ingredients for brewing. Lone Star's ingredients give this beer its full natural flavor. The choicest hops lend complexity and aroma to this beer, and its proprietary mashing regimen creates the perfect balance of alcohol, body, and character.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nHeineken is a 5% ABV euro pale lager, made by Heineken International since 1873. It is available in a 4.3% alcohol by volume, in countries such as Ireland. It is the flagship product of the company and is made of purified water, malted barley, hops, and yeast. In 1886 H. Elion finished the development of the Heineken A-yeast. This is the yeast that is still used for the beer. The beer is force carbonated. It is popular in the United States, Europe and Middle Eastern countries.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nThe Haze of Destiny has been awakened! A big, bold Imperial Hazy IPA, 4 Giants and The Haze Of Destiny is smoothed out by copious amounts of oats and wheat to create an inviting yet mysterious haze – don’t let it fool you, this behemoth of a beer is not to be handled lightly. Fulfill your destiny with 4 Giants Imperial Hazy IPA!\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nThere can be no light without dark, there can be no good without evil and there can be no Ying without Yang. You've spent your whole life drinking the Ying of beers, now grab our Yang and experience the dark side of pils. We brewed this smooth lager using dark malts to provide a balancing bitterness that will make your taste buds go bump in the night. Our brewers actually brewed it in complete darkness, with blindfolds! Don't believe me? Check out the lawsuits! Seriously though, one sip and you'll get tunnel vision for this beautiful black lager. Stay away from the light!\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nSwirling clouds tumble as the storm begins to calm. Settle. Breathe in the moment, then break through the smooth, light head to the bittersweet reward. Unmistakeably GUINNESS, from the first velvet sip to the last, lingering drop. And every deep-dark satisfying mouthful in between. Pure beauty. Pure GUINNESS. Guinness Draught is sold in kegs, widget cans, and bottles. The ABV varies from 4.1 to 4.3%. Guinness Extra Cold is the exact same beer only served through a super cooler at 3.5 °C\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nA portion of the proceeds from Miss Major will be benefiting Transform Cincy. Transform's mission is to provide free wardrobes, head to toe, for transgender and gender non-conforming youth. This pink-hued beer opens with a bright strawberry aroma with hints of lemon. Initial flavor is more strawberry with a crisp lemon flavor rounding the beer out. Finishes clean with a pleasant tartness.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nTaste rides an unexpected wave. Refreshing sweet tart flavor alive with the inspired pairing of apple and screaming yellow pineapple. Big citrus taste born of a feeling the wave will never go flat. You close your eyes at the peak moment a tremendous feeling rushes over you. It's wild. Ride it out.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nBrewed with 100% Centennial hops from the Pacific Northwest and named after the Two Hearted River in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, this IPA is bursting with hop aromas ranging from pine to grapefruit from massive hop additions in both the kettle and the fermenter. Perfectly balanced with a malt backbone and combined with the signature fruity aromas of Bell's house yeast, this beer is remarkably drinkable and well suited for adventures everywhere.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nKentucky Tangerine Cream Ale has a refreshing white head with a slight hop body with a luxurious mouthfeel. Moderate balance of maltiness and pleasantly sweet with notes of both vanilla and tangerine coming through clearly without being overpowering, allowing the vanilla and tangerine to shine.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nDeep in the jungles of Papua New Guinea and Madagascar grows the perfect ingredient for an extraordinary Porter brewed in Colorado. Breckenridge Brewery’s Vanilla Porter. An ale that has all the chocolate and roasted nut flavor of a classic Porter, with an enigmatic surprise thrown in for good measure.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nThis traditional German wheat beer is brewed after an old German law that requires at least 50% of the grains to be malted wheat. Our style of wheat beer is made with 55% wheat and a famous German yeast strain which produces a strong banana and subtle clove flavor. The high wheat content and yeast also contributes to the cloudy yet light gold appearance. This type of beer is favored during the summertime but is brewed year-round at Blue Stallion Brewing Co.\n\nLess Info ▴\n\nMore Info ▸\n\nAward-winning Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale® is a unique sipping beer with the distinctive nose of well-crafted bourbon. Aged for up to six weeks in freshly decanted bourbon barrels from some of Kentucky’s finest distilleries, subtle yet familiar flavors of vanilla and oak are imparted to this special ale as it rests in the charred barrels. Pleasantly smooth and robust, it may also be served as an aperitif or after-dinner drink. Launched in 2006, it has grown to become the flagship beer of the premier name in barrel-aged beers: Alltech Lexington Brewing & Distilling Company. PAIRING SUGGESTIONS — Rich spicy foods like barbecued beef, Oaxacan mole, or hearty Szechuan dishes. Great with buttery, well-aged cheddar. Pairs with desserts like milk chocolate, cream puffs; try it as a float with vanilla or caramel ice cream. Hops: Fuggles, East Kent Goldings Malts: 2 Row Pale, Caramel 40, Aromatic Malt, Carapils, Malted Wheat Tasting Notes: Oak, Vanilla, Caramel, Toffee\n\nLess Info ▴"
