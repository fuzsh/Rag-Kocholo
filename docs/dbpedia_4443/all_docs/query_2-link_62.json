        "text": "Texas has been a steady presence inside the top ten most checked-in states in the United States for years. Dating back to the start of 2019, the Lone Star State ranks number six of the most checked-in states with 14,514,950 check-ins, taken at 128,937 venues with an average 3.84 rating.\n\nOnly Pennsylvania, California, New York, Illinois, and Ohio have checked in more over that span. If we narrow that down to just the past 365 days, Texas slides two spots to number eight of the most checked-in states, with North Carolina and Florida leapfrogging to six and seven, respectively. The other states remained the same, with Ohio and Illinois flip-flopping in the top five.\n\nTexas had 2,011,780 check-ins in the past year, down 392,048 from the previous year.\n\nDespite the drop in overall check-ins in 2023, Texas has remained the seventh-most checked-in state in the last ninety days, jumping North Carolina, with nearly half a million check-ins (475,714).\n\nThe bulk of check-ins happened in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area (175,693 check-ins), followed by Houston (111,136), Austin (79,509), and San Antonio (50,939), with virtually the same number taking place on and off-premise.\n\nAll data points to Texas as a state home to consistent, steady craft beer consumers. Everything is undoubtedly bigger in Texas, so let’s peel the onion back a little to see the most popular beers over the past three months.\n\nWhile IPAs dominated most check-in charts, the Texas check-ins aren’t entirely as lopsided. IPAs hold the second through fourth spots, as well as numbers seven and nine, for five total spots on the top ten most checked-in beers over the past ninety days.\n\nThe ever-popular Texas beer Shiner Bock was the most checked-in, with the state’s iconic Electric Jellyfish from Pinthouse slotting in at number two. Since we just celebrated the holidays, two seasonal beers also landed in the top ten—at five and eight, respectively. And a couple of light beers—American lager and kölsch-style—rounded out the top ten.\n\nShiner Bock (Bock-Single/Traditional) – Spoetzl Brewery\n\nElectric Jellyfish (New England/Hazy IPA) – Pinthouse Brewing\n\nHopadillo IPA (American IPA) – Karbach Brewing Co.\n\nYellow Rose (American IPA) – Lone Pint Brewery\n\nChristmas Ale (Old/Stock Ale) – Saint Arnold Brewing Co.\n\nOriginal (Lager-American) – Lone Star Brewing Co.\n\nArt Car IPA (American IPA) – Saint Arnold Brewing Co.\n\nShiner Holiday Cheer (Wheat Beer-Dunkelweizen) – Spoetzl Brewery\n\nHalf-Life (New England/Hazy IPA) – Manhattan Project Beer\n\nLove Street (Kolsch-Style Light Beer) – Karbach Brewing Co."
