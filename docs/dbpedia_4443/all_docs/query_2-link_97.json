        "text": "(Shiner, TX) – The Spoetzl Brewery, the country’s fourth largest craft brewer and maker of the legendary Shiner Bock, will begin distribution in New Jersey April 1. The first public appearance will be at the 2011 Atlantic City Beer Festival, with distribution to retailers and on-premise locations across the state beginning the same week.\n\nShiner will be represented by five leading beer distributors in the state: Hub City Distributing Co. in Lawrenceville, Kohler Distributing Co. in Hawthorne, Kramer Beverage Company in Hammonton, Peerless Beverage Co. in Union and Shore Point Distributing in Freehold.\n\nThe people of Shiner are very excited to see their beer in New Jersey. Shiner has been produced since 1909 in the small Texas town (population 2,070) of the same name. Every drop of Shiner beer is still brewed in the town by only 66 brewery workers.\n\nThe brewery gets its name from Kosmos Spoetzl, the Bavarian-born and trained brewmaster who was brought to Shiner by the German and Czech immigrants who settled the town and missed the beer they had left behind in their home countries.\n\n“We’re an independent brand with an obsession for quality and a love of our craft; it’s been that way ever since the brewery opened 102 years ago” said Jimmy Mauric, Brewmaster for Spoetzl. “We’re proud to now be in New Jersey.”\n\nShiner is known for crafting beers true to the brewery’s German and Czech roots but also for creating new brews combining that heritage with innovative twists.\n\nThe first Shiner beers in New Jersey will be Shiner Bock, one of the top selling craft beers in the country and the brewery’s flagship brand, first brewed in 1917 and Shiner 102, a unique double wheat beer that is this year’s special anniversary beer. Also available will be the Family Reunion – a variety pack featuring six different Shiner beers. Other varieties and seasonals will follow.\n\nSOURCE: Spoetzl Brewery"
