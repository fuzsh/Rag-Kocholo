        "text": "Kosmos Spoetzl first sold his ice-cold bock beer from the back of a Model T to sunbaked farmers in San Antonio. That was roughly 92 years ago.\n\nToday, the Texas brewery that bears his name can barely keep up with the demand for Shiner Bock, although the recipe no doubt has been adjusted to satisfy modern tastes.\n\nBased on a Bavarian recipe that Spoetzl, a German immigrant, introduced to the American West, Shiner Bock is lighter in body and taste than bock beers from Germany. It's also weaker (something that Texans might not want to own up to), coming in at 4.3 percent alcohol by volume. German bocks begin at 6 percent.\n\nTypically, bocks are dark, malt-heavy lagers made in the fall and stored, or lagered, until early spring, to be consumed before the weather heats up.\n\nShiner Bock goes easier on the malt, so it's not as dark, and doesn't have the rich, caramel notes of the German variety. It's also a bit watery for a bock, but it is better suited to hot weather.\n\nSpoetzl brewery also uses corn, an ingredient forbidden by German standards.\n\nYet Shiner Bock is easily the flagship beer of the brewery, which claims it's the top-selling specialty beer in Texas, and No. 4 nationally.\n\nEric Pera can be reached at 802-7528 or eric.pera@theledger.com."
