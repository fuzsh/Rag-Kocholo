        "text": "Spoetzl Brewery brings home a gold medal for its iconic Shiner Bock at Europe’s premier beer competition in Germany.\n\nShiner, TX (November 13, 2020) – An international panel of brewing experts honored the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, Texas today as its iconic Shiner Bock was awarded a gold medal in the Session Beer category at the European Beer Star 2020 competition in Nuremberg, Germany.\n\n“We are very proud of our flagship Shiner Bock, so to receive this gold medal for it from one of the largest and most competitive beer competitions in the world is incredibly gratifying,” said Shiner Brewmaster, Jimmy Mauric. “Winning gold in the Session Beer category is a testament to just how well Shiner Bock balances its rich flavor with being refreshing and easy-drinking.”\n\nMore than 2,000 beers from over 40 different countries competed at the European Beer Star as a 72-member panel of master brewers, beer sommeliers, and beer connoisseurs from around the world took part in a two-and-a-half-day blind tasting. For Stefan Stang, Managing Director of the Bavarian private brewers’ association Private Brauereien Bayern, this is one of the reasons why the Beer Star competition has such a strong worldwide reputation.\n\n“The phenomenal rise of our competition shows how important artisanal brewing has become and the great variety of beers being produced. We are proud that we managed to organize such a high-quality competition in these turbulent times”, Stang said, in commenting on the goals behind this year’s competition.\n\nThis gold medal marks the second European Beer Star gold medal win for Shiner Bock and it is the 19th major award overall in international competition for Shiner Bock since the year 2000.\n\nAbout Shiner and the Spoetzl Brewery\n\nThe Spoetzl Brewery was founded in Shiner, Texas (population 2,069), in 1909, by Czech and German immigrants brewing beer with old-world traditions and recipes for Central Texas. Since then, the brewery has grown to be one of the largest independent craft brewers in the country with beers available in all 50 states and Mexico. To this day, every drop of the award-winning beer is brewed right in Shiner, TX, where it all started 111 years ago.
