        "text": "Press Release:\n\n(Philadelphia, PA) – You’ve probably tasted Shiner Bock and the rest of the brewery’s beers while traveling out west. It’s practically the official state beer of Texas. You wished you could enjoy them at home in Philadelphia, and now you can. Origlio Beverage, a wholesale distribution company of fine beers, ciders and malt based beverages located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, proudly announces its partnership with the Spoetzl Brewery for the distribution of the entire Shiner portfolio. The beers will be available in the metro Philadelphia marketplace on the 8th of May.\n\nCraft beer is all about genuine authenticity. And it doesn’t get anymore authentic than the beers coming out of the Spoetzl Brewery of Shiner, Texas. The brewery celebrated its 100th anniversary about four years ago and it’s the oldest independent brewery in the Lone Star State. The brewery’s flagship brand, Shiner Bock, is a smooth-drinking dark lager with a fine malty backbone. Since the 1980s, this beer has developed a fan base all its own that has grown well beyond Texas. This beer and the others in the Spoetzl portfolio are brewed in the German-Czech tradition. One of the original brewmasters from the early 1900s, a German immigrant named Kosmos Spoetzl, was trained in Bavaria and he set the bar for craftsmanship very high. The brewery’s beers have received many awards no doubt by sticking with Spoetzl’s authentic brewing methods.\n\nOriglio’s Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Grant Barrett, is excited about representing Shiner. “Philadelphia is an established craft brew town and our customers know a great beer when they taste it.” Shiner offers an interesting variety pack called Family Reunion. This six-pack contains the Bock, Shiner Bohemian Black Lager, Shiner Blonde, Shiner Hefeweizen, Shiner Brewer’s Pride (a limited edition rotating selection) and Shiner Kosmos Reserve, a hop-jacked lager that’s a real tribute to the founding brewer. Two of the brands, Shiner Bock and Bohemian Black Lager, received gold medals at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival. Barrett added, “Shiner also has a summer seasonal called Ruby Red Bird that blends craftsmanship with some Texas terroir. It’s brewed with Texas Rio Red grapefruit which makes it refreshingly tart. And it gets a touch of heat from natural ginger. These brands are a really nice addition to our lineup.”\n\nShiner’s beers are a taste of Texas grounded in old-world, Bavarian tradition. The Spoetzl Brewery is passionate about beer and there’s a taste of Lone Star independence in every drop."
