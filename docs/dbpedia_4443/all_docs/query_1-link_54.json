        "text": "The Craft Beer Bar In Your Neighborhood\n\nWe’re serving up more than All-American burgers. Pair gourmet burgers with craft beer from local brewers, regional brewers and international brewers. We pride ourselves on the immense number of brews we keep on tap: at each of our locations, you’ll find upwards of 40, 50 and even 60 craft beers on tap!\n\nWhat’s your favorite craft beer? Our favorites come from California, Colorado, Wisconsin, Indiana, Delaware, Michigan, Texas, Illinois, Oregon, Kentucky, Ohio, Louisiana…We could go on, but then we’d be listing just about every state. The fact is, there’s too many craft beers out there to name only one favorite! And let’s not forget our international favorites, from far-flung places like Canada, Ireland and Germany.\n\nMany of the ever-changing beers on our taps are limited release and one-off specialty brews that you won’t find anywhere else. We rotate beers frequently, which means you’ll need to hurry back to Mr Brews Taphouse and try out the new brews on tap this week.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Go on and find the Mr Brews Taphouse craft beer bar in your neighborhood! Because craft beer is the best friend of craft burgers!"
