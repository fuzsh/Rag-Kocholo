Spoetzl Brewery, one of the oldest independent breweries in the US, is the shining star of Texas. The brewery was founded in 1909 by German and Czech immigrants who settled in Texas and decided to brew their own delicious beers. Spoetzl, a German immigrant brewmaster, produced many fine beers for the brewery, but his iconic brew, the Shiner Bock, is the best-known of the lot. Over the years, Spoetzl’s tasty brew has become the brewery’s signature drink with a loyal fan base that stretches across the whole of America.
