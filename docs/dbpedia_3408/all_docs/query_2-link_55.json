        "text": "OPW, a Dover Company and a global leader in fluid-handling solutions announced that Dover Corporation has completed the acquisition of Tokheim Group S.A.S.’s dispenser and systems businesses and they are now part of OPW. Tokheim is a leading manufacturer of fuel dispensers, retail automation systems and payment solutions. With a presence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, South America and Asia-Pacific, Tokheim is one of the most recognized brands in the retail fuelling industry.\n\n“Both Tokheim and OPW have been leaders in the retail fuelling industry for more than a century,” said David Crouse, OPW President. “By integrating Tokheim’s advanced line of dispensers and automation systems, the combined business will be able to offer our customers an unparalleled end-to-end fuelling solution.” Tokheim is the fifth major acquisition for OPW in the past two-and-a-half years, and matches previous acquisitions (Fibrelite, KPS, Jump, Liquip) of category-leading brands outside the North American market."
