        "text": "Leading fluid-handling equipment manufacturer OPW has completed the acquisition of Tokheim Group's dispenser and systems businesses after announcing the agreement on September 2015.\n\nAccording to Reuters, OPW, a business unit of Dover Company, acquired the two Tokheim departments (dispenser and systems) for a purchase price of 425 million Euros ($465 million).\n\nWith this deal OPW closes its fifth major acquisition in the past two-and-a-half years after purchasing four major brands outside the North American market (Fibrelite, KPS, Jump, Liquip).\n\n\"Both Tokheim and OPW have been leaders in the retail fueling industry for more than a century,\" said David Crouse, OPW President. \"By integrating Tokheim's advanced line of dispensers and automation systems, the combined business will be able to offer our customers an unparalleled end-to-end fueling solution.”\n\nTokheim is a leading manufacturer of fuel dispensers, retail automation systems and payment solutions. With a presence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, South America and Asia-Pacific, Tokheim is one of the most recognized brands in the retail fueling industry.\n\n“Our main aim has always been to deliver innovative and high quality products and solutions and we look forward to continuously providing our customers with the best offering and experience available in the worldwide retail petroleum market,” said Bill Arundel, Tokheim Group Sales & Marketing Director.\n\nThrough this new acquisition OPW has extended its product portfolio and can now provide almost all the equipment necessary (under and above ground) for a gas station, said the company in a release.\n\n\"Our combined product portfolio now comprises the industry’s broadest product offering, enabling us to bring a more complete solution to our customers.” said Keith Moye, OPW VP of Global Marketing.\n\nFor more information, please go to: http://www.opwglobal.com/opw-retail-fueling/tokheim-microsite\n\nRelated contents\n\nDiscuss"
