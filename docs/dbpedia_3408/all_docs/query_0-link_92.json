        "text": "A large extension and new 400 space car park to an existing manufacturing plant was required by Our client. Fairhurst was appointed as the lead consultant to undertake a feasibility assessment, which indicated the proposals were constrained but feasible. From initial design (without planning) to completion of construction, the total programme was 12 months.\n\nAdvice on land acquisition, flooding, traffic and transportation, and environmental, civil, and structural engineering disciplines were all fully coordinated with a full-time project leader responsible for delivery of all disciplines and all sub-consultants (during feasibility)\n\nThe project was fully compliant with BIM level 2 (REVIT). A fully coordinated model with Architect, Civil, Structural and M&E disciplines was utilised and maintained through the design phase\n\nAll engineering was fully designed in accordance with Eurocode and the specification was provided as full NBS\n\nThe project required delivery in an exceptionally short timescale, on a site with exceptionally poor ground conditions, constrained by existing large diameter sewers in an area synonymous with flooding on a brownfield contaminated site which, partially was not under the ownership of the client at the time of design. The existing production facility was not to be interrupted by the activities of the construction."
