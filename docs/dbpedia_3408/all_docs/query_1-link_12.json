        "text": "FORT WAYNE, Ind. -- Tokheim Corp. said Friday it will move the company's assembly plant in Newbern, Tenn., to Fort Wayne by late next summer.\n\nThe Fort Wayne plant currently is involved only in fabrication and machining.\n\nTokheim, whose main product is gasoline service station pumps, said it will expand the Fort Wayne facilities to make room for the assembly operation, whilethe Newbern plant will be offered for sale.\n\nCurrently 308 employees work at the Newbern plant. Severance and outplacement programs will be made available to those employees completing their job assignments and not relocating to Fort Wayne or another position within the company.\n\nTokhein said the Fort Wayne factory employees, represented by the United Auto Workers, recently ratified a contract bringing their labor costs into a competitive position with those available elsewhere. The new contract was a primary consideration in the decision to relocate the Newbern operations to Fort Wayne.\n\nThe agreement extends to April 1997 and contains a no-strike provision until April 2000.\n\nDonald E. Rhodes, senior vice president of manufacturing for Tokheim, said: 'In addition to the efficiencies to be gained and cost reductions to be achieved, the plant consolidation will allow us to expand the 'work cell' concept to further increase productivity and improve quality while reducing the time necessary to respond to customer orders.'\n\nFourth-quarter net earnings will reflect a one-time, after-tax charge of approximating $1.1 million to $1.4 million, which will reduce earnings per share by 17 cents to 22 cents. The charge will cover estimated net costs and expenses directly associated with the plant closing.\n\nBut fiscal year 1991 net earnings are expected to be favorably impacted by approximately 15 cents to 18 cents a share, the company said. The full effect of the consolidation is expected to increase earnings by approximately 40 cents a share beginning in 1992.\n\nTokheim is principally engaged in the design and manufacture of electronic petroleum marketing and monitoring systems, including service station equipment, point-of-sale control systems and card-activated transaction systems."
