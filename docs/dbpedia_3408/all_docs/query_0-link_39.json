        "text": "A good set of fuel dispensers (or pumps), are the most important factor behind a service station’s success. For this reason fuel pumps are necessary to perform the most basic of transactions within a gas station. Though the methods of payment have evolved with consumer preferences, the mechanisms used to re-fuel vehicles remain relatively the same. There are 3 basic parts: the electronic interface, the pumping unit, and a nozzle. Generally, newer gas dispensers have pay at the pump capabilities. However, older models require customers to pay in store before refueling. Though there are various fuel dispenser and pump manufacturers across the world, there are three main ones in North America.\n\nGilbarco Veeder-Root\n\nGilbarco was founded in 1865 in North Carolina. They have a network of companies around the world and provide fuelling, EV, and C-store solutions for service stations and gas retailers across North America. Their mission is to provide solutions with the best integration and lowest ownership cost.\n\nWayne Fueling Systems\n\nFounded in 1891 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, Wayne is one of the leading fuel dispenser manufacturers in North America. They have acquired several companies to expand their product line to be better integrated and easy to use for their customers. They were one of the first fuel dispenser manufacturers to produce self-serve and pay at the pump dispensers.\n\nTokheim\n\nHeadquartered in Austin, Texas, Tokheim is one of the world’s leading fuel dispenser manufacturers. The company has been around since 1898 and has been producing full service and self-serve fuel dispensers ever since. They have a network of companies around the world for manufacturing, sourcing, and development."
