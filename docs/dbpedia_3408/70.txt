The Tokheim Group´s dispenser and systems businesses has been acquired by a leading fluid-handling equipment manufacturer.

OPW, a business unit of Dover Company, acquired the two Tokheim departments for €425 million, following initial agreement on September 2015.

The deal sees OPW close its fifth major acquisition in the past two-and-a-half years after purchasing four brands Fibrelite, KPS, Jump, and Liquip.
