        "text": "Read my full series on Vertical Development here: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3\n\nVertical Development is the way our meaning-making changes over time, allowing us to see more, do more, and become more.\n\nThis development happens through a progressive series of Mindset Stages. These Mindset Stages evolve what we value, how we see ourselves, how we interpret the world, and how much complexity we can handle.\n\nThink of yourself as a territory on a map, starting out in the center, then crossing boundaries into new terrain. As you evolve through each Mindset Stage, you get to explore more of yourself and access capacities that have previously been hidden within you.\n\nKeep reading for an overview of all the Mindset Stages, first at high level, then in more detail.\n\nEmerges at Birth\n\nOpen to mystery and magic\n\nGIFTS: Deeply connected to Life Source; Unity with other beings; Inherent sense of wholeness; Open to mystery and magic\n\nLIMITATIONS: Unaware of individuality; Rational thinking is out of scope\n\nFor Example: A wide-eyed babe, completely dependent on mama and taking in the wonder of it all.\n\nUsually emerges in Toddlerhood\n\nAsserts self to get needs and wants fulfilled\n\nGifts: Aware of individuality and own needs; Acts on survival instinct to protect self\n\nLimitations: Feels less whole and connected; Focused on threats; Can be selfish\n\nFor Example: That wide-eyed babe is now a red-faced tike screaming, “NO!” and “MINE!”\n\nUsually emerges in Childhood\n\nSeeks to fit in and belong\n\nGifts: Values group cooperation and belonging, complies with behavioral expectations\n\nLimitations: Out of touch with own unique point of view; Follows rather than leads\n\nFor Example: Your school-aged niece wears horrendous “mom jeans” because apparently those are cool now?!?\n\nMay emerge in Teens or Adulthood\n\nFollows the playbook, but makes a unique contribution\n\nGifts: Pursues individual mastery to contribute to goals of a group important to them; Committed to doing things the “right way” according to some authority or best practice\n\nLimitations: Tends to see things in black and white; Unlikely to innovate or rewrite the rules\n\nFor Example: An early-career hire or seasoned team player who is eager to learn and get it right.\n\nMay emerge in Adulthood\n\nCreates their own goals to pursue success within their context\n\nGifts: Creates, pursues, and executes own goals; Can rally others to achieve results\n\nLimitations: Focus on success and individual achievement may prevent them from challenging status quo and connecting to deeper purpose; Risk of over-work\n\nFor Example: A leader or strong individual contributor intent on knocking it out of the park.\n\nMay emerge in Adulthood\n\nSeeks meaning and fulfillment, questions identity and status quo\n\nGifts: Redefines success to pursue meaning and fulfillment over achievement; Questions the status quo; Can deal with abstractions and seemingly opposing viewpoints\n\nLimitations: Can be overly absorbed by questions and less focused on action; May feel “lost” sometimes\n\nFor Example: A previously energetic high performer wonders if they’re burning out or having a mid-life crisis.\n\nRare; may emerge in mid-to-late Adulthood\n\nTransforms systems to serve the greater good\n\nGifts: Significant release of ego and self-absorption; Serves the bigger picture; Navigates complexity; Transforms complex systems\n\nLimitations: Can seem high-minded and out-of-touch to others – must tailor communication to help others act on their vision; Risk of arrogance\n\nFor Example: A wise leader who inspires others connect to the deeper “why”, and who seems unrattled by the usual corporate dramas.\n\nExtremely rare; may emerge in mid-to-late Adulthood\n\nAware that “reality is an illusion”, lives in a state of flow\n\nGifts: Deeply connected to all life; Fully surrendered to “being” instead of “doing”; Serves the diverse whole of humanity in an “elder” role\n\nLimitations: Difficult to relate to and understand; Loneliness resulting from having few peers\n\nFor Example: Ghandi, Jesus, Buddha…. Probably not you. ;)"
