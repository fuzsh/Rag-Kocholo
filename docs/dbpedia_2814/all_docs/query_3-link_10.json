        "text": "I have an independent sense of self.\n\nI have clarity about who I am, what I think, what I want and why.\n\nI am ‚Äúself-authored‚Äù: I choose my own principles, projects, and commitments.I don‚Äôt look for external validation to derive my sense of self.\n\nI understand that others choose their own principles, projects, and commitments. They have experiences that are not my experiences.\n\nI am no longer in relationships that define me; I have relationships.\n\nI am no longer a stream of transient emotional experiences; I have experiences.\n\nI can take responsibility for my own inner states and emotions.\n\nI am referential to a system that treats people impartially, based on rights, responsibilities, principles, and procedures.\n\nI can prioritise the roles I have.\n\nI recognise that my responsibility for a particular role has particular limits; and I can enter and exit roles by choice.\n\nMy personal systems honour certain boundaries and distinctions.\n\nWhen there is a conflict between important ideologies, institutions, or people, I don‚Äôt have a hard time answering the question: what do I want?\n\nI understand that I am a person, with thoughts, feelings and beliefs that are independent from the standards and expectations of my environment.\n\nI generate my understanding of the world and am not unduly shaped by the context in which I find myself.\n\nI realise that I am always changing, that who I am is something that I can still negotiate.\n\nI can distinguish the opinions of others from my own opinions to formulate my own ‚Äúseat of judgment‚Äù.\n\nI have developed an internal sense of direction and the capacity to create and follow my own course.\n\nI do not get my thoughts, beliefs, morals (what I know to be true) from external sources.\n\nI can question expectations and values, take stands, set limits, and solve problems with independent frames of mind.\n\nI take the time to state and explain my beliefs and thoughts.\n\nI don‚Äôt do things because I feel guilty or ‚Äòbad‚Äô - I do them because they align with the person I want to be.\n\nI have shifted my energy from worrying about what other people think, to clearly determining what I think.\n\nI don‚Äôt spend too much energy trying to avoid hurting other people‚Äôs‚Äô feelings.\n\nI am not oblivious to or ignorant of others‚Äô experiences. But I am not flooded by them, and can evaluate whether or not to respond to them, and how best to do so.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm no longer focused on others‚Äô expectations or societal roles.\n\nWhat I think, believe, and feel is not dependent on how I think others experience me.\n\nI generate my own understanding of the world and am not unduly shaped by the context in which I find myself.\n\nI operate from the place of ‚Äúwhat do I want‚Äù versus ‚Äúwhat do other people want from me‚Äù.\n\n1. I clarify what I want to myself.\n\n2. I clarify what I want to the other person (they can decide if they can give me this or not) and\n\n3. I decide what I‚Äôm willing to live with."
