She explains she is focused on finishing nursing school, so she can provide for her family. Patient falls under Identity vs Role Confusion in Erikson Stages of Development as she has transitioned into young adulthood and has begun to carry more responsibilities. S.S. did not what to elaborate on her previous marriage but insist she doesn’t feel the need to isolate herself or dwell on the past as the love from her daughters drive her to do and be better.\n\nWe are now living in an ageing society and so health and social care will play a part throughout our life course in one way or another. I shall start the main body of my assignment by providing an explanation of what is meant by the life course. I will then move onto my experiences of adulthood and of using health and social care services, showing as I go how block 1 has helped me to critically reflect upon these and the outcome. Critically reflection means that I will analyse, challenge and question within this assignment. I will also show the different\n\nGrowing up, I was extremely fortunate to have a parent who embodied all of the characteristics listed in Carol Stuart’s “Foundations of Child and Youth Care” including passion, caring, space and time, and social competence. My mother has always been my main role model, caregiver, friend, and always treated me with the upmost respect and patience, and together we built a relationship based on trust and mutual appreciation. We would often go on long walks together, using this as a therapeutic milieu for storytelling and the cultivation of unbiased advice. For me, it was important to analyze the world outside of my own head and share in the mutual struggles of daily life with someone who understood or, at the very least listened, as I analyzed, experienced, and complained about the world. For the better part of my life, I did not see this as therapeutic or its relation to child and youth work, rather assuming all parents were capable of , and expressed, this kind of love to some degree. However, it was only by watching my friends wrestle with issues such as depression, anxiety, and body image that I realized the isolation and loneliness that can easily overcome a person without a proper role model or guidance and more importantly, that this presence is not guaranteed in everyone’s life. Through experiences with my friends and mother, I am familiar with being on either side of a therapeutic situation, acknowledged the vital role of it in personal development and decided to\n\nIn the early 20th-century, interest in the field of child development emerged. Researchers and theorists studied the ways in which children grew, learned, and, in some instances, were shaped by societal influences (Weiland, 1993). The study of child development enables us to appreciate and understand the social, emotional, physical, educational, and cognitive growth that children go through from birth to early adulthood. Grand theories attempt to organize and arrange concepts and aspects of development using a step approach. Such as that of Erik Erikson’s theory, the Psychosocial Identity Development theory, in which he addresses the development of personal, emotional, and social progression in an individual through stages (Pretorius et al., 2015). Erikson’s model for the approach of development involves the focus of overcoming conflicts that individuals encounter over the span of their childhood that influence their ego identity, or the conscious sense of self that develops and constantly changes due to new experiences and information that is acquired through daily interactions with others and events. In Erikson’s theory, he believed that each person experienced a conflict that served as a defining moment in their development that essentially shaped who they would become later on in life; he believed that unresolved problems of adult life echoed unresolved conflicts of one’s childhood (Berger, 2011).\n\nAccording to cultural anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor, culture is a “complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.” In other words, culture is a concept that social organizations practice in order to explain certain phenomena in nature whether through mythology, rituals, art, music, and language. However, as explained by Ethan Watters in “The Mega Marketing of Depression in Japan,” culture is not permanent, since it has the ability, and more than ever in the present society, to “move across boundaries of race, culture, class, and nation” (Watters 519). In addition, as demonstrated by Oliver Sacks in the articled called “The Mind’s Eye: What the Blind See,” it is a mistake to think that individuals are bound to behave in a way that culture told them to behave. Instead, individuals are free to create his or her own unique experience of interpreting the world. We might consider the “reality” that we live in to be fiction to the extent that we are willing to use different faculties and analyze what we are witnessing; this gives us the power, as individuals, to think and search for each of us’s unique interpretation of reality. .\n\nEric Erikson was one of the most famous theorists of the twentieth century; he created many theories. One of the most talked about theories is his theory of psychosocial development. This is a theory that describes stages in which an individual should pass as they are going through life. His theory includes nine stages all together. The original theory only included eight stages but Erikson‘s wife found a ninth stage and published it after his death. The nine stages include: trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame and doubt, initiative vs. guilt, industry vs. inferiority, identity vs. identity confusion, intimacy vs. isolation, generativity vs. stagnation, integrity vs. despair, and hope and faith vs. despair (Crandell and Crandell,\n\nI chose the Parse Theory of Human becoming because I feel that this theory gives the patient strength, complexity and a strong internal locus. A person is free to choose their own meaning in a situation and interpret the meaning as freely as desired. This theory relates to the professional nursing practice because it allows the nurse to see the patient as a whole; spiritually, biologically, sociologically, and psychologically.(Taylor & Canney, 2011) As nurses, we perform a holistic assessment and provide care to the patient’s idea of health and wellness; a person is more than just the sum of their parts.\n\nHuman development is a process that starts right from childhood to adulthood. Individuals’ success and life satisfaction depends on what they develop in the society from their childhood period. This is a topic that has always drawn the attention of many scholars and theorists who try to explain what development entails through various stages of life. This paper provides an analysis of various relevant theories and research that focus on the developmental changes that take place in early, middle, and late adulthood. It focuses on Schaie’s stage of achieving, and Erikson’s theory on intimacy, generativity, and identity development. It also explores life satisfaction in middle adulthood, and lastly, the common illnesses of the elderly.\n\nErik Erikson is known for his psychoanalytic theory of psychosocial development comprising eight stages from infancy to adulthood. Psychologist Erik Erikson, is a major contributor to developmental psychology, who proposed a comprehensive theory of the ways that individuals develop their identity, a sense of who they are, and society's influence on that development. Erikson stated that people go through crisis at each stage of their lives. The stages each had a developmental task to be mastered. As an individual resolved these various crises an individual would have a better harmony with their social environment that they live in. If an individual could not successfully resolve a crisis, they would be” out of step”, and the individual would have a greater difficulty in their dealing with a crisis in the future. Erikson did however recognize that an individual can develop through a stage negatively and still go on with their life. Erikson stated that each of the psychological stages have a basic conflict and important event leading to growth. The theory was developed from his hundreds of clinical observations in children."
