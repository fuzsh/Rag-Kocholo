        "text": "Robert D. McMahan\n\nSeptember 15, 1950 – November 30, 2022\n\nRobert D. McMahan, 72, died on November 30, 2022, surrounded by family and loved ones. Bob was born on September 15, 1950 in Vincennes, Indiana to Dr. Virgil “Mac” McMahan and J. Kathleen “Katy” (Potts) McMahan. He graduated from Vincennes Lincoln High School, Class of 1968, attended Vincennes University and transferred to Indiana University to obtain his B.A. in Criminology in 1972. He subsequently obtained his M.B.A. from Indiana State University in 1984 and his J.D. from Indiana University School of Law – Indianapolis in 1987.\n\nBob lived a vast life full of experience and adventure.\n\nHis careers spanned from interning in the white-collar crime unit with the FBI to a five-star hotel manager to college professor and attorney. He began his law career in 1987 with Wolfe, Frey, Hunt & Olah. In 1992, he opened his private law practice, focusing on Taxes, Trusts, Wills, Estate Planning, Probate, Asset Preservation, Commercial and Business Transactions and other matters relating to individual and business financial affairs. Bob would often say “everything is numbers”, and he had a knack for analyzing those numbers.\n\nBob was admitted to practice law in the Northern District of Indiana U.S. District Court in 1987, the Southern District of Indiana U.S. District Court in 1987, and the U.S. Tax Court in 1997.\n\nBob retired as a member of the faculty of Indiana State University, Scott School of Business, where he taught Business Law for thirty years. As a professor, he was known for his dry sense of humor and real-life experience. He taught thousands of students and was unforgettable. It was commonplace for former students to recognize him and holler out “Dr. McMahan”, whether it be at a restaurant, in a hospital, or on a vacation.\n\nBob co-hosted a weekly radio program entitled Money, Law & Solutions for many years, along with Gerald Dix. Their banter back and forth, along with Bob’s dry sense of humor and colorful opinions earned him many fans.\n\nBob was a Mason and belonged to the Social Lodge #86 in Terre Haute. He was also a member of Zorah Shrine Temple of Terre Haute.\n\nBob was a member of the Columbia Club in Indianapolis since 1994, where he enjoyed showing family and friends the finer side to dining. Many of our fondest memories with Bob started with a toast to the evening and were capped off with cigars at a nearby speakeasy.\n\nBob was the go-to person for any question, which earned him the name “Bobble”. When you needed to know something, you didn’t google it, you Bobble it. Despite his vast knowledge, Bob never made a soul feel inferior to him.\n\nBob was a world traveler and adventure seeker. As a child, his family traveled to Minnesota for vacation, where his love of water began. He enjoyed sailing in the Baltic, scuba diving in the Caribbean, and fishing trips with buddies in Minnesota. In summer 2022, he and his sister, Mary, rekindled childhood memories by traveling back to Minnesota for a camping and fishing adventure. His worldly vacations also included many European cruises and travels to China and Japan.\n\nBob is survived by his sister, Mary McMahan (spouse, Ed Lyon), brother Daniel McMahan, daughter Amber Sampson (spouse, Casey), daughter Ashlie Atterson (spouse, Aaron), grandchildren, Leah, Jacob, Ella, Parker, and Cash, his paralegal and best friend, Tiffany Ennen (spouse, Christopher, and “granddaughters”, Emily and Sydney), nephews, Christopher McMahan and Michael McMahan, and several great-nieces and great-nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, one brother, Michael McMahan, sister-in-law, Mary Kay McMahan, and “grandson”, Kegan Ennen.\n\nFuneral services are scheduled for Thursday, December 8, 2022, at 11:00a.m., in Greiner Funeral Home, 2005 North 13th Street, Terre Haute, Indiana, 47804. Ed Lyon will officiate. Burial will follow in Memorial Park Cemetery, in Vincennes, Indiana. Visitation will be at the funeral home on Wednesday, December 7, 2022, from 3:00p.m. until 7:00p.m. and also prior to services on Thursday, from 10:00a.m. until service time.\n\nIf friends so desire, the family suggests that in lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Bob’s honor to the charities that were important to him: Christmas for Kids – Sullivan, PO Box 44, Dugger, IN 47848 and Our Father’s Arms, 711 S. Section St., Sullivan, IN 47882 or to a charity of your choice."
