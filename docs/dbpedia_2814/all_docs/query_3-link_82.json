The document summarizes seven different \"languages\" or ways of communicating that can promote personal and organizational transformation when shifting from one approach to another. It provides examples of how each \"language\" is commonly used in an initial way that is non-transformational versus how it could be used in a transformed way that promotes learning and growth. The seven language shifts discussed are: from complaint to commitment, from blame to responsibility, from resolutions to competing commitments, from assumptions held to assumptions we hold, from prizes/praising to ongoing regard, from rules to public agreement, and from constructive to deconstructive criticism.",
