        "text": "Dr. Robert Kegan is arguably the single most cited thought-leader in the field of adult development today. His ground-breaking works on human and organizational behavior include The Evolving Self, In Over Our Heads, Immunity to Change, How the Way We Talk Can Change the Way We Work, and An Everyone Culture. Long a sought-after speaker to professional groups in every sector and geography, Kegan’s writings have been translated into twelve languages.\n\nRegularly quoted in such publications as The New York Times and Forbes, the Harvard University’s Meehan Professor of Adult Learning and Professional Development is as comfortable in the boardroom as the classroom. CEOs worldwide ask him to assist them personally, their teams, and their organizations, to define and implement high-value improvement processes. His insight into individual and collective “immunities to change” has resulted in significant and sustainable improvements due to generative shifts in underlying mindsets.\n\nFor The Developmental Edge: Kegan is TDE’s co-founder and Chief Knowledge Officer. For TDE, Kegan provides high-level consulting to leaders and organizations, drawing on his deep understanding of individual and organization development. He also conducts widely-admired workshops and delivers powerful keynotes on such topics as becoming a Deliberately Developmental Organization®, the 21st Century Growth Culture®, and “Business as UNusual: the New Social Contract at Work.”"
