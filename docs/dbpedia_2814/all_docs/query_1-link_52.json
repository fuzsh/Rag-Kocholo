In this dazzling intellectual tour, Kegan completely reintroduces us to the psychological landscape of our private and public lives.\n\nAs parents and partners, employees and bosses, citizens and leaders, we constantly confront a bewildering array of expectations, prescriptions, claims, and demands, as well as an equally confusing assortment of expert opinions that tell us what each of these roles entails. Kegan shows that our frequent frustration in trying to meet these complex and often conflicting claims results from a mismatch between the way we ordinarily know the world and the way we are expected to understand it."
