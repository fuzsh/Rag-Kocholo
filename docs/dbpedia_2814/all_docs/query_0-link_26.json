        "text": "Yesterday, Monday, April 11th, between 9:30 and 11:30, I successfully defended my dissertation (I link to the full-text at the end of this post). It passed with no need for further edits and with a surprising amount of enthusiasm! It‚Äôs been nine years since I started my academic journey in theology. To be honest, the emotions are still trying to figure out what what they should be doing!\n\nThe run up to my defense was chaotic. The person in charge of scheduling the defense was on maternity leave with no auto-response associated with their email address, so our request to schedule my defense (now already after the spring graduation deadline!) sat for an additional two weeks unanswered. When we finally got in touch with someone, things moved fast. Much faster than I was emotionally prepared for!\n\nI was given essentially a week and a half to prepare. I‚Äôd never been to one of these before, so I was faced with the added difficulty of not really having a concept of what I was preparing for. At the very least, I knew there was to be a 10 to 20 minute introduction that I would have to give. Seeing that fairly objective, and also feeling the most anxiety about the presentation element of my defense, I got busy cranking out a stellar presentation.\n\nI worked my brain to exhaustion repeatedly over the next ten days. Then, with two days left to practice and read through my draft one last time, I finished my presentation and gave it a test run‚Ä¶\n\nIt took me THIRTY EIGHT MINUTES to talk through about a THIRD of it!\n\nThe word ‚Äúdoomed‚Äù floated across my mind. I imagined myself walking into the defense hall, shrugging my shoulders and saying ‚ÄúWell, I tried to put together an intro, but I screwed it up. What say we just state the title nice and clearly and move on to the questions?‚Äù\n\nInstead, I got up early the next morning, retreated to the detached garage in the back yard, stoked a nice fire and proceeded to craft a stripped-down version of both my talk and slides. I began practicing that night. More practicing the next day was combined with an afternoon of reading my dissertation again (while Megan sewed the button back onto the only pair of dress pants that fit me anymore!) Megan and I hit the road at 3:00pm to stay with her sister and our brother-in-law near St. Paul. To bed early, then awake, unable to sleep at 3:30 am. And finally, after some tense traffic, we were alone in an empty auditorium awaiting the arrival of my committee.\n\n‚ÄúThe work is done‚Äù I kept telling myself. ‚ÄúAll that‚Äôs left to do now is relax and be responsive to your readers.‚Äù My body seemed altogether unwilling to take my mind‚Äôs sage advice, so I fumbled around fretfully arranging the podium and occasionally walked to the window to get my mind off of the stark surroundings. There was a bronze sculpture called ‚ÄúLiving Hope of the Resurrection‚Äù in the small garden just outside. Its presence was a gift.\n\nThe gift was to increase, for just then Megan returned to the conference room with a number of my friends and colleagues who had arrived. The room quickly filled with graduate students, recently graduated friends, and finally my committee, Dr Lois Malcolm (my adviser) and Drs Amy Marga and Mary Hess (my readers).\n\nThe actual defense was a blur. I recall feeling deeply relieved that things were finally underway, and pleasantly surprised at the general enthusiasm and encouragement of my committee. My only regret is that I once caused Dr Marga to forget her question when a certain topic she touched on led me to turn and wink at my good friend Derek Maris in the audience. Maybe regret is too strong of a word, but I did feel a little bad about it.\n\nIn the end, my committee helped me to reconnect with the possibility that there may well be something important going on in my work. After years of these ideas being couched within a process that we‚Äôve just been trying to just get through, it‚Äôs been easy for me to lose sight of what led me to these ideas in the first place. They pushed me to really think about how the theological method I‚Äôve begun to chart has validity for both religious communities as well as for a culture that has largely ceased to give a rip about religious communities. I‚Äôm looking forward to the challenge.\n\nMegan and I breathed a tremendous sigh of relief as we walked to the car, only to discover that we had gotten, not one, but TWO parking tickets‚Ä¶ which turned out to be letters of congratulations that my Aunt Debra had snuck over sometime during the defense. üôÇ\n\nMy Facebook feed has been a non-stop accumulation of well wishes and congratulations ever since the first word went out yesterday. What a tremendous feeling. Thank you all!\n\nAnd now, for those who are curious, I present to you the final draft of my dissertation: Dying to Live: The Paradox of Christian Salvation, The Terror of Death, And Developmental Stages Theory. It is a mix of personal narrative and academic reflection. Many of you have been a part of the narrative it contains. It is my hope that the narrative will only continue and deepen. Thank you!\n\nA Brief Overview\n\nIt is often thought that Christianity keeps its adherents in a state of perpetual immaturity. As a sociological fact, this may be hard to argue against. Much that goes by the name Christianity looks quite near to what Ernest Becker described as a fearful ‚Äúdeath denying ideology.‚Äù In theological terminology, such ways of being amount to self-salvation programs. The terror of death drives us to avoid all forms of death. Yet, at the heart of Christianity stands one who chose his own death and encouraged his followers to take up their own crosses and follow him. Such an act, apparently, has an important role to play in an understanding of Christian salvation. In this thesis, I make use of developmental stages theory to illuminate what that role is. I argue that Christian salvation is founded on a paradoxical death that is best made sense of in light of contemporary developmental stages theory, in particular, at the thresholds of developmental stage transition. To illuminate this claim I trace out the logic across the rational, desirous, and active dimensions of human being. These dimensions are explored, in order, by way of Paul Tillich‚Äôs philosophy of religion, Sebastian Moore‚Äôs spiritual Christology, and the practice of Centering prayer. Taken together, it is concluded that Christianity has tremendous resources for helping its adherents come to grips with their death denying strategies and therefore enlarge their capacity for psychological and spiritual maturity.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe are familiar with the story. The young person raised in a religious home goes off to college, or perhaps seminary, and loses their faith. For them and for their family back home, it is a painful and bewildering experience. Their minds fill with questions about how they could have gone so wrong. The parents wonder if they should have paid for the private Christian college, or if they did, their guilt is even more intense, and explanations, even harder to come by. Never would it occur to any of them that the maturing young adult might be actually embodying the very death and resurrection of Christ. It might even be the case that the parents‚Äô resistance to facing what has actually affected their child puts them more on the side of the Pharisees than faith. How could this be?\n\nAt the center of this study stands the paradox of Christian salvation. Christianity is founded on the image of one who faced, engaged, and befriended the negativities of human existence, even the most radical of them all: death. In doing so, Jesus came to be called Christ the Savior. To follow this Christ, Christians are called to likewise lose their life in order to find it, to take up their cross and follow him. These are a vague and puzzling set of instructions. Perhaps because of this, the enormity of this paradoxical insight, as it pertains to spiritual growth and the way we deal with existential doubt, has hardly begun to be realized.\n\nMy aim in this thesis is to shed new light on the way that the paradox of Christian salvation transforms what appears as death, doubt, and faithlessness into new life during the normal course of one‚Äôs maturing spiritual life. I claim that developmental stage theories, specifically the work of Robert Kegan, provide us with a powerful tool to analyze and understand the formal dynamics of this spiritual development. I augment Kegan‚Äôs theory with the work of Ernest Becker, who focuses on the content of what keeps people and cultures clinging to self-destructive patterns of thought and action. We might think of Becker as providing a sustained analysis of why we are so often in the company of ‚Äúthose who seek to save their lives.‚Äù Becker helps us see that the often terrifying experience of psychological and, therefore, spiritual growth stems from an underlying fear of death (especially the death of our ‚Äúself-esteem‚Äù) which lies well beneath the surface of our stated concepts and commitments. After setting up my analytical apparatus, I move to apply it to the rational, passional, and practical dimensions of human being by examining Paul Tillich‚Äôs philosophy of religion, Sebastian Moore‚Äôs spiritual Christology, and the practice of Centering Prayer.\n\nMy aim from this work is twofold. My first goal is to develop a constructive theological proposal that shows how Christian salvation, when understood in its full paradoxical nature, unites the theoretical work of these thinkers with the practice of Centering Prayer. And, secondly, I aim to show how, contrary to our intuitions, a certain kind of death in the realm of our rational, desirous, and practical life (doubt, disaffection, and inaction) can lead through disintegration into a deepening maturity. This thesis will thus be dynamic enough to accommodate all stages of human maturation, while maintaining a focus on the universality of our fear of death as it takes on new forms at different developmental thresholds. By doing this, I hope to illuminate how Christianity possesses the theological resources to transform what is so often thought of as a loss of faith into an actual advance in spiritual maturity.\n\nThis post is a continuation of a series in which I make use of the blogosphere to motivate my dissertation free-writing. For context, read the short summary of my work here. There you will also find a table of contents with links to all the posts in this series.\n\nIn the previous section we outlined Sebastian Moore‚Äôs theory of original sin. There he characterized original sin as a self-limitation of life that is necessary for our emergence into self-aware existence, but that gets stuck in exclusively that self-limited way of being. Growth beyond the relative safety of our socially-bound self-limitation is powerfully resisted, based, as it is, upon a fundamental mistrust of life that goes all the way back to the first experiences of being an autonomous reality separate from our mother. As both Becker and Kegan have helped us see, our fearful reliance on coping strategies formed along this developmental journey has the effect of alienating us from each other and from our own potential as life becomes more complex than the original conditions under which they were formed. We noted how these original conditions gave rise to the persistent human habit of attempting to find our identity by always measuring ourselves against others. Such is our ‚Äúfirst focus‚Äù that we cling to because it is the world in which we first entered as self-aware beings. That being the case, it is understandable that our first focus easily becomes our only focus. However, our desire is unlimited, and for that reason our efforts to attain unlimited significance by measuring ourselves against limited others leads us to eat each other alive, as is amply reflected in the world‚Äôs constant war between the sexes, the social divisions that result from economic inequity, the conflict between racial, cultural, and religious others, and even the alienation between coworkers, family members, and friends.\n\nThe problem, therefore, consists of two parts. The first is that our true desire has been repressed. We easily settled for much safer forms of desire, and for that reason, we are easily led by the nose, allowing others to tell us what we should do, what we should love, and who we should fear. The second part of the problem is that for those whose deeper desire has begun to break through the surface of life, nothing in the world can satisfy it. Such people are like the Ebola virus, burning themselves up as well as the people around them with little regard for the impracticality of their actions.[1]\n\nMoore articulates the Christian solution as being not so much the creative repression of a genius, as Becker argued for, or the unrepression of the insane, as Becker felt the evangelists of unrepression must end with. Instead, Moore shows how Jesus leads his followers on a two two-step journey that mirrors the two-fold problem of the human condition. Jesus first awoke his disciples to their true desires, but then, as the one who stretched out his life beyond the limits we set upon it, he revealed to them resurrected life. Or as he puts it in another place, ‚ÄúWe are to become, first, honest, then cosmic.‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 127.)\n\nHow does Moore work this out? From what we have seen so far, we can view the story of the emergence of original sin as the story of the loss of the child in us, a foreshortened sense of our desirableness. (Let this Mind Be in You, 117.) In view of this, Moore encourages us to see the story of Jesus as the story of one who retains this child and, for that reason, is without original sin. We must also recall what was said earlier on the two general ways the problem of original sin is solved, namely, by way of indirect and direct awakening.\n\nWe are now ready to see the specific way that Moore conceives of Jesus as conquering sin. The basic pattern is that Jesus experienced his own desirability directly (union with the Father), and for that reason was able to bring about the indirect awakening of desire in those around him. Nothing too radical is on display at this point since these are the movements that, to varying degrees, occur between people every day. What makes the Christ event incomparable is its intensity and what occurred in the dramatic death of Jesus.\n\nIn terms of intensity, the Christian story is of one who‚Äôs experience of his own desirability was off the map of normal human experience. As Moore says, ‚Äúhis influence was the maximum possible within the limits of person-to-person contact. The charm, the magic, the allure of Jesus swept the whole range of human interaction, exhausted the possibilities of mutual awakening.‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 117.) It was this spiritual mindset that enabled Jesus to utterly cut against the grain of expected social norms, pouring forth a compassion that had no limit. No fragile ego limited his ability to reach out toward the members of society that represent the elements of the (predominately male)[2] psyche that are repressed during its developmental journey: the opposite sex, cultural ‚Äúothers,‚Äù moral transgressors; and, perhaps even more significantly, those who are explicit reminders of death; the poor, the sick, and the political oppressors. This intensity produced a new hope for human existence. It created what Jesus called the ‚ÄúKingdom of God,‚Äù and produced, precariously, heaven on earth. (Let this Mind Be in You, 117.)\n\nHowever, this new hope collapsed in the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus. Since Jesus awoke those around him to the maximum extent possible within the limits of social arousal, there could be no comparable level of social arousal after Jesus. There could be nothing except for the other awakening: ‚Äúthe direct awakening of the sense of being desirable, by the One by whose desire we exist.‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 118.) Moore sees the whole validity of the Christian message to hang on the series of encounters after Jesus‚Äô death that gave rise to this awakening. This transition, so famously bungled earlier by Peter and the request of James and John (Matthew 16:13-23, Mark 10:35-45), was the ‚Äúah ha‚Äù moment that Jesus had been trying to instill in his disciples throughout his ministry, but it took his removal from the scene of creaturely existence and the disciples subsequent reflection on the nature of his removal for the insight to finally click. The cross effected for them the horizontal explosion of social (indirect) arousal into the vertical dimension of mystical (direct) arousal.\n\nWhat was the nature of Jesus‚Äô removal, and why does it matter to our discussion? Moore stresses, that the nature of Jesus exit from the scene of creaturely existence was that of one who chose their own sacrifice. This is not suicide, or even the passion of one who runs into a burning building to save another. The gospel memory is of one who ‚Äúset his face towards Jerusalem,‚Äù in the full knowledge that his vocation was leading inexorably to his death. Moore sees the essential quality as being found in Jesus‚Äô initiation of a final act of friendship with the ultimate enemy of human life: death.\n\nFor the sinful condition that is ours, death is repressed‚Ä¶, banished, ‚Äòqueered‚Äô, thrown outside the city. At the same time we know that this rejected status of death is the sign of our‚Ä¶lostness, of an incapacity-to-feel that we cannot deal with. To meet the one who connected with, who befriended, who claimed, this our rejected death, would be to encounter an enormous and incomprehensible love. This love of us in our wretched unconnectedness, shown in the embrace of what we reject in horror, is intellectually nearly impossible to understand, but our deepest and simplest knowing moves out to it. At the heart of the Christian experience down the ages, the uncomprehending sufferer stretches out to the free, willing, understanding sufferer. And thus outstretched, the uncomprehending sufferer can at last received the communication of the incomprehensible inflictor as love, and see this in the fact of the victim raised from the grave. (Let this Mind Be in You, 129-9.)\n\nThe significance of this cannot be stressed enough. We have seen that crux of Moore‚Äôs concept of original sin was the dynamic of self-limitation of our desirability (and therefore desire) that occurs during the process of psychological birth and growth, combined with our resistance to growing beyond that self-limitation. The result is our separation from each other, our potential, and God. More than that, it is not just ‚Äúseparation,‚Äù it is the creation of enmity, disgust, even horror at all dimensions of reality in ourselves and others that press beyond the edges of our self-created membrane. (See Richard Beck‚Äôs Excellent book ‚ÄúUnclean:%20Meditations on Purity, Hospitality, and Mortality Unclean‚Äù for more on the role of disgust as it pertains to our capacity for offering hospitality) And at the root of it all stands the terror of death, for it is ultimately in response to the terror of death that our our fragile ego has been created. As it stands, humanity is largely arrested at its ‚ÄúOedipal self-understanding.‚Äù We ‚Äútake it for reality itself‚Äù and thus ‚Äúimpose on society and on the universe that distrust of life, that self-repression, which was once appropriate when we were engaged on the business of becoming separate and sexually distinguished selves.‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 127.)\n\nIn other words, we set our own limit on the meaningfulness of our life in our refusal to grow‚Ä¶. We build an invisible wall round our life. Outside that wall, uncharted by us, is death. For what does it mean to be ready for death? Who is? To be ready for death is to be living life to the full, to its limit‚Äîwhich is death. We don‚Äôt live this life to anything like its fullness. And what this means is that we don‚Äôt believe in the glorious being that each of us is. Massively we repress the sense of our greatness and our desires, in consequence, are weak.‚Ä¶Thus we create a wall round ourselves, within which we live. And far beyond that wall is God‚Äôs limit on us, death, the threshold of his loving embrace. (Let this Mind Be in You, 127.)\n\nIt is exactly here that Jesus initiated the final breakthrough for his disciples. Though they remained uncomprehending throughout his life, the final intensification of their relationship with him at the last supper, followed by Jesus‚Äô own self-removal as the object of their devotion, led to the ultimate crisis and transformation. Their awareness of the final enemy, death, had to be transformed, and when this occurred new life flooded back down through all levels of their awareness. Religious, cultural, and economic divisions were radically transformed in the new life that poured forth, as well as those of gender and social relations. Salvation was in this way an in-breaking of a hope that outstripped the disciples‚Äô expectations that were possible under their former awareness. At the same time, their salvation consisted in the experience of a reunion with their own basic goodness. They knew themselves for the first time, as they come from the hand of God, ‚Äúdesirable because desired.‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 118.)\n\nThis post is a continuation of a series in which I make use of the blogosphere to motivate my dissertation free-writing. For context, read the short summary of my work here. There you will also find a table of contents with links to all the posts in this series.\n\n[1] These remarks remind me something Becker said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶[H]uman heroics is a blind drivenness that burns people up; in passionate people, a screaming for glory as uncritical and reflexive as the howling of a dog. In the more passive masses of mediocre men it is disguised as they humbly and complainingly follow out the roles that society provides for their heroics and try to earn their promotions within the system: wearing the standard uniforms‚Äîbut allowing themselves to stick out, but ever so little and so safely, with a little ribbon or a red boutonniere, but not with head an shoulders.‚Äù (The Denial of Death, 6.)\n\n[2] Given the patriarchal nature of Jesus‚Äô time we might expect that the social norms would mirror the psychological patterns of the male mind.\n\nIn the previous section we discussed two awakenings to God as the ultimate cause of desire. In this section we will be exploring Sebastian Moore‚Äôs answer to the question of why such awakenings are necessary in the first place. Indeed, why not think of the normal, run of the mill, sorts of desire we experience in everyday life as being normative, while bracketing off the sorts of desire experienced when falling in love or during rather exceptional mystical experiences, as being simply odd quirks of human psychology? The answer that Moore gives us is, in brief, that desire as experienced by most adults is but the latest form of a process that has a long history. And once this history is gotten in view it is possible to see that calling the emotion we feel in our daily lives ‚Äúdesire‚Äù is much like calling Superman merely ‚ÄúClark.‚Äù In laying out Moore‚Äôs narrative of the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù of human desire this chapter will finally bring into focus Moore‚Äôs theory of original sin: the loss of our original desire and resistance to its recovery.\n\nMoore reads the history of desire in human life through our developmental history, both corporately and individually. Psychoanalytic theory is one of his principle dialogue partners in charting this territory. He is particularly interested in how psychoanalytic theorists like Margaret Mahler show us how children grow into self-aware existence through a series of crises. The two crises that Moore focuses on most are the separation crisis and the Oedipal crisis. In both cases these crises represent a narrowing down of awareness and desire. This process of individuation is good in that it the process of identity formation, but it comes at the cost of losing the security of one‚Äôs original union with being, most obviously symbolized as the child within the mother‚Äôs womb.\n\nThe Separation Crisis: From ‚ÄúWe‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äù\n\nThe separation crisis initiates the human habit of always measuring ourselves against the reactions of others. Following Mahler, Moore describes the process by which the child with newly developed motor skills begins the ecstatic adventure of charting the world beyond the safety of the mother.[1] The crucial point here is that this exploration requires an enormous amount of emotional support by the mother. Just the right balance must be struck between encouraging the child to be on its own and remaining a stable security in the background. However, no mother can ever offer such a consistent, emotionally-supported send off. And to the extent this is true, the infant gets the unbearable message: ‚Äúeither be a part of me, or be on your own.‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 71.) Thus, this separation, this first experience of what it is like to be ‚ÄúI,‚Äù is less than ecstatic. This dynamic that begins with the mother is then extended to all others. ‚ÄúThe imperfectly separated individual existence looks continually to the other whence it has been unable clearly to pull away. Not knowing ourselves apart from others is our trouble, to remedy which we look to others!‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 72.)\n\nThis initial phase in the birth of self-consciousness gives us the first part of our answer to the question of why our original goodness is more fundamental than our self-image (and therefore desire) as we experience it later in our developmental journey. It also explains why talk of our original goodness is puzzling to most of us, for, as Moore asks, ‚ÄúWhy would anyone think of being him/herself other than the way they first came into consciousness? The world on which we first opened our eyes psychologically comes to be the world.‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 72.) And to that extent, our emergence into self-aware existence impedes our awakening into luminous selfhood, for so long as we are looking to others for reassurance and measuring ourselves by their reactions, we are deaf to the ‚Äúcall from the depths of existence which says, ‚Äòyou are mine. You are not your family‚Äôs, your class‚Äôs, your race‚Äôs, your party‚Äôs. You are mine.‚Äô‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 72.)\n\nThe Oedipal Crisis: From Yes to No\n\nThe second part of the answer to our question comes from a complexification of the child‚Äôs now reduced sense of desirability. This is the Oedipal phase. Here, desire makes its first translation from an original oneness with the mother into interpersonal feeling. In a tremendously intense, sexually undifferentiated love, the child makes a total bid for the mother‚Äôs affection. It is here that the child encounters a ‚Äúmysterious rival:‚Äù the father. The father is mysterious due to the fact that he has a claim to the mothers affection in a different way than the child. So not only is the father a rival, but he is a different kind of rival. (Let this Mind Be in You, 73.) The result of this asymmetrical collision is that the child‚Äôs total bid for the mother‚Äôs affection becomes a ‚Äúno-no‚Äù and is repressed.[2] Of this repression Moore says, poignantly, that,\n\nI suspect that this is an important part of that repression of our sense of being desirable which is the root of our weakened relationship with God, people, and the planet. That child‚Äôs total zest for life, the sense of being welcome everywhere without strings attached, meets its first great disappointment in the mother‚Äôs commitment to an ‚Äòother‚Äô in an ‚Äòother‚Äô way. (Let this Mind Be in You, 73.)\n\nIn Freudian terms, the culmination of this crisis results in the repression of the Id (the total love-bid now become a no-no and repressed), followed by the emergence of sexually differentiated identity (the Ego), which is modeled and reinforced after one‚Äôs parental role model (the Superego). (Let this Mind Be in You, 74.) In Moore‚Äôs thought, this forms the basis of his theory of original sin. Original sin, he says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶is the universal, culturally propagated and reinforced, human response to the trauma of coming out of animality into self-awareness, into ‚Äòthe knowledge of good and evil.‚Äô‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 88.) It is not simply the repression of our passionate nature that forms the birth of evil (as Moore reads Wilhelm Reich as arguing), but also the fact that ‚Äú‚Ä¶in repressing our passionate nature we are discounting our desirability, which is our experience of ourselves as God‚Äôs desired.‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 74.) Without this element, our passionate nature can still be interpreted as ‚Äúdesire from emptiness‚Äù and thus be open to all the problems that attend such an anthropology (e.g. relations of dependence).\n\nOnce that is understood, then certainly we can say that repression is the origin of evil, and that what our transformation will consist in is the final befriending of all all that is in us that we have had to repress on our first steps into personhood. God is that infinite intelligence for which there is no such thing as evil. Evil arises out of our self-doubt on the part of God‚Äôs self-aware creatures. And the closer a person or a community comes to God, the more their ‚Äòdark side‚Äô becomes light. (Let this Mind Be in You, 74.)\n\nAnd yet, to the extent that we remain ‚Äúfar from God,‚Äù much of life takes on a compulsive quality. As Ernest Becker has helped us see, viewed corporately, repression is culture. As such, to appropriate Robert Kegan‚Äôs language, culture functions as a corporate ‚Äúimmunity system.‚Äù This partial view of our whole life, motivated as it is by the terror of death, thus compels us to live according to the biases of our family, class, ethnicity, and so on. For if we do not, we will leave ourselves open to the very threats that our collective immunity system was tailor made to protect us from. Seen in this light, Moore‚Äôs theory of original sin is not only original, but also universal.\n\nThe final point that needs to be understood in Moore‚Äôs theory of original sin is that it is not the limited, repressed life that we find ourselves in that constitutes our sin, but rather is it our decision to stay there, to say ‚Äúthis is all there is.‚Äù Life itself is a movement of growth and it is our resistance to growth that puts us at odds with life. In this way Moore seems to want to go further than Becker was able to bring himself. Our desire is made for more than merely the creative self-restriction that repression affords us. Desire longs for liberation. Failing this, Moore sees humanity as being ‚Äúshut in‚Äù and ‚Äúpsychologically on top of each other.‚Äù Our desires are ‚Äúlimitless,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúand need the limitless breathing-space of the spirit. Closed in, they make us mutually destructive.‚Äù (Let this Mind Be in You, 104.) In the next section we will consider Moore‚Äôs Christology which functions as his theological solution to this problem of original sin as the narrowing of desire and resistance to its liberation.\n\nThis post is a continuation of a series in which I make use of the blogosphere to motivate my dissertation free-writing. For context, read the short summary of my work here. There you will also find a table of contents with links to all the posts in this series.\n\n[1] For this narrative Moore is relying on the following Margaret Mahler‚Äôs book: The Psychological Birth of the Human Infant.\n\n[7] Following R.D. Laing, Moore stresses that repression is not only forgetting, but forgetting that you‚Äôve forgotten.\n\nThe problem this chapter (a list of all posts in this project is here) has aimed to address is the phenomena of faith loss among Christians whose critical ability has attained the capacity to undercut its own historical and philosophical foundations. These are those for whom historical arguments regarding the Bible and the historical Jesus have become important, but also have failed. Such people tend to also have a similar relationship to philosophical arguments for God‚Äôs existence. The heart of this chapter has been an attempt to describe in a rational mode how what is often termed a loss of faith is, in reality, a necessary element of rational development. We have shown how Scharlemann‚Äôs appropriation of Tillich paints a broader philosophical landscape in which to make sense of the problem and also avoids the nihilism that threatens any systematic thought that is unable to anchor itself in reality. The basic problem was shown to be a truncated conception of reason combined with the lack of recognition that reason (reflection and response) proceeds through a series of stages whereby the objectival is ‚Äúlost‚Äù at each transition due to the activities of criticism and doubt. The solution was shown to be Tillich‚Äôs correlation of reflection and response and the anchoring of both these moments in a paradoxical reality and presence.\n\nHow do these ideas relate to the work of Becker and Kegan that we examined in the previous chapter? To begin, we should recall Becker‚Äôs description of humanity‚Äôs existential paradox as a creature capable of tasting the eternal, but nevertheless being bound to the limits of finitude, and most notably, being subject to death. In reality, the vast majority of human-kind experiences this paradox as an unbearable contradiction. And it was here that Becker then vigorously rubbed our noses in all the various individual and communal ways we set about denying of our existential condition. When these ideas are extended into the realm of human reason it is easy to see how criticism and doubt can be used in exactly this way to protect ourselves from potentially threatening realities and powers. In this way, critical reflection and doubting response can give up the task of truth-seeking and become merely self-protective, thus stifling growth and maturity.\n\nBut what of those who begin to experience the edges of their own ways of knowing as not mere contradiction, but as paradox? These are the ones who begin the great risk pushing the edges of their rational world. Kegan provided us with a rich framework to make sense of this moment by way of a series of mental paradigm shifts where what was previously held as subject became capable of being reflected upon as an object of thought. Likewise, Scharlemann traced for us a cultural history of this very same movement. In addition to this Kegan is also well known for moving developmental stage theory beyond an exclusively cognitive focus to include the emotional dimension of human life, and to that extent Scharlemann‚Äôs appropriation of Tillich again resonates strongly with Kegan‚Äôs work. This is seen clearly in Scharlemann‚Äôs classification of reason into its reflective and responsive modes. Thus, Scharlemann was able to give us a historical road map of the reflective and responsive aspects of human reason that further reinforces the analytic power of Kegan‚Äôs model.\n\nIn an effort to lessen the abstraction of this chapter we have periodically considered the doubts that the young Paul Tillich faced about the historical foundations of his faith. We will now conclude this chapter by returning once again to this problem which continues to this day in both scholarly and popular forms. It seems that scarcely a year goes by without a new slew of articles and television programs that ask us to consider ‚Äúwho was Jesus, really?‚Äù The implication tends always to be that the Jesus you think you know, the Jesus you pray to, and the Jesus that you trust to keep you and your loved ones safe in this life and the next is not at all the real Jesus. Some even evidence a certain glee in this ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù moment. However the question that we are here urged to consider is not unlike the one that Jesus himself asked his own followers, and we would do well to attend once again to that narrative.\n\nWho do you say that I am?\n\nIn the introduction to this chapter we reflected on Peter‚Äôs answer to this question: declaring Jesus to be the messiah. This became a problem for Peter because, the messiah that he had in mind was roughly the functional equivalent of the ‚ÄúJesus that you trust to keep you and your loved ones safe in this life and the next.‚Äù Upon exposing Peter‚Äôs self-protective and self-aggrandizing hopes, Jesus‚Äô reaction was intense and immediate: ‚ÄúGet behind me Satan!‚Äù Now, let this sink in. What does this mean for the believer and for the cultural debunkers? For the believer Jesus refuses to be a temporal security. And for this reason he embodies the criticism of the debunkers before they even have a chance to speak. To participate in salvation is, therefore, not to have one‚Äôs temporal securities vindicated (for example, by embarrassing the cultural debunkers by producing a world-renowned scholar to expose their arguments as foolishness). Instead, to participate in salvation‚Äîas Tillich eventually learned‚Äîis to mirror the paradoxical motions of Christ.\n\nThis concludes our exploration of the paradox of salvation in the dimension of human reason. In the next chapter we will view it from the perspective of spirituality and theology in the Christology of Sebastian Moore.\n\nThis post is a continuation of a series in which I make use of the blogosphere to motivate my dissertation free-writing. For context, read the short summary of my work here. There you will also find a table of contents with links to all the posts in this series.\n\nThis post is the concluding post to what will be chapter 2 of my dissertation. In it, I want to highlight the way that the psychological insights of Ernest Becker and Robert Kegan (explored in previous posts) have helped us see that growth of the psyche is traumatic, dramatic, and moves according to a paradoxical logic. Along its path to maturity, the self undergoes the disorienting loss of its former ways of maintaining stability. There is no truly developmental growth without dying to life as one had formerly known it and a willingness wait for the emergence of oneself as yet unknown. As both Becker and Kegan have shown us, our resistance to releasing our former securities is tremendous for the simple reason that its experienced as a matter of life and death.\n\nFrom the perspective of theology, the terror of death and the innumerable forms of self-deception that follow from it are the consequences of sin. As Paul Tillich reminded us, ‚ÄúSin is a universal fact before it becomes and individual act.‚Äù In this sense, sin is not primarily a moral act, but rather it is a fundamental characteristic of human existence. Sin is to be separated from God who is the ‚Äòfullness,‚Äô ‚Äòsource,‚Äô or ‚Äòground‚Äô of all being and goodness.[1] As a consequence, sin is also to be separated from the full truth and goodness of ourselves and the full truth and goodness of others. Thus, to come into self-aware existence without the consciousness of one‚Äôs being united with God, humanity finds itself immersed in the fear of death from the very first moments of self-emergence. The developmental task of spiritual growth is therefore directed principally to this single primal rupture. What has been separated in the emergence of self-identity, needs to be reunited, though on a higher level.[2]\n\nThis way of speaking is given fresh life by the work of Robert Kegan. As we have seen from his work, this single fear takes on many different forms depending on the stage of consciousness that one constructs themselves at. For most adults, realities of sin and salvation are being worked out at the social level (Kegan‚Äôs ‚Äútraditionalism‚Äù stage). Here, one‚Äôs self is constructed according to the reactions of one‚Äôs social world, namely by the way the self is reflected in the faces of others. One‚Äôs concept of God is likewise constructed in strongly interpersonal terms. Here, judgement is first experienced as failing to measure up to the values of one‚Äôs social world. Potentially, if one begins to approach the outer threshold of this stage, the experience of condemnation emerges as the inability to ever attain peace by knowing oneself in the face of others. The possibility of salvation at this stage of consciousness is therefore not the possibility of pleasing everyone, but instead it is the possibility of an as of yet unknown way of constructing oneself and one‚Äôs world. This is the transition to a more self-authoring developmental plateau (Kegan‚Äôs ‚Äúmodernism‚Äù stage). This is a tremendous achievement beyond tribalism, but the dynamics of sin and salvation are still operative and will make themselves known according to their new formal structure. This is what I mean by claiming that salvation operates by orders of degree and intensity.\n\nWe can gain a tremendous insight into the dynamics of salvation if we consider it from a developmental perspective. From here we can see that salvation is not a matter of education. One cannot learn the necessary information to experience salvation, though the right information at the right times can help to make sense of what is typically a bewildering experience. The need for salvation follows from the dynamics of growth. From birth through adolescence, our developmental task is largely the achievement of a separate, autonomous identity. However, this work is done in the context of unfathomable insecurity. As Becker has illuminated for us, our achievement is really the quasi-achievement of crafting a suit of character armor. Again, this armor will be crafted of different materials depending upon the developmental plateau that one is on, but regardless, it will keep us safe only at the price of slowing us down and restricting our vision in various ways. For example, in order to grow beyond the ill-fitting armor that we‚Äôve simply inherited from our parents and early social context, we must first dis-identify from our armor, risk allowing it to be removed piece by piece, then hopefully we will be able to create something more suitable to our unique individuality from the parts before the next threat to our integrity emerges.\n\nThis leads me to my final point. When viewed developmentally, salvation is the affirmative experience of God-as-unknown that calls to us from beyond our present securities and way of knowing. This is a difficult thing to state, for how can one experience a security beyond one‚Äôs current capacities? We are now in the neighborhood of Kierkegaard‚Äôs ‚Äúleap‚Äù of faith.[3] The experience of salvation gives one the courage to face the fear of death that accompanies the limits of one‚Äôs current mental complexity. Without this transcendent security, the risk is too great. People will stay within the hell of their inherent paradoxes rather than step into the nothing of the unknown God. To cope, such a decision is also accompanied by a despairing resignation of our potential. The voice from beyond that is singing God‚Äôs dream for us‚Äîwhich is simultaneously our own dream of ourselves‚Äîis covered over and shut out. It is asking of us more than we can fathom. It is asking us to have faith, and to die to the whole order of life as we have known it. To this passive dimension of salvation which calls for us to release our known securities, an active dimension must be added. Much as Kierkegaard stressed, salvation is a decision beyond reason. With the help of our constructive developmental framework, we might suggest that this active dimension of salvation is the activity of life-itself reaching from the unknown though ourselves as known and grasping the unknown. We will see this pattern repeat as we continue our exploration in the coming chapters.\n\nThis post is a continuation of a series in which I make use of the blogosphere to motivate my dissertation free-writing. For context, read the short summary of my work here. There you will also find a table of contents with links to all the posts in this series.\n\n[1] The words ‚Äúsource‚Äù and ‚Äúground‚Äù should be recognized a analogies and should not be understood in their proper categorical senses.\n\n[2] The language of ‚Äúon a higher level‚Äù is necessary in order to avoid the idea that spiritual growth amounts to a sort of ‚Äúreturn to the womb,‚Äù a resignation of human self-transcendence and a return to animal immediacy.\n\n[3] ‚ÄúFaith is the objective uncertainty with the repulsion of the absurd, held fast in the passion of inwardness, which is the relation of inwardness intensified to its highest. This formula fits only the one who has faith, no one else, not even a lover, or an enthusiast, or a thinker, but solely and only the one who has faith, who relates himself to the absolute paradox.‚Äù Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, Volume 1, 611.\n\nOver the last few posts we have witnessed Ernest Becker propose that all or our cultural activity, even our very self-identity is a massive effort to stave off our natural fear of death (here, here, here, and here). In that context, psychological growth was identified as developing an enlarged capacity to face these self-protective strategies without going mad in the process. In the previous post Robert Kegan‚Äôs five orders of consciousness were introduced as a more detailed framework for understanding psychological growth as a progression in relative degrees of un-repression. In view of this, growth is marked by moving psychological realities that ‚Äúhave us,‚Äù to elements that we are able to ‚Äúhave,‚Äù that is, look at with some degree of objectivity. In this post we will explore the structure of our resistance to growth as developed in Kegan and Lisa Laskow Lahey‚Äôs book Immunity to Change: How to Overcome It and Unlock the Potential in Yourself and Your Organization.\n\nThe Use of Inherent Paradox in Psychotherapy\n\nThe need for growth arises from the fact that life has a way of never quite leaving us alone. No matter how much we may try to avoid them, impossible problems tend to find us. Such problems are what psychotherapist David Schnarch calls inherent paradoxes. Such paradoxes are naturally occurring inconsistencies in our culturally mediated beliefs and values which, under the right circumstances, can from problems that we can neither solve, nor avoid. Here inherent paradoxes become crucibles. They occur at the edges of our developmental thresholds. This is the reason they cannot be ‚Äúsolved,‚Äù for our attempts at a solution come from within our developmental limits, but the problem is a problem because of our developmental limits.\n\nPointing to the work of Weeks and L‚ÄôAbate, Schnarch describes how ‚Äúthe solution to inherent paradox is to promote a quantum leap in the complexity of the solution.‚Äù Such a ‚Äúsolution,‚Äù he says, really amounts to a ‚Äúparadigm shift in the process of going to a higher level of functioning.‚Äù This is essentially what constitutes a stage transition as identified by Kegan. ‚ÄúWhen the paradox results from embedded cultural values and beliefs, it is necessary to establish a viewpoint outside the culture form which the implicit cultural information can be viewed and examined.‚Äù I would add to this that such a point of view is not only, in some sense, ‚Äúoutside of culture,‚Äù but in the context of personal growth it must be a view from outside one‚Äôs developmental limits, in other words, from outside of oneself as one knows it.\n\nMy aim at this point is to introduce how Kegan and Laskow Lahay have put the idea of inherent paradox to work as a therapeutic tool to 1. help people see the paradoxical inconsistencies that their own lives are manifesting from a standpoint one remove beyond their usual point of view and in so doing 2. help people learn to test the hidden, self-constituting assumptions that form the limits of their current self and world understanding. In reviewing this we will gain insight into some of the dynamics of psychological death and rebirth which can occur numerous times throughout one‚Äôs life.\n\nInherent Paradox and the ‚ÄúImmunity to Change‚Äù\n\nDoubtless the beliefs and practices of our life are filled with paradoxical inconsistencies. For practical purposes, most of these can be safely ignored in our day to day interactions since nothing critical hangs on them, nor do they force any deeper self-confrontation. Typically, we do our best to avoid this latter kind of inconsistency, but, by process of elimination, life has a way of driving us into scenarios where avoiding the situation becomes impossible without sacrificing our integrity. For example we might consider again the young person who was taught ‚Äúknow that you believe‚Äù and to courageously love truth like Jesus did, only to find that their love of truth led them to doubt the historical reliability of the image of Jesus, and therefore, apparently, the foundation of their love of truth itself. A paradox of this sort cannot be comfortably avoided. It has now become a crucible which, if endured, has to potential to stimulate psychological, even spiritual, growth.\n\nThe reason that such crucibles are so difficult for us to negotiate amounts to what Kegan and Laskow Lahey refer to as our psychological immunity system. The metaphor of an immunity system is apt, for the function of an immunity system is to protect an organism from foreign bodies that pose a threat to its integrity. In this way, to have an immunity system is a good thing! But as those familiar with organ transplants knows, this good thing can prove fatal in situations where a foreign organ is necessary to save the life of the individual. In the same way our system of repressions, or psychological immune system, is designed to keep us safe from realities that threaten our psychological integrity, but, at the same time, life sometimes makes it necessary to transgress the boundaries of our psychological immunity system if we are to avoid death of a different sort. As can be seen from Kegan‚Äôs five orders of consciousness, each level will have an immunity system that picks out a different set of targets as possible threats to its integrity. To the socialized mind, losing the approval of one‚Äôs tribe is the ultimate threat to be guarded against. To the self-authoring mind, the ultimate threat will be failing one‚Äôs personal ideology, and so on.\n\nKegan and Laskow Lahey frame the possibilities and limits of our equanimity (our immunity to change) in the following way. The heart of their book is helping people to construct an ‚Äúimmunity map,‚Äù which is a sort of snapshot of their inherent paradox. The immunity map consists of a four column table. In the first column goes an improvement goal. An improvement goal is some area of one‚Äôs life that has shown itself to be an developmental rather than technical problem. For example, one might feel the need to either learn to delegate more tasks in a new role as supervisor. In the second column one lists all the concrete activities that one does instead of the improvement goal (i.e., ‚ÄúI pass off tasks to X, but micro-manage how they approach it.‚Äù). For many people this is as far as conscious awareness goes. For such people the next step can feel like a magic trick. With the first two columns in place, one is asked the question: ‚ÄúWhat do you worry would happen if you did not do the things in the second column?‚Äù In the case of our example, ‚ÄúWhat do you worry would happen if you did not micro-manage how you subordinates approach the task you have given them?‚Äù The goal here is to surface a hidden commitment that is driven by a fear. Thus our subject might respond, after a bit of reflection, ‚ÄúI worry that if I am not directly involved I will be viewed as merely administrative dead weight.‚Äù This fear is then translated into the commitment: ‚ÄúI am committed to not being administrative dead weight and thus I will work to be directly involved with all work that I am responsible for.‚Äù\n\nOnce we step back and take a look at the shape of our three columns so far, it is easy to see that column three is in direct opposition to column one. One foot is on the gas, while the other is on the brake, as Kegan and Laskow Lahey like to say. The inherent paradox that our immunity system has created is now in full view. Getting this in view helps us see clearly why it is that change, even passionately desired change, is so often impossible from the standpoint of our current mental complexity, that is, life as we know it. What is needed, then, is a new way of knowing, a new order of mental complexity. Kegan and Laskow Lahey help people begin to take this step by moving to the forth column. Here one works on identifying a set of ‚Äúbig assumptions‚Äù that makes the fears that make one‚Äôs column three commitments inevitable. Such assumptions form the protective limits of one‚Äôs mental complexity. These assumptions are like ‚Äúdanger do not enter‚Äù signs at the edge of one‚Äôs current mental world. They may well be true and should therefore be heeded, but they might not be. The only way to know is to first see them, and then to test them.\n\nIn the final section of this chapter we will bring together what we have learned from Becker and Kegan and apply these insights to the question of the paradox of salvation. What have we learned about the meaning of Jesus‚Äô claim that those who seek to save their life will lose it? What of those that lose their life, and yet find it?\n\nThis post is a continuation of a series in which I make use of the blogosphere to motivate my dissertation free-writing. For context, read the short summary of my work here. There you will also find a table of contents with links to all the posts in this series.\n\nSome problems in life are impossible to solve; instead, they need to be transcended. One famous example that our culture continues to struggle with is the question of whether life ought to be lived by the passion of faith or, instead, by the critical application of reason. It seems to be a sensible question, yet the very terms in which the question is asked renders any solution impossible. There is no object of faith, even the most tightly held, that is immune from rational doubt, and likewise, no rational position is held in the absence of a passionate reason for holding it. But the example need not be so philosophical as this. Another more ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù example would be the question of how one can equally meet the relational commitments of their spouse, children, family of origin, as well as those of their professional life. The aphorism ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt make everyone happy‚Äù may be true, but that doesn‚Äôt stop most of us from burning ourselves out or compromising our relationships while under the illusion that it isn‚Äôt. Unlike problems that can simply be solved by the application of technical knowledge, like fixing a pipe that is leaking, or finding shelter when it starts to rain, many of life‚Äôs problems require a change in us before they can be moved past.\n\nThis may seem obvious. We might think that the person who is stuck in a crisis of faith just needs to realize that the world is a bit more complicated than their ridged concepts will allow for. The one who is struggling to balance their relational commitments simply needs to learn to say ‚Äúno‚Äù and prioritize their time in a way more in line with the limitations of their life. And we might add to this that a person who wants to lose weight needs to stop eating so much and exercise more, right? Why is it, then, that such advice, though it can be seen to be perfectly logical, simply does not result in any lasting change for most of us? In fact, for most of us, problems of this nature are impossible to solve without undergoing the loss of our life as we know it.[1]\n\nIntroducing Robert Kegan\n\nRobert Kegan‚Äôs developmental stages theory of adult human development is a contemporary model of human maturation that has shown itself to have enormous power when it comes to clarifying the dynamics involved in human maturation. In recent years he has gone further, and with the help of Lisa Laskow Lahey he has developed a whole program designed to stimulate psychological growth. His work is enormously complex and is developed across numerous books, so I will be making no attempt to here capture the breadth of his thinking. Instead I will seek to briefly give a snapshot of his developmental theory, then relate it to the concept of ‚Äúthe immunity to change‚Äù that he and Laskow Lahey have recently developed. In doing this we will see, from a formal perspective, how the fear of death that Becker introduced us to is not experienced as a single reality, but manifests in qualitatively different ways at different points in our developmental journey. The contrast that Becker set up between ‚Äúliving a lie‚Äù and ‚Äúgoing mad‚Äù is thus shown to be a bit too stark, yet at the threshold of developmental change his characterization probably maps quite well to the experience. Kegan will help us see why.\n\nKegan‚Äôs Five Orders of Consciousness\n\nThe essence of Kegan‚Äôs theory is that at each of the five transitions he identifies there develops a capacity to take the reality we see, feel, and know through, and make it an object that we can critically reflect on. In this sense, the dynamics of growth involve and ever growing capacity to move what is ‚Äúsubject for us,‚Äù to an object of reflection. Kegan and his colleagues have developed a what they call a ‚Äúsubject/object‚Äù inventory, which is a test that is able to locate what stage a person is at on the basis of which elements of their experience they are able to reflect upon and which elements constitute their act of seeing. These latter elements Kegan calls one‚Äôs ‚Äúculture of embeddedness.‚Äù Such elements are not open to critical evaluation, for they constitute one‚Äôs self-experience. To transcend all cultures of embeddness would amount to what Becker felt was impossible: to live an unrepressed life.\n\nThese stages begin with infancy. What is subject for the infant is ‚Äúthe now.‚Äù The psyche of the infant operates atomistically and immediately. To even speak of an object of reflection at this stage strains our language, for the infant remains largely undifferentiated from its surroundings. Beyond infancy, the child starts to differentiate and is able to reflect on immediacy as an object. This makes possible the construction of ‚Äúdurable categories.‚Äù Peek-a-boo is no longer the thrill it once was because Mommy or Daddy cease to ‚Äúmagically appear‚Äù when they emerge from behind their hands. The category ‚ÄúMommy‚Äù or ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù thus become durable. The realities beyond the impression are understood to persist in time and space. This stage typically characterizes early childhood.\n\nNext comes the ability move the durable categories from being subject to object and therefore being able to think trans-categorically. Mom and Dad now not only endure in time and space, but are recognized to have their own independent point of view. This stage typically characterizes early adolescence but many people operate at this stage their whole life. Kegan labels this stage as ‚Äútraditionalism‚Äù in In Over Our Heads, and ‚Äúthe socialized mind‚Äù in Immunity to Change.\n\nBeyond traditionalism comes the ability to move trans-categorical thinking from subject to object and therefore develop the capacity to think in terms of a system or complex. One is now able to operate from the standpoint of their own personal ideology. One attains the capacity to have a system of values distinct from Mom, Dad, and the culture at large. One can, for the first time, ‚Äúbe true to one‚Äôs self.‚Äù Kegan calls this stage ‚Äúmodernism‚Äù in In Over Our Heads, and ‚Äúthe self-authoring mind‚Äù in Immunity to Change. Research has shown that achieving this stage constitutes the developmental task that most of us (about 58% of the middle-class, college educated, people studied) currently face.\n\nThe last of Kegan‚Äôs five stages he calls ‚Äúpostmodernism‚Äù in In Over Our Heads, and ‚Äúthe self-transforming mind‚Äù in Immunity to Change. What characterizes this stage of mental complexity is the ability to hold one‚Äôs ideology out as an object of reflection and therefore develop the capacity to think trans-systemically. ‚ÄúBeing true to one‚Äôs self‚Äù is here recognized as one conditioned option among many. The limits of one‚Äôs personal ideology are no longer felt as a threat. Mom and Dad are able to be forgiven for their own limited point of view. Less than one percent of all people studied have achieved this level of mental complexity.\n\nSubjective Transcendence and the Fear of Death\n\nOnce this subject-object pattern of growth is seen, it is easy to understand how the fear of death appears in the normal course of our developmental journey. These transitions in which a whole way of knowing oneself and the world becomes dislodged and is looked at presents an enormous increase in potential perspective, but at the same time life as one had to this point known it is ‚Äúlost.‚Äù All the familiar stepping stones are pulled from ones feet and a sort of nihilism washes over the self. Is it any wonder that, in view of Becker‚Äôs work, we frequently resist our own growth? Sometimes its easier to live with our impossible problems than it is to grow through them. Sometimes it‚Äôs not. But the paradox is that in order to move beyond the problem, one must cease to address it directly. Such problems are like the voice of a friend that you can hear beyond a high wall, but cannot yet see. In such a case, staring more intently at the wall is no solution. In the next section we will consider Kegan and Laskow Lahay‚Äôs attempt to facilitate growth when our impossible problems become too much to bear.\n\nThis post is a continuation of a series in which I make use of the blogosphere to motivate my dissertation free-writing.
