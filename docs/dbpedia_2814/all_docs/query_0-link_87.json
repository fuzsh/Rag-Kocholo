The first recording from 1958 is no more than two school kids playing around with a tape recorder, but interesting nevertheless. The second recording is questionable and reveals a singer with a voice very much unlike the one we hear just a couple of months later. 1960 was spent mostly in St Paul, rehearsing, as it were, for Greenwich Village.\n\n2CALENDAR\n\n[TOP]\n\n3RECORDINGS\n\n1958 Bob Dylans Home in Hibbing Minnesota\n\nMay The apartment of Karen Wallace, St Paul Minnesota. \"The St Paul tape\"\n\nSeptember Most probably Dylan's apartment on 15th Avenue South, Minneapolis.\n\n\"Minnesota Party Tape\"\n\nFor details about these tapes please refer to the corresponding session pages in Still On The Road.\n\n4SONGS 1960\n\n[TOP]\n\n5SOURCES\n\n6SUGGESTED READINGS\n\n6.1General background\n\n6.2Article compilations\n\n6.3Selected articles\n\nIf You Can Tell A Bigger Lie - On The 1960 St Paul Tape - article by Paul Loeber in Fourth Time Around #1 (1982).\n\nThe Continuing Story Of The St Paul 1960 Tape -article by Gavin Diddle in Fourth Time Around $2 (1983).\n\nA Conversation with Tony Glover  by Glen Dundas, On The Tracks #2 (Fall/Winter 1993)\n\nBill Marinac Interview  by Laurie McCuistion, On The Tracks #8 (Fall 1996)\n\nBob Dylan's Boyhood Homes in Duluth and Hibbing  The Telegraph 41 (Winter 1991)\n\nClinton Heylin on The May 1960 St Paul Tape  The Telegraph 40 (Autumn 1991)\n\nDavid Moton Interview  by Lynda Knudsen, On The Tracks #16 (Spring 1999)\n\nJohn Bucklen Interview  by Dave Engel, On The Tracks #8 (Fall 1996)\n\nMy Friend Bob  John Bucklen, The Telegraph 56 (Winter 1997)\n\nThe Wanted Man Interview: Jaharana Romney (aka Bonnie Beecher, the Girl From The North Country)  The Telegraph #36"
