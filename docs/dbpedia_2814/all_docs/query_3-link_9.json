        "text": "Robert Kegan’s Meaning-making Model describes how we construct meaning and systems of thinking about ourselves and the world. This is a natural process of one’s interactive experience with the world. We will consider the implications of his ideas for adult development, especially from our reading of An Everyone Culture, where his ideas about the Socialized Mind, Self-authoring Mind, and Self-transforming Mind are applied and described in ways that are more clear and accessible. Yet, to obtain a deeper understanding of Kegan’s theory, we are exploring his earliest works. These “Minds” from An Everyone Culture, were originally described as Interpersonal, Institutional, and Interindividual evolutionary truces or balances. He avoids the word “stages.” They are numbered 3,4,5 in his original model respectively (we will see how the term \"stages\" is inadequate). Kegan’s theory draws from and integrates three different psychological traditions: 1) humanistic and existential-phenomenological, 2) neo-psychoanalytic, and 3) constructive-developmental (as well as dialectical philosophy).\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, some of the strengths of Robert Kegan's meaning-making model of development include how it:\n\nEmphasizes the role of subjective experience in development\n\nHolistic view of development including intellectual, emotional, and social aspects\n\nFocuses on the development of personal meaning rather than just knowledge acquisition\n\nRecognizes that development is a lifelong process\n\nCan be applied to individuals at all stages of development\n\nEncourages individuals to take responsibility for their own development\n\nProvides a framework for understanding and facilitating change in individuals and organizations\n\nThe Unrecognized Genius of Jean Piaget\n\nJean Piaget stands prominently in the constructive-developmental tradition that influences Kegan’s theory. Kegan draws from Piaget’s discoveries that children have fundamentally different ways of understanding the world. Let’s begin by considering Piaget’s contributions. Based on your prior studies of Piaget and this reading, discuss some of Piaget’s unrecognized genius. What aspects of Piaget’s theory does Kegan seem to draw from?\n\nBoth Kegan and Piaget emphasize fundamentally different (i.e., qualitatively different) worldviews and meaning-making systems about the physical word… stages that emerge from genetic epistemology. Likewise, for Kegan, each truce/balance represents “manifestations of a distinct and separate reality, with a logic, a consistency, and integrity all its own.” When have you appreciated that the world of a child was fundamentally different than your own?\n\nBoth Kegan and Piaget are constructive-developmental (Kegan, 1982, p. 26). Piaget brought together in one man a passion for both philosophy (the constructive them) and biology (the developmental)… from the beginning, Piaget maintained that he was not a psychologist himself, but a genetic epistemologist (development and construction brought together)\n\nThe world of a baby before object permanence\n\nThe preoperational child’s fantasy and use of language\n\nThe preoperational child’s lack of conservation\n\nThe child’s inability to consider hypotheticals that contradict the concrete, physical world\n\nStage Subject (“Structure”) Object (“Content”) Sensorimotor Action-sensations reflexes None Preoperational Perceptions Action-sensations reflexes Concrete operational Reversibilities (the “actual”) Perceptions Formal operational Hypothetico-deduction (the “possible”) Reversibilities (the “actual”)\n\n“According to Piaget, development is driven by the process of equilibration. Equilibration encompasses assimilation (i.e., people transform incoming information so that it fits within their existing thinking) and accommodation (i.e, people adapt their thinking to incoming information). Equilibration (and assimilation, accommodation)- from https://books.byui.edu/-onn\n\nPiaget suggested that equilibration takes place in three phases:\n\nChildren are satisfied with their mode of thought and therefore are in a state of equilibrium.\n\nThey become aware of the shortcomings in their existing thinking and are dissatisfied (i.e., are in a state of disequilibration and experience cognitive conflict).\n\nThey adopt a more sophisticated mode of thought that eliminates the shortcomings of the old one (i.e., reach a more stable equilibrium).”\n\nWhat we can draw from Piaget are two points: “First, that each stage is plausibly the consequence of a given subject-object balance or evolutionary truce. Second, the process of movement is plausibly the evolutionary motion of differentiation (or emergence from embeddedness) and reintegration (relation to, rather than embeddedness in, the world)” (Kegan, 1982, p. 39)\n\nActive Learning Activities\n\nWas the Guinness Book of World Records popular when you were a kid? When was this book popular? Do you remember what grade it was? Why might that have been the case according to Piaget?\n\nConsider how more advanced, abstract understandings are not possible for people to have without their first having less advanced, more concrete experiences. Can you think of an example?\n\nConsider the example of Langer: The child had a large number of black and white beads that are all wooden. If you ask children put all the black beads on one side of the table and all the wooden beads on the other. How might young children age 4 respond? How might children age 9 respond?\n\nKegan’s Orders of Consciousness\n\nIncorporative Balance/Truce/Plateau 0- (Infancy)\n\nSubject: Reflexes (the infants are their reflexes and their environment: mother etc)\n\nObject: Nothing\n\nIn their beginnings, babies are all subjective and have really no appreciation of anything objective at all, and therefore no real self-awareness. This is to say, at first, babies have little idea how to interpret anything, and the only perspective they have with which to interpret things is their own scarcely developed perspective. They can recognize parent's faces and the like, but this sort of recognition should not be confused with babies being able to appreciate that parents are separate creatures with their own needs. This key recognition doesn't occur for years.\n\nThe sense of self is not developed at this point in time. There is no self to speak of because there is no distinction occurring yet between self and other. To the baby, there is not any reason to ask the question, \"Who am I?\" because the baby's mind is nothing more and nothing less than the experience of its senses as it moves about. In an important sense, the baby is embedded in its sensory experience and has no other awareness.\n\nAt some point, it occurs to the baby that it has reflexes that it can use and sensory tools that it can experience. Reflex and sensation are thus the first mental objects; the first things that are understood to be distinct components of the self. The sense of self emerges from the knowledge that there are things in the world that are not self (like reflexes and senses); things that I am not.\n\n\"Rather than literally being my reflexes, I now have them, and \"I\" am something other. \"I\" am that which coordinates or mediates the reflexes...\"\n\nImpulsive Balance/Truce/Plateau 1 (Early Childhood)\n\nSubject: Impulses, impulses and perceptions\n\nObject: Reflexes\n\nKegan correspondingly refers to this second period of social appreciation development as Impulsive, to suggest that the child is now embedded in impulses – which are those things that coordinate reflexes. The sense of self at this balance of life would be comfortable saying something like, \"hungry\", or \"sleepy\", being fully identified with these hungers. Though babies are now aware that they can take action to fulfill a need, they still are not clear that other people exist yet as independent creatures. From the perspective of the Impulsive mind, a parent is merely another reflex that can be brought to bear to satisfy impulses.\n\nImperial Balance/Truce/Plateau: Balance 2 (Adolescence)\n\nSubject: Needs, interests, desires (take others' feelings into account)\n\nObject: Impulses, perceptions\n\nThe child as \"little dictator\" is born. In the prior impulsive self, the self literally is nothing more and nothing less than a set of needs. There isn't anyone \"there\" having those needs yet. The needs alone are all that exists. As awareness continues to rise, the child now starts to become aware that \"it\" is the very thing that has the needs. Because the child is now aware that it has needs (rather than is needs), it also starts to become aware that it can consciously manipulate things to get its needs satisfied. The impulsive child was also manipulative, perhaps, but in a more unaware animal manner. The imperial child is not yet aware that other people have needs too. It only knows at this balance that it has needs, and it doesn't hesitate to express them.\n\nInterpersonal Balance/Truce/Plateau: Balance 3: (Late adolescence, Emerging adulthood, Early adulthood) (SOCIALIZED MIND)\n\nAdults in this Order: 58%\n\nSubject: Interpersonal relationships, mutuality\n\nObject: Needs, interests, desires\n\n\"I\" no longer am my needs (no longer the imperial I); rather I have them. In having them I can now coordinate, or integrate, one need system with another, and in so doing, I bring into being that need-mediating reality which we refer to when we speak of mutuality.\"\n\nInstitutional Balance/Truce/Plateau Balance 4 (Adulthood) (SELF-AUTHORING MIND)\n\nAdults in this Order: 35%\n\nSubject: Authorship, identity, ideology\n\nObject: Interpersonal relationships, mutuality\n\nAs the sense of self continues to develop, at some point one becomes aware that a guiding principle can be established which helps determine which set of needs should take precedence under particular circumstances. This is the first moment that the individual can be said to have values, or commitments to ideas and beliefs and principles which are larger and more permanent than its own passing whims and fears.\n\nThose who achieve this level of social maturity understand the need for laws and for ethical codes that work to govern everyone's behavior. Some individuals will not grasp why these things are important and should not simply be disregarded when they are inconvenient.\n\nInterindividual Balance/Truce/Plateau: Balance 5 (Late Adulthood) (SELF-TRANSFORMING MIND)\n\nAdults in this Order: 1%\n\nSubject: \"The intern penetrability of self-systems\"\n\nObject: Authorship, identity, ideology\n\nThe next evolution of self-understanding occurs when one starts to realize that there is more than one way of being \"fair\" or \"honest\" or \"brave\" in the world. Whereas before, in the interpersonal mindset, there is only one possible right way to interpret a social event (e.g., in accordance with one's own value system), a newly developed InterIndividiual mindset starts to recognize a diversity of ways that someone might act and still be acting in accordance with a coherent value system (though not necessarily one's own value system).\n\nOther Concepts in Kegan’s Developmental Model\n\nHuman “Being” is Human Meaning-Making\n\nMeaning-making is part of human nature. Being is a verb = making meaning out of experiences, organizing and constructing coherent systems of understanding out of our experiences.\n\np. 44-45\n\n“I use the word “meaning” to refer to this simultaneously epistemological and ontological activity; it is about knowing and being, about theory-making and investments and commitments of the self”\n\nConfirmation bias might suggest that the world is not inherently good or bad but we construct it to be.\n\nConstructive-Developmental\n\nWe create or construct meaning. Meaning is not independent, objective, or inherent; meaning is not something out there to be discovered.\n\nMeaning is constructed through interacting experience with the world (culture, etc.). The person creates their world and the world creates the person (p. 114)\n\nWhat is “most important for us to know in understanding one another is not the other’s experience, but what the experience means to him or her” (p. 113).\n\nIn order to understand one another, we need to understand the underlying logic, or what Kegan calls “psychologic,” used to shape meaning.\n\nDevelopment is Evolutionary Motion\n\nOur development is in constant motion, moving, vacillating from states of dynamic balance. Development is never static. It is always living moving.\n\nWe are always trying to find balance in our worldview and meaning making, systems\n\np. 41 Kegan describes how preoperational children evolve not because they listen more carefully to tutoring grownups or something unfolds within them, but “because of their own activity in the world, evolutionary activity.” Kegan calls this evolution of meaning.\n\nSimilarly, Edward Thorndike’s Law of Effect is basically natural selection applied to behavior. Those behaviors that are well-suited to the environment survive and perpetuate while those behaviors that are ill-suited to the environment become extinct.\n\nActivity in the world is evolutionary activity.\n\nOur Consciousness can be Characterized in Terms of Subject & Object\n\nConsciousness could be understood as one’s relationship between self and world (self and other).\n\nSubjective being unable to understand what you look like to someone else is the essence and definition of what it means to be subjective about yourself.\n\nObject is being able to see a new perspective, reflect (or operate) on our own perspective.\n\nThe root (ject) refers to a motion, an activity rather than a thing – more particularly to throw. Thus, object suggests the motion or consequence of “thrown from” or “thrown away from” (Kegan, 1982, p. 76).\n\nSubject is the embeddedness which we cannot operate on / or see a new perspective. Kid crying because can’t have toy. They are their desires, have not realized that they have desires.\n\nSome Dialectic Aspects of Robert Kegan’s Model (inspired by pgs 44-45) Me Not Me/World Self Other Familiar & Known Unfamiliar & Unknown Assimilation Accommodation Self-preservation Self-transformation Closed Open to new possibility \"All limit\" (no hope) \"All possibility\" (hope)\n\n“These periods of dynamic balance amounts to a kind of evolutionary truce: ... The guiding principle of such a truce - the point that is always at issue and is renegotiated in the transition to each new balance - is what, from the point of view of the organism, is composed as object and what as subject.”\n\nHumans are “Embedduals”\n\nThe term embeddual implies that we are usually embedded in our own meaning-making systems (evolutionary balances) that we cannot separate ourselves from them; it is our own consciousness. Understandably, individuals are embedded in and subject to their own consciousness and meaning-making systems.\n\nConsider how high schoolers identify with cliques or groups and stereotype others by their friends and groups.\n\nEach Balance/truce is a Temporary Balance of Subject-Object Relations\n\nOne’s developmental evolution can be marked by their ability to operate on their previously embedded experience and worldview.\n\nOur state of balance becomes imbalanced when we have experiences that contradict our worldviews. We become balanced when we repudiate new understandings, return to our prior worldview, or push through difficult uncertainties and create a new meaningful organization.\n\nIn a new worldview, meanings that were once subject have become object. Subject means that one is embedded in their own worldview; they cannot see it as a worldview.\n\nThis ability to operate on meanings and experiences that were once subject is a qualitatively different experience of self and world. It is a different world.\n\n“We have begun to see not only how this subject object balance can be spoken of as a deep structure in meaning-evolution, but also that there is something regular about the process of evolution itself. Growth always involves a process of differentiation, of the emergence from embeddedness, thus creating out of the former subject a new object to be taken by the new subjectivity.”\n\nThe Holding Environment (aka Culture of Embeddedness) Simultaneously Fulfills 3 Functions in Development- Confirmation, Contradiction, and Continuity (see roughly pages 149-156)\n\nHolding environment describes the system that surrounds each embedded\n\nThe first holding environment is the womb, and each holding environment can be examined in terms of confirmation (holding on), contradiction (letting go), and continuity (staying put).\n\nConfirmation (holding on)\n\nThis is holding on to the current worldview and embeddedness\n\nThe environment embraces, accepts, recognizes and confirms that this is how the person is and what they have become\n\nThis is the first requirement of care and responsiveness\n\nContradiction (letting go)\n\nContradicting one’s worldview, pushing for change(s) with demandingness\n\nSomething is not working effectively like it once was, asking someone to grow up take more responsibility\n\nMore effective when there is also confirmation; e.g., with children you still can accept them as they are, you just ask them to do a little bit more to be a little better. In other words, you invite them to grow and develop.\n\nContinuity (staying put)\n\nProviding the familiarity of prior “stages” (i.e., orders of consciousness) and understandings without a complete return to prior world.\n\nFrederick Leboyer’s Birth Without Violence\n\nNatural Transition Objects for Continuity\n\nObjects refer to “bridges” which can be a person, a comfort blanket, a love note. These objects or bridges help one to continue with development\n\nNatural Therapy: “Relationships Heal”\n\n“Who comes into a person’s life may be the single greatest factor of influence to what that life becomes.” It is our recruitability, as much as our knowledge of what to do once drawn, that makes us of value in our caring for another’s development, whether the caring is the professional caring of teacher, therapist, pastor, or mental health worker, or the more spontaneous exercises of careful parenthood, friendship, and love.\n\nFor Kegan (1982), psychology has become a secular religion and the practice of psychotherapy has become the “new priestly rite,” the impression often conveyed to the public is that the solution to life’s ills and suffering could be found in psychotherapy. Kegan suggests, rather than placing the practice of psychotherapy as the touchstone for all considerations of help, we ought to first look into the meaning and makeup those instances that occur in nature. This is what Kegan calls “natural therapy,” which offers a new guide to therapeutic practice by exposing some of the details of those [naturally occurring] interactions and make it possible to replicate the experience in therapy. In short, relationships are integral in therapy. Indeed, as far back as 1977, outcome research studies of psychotherapy have indicated that successful therapy is due more to the qualities of the therapist and not therapeutic techniques or therapy itself or (Smith & Glass, 1977).\n\nWhen in counseling, Kegan views his clients not as “patients” or “sick persons” or even “persons with problems,” but from his innermost conviction he views them as “persons evolving.” This is a significant shift from the contemporary conceptualizations of suffering that are assumed in psychotherapy. Any movement which sets us against the movement of life of which we are a part, in which we are ultimately implicated, to which we are finally obligated, will cause us pain (p. 266). Kegan purports that in pain, suffering or “crisis,” we have options. We can either learn from them, or not, and he relates this assertion to the Chinese character of crisis, which can mean “danger” or “opportunity” (p. 261). For Kegan, grief, loss, and suffering may bring about death of an old worldview, from which one was embedded, a worldview that no longer works for one’s developmental motion and evolution. But “death” of the old worldview causes an emergence of a new worldview and a new developmental evolution. Challenges are a catalyst toward growth (p. 262). According to Kegan’s developmental model, experiences (good or bad, easy or difficult) can be better understood as it is related to the processes of “growth, change and transition” From this perspective, suffering is not sufficiently understood as illness (i.e. depression, anxiety) or misfortune, but better understood as a catalyst toward growth.\n\nSome Metaphors and Examples\n\nTree of Wisdom\n\nThere is a sculpture called the Tree of Wisdom at BYU Provo that Brother Skalski really enjoyed during his studies there. After studying Robert Kegan’s Meaning Making Model of Development, consider what is similar about this Tree of Wisdom. Use this Tree of Wisdom link and imagine walking around this sculpture to make connections with your studies of Kegan’s Model.\n\nDoes this remind you about an experience in your own life?\n\nThomas, the Doubter\n\nMany have a negative view of Thomas, as Thomas the doubter. This is a rather simplified caricature of this noble apostle. He could not really denounce the accounts and testimonies of Christ’s appearances. Rather, there was something about resurrection, with its corporeal, glorified body that was different than the restorations to life to which he was a witness. He denied this new and unfamiliar thing; it was too revolutionary for the way he thought about the world, universe, and himself, and he resisted. We should be more kind with our thoughts about Thomas. In some experiences of our lives, we are no different and resistance is natural.\n\nConsider your own experience. Can you relate?\n\nFlatland\n\nFlatland by A Square (Edwin A. Abbot) is a classic! Flatland: A Romance in Many Dimensions is available for free. It is a short and humorous book that uses points, lines, and both 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional shapes to describe increasing dimensions and complexity. It encourages consideration about how God could exist in another dimension, almost totally foreign to everyone.\n\nHow is this like Kegan’s Meaning-making Model of Development? In Flatland, like Kegan, each meaningful understanding of the world is essentially its own world or dimension.\n\nMy Own Research\n\nMy own research has focused on life-altering transformation, and we will examine it later in the semester. One on my participants described the psychological conflict he was experiencing, and how he was holding on until he was compelled to let go of his conception: “And so I was almost just compelled to let go, to let it go… because if I didn’t, if I held on to that, it was just going to destroy me.” This quote captures the developmental motion of our meaning-making experience.\n\nCan you relate to being compelled to grow in similar ways?\n\nActive Learning Activity\n\nMatch each interview excerpt with the correction coding according to Kegan’s developmental plateaus. In each, it is important to not just focus on the content (e.g., a person can speak about relationships at any stage but is not necessarily caused by relationships like one in the socialized (interpersonal) mind). You should try to focus most on what the person takes responsibility for.\n\nThese are the possible answers (i.e. the correction coding):\n\nSocialized mind with aspects of the Imperial mind remaining\n\nSocialized mind with aspects of the Self-authoring mind emerging\n\nSelf-authoring mind\n\nSelf-transforming mind with remnants of the Self-Authoring mind remaining\n\nInterview Excerpts"
