It is user friendly and intuitive, which I appreciate.\"\n\nDavid Jenkins\n\nCreator, Showrunner, Writer (Our Flag Means Death - HBOMax, People of Earth - TBS)\n\n\"Invaluable. It's the only way to keep track of what's actually happening in the industry. One of the most useful tools when building a production.\"\n\nMarshall Persinger\n\nProducer, Showrunner (The Good Lord Bird - Showtime, The Alienist - TNT, Rectify - SundanceTV, Army Wives - Lifetime)\n\n\"I am consistently impressed at how Luminate Film & TV stays on top of the TV and streaming business. As soon a network or streamer begins developing a new project, Luminate Film & TV, knows everything there is to know about it. It must be witchcraft!\"\n\nGlenn Geller\n\nHead of Television, Skybound Entertainment\n\n\"Luminate Film & TV is the Bloomberg of the Entertainment Industry! They are the-must-have resource for any producer working in TV & film.\"\n\nEli Attie\n\nCo-Executive Producer, Writer (BILLIONS - Showtime, ROSEWOOD - FOX, HOUSE - FOX)\n\n\"Luminate Film & TV is an incredible database to have at your fingertips -- it's the GPS you always wanted for Hollywood itself. It's a pretty great way to orient yourself in this dizzying business, and -- just as critical for a writer-producer -- it's a great way to procrastinate as well.\"\n\nAndré Vargas\n\nChief Data Officer, CAA\n\n\"As a company that cares deeply about diversity, equity, and inclusion, we applaud the work that Luminate Film & TV has done to create a more inclusive data platform,” said André Vargas, Head of Data at CAA. “This data will be used to help the industry better reflect the stories, contributions and work of underrepresented communities and will capture important metrics that have been overlooked across entertainment for far too long.\"\n\nKamala Avila-Salmon\n\nHead of Inclusive Content, Lionsgate\n\n\"At a time when the representation of diverse experiences, cultures, and voices in entertainment matter more than ever, it is vital to find reliable information on the diversity of talent with accuracy and nuance. Tools like Luminate Film & TV are critical in the push towards more equitable opportunities for underrepresented communities.\"\n\nSamata Narra\n\nFormer SVP Equity & Inclusion, WarnerMedia\n\n\"As the landscape of equity and inclusion broadens across categories, leveraging Luminate Film & TV's recently enhanced DEI data which includes not only expanded options for ethnicity and countries of heritage, but also gender and LGBTQ+ identities is a valuable resource. WarnerMedia looks forward to continued partnership with VBI to be on the forefront of supporting the push towards equitable opportunities for underrepresented communities.\""
