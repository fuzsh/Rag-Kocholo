        "text": "Turning a play into a movie is a little like translating a work of literature from one language to another. There are certain concepts, subtleties and innuendos that seem effortless in the original but are difficult to render in another idiom. So it was when ''A Chorus Line,'' that prize-winning, innovative, consummate piece of musical theater that has broken all records for longevity on Broadway, made the leap from stage to screen.\n\nThe film, which stars Michael Douglas as Zach and Alyson Reed as Cassie, opens Tuesday at Loews Paramount, 34th Street Showplace and New York Twin, 10 years and seven months after its stage premiere. Its voyage from stage to screen was one of the bumpiest, its route one of the most circuitous in the history of New York-Hollywood collaboration. Along the way, talents no less impressive than Joseph Papp and Michael Bennett, the original producer and director-choreographer, and such proposed directors as Mike Nichols and Sidney Lumet, fell by the wayside or decided the destination was unreachable. Aside from financial problems, there was a central creative roadblock that confronted all the screenwriters and directors: how to take a work whose ambiance - the intense closed environment of a darkened theater - is central to its impact and visually open it up enough to make a film that is more than a pale celluloid imitation.\n\nPart of the play's dynamic is that it allows the audience to enter a private backstage world where it has the illusion that it can actually witness an audition. The 16 ''gypsies'' - those uniquely American chorus-line dancers who are required to sing, dance and act equally well - seem to be emotionally stripped naked as the omnipotent director, removing the theater's fourth wall, allows the audience to feel like a participant in deciding who will be accepted and who will be rejected.\n\nThe challenge of the film was to re-create that atmosphere, to pull a fast-moving, visually interesting, contemporary movie out of a highly theatrical play conceived 10 years ago and performed on a bare stage. To do this required making changes, as every director and screenwriter who attempted it found out.\n\nBut even Sir Richard Attenborough, the film's director, who tackled as ambitious and difficult a project as ''Gandhi,'' must have had some hesitation about tampering with what has been a winning combination on Broadway for more than a decade.\n\n''I was overwhelmed by it, a bit overawed,'' the British director said. ''I knew the efforts made by some great talents before it came to me. This is a much more difficult film to do than 'Gandhi.' If you have an exotic image of the Himalayas and you put 15,000 people in front at their base with a little chap waving a stick, you've got a great shot. If you put 16 people on a white line in front of brick wall, the problems are Gargantuan, Himalayan. But I accepted it as a kind of Englishman's revenge,'' he joked. ''Americans had the effrontery to put George Bernard Shaw to music, so I had the gall to step into Broadway and put my limey fingers on it.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
