        "text": "We may already be more than halfway through 2024, but the year's biggest new TV shows are still coming thick and fast. The next few weeks alone sees Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power return for season 2, as well as two big franchise spin-offs: Colin Farrell reprises his The Batman role in The Penguin and Kathryn Hahn is back as her fan-favorite WandaVision character in the MCU's Agatha All Along.\n\nLooking further ahead, the winter months hold everything from Squid Game season 2 to Bene Gesserit-centered prequel Dune: Prophecy is set to hit Max and Jude Law's introduction to the Star Wars universe in Skeleton Crew. So, for all that and more, scroll on through our guide to all the best new TV shows coming your way on Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and more.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power season 2\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power season 2 release date: August 29, 2024\n\nAvailable on: Prime Video\n\nThe next season of The Rings of Power is due to arrive on Prime Video this year. Per the official synopsis, Sauron returns, but, after being \"cast out by Galadriel, the rising Dark Lord must now rely on his own cunning to rebuild his strength and oversee the creation of the Rings of Power, which will allow him to bind all the peoples of Middle-earth to his sinister will. Friendships are strained, kingdoms begin to fracture, and the forces of good will struggle now more than ever.\"\n\nAgatha All Along\n\nAgatha release date: September 18, 2024\n\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\n\nAfter multiple name changes (Agatha: House of Harkness, Agatha: Coven of Chaos, and Agatha: Darkhold Diaries are no more) and a delay from winter 2023, the MCU series is now set for release in early fall 2024. Kathryn Hahn reprises her role as the titular witch first seen in WandaVision, and she's joined by new cast members Aubrey Plaza, Joe Locke, and Patti LuPone.\n\nThe Penguin\n\nThe Penguin release date: September 19, 2024\n\nAvailable on: Max in the US, NOW in the UK\n\nThe Batman spin-off series The Penguin will air later this year, and will focus on Colin Farrell's brutal antagonist. Set in Gotham's underbelly, the show will track Penguin's plan to take over in the mob power vacuum after the death of Carmine Falcone. This one arrives ahead of The Batman 2 in 2025 so should be enough to tide us over until Robert Pattinson's caped crusader returns.\n\nArcane season 2\n\nArcane season 2 release date: November 2024\n\nAvailable on: Netflix\n\nArcane finally returns to Netflix this year with its second season. The show will pick up with League of Legends champions, and sisters, Vi and Jinx as they head in very different directions. The first trailer for the new season promised plenty of drama ahead, as well as some gorgeous animation when the animated show returns.\n\nDune: Prophecy\n\nDune: Prophecy release date: November 2024\n\nAvailable on: Max in the US, NOW in the UK\n\nAfter the success of Dune: Part Two, a new prequel series is on its way to the small screen this year. The show will explore the origins of the all-powerful Bene Gesserit, 10,000 years before the events of Dune, following Valya (Emily Watson) and Tula (Olivia Williams) Harkonnen as they establish the sisterhood in an attempt to combat forces that threaten the future of humankind. Dune director Denis Villeneuve is on board as an executive producer.\n\nCreature Commandoes\n\nCreature Commandos release date: December 2024\n\nAvailable on: Max in the US, NOW in the UK\n\nCreature Commandos kicks off James Gunn and Peter Safran's new reign at DC. The animated show follows a black ops team of monsters brought together by Amanda Waller. Gunn is writing all seven episodes, and it's got a stellar cast including David Harbour, Indira Varma, and Alan Tudyk.\n\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\n\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew release date: December 3, 2024\n\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\n\nSkeleton Crew, starring Jude Law, takes place in the same part of the Star Wars timeline as The Mandalorian, and Dave Filoni said at Star Wars Celebration that the shows will all intertwine in \"weird ways.\" Spider-Man: No Way Home director Jon Watts is also involved with the show, which is set to arrive this year.\n\nSquid Game season 2\n\nSquid Game season 2 release date: December 26, 2024\n\nAvailable on: Netflix\n\nKorean hit Squid Game is officially returning to Netflix in 2024. The next installment will reunite us with winner Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) â€“ and he's on a quest for revenge. Plot details are otherwise quite thin on the ground, but we do know that we can expect some new games and characters in the new season.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nDaredevil: Born Again release date: 2025\n\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\n\nCharlie Cox's Daredevil is getting another series, having returned in Spider-Man: No Way Home and going on to appear in She-Hulk and Echo, though this will be his first-ever starring role as part of the MCU. Plot details are scarce, though we do know that Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin returns and that the series will be 18 episodes long.\n\nHowever, we'd say this one may still be a way off as even though filming began in March 2023, it's hit some big delays. Marvel has removed the current creative team and is in the process of replacing them.\n\nIronheart\n\nIronheart release date: September 3, 2025\n\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\n\nNot much is known yet about Ironheart, featuring Dominique Thorne's Riri Williams following in the footsteps of her idol, Tony Stark. The character first appeared in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."
