        "text": "Members of the Canadian Orpheus Male Choir (COMC) know first-hand that participating in a choral singing group can do a world of good. But you don’t have to take our word for it…\n\nAccording to Chorus America, “Greater civic involvement, discipline, and teamwork are just a few of the attributes fostered by singing with a choral ensemble.”\n\nScientific research has yielded evidence to back that up, and then some. Some of this research is described in All together now three evolutionary perks of singing (Dec. 2014), which asks, “So does singing in a group provide specific and tangible benefits, or is it merely a curious ability that provides entertainment through creative expression?” The answer is… Group singing provides many, very tangible benefits.\n\nThe world’s most famous and popular language is music. Psy\n\nAs society has grown increasingly reliant upon telecommunications, many people have noticed a decline in the sense of belonging that is often a hallmark of a deeply satisfying quality of life — something online friendships and communities simply cannot supply on a long-term basis. But choral singing is an activity that can contribute to a personal sense of fulfillment like no other.\n\nRecently (Jan. 2015), Zosia Bielski interviewed author Emily White about her new book titled Count Me In: How I Stepped Off the Sidelines, Created Connection, and Built a Fuller, Richer, More Lived-in Life. In Bielski’s article, White explains, “… we need a public, community dimension to our lives as well.”\n\nChoral singing offers such a dimension, in addition to other dividends.\n\nAccording to a July 2014 review by Nathalie Atkinson, a film titled Alive Inside is the documentary story of Music & Memory, an organization that battles a broken healthcare system to show that music can help heal memory loss…\n\nSinging with our eyes on the conductor ensures our memories are exercised regularly!\n\nWe enjoy singing together, and the pleasure our music brings to others is equally rewarding. Research from across the globe has shown that singing offers benefits to a person’s sense of well-being, not to mention social life… The BBC News reported on a scientific study in 2011 which suggested “music releases a chemical in the brain that has a key role in setting good moods.”\n\nIn the Huffington Post (Feb. 2015), Jill Suttie highlights five ways music improves our health, stating “In studies with adult choir singers, singing the same piece of music tended to synch up their breathing and heart rates, producing a group-wide calming effect.”\n\nWe certainly recommend it. The following articles will tell you more about the power of music… Better yet, join the COMC and find out for yourself.\n\nNeath Port Talbot Hospital hopes to bring back memories with singing (2016)\n\nCommunity choirs growing as members reap health benefits (2016)\n\nSinger sees ‘beautiful spark’ in children she teaches at Regent Park School of Music (2016)\n\nHow Does Your Brain Follow the Music? (2015)\n\n13 Amazing Things Science Discovered About Music in 2015\n\nFeeling Isolated? Try Choral Singing (2015)\n\nThe Shower Habit That’s Scientifically Proven to Stop Stress (2015)\n\nMusic education is vital in today’s pressured world (2015)"
