        "text": "Simmie non-binary soprano who is looking to change the narrative by creating art that questions life and power. Simmie encourages audiences to not be afraid of being uncomfortable, because that is when the best learning happens. Their “why” is because they have something to say. Simmie sees how the world can be improved for all people to live equitably, and they stand strong in these beliefs. Equity amongst people, kindness and compassion, learning from those we don’t understand and fighting for those who cannot fight for themselves. The best way they know how to evoke change is with music. They know this is possible because music has changed them. It has changed their opinions, views, the way they see the world. It is the best way they know to change the world around me. A “why” is subject to change and already has many times, but Simmie has found the importance of their “why” right now.\n\nCanadian pianist Joy Lee enjoys a multi-faceted career as a collaborator, teacher, soloist, adjudicator, and scholar.
