As a renowned conductor, performer, and educator, Thomas has worked extensively with choirs across the country and is highly-regarded as being a dynamic, creative and impactful artistic leader. We are confident that he will not only build on the solid foundation that the choir has established throughout almost 60 years of producing high-calibre choral presentations, but he will also lead the choir through new and unexpected artistic avenues and collaborations.\n\nPraised for his innovative and eclectic programming as well as his dynamic presence on the podium, Thomas Burton is in demand nationally as a guest conductor, clinician and educator. In addition to his new position as Artistic Director of the Orpheus Choir, Thomas Burton is also Conductor of the Tenor/Bass Chorus at the University of Toronto, and Artistic Director of Durham Regionâ€™s RESOUND Choir.\n\nRead more about Thomas Burton here.
