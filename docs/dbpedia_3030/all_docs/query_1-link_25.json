        "text": "EVERYONE was convinced that ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' could never be tamed for the screen, but Mike Nichols turned it into a group triumph for himself, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Though it was generally agreed that ''Hair'' would not work as a film, Milos Forman transformed it into one of the most original pieces of musical cinema of the last 20 years.\n\nThen they said that ''A Chorus Line'' couldn't be done - and this time they were right.\n\nAt one point or another in the last 10 years, just about everybody who is anybody in show business was asked to take charge of the film adaptation of this innovative, sensationally successful Broadway musical, which opened on Oct. 25, 1975, at the Shubert Theater and is still there - the longest running show in Broadway history.\n\nJoseph Papp and Michael Bennett, the producer-director team responsible for the show, declined to work on the movie, and so, eventually, did Mr. Nichols and Sidney Lumet, among others. The job was finally accepted by Richard Attenborough at the time he'd just won the Oscar as the director of ''Gandhi.''\n\nMr. Attenborough is listed as the director of ''A Chorus Line,'' but what he seems actually to have done is to act as the escort to the screen of a reasonable facsimile of the show, not noticing that it was dying en route.\n\nIt's evident that Mr. Attenborough understood the problems facing him and his associates, including Arnold Schulman, who wrote the film's screenplay. He's avoided the elephantine style by which he inflated ''Oh! What a Lovely War,'' Joan Littlewood's small, satirical theatrical improvisation, into a huge, over-decorated, over-orchestrated, all-star musical epic. This ''Chorus Line'' is no ''Gandhi''-dances. The physical scale remains comparatively intimate, but the exuberance has gone.\n\nIn the theater, ''A Chorus Line'' unfolds inside an unadorned backstage setting with all of the spontaneity of the sort of group audition it records. The theater audience is in the privileged position of sitting in on an open call for dancers - ''gypsies'' - for the chorus of a new musical show. As the audition proceeds, the dancers become identifiable personalities, interacting with each other and with Zach, the show's no-nonsense choreographer, who remains a mostly unseen presence, a voice heard over the public-address system.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
