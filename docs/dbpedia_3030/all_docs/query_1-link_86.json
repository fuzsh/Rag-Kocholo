        "text": "A significant feature of the global Jamat’s celebration of Mawlana Hazar Imam’s Golden Jubilee was the commissioning of a range of high-quality memorabilia, which members of the Jamat can retain as souvenirs of this historic occasion.\n\nThe Golden Jubilee Games: Celebration Through Sport was a global Ismaili sports festival held in Nairobi, Kenya from 24 – 29 June 2008. The Games attracted competitors and spectators from more than 20 countries, who participated in a celebration of excellence in sport, as well as a variety of social and cultural activities.\n\nMawlana Hazar Imam completed his 50th year as the Imam of the Ismaili community on 11 July 2007. Fifty years ago, at the age of 20, he succeeded his grandfather, Mawlana Sultan Mahomed Shah, as the 49th hereditary Imam (spiritual leader) of the Shia Ismaili Muslims."
