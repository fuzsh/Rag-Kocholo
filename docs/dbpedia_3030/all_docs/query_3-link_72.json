But with any collection on the streaming giant, you can expect to spend some time searching to find something that really appeals to you. To help you out, we’ve narrowed down the library in this list that we update monthly.\n\nThis June, Will Smith’s Oscar-nominated performance as legendary boxer Muhammad Ali in biopic Ali hits the platform, while critical indie hit Tangerine also joins the list.\n\nLooking for more films and shows that illustrate the Black experience?

Beginning in 1964, the film grapples with Cassius Clay’s explosion onto the national sports scene after winning Olympic Gold. The brash, confident activist Clay ruffles many feathers in the establishment who don’t appreciate the Black man’s politics or his unapologetic belief that he’s the greatest boxer of all time.\n\nTangerine (2015)\n\n86%\n\nr\n\n87m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nKitana Kiki Rodriguez, Mya Taylor, Karren Karagulian\n\nDirected by\n\nSean Baker\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nIn her debut role, Kitana Kiki Rodriguez stars as Sin-Dee, a sex worker who returns to Los Angeles after 28 days in lockup. Discovering that her pimp boyfriend (James Ransone) hasn’t been faithful in that time, Sin-Dee and her best friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) set out to get to the bottom of the rumor. Tangerine is a funny, dark odyssey into the many subcultures and experiences of life in Los Angeles.\n\nShirley (2024)\n\n57%\n\npg-13\n\n117m\n\nGenre\n\nHistory, Drama\n\nStars\n\nRegina King, Lance Reddick, Terrence Howard\n\nDirected by\n\nJohn Ridley\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nRegina King stars in this biopic about Shirley Chisholm, America’s first Black congresswoman and the first Black woman to run for president. After a trailblazing run to Congress, Chisholm wasted hardly any time, gearing up for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination. Although Chisholm didn’t win, she mounted a competitive bid, tearing down many doubts and barriers in Washington for those who followed in her footsteps.\n\nThe Best of Enemies (2019)\n\n49%\n\npg-13\n\n133m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, History\n\nStars\n\nTaraji P. Henson, Sam Rockwell, Babou Ceesay\n\nDirected by\n\nRobin Bissell\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nBased on a true story, The Best of Enemies centers on a community summit about the desegregation of schools in Durham, North Carolina, in the summer of 1971. On one side, Ann Atwater (The Color Purple‘s Taraji P. Henson) fights for the rights of Black students. On the other, local Ku Klux Klan leader C.P.

A down-on-her-luck New York playwright who can’t gain enough traction because her most recent play doesn’t emphasize “Black suffering” enough, Radha unearths a new artistic path after hearing rap music outside her apartment walls. Putting her playwright aspirations on the back burner, albeit only for the time being, Radha teams with a music producer and DJ named D (Oswin Benjamin) to record her first series of rap songs — tunes with a metaphoric focus on Radha’s hardships as a Black artist. An authentic and moving portrayal of life as a starving artist, The Forty-Year-Old Version seems to allude to a forthcoming prolific career from its writer-director-actor. We can only wait and see what Radha’s filmic future may bring.\n\nThe Forty-Year-Old Version | Official Trailer | Netflix\n\nTwo Distant Strangers (2021)\n\n6.9/10\n\nr\n\n32m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nJoey Bada$$, Andrew Howard, Zaria Simone\n\nDirected by\n\nMartin Desmond Roe, Travon Free\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nCarter James (Joey Bada$$) is a New York cartoonist who needs to get home to his hungry dog after a date night out.

Buckle up for this profanity-laced tell-all: It’s a raw and honest portrait of an essential entertainment figurehead.

When a tragedy befalls CJ, she and Sebastian will do whatever it takes to turn back time to save someone they love (and have lost). Seamlessly blending science fiction and social drama, See You Yesterday is led by powerful and endearing performances from its leads while never straying from its racial undertones.\n\nBecoming (2020)\n\n66%\n\n6.8/10\n\npg\n\n89m\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary\n\nStars\n\nMichelle Obama, Barack Obama, Phoebe Robinson\n\nDirected by\n\nNadia Hallgren\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nIf you find that you’re missing the grace, compassion, and normalcy of the Obama administration, Becoming is a refreshing watch. A companion to Michelle Obama’s autobiography, Becoming sheds light on her journey to become America’s first African American First Lady. While it’s not quite as personal as some might like, Becoming is nonetheless an endearing, often provocative discussion of race, hope, and connecting with those of different backgrounds and beliefs. It’s a keen reminder that leaders can inspire by positive example.\n\n13th (2016)\n\n83%\n\n8.2/10\n\nr\n\n100m\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary\n\nStars\n\nJelani Cobb, Angela Davis, Henry Louis Gates, Jr.\n\nDirected by\n\nAva DuVernay\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n“If you’re in the prison business, you don’t want reform. You may say you do. But you don’t.” Ava DuVernay’s eye-opening, at times harrowing, 13th is a pivotal documentary that explores the centuries-old criminalization of disenfranchised African American communities, but by way of tracing the steps of American racism to its very roots. Over the course of the film, DuVernay and many activists, lawmakers, and academics unfold decade after decade of politically motivated legislation, and the lobbyists often behind these laws, that have led not only to the privatization of the American prison system but also to the staggeringly disproportionate incarceration of millions of African American men and women. The film can be difficult to watch, but DuVernay’s grim realizations are made to be blatant. What is also apparent is that there is still hope for fundamental change, a message echoed by the film’s ensemble of progressively minded confiders, figures both left- and right-leaning.\n\nAll Day and a Night (2020)\n\n60%\n\n5.9/10\n\nr\n\n121m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nAshton Sanders, Jeffrey Wright, Isaiah John\n\nDirected by\n\nJoe Robert Cole\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nIn All Day and a Night, Ashton Sanders plays Jahkor Lincoln, a once-aspiring rapper serving a life sentence for murder. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of Lincoln’s troubled upbringing. An adolescence riddled with abuse and dire straits leads to petty crime, which evolves into something far more sinister when Lincoln begins offering his services to a gangster named Big Stunna. As present-day Jahkor looks back on his dark past from behind bars, an old accomplice is admitted to the same prison. This time around, though, the man is a foe, not a friend. Praised for its performances and meditative qualities, All Day and a Night is indeed a richly-textured drama. Ashton Sanders is particularly impressive as Jahkor.\n\nAmerican Son (2019)\n\n34%\n\n5.8/10\n\npg-13\n\n90m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nKerry Washington, Steven Pasquale, Jeremy Jordan\n\nDirected by\n\nKenny Leon\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nKerry Washington is electric in Kenny Leon’s racially charged drama about a mother, father, and the police officers that serve as the gatekeepers to their son’s safety (or lack thereof). The film is minimalist in terms of set pieces, but the true gravitas of this 90-minute, escalating panic is in the claustrophobia of the police station, a bunker clinging to its segregated past by way of demarcated water fountains and a quiet regional disparity covered with a law book and a grin. The true joy of the film is in watching Washington claw her way through the narrative, channeling a polarity of emotions that are all backed by the all-too-relatable fear of a mother worried because her child didn’t come home. Sparse editing and an emotional score are the backbones of these three acts, each of which plays out like a theater piece, sans intermission.\n\nHomecoming: A Film by Beyoncé (2019)\n\n93%\n\n7.5/10\n\n137m\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary, Music\n\nStars\n\nBeyoncé, Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland\n\nDirected by\n\nBeyoncé, Ed Burke\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nA concert film for a new generation, HOMECOMING won a Grammy for Best Musical Film. Beyoncé has become something of a musical film savant, with Lemonade, Black Is King, and HOMECOMING all earning rave reviews. It’s HOMECOMING, however, that stands uniquely as a concert film. The film takes an in-depth look at Beyoncé’s 2018 Coachella performance, revealing the incredible creative depth and cultural significance of the show.\n\nBarry (2016)\n\n72%\n\n5.9/10\n\nr\n\n104m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nDevon Terrell, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ashley Judd\n\nDirected by\n\nVikram Gandhi\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nYou might think Barack Obama is still too recently out of office to have his own biopic, but the circumstances surrounding the nation’s first Black president’s rise to power are worthy of this 2016 film. The story follows a young Barack Obama as he arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 for his junior year at Columbia University. Echoing many of the themes expressed in his autobiography, Dreams of My Father, Obama struggles to stay connected to his mother and his estranged father and build new connections with his classmates. Simultaneously, he battles an identity crisis and becomes critical of the injustices he sees in his day-to-day life, ultimately motivating him toward a career in organizing and, eventually, politics.\n\nDa 5 Bloods (2020)\n\n82%\n\n6.5/10\n\nr\n\n156m\n\nGenre\n\nWar, Drama\n\nStars\n\nDelroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters\n\nDirected by\n\nSpike Lee\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nSpike Lee’s first movie under his new Netflix deal is a modern masterpiece. Simultaneously about the stasis of the movement for Black justice and the enduring villainy of the Vietnam War, Da 5 Bloods bounces between eras to illuminate how little has changed in 40 years. The film follows four Black vets as they return to Vietnam seeking the remains of their fallen squad leader and a buried treasure they vowed to one day return for. What they discover is their own “Heart of Darkness” as they battle the forces of man and nature, confronting the lasting legacy of the war and its impact on Vietnam and one another.\n\nMudbound (2017)\n\n85%\n\n7.4/10\n\nr\n\n135m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nCarey Mulligan, Jason Clarke, Jason Mitchell\n\nDirected by\n\nDee Rees\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nThe expertly lensed Mudbound — written and directed by Dee Rees and photographed by Rachel Morrison — explores the personal, economic, and racial tensions of two rural families living by way of the land in World War II-era Mississippi. A respective son from each family goes off to war. These are Jamie McAllan (Garrett Hedlund) and Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell), two boys who leave a world of racism and other struggles behind. The battle ends. They return home, Jamie with newfound trauma, and Ronsel to a country that looks down at him for the color of his skin, regardless of his valor. What’s to truly savor in Rees’ masterful period drama is Morrison’s language of framing. Rees and Morrison were after a kind of camera work that reflected the feeling of the American Dream, and so we get beauty in shades. But under the flora is loud and vibrant cinematography that enhances our connection with both families, one white and one black. Mudbound is illuminating in more ways than one, an epic racial drama led by a master class of actors that all own their roles.\n\nStrong Island (2017)\n\n86%\n\n6.4/10\n\nr\n\n107m\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary\n\nStars\n\nYance Ford, Harvey Walker, Kevin Myers\n\nDirected by\n\nYance Ford\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nDirector Yance Ford’s investigation into the 1992 murder of her brother, 24-year-old William Ford Jr., is an examination of judicial prejudice like no other, and an incredible film experiment. Courageously, Ford toes the line between essay film, personal memoir, and true crime exposé, seamlessly blending each type of documentary form in an effort to best capture her 22-year story of pain and loss. Ford spends time with the friends, family, and willing judicial entities that were involved in her brother’s life and in the courtroom for his killer’s trial, 19-year-old Mark P. Reilly. These many emotional recollections weave a rich tapestry of William Ford Jr.’s life, ambitions, fears, and frustrations. Underneath the records, talking heads, and scrapbook photos is a story about a family that lost their son, and his little sister’s lifelong quest for familial and personal closure.\n\nWhat Happened, Miss Simone?

Plagued by racism from an early age, Simone’s rise to stardom served as a platform for the activism that would define much of her career. Liz Garbus’ film is an introspective journey into the always-racing mind of an artistic genius, and a black woman who desperately wanted black voices to be heard and understood the world over. Conversations with friends, family, and those that worked with Simone professionally round out the documentary, each contributor adding a new layer of Nina, a complicated but enduring individual with a calling that never ceased, and a talent like no other.\n\nMovie images and data from:\n\nMichael Bizzaco has been writing about and working with consumer tech for well over a decade, writing about everything from A/V components and smart home devices to encryption software, cloud backup platforms, search engine tools, and more.
