        "text": "MONTREAL and HALIFAX, NS, May 30, 2023 /CNW/ - Air Canada (TSX: AC) and Chorus Aviation Inc. (TSX: CHR) (\"Chorus\"), parent company of Jazz Aviation LP (\"Jazz\"), are providing comment on Air Canada's arrangement for additional flying capacity with another airline for up to six De Havilland Canada DHC-8 aircraft.\n\n\"Jazz is our long-term Air Canada Express partner, and we are working together to increase flying activity within the framework of our existing CPA given the current, industry wide pilot situation.
