        "text": "The CILECT CONGRESS includes an annual CONFERENCE which is organized around one or more central theme(s) judged to be of concern to the membership as a whole.\n\nMost often it is dedicated to specific methodological or practical aspects of teaching in any of the major fields of the profession: screenwriting, directing, cinematography, set & costume design, music & sound design, editing, producing, distribution, acting, theory & history, etc.\n\nSometimes it concentrates on topics that apply to all of these fields, such as the impact of digital technologies on curricula; the teaching of creativity; production for children; etc.\n\nAt other times it focuses on specific areas, such as teaching documentary, animation or new media; the triangle of training (producers, directors and screenwriters); the tools of pre-visualization, building audio-visually literate audiences, ethics/aestetics, etc.\n\nFinally, it could be centered on the development of the association as a whole through a detailed assessment of all its projects, methods of teaching or communication, etc.\n\nThe CILECT CONGRESS also includes the GENERAL ASSEMBLY which deals with organizational matters of the association, and therefore is an internal event, intended mainly for the top administrators of the member schools who need to synchronize their efforts in maintaining the highest standards of film, television, and new media education.\n\nTHE CILECT PRIZE was founded in 2005 at the proposal of Prof. Dr. Stanislav Semerdjiev (NATFA, Sofia, Bulgaria). It strives to facilitate the CILECT Full Member schools with a representative annual showcase of the best student short films which could then become quality teaching examples in the schools’ curricula.\n\nTHE CILECT PRIZE is also the first ever international award bestowed to a student film not by jury members but by the whole community of CILECT. Annually, close to 300 films are being watched by 30 000+ students and teachers in the CILECT schools and later on, voted upon as the best films of the association or of its regions.\n\nThe formal inauguration of the award in each category (fiction, documentary and animation) is held at the annual congresses of CILECT where all the winners are screened and their teams are invited to meet the CILECT teaching community. The first such ceremony took place in Madrid, on 21 November 2006.\n\nThe Ethics Lab project was proposed by Dr. Dan Geva, Beit Berl College, Israel, at the CILECT Congress 2016 (GFS, Brisbane, Australia). At the initiative of Prof. Dr. Maria Dora Mourão (CILECT President 2011-2018, Honorary Member, USP, Sao Paulo, Brazil) and Prof. Bruce Sheridan (CILECT President 2018-2024, CCC, Chicago, USA), in 2017 the ETHICS LAB Project was ratified at the CILECT Congress 2017 (ZHDK, Zurich, Switzerland).\n\nBetween 2018-2022 Dr. Geva performed a world-wide pilot tour to 22 institutions scattered in CILECT’s five regions, and organized more than 50 workshops and Ethics Lab events at which he gathered over 500 video testimonials about meaningful ethical dilemmas in students’, teachers’ and staff’s careers.\n\nThe project has the ambition to expand the pedagogy to include ethical perspectives from Africa, the Maori tradition, Buddhist, Shinto, Zen, Aboriginal, North and South Native American, and any other ethical perspective that reflects CILECT’s global identity, thus far unintroduced in the current teachings.\n\nIt is also expected that the lab’s core pedagogical principle of “a single-person testimonial” could be developed into a “multi-person testimonial” embedding empathy-inducing actions, complex forms of narrative-telling, and drama-based models of role-playing and shared group effort.\n\nAt the initiative of Prof. Dr. Maria Dora Mourão (Honorary Member, USP, Sao Paulo, Brasil) and the proposal of Prof. Alan Taylor (TUT, Pretoria, South Africa), in 2013 CILECT launched a series of books under the title “The CILECT 21st Century KNOWLEDGE Project”. Each book is focused on the discussion and/or solution seeking of problems arising in front of the creator/teacher in the contemporary audiovisual practice and/or education.\n\nThe first volume “Challenges, Clashes, Changes” tried to picture a broad perspective of the audiovisual education in general in the 21st century. The second volume “Directing the Future” was solely dedicated to the professional field of Directing. The third, fourth and fifth volumes were dedicated to Sound, Animation and Documentary. Three new volumes will be published until 2025 – Production Design, Editing, Cinematography."
