        "text": "Core modules\n\nAnalysing Media Texts\n\nBe introduced to classic and contemporary methods of critical textual analysis. You’ll explore a range of different media texts, from film to TV, advertising, video games, music, and news media, and will encounter some key concepts needed to make sense of them. You’ll also examine how identities relating to race, class, sexuality, and gender are constructed across the field of popular culture.\n\nUnderstanding Media Industries\n\nLearn the essential theoretical and conceptual vocabulary needed to make sense of current trends in the media industries landscape, both nationally and internationally. You will explore questions relating to media ownership, organisation, power and control. Guest speakers will bring a new dimension to your learning by introducing real industry contexts, and by identifying the skills and competencies employers are looking for.\n\nFilm and TV style in close-up\n\nThis module introduces you to the diversity of film and television style and invites you to think carefully about different forms of film and television from the 'mainstream' and the margins, home and abroad. You will learn all about the fundamentals of close textual analysis, as well as how to interpret film and television style across a diverse range of forms, periods and styles. The module also compares how the two mediums are similar and different and looks at the contexts that inform medium specificity.\n\nThe Bigger Picture: core concepts, contexts and debates in film and television studies\n\nOn this module you will develop your understanding of some of the key debates, concepts and contexts that inform film and television studies, typically including genre, stardom, authorship, documentary, representation and sustainability. The module also introduces you to some of the key drivers of change that are transforming the film and TV industries, both on- and off-screen, so that you gain confidence in advocating and agitating for greater diversity, inclusion and equality in the film and TV industries, as well as for more sustainable film and TV production and consumption.\n\nTransformation: Agency and Self\n\nThis first-year module introduces you to interdisciplinary study with a focus on how the humanities help us to understand what is means to be human from different disciplinary perspectives, providing you with opportunities to explore and make connections between your subjects. The module introduces the role and value of the humanities to contemporary society. It also encourages you to better understand, and reflect on, your own place within your course and on your academic, personal, and professional development as you transition to higher education. In doing so, the module develops your key academic skills, introduces NTU support, and helps to create a sense of community and belonging for students studying courses in Joint Honours Humanities. For this module you will be assessed through a creative project based on a live brief, and a piece of reflective writing.\n\nOptional modules typically include - choose one\n\nPracticing Media Literacy\n\nExplore the fundamentals of media practice through a combination of technical training, experimentation and analysis. You'll start to build your media production portfolio and learn how to use industry technology and software.\n\nInternational Ciné-Club\n\nOn this module you will travel the world and the world of cinema. Each week you will visit a different international film movement and get to know its key films and filmmakers, as well as figures typically found on the margins of major film movements and world cinema. Thanks to weekly ciné-club sessions, which will include film screenings and plenty of discussion opportunities, the module will foster a lively film culture and community with you at the heart of it.\n\nCore modules\n\nMedia, Theory and Society\n\nDevelop your knowledge of theoretical approaches to understanding the media and culture. This module will help you to understand some of the key theoretical approaches that are used in the study of media, communication and culture. You'll develop a familiarity of important theoretical approaches used in contemporary media and for the use of cultural analysis.\n\nPutting Film and TV into practice\n\nThis module explores the vibrant and varied theoretical landscape that shapes our understanding of the big and small screen. It draws upon canonical work in film theory and television studies, as well as theories that attend to more marginal screens, texts, audiences, and industries, enabling you to theorise classical Hollywood cinema and popular TV genres, as well as films and shows from alternative filmmaking and televisual perspectives and practices.\n\nTransformation: Agency and World\n\nThis second-year module enables you to develop your understanding and practice of interdisciplinary study through a focus on the role and value of the humanities for understanding and engaging with sustainable futures and the future of work, beginning with addressing challenges we face in the present and actions we might take. Interrogating local, national, and global sustainability frameworks from a multi- and interdisciplinary perspective, the module provides an opportunity for you to bring together both of your subjects to address questions of sustainability and enterprise in a variety of sectors and contexts. The module enables you to reflect on your own place within these debates and their relation to your academic, personal, and professional development. As part of the module all students will complete an 80-hour work placement experience. You will be assessed through a professional portfolio and placement report.\n\nOptional pathways\n\nPathway 1: Extended work-like experience\n\nGet the experience you need for after you graduate, and really understand how the things you study translate into the world of work with a work placement. Your highly experienced Employability Team will help you find a placement to suit your career goals from our huge network of companies, charities, institutions, and beyond.\n\nPathway 2: An international exchange\n\nTravel the world, meet new friends, and have experiences you will remember for the rest of your life.\n\nOur flexible curriculum has been designed to allow some amazing opportunities for you. Your second year of study is divided into two semesters, giving you the opportunity to take part in an international exchange. You could study with one of international exchange partners in Australia, Europe, USA, Canada, Thailand and many, many more.\n\nOur dedicated team will support you in finding and arranging a suitable exchange. And don't worry about the cost, they will help you apply for any grants or loans you may need, as no one should miss out on the chance to broaden their horizons.\n\nPathway 3: Taught modules\n\nInterdisciplinary optional modules typically include:\n\nIntercultural Communication at Work\n\nGain the knowledge, skills and strategies to build your intercultural communication competence. Analyse and reflect on the impact of culture(s) on your values, assumptions, perceptions, expectations, and behaviours. Build successful verbal and non-verbal communication strategies in different intercultural settings.\n\nPeople and Planet: pasts, presents, and futures\n\nIn this module you will develop an understanding of the human impact on the environment from the 15th Century to the present as a form of slow but sustained violence enacted against the planet. It will also explore how such long-term change can interact with social justice in the present day.\n\nLanguage, Inequality and Social Justice\n\nWhether it’s racial abuse on social media, prejudice against regional accents in schools, or sexist advertising campaigns, discrimination is a social issue that affects us all in one way or another. This module examines how language can be used to both promote social justice and tackle prejudice and discrimination in a range of institutional and everyday contexts. This module will be particularly useful if you are looking to pursue a career in advocacy, human resources or journalism.\n\nFilm & TV optional modules typically include:\n\nBritish Cinema\n\nThis module looks at British cinema from 1960 onwards from a variety of perspectives. It considers how ‘British cinema’ is defined and its purpose in terms of representation and diversity in the face of the dominance of Hollywood. We study topics including the Bond franchise, Swinging London, social realism, the British gangster film, Hammer horror, the costume drama, Thatcherism on screen, New Scottish cinema and ‘the Troubles’ in Northern Ireland. We also visit Broadway cinema for a screening and industry talk.\n\nAnalysing British Television\n\nThis module explores in-depth the specific characteristics of the British TV landscape. It introduces students to the story of British television. It surveys important factors and influences that have historically shaped British television industries and institutions, as well as forms and genres. Second, it explores different televisual mediation of class, gender and race/ethnicity. Third, it explores the key genres which enable us to make sense of British television both in the past and in the present.\n\nFilm Programming\n\nThis module gives you the opportunity to devise, plan and run your own pop-up film event. Working in groups, and alongside experienced industry professionals, you will be responsible for identifying an event theme, selecting and curating event content, and delivering your film event at one of a series of city venues. Across the module you will gain industry-ready skills in research and curation, pitching and collaboration, licensing and copyright, venue management and setup, PR and promotion, and event production and management, alongside a unique insight into Notts film culture.\n\nMedia optional modules typically include:\n\nAnalysing Popular Music\n\nAnalysing Popular Music has two major concerns: firstly, to develop a social understanding of transatlantic popular music; and secondly, to develop a cultural-historical perspective on its development over the past hundred years and more. This module introduces you to theoretical approaches to the study of popular music, allowing you to engage in independent critical analysis of popular music and popular musical cultures.\n\nResearching Media and Communications\n\nThis module introduces the key methods and analytical approaches of media and cultural studies. It enables you to design and produce original research projects, and to gain deeper understanding of the research methods you might use in your final year dissertation. It outlines a range of methods (including textual analysis, ethnography, and critical discourse analysis), and shows how these can be implemented to particular case studies from the media and other cultural practices.\n\nShort Film Production and Exhibition\n\nEnhance your production skills through the creation of a short film. You will use a range of equipment and practical craft techniques to your idea from creation, through professional planning, filming, and editing to promotion and festival entry. You will be supported in a variety of roles in your team with professional advice from practice-based academic tutors and our technical team.\n\nCore module\n\nMajor project\n\nFor your major project in your final year of your studies, you can choose to undertake a project in either one of your two Joint Honours subjects.\n\nFilm and Television Major Project\n\nThe Film and Television Major Project offers you the chance to create a project on a film and/or television topic you are inspired by. This could be a written dissertation, a visual essay or podcast for instance. Taught sessions and tutors help throughout the process. You are free to choose your topic and develop your ideas around areas of interest. Recent projects range from witchcraft on film, queer youth in American cinema and female rage in the horror film to masculinity in Breaking Bad, satire in It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, sexuality in Sex Education and Squid Game and the K-Wave.\n\nMedia Major Project\n\nFor your Media Major Project, you will have the opportunity to develop your own research skills and interests in significant depth. Acting as the culmination of your learning journey, your project will be creative and individualised, allowing you to produce a wide range of projects tailored to their specific media interests. You may choose to develop a practical project in the form of a podcast, photography portfolio, short film, piece of videography or creative writing. You may also choose to produce a long-form research essay. Recent focus topics have included projects on representations of masculinity in contemporary television series such as Ted Lasso, the relationship between advertising, femininity and consumption, the online “fandoms” of musician Harry Styles, and a photography project centred on women’s experiences in exercise-related spaces.\n\nHumanities Research Project\n\nThe Humanities Research Project provides you with the opportunity to work with and further develop the combined knowledge and skills you have gained across your academic subjects to create a substantial and independent piece of interdisciplinary research. Supervised by academic staff, you will develop your own research topic, approach to the research and to the research outcome, delivered either through a 10,000-word dissertation or a substantial creative project with an accompanying 4,000-word essay. You are encouraged to approach your research project entrepreneurially; how might your research project contribute to future career opportunities and/or further study?\n\nTransformation: Agency and Social Change\n\nThis final-year module challenges you to consider the role and value of interdisciplinary research through your academic subjects in advocating for and achieving meaningful social change at different scales. Building on your first- and second-year studies, you will conceptualise, develop, and deliver your own interdisciplinary approach to a live brief focused on an aspect of social change, considering the role of issues such as ethics, justice, power, rights and inequalities, reflecting on the role that is played, or could be played, by humanities disciplines in addressing these global issues. The module also provides you with an opportunity to bring together and reflect on your personal, academic and professional development throughout your degree. For this module you will be assessed through a creative project based on a live brief, and a piece of reflective writing focused on planning for your future beyond undergraduate study.\n\nFilm and TV optional modules typically include:\n\nAmerican Television since 1950: from broadcast to narrowcast\n\nThis module examines American television from the 1950s to the present. It follows key developments in the industry, such as the formation of the classic network system, the arrival of cable and the development of on demand and streaming services, each of which has characteristic sorts of programming associated with it. We focus on key genres and cycles during this period to investigate how television responded to changes in wider American society.\n\nRubbish Film\n\nRubbish, garbage, trashy – we all occasionally use these words to describe films. Salvaging such throwaway responses, this module explores questions of equality, sustainability, climate change, industry and innovation through rubbish and its relationship to film. From films made from rubbish, and films that take garbage as their explicit thematic concern; to fake found footage films, bad biographies, the ‘dirt’ of B movie cinema, and Hollywood’s penchant for ‘recycling’ via superhero sequels and franchise reboots, you will come to understand the wastefulness of film without getting your hands too dirty.\n\nAmerican Cinema Since 1949: Margins and mainstreams\n\n1949 marks the enactment of key legislation which had some far-reaching effects on American cinema over time. This module covers the period from that date to the present, identifying key trends in the industry as it responds both to these changes and to changing American social contexts in a wide variety of ways. We examine both mainstream Hollywood cinema, the independent sector, and the increasingly complex relationships between the two.\n\nMedia optional modules typically include:\n\nLifestyle and Consumer Culture\n\nThis Media module develops your knowledge of interdisciplinary approaches to consumption. We will investigate how lifestyles and consumer culture contribute to changing cultural identities and social hierarchies. We will interrogate key concepts such as ‘taste’, ‘choice’ and ‘authenticity’ in a world that encourages individuals to become their own self-brands. Key issues include the ‘experience economy’, commodity activism and cultures of neoliberal enterprise and austerity. Through assessment you will make sense of your own experiences in consumer society and produce a detailed piece of cultural analysis.\n\nClient-led Media Production\n\nDuring this module you'll be able to focus on the development of skills in media production by completing a media project that will be set to a 'real brief'. This is an opportunity for you to enhance your employability options by participating in live projects with a real purpose. This module will encourage you to make connections between theory and practice.\n\nCultural Policy\n\nExplore a range of debates within the developing field of cultural policy studies. You'll investigate some of the key institutions within which policies relating to film, television, the visual arts, heritage and other creative industries are determined. You'll explore questions about what cultural value is, and how important the media and creative industries actually are, and you’ll examine a wide range of policy-related areas, from tourism, to TV regulation, to large national and international events, such as the Olympic Games.\n\nThe Body and Popular Culture\n\nExplore representations of the body across a diverse and contemporary range of cultural forms. By applying theoretical perspectives on different bodies in popular cultural to a wide selection of case studies, you will investigate the way that bodies are used and located within the media, addressing themes of gender, race, identity, celebrity bodies, ageing bodies, cyborgs, sexualised bodies, and more."
