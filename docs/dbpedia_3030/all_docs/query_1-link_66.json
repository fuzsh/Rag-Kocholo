        "text": "Cutaways is a personal essay series by Canadian filmmakers, asking them to tell the story of how their film was made. This edition by Evan Beloff focuses on his short film Just As I Am: The Shira Choir, which follows a group of singers with developmental disabilities as they celebrate the power of music despite the pandemic.\n\nIn 2019, I was wrapping up production on a film I was making about outreach and the artistry of cantorial music. Reverend Cantor Daniel Benlolo, who was based in Montreal, invited me and my crew to an impromptu song-jam with his former Ottawa-based group the Tamir Choir. We toured Montreal and filmed Danny and the Tamir singing at various locations from the Mount Royal Lookout to senior residences. Their celebration and uninhibited joy blew me away. It instantly exposed me to an innocent and immediate type of happiness I had never seen. I was shocked — by their carefree performance, by their unrestrained way of singing and by being forced to reflect on how I perceived those with physical and intellectual disabilities (and thus learn how I could behave more inclusively).\n\nThat day left a permanent emotional trace on me, one I would only start to colour in when I decided a year later to make a film on the Reverend Cantor's new musical endeavour in Montreal: The Shira Choir.\n\nIn my film Just As I Am: The Shira Choir, I finally had the opportunity to document choirmaster Benlolo and his unique vision for enabling singers with physical or intellectual challenges to participate and be fully included in a touring musical group. It was a challenging film and required a few years of intimate, direct cinema access with members of the troupe, who were eager to speak and sing and show me a rarely seen slice of their private lives. The omnipresence of the global pandemic, restrictions and fear of COVID-19 transmission made for challenging shoots, but it was ultimately made easy by Cantor Danny and his love for them. Whether on Zoom or during quick porch check-ins, his front-line work along with volunteers Rebecca, Rhonda, Muriel and Lenore always helped make life better for the unappreciated among us.\n\nDanny told me that working with special needs adults was refreshing, as one always knew where one stood with them; no matter what, they were honest and straightforward. Everything was always direct with choir members — I knew immediately when they liked or disliked questions or topics or food or even a song. As a result, I was able to create an unfiltered and intimate collective profile of these courageous special needs adults and their families as they shaped this new musical group through the language of song.\n\nDying and grief were also ever-present during the making of the film, not just surrounding us on television or the internet but alongside the project. My executive producer and close friend Marvin lost his dear wife Maxine suddenly halfway through principal filming; Jonah, one of the passionate and charismatic choir participants, mourned his father Joel's passing after a courageous battle with cancer. One of the more remarkable and serendipitous moments of production was directing Jonah's mother Cynthia remotely as she filmed iPhone footage of Jonah at their home and summer cottage. She and I would discuss questions and filming techniques, and what she ended up capturing in her interactions with her son were extraordinary.\n\nIt is virtually impossible for those of us who are not special needs parents to truly understand their challenges, but to have a window into their intimate interactions documented — especially as a mother guiding her son to an understanding of his father's illness, and explaining death to him — is transformative to watch. Jonah reacts to this traumatic situation as any other adult would: with disbelief, bodily stress, anger, guilt and anxiety. We see him learning to cope and singing at his father's funeral as a way to vent his feelings. It is extremely rare that I'm given an opportunity to capture such extraordinarily personal and heartbreaking moments. When I worked with my director of photography and editor Noah Leon in post-production, we felt a shared responsibility: we were holding onto someone's life.\n\nDuring the making and editing of Just As I Am, we neither focused on nor avoided the issues facing special needs adults. There are scenes where we discuss both diagnoses and the lack of public outreach services with our participants. But my initial experience of delight when I first witnessed the choir was what informed our entire filmmaking process. Throughout the filming and editing, we never wavered in our belief that how we interact with and depict disability needs to change and that, as filmmakers, we should dispel stereotypes by turning the camera on. We should allow special needs adults to have the space to tell their own story in their own way about their own personal touchstones."
