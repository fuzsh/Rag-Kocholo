Based on the hugely popular book series by Lee Child, this Amazon season has already been a hit with fans and has been renewed for that precious second season.\n\nReacher is a retired military police officer, and as such, has a nose for when something isnât quite right. He passes through the sleepy town of Margrave, Georgia and while heâs enjoying a delicious piece of pie, heâs arrested for a crime he hasnât committed and knows nothing about.\n\nItâs up to him to prove his innocence and uncover the truth before he ends up going down for a long time. However, with dirty cops, crooked politicians and suspicious townspeople, the road to redemption is rarely simple for our lead character.\n\nAfter he sees just how corrupt this little town really is, Reacher takes it upon himself to rain down vengeance the only way that he knows how. Chaos ensues and youâre sure to be gripped by this intense and entertaining thriller all the way through its eight episode season.\n\nThe series has been applauded by TV fanatics and fans of Lee Childâs original Reacher book series after previous remakes of the source material fell flat â Tom Cruise, weâre looking at you! This version of Childâs novel stands out for its great casting and punchy storytelling.\n\nIf you loved shows like Sneaky Pete, youâre bound to love Reacher. It seems like Amazon is on a roll with these mysterious thrillers and we canât wait to see what season 2 of Reacher brings!\n\nSo, as the sleepy town of Margrave, Georgia is fictional, where was Reacher actually filmed, and which popular locations can you visit in real life? Read on to find out.\n\nReacher Locations\n\nReacher is largely shot in Ontario, Canada. Thatâs right, this delightfully quaint, southern town is in Canada. The spots in Ontario that were used for filming Reacher include Port Perry, Toronto and Pickering, coming together to bring to life Lee Childâs vision of the small Georgia town of Margrave.\n\nFrom diners to jails to motels, there are a lot of iconic spots used throughout the series that span across Ontario. Even in the scenes that seem to show New York, thatâs actually still in Canada. There is a reason that Toronto is known as the New York of the north!\n\nToronto strikes again as a city double for the scenes that seem to be set in Atlanta. As the biggest city in Georgia, itâs no wonder it features in the storyline of Reacher, but yet again, the cast and crew didnât take a step out of Canada to film any of this first series.\n\nWith so many Canadian spots doubling as the fictional town of Margrave, Georgia, itâs pretty easy to rent a car and travel around the filming locations. So, if youâre a big fan in need of a road trip, keep reading for your dream Reacher itinerary! Spoiler alert â we cover some terrific scenes!\n\nIn the opening episode of the show, we see Reacher (Alan Ritchson) arrested having just arrived in the town of Margrave - for a crime he didnât commit. Heâs then taken to be processed by Officer Roscoe Conklin (Willa Fitzgerald) at the station and temporarily put in prison.\n\nOffer Conklin clearly isnât in the mood to play around with dead bodies in her town, because she says to Reacher, âSir? If you step over here, I can process you. I'm not asking, sir, I'm telling. But don't worry, I won't kick your ass unless you make me.â\n\nThe Margrave prison is actually the Kingston Penitentiary, a former maximum-security prison in Kingston, Ontario. Itâs no longer a functioning prison, and now serves as part of Canadaâs Penitentiary Museum, which offers visitors an insight into life in prison, how itâs changed over the years and you can even ask former guards for their experiences.\n\nIf youâve got an interest in all things true crime, you donât scare too easily and you love Reacher, then this might be the perfect place to check out while youâre in Kingston, Ontario. Just make sure you donât get framed for anything while youâre there!\n\nThereâs a bus stop just outside the penitentiary so you can easily access it from downtown Kingston.\n\nUncover Ottawa Filming Locations\n\nIn one of the first scenes in the entire series, we see Reacher arriving in the unassuming town of Margrave and settling in to enjoy some pie at the town diner. Before he has a chance to finish his slice, heâs interrupted by the local law enforcement.\n\nThis diner, which also doubles as the diner in Memphis where Reacher meets his best friend and confidante Frances Neagley (Maria Sten) later in the series, is actually The Lakeview Restaurant at 1132 Dundas Street W in Toronto.\n\nThe Lakeview Restaurant is a Toronto hidden gem and institution that offers 24 hour service including a famous brunch menu and daily drink deals that change all the time, making every visit unique.\n\nThis is our first introduction to our eponymous hero, and immediately we know that he is eco-conscious and polite, asking the waitress, \"You guys recycle?\", before getting arrested and kick-starting the entire conspiracy plot of this thrilling and exciting series.\n\nGetting to The Lakeview Restaurant is super easy as itâs in the heart of Toronto. Being on Dundas Street, there is a street car stop right outside the restaurant as well as several bus stops to choose from. Enjoy some delicious food while you visit this Reacher location.\n\nToronto Filming Locations Guide\n\nAs the series goes on, but still in season 1, we see the âwill they, wonât theyâ relationship between Reacher and Roscoe. While following a lead into the murders, simultaneously trying to discover whoâs trying to go after Reacher, and get stranded by flooding, the pair check into a motel. This is one of the cutest and best scenes in Reacher!\n\nDuring this particular scene, we see Reacher explaining how he doesnât dance, to which Roscoe replies âIt's a crime not to dance to the legendary Patsy Clineâ. Sheâs not wrong, and sheâd know, sheâs an officer of the law!\n\nThis motel definitely isnât in Georgia, itâs actually the Maple Leaf Motel in Scarborough. This is one of the many Reacher locations you can spot as you drive around this town.\n\nThe Maple Leaf Motel is an affordable option with plenty of parking if youâre traveling to the area by car. As itâs on the northeast edge of Toronto, itâs pretty well served by public transport, both by the LE train and by multiple bus routes.\n\nToronto Video Shoot Locations Directory\n\nBy now, we know that Reacher likes to deal with a lot of issues with his fists, and as a former military police officer, heâs no stranger to violence and punch-ups. This became even more apparent in the second episode of the first season where he beats up three guys in one go.\n\nThis is where the conspiracy deepens with KJ (Chris Webster) hiring each of the guys to go and beat up Reacher. Unfortunately for them, they were no match for the ex-military man and ended up with broken wrists and heavily bruised egos.\n\nUpon seeing the fight take place and the surprising result, Roscoe comments, âWhat the hell just rolled into Margrave?â. What the hell, indeed. Itâs clear this season is going to be a wild ride.\n\nThe dark parking lot where this intense scene takes place is in the car park of the Stratford Suburban Motel. Far from the darkened, unsafe area that itâs portrayed in the show, this motel is wrapped in green gardens on the edge of town.\n\nItâs conveniently placed just a 10-minute drive from Queens Park and itâs ideally placed for visitors who want to visit the ever-popular Stratford Shakespeare Festival.\n\nThe nearest public transport systems are the train stations in Stratford itself, connecting the town with cities and towns further afield. From here you can either grab a taxi to the Stratford Suburban Motel, but itâs probably easier to drive.\n\nView Hamilton Filming Locations\n\nAnother episode of Reacher, another fight. It seems like a recurring theme for our main character, and oddly it seems to be getting results. However, this time the fight was a set up to get him arrested, yet again. It takes place in season 1, episode 5.\n\nAfter seeing the word âwhâââ spray-painted on Roscoeâs truck and knowing that KJ was somehow behind it, he confronts him about it in a local diner. After a smart comment from KJ, Reacher sends him flying with a slap thatâs witnessed by half the town. Thereâs no getting out of that one.\n\nIn response to the arrest and KJâs behavior, Reacher says, âBad people should get what's coming to them. No apologies.â It seems to be setting up a mighty showdown thatâs only going to get more intense.\n\nThis particular diner scene isnât filmed in the same place as the initial pie scene, instead, itâs shot in the Piano Inn and Cafe at 217 Queen Street in Port Perry. Port Perry is used a lot in Reacher as it has that small-town vibe that makes it a great double for rural Georgia.\n\nThe Piano Inn and Cafe is in the heart of Port Perry and as such is easily accessible by bus. Itâs located near the marina, so if youâre traveling by boat you might want to check out if there are any short-term moorings during your visit.\n\nCheck Toronto Film Shoot Locations\n\nAll in all, Reacher is an exciting and thrilling season that is full of twists and turns, no more so than the showâs shocking finale, lining up its upcoming second season nicely. Itâs rare that a show is well received by both new TV fans and fans of a book series, but this particular adaptation of Lee Childâs hit series seems to be striking that crucial balance.\n\nWith multiple books in the Reacher series, there is plenty of source material to keep the Reacher TV show going for years to come, much to the delight of Amazon and the fans alike.\n\nAs only a few sets are specially built for the show, itâs really easy to find yourself walking around what feels like the ârealâ Margrave, Georgia, without stepping out of the Canadian Province of Ontario!\n\nSimply fly into Toronto, rent a car and relieve those pivotal Reacher scenes that keep us hooked and on our toes as he seeks to find out the truth!"
