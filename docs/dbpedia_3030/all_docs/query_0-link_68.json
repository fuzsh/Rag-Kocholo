        "text": "Mark Wahlberg‚Äôs latest movie has him involved with actor/director Mel Gibson in the thriller Flight Risk. He‚Äôll be playing a pilot who reveals himself to be a hitman sent to kill a fugitive on a flight. With Wahlberg showing himself in character with a newly shaved head, actor Joe Pantoliano led a chorus of fun comments about the new hairdo.\n\nIn the Flight Risk trailer, we already thought Mark Wahlberg was getting heavy into character with his fake Southern accent. Then, when Michelle Dockery‚Äôs FBI agent character knocks off the pilot/hitman‚Äôs hat, we see the male pattern baldness look in full bloom! The Boston native revealed on Instagram a funny look at his new ‚Äòdo for Flight Risk, and no, it‚Äôs not a bald cap!\n\nIt shouldn‚Äôt come as too much of a surprise that Mark Wahlberg put so much effort into his character‚Äôs appearance. For example, the Ted actor made himself all muscly with Dwayne Johnson in Pain & Gain. Then, he lost 60 pounds to play a self-destructing literature professor in The Gambler. A big transformation for Wahlberg was when he gained 20 lbs in three weeks to play a real-life boxer-turned-priest in Father Stu eating 7,000 calories a day. If the American leading man was willing to put his body through the ringer for that role, you'd think shaving his head ought to be a cakewalk for the dedicated actor.\n\nMany Instagram users were quick to leave hilarious comments about Mark Wahlberg‚Äôs new hair for Flight Risk. Once The Sopranos‚Äô Joe Pantoliano chimed in with his funny reaction, and many other celebrities and social media users joined in on the fun:\n\nI knew if I waited long enough, going Bald would be cool‚Ä¶ ‚ù§Ô∏è @realjoeypants\n\nDedication to the craft right there üòÇüëèüèª @boyfromboston617\n\nFinally - the REAL Mark. Bloodied and balding and clumsily surreptitious. @paulwhausergram\n\nMark Baldberg @brilling91\n\nAll in foo! @mariolopez\n\nIf you thought the reactions of various celebrities were funny, Mark Wahlberg told People that his wife was very surprised to see her husband‚Äôs new look for the movie. I can understand that considering it‚Äôs a look we‚Äôve never seen before from the Oscar nominee. He also revealed his kids got a lot of laughs from the haircut as well which should be a real motivator for them to see the upcoming film. Wahlberg said that his decision to really shave his hair was due to feeling ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù wearing a fake mustache or a wig. His reasoning makes sense considering hair does grow back after all."
