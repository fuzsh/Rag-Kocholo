        "text": "If there’s one thing we know, it’s Pride! In this unique show, we turn the microphone around to you as you join us in a riotous Pride sing-along. With lyrics provided on-screen and all your queer anthems, there’s no excuse to just sit and watch! It’s time to let your hair down, don your sequins, and belt out some of our favourite camp classics. Grab your friends and a drink and come to the Annex Theatre to kick off Pride season with a bang!\n\nAt a dinner party in the fall of 2015, filmmaker Mark Halliday came up with an idea to work on a documentary style film featuring the beloved Vancouver Men’s Chorus. Over the course of the next two years, Mark followed the VMC behind-the-scenes, captured thousands of hours of footage, and interviewed members of this tight-knitted chorus.\n\nThere was no script but, through the interviews, three themes became clear: the VMC has built and shaped a community for queer and gay men in the past four decades; their performances have changed their audience in the most unexpected ways; the chorus has became a chosen family and has integrated with the lives of its members forever. The interviews, combined with clips Mark filmed of the VMC performances in 2016 and 2017, provided an intimate snapshot of Canada’s first GBTQ2+ chorus.\n\nWe Are the Vancouver Men’s Chorus debuted at the 2018 Vancouver film festival ‘Out on Screen’ and was featured at the 2019 Atlanta film festival ‘Out on Film’, and later released on OutTV."
