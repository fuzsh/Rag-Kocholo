        "text": "Succession-style tech drama BlackBerry tops the nomination list for the Canadian Screen Awards' film category — not just for this year, but for any year in the awards' history.\n\nBlackBerry pulled in 17 nods in categories including best motion picture, best direction, and best performance in a leading role (Jay Baruchel) and supporting role (Glenn Howerton). Those nominations pushed the Matt Johnson-directed movie — based on the rise and fall of the BlackBerry cellphone and its Canadian makers — past the previous record-holder, Brother, which went into last year's ceremony with 14 nominations, eventually winning 12.\n\nIn total, 216 feature, documentary and short films received nominations for this year's Canadian Screen Awards, which were created through the merger of the Genie and Gemini awards in 2012. The nominees were unveiled Wednesday.\n\nBest motion picture\n\nBlackBerry\n\nHumanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person\n\nInfinity Pool\n\nRed Rooms\n\nRichelieu\n\nSolo\n\nAchievement in direction, film\n\nMatt Johnson, BlackBerry\n\nAriane Louis-Seize, Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person\n\nBrandon Cronenberg, Infinity Pool\n\nHenri Pardo, Kanaval\n\nPascal Plante, Red Rooms\n\nSophie Dupuis, Solo\n\nBut as usual, it was TV that truly led the pack this year. Limited series Little Bird and dramedy Sort Of received 19 and 18 nominations, respectively, dominating their fields of drama and comedy.\n\nFor Sort Of, which aired its final season late last year, the nominations capped an impressive record at the awards. Co-created by Fab Filippo and star Bilal Baig, it won best comedy series in 2022 and 2023.\n\nIt is now up for awards in directing, writing, editing and supporting comedy performer (Amanda Cordner, Ellora Patnaik and Supinder Wraich). Perhaps surprisingly, Sort Of is not nominated for best comedy series this year.\n\nBest comedy series\n\nBria Mack Gets a Life\n\nLetterkenny\n\nShelved\n\nSon of a Critch\n\nWorkin' Moms\n\nBest drama series\n\nEssex County\n\nLittle Bird\n\nPlan B\n\nSlasher: Ripper\n\nTransplant\n\nLittle Bird is based on the Sixties Scoop, a historical practice that saw the Canadian government remove Indigenous children from their families to be adopted or put into foster care. The series, co-created by Jennifer Podemski, is up for best drama series, best direction, best supporting performer (Braeden Clarke) and best lead performer (Darla Contois and Ellyn Jade), among others.\n\nClose races\n\nWorkin' Moms was the third most-nominated series, picking up 12 for its final season. The Catherine Reitman-fronted series has been nominated every year since 2018. This year it competes for best ensemble performance in a comedy, best lead performer in a comedy (for both Reitman and Dani Kind), best comedy series and others.\n\nFollowing BlackBerry in nominations for the film category is Quebec's Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person, which scored 12 nominations, including best picture and best performance in a leading role (Sara Montpetit). Director Ariane Louis-Seize also earned a nomination, making her one of two women up for the best director award, along with Sophie Dupuis for Solo.\n\nEarlier this week, Louis-Seize received the Toronto Film Critics Association's Stella Artois Jay Scott Prize for emerging artists. The association's top prize — the $100,000 Rogers Best Canadian Film Award — was split between BlackBerry and Swan Song, a documentary profiling ballerina Karen Kain; however, while the Canadian Screen Awards recognized BlackBerry, Swan Song was not nominated for best feature-length documentary.\n\nTed Rogers best feature-length documentary\n\nBeyond Paper\n\nKite Zo A: Leave the Bones\n\nThe Longest Goodbye\n\nSomeone Lives Here\n\nTwice Colonized\n\nBest factual series\n\nBollywed\n\nCocaine, Prison & Likes: Isabelle's True Story\n\nDark Side of the Ring\n\nLittle Big Community\n\nThunder Bay\n\nOther notable nominees include Brandon Cronenberg's Infinity Pool, with 11 nominations — equalling his father David Cronenberg's nomination count in 2023 for Crimes of the Future. Infinity Pool is in the running for best motion picture, best original screenplay and best performance in a leading role for both Mia Goth and Alexander Skarsgård.\n\nDani Pagliarello and Aisha Evelyna's woman-led production The Drop and Vivek Shraya's coming-of-age drama How to Fail as a Popstar lead digital media series nominations, with five each.\n\nManaged by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, the 2024 Canadian Screen Awards will take place over four separate ceremonies in late May — nearly six weeks later than normal.\n\nThe academy transitioned the final broadcast show into a pre-taped ceremony last year, stitching together highlights from the different ceremonies. It led to considerable pushback, including from Schitt's Creek star Eugene Levy.\n\nOrganizers confirmed that the 2024 awards will once again be pre-taped. They will culminate on May 31 with a show hosted by comedian Mae Martin, which will air on CBC and CBC Gem at 8:00 p.m. ET.\n\nOther nominees include:\n\nJohn Dunning best first feature film award\n\nHumanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person\n\nIn Flames\n\nKanaval\n\nRichelieu\n\nSomething You Said Last Night\n\nThrough the Night\n\nPerformance in a leading role — Film, drama\n\nMia Goth, Infinity Pool\n\nAlexander Skarsgård, Infinity Pool\n\nRayan Dieudonné, Kanaval\n\nOyin Oladejo, Orah\n\nAmrit Kaur, The Queen Of My Dreams\n\nJuliette Gariépy, Red Rooms\n\nAriane Castellanos, Richelieu\n\nThéodore Pellerin, Solo\n\nPerformance in a leading role — Film, comedy\n\nJay Baruchel, BlackBerry\n\nCody Lightning, Hey, Viktor!\n\nFélix-Antoine Bénard, Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person\n\nSara Montpetit, Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person\n\nMagalie Lépine Blondeau, The Nature of Love\n\nAlexandra Billings, Queen Tut\n\nSusan Kent, Who's Yer Father?\n\nChris Locke, Who's Yer Father?\n\nBest lead performer, drama series\n\nMayko Nguyen, Hudson & Rex\n\nDarla Contois, Little Bird\n\nEllyn Jade, Little Bird\n\nVictor Garber, Family Law\n\nMeredith MacNeill, Pretty Hard Cases\n\nAdrienne C.
