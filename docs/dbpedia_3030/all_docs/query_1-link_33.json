        "text": "There are a bunch of film festivals going on online this year.\n\nEvery Film Festival and Market Still Happening in 2020, Live or Online | IndieWire\n\nHere's a place to discuss the various fests, things you've seen, want to see, etc...\n\nI'm looking forward to\n\nSound of Metal (Darius Marder, November 20, 2020) • forum.chorus.fm\n\nwhich will start playing tomorrow at a handful of online fests.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on any of the stuff playing at Nightstream (or any upcoming online fests)? Probably just going to splurge and do the 10 ticket pack, but have no clue what to pick outside of Mandibles. Would have loved to see Run but it's already past.\n\nI quickly looked and didn’t land on anything but ill check again\n\nAlready did TIFF and another local Ontario festival + miscellaneous films from other festivals where I’ve gotten around the restrictions\n\nFor Canadian folks, Festival du nouveau cinema is running now until October 31\n\nFestival du nouveau cinéma | Home\n\nAGH in Ontario starting October 16 until the 25th\n\nWatch Films Here! | AGHFF 2020\n\nI’ve seen quite bit from both line ups and they’re both really strong. Willing to offer up recommendations if anyone is looking (this goes for other fests too, since there’s a lot of crossover on all these online line ups).\n\nIt's pretty hit or miss since there's so many variables. I had no luck getting around Vancouver (it was locked to BC, not all of Canada) or NYFF. My best results have been with like mid-level European festivals.\n\nLooking through the links you posted, I can vouch for Mandibules, which is very funny with the exception of a few thinks I found distasteful. Dupieux is one of the best comedic filmmakers around.\n\nChicago has one of the more comprehensive line ups I've seen. A lot of my favourites from this year are playing there. Undine, The Woman Who Ran, Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time, Days. Guess it depends on what kind of film you're looking for, but this line up is great if you're looking for \"international\" \"art\" cinema. 56th Chicago International Film Festival - All Films\n\nThanks for the info. I appreciate it. Will definitely check out what the Chicago fest has to offer.\n\nHave you happened to see anything playing at Nightstream?\n\nOther than Mandibules, just Ema and Black Bear. Big fan of Ema, Black Bear is worth a watch too. Honestly, I don’t follow genre cinema closely so a lot of this line up is more unknown to me compared to more general festivals.\n\nIt’s all over the place since the geo-blocking can range from state/province to handful of states/provinces to nationwide. Plus there’s a handful of different platforms that are being used, which all have their own security. When I was trying for NYFF it refused at the level of payment because it could sense my VPN but some Euro festivals using the same platform I’ve had no issue getting by. For VIFF (using a different platform) it didn’t catch it until I tried to play the film, after passing payment."
