        "text": "Choirs are a consistently topic of cine films. Remember the Sister Act movies from 1992 and 1993, which made history for the modern choral films, followed by Les Choristes (The Chorus, 2004), As it is in Heaven (2004), Oh Happy Day (2004), Young@Heart (2007), Glee (2011), Joyful Noise (2012), Song for Marion (2013), The Muppets (2014) or just Pitch Perfect (2012, 2015).\n\nThe so-called choral films explicitly refer to the choral music and characters in their storyline.\n\nIt is mainly to show the impacts of singing together on the choristers: Problems and crises of individual singers can be managed in the community, and individual singers find their true purpose, self-confidence and confirmation through song. Singing together triggers feeling of happiness and promotes health, what scientific studies have shown. The topic of choral films is mostly the evolution of a singer or the choral sound.\n\nIn the film “Boychoir” (2014) by the Canadian producer Francois Girard also the young and rebelled Stet needs to fight for recognition of a prestigious US-boys’ choir. The skeptical conductor recognizes the singing talent only when he teaches the boy himself.\n\nThe film premiered in the USA in 2014, and from this August the film can also be seen, among others, in German cinemas. Due to the star cast Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Eddie Izzard, Debra Winger and the young singer played by Garrett Wareing the film is absolutely worth watching. But for singers the choral music and the ethos of the peaceful coexistence, which sparks through singing, are the main arguments to experience the cinematic realization of our favorite topic choral singing."
