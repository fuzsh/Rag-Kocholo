        "text": "I absolutely love the Pluto channel! Like others I didn't think there would be much offered but was pleasantly surprised. For those of you that tried the channel years ago, it has really improved in quality and playback. It may have been the internet service in general. I don't know, but, I am happy to say that Pluto has so much to offer (I just saw movies from channels I am currently paying for...but not for long!) The commercials are not that bad and as with others I just mute them if I'm not interested. Simple enough.\n\nThank you to everyone involved with the Pluto channel for the chance to enjoy an awesome lineup of live tv and the extensive library of shows and movies from old to new because you have helped so many people in a time that we need all the help we can get. I feel the need to add that not only should I mention it is 'free' but it is quality programming and selection is of a great variety. I don't watch or even like some shows or topics of said shows but we all have the choice of what to watch and when. Adults, you have the choice of what your kids watch and there are plenty of channels and shows I believe you would find acceptable. It's a great channel so I would recommend giving it a try. For me, I am a Grandma that loves to watch Anime and a variety of other things so I find a lot of entertainment on this one free channel. Hope you all will enjoy it as much as I and many others do.ð¤\n\nUsed to watch Pluto almost exclusively but one day i could no longer rewind & fast forward - i continued checking & it wasnât a fluke so sadly: no more Pluto. What REALLY hurt is that you were running a favorite movie (That Touch of Mink) but i simply cannot RELAX & enjoy watching anything unless i feel assured that if i miss anything or want to rewatch something iâm able to rewind. Probably my own personal quirk but itâs enough to ruin perusing the app for me. Now that i see those features are back .. so am i!ðð»ââï¸ This FREE APP has tons of great movies & series/sitcoms! iâm thrilled to once more be watching Pluto\n\nbut if the ff/rewind disappears - so will i! ð¤ð»PLEASE donât ever do that again,\n\nit was TORTURE!\n\nPs By the time Pluto finally brought the controls back, my favorite Doris Day film was no longer on Pluto. So youâre still getting 5 stars bc iâm so excited that i can watch again BUT this app has caused me a ton of upset & irritation! My hope is that there are many more like me so that you now know that itâs NOT COOL to pull that crap! It makes total sense feasibly - why would customers ever be happy when privileges are taken away, you shouldâve at least lowered your prices! Everything is great, PLEASE donât change anymore - i would truly prefer to stay! .. hey, you asked! THANX! ð¬\n\nFirst off let me say that I LOVE this App! Being able to see old episodes of Doctor Who and other shows is awesome.. But I do wish youâd change it up & run some different episodes from these shows.. Take Doctor Who for example: If we just take the âClassicâ Seasons of Doctor Who, there was probably 200+ episodes, or more.. But this App plays maybe 20 episodes all told, then starts over and plays the same 20 episodes, then starts over and plays the same 20 episodes.. So unfortunately Iâve stopped watching it cause Iâve seen the same 20 episodes maybe 15 times each.. I just canât watch the same ones over & over anymore.. But the main reason Iâm writing this is because thereâs a glitch in the app.. Every time I open the app for the 1st time of the day it says, âHaving trouble with this titleâ, meaning the show wonât run.. Then I click to a new channel & it will say the same thing, âHaving trouble with this titleâ.. NO show will run.. Then I have to turn my phone off completely & then restart it, then open the app again & it will finally run the way itâs supposed it.. I have to do this EVERY SINGLE DAY.. But Iâm sorry, if this doesnât get corrected Iâm gonna have to stop using the App all together cause I really donât like having to shut off my phone & restart it every day just to use ur app.. So Please, please fix this glitch & add some new episodes & Iâll use ur app forever!!"
