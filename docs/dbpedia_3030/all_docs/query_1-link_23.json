        "text": "Mikah -\n\n​\n\nAdventurer Mikah Meyer grew up on the plains of Nebraska, exploring the outside world via the Travel Channel and hoping to see someone like him on screen. Now, he gets to provide the outdoorsman representation he wished for, working with brands and organizations to increase LGBTQ+ inclusion in adventure culture. He uses a Masters in Classical Singing to perform shows about the queer outdoors experience and his journey to America’s 400+ National Park Service sites.\n\n@mikahmey\n\nLarry -\n\n​\n\nDr. Larry Edwards has been the Artistic Director of the Memphis Symphony Chorus since 1988. He served as Director of Choral Activities for the University of Memphis School of Music from 1987 to 2021, where he taught choral conducting and led ensembles ranging from pop-rock to opera. He is a content sailor and lover of open water, having grown up in the PNW and receiving music degrees from Seattle Pacific University and the University of Illinois at Champaign.\n\n@maestroedwards\n\nDean -\n\n​\n\nDead DaLomba is a first generation Cape Verdean, born in Boston and raised in the suburbs. After spending most of his life in the land of the Kennedys and Dunkin' Donuts, Dean decided to take off on an adventure, he uprooted his life with his pup (Lady Cynta) and moved to the stunning island of Maui. When he's not working as a photography studio manager you can find him doing some type of craft or design work, from printmaking to crocheting.\n\n@crioloboy\n\nAmar -\n\n​\n\nBorn in India, Amar moved to the US for grad school, and found his love for the great outdoors after moving to Seattle. He is an avid (albeit fair-weather) hiker, kayaker and biker, and tries to make the most of the gorgeousness that the PNW has to offer during the sliver of summer that we get. He loves to travel, with beach vacations being his favorite, and will never say no to good food. To pay the bills, Amar works in tech.\n\n@amarbonsor\n\nShane -\n\n​\n\nDr. Shane Rasner is an avid outdoorsman and world traveler. He loves fishing, water skiing, snow skiing, and hiking. His love of nature has taken him to New Zealand, South Africa, Central America, China, every province in Canada, almost every country in Europe, Mexico, and 47 states in North America. He shares his love of nature with his husband, Charles and Charlie, their 11 year old son. He has a Bachelor of Science in Religion from Millsaps College, a Doctorate in Dental Surgery from the University of Tennessee College of Dentistry and has a license in Massage Therapy.\n\n@shanerasner\n\nOARS & Wondercamp -\n\n​\n\nOARS was founded in 1969 by river pioneer George Wendt. By 1974 the company found its permanent home in Angels Camp, California, where George and his wife Pam turned a fledgling rafting company into what is now one of the most respected outfitting companies in the world.\n\n@oars_rafting\n\n​\n\nWondercamp is a full service film production company based in Seattle, WA, and Bend, OR. They make films about everyday world changers, status quo shakers, and adventure takers.\n\nDirector: Chris Cresci\n\nAD: Jason Jazzy Greene\n\n@wondercamp.co"
