        "text": "Canada can be transformed into almost any other city — when filming, that is.\n\nBy: Daniella Lopez\n\nWhile most films and television shows take place in the United States, many are filmed and set in Canada. Whether it be for cheaper production costs, better scenery or historically accurate locations, here is a list of films and television shows shot in Canada from every province and territory.\n\nBritish Columbia\n\nMidnight Mass\n\nWhen a young, charismatic priest comes to an isolated island community miracles and mysteries occur. The fictional town of Crockett Island was shot all over British Columbia. Garry Point Park, B.C., was used to film beach scenes and exterior house scenes. The 6th and 7th Avenue piers in Richmond, B.C., were used to film the in-show marina. Anderlini Farms in Aldergrove, B.C., was used to shoot the school, general store and church.\n\nAnne of Green Gables\n\nAnne of Green Gables is based on a novel of the same name. It follows an orphan girl who was mistakenly sent to P.E.I. While the film was shot in both Ontario and P.E.I., some of the most memorable locations were from the Island. Most notably is the Seacow Head lighthouse, one of the oldest structures in P.E.I."
