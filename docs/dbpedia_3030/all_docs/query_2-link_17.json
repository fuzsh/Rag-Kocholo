        "text": "Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for October, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice.\n\nMovies\n\n‘Operation Finale’\n\nStarts streaming: Oct. 2\n\nWhen Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi official who worked out the transportation logistics for the Final Solution, was captured in Argentina and brought back for trial in Jerusalem, it was a chilling lesson in bureaucracy — what the writer Hannah Arendt called “the banality of evil.” Chris Weitz’s meat-and-potatoes historical thriller about Eichmann (Ben Kingsley) and Peter Malkin (Oscar Isaac), one of the Israeli Nazi hunters who brought him to justice, emphasizes the humanity of all involved, which becomes unsettling in its own right.\n\n—\n\n‘Private Life’\n\nStarts streaming: Oct. 5\n\nTamara Jenkins has directed only two features since “Slums of Beverly Hills,” her pungent coming-of-age film about growing up poor in the richest public school district. But her serio-comic observations about family life have made each an event. Eleven years after her excellent film “The Savages,” starring Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jenkins has returned with “Private Life,” a drama about the stresses of a middle-aged couple attempting to have a child together. Paul Giamatti and Kathryn Hahn star as 40-somethings who struggle with their marriage as infertility leads them on an odyssey through adoption and assisted reproduction options.\n\n—\n\n‘22 July’\n\nStarts streaming: Oct. 10\n\nThough Paul Greengrass’s Jason Bourne sequels are known for their shaky-cam immediacy, those same techniques weren’t just for show: They have long helped define the docu-realism of his more serious films, like “Bloody Sunday,” “United 93” and “Captain Phillips.” Greengrass’s ability to give traumatic world events a disturbing you-are-there quality gets put to the test in “22 July,” his chronicle of the 2011 Norway attacks by Anders Behring Breivik — a car explosion in Oslo; a summer camp massacre on the island of Utoya —that took 77 lives.\n\n—\n\n‘Apostle’\n\nStarts streaming: Oct. 12\n\nWith his Indonesian martial arts breakthrough “The Raid” and its sequel, “The Raid 2: Berandal,” director Gareth Evans proved himself a master of lizard-brain genre entertainment, exploiting generic criminal underworld premises to maximum visceral effect. Replace “criminal underworld” with “early 20th-century religious cult,” and Evan’s new film, “Apostle” sounds like more of the same gory, beautifully stylized mayhem, but with some horror elements to match the action. Set on a remote island that is home to a strange, growing religious commune — shades of “The Wicker Man” — the film stars Dan Stevens as a man who arrives to rescue his kidnapped sister and uncovers shocking truths about her abductors.\n\n—\n\n‘The Kindergarten Teacher’\n\nStarts streaming: Oct. 12\n\nThere are traces of the documentary “My Kid Could Paint That” in the writer-director Sara Colangelo’s treatment of a preternaturally gifted child whose work goes public. B ut “The Kindergarten Teacher” drifts into an increasingly more disturbing territory. Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as a teacher who is so thunderstruck by the poetry of a 5-year-old student (Parker Sevak) that she takes dramatic steps to bring her Mozart-level discovery out into the world. What begins as a teacher’s nurturing passion for her student crosses over into less acceptable behavior, as she defies boundaries and co-opts his life and words for herself.\n\n—\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
