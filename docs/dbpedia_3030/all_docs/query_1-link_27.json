        "text": "Director David Charles Rodrigues’s Gay Chorus Deep South, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City on Monday, follows 300 singers in the San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus as they embarked on a tour of the Deep South in 2017. In states like Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina, conductor Tim Seelig leads his choir in a series of church performances in an attempt to ignite a conversation around inclusivity and acceptance while challenging the faith-based, anti-LGBTQ laws brought on in the Trump era. (While the South is not the only region to assume such laws—RFRAs, for example, which the LGTBQ community believes allows discrimination based on religious beliefs—the film centers on mostly deep-red states.)\n\nIf battling prejudice and homophobia through song seems like a fanciful idea, the documentary is well aware of its lofty goal, which simply comes down to a mission of helping everybody get along. Life isn’t a musical, and Rodrigues knows this. Even right from the beginning, the film does not hide from ugly truths of intolerance and bigotry. It opens with choir rehearsals, when the chorus receives a hateful voice-mail message blasting the group for “pushing themselves” onto people who do not agree with their “lifestyle.” After listening to it, one chorus member replies, “Well . . . there ain’t no amount of singing that can fix that.” Still, as Rodrigues follows the group along their bus tour, it becomes apparent that one can’t underestimate the power of heartfelt tune, either.\n\nMusic has, after all, played a large role in activism. During the civil rights movement, gospel played an integral part in spreading the message of freedom and equality through lyrics. In Gay Chorus Deep South, the chorus partners with the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir to bring performances across the U.S. of songs like “Amazing Grace” and “True Colors.” And those sweet sounds do have an impact. In one touching scene, a chorus member invites his parents to a performance, and his estranged father watches a member in full drag belt it out in full camp style. Afterward, he tells his son he surprisingly enjoyed the performance. That moment, that small glimmer of acceptance, even just for a second, seems to make the whole tour worthwhile. (And, full disclosure, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house.)\n\nThe individual stories of the chorus members are the film’s strongest elements. They must all grapple with their own trauma and baggage along the way. One singer, in the midst of transitioning during the tour, wonders if they “belong” in a group of mostly cis gay men. Conductor Seelig builds up to a grand-finale performance at a Baptist church, the same organization he was kicked out of and shunned from after first coming out. In the end, a more progressive pastor from the church welcomes him back with open arms, though the doc doesn’t avoid those who didn’t; there are many churches that reject his requests to perform in their venues along the way.\n\nBut the ultimate star of Gay Chorus Deep South is the singing. Rodrigues does an excellent job of allowing the group’s angelic harmonies take center stage. In one scene, they perform in a very tight venue, the singers interspersed with audience members; some hold hands with their rainbow glove–wearing moms (werk), others lock arms with perfect strangers. One can’t help but see the symbolism there: the straights and the Catholics and the gays all joyfully singing as one. It’s hopefully a look into the future—with gay-marriage rights, among other rights, under threat of being overturned, it is by far not a reality yet—but, for now, it’s a sentiment that’s worth belting out as loud as you can."
