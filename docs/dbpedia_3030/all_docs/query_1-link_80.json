        "text": "The Chorus We Carry\n\nThe Chorus We Carry is a short film that examines philanthropy and the lack of resourcing of feminist organizations, movements, and activists over time. While funding might be limited, the impact and change that is possible when feminist activists have access to money is clear. Featuring interviews with experts from across the globe, including those who are deeply connected to a network of changemakers, the film discusses the concepts of money, gender, and power and the need to fill the gap when it comes to resourcing feminists who fight for a more just and equitable world.\n\nFeminist Activism Without Fear: Facing Risks with Collective Power & Care\n\nThis new campaign shares the stories of feminist activists facing increasingly intense forms of\n\nbacklash, or “reprisals,” and provides insights into how funders and policymakers can support\n\nthose at risk through a lens of care and connectivity."
