The following is a reference / historical listing of the 70-millimeter engagements of A Chorus Line in the United States and Canada. These were the cinemas worth seeking out to experience this motion picture.

A Chorus Line was among twenty-three confirmed first-run films released in 1985 with 70mm prints for selected engagements. The Embassy/PolyGram presentation and Columbia release was directed by Richard Attenborough (A Bridge Too Far, Gandhi) and starred Michael Douglas.

The world premiere of A Chorus Line was held December 9th at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The west coast premiere was held December 11th at Century Plaza in Los Angeles.

For the release of A Chorus Line, Columbia employed the services of Lucasfilms Theatre Alignment Program (TAP) to evaluate and approve the cinemas selected to book a 70mm print.

The 70mm prints of A Chorus Line featured Six-Track Dolby Stereo (A encoded baby boom format) and full-frame imagery blown up from Super-35.

Columbia circulated 70mm Six-Track Dolby coming-attraction trailers for Crossroads, Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life is Calling, The Karate Kid Part II Murphys Romance, Quicksilver and Violets are Blue during the release of A Chorus Line. Other studios circulated 70mm trailers during this period, as well. Ultimately, any 70mm trailers screened during 70mm presentations of A Chorus Line varied by venue and screening.

Note that some of the presentations included in this listing may have been presented in 35mm during the latter week(s) of engagement due to contractual terms or print damage and the distributors unwillingness to supply a 70mm replacement print or because the booking was moved to a non-70mm-equipped auditorium within a multiplex. As well, the reverse may have been true in some cases whereas a booking began with a 35mm print because the lab was unable to complete the 70mm print order in time for an opening-day delivery or the exhibitor negotiated a mid-run switch to 70mm. In these cases, any 35mm portion of the engagement (or movement out of a branded auditorium) has been included in the duration figure.
