        "text": "“Once I sent her to jail, once I shot at her, once I left her for another woman and once I sent her over a waterfall.” – Fred MacMurray summing up his four films with Barbara Stanwyck at her 1987 AFI Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony.\n\nMyrna Loy and William Powell scored in comedies, Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy remain famous for their musicals, Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd found chemistry in noir films and so on.\n\nThen there’s Stanwyck and MacMurray, who appeared in the same number of films together as Lake and Ladd. But not only did their movies show range, they ran the full gamut of genres, from romantic comedy to film noir to Western to melodrama.\n\nAs Stanwyck says in 1955’s THERE’S ALWAYS TOMORROW, “I’ve never been one for casual acquaintances.” In Barbara Stanwyck: The Miracle Woman, Dan Callahan observes that was true of the actress in her personal life, too. Stanwyck kept a small circle of close friends throughout her life in Hollywood, and one couple consistently invited to her home over the decades was Fred MacMurray and his wife. That friendly rapport the duo shared made their movie collaborations that much more vivacious and believable. Let’s take a look at each, shall we?\n\nREMEMBER THE NIGHT (‘40)\n\nREMEMBER THE NIGHT takes the cake as my favorite Stanwyck and MacMurray pairing. The film bursts with warmth and wit in a way that’s unpretentious yet efficacious, benefiting from Mitchell Leisen’s tender albeit firm direction, Preston Sturges’ sentimental and intelligent script (which Leisen altered quite a bit to account for his stars’ best qualities) and strong performances from Stanwyck and MacMurray that hit a range of emotions. Shoplifter Lee Leander (Stanwyck) finds that love reforms her crooked ways, while her prosecutor, John (MacMurray), shifts from an enterprising DA to a man willing to break numerous laws for his sweetheart. What I find interesting about REMEMBER THE NIGHT is the divergent moral trajectories Lee and John take over the course of the film. Indeed, Sturges summed it up by saying: “Love reformed her and corrupted him.” And who better – or funnier – to see in that scenario than Stanwyck and MacMurray?\n\nDOUBLE INDEMNITY (‘44)\n\nUndoubtedly the duo’s most famous film, DOUBLE INDEMNITY also features two of the most heartless characters Stanwyck and MacMurray ever played. And that maliciousness – particularly the fact that both are cold-blooded murderers – almost stopped the stars from signing on… until director/co-writer Billy Wilder used some appropriately devious methods to secure them. The director confided to Stanwyck that he could get MacMurray for the part – if she said yes. While she mulled it over, Wilder played the same game on MacMurray. “There being nobody, then or now, whom I respect more, not only as an actress but as a person, I said okay,” MacMurray recalled. And the rest, as they say, is history – from Wilder and Raymond Chandler’s script bursting with sexual tension; to Wilder’s decision to understate the film’s violence; to John Seitz’s sharp, ominous cinematography and of course, Stanwyck and MacMurray’s unscrupulous, brazen performances. The result, as Time put it, was “the season’s nattiest, nastiest, most satisfying melodrama.”\n\nTHE MOONLIGHTER (‘53)\n\nReleased at the height of the original 3D craze, THE MOONLIGHTER failed to capitalize on what the technology had to offer, being a modest black-and-white Western about a cattle raider (MacMurray) who flees jail and returns to his hometown, where he finds his old flame (Stanwyck) engaged to his brother. Though some outlets, like The New York Times, wondered why Stanwyck and MacMurray would board such a low-rate production, the actors themselves received praise from many reviewers, even if the picture didn’t fare as well critically. Perhaps that’s because both stars appear comfortable with the no-nonsense characters and grittier genre; heck, Stanwyck even performed many of her own stunts, including a spill down a waterfall!\n\nTHERE’S ALWAYS TOMORROW (‘55)\n\nBy the time director Douglas Sirk’s THERE’S ALWAYS TOMORROW came along, Stanwyck and MacMurray had known each other around the same amount of time their characters did: 20 years. That connection served them well for this melodrama which finds them playing old lovers tempted by loneliness (for her) and the monotony of family life (for him) to rekindle their past romance. As Homer Dickens writes in The Films of Barbara Stanwyck, “It was soap opera, but the suds were kept under control.” Indeed, the drama in THERE’S ALWAYS TOMORROW unfolds more modestly than some of Sirk’s better-known pictures, but the heartbreak packs the same emotional punch. Though the picture wasn’t a huge hit at the time, Stanwyck and MacMurray’s tender turns in complex emotional roles elicited positive reviews. The result is a squarely mature, honest look at the realities and consequences of love and the decisions we make in our lives."
