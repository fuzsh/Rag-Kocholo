        "text": "Listen to this episode on Apple Podcasts.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck’s first marriage helped to inspire A Star is Born. Her second marriage, to heartthrob Robert Taylor, didn’t make sense in a lot of ways, but the pair were united by their conservative politics. Both joined the blacklist-stoking Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, but only Taylor testified before HUAC. Called to shamed MGM for forcing him to star in wartime pro-Soviet film Song of Russia, Taylor would become the only major star to name names. Today we’ll talk about Taylor and Stanwyck’s relationship, and the difference between her groundbreaking career as the rare actress who refused to sign long term studio contracts, and his much more conventional experience as MGM chattel.\n\nShow notes:\n\nHere is a list of published sources that the entire season draws from:\n\nThe Red and the Blacklist: An Intimate Memoir of a Hollywood Expatriate by Norma Barzman\n\nDalton Trumbo: Blacklisted Hollywood Radical by Larry Ceplair and Christopher Trumbo\n\nTrumbo: A biography of the Oscar-winning screenwriter who broke the Hollywood blacklist by Bruce Cook\n\nWhen Hollywood Was Right: How Movie Stars, Studio Moguls, and Big Business Remade American Politics by Donald T.
