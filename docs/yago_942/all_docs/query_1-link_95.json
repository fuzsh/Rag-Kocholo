        "text": "On Sunday July 19th and continuing on through Monday July 20th, Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events will present a limited time special screen of Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity in select cities (I’ve had the pleasure in owning the limited Blu-ray edition of the film as well as a few other merchandise items regarding the timeless quintessential film noir classic, more of which will be revealed later on down the line); in December of 2012, Turner Classic Movies dedicated its Star of the Month tribute festival to the star of the film noir I’ve mentioned previously, the Oscar nominated classic film and television actress Barbara Stanwyck\n\nwhose birthday is celebrated today with countless classic film lovers everywhere, Yesterday TCM showcased an indelible list of films (10 in all) from her illustrious film career & I thought that now would be the perfect time to post my tribute in her honor; I’ve always considered her to be a part of my Cinema’s Forgotten Legends Series blog posts that I contribute on their Classic Film Union website not just for the fact that she was nominated for 4 of her finest film performances (1937s Stella Dallas, 1941s Ball of Fire, 1944s Double Indemnity and 1948s Sorry, Wrong Number) but also that she was so incredibly versatile & multi-faceted in her performance. I’ve since become a lifelong fan of hers whenever I view those unique and standout characterizations from classic films that either not too many are familiar with, have become vastly underrated yet cinematic worthy film gems or haven’t been able to garner the attention of being shown too often on TCM/other TV stations like The File on Thelma Jordon (1950) for instance. The latter is a classic film noir, a thrilling yet romantic gem of a film starring another great classic film actor from Hollywood’s Golden Age…Wendell Corey. It’s one in which I highly recommend that you have the chance to view when given the opportunity! Barbara Stanwyck is definitely one of my Top 10 classic film actresses with whom to this day I have the upmost respect and appreciation for; like my role model Marilyn Monroe, I’ve deeply enjoyed viewing many of her films and that more individuals should give that selfless cinematic recognition of Stanwyck’s film career that can otherwise be severely lacking in the modern film media of today (especially regarding how some critics feel about certain classics). That’s not to say ALL individuals are following the latter statement; it’s just that so many that I knew in my childhood wouldn’t even consider Barbara Stanwyck to be a definitive silver screen artisan….rather they would rather state that Stanwyck belongs to the “Gramps generation”, take one long look at someone like Snooki for instance, and proclaim something like “There goes the greatest reality star actress to ever hit the big screen!” To each his own, I’d say to myself, but to be quite honest they really don’t know true genuine talent until they take a glimpse at Barbara Stanwyck and learn from her compelling, poignant performances just how awe-inspiring she really was on/off screen\n\nBorn Ruby Catherine Stevens on Tuesday July 16th 1907 to Byron, a brick layer, and Catherine McGee Stevens as well as having 4 other siblings: Maude, Mable, Mildred (Millie) and older brother Malcolm Byron “Bert” Stevens later known in his life as actor Bert Stevens. When Ruby was 4 years old, her mother died tragically in a trolley accident by a drunk and in the process her father abandoned his children in mad grief after the death of his wife; she was eventually brought up by her elder sister Mildred after which in her lifetime grew up mostly in a series of foster homes. Ruby was of Scots-Irish and English descent which attributed partly to her brief work as a fashion model in the late 1920s as well as her numerous other accolades that contributed to her early work including making a television commercial for Lustre Creme Shampoo, L&M Cigarettes on the Lux Soap radio program & working at the local telephone company for $14/week; when she wasn’t busy working hard, Ruby spend her free time pounding the pavement in search of dancing jobs. After adopting the stage name from an inspirational theatrical poster that read simply “Jane Stanwyck in Barbara“, Ruby Catherine Stevens became Barbara Stanwyck & moved onto Hollywood in 1928 where a year later she made her first feature film in the classic talkie The Locked Door (1929) starring Rod LaRocque & Zasu Pitts. After finding her cinematic limelight from the stage & silver screen, Barbara continued to strive on the silver screen but her claim to fame would come 6 years later in the classic 1937 tear jerker Stella Dallas\n\nCo-starring John Boles, Anne Shirley and Tim Holt, the film became the awe-inspiring start to her 4 Oscar nominations during her illustrious film career. Unfortunately, she didn’t win the Best Actress Oscar for her performance as the titular character (losing to Luise Rainer for her role as O-Lan in The Good Earth with Paul Muni) but despite the loss it didn’t deter Stanwyck from emanating even more exceptional performances later on. She became known also as The Queen of Pre-code films (actor Warren William would also receive the title of The King of Pre-code films later on in his film career) and Stanwyck would receive 3 more Academy Award nods from her film career: in the classic film noir Double Indemnity (1945) which I have to say is Stanwyck at her best and one of my personal favorite films noir that she’s starred in (with a cast that also includes Fred MacMurray, Edward G. Robinson, Porter Hall and Tom Powers), the classic thrilling drama Sorry, Wrong Number (1949) starring Burt Lancaster & finally the screwball comedy Ball of Fire (1942) co-starring Gary Cooper, Dan Duryea and Dana Andrews. Barbara Stanwyck’s film career lasted from 1927-1964, even though it started to decline in 1957, and from 1964-1986 her television started to shine forth including her Emmy Award winning television series The Barbara Stanwyck Show as well as her memorable portrayal as matriarch Victoria Barkley in the classic TV series The Big Valley & Mary Carson in the 1980s TV mini-series The Thorn Birds. Throughout her film career, Stanwyck was known for her kindness and patience with the younger generation; her co-star in Clash by Night (1952), actress Marilyn Monroe, stated that Stanwyck was the only member of Hollywood’s older generation who was kind to her\n\nBarbara Stanwyck was considered a gem to work with for her serious but easy going attitude on set; she was also a consummate versatile professional with a strong realistic on screen persona. Her profound versatility in films encapsulated her performances by being able to adapt to any film role from any film genre from classic melodrama like Stella Dallas and thrillers like Double Indemnity to comedies like The Lady Eve & westerns like Union Pacific; she worked hard & passionately as a motion picture/television actress yet never allowed her star quality to go to her head, which was why she was deemed a favorite for incomparable film directors like Cecil B. DeMille, Fritz Lang & Frank Capra (the latter using Stanwyck more than any other film actress he’s worked with). Stanwyck’s many friends included Mae Carke, Joel McCrea & his actress wife Frances Dee, Jane Wyman, William Holden, Loretta Young, Henry Fonda (whom had a lifelong crush on as well as a rumored affair with), Claudette Colbert, James Stewart, Jimmy Cagney, George Brent, Robert Preston, Jack Benny and his actress wife Mary Livingstone, Gary Cooper, Fred MacMurray, Joan Blondell, Bing Crosby, Dixie Lee, Oscar Levant, Katharine Hepburn, Nancy Coleman, Ronald Reagan, Richard Long, Lee Majors, Linda Evans, Joan Crawford, Julie London, John Forsythe, Bette Davis, Aaron Spelling, Tony Martin, Richard Basehart, Lucille Ball, Jean Arthur, Pernell Roberts, Richard Anderson, Barry Sullivan, James Whitmore, William Conrad & countless others.
