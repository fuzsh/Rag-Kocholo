        "text": "On screen and off, Barbara Stanwyck was a force to be reckoned with! A gifted actress and powerful personality, she captivated fans during her 60-year Hollywood career. Take a look at some of the highlights of the great lady’s life, before, during and after she rode into The Big Valley.\n\nShe was born on July 16, 1907 in Brooklyn, New York. Her birth name was Ruby Catherine Stevens.\n\nShe was orphaned at the age of 4 after her mother died suddenly and her father abandoned her.\n\nShe attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, New York but dropped out at age 14 to work.\n\nOther Erasmus alumni include, Barbra Streisand, Mae West, Beverly Sills, Neil Diamond, Bobby Fischer and Mickey Spillane.\n\nShe got her first show business job at age 17. She was a chorus girl and made $40 a week in the Ziegfeld Follies.\n\nShe worked briefly as a fashion model in the late 1920’s.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck’s stage name was inspired by a theatrical poster that read, “Jane Stanwyck in Barbara Frietchie”.\n\nReferring to the beginning of her career, “I just wanted to survive and eat and have a nice coat.”\n\nShe became a Broadway star soon after she was cast in her first leading role in Burlesque in 1927.\n\nHer first film was the 1927 silent film Broadway Nights. She lost the lead role since she couldn’t cry in the screen test.\n\nThe Locked Door in 1929 was her second film appearance, her first starring role and her first “sound” film.\n\nShe was considered for the role of Scarlett O’Hara in Gone With The Wind.\n\nReferring to her role in the movie, The Great Man’s Lady, “There’s a woman like me in every great man’s life.”\n\nShe was listed #11 on the American Film Institute’s “100 Years of The Greatest Screen Legends”.\n\nShe married twice- first to actor Frank Fay and then to actor Robert Taylor. Both marriages ended in divorce.\n\nUnable to have children, Barbara and first husband Frank Fay adopted a son, Dion Anthony “Tony” Fay, in 1\n\n932.\n\nRegarding the 4-year age difference of her second husband, “The boy’s got a lot to learn and I’ve got a lot to teach.”\n\nShe was voted the 40th “Greatest Movie Star of All Time” by Entertainment Weekly.\n\nFor the premiere of her movie Union Pacific, President Roosevelt remotely opened the auditorium doors from the White House.\n\nIn 1944, when she earned $400,000 the government listed her as the nation’s highest paid woman.\n\nShe was considered the thorn in producers’ sides while she was the joy of their hearts.\n\nDouble Indemnity was the most important film of her career setting the standard for all film noir pictures.\n\nShe is often called “the best actress who never won an Oscar”.\n\nIn 1982, she won an Academy Honorary Award for superlative creativity and unique contribution to the art of screen acting.\n\nOn acting, “My only problem is finding a way to play my 40th fallen female in a different way from my 39th.”\n\nIn 1954, she starred with Ronald Reagan in the western film Cattle Queen of Montana.\n\n“Career is too pompous a word. It was a job, and I have always felt privileged to be paid for what I love doing.”\n\nShe was a recipient of the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award.\n\nDuring her career she acted in 85 films within a span of 38 years, then she turned to television.\n\nIn 1957, she moved from film to television. She won an Emmy for The Barbara Stanwyck Show,which aired from 1961-1962.\n\nReferring to The Barbara Stanwyck Show, “That wasn’t me for a second. I was so happy when it was canceled.”\n\nThe Big Valley on ABC made her one of the most popular actresses on television winning her an Emmy.\n\nHer refusal to portray Victoria Barkley as fragile was controversial at the time.\n\nOn The Big Valley, “I try to make Victoria Barkley as human as possible… She’s an old broad who combines elegance and guts.”\n\nShe appeared in 103 of the 112 episodes of The Big Valley, more than any other actor in the series.\n\nShe was an actress in 2 series with Linda Evans: The Big Valley and Dynasty.\n\nShe was inducted into the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1973.\n\nShe secretly dated actor Robert Wagner for 3 years. He was 23 years her junior.\n\nRobert and Barbara remained life-long friends. She was wearing a necklace he had given her when she passed away.\n\nShe won her third Emmy for her work on the television mini-series The Thorn Birds.\n\nEarl Hamner, Jr. wanted Barbara as the lead role on Falcon Crest. She turned it down. It went to Jane Wyman.\n\nHer acting career in both movies and television spanned 60 years, including roles in The Furies, Wagon Train, The Maverick Queen, The Big Valley, California, and more.\n\nShe died at age 82. Her ashes were scattered over Lone Pine, California where she made some of her western films."
