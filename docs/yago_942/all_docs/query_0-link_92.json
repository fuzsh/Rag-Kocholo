        "text": "Tattle Tales (Barbara Stanwyck & Frank Fay, producers). Eastern theatre-goers are likely to forget that the West Coast, too, has its legitimate theatre. A sample of it is Tattle Tales which, having toured the Pacific slope and then made its way toward the Appalachians by easy stages, finally arrived on Broadway. Its reception was not encouraging to Frank Fay, oldtime vaudeville master of ceremonies, and his cinematically successful wife, Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nMr. Fay, whose hair is red and long, belongs to that school of comedians originated by the late, droll Raymond Hitchcock. He takes personal charge of the proceedings, tells the audience what is going on backstage and when a joke is too feeble to put itself across. Mr. Fay has an assistant who starts shouting, “Eh? Eh?” This is not very funny.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck’s contribution to the show is of the sort which used to delight backwoods cinema audiences. She re-enacts bits from two of her old pictures, Ladies of Leisure and The Miracle Woman. There are two talented dancers, Beuvell & Tova, and one song which most radio listeners have already heard and admired, “I’ll Take An Option On You.”"
