        "text": "Like anyone with a passion for the golden age of Hollywood, I thought I knew all about Barbara Stanwyck. I was wrong.\n\nI’d seen many of her dozens of features and been mightily impressed by her trifecta of knockout performances in “Stella Dallas,” “Double Indemnity” and “The Lady Eve.” But I still thought of the actress as a kind of second-tier star, not quite up there with one-name luminaries such as Hepburn, Davis and Garbo. It took a new UCLA Film & Television Archive series to set me straight.\n\n“A Lady to Talk About: The Films of Barbara Stanwyck,” at the Hammer Museum, near the University of California-Los Angeles, is showcasing 18 of Stanwyck’s films (the series continues through June 10; see www.cinema.ucla.edu). The pictures – from 1931’s “Night Nurse” through 1957’s Sam Fuller-directed “Forty Guns” – led to the adage that Stanwyck was the best actress never to win an Oscar (nominated four times, she received an honorary Oscar in 1981).\n\nSeeing more of Stanwyck’s films made me realize her dazzling versatility, her willingness to do what a given film demanded.\n\nBorn Ruby Stevens in 1907, she was a chorus girl by age 15. At 21, she married vaudeville headliner Frank Fay, a decade her senior, and went with him to Hollywood, but their careers went in such opposite directions that some sources claim the marriage was a model for the classic “A Star Is Born.”\n\nNo one has ever played wised-up as convincingly on screen as Stanwyck. When her Phyllis Dietrichson looks over at Fred MacMurray’s Walter Neff in “Double Indemnity” and drawls, “I think I know what you mean,” there is no doubt that she does.\n\nBut to see the actress as exclusively hard-boiled is to assume that it’s what she does best. In fact, Stanwyck had a remarkable ability to make each aspect of her persona seem as if it is quintessentially her.\n\nThis was never more true than in her Oscar-nominated performance as the title character in the three-hanky movie 1937 version of “Stella Dallas.” Stanwyck’s Stella is a feisty striver who is so hungry for upward mobility she doesn’t see how she is hurting her own chances. Stanwyck’s performance is so affecting because we always glimpse the innocent under Stella’s awkward, venal calculations.\n\nWhat Frank Capra noticed the first time he directed her in 1930 – “Stanwyck doesn’t act a scene, she lives it” – was a gift that never left her."
