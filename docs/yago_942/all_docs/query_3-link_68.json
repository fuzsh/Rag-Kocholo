Barbara and her sibling, an older sibling named Malcolm Byron, were raised by their older brother, Laura Mildred.\n\nBarbara’s young life was spent in many foster homes where she never lived long enough to develop an attachment. From her early days, she began to display the independence and formidable personality that would make her one of Hollywood’s top talents.
