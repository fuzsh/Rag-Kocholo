        "text": "A thread in the Powder Room, \"Comments You Get When You Dress Vintage,” veered into a lively and interesting discussion about gays in the Golden Age of Hollywood. So before the original thread got hijacked, I thought we could move the conversation over here.\n\nI love to read books on old Hollywood and the topic of how same-gender relationships of characters were portrayed in those old films (both pre-code and after), documented bacchanalia of silent screen stars when they weren't on the screen, and the extremes the studios went to keep their top money earners closeted from the adoring (and ticket purchasing) public is a fascinating peek at another side of the silver screen. Thought it would be worthwhile to give the subject it’s own thread.\n\nRock Hudson was a good example of someone who was such a box office hit that studios did everything they could to keep his image as a ladies' man intact. Most people know about his marriage to Phyllis Gates, the secretary of his agent. But before that, Confidential magazine was ready to put Rock and his boys on the cover of their magazine. The studio got word of it and offered up a lesser star (and friend of Rock's), George Nader, to Confidential instead. The expose ruined Nader's career in the US, but he went on to do well in Europe. Rock knew that Nader's downfall in Hollywood was because of his star power being protected, so Rock made provisions for Nader in his will.\n\nThe unjustly-forgotten comedienne Patsy Kelly is my favorite other-side-of-the-fence-walker, and unlike most of her contemporaries she was out in the open about it. She was very successful as a second-lead comic relief figure in films of the thirties, but she got a bit too rowdy in the forties, and by the postwar era she was pretty much unemployable in Hollywood. So she moved in with Tallulah Bankhead -- who was very well known for swinging from both sides of the plate -- and became her *maid,* as well as filling in in other capacities as needed. There's an HBO miniseries in that story somewhere.\n\nLa Bankhead, meanwhile, seems to have been insatiable. A late friend of mine was in a show on Broadway with her in the mid-thirties, and was propositioned almost immediately. Being an innocent Southern girl, my friend had absolutely no idea what Tallu was getting at, and it didn't dawn on her until years later....\n\nThere is a grand story about Barbara Stanwyck, gathering blooms on both sides of the fence, poker games at Robert Taylor's house, John Wayne... ah well. Another time. ;-)\n\nThere are interesting whispers about the close neighbors Katharine Hepburn and Greta Garbo.\n\nAnd then there's Billy Haines, who, after being ruined as a silent film star by being outed, went on to a greater career as Interior Designer to the Stars.\n\nWhat? The Duke?\n\nI believe the beautiful Richard Barthelmess was rumoured to swing both ways; Nazimova, Clifton Webb and the Sal Mineo/James Dean/Natalie Wood stories spring to mind...\n\nFunnily enough, as I write this my copy of \"Wonder Bar\" is staring at me; I seem to recall some pretty racy lavender behaviour in that film...\n\nI find this whole subject fascinating too and I'm glad it's been started!\n\nThe story of Cary and randolph circulated at the time and they just laughed it off then. There no evidence that he was gay, bisexual or anything else. You will not find a less homophobic person than me. I have many gay friends and a number of heroes who are or were gay. I really really object though to stories being made up where there is not one SHRED of evidence to back it up. I work in evidence.... 22 years in criminal investigation and a degree in history before that. Evidence is not some hack author quoting 'a close friend' (unnamed) saying 'oh yes, Cary/Errol/Clark was a complete queen!'. Charles Higham and more recently David Bret have made careers in making lies up about dead people. Annoys the he'll out of me (as you can tell!)\n\nThe story of Cary and randolph circulated at the time and they just laughed it off then. There no evidence that he was gay, bisexual or anything else.

Another time. ;-).\n\n\"Gathering blooms on both sides of the fence.\" Never heard that before; that cracks me up! Barbara Stanwyck was married to Frank Fay, a not so beloved vaudeville-to-film actor who was also believed to gay. His other love was alcohol, and many folks believe the original \"A Star Was Born\" was based on their relationship. Fay's style of comedy was very similar to Jack Benny's and if TCM ever shows \"Matrimonial Bed\" (1930) again, I recommend it for it's enjoyable comic timing.\n\nAnd the rumours about Oscar Wilde being gay. The truth came out in Blackadder Goes Forth: Corporal Punishment. It turns out, the prosecutor was just THAT good:\n\nBlackadder: I remember Massingbird's most famous case: the Case of the Bloody Knife. A man was found next to a murdered body. He had the knife in his hand. 13 witnesses had seen him stab the victim. And when the police arrived, he said \"I'm glad I killed the ba***rd.\" Massingbird not only got him off; he got him knighted in the New Year's Honours List. And the relatives of the victim had to pay to wash the blood out of his jacket!Perkins: Yeah, he's a dab hand at the prosecution as well, sir.Blackadder: Yes, well, look at Oscar Wilde.Perkins: Oh yes, butch ol' Oscar.Blackadder: Big, bearded, bonking, butch Oscar. The terror of the ladies. 114 illegitimate children, world heavyweight boxing champion and author of the best-selling pamphlet \"Why I Like To Do It With Girls.\" And Massingbird had him sent down for being a woopsie."
