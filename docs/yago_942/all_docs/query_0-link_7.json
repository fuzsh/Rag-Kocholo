While playing the famed Palace Theater in New York he was its highest-paid performer, drawing $17,500 weekly.\n\nHe invaded the films as a master of ceremonies in \"Show of Shows\" in 1929. Besides numerous film appearances, in 1950 Fay wrote, composed, produced and appeared in a revue, \"If You Please,\" in San Francisco."
