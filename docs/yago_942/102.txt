“Barbara Stanwyck was twenty-two when on August 26th, 1928, in St. Louis she married a twice-divorced comedian ten years her senior. The Great Faysie, as Frank Fay styled himself, was a cocky, conceited and outstanding wit of vaudeville who never missed a beat. He was also, according to Harry Hay, a fellow actor who became the founder of the modern gay movement in California, a closet homosexual. A week at New York’s Palace Theater was every vaudevillian’s dream, two weeks an accomplishment. Fay was the only song-and-dance man to play ten successive weeks at the Palace, at 17,500 a week in 1925 dollars. Hollywood scouts combing stage doors for actors with voices for dialogue brought to newlyweds to California in 1929. After a promising start, Frank sank into alcoholism and spousal abuse while Barbara established herself as an actress with a trademark sneer and alluring, all-business delivery. Heterosexual males found the suggestions of smutty sex in many of her films provacative. Lesbians enjoyed her perversity and control.”
