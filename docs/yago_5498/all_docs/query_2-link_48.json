Not only made me laugh (again and again) but brought tears to my eyes' Jonathan Franzen 'One of the most brilliant satirical novels about life in East Berlin' New York Times\n\n'A kind of miracle ... Not only made me laugh (again and again) but brought tears to my eyes' Jonathan Franzen 'One of the most brilliant satirical novels about life in East Berlin' New York Times\n\nThomas Brussig's classic German satire, translated into English for the first time and introduced by Jonathan Franzen, is a comedic, moving account of life in East Berlin before the Fall of the Berlin Wall\n\nThe Short End of the Sonnenallee, is a satire set, literally, on the Sonnenallee, the famed \"boulevard of the sun\" in East Berlin.\n\nWithin this boulevard lives Michael, an adolescent who faces daily ridicule whenever he steps out of his apartment building and comes into view of the observation platform on the West side. \"Look, a real Zonie. Can we take your picture?\" Hopelessly in love with the most beautiful girl on the street, Michael is batted away in favour of the Western boys who are free to cross the border. What chance does Michael have, and how much trouble will he get into by pursuing her?\n\nLaugh-out-loud funny and unabashedly silly, Brussig's novel follows the bizarre, grotesque quotidian details of life in the German Democratic Republic. As this new translation shows, the ideas at its heart - freedom, democracy and life's fundamental hilarity - hold great relevance for today.\n\n'Gentle comedy ... Funny, rueful' Telegraph\n\nAbout the Author\n\nThomas Brussig is the author of nine novels, including Wasserfarben and Helden wie wir. He also wrote the screenplays for two film adaptations of his novels Helden wie wir and Sonnenallee. Born in East Berlin, Brussig now divides his time between Berlin and Mecklenburg.\n\nJonathan Franzen is the author of six novels, including The Corrections, Freedom, Purity, and Crossroads, and five works of nonfiction, most recently The Kraus Project and The End of the End of the Earth. He lives in Santa Cruz, California.\n\nJenny Watson is an associate professor of German at Marquette University. Since receiving her PhD in German and Scandinavian literature, Watson has published many books and articles, including German Milwaukee, \"Selma Lagerloef: Surface and Depth,\" and Scandinavia and Germany: Cross-Cultural Currents. She lives in Milwaukee, Wisconsin."
