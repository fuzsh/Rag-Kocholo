        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nIntroduction Eros and Exchange At the end of Leander Haußmann’s 1999 film, Sonnenallee, a light romantic comedy set in East Germany in the 1970s, the camera pulls back through the open border to the West, and the color fades to black and white. On the sound track, Nina Hagen sings: “Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen, mein Michael” (You forgot the color film, my Michael). In suddenly—and polemically—remembering to forget its own “color film,” Sonnenallee anticipates and satirizes the reactions of a Western audience. As in the scene where the hero and his best friend sarcastically pantomime “oppression” for a West German tour bus, Sonnenallee here assumes it knows what is expected of it, and adjusts accordingly. As Christiane Kuehl remarks in a review of the film for Berlin’s Tageszeitung, Whoever came back from there [the GDR] reported one thing above all, and it was the same thing that dominated every report made by curious newly united Germans after ’89: that it was damned gray over there. The GDR was gray. Gray walls, gray streets, gray air, ashen faces. Always the same sentence, sometimes an additional one: over there you felt like you were driving through a black-and-white movie from the ’50s. With mock astonishment, Kuehl describes the overturning of this image in Sonnenallee: “Leander Haußmann made a color film. About the GDR. The GDR gleams.” As many of its reviewers were quick to point out, Sonnenallee’s colors were rendered particularly bright by the lens of Ostalgie, or “nostalgia for the former East Germany.” In the words of a review of Sonnenallee in Der Spiegel, Nostalgia is shorthand for “how lovely it was back then,” and Ostalgia for “we really had it good in the GDR,” even if, yeah, yeah, under further consideration a few things were not so nice back then. Ten years after the fall of the Wall, former East Germans (Ossis) remember above all the pleasant things…. Sadness sinks into the depths of memory, details blur. (Wellershoff) Reveling in its gleeful forgetfulness, Sonnenallee caused a minor scandal—even before its release. In their review of Haußmann’s film, Kerstin and Gunnar Decker make note of some of this negative press: The film wasn’t even in cinemas yet, and already it met with antipathy. A Berlin city magazine worked itself up to the absurd and intentionally malicious opinion that Sonnenallee reminded one of “Nazi comedies” and of the “West German schoolroom- and barracks-comedies of the ’50s and ’60s.” Overall assessment: “a lack of political instinct.” (277) In January 2000 the organization HELP, which advocates for the victims of political persecution, sued Haußmann on the basis of Germany’s Paragraph 194, which forbids the insulting of victims of state persecution. HELP objected to Haußmann’s creation of a GDR where people “dance in front of the murderous Wall—but not after the fall of the Wall, but rather at a time when this wall was a bloody everyday reality.” Even worse, in the film an “escapee who has been shot down” cries, “but not because of the attempted murder, not because of the pain, not on account of fear in the face of upcoming Stasi-imprisonment, but rather because the bullets shattered his Rolling Stones records” (“Strafanzeige gegen Film Sonnenallee”).1 As if anticipating such negative reactions, Sonnenallee unloads its most biting satire on the tourists who peer over the Wall from a platform on the Western side. For these caricatured “Wessis,” the existence of joy or pleasure on the other side of the Wall is unthinkable: “We’re doing great,” one sneers down at Michael, the film’s hero, near the beginning of the film. “And you?” The others laugh. In another scene the tourists watch Michael dancing on an outdoor ping-pong table. “Hey, a happy commie!” scoffs one of the spectators. Thus, as much as Sonnenallee represents an exercise in nostalgic re-membering for the citizens of the former GDR, it is also a performance for a potentially hostile—or worse yet, humorless—Western audience. In the face of this audience, however, Sonnenallee’s Ostalgie is not entirely unrepentant. During the film’s final tracking shot, speaking over the opening piano chords of “Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen,” the hero observes in a voice-over: “Once upon a time there was a country. And I lived there. And when someone asks me, how it was—It was the most beautiful time of my..."
