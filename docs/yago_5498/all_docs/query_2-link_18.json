Micha Ehrenreich and his friends live in the GDR of the 70s, in a street that begins in the west and ends in the east - the Berliner Sonnenallee. The apartment is tight, and the neighbor in the Stasi. The West uncle smuggles nylons and a green passport lets Micha's mother age for years. East, west: The most important thing for Micha is Miriam, who in turn wants a West German man. Nevertheless, Micha lays her life at her feet and learns to take it into her own hands.\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film Sun Alley:\n\nHandguns\n\nMakarov PM\n\nThe standard sidearm for the Volkspolizei including Obermeister (Master Sergeant) Horkefeld (Detlev Buck), who was also involved in the direction) and the Grenztruppen is the Soviet Makarov PM pistol.\n\nRifles\n\nMPi-KM-72\n\nEast German border guards are armed with MPi-KM-72 rifles with removed slant compensators at the border crossing.\n\nPM md. 63\n\nGrenzer Orlowsky (Michael Klobe) can be seen with a Romanian PM md. 63 rifle at the end of the movie trailer.
