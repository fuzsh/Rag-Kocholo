        "text": "During the years that I lived in West Germany (FRG), East Germany (GDR) was simply that place over there. I had no curiosity (a legacy of East German guards playing games with my passport at the border). However, I am now fascinated. Nor it would seem am I alone, given the spate of books being published in the UK. The three reviewed here have all been published within the last three months.\n\n*****\n\nBeyond The Wall: East Germany 1949-1989 – Katja Hoyer\n\nI am currently listening to the audio book of Katja Hoyer’s comprehensive history. 6 chapters in and I know the hard copy belongs on my shelves. It’s very hard to refer back and review properly otherwise. Hoyer, currently resident in the UK, was born in East Germany and, like many former East Germans, chafes against the prevailing view that their pre-1990 lives are just ballast, and the GDR nothing other than “ a walled-off former Russian colony”, a footnote, an anomaly of history. In her preface she makes the point that the GDR existed for 40 years, longer than the First World War, the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich combined! It became an administration in its own right, not just a Soviet satellite, with achievements of which it could be proud and which should not be ignored. I can confirm that Hoyer hasn’t has set out to whitewash the state but to provide fair commentary to prevent the victors of the Cold War from filing the country away as just another failed totalitarian regime. Full review to follow as a place on my best of 2023 has been reserved!\n\nFor most the Berlin Wall is the DDR’s most infamous achievement. However, there was a certain logic behind the project Walter Ulbricht denied only two months before the first barbed wire fences were erected. The DDR had lost 3 million citizens: 7500 doctors, 1200 dentists, one-third of its academics, and hundreds of thousands of skilled workers. (Beyond the Wall, chapter 5) Without intervention the DDR would have collapsed simply through lack of citizenry. It is hard to imagine that 80% of these people simply walked across the open border and disappeared into West Berlin as they were perfectly entitled to do in the days before 13 August 1961.\n\n*****\n\nSiblings – Brigitte Reimann (Translated from German by Lucy Jones)\n\nSiblings takes place in this pre-wall world, when the decision was not will I risk my life to get to the West, but simply will I go? Will I leave for selfish gain (better living conditions) or will I stay to help build up this new socialist society? This is the dilemma at the centre of the novel.\n\nA tedious, grey tale this is not, however. There’s an argument raging on the first page, as Uli screams at his sister, Elisabeth, I’ll never forgive you! It’s not until the end of the novel that we discover why. In the meantime the siblings’ story takes us into a family that was already been torn asunder with elder brother Konrad’s defection to the West. When he meets Elisabeth for coffee at Kempowski’s in West Berlin, he has become like a foreign country. He no longer speaks her language.\n\nElisabeth is not a party member, but generally in tune with the aims of the socialist system, despite having clashed with it herself. As an artist, she would like to see more freedom of expression, more subjectivity allowed into approved paintings, and she is prepared to argue for that. At one stage she comes perilously close to losing everything (job, reputation, future prospects) when she is denounced after picking her arguments with the wrong person.\n\nDespite this shocking experience, possibly fuelled by misogyny rather than or as well as socialist ideology, Elisabeth remains a supporter of the system, and genuinely wants to make it work. When Uli, to whom she is exceptionally close, informs her that he too intends to leave, she cannot let him go without a fight. Does Elisabeth pick a clean fight or does she play dirty? Does Uli stay or does he go?\n\nThere was a surprising difference of opinion at book group with some seeing ambiguity where I saw none. To be published in the GDR novels had to follow a template: 1) there had to be a supportive protagonist; 2) the story had to be ideologically sound; 3) there had to be a happy ending. On that basis Uli has to stay, but perhaps Reimann is playing subtly subversive games. There are certainly grounds for thinking so. Elisabeth’s arguments for greater artistic freedom are Reimann’s own. The depiction of the defector Markus is surprisingly even-handed. The toll on those working hard for the state is clear to see: a young doctor is exhausted; Elisabeth’s boyfriend, Joachim, a party administrator looks pale and grey. In other places Reimann plays it safe: Elisabeth’s interview with the man from the Stasi is surprisingly gentle, and the Party Secretary who resolves the false accusation against her proves to be quite a reasonable chap.\n\nI feel Reimann walked the tightrope quite successfully. Siblings is no propaganda piece, but an honest depiction of life in the East as it was. Warts and all (though maybe some warts are depicted as pimples.) That said, this version may not be the one originally published in the GDR in 1963. Lucy Jones has translated the uncensored manuscript which was discovered in the spring of 2022.\n\n*****\n\nThe Short End of The Sonnenallee – Thomas Brussig (Translated from German by Jonathan Franzen and Jenny Watson)\n\nBy the time Thomas Brussig published his satire of life in East Berlin during the mid-1980s, the Wall had been gone for a decade, and he could write just as he pleased. He chose to write a story of teenage lads, growing up in the shadow of the wall, taking the situation as a matter of course, and getting up to pranks that teenage lads get up to. The novel, which actually originated as a film, was Brussig said, a way of making peace with the past.\n\nMisha lives on the Sonnenallee, a long road about 5 km in length that was partitioned when the Wall went up. 4.5 km belonged to West Berlin, the short end to East Berlin. At the crossing point on the Sonnenallee and Misha and his mates play up to Western view of the poor East Germans, posing as hungry orphans for the tourist cameras. They sign up to dancing lessons to meet girls. Misha has a crush on the street beauty, Miriam, but she only has eyes for Western lads. They have more pocket money.\n\nOne day Misha receives a letter. Could it be a love letter from Miriam? Finding out is not so easy for the wind whisks it out of his hands, and blows it over the Wall where it comes to rest in plain view in the death strip. From here on in, Misha’s mission is to retrieve it.\n\nOn the other hand, Frizz is obsessed with Western music, his purpose in life to own a copy of the Rolling Stones album, Exile On Main Street. His quest is both real and frustrating as copy after copy slips out of reach. But the exercise turns out to be unexpectedly life-saving and not disconnected with Misha’s mission. How? To tell would be to ruin Brussig’s glorious comic timing, on display from beginning to end.\n\nThe teenagers’ pranks are, of course, not state-sanctioned, and they are pulled up on them. The dark side of the GDR is evident, but not to the extent of spoiling the overall light-heartedness of the piece. The outside world is always visible – the West is just on the other side of the death strip after all – and there are a couple of Western characters, Micha’s uncle and Miriam’s rich western boyfriend, nicknamed the Sheik, who are also gently lampooned.\n\nThis view of life in the GDR does not align with the grim joyless existence the West believes its citizens to have led. Perhaps this is why the journey to English has taken so long and needed a labour of love from both translators, Jonathan Franzen and Jenny Watson, to make it happen. Now that it has, I hope The Short End of The Sonnenallee finds many readers. I recommend it particularly to those who enjoy a good giggle."
