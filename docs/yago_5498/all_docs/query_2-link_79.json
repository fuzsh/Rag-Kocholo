        "text": "Franco-German producer Franz Matthews strikes back with his ‘As I Am’ EP on his own imprint HIFI/LOFI Records, a catchy Indie Dance groover with infamous self-reflecting vocals, that is set to wake up every festival stage this summer. Made of 2 sunny originals and backed up by 3 killer remixes from power producers Vhyce, YAME and Tegel Boys.\n\nAfter a strong 2022 and a string of praised releases, Franz Matthews digs into his spiritual inspirations again with ‘As I Am’. Produced during Matthews’ time spent in Barcelona at the beginning of summer 22, ‘As I Am’ lifts off with a carpet of heavy organs unfolding in a powered up euphoria of synth chords, before a choir of empowering & self reflective gang vocals, reminiscent of early LCD Soundsystem’s ‘Sound of Silver’ days, throw us in our face to fully accept who we are and be proud of our uniqueness. The trip takes us even further in a cosmic festival of funky acid leads which will mind bend any listener that will encounter the path of this catchy happiness filler.\n\nNo-one else other than the fantastic disco pilot crew of Tegel Boys could close this EP more beautifully, with their infamous and obsessive acid-boogie styled hooks, making you want to dance until you can’t feel your legs no more.\n\nRelease Date – 17/03/23"
