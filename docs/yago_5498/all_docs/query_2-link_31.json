        "text": "Description\n\n‘A kind of miracle … Not only made me laugh (again and again) but brought tears to my eyes’ Jonathan Franzen\n\n‘One of the most brilliant satirical novels about life in East Berlin’ New York Times\n\nThomas Brussig’s classic German satire, translated into English for the first time and introduced by Jonathan Franzen, is a comedic, moving account of life in East Berlin before the Fall of the Berlin Wall\n\nThe Short End of the Sonnenallee, is a satire set, literally, on the Sonnenallee, the famed “boulevard of the sun” in East Berlin.\n\nWithin this boulevard lives Michael, an adolescent who faces daily ridicule whenever he steps out of his apartment building and comes into view of the observation platform on the West side. “Look, a real Zonie. Can we take your picture?” Hopelessly in love with the most beautiful girl on the street, Michael is batted away in favour of the Western boys who are free to cross the border. What chance does Michael have, and how much trouble will he get into by pursuing her?\n\nLaugh-out-loud funny and unabashedly silly, Brussig’s novel follows the bizarre, grotesque quotidian details of life in the German Democratic Republic. As this new translation shows, the ideas at its heart – freedom, democracy and life’s fundamental hilarity – hold great relevance for today.\n\n‘Gentle comedy … Funny, rueful’ Telegraph\n\nPublisher Review\n\n‘One of the most brilliant satirical novels about life in East Berlin, in the shadow of the wall’ New York Times\n\n‘Gentle comedy … The fullness of Eastern lives, and their human ordinariness – despite the emptiness and abnormality of the background against which they were lived – is the subject of Brussig’s funny, rueful book’ Telegraph\n\n‘The slim episodic novel The Short End of the Sonnenallee, which was set around the mid-1980s among East Berlin adolescents and evokes their world of feelings and experiences right down to the unfussy syntax, is the purest, brightest, most tender poetry of resistance’ Die Zeit"
