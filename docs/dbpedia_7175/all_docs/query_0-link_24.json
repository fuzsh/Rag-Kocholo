In the Vice-Chancellor’s meet held at Gauhati University on 28th November, 2022. It has been unanimously decided that the NEP 2020 will be implemented in all Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) of Assam from the Academic Session 2023-24 starting from 16th July 2023. Essentially, this will start the beginning of the Four Year Under-graduate Bachelor Degree Programme (FYUGP) in the university and also in Krishna Kanta Handique Govt Sanskrit College.\n\nIn the Vice Chancellor’s Meet held in 28th November, 2022, a Common Course Framework (CCF) for the FYUGP had been agreed upon with following salient features:\n\nThe basic structure of the FYUGP will be as per the broad structure in line with the UGC’s Draft Curriculum Framework\n\nThere will be two semesters for each year with total of 6 semesters for a Bachelor Degree after 3 years (with / without Major / Minor) and 8 semesters for a Bachelor Degree with Honours (or by Research) after 4 years.\n\nThe total credit allocation to be 160 for the FYUGP with an allocation of 20 credits per semester, divided equally among the semesters.\n\nFor a 3-year Bachelor Degree, the credit allocation willbe 120.\n\nThere will be multiple entries and exits as recommended in the UGC Draft Curriculum\n\nAdmission to the FYUGP will be based on allotment of Major subjects at the 1st Semester.\n\nDSC: Discipline Specific Core (Major)\n\nDSE: Discipline Specific Elective (Minor)\n\nIDC: Inter-Disciplinary Courses\n\nAEC: Ability Enhancement Courses\n\nVAC: Value Added Courses\n\nSEC: Skill Enhancement Courses\n\nThe University will follow the Credit & Grade system as given in the UGC’s Draft Curriculum.\n\nThe university has initiated the transfer of credits through Academic Bank of Credits(ABC) as it has registered to ABC in the month of November, 2022.\n\nRegarding the transfer of credits and lateral entries & exists, it has been decided in the Vice Chancellor’s meet held on 28th November, 2022 that a maximum of 40% of total credits for a degree should be allowed to be transferred. As such the student will have to acquire a minimum of 60% of the total credits from the degree-awarding institution.\n\nThe university will fix the modalities for lateral exits & entries of the students.\n\nTo compute the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) the following procedure to be followed:\n\ni) The SGPA is the ratio of sum of the product of the number of credits with the grade points scored by a student in all the papers taken by a student and the sum of the number of credits of all the papers undergone by a student, i.e;\n\nSGPA (Si) = ∑(Ci x Gi) / ∑Ci\n\nwhereCi is the number of credits of the ith course and Gi is the grade point scored by the student in the ith course.\n\nii) The CGPA is also calculated in the same manner taking into account all the papers undergone by a student over all the semesters of a programme, i.e;\n\nCGPA = ∑(Ci x Si) / ∑ Ci\n\nwhere Si is the SGPA of the ith semester and Ci is the total number of credits in that semester.\n\niii. The SGPA and CGPA shall be rounded off to 2 decimal points and reported in the transcripts.\n\nIt was decided in the Vice Chancellors’ Meet at Gauhati University on 28th November, 2022 that a Common Academic Calender is to be prepared and will follow all the HEIs across the State.\n\nAs digital Infrastructure is an integral part of the NEP for ensuring Digital learning, it was decided in the Vice Chancellors’ Meet that all the Universities / Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in Assam will agree to the following points:\n\nCreation of Digital Course and also at the same times the digital resources Repository in the Higher Educational Institutions.\n\nSuch repositories will be made available to the entire academic community through unrestricted digital access.\n\nAt the same time, the digital infrastructure in the HEIs needs to be upgraded for digital empowerment. All institutions thus have put stress on the fact that the Government should start providing these infrastructure facilities to the HEIs as and when needed.\n\nAll the HEIs will start the process of creation of digital study material at their own pace, for the greater benefit of the student community.\n\nAs a part of open and online courses, all the HEIs agrees on the following moocs modalities.\n\nA Maximum of one course(i.e.paper) through MOOCs may be offered per semester.\n\nEach institution will identify and prescribe quality MOOCs paper to facilitate choices as per suitability.\n\nEvery MOOCs course offered by an institution will have its own faculty coordinator.\n\nRegarding the possibility of introduction of a Common University Entrance Test(CET) for both UG and PG admissions, after adequate deliberations and discussions, all the HEIs unanimously agreed in the Vice Chancellors’ Meet on 28th November, 2022 to the following points:\n\nAt present, for both the UG / PG admissions, the existing admission processes should continue. The Universities /HEIs will conduct independent institution-wise entrance test for the academic session 2023-24\n\nThe introduction of a Common University Entrance Test(CUET) to be taken up for implementation from the academic session 2024-25.\n\nFor meaningful implementation of NEP 2020 in the HEIs, all the educational institutions agreed upon maintaining basic minimum skeleton structure for syllabi as the ABC is an integral part of NEP framework. However, Individual autonomy of an institution must be maintained while framing such syllabi.
