        "text": "The merit of Handiqui’s work was duly acknowledged by scholars of the All India Oriental Conference held that year in Bombay and Handiqui was elected the president of the next Classical Sanskrit Session of the All India Oriental Conference held in Locknow in 1951.\n\nHandiqui's third monumental work \"Pravarasena’s Setubandha\" was published by Prakrit Text Society as Prakrit text series XX in 1976 from Ahmedabad under the General Editorship of Professor H.C. Bhayani and Professor D.D. Malvania. \"Prof. Handiqui’s critical translation of Pravarasena’s Setubandha is one of the few woks that mark the highest achievement in the major literary genre of Mahakavya. No recent work of Prakrit literary scholarship matches the present work in richness of the exegetical materials culled after a meticulous scanning of numerous commentaries so as not to miss any significant detail. The Setubandha can fairly compare with the Saptasataka of Hata in points of age, importance and a continuous tradition of high literary esteem. The latter work had quite early received thorough attention it deserved from a scholar of Weber's stature; the Setubandha, it seems, was reserved for Prof. Handiqui’s mature scholarship.\" (Vide General editor’s Foreword).\n\nHandiqui started the work of \"Setubandha\" after his retirement from Vice-Chancellorship, a period of nine years, which he described as sterile. Inspite of his advanced age and failing health Handiqui had spared no pains in making available profuse extracts fromvarious unpublished commentaries. We can have a clear idea about the amount of pain taken by him in respect of the work of Setubandha from the Preface, as Handiqui wrote, \"……………… Dr. A.N. Upadhye at whose suggestion I had undertaken this work passed away to my great sorrow shortly before the publication of the volume. Without his help and encouragement it would have been difficult for me to complete the task in my declining years marked by ill health and bereavement.\n\nSetubandha is a Prakrit Mahakavya composed in circa fifth century A.D. Handiqui translated into English with extract from unpublished commentaries and critical notes. His present volume comprising 800 pages contains a 147 page introduction. In the preface to the first edition of Naisadha-carita he mentioned that he wanted to write on general survey of the Mahakavya literature. Unfortunately this promise he could not keep because of his preoccupation as the Vice-Chancellor of the Gauhati University.\n\nProf. K.K. Handiqui was a scholar of singular distinction, a pioneer Indologist and a philanthropist whose life epitomized an era marked by sacrifice, diligence and devotion to high principles. He is well known for his munificence to literary and educational foundations in the state of Assam. In memory of his beloved wife Hemolata Aideo he established Hemolata Handiqui Memorial Institute, a higher Secondary School at Jorhat in 1962 with his innovative and constructive ideas. He liberally contributed both his knowledge and resources to literary and educational causes in Assam and for the development of Assamese literature. He bequeathed his massive personal library to Gauhati University. He also gave the copy right of all three books of his to respective publishers viz. Deccan College Post Graduate and Research Institute, Poona, the Jain Samskriti Samrakshaka Sangha, Maharastra and the Prakrit Text Society, Ahmedabad.\n\nHis father Radha Kanta Handique is fondly referred to as a Danavira because of his laudable donations for development of women education and Assamese literature. Because of Danvira’s benevolent denations we have in Guwahati the Handique Girls’ College, the Narayani Handique Bhawan for housing the Department of Historical and Antiquarian studies and in Jorhat, the Chandra Kanta Handikai Bhawan as the head quarter of Assam Sahitya Sabha, the largest literary organisation of Assam. The Danvira donated substantially also for the preparation and publication of the Assamese Chandra Kanta Abhidhan in memory of his late lamented sons Chandra Kanta and Indra Kanta. His eldest son Prof. K.K. Handiqui donated liberally for the publication of the subsequent editions of the Chandra Kanta Abhidhan and the maintanence and expansion of the Chandra Kanta Bhawan at Jorhat.\n\nThough he was totally indifferent to them, laurels deservedly came in a big way. He was made President of Asom Sahitya Sabha in 1937 at the age of thirty-nine and President of Classical Sanskrit Section, XVI All India Oriental Conference, Locknow in 1951 and was elected the general President of the Srinagar session of the same in 1961. He received Padmashree in 1955 and Padmabhushan in 1967. He was awarded honorary fellowship of Deccan College, Poona in 1968, a rare distinction reserved for scholars in India and abroad and received only by four others so far. He received the honorary D. Litt. Degree of Guwahati University in 1968 and that of Dibrugarh University in 1972. In 1984 the Sahitya Academy Award was presented to Prof. Handiqui posthumously for the volume comprising his literary works in Assamese KrishnaKanta Handikai Rachana Sambhar, compiled by Prof. J.N. Goswami. He was made the first Sadasya Mahiyan of the Asom Sahitya Sabha, the highest honour conferred on scholars of exceptional merit.\n\nProf. Handiqui attached greater importance to moral excellence than to the cultivation of the intellect and Ibsen’s dictum \"Innocence is the source of all joy and happiness\" was the motto of his life. His character may be summed up by a verse of Pravarasena’s Setubandha : Rare are the honest persons who silently achieve their tasks. Few also are the trees that yield fruit without their following being noticed\". (Setubandha III, 9).\n\nThough celebrated in the world of letters, Handiqui Shunned publicity and was shy of position. He led the life of a true Vanaprasthi Scholar whose entire life was spent in fruitful study and quiet research. Internationally acclaimed Indologist and Sanskritist Prof. Krishna Kanta Handiqui passed away on June 7, 1982.\n\nThe Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department issued a commemorative Stamp in honour of Prof. K.K. Handiqui on October 7, 1983\n\n(This article was published in the first issue of Horizon, the newsletter of KKHSOU and written by Mrs. Ahalya Gogoi)"
