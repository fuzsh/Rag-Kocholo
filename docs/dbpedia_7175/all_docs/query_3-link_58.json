        "text": "The college is located at Na-Ali Dhekiajuli, about 12 kilometers away from Jorhat district Head- Quarter. It is the only higher educational institution in Dhekiajuli, Jorhat a place having its own historical importance from Ahom rule onwards.\n\nWith an ideal academic atmosphere, the college is earning a great reputation amongst the colleges affiliated to Dibrugarh University. Besides the serene academic ambience, the general environmental of the college is very congenial for the students as it is situated far away from the hustle and bustle of city crowd and the din of modern mechanized transport.\n\nThe college campus is surrounded by lush green paddy fields. The transportation system leading to the college is very good. It is easily accessible from Jorhat city and Titabor town. Bus, minibus and magic ply in front of the college throughout the day between Jorhat and Borholla via Titabor. It is worth-mentioning that the college is fully equipped with well-furnished buildings and a big playground with necessary civic amenities. A primary health centre, post-office, telephone exchange, police station, a branch of Assam GraminVikash Bank , shops etc. are all on the outskirts of the College. Presently, the college has only one stream, namely the Arts upto the degree level with major in Assamese, Economics, Education, English, Geography, History, Political Science and Sociology. Various plans are there to promote it as a full grown college fulfilling the most desirous demand of the people of the locality. In addition to the Arts stream, Krishna Kanta Handique Open University has approved a study centre to this college. We expect, this measures will help those ardent lovers of Higher Education who have failed to fulfill their hopes and aspirations due to different reasons. The college is affiliated to Dibrugarh University having final concurrence from the Govt. of Assam in 2004. It is noteworthy to mention that the UGC has extended its 2(f) and 12 (B)affiliations to this institution."
