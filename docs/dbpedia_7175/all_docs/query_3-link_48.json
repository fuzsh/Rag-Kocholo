Many decades ago, he had taken up the cause of education for the deprived and backward people of Assam.\n\nThe Governor said that attaining a formal degree is not the end of education. One should keep learning by being curious throughout their life. Today, when there is rapid change in the field of technology, it has become even more necessary to keep learning continuously. The Governor on this occasion also called upon the students to empower themselves with modern technology to bring about qualitative changes in the society.\n\nKataria also asked the graduates and research scholars to use their knowledge acquired in the university to make a difference to the lives of people in the society especially those less privileged. He also asked the graduates to strive for excellence in their chosen fields to bring laurels to the university, state as well as the nation. He asked them not to compromise with their moral values like truth, honesty and fairness.\n\nThe Chief Guest of the Convocation Prof. Sushma Yadava, in her speech, lauded the efforts of the university in implementing the National Education Policy 2020 from the academic session of July 2023. She laid emphasis on incorporating the Indian knowledge system within the framework of the university course curriculum. While emphasizing on the importance of open and distance learning in the present day context, she highlighted the fact that such type of education system has broken down barriers in terms of resources, position and costs.\n\nVice Chancellor of Krishna Kanta Handiqui State Open University Prof. Rajendra Prasad Das said that the university stands for equity, justice and democratization of higher education particularly among the disadvantaged and marginalized sections of the society. He also mentioned that the university has been striving hard to create an environment for lifelong learning and knowledge creation in order to build a knowledge society.\n\nIt may be mentioned that a total of 10,880 degrees, diplomas and certificates were awarded to the students out of which 13 students were awarded the Degree of Doctorate of Philosophy (Ph.
