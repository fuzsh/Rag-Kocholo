        "text": "About the Company\n\nYear of Establishment1947\n\nNature of BusinessService Provider\n\nIndiaMART Member SinceFeb 2014\n\nGST18SHLS01887E1D7\n\nSibsagar College, a premier institute of higher education in the area, is situated at Joysagar by the side of the historic tank which bears the hallowed memory of Sati Joymati, the Ahom Queen of the 17th century. This college is located amidst a reclusive atmosphere, about 5 km south-west of Sivasagar Town, quite away from the bustle of town-life. It was established in 1947, the year of our independence, reflecting the spirit of that awakening and has marched along a long way since then. Ever since, it bears a proud tradition of possessing enlightened and accomplished faculty members and an impressive record of academic output. A host of patriots and men of letters were its architects, some of whose names have come to stay in the annals of Asom. Their selfless and enthusiastic commitment had accorded a rich heritage to this college. Special mention may be made of the founder Principal, Padmadhar Chaliha and his son Paragdhar Chaliha, the Principal to follow. Initially, the college was instituted with 86 students and 7 staff members at a hall in Sivasagar town. In 1952 it was shifted to its present location where one by one its buildings began to emerge, through the munificence of many of the roll of patrons. It was initially affiliated to Gauhati University. In 1965, its affiliation was transferred to Dibrugarh University as soon as the latter was founded."
