        "text": "Biometric attendance does not let us go loose. Every morning, I walk to work. And my fingerprint does the honor. Two times a day. Five days a week. Baring Saturdays and Sundays. We remote clock-in and clock-out during Work From Home (WFH). I passed out of university last year. New habits somehow add discipline to my everyday life today.\n\nBeginning of a beginning: Engineering the cycle of life\n\nI joined Vantage Circle last year. It is my first job. Thanks to our Training and Placement (T&P) Cell at Tezpur University. I work as a Copywriter. I am assigned websites and social media copies. The job role needs me to be creative. The workplace is interesting.\n\nGuwahati does not feel new. My graduation days in the state capital let me explore the city enough. But today’s schedule counts in work commitments. It brings with it a lot of equations. For example, we missed classes out of choice at university. Would you do it today? Time management is such an art. You got the keyboard and the internet.\n\nGardening please? We water the plants and see them grow!\n\nLast year, I moved out of the hostel. The otherwise end of “student life.” And honestly, I miss the campus. Most of my friends shifted out of the Northeast. It takes some courage, I suppose. Adapting to a whole new environment, new people, new lifestyle.\n\nMy interview with the HRs went well. The office is at Six Mile. My assignment, the CV, the domain round, etc., turned out to be in my favor. It was not limited to mass communication. There were students from several other departments. Someone from the Delhi office called me in a week or two. I was okay with the decent salary; I did not negotiate much.\n\nToday, website wireframes and the formats of writing that follow interest me. B2B SaaS is a broad subject. Corporate dynamics aid your growth as a person. My colleagues are cordial and helpful. EOD, Scrum, OKR, ORM, and CPC are new terms I have learned.\n\nCampus connect carving corporate culture, creativity, collaboration\n\nHow about looking at it the other way? There is an underlying cost in steering the career graph. Mostly professional, the competition is real. Perform or perish. I see 200 colleagues working as me, and I question myself: Where do I stand? Do good if you are to be valued!\n\nAnyway, employee wellness is a priority for our HRs. The company policies care for those who take care of the business. Employee engagement, appreciation, recognition, satisfaction. Teamwork inspires. The office environment is arguably healthy.\n\nAverage day at work: From clock-in to clock-out\n\nMy terms with website copies make me explore the domain. Hero copy, CTA, Header, Footer, Content. The designers take it up. The developers follow up with the technical intricacies. Communication through copy-crafting. Please keep the UI/UX factor in mind.\n\nMore about the office? I appreciate the work-life balance. There are lighter moments at work. Team lunch, office gossip, weekend jammings, annual sports, corporate events. I recall every positive experience since my joining on October 17th last year. “BT248” is my employee code. We use Keka, Human Resource Management Software. (HRMS)\n\nEmployee perks and the “desired” work-life balance\n\nLunch at the canteen comes at slashed prices. The employer pays 50%, and we pay the other 50%. Paid internships attract promising talents. Enroll in a course for your upskilling and get up to ₹10,000/- reimbursed. Health insurance benefits up to ₹ 3 lakhs p.a. that covers you, your spouse, and children, if any. Yoga after work is an offering.\n\nMy colleagues wear a smile to work. Across teams. Marketing, Design, R&D, Frontend, Backend, CX, Mobile App, QA, Corporate Sales. We celebrate birthdays and extend hearty farewells. Team members contribute to gifts and cakes. Coffee is common and customary.\n\nHR initiatives make a positive difference at work\n\nBy the way, mental health support initiatives are encouraging. Avail counseling sessions at your employer’s cost. The focus is on holistic well-being. Team building activities promote togetherness. I received bonsai artificial plants in an in-house lottery recently.\n\nTake a pause. Breathe in. Breathe out. And repeat.\n\nLet me draw your attention to the transition in the last year. Waking up early, I listen to the morning news on the radio. My roommate helps me with breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I enrolled in an online course in copywriting. I also contribute to the family in my limited capacities. Newspaper articles are a humble attempt. All eyes on growth in toto.\n\nPersonally, Guwahati is a comfort zone. Friends from Nagaon or the University are one call away. Although I lost touch with a few, I meet many occasionally. Congenial language. Events in the city are happening. One ride; you are at the scenic Meghalaya.\n\nWelcoming the evident change, yet look back at the yesterdays!\n\nDespite every happy happening, I miss being a student. The best days are from school, college, or university. Life was lively. Does it mean I am not happy today? I am fine. It is the transition that hits. The capacity to adapt varies. Coping mechanisms differ. But for now, I repeat, student life is the best. Mark the long equation with academics.\n\nTomorrow, when I look at today, I might find this better. “Human nature.” My first job has brought me financial independence. It carved punctuality, communication skills, self-motivation, and attention to detail. It also brought in cultural awareness, integrity, gratefulness, and more.\n\nReverence to the Almighty; gratitude to my friends and colleagues!\n\nTomorrow, when we may go home, we will travel with a sense of responsibility. Financial literacy comes with age. My friends who work outside the Northeast visit Nagaon once in a while. They tell me about life out there. The Nagaon connection gets stronger while mutual emotions bridge distances. Oh. Guwahati is ≈120 km away from my hometown.\n\nLet me also tell you. It took me some time to adjust to corporate civility. The “New Life” I refer to has its contagious charm. Maa and Baba expect me to do better. Academic wins have the least to do with everyday practical survival terms. Your colleagues are not your friends.\n\nMeanwhile, please stand by me as I find a balance. I look for a hand to hold on and a shoulder to lean upon. I look for your coveted blessings. My faith in myself fuels good strength. I pray we grow together. That is so much we have crossed. There is so much ahead. With the positive alignments, I wish to keep wearing my smile. And yes, Dear Gaurav, I love you too. ❤️\n\nI walked up to the washroom mid-air. The air hostess announced that we should be back to our seats. Mild turbulence. It was my first flight. To the national capital for the weekend, that midnight. SG8169 from Guwahati.\n\nIt is another weekend this evening. I wish to share a few snippets from my trip to Delhi – Why, When, Where, Who, What, and How – the factors that made it all pretty special. Fine twenty-four hours multiplied by four.\n\nStepping out of my comfort zone\n\nOn Friday night, the 21st of last month, I took the first flight of my life. It was meant to be impressive. From Gate No. 7 at the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International (LGBI) Airport in Borjhar to India’s largest Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport in Delhi. We landed at around 1:00 am on the 22nd. Thanks to the buggy service in a huge stadium-like airport.\n\nNivan is a Delhi University graduate. De-boarding the flight, I took a pre-paid taxi from Terminal 3 to Adarsh Nagar. And at midnight too, we faced good traffic jams. Karn was waiting. On the third floor, C-5, Near Subhash Park at Bye-lane No. 02. They are flatmates in a rented 4 BHK apartment.\n\nDestination Delhi for the weekend\n\nOn Saturday, the 22nd, my “morning” happened in the afternoon. Nivan is my friend. We shared the same school bus. Buildings surround his living space today. I see congested construction from the balcony. Moisture in the air.\n\nNow, my journey begins in the city. I took a metro rail from the nearest Azadpur Metro Station to the Delhi Public Library. You walk through the Sarojini Nagar Market to reach this building painted in yellow. Pin Drop silence.\n\nDelhi Metro follows a line system. From one to nine: Red, Yellow, Blue, Blue, Green, Violet, Pink, Magenta, and Grey lines, respectively. The Airport Express Line (AEL) is orange. Navigate the footsteps painted in these colors at the metro stations. And you get the route. Maps help.\n\nFriends from Tezpur University; Heart and Home in the City!\n\nZeenat from my university told me about Dilli Haat – INA. She works in Delhi. I reached Dilli Haat Metro Station. Another metro, and we went to Rajiv Chowk, more so known as Connaught Place, the frenetic business and financial hub. Lunch at Cafe Sandoz. And next to see the India Gate.\n\nArpita from Dibrugarh was my classmate at Tezpur University. She next shifted to Delhi. She told me about the Safdarjung Tomb. I took a CNG auto-rickshaw. Here is where I met Dipsikha. The moist weather was disturbing. Mausoleum is so lovely; the golden hour adds to the view.\n\nThree of us headed towards the holy Jama Masjid late evening. Times at the university were similar: The factor of togetherness. I entered Jama Masjid. Women are not allowed to get in after the maghrib prayers. Now biryani for dinner at the Al-Jawahar restaurant, inaugurated by Former PM Jawahar Lal Nehru in 1948.\n\nHere, I was fooled into believing I met Shah Rukh Khan. There was a sudden rush in the road ahead. The lifestyle of Ibrahim Qadri and the crowd around him felt crazy. Security and Delhi Police were in no fewer numbers. All of it remains interesting to me.\n\nFrom here to there; footsteps at the National Capital!\n\nOn Sunday, the 23rd, it was slightly raining. I went to Malviya Nagar late afternoon. Dimpal from our university stays here. She works in Delhi.\n\nWe had lunch at a Rajasthani restaurant, Gaon, in Malviya Nagar. Saket is not far. She took me to the Select Citywalk Mall. South Delhi is posh. Too much more than normal. Starbucks coffee, two cups. And a walk there.\n\nJenifar from Nagaon stays at Karol Bagh now. I took a metro and then another auto rickshaw. She and I sat at Sindhi Park. Many people come for their evening exercise. I see couples making out in the open. Blithe.\n\nPriorities that matter; subjects that add meaning!\n\nOn Monday, the 24th, I woke up late. The regular maid made our breakfast. I tied my shoelaces and wanted to visit a temple! And accordingly, went to the Indian Institute of Mass Communication.\n\nIIMC at Rama Krishna Puram is the top J-school in India today. It feels like a dream that was never meant to be mine! Before admission to Tezpur University, I applied for the EJ course. It was three years ago. Sir Raghuvinder Chawla and Madam Surbhi Dahiya advised me enough then. But my bad.\n\nI took another metro from RK Puram to the Qutub Minar Metro Station. It was less than 24 hours; Bandana shifted to Delhi. Arpita took us on the Qutub Minar walk-through. Bandana is from our immediate successive batch at Tezpur University. The minaret in Mehrauli looks fabulous in LED lights.\n\nNavigating the map through the otherwise traffic\n\nThe three of us went to Saket next. Khan Chacha was too expensive. We moved to the Select Citywalk Mall randomly. Gelato Vinto ice cream felt better than Baskin Robbins today. Mrinal da took us on a short drive next.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 25th, I packed my bags. My return flight with Air India was in the evening. There is a baggage check-in facility at the New Delhi metro station. It took me some time, and I boarded a metro to Govind Puri via the Central Secretariat.\n\nDeepsikha works at Okhla 238. The nearest metro station is Govind Puri. My DMRC smart card was out of balance by now. I took my travel ticket with cash. During her lunch break, we shared how a year ago, our times at Tezpur University and the hostels were kind. And life was carefree.\n\nEyes open to exploring; time tucked, up for a little more!\n\nI took an UBER Moto to the nearby Lotus Temple, the Baháʼí House of Worship. It is set among lush green landscaped gardens. From here, I made a video call to my family at Nagaon. I thanked the Almighty for more than one reason. So much to feel blissful about. It was time to exit.\n\nThe Air India flight to Guwahati was delayed. “…There have been some changes in the flight schedule,” read a text message from MakeMyTrip.\n\nDeepsikha and I went to the ISKCON temple. She was done with her office for the day. The CNG auto-rickshaw dropped us to the Hare Krishna Hills. She is from Guwahati. We offered prayers at the temple; returned our coupons to collect the shoes.\n\nI carry every positive turn back home!\n\nIt took me an hour from here to Terminal-3. The airport express line metro from New Delhi is a good facility. Flight No. AI 891 was further delayed. We, the passengers, were seated near boarding gate 28B.\n\n“Goodbye, Delhi.” I looked back from the Passenger Boarding Bridge (PBB), called the airbridge. Reaching Guwahati around 1:30 am, I collected my check-in luggage from Belt No. 2. Air India authorities shared an excellent dinner and coffee while returning to Guwahati.\n\nI was genuinely happy on my first trip to Delhi!\n\nOn Wednesday, the 26th, I reached this table early in the morning, just after sunrise. It was tiring. I took a bath and looked up at the sky from the balcony. Unchaining the bags – a trolley and the one at the back, I did not feel heavy but joyfully overwhelmed.\n\nDelhi can be a dream. Delhi felt promising. There is “something” that you fall in love with. The sacrosanctity of the city. The gesture of hospitality.\n\nI speak to myself. My self.\n\nDelhi can be a dream. Delhi felt promising. There is “something” that you fall in love with. The sacrosanctity of the city. The gesture of hospitality.\n\nThe class was about to get over for the day when we were told of an educational trip to Dibrugarh University in Upper Assam as a part of media practicals and field visit ahead of our mid-term exams last month. It was happening for the first time during these two years in the department. This had to be a feel-good factor. Our subject professor initiated the formalities and the proposal was up for next. Happy we.\n\nOn March 21, ten students from this batch and two Assistant Professors along with a Research Scholar boarded an air-conditioned deluxe bus, AS-12BC-9447, from the Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) stand in Tezpur. The university bus at 6:00 am dropped us from the campus to the town. Few of us abandoned the night’s sleep to wake up early that Monday morning. Bags packed. Journey mapped.\n\nCrossing paths: Forward feels fine, on cloud nine.\n\nBokakhat, Numaligarh, Jorhat, Sivasagar. Moran. It takes around seven to eight hours by-road to reach Dibrugarh. The majestic Kaziranga National Park (KNP) also falls on the way. The breakfast was done by 7:00 am at the ASTC canteen. We took a halt at Demow for lunch at around 1:00 pm. Reached Dibrugarh around 3:15 pm.\n\n“Welcome to Dibrugarh University.” All of us got up our respective seats, took our luggage, got off the bus, crossed the road, and ahead there was “Jyoti Batsora”, the entrance to this magnificent campus. Straight, then right, and left is “Vishraanta”, the guest house, arranged for our accommodation. Courtesy Room No. 101, first floor.\n\nThe impression; Who, Why, When, What, Where, and How!\n\nEstablished in 1965 as a result of the provisions of the Dibrugarh University Act enacted by the Assam Legislative Assembly, DU hosts 177 affiliated colleges and institutes that spread over nine districts of the state. At Rajabheta, five kilometres to the South of Dibrugarh town, the campus is approximately 550 acres. Just beside the National Highway (NH) 37. Loaded with lush green trees and seasonal flowers.\n\nOn March 22, we woke up pretty early after a sound sleep. My roommate prepared two cups of red tea. Okayish. Took a bath next. Light breakfast. Around 9:00 am, we were out for a visit to the Brahmaputra Community Radio Station (BCRS) in Maijan Borsaikia Gaon, 14 kilometres away from our stay. Thanks to the intra-city auto services, Bikram, that runs on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), from Assam Medical College Hospital (AMCH) to Lepetkata; vice-versa. Dr. Manoj Deori is our supervisor.\n\nThis semester has a lot of practicals, we follow!\n\nRadio Brahmaputra 90.4 FM is a community radio platform. It caters to the rural communication needs in Dibrugarh and neighbouring Dhemaji. The team, via official website, claims to be “the first grassroots community radio station of North East.” BCRS is a wing of the Centre for North East Studies and Policy Research (CNES).\n\nThree hours here; focus on functioning and technicalities of community radio broadcast. One of the primary causes of our field trip. Next, took a walk along the southern bank of the mighty Brahmaputra River nearby. Returned to “Vishraanta” for lunch. Power nap. And ever-smiling Prof. Mrinmoy Buragohain called us downstairs.\n\nNow to the Centre for Studies in Journalism and Mass Communication (CSJMC), Dibrugarh University. For a courtesy interaction with the First-year Master-degree students. We were told, they had been waiting for us for an hour. Feelings are mutual. Chairperson Dr. Probin Kumar Gogoi was in Guwahati that Tuesday. In my telephonic conversation with him yesterday evening, he conveyed regards to us all.\n\nWalking through the winds, we search for otherwise wings!\n\nRegional sentiments at CSJMC are seemingly so strong. Has been my personal observation though. At the classroom, during the informal interactive session, their primary language was Assamese. We took to English as we stood up for “Hello, I am ‘xyz’ from the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism, Tezpur University. Nice to meet you.” Or similar. CSJMC is 14-year-old. Yes. 2008 to 2022.\n\nRadio Gyanmalinee 90.8 is a Campus Community Radio Station (CCRS). Our visit here was after that of to the Educational Multimedia Research Centre (EMRC) and Malbhog Baruah Museum. Late Baruah was the proprietor of Rajabheta Tea Estate. We spent around a couple of hours in the process. Productive with new learnings.\n\nRadio Gyanmalinee 90.8 FM started airing on 7th February 2019; the studio of which is situated at the first floor of the building of the Directorate of Open and Distance Learning (DODL). This was yet another important aspect of our field trip. The role of students, and how campus community radio stations are significant in media. Gyan Taranga by Krishna Kanta Handique State Open University (KKHSOU) and Radio Luit by Gauhati University (GU) are the other community radio stations in Assam.\n\nTowards the end, you with a friend, united we stand!\n\nDinner at “Moung-Phi Dhaba”, located below the NH37 Godapani Flyover, was an excellent one. Hosted by Dr. Deori as a token of love. This dhaba is owned by young Santanu Gogoi and Ankur Konwar from Dibrugarh; and has completed 14 years of service last month. Smoked chicken tastes better when shared. Non-veg is a choice.\n\nPrior to this, Me and Prof. Buragohain had gone out for the evening on a ride to the 4.94-km-long Bogibeel bridge. It is India’s longest rail-cum-road bridge; inaugurated in May 2017. What a pleasure to have him as a company throughout. Strict words to wear a helmet for safety and “maintain speed limit on the highway” is a takeaway.\n\nOn March 23, it was to be back to basics. After our breakfast at the guest house, all of us boarded yet another air-conditioned deluxe bus. AS-12BC-9417. The seats were booked via online booking. Yet the ones by the windows were perhaps on a first-come-first-serve basis. Little joys. All seated. “Jyoti Batsora” was behind us now.\n\nThrough the heart, from the brain; tomorrow, please, again!\n\nMost of us slept in the bus during the return journey. But for a halt at Jorhat and lunch at Bokakhat. It was fun. These three days and two nights. Not a weekend. The kind of working days we would look forward to. Reached Poruwa Chariali in Tezpur at around 4:15 pm; took two auto-rickshaws to the university campus. Hostel, there.\n\nThe factor of having no-couples present in the team was an addition for the better. Mention not why. To have like-minded friends is beautiful. More so in a trip as this. Deepsikha, Piyali, Dipa, Trishna, Rukshita, Aditi, Chandrika, Nilutpal and Zeenat. Our senior Geeta Zirdo also accompanied us. She is a Research Scholar. The first such go-out shall be cherished. Now and ever. For it has happened. Broadly good.\n\nAssamese sentiments, team spirit, long journey, physical fitness, healthy diet, and smiling face may be the keywords to reflect a few of the many takeaways from the dozen paragraphs so far. More to it. Meanwhile, with mid-term examinations done for this semester, if we could have the entire batch out. Someday. Together. Sometime. Somewhere. The thought of it adds to the smile. Give it a thought. Be in. You too. 😊\n\nWith a mandatory 7-day quarantine done in the respective hostels, approximately forty students entered into a bright classroom in the second floor of a three-storeyed building, on a warm September morning last year. This was after our internships, as a part of the academic curriculum, following the summer vacations.\n\nApparently, it is winter vacation now. The shift in season is reflective of how time has passed over the months. As we adapt to the changes, we observe how new problems or prospects have been a part of the process. If formal education has been a prescription, the informal-casual extends potential learning opportunities to us.\n\nSanguine summers, Warm winters – New shelter now\n\nLet us skip to the good part initially. That we were called by the administration to resume offline classes, after the otherwise monotonous two-semester-long online system, was a happy happening. Together… no less than a team. All smiles.\n\nHostel, and the life around it, adds to the experience in any university structure. Mess endings are no less than a feast or picnic. Ours is Kanchenjungha Men’s Hostel (KMH), named after India’s highest peak and the world’s third highest mountain. KMH was inaugurated on 31st August 2009. This three-storeyed building has a capacity to accommodate around 400 boarders. Visit Room No. 129, once in.\n\n“Wear a mask, maintain social distancing”, reads a health advisory at the entrance of our hostel. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge, and restrictions surrounding it are tight. Room No. 129 is a double-room, at the ground floor.\n\nStudents are a resource, for the university is a platform.\n\nMCJ. Our Department of Mass Communication and Journalism would welcome you, offering an almost panoramic view, surrounded by flowers and trees. The screening hall, practical labs, audio studio, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enabled classrooms, etc. highlight the degree of infrastructure.\n\nAny assignment that needs enough concentration, rush to the library reading room with your laptop and the water bottle. This is a focal point of Tezpur University. Visitors include faculty members, research scholars, us. According to official data, the central library presently holds 110347+ books, 10360+ e-journals and 10280 back volumes of journals. Refreshment, coffee at the canteen is a feel-good factor.\n\nActivities that add to good times – Calm, Collective, Candid\n\nAS-20-1370. The last seat at that yellow bus. I have this habit of going out on weekends, courtesy Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC), Tezpur University service. The window is an escape, but with margins. The bus travels through Parowa, Mission Chariali, Vartak, Tribeni at specified timings; and the student Identity Card be the ticket to display. How fulfilling… One journey at a time.\n\nThis is a family. A home away from home. We put in efforts to build our space, and the space builds us too. There are unexpected-unfortunate times. Yet, light defeats darkness, love defeats hatred, truth defeats falsehood. Dominant positivity perhaps.\n\nThere is this field, a playground in the heart of the campus. For football, basketball, cricket, badminton, etc. The community hall hosts young talents, extending a platform for music, dance, and the evening get-together at times. This is a multipurpose area, with a shade. The hall reverberates with the sound of music, as small groups of students sit in circles, mostly with a guitar and potential vocalists!\n\nAhead of expectations, everything is a happy consolation\n\nInterestingly, the absence of noise across the campus has the contribution of no-vehicle notice. Pool cycles are a new introduction; cycling is a community practice.\n\nThe swimming pool is closed, as a health precaution amid the pandemic. Imagine a freestyle or backstroke during the golden hour, evening sunset. A would-be treat to the eyes. Oh. The fountain, ahead of the university guest house, also leaves a splash of joy to its visitors. This guest house has online-booking facility. Avail when here.\n\nSo far, so good. All of these combined, add to a healthy university-experience. Look East, West, North, South. Arguably green. The trees take in Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and release Oxygen (O2). Elsewise, we receive fair, and expel that is not. Nature-rich, food for the soul. Holding on to these nutrients, we aim for intended growth.\n\nThree hundred and sixty-five days, plus 365 days.\n\nFriendships are the best takeaway. My batch has a strong bonding among the batchmates; may underline and take pride in it. This batch has students from across Assam districts such as Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Sonitpur, Nagaon, Morigaon, Kamrup, Bajali, Barpeta, Bongaigaon, Goalpara, Cachar, and beyond. The ones from states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, etc. teach us their culture, and vice versa. One from South American country, Guyana.\n\nBatch 2020-22 is promising. Violina is an aspiring artist, Bikash is into photography, Akanshya is into filmmaking, Sweta – Jusica – Didriksha sings so well, Daisy is an athlete, Dipa – Nilutpal is into reporting, Joyshree acts passionately, Kalpa practices cine journalism, Sweata – Mridusmita offers fine make-up, Chandrika – Priya – Nikita – Arpita is into blogs or vlogs at times, Anubhuti – Rashmi have been into student politics, Shruti is an avid reader, Zeenat is a bold anchor, Chandan is a habitual writer, Parthona takes interest in poetry, Bishal is into gaming. These are few among many. The rest are beautiful the way they are. Excluding me, okayish, all so talented.\n\nHandholding… The build-up over the days, or many many weeks.\n\nThese are blessed months. Despite reasons to not, I express my love for this institution, and the people around. These paragraphs hint at timely recognitions here.\n\nOne semester later would be the potential end of our academic lives, stepping into professional next. Cheers to the best of growth and learning. The fourth semester would be our ultimate campus-connect. The hope for a continued home.\n\nTo this team, that feels like a family… I offer my unconditional apology, to anyone, who I may have hurt in the due course of time, for reasons whatsoever. Folded hands. We need to be together. You are a treasure. Then, now, and ever.\n\nFor an emotional me, these are memories that we build over the process. And there would be more. Each friend has a dream. Interdependence brings out so much from within. We nourish these nascent relations. The sanctity of this phase is a perspective that may vary from individual to individual. The days ahead are so very challenging. Yes. This present is the past in future. Today is tomorrow’s yesterday."
