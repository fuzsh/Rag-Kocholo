        "text": "Gurucharan College, established on July 15, 1935, is recognised as one of the leading institutions in collegiate education. It has established a unique identity in higher education in the eastern part of India. The college’s esteemed reputation is not derived solely from its expansive grounds, impressive buildings, or large student body, but rather from its rich academic and intellectual legacy, cultivated over 88-years through the relentless efforts and sacrifices of dedicated individuals who spared no effort or sacrifices in building this monumental institution of higher learning in the Barak Valley. Today, this institution of potential excellence takes pride in its numerous alumni who have distinguished themselves in various professions and vocations of life both within India and on the global stage.\n\nInitially, the college was housed in a Bungalow belonging to the late Promode Chandra Datta in Rongpur, situated alongside the Barak River. However, as riverbank erosion threatened the college's premises, it was temporarily relocated to the campus of the Silchar Normal School, conducting classes in the morning shift. Nevertheless, this temporary accommodation challenge was swiftly overcome as Gurucharan College received substantial support from various sources, enabling it to secure a permanent location in its current state.\n\nGurucharan College owes its existence to the visionary initiative of the late Bishnu Charan Dey Purkayastha, Deputy Inspector of Schools posted at Silchar in the early thirties of the last century. In his endeavor to establish a college in Silchar, he garnered the support of the late Kiron Sashi Nag, widow of late Guru Charan Nag, who generously donated Rs. 10,000 in 1934, for its establishment. The college was named in honor of Kiron Sashi Nag's late husband, Gurucharan, with a particular emphasis on promoting female education. The college was privileged to have Arun Kumar Chanda, a Bar-at-law and the son of the late Kamini Kumar Chanda, as its founding principal. Initially affiliated with Calcutta University, Gurucharan College later shifted its affiliation to Gauhati University in 1949, and following the establishment of Assam University (Central) in Silchar in 1994, it became affiliated with the latter. Presently, the college boasts an enrollment of over 5500 students across Arts, Science, Commerce, Business Administration and Higher Secondary section.\n\nThe course curricula and examinations of H.S Course are conducted as per rules and regulations of the Assam Higher Secondary Education Council. Starting from the academic session 2023-2024, the college has adopted the NEP-2020 curriculum through the FYUG programme. Additionally, since the academic year 2005-06, the college has initiated three UGC approved Career Oriented Programs (value-added courses) through the Department of Commerce. The introduction of various self-financing courses in subjects such as Biotechnology, Computer Science, Ecology & Environmental Science, Mass Communication, Business Administration, Diploma courses in Bioinformatics, Library and Information Science, Bengali Recitation, Spoken Sanskrit, and Manipuri Folk Dance enriches the college's illustrious history. Moreover, the college has dedicated study centers of IGNOU (Indira Gandhi National Open University) and KKHSOU (Krishna Kanta Handique State Open University) catering to the needs of distance education, offering both undergraduate and postgraduate courses, further enhancing its educational offerings. In addition to these, the college recently established a Civil Services Study Centre, funded by State Innovation and Transformation Aayog (SITA), providing resources and support for students aspiring to pursue careers in the civil services.\n\nThe year 2016 marked a significant milestone in Gurucharan College's history, as it achieved reaccreditation as 'A' Grade with a CGPA of 3.11 under cycle 2 by NAAC, Bangalore. It had also been recognised as a College with Potential for Excellence (CPE) by UGC. Notably, the college boasts a well-equipped library stocked with a diverse range of books, journals, magazines, e-journals, and INFLIBNET facility. Moreover, the library collaborates with the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, contributing to the development of the Manuscript Resource Centre and National Manuscript Conservation within its premises.\n\nGurucharan College features several state-of-the-art facilities, including sophisticated Computer Labs, a splendid auditorium, Smart Conference Hall, Smart Classrooms, an enriched Anthropological Museum, a Bioinformatics Centre, and a Biotech Hub. It also includes two well-constructed hostels for male and female students, along with a well-developed playground. Moreover, the college houses two units of NSS, NCC wings for both genders, and other amenities such as separate gymnasiums, a health center, a cafeteria, common rooms for male and female students, and its own printing press. In alignment with government directives, the college has initiated cashless transactions and proudly participates in the Digital India Campaign.\n\nSince its establishment, Gurucharan College, under the adept leadership of our founding principal A.K. Chanda has embraced a notable legacy of work ethic and unwavering commitment. This ethos continually motivates both teaching and non-teaching staff to offer wholehearted support for the uninterrupted progress and advancement of the institution. The objective of the college is: ‘To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield’ underscores its dedication to relentless pursuit of excellence.\n\nGurucharan College boasts of a vibrant cohort of alumni who play the role of major stakeholders in the overall development of the institution. The G.C. College Alumni Association is a non-profit making registered society under the Societies Registration Act XXI, 1860, New Delhi, bearing the Registration No. District/East/Society/556/2013 and has been functional since 2005. The Association maintains a close working relationship with the alma mater by providing useful feedback and collaborating wholeheartedly in its growth and development. The college has always taken great pride in its alumni who have scaled great heights in various fields and made impactful contributions to the society at large. The members of the Association contributed an amount of Rs 99600.00 for the flood affected people who sought refuge in the Model Flood Relief Camp at GC College in the month of July 2022.\n\nThe recent upgradation of the college to the status of a State University by the Government of Assam marks a significant milestone in the institution's history, initiating a new era of growth and development for Gurucharan College."
