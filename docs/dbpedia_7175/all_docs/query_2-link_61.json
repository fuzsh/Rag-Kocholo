        "text": "Promotion of daily cleanliness drive and awareness campaigns under the guidance and leadership of Dr. Sashi Kanta Saikia is very noteworthy. He has contributed a lot in driving many notable revolutionary steps in the field of Swachhta Awareness amidst the masses.\n\nWhenever the words telling the tales about cleanliness, swachhata, safai emerges in anywhere in India, the name of Dr. Sashi Kanta Saikia emerges. Dr. Sashi Kanta Saikia is a noteworthy name in the field of cleanliness and he has sincerely done and is continuously doing a lot in this field by spreading cleanliness awareness programmes around the state in various places.\n\nDr. Sashi Kanta Saikia is the renowned name for the Green Club of DHS Kanoi College and Environmental Movement which he had started after joining DHSK College in 19th June 2015 as the Principal of the College. His ultimate devotion towards the protection of nature and his aim to preserve the beauty and excellency of this prestigious college led him to initiate a revolutionary step by forming the Green Club of DHSK College and Environmental Movement.\n\nThe Green Club of DHSK College and Environmental Movement led to the initiation of various cleanliness works every morning from as early as 5 am everyday under his guidance inside the DHSK College campus.\n\nNo Holidays! No Sundays! No Summers! No Winters! No Hot! No Cold! No Storm! No Rain! Yes, the cleanliness works are conducted everyday and, that too he does this with his utmost dedication as a government servant. And yes, he has done it for more than 2,200 (Two Thousand Two Hundred) days till July 2021, and still continuing.\n\nEvery year the whole world celebrates World Environment Day. Year after year the human race is fighting for the safety of the environment. All these movements towards the protection of environment seems to be partially fullfilled.\n\nThe rate of literacy is increasing with time but it is unable to make people aware of possible consequences of environmental degradation. Everywhere is the effect of pollution, be it in air, water, or land.\n\nIt seems that not all educated people are putting full efforts towards environmental protection, otherwise the increase in the number of educated people should not have increased the level of pollution too. Even it has been also experienced that post meetings organized on the occasion of World Environment Day is left full of garbage with plastic disposables everywhere.\n\nWhy does this happen? Is it for environmental protection or practice towards destruction? Until and unless the human race considers the issue of environmental protection from the heart and stops celebrating the environment day as a matter of tradition only, there is little to no chance that people will be able to protect the environment.\n\nEach and every human being must develop the environmental movement within themselves. Human Being, which is considered the best of all creatures in the world is the only reason behind all kinds of destruction to the environment.\n\nPeople can make small changes with small activities without very much depending on others. But, it does not happen!\n\nWhen Dr. Sashi Kanta Saikia joined as the principal of the World’s largest riverine island Majuli’s Majuli College his heartfelt even much more attached to Nature. The works of maintaining greenery in the Majuli College campus started early morning every day. In this regard, he got special support from night chowkidars Atul Bora, Prasanta Payeng, Rekha Gam, and Diganta Das. They all worked hard towards the cleanliness of the campus and plantation of trees and flowering plants, etc.\n\nSince early morning even after joining DHSK College on 19th June of 2015 as the Principal of DHSK College, he devoted himself more towards the protection of nature.\n\nOn that very day of joining Kanoi College, he was also accompanied by famous literature, journalist and Assistant editor of Agradoot Hemanta Kumar Bharali, and noted social worker Dilip Sarma from Guwahati. They all together had a tour of the surrounding of the college and noticed that for years there was no touch of any painting on the walls. The whole college campus was surrounded by wild grass and plants.\n\nOn that very day of joining, Hemanta Kumar Bharali and Dilip Sarma suggested that something should be done to preserve this prestigious college. The first thing Dr. Sashi Kanta Saikia decided was to develop the roads within the campus as there were no such road connecting all the corners of the campus.\n\nThen he felt that it is not possible to keep such a big campus clean without any dedicated staff appointed for the purpose. Then an idea striked to create a club involving all the third and fourth-grade employees of the campus.\n\nThe employees also liked the idea and thus DHSK college Green Club was formed. Slowly the members started increasing. Employees Ranjit Bairagi, Bonjit Deka, Anupam Dutta, Nitul Dutta, Debaru Bhuyan, Sanjay Baishya, Hemanta Das, Chandra Handique. Krishna Kanta Pao, Manas Baruah, Manoj Sharma, Manavjit Saikia and Gunin Baruah joined the club.\n\nDilip Singh, Teacher of Hindi Primary School Paltan Bazar and ex-student of the college joined regularly in the activities of Green Club. Jyoti Chetia, Deepjyoti Phukan, Purneswar Das, Chandreswar Dutta, Anil Singh, Khagen Phukan, Mitali Chetia, Potuli Borah, Robin Gogoi also joined the club. Students of the college Abhishek Debnath, Gautam Chetia, Rajdeep Hazarika, Bhaikon also joined the club.\n\nAnupam Mahanta who is a railway officer and social worker, Bharat Mahanta a social worker also joined the club.\n\nWith the increasing name and fame of Green Club, the joining of a retired professor of DHSK College named Bijoy Burma also increased the strength of the Club. Debaru Bhuyan also joined the club in a sporadic manner.\n\nThe president and Secretary of the students’ union also joined increasing the strength of the club. They are Bikash Misong, Jubin Buragohain, Ankur Moran, and Krishna Bhujel.\n\nSince June 2015 the members are actively associated with the activities of cleaning the college campus despite of all unfavorable conditions.\n\nPeople say that DHS Kanoi college is not only the college in Assam but probably in all over India where the college campus is cleaned at 5.00 am in the morning forming a club for the purpose. There is no evidence of taking any leave by the members of the green club even in the chilled mornings of December and January.\n\nThus the Green Club of Kanoi College completed 2200+ days till July 2021. If each institute of Assam would have been involved in such kinds of activities then the state of Assam would have been able to set a world record in environmental protection.\n\nThus when the sincere efforts of the Green club spread through social media, people started giving great feedbacks regarding the activities performed by the members of the green club. Actually, the members of green club act towards maintaining cleanliness of the campus. Every day their activities start at 5.00 am in the summers and 5.30 in winter.\n\nTheir job includes but not limited to-planting trees inside the campus, watering the plants, cutting the grasses, trimming the plants, cleaning the dustbin, arranging the desk-benches, cleaning the toilets, stairs, arrangements of all the necessary equipment and vehicles used for cleaning the campus.\n\nDr. Sashi Kanta Saikia, Principal of DHSK College considers it his duty and responsibility to accompany the members in their cleanliness drive as the head of the institution.\n\nDr. Sashi Kanta Saikia says that he wakes up every day at 3.30 am in the morning and after some physical exercises and completing his morning prayers he reach college at 5.00 am and leave for home at 4.55 am. Then he sit for his daily writing activities and leave his table at 9.00 am so that he can reach college by 10.00 am. Even after such a busy schedule, he never feel tired and always remain energetic throughout the day.\n\nSo, to make the activities of Green Club livelier and more interesting some t-shirts and track suits have been managed for the members of Green Club. The activities of Green Club is not confined to the college campus only, even their work spreads to the town area also.\n\nFor the last six years, the members of Green Club are silently taking their cleanliness drive forward and the boarders of the college hostels are also contributing to this drive. On Sundays and holidays, the superintendents of the hostels depute 20 students each to join the green club members in their activities.\n\nFor the continously dedicated activities of Green Club DHSK College had received the All India 2nd Position on Swachhwata short film by NCC. Dibrugarh District Deputy Commissioner had also honored DHSK College for the same.\n\nIn such a way the seed of environmental movement is being sawn in the minds of the students also. Their honorary and relentless efforts should definitely be the source of inspiration for everyone. The efforts of the members of Green Club have made the campus once again lively.\n\nWith the initiative of SOFEC, Green Club, Students’ Union, Teachers Association, Environmental Cell various stuffs like the plastic materials, water bottle, glass, and other plastic materials have also been banned within the college campus."
