        "text": "In the nearly 35 years since he first came to the film world’s attention with his dazzling screen adaptation of Shakespeare’s “Henry V,” Sir Kenneth Branagh has constantly surprised us. Just when we thought he would be content just setting Shakespeare to film, Sir Kenneth has directed an array of film treats, from a neo-noir thriller and a classic Disney remake to a Marvel superhero epic and even a musical comedy. Branagh, who has received Academy Award nominations for his acting, writing, producing and directing, has quickly and clearly become one of the most successful multi-hyphenates of his generation.\n\nIn addition to his eight Oscar nominations (including a 2021 win for writing “Belfast”), Branagh has been nominated for the DGA Award, PGA Award, six BAFTA, five Golden Globe and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Besides directing himself to an Oscar nomination for “Henry V,” Branagh has worked with such acclaimed filmmakers as Richard Curtis, Robert Altman, and most productively, Christopher Nolan, with whom Branagh has collaborated on “Dunkirk,” “Tenet” and “Oppenheimer.”\n\nBranagh is a man of many talents, whether narrating audio books or directing productions for the stage in his spare time, and in interviews, there are always seems to be the next film percolating in his head. So let’s raise a glass and toast the great man by ranking and counting down his 20 best films, ranked from worst to best, both in front of and behind the camera."
