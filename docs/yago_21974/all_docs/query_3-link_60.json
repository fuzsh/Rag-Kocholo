        "text": "1939\n\nGuidance All Ages • 2h 4m\n\nCo-written by Jani Lauzon and Kaitlyn Riordan, 1939 follows a group of Indigenous students in Canada staging a performance of Shakespeare’s All’s Well That Ends Well for the visit of King George VI. When they find parallels between themselves and the characters in the play, far from letting themselves be defined by colonial expectations, they set out to make Shakespeare’s bitter-sweet comedy defiantly their own. Captured live at Stratford Festival, 2022.\n\nAntony and Cleopatra\n\nAll Ages • 2h 32m\n\nShakespeare’s rendering of an epic love affair that shook the foundations of the ancient world comes to vivid life in this Stratford Festival production. Filmed live in 2015, Geraint Wyn Davies and Yanna McIntosh star as the powerful rulers whose insatiable love leads to the greatest of tragedies.\n\nCoriolanus\n\nGuidance All Ages • 2h 29m\n\nCoriolanus traces the turbulent career of its eponymous hero, an arrogant Roman general who turns on the city after being exiled. Stratford Festival's distinctive production adapts Shakespeare's political allegory to explore modern democracy, particularly the connection between public opinion, freedom of speech and social media.\n\nDeath and the King's Horseman\n\nGuidance 13+ • 2h 33m\n\nWritten by Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka and inspired by a true story, this masterpiece celebrates a community striving to uphold its culture in the face of colonial power. In British-occupied Nigeria, a Yoruba king, the Alafin, has died, and it is the duty of his horseman, Elesin, to accompany him into the afterlife. Elesin proudly anticipates his transition to the next world – but the sacred ritual is interrupted, resulting in unforeseen tragedy. Captured live at Stratford Festival, 2022.\n\nHamlet\n\nAll Ages • 2h 46m\n\nShakespeare’s masterpiece unfolds in this acclaimed production from Stratford Festival, in which a ghostly visit proves to be the catalyst for a catastrophic and violent sequence of events.\n\nHenry VIII\n\nGuidance All Ages • 2h 15m\n\nStratford Festival presents Shakespeare’s Henry VIII, a searing drama about one of England’s most romantic yet brutal periods. When King Henry falls for Anne Boleyn, he must somehow divorce Queen Katherine. The consequences will be momentous for the country – and disastrous for the king’s adviser, Cardinal Wolsey, who is losing his grip on power. Captured live at Stratford Festival’s Studio Theatre in 2019.\n\nKing John\n\nAll Ages • 2h 32m\n\nFilmed live at Stratford festival in 2015, Tom McCamus commands the stage as England’s hedonistic and mercurial king in Shakespeare's tale of tenuous rule and desperate measures. This vivid production also stars Patricia Collins as the wickedly ambitious Queen Eleanor.\n\nKing Lear\n\nAll Ages • 2h 36m\n\n“How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!” Shakespeare’s epic tragedy is brought vividly to life in this Stratford Festival production, in which madness descends with brutal ferocity as kingdoms and families are irrevocably divided. Filmed live at the festival in 2015, Colm Feore stars as the ageing king while Sara Farb takes on the role of his banished daughter, Cordelia.\n\nMacbeth\n\nAll Ages • 2h 18m\n\nShakespeare’s tale of a kingdom gained and lost unfolds in this Stratford Festival production, in which the Scottish throne changes hands with ever increasing violence. Filmed live in 2016, Ian Lake and Krystin Pellerin bring to life one of literature’s most infamous marriages, while Michael Blake takes on the adversarial role of Macduff.\n\nOthello\n\nGuidance 15+ • 2h 40m\n\nRumours feed irrational jealousy in Shakespeare’s gripping psychological drama, filmed at the Stratford Festival in 2019. Othello and Desdemona defy racial prejudice by marrying, but deadly malice lurks where they least expect it. Nigel Shawn Williams’ contemporary adaptation exposes the racism and misogyny at the heart of this tragic tale."
