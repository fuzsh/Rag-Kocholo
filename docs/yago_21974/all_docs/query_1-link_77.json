        "text": "The Murder of Sherlock Holmes\n\nPart 1 of 2. Angela Lansbury stars as Jessica Fletcher, a celebrated mystery writer whose penchant for solving crimes leads her into bizarre and colorful adventures. In the premiere episode, Jessica attends a costume party at her publisher's (Arthur Hill) home, where \"Sherlock Holmes\" (Brian Keith) is murdered and Grady (Michael Horton) is arrested for the crime.\n\nField of Queens\n\nWhen Jack (Sean Hayes) convinces tangle-footed Will (Eric McCormack) to join him on a gay soccer team, Will's inept play leaves him warming the bench - which allows him to bond with teenaged Elliot ((Michael Angarano) who also is the last man called upon with his own youth soccer team. Meanwhile, Grace (Debra Messing) is delighted that Karen (Megan Mullally) is giddy in anticipation of her date with a handsome restaurant owner (guest star Andy Garcia, \"Ocean's Eleven\").\n\nEpisode 4\n\nThe boys build motorhomes before setting off for a bank holiday weekend in the West Country to see how each of their creations performs in the real world. Meanwhile, Jeremy is also at the track to test the new Audi R8 V10 Spyder against the latest version of Porsche's enduring 911 Turbo cabriolet. Plus, Andy Garcia takes his turn as the Star in the brand new Reasonably Priced Car."
