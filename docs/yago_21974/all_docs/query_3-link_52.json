        "text": "Shakespeare fans will fall hard for Love's Labour Lost.\n\nMaking his Shakespeare directorial debut, local actor Rob Foell brings his vision to life with one of Shakespeare's earlier comedies, and his decision to set it in the counterculture ethos of the1960s is Foell proof. The striking styles, and culture of the '60s explodes on stage in fine fashion as the comedic tale is moved along with songs of the era, and the sexy sounds of an electric bass.\n\nAlmost every seat was taken by Shakespeare devotees as local thespians turned up the heat while in it, during the sneak-peek performance of Love's Labour's Lost that followed Two Gentlemen of Verona in the bustling core of Duncan at Charles Hoey Park during the final day of the 39 Days of July on Aug. 5. It was a lovely day for Shakespeare in the park, with the entire ensemble shining brighter than the scorching sun under which they performed, competing with the sounds of the city. Not even the roars of racing motorists could break their character.\n\nThe story opens in Navarre with King Ferdinand, played boldly by Jim Cleough, selling the idea of signing an oath to swear off women for three years, while fasting and focusing on study, to his three noble companions Berowne (Brandon Newall), Longaville (Michael Young), and Dumaine (Chadd Cawson). While Longaville and Dumaine are happy to oblige right out of the gate, Berowne offers some resistance, pointing out the guidelines he finds rather harsh. Newall, who has been seen in several Shakespeare productions in the past ,both delivers and delights as the rebellious royal of the pack.\n\nThe king declares that no woman should come within a mile of the court, but the plan goes awry when the Princess of France, played by Laura Sirmul with a comedic authority, shows up with the lovely lasses Lady Rosaline (Lara Brunschot), Lady Maria (Jodie MacDonald), and Lady Katherine (Svea Young) on business regarding the cession of Aquitaine, accompanied by Boyet (Bill Levity), who attends to the princess and her pretty posse. The gents try to steadfast to their oath and have the ladies set up camp in the court, but it's only a matter of time before pretty faces get the best of them, and their word goes out the window as the four nobles find themselves infatuated and foresworn. Brunschot captivates with the perfect blend of sweet, and sass.\n\nThis is only one of the moving parts of one of Shakespeare earliest comedies. There are tons of colourful characters, which goes far beyond the amazing and vibrant outfits of the era, with a kudos and a nod to the production's costume designer Chris Johnson.\n\nEnter Don Armado (Roland Grahame) a Spaniard visiting the court with his trusty page Moth (Jay Wilson) who keeps him on his toes. Grahame breathes such life and bravado into this role, it is hard to keep your eyes off this duo as their interactions are a hoot to watch from start to finish. Other scene stealers include the rustic and illiterate Costard (Liam Wilson), who accidentally mixes up the love letters he was tasked to deliver, with hilarity spilling over from this havoc. Jessica Lyric also commands the stage in the role of Holofernes, not to mention those putting on a performance as the Nine Worthies. The entire ensemble entices as they keep the pace of this Shakespearean romantic romp fresh and fun from start to finish.\n\nWith no more spoilers from me, Shakespeare devotees will want to buckle in for this groovy good time as they watch the hijinks that unfold when giving ones solemn oath quickly leads to being taken aback by the fairer sex. Love's Labour's Lost unfolds against the beautiful backdrop of Gem O the Isle farm located at 2465 Koksilah Rd. in Duncan, with evening performances on Aug. 8, 9, 13, 15, and 17 at 7:30 p.m., and a 2 p.m. matinee on Sunday, Aug. 11."
