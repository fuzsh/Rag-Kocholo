        "text": "Summary\n\nCostume design by Berkeley Sutcliffe for the Princess of France in Shakespeare's play Love's Labour's Lost, Old Vic Company at the New Theatre, 1949.\n\nBerkeley Sutcliffe (1918-1979) was one of the leading stage designers of the mid-20th century. He successfully combined theatre work with a career at the London department store, Fortnum and Mason, where he was head designer, and for which he devised the clock that became the shop's symbol. Sutcliffe was known for the spectacular and amusing scenery and costumes that he created for revue, musicals and pantomimes, but he also designed the classics for the Old Vic Company, creating sets and costumes for The Way of the World (1948), Loveâs Labourâs Lost (1949) and Julius Caesar (1958).\n\nThe production of Loveâs Labourâs Lost, directed by Hugh Hunt, charmed reviewers. R.D. Smith, writing in the New Statesman (29 October 1949), commented that Hunt 'refutes those many scholars and critics who have condescended to this early comedy: he reveals not an outmoded private joke, fit only for donnish crossword diligence or undergraduate-producer exhibitionism, but a witty, satiric, hilarious, well-shaped, warm, exciting, human piece of theatre.' Sutcliffe based his designs on the miniatures of Nicholas Hillyard and Isaac Oliver. In his book Shakespeare in the Theatre (1978) Richard David cited the production as an example of design which âcan positively help the realisation of some of Shakespeareâs effects by instantly creating a mood or striking a keynote that Shakespeare himself is at pains to establishâ. The cast was led by Michael Redgrave as Berowne, with Diana Churchill as Rosaline and Michael Aldridge as the King of Navarre. The Princess of France was played by Angela Baddeley."
