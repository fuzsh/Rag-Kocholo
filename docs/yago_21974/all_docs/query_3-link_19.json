Shakespeare's language reaches its most virtuosic heights in a vivacious comedy that will dazzle and delight.\n\nAbout Stratford Festival\n\nLocated in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, the Stratford Festival is North America’s largest classical repertory theatre company. Each season, they present a dozen or more productions in four distinctive venues producing classics, contemporary dramas and musicals, with special emphasis on the plays of Shakespeare."
