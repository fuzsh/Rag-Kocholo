        "text": "A brand new podcast, hot and fresh out the kitchen, hosted by Ciara Moloney and Conor Hogan.\n\nFor many years, with regard to their film-watching, Ciara and Conor have been theming their months. For instance:\n\nElaine May May (sic) – films starring, written by, or directed by Elaine May.\n\nDarling works (?) of May – William Shakespeare Films.\n\nCartoon June – you know, animated.\n\nSoviet (J)Un(e)(ion) – Films from countries that were once in the USSR.\n\nSometimes the titles of these months are puns, sometimes alliterative. Sometimes, it is awful strained altogether (see above). But it has always been fun. Or at least I hope so. They’ve been doing it long enough!\n\nIn the inaugural (that means first) episode of FFS, Ciara and Conor discuss their May film seasons (Elaine May and William Shakespeare), and Showcase two in particular.\n\nSpoiler: It’s the two films in the title of this episode. Watchlist:\n\nElaine May: https://letterboxd.com/hoganassasin/list/elaine-may-may-sic/\n\nWilliam Shakespeare: https://letterboxd.com/hoganassasin/list/darling-works-of-may-shakespeare-watched/\n\nYou can listen to it here:\n\nAnd you can even listen to it accompanied by the soothing sounds of a Crackling Fireplace. Relaxing!\n\nListen and subscribe on: Spotify (with fireplace) || Apple Podcasts (with fireplace) || Amazon Music (with fireplace) || Castbox (with fireplace) || Pocketcasts (with fireplace)\n\nMentioned in the podcast\n\nJeffrey Salkin article on The Heartbreak Kid: https://religionnews.com/2021/05/20/charles-grodin/\n\nMichael Sragow on Tootsie: https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3404-tootsie-one-great-dame\n\nKenneth Branagh and Love’s Labour’s Lost cast on Charlie Rose: https://charlierose.com/videos/19196\n\nCiara’s article in Ishtar: https://thesundae.net/2019/10/28/you-should-watch-ishtar/"
