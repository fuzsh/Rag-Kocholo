Donate today and help bring Love’s Labours Lost to life.\n\nLogline\n\nLove’s Labours Lost is Shakespeare’s only comedy where the women reject their suitors – a group of downright dangerous men in power. Our pointed satire, filled with dark humor and wit, will center the marginalized voices of Shakespeare’s female characters and highlight how little patriarchal oppression has changed in over 500 years.\n\nSynopsis\n\nA dying, old French King, sends his daughter to meet and hopefully wed the handsome young ruler of Navarre. When she arrives, she is unwelcome. The young ruler has banished all women so that he can focus on studying philosophy, hunting, and combat. But once they meet, the ruler and his friends fall in love with the French Princess and her ladies. Rather than abandon diplomacy and return to where she came, the Princess decides to stay and endure condescension and stalking from her inhospitable hosts.\n\nMeet the Filmmakers\n\nNick Musleh — Writer/Director/Producer\n\nNick attended UCLA’s Theatre program and has been on television and theatre throughout LA.
