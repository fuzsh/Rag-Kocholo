        "text": "Shakespeare’s “Love’s Labour’s Lost” written between 1588 and 1597 is a testament to Shakespeare’s linguistic prowess, containing a plethora of wordplay that may pose challenges for contemporary audiences. Additionally, many characters are based on real kings and noblemen from the time, adding layers of historical context that can sometimes be difficult to grasp.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Long Beach Shakespeare Company’s production of “Love’s Labour’s Lost,” helmed by director Maren English, offers a clear interpretation of the classic play. English’s insightful direction allows the cloaked language and forgotten references within the text to emerge through the action effortlessly.\n\nThe central comic device of the play revolves around three young men who pledge themselves to study and swear off women, only to encounter three young women who inevitably disrupt their idealistic intentions. This collision of ideals and realities forms the crux of the comedic narrative, as the characters grapple with themes of masculine love and desire, the struggle between reason and emotion, and the blurred lines between fantasy and reality.\n\nUnlike typical Shakespearean comedies, “Love’s Labour’s Lost” does not culminate in a traditional marriage ceremony. This departure from convention is noted within the play itself, serving as a commentary on the unpredictability of human relationships and the complexities of romantic entanglements.\n\nThe play’s linguistic energies have often been attributed to Shakespeare’s “youth,” as he was likely around thirty when he penned it. This youthful exuberance infuses the text with a vibrant energy, driving the rapid-fire wit and clever wordplay that are hallmarks of Shakespeare’s comedic style. Likewise the new youthful energy at Long Beach Shakespeare company continues to radiate through all aspects of their productions.\n\nIn more recent times, modern criticism has delved deeper into the play’s framing conception and its intricate representations of gender dynamics and court politics. Scholars have sought to uncover the underlying ideological underpinnings of the play, examining how its structural form and thematic content intersect to create a rich tapestry of wit and romance. Pftftftf….why? Okay I get it, all that is there but it is a comedy and the realities of love and the ridiculous things we do when in it will only make themselves truly known through watching the play performed.\n\nThe ensemble cast, led by Sol Mason as King Ferdinand and Sara Neal as the Princess, delivers performances that breathe life into Shakespeare’s characters. Andrew Tyrell-Smith’s portrayal of Berowne brims with wit and charm, while Amanda Nahin imbues Rosaline with spirit and vivacity. Shane Weikel and Julianne Holmquist shine as Dumaine and Katharine, adding depth and nuance to the ensemble.\n\nHowever, it is Erin Manker’s portrayal of Costard that steals the spotlight. With her impeccable comedic timing and boundless energy, Manker brings the character to life in a way that is both endearing and unforgettable. From her playful antics to her delightful vocal variety, Manker’s performance lingers in the minds of the audience long after the final curtain call.\n\nIn addition to the stellar performances, director Maren English’s creative vision adds layers of visual interest to the production. Anachronistic prop elements and Angelica Alvarez’s impressionistic set painting create a whimsical atmosphere that enhances the play’s comedic elements.\n\nOverall, “Love’s Labour’s Lost” at the Long Beach Shakespeare Company is a triumph of theatrical storytelling, blending Shakespeare’s timeless wit with contemporary flair. With its talented ensemble cast, insightful direction, and vibrant staging, this production offers a delightful escape into the enchanting world of Shakespearean comedy.\n\nUnfortunately, the show is now closed but the next time the Shakespeare Company Has a play up and running get there quick, tickets go fast.\n\n’42nd Street’\n\nIf you like tap dancing you’re going to absolutely thrill to every single number in Musical Theater West’s “42nd Street.”\n\nThe choreography by Cheryl Baxter bursts onto the stage through a crisp and unified cast. Leading the incredible dancers in this production is Emma Nossal as Peggy Sawyer and Quintan Craig as Billy Lawler.\n\nI’ve seen this show multiple times over the last 30 years but I’m here to tell you except probably the Broadway original version I haven’t felt that the cast should completely collapse in exhaustion at curtain call like I did on press opening.\n\nHowever, they don’t — they stand there, smiling, chests barely heaving with breath.\n\nThe tap dancing isn’t the only thing that is big and brash. The direction by Cynthia Ferrer keeps “42nd Street” firmly in the zone of big Broadway melodrama with good old chestnut zingers of jokes delivered with snappy timing by the likes of Bree Murphy as Maggie Jones and Jamie Torsolini as Bert Berry.\n\nMost all of us, now, were born long after vaudeville. I only experienced it through such movies as “The Barkleys of Broadway” and “For Me And My Gal.” They allow you to experience that which our great-grandparents thrilled to.\n\nThe costumes and sets are fun and just fine, as long as you don’t know that the original version was the most expensive show to ever hit Broadway in its day.\n\nThe original costume budget was $500,000 which in 1980 was a ridiculous amount of money to spend on clothing. This creates an opulent platform for this piece of essentially Broadway fluff.\n\nWhat I mean is — we all know the story. A small-town girl goes to New York, gets in the chorus of a Broadway show, and something happens to the leading lady. Wham, our chorus girl is now a star.\n\nSo there’s nothing to sneak up on us and there’s no great twist of fate that we aren’t familiar with, so there is no real strength to the plot. The dancing and singing sit best on a matrix of dazzling beauty.\n\nThe costumes and sets are fine. You’re gonna like it — but you probably won’t be blown away.\n\nAs for the costumes, many of them were lovely and while all of them served their purpose, some of them were unfortunately ill-fitted. Especially, Julian Marsh’s final jacket appeared to have been taken in to the point where a new jacket would have been in order.\n\nI guess here I have to sort of back up and say there was sort of a new twist. Spoilers from here on out.\n\nProduction on Broadway was kind of a strange meta-reality where Gower Champion put his actual girlfriend in the show as the lead playing Peggy Sawyer.\n\nSo the relationship of the director, here played by Robert Mammana as Julian Marsh, and the characters of Peggy and Billy form a sort of love triangle.\n\nHere a new element is introduced, however subtly at one point our director Mr. Marsh tells the kids to go home and forget about the show until tomorrow and then he says he’s going to do it too when his mail stage manager enters he puts his arm around him and they walk off together to forget about the show for a while.\n\nThis helps with some of the scenes that in modern times don’t play so well in regards to male and female relationships on stage. There is a famous scene in the play where director Marsh repeatedly kisses Peggy Sawyer to get her to say a romantic line to her leading man with the right feeling.\n\nOver the years as we’ve approached this modern age that scene has played less and less well, but with the reframing of Julian Marsh you are left to wonder in that moment if he is indeed hitting on her or just being an overly non-consensual director.\n\nIt is revealed in the end when Julian says to Peggy “Those kisses last night were acting but this one is real.” In past productions, he gives her quite a romantic kiss, but in this production, he leans in as if he were going to and then kisses her on the forehead.\n\n42nd Street\n\nWhen: The show runs through Sunday, Feb. 25Where: Carpenter Performing Arts Center, 6200 E. Atherton St.Cost: Tickets start at $28Information: musical.org\n\nEditor’s note: Maren English directed the Long Beach Shakespeare Company’s production of “Love’s Labour’s Lost.” A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the director."
