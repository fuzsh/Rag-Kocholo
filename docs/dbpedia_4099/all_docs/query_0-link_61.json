        "text": "On April 9, at the annual Sea-Air-Space exposition, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro released the 2024 Naval S&T Strategy, which serves as \"sailing directions\" for strengthening collaborative relationships to accelerate delivery of innovative solutions to the US Navy and United States Marine Corps. The Strategy aligns with three primary principles established by SECNAV: Strengthening Maritime Dominance, Building a Culture of Warfighting Excellence and Enhancing Strategic Partnerships. Read the Naval S&T Strategy in greater detail: https://lnkd.in/eDvpAMn Office of the Secretary of the Navy | #SECNAV #STEM #innovation #SAS2024\n\nJoin us in celebrating the future of naval aviation with the latest graduates from the Naval STEM-sponsored US Navy and United States Marine Corps JROTC Flight Academy! ‚úà The Flight Academy offers high school students in Navy and USMC JROTC a unique opportunity to explore potential careers in naval aviation. Out of hundreds of applicants, 26 students completed ground school, and an impressive 20 obtained their Private Pilot's License! ‚ÄúChallenging and engaging STEM programs like the Flight Academy are valuable to nurturing the next generation of Sailor or Marine,‚Äù said Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Kurt Rothenhaus. ‚ÄúThey also pave the way for new innovations and perspectives that will strengthen the fleet and force.‚Äù ‚ú® For the latest news in #NavalSTEM projects, programs and events, follow the Naval STEM Coordination Office on LinkedIn.\n\nInside the latest issue of Future Force: üîπ Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Kurt Rothenhaus reflects on US Navy and United States Marine Corps technological capabilities, both crewed and uncrewed, from the seafloor to space. üîπ A tribute to the life and accomplishments of Don Walsh: How his storied career and extraordinary life have influenced naval research, by our historian, Colin Babb. üîπ Can the Naval Postgraduate School's growing 3D printing and advanced manufacturing capabilities facilitate expeditionary logistics in the United States Department of Defense? The answer is a resounding yes. üîπ Unmanned undersea vehicles save lives and generate enormous amounts of data. As UUVs become more sophisticated, the need for developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning grows. Program officers from PMS 408 and Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific discuss. üîπ A \"rocky\" start? U.S. Marines' training with new NATO partner Sweden is the perfect preparation for challenges over rugged terrain. üîπ Polar pathfinding in a bluer Arctic Ocean is challenging environmentally, meteorologically, strategically, and logistically. But with a little help from our friends, we're still able to protect the seven seas. üîπ In an imaginative look at the future, retired Navy authors envision a U.S. Navy where sailors and their platforms will be connected in more powerful ways than ever. üîπ Naval Information Warfare Center Atlantic continues to make waves with a new manufacturing facility and a new lab in Quantico. üì∞ Read all about it! https://lnkd.in/eb8Dvavu\n\nüö® New job alert: https://lnkd.in/e_HkTqMs If you are a knowledgeable program manager with a serious interest in naval aviation platforms, kinetic weapons and directed- and counter-directed energy weapons, this opportunity is for you!
