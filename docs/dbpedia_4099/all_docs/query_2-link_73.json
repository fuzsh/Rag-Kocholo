Mr. Austin also noted the efforts of Bottlers of Coca-Cola directed toward achieving a better environment. He cited such projects as recycling centers in the United States for the reclamation on one-way glass packages; the collection and recycling of aluminum cans by Bottlers of Coca-Cola in Australia; and the collection for recycling of aluminum bottle caps in South America, where almost all of the Company's products are sold in returnable packages. Mr. Austin noted also the independent funding, by his Company, of a number of major studies into the total environmental impact of all its packaging designed to seek to determine their true cost, from the mining and extraction of raw materials to the dis- posal of waste products. That way, he said, \"we'll be able to make even more intelligent decisions in the future.\" Citing his Company's concern not only for the physical environment, but for the quality of life, Mr. Austin pointed to the Company's efforts toward the development of a protein- rich, nutritional beverage which could aid, the undernourished, and to the Company's efforts in a program in its Florida citrus operations to upgrade the standard of living for the migratory-type wrokers who harvest the citrus. The protein-beverage work, in progress for more than four years, is. not altogether al- truistic, Mr. Austin said, \"We expect to profit from this venture. But so will those whose diets and lives are improved through our efforts. Those enterprises which succeed to the fullest are the very ones which enrich everyone involved.\" The Company's farm labor reform proj- ect, Mr. Austin noted, did not contain the profit motive when it was inaugurated; but today, due to the continuing success of the activity, that factor is now a possibility. With its individual components of better housing, better pay and benefits and im- proved health and educational facilities, the aim of the farm labor program is to stabilize the once migratory labor force and to raise the standard of living of the workers to a parity with other Company employees, Even though Mr. Austin called the pro- gram \"at the beginning of the beginning,\" he noted that with steady employment and normal incentives, the individual produc- tivity rate is going up. The cost to the Company, he said, for equipment, supervisory personnel, transportation and other support requirements, have diminished surprisingly. \"This translates quickly into a more profitable operation and a better return on investment,\" PROHIBITION OF GEOPHYSICAL EAPON OF WAR Mr. PELL. Mr. President, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Oceans and In- ternational Environment, I have been very much concerned over the unofficial and unconfirmed reports that the United States has attempted to modify weather conditions in Southeast Asia as an in- strument of warfare. During the recent Senate recess, a number of informative articles concern- ing this subject appeared in the press. Among these were articles writen by Bruce De Silva, in the Providence Jour- nal and Evening Bulletin; Seymour M. Hersh and John Noble Wilford, in the New York Times of July 3, 1972 ; and by Victor CohnA100?8Md1#~@4S4 July 2, 1972. These articles reinforce my belief that we must move quickly to ban the use of RECORD - SENATE S 11345 - ' all geophysical warfare. in an effort to achieve this goal, I have scheduled hear- ings on July 26 and 27, 1972, to receive testimony on Senate Resolution 281 which I introduced earlier this year. This resolution, which was cosponsored by Senators BAYII, CASE, COOPER, CRANSTON, HART, HUGHES, HUMPHREY, JAVITS, KEN- NEDY, MCGOVERN, MONDALE, NELSON, STEVENSON, TUNNEY, and WILLIAMS ex- presses the sense of the Senate that the United States should seek the agreement of other governments to a proposed treaty prohibiting the use of any en- vironmental or geophysical modification activity as a weapon of war, or the carry- ing out of any research or experimenta- tion with respect thereto. I believe that the articles referred to above will be of great interest to a num- ber of Senators. I therefore ask unani- mous consent that they be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: RAINMAKING IS USED AS WEAPON BY U.S.- CLOUD SEEDING IN INDOCHINA CONFIRMED- CHEMICAL ALSO EMPLOYED To FOIL RADAR (By Seymour M. Hersh) WASHINGTON, July 2.-The United States has been secretly seeding clouds over North Vietnam, Laos and South Vietnam to in- crease and control the rainfall for military purposes. Government sources, both civilian and military, said during an extensive series of interviews that the Air Force cloudseeding program has been aimed most recently at hindering movement of North Vietnamese troops and equipment and suppressing enemy antiaircraft missile fire. The disclosure confirmed growing specula-. tion in Congressional and scientific circles about the use of weather modification in' Southeast Asia. Despite years of experiments with rainmaking in the United States and elsewhere, scientists are not sure they un- derstand its long-term effect on the ecology of a region. SOME OPPOSED PROGRAM The weather manipulation in Indochina, which was first tried in South Vietnam in 1963, is the first confirmed use of meteoro- logical warfare. Although it is not prohibited by any international conventions on warfare, artificial rainmaking has been strenuously opposed by some State Department officials. It could not be determined whether the operations were being conducted in connec- tion with the current North Vietnamese of- fensive or the renewed American bombing of the North. EFFECTIVENESS DOUBTED Beginning in 1967, some State Department officials protested that the United States, by deliberately altering the natural rainfall in parts of Indochina, was taking environ- mental risks of unknown proportions. But many advocates of the operation have found little wrong with using weather modifica- tion as a military weapon. \"What's worse,\" one official asked, \"drop- ping bombs or rain?\" All of the officials interviewed said that the United States did not have the capabil. ity to cause heavy flooding during the sunn- ier in the northern parts of North Vietnam, where serious flooding occurred last year. Officially, the White House and State De- partment declined comment on the use of objectives--muddying roads and flooding lines of communication, But there were also many military and Government officials who expressed doubt that the project had caused any dramatic results. The sources, without providing details, also said that a method had been developed for` treating clouds with a chemical that eventu- ally produced an acidic rainfall capable of fouling the operation of North Vietnamese radar equipment used for directing surface- to-air missiles, In addition to hampering SAM missiles and delaying North Vietnamese infiltration, the rainmaking program had the following pur- poses: ?Providing rain and cloud cover for in- filtration of South Vietnamese commando and intelligence teams into North Vietnam. ?Serving as a \"spoiler\" for North Viet- namese attacks and raids in South Vietnam. Mitering or tailoring the rain patterns over North Vietnam and Laos to aid United States bombing mission's. - iDiverting North Vietnamese men and material from military operations to keep muddied roads and other lines of com- munication in operation. KEYED TO MONSOON The cloud-seeding operations necessarily were keyed to the two main monsoon seasons that affect Laos and Vietnam, \"It was just trying to add on to something that you already got,\" one officer said. Military sources said that one main goal was to increase the duration of the south- west monsoon, which spawns high-rising cumulus clouds-those most susceptible to cloud seeding-over the panhandle areas of Laos and North Vietnam from May to early October. The longer rainy season thus would give the Air Force more opportunity to trigger rainstorms. \"We were trying to arrange the weather pattern to suit our convenience,\" said one former Government official who had detailed knowledge of the operation. ,According to interviews, the Central In- telligence Agency initiated the use of cloud- seeding over Hue, in the northern part of South Vietnam. \"We first used that stuff in about August of 1963,\" one former C.I.A. agent said, \"when the Diem regime was hav- ing all that trouble with the Buddhists.\". \"They would just stand around during demonstrations when the police threw tear gas at them, but we noticed that when the rains came they wouldn't stay on,\" the former agent said. \"The agency got an Air America Beech- craft and had it rigged up with silver iodide,\" he said. \"There was another demonstration and we seeded the area. It rained.\" A similar cloud-seeding was carried out by C.I.A. aircraft In Saigon at least once dur- ing the summer of 1964, the former agent said. EXPAND TO TRAIL The Intelligence Agency expanded its cloud-seeding activities to the Ho Chi Minh supply trail in Laos sometime in the middle nineteen-sixties, a number of Government sources said. By 1967, the Air Force had be- come involved although, as one former Gov- ernment official said, \"the agency was calling all the shots.\" \"I always assumed the agency had a man- date from the White House to do It,\" he added. A number of former CIA, and high-rank- ing Johnson Administration officials depicted the operations along the trail as experi- mental. The state of the art had not yet advanced to the point where it was possible to predict meteorological warfare. \"This is one of those the results of a seeding operation with any 200210 r ng, o o~fiiciallsaicl.

Once we dumped seven inches of rain in two hours on one of our Special Forces camps.\" Despite the professed skepticism on the part of some members of the Johnson Ad-' ministration, military men apparently took the weather modification program much more seriously. According to a document contained in the, Pentagon papers, the Defense Department's secret history of the war, weather modifica- tion was one of seven basic options for stepping up the war that were presented on request by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the White House in late February, 1967. The document described the weather pro- gram over Laos-officially known as Opera- tion Pop-Eye-as an attempt \"to reduce traf- ficability along infiltration routes.\" AUTHORIZATION NEEDED nam, particularly in the north along the Laos is practiced, in food-deficit areas, and in border. \"We tried to use it in connection areas subject to flooding,\" with air and ground operations,\" a military ISSUE RAISED RECENTLY officer explained. One Government official explained more explicitly that \"if you were expecting a raid from their side, you would try to control the weather to make it more difficult.\" This offl- cial estimated that more than half of the actual cloud-seeding operations in 1969 and 1970 took place in South Vietnam. Much of the basic research was provided by Navy scientists, and the seeding opera- tions were flown by the Air Weather Service of the Air Force. By 1967, or possibly earlier, the Air Force flights were originating from a special opera- tions group at Udorn air base in Thailand. No more than four C-130's, and usually only two, were assigned in the highly restricted section of the base. Each plane was capable of carrying out more than one mission on one flight. One former high-ranking official said in an interview that by the end of 1971 the pro- gram, which had been given at least three different code names since the middle nine- teen-sixties, was under the direct control of the White House. Interviews determined that many usually well-informed members of the Nixon Admin- istration had been kept in the dark. In the last year, there have been repeated inquiries and publicly posed questions by members of Congress about the weather mod- ification programs in Southeast Asia, but f t' h s been rovided - a t i The issue has also been raised in recent months by the National Academy of Sciences, on the floor of the United States Senate and at the international environmental meeting at Stockholm last month. Recognizing the many potential problems, the national academy issued a statement last year urging the Nixon Administration to sponsor a United Nations resolution \"dedi- cating all weather modification efforts to peaceful purposes and establishing, prefer- ably within the framework of international nongovernmental scientific organizations, an advisory mechanism for consideration of weather-modification problems of potential international concern.\" Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode .Island, and 18 other Senators recently filed a resolution calling on the United States to join in a treaty outlawing \"any use of any environmental or geophysical modification activity as a weapon of war, or the carrying out of any research or experimentation with respect thereto.\" But, during the Stockholm conference, the United States delegation was instrumental in inserting a weakening clause in a recom- mendation calling for all governments to \"carefully evaluate the likelihood and mag- nitude of climactic effects\" from weather modification and to disseminate their find- ings. U.S. SPONSORS STUDY It said that Presidential authorization was \"required to implement operational phase of weather modification process previously suc- cessfully tested and evaluated in same area.\" The brief. summary concluded by stating that \"risk of compromise is minimal.\" A similar option was cited in another 1967 working document published in the Penta- gon papers. Neither attracted any immediate public attention. The Laos cloud-seeding operations did provoke, however, a lengthy and bitter, al- beit secret, dispute inside the Johnson Ad- ministration in 1967. A team of State De- partment attorneys and officials protested that the use of cloud-seeding was a danger- ous.precedent for the United States. \"I felt that the military and agency hadn't analyzed it to determine if it was in our interest,\" one official who was involved in the dispute said, He also was concerned over the rigid secrecy of the project, he said, \"al- though it might have been all right to keep it secret if you did it once and didn't want the precedent to become known.\" The general feeling was summarized by one former State Department official who said he was concerned that the rainmaking \"might violate what we considered the gen- eral rule of the thumb for an illegal weapon of war-something that would cause unusual suffering or dispropriate damage.\" There also was concern, he added, because of the un- known ecological risks. A Nixon Administration official said that he believed the first use of weather modi- fication over North Vietnam took place in late 1968 or early 1969 when rain was in- creased in an attempt to hamper the abil- ity of antiaircraft missiles to hit American jets in the panhandle region near the Lao- tian border. Over the next two years, this official added, \"it seemed to get more important-the re- ports were coming more frequently.\" It could not be learned how many specific missions were carried out. in any year. One well-informed source said that Navy scientists were responsible for developing a new kind of chemical agent effective in the warm stratus clouds that often shielded many key antiaircraft sites in northern parts of North Vietnam. The chemical, he said, \"produced a rain that had an acidic quality to it and it would foul up mechanical equipment-like radars, trucks and tanks.\" \"This wasn't originally in our planning,\" the official added, \"it was a refinement.\" Apparently, many Air Force cloud-seeding missions were conducted over North Viet- nam and Laos simply to confuse or \"attenu- ate\"-a word used by many military men- the radar equipment that. controls antiair- craft missiles.

States seek a treaty to bar both weather war \"IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE\" and research into it. As chairman of the n e i t - itt Robert M. White, the nation's chief weather man as director of the Commerce Depart-, ment's National Oceanographic and Atmos- pheric Administration (NOAA), declined to discuss military matters in an interview. But to the question, \"Could cloud seeding cause flooding?\" he-unlike Laird-said, \"Yes, it is entirely possible to get heavy rains out of certain clouds.\" \"In the past decade,\" White added, \"there. has been a considerable change of view in the scientific community on weather modi- fication. I think most knowledgeable people would agree that we have. primitive capa- bilities for modifying certain weather pat- terns. And it is reasonable now to look to possible development of more sophisticated ones.\" Among patterns that can \"predictably\" be modified, he said, are: cold fog (which can. be cleared from airfields); cumulus clouds (most common in the tropics-\"In Florida,\" White said, \"we have been able almost at will to make them grow explosively\") ; oro- graphic clouds (moist air moving up over mountains-\"At the right temperature you can begin thinking of milking them for water\") and hailstorms (which can often be suppressed, according to recent claims by the Russians, who fire silver iodide into them from rockets and artillery). Beyond these, there are storms like hurri- canes-as Hurricane Agnes, for example- which cannot yet be reliably suppressed, \"but for which we have some encouraging results,\" in White's view. All in all, he sums up, \"We're beginning to move from a situation where everything that happens in the atmosphere is an act of God to where some things are an act of man.\" THE MORAL ISSUE What perturbs many scientists is the mor- ality of using such \"acts of man\" for mili- tary purposes. The Navy's Saint-Amand emphatically does not see turning weather into a weapon as something inherently evil. \"If you estimate the amount of damage done by impeding someone's transportation versus blowing or burning them up, I don't think it Is so im- moral, \" he told Science magazine. Most scientists, left-wing and establish- ment, seem to disagree. The Science for Vietnam, Chicago Collec- tive-a radical anti-war group of scientists and students who first spotted the passage in the Pentagon Papers-charges: \"The U.S. gov- ernment has embarked on a totally new and insidious form of warfare . (that) could disrupt the economy and social structure of a small country; it could create famine . . . University of Connecticut Graduate Dean Thomas Malone, chairman of the National Academy of Sciences' Weather Modification Panel, likewise says: \".I'm opposed to it.\" He urges a treaty that would not merely ban weather war but go on to encourage interna- tional weather modifications \"in a positive way.\" A 1971 Academy study urged the United States to sponsor a United Nations resolution dedicating all weather modifying to peace. r ees Senate Foreign Relations Comm national environment subcommittee, Pell will try to smoke Laird out further at up- coining hearings, perhaps this month. LACK OF RESPONSE The administration, too, may be consider- ing the subject. But how seriously it is doing so is unsure. The Pentagon's Foster told Gude that the National Security Council Under Secretaries' Committee \"at the request of Dr. Kissinger is currently meeting to formulate a definitive national policy. Presumably this policy, when completed, will be announced to the nation in some appropriate fashion.\" The NSC unit involved is headed by Herman Pollock, the State Department's director of international scientific affairs. He reports that it has considered only peace- ful weather-making, not military. Pell is undiscouraged by lack of adminis- tration response so far to the pleas that it support his proposed treaty, or that the President declare that the United States will never be first to wage weather war. \"I remember what happened five years ago when I first introduced a draft treaty to ban nuclear weapons from the seabed,\" he says. \"I got rather unreal executive branch comment, just as we're getting now. But I knew very well that a strip of missiles along the Atlantic ridge and 'creepy crawlers'- tank-like underwater missile carriers-were on the drawing. board at the Pentagon. \"I see the same process now. I think that given a few years, we'll get some sort of treaty here, too.\" Of all fields of science, Dean Malone has said, none has produced more world coopera- tion than meteorology. \"What, a tragic re- versal it would be if we started using our knowledge to beat one another over the head.\" PELL FEELS U.S. WAGES WEATHER WARFARE (By Bruce DeSilva) WASHINGTON,-The Pentagon has the pow- er to change the weather and already may have used that power to kill and destroy in Southeast Asia. \"I strongly believe clouds have been seeded in Southeast Asia for military rea- sons. There is very little doubt in my mind,\" Sen. Clairborne Pell said during an interview in his Washington office last week. David Kearney, a member of the profes- sional staff of the Senate foreign relations committee, is less cautious. \"I have no doubt at all,\" he said. Senator Pell said he believes the military has been seeding clouds, perhaps beginning as early as 1966, to clear them away from bombing targets in North Vietnam. lie said he also believes seeding with other chemicals has produced torrential rains. The rains have washed-out portions of the He Chi Minh Trail impeding the infiltration of supplies and men from North to South. Vietnam and caused floods which killed thousands, he said. Defense Department spokesmen had ad- mitted that they have the capability to dras- firm, but carefully avoided denying, that such activities are under way in Southeast Asia. Beginning in June of last year and lasting well into the normally dry season in the fall, North Vietnam was devastated by heavy rains, typhoons and floods. According to reports by Pierre Darcourt, a French journalist, the heavy rains triggered mud slides, washed away or weakened roads and breached dikes. The Associated Press reported that flooding destroyed 10 per cent of the country's rice crop and killed thousands. North Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong, the Christian Science Monitor reported, said water levels in the entire Red River and Thai Binh River system rose to \"unprece- dented levels.\" He called the flooding the \"worst disaster since the beginning of the war.\" An act of God? Perhaps. But Senator Pell said he believes the dis- aster was merely the most successful of Pen- tagon rainmaking efforts in the region. The best evidence that the Pentagon is altering the weather is provided in brief re- marks in the Pentagon Papers. The signifi- cance of th remarks apparently went largely unnoticed during the furor of other sensa- tional disclosures in the documents. According to the Gravel edition of the papers, Volume 4, Page 421, the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented President Lyndon B. John- son with a memo in 1967 suggesting that modifying the weather in the region might be one way of widening the war without creating dissent at home. The memo stated In part: \"Laos Operations-Continue as at present plus Operation Pop Eye to reduce trafficability along infiltration routes. Authority/ Policy Changes-Authorization required to imple- ment operational phase of weather modifica- tion process previously successful tested and evaluated in some areas.\" Later that year, the President was pre- sented with a list of escalation proposals, the Papers indicate. The list included the follow- ing item: \"Cause interdicting rains in or near Laos.\" Other evidence concerning the rainmaking efforts are circumstantial. In March of last year, Jack Anderson, a nationally syndicated columnist, claimed in his column that the Air Force has been seed- ing clouds over Laos and Cambodia since 1967. He said the project went by the code name of \"Intermediary-Compatriot.\" Unlike other Anderson columns, such as the one on the ITT memo or the disclosure of a secret U.S. posture during the India-Paki- stan war, this column went largely unnoticed nationally. Last Sept. 23, Senator Pell sent a letter to Rady Johnson, assistant secretary of de- Tense for legislative affairs, inquiring about \"the Air Force weather modification activities against the North Vietnamese.\" The letter, and all subsquent communica- tion, was made public by the senator and was inserted in the Jan. 26 Congressional Record, The letter asked the following questions: \"1. What are the objectives of the proj- ect known by the code name 'Intermediary- Compatriot'? \"2. How long has this project been in ex- istence? Would you provide a rather detailed description of this project? \"3. In what specific countries is this proj- ect conducted? \"4. What amounts have been spent on this project over the last three years? \"6. Is the Department conducting any similar offense-oriented weather modifica- tion programs?
