        "text": "United States manufacturing and innovation are essential to American economic and national security. Maintaining U.S. influence and access to markets in a stable global environment contributes to our prosperity and standard of living. It is the responsibility of the Department of Defense (DoD) to innovate and equip our forces with the best tools possible, made by Americans. The DoD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) enterprise attempts to utilize advanced manufacturing to secure a more lethal force, strengthen alliances and new partnerships, and reform the Department for greater performance and affordability.\n\nThe mission of the program is to reduce the acquisition and supportability costs of defense weapon systems and reduce manufacturing and repair cycle times across the life cycles of such systems.\n\nU.S. Department of Defense, Manufacturing Technology Program: Developing Disruptive & Transformational Solutions\n\nIf we can't make it, the warfighter can't have it!\n\nThis video highlights a few of the innovative projects DoD ManTech has supported across DoD.\n\nThe vision of the program is a responsive world-class manufacturing capability to affordably and rapidly meet Warfighter needs throughout the defense system life cycle.\n\nAlthough DoD ManTech has a singular mission and shared strategic vision, all of the projects and initiatives are selected and executed through the Military Services and DoD Agencies. Each Component has its own ManTech program, with organization-specific processes, mandates, and procedures for executing their projects:\n\nArmy ManTech Program is executed through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT)) with support from the science and technology (S&T) community, Program Executive Offices, and Army Organic Industrial Base;\n\nNavy ManTech Program is managed under the Office of Naval Research and is executed through the Navy ManTech Centers of Excellence;\n\nAir Force ManTech Program is managed by the Air Force Research Laboratoryâ€™s (AFRL) Materials & Manufacturing Directorate and partners with industry, other government agencies, and academia;\n\nDLA Research and Development (R&D) is managed under Defense Logistics Agency J6 Chief Information Operations and has a multi-faceted approach to promote R&D business solutions to industry, academia, and small business by awarding multi-year competitive awards, posting Broad Agency Announcements (BAA), leveraging Other Transaction Authority (OTAs) and teaming with the ManTech Service Components and whole of government partners for cost share and savings; and\n\nOSD MSTP utilizes annual proposal calls based on predetermined, joint-application investment areas. Because OSD MSTP is executed through OSD ManTech Office within the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)), the program also seeks to leverage and collaborate with the DoD MIIs whenever possible.\n\nThe directors and senior managers of these programs coordinate through the auspices of the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP). The JDMTP is chartered to identify and integrate requirements, conduct joint program planning, and develop joint strategies. DoD oversight of the ManTech Programs is provided by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering."
