        "text": "1.0 The Green Berets\n\nThe United States Army Special Forces, more famously known as the Green Berets, are the leading tier 2 Special Operations Force (SOF) of the US Army. The Green Berets’ primary function is to conduct irregular warfare, more commonly known as unconventional warfare (UW) while on deployment in foreign nations. Unlike many other special forces units, they focus on language training to assist in unconventional warfare and training partner militaries. Since their formation, Army Special Forces have been involved in the Vietnam War, the First Gulf War, Afghanistan, and more recently in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n2.0 Motto, Symbols, Insignias, and Patches\n\n2.1 Motto\n\nTheir motto is ‘De Oppresso Liber’ which loosely translates in Latin as ‘To Free The Oppressed’\n\n2.2 Symbol\n\nThe Green Berets insignia comprises two golden arrows crossed together. Additionally, the arrow symbolism represents the USA’s Native Americans and their highly skilled warrior training, a metaphor for the SOF groups within the Green Berets.\n\n2.3 Insignia\n\nTheir insignia is a black and silver crest, featuring the crossed arrows in silver with a V-42 Stiletto dagger faced horizontally, symbolising the Green Berets history with the First Special Service Force from World War Two. Moreover, it features their motto ‘De Oppresso Liber’ written at the bottom of the crest.\n\n2.4 Patches\n\nWith several SOF groups under the 1st Special Forces Command, Green Beret patches, or shoulder sleeve insignias are distinguishable and carry meaning behind them. Likewise, arrows commemorate the Native Indian tribes and their combat skills instilled in all SOF groups in the Green Berets. Additionally, the 1st Special Forces Command patch worn by all SOF groups features three lightning strikes, indicating their ability as a rapid reaction force at both land, sea, and air. Finally, the dagger represents their unconventional warfare abilities.\n\n3.0 History of the Green Berets\n\nThe history of the Green Berets dates back to the Second World War, America’s foreign intelligence service, known as the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), assigned army personnel under their command as Operational Groups to help carry out clandestine operations. Additionally, their lineage descends from the Canadian and US First Special Service Force, conducting UW in Norway. Many members of these groups went on to eventually become Green Berets decades later. (Source) (Source)\n\n3.1 The Case of the Beret\n\nThe distinctive headgear worn by US Army Special Forces too shares its history with the Second World War. During deployment in Britain, many units such as the ranger regiment trained alongside British Commandos who instigated the distinctive beret, influencing other allied nations such as France. During and after the war, many US troops continued to unofficially wear the headgear and it became a distinct signal of US special forces within the military.\n\n3.2 The Devil’s Brigade\n\n1st Special Service Force, or Devil’s Brigade, nicknamed by intelligence officers in the force, was a joint American-Canadian SOF during the Second World War. In the 21st century, both the Canadian SOF and the Green Berets largely trace their lineage to this group. The Devils Brigade saw extensive action conducting UW across Europe against the Nazis. Originally intended to be used to disrupt German heavy water research in Norway, 1st SSF was directed to Italy in 1943.\n\nDuring their deployment, they earned the nickname ‘Black Devils’ or ‘Devil’s Brigade’ by their comrades due to the black face paint they used. Their first engagement was seizing Monte la Difensa, given its strategic value to the Allied invasion of Italy. During this engagement, 1st SSF’s skills were demonstrated and their mountain climbing abilities ascended towards Monte la Difensa. Ultimately, the Black Devils were able to overwhelm the German defences, taking them by surprise at the cover of night.\n\n3.2.1 The End of The Line\n\nThe following engagements also occurred at Monte Majo and Anzio in 1944. During this period, the Devil’s Brigade began conducting UW on German troops. This included extensive reconnaissance patrols deep into German lines along with night missions. As such, German forces became disoriented over the scale and size of the 1st SSF, believing it to be larger than it was. Their final mission involved Operation Dragoon, the invasion of the South of France by Allied forces, seizing strategically important areas. In 1944, the Devil’s Brigade was officially disbanded, with many Canadians moving into the parachute battalions and US’s paratrooper and ranger battalions.\n\n3.3 The role of John F. Kennedy\n\nFormed as the 10th Special Forces Group, the Green Berets were conceptualized to be the leading US Army unit in UW. Subsequently, their creation descends from Major Herbert Brucker, known as the godfather of US special forces. Major Brucker initially became involved in OSS and was later tasked after the war by the Pentagon to help continue special forces groups in UW methods. Moreover, the Green Berets achieved proper recognition when John F Kennedy visited Fort Bragg in 1961. Thus, JFK upon his visit, requested all special forces to wear their Green Berets which at the time had not been authorised headgear made official by the military. Instead, it was this visit which changed that, formalising a special relationship between JFK and Green Berets. Such respect was later distinguished upon JFK’s death, in which a green beret was laid to rest at his funeral. (Source)\n\n4.0 Tactical and Operational Capabilities\n\nFormed as an SOF with expertise in unconventional warfare (UW), the Green Berets conduct eight other primary doctrines tailored to their purpose as an SOF.\n\nCounter Terrorism (CT)\n\nCounter Insurgency (COIN)\n\nForeign Internal Defense (FID)\n\nDirect Action (DA)\n\nSecurity Force Assistance (SFA)\n\nSpecial Reconnaissance (SR)\n\nCounter-proliferation of WMD’s\n\nInformation Operations\n\nLike other SOF groups in the US and NATO, the Green Berets are capable of conducting other secondary missions on behalf of the nations they are deployed to alongside US and foreign forces. However, ultimately answer to their leading US commanders. Further activities include:\n\nHumanitarian assistance, involving peacekeeping and demining\n\nCombat Search and Rescue (CSAR)\n\nHostage Rescuing\n\nCounter Narcotics\n\n4.1 Training\n\nGreen Berets undergo some of the US Army’s most intense and longest training courses. Known as the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC) or the ‘Q Course’, serves as one of the longest training programs in the US Army being 46-56 weeks long. Overall, there are six phases in which candidates must train and pass to become a Green Beret. Before starting in your direct training, candidates undergo a six-week Special Forces Preparation Course to test candidates physical attributes. Following this, 24 days of training ensue at Camp Mackall as a part of the Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS). This includes land navigation courses, the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) and the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB test). The final test is dubbed ‘The Trek’ which sees candidates endure a 32km LRIM. (Source)\n\n4.1.1 Phase 1: Special Forces Orientation Course (7 weeks)\n\nPhase 1 is split into six separate modules and dubbed ‘the orientation and history module’. The course includes educational and most core subjects necessary to be a Green Beret. These include:\n\nModule A Introduction to Unconventional Warfare\n\nModule B Introduction to Special Forces\n\nModule C Airborne Operations and Refresher\n\nModule D Special Forces Planning\n\nModule E Operational Culture and Analysis\n\n4.1.2 Phase 2: Language and Cultural Course (18-24 weeks)\n\nUnderstanding languages and cultures is a time-consuming and difficult process for anyone. As such, phase two is the longest section of the course. The aim behind employing such language skills is to give Green Berets a linguistic advantage in the field. During the phase, the length of time spent on the course is divided between categories 1 and 2 along with 3 and 4, the latter being 24 weeks long. Throughout these weeks, candidates are taught how to speak, listen, and read in their given language. This ends with a final exam where a minimum of 1/1 is achieved.\n\n4.1.3 Phase 3: SF Individual Training (13 weeks)\n\nThe action-packed part of the course, for many, is where they get to hone their skills as a Green Beret. Throughout phase three, candidates will endure small unit tactics training which will involve combat scenarios and critical decision-making skills. Beyond this, candidates will begin to prepare for SERE, a three-week course in survival training and evasion. At the end, candidates will demonstrate their training at the resistance training laboratory to qualify for phase four.\n\n4.1.4 Phase 4: SF MOS Training (14 weeks)\n\nWithin phase four, candidates will have had to pass the previous phases before specialising. SF MOS training showcases five roles for which candidates will endure extensive training.\n\n18A Special Forces Detachment Officer: trained in problem analysis, leadership qualities, and duties.\n\n18B Weapons Sergeant: Highly interoperable and trained in weapons systems globally and within the US. Training involves being able to teach others how to field and use certain weapons as a part of UW.\n\n18C Engineer Sergeant: Technical experts, the skills employed by engineers range from demolition to the improvisation of equipment created in the field.\n\n18D Medical Sergeant: Highly skilled and endure lengthy amounts of training given their role. Medics are highly versed individuals capable of saving lives on the battlefield and assisting in UW operations.\n\n18E Communications Sergeant: the final and equally essential piece into conducting UW. Communication is needed to relay information and intelligence back to the US command structure. This additionally includes the ability to teach and train those in which the Green Berets are assisting on deployment.\n\n4.1.5 Phase 5: SF UW Culmination Stage (4 weeks)\n\nIn this phase, candidates undergo UW training involving subversion and guerrilla warfare for two weeks. Then, candidates take part in a final exercise, in which all their skills are tested. Lasting two weeks, Robin Sage takes place in the fictional country of Pineland in North Carolina and is held across 15 counties. Candidates will go up against an opposition team (OPFOR) of US forces with locals sometimes participating across the 130,000km squared ‘Pineland’.\n\n4.1.6 Phase 6: Graduation (1 week)\n\nWithin the final phase, candidates successfully graduate into Green Berets.\n\n4.2 How to Become a Green Beret\n\nTo become a Green Beret, you must already serve within the US Army and qualify under the following criteria: (Source) (Source) (Source)\n\nBe a US citizen\n\nBe 20 years old and no older than 36\n\nNot served for more than 12-14 years and a minimum of 36 months left of service after graduating\n\nThe rank of E-3 or above\n\nQualified for Airborne school or ranger-qualified\n\nAn ASVAB score above 110\n\nBe eligible for security clearances\n\nFor Officers:\n\nThe rank of First Lieutenant or Captain\n\nA Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) score of 85 or above\n\nBe eligible for further security clearance such as Top Secret\n\nCompleted the Officer Basic Course\n\n4.3 Language Capabilities\n\nGreen Berets are some of the leading experts in linguistical communication during deployment, aiding in their UW role. The SFG’s history behind this highly valued skill rests with the Allied invasion on D-Day. Known as the Jedburgh teams, members consisted of one American, British, and French national with each member required to speak French. The aim of this was to be able to effectively communicate with both French resistance and civilians in UW attacks against German troops in the build-up of the Allied invasion. (Source)\n\nCurrently, Green Berets undergo basic special forces language training at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, covering both written and oral speaking. Overall, language training takes up 24 of the 56 weeks of the Special Forces Qualification Course, being an estimated 45% of the overall Q-Course. (Source) (Source) (Source)\n\n5.0 Organisational Structure and Operations\n\nThe Green Berets fall under the command of the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). In addition to this, USASOC falls under the umbrella of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). Referring back to USASOC, five subordinate units fall within this command structure. The Green Berets are under the command of the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) who oversee four other units. These include the 75th Ranger Regiment, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, Special Operations Aviation Command, and lastly the John F Kennedy Special Warfare Centre and School.\n\nAltogether, the Green Berets fall under the 1st Special Forces Command which is the fifth unit under USASOC. Nonetheless, Green Berets consist of several groups, and each SFG group has a distinct region, role, and history. Additionally, the 1st Special Forces Command consists of the 8th and 4th Psychological Operations Group, and two logistics brigades: 95th Civil Affairs Brigade and 528th Sustainment Brigade.\n\n5.1 1st Special Forces Group\n\nMotto: ‘First in Asia’\n\nHeadquarters: Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, USA.\n\nArea of Operations: Pacific / PACOM.\n\nDoctrinal Missions:\n\nUnconventional Warfare\n\nDirect Action\n\nSpecial Reconnaissance\n\nCounter Terrorism\n\nForeign Internal Defence\n\nInformation Operations\n\nCounter-Proliferation\n\nRegarded as the ‘First in Asia’ and operating in the Pacific positioned at Torii Station, Okinawa, Japan. The 1st Special Forces Group is one of the oldest formed groups dating back to 1955. In continuation, they are tasked with several doctrinal missions across the Indo-Pacific area. Upon the currently active groups’ inception in 1957, the SFG group was deployed to Okinawa and later involved in the Vietnam War as advisors and later involved in UW. Additionally, they assisted in humanitarian missions in the Philippines in 1972. Following the events of 9/11, the 1st SFG was involved in Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan, assisting in UW methods with Afghan and coalition forces.

Based in Europe, the 10th SFG was created to serve as a stay-behind group in the event the Soviet Union invaded Europe to conduct UW and assist with European allies. Additionally, throughout the Cold War, the 10th SFG actively recruited foreign nationals across Eastern Europe under communist rule to help develop their UW methods and knowledge in the event of invasion. Moreover, they provided training to nations in the Middle East throughout the Vietnam era, never deploying to the country.

Additionally, the aim for placing the Green Berets in such conditions is coined by SOCNORTH as the ‘Northern Approach’, this plan will see 10th SFG and others hone their Arctic capabilities making them elite units within such conditions and developing their readiness. The deeper purpose behind such training is the relative strategic importance the Arctic is playing in North American defence due to foreign encroachment and climate change making the area easier to access. (Source)\n\nAdditionally in March 2023, the 10th SFG conducted further Arctic exercises with Finland’s SOF Utii Jaeger under exercise Talvikotta. The aim behind the exercise was to further develop the 10th SFG in their Arctic training and winter warfare capabilities. Ultimately, such training demonstrates the 10th SFG’s preparedness to become a Green Beret specifically prepared for future UW, reconnaissance and direct action in Arctic conditions, matching the ongoing geopolitical circumstances in the Arctic Circle.

Headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, they have been actively deployed on missions in Afghanistan as well as more recently during Operation Inherent Resolve against ISIS. (Source) (Source)\n\nOther Notable Missions\n\nBeing primarily a National Guard unit, 20 SFG saw their first large-scale activation during the first Gulf War.\n\nIn 1995, during Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, 20 SFG saw several rotations in the country. Peacekeeping missions ensued in conjunction with 3 SFG who originally deployed at the start of the conflict. (Source)\n\nIn addition to other SFG units, 20 SFG have been involved in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom acting as support elements.\n\n5.8 4th and 8th Psychological Operations Group\n\nMottos: ‘Verbum Vincet’ and ‘Decisive Influence’\n\nHeadquarters: Fort Liberty, North Carolina, USA.\n\nActing as a support group, the 4th and 8th PSYOP Group provides operational assistance to deployed SFG groups in the form of intelligence. Overall, PSYOP uses clandestine and deceptive methods in psychological warfare capabilities. Furthermore, the 4th PSYOP Group is oriented towards media production and dissemination whilst the 8th PSYOP group handles more tactical scenarios. Moreover, both groups are the only two active groups in the US Army.

The role in which UW applies to the group is they can either assist in establishing governance within a target nation or group or bring total counter-governance capabilities. (Source) (Source)\n\n5.10 528th Sustainment Brigade\n\nMotto: ‘We Support To The Utmost’\n\nHeadquarters: Fort Liberty, North Carolina, USA.\n\nThe main logistical brigade for the 1st Special Forces Command and SFG provides logistical supplies to units on deployment. Additionally, 528th is one of the only sustainment brigades to be placed on constant situational global awareness. Subsequently, being an airborne unit like the rest of the Green Berets, they can deploy rapidly in support of SFGs in the field.

In addition, they are highly skilled with nonstandard weapons and vehicles that they may need to use when training and assisting partner militaries. (Source)\n\n6.1 Weapons\n\nArmaments used by Green Berets vary based on their function as a UW group, ranging from sniper rifles to assault rifles, explosive devices and unique weapons. Below is a non-exhaustive list of known weapons. (Source) (Source)\n\nAssault Rifles\n\nSCAR platform (MK-16 and MK-17)\n\nMK-13 CQBR\n\nM4A1\n\nSub Machine Guns\n\nMP5\n\nPistols\n\nM9 Beretta\n\nColt M45\n\nP228\n\nShotguns\n\nMossberg Model 590\n\nM1013\n\nMachine Guns\n\nMK-46\n\nMK-48\n\nM240\n\nM249 SAW\n\nSniper Rifles / Rifleman\n\nM24 SWS\n\nSR-25\n\nNavy Mark 12 Special Purpose Rifle\n\nMk 14 EBR\n\nTAC-338\n\nHK-G28\n\nM110 SASS\n\nBarrett M107\n\nRemington MSR\n\nLaunchers\n\nM32 MGL\n\nFGM-148 Javelin\n\nAT4\n\n6.2 Vehicles\n\nDue to their highly skilled training in unconventional warfare and designation as SOF, Green Berets typically use a high variety of vehicles. Due to their mission profile in UW and skill as an SOF, Green Berets are trained on a variety of platforms and adaptability when entering into combat via transport. (Source) (Source)\n\nGround vehicles\n\nGround Mobility Vehicles (GMV), such as the Humvee and the General Dynamics M1228 GMV 1.1 variant.\n\nMine Resistant Protect Ambush Protected Terrain Vehicles (M-ATV) and other variations along with the MRAP.\n\nNon-standard technical Vehicles (NSTV), commonly seen in conflict zones abroad such as across Afghanistan and Iraq\n\nRanger Special Operations Vehicles (SOVS)\n\nLight Medium Tactical Vehicles (LMTV)\n\nAll Terrain Vehicles (ATVS)\n\nArmoured Ground Mobility Systems (AGMS)\n\nAircraft\n\nMi-8 and Mi-17 variations of helicopters in the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan.\n\nMH-60 Blackhawk Helicopters\n\nCV-22 Ospreys\n\nMH-47 Chinooks\n\nWatercraft\n\nMark V Spec Ops Craft (MK V SOC), is a carrier capable of transporting equipment and SOF groups at sea.\n\nCombat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC), Zodiac-based platforms capable of carrying 10 or so men.\n\nSpecial Ops Craft–Riverine (SOC-R), a smaller craft capable of traversing along riverways.\n\nDiver Propulsion Devices (DPD), is an underwater system capable of transporting two divers at a distance of seven miles.\n\n6.3 Kit and Gear\n\nLike other SOF groups, Green Beret SFG optimise their kit and gear to be as lightweight as possible whilst providing ample protection. Additionally, Loadouts are tailored specifically to the designated role or MOS ranging from medical sergeant to weapons sergeant. Overall, typical loadouts and kit will range from a couple of magazines, plate carriers, assault packs and their designated weapon. (Source)\n\n7.0 The Future\n\nAlthough the Green Berets are a distinguishable and highly trained force, since the end of the war in Afghanistan and subsequent withdrawal, the future of the group is largely speculatory based on global conflicts the US is actively involved in. For instance, the 10th SFG were deployed in an advisory role to Ukraine in February 2022 to train in UW in the event of a full Russian annexation of the eastern part of the country. Finally, as for funding, the US Army is planning to cut over 10% of financing which would lead to a job loss of over 3000 personnel amongst their Special Operations Forces. (Source) (Source)\n\n8.0 Conclusion\n\nOverall, the Green Berets are perhaps one of the most unique units within the US Army Special Forces, if not the military as a whole. Altogether, they are highly skilled in unconventional warfare, their use of clandestine tactics and focus on language and foreign SOF development make them a force to not be reckoned with."
