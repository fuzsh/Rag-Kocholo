No. 114-33] DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FISCAL YEAR 2016 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS: LAYING THE GROUNDWORK TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY ---------- House of Representatives, Committee on Armed Services, Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, Washington, DC, Thursday, March 26, 2015. The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:35 a.m., in room 2212, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Joe Wilson (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE WILSON, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON EMERGING THREATS AND CAPABILITIES Mr. Wilson. I am pleased to welcome everyone here today for this hearing on the fiscal year 2016 budget request for science and technology [S&T] programs within the Department of Defense [DOD]. We are all aware of the intense downward budget pressure the Department is under these days in the ever-growing universe of threats that we are forced to deal with. Science and technology programs are part of the modernization investments that keep the Department prepared and ready to deal with those threats and ensure that when we send our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines into harm's way, we make sure they are never in a fair fight because technology is on their side. But defense sequestration jeopardizes that technological superiority and our ability to outmatch and outclass potential adversaries. I agree, we cannot ignore today's concerns, including readiness, equipment recapitalization, and the health and welfare of our service members. Nor can we expect to raid our modernization accounts to pay those bills. That is like taking money from the retirement accounts to pay the mortgage today. There are short-term rewards, but you create an even bigger problem down the line. I say that to make the point we understand why science and technology is important, should be protected, but also recognize that in this budget environment we will continue to be under pressure. The fiscal year 2016 budget request for science and technology is seeing a modest increase, but that request was also well above the budget caps set by defense sequestration. If we have to remain at sequestration levels, I fear the adverse impact it will have on our science and technology programs. Not only will we have to defer sought-after and important programs, but we will continue to defer the hiring of needed scientists and engineers, defer investments in necessary equipment, and defer building or upgrading facilities that support world-class research and world-class researchers. I know that I have painted a bleak picture, but it is only to punctuate how important we think science and technology is to our national security and the defense of our great Nation. Every time we push off research one year--one more year, we give our adversaries another year to catch up with us. With that, I would like to welcome our distinguished panel of witnesses for their thoughts on this topic. Mr. Alan Shaffer, Principal Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering; Ms. Mary Miller, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research and Technology; Rear Admiral Mat Winter, United States Navy, Chief of Naval Research; Dr. David Walker, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science, Technology and Engineering; Dr. Arati Prabhakar, the Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA. I would like to turn now to our ranking member, who will be here any moment, and he is on the way. And his staff is very trustworthy, and they promised me he is on the way. But Mr. Langevin should be here any time. But he has indicated to proceed, and we shall because of the voting schedule that we may be facing today. I would like to remind our witnesses that your written statements will be submitted for the record, so we ask that each of you summarize your comments to 5 minutes or less. Mr. Shaffer, we will begin with you, and we look forward to your opening statement. Before we do, though, I understand that you will be retiring from government service at the end of May to take a position as the chief science--chief scientist of the NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] Science and Technology Organization. What a great honor. You have been a good friend of this committee, and so I would like to thank you for your many years of service in the Air Force, your public service within the Department, and we wish you and your family best wishes in the future. Godspeed. [Applause.] STATEMENT OF ALAN R. SHAFFER, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING Mr. Shaffer. Thank you very much, sir. It has been a pleasure to serve and I will continue to serve in the NATO capacity. Chairman Wilson and committee members, I am proud to be here once again to represent the 100,000-plus scientists and engineers in the Department of Defense. Although this is a community that has been challenged in many ways over the last several years, they continue to perform remarkably well. I want to start with a somewhat unusual story and share with you the value of long-term science and technology. I was recently briefed about the progress made in combat casualty care. In Iraq and Afghanistan from 2005 to 2013 the average severity of injuries to our young forces increased by 25 percent, but the fatality rate was cut in half. We contend the decline in fatality rate is due, in part, to the long-term advances and delivery from the medical science and technology community, which includes contributions from everyone at this table. While our S&T community has performed very well in the recent past, the national security environment is changing in fundamental ways. For the first time in several decades, we are seeing an erosion of our technologically based military advantage. Secretary Ash Carter addressed this during his fiscal year 2016 budget posture, when he said: ``For decades, U.S. global power projection has relied on the ships, planes, submarines, bases, aircraft carriers, satellites, networks, and other advanced capabilities that comprise our military's unrivaled technological edge. But [today] that superiority is being challenged in unprecedented ways. ``Advanced military technologies, from rockets and drones to chemical and biological capabilities, have found their way into the arsenals of both non-state actors as well as previously less-capable militaries. And other nations--among them Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea--have been pursuing long-term, comprehensive military modernization programs to close the technology gap that has long existed between them and the United States.'' Dr. Carter also addressed the impact of the sequester, stating, ``A return to sequestration in fiscal year 2016 would affect all aspects of the Department, but not all equally. . . . ``Approximately half of the cuts would have to come from the Department's modernization accounts, undermining our efforts to secure technological superiority for U.S. forces in future conflicts. . . . Sequestration would put on a hold on critical programs, like our Aerospace Innovation Initiative, the Next-Generation Adaptive Engine, the Ground-Based Interceptor missile defense kill vehicle redesign, and several space control efforts.'' As you noted, the 2016 budget request for science and technology increases to $12.3 billion. We have focused on S&T investments in advanced technology development to provide more prototypes and demonstrations. Our recent emphasis in demonstrations is now producing results across the DOD. I will highlight just a few of our noteworthy demonstration programs. My Emerging Capabilities and Prototype Office has started several joint capability technology demonstrations for communications and imagery from small, tactically relevant satellites. The Space and Missile Defense Command Nanosatellite Program, known as SNaP, is a low Earth orbit nanosatellite that will provide assured, beyond-line-of-sight communication, enabling mission command on the move. Three SNaP satellites were delivered this March with a launch date scheduled for August 2015. The Kestral Eye is a 25- kilogram satellite that provides good-enough 1.5-meter visible imagery for less than $1.5 million. Both imagery tasking and delivery is controlled directly by battlefield commanders, and this provides a real augmentation to our tactical ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] capability. Kestral Eye will launch this December. The Army is developing a high-energy laser mobile demonstrator to demonstrate low-cost capability for counter rockets, artillery, and mortar. In 2014, the Army tested this system twice and successfully engaged roughly 90 percent of the targets. We are now on a path for protective lasers to be fielded in the Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capabilities Increment II. The Navy's Innovative Naval Prototype Laser Weapons System is another solid state laser under development. The Navy demonstration uses a fiber laser, as compared to the Army's heat capacity laser. The system was demonstrated aboard the USS Ponce in 2014 and is moving forward to its next set of field demonstrations. Finally, the Air Force's Adaptive Engine program is a new architecture, offering roughly 25 percent reduction in specific fuel consumption. Since 2007, we have moved from the Adaptive Versatile Engine Technology, ADVENT, program to the Adaptive Engine Technology Demonstration, and in 2016 we will commence with the Adaptive Engine Transition Program [AETP], which is out of S&T, but a 6.4 program moving towards engineering, manufacturing, and development program of record early next decade. A frequent criticism of the S&T program is that there is duplication among the services. I don't believe that this is a pervasive problem, but in 2013 we reinstated Reliance 21, a process to allow the services and defense agencies looking across all projects to optimize their output. Under Reliance 21, we have divided the overall S&T program into 17 communities of interest [COI], and they have--they are developing integrated science and technology roadmaps or plans. These COIs are adjusting programs at the execution level. This is, indeed, an interesting time for DOD science and technology, with operational challenges increasing at a time when budgets are flat or declining. Meeting the national security needs requires we develop and adopt a multifaceted strategy. This strategy is in place. I am proud of the professionals and the entire R&E [research and engineering] enterprise, and look forward to continued achievements from our dedicated workforce. I also very much value working together with each of these science and technology executives to deliver the most that we can from the overall Department of Defense. Thank you, sir. [The prepared statement of Mr. Shaffer can be found in the Appendix on page 29.] Mr. Wilson. Thank you very much, Mr. Shaffer. Ms. Miller. STATEMENT OF MARY J. MILLER, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ARMY FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY Ms. Miller. Chairman Wilson, Ranking Member Langevin, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to discuss the Army's science and technology program for fiscal year 2016. I came before this committee last year and spoke to the difficult choices that the Army faced balancing force structure, operational readiness, and modernization. This continues to be a significant challenge. The velocity of instability around the world has increased. The Army is now operating on multiple continents simultaneously in ways unforeseen just a year ago. Our adversaries continue to invest in technology to counter or evade our strengths, and what used to take our enemies months and years to disrupt may now take only days. The Army has developed a new Army operational concept, ``Win in a Complex World,'' to address this new environment. Within the Army, however, the research, development, and acquisition accounts are 34 percent less in fiscal year 2016 than we projected just 4 short years ago, adding to this challenge. Despite this dramatic reduction in our modernization accounts, the Army leadership has continued to protect the science and technology investment as the key to the Army of the future. The S&T enterprise is committed to providing soldiers with the technology to win. The contributions from the almost 12,000 scientists and engineers that work within the S&T enterprise span the gamut from fixing immediate problems to forecasting for the future. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few of these areas. The Army relies on our science and technology enterprise to rapidly solve current problems for our troops in the field-- problems such as redesigning body armor to better fit female soldiers in Afghanistan. These soldiers were faced with armor that caused abrasions, restricted their movement, and even impacted their ability to correctly seat their rifles on their shoulder when shooting. The S&T community developed an armor system designed to fit smaller torsos, which is now becoming the new standard for female soldiers today. We are also called upon to improve our current system capability. Efforts like the Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine, now the Improved Turbine Engine program of record, will provide Apache and Black Hawk critically needed operational improvement in both hot and high altitude conditions. We also drive down risk for emerging programs of record by bringing forward new capabilities that are not only technologically achievable, but also affordable. Our efforts with the Third Gen FLIR, forward-looking infrared, are a great example of where we developed a technical solution that gave us increased range for both detection and ID [identification]-- range that exceeds that of our enemy--while investing in the manufacturability of this system to provide an unprecedented, affordable, all-weather capability that recently transitioned into the I-FLIR program of record. Before a program even gets started, however, S&T provides the technical understanding of the art of the possible, ensuring our requirements are both achievable and affordable. Our Joint Multi-Role [JMR] Technology Demonstrator effort will produce two flight demonstrators in fiscal year 2017 to inform affordable requirements for the Department of Defense's next-generation rotorcraft. The Future Vertical Lift planned program of record is envisioned to meet 70 percent of the current DOD rotorcraft needs, and the JMR Tech Demo is ensuring that we get these requirements right. With an increasingly adaptive enemy, one who has watched how the U.S. fights for the past 13 years, it is imperative for us to understand our own technology and system vulnerabilities--those aspects that could be exploited and used against us. Our Army science and technology enterprise has embraced this challenge, as well. A key aspect of this initiative is red-teaming, challenging our systems with an emulated enemy--one who can use innovative and adaptive methods to disrupt our planned capability. These efforts have the potential for significant cost savings, as vulnerabilities are mitigated before system designs are finalized and systems are fielded. We also work to understand the global technology environment by establishing tighter connections to each other through Reliance 21, that you just heard about, through increasing our engagement with the Intelligence Community and accessing nontraditional thinkers through our technology war- gaming, focused on what could be possible in the 2030 to 2040 timeframe. Finally, we continue to seek and develop new and game- changing technologies for the future. For instance, our ``materials by design'' basic research effort will provide the capability to select and create material properties and responses, essentially building new materials from the atom up. Of course, none of this would be possible without the scientists and engineers that make up the Army S&T enterprise. I am honored to represent the men and women who apply their expertise on a daily basis to creatively solve difficult national security challenges and provide the flexibility and agility to respond to the many challenges that the Army will face. Our focus remains on our soldiers. We consistently seek new avenues to increase the soldiers' capability and ensure their technological superiority today, tomorrow, and decades from now. Thank you again for all that you do to support our soldiers. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Miller can be found in the Appendix on page 52.] Mr. Wilson. Thank you very much, Ms. Miller. We now proceed to Admiral Winter. STATEMENT OF RADM MATHIAS W. WINTER, USN, CHIEF OF NAVAL RESEARCH Admiral Winter. Good morning, Chairman Wilson and Ranking Member Langevin, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. As previously mentioned, I am Rear Admiral Mat Winter, the new Chief of Naval Research [CNR], and it is an honor to address you all and discuss our Department of the Navy's science and technology investment strategy, which, I will add, is fully supported by the President's fiscal year 2016 budget request. Though I have only been the CNR for less than 90 days, I have had years of experience in the science and technology arena as a producer and as a consumer; as a scientist, a computer scientist, and a mechanical engineer by trade; as a combat A-6 Intruder bombardier/navigator and as a major weapons program manager; also a Naval Warfare Center commander at China Lake and Point Mugu; and most recently as our PEO [program executive officer] for unmanned aviation and strike weapons. With that experience, I come to the table in this job with a unique perspective that understands explicitly how our S&T investments enable our workforce to discover, develop, and deliver the breakthrough technologies to support our sailors and marines, which is absolutely essential. They operate in what I refer to as our three fleets: the current fleet underway, the fleet under development, and our future fleet. It is absolutely imperative that we have a strategy that links these three fleets together fiscally, operationally, and technically. We recently released our Department of the Navy updated S&T strategy that does just that. It focuses our efforts into nine relevant, game-changing research areas to provide that clarity to the research enterprise and the broader S&T community that includes our academia and our small business industry partners. Additionally, the strategy defines our workforce engagement and development initiatives to build a strong, knowledgeable workforce based on the fundamentals of STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics], ensuring that we have the relevant intellectual capital to solve our hardest problems. This strategy guides our planning, execution, and decision-making to ensure we have the right people with the right skills in the right jobs, and the organizational alignment to ensure efficient execution, communications, and decisive leadership. To that point, I am a goal-oriented leader. I hate inefficiencies. I am executing our S&T mission with the required rigor and accountability so our warfighter maintains that decisive technological advantage to fight the fight and keep the peace. But as equally important, it is--we need our scientists and engineers to maintain the decisive technological advantage in our laboratories. In the 85 days I have been on this job I am coming to realize what an honor and privilege it is to lead this incredible team of over 4,000 technical professionals in the naval S&T community across our Naval Research Enterprise and those embedded with our academia and industry partners. By all measures--and since I am an engineer, I like to measure things--the work they are engaged in is some of the most influential and game-changing technology research in the Department and albeit around the globe. For example, the demonstrated and revolutionary electromagnetic railgun; our breakthrough, game-changing, forward-deployed laser cannons, that has been mentioned previously; the medical research focused on traumatic brain injury solutions; advanced materials research; synthetic biology; advanced algorithmic autonomous behavior; electromagnetic warfare--it goes on and on. My scientists are making contributions that are making marked differences not only to our warfighters, which is important, but to our Navy and Marine Corps and this great country. How do I come to that conclusion? As an engineer--and I like to measure things--but I like metrics. We have got to be able to measure things and show progress. Our S&T domain, though, really is a squishy area of basic and applied research. With flubber and flux capacitors, hard to put metric to those types of investments. So how do we do that? Some would say it is transition of S&T products to get to our warfighters. That is true, but I don't think that is the complete answer. I think we need to look at all of the spectrum of S&T transition. I can point to our Department of the Navy S&T metrics that show 87 percent of our S&T products transition into acquisition, and the majority of those transition to the warfighters' hands. That is not trivial, and that is a good success rate. But there is 13 percent, and those will be looked at as failures. I say it is different. I say that gives us latent benefit. That 13 percent provides new knowledge that has never been known before. It allows us to populate the intellectual capital to solve hard problems, manifests into over 60 Nobel Peace-- Nobel Prize winners. We also have 300-plus patents a year in the Department of the Navy that make sure we husband our intellectual capital and continually get return on investment. And we also transition technologies to the shelf. They are on the shelf so that when an emerging requirement manifests itself, we have a ready-to-go solution to transition. So that is a transition--latent transition activity, as well. The problem I see as we bring that together is the ``Valley of Death'' is more of a moat, and it is a bridge, and it is something that we need to continue to work through together. To that end, it is apparent that we don't--we leave nothing to waste. When you visit our Navy and Marine Corps, everything you see originated at some level with S&T--everything from Old Ironsides to the first radars, from nuclear propulsion to our biofuel alternatives, from the Sidewinder missile to the RGPS [Relative Global Positioning System] capabilities and railgun and lasers. All have the origins within the Naval Research S&T domain, and we are proud of that. These are relevant technological successes. Some are old, some are new, but they are a true cumulative impact from discovery and invention, to application and experimentation, to demonstration and fielding. They work. And our naval scientists, along with our small business industry partners and our academia university colleagues here and around the globe, make it happen. I invite you and your staffs to come join us and observe firsthand, in our Navy Warfare Centers and our labs, the technologies and the accomplishments that our scientists are executing. We will continue to pursue our S&T efforts with innovative research and disruptive thinking, always trying to make existing systems more effective and affordable. That is very important. And in doing so, we remain aligned to our senior leadership. The CNO [Chief of Naval Operations] and Commandant's recently released ``Cooperative Strategy for the 21st Century Seapower'' is underpinned by this S&T strategy. We can't afford to do business as usual--just can't do that. And we can't wish away the technological advantages of emergent global actors that are challenging our warfighting supremacy. The CNO's strategy provides us the framework to think and act differently, and we are. We must be committed as a country to pursuing the technological solutions for tomorrow today. It is essential to tie that technical to the tactical to the strategic, and we in the Navy and the Marine Corps are committed to ensuring our S&T resources that you and your congressional colleagues provide us gets the most bang for the buck by giving our sailors and marines that technological advantage on the battlefield. Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your time and your continued support of our S&T efforts, and I look forward to taking your questions. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Admiral Winter can be found in the Appendix on page 70.] Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Admiral Winter. We now proceed to Dr. Walker. STATEMENT OF DR. DAVID E. WALKER, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE FOR SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND ENGINEERING Dr. Walker. Thank you, Chairman Wilson, Ranking Member Langevin, and members of the subcommittee. I am pleased to have the opportunity to provide testimony on the Air Force's fiscal year 2016 science and technology program. This has been an exceptional year for science and technology in the United States Air Force. Last summer our Secretary and Chief published a new ``America's Air Force: A Call to the Future''--a 30-year strategy for the Air Force, which really highlights science and technology and how it is required to achieve the strategic goals that they set forward. Our fiscal year 2016 President's budget request is an increase of 14 percent over our previous request, at a $2.4 billion level. The Air Force leadership recognizes the excellent work that S&T has done in the past and recognizes the need for S&T to achieve the future they want. And characterizing our S&T program, Major General Masiello, the commander of the Air Force Research Lab, has put it in three Rs: responsive, relevant, and revolutionary. The responsive piece is, how do you be responsive to the warfighter's need in the field today? An excellent example of this is a--Air Force S&T provided a capability to the special operations troops operating in Afghanistan by integrating the sensor payload onto a tactically remote piloted vehicle that provided a unique and unprecedented capability for identifying IEDs [improvised explosive devices], weapons caches, and enemy, and has resulted in significant support within the theater. On the revolutionary front, the adaptive engine technology that Mr. Shaffer addressed earlier is one of the great revolutions coming out that will really change warfighting by providing significant fuel efficiency in addition to greater thrust out of the existing family of fighter engines. This has grown out of an ADVENT program, our first program which was pure S&T. That program completed last summer and has proven a greater than 20 percent savings in fuel just from an S&T large engine buildup that we ran with General Electric. The follow-on to this is the Advanced Engine Technology Development program, which is ongoing this year and next year, which will continue to move forward this technology. And then as part of the Aerospace Innovation Initiative, under the Defense Innovation Initiative, we have the follow-on program, which is the Advanced Engine Transition program. These really promise to bring this technology not only through the S&T, but on forward into actual prototyping to prove that this technology in a full-up flight-sized engine really works. The one problem, of course, is under the BCA [Budget Control Act] that--the AETP program, the follow-on program, is still above the BCA levels. Another revolutionary area we are working is in nanotechnology. One of the game-changers that we are working right now is in flexible, wearable sensors--the ability to put a bandaid-like patch onto an individual and be able to detect fatigue, cognition, their performance indicators, by pulling biomarkers through the skin. This is enabled by the nanoprinting of nanoparticle inks onto these markers and actually building up smart electronics into a bandaid-like, flexible, electronic patch. Has great future not only for the Air Force and how we use it, but all the services, and for the medical industry as a whole, so there is tremendous capability that we are working. We are also addressing relevant warfighter needs. This is a problem that, as you work in the midterm requirements--near and midterm requirements--how do we make sure that what we are doing in Air Force technology is really supporting what the warfighter needs? A good example of this, and working with the Air Combat Command [ACC] and their desire to go after hard and deeply buried targets with existing capability on existing airplane platforms, we need to have smaller, more compact systems. So the High Velocity Penetrating Weapon was a program that we put together to do this. Been very successful, and now it has transitioned that technology into the follow-on program that ACC is now looking at in their AOA [analysis of alternatives]. We also last July launched the ANGELS, or the Automated Navigation and Guidance Experience for Local Space, which is really focused on how do we do geosynchronous space situational awareness, which requires somewhat of an autonomous capability. So the ability to detect, track, and characterize space objects on geosynchronous is really moving us forward in our capability for the space situational awareness of the future. To do this we really have to have a talented workforce. We have taken advantage of the new authorities that have been given to us by the HASC [House Armed Services Committee] and the SASC [Senate Armed Services Committee]. In addition, we built a strategic plan both for building our engineering workforce, but also for helping build the STEM workforce across the Air Force as a whole, really trying to build the STEM ambassadorship of the Air Force across the Nation to develop the talent that we need. In closing, the Air Force 2016 President's budget really requests the science and technology to make sure that we can remain responsive, revolutionary, and relevant in the future. On behalf of the scientists and the engineers of the Air Force S&T enterprise, I want to thank you for your continued support of our S&T program and look forward to any questions you have. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Walker can be found in the Appendix on page 97.] Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Dr. Walker. We now proceed to Dr. Prabhakar. STATEMENT OF DR. ARATI PRABHAKAR, DIRECTOR, DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY Dr. Prabhakar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Langevin, members of the subcommittee. It is great to be here with my colleagues and I appreciate the chance to talk with you today. DARPA is part of this Defense Department science and technology community; we are also part of the larger national and global technology ecosystem. But within those communities DARPA has one particular role, and that is to make the pivotal early investments in new technologies that show what is possible so that we can take huge strides forward in our national security capabilities. And I will just share with you this morning a couple of brief examples that I hope will bring that mission to life. One is some of our work that is being put to work in one of today's challenges--namely, the fight against ISIL [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]. This program that these tools derive from is called Memex. Memex set out to build some software tools that allow for a very different kind of search through public Web sites--deep, domain-specific search. So what that means is that a user using these tools, it lets them do two new things. One is to see Web sites out beyond those that are indexed by commercial search engines like Google or Bing--public Web sites, but those that aren't really reached by these commercial search engines. And then secondly, this tool automatically maps patterns and linkages, relationships across vast numbers of Web sites--very enabling, powerful technology for analysts. These technologies, these tools, have already been used by the law enforcement community in some work in the arena of human trafficking. That has led to indictments and at least one conviction. Today the same tools are in operational use to understand linkages among ISIL Web sites, as well. A second very different example is about driving U.S. technological superiority to--so that we can deter or defeat a sophisticated peer adversary. And, you know, I think we all know that ever since radar helped win the Battle of Britain, we have all understood that controlling the electromagnetic spectrum is foundational to warfighting. And in fact, today U.S. military RF [radio frequency] arrays are the envy of the world. That is not by accident; it is because of the joint investments in S&T across all of our activities here represented at the table. And I think that is a tremendous advantage that we have, but it is also the case that the rest of the world doesn't stand still, and so today we see other capabilities developing around the world that put our advantage, you know, at risk. So today what that--you know, what that translates to is that in a highly contested environment against a sophisticated adversary, they will now have the ability to jam our systems, essentially rendering our forces blind in the heat of battle. So one of the efforts that is underway at DARPA today, in close partnership with our service colleagues, is really to create the next generation of capability for controlling the electromagnetic spectrum. This is new work at the level of devices, new systems architectures, new algorithms, new manufacturing technologies, all of which together I think can give us a chance to move into a future--not just a future where we can operate in the electromagnetic spectrum, but a future where we can control the electromagnetic spectrum in real time in the battlespace, and I think giving us that--the kind of substantial advantage that all of our investments are really about. Those are just a couple of examples across a much wider portfolio at DARPA. You have our new report that just came out that offers a broader perspective across the portfolio. I am happy to talk about any of that. But I also want to take a couple minutes and talk with you about what it takes for us to deliver on our mission. Your support in so many ways across many years has been essential to that. First and foremost is our people. We have had a flexible hiring authority that this committee helped create a number of years ago. Last year in legislation you allowed us to use more of our positions within our fixed head count using this flexible technique. And this is a--this hiring authority is just essential for everything that we do at DARPA. It lets us get access to the kind of people who have the potential to be really great DARPA program managers, and that really is our lifeblood. So I am very appreciative for your support of that capability. Secondly, turning to the budget, again, your support in recent years has been critical to stabilizing our budget post sequestration, and the President's budget request this year at $3 billion essentially continues that stabilization. It is essentially, in real terms, the same level as what was appropriated last year. Again, I will ask for your support of the President's budget-level request. And I don't have to tell you about sequestration, Mr. Chairman. You mentioned it in your opening remarks, but you know well that if we can't avert sequestration it will take a significant toll on the work that we are doing. Let me just finish by saying that my comments today have focused on the challenges that face our Nation today and into the future. All of us here at this table take those threats very seriously. At the same time, for us we are very fortunate that our daily work is about solutions, and all of us come to work every day to find creative ways to rise above these dangers. And because of that, it is our responsibility but also our privilege to do this work of harnessing advanced, powerful technologies for our Nation's security. So thanks again for the chance to be here with you. I am happy to answer questions along with my colleagues. [The prepared statement of Dr. Prabhakar can be found in the Appendix on page 103.] Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Dr. Prabhakar. And indeed, we have been joined by the ranking member. He got here within 14 seconds of the beginning of the hearing. Mr. James Langevin. STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM RHODE ISLAND, RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEEE ON EMERGING THREATS AND CAPABILITIES Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I apologize for being a little bit late. I was actually off site with Bloomberg News doing an interview and talking about one of our favorite topics-- cybersecurity. And it ran just a little bit behind. But I do want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today. And, of course, I want to thank our witnesses for being here to discuss the Department of Defense's science and technology budget request for fiscal year 2016, and I appreciated hearing your testimony here this morning already. Maintaining the United States technological edge is a priority for the House Armed Services Committee and, most especially, for this subcommittee. And I thank my partner and the leader in this effort, Chairman Wilson. As budgets grow smaller we recognize the necessity of continuing a robust investment in S&T. The seeds of innovation that we plant with our investments today grow into the game- changing capabilities of tomorrow. Conversely, if we fail to properly invest, we will be dealing with the consequences for decades. Emerging technologies born of past and current investments, like directed energy and other high-energy weapons, have the potential to deliver paradigm-shifting capabilities to our warfighters that in many ways upend traditional warfighting concepts and tradeoffs. And, Secretary Shaffer and others, I appreciate you mentioning those capabilities today, particularly on directed energy. So these capabilities not only give us a warfighting advantage, but can serve as a deterrent to our adversaries. Today we are engaged around the globe with enemies like Al Qaeda and ISIL, its associate affiliates, and other terrorist groups. Our S&T investments over the last decade have been instrumental in delivering the capabilities our forces need to defeat such enemies and protect them from rudimentary yet effective weapons like improvised explosive devices. Other potential adversaries require different capabilities, some more suited to traditional warfare concepts and others more--for more unconventional warfare, like cyber. Ensuring our investments align with requirements is key, and I look forward to continuing to discuss and hear from the witnesses about the Department's approach to emerging challenges and new domains. In addition to investing in technology, we must invest in, of course, our workforce and our future workforce. Recruiting and retaining top talent in the Department's S&T community is truly a bedrock of maintaining technological superiority. Now, over the years the Congress has provided the Department of Defense with many tools to do just that through IPA [Intergovernmental Personnel Act] programs, internships, and other unique personnel opportunities. I know you each in your various ways are engaged in growing that workforce, and I appreciate those efforts. Also crucially important to our technological superiority is ensuring that the Department has knowledge of the innovative work being done by entities other than large corporations typically associated with defense, and that it is able to transition that work to become new capabilities. Opportunities provided under the auspices of programs such as the Rapid Innovation Fund [RIF] of course have proven to be a win-win for the Department, small businesses, labs, and our warfighters. As the witnesses are no doubt aware, the Rapid Innovation Fund program authorization will expire at the end of this fiscal year, and I am certainly committed to reauthorizing this program and would appreciate if the witnesses could provide their thoughts on the success of this program and examples for the record. With that, let me just again thank you all for the work that you are doing. I think that this subcommittee is one of the more interesting in Congress, and I know you all appreciate the work that you do and that of your workforce, and I hope you will convey our appreciation to the people that you oversee. With that, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for, again, holding this hearing, and I yield back. Mr. Wilson. Thank you very much, Mr. Langevin. And we will now begin the 5-minute process, and Kevin Gates is going to be strict, including on me in particular because we have votes any second, and so we are always at the will of how the votes occur. I think it is very appropriate, Mr. Shaffer, that you actually began with military medicine. The American people need to know the survival rates that have been achieved, which are unprecedented in conflict. It was so inspiring to me visiting the theater field hospitals, visiting Landstuhl, visiting Bethesda, Walter Reed, and to see the survival and then the prosthetics that were developed so that young people who were injured had--and--have fulfilling lives, and to see people with injuries that are just utterly catastrophic by barbarians who, as cited by Jim, the improvised explosive devices--these were designed as unprecedented, I believe, ever for the maximum personal injury of not just military but civilians. Just a heinous enemy that we are facing. But the success, and so by beginning with that was fantastic. We actually, with your help, we have made progress relative to the issue of defense sequestration. Initially most people couldn't even pronounce the word ``sequestration,'' and then-- but the good news is that, particularly now, the American people I think understand the threat of defense sequestration, where half of the sequestration is in one department-- Department of Defense--and the effect that this has with the other budget cuts that have been implemented. But, in fact, as an indication of success--and 2 months ago I wouldn't have thought this, but last night we had a vote on a budget that would actually substantially roll back sequestration. But the way that we have been successful is not just generically discussing the threat, but specifically. So if each one of you could identify a specific example of where sequestration will lead to a problem, and beginning with Mr. Shaffer. Mr. Shaffer. Thank you very much, sir. And thank you for the vote last night. I think that there are two real issues with sequestration. First, with all the must-pay bills, as Dr. Carter noted, over half the cuts of sequestration would come from modernization accounts. Embedded in that are some of the things that you heard about today that would go away. So the Aerospace Innovation Initiative, which actually has two stools underneath it--this is a DARPA-led, for right now, DARPA-Air Force-Navy program that is designed to build the next generation prototype flying platform, and that is about all we can say about that. But also, the next-generation turbine engine that will give us 25 to 30 percent savings. Both of those projects will end. The real ripple effect is with the reduction in procurement accounts and the reduction in our 6.4 and 6.5 accounts. Engineers are being laid off. Once you lose the design engineers in the aerospace industry and the turbine engine industry they don't come back. So think about a Department of Defense with no significant, long-term research project for the next generation of air capability. That is what sequestration means, sir. Mr. Wilson. The morale effect, I can't even imagine. Ms. Miller. Ms. Miller. I will echo what Mr. Shaffer said. Clearly sequestration will impact yet again our modernization accounts. We are in a situation where we have to have force structure and operational readiness. We have to support our soldiers that are out there on the line, and we will. But what we sacrifice is those improvements to our existing capability, the restoral of the capabilities that are coming back out of theater now that we are committed to restoring so we can utilize. But I will take you in another direction. We had a dramatic impact on our workforce with the last sequestration, and even the indication that we might do this again, we are already starting to see indications that our workforce, which has been under a considerable amount of strain and still doing what needs to be done to protect our soldiers, they are now looking at whether or not it is really worth staying. And so I expect that we will lose, again, some of our best and brightest engineers because they will either look for more security somewhere else or, frankly, we have got a large contingent that are close or eligible to retirement that will choose to do so without passing on that extreme knowledge that we need to pass down to our younger generation. We are currently still under a hiring limitation. It is a one-for-six for the Army; we can only hire one when we lose six. That is a dramatic impact on our ability to make sure we keep the best and brightest available for meeting the needs of the Army. Thank you, sir. Admiral Winter. Mr. Chairman, I will echo--the workforce is definitely a critical area, but I won't just repeat that. I will go towards a naval optic. As we focus to our Pacific operating area, if our modernization accounts are reduced, those programs of record that are delivering naval capabilities for our marines and our sailors are underpinned by our S&T investments of our technology maturation future naval capability efforts. Those naval capability efforts are ensuring that we maintain and expand our undersea domain supremacy, which is absolutely critical for that area of operations. Likewise, being able to ensure that we can have power ashore with our marines, enabled by those systems, will all be at risk as those modernization accounts are reduced and the effectivity of our S&T investments to be able to bring long- range torpedo, underwater unmanned vehicle constellations, communication--over-the-horizon communication and targeting for at-range threats, being able to bring the ship connector capabilities with our marines and our Navy vessels. They are all at risk, sir, and our S&T investments will not be able to enable that technological advantage. So coupled with the workforce degradation and our ability to do the true, I will say underwater and electromagnetic warfare efforts--that would be the biggest impact to the Department of the Navy. Thank you, sir. Mr. Wilson. Doctor. Dr. Walker. I want to echo on the workforce impact is the biggest impact I see that will have a lasting effect if we go through a sequestration again. We are still feeling the impact of that today in our workforce from the previous sequestration we went through. As we go forward, the modernization accounts will pay the brunt of this in the Air Force for the same reasons that my colleagues have already spoken of. On the S&T side, we are right now transitioning this engine technology out of S&T into a 6.4 program. That will be lost, losing that ability to bridge out of S&T, which we are trying to build. Furthermore, some of our programs which are in the 6.3 level in S&T and high-powered microwaves and advanced lasers upon aircraft will also suffer significantly if we go back into sequestration again. Mr. Wilson. Thank you for the specifics. And, Dr. Prabhakar. Dr. Prabhakar. I will mention three specifics. One thing we found a few years ago in sequestration is that at the end of our programs, when we were prepared to do flight demos or trials at sea, one of the big problems we had was that because of sequestration those trials got delayed. And then the follow- on effect, because of the way we work with the services at test ranges, et cetera, often that led to not only delays but, in fact, overall increased costs, which was quite deleterious. Our workforce issue is very similar. For us, our people come only for 3 to 5 years, so it is somewhat of a retention issue, but really the bigger problem is trying to recruit people into this sort of tumultuous environment is not very helpful. And I think to me the most fundamental danger in these process--none of these specific cuts are the end of the world. The problem is that they just continue this erosion, this corrosion of our ability to do our mission. And a lot of our focus is to reach out to a very broad technical community, engage them in this important business of national security. When things like sequestration happen it is such a negative message to people who don't already live in this world and whom we really need to attract to this mission. Mr. Wilson. Thank each of you. And we now proceed to Mr. Langevin. Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, thanks to all our witnesses for your testimony. So for the panel, the Rapid Innovation program, which I spoke about in my opening statement, as you know, was authorized in section 1073 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2011. The merit-based, competitive program accelerates the fielding of technologies into military systems in support of requirements, and there are so many examples of successful projects, such as the Navy's port security barrier intrusion detection system, which helped mitigate gaps in the system from being exploited. As I stated in my opening remarks, I am championing reauthorization for the Rapid Innovation Program since it expires at the end of this fiscal year. Let me ask, in your opinion, has the program been valuable to the Department, and how so? Mr. Shaffer. Yes, sir. Thank you. RIF has, indeed, been valuable. We held maybe a month ago, maybe 6 weeks--time kind of blurs together--we held our annual review of the RIF program. And now we are far enough into it that we are starting to see the results. So we are getting about, on the whole, 60 to 70 percent transition rate. I think we are also getting to reach out and touch companies that might not otherwise want to work with the Department of Defense. And the program has been kind of transformed over the last 3 years, where it is jointly run by acquisition and S&T people. In fact, the funding is not in the S&T lines; it is in the--our 6.4 accounts, our advanced capability development and prototyping accounts. And we put it there specifically to bridge that gap of getting good, new technologies into our acquisition programs of record, but using the intelligence and the smarts of our S&T community to manage and conduct the source selection. So I am seeing very positive things from it. Mr. Kendall, my boss, has asked me for a recommendation, and depending upon what--where we end up with for funding targets for the year, we are going to try to fund it ourselves. Don't know if that will happen, but we are going to try. Mr. Langevin. Thank you. That is very helpful. Ms. Miller. Within the Army I would say that we are finding RIF is an added flexibility that we might not otherwise have. As Mr. Shaffer mentioned, it allows us to reach those industries that we might never have otherwise engaged or been able to engage because, you know, we are kind of the big Army and looking for big things. But some of the efforts that we have put out there, we kind of laid out to industry what our problems were and we got some interesting approaches on how to solve them. And I will give you two examples of success. We had a small company that looked at a problem that we had with our FMTV [Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles] systems. We were up-armoring the cabs of our FMTV--and that is a good thing, protecting the soldiers. However, over time the doors on the FMTV started to sag, and we were causing damage to the added weight on the cab frame. So we put out a problem and got a response through the RIF process that gave us a cab-stiffening assembly that passed all of our tests so far. We have now transitioned it to the PM [program manager] for FMTV; he is going under--undergoing testing to see whether that will now become part of his program of record to retrofit onto those existing FMTVs that have up- armored cabs. And that was on the order of about a $2.5 million investment from us in the RIF, and well worth it. Another quick example is a handheld, pocket-sized quantitative electroencephalogram. It is essentially this weird-looking thing that slips over your head and you can use it in the far-forward theater. What it is helping us to do is provide an objective assessment on neurological injury. So this is kind of the far- forward idea, are we--did we get some sort of mild traumatic brain injury? Is there something that would warrant our soldier now getting a more rigorous look by a medic? Something that we need to know to make sure that we have provided appropriate health care for the soldier in the far-forward environment. Just two examples, sir. Mr. Langevin. Great examples. Thank you. Admiral. Admiral Winter. Sir, I will echo--RIF is very value-added. And as a previous program manager, the flexibility of not just having resource, but having a resource that allows you to go tackle those design issues that you would otherwise wait at a future spiral, allows you to pull in capabilities sooner to your warfighter. Examples like our Navy high-energy chiller that allowed us to identify a smaller size and weight and footprint to be able to cool our high-energy avionics electronics on ships. That small investment of a hundred--couple hundred thousand dollars will show huge dividends downrange for the recurring costs for all of our ships. And the ability of the program manager to reach out to small business--and 90 percent of our engagement in RIF for the Department of the Navy is with small business. And that is a tenet from Mr. Stackley on down, to engage at that small business base. Things such as our verification and validation capabilities. Right now we have to put things on jets, go out and check and see if they fit in the aerodynamic environment. We populate those aircraft with very expensive verification and validation instrumentation suites. We gave that challenge to a very small--to a small business. They came back with a USB [universal serial bus]- sized stick--solid state, vibratory, wireless verification and validation capability, that for about $300,000 we are saving $5 million a year. So that kind of innovative thinking that is facilitated by a very small investment from a RIF perspective, giving not only program managers but small industry the flexibility and the opportunity, and I think we need to continue this program. Thank you. Mr. Langevin. Very valuable. Thank you. Dr. Walker. The RIF has been very useful to the Air Force, as well, particularly in bringing in new and innovative businesses to solve problems that we didn't have a solution for. So far, we have had over 2,600 white papers that have been submitted to our call. We have put out about 94 projects out of these papers of selecting the best and most promising ones. And what it has allowed us to do was to really reach out to nontraditional small business as well as our traditional SIBRs [Small Business Innovative Research] and STTRs [Small Business Technology Transfer] participants and help transition technologies into programs of record to solve problems that are annoying problems but we are not--have not risen to the level that they were actually going after them with their large acquisition program. The F-35 has been the recipient of several great ideas that have allowed them to reduce costs or fix problems on the production line that, as I say, are annoyances, but once you do it you realize that this is a much better way to solve the problem. And the leveraging for a small investment, investing millions to get savings in the hundreds of millions, has been really valuable. So we really do like the program. As has been said, we have moved this to be an acquisition program with lab support, and look forward to continuing with it. Mr. Langevin. Thank you. Nothing with you, Dr. Prabhakar? Okay. Dr. Prabhakar. DARPA is not involved in this--it is a services program. Mr. Langevin. Very good. Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Wilson. Thanks, Mr. Langevin. Now proceed to Congressman Rich Nugent, of Florida. Mr. Nugent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thought maybe it would be Mr. Franks first, but that is okay. It is in order? Okay. This is a question--this committee and the larger committee last year in the 113th Congress appropriated $220 million for the sole purpose of accelerating the development of a domestic rocket propulsion system. However, thus far, neither the Air Force nor the Department of Defense has moved expeditiously to accomplish the task. And since passage of last year appropriations act, I specifically want to know what has the Air Force done with the advanced liquid rocket booster engine to replace the RD-180? Dr. Walker. I will have to take that for the record, sir, as far as the acquisition program does not fall under my purview. [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix on page 120.] Dr. Walker. However, under the S&T program, which we are continuing, we have been working the component technologies that are required to enable that type of capability in the future. Have had a strong program over the past decade that will allow us then to move into an oxygen-rich liquid rocket in the future. So the investments we made in the past and investments we are continuing in this year's budget are really focused on giving us the capability to go to the next generation of liquid rocket engines. Mr. Nugent. Well, I appreciate that and certainly look forward to your response outside of the committee. Obviously, you know, it was very important to this committee that we get away from the Russian engine, where we shouldn't be relying upon that technology in particular. But the next question, then, is on directed energy. And I know the chairman and ranking member are very invested in directed energy. Last year Congress directed the Air Force to deliver a CHAMP [Counter-electronics High-powered Microwave Advanced Missile Project] system on surplus cruise missiles, and Congress set aside $10 million just for the purpose of getting the technology out of the lab and to our warfighters. We have had numerous combatant commanders testify to the fact that CHAMP would be a, you know, an excellent addition to their inventory, and particularly since what we are recommending is obviously--and I understand where the Air Force is at--they would like to see a long-term solution to that problem in regards to a delivery vehicle and maybe some additional upgrades. But, you know, we just met with the lab and folks that, A, have--obviously we have tested this particular item. We have surplus cruise missiles that were deactivated from the nuclear force that at least would get that technology out to our combatant commanders in a very short period of time. We have proven that it works. They have upgraded it, actually, from the lab. As a bridge to when we get this reusable delivery vehicle, or maybe something that we really want to have 10 years out, but gives a bridge right now for, you know, a fraction of the cost to at least get it out to the combatant commanders. To us, you know, S&T is so important, but we also have to be able to provide it out into the field, and whether it is, you know, 80 percent, 90 percent, or 100 percent, this issue is, you know, if it is at least fieldable to assist those combatant commanders, then we ought to be doing it. And so we are really concerned--I am, in particular--in regards to that we are not--excuse me--that we are not actually following through when we have the ability to. Do you have an answer for me? Dr. Walker. At this point in time the Air Force is still looking at the technology and where the right point is to transition it. That said, from a science and technology perspective, we are looking at how do we continue to improve the capability? So we are leveraging the $10 million that you provided to, one, take the things that we saw in the demonstration with the CALCM [conventional air-launched cruise missile] size system, and to improve on those so that if we did decide to go with the program with the current system we would be able to make a better system. In addition---- Mr. Nugent. I don't disagree with that. I mean, I think that we have the ability to do multiple things at a time, and one is if you can field it and get it out to the combatant commands, particularly with the nation-state threats that we face today with Russia and China, I would think it would be to our benefit to take advantage of at least the technology we have today. We can absolutely continue to do the research and development to improve it, but I also know within that short period of time we have also already made an improvement to the original CHAMP that was tested. So there are some great avenues. I would really like to see the Air Force work on that technology, get it out to the warfighter. Those that have testified in front of the main committee that--said that they would welcome that technology to have in their toolkit to protect America. And I know you want to do that, and I understand all the competing interests within the Air Force, but I would, you know, to the Air Force I would suggest that we absolutely, in a cost-effective manner, at least roll it out so our combatant commanders have the use of CHAMP in the future, because we don't know what our next crisis is going to be. So with that, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your time. And, Dr. Walker, if you could get back to me on both of those issues I would appreciate it. Thank you. Dr. Walker. Yes, sir. [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix beginning on page 120.] Mr. Wilson. Thank you very much, Sheriff Nugent. And we appreciate your passion as a dad of service members. You can tell why he is into this, and so we are so grateful. We have Congressman Aguilar, of California. Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the hearing and the opportunity to hear the discussion and the testimony. My first question had to do with sequestration, but I think that that has been tackled by the ranking member and the chairman quite well. And I appreciate your honesty and also the specifics that you have offered on programs that could face possible reductions. I think that is very helpful for us moving forward. Dr. Prabhakar, can I--can you tell me how that is pronounced first? That is my first question. Dr. Prabhakar. Prabhakar is correct. Mr. Aguilar. Prabhakar. Can you talk a little bit about managing risk and taking chances? Often government is risk-averse and safe, but DARPA seeks to engage, measure, and to create new capabilities. Can you talk about how you foster that within your department and, you know, what possible tools that you need in order to continue that mission? Dr. Prabhakar. Taking risk ends up being core to executing on our mission. We don't love risk. We actually like to try to beat it down and kill it off. But we need to be able to tackle it simply because we come to work to do the things that are going to have a huge impact. And, you know, I always tell my program managers, ``If you have a high-impact idea that doesn't involve taking a lot of risk, let's do it,'' because that is really the business we are in. But often, of course, as soon as you do those you have to move into the technologies that have a lot more risk if you are really going to reach for these kinds of dramatic changes in capability. So it is part and parcel of our mission. And very much to the nature of your question, I think it is essential for us as an organization to nurture the culture about being fearless about taking risk but then structuring programs to kill it off, to get--to build these technologies to a point that they are no longer risky, that they really can show their value so that they can be adopted and actually get in the hands of warfighters and make a difference. So how does that actually happen in practice? It happens in the way, in particular, that we structure our programs. Our program managers may define a very aggressive goal-- maybe it is a new way to launch satellites on orbit on a 24- hour notice, or maybe it is a way to build a firebreak to stop infectious disease. It could be whatever the DARPA program is. But with that ambitious goal is--the program is structured with very carefully thought-out milestones along the way to tell us if we are on track, are we making progress. And that allows our program managers to stop the projects that aren't working, redirect the efforts to more fruitful areas. When we see something that is working it allows us to put more resource and move faster in that area. And that kind of very hands-on, structured program is how we try to make that journey from high-risk to actually achieving the impact. Mr. Aguilar. Additional tools that you think might be necessary moving forward that can maintain that culture? Dr. Prabhakar. You know, the tools that this committee has already helped us with I think are critically essential--number one, bringing in people from all different parts of the technical community. Not just those who already live in the DOD S&T world, but people who come with backgrounds in commercial companies or having done startups or people out of universities--those different perspectives are very helpful. Our ability to contract with entities that aren't normally in the business of doing business with the Federal Government through other transactions authority, that is another way that allows us to reach farther in terms of technology and, you know, get access to some of these bleeding edge technologies. So I think a lot of the critical pieces are in place. I will tell you the single most important thing to allow us to keep taking risk is when we fail and when our projects don't work to--you know, we try to acknowledge that and say, ``Yes, it--that didn't work. We stopped it; now we are going to move on to something more productive.'' And I think when--your allowing us to fail so that we can keep going and take that next step is actually the most---- Mr. Aguilar. We need to be able to embrace that occasionally, as well. So thank you very much. I will yield back, Mr. Chairman, so someone else can get a question. Mr. Wilson. Thank you very much. And in consultation with the ranking member, what we would like to do is, Mr. Franks and Ms. Stefanik, if each of you could ask a question and then they could get back for the record? Mr. Franks. All right. Mr. Shaffer, I guess I will start with you. And I thank you, again, for your great service. What do you think the earliest we will be able to find an operational laser or high-powered microwave weapon, and especially as it relates to the laser and missile defense? And what additional resources would you need to either accelerate the development or to mitigate or down the technical risk? Mr. Wilson. And you can get back for the record and-- because we are in the midst of voting, and so thank you so much, Congressman Franks. [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix on page 120.] Mr. Wilson. And, Ms. Stefanik. Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, Mr. Chair. My question is for Ms. Miller. I represent the Army 10th Mountain Division based at Fort Drum, and this division, as you know, has continuously served in Afghanistan from 9/11 until today. Would you be able to discuss how the Army S&T enterprise is being utilized for the current mission in Afghanistan, and particularly in terms of the drawdown? Thank you. [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix on page 121.] Mr. Wilson. Thank you very much, Ms. Stefanik. We have one final question from Mr. Langevin? Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And again, thanks to our panel for the discussion this morning. So again, if you could get back to me on the record, just given the fact that time is tight. I was pleased to see Deputy Secretary Work's memo of March 17th creating the Electronic Warfare [EW] Executive Committee largely in response to the Defense Science Board's EW study, which pointed to lost focus on EW, particularly at the merge points of EW and cyber. So I couldn't agree more with the need for more focus on these issues and the need for strong, intellectually vibrant and technologically superior electronic warfare community. How do each of you see the creation of this organization changing how you conduct your business? Obviously with our adversaries using asymmetric threats and technologies and weapons to a greater extent than ever before that could overcome our both technological and numeric advantage, and perhaps even neutralizing it, we obviously need to focus more on our EW and cyber capabilities to neutralize those asymmetric threats. So I would like to hear your comments on that question. Thank you all. And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix on page 119.] Mr. Wilson. And thank you very much, Mr. Langevin. And indeed, as you can hear the bells and whistles, we are in the process of voting. But thank you for being here, and you have received the requests for the final questions, and we appreciate, again, very much your service, and we look forward to working with you in the future. And we wish Mr. Shaffer the best in his future career. God bless. We are adjourned. [Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] ======================================================================= A P P E N D I X March 26, 2015 ======================================================================= PREPARED STATEMENTS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD March 26, 2015 ======================================================================= [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ======================================================================= WITNESS RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS ASKED DURING THE HEARING March 26, 2015 ======================================================================= RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. LANGEVIN Mr. Shaffer and Dr. Prabhakar. The Electronic Warfare Executive Committee (EW EXCOM) is co-chaired by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and includes the Service Vice Chiefs, Service Acquisition Executives, the commanders of USSTRATCOM and USCYBERCOM, Director, Operational Test & Evaluation, Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, Director, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the DoD Chief Information Officer. This level of senior visibility and decision authority will necessarily focus attention and resources toward the challenges posed to our freedom of maneuver in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The EW EXCOM's initial focus is on ensuring that fielded weapon systems and those in earlier stages of development are designed and equipped to operate effectively in the EMS, notwithstanding the growing capabilities of potential adversaries. This means that weapon systems must have adequate electronic protection (EP) to withstand the growing electronic attack (EA) capabilities of our adversaries made possible by the worldwide proliferation of advanced devices for signal processing, and that continual expansion of EA capabilities is needed to maintain U.S. advantage. To do so, the Department requires closer coordination and cooperation among the Military Departments, the many acquisition programs of record, and both national and Military Department's research laboratories. This coordination and cooperation are an essential emphasis of the EW EXCOM. Effective operation in the EMS requires extensive knowledge of the spectrum and how the adversary is operating within it. Thus, efforts to collect signals, both at a strategic level with SIGINT and a tactical level with electronic warfare support (ES), require continued emphasis and support. Additionally, as operations in the EMS are increasingly connected and essential to both kinetic and non-kinetic operations across the range of military operations, electromagnetic battle management (EMBM) capabilities require development and thus attention by, and direction from, the EW EXCOM. Finally, the EXCOM will consider operational issues, including the quantity and expertise of EW personnel. Specifically, through efforts in science and technology, the EW Science and Technology Community of Interest developed a roadmap for use by the service laboratories. The EW S&T roadmap was developed by Military Departments' input and approved by the ASD(R&E) to define a cross-cutting EW S&T investment strategy. The EW EXCOM's support to implement the roadmap capabilities, or to provide direction to amend it if required, is anticipated. The ASD(R&E) will submit an annual review of progress on the EW S&T Roadmap for EW EXCOM approval. The ASD(R&E) will seek to inform the EW EXCOM, and be guided by it, on EW matters. The ASD(R&E) will provide input to the EW EXCOM on the technologies and capabilities we see relevant to EW, a process that has already begun. The EW EXCOM will provide and prioritize guidance to drive technology development to meet specific challenges. The EXCOM's authority will bolster the visibility and support of proposed EW capabilities relative to competing options and leverage the varied EW strengths of the Military Departments. In regard to EW and cyber, the EW EXCOM will address cyberspace operations as they relate to the EMS in coordination with the Cyber Investment Management Board (CIMB). [See page 24.] Ms. Miller. While it is too soon to say exactly how the newly- formed Electronic Warfare (EW) Executive Committee (ExCom) will impact our Science & Technology (S&T) programs, I would say that our EW and Cyber S&T efforts are already very well coordinated with the other Services and OSD through our involvement in the EW and Cyber Security Communities of Interest. We also coordinate extensively with our acquisition partners and the Training and Doctrine Command community during the development and execution of our programs to ensure we are addressing Warfighter needs. We will continue to collaborate across the DoD to address this important area and will participate in the EW ExCom as appropriate. [See page 24.] Admiral Winter. The Defense Science Board (DSB) recommendations regarding improving our Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities spanned all phases of military development, from science and technology (S&T) through acquisition and deployment. The March 17, 2015 memo from Deputy Defense Secretary Work established the Electronic Warfare Executive Committee and chartered this new group ``to provide senior oversight, coordination, budget/capability harmonization, and advice on EW matters to the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Deputy's Management Action Group.'' Further, it states the initial focus areas of the group ``will include EW strategy, acquisition, operational support, and security.'' Missing from this list is EW science and technology (S&T), which is where Office of Naval Research (ONR), the other service S&T organizations and DARPA can contribute. Fortunately, Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research & Engineering) has already established a joint S&T oversight group, the EW Community of Interest (COI), which produced in 2014 a far term joint roadmap for EW research and development. This Joint EW COI S&T Roadmap independently identified many of the shortfalls in current EW capabilities highlighted by the DSB study. More importantly, this roadmap shows how past, current and planned EW S&T investments in developing technology enablers have put the DoD on a path toward realizing a future EW vision to mitigate and eliminate these shortfalls. A separate Cyber S&T COI has produced a similar long term Joint Cyber S&T Roadmap and both COIs are working ``at the points where EW and cyber are converging.'' Our recommendation would be that the new EW Executive Committee adopt the EW COI and the Cyber COI as advisory bodies on S&T and endorse their respective roadmaps as the long term vision for future DoD EW/Cyber capability development. [See page 24.] Dr. Walker. The creation of the Electronic Warfare Executive Committee (EW EXCOM) will complement our existing efforts to harmonize the development of EW, Cyber, and integrated Cyber-EW capabilities across the Services and Agencies of the DoD. It will mesh well with the efforts and activities of the Assistant Secretary of Defense's (Research & Engineering) Reliance 21 Program in the Science & Technology (S&T) community. The EW EXCOM will provide senior oversight, coordination, budget/ capability harmonization, and advice on EW matters to the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the Deputy's Management Action Group. It will facilitate cohesion across requirements, science and technology (S&T), research, development, acquisition, test and evaluation (T&E), and sustainment to ensure that EW and joint electromagnetic spectrum operations (JEMSO) investments are effectively planned, executed, and coordinated across the DoD. The EW EXCOM will provide feedback to key senior level DoD decision-making bodies on the execution of EW requirements and acquisition processes. Underpinning the science and technology (S&T) leadership is an ecosystem of technical groups known as Communities of Interest (COIs). The COIs provide a forum for coordinating S&T strategies across the Department, sharing new ideas, technical directions and technology opportunities, jointly planning programs, measuring technical progress, and reporting on the general state of health for specific technology areas. Separate COIs for Electronic Warfare and Cyber exist and have been successful in their endeavors. The EW EXCOM, in coordination with the Cyber Investment Management Board, should provide an avenue to increase technology transitions from the EW and Cyber S&T COIs, potentially streamline acquisition of the technologies, and aid in establishing more integration and synergy of the technologies. [See page 24.] ______ RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. FRANKS Mr. Shaffer. The Department has an integrated technology and systems development roadmap for both high-energy lasers and microwaves (HEL, HPM). It is unlikely that either system could be operationally fielded before the 2022-2025 timeframe. Additional resources are not likely to accelerate development, but they could potentially contribute to significant lower risk reduction in achieving the necessary milestones. Development of both HEL and HPM is really an engineering challenge. Adding more resources is not likely to accelerate the engineering process. What more resources might facilitate is the chance to work on competing designs simultaneously, which could reduce technical risk, leading to a program of record that would be more predictable in cost and schedule. [See page 23.] ______ RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. NUGENT Dr. Walker. The rocket propulsion system effort, as referred to in the fiscal year 2015 National Defense Authorizations Act (NDAA), is funded in the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Program (SPACE)--EMD Program Element (PE) 0604853F. That effort is managed through the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Space (AFPEO/SP) in the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) at Los Angeles AFB, CA. The Air Force has obligated about $50 million so far; $37 million in fiscal 2014 money, which was reprogrammed in the Omnibus, and about $13 million of the fiscal year 2015 money, which was appropriated in 2015. We intend to invest an additional $45 million to $50 million over about the next six months. We issued a draft Rocket Propulsion System (RPS) Request for Proposals (RFPs) in April and will award multiple contracts with propulsion system or launch system providers to partner with their ongoing investment in domestic propulsion systems as part of our plan to develop a domestic propulsion system by 2019, and to do so competitively. However, this will only give us an engine, and an engine alone will not launch us into space. Transitioning the engine to a fully integrated tested and certified capability will take longer than that. This is the consensus of experts across the space enterprise. [See page 20.] Dr. Walker. We do not have the ability to give the combatant commanders this capability right now for a fraction of the cost. One year and $10 million is not sufficient to provide a CHAMP-like capability to the warfighter. Raytheon, a CHAMP contractor, has estimated that the cost and schedule to provide 32 missiles is four years and $140 million. This estimate does not include the cost, resources and planning required by the Air Force and the combatant commands for the development and implementation of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities (DOTMLPF) associated with a weapon system capability. Additionally, maintaining a very small number of CHAMP platforms, with the associated sophisticated hardware, in the inventory will be expensive. There are also concerns with the platform's survivability, ingress range, target engagement ranges, and guidance and navigation capabilities in a realistic scenario. Developing and producing any weapon system would not be funded within the Science and Technology portfolio. [See page 21.] ______ RESPONSE TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MS. STEFANIK Ms. Miller. One of the great strengths of Army Science & Technology (S&T) is our world-class cadre of nearly 12,000 scientists and engineers. For 30 years now, the Army has embedded scientists and technology experts in the field to ensure that the exchange of new technology and the feedback it yields moves efficiently between the researchers who develop it and the Soldiers who use it. In recent military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Army's labs have been an important source of rapid technology transition of solutions to meet operational needs. Through the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), our Field Assistance in Science and Technology (FAST) Activity brings Army labs and research and engineering centers into closer contact with their ``customers''--the major Army commands throughout the world, providing the Soldier in the field with greater support and responsiveness to operational needs. This includes the Science and Technology Assistance Team (Afghanistan) (STAT-A), a rotating 3-person team that from 2007 to 2014 provided in-theater technical advice and quick reaction solutions to technical problems, as well as a direct connection back to our scientists and engineers back home. Today, RDECOM provides the lead Engineer in the Rapid Equipping Force (REF) Expeditionary Lab in Afghanistan on a 179 day rotation supporting Soldiers on the ground. Over the past years, the Army S&T Enterprise has made numerous other important contributions to our efforts in Afghanistan. For example, our Deployable Force Protection (DFP) program was established in response to the DoD's priority initiative to improve force protection at forward operating bases (FOBs). U.S. military units operating remotely at small bases are more vulnerable to enemy attacks, especially extra small FOBs, combat outposts, and patrol bases where 300 personnel or less occupy the base. Their vulnerabilities are greater because they have less manpower and organic equipment for construction of protective measures, weapon systems with shorter kinetic reach, significant bandwidth limitations, and are generally more remote making them difficult to reach with reinforcements or supplies. The DFP S&T Program was stood-up to help address these shortfalls and was geared toward accelerated development of technologies with spiral transitions to acquisition partners or related activities such as the Rapid Equipping Force. The DFP program concluded in FY14, having delivered a number of important capabilities to US Forces-Afghanistan, including Cerberus Lite and Low-logistics Modular Protective Systems Mortar Pit Kits. These small FOB force protection capabilities were especially useful during the drawdown when the bases' manpower and organic capabilities were being reduced. Army S&T has also developed several Soldier power technologies that have transitioned through Program Executive Office Soldier and been provided specifically to the 10th Mountain Division. For example, the Conformal Wearable Battery (CWB) is a 2.3lb ergonomic Soldier-worn battery that bends to the curvature of the Soldier's chest and/or back and provides 150 watt-hours of power. The battery serves as the central source of power for multiple Soldier-worn devices, and increases Soldier mobility by better distributing weight around the Soldier's core. The Integrated Soldier Power/Data System (ISPDS) is an integrated Soldier worn power/ data distribution system intended to manage power and data from Soldier worn devices and powered by the CWB. The system manages the distribution of power across all worn peripherals and aggregates peripheral data onto a common end-user device. Over a 72 hour period, ISPDS provides a 32 percent weight savings in batteries. Both these technologies were provided to the 1st, 3rd and 4th Brigades, 10th Mountain Division, between 2012 and 2014. [See page 23.] ======================================================================= QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MEMBERS POST HEARING March 26, 2015 ======================================================================= QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. WILSON Mr. Wilson. Could you give us an update on the status of the ``Trusted Foundry'' program for providing a secure source of microchips for sensitive defense systems? What is being done to respond to the recent announcement that IBM plans to sell its Foundry capabilities to a foreign controlled company? Mr. Shaffer. [The information referred to is for official use only and retained in the committee files.] Mr. Wilson. Do you have enough visibility into industry-directed independent research and development (IR&D)? Are there additional legislative tools you need to be more effective in coordinating with those investments? Mr. Shaffer. IR&D conducted by defense contractors as an allowable overhead expense can be an important source of innovation for both industry and DoD. IR&D represents well over $4 billion in annual R&D spending. Reviews of IR&D spending indicate that a significant fraction of IR&D is being spent on near-term competitive opportunities and on de minimis investments principally intended to create intellectual property rights for a company. IR&D allowability should encourage contractors to engage in R&D activities of potential interest to DoD. We have established a database in which companies meeting certain dollar thresholds are required to report their IR&D projects. Because companies enter the information at the end of their Fiscal Year, our visibility is limited to looking in the past. We are working to increase visibility into IR&D without increasing administrative burdens or requiring legislation. Mr. Wilson. What tools do you have to transition successful technologies developed by S&T, whether in the labs or from contractors, into programs of record? Mr. Shaffer. Prototyping and experimentation have become key transition tools. Prototypes are preliminary versions of a system or major sub-system assembled to resolve some area of risk and/or to explore operational potential. Experimentation puts prototypes into end users' hands in an operational context. Experimentation capabilities span ranges from field use by military personnel, wargaming, simulation, Service/Combatant Command exercises, and government/ industry live, virtual and constructive environments. Prototyping and experimentation aid in the transition of successful technologies by providing Warfighters with the opportunity to explore novel operational concepts. In addition, they provide a hedge against threat development and reduce the lead time to develop and field new capabilities. Mr. Wilson. How important are programs like the Small Business Innovative Research program (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer program (STTR), or the Rapid Innovation Program (RIP) to your technology transition efforts? Mr. Shaffer. SBIR/STTR and RIP are key enablers for transitioning small business technologies into DoD products. Based on a recent DoD- wide survey of military and industry RIP participants, RIP remains one of the few programs available to acquisition managers to solicit competitively for technology refresh, providing small businesses an ``on-ramp'' into defense acquisition programs. RIP stimulates U.S. manufacturing and supports small businesses. Eighty-eight percent of RIP contracts (321 of the 365 awards over a five year period) are awarded to small businesses, with over seventy- five percent awarded to businesses that participate or have participated in the SBIR program. Mr. Wilson. Do you have enough visibility into industry-directed independent research and development (IR&D)? Are there additional legislative tools you need to be more effective in coordinating with those investments? Ms. Miller. The Army currently has sufficient visibility into industry-directed independent research and development (IR&D). In fact, quarterly IR&D updates are held at the OSD level between the heads of large defense companies and Defense and Service Acquisition and S&T leads and provide a regular opportunity to exchange dialogue and inform investment decisions in their R&D portfolios. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) rules provide for a major contractor's annual IR&D costs to be allowable only if the contractor reports its IR&D projects to the Department of Defense. Currently this reporting is done through the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) via an online form. Participating companies are required to update their efforts annually and again upon project completion. While the DoD has visibility into IR&D projects, the DoD has only limited ability to impact the allowability of the projects and therefore may require statutory or regulatory changes to gain the ability to endorse or reject projects prior to their initiation. Mr. Wilson. What tools do you have to transition successful technologies developed by S&T, whether in the labs or from contractors, into programs of record? How important are programs like the Small Business Innovative Research program (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer program (STTR), or the Rapid Innovation Program to your technology transition efforts? Ms. Miller. One example of the tools that exist within the Army to assist in the transition of technologies is the Army's Technology Maturation Initiative (TMI) (Program Element 0604115A), which aligns S&T and acquisition partners under a coordinated effort to assess emerging but needed capability improvements and facilitate their transition to Programs of Record. TMI matures high-payoff S&T products beyond traditional technology readiness levels in order to drive down program risks, inform affordable and achievable requirements and increase transition success. By engaging key stakeholders from the requirements, technology, acquisition and resourcing communities to select and oversee the TMI and other prototyping efforts, we are able to prioritize and coordinate efforts that best enable the integration of new capability into current and planned Acquisition programs. The Army SBIR and STTR programs also aid in technology transition by providing acquisition Program Managers with visibility of innovative small business technologies. Army SBIR Phase I projects develop proof of concept solutions and Phase II further develops those technologies into prototypes. The Army SBIR program uses their Phase II Enhancement Program to facilitate transition of promising technologies into acquisition programs. Under the Phase II enhancement program, the acquisition program needs to make a tangible commitment to the transition, and SBIR will provide up to $500,000. Started in 2008, this program has led to many successful transitions into acquisition programs and industry. The Army has also used the Rapid Innovation Funding (RIF) program to transition technologies. The RIF program provides the Army a useful mechanism to address Program Executive Office and the Research community near-term challenges. Of the 71 projects awarded in Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012, nine have transitioned to acquisition programs with committed outyear funding and an additional 58 are working transition agreements, with outyear funding not yet committed. Mr. Wilson. Do you have enough visibility into industry-directed independent research and development (IR&D)? Are there additional legislative tools you need to be more effective in coordinating with those investments? Admiral Winter. As reflected in the recent guidance on Better Buying Power (BBP) 3.0 issued by USD/AT&L, there is clearly a need for increasing our visibility into industry IR&D. This is a valuable complement to the Services' RDT&E investments, but to ensure that it is being used productively, we need to increase communications between industry and Government on the subject. Under BBP 3.0, this is being done in two ways. First, we have initiated a recurring series of Technology Interchange Meetings (TIMs), organized by the DoD technical Communities of Interest, which will provide a forum for the Government to communicate future strategies and program thrusts to industry and for industry to share relevant IR&D efforts with Government subject matter experts. The initial stages of these information exchanges will be accomplished virtually, via the DTIC hosted Defense Innovation Marketplace. Based upon reviews of these initial exchanges, face to face meetings and reviews of relevant projects will be conducted. The outcome of these TIMs will include both increased shared situational awareness and the identification of potential new areas for partnering between Government and industry. Second, we are initiating a new process for review and endorsement of IR&D efforts prior to the Government making a determination regarding allowable IR&D expenses. Discussions with industry regarding this new process and specific mechanisms to accomplish it are ongoing. Depending on the outcome of these discussions, there may be a need for legislative action to support implementation of the new process. However, that is yet to be determined, so no action is requested at this time. The resulting process will increase Government visibility into industry strategy and focus of IR&D efforts, allowing the Government to more effectively inform industry of relevant RDT&E programs and shape those programs to better leverage industry investment. Mr. Wilson. What tools do you have to transition successful technologies developed by S&T, whether in the labs or from contractors, into programs of record? How important are programs like the Small Business Innovative Research program (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer program (STTR), or the Rapid Innovation Program to your technology transition efforts? Admiral Winter. GAO recently reported positively on DoN's approach and tools for technology transition. Technology Transition Programs Support Military Users, but Opportunities Exist to Improve Measurement of Outcomes GAO-13-286: Published: Mar 7, 2013. One of DoN's primary investments in late term transition focused research is the Future Naval Capability (FNC) program. This science and technology (S&T) investment portfolio utilizes nine (two-star level) mission-focused Department-wide Integrated Product Teams to collaborate to determine the naval need, product priority, and appropriate technology focus of any new FNC S&T investments. These FNCs are recommended at the two-star (IPT) level and forwarded to a naval technology oversight board at the three-star level for approval. Once approved at the"
