        "text": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Stuart\n\nGloria Frances Stewart, known by the stage name Gloria Stuart, (July 4, 1910 – September 26, 2010) was an American actress, activist, painter, bonsai artist and fine art printer and printmaker. Stuart had a Hollywood career which spanned (with a long break in the middle) from 1932 until 2004 where she appeared on stage, television and in film, for which she was best-known. She appeared as Claude Rains' sweetheart in The Invisible Man, and as the elderly Rose Dawson Calvert in the Academy Award-winning film Titanic. She was the oldest person to be nominated for a competitive Oscar, for her role in Titanic, at the age of 87.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nStuart was born Gloria Frances Stewart in Santa Monica, California, a third-generation Californian. Her mother, Alice Vaughan Deidrick Stewart, was born in Angels Camp, California. Her father, Frank Stewart, was an attorney representing many Tongs in San Francisco. Gloria's brother, Frank, came eleven months later. A second brother, Thomas, died in infancy. When Gloria was nine years old, her father, who had been appointed a judge and was about to take the bench, was hit by a car and died. Her mother got a job in the Ocean Park, California, Post Office to support her children. Alice Stewart remarried, to Fred J. Finch, a native of Kentucky, who owned a local funeral parlor and held oil leases in Texas. A half-sister, Patsy — Patricia Marie Finch — was born in 1924. Gloria's younger brother Frank took the surname Finch, later becoming a sportswriter for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nShe later changed the spelling of her surname when she began her career, reportedly because \"Stuart\" would fit better on a marquee.\n\nShe attended Santa Monica High School, graduating in 1927, then immediately ran off to Berkeley to attend the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, she majored in drama and philosophy but dropped out in her junior year to marry Blair Gordon Newell, a San Francisco sculptor working under Ralph Stackpole on the facade of the San Francisco Stock Exchange building. The Newells lived a bohemian life in Carmel and were part of a circle of artists including Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, and Robinson Jeffers. She acted at the Carmel Playhouse and worked on the Carmel newspaper. Returning to Los Angeles, she appeared at the Pasadena Playhouse and was immediately signed to a contract by Universal Studios in 1932. She became a favorite of director James Whale, appearing in his The Old Dark House (1932), The Kiss Before the Mirror (1933) and The Invisible Man (1933).\n\nStuart was an activist and became a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild, but her career with Universal was disappointing. She moved to 20th Century Fox, and by the end of the decade had appeared in more than forty films, including Busby Berkeley's Gold Diggers of 1935 and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. She appeared alongside such stars as Lionel Atwill, Lionel Barrymore, Freddie Bartholomew, Warner Baxter, James Cagney, Eddie Cantor, Melvyn Douglas, Ruth Etting, Boris Karloff, Paul Lukas, Raymond Massey, Pat O'Brien, Al Pearce, Dick Powell, Claude Rains, the Ritz Brothers, Shirley Temple and Lee Tracy.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1934, Stuart and Newell divorced amicably and she married screenwriter Arthur Sheekman, one of the writers on Roman Scandals. Sheekman was Groucho Marx's best friend and was collaborating (sometimes without credit) on Marx Brothers films. Later, Sheekman ghostwrote several of Marx's books; Marx called him \"The Fastest Wit in the West\". The Sheekmans' daughter, Sylvia Vaughn Sheekman, was born in 1935. Four years later, Stuart convinced her husband they should travel around the world. When they reached France, they tried to volunteer for the French Resistance, but were turned down, so they caught the last ship sailing to New York.\n\nThey decided to stay in New York and work in the theater. In the next few years, Sheekman wrote several plays (two with George S. Kaufman) and Stuart got roles mostly in summer stock, including Emily to Thornton Wilder's Stage Manager in Our Town. When Sheekman's third play flopped, they returned to Hollywood, and he was hired by Paramount Pictures. Stuart took singing lessons and toured the country entertaining the troops in hospitals and selling war bonds.\n\nIn 1943, the Sheekmans moved into Villa 12 at the Garden of Allah Hotel in Hollywood, where Gloria quickly established herself as an unofficial hostess, often preparing extravagant dinner parties after collecting food ration stamps from invitees and shopping creatively at the Farmers Market on Fairfax Avenue. In 1946, she opened a small business, Décor, Ltd, where she sold lamps, tables, chests and other objets d'art of decoupage she created.\n\nSheekman wrote seventeen screenplays during the next sixteen years. In 1954, with their daughter studying at UC Berkeley, Gloria and Arthur Sheekman joined friends who were living abroad, settling in Rapallo on the Italian Riviera. Inspired by the success of the primitive paintings of Grandma Moses, Stuart took up oil painting. Her first one-woman show at the Hammer Galleries in New York all but sold out. After forty-three years of happy marriage, husband Arthur Sheekman succumbed to the effects of Alzheimers Disease, and died on January 12, 1978, just weeks before his 77th birthday.\n\nAccording to the widow's autobiography, \"I Just Kept Hoping,\" Sheekman was cremated and his ashes were buried beneath a tree at their home in Brentwood, California.\n\nStuart was also active in political and social causes, Stuart helped form the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League in 1936, the same year she and writer Dorothy Parker helped organize the League to Support the Spanish War Orphans. She also became a member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee and was on the executive board of the California State Democratic Committee. For several decades she was a member of The Wesley United Methodist Church in Los Angeles, California.\n\nStuart was a friend of the author Christopher Isherwood and his longtime companion, the portraitist Don Bachardy, who made several portraits of Stuart. She discusses her relationship to the pair, and particularly her views on Bachardy's art, in video interviews included among the supplementary outtakes on the DVD release of the documentary film Chris and Don: A Love Story.\n\nReturn to acting – 1970s to 2000s\n\nIn 1975, after twenty-nine years away from acting, with her husband, Arthur, in a nursing home suffering from Alzheimer's, Gloria got herself an agent and hoped for work. In 1978, Arthur died. Over the next few years she appeared in small parts in television. Then in 1982 came an offer for what was to be one of her favorite scenes in all her films: playing a silver-haired dowager taking a solitary turn around a dance floor with Peter O'Toole in My Favorite Year.\n\nDuring this period, Stuart took up the Japanese art of bonsai, becoming the first Anglo member of the California Bonsai Society. And she began to travel again, going with friends or on her own to Europe, India, Africa, the Balkans. In 1983, Stuart became romantically involved with California printer Ward Ritchie, whom she had known during her college years. Ritchie taught her how to run an antique book press. She bought her own hand press and established \"Imprenta Glorias\", and began creating artists' books (books hand-made, labor intensive, usually with a very limited run). Stuart wrote the text, designed the book, set the type, printed the pages, and finished pages with water colors or silk screen or decoupage. Books from Imprenta Glorias are in the Metropolitan Museum, Library of Congress, Huntington Library, J. Paul Getty Museum, Morgan Library, Victoria and Albert Museum, Bibliothèque nationale de France, and numerous private and university collections. No longer able to work with small type and a large heavy press, she gave her press and sets of rare type to Mills College. Stuart and Ritchie maintained their close relationship until his death from cancer in 1996.\n\nNot long after Ritchie's death, Stuart landed the character of 100-year-old Rose, at the heart of James Cameron's Titanic. Stuart was nominated for an Academy Award, Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She remains the oldest person ever to have been nominated for an Oscar. Suzy Amis credited Stuart for bringing her together on the set with her eventual husband, director James Cameron. Stuart published her autobiography, I Just Kept Hoping, in 1999, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000. Her last appearance on film was a role in Wim Wenders's Land of Plenty in 2004, and afterward she gave numerous filmed and audio interviews. Stuart continued to work at her artist's books, finishing a miniature about a time when she was in Berkeley, called I Dated J. Robert Oppenheimer. Even after her retirement from film acting in 2004, she remained never far away from the public eye.\n\nOther work\n\nHer poem, 'You Are Gone Now', was set to music by Richard Tauber, who first sang it in her presence at a concert in Los Angeles on November 30, 1937.\n\nWhen Stuart was 99 years old, she was interviewed by writer and actor Mark Gatiss about her role in theThe Old Dark House by James Whale, and about her co-star Boris Karloff, for his 2010 BBC documentary series A History of Horror.\n\nDeath\n\nStuart was diagnosed with lung cancer at around age 95; however, she still lived to see her 100th birthday. Stuart died less than three months later in her sleep of respiratory failure on September 26, 2010, at age 100.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nOn June 19, 2010, Stuart was honoured by the Screen Actors Guild for her years of service. She was presented the Ralph Morgan Award by Titanic co-star Frances Fisher and in response Stuart replied, \"I'm very, very grateful. I've had a wonderful life of giving and sharing.\"[9] On July 4, 2010, Stuart celebrated her 100th birthday at the ACE Gallery in Beverly Hills with a party hosted by the director of Titanic, James Cameron and his wife, Suzy Amis. Frances Fisher, and Shirley MacLaine were among the guests.\n\nOn July 22, 2010, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honoured her career with a program featuring film clips and a conversation between Stuart and film historian Leonard Maltin.\n\nStuart later said that she relates with her comeback character of the 100-year-old Rose saying: \"I think that's the important thing, if you're full of love, admiration, appreciation of the beautiful things there are in this life, you have it made, really. And I have it made.\"\n\nLegacy\n\nDocumentary of Stuart's life\n\nA new documentary is currently in production called \"The Secret Life of Old Rose\" which explores Stuart's long acting career as well as her career as an artist, fine art printer and printmaker, and bonsai master. The link to the documentary is: http://www.secretlifeofoldrose.com The documentary is produced and directed by Benjamin Stuart Thompson, Gloria Stuart's grandson.\n\nButterfly Summers\n\nGloria Stuart's great granddaughter Deborah B. Thompson published a memoir in March 2012 entitled \"Butterfly Summers: A Memoir of Gloria Stuart's Apprentice.\" Through the ebook, Deborah shares her personal experience of working closely with her great grandmother to complete a set of butterfly-shaped artist's books over the course of five years. The New York Times bestselling author Alice Hoffman writes, \"Here is the heart-felt and moving story of the bond between a young woman and her great grandmother -- who happens to be a Hollywood movie star -- but the real connection is forged by a love of art and books and by their love for one another.\"\n\nFilmography\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Stuart#Filmography\n\nTelevision\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Stuart#Television\n\nGloria Stuart From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Gloria Stuart Gloria Stuart ODH 1932.png Stuart in a 1932 publicity photo for James Whale's The Old Dark House Born Gloria Stewart July 4, 1910 Santa Monica, California, U.S. Died September 26, 2010 (aged 100) Los Angeles, California, U.S. Cause of death Respiratory failure; lung cancer Education University of California, Berkeley Occupation Actress, artist, fine printer Political party Democratic Spouse(s) Blair Gordon Newell (1930–1934; divorced) Arthur Sheekman (1934–1978; his death) Children Sylvia Vaughn Thompson (b. 1935) Gloria Frances Stewart,[1] known as Gloria Stuart, (July 4, 1910 – September 26, 2010) was an American actress and visual artist. Stuart began her acting career in theater. In the 1930s and 1940s, she performed in little theater and summer stock in Los Angeles and New York City. She signed a contract with Universal Pictures in 1932, and acted in numerous films, including The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), and The Three Musketeers (1939).\n\nIn 1945, Stuart abandoned her acting career and shifted to a career as an artist, working as a fine printer and making paintings, serigraphy, Bonsai, and découpage for the next five decades. She returned to acting in the late 1970s, appearing in several bit parts, including in Richard Benjamin's My Favorite Year (1982) and Wildcats (1986).\n\nIn 1997, she was cast as the 100-year-old elder Rose Dawson in James Cameron's Titanic, for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Receiving her nomination at eighty-seven, she is the oldest person nominated for an Academy Award for acting.[2] Her last film performance was in Wim Wenders' Land of Plenty (2004) before her death in 2010 at the age of 100.\n\nIn addition to her acting and art career, Stuart was also an environmental activist and one of the founding members of the Screen Actors Guild.[3][4]\n\nContents [hide] 1 Early life 2 Acting career 2.1 Introduction to Hollywood: 1932–1934 2.2 20th Century Fox; marriage: 1935-1939 2.3 Departure from Hollywood: 1940–1943 2.4 Return to Hollywood; bit parts: 1975-1996 2.5 Titanic: 1996-1998 2.6 Final roles, accolades: 1999-2010 3 Art career 3.1 Painting, serigraphy 3.2 Bonsai artwork 4 Later life and death 5 Personal life 5.1 Activism 6 Legacy 7 Filmography 7.1 Television 8 References 9 External links Early life[edit] Stuart was born Gloria Stewart [5] at 11:00 p.m. on the Fourth of July in Santa Monica, California.[6][A] Stuart's father, Frank Stewart, born in Washington state[8] was an attorney representing The Six Companies, Chinese tongs in San Francisco. Stuart's brother, Frank Jr.,[9] was born eleven months later. In two years, their brother Thomas was born, but he died of spinal meningitis aged three years.[6]\n\nWhen Stuart was nine years old, her father was fatally injured when hit by a car.[10] Hard-pressed to support two small children, her mother soon accepted the proposal of local businessman Fred J. Finch.[B][11] Stuart went through school as Gloria Fae Finch.[12] Since her parents did not give her a middle name, she often adopted one (sometimes it was Frances, the feminine of Frank, her father's name).\n\nStuart attended Santa Monica High School where she was active in theater, and had the lead in her senior class play, The Swan.[13] She loved writing as much as acting, and spent her last two summers in high school taking short story and poetry writing classes[14] and working as a cub reporter for the Santa Monica Outlook.[15]\n\nShe enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, majoring in philosophy and drama, appeared in more plays, worked on the Daily Californian,[16] contributed to the campus literary journal, Occident, and posed as an artist's model. It was at Berkeley that she began signing her name Gloria Stuart.[C]\n\nAt the end of her junior year, in June, 1930, Stuart married Blair Gordon Newell,[17] a young sculptor who apprenticed with Ralph Stackpole on the facade of the San Francisco Stock Exchange building.[18] The Newells moved to Carmel-by-the-Sea where there was a stimulating community of artists and movers and shakers such as Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Robinson Jeffers and Lincoln Steffens and his wife Ella Winter.\n\nStuart acted at the Theatre of the Golden Bough and worked many jobs on The Carmelite newspaper. In her spare time she hand-sewed aprons, patchwork pillows and tea linens and created bouquets of dried flowers for a tea shop where she also waited on tables when needed.[19] Newell laid brick, chopped and stacked wood, taught sculpture and woodworking, and managed a miniature golf course. They lived in a shack in the middle of a wood yard as night watchmen.[20]\n\nActing career[edit] Introduction to Hollywood: 1932–1934[edit]\n\nGloria Stuart, fourth from left, top row, with the rest of the 1932 WAMPAS Baby Stars. Stuart's theater work in Carmel brought her to the attention of Gilmor Brown's private theater, The Playbox, in Pasadena. She was invited there to appear as Masha in Chekhov's The Seagull.[21] Opening night, casting directors from Paramount and Universal were in the audience. Both came backstage to arrange a screen test, both studios claimed her. Finally the studios flipped a coin and Universal won the toss.[16] Stuart considered herself a serious actress in theater but she and Newell \"were stony broke, living hand to mouth\" so she decided to sign a contract.[22]\n\nStuart does not mention it in her book, but the Internet Movie Database includes her with thirty other players in a slapstick comedy, The Cohens and Kellys in Hollywood, A Behind-the-Scenes Farce.[23] Produced by Universal in the spring of 1932, this is likely Gloria Stuart's first appearance before the camera. Stuart actually began her movie career by playing an ingénue confronting her father's mistress in Street of Women, a Pre-Code fallen-women film. Stuart's second turn, again playing the ingénue, was in a football-hero movie, The All-American.\n\nIn early December, 1932, the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers announced that Gloria Stuart was one of fifteen new movie actresses \"Most Likely to Succeed\"—she was a WAMPAS Baby Star. Ginger Rogers, Mary Carlisle, Eleanor Holm were among the others.[24]\n\nStuart's career advanced when English director James Whale chose her for the glamor role as a sentimental wife who winds up stranded among strangers at a spooky mansion in his ensemble cast (Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Lilian Bond, Ernest Thesiger, Eva Moore and Raymond Massey) for The Old Dark House (1932). The film was critically praised, and The New York Times called Stuart's performance \"clever and charming,\"[25] with the movie later becoming a cult classic. Stuart's experience filming The Old Dark House also became integral to the formation of the Screen Actors Guild in 1933:\n\n\"James [Whale] joined all the English actors,” Stuart recalled. “So on one side of the set they had their ‘elevensies’ and foursies,’ and Melvyn [Douglas] and I would be sitting together, not invited. One day, Melvyn said to me, Are you interested in forming a union together?’ I said, ‘What’s a union?’ He said, ‘Like in New York – Actor’s Equity. The actors get together and work for better working conditions.’ I said, ‘Oh wonderful,’ because I was getting up at five every morning; in makeup at seven, in hair at eight, wardrobe at quarter of nine, and then sometimes if production wanted you to, you worked until four or five the next morning. There was no overtime. They fed us when they felt like it, when it was convenient for production. It was really very, very hard work.\"[26]\n\nAfter filming completed, Stuart began canvassing, and was one of the union's first founding members.\n\nStuart in The Old Dark House (1932), in her first starring role Stuart was given her first co-starring role by director John Ford in her next film, Air Mail, playing opposite Pat O'Brien and Ralph Bellamy. Of her performance in the movie, the New York Times Mordaunt Hall wrote, \"Gloria Stuart, who does so well in The Old Dark House, a picture now at the Rialto, makes the most of the part of the girl...\"[27] That two Gloria Stuart movies were in theaters simultaneously became the rule rather than the exception in her early career. In 1932, her first year, Stuart had four films released, then nine in 1933, six in 1934. In 1935, Stuart was having a baby, so only four movies were released. Six movies followed in 1936. After Air Mail, Mordaunt Hall's notices for Gloria Stuart came down to a few words. Laughter in Hell: \"Gloria Stuart appears as Lorraine...\";[28] Sweepings: \"...played by the comely Gloria Stuart...\";[29] Private Jones: \"Gloria Stuart is charming...\"[30]\n\nJames Whale called Stuart back for just one scene in The Kiss Before the Mirror, but the critic Hall wrote, \"There are those who may think that it is too bad to introduce as one of the players the dainty Gloria Stuart and have her killed off in the first episode of the narrative. Perhaps it is, but a pretty girl was needed for the part and Mr. Whale obviously did not wish to weaken his production by casting an incompetent actress or an unattractive one for this minor role.\"[31]\n\nAfter good notices in The Girl in 419, (Mordaunt Hall mentions \"...the pleasing acting of the attractive Gloria Stuart),[32] and Secret of the Blue Room (\"Miss Stuart gives a pleasing performance.\"),[33] James Whale cast Gloria Stuart opposite Claude Rains in The Invisible Man. Rains was a celebrated import from the London stage and this was his first Hollywood film. (Mordaunt Hall's review of Stuart's work was a temperate, \"Miss Stuart also does well by her role.\"[34]) The Invisible Man also became a cult favorite.\n\n20th Century Fox; marriage: 1935-1939[edit]\n\nHere with James Cagney from the 1934 film Here Comes the Navy. In 1934, Universal loaned-out Stuart to Warner Brothers for Here Comes the Navy. Stuart co-starred with James Cagney and Pat O'Brien, the first of nine films featuring this male team. Frank S. Nugent wrote in the New York Times, \"Supporting Mr. Cagney--and doing very creditable jobs, too--are Pat O'Brien, Gloria Stuart...\"[35][36]\n\nIn 1935, Stuart was cast as Dick Powell's love interest in Busby Berkeley's, Gold Diggers of 1935. It was a musical; Stuart did not dance or sing, and the New York Times critic commented: \"Nor has Gloria Stuart anything of vast import to contribute in the position usually occupied by Ruby Keeler.\"[37]\n\nIn that same year, Stuart left Universal and joined Twentieth Century-Fox. Her first assignment from the studio head, Darryl F. Zanuck, was in Professional Soldier supporting the child star Freddie Bartholomew and Academy Award winner Victor McLaglen (the year before, McLaglen won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role in John Ford's The Informer). Frank S. Nugent noted: \"There is a minor romance along the way between Gloria Stuart, the king's noble governess, and Michael Whalen, the professional soldier's part-time assistant, but no one should take it seriously.\"[38]\n\nIn 1936, John Ford chose Stuart to co-star with Warner Baxter in The Prisoner of Shark Island. Playing the wife of the doctor who treated Lincoln's assassin, Stuart felt privileged to work again with Ford,[39] although the New York Times Frank S. Nugent wrote of Stuart's \"...helpful performance...\"[40] In Poor Little Rich Girl, Stuart again was asked to support a child star: this time, Shirley Temple. Frank S. Nugent: \"Listing [Temple's] supporting players hastily, then, before we forget them entirely, we might mention Miss Faye [and] Gloria Stuart…as having been permitted a scene or two while Miss Temple was out freshening her costume.\"[41]\n\nStuart in a publicity photo for Life Begins in College (1937) For the rest of 1936 and through 1937, Zanuck placed Stuart in movies such as The Girl on the Front Page—Frank S. Nugent's note: \"Call it mediocre and extend your sympathies to the cast…\"[42] Reviewing Girl Overboard, Nugent begins, \"In the definitive words of the currently popular threnode featured by a frog-voiced radio singer, Universal's 'Girl Overboard'…is 'nuthin' but a nuthin',' and a Class B nuthin' at that.\"[43] The Lady Escapes, Life Begins in College and Change of Heart did not even merit space in the New York Times movie pages. In 1938, Zanuck again insisted Stuart support Shirley Temple. Of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, Variety wrote: \"Shirley Temple proves she's a great little artist in this one. The rest of it is synthetic and disappointing... More fitting title would be Rebecca of Radio City.\"[44][45] In 1938, for the fourth time, Stuart was a supporting player to a child star: Jane Withers in Keep Smiling. Stuart but not her performance is noted in the New York Times review.[46]\n\nIn Time Out for Murder, Stuart's reviewer said she was \"…a pretty bill collector\".[47] Then in 1939, the last year in this phase of Stuart's career, in The Three Musketeers, Stuart's billing came after Don Ameche, The Ritz Brothers and Binnie Barnes and again Stuart's work was not reviewed. In Winner Take All, the Times critic wrote, \"…the only thing worth seeing in the picture is Tony Martin trying to play a prizefighter. This is positively killing.\"[48] It Could Happen to You, \"a quasi-comedy\"[49] co-starring Stuart Erwin, finished the eight years. Again Stuart is not mentioned.\n\nWhat did give the actress space in the movie pages the previous November was the story: \"Gloria Stuart Quits Fox...Gloria Stuart has terminated her contract with Fox...\"[50] In fact, Darryl Zanuck did not renew Stuart's contract.[51]\n\nStuart's sculptor husband at the time, Gordon Newell, was unhappy with Hollywood life. He and Stuart separated amicably and divorced.[52] In 1933 on the set of her film Roman Scandals, a comedy starring Eddie Cantor, Stuart met Arthur Sheekman, one of the movie's writers.[53] They were \"instantly attracted to each other\".[53] Stuart and Sheekman married in August, 1934[54] and their daughter, Sylvia – named after Princess Sylvia, Stuart’s character in Roman Scandals – was born the following June.[55]\n\nDeparture from Hollywood: 1940–1943[edit]\n\nStuart in a publicity still ca. 1937 Early in 1939, Stuart and then-husband Sheekman spent four months traveling in Asia, Egypt and Italy, then landed in France just as France and England declared war on Germany.[56][57] They appealed to the American consul, asking to stay, Sheekman as a war correspondent, Stuart as a hospital volunteer. The consul refused help, and told them they had to return to the United States. They caught the SS President Adams, the last American passenger ship to cross the Atlantic, [58] and arrived in New York City in September.\n\nIn New York, Stuart sought to return to stage acting on Broadway.[59] \"I wanted to be a theater actress,\" she said, \"but I thought it would be easier to get to New York and the theater if I had a name than if I just walked the streets as a little girl from California. When I went back to New York with somewhat of a name, they didn't want movie actresses.\"[59] Stuart was, however, welcomed into summer stock theater on the east coast, and performed in Man and Superman, The Animal Kingdom, The Night of January 16th, Accent on Youth, Route 101, Mr. and Mrs. North, The Pursuit of Happiness, Here Today, Sailor Beware and was Emily to Thornton Wilder’s Stage Manager—under Wilder’s own direction—in Our Town.[60] But for two years, as many readings, lunches and cocktail parties as she attended, no director, producer or writer (not even Sheekman) gave Stuart a role on Broadway. [61]\n\nTo help with the war effort in the 1940s,[62] Stuart took singing and dancing lessons, then the USO teamed her with actress Hillary Brooke.[63] The two blonde actresses toured the country, visited hospitals, danced with servicemen in canteens, sold war bonds. Stuart \"wanted terribly to volunteer for service overseas with the USO, but Arthur wouldn't hear of it.\"[64]\n\nStuart asked her former agents to get her work. Her first movie in four years, Here Comes Elmer, was a comedy with music starring Roy Rogers’ wife, Dale Evans. In The Whistler—an early directing credit of the horror specialist, William Castle—Stuart co-starred with Richard Dix. In Enemy of Women, Stuart was seventh in billing.[64] Two years later, Stuart took one more role: she wore a redhead's wig in a comedy starring Joan Davis and Jack Oakie. Stuart does not mention She Wrote the Book in her autobiography.[65]\n\nReturn to Hollywood; bit parts: 1975-1996[edit] In 1975, after nearly thirty years out of the business, Stuart decided to return to acting. She got an agent who obtained her bit parts, mostly in television— including guest appearances on series such as The Waltons and Murder, She Wrote.[66] Her friend director Nancy Malone gave her a leading role in Merlene of the Movies, a quirky film for television, and other friends gave her parts in their shows. In 1982 came My Favorite Year. Although Stuart's scene lasted moments and she had no lines, she was dancing with Peter O'Toole. She wrote, \"It was a great privilege to work with him.\"[62] [67] After that, Stuart was in Jack Lemmon's Mass Appeal and Goldie Hawn's Wildcats, then more bits and pieces in television.[68] A vintage publicity photo of her was also used for the image of 'Peg', the sister of butler Alfred Pennyworth, in the 1997 film Batman & Robin.\n\nStuart's husband Arthur Sheekman died in January, 1978.[69] Five years later, Ward Ritchie, a close friend of Stuart’s first husband, Gordon Newell, sent Stuart one of his books. Ritchie had become a celebrated printer, book designer and printing historian.[70] With his commercial Ward Ritchie Press and private Laguna Verde Imprenta press, Ritchie produced distinguished books on the arts, poetry, cookery and the American West. Stuart invited him to dinner and they fell in love. Ritchie was seventy-eight and Stuart seventy-two.[71]\n\nWhen Stuart first followed Ritchie into his studio and watched him pull a printed page from his 1839 English iron Albion hand press, she wanted to do it, too.[72] After studying typesetting at the Women’s Workshop in Los Angeles, Stuart bought her own hand press, a Vandercook SP15[73] and established her own private press, Imprenta Glorias.\n\nStuart’s next discovery was the Artist’s book.[74] She designed the books, wrote the text (often poetry), set the type—carefully selecting the style of type to match the subject—printed the pages, then decorated the pages with water colors, silk screen, découpage or all three. She created large artist’s books and books in miniature. Several of her books took her years.[75]\n\nThrough Ritchie, Stuart was introduced to prestigious librarians and bibliophiles from San Francisco to Paris.[76] Imprenta Glorias books can be found in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the Huntington Library, J. Paul Getty Museum, the Library of Congress, the Los Angeles Public Library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morgan Library & Museum, the New York Public Library, the Occidental College Library, the Princeton University library, the UCLA Clark Library, the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as private collections.[77] Stuart and Ritchie were together for thirteen years until his death from pancreatic cancer in 1996.[78]\n\nTitanic: 1996-1998[edit] In May 1996, Stuart received a message about a film role: \"A female voice said she was calling from Lightstorm Entertainment...about a movie to be shot on location, maybe Poland...about the Titanic, directed by James Cameron...\" [79] The next afternoon, Cameron’s casting director, Mali Finn, came to Stuart’s house \"…with her assistant, Emily Schweber, who was carrying a video camera... Mali and I talked while Emily filmed us.\"[80] The next morning, Finn brought over James Cameron and his video camera. Stuart wrote, \"I was not the least bit nervous. I knew I would read Old Rose with the sympathy and tenderness that Cameron had intended…\"[81] Five days after Stuart's eighty-sixth birthday, Finn phoned again and asked, “Gloria, how would you like to be Old Rose?”[82]\n\nMost of Stuart’s filming was completed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, over about three weeks in early summer. [83] But the complex movie, events connected with it and the consequences of Stuart’s new status in Hollywood filled the next year. Stuart filmed and made recordings for several documentaries, did more looping and dubbing for Cameron, received offers of scripts. Stuart wrote, \"On April 7, 1997, the publicity blitz for Titanic kicked off… From that point on, the deluge of publicity never stopped.\"[84]\n\nOn December 17, 1997, Stuart was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film.[85] She was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[86]\n\nOn March 8, 1998, the Screen Actors Guild awarded Stuart their Founders Award.[87] Then for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role, Stuart tied with Kim Basinger (L.A. Confidential).[88] For both awards, Stuart received a standing ovation from her peers. [89]\n\nThe following May, People magazine included Stuart on their list of \"The 50 most beautiful people in the World in 1998.\" [90] Also in May, Stuart was guest of honor at the Great Steamboat Race between the Belle of Louisville and the Delta Queen and then was Grand Marshal of the 1998 Kentucky Derby Festival’s Pegasus Parade.[91]\n\nNext, Stuart signed a contract with Little, Brown and Company to write her autobiography, I Just Kept Hoping. Stuart made her debut at The Hollywood Bowl on July 19, 1998 reading the poem, Standing Stone, Paul McCartney’s oratorio for orchestra and chorus.[92]\n\nFinal roles, accolades: 1999-2010[edit] Stuart was asked by the producer and star, Kate Capshaw, to join her cast of The Love Letter (1998), which she filmed in Rockport, Maine.\n\nIn October 1999, Stuart’s native Santa Monica issued a Commendation signed by the mayor recognizing Gloria Stuart \"…for many contributions world-wide and her inspirational message to always keep hoping. Dated this 16th day of October, 1999. Pam O’Connor, Mayor.\"[93] In September, 2000, Stuart unveiled her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. GLORIA STUART inlaid in brass lies in front of the old Pig 'n Whistle. The café opened its doors when Stuart was in high school.[94]\n\nEven though once again reduced to minor roles, Stuart's last two movies were for director Wim Wenders. In 1999 Stuart worked on The Million Dollar Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. In 2004, she appeared in Wenders' Land of Plenty, her final film.\n\nOn June 19, 2010, Stuart was honored by the Screen Actors Guild for her years of service. At a luncheon, she was presented the Ralph Morgan Award by Titanic co-star Frances Fisher.[95] On July 22, 2010, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored Stuart’s career with a program featuring film clips and conversations between Stuart and film historian Leonard Maltin, portrait artist Don Bachardy and David S. Zeidberg, the Avery Director of the Huntington Library.[96] One thousand people filled the Samuel Goldwyn Theater.[97]\n\nFrom the time Stuart was announced in the Titanic cast, she appeared before the camera for interviews on subjects as diverse as Groucho Marx, Shirley Temple, James Whale, horror movies and friends Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy [98]\n\nArt career[edit]\n\nAn example of découpage by Gloria Stuart. After abandoning her acting career in 1945, Stuart went to New York with husband Sheekman—Paramount sent him to see the new play Dream Girl wanting him to adapt it for to screen. A friend took Stuart to the studio of a découpage artist. Drawn to the art form, Stuart thought it could replace acting in her life.[99] With Sheekman's encouragement, she opened a shop on Los Angeles's decorators’ row, named it Décor, Ltd.[100] Stuart created découpaged lamps, mirrors, tables, chests and other one of a kind objets d'art. Over the next four years, her work gained attention and her pieces were carried by Lord & Taylor in New York, Neiman Marcus in Dallas, Bullock’s in Pasadena and Gump’s in San Francisco. But in time, labor involved in \"the fine fine cutting, applying sixteen coats of lacquer\" to every piece[101] and other costs proved prohibitive and Stuart closed her shop.\n\nAfter living in rented spaces for ten years, Stuart and husband Sheekman bought an old craftsman-style house, where she redesigned the interior, supervised the remodeling, designed all the furniture and had it custom made. In the garden, she planned the landscaping, included a green house for orchids and lath house for grafting fruit trees, spent hours on her knees cultivating and planting. In Stuart’s words, “I became a whirling dervish of creative renovation.”[102]\n\nPainting, serigraphy[edit]\n\nOne of Stuart's Watts Towers, January 1972 Early in 1954, visiting Paris, Stuart first saw the Impressionist paintings at the Jeu de Paume museum. As when she first saw découpage, Stuart wanted to do it, too.[103] The Sheekmans were on their way to Italy. At the time, American artists living abroad for at least eighteen months paid no taxes on income earned during the residency.[104] Sheekman was now very successful. In the eight years since returning from New York, he had been on fourteen movies, mostly writing the screenplays. He wanted to try another play.[105] For the next eighteen months, Stuart painted and Sheekman worked on his play.[106]\n\nSheekman's comedy about a sorrowful comic, The Joker, had Tommy Noonan for its star and was booked into The Playhouse Theater in New York to open April 5, 1957. April 1, it was announced the play was terminating a pre-Broadway tour of three-and-one-half weeks in Washington DC and was \"taken off for repairs.\"[107] Repairs were never made.\n\nThen after seven years of working at her easel every day, Stuart was ready to show her paintings. In September, 1961, Victor Hammer gave Stuart a debut one-woman show at his Hammer Galleries in New York.[108] Nearly all of her forty canvases sold.[108] In the following years, Stuart exhibited her primitive-style paintings in many shows, including at the Bianchini Gallery in New York, the Simon Patrich Galleries and The Egg and the Eye in Los Angeles, the Galerie du Jonelle in Palm Springs and the Staircase Gallery in Beverly Hills. Stuart’s paintings are in numerous private collections and the permanent collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of New Mexico (Santa Fe), the Desert Museum of Palm Springs and the Belhaven Museum (Jackson, Mississippi).[109]\n\nStuart had been painting for nearly thirty years when, as she noted in her book, “…the challenges to me of painting as a primitive had been wearing a little thin, and I had become fascinated by the complex art form of serigraphy—silk screening.\" Stuart studied with serigrapher Evelyn Johnson then created vivid serigraphs that are also in private collections.[110]\n\nBonsai artwork[edit]\n\nBonsai called \"French Black Oak Forest\" was created by Gloria Stuart in 1982 after returning from France where she gathered the acorns in the royal forest at Fontainebleau. In the late 1960s, Stuart embraced another art form, the art of bonsai. She took classes from Frank Nagata, colleague of John Naka, a bonsai master in Los Angeles,[111] joined Nagata’s bonsai club, Baiko-En, and became one of the first Anglo members of the California Bonsai Society. Eventually Stuart's collection numbered over one hundred miniature trees.[112] Some of her trees are in the bonsai collection of the Botanical Gardens of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.\n\nLater life and death[edit] Stuart, who was a smoker in her early adult years but quit later in life, was diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 94.[113] Stuart underwent radiation treatment, but in time the cancer returned and Stuart underwent a shorter course of radiation. The malignancy continued to spread, but slowly due to Stuart's age. She lived six years after her initial diagnosis.[114]\n\nOn the day of Stuart’s 100th birthday, James and Suzy Cameron hosted Stuart’s family and friends at the ACE Gallery in Beverly Hills. There Stuart saw many of her paintings and serigraphs, artist’s books, samples of her découpage and trees from her bonsai collection exhibited in the gallery.[115] Stuart’s Baiko-En bonsai club gave her a gala birthday party at the Huntington Library.\n\nStuart died on the afternoon of September 26, 2010 of respiratory failure and lung cancer.[D]\n\nPersonal life[edit] Stuart married twice: first, to Blair Gordon Newell, from 1930-1934; and then to Arthur Sheekman, from 1934 until his death in 1978 of a heart attack. Stuart was partners with artist Ward Ritchie from 1983 until his death of pancreatic cancer in 1996.[78]\n\nStuart was a Democrat.[116] In 1938 as a member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee, Stuart was on the Executive Board of the California State Democratic Committee[117]\n\nStuart was a breast cancer survivor, having been diagnosed in her seventies. She received a lumpectomy followed with radiation.[118] Stuart’s breast cancer did not return.\n\nActivism[edit] While a student at the University of California, Berkeley at age seventeen, Stuart wanted to join the Young Communist League. She wrote, \"I was told it was for the poor and the oppressed. That appealed to me. But membership wasn't open to anyone under eighteen, so I couldn't join.\"[119] In Carmel, she notes that her friendship with muckraker Lincoln Steffens gave her \"...much deeper insight into the abuses of laborers and blue-collar workers and made me ready to work for liberal causes when I got to Hollywood a few years later.\"[119]\n\nIn 1933 after completing The Old Dark House, Stuart was one of the first stars to work toward an actors’ union[120] and was one of thirty-nine new Class A members of the Screen Actors Guild,[121][122] of which she was a founding member.[3] In June, 1936, she helped Paul Muni, Franchot Tone, Ernst Lubitsch, and Oscar Hammerstein II form the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.[117] That same year she and writer Dorothy Parker helped create the League to Support the Spanish Civil War Orphans.[117]\n\nStuart was also an avid environmentalist.[123] \"I belong to ever organization that has to do with saving the environment,\" said Stuart. \"I'm fed up with venal and avaricious forestry people, mining people, oil people, gas people. I think the abuse of the environment is sinful.\"[123]\n\nLegacy[edit] At the time of her death, she had four grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren.\n\nStuart's grandson, Benjamin Stuart Thompson, is working on a documentary, The Secret Life of Old Rose. The film explores Stuart's long acting career as well as her career as an artist, fine printer and bonsai enthusiast.\n\nGloria Stuart's great-granddaughter, Deborah B. Thompson, produced an e-book, Butterfly Summers: A Memoir of Gloria Stuart's Apprentice.[124] Thompson was one of several artists who, over a period of years, assisted Stuart on her masterwork, Gloria Stuart’s Flight of Butterfly Kites. Thompson's observations of Stuart's creative process—and how to print on Stuarts hand press—make it a unique chronicle.\n\nGloria Stuart's paintings are represented by the Papillon Gallery in Los Angeles and I Dated Oppenheimer, her last miniature artist's book, is represented by Lorson's Books and Prints. Pieces of Gloria Stuart's découpage turn up in antique shops occasionally. Studio photographs signed by Gloria Stuart still circulate on the Internet.\n\nFilmography[edit] A few sources include Back Street in Stuart's filmography, stating her performance is uncredited. Since Stuart does not mention the film in her book, since uncredited performances are routinely included in the Internet Movie Database cast lists but Gloria Stuart is not listed in Back Street, this film is not included.\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1932 Street of Women Doris 'Dodo' Baldwin The All-American Ellen Steffens The Old Dark House Margaret Waverton Air Mail Ruth Barnes 1933 Laughter in Hell Lorraine Sweepings Phoebe Private Jones Mary Gregg The Kiss Before the Mirror Lucy Bernsdorf The Girl in 419 Mary Dolan It's Great to Be Alive Dorothy Wilton Secret of the Blue Room Irene von Helldorf The Invisible Man Flora Cranley Roman Scandals Princess Sylvia 1934 Beloved Lucy Tarrant Hausmann I Like It That Way Anne Rogers/Dolly Lavern I'll Tell the World Jane Hamilton The Love Captive Alice Trask Here Comes the Navy Dorothy Gift of Gab Barbara Kelton 1935 Maybe It's Love Bobby Halevy Gold Diggers of 1935 Ann Prentiss Laddie Pamela Pryor Professional Soldier Countess Sonia 1936 The Prisoner of Shark Island Mrs. Peggy Mudd The Crime of Dr. Forbes Ellen Godfrey Poor Little Rich Girl Margaret Allen 36 Hours to Kill Anne Marvis The Girl on the Front Page Joan Langford Wanted!

Her early roles as a performing artist were in plays she produced in her home as a young girl. She was the star of her senior class play at Santa Monica High School in 1927. Attending the University of California, at Berkeley, she continued to perform on the stage. Stuart married and move to Carmel, where she performed in a production of \"The Seagull\" which was transferred to the Pasadena Playhouse in 1932. It was there that talent scouts for both Paramount and Universal saw her. In a famous dispute, the heads of the two studios flipped a coin and Universal won. She played lead roles for director James Whale, including (The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and The Kiss Before the Mirror (1933)). The hard work at the studio estranged her from her first husband (Stuart helped create the Screen Actors Guild). She played the leading lady in Roman Scandals (1933), on the set of which she met her husband Arthur Sheekman. She was dissatisfied with the roles in which she was cast at Universal and played roles in films for other studios. Ultimately, a few years after having her daughter Sylvia (named after the role she was playing when she met Sheekman), she left the cinema and sought roles on the stage in New York. In the 1940s, she opened an art furniture shop where she created decoupage lamps, tables and trays, many of which sold to stars like Judy Garland and others. Later, Stuart took up oil painting and was very prolific, showing and selling her work in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere. Her landscapes of The Watts Towers are on permanent collection at The Los Angeles County Museum. She also took up and mastered the art of bonsai and some of her trees are on permanent collection in the Huntington Library Japanese Garden. When her husband fell ill in the 1970s (he died in 1978), she returned to acting doing a range of television series. In 1982, she returned to the screen appearing in a brief dance scene with Peter O'Toole in My Favorite Year (1982).\n\nAbout this time a friend, she knew half a century earlier in Carmel, who was a master printer, re-entered her life and from him, Stuart learned the craft of fine printing. She established a printing press in her home studio called Imprenta Glorias. where she created a body of fine artist's books. Her greatest book, \"Flight of Butterfly Kites\" is in permanent collection at the J. Paul Getty Museum. Gloria Stuart won a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Oscar-nomination for her performance as the Old Rose in Titanic (1997). In July 2010, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences honored Gloria Stuart with a Centennial Celebration. She was the first such honoree to be living for a centennial. At 100 years of age, she had completed her greatest artist's book with her great-granddaughter working as her apprentice and also her final appearance on film in her grandson's documentary about her, entitled Secret Life of Old Rose: The Art of Gloria Stuart (2012) when she died at home at the age of 100 on September 26, 2010. - IMDb Mini Biography By: secretlifeofoldrose@gmail.com\n\nSpouse (2) Arthur Sheekman (29 July 1934 - 12 January 1978) (his death) (1 child) Blair Gordon Newell (21 June 1930 - 17 May 1934) (divorced) Trivia (28) At age 87, she was the oldest person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award. Chosen by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World (1998). She was the only cast member of Titanic (1997) who was alive at the time of the actual disaster. Stuart lived to be 100 years old, the same age as her character in the film. Titanic (1997) was her second film that featured a doomed ship. One of her early films, Here Comes the Navy (1934), was filmed aboard the USS Arizona. At age 86, she was aged by makeup to play Rose DeWitt Bukater at age 101 in Titanic (1997). However, Stuart did not find this a pleasant experience. Shortened her last name from \"Stewart\" to \"Stuart\" because she thought its six letters balanced perfectly on a theater's marquee with the six letters in \"Gloria\". Her daughter, Sylvia Vaughn (Sheekman) Thompson Park (born June 19, 1935) is a gourmet food writer and has authored several cookbooks. Following her husband's death, she engaged in a 13-year friendship with printer Ward Ritchie, born in 1904. They first met in 1930 when he was best friends with first husband, sculptor Blair Gordon Newell. The two reacquainted in March 1983 and he taught her fine printing. They remained close until his death in 1996. Turned down Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938) because she felt that the material was not to her dramatic acting abilities; however, Darryl F. Zanuck forced her to do the picture, and explained that she would be seen by millions, due to Shirley Temple's popularity. Stuart agreed in a 1998 interview that Zanuck was correct. She has four grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren. Stepdaughter of Fred J. Finch, a Kentucky native who owned a local funeral parlor and held oil leases in Texas. She graduated from Santa Monica High School in 1927 and attended the University of California, Berkeley but dropped out.

In Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935), Stuart played a young woman whose mother pushes her to marry an unlikable rich man, but the young woman falls in love with a poor man. In Titanic (1997), Stuart's character did the very same thing 84 years earlier. Lived directly opposite the house in Brentwood, California where Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman were murdered. Received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6714 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on September 27, 2000. Not to be confused with Gloria Stewart, James Stewart's wife. Although it was rumored that she was buried at several well-known Hollywood cemeteries, Gloria Stuart was cremated and her ashes were distributed, according to her lifelong wishes, in Santa Monica Bay, as family, friends and Titanic (1997) crew and cast members stood on the Santa Monica Pier. Favorite actress of director James Whale, whom she worked with in three films: The Old Dark House (1932), The Kiss Before the Mirror (1933) and The Invisible Man (1933). Had appeared with John Carradine in three films: The Invisible Man (1933), The Prisoner of Shark Island (1936) and The Three Musketeers (1939). While a very young Stuart was appearing in the Pasadena Playhouse, not only was a Paramount casting director there, but also an agent from Universal who was there to see her leading man was also. She received contract offers from both studios but was advised to sign with Universal because it was not a major studio at the time and that would afford her more opportunities. Mother-in-law of television writer Gene Thompson. Was a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild. Helped form the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League in 1936. Personal Quotes (8) When I graduated from Santa Monica High in 1927, I was voted the girl most likely to succeed. I didn't realize it would take so long. Onward and Upward - Avanti! [on her comeback as the elderly Rose in Titanic (1997)] I think that's the important thing. If you're full of love, admiration, appreciation of the beautiful things there are in this life, you have it made, really. And I have it made. [on receiving the Ralph Morgan Award for her years of service] I'm very, very grateful. I've had a wonderful life of giving and sharing. [on celebrating her 100th birthday on July 4, 2010] I would say I don't notice any difference between 100 and, say, 90. You're still frail, feeble and full of you-know-what. [on Claude Rains in The Invisible Man (1933)] Claude Rains was what was known as an actor's actor. No quarter was asked and none given. A scene stealer? Whenever possible, yes. But with James Whale again you didn't worry much. One way or another, you ended up in the position Whale wanted you in. And since Claude spent the entire film wrapped in bandages, you couldn't blame him for trying. [on James Cagney] Cagney was wonderful. Jimmy and I worked together getting the Guild going - he was one of the stalwart liberals then. And that whole Warner Brothers stock company of Irishmen were always having a good time. They were darling men, funny and amusing to be with. [on not signing with Paramount in retrospect during a 1988 interview] I think it would have made all the difference. I might have gone on in films. I think of the ones that started out with me, the same place same station - Bette Davis, Ginger Rogers, Olivia de Havilland. I would have liked to have won an Academy Award, to have acted in one or two of the things they've all done. So that part I regret. But I have to think of what went with it, for them, the many marriages, problems with children, career difficulties - I wouldn't trade any of their lives for mine. I'm very blessed, I think. I've had a happy, fulfilled life.
