        "text": "Son of [father unknown] and [mother unknown]\n\n[sibling(s) unknown]\n\n[children unknown]\n\nProfile last modified 9 Jul 2020 | Created 4 Jul 2020\n\nThis page has been accessed 5,462 times.\n\nBiography\n\nGordon was a sculptor and the first husband of the actress Gloria Stuart.\n\n\"Newell studied at Occidental College in Los Angeles (1924-25), UC Berkeley (1927-28), and then was apprenticed to Ralph Stackpole for work on the San Francisco Stock Exchange (1929-32). He then moved to Los Angeles where he taught at the Chouinard Art School and Occidental College for the remainder of the 1930s. During the years 1965-72 he taught at the Sculpture Center in Monterey.\"[1]\n\nGordon was born in 1905. He was the son of James Blair Newell and Harriet See.\n\nGordon was married to the actress Gloria Stuart 21 June 1930 in Los Angeles.[2]\n\nWedding Plans[3]\n\nThe marriage of Miss Gloria Stuart Finch, senior student at the University, and Blair Gordon Newell, former University man, will take place at 8 o'clock tomorrow night at Santa Monica. About 200 guests will attend the wedding, which will be one of the most eleborate ones of the summer. Miss Finch is well known on the campus in literary and dramatic circles. Her poetry, under the name of Gloria Stuart, has appeared in the Literary Review, the Costard series, and the Literary page of the Californian. She is a member of Mask and Dagger Honor Society, the Thalian Players, and the Little Theater.\n\nNewell is a member of the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity and before coming to the University attended Occidental college. He has achieved some prestige in artistic circles, and has studied sculpture and wood caring under Ralph Stackpole.\n\n\"Gloria wed Blair Gordon Newell, a sculptor; the newlyweds settled in the Artists' Colony of Carmel-by-the-Sea. It was a seemingly idyllic life; Gloria wrote reviews, did interviews and even ran the linotype machine for the local newspaper, The Carmelite, interviewing visiting celebrities like Charlie Chaplin.\"[4]\n\nThey were divorced four years later. \"Gloria Stuart, film star and former University of California co-ed, announced the trial separation she and her husband, Blair Gordon Newell, sculptor, began ten months ago would end in divorce. Her suit will charge incompatibility, she said. They met while they were students at Berkeley and were married June 21, 1930.\"[5] Meanwhile, Blair Gordon Newell decided to divorce; Newell secured a \"quick and easy\" divorced in Juarez on May 17, 1934, and two days later wed one of his art students.\"[6]\n\nAfter his divorced from Gloria Stuart in 1934, he was married to Emilia Bubeshko, one of his art students, 19 May 1934 in Los Angeles, California.[7]\n\nHe was married to Eleanor McPartland 2 August 1966 in Monterey, California.[8]\n\nHe passed away in 1998 at the age of 93.[9][10]\n\nThere's a nice video on YouTube \"Life in the Arts -- Gordon and Gloria,\" in which, Gloria and Gordon talk about their relationship and also their work.
