        "text": "Programmed and notes by Taylor Morales.\n\nPigskin Parade\n\nA football movie with songs! A mix-up leads underdog Texas State to take on mighty Yale University in this Twentieth Century Fox comedy. The film is best remembered today as Judy Garland’s feature debut at age 14. Garland plays a supporting role and sings three songs. Stuart Erwin plays her quarterback brother in an Academy Award–nominated supporting performance. Betty Grable also appears in a small role, but the stars of the show are Patsy Kelly and Jack Haley as a husband-wife coaching team who must defy all odds to bring their team to victory.\n\nDIRECTED BY: David Butler. WRITTEN BY: Harry Tugend, Jack Yellen, William Conselman, Arthur Sheekman, Nat Perrin, Mark Kelly. WITH: Stuart Erwin, Patsy Kelly, Jack Haley, Judy Garland. 1936. 93 min. USA. B&W. English. 35mm. New print courtesy of the Academy Film Archive.\n\nPreceded by\n\nOne-Horse Farmers\n\nIn the early 1930s, filmmaker Hal Roach paired comedic actors Thelma Todd and Patsy Kelly as the female answer to Laurel and Hardy. Todd and Kelly starred in 21 shorts beginning in 1933 until Todd’s untimely death in 1935. In One-Horse Farmers, the two actors purchase a farming plot at Paradise Acres sight unseen and arrive to find their slice of heaven is not what they expected. The land may not be fertile, but this short is fertile ground for sapphic interpretation, with Kelly, who was an out lesbian, sharing a home and even a bed with her costar.\n\nDIRECTED BY: Gus Meins. WITH: Thelma Todd, Patsy Kelly. 1934. 17 min. USA. B&W. English. 35mm. Preserved by the Academy Film Archive.\n\nTwin Triplets\n\nIn this Todd/Kelly short, the duo gets into a variety of comic scrapes as they try to sell a bogus story to a newspaper about newly born sextuplets.\n\nDIRECTED BY: William H. Terhune. WITH: Thelma Todd, Patsy Kelly. 1935. 19 min. USA. B&W. English. 35mm. Preserved by The Packard Humanities Institute in collaboration with the UCLA Film & Television Archive.\n\nAcademy Museum film programming generously funded by the Richard Roth Foundation.\n\nExplore our current quarterly print Film Calendar and browse the archive."
