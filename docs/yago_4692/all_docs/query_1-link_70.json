It was her casting in Roman Scandals that resulted in her estrangement from her then-husband Blair Newell, a sculptor, and her marriage to one of the film’s screenwriters Arthur Sheekman, friend to, and frequent writer for, Groucho Marx. The two remained together until his death in 1979.\n\nHere she is in a scene with Eva Moore from The Old Dark House including the obligatory pre-code gratuitous stripping scene:\n\nP.S. I’m just kidding when I say “to hell with Titanic.” I actually love that movie!\n\nTo find out more about the history of show business, consult No Applause, Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous, available at Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and wherever nutty books are sold."
