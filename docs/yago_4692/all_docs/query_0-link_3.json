She was initially known for her roles as a contract player in the 1930s and 1940s, though she would garner widespread fame later in life for her critically acclaimed role in James Cameron's Titanic (1997). Her accolades include a Screen Actors Guild Award, one Academy Award nomination, and one Golden Globe nomination.\" She also became an accomplished artist as a painter and sculptor.[1]\n\nGloria was born 4 July 1910 in Santa Monica, California, the daughter of Frank Stewart and Alice Vaughn Diedrick. (Gloria later changed the spelling of her last name.) When she was 9 years old, her father was fatally injured when hit by a car. She hadn't been given a middle name at birth, so sometimes she adopted one. She often used Frances, the feminine name of her father Frank.\n\nShe attended the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in drama and philosophy, but dropped out her junior year to marry her first husband.\n\nShe was married twice. Her first husband was the sculptor Blair Gordon Newell, whom she married 21 June 1930 in Los Angeles.[2] The were divorced four years later. \"Gloria Stuart, film star and former University of California co-ed, announced the trial separation she and her husband, Blair Gordon Newell, sculptor, began ten months ago would end in divorce. Her suit will charge incompatibility, she said. They met while they were students at Berkeley and were married June 21, 1930.\"[3]\n\nHer second husband was screenwriter Arthur Sheekman, whom she married 28 July 1934 in Ague, Mexico. \"Gloria Stuart Weds in Mexico: The film star, formerly the wife of Gordon Newell, sculptor, and her husband, Arthur Sheekman, scenario writer, whom she married recently in Agua Caliente, at the studio in Hollywood where she is appearing in a picture.\" (See photo at bottom right.)[4] They were married until his death in 1978.\n\nShe returned to acting in the mid-1970s, appearing on television. In the late 1990s, director James Cameron cast her in the multi-million-dollar epic \"Titanic,\" for which she was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Golden Globe, and an Oscar nomination.\n\nGloria was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1984. She had surgery and radiation to treat it, and it did not return. Twenty years later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer. She had radiation, but slowly over time the cancer returned, and the malignancy spread. She lived six years after her diagnosis.\n\nOn the day of Gloria's 100th birthday, Titanic directer James Cameron and his wife Suzy hosted her birthday party at the ACE Art Gallery in Beverly Hills. Gloria saw many of her paintings and works there.\n\nSadly, 12 weeks later, Gloria passed away on 26 September 2010 in Beverly Hills at the age of 100.[5] She had four grandchildren, and twelve great grandchildren.\n\nObituary:[6]\n\nLOS ANGELES - Gloria Stuart, a 1930s Hollywood leading lady whose first significant role in nearly 60 years - as the centenarian survivor of the Titanic in James Cameron's 1997 Oscar winning film about the ill-fated ocean liner - earned her an Academy Award nomination, has died. She was 100.\n\nStuart, a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild who later became an accomplished painter, died Sunday night at her West Los Angeles home, her family said.\n\nStuart had been diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago.\n\nThe actress, who was born July 4, 1910, was honored with an \"Academy Centennial Celebration With Gloria Stuart\" at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills in July.\n\nAs a glamorous blond actress under contract to Universal Studios and 20th Century Fox in the 1930s, Stuart appeared opposite Claude Rains in James Whale's \"The Invisible Man\" and with Warner Baxter in John Ford's \"The Prisoner of Shark Island.\"\n\nSources\n\n↑ Gloria Stuart on Wikipedia.\n\n↑ \"California, County Marriages, 1850-1952,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K8N1-9LT : 8 December 2017), Blair Gordon Newell and Gloria Stewart Finch, 21 Jun 1930; citing Los Angeles, California, United States, county courthouses, California; FHL microfilm 2,074,794.\n\n↑ Jersey Journal, Friday, May 11, 1934, Jersey City, NJ, page 21.\n\n↑ Houston Chronicle, Friday, August 3, 1934, Houston, TX, page 24.\n\n↑ Find a Grave Memorial for Gloria Stuart.\n\n↑ Leader, The () , obit for Gloria Stuart - 'Titanic' actress Stuart dies at 100, GenealogyBank.com (https://www.genealogybank.com/doc/obituaries/obit/1328D2680AB9D1B0-1328D2680AB9D1B0 : accessed 4 July 2020).\n\nMemorial: Find a Grave (has image)\n\nFind A Grave: Memorial #59290950 (accessed 15 October 2022)\n\nMemorial page for Gloria Stuart Famous memorial (4 Jul 1910-26 Sep 2010); Maintained by Find a Grave.
