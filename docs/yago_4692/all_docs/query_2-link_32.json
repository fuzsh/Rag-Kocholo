        "text": "MARRIED\n\nJohnny Knoxville, 39, wed longtime girlfriend Naomi Nelson on Sept. 24 in L.A. They have a 10-month-old son, Rocko Akira. Knoxville also has a teenage daughter with ex-wife Melanie Lynn Clapp….Bones star Emily Deschanel, 33, and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia writer-actor David Hornsby tied the knot Sept. 25 in L.A.\n\nENGAGED\n\nInception actor Tom Hardy, 33, plans to wed British actress Charlotte Riley, 28. The pair met last year while shooting a British TV adaptation of Wuthering Heights.\n\nSPLITS\n\nGeorge Lopez, 49, and his wife, Ann, announced on Sept. 27 that they are ending their 17-year marriage….On Sept. 16, Heart singer-guitarist Nancy Wilson, 56, filed for divorce from her husband of 24 years, director Cameron Crowe, 53, citing irreconcilable differences. Wilson is seeking joint custody of the couple’s 10-year-old twin sons, William and Curtis.\n\nEXIT\n\nMax Weinberg, 59, announced that he won’t be joining Conan O’Brien’s TBS late-night show, Conan, when it debuts on TBS Nov. 8. Jimmy Vivino, 55, who played guitar and keyboards on O’Brien’s NBC shows, will lead the band.\n\nINVESTIGATION\n\nOn Sept. 27, police in Lehi, Utah, announced they’d begun an investigation for a possible felony charge of bigamy against the stars of TLC’s polygamist docuseries, Sister Wives. Kody Brown, 42, and his four wives, Meri, Janelle, Christine, and Robyn, have 13 children and three stepchildren together. A spokesperson said TLC had no comment.\n\nSURGERY\n\nThe Celebrity Apprentice winner Bret Michaels, 47, revealed he will undergo surgery in January to repair a hole in his heart. In April, the rocker had an emergency appendectomy, followed by a brain hemorrhage.\n\nUPDATE\n\nLindsay Lohan, 24, spent Sept. 24 in a Lynwood, Calif., correctional facility after failing a drug test, allegedly in violation of her probation stemming from a 2007 conviction for driving under the influence. She posted $300,000 in bail and was released the same day. Lohan is due back in court on Oct. 22.\n\nDEATHS\n\nRalph Vicinanza, longtime friend and literary agent of EW columnist Stephen King, died Sept. 25 in Old Brookville, N.Y. He was 60….Screenwriter and producer Irving Ravetch, 89, died Sept. 19 of pneumonia in L.A. He and wife Harriet Frank Jr. co-wrote the Oscar-nominated scripts for 1963’s Hud and 1979’s Norma Rae. — With additional reporting by Jennifer Boeth\n\nBIRTHDAYS\n\nGwen Stefani, 41\n\nOct. 3\n\nRussell Simmons, 53\n\nOct. 4\n\nKate Winslet, 35\n\nOct. 5\n\nMatt Damon, 40\n\nOct. 8\n\nMario Lopez, 37\n\nOct. 10\n\nGloria Stuart, a contract player for Universal and Fox in the 1930s who had an unlikely career revival at age 87 in James Cameron’s 1997 blockbuster Titanic, died Sept. 26 in her L.A. home years after being treated for lung cancer. She was 100. Stuart, who starred in the 1933 version of The Invisible Man, earned an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress as the elderly Rose, the Titanic survivor played in extended flashbacks by fellow nominee Kate Winslet. Cameron approached Stuart after watching her in the 1932 horror film The Old Dark House. ”He wanted someone who could be aged to 101 without much trouble and still remember her lines and stand up straight,” Stuart told EW in 1998. ”Titanic is every bit as great as I thought it would be.” — BW\n\nEddie Fisher (1928-2010)\n\nThanks to hits like ”Thinking of You,” Eddie Fisher was one of the biggest pop idols of the 1950s, and he capitalized on his fame with a pair of TV variety shows. But Fisher, who died Sept. 22 at 82 in Berkeley, Calif., due to complications from hip surgery, is perhaps best remembered as a pre-Brad Pitt tabloid sensation. In 1959, he left his movie-star wife Debbie Reynolds — with whom he had two kids, Todd and future Star Wars icon Carrie — for the recently widowed Elizabeth Taylor, who had been married to Fisher’s friend, producer Mike Todd. (In the wake of the scandal, NBC canceled The Eddie Fisher Show.) After his five-year marriage to Taylor, Fisher wed Connie Stevens, with whom he had two more children, actresses Joely and Tricia Leigh Fisher. — BW"
