        "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif. - Yes, Gloria Stuart has slowed down and uses a cane these days - she\n\nis\n\n100, after all - but the legendary actress is still stunningly beautiful, witty and impishly charming.\n\nTonight she will be honored with an \"Academy Centennial Celebration With Gloria Stuart\" at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater, in Beverly Hills. Every year, the Academy of Arts and Sciences presents centennial tributes to actors, directors, composers and other noted individuals from the world of cinema. The evenings usually are composed of clips, screenings and reminiscences from family, co-workers and friends because the subject being feted has long since died.\n\nStuart, who turned 100 on July 4, is delighted to be around for her own tribute.\n\n\"Isn't it wonderful,\" Stuart said, her blue eyes sparkling. \"I have waited a long time.\"\n\n\"It's rare to see somebody who has had the whole experience of being discovered, getting the studio contract and working in the studio system and making so many films in the 1930s and '40s,\" Academy programmer Ellen Harrington said. \"Then she goes on and becomes a very accomplished book artist and printer, and then comes back and gets an Oscar nomination at 87 for 'Titanic.' \"\n\nStuart is excited by the Academy event, which will include film clips from several of her films, including 1932's \"The Old Dark House,\" which she made for James Whale; 1936's \"The Prisoner of Shark Island,\" for director John Ford; 1938's \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,\" which starred Shirley Temple; 1982's \"My Favorite Year,\" in which she dances with Peter O'Toole; and, of course, \"Titanic,\" in which she played Old Rose, the 85-year-old survivor of the 1912 ocean liner disaster.\n\nBesides chatting onstage with her friend, film historian and critic Leonard Maltin, Stuart's celebration will feature several of her paintings on view in the theater's lobby as well as the second floor, and the artist's books she has written, printed, pressed and bound. Several of her limited edition artist's books are in the Metropolitan Museum, the Library of Congress, the Getty and the Huntington.\n\nA few days after her birthday celebration on July 4 at the ACE Gallery, in Beverly Hills, thrown by \"Titanic\" director James Cameron and his wife, Suzy Amis (she played Rose's granddaughter in the film), Stuart is holding court in the dining area of her home. Grandson Benjamin and great-granddaughter Deborah are bringing in gifts. Deborah, a senior at Brandeis, sits in during the interview not only to listen to her stories but to make herself available to \"Great Gloria,\" as Deborah calls her, if she needs help remembering.\n\nBorn in Santa Monica, Stuart attended the University of California-Berkeley, where she began acting on stage. She was discovered by Universal at the Pasadena Playhouse. After making her film debut in 1932's \"Street of Women,\" Stuart appeared in such films as Whale's \"Old Dark House\" and 1933's \"The Invisible Man\"; 1933's \"Roman Scandals,\" with Eddie Cantor; \"Golddiggers of 1935,\" opposite Dick Powell; and even 1939's \"The Three Musketeers,\" with the comedy team of the Ritz Brothers.\n\nMarried to second husband Arthur Sheekman, who wrote for the Marx Brothers, in 1934, she began a second career in the fine arts in the 1940s. She slowly started working again in small parts in the 1970s. With \"Titanic,\" she became the oldest person nominated for an acting Oscar.\n\nGrowing up, she said, \"I wanted acting the most. I was not thinking of being an artist; only an actress and the best actress in the world. Everything I did contributed to it - the exercise, the dieting, the reading, the practicing.\"\n\nStuart said that she thanks Cameron every night for giving her the role in \"Titanic.\"\n\n\"It was a ball,\" she said of making the film. \"The people, including Mr. Cameron, were extremely bright and extremely finished.\"\n\nStuart has written a number of books, including her latest about famed scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, whom she dated when she was a young student at Berkeley in the late 1920s."
