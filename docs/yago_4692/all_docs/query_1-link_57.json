        "text": "Gloria Stuart was a leading lady in Hollywood in the 1930s who earned an Academy Award nomination for her first significant role in nearly 60 years - as Old Rose, the centenarian survivor of the Titanic in James Cameron's 1997 film.\n\nAs a glamorous blonde actress in the 1930s, Stuart appeared in a range of films but mostly played what she later dismissed as ''stupid parts with nothing to do'' - ''girl reporter, girl detective, girl nurse'' - and ''it became increasingly evident to me I wasn't going to get to be a big star''.\n\nShe appeared in only four films in the 1940s and retired in 1946. From 1975 to 1988, she had minor roles on TV and in movies, but Titanic changed everything.\n\nIn Gloria Stuart: I Just Kept Hoping, her 1999 autobiography, Stuart said that after reading the script, ''I knew the role I had wanted and waited for all these many years had arrived! I could taste the role of Old Rose!'' At 87, Stuart became the oldest actress to be nominated for an Academy Award. She also won a Screen Actors Guild award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a supporting role.\n\nShe was swamped with fan mail and interview requests and recognised in the supermarket. Her old films resurfaced on TV. The magazine People named her one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world and in 2000 she was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nGloria Stewart was born in Santa Monica on July 4, 1910. She later changed the spelling of her last name to Stuart, reasoning that it would balance perfectly on a theatre marquee with the six letters in ''Gloria''.\n\nWhile attending the University of California at Berkeley she met a young sculptor, Gordon Newell. They married in 1930. In 1932 she signed a seven-year contract with Universal Studios.\n\nStuart joined union activities in the 1930s and helped to form the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League in 1936 and to organise the League to Support the Spanish War Orphans. She also became a member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee and was on the executive board of the California State Democratic Committee.\n\nIn 1934, after divorce from Newell, she married the screenwriter Arthur Sheekman."
