        "text": "June 25, 2020\n\nGloria Stuart appeared briefly in movies in the 1930s. She had a seven year contract with Universal and made movies like The Old Dark House, Roman Scandals and Gold Diggers of 1935. Then she decided to have a baby, travel around the world, and by the time she tried to get back into acting, both on the stage and in the movies, the war changed the climate significantly and she didn't have as much success.\n\nIt is shocking to me that she and her husband left their four-year-old daughter with her grandmother for months while they gallivanted around the world, spending every dime they had and then some, and then were shocked when they got back to the US that grandma expected them to take their daughter back. There are many times she comes off as self-centered and shallow, this being the most prominent.\n\nThe storytelling jumps around all over the place. It is hard to tell what year of her life she is talking about. She dabbled in art, being a mother and a homemaker, taking acting jobs here and there. There are lots of opportunities to Google names. Stuart was affiliated with many people in the art and film industry, and many of the names are auxiliary players, not stars.\n\nThe Titanic period is relatively short compared to the rest of her life, but it was an important one. Unfortunately, her preoccupation with buzz that she might win an Oscar confirmed my perception of her as someone I probably wouldn't have liked very much.\n\n#classicfilmreading\n\nFebruary 26, 2018\n\nI loved this book. I read a LOT of bios/autobios/memoirs of show business people, and this was one of my favorites.\n\nAll I knew about Ms Stuart was her role in \"Titanic\" and the fact that she'd been a B-movie actress in the 30s. Not being familiar with any of those movies, I didn't think her book would be all that interesting to me, but I found it fascinating. She lived with her first husband, a sculptor, in Carmel, my favorite place in the world. She lived in many interesting places and was friends with all sorts of actors, writers, and artists, including my favorites, Robert Benchley and Dorothy Parker. Ms Stuart herself became an very accomplished painter and printer after she thought her acting career was over. I don't want to rehash the book, but she was one of the most interesting people I've ever read about, and I loved her positive and conversational style of writing.\n\nApril 7, 2010\n\nThis covers an interesting period of Hollywood and it's written by a woman whose writing I usually admire. Sylvia Thompson, Gloria Stuart's daughter (and my friend's mother) is an amazing food writer. But this book about her mother is kind of smarmy and self-serving, kitschy almost, and not in a good way. I wanted to like it. I like Sylvia Thompson's other writing. This came out after the actress had some new success for the movie Titanic (which I've never seen). She's had an interesting life but the book is trite and cliché. But don't let that put you off trying anything else the writer has written. Her books on food are lovely.\n\nMay 16, 2023\n\nModerately interesting. I loved the first person accounts of life during the early Hollywood era. That was most entertaining. I liked LESS the distasteful personal sharing of the author's living loose at a time period when it was justifiably frowned upon. And she had quite a bit of love for herself which was and is off-putting in anyone. Putting it into a book is a step further in the wrong direction.\n\nAll things considered, Ms. Stuart was a beautiful lady even when she was pushing 100 years old.\n\nMost people who enjoyed the movie Titanic will remember Ms. Stuart as the older version of Rose for which she won an Oscar.\n\nAugust 21, 2022\n\nGloria Stuart had a lifelong dream of being a New York theatre actress. Sadly, this was not to be. In the meantime, she kept herself busy by acting in local theatre, being a Hollywood star for 7 years, being a visual artist for 50 years in the mediums of decoupage, painting, and book arts, being a delegate in the Democratic party, worldwide travel, entertaining, gardening, a 44-year marriage, a child, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and many friendships. A highlight of her life was being nominated for an Academy Award when she was 87. She was an all-around good person, and she was blessed with beauty, intelligence, wit, humility, and resilience. Her autobiography is worth reading due to her long, varied, interesting life and her positive, hopeful attitude.\n\nJuly 29, 2022\n\nNice to read this memoir by Gloria Stuart. I remember seeing her in a couple movies from the 1930s. Seem to disappear with occasional guest stars on Tv to reappear in the very famous movie Titanic as \"Old Rose\" pretty good memoir of her long life.\n\nMarch 17, 2011\n\na good read, although finishing it so soon after the release of Titanic was a bit wonky. I don't know whether she had new insights in the ten years or so following, but that would make a good addition to her life story. It kind of ends up hanging like that all her life has been about getting to be a big star and yet she did so many other things too.\n\nA good read none the less and an interesting person to have lived in Hollywood during it's hayday... most people had no idea that she had been there before Titanic.\n\nthe bits like I found the most captivating were her world travel in 38-39 and living in the garden of allah... what magic!\n\nAugust 2, 2009\n\nThis book is worth reading if only for the very funny Groucho Marx stories. I found the book to be an interesting insight into the \"old\" Hollywood. Not a place you would want to live, but an interesting place to visit."
