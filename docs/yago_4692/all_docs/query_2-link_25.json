        "text": "What is Gloria Stuart's Net Worth?\n\nGloria Stuart was an American actress, painter, singer, activist, and bonsai master who had a net worth of $5 million. Born Gloria Frances Stewart, on July 4, 1910 in Santa Monica, California, she had a glaring Hollywood career even though she made a very long pause from acting of almost thirty years at one point. Stuart made several stage, television, and film appearances, for which she was best remembered. A third-generation Californian, Gloria changed her surname to \"Stuart\" because she said it had a perfect balance with the six letters of her given name. Adventurist by nature, she was still studying drama and philosophy at the University of California when she dropped out in her junior year to marry Blair Gordon Newell. At the time, she acted at the Carmel Playhouse and worked on the Carmel newspaper. Shortly after, Stuart decided to go to Los Angeles where she immediately signed a contract with Universal Studios. Thus, she starred in the movies \"The Old Dark House\" (1932), \"The Kiss Before the Mirror\" (1933) and \"The Invisible Man\" (1933). In 1934 she divorced Blair Gordon Newell and soon married screen writer Arthur Sheekman, with whom stayed together for forty happy years, i.e., until Sheekman died from the effects of Alzheimer on January 12, 1978. They lived in Italy with their daughter Sylvia, where Stuart started to paint."
