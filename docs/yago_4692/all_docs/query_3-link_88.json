        "text": "Actress Gloria Stuart, a leading lady in Hollywood in the 1930s who found modern-day fame playing a shipwreck survivor in the 1997 movie Titanic, has died aged 100.\n\nSylvia Thompson, Stuart's daughter, told the Los Angeles Times that she died on Sunday night (local time) in her home in Los Angeles.\n\nStuart was diagnosed with breast cancer some five years ago, but had survived the disease.\n\n\"She just paid no attention to illness. She was a very strong woman and had other fish to fry,\" Thompson said.\n\nStuart was born on July 4, 1910 in Santa Monica, California.\n\nShe studied drama and philosophy in college before starting her career in theatre and later Hollywood movies.\n\nShe was a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild, the trade union that represents actors and actresses, and was under contract for Universal Studios and 20th Century in the 1930s.\n\nHer early movie roles ranged widely: from star turns in horror flicks such as The Invisible Man; to playing opposite Shirley Temple in Poor Little Rich Girl; and working in director Busby Berkeley's Gold Diggers of 1935.\n\nWhen her studio contract expired in the 1940s, she began to work less and less in films and later took up painting.\n\nStuart retired from film altogether in 1946.\n\nRoughly 30 years later, she returned in TV movies and continued working into the 1980s.\n\nIt was director James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic that returned Stuart to stardom and earned her an Academy Award nomination at age 87 - the oldest actress ever nominated for an Oscar.\n\nShe played 'old Rose', the counterpart of youthful passenger Rose (Kate Winslet) on the doomed ocean liner.\n\nStuart's on-screen story helped frame the shipboard romance between the upper-class young Rose and working man Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio).\n\nIn her 1999 autobiography, Gloria Stuart: I Just Kept Hoping, she wrote about the part.\n\n\"I knew the role I had wanted and waited for all these many years had arrived,\" she said.\n\nAfter Titanic, Stuart worked in a few more films and on television, but nothing would bring her a similar level of fame.\n\nShe was married twice - to Blair Gordon Newell, from whom she was divorced in 1934, and to Arthur Sheekman, to whom she stayed married until he died in 1978."
