        "text": "Arthur Sheekman, a writer, adapter and co‐writer of more than 25 film comedies and musicals, died Thursday at the Berkshire Sanitarium in Santa Monica, Calif., where he had been ill with arteriosclerosis for several years. He was 76 years old and lived in Los Angeles.\n\nMr. Sheekman had long been a close friend of Groucho Marx, who died last August, and had collaborated on such classic Marx Brothers comedies as “Monkey Business” and “Duck Soup.” Mr. Sheekman's wife is Gloria Stuart, the former screen actress.\n\nThe writer's credits included “Kid Millions,” starring Eddie Cantor; “Dimples,” starring Shirley Temple; “Rose of the Rancho,” the screen debut of Gladys Swarthout, the opera star, and “Some Came Running,” starring Frank Sinatra, Shirley MacLaine and Dean Martin.\n\nPraised by Critics\n\nThe scenarist won particular praise by critics of The New York Times for solo adaptations of stage comedies and musials. These included “Blue Skies,” starring Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire with music and lyrics by Irving Berlin; “Dear Ruth,” a wartime comedy, with William Holden and Joan Caulfield; “Mr. Music,” a Bing Crosby success, and “Call Me Madam,” a musical comedy with Ethel Merman.\n\nDespite threats of blacklisting by producers, Mr. Sheekman helped found the Screen Writers Guild in the 1930's. He was a tall, debonair man whom an associate praised yesterday as a witty raconteur and gentlemanly wisecracker.\n\nMr. Sheekman was a reporter on The St. Paul News and then became a columnist and critic on the arts on The Chicago Times.\n\nHe interviewed Groucho, who offered him a screenwriting job in Hollywood.\n\nMr. Sheekman also collaborated on several of the comedian's early books and, in 1967, edited and wrote the introduction to the book “The Groucho Letters: Letters From and to Groucho Marx.”\n\nBesides his wife, Mr. Sheekman's survivors include a daughter, Sylvia Vaughn Thompson, a writer, and four grandchildren."
