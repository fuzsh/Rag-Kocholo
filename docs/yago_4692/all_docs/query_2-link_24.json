        "text": "This article originally was originally published December 20, 1997\n\nThere is a moment in Titanic when Rose, a 101-year-old survivor of the famous shipwreck, looks at herself in an old mirror salvaged from the boat. Time condenses like the genie snaking back into Aladdin's lamp, and suddenly, on the other side of the mirror, we see the young girl who last saw herself there.\n\nIt's a moment Gloria Stuart understands well. The last big role for Ms. Stuart, 87, who plays old Rose to Kate Winslet's youthful incarnation, came in James Whale's 1932 The Old Dark Horse, in which the young, elegant blonde was the leading lady.\n\nBut Ms. Stuart, who was not quite 2 when the Titanic sank off the coast of Newfoundland on April 14 and 15, 1912, claims not to miss those days. By 1939, the largely B-movie supporting roles she was offered were a horror to her.\n\n\"If you have very high ambitions - let's say you want to write the great American novel and you never get published - you get discouraged,\" she says on the phone from her Santa Monica, Calif., home. \"I hated what I was doing.\"\n\nThe cup of those intervening years, including what she calls a \"33-year vacation from acting,\" has overflowed with artistic creations, family and friends.\n\nBut Rose, she realized after a first reading, was the part she had been waiting for all these years.\n\n\"I love Rose, her independence, her spirit, her wanting out of this stale society thing,\" Ms. Stuart says, the thrill palpable in her genteel voice. \"But I think I like the movie even more because of what it says about class consciousness and how the accident should never have happened and will never happen again. And then there's the wonderful Romeo and Juliet story. It's very lovely and sensual.\"\n\nWhen James Cameron's company contacted her, she knew neither the director nor his company. She asked a friend in the business about him and was shocked to discover she was being drafted by the big leagues.\n\nAfter reading for the part, Ms. Stuart combed Variety and the Hollywood Reporter daily from London, where she had gone on vacation, to find out who got the role. The absence of news got to her. Then the realization that she had to have the role made her determined to get back in touch with the director.\n\n\"I wrote him a note on a Friday and said, `Dear Mr. Cameron, I have re-read the script, and the character of Rose is so feisty, I think my reading should have been feistier. I would like the opportunity to read it for you again.' I sent it priority mail. He must have received it on Monday. On Tuesday, the casting director called me and asked if I would like to be Rose. I was so excited. I called everyone I knew.\n\n\"Everyone\" Ms. Stuart knows is a fair-sized crowd, but not as large as everyone she has known. There are the greats she has worked with - John Ford, Busby Berkeley, Shirley Temple (whom she says was truly as precocious and sweet as she seemed; she knew everyone else's lines as well as her own and learned routines such as the famous stair-dancing bit with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson almost instantaneously).\n\nOnstage, where she reveled in work by Moliere, Chekhov, O'Neill and Shakespeare, she starred as Emily opposite Thornton Wilder himself in a production of Our Town. And then there are her marriages, to sculptor Blair Gordon Newellin 1930, divorced in 1934, and Marx Brothers screenwriter Arthur Sheekman, with whom she had her only child, Sylvia, who has since given her four grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.\n\nIt was while she was married to Mr. Sheekman that she gave up acting and started painting. They were visiting their daughter at the Sorbonne in Paris in the 1950s, Ms. Stuart recalls, and she was \"stunned\" at seeing masterpieces in the original she had previously only known as reproductions.\n\nShe went to Genoa, bought an Italian--English dictionary, some paints, a canvas, an easel and a how-to-paint book, \"and I made my debut at Hammer Gallery in New York in 1961.\"\n\nHer paintings and lithographs were exhibited across the United States. Then, when the ailing Mr. Sheekman developed Alzheimer's, Ms. Stuart began to return to small acting jobs in 1974, beginning with My Favorite Year, mainly as a way to \"escape from the house,\" she says.\n\nMr. Sheekman died in 1978. In 1983, a new phase of her life began when she became reacquainted with Ward Ritchie, whom she had actually met 50 years earlier. He was supposed to have been the best man at her first wedding, but went to Paris instead. They were companions until he died of cancer last year.\n\nMr. Ritchie, a master printer, taught her the art of printing very limited editions of museum-quality books, which has since supplanted her passion for painting.\n\nThe role in Titanic pulled her away from printing her seventh book, this one about remembrances of artists such as Robert Mapplethorpe and W.H. Auden, by painter Don Bachardy, companion of the late Christopher Isherwood.\n\nShe illustrates the books, sets the type, hand-inks and hand-prints. The only thing she doesn't do, she says almost apologetically, is bind them.\n\n\"I was 73 when I learned printing. It is a little late to study binding,\" she concedes with a giggle.\n\nMs. Stuart laughs easily and often. California born and bred, she exhibits manners that carry a gracious Southern flavor. She says it's because her mother's family was split with relatives from the South and North, and she favors the Southern influence.\n\nShe remembers being taught that it's not proper to visit someone without a present. Even her great-grandchildren know the rules. They never knock without bringing a flower, usually a rose they have filched from her garden on the way to the door. Once, one of them, upon seeing her, offered her the flower, stammered and called her Great Great Great Gloria instead of Great Grandmother Gloria. She loved it and now has \"Great Gloria\" stationery.\n\nMs. Stuart has had three film offers since shooting Titanic. But as much as she loved the experience - from the shoot in Nova Scotia to the cast (she raves about Ms. Winslet, Bill Paxton and Leonardo DiCaprio) - she has turned down every offer.\n\nOne role, she says, was too violent, another too stupid, and the last too small to warrant leaving behind her beloved book printing. Good thing she still doesn't have an agent. He'd surely scold her.\n\nOf course, even if she did have an agent, she'd probably follow her heart anyway. In an almost eerie way, hers is the story of Rose and the jewel in Titanic all over again.\n\nThe movie opens with a treasure hunter, played by Mr. Paxton, looking for a precious jewel lost on the ship. He tantalizes Rose out of decades of anonymity with a picture of her wearing that diamond. As her memories \"flash back,\" the quest for the jewel resembles the search for Rosebud in Citizen Kane. How people perceive the stone tells you all you need to know about them.\n\nFor Ms. Stuart, like Rose, the meaning of the jewel is clear. It's about looking for treasures, like fame, in all the wrong places. After turning 87 on July 4, she returns to her printing and her family. Her cup is overflowing.\n\nIf something more thrilling comes along, it will have to find her."
