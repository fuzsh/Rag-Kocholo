Gloria Stuart, the actress best known for her role as the elder Rose in one of the biggest films of all time, Titanic, passed away in Los Angeles on Sunday at the age of 100. She had just celebrated her centennial year on July 4.

Before becoming the old lady who famously dropped the “Heart of the Ocean” into the sea, Stuart led a fairly successful film career, starring in a handful of 1930s films including The Invisible Man and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. She retired from acting in the mid-1940s and instead decided to focus on painting, but it wouldn’t be long before the acting bug bit her again.

She returned to her roots, starring in a slew of T.V. movies and working her way up to the role that would nab her an Academy Award nomination with Titanic.

Born and raised in Southern California, Stuart was mired in the Hollywood lifestyle. In addition to her acting, she was a founding member of the Screen Actor’s Guild, was married to screenwriter Arthur Sheekman, and was the oldest person ever to be nominated for an Oscar.

Though she didn’t win the award back in 1998, she did make her mark. She will definitely be long remembered as the beloved, charming character that audiences fell in love with.
