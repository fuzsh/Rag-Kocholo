        "text": "I AM in the FirstNat Standard bank, a space as grey and boring and banal as any high-street bank, and so convincing that I almost reach to take the leaflets from the rack (loans, savings) while the poster offer of mortgages at a mere 4.99 per cent seems almost too good to resist. Except, of course, this isn't a bank, it's a set. And the silver-haired manager and ambitious young female employee running through an annual appraisal in the next room are really actors recording an episode of People Like Us.\n\nPeople like us are ordinary, affable, touchingly optimistic, anxious to please, if woefully lacking in self-awareness. Or they are thwarted, furious, seething with frustration. They are wretchedly married, or hopelessly in love, achingly lonely, living lives of quiet desperation. They are the subjects of a quaint series in the genre we now call 'mockumentary'. The first six episodes for television went out in 1999, each one a half-hour treasure, following the fortunes of people in different lines of work. Now, to the delight of fans who fell for this little oddity, a second series is being screened.\n\nThe format is the same as before, with Chris Langham playing the well-intentioned but witless interviewer Roy Mallard, mostly off-camera, but sometimes as unwitting or unwilling protagonist - biffed with a golf club, called on for his opinion, pressed into service as a stand-in bride at the rehearsal for a wedding you just know isn't going to happen. Mallard supplies a voiceover as plausible and portentous in its tone as it is preposterous in content. 'Lewes's 15,500 population each year spend more on shoes per head than their counterparts in Oldham in half that time,' he might say. And you can't argue with that.\n\nHow the idea ever sold is a mystery. It must have looked like nothing on the page. Just so much desultory conversation, so many ums and ahs and speaking silences (as when a vicar, pressed by Mallard on the matter of his faith, suffers a personal crisis so profound, so devastating, that he goes somewhere beyond speech). But sell it did, thanks to the vision and persistence of the series' creator, writer and now director, John Morton. And it is, for him, a greater vindication than you can possibly imagine.\n\nIn the four years that Morton spent trying to reinvent himself, there was one thing for which he was profoundly thankful. As the dull thud of script hitting doormat became an all-too-familiar sound, and as he became a connoisseur of rejection letters, grateful for the smallest word of encouragement, at least no one said, 'Don't give up the day job.' Because he'd done just that: in an uncharacteristic act of self-belief, in 1990, he had given up a safe career as a teacher. He'd even sold his house and moved into a room in a terrace in Winchester, where he planned to live off his small equity and become a writer.\n\nIt wasn't like Friends, it wasn't even like The Young Ones; there was no sexual tension, no lively engagement with his fellow tenants. People moved in, and people moved on. They had their own jars of Nescafe, their own cartons of milk; they sluiced each other's scurf rings off the bath, and divvied up the phone bills. It was like being 18 again, in all the worst ways.\n\nSo picture him in his lonely room, with no spare cash, no social life, no girlfriend, rattling away at his old Amstrad to which he had taped a salutary message, 'NOTHING WORTHWHILE IS EASY'. The more grim the circumstances for a grown man of 33, 34, 35, 36, after all, the more we can rejoice that it came absolutely good for him. Because John Morton is not only officially a writer now, but an award-winning writer at that, his modest little TV six-parter having picked up all manner of awards. Between them the three radio series and the first TV series have garnered two British Comedy Awards, a Sony Award, a Writers' Guild Award and an RTS award, along with nominations for a third British Comedy Award and a South Bank Show Award.\n\nWhen we first met, in 1999, he was working on a second series of the sitcom Kiss Me Kate, which he co-writes with Langham. For the first half-hour I forgot to switch on my tape-recorder. My ineptitude pleased him no end. It was, he said, a very People Like Us moment. More and more for him, indeed, life seems to imitate People Like Us. Now we are in the film crew's bus, outside Wickes the builders' merchant in Norbiton, Surrey, or some such unlikely place, in a break from working on the show's second series. The typewritten biography of Morton that I have been sent is potted to a degree - as modest as the man himself, a couple of hundred words shot through with self-deprecation. There's no vanity there, no sense that he knows he's good-looking. He speaks a shade hesitantly, and wraps his arms around himself as he recounts his story so far. But you do sense, beneath it all, a kind of resolve. 'I was born in Nottinghamshire, but we moved to Devon when I was 18 months old,' he says. 'I was brought up in a hamlet where the one amenity was - and is - a phone box, so it was very rural.'\n\nHis father was a teacher, his mother a full-time mum. John and his two sisters had 'a very centred childhood'; they attended the local comprehensive, and never went away on holiday because paradise was here at home. It was a limited sort of paradise, mind you: 'Devon is quite a poor county, really, and there's very little culture, apart from agriculture. I had no exposure to the theatre or the arts.'\n\nSomewhat predictably, John followed in his father's footsteps and found himself teaching English to sixth-formers in Winchester. Mr Chips, however, he was not. 'I think I was probably regarded as a safe pair of hands. I wasn't incompetent, and I turned stuff in on time, but I don't imagine I was a life-changer in the way that some teachers are.'\n\nThe only life he changed, then, was his own. 'Every year or two, the principal would have a chat with all his staff, and ask questions which concentrated the mind. One of these was, \"Whose job do you aspire to within the institution?\" And the truthful answer was, \"Nobody's.\" I made up some kind of fudged reply, and thought, well, what does that mean? I was 32 and I realised, I've been teaching for 10 years and no one's going to stop me doing it, so unless I do stop I'll be teaching till I'm 65. I was lucky, in that when I did think carefully about what I wanted to achieve, I had a really specific answer.'\n\n'It was unambiguously a step back. And I didn't get encouragement, as in advice or expertise, although friends and colleagues were kind. There is a Colditz mentality about teaching; there's always the idea that someone might get out, so they were interested in what I was doing as a project, but I think they must have thought that I was mad, because there was no evidence that here was something I could do.\n\n'Most people who know me would not regard me as a confident person at all, but before I'd ever written anything I'd go to the theatre, or watch television or a film, and a particular moment in a drama would go past, and I would think, in a very anoraky way, I kind of understand what they're trying to do and actually they didn't get it quite right - if only they'd just tweaked it. I never felt this in any other area of my life so I figured maybe this does mean something.'\n\n'Never quite \"I'm mad\", but when things went really badly, just, you know, \"I haven't got the energy.\" There's a kind of energy you use when you're trying to will into existence, not just a particular project, but a kind of self for yourself. It's like blowing up a balloon with a hole in it. You're the only person who believes in it, and the only person who is filling it up.'\n\nIt is probably no wonder that at the end of the first year of disappointments he was thoroughly run down, and contracted shingles. After 18 months, his cash was gone and he went back to part-time teaching, worked in a bar, weeded people's herbaceous borders. But he never gave up. 'I suppose I must never have quite lost all belief. There comes a point where it's as far to go back as it is to keep going. After three years I could have gone back to teaching, I could have saved up and got another house, then I would have been back where I started, but that didn't seem a very attractive prospect.'\n\nHe had, he says, 'a kind of scattergun approach', firing off ideas to radio and television. What Morton writes might be called 'gentle comedy' - only don't ever use that phrase when pitching yourself to producers and thrusting young TV execs. 'Gentle comedy' just doesn't blow any wind up their skirts, somehow. God knows how he pitched People Like Us. 'It's true of anything I would write,' he says, 'that it doesn't look very exciting on one side of A4. It's very low-concept. In synopsis form it looks terribly dull and unoriginal.' Still, the first three series were finally aired on radio, and a fourth - a reworking of radio scripts - made for television.\n\nThe series depends in no small way on Langham as Roy Mallard, the bewildered interviewer trying to find sense in a senseless world. 'He is a man out of his time,' explains Morton. 'He belongs in the Fifties and Sixties, and, if People Like Us is a parody of anything, it's a parody of a certain kind of BBCness which overlaps with a certain kind of Englishness: carry on regardless, don't make a fuss, play with a straight bat.'\n\nThe casting by Rachel Freck, with input from Morton, is inspired. 'We have a new cast every week,' he says. 'We could pick a team of talented comic actors, but it would have turned into just another sketch show. So we had to find more than 70 people for the first series, then another 80, and we tried to cast actors who were talented but not yet widely known.' (Verisimilitude, in other words, would not be served if viewers responded, 'Oh, look, it's so-and-so from Casualty.') 'I think what's great about the actors we've got is that they're skilful enough to appear to be completely natural, but are actually really precise. There are people who have comic timing. There are others who are completely naturalistic but don't have the precision. To find actors who have both is fantastic.'\n\nQuite the best piece of casting, however, was of Langham. When the first pilot was accepted for radio, and Morton was back teaching two days a week, he had a call from the producer, Paul Schlesinger, to ask, 'Who do you hear in the main part?' From the start, he had been hearing Langham's 'very Radio 4, deep, rich, sonorous voice', so Morton said, 'Well, someone like Chris Langham.' The hunt was on, then, to find someone like Chris Langham. They saw lots of actors who were nearly right - until someone had the bright idea of asking Langham himself. That Langham shares with Morton a refined sense of timing is one reason why People Like Us is so brilliantly realised. 'I can write something and know exactly what Chris will do with it,' says Morton. 'It's such a lucky break to have that direct connection with a performer.'\n\nIt's a marriage made in heaven. Well, not a marriage, exactly, and here's another happy outcome: 'I got married four years ago,' reveals Morton, 'so it's been the complete makeover. It was someone I met, indirectly, through People Like Us. She's an actress, Helen Atkinson Wood, and the short version of the story is that she phoned me out of the blue. She'd just heard People Like Us on the radio, got my number from the producer, and called to say she liked it. So I said, \"Thanks a lot. Fancy getting married?\" ' There is a longer, more involved version, of course, but this, essentially, is how Blackadder's Mrs Miggins became Mrs Morton.\n\nDespite the success of the first series of People Like Us, there was a wait before a second was commissioned - and then the pressure was really on (when you have knocked out one award-winning series, there is the terrible fear that the second won't, somehow, live up to its promise). 'By the time the second series was commissioned, I'd said yes to co-writing another series of Kiss Me Kate. Then, about a month later, they said, yes, ok, to People Like Us, but they said we have to deliver it by the end of the financial year, 2001. . . It's been a really, really exhausting year.'\n\nWhat next, then? Children? Maybe, but not yet. He's 44, but because he spent 10 years up a cul-de-sac (albeit a pleasant, leafy cul-de-sac) in teaching before going back to a bedsit, you should think of him as early 30s; that's about where his life is in terms of marriage and mortgage.\n\nBoth he and Langham, he says, are 'hopelessly pessimistic' but it is his philosophy always to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. These days he works on a whizzy new computer. He gave up on the outmoded Amstrad, or it gave up on him, but you can bet he'll have that same sticker affixed to his screen: 'NOTHING WORTHWHILE IS EASY.'"
