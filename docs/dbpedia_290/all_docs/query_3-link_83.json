        "text": "National Poetry Competition 2024\n\nEnter your poems here.\n\nThe 2024 National Poetry Competition is now open for entries and closes on 31st October. The competition, run by The Poetry Society, is one of the world’s most prestigious prizes for a single unpublished poem.\n\nWork from poets at every stage of their writing careers is welcome, and the judges read all entries via an anonymised judging process, only discovering the identity of the winner after making their final decision. The competition has recognised previously unpublished newcomers, established names, and emerging talents.\n\nThe National Poetry Competition offers to winners a first prize of £5,000, a second prize of £2,000, a third prize of £1,000 and commendations of £500 each. The top three winners are also published in The Poetry Society’s journal The Poetry Review.\n\nEntry criteria: The competition is open to all writers worldwide aged 18+. Poems must be no longer than 40 lines in length (excluding title), must be the entrant’s own work and not have been previously published. Full rules can be found here.\n\nEntry fees: The first poem submitted £8, subsequent poems in the same submission cost £5 each. Poetry Society members (including those joining at time of submission) get one additional poem free.\n\nJudges\n\nThis year’s judges are Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature Romalyn Ante, Associate Publisher at Carcanet Press John McAuliffe and Forward Prize for Best First Collection winner Stephen Sexton.\n\nStephen Sexton’s first book, If All the World and Love Were Young was the winner of the Forward Prize for Best First Collection in 2019 and the Shine / Strong Award for Best First Collection. He was awarded the E.M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature in 2020. He was the winner of the National Poetry Competition in 2016 and the recipient of an Eric Gregory Award in 2018. Cheryl’s Destinies was published in 2021, and was shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best Collection. He teaches at the Seamus Heaney Centre, Queen’s University, Belfast.\n\nRomalyn Ante FRSL is a Filipino-British poet, essayist, and editor. She was born and bred in Lipa, Philippines. She was 16 years old when her mother – a nurse in the NHS – brought the family to the UK. Her debut collection, Antiemetic for Homesickness (Chatto, 2020), was shortlisted for the Jhalak Prize and longlisted for the Dylan Thomas Prize. She is the co-founding editor of harana poetry, a magazine for poets who write in English as a second or parallel language. She was awarded the Jerwood Compton Poetry Fellowship in 2021-2022, sits on the editorial board for Poetry London magazine, and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Her new collection AGIMAT is forthcoming in September 2024 with Chatto.\n\nJohn McAuliffe’s new book National Theatre (Gallery) will be out in Winter 2024. His other books include a Selected Poems (Gallery, 2021), The Kabul Olympics (Gaĺlery, 2020) and versions of Bosnian poet Igor Klikovac, Stockholm Syndrome (Smith Doorstop, 2018). He is Professor of Poetry at the University of Manchester, where he teaches at the Centre for New Writing, and Associate Publisher at Carcanet Press.\n\nJohn said of judging this year: ‘The National Poetry Competition tests the temperature of poetry every year and I’m looking forward to reading what people are writing now, and to finding suitably brilliant poems to add to this competition’s august backlist.’\n\nRomalyn said: ‘I am honoured to be one of the judges for this year’s National Poetry Competition. Poetry possesses a remarkable capacity to depict and enhance our fragile yet beautiful existence and experiences. I am excited to read the entries from around the world and engage with your brilliant writing and unforgettable voices. I look forward to reading your work for the National Poetry Competition!’\n\nStephen said: ‘The National Poetry Competition transformed my writing life. It gave me encouragement and confidence in my work, but also a sense of permission to experiment and to strive for new forms and ideas and expressions. Not just an honour of the moment, then, but an endorsement for the future too. I am, therefore, thrilled and honoured to share the responsibility of judging this year’s competition and to witness the richnesses and complexities, moods, manners and matters of our language in the contemporary poem. I look forward to reading your work!’\n\nNational Poetry Competition 2023 winners\n\nThe National Poetry Competition 2023 winners were announced on 25th March at Art Workers’ Guild, London.\n\nJudges: Jane Draycott, Will Harris, Clare Pollard Find out more about them here.\n\nThe winners are…\n\n1st Prize\n\nImogen Wade, ‘The Time I Was Mugged In New York City’\n\n2nd Prize\n\nFawzia Muradali Kane, ‘Eric’\n\n3rd Prize\n\nRency Jumaoas Raquid, ‘Like Her’\n\nCommended\n\nAnna Selby, ‘Liberty Caps’\n\nA.V.
