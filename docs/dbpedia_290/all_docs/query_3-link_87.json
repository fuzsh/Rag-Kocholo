        "text": "Mark David might well have been the man for whom the term bon viveur was invented. Wearing equestrian print braces with grey tailored trousers, he cuts a dash as a culinary version of Bertie Wooster. Mark belongs to a venerable tradition of chefs that includes Keith Floyd and Graham Kerr, \"the Galloping Gourmet\": men who with a wine glass in one hand and a bewildering assortment of suspicious-looking seafood in the other are capable of whistling up a dainty fish terrine with effortless elegance.\n\n\"First-rate!\" is the only f-word flying around the kitchen. Professional knives are to be expertly sharpened using a steel, not thrown. His style is a far cry from the testosterone-fuelled culinary soap operas we have been force-fed on television. If his style of cookery appeals as much to you as it does to me, then book a week of his \"Cooking Experience\" classes in Normandy, and demand that Mark David be given his own television series.\n\nI have always looked to find fun in the kitchen, ever since Richard Curtis and Ben Elton created that purveyor of pies, Mrs Miggins, for me to play in Blackadder III. Even before that, my mother - a trained cook and former president of the Siddington WI in Cheshire - produced magical meals from nowhere and made the kitchen fun to be in at the heart of our home. Learning to cook with Mark David is like preparing a great big family meal. So who better to accompany me on his inaugural course in France than my mother?\n\nThis wasn't my first encounter with Mark David. I was already a graduate of Mark's and Annie David's day course at their home in Hadleigh, Suffolk. Mark runs his cooking-experience classes in his customary eccentric way while Annie brings cool glamour and business brains to the party. This consummate double act is now expanding to embrace France.\n\nThe history of how they came to be running a cookery course in a small complex of beautifully restored gîtes in Normandy is a mixture of happenstance and fate. Mrs Margaret Pewter happened to be in the Colchester audience of one of Mark's all-singing, all-dancing shop demonstration routines. The Pewters - a family of chartered surveyors – had recently invested in a rustic farmhouse retreat that their son, Will, a jack of all trades, has lovingly restored.\n\nMark is no newcomer either to France or to happy coincidences. He served his time at the fashionable Fouquet's in Paris, and as commis chef at Walton's Restaurant in Chelsea he ran into and was then recruited by Egon Ronay to become a restaurant and hotel inspector. Robert Carrier made him restaurant manager at Hintlesham Hall in Suffolk - the county in which Mark chose to settle and to set up what has since become one of the country's leading recreational hands-on cookery schools in his own home. Now he's setting up in the Pewters' holiday home business at Le Hamel aux Lauvaux, where the markets of luscious Normandy have become his back garden for sourcing local produce. Normandy is a living larder, so foraging for foodstuffs and dinner ingredients is a key part of what makes a trip like this so rewarding.\n\nI arrived in time for a towering seafood platter lunch in picturesque Honfleur - a favourite subject of the Impressionists. From there we bowled through the coastal landscapes, enjoying views best captured by Boudin and Monet, then swung round the corner on to the salt marsh-flat Cherbourg peninsula. It's rich in historic diversions and there's plenty to see before you tie on your apron: Bayeux and its tapestry; Granville - former home and flower garden inspiration to the perfumier Christian Dior; Magnificent Mont-Saint-Michel erupting out of the plain. And, of course, the white-sand Normandy beaches.\n\nNormandy, peaceful and verdant, feels like somewhere that closed for lunch some time ago and never fully reopened. My mother and I arrived ready to roll up our sleeves and get cooking, but hadn't given a second thought to the people we were just about to meet. But that's where Mark David's conviviality comes in. Any anxieties we might have had about being pitched into the midst of a group of complete strangers were instantly allayed by the warmth of the welcome and the sound of corks being eased out of bottles of chilled Chardonnay. Strangers? What strangers?\n\nTake That & Party was the soundtrack as Nicki, a DJ turned property manager, and I set about preparing \"Queen of fresh rhubarb pudding\". David, a retired engineer, was anything but retiring as he defleshed a loin of pork for roasting. \"The French have no truck with pork fat,\" Mark informed us. \"It's bought by Britain for pork scratchings.\" A snort of derision came from David's wife Mandy, who was busy compiling a palette-cleansing salad with every dew-fresh leaf of foliage that Villedieu market had to offer. ( I wanted to plop a live duckling into my pocket when we went there.)\n\nMy mother, Barbara, confined herself to modestly peeling a bowlful of Pink Lady apples. She could make prizewinning pies in her sleep, but was wide awake to Mark's recipe for caramelised tarte tatin doused with flaming calvados. Nick, a photography enthusiast, put all his professional IT skills into hand-making delicate croissants and brioche while his wife, Jane, and I got to know each other in the best way possible by layering up a gratin dauphinoise potato dish together. Helen, an optician, produced a Pavlova meringue the size of an oven and filled it with soft fresh fruit and a Normandy speciality - crème fraîche. The whole team combined to fillet and poach a vast, fresh turbot, stuffed chickens inside and out with local grown garlic, and created a fish stock out of a clattering collection of crustaceans. Then we put down our tools for a wine-tasting demonstration.\n\nI once surprised Oz Clarke by guessing which was a £5 bottle of wine and which a £50 one on the BBC's Food and Drink show, but the extent of my viticultural expertise is being able to tell the difference between red and white. How was I to know that rosé is made from a red grape with the skin taken off? Not being in the habit of drinking eight different wines one after the other, I was amazed by how markedly different each bottle was in our sample. Granted, there was sniffing, sipping, swilling, spitting with neutralising water and bread in between tastes, but taking time to savour Château La Grande Nove 2006 was a treat. Mark formally introduced Joann, the wine expert, and then continued to talk ten to the dozen. Our giddy group drowned out the dégustation debate with our laughter, but then delighted Joann by emptying his white Renault van of all the sample cases.\n\nFrom dawn to dusk our party became inseparable, and even though we all had individual accommodation nestling around a small swimming pool (our rooms in the converted barns had low oak beams, a cosy wood burner and a well equipped kitchen), we all chose to meet for Nick's croissants and strong coffee in the morning. Rob, an optician from Colchester, seemed like a man who prefers not to be the centre of attention. Unfortunately for him it was his 40th birthday while we were away, and once the party had surprised him with a slightly burnt coffee roulade covered with candles he discovered he was in his element. Whether taking a trip to the neighbouring medieval Abbaye de Hambye, visiting a copper factory at Villedieu, going to a local cider producer's to sample sweet pommeau, or walking barefoot on the beach at Blainville-sur-mer watching the oyster catchers come in at low tide, we did it together.\n\nThe next Normandy Food Experience course takes place from September 16 to 23, at a special price of £1,000 per head, full board (including wine), including travel within France. Other courses (from £1,600 a head) will run next year - dates to be decided. For more information on courses in Britain contact The Cooking Experience (01473 827568; www.cookingexperience.co.uk)"
