        "text": "Our directors\n\nName: Jane Davis, Founder\n\nBio: Jane launched The Reader as a magazine in 1997, developing Shared Reading around the same time, with the aim of opening up great literature to people who need it.\n\nA book/poem/play I’d like to share: Depends who you are but almost everyone might enjoy The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban . Failing that – read Pastoralia by George Saunders or Adam Bede by George Eliot\n\nWhy I work at The Reader: Fewer than 1% of the population study English Literature at University…what a waste of ‘the good stuff’! I founded The Reader because I wanted to make it possible for all kinds of people to enjoy the experiences that great writers had provided for me.\n\nName: Jemma Guerrier, Managing Director\n\nBio: Jemma moved from London to join The Reader (and return to her Merseyside roots) in 2016 after 12 years in the voluntary sector. Since joining The Reader, Jemma has worked alongside The Reader’s Founder Jane Davis on the evolving strategy for the organisation as it developed a national model for Shared Reading and opened The Reader at Calderstones.

Before joining The Reader, Jemma worked in a range of leadership roles in the youth sector, including The Mix, the UK’s leading support service for young people, specialising in fundraising, strategy development and leading through change.\n\nA book/poem/play I’d like to share: My favourite book is Little Women which remains as poignant to me now as it did when I was a teenager. The themes are universal, from friendship to family, gender to bereavement.\n\nWhy I work at The Reader: Because of what Shared Reading helps people create –deep connections, new perspectives and wonderful relationships. The ambition and dedication of our staff and volunteers inspires me, as does a hefty challenge and the constant reminder that I have so much literature to explore. We’ve also shown that by living our value ‘we make new patterns in the world’, we can find new ways to sustain and spread the Shared Reading movement, from The Storybarn to our social enterprises in Liverpool. I’m driven to lead The Reader to find a bigger place in the world because I believe our work is needed now more than ever. It’s a model that could be accessible to everyone, so we have lots more work to do to share it!\n\nName: Katie Clark, Director of Literature\n\nBio: After volunteering with The Reader, Katie joined the staff team in 2006.

She is responsible for ensuring that the creative vision and experience of Shared Reading remains at the root of all we do, driving our organisation forwards.\n\nA book/poem/play I’d like to share: So hard to choose one, but if you could only pick one book, I’d have to say Middlemarch by George Eliot. It contains every emotion of life and is a book I always return to and discover new things each time.\n\nWhy I work at The Reader: I’ve always loved reading, but the first time I witnessed the spark in the eyes of a group member in a shared reading group as they recognised something in a line of a poem, I was hooked. I knew Shared Reading was powerful and I’ve spent most of my adult life working to develop my practice. I’m driven by a desire to see Shared Reading available to everyone and the opportunity to build connection in a world that needs it more than ever.\n\nName: Anton Clarke, Director of Social Enterprise\n\nBio: Launching and leading social enterprises at The Reader at Calderstones, including a new events business, plus IT and site facilities.\n\nA book/poem/play I’d like to share: Candide by Voltaire\n\nWhy I work at The Reader: Life is about finding purpose. Having worked many jobs in many sectors, I was fortunate enough to have an opportunity to work at The Reader back in 2014.
