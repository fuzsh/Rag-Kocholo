Last update Nov. 2021.\n\nLetter from Susan Hampton. [April 2021]\n\nJust been doing some research into my family, my great grandmother was Esther Crabtree and her mother(also called Esther)married George Crabtree and her maiden name was Jackson. She lived at Tanfield mill with her father John Jackson who was the miller there and was the older brother of William Jackson the composer, both born in Masham. John died when he was just 44 and I see from the census that his wife Betty took on the mill with her family.\n\nI see from your site that Johns and Williams father (also John) ran the mill, he’s not on the census records I’ve looked at so perhaps you would know?\n\nWould love to see some old photos if there are any,\n\nKind regards\n\nSusan Hampton\n\nMoray\n\nIf you can help Susan please contact the site.\n\n>br>\n\nLetter from Christine Bowman Nov 2020. Re John Jackson & Beatrice Elder. See report at the bottom of this page.\n\nMy name is Christine Bowman and I’m great granddaughter of John Jackson and his wife Beatrice Elder.\n\nThey did have 5 children, Wilfred (who married Dorothy and had Robert and Alison), Myra (who was mum to my dad Anthony John Bowman), Peter (who married Cath and children Michael and Susan), John (married Yvonne and I believe no children), and son Fred (uncertain who he married but I think ended up living in Australia)\n\nI have a recollection of another family member who was a nurse in the the Rhodesia but I cannot remember the connection to the Jackson’s.\n\nWilf and Dot ran a pub in the Cockermouth area.\n\nJohn had the Fox Inn on the A66, his wife Yvonne had the Bridge Inn at Grinton.\n\nPete lived in Hurworth upon Tees and is buried in the graveyard above the village as is Beatrice and Myra.\n\nI am not sure about the others.\n\nMy father had a painting of Spelderbanks, but am uncertain where it is now as he died in 2014 and his 2nd wife had his remaining personal effects\n\nBeatrice and John (known as Jack) lived in East Cowton and following his death, Beatrice and Myra lived in the same house (in 2 flats) in Darlington, before both living in supported accommodation in Hurworth upon Tees.\n\nHope this helps a little.\n\nThis is first time I’ve found anything regarding the Jackson’s, so I’m quite excited to learn more.\n\nChristine.\n\nIf you can help Christine with her research. Please contact the site.\n\nLetter from Brian Jackson [Nov. 2019]\n\n.I came across your website quite by chance and must say it has been a bit of a revelation.I’m attaching a photo of my grandfather’s (Frederick Jackson) wedding taken 18.8.1919 in Constable Burton.His bride(my grandmother) is Annie nee Tomlin. I can identify the Tomlin side of the family but have never had much information on the Jacksons. I’m pretty sure there’s an Alice Jackson also Harriet so I’m wondering if anyone out there can identify any other Jacksons? It was quite a surprise to see a picture on the website of my great grandparents John Jackson and his wife Jane Elizabeth nee Ake. Also photos of Joseph Lister Jackson and James Jackson. Well done for all your good work! Best wishes Brian Jackson.\n\nSee wedding photo below, If anyone can help Brian please contact the site.\n\nLetter from Barbara Marsden [March 2019]\n\nWilliam Jackson [the musician] was my great grandfather. The family lived at a flour mill in West Tanfield Yorkshire. I am currently reading “life of William of Masham” which has been loaned to me by a cousin. In the book it explains that pregnant ladies in the last few weeks of confinement went to live in Masham which explains why he wasn’t born at home and neither was my grandma Esther Jackson. There is a plaque in Ripon Cathedral about his music which I have seen .\n\nBarbara is also interested in seeing the clock mentioned by Roy Holloway [2010].\n\nLetter [April 2018] from James Jackson of USA with information about George Jackson of Fearby who emigrated to Virginia. He would like more information about George born 1739 in Fearby. Can anyone help.\n\nLetter from Virginia Silvester. March 2018.\n\nI am contacting you about the references on the Grewelthorpe village website to Matthew Jackson.\n\nMy interest arises from the marriage of my ancestor Thomas Wintersgill to Mary Jackson in Masham in 1755. Thomas and Mary spent most of their married life in Colsterdale, where Thomas farmed at Colsterdale Head. Mary’s age at death suggests she was born about 1729/1731.\n\nIn 1798, Matthew Jackson of Swinton died aged 72. His will appointed Thomas Wintersgill as one of his executors and residuary legatee, and bequeathed legacies to the children of Thomas and Mary. Unfortunately, Matthew’s will did not specify his relationship to any of these people. It is very likely that Matthew was the son of Matthew Jackson baptised in Masham in 1725, and this is consistent with the naming in the will of his brothers Thomas (of North Leighton) and Peter (of Healey Cote), and his widowed sister Esther Graham. Esther died in Colsterdale later in 1798. Matthew does not appear to have had any children; in middle age, he married a widow with a son. His will also left a bequest to another Matthew Jackson, a saddler of Masham, no relationship specified. This must be the Matthew Jackson, saddler, who married in Masham in 1792, aged 26, who was baptised in Masham in 1765, the son of Thomas and Elizabeth Jackson of Swinton Mill.\n\nIn theory, Mary could have been the sister of Matthew Jackson 1725-1798, as her probable birth date would fit with those of the other siblings. However, their baptisms are all recorded in the Masham parish registers while Mary’s is not.\n\nMatthew the father of Matthew Jackson farmed at Healey Cote and at Leighton in Masham, and died in 1769. The wills index shows that his will left a legacy to someone of the name Wintersgill, but frustratingly the will itself is missing from the archives. I would dearly love to know if any Jackson researcher had copied the will or made notes from it before its disappearance.\n\nThe Matthew Jackson who died in Grewelthorpe in 1830 was buried in Masham, aged 88. It is possible that he was the son of Thomas Jackson of Warthermarske, bap in Masham in 1744. There were rather a lot of Jacksons in Masham, so I can’t tell if these were definitely related to those I am interested in. However, I have recently been researching the Swinton estate rentals, and it is clear from these that a different Matthew Jackson from the one in Swinton was renting several farms from 1777 until 1801 when the rentals stop. The start date would fit with the date when the Matthew Jackson of Grewelthorpe married Ann Lodge; it seems to have been common for young farmers to take on a tenancy when they married.\n\nI note that Matthew Jackson of Grewelthorpe was living at The Hutts when he died. William Wintersgill, the youngest son of Thomas and Mary, lived for a time at The Reddings, which I believe is in the same area of Grewelthorpe; his 3 eldest children were born there, between 1790 and 1794. Later he returned to Colsterdale, eventually taking over the farm at Colsterdale Head from his father.\n\nI would be most grateful if you could put me in touch with anyone else interested in the multiple Matthew Jacksons living in this area!\n\nVirginia Silvester\n\ncontact Virginia at virginia@dorneyphoto.com\n\nLetter from Michael Devaney. October 2017.\n\nI came across a reference to Matthew and Ann Jackson on the Grewelthorpe website. The question is asked: Do we know any more of Ann Jackson’s ancestry? Ann was related to my ancestor Francis Lodge. who inherited Hornby mill from her. I think Francis was her nephew. Ann left most of her estate to Matthew Wood, the son of her late husband’s half sister. Francis and his sister Elizabeth Potts obtained counsel’s opinion concerning the interpretation of Ann’s intentions as expressed in her will as regards property she did not specifically dispose of. An agreement was eventually reached between the parties – see below.\n\nAnn Lodge married Matthew Jackson in Masham on 11th April 1776. The marriage was witnessed by John Lodge and Thomas Lodge. Ann may well have been the the daughter of John Lodge of Ilton who was baptised on 28th February 1755.There is a record of the burial of a John Lodge on 10th May 1794 aged 87 in the registers for Kirby Malzeard. I have also found the burial in 1805 of Philis Lodge of Hutts, aged 85, in the parish of Kirby Malzeard. Was she the widow of John and the mother of Ann? I don’t have any more information and I wondered whether you or one of your readers might be able to help with my research.\n\nRef: D/X 1556 /18\n\n7 June 1837\n\n(1) Matthew Wood of Grewelthorpe, Yorkshire, yeoman, sole executor of the will of Ann Jackson\n\n(2) Francis Lodge of Hornby Mill, Great Smeaton, Yorkshire, corn miller;\n\nGeorge Potts of Kirkby Fleetham, Yorkshire, labourer and his wife, Elizabeth\n\nAgreement for the division of the residue of the personal property of Ann Jackson deceased, which her will did not dispose of, whereby Hornby Mill becomes the property of Francis Lodge and the leasehold land at Kirkby Malzeard becomes the property of George and Elizabeth Potts provided that (2) set up a fund of £1000 to indemnify (1) against all claims arising from his handling of Ann Jackson’s estate, and pay him £300 to meet his expenses\n\nEndorsed: memoranda acknowledging further payments of £650 and £1400 by (1) to (2) in settlement of the balance of Ann Jackson’s personal estate, 16 January -7 August 1838.\n\nIf anyone has any further information please contact the site.\n\nThanks to Diane Johansen who sent the following information. August 2013.\n\nMy 4 x great grandfather was John BELL who was born in Stokesley in 1760, to Francis BELL and Ann APPLEBY. He had two sons at Middleton on Leven around 1790 before taking over Hornby Mill near Great Smeaton. His one surviving son, James BELL, married Margaret STEPHENSON of Hornby and they had 6 children either at Hornby or Girsby. It would seem that, around 1827, James had returned to Hornby to take over as corn miller and farmer and I wonder at what point Matthew JACKSON of Masham became a creditor to him.\n\nThe London Gazette of 19.2.1830 tells us that James ‘formerly of Hornby, afterwards of Girsby and late of Hornby near North Allerton’ would be appearing at the Court for Insolvent Debtors in York on 15th March 1830. For quite a while I was unable to find out the result of the case as newspapers of that time were unavailable, however, today I was delighted to track down the York Herald for Saturday 20th March 1830 and I found the following:\n\nYork Castle: The following insolvents were brought up on their respective petitions and ordered to be discharged forthwith:\n\nJames BELL late of Hornby near Northallerton, farmer and corn miller, was opposed by Mr BLANCHARD on behalf of Mr Matthew JACKSON of Hutts, near Masham, a creditor to the amount of 1300 pounds but there being nothing fraudulent in the conduct of the insolvent towards his creditors, he was ordered to be discharged forthwith.\n\nI was pleased to learn that James had not been sent to the Debtors’ Prison at York Castle but wondered what happened to the substantial debt!\n\nI then found mention of Matthew Jackson’s death in the York Herald for later that year.9th October 1830.\n\n‘Death of Matthew JACKSON of The Hutts near Masham at a very advanced period of life.’ It would seem, from information on your website, that Matthew and his wife Ann have a headstone at Masham which tells of their great affection for one another. I also note that Matthew was a ‘Gentleman’.\n\nNaturally I am interested to know the next part of the story,as such a large debt could surely not have been repaid within the space of a few months. In order for Matthew to go to the trouble of taking out a summons against James, he must have been aware of his health and age and wanted to sort out his finances, and he must have been frustrated in his attempt to recoup his investment from James. The other thing that I would love to discover is why Matthew JACKSON was prepared to lend such an enormous sum of money to a miller and farmer? I wonder whether he or his wife Ann could have been related to the BELLs. Do we know any more of Ann JACKSON’s ancestry?\n\nAlternatively, family lore tells us of an ancestor who loved ‘wine, women and song’ who lost the family inheritance. I have always wondered whether this could have been James. His father, John, may have known nothing about the loan until it was too late, I suppose. John died in 1836 in Hornby. Perhaps James’ loan had a more interesting history.\n\nIf anyone can add anything to this I should be delighted to try to follow it up.\n\nIf you can add to this information, please contact the site from the link above.\n\nThanks to Kimberley Jackson for information about the Jacksons from Kirklington. Kim would like to hear from other Jackson family researchers.\n\nThanks to Barrie Sharples for information and photos re. the Jacksons of Hackfall Cottage & Farm Grewelthorpe.\n\nInformation about William Jackson the musician of Masham taken from the book “The life of William Jackson” by J.Sutcliffe Smith 1926.\n\nIn 2010.\n\nMr Ron Holloway sent the following message possibly about Wm. Jackson the musician. It’s a long story but I am in posession of a mantle clock with pendulum since about 1940. It has an inscription which reads:- Presented to Mr. ? Jackson by his friends residing in Bedale and the neighbourhood in token of their respect and esteem and their admiration of his talents as a composer of music. 11th. May 1852. If anyone is interested in this clock I would like it returned to the family / or interested parties. If I hear from anyone then I will provide all the information that I have on this matter. Yours sincerely Ron.\n\nThanks to Vicki Jackson for the following.\n\nI hope my bit of information may help someone with their family history.\n\nMy husband is John David Jackson his mother was Mary Ascough and her mother was a Boynton.\n\nMy husbands grandad was John Jackson born about 1871 in Grewelthorpe the family lived in the\n\ncottage next to the pond, We believe he left the village at the age of 12yrs to go to the hiring fair at Masham, where he was hired by a farmer who treated him very well. This farm was between Grewelthorpe and Ripon Some years later he moved with his first wife to Manchester where he became a tenent of one of Lord or Earl Wiltons farms in Blackley, at that time very rural. When his wife died he sent for a second wife from Nosterfields (we think she was a cousin) Her name Dora Jane Boynton, they had 2 sons and one daughter John and Charles Stanley And Clara. Charles is my late father in law. He died 10years ago aged 89yrs. He also had a family with his 1st wife.\n\nCharles married Mary Ascough from Leeds, although the family had connections with Grewelthorpe and West Tanfield. Her grandad or Great grandad had the Bull Pub in Tanfield.\n\nWilliam Jackson is a great great ???? grandad he had the Kings Head Pub in Grewelthorpe. We have a copy of his will he made in 1838.\n\nCharles used to love going back to the village, we took him many times over the years, IJthink it’s time we paid a visit. The Jackson name in our little branch will finish as we had daughters Jane and Andrea both married with familys of their own.\n\nHope this has been of interest to the Jacksons out there!\n\nThanks for Another message from Vicki Jackson, received July 2013.\n\nName: Vicki Jackson\n\nComment: Hi fellow researchers, I have some information on the Jacksons of Grewelthorpe which was taken from Northallerton records office if any Jacksons want to contact me, I will see if I can assist at all. I thought I would just give people out there a huge spelling/transcription error for people who moved out of Grewelthorpe, in the 1800’s a few census forms state Gruelthorpe and have been translated as Trusthorpe!! hope this helps.\n\nLetter from Roy Jackson June 2013.\n\nRe. William Jackson born 1758 Ilton son of Thomas.\n\nThomas was born in apt 1719 died 1800 in Masham I am unable to trace where he was born.\n\nCan anyone help?\n\np s I am related to vicki who has a letter on the web site.\n\nThanks to Carole Dunkley for information about Annie Maria Jackson & family.\n\nLetter from Mathiew Leader in Jan. 2012.\n\nPerhaps there is someone out there who can help him with his research.\n\n“I’m Mathieu Edwin Leader age 19 of Northwich Cheshire.\n\nI was wondering if you could help me in research.\n\nMy maternal great-granddad – Fredrick Charles Jackson – born September 1883, Married 1919 to Gertrude (known as Grace) Gullen Whitehurst (note this was his second marriage – first wife was also called Gertrude), died 16th September 1965 at 44 Northen Grove, West Didsbury, M20.

She was a native of Darlington.\n\nOBITUARY for Bert Jackson. 1880-1948.\n\nAs reported in Ripon Gazette dated 13.5.1948.\n\nBrigadier J.C.D.A.Dalton of 913 North Livingstone Street, Arlington, Virginia USA writes. Many of your readers will have heard with the deepest regret of the death some days ago of Mr. Jackson of The Hutts Cottages, Grewelthorpe. This sad news prompts me to write you this humble tribute to the memory of a man I knew literally all my life and whose warm friendship I am proud to have won. When in 1908 my Father acquired his Yorkshire property, Bert Jackson. was engaged as coachman and from then onwards for 40 years “Jackson” was part and parcel of the family. It would have been as strange for Jackson not to have been there, as it would have been if the bluebells failed to appear in the Gill or the blackbirds ceased their song. He grew and developed with the times and it was a proud day for all of us when he learned to drive the elegant new motor car in 1912 – a museum piece to excite astonishment in these days of sleek streamlined motors. He was gifted in many ways and took a leading part in all the activities of village life and will long be remembered for his undoubted talent for acting and mimicry which always “brought the house down” at entertainments. Nor was his circle limited to the village. In those days my Father was a busy man in local affairs and also enjoyed much hospitality from his neighbours. Jackson always drove him on these occasions and visits.\n\nThe Great War took him for more than 2 years, driving Albion lorries loaded with ammunition through the mud and worse of Flanders. Those were anxious days for all of us, but particularly for his wife, the former Miss May Brown to whom he had been most happily married since 1914. There followed the inter-war period of 20 years during which time Jackson became more and more identified with The Hutts whose spell was cast on him, and he came to love the place dearly. Indeed he, himself took an ever increasing share in the care of the woods, where thousands of fine healthy young trees are now living memorial to his work.\n\nThrough all this time he en-nobled and dignified the word “service” by his devotion to our family, who, in return, trusted and loved him.\n\nhe was a man of deep and tender feelings, and of strong opinions which he would often voice in a downright fashion. The second War brought its inevitable change in his way of life. Gone were the carefree days of motoring, and austerity clamped down on the simplest acts and pleasures. But there was little austerity in Jacksons character. He kept his humour alive and his wit polished. I shall not forget his first words to me at Ripon station when I had 4 days leave following the evacuation from Dunkirk, “You’ve been playing at it all your life, now you’ve got it.” In these latter days also he assumed greater responsibilty in church life, in which he and his wife had always been prominent . There is a temptation as one grows older to conclude that the best lies behind us, and in particular that men and women we have known will not be equalled or excelled by others in the future. I do not think this is true, neither would I wish it were so. Rather do I hope that the rising generation will profit and be inspired by the good qualities of those they have known in their youth and attempt to rise themselves to still greater heights. I shall be a happy Father if my son measures up to the standards of service, loyalty and integrity set by Bert Jackson.\n\nArnold Leslie Jackson. Born 1920.

He and his Mother walked from Tanfield to York and back again. He was inspired by the music. He began to write his own pieces.\n\nIn 1829 at age 14 he became the conductor of a newly formed military band at Masham. He would walk to practice sessions twice a week from Tanfield.\n\nIn 1832 a new church pipe organ was needed in Masham. This was provided by Mr Danby He paid for William to have organ lessons from the organist in Ripon Cathedral and then he appointed William as organist for Masham Church at £30 per annum. William took in pupils to learn music.\n\nIn 1835 he applied for a post in Doncaster Church but he wasn’t appointed.\n\nIn 1839 a Mr Ascough a Tallow Chandler in Masham offered William a partnership in his business. William accepted and moved to Masham.\n\nAlso in this year he published his first musical piece an anthem called “For joy let fertile valleys sing”.\n\nIn 1840 he entered a competition for the Huddersfield Glee Club. He won the 10 guineas first prize. His piece was called “Sisters of the Sea”.\n\nIn 1841 he wrote a song of thanksgiving, a setting of the 103rd psalm.

The family moved to Bradford. he became the organist at St. John’s Church and conductor of the Bradford Old Choral Society.\n\nIn 1858 the Society travelled to London and performed before Queen Victoria and other Royal guests. The Queen spoke to William and they were given supper in the palace. This was the first of a series of concerts in London.\n\nIn the 1861 Bradford census William was described as a Teacher of music, a music seller, a pianoforte dealer and a music seller.\n\nHe was living with his nephew Richard Moore b.1840. Aldborough. A pinoforte tuner. and 5 of his children.\n\nWilliam died in Bradford in 1866. He left a widow and 9 children.

He spent the first part of his life at work in his Father’s flour mill, but early on he showed an aptitude for music, and at the age of 17 he became organist at Masham Parish Church.\n\nIn 1852 he went to Bradford where is partnership with Mr. William Winn he conducted a successful music business. He was the 1st conductor of the Bradford Festival Choral Society.\n\nJackson composed several oratorios- among them “Israel in Babylon” and “Isaiah” – and wrote Psalm tunes, chants and other church music. He wrote too several notable glees, one of which “Sisters by the Sea” was composed on the Cowerby village green. He died on April 15 1866.\n\nThe Jackson family is still represented in Masham. Mr Edmund Jackson is a cousin and Madam Dora Jackson who is well known in Leeds is also a cousin.\n\nThe memorial case stands in the large entrance to Masham Town Hall and is filled with copies of his works and with bills of some of the concerts he gave in Bedale, Wensleydale and Masham Districts between 1856 and 1865. A monument was erected to Mr Jackson in Masham Church Yard some time ago by members of the Bradford Choral Society.\n\nDr. Sutcliffe-Smith of Harrogate presented the key of the case to Mr. Imeson the chairman of Masham Urban Council and member of the North Riding County Council and Mr Imeson unlocked it.

Mr Jackson was the son of J.Jackson of Speldersbank Masham. Reported Killed in action in July 1916. See report below.\n\nThanks to Jane Simpson of the AONB WW1 Project for Nidderdale group who sent us the following details re. John James Jackson and his family. [April 2018].\n\nJohn James Jackson. was born on 7th February 1895 at Fingall near Masham. Parish of Constable Burton. The 2nd son of John Jackson [Farmer] and Jane Ann Wrather. of High Spelderbanks, Masham.\n\nHis Father John was born at Ellington near Masham where his Grandfather Leonard Jackson. traded as a Carpenter.\n\nJohn James & Jane Ann married on 15th January 1887 at St. Pauls Church Healey. At that time Jane’s Father\n\nJames Wrather. farmed at Fearby.\n\nThey had 7 children baptised at Fingall Church.\n\nFred [1887 Pictured above]. John James [1895]. Mary Annie [1890]. Maria Constance [1891]. Eva Caroline [1893]. Leonard Wrather [1897] & Alfred[ 1901].\n\nThe children probably all attended Constable Burton school as Father was Game Keeper on the estate there.\n\nWhen John James was called up he was rejected on health grounds, so he took over his Brother Fred’s role as an Insurance Agent. But on 3rd December 1915 he was attested and put into the Army Reserve. He joined up at Richmond on 27th June 1916, stating his age as 20 yrs and 9 months, working as an Insurance Agent. He served as a Private [Service No.96975] in the 4th Battalion of Durham Light Infantry.\n\nAccording to the Durham Light Infantry history the 4th Batt. remained at Seaham for the duration of the war. It was classed as an Extra Reserve Battalion and used as a source of replacement for the regular battalions. So John would have been sent to the Front. He was reported Missing in Action in July 1916. but was obviously found later.\n\nHis 2 brothers also served. Fred Jackson in the 15th Batt. [Leeds Pals] West Yorkshire Prince of Wales Regiment and he was killed on the Somme on 1st July 1916. He is buried in Serre Road, No.1 Cemetery in France.\n\nLeonard Wrather Jackson as a Gunner in the Royal Garrison Artillery, but thankfully he returned.\n\nFollowing the war John James Jackson was married at Patrick Brompton Church on 29 April 1920.\n\nJohn James Jackson [25] Farmer. son of John [Farmer] of Masham. and Beatrice Elder.\n\nShe was the dau of Thomas Sidgewick Elder a Licensed Victualler & his wife Hannah Cornish Elder.\n\nAt the time they were running the public house in Patrick Brompton. Probably “The Green Tree.” ?\n\nThey had previously run the “Fox & Hounds” in West Burton.\n\nIn the 1939 register it lists John & Beatrice farming at High Spelderbanks rearing sheep, dairy & corn.\n\nIt appears they may have had at least 5 children. This is still being researched.\n\nJohn James died in 1982 aged 87 and Beatrice died in 1994 aged 96. Both deaths registered in the Darlington District.\n\nPlease see letter from Christine Bowman at top of this page. Here is part of it.\n\nMy name is Christine Bowman and I’m great granddaughter of John Jackson and his wife Beatrice Elder.\n\nThey did have 5 children, Wilfred (who married Dorothy and had Robert and Alison), Myra (who was mum to my dad Anthony John Bowman), Peter (who married Cath and children Michael and Susan), John (married Yvonne and I believe no children), and son Fred (uncertain who he married but I think ended up living in Australia)"
