During the same period, she was the only woman on comedy programme \"Radio Active\", where she played Anna Daptor and other roles, and also participated in the televisual equivalent of \"Radio Active\", \"KYTV\". She also appeared in the final episode of \"Joking Apart\" as a morning television presenter. In 2007, she guest-starred in the \"Doctor Who\" audio play \"I.D.\".\n\nShe has been a regular presenter for the Channel 4 series \"Collector's Lot\". She has also made guest appearances on programmes such as \"Call My Bluff\". She holds the record for the highest score in a single episode of \"QI\", with 200 points, gained from one question on the chemistry of exploding custard.\n\nShe is married to writer John Morton.\n\nExternal links\n\n*"
