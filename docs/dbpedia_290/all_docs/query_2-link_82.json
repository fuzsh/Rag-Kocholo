        "text": "Cold Meat Party\n\nIn Cold Meat Party, Alexander plays another fashionable artist and dodgy mother: a Canadian film-maker, one of a group who have come to a Manchester B&B for the funeral of Keith, a writer and the father of her insecure, punkish daughter Nancy (Lowndes). Also present: Marcus (Tierney), a fading rock star who is HIV-positive; and his lover, Brynn (Joseph Millson). The owner of the B&B is Amanda (Bright), who is attracted to Nancy, but is pregnant by Keith. Murray’s fast, abrasive production is an exhibition piece for the versatility of the actors. The older generation were Keith’s friends and lovers in their youth, when there were no responsibilities and sexual identities were the stuff of experiment. Now everybody has obligations, suspicions and vague designs for living, or partly living. An air of sickness hangs over this flash gathering, especially over Dean (Tom Hodgkins), a Conservative politician who is neither gay nor straight.\n\nThis is a brilliantly entertaining group portrait of middle-aged anxiety — tough, raucously funny, never preachy. Who can cure such malaise, and how? Dean thinks he knows, but his is a blood-curdling exit. Yes, the words of Asclepius are harsh after the songs of Aphrodite. You, that way. We — wherever?\n\nJohn Peter Sunday Times March 2003\n\nThis new play by Brad Fraser is being performed in rep with Chekhov's The Seagull at Manchester's Royal Exchange. In my humble opinion Cold Meat Party will be talked about as the more successful of the two.\n\nA group of friends (consisting of a gay pop star, a feminist filmmaker and a homophobic politician among others) meet in a Manchester B&B for the funeral of their recently deceased college friend. They gather to discuss their past, but rose-tinted glasses are not supplied, and each of them is forced to face the fact that success has a sell-by date.\n\nOn hearing this synopsis, you may imagine some badly written farce where characters are forced together with the sole purpose of milking comedy from the stereotypes on offer. It is a credit, then, to Fraser's laugh-out-loud script - full of contemporary references, ranging from the net to sexuality and fame - that quite the opposite is true. This production is a joy to watch, and the pace never lets up as the menagerie of quirky characters struggle to cope with, not only the death of their friend, but also their own empty lives.\n\nColin Tierney's Marcus is a performance of great depth. His playing switches from camp to inner torment without once resorting to over-the-top body language. Geraldine Alexander manages to avoid replaying Eddie from Ab Fab and gives her character a strong pulse, particularly in the scenes with her confused daughter Nancy (a confident Emma Lowndes).\n\nHelen Atkinson Wood brings acidic wit (\"You're heavier than your j-peg!\") as the mystery guest Fritz, while Kellie Bright shines as the down-to-earth, 'seen it all' Northern lass Amanda. Joseph Millson has all the best lines and delivers them with aplomb and expert timing.\n\nIt's only Tom Hodgkins who disappoints. Though adequate as the homophobic politician on the surface, he does not fully convey his character's turbulent inner life - and, even worse, he fails to project his voice during the most pivotal speech.\n\nDirector Braham Murray resists the urge to direct at a farcical pace and, instead, slows it down during the emotional scenes, allowing the actors to paint vivid pictures via Fraser's text.\n\nCold Meat Party serves up a hilarious night out and the feeling that a sequel would be more than welcome."
