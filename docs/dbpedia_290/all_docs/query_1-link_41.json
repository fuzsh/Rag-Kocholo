        "text": "The Eye That Saw Death\n\nLast year The National Edgar Allan Poe Theatre was invited by The Provincetown Tennessee Williams Theatre Festival to adapt for the stage an early and little-known story by Williams, \"The Eye That Saw Death.\" This is the reading and sound design for Poe Theatre's movement-based piece. With themes echoing Poe's story \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" our production of \"The Eye That Saw Death\" was an undeniable hit of the festival. The Poe Theatre has been invited back to Provincetown this year to mount a whole new production, titled \"Flight.\" We'll keep you all up to date as we get closer to our performances. In the meantime, enjoy this theatrically-enhanced reading of \"The Eye that Saw Death,\" performed by the Poe Theatre's own Jennifer Restak, with sound design by Alex Zavistovich.

Auguste Dupin, Poe's brilliant French detective. The story created the detective genre and was the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Adapted for radio by Caroline Bennett and directed by Alex Zavistovich, this live recording features both live and recorded sound effects, with original music and sound design by James D Watson. With the voices of Adam R Adkins, David Hanauer, Jimi Kinstle, Melanie Kurstin, Jennifer Restak, and Alex Zavistovich. The Murders in the Rue Morgue was made possible by the Enoch Pratt Free Library, RavenBeer, DC Dogs, the law offices of Faegre Drinker, the technology company Avaya, LINK Strategic Partners and the Baltimore Office of Promotion and The Arts.

The Bells describes the cycle of adult life, from excitement to joy, to fear and ultimately to the sorrow and somberness of death. Our celebration today features a performance from Baltimore's Charm City Bronze Handbell Ensemble, and concludes with a very special reading of the The Bells by the renowned British actor Helen Atkinson Wood. Founded in 2013 by Artistic Director Beau Lochte, the Charm City Bronze Handbell Ensemble's arrangement of Erik Satie's \"Gymnopedie Number 1\" features a distinctive sound of bells ringing then being submerged in bowls filled with water, creating a dizzying \"bending\" of the pitch. Our featured performance is a reading of The Bells by noted British actor Helen Atkinson Wood. Ms. Wood is an actor and presenter best known for creating the character of Mrs. Miggins, in the classic BBC comedy \"Blackadder.\" A West End stage actor and presenter as well, Helen Atkinson Wood has been twice nominated by the British Comedy Awards as Best Female Comedy Performer. She is also an award-winning travel writer.

This story has been adapted into several international motion pictures (including one as recently as 2008), and was the musical subject of the world-famous progressive rock band The Alan Parsons Project. It is widely applauded as among the first works in American fiction to criticize the poor treatment of the mentally ill in the 1800s. As one of Poe's best-known satirical efforts, the original story is available unedited in audiobook form on a wide range of digital platforms around the world. In 1903, The Theatre du Grand Guignol in Paris produced a gruesome black comedy adaptation of this famous and noteworthy Edgar Allan Poe story, which the author titled, The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether. The stage play was known in France as The System of Doctor Goudron and Professor Plume. We've translated this play from the original French, and adapted it specifically for audio drama (the original title is retained in this recording.) We've called back some of our past season's asylum characters in this one. Can you identify the episodes and any lines from those earlier programs?

First published in 1849, the year of Poe's death, this story has been adapted numerous times, including having been sung by David Bowie in Lou Reed's album \"The Raven.\" In this adaptation, we take a melodramatic and fantastic look at this most unlikely love affair.

In the conclusion of this two-part series, the Author and Toby Dammit stumble upon a mysterious little man in a covered bridge.
