        "text": "Last year The National Edgar Allan Poe Theatre was invited by The Provincetown Tennessee Williams Theatre Festival to adapt for the stage an early and little-known story by Williams, âThe Eye That Saw Death.â This is the reading and sound design for Poe Theatreâs movement-based piece.\n\nWith themes echoing Poeâs story âThe Tell-Tale Heart,â our production of âThe Eye That Saw Deathâ was an undeniable hit of the festival.\n\nThe Poe Theatre has been invited back to Provincetown this year to mount a whole new production, titled âFlight.â Weâll keep you all up to date as we get closer to our performances.\n\nIn the meantime, enjoy this theatrically-enhanced reading of âThe Eye that Saw Death,â performed by the Poe Theatreâs own Jennifer Restak, with sound design by Alex Zavistovich.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nThe Murders in the Rue Morgue\n\nRecorded live at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimoreâs Mount Vernon, The National Edgar Allan Poe Theatre presents Poeâs âThe Murders in the Rue Morgue,â streaming on WYPR just in time for the authorâs 215th Â birthday.\n\nâThe Murders in the Rue Morgueâ introduced readers everywhere to C. Auguste Dupin, Poeâs brilliant French detective. The story created the detective genre and was the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyleâs Sherlock Holmes.\n\nAdapted for radio by Caroline Bennett and directed by Alex Zavistovich, this live recording features both live and recorded sound effects, with original music and sound design by James D Watson. With Â the voices of Â Adam R Adkins, David Hanauer, Jimi Kinstle, Melanie Kurstin, Jennifer Restak, and Alex Zavistovich.\n\nThe Murders in the Rue Morgue was made possible by the Enoch Pratt Free Library, RavenBeer, DC Dogs, the law offices of Faegre Drinker, the technology company Avaya, LINK Strategic Partners and the Baltimore Office of Promotion and The Arts.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nIn this episodeÂ weÂ celebrate the anniversary of PoeâsÂ well-known poem âThe Bells,â written in May 1848 and published posthumously in 1849. The Bells describes the cycle of adult life, from excitement to joy, to fear and ultimately to the sorrow and somberness of death.Our celebration today features a performance from Baltimoreâs Charm City Bronze Handbell Ensemble, and concludes with a very special reading of the The Bells by the renowned British actor Helen Atkinson Wood.Founded in 2013 by Artistic Director Beau Lochte, the Charm City Bronze Handbell Ensembleâs arrangement of Erik Satieâs \"Gymnopedie Number 1\" features a distinctive sound of bells ringing then being submerged in bowls filled with water, creating a dizzying \"bending\" of the pitch.Our featured performance is a reading of The Bells by noted British actor Helen Atkinson Wood. Ms. Wood is an actor and presenter best known for creating the character of Mrs. Miggins, in the classic BBC comedy âBlackadder.â\n\nAÂ West End stage actor and presenter asÂ well, Helen Atkinson Wood has been twice nominated by the British Comedy Awards as Best Female Comedy Performer. She is also an award-winning travel writer.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nSeason One Finale! This story has been adapted into several international motion pictures (including one as recently as 2008), and was the musical subject of the world-famous progressive rock band The Alan Parsons Project. It is widely applauded as among the first works in American fiction to criticize the poor treatment of the mentally ill in the 1800s. As one of Poeâs best-known satirical efforts, the original story is available unedited in audiobook form on a wide range of digital platforms around the world.Â In 1903, The Theatre du Grand Guignol in Paris produced a gruesome black comedy adaptation of this famous and noteworthy Edgar Allan Poe story, which the author titled,Â The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether. The stage play was known in France asÂ The System of Doctor Goudron and Professor Plume. Weâve translated this play from the original French, and adapted it specifically for audio drama (the original title is retained in this recording.)Weâve called back some of our past seasonâs asylum characters in this one. Can you identify the episodes and any lines from those earlier programs?\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nMadeleine Usher is alive, after all. In this episode, we listen back to the story of how she was mistakenly entombed, and how that was the beginning of the end for the Ushers and their ancestral home. Also, Doctor Mallard meets a stranger interested in learning more about the asylum. Only one more episode before this season comes to an end!\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."
