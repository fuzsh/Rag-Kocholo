        "text": "Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the show first being performed live onstage, Britain’s favourite local radio station Radio Active is back once more on a tour of the UK. The original cast including Angus Deayton, Helen Atkinson Wood, Michael Fenton Stevens and Philip Pope reunited in 2016 at the Edinburgh Fringe, and again in 2018, performing some of their classic and best-loved radio scripts, and now they’re back.\n\nBorn out of a small sketch show created during their years in the Oxford Revue, Radio Active was originally written by Deayton and the late Geoffrey Perkins. It continued to grow at a rapid pace, being adapted for BBC Radio 4 where it ran for 7 award-winning series – a total of 53 episodes from 1980 until 1987. The show then transformed into KYTV, the exciting BBC 2 television revival, and now it’s a live stage show!\n\nExpect to be reunited with all of your favourite characters, including long suffering radio host Mike Channel, original foodie Anna Daptor, and the accident-prone Martin Brown, as well as the cast’s original musical creations, responsible for such parody bands as The Hee Bee Gee Bees and Status Quid.\n\nThe Cast:\n\n· Angus Deayton is perhaps best known as the presenter of Have I Got News For You, which he hosted for 23 series, along with Before They Were Famous, numerous New Year’s Eve Shows, and the first 3 series of Hell's Kitchen and Would I Lie To You. He's also starred in Rowan Atkinson’s Stage Show in the West End and on Broadway, and in sitcoms One Foot in the Grave, Pramface and Nighty Night. More recently he's appeared in Waterloo Road and Death In Paradise.\n\n· Michael Fenton Stevens is an English comedian and actor best known for being a founding member of The Hee Bee Gee Bees, as well as performing Spitting Image’s number one hit single The Chicken Song. His television credits include roles in My Family, Coronation Street, Outnumbered, Action Team and Ballot Monkeys and as Sir Henry in Benidorm.\n\n· Helen Atkinson Wood plays the loveable Mrs Miggins, a character created for her by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton in the classic comedy Blackadder The Third. Twice nominated Best Female Comedy Performer by The British Comedy Awards, she made her West End debut in Silly Cow by Ben Elton and now works extensively on stage, radio and television. Helen presented her own ITV series Private Lives and has made guest appearances on QI, Celebrity Pointlessand Have I Got News For You.\n\nPhilip Pope starred in Who Dares Wins and Chelmsford 123, as well as hugely memorable guest appearances in Blackadder and Only Fools and Horses. More recently Philip has appeared in BBC’s The Life of Rock with Brian Pern, C4’s Ballot Monkeys and Benidorm on ITV . As a composer he wrote hit songs for The Hee Bee Gee Bees and Spitting Image (notably The Chicken Song), as well as for TV shows including Not The Nine O’Clock News, Whose Line is it Anyway?, The Fast Show, Harry & Paul, Outnumbered and Yonderland.\n\nClick Here For Radio Active Tour Listings\n\nPicture: Steve Ullathorne"
