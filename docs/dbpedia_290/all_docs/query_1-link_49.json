        "text": "Horses mean more to us than we think. Our concern for the terrified Household Cavalry chargers bolting through central London earlier this year was a reminder. Witnessing the power and beauty of these noble, intelligent creatures stopped us in our tracks and reminded us of our heritage.\n\nBut then, I would say that. I fell in love with them when I was four, was crowned Miss East Cheshire Pony Club as a spirited teenager and, at a time when horses represented a vision of freedom, set my sights on the precarious profession of performing. After a serious riding accident which left me unconscious for three days, kind horses gave me the confidence to get back in the saddle. In my adult life I’ve often found myself airily saying, “I don’t have a therapist, I have a horse!”\n\nNevertheless, when I first heard about the concept of “horse therapy” some years ago, I was sceptical. This is a practice which, though varying from place to place, broadly speaking involves partnering a person with a horse, then performing meditation, breathing exercises, rides and yoga together, using a horse’s natural steadiness and intuition to help their human heal from trauma, for example, or better communicate with their own emotions. What a lot of horse dung, I thought – another silly fad, the glueing of two unrelated words for the sake of adding yet another woo-woo activity to an already bloated wellness industry.\n\nBut, to my surprise, this fad didn’t seem to be going away. Over the years, I started to hear about horse-therapy retreats popping up all over the world – in Andalucia, Costa Rica, the United States, Morocco, Portugal, even in the UK – alongside success stories of the transformative powers of horse therapy. I’ll admit, I was curious.\n\nI did some research and came across Nihi Sumba, a retreat in Indonesia which, this spring, became the first spa in the world to have horses located on site for use in therapy, yoga and meditation. The same primaeval instinct that draws us to horses also draws us to the sea, so this remote island in the Indian Ocean – perched on the edge of wilderness – seemed an ideal place to see what this horse therapy business was all about.\n\nI flew to Bali via Singapore – taking the chance to reset and luxuriate first at the original Raffles Hotel, then its sister property on Bali, which sits proudly above Jimbaran Bay, its elegant villas cascading down the lush hillside to the sea.\n\nI had opted for the newly established Ride and Recharge program, which I was told included one riding lesson, one sunrise or sunset ride, and an experience of swimming with horses. But first, I was invited to experience an “equine connection” down at the retreat’s Sandalwood Stables, where the 17 horses live like kings, able to wander freely on the wild beach of Nihiwatu, only accessible to guests and those from the surrounding villages. With white post and rail fencing and fresh cut grass feed, the horses couldn’t have been happier, and neither could I.\n\nThe next morning began early with a morning yoga session, then (now clad in swimsuit and sarong – an unsettlingly unnatural choice of attire for any horsewoman) I was introduced to a little bay named Cova, and together we trotted off towards the beach and into the surf. A confident sea swimmer, Cova gently rose up onto his hind legs before pushing off into huge breaking waves – and then there we were, me clinging to a felt saddle, Cova wading about in the blue, the wind ruffling our manes. It was the most magical and life-affirming experience I’ve ever had on, or indeed off, a horse. Winston Churchill once said, “The outside of a horse is good for the inside of a man”, and it has never felt more true.\n\nThat evening, guests of the retreat gathered to witness a spectacular sunset Pasola ritual, a celebration of the rice-planting season performed by lance-throwing mounted warriors, versatile horsemen racing small, lively ponies. Like so much at NIHI, this was a fundraiser for the Sumba Foundation, an outfit which supports malarial control, infant nutrition, medical, educational and water projects for thousands throughout the island.\n\nAlready, I was starting to understand what all these “horse therapy” people had been going on about. I realised that, all my life, I had been benefitting from a kind of horse therapy – but here, in the stillness, with the horses able to wander wild, the bond between horse and rider becomes immediately deeper, more equal and instinctive. The synergy between us was magnified, unclouded by the noise of modernity and daily life. With every gesture of trust or vulnerability shown to me by one of the horses, I felt drawn deeper into something transformatively primal.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, all fell quiet. Down below, that magnificent herd of horses were galloping back down the beach. Then, for no particular reason, they stopped, hock high in the waves to gaze as one out at the horizon. It was a moment of pure connection, of synchronised instinct and an overwhelming sense of the natural world and its power.\n\nAnd that, my friend, is horse therapy.\n\nEssentials\n\nHelen Atkinson Wood was a guest of Scott Dunn (020 8682 5400; scottdunn.com), which offers a nine-night Indonesian itinerary from £17,000 per couple, based on two sharing, including four nights at Raffles Bali (on a B&B basis) and five nights at Nihi Sumba (on a full board basis). Return flights from the UK included.\n\nHelen participated in the newly established Ride & Recharge program at Nihi, which caters to riders of all skill levels, and costs from £400 per person, including one riding lesson, a sunrise or sunset ride, and an experience of swimming with horses.\n\nHelen will be performing in two radio plays by Jan Etherington – Conversations From A Long Marriage and The S.H.I.T. Club – with Angus Deayton at The Latitude Festival (July 25-28; latitudefestival.com)"
