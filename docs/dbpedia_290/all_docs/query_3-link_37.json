        "text": "Last updated on the 24 April 2024 by Maeve\n\nMini Biography\n\nBorn: 6 January 1955, Consett, County Durham, England.\n\nRowan Atkinson is best known for his iconic character Mr. Bean, which he created and played in the television series of the same name.\n\nRowan Atkinson attended Newcastle University, where he studied electrical engineering. However, he soon realized that his true passion was comedy, and he began performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 1979, Rowan Atkinson became a regular on the BBC sketch comedy show “Not the Nine O’Clock News,” which helped launch his career. He later starred in the television series “Blackadder,” which was a critical and commercial success.\n\nHowever, it was his creation of the character Mr. Bean that made Atkinson a household name. The character, a bumbling and awkward man-child, first appeared in a television series in 1990 and quickly became a global phenomenon. Atkinson also starred in two feature films as Mr. Bean, which were also successful.\n\nIn addition to his work on television and in film, Atkinson has also appeared in numerous stage productions, including “Oliver!” and “The Sneeze.” He has also lent his voice to several animated films, including “The Lion King” and “Johnny English.”\n\nAtkinson has received numerous awards for his work, including a BAFTA for his performance in “Blackadder” and an International Emmy for “Mr. Bean.” He was also appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2013 for his services to drama and charity.\n\nDespite his success, Atkinson is known for being a private person and rarely gives interviews. He has been married twice and has two children. In his free time, he enjoys collecting cars and is a skilled racing driver.\n\nSuggested viewing\n\nBlackadder Goes Forth (1989)\n\nBftv 9.5 / IMDb 8.8\n\nIn the trenches of World War I, Captain Edmund Blackadder, a cynical and self-serving officer, desperately seeks to escape the horrors of the conflict. Accompanied by his dim-witted servant, Baldrick, and the naive and idealistic Lieutenant George, Blackadder concocts elaborate schemes to avoid going “over the top” into the deadly no-man’s-land. However, his plans are invariably foiled by incompetence, bad luck, and the sheer absurdity of the war, leaving him trapped in the trenches and facing the grim reality of death.\n\nTop cast: Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Tim McInnerny, Gabrielle Glaister, Miranda Richardson, Rik Mayall, Geoffrey Palmer, Jeremy Hardy.\n\nBlackadder II (1986)\n\nBftv 9.0 / IMDb 8.6\n\nIn the Tudor era, Lord Edmund Blackadder finds himself amidst the eccentric court of Queen Elizabeth I, a monarch more concerned with fashion and frivolous pursuits than the affairs of state.

Amidst this comedic rivalry, the police officers grapple with various challenges, from maintaining order in the town to dealing with the eccentricities of their colleagues, creating a series of hilarious mishaps and absurd situations.\n\nTop cast: Rowan Atkinson, Serena Evans, David Haig, James Dreyfus, Mina Anwar, Mark Addy, Rudolph Walker, Kevin Allen.\n\nBean (1997)\n\nBftv 8.0 / IMDb 6.5\n\nWell-meaning yet clumsy and destructive Mr. Bean, a security guard at the Royal National Gallery in London, is set to be fired for his sleepiness and mishaps. However, the chairman’s fondness for Bean prevents his dismissal, and he instead is sent to Los Angeles under false credentials to deliver the painting “Whistler’s Mother” to the Grierson Art Gallery. Bean’s chaos-causing ways continue in America, causing mayhem and hilarity as he navigates the unfamiliar culture and the responsibility of transporting the valuable artwork.\n\nTop cast: Rowan Atkinson, Peter MacNicol, Pamela Reed, Tricia Vessey, Andrew Lawrence, Harris Yulin, Burt Reynolds, Richard Gant, Chris Ellis.\n\nThe Black Adder (1983)\n\nBftv 8.5 / IMDb 8.0\n\nIn the medieval era, Prince Edmund, the Black Adder, navigates the treacherous political landscape of the royal court, constantly scheming to improve his standing and seize the throne.

Despite his clumsiness and lack of competence, Johnny embarks on a mission to thwart the evil plans of Pascal Sauvage, a French prison mogul seeking revenge against the British government. Along the way, Johnny encounters Interpol agent Lorna Campbell, who assists him in his mission while providing a sense of order and competence to his chaotic antics.\n\nTop cast: Rowan Atkinson, Natalie Imbruglia, Ben Miller, John Malkovich, Greg Wise, Tasha de Vasconcelos, Douglas McFerran, Steve Nicholson, Terence Harvey.\n\nBlack Adder The Third (1987)\n\nBftv 9.0 / IMDb 0.0\n\nIn the Regency era, Edmund Blackadder, once a nobleman, now finds himself relegated to the role of a butler to the dim-witted and self-indulgent Prince Regent. Amidst the extravagance and follies of the court, Blackadder’s sharp wit and cynical pragmatism are put to the test as he navigates the Prince’s eccentricities and schemes to maintain his position and escape his servitude. His efforts often lead to comical mishaps and satirical jabs at the excesses and hypocrisies of the ruling class.\n\nTop cast: Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Hugh Laurie, Helen Atkinson Wood, Robbie Coltrane, Hugh Paddick, Miranda Richardson, Stephen Fry, Tim McInnerny, Kenneth Connor, Nigel Planer.\n\nFull filmography (@Wikipedia)"
