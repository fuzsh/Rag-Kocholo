Sadly, Norman passed away in June 2024, and Gemma shared a heartbreaking post on her Instagram page to pay tribute to him, uploading a beautiful video collage of her pooch with the statement: 'My beautiful boy Norman has passed away.\n\n'My heart is broken üòû 12 years ago I made a promise to him that i would always take care of him and never allow him be in pain or to suffer. Had I put off making the hardest decision of my life any longer I would have broken that promise. It‚Äôs hard to put into words how much Norman changed my life and made it so much better Simply by just being there.\n\n'Throughout the good & bad experiences the last 12 years he‚Äôs been there with Ollie making everything ok. My most favourite weekends were spent having long walks exploring together, then home lay in bed cosy with them both watching a film while they snored away peacefully. I think I‚Äôll miss that the most‚Ä¶That and the fact Norm was always the only one in the whole house to get up and come downstairs with me in the mornings no matter how early it was.\n\n'My 5am club won‚Äôt be the same without his company. He was my first experience of being a mum and having someone other than myself to care for. He‚Äôs taught me a lot. Mainly to always live in the moment, remain positive and to keep trying. He never stopped trying to just get up and please me. Even at the end.\n\n'He was the most gentle and caring soul combined with fierce love and loyalty to his family, his pack. I believe he was always meant to be my dog. I feel so sad for Ollie who‚Äôs now wondering where Norman is üòî Smelling him but not being able to see or play with him will be confusing.\n\n'I‚Äôve read that dogs too notice the absence of other dogs, and i know he‚Äôs just as sad as I am. And of course I‚Äôm beyond sad for Mia. Normans woken her up by going into her room and pinching her Snuggie almost everyday of her life. She‚Äôs never known him or Ollie to not be here. Her first best friend. And so close to her 5th Birthday üòî\n\n'They say the sadness we feel when we lose a loved one is the price we pay for loving them so much, and boy did i love you Norman. In all these years the only time you‚Äôve broken my heart is today, when yours stopped beating. I‚Äôm going to love you, miss you and remember you forever. Until we meet again Norman‚Ä¶ Go and run again and have some fun up there with my dad. You‚Äôre such a good boy ‚ù§Ô∏è üêæ üêæ.' (sic)\n\nIs Gemma Atkinson on Instagram?\n\nYes, Gemma is on Instagram as well as other social networks, and she regularly posts photos of her home life with fianc√© Gorka Marquez and little daughter Mia.\n\nIn March 2022, Gemma posted some super cute Instagram Stories showing a photo of some letters she wrote when she was 12-years-old.
