Daughter Hannah married Thomas Hamer and emigrated to New Jersey.\n\nWalter 1832 married Emma Arbon and emigrated to New Zealand 1874.\n\nJoshua 1836 emigrated to New Jersey 1859, married Christiana Bell.\n\nThis chart illustrates the main lines and shows relationships recently confirmed by DNA matches.\n\nSources\n\nThe history of Walter Kelsall (a son of Isaac Kelsall and Sarah Anne Bamford) who settled in New Zealand is documented in A Line of Descent prepared by Ken Kelsall of Western Australia. Ken traveled to England in 1986 to document a line of descent first drawn by his grandfather, Frank McDonald Kelsall following his trip to England in 1923. Ken visited Broughty Ferry, Chester, Kelsall and Dukinfield and obtained info from archives in Chester, St Catherine’s House London, Kew and the College of Arms. He obtained from LDS civil registration records (after 1837) and parish registers for Dukinfield and Ashton under Lyne. Ken recorded births and baptisms that are not found on sites such as Ancestry and Findmypast. Ken’s document was provided to this author by Glenn Kelsall and Sue Toulis.\n\nIn addition to the family of Walter, A line of Descent traces the ancestors of Isaac to William Kelsall born Dukinfield in 1705 and then to Sir Thomas Kelsall, said to be a Royalist banished in the English Civil War. This author has found no other reference to this Sir Thomas.\n\nThe author of A line of Descent, Ken Kelsall (1921 – 2015) was a pioneer in the development of the water industry in Western Australia. During his 51-year career, Ken was involved in the construction of 26 dams in WA.\n\nhttp://ehwa.wikidot.com/people:kelsall-ken\n\nhttps://portal.engineersaustralia.org.au/news/dam-builder-inspiring-leader-and-extraordinary-engineer\n\nA Line of Descent Ken Kelsall\n\nAssistance to the present author was received for descendants in Australia and New Zealand from Glenn Kelsall, Sue Toulis, Karen Colmore Williams, Michelle Hoare, and Debbie Northe. Assistance for the branches in New Jersey was obtained from Suzan Hamer and Deborah Ulrich.\n\nIsaac Kelsall 1792 -1859 and Sarah Ann Bamford\n\nIsaac Kelsall was born 25 March 1792, and baptised 8 April 1792, at Dukinfield Presbyterian Old Chapel, father Joseph, mother Mary.\n\nIsaac married Sarah Ann Bamford, 22 December 1811 at St. Mary, Stockport, Cheshire, England, Isaac Kelsall, bachelor, hatter, and Sarah Bamber (sic), spinster, both of this Parish. Banns? Nov 24, Dec 1 and Dec. 8. From Parish registers of St. Mary’s Church, Stockport and England, Cheshire Parish Registers 1538-2000. [from S. Hamer]\n\nSarah Ann’s name, Bamford (rather than Bamber) appears in multiple later generations. Sarah may be the daughter of John and Mary Bamford baptised at Dukinfield 29 April 1793. If so, she was 18 when she married and continued having children until she was 44.\n\n[From the Fox/Kelsall tree on Ancestry John Bamford (born 1762) married Mary Hoyle 1787 in Rochdale, Lancashire. While there is a record of the marriage of John Bamford and Mary Hoyle in Rochdale. I have not seen any evidence that links this couple to John and Mary in Dukinfield. There is a tree on Ancestry that shows the John Bamford who married Mary Hoyle lived and died in Rochdale. Rochdale and Dukinfield are about 12 miles apart.]\n\nSarah Ann died in 1848 or 1849 before Isaac took a second wife, Mary Ann Taylor 25 March 1850. Isaac and Mary Ann had a child Ann Matilda born in 1850 who married William Norman and later John Simmons Spinks. A newspaper article from 1871 reported that this William Norman was guilty of bigamy when he married Ann Matilda, “his former wife Elizabeth being then alive” and he was sentenced to six months hard labour.\n\nAs documented in various records, Isaac was a hatter in Dukinfield. He died 18 February 1859 from phthisis (tuberculosis) [from Ken Kelsall].\n\n.\n\nChildren of Isaac and Sarah Ann\n\nMary Ann 1813\n\nHannah 1815 married James Bertenshaw\n\nElizabeth 1817 married Henry Shaw\n\nAbel 1820 married Ann Nancy Butterworth and emigrated to New Zealand in 1863\n\nLevina 1823 daughter Sarah Esther Bamford Kelsall\n\nJohn Bamford 1824 married Jane Buckley, emigrated to New Zealand in 1863\n\nMary 1827 married William Hibbert. Daughter Hannah married Thomas Hamer and emigrated to New Jersey\n\nWilliam 1830 died age 11\n\nWalter 1831 married Emma Arbon, emigrated to New Zealand 1874\n\nJoshua 1836 emigrated to New Jersey 1859, married Christiana Bell\n\nJoseph 1837, soldier in Scotland married Robina Fraser\n\nMary Ann 1813\n\nBaptism 1 August 1813 at Dukinfield Independent to Isaac and Sarah Kelsall of Mellor Derbyshire (about 10 miles from Dukinfield). Not found in 1841 and nothing else known.\n\nHannah 1815\n\nBaptised 26 July 1815, Hannah, daughter of Isaac married James Bertenshaw, 22 January 1838 at Ashton under Lyne. But Hannah, 35 unmarried, is at home with Isaac and Sarah in 1851. Probably Hannah Bertenshaw died 1858. No known children.\n\nElizabeth 1817\n\nBaptised 13 July 1817 at Providence Independent Dukinfield. At home with Isaac and Sarah in 1851, employed as cotton weaver. Married Henry Thaw or Shaw 26 November 1848 in Manchester, register shows father Isaac occupation hatter. Residents of Ardwick, a district of Manchester about 6 miles from Dukinfield. Not found in subsequent records.\n\nAbel 1820\n\nBaptised 6 August 1820 at Providence Independent Dukinfield. Married Ann Nancy Butterworth in 1847 and emigrated to New Zealand in 1863. Died 29 October 1875 in Auckland.\n\nIn 1851 Abel and Ann were living in Town Lane Dukinfield with Abel’s uncle Robert Bamford, Abel’s son John, Abel’s sister Levina and Sarah age 5, likely to be Sarah’s daughter. Abel was listed as a coal miner. In 1861 Abel and Ann are again in Town Lane with Abel now head of household. There are no children present.\n\nFrom Find a Grave website, Abel and wife Ann arrived in Auckland, New Zealand aboard the ship “Cairngorm” on 7 January 1863, under Captain Hugh Auld. “She left Gravesend on the 11th September. She was a fine roomy ship of 1161 tons, built at Quebec in 1856. The passengers all arrived in good health”. NEW ZEALANDER, VOLUME XIX, ISSUE 1762, 8 JANUARY 1863, PAGE 2 Maritime Record (Account of voyage). No children are listed on the passenger list.\n\nWife Ann is not mentioned on the headstone at Symonds St. Cemetery, Auckland. Ann died in Auckland in 1900 age 79.\n\nOne child, John, was listed in the 1851 census. John was born 11 March 1849 and baptised 6 January 1850 at Dukinfield. There was also Esther baptised 9 April 1856. As far as this author can tell neither of these children survived to go out to New Zealand. Likely Esther was the Esther who died 1857 in Ashton. There are several records for John Kelsall died in Ashton between 1851 and 1861.\n\nLevina 1823\n\nLevina (also written as Lavinia) appears in the 1841 census living with Robert and Hannah Bamford in Town Lane Dukinfield, the same street as Isaac and family. She is with Robert again in 1851, now identified as Robert’s niece. Also present are Abel Kelsall, a nephew of Robert, John age 2, thought to be the son of Abel, and Sarah thought to be the daughter of Levina. Levina and Sarah are with Betty Bamford in 1861 next door to Robert Bamford. Levina is still with Betty, without Sarah in 1871, 1881 and 1891. Levina died in 1897.\n\nI have not found a baptism for Levina. She is not shown on Ken Kelsall’s line of descent chart (presented below) which suggests Ken also did not find a baptism. It may not be conclusive, but I believe Levina was a daughter of Isaac and Sarah.\n\nLevina had a daughter Sarah Esther Bamford Kelsall christened 10 October 1847 at Ashton under Lyne. Sarah is present with her mother in the census in 1851 and 1861. She married Thomas Seymour in 1866 in Ashton. In 1871 Thomas and Sarah are living in Dukinfield with children Alice Amy and Elizabeth. Thomas was a blacksmith. Sarah Esther Bamford Seymour of Stalybridge died in 1927, with probate to Alice Annie Cooper. From trees on Ancestry Levina could have current descendants, names including Cooper, Marsden, Titterington (see MTSFamily Tree by starmary1 [ST]).\n\nJohn Bamford 1824\n\nBaptised 29 May 1824 at Stalybridge. Married Jane Buckley at Glossop, Derbyshire 7 January 1849. At least 9 children born in England, 1847 to 1861, and at least one son Abel born in New Zealand in 1866. John died 13 October 1887 in Onehunga, Auckland, New Zealand. John took his own life as reported in the Auckland Star, 14 October 1887.\n\nhttps://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS18871014.2.44.\n\nJane died 17 May 1889. Their headstone at St. Peter’s Anglican Cemetery also records their second son Moses died 1 June 1909 [photo at Find a Grave].\n\nIn 1851 John and Jane are resident in Stalybridge with Martha Buckley, son Walter age 1. John and Jane are resident at Stalybridge in 1861 with children Walter, Moses, John Edmund and Sarah Jane. These appear to be the four children who went out to New Zealand. John and Jane had additional children presumed to have died young: Jonathon, Edward, John, Alice, Ellen, Elizabeth. [The GRO records include a Jonathon born Jun Q 1849 Ashton under Lyne, mother Buckley. Walter was registered in the Sep Q 1849. A Jonathon Kelsall of Ashton under Lyne was buried 17 Oct 1849 age 17 weeks. Perhaps Jonathon and Walter were twins born about June 1849, and Walter’s registration was delayed.]\n\nFrom Karen Colmore Williams in 2015, I am resourcing my Kelsall family history starting out with a family bible that came out to New Zealand with John Bamford Kelsall, wife Jane and 4 children on the American clipper ship the British Crown which arrived in Lyttlton New Zealand in 1863. The family bible has a wonderful etching of St Paul’s church in Stalybridge and inscribed by the first vicar…apparently in the1860’s there was a mass exodus due to the cotton panic and famine and many of the families were given free passage by the churches. Also NZ was advertising free land grants to establish the young colony.\n\nFamily Bible is an etching of St Paul’s Stalybridge, with an inscription “..John Bamford leaving for NZ 1963” [Karen Colmore-Williams]\n\nChildren of John Bamford and Jane who went out to New Zealand:\n\nWalter\n\nBorn 1849 Stalybridge. Married Alice Eliza Jeffery in New Zealand in 1881. Walter became a baker and confectioner in Onehunga in 1869 and continued in the business until he died in 1903 from a brain tumor.\n\nPhoto.

George Henry is remembered at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Online Cenotaph site and on the family grave at Waikaraka Park Cemetery, Auckland.\n\nLance Corporal Cyril Jeffrey Kelsall, formerly a joiner, served on the Western Front, 1917-18 and was wounded 11 April 1918. He died after discharge in New Zealand, 25 November 1918, age 23. He is buried at Waikaraka Park Cemetery, Auckland, and remembered at the Online Cenotaph and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nFrom “Papers Past, National Library of New Zealand”, Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 65, 11 December 1918, “Lance-Corporal Cyril Jeffery Kelsall, a discharged soldier, died at Auckland Military Hospital annexe of influenza on November 25. Deceased was 24 years of age and single, his next-of-kin being his mother, Mrs. W. Kelsall, Onehunga”.\n\n.\n\nAnne Cordelia 1899 -1906.\n\nMoses\n\nBorn 1851 in Stalybridge.

Married Caroline Hills in New Zealand in 1885.\n\nSarah Jane\n\nBorn 1859 Stalybridge. Married Donald Sutherland, died 1922. Line of Helen Skinner (DNA match)\n\nAnother son, Abel was born in New Zealand in 1866 and died in 1942. I have not found a marriage for Abel. In the 1903 electoral rolls Abel was living on Queen Street, Onehunga with Alice Eliza, Caroline and John. Alice Eliza was the widow of Walter, and Caroline the widow of John Edmund.\n\nMary 1827\n\nMary married William Hibbert 31 December 1847 at Stalybridge, father identified as Isaac occupation hatter. They had at least six children, Hannah, Emma Jane, Walter, George Washington and Abel Andrew. The family is in Dukinfield in 1871, Beswick Lancs. in 1881, and Ardwick Lancs. in 1891. Mary visited daughter Hannah in New Jersey in 1885 when she appeared on the New Jersey state census. She may be the Mary Hibbert who died 1904 in Runcorn, Cheshire.\n\nMary’s son Walter was killed in the Astley Deep Pit disaster at Dukinfield, 14 April 1874.\n\nMary’s daughter Hannah married Thomas Hamer in Manchester in 1882. Their son Walter Hamer was born Newark City, NJ 25 August 1883 and son Thomas Jr. was born 11 August 1886 in Rhode Island. In the 1885 state census for Newark, NJ, Thomas Hamer, Hannah Hamer, Walter Hamer and Mary Hibbert are living in the same dwelling as the family of Mary’s brother Joshua.\n\nSuzan Hamer is the great granddaughter of Thomas Hamer and Hannah Hibbert, and 3rd great granddaughter of Isaac Kelsall and Sarah Ann Bamford. She is a 4th cousin of Deborah Ulrich.\n\nWilliam 1830\n\nFrom the Manchester Non-conformist registers, William son of Isaac, hatter of Dukinfield, was found dead in bed age 11 and buried 24 August 1840. Note some confusion here because William is listed in the 1841 census age 11.\n\nWalter 1831\n\nWalter’s story is obtained from Glenn Kelsall (who received it from Ken Kelsall’s “A Line of Descent” written in 1985), and from various historical records posted to Ancestry.com by Debbie Northe, and other records received from Sue Toulis. According to Ken’s account, Walter was born in Dukinfield 20 December 1831, and baptised 24 January 1832 at Stalybridge.\n\nWalter enlisted in the 68th Durham Light Infantry in September 1848 before he had reached the age of 17. He served in Ireland for a little more than two years before transferring to the Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich, London in January 1851 (where he can be found in the 1851 Census. In August 1852 he moved to the garrison at Gibraltar. During the Crimean War (October 1853 to February 1856), he was engaged in ferrying horses and stores between Gibraltar and Balaclava, but he saw action at Sevastopol in June 1855. By this time, he held the rank of corporal. In November 1855 he was promoted to sergeant.\n\nIn May 1858 he commenced an 18 months period in the army recruiting service, and was centred in Bury St Edmond’s in Suffolk. It was here that he met Emma Arbon, the daughter of John and Elizabeth Arbon\n\nWalter Kelsall and Emma Arbon were married at Bury St Edmonds on 6 October 1859.\n\nIn January 1861 Walter was promoted to sergeant major in the Royal Artillery and left for New Zealand attached to the 57th Regiment. He was accompanied by Emma and their first daughter, Phoebe, then only a couple of months old. They arrived in Auckland in June 1851. Emma stayed at Parnell, Auckland where daughters Minnie and Violet were born.\n\nWalter served during the Maori Wars between 1861 and 1866. Walter and family left for England in May 1867, arriving in August. Helen Beatrice (Ellen) was born during the voyage.\n\nBetween 1861 and 1866 during the Maori Wars, Master Gunner Walter Kelsall was posted to Shepards Bush, Auckland, New Zealand, part of the 4th Brigade, Royal Artillery. During this period the first three girls (Phoebe, Minnie and Violet) were born at Parnell Auckland. Helen Beatrice (Ellen) was born on the ship while the family was returning to the United Kingdom.\n\nWalter’s brothers Abel and John Bamford Kelsall immigrated to New Zealand 1863 during Walter’s posting. Perhaps they were influenced by stories from Walter.\n\nOn return from New Zealand, Walter was posted to Broughty Ferry Castle near Dundee, Scotland as Master Gunner. From Ken Kelsall’s Line of Descent,” Walter was appointed Master Gunner at the Castle Broughty Ferry on the Firth of Tay near Dundee in Scotland. It was here that the 4 sons of the family were born – William (1869), Hector (1872), Frank (1874) and Victor (1875). William died in early infancy”. But from Scottish birth records:\n\nWalter Hector Arbon was born 16 April 1869\n\nAlbert Alexander born 2 Nov 1870 and died 11 Nov 1870\n\nVictor Albert born 13 Nov 1871\n\nFrank McDonald Syme born 1 Jan 1874\n\nIn 1871 the family was at Monifieth, Angus, Scotland (7 miles east of Dundee) including children Phoebe, Emma, Violet, Emma, Walter.\n\nOn 25th April 1872 Walter posted a letter to the NZ War Minister seeking employment in “N.Z State Services”, to which he received the reply “Regret very much that there is nothing suitable at present to offer”. Glenn Kelsall obtained a copy of this correspondence held in the NZ government archives.\n\nOn 2 Oct 1874 Master Gunner Walter Kelsall was discharged from the Royal Hospital, Chelsea having served 23 years 249 days. It records 12 years 3 months abroad. 5y 8m in Gibraltar and 6y 7m in New Zealand. It records him being awarded the New Zealand War medal and a Silver Medal for Long Service. Both of these medals are in Glenn Kelsall’s possession today. A collection of papers relating to Walter’s pension are posted online. One example shows that he was awarded a small gratuity.\n\nThe family travelled back to New Zealand and settled in Napier in 1875. It appears Walter was employed as a Drill Instructor for the local brigade. In January 1879 whilst marking at the rifle range in Napier, Walter was accidentally shot through his left calf.\n\nSgt Major Walter Kelsall\n\nAccidentally shot at Butts\n\n27th Jan 1879, aged 46\n\nAlso\n\nEmma wife of above\n\n4 June 1918, aged 79\n\nAlso Capt. V/A. Kelsall\n\nKilled at Suvla Bay\n\n8th Aug 1915\n\nAbide With Me\n\nDescription on Find a Grave from Evening Post 28 January 1879. “While practicing at the Tutikure ranges, seeing the members walking away from the 400-yard ranges, he assumed that practice was over. He came in front of the target without showing the danger flag. Walter Newton thought he would have a few more shots at the 500-yard range. it wasn’t until after he had shot the first bullet that the marker was observed running to the cover of the butt. it wasn’t thought at the time that Mr Walter Kelsall had been hit. Newton fired his second shot, and the usual signal was put up to intimate to show that firing had ceased. They then saw the danger flag waving at the butt, where they discovered that Kelsall had been shot clean through the upper part of his calf. The wound was not considered serious by the attending doctor but Walter died 3 days later from blood-poisoning. A coroner’s inquest was held where it was found “We find that the deceased was accidentally shot, and that no blame attaches to Walter Newton”.\n\nThere is a report of the Coroner’s inquest here, and a memorial here.\n\nKelsall St. in Napier is named after Walter.\n\nThe two girls Daisy and Rose were born in New Zealand, Rose 6 months after Walter’s death.\n\nEmma died in 1918.\n\nChildren of Walter and Emma\n\nPhoebe 1860\n\nMarried Daniel Henry Fox 1881.

Children Thomas, William, John, Francis, Hector, Victor, Walter, Kathleen, Margaret, Reginald. Died 1947.\n\nWilliam, John, Hector and Victor all served in WW1. William and Victor both fought at Gallipoli and then in France. John Richard served in the Balkans, and at Gallipoli, 1915, in Egypt, 1915-16, and on the Western Front, 1916. He was badly wounded in the head, chest, and stomach, and invalided back to NZ. He was only married a few weeks in 1920 and died from his injuries in his garden. He was buried at Porirua Cemetery and is commemorated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission\n\nand at the New Zealand War Graves Project.\n\nVictor was gassed at Passchendaele and invalided home.\n\nKathleen married William Wilson.

Captain Victor Albert Kelsall of the Wellington Mounted Rifles was a surveyor before the war. He died of wounds at Chunuk Bair, northern Anzac sector, Gallipoli, 8 August 1915, age 44. He is remembered on the Chunuk Bair (New Zealand) Memorial in Turkey.\n\nVictor Albert’s military history has been summarized by Debbie Northe and Sue Toulis.\n\nFought in the South African (Boer) War 1900 – 02. ‘In 1906 he took part in operations against the Zulu rebels, and for his services received the Zulu Medal.’ (Auckland Weekly News 26 Aug 1915 p22).\n\n2nd and 8th New Zealand New Zealand Mounted Rifles Contingents to South Africa.\n\nApplication for enlistment in 2nd Contingent for Service in South Africa.

Kelsall, reported to have been killed in action at the Dardanelles, was well and popularly known in Marlborough. His early days were spent in Napier, where his parents lived, and he came to this district several years ago, joining a government survey party. He and Mr. E. Moore, of Parikawa, went away together as members of one of the first contingents to serve in the South African war. Returning as a sergeant, he left with a later contingent as a lieutenant and saw additional service. Subsequently he engaged in farming in the Awatere and Sounds districts, being successively in partnership with Mr. Moore and Mr Kennaday.’ (Marlborough Express, 20 Aug 1915 p5)\n\nKilled during the heavy fighting on Chunuk Bair, 9th August:\n\n‘About 5 a.m., while the Turkish attack upon them was still at its height, three high-explosive howitzer shells, coming from the right rear, burst among them, one exploding in the front trench on the left, wrecking the trench, and killing the gallant Major Statham together with his brother beside him, as well as Sergeant-Major Porteous and six or seven men. The shells almost certainly came from one of the howitzer batteries inside the old Anzac lines. Part of the New Zealanders on the left consequently broke, and ran back towards the second trench, fifty yards in rear. Some men also fell back from the right. The situation for a moment looked critical. But Colonel Meldrum of the Wellingtons with his adjutant Captain Kelsall, and Major Elmslie, rallied the men. The brave Elmslie led forward a troop of his squadron to reoccupy the empty sector of trench. Before he could reach it he was hit by a bullet through shoulder and neck. He fell, picked himself up, gained the trench, and there, smiling at some of his men, ‘I’m afraid I can’t help you much further, boys, but you’re doing well – keep on…,’ he said, and died. Kelsall, leading back the men who had retired, also gained the trench, but was soon afterwards killed by a bomb.’ (Bean V2 p692-693 quoted).\n\n‘Tortured by thirst, in desperate pain from open wounds, the gallant little force refused to be beaten. It was during this momentous phase in the operations that the magnificent morale and inspired example of the officers of the Regiment asserted themselves with splendid results. While the position was exposed to the full force of the attack, and one part of the line appeared to be weakening, Colonel Meldrum, Major Elmslie, and Captain Kelsall sprang from their shallow trenches and hastened to restore the line. Major Elmslie and Captain Kelsall both fell during this critical time. But their example was not lost.’ (Wilkie p55 quoted, p58).\n\nAdditional information can be found at the Online Cenotaph\n\nttps://www.aucklandmuseum.com/war-memorial/online-cenotaph/record/C8148\n\nFrank McDonald Syme 1874\n\nMarried Catherine Murrow in Perth Western Australia in 1897. Children Francis Murrow Seddon, Dorothy, Ivy, Gladys, Olive, Victor McDonald. Died 1951 in Perth. Descendants in Australia including Glenn Kelsall.\n\nFrancis (Frank) moved to Kalgoorlie, Western Australia in 1896 (part of the Kalgoorlie Gold Rush), where he took up a position at the Kalgoorlie Miner Newspaper. To get to Kalgoorlie, prior to the construction of the trainline, he walked in from Southern Cross, across 225Km of very barren landscape. A prominent union man, he eventually became President of the Printing Industry Employees Union of Australia. He ran as a candidate in WA State Election and was instrumental in the construction of Anzac Cottage, a house in the suburb of Mount Hawthorn, Western Australia that was built as both a memorial to the soldiers who died in the Gallipoli Campaign and as a home for one of the wounded returning men. It is notable for being the first World War I memorial built in Western Australia, and for mostly being built in a single day (12 February 1916) with donated funds, materials and labour.\n\nWarrant Officer Francis Seddon Kelsall of Australian headquarters, was the son of Frank McDonald Syme Kelsall and Catherine Kelsall, husband of Mildred Ivy Kelsall of North Perth. He died of illness 16 December 1946 age 49 and is buried at Karrakatta Cemetery, Perth. He is listed in both CWGC and the Australian War Memorial.\n\nFrank divorced Catherine Murrow after she was declared “insane” and committed to the Fremantle Asylum in September 1905. She was discharged for one month in March 1906 but was then re-admitted and in May she was transferred to Claremont Hospital for the Insane, where she remained until her death in 1955. Frank fathered a son, Victor Macdonald, born 28 April 1907 in Napier, New Zealand. Victor’s birth record has Father = NR, Mother = Eva Mable Merrick, and his name as Victor McDonald Merrick. Eva Merrick was Catherine Murrow’s niece (mother Frances Harriet Murrow).\n\nFrank married Jessie Josephine Wilhelmina Richmond in 1918.\n\nLily May Daisy 1876\n\nMarried George Farquarson Proctor in 1897. Children George, Ivy, May and Linda. Died 1957.\n\nRose Walterina 1879\n\nMarried Albert Pearce in 1902. Children Ronald, Walter, Ruth, Horace, Bernice, Rose. Died 1944\n\nJoshua Kelsall 1836 – 1901\n\nJoshua appears on the 1851 census, at home in Town Lane Dukinfield with father Isaac and stepmother Mary Ann, age 15 occupation “sliverer” (most probably refers to someone running the initial carding engines in a cotton mill). Sister Hannah was working as a cotton weaver). From the 1900 US census Joshua was born in June 1835; he was christened 14 March 1836 at Providence Independent, Dukinfield\n\nJoshua married Jane Wood 18 May 1856 at Ashton under Lyne, father Isaac. Jane Kelsall died Dec Q 1859 in Chorlton, about 10 miles from Dukinfield, where she had been baptised. Joshua arrived in New York 8 Dec 1859, so it fits that he left soon after his wife died.\n\nJoshua arrived New York 8 Dec 1859 age 24, on the SS Cultivator from Liverpool, occupation smith, appears to be traveling alone. Note that I have not previously seen him referred to as a smith, but 8 years have elapsed since the 1851 census.\n\nJoshua Served in the 14th NJ Volunteers Company B, August 1862 to June 1865. He was wounded on 19 October 1864 during the Battle of Cedar Creek in Shenandoah County, Virginia (a Union victory under Gen. Phil Sheridan) (from Richard Marsh tree).\n\nJoshua married Christiana Ball on 16 July 1864 in Newark, NJ. Their daughter Annie E. (1869 – 1939) married Theodore Marsh and had six children one of whom died as an infant. Theodore took his own life in 1930. They have many descendants in New Jersey but none with surviving Kelsall name. Deborah Ulrich is a 2nd great granddaughter of Joshua Kelsall. Richard Marsh is a 2nd great grandson also with a tree on Ancestry.\n\nIn the 1870 US census (official date 1 June), Joshua Kelsey (sic as written on the census form) is in Newark with Christiana age 37, Walter 4, Anna 2 and Mary 2 months. Joshua’s age is given as 38 when he should have been 34 or 35. In the 1880 census for Newark we see Joshua Kelsall (transcribed as Kelsau on Ancestry), 44, Christina 48, Annie 11 and Sarah 10 are found in Newark. Joshua was a blacksmith. I did not find Joshua in the 1860 census. Christina had given birth to two boys Aaron Walter in 1866 and William Robert in 1867 who had died young. Their second daughter Sarah apparently did not marry and died in Newark some time after 1940\n\nChristiana died in 1892 in Harrison, NJ. Joshua died at the US National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers at Kennebec, Maine 19 July 1901. His body was returned to New Jersey for burial.\n\n[An interesting possible addition to the Joshua story is that there is a record on Family Search of Joshua Kelsall, 27. Birth Year (Est.) 1835. Spouse: Anna Wood, 30; est. birth 1832. Marriage, 16 Mar 1862, Newark, Essex, New Jersey. Is this the same Joshua? Note that Joshua from Dukinfield had been married to Jane Wood in England. He joined the Army in August 1862 and married Christiana only two years later. I have not been able to resolve this.]\n\nJoseph 1837\n\nLikely the Joseph born abt. 1837 Dukinfield admitted to the Royal Hospital Chelsea in 1888. Based on this probably resident of Leith Fort in 1861 and in Leith, Edinburgh in 1881 and 1891 married to Robina (Fraser). Daughter Janet born 1867 may have married William Aimers.\n\nAncestors of Isaac Kelsall\n\nFor the history of Kelsall in Dukinfield prior to Isaac a valuable reference is A Line of Descent prepared by Ken Kelsall of Western Australia. Ken traveled to England in 1986 to document a line of descent first drawn by his grandfather, Frank McDonald Kelsall following his trip to England in 1923. Ken visited Broughty Ferry, Chester, Kelsall and Dukinfield and obtained info from archives in Chester, St Catherine’s House London, Kew and the College of Arms. He obtained from LDS civil registration records (after 1837) and parish registers for Dukinfield and Ashton under Lyne.\n\nKen Kelsall provided a chart based on his research in 1986/1987.\n\nJoseph and Mary\n\nFrom Isaac’s baptism we know his parents were Joseph and Mary. In the registers for Dukinfield Old Chapel (searched on Ancestry by this author and in the original registers by Ken Kelsall), the first baptism marked with father Joseph and mother Mary is Ann, 17 January 1786 (buried 1789). The first with only father Joseph marked is Ann, 4 October 1776 (buried 6 October).\n\nThe children of Joseph and Mary match the registers for Dukinfield Old Chapel searched on Ancestry by this author. Joseph was baptised 17 June 1753, parents William and Sarah.\n\nFrom trees on Ancestry, and a tree on Geneanet (Zackery Shiloh Neale), Joseph Kelsall was married about 1775 to Mary who was deceased 9 May 1796, age 41. I have not found these records and the trees on Ancestry are not well documented. [It seems these trees were done originally to support LDS baptism/confirmation of Alice born 1756 who married Samuel Ogden 2 Jan 1775 at Stockport. Alice’s son Isaac died in Toowoomba, Queensland in 1876. There are many descendants in Utah.]\n\nLooking independently, there is a Joseph buried 11 Jan 1835 age 83 Dukinfield Old Chapel, which translates to birth about 1752. [Note the strange reference to drowning]\n\nFrom Ancestry: Manchester, England, Non-Conformist Deaths and Burials, 1758-1987\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com/discoveryui-content/view/343688:9096?tid=190044726&pid=362466482408&queryId=fe695774925e6a2b01fd9d30e720f957&_phsrc=ZUQ26&_phstart=successSource\n\nJoseph and Mary could be the Joseph Kelsall who married Mary Cheetham 20 Feb 1776 at Stockport, which matches location and birth of first child.\n\nFrom FMP: Cheshire Diocese of Chester Parish Marriages 1538-1910\n\nhttps://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=GBPRS%2FCHS%2F4019081%2F00221&parentid=GBPRS%2FM%2F770540398%2F1\n\nWilliam and Sarah\n\nFrom trees on Ancestry, and a tree on Geneanet (Zackery Shiloh Neale), Joseph Kelsall was baptised 17 June 1753 Dukinfield, parents William and Sarah. From Ken Kelsall’s chart, William and Sarah’s first child was John baptised 27 September 1730 at Ashton under Lyne. This points to a marriage, William Kelsall and Sarah Heyward 18 Jan 1729 Stockport, “both of Dukinfield”.\n\nFrom FMP: Cheshire Diocese Of Chester Parish Marriages 1538-1910\n\nhttps://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=GBPRS%2FCHS%2F4019074%2F00537&parentid=GBPRS%2FM%2F770236792%2F1\n\nLooking at possible records for William born about 1705, we find William Kelsal of Dukinfield buried at Dukinfield Old Chapel, 12 Dec 1790 age between 80 and 90.\n\nFrom FMP: England & Wales Non-Conformist Burials\n\nhttps://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=TNA%2FRG4%2F2520%2F0%2F0033&parentid=TNA%2FRG4%2FBUR%2F236328\n\nI have not found any other likely records searching in Dukinfield, Ashton under Lyne and Stockport registers online. Given that 1790 – 85 = 1705 I am confident that this is the record that Ken Kelsall attributed as William 1705.\n\nI have not found a record to correspond to William 1645. This may have been an inference from “Sir Thomas having a young son in 1650.\n\nAnother Emigrant Family\n\nAnother Kelsall family from Dukinfield emigrated to Australia in the 1860s. This is the line of Thomas Kelsall born Dukinfield 1815, son of George and Mary. Thomas and wife Nancy (Wrigley) arrived in Australia 1864 on the vessel Tarquin, with children Nancy born 1828, Jemima born 1848 (died 1865), Mary Anne 1853, and Thomas born 1853. There is a tree on Ancestry showing living descendants in Adelaide.\n\nI don’t know how Thomas and his father George relate to the Isaac line. They are not in Ken Kelsall’s chart. From examination of Dukinfield BMDs, George and Mary also had Eliza 1811, Mary 1813, Charles 1817 and James 1819. There is a George bapt. 1783 father Henry, and a George bapt. 1785 father James – both with mother Mary. Thomas 1815 had a brother James (and no brother Henry) suggesting that their father, George was more likely the son of James, baptised 1785.\n\nEvidently in the mid to late 18th C there were several contemporaneous Kelsall families in Dukinfield. I have not been able to join these together.\n\nSir Thomas Kelsall\n\nFrom the tree drawn by Ken Kelsall in 1987 William, father of Joseph was born c. 1705. William’s father, another William was born c 1645 (note 60-year gap). William’s father was “Sir Thomas Kelsall” and he had a brother Henry. Ken included a narrative regarding “Sir Thomas” and his involvement in the English Civil War as a supporter of the King, Charles I.\n\nFollowing Cromwell’s victory at Worcester 6 Sept 1651 Charles escaped but several Cheshire gentlemen who had supported him were hunted down. Some were executed while others escaped and had their lands confiscated. One of this latter group was Sir Thomas Kelsall. Lady Kelsall died soon after, and her two young sons, William and Henry Kelsall were brought up by their uncle, Sir Francis Robert Dukinfield, at Dukinfield Hall.\n\nThe present author has not been able to substantiate this story. As of September 2023, this author has looked extensively online and found no reference of Thomas Kelsall related to the Civil War.\n\nIn his The History of the County Palatine and City of Chester, George Ormerod (1819) describes a trial that started investigations at Chester in July 1651 culminating in October when 10 officers were condemned and eight were eventually executed. Three of the condemned are named, not including Thomas Kelsall. Similarly, Kelsall is not named among the condemned men in The History of Chester by Joseph Hemingway (1831). [Much of what is written about the tribunal concerns the Earl of Derby who was executed for treason].\n\nThe court martial was reported to Parliament:\n\nCol. Robert Duckenfield was a Parliamentarian and was appointed Governor of Chester in 1650. As such he was directed to appoint the tribunal at which various Royalists tried. If Thomas Kelsall was one of the men tried (which we do not know), would he then have taken charge of the two sons?\n\nFrom John Kelsall’s Notes on the Family Kelsall concerning the Manor of Kelsall, “In the time of Charles I, John Kelsall, the then head of the family, was a Royalist, imprisoned by Cromwell at Chester Castle and his estate (then reckoned as worth about #1500 a year) was sequestrated. After the Civil War was over he had to buy his liberty by surrendering half his estate to the Commonwealth.”\n\nSo are we looking for Thomas or John, or both? Evidently, Ken Kelsall found a text that I have not found.\n\nIf Thomas had a son William born in about 1645, Thomas was born likely in the period 1600 to 1625. Looking at possible records:\n\nNo Sir Thomas in Burke’s Peerage\n\nNone found in various trees developed on this website: Audley, Bradshaw, Etchells,\n\nNo Kelsall marriage on the Dukinfield tree in Earwacker.\n\nHave contacted several other Kelsall researchers who have not come across Sir Thomas\n\nNothing found in web searches\n\nJohn Kelsall “the then head of the family” may be the John Kelsall of Mickle Trafford who sat on a jury at Chester Assizes 5 Feb 19th year of Charles (= 1644) (from Tracts relating to the Civil War in Cheshire, 1641-1659; Ed. by Rev. James Augustus Atkinson 1909). From the Trafford tree, this may be John Kelsall of Willison who had sons William and Thomas.\n\nDukinfield\n\nDUKINFIELD or Duckenfield, is a township, in the parish of Stockport, union of Ashton-under-Lyne, hundred of Macclesfield, N. division of the county of Chester; adjoining Ashton-under-Lyne. The River Tame separates the township from the town of Ashton-under-Lyne, in Lancashire. A church, dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, was erected in 1840-1841, and consecrated on May 24th in the latter year. An ecclesiastical parish, called St. Mark’s, was formed of a part of Dukinfield adjoining Ashton, in February 1846. Another chapel was built and situated in the town of Stalybridge (which is partly in this township), called Castle Hall Chapel, was formed, also in 1846. The Calvinists, Independents, Primitive and Wesleyan Methodists, Methodists of the New Connexion, Moravians, Unitarians, and Roman Catholics have places of worship."
