        "text": "Time for some comedy nostalgia, with Broken Robot Productions and So Comedy’s Radio Active: The 40th Anniversary Show at Gilded Balloon Teviot – Debating Hall, at 16:30 on Wednesday 21st. Here’s the blurb: “Angus Deayton, Helen Atkinson Wood, Michael Fenton Stevens and Philip Pope return to the Fringe to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the legendary, award-winning radio comedy at the festival in which it was born. Join the original cast as they perform a new selection of classic scripts live for the very first time. ‘An hour of pure mirth’ **** (Telegraph). ‘If you want to laugh a lot, don’t miss this!’ ***** (BritishTheatreGuide.info). ‘Classic, clever and charming… just simple excellence’ ***** (EdinburghGuide.com). ‘An absolute treat’ **** (TheEdinburghReporter.co.uk).”\n\nI occasionally listened to this show in its heyday but have always admired the talents of the four performers separately anyway; Ms Atkinson Wood and I were at that big posh university at the same time together. Check back around 5.45 pm to see if we liked the nostalgia. By then the next preview blog should be available to read too.\n\nNostalgia, yes, but good sketch comedy is good sketch comedy and this is simply an hour of laughs that really lifts your spirits. All this and a final concert from the HeeBeeGeeBees! I’d forgotten about them – one of the best comedy records ever. We loved it, go see it for yourself!"
