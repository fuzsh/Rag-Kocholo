For some years he was with the Royal Comic Opera Company under Messrs.

When Mr William Rignold made a great success of his life as Falstaff (Merry Wives of Windsor), Mr Rigby contributed a clever little character study as \"mine Host of the Garter\" with jolly unctuous laugh, who figured in the third scene of the comedy. His last appearance on stage was in \"True as Steel\" as long ago as February 1893 when appropriately enough his last words he said in public were \" Well, anyhow, I've done my duty, and that's all I want\" Many kind attentions were shown him during his long illness by Mr and Mrs Rignold - to whom he wrote very gratefully - and by the members of their company, and his old friend Mr Stirling Whyte remained with him almost to the last.
