Sue was born in Westerville, Ohio August 24, 1943 to Karl and Mildred Haberman. Being the youngest of their 4 children, life was full of adventure, growing up in the quaint town of Westerville. Sue was a proud graduate of Westerville High School, Class of 1961. Soon after graduation she then went on to the Ohio State School of Cosmetology, where she met many of her life-long friends. She enjoyed doing hair and though she didn’t work in the industry long, her talents were put to work, braiding and styling her girls’ hair for their many swim meets, cheerleading competitions, and game nights. And if you knew her, you know she never had a hair out of place! After meeting Ray Vernon Chamberlain, Jr at a community picnic along the Olentangy River, they soon began dating and married June 6, 1964, residing in Grove City. After Ray’s untimely death in 1975, Sue and her girls moved back to Westerville to be near family and the community that she so dearly loved. Through the process of buying her Westerville home, she found a love for real estate. Sue soon graduated from Hondros College and became one of Columbus’ top producing Realtors, winning many awards for production and service to her clients. She often called her colleagues at Century 21 Joe Walker & Associates and members of the Columbus Board of Realtors, her second family. An avid traveler, Sue loved visiting the beaches of Hawaii, touring Europe, and later in life, revisiting Lake Temagami, Ontario; a place her family summered in her youth. After a very courageous standoff with cancer, Sue quietly passed at home. The visits, calls, and cards from well-wishers brightened her days, while giving her strength. Sue was preceded in death by her parents, Karl & Mildred Haberman, loving husband, Ray, and twin sisters Patricia & Priscilla. She leaves behind her brother, David Haberman (Sharon), daughters Stephanie Griffith and Susanne Horner (Sam), her beloved grandchildren Mason Ray Holland and Sydney Chamberlain Horner, her dog Coco, and countless nieces, nephews, cousins, and life-long friends.\n\nJames Edward Ullman - March 12, 2024\n\nJames Edward Ullman, son of the late Walter Bryson Ullman and Grace Ellen Clark.

James had been married to his wife Roseanne for twenty-seven years. They both thoroughly enjoyed antiquing together and any other activity that ran along that line. Jim made it a point to pick Rosie up for lunch practically every day followed by an extended adventurous drive. They enjoyed each other’s company with a true passion. James was a Realtor by profession for forty-eight years and was considered a staple of the real estate community. James also had many hobbies but had a real passion for fishing, golfing and cooking (A Damn Fine Cook!) James is survived by his wife Roseanne Ullman, his sons Jon, George, Jason & daughters Jocelyn, Erin and Shannon. Many grandchildren as well. James passed on Tuesday March 12th. He will be dearly missed. A Celebration Of Life Ceremony to be announced.\n\nPatrick (Pat) Joseph Mollica - February 17, 2024\n\nPatrick Joseph Mollica (Pat) died Saturday, February 17, 2024, in his Key West, Florida home, a month before he would have turned 94.

Pat was an amateur boxer in his youth, an avid snow skier and an active tennis and handball player. He was a very kind soul; had a positive, energetic outlook on life; enjoyed a wonderful sense of humor and was a prolific joke teller. A bicycling enthusiast, Pat completed the Bicentennial Bicycle Route across America, peddling 4,250 miles from Astoria, Oregon to Yorktown, Virginia. Pat had an adventurous spirit and was a world traveler. He traveled extensively throughout Europe with Norma but most unique were his sojourns alone in exotic lands. He spent months traveling throughout South America and Asia. Walking in rural China, he drew crowds of villagers who had never before seen a western, occidental man in person. Pat was a loving husband; wonderful father and uncle; and great friend to many, most of whom would say he was the finest man they knew. Such is his legacy. Per his request, no memorial services are planned.\n\nJohn L. Parsley - February 3, 2024\n\nJohn L. Parsley, age 90, formerly of Warfield, KY, passed away on Saturday, February 3, 2024, in Ohio.

He did not suffer as he passed away suddenly and unexpectedly from natural causes. Andy was a sales associate with Keller Williams Consultants. He retired from the City of Westerville Fire Department in 2022 after 37 years of service to his community. Andy knew he wanted to be a fireman from a young age and frequented Washington TWP firehouse in Centerville, OH where he was called their mascot. He attended the fire and EMT program at the Northwest Career Center, now known as Delaware Area Career Center. He earned his associate degree in Fire Science/EMS from Columbus Community College. He went on to Franklin University where he earned a bachelor’s degree in public safety administration. Andy continued his life of service to his community after retirement by becoming a Service Project Coordinator at WARM, a Westerville food bank. Andy loved people, which was a direct reflection of his faith in God. He loved to serve as a greeter at church and was involved in many church groups. Andy was known for his warm smile, big hugs, outrageous humor, and his willingness to help everyone with anything. He did not know a stranger and was a pillar of his community. Most of all, Andy was the heart and soul of his very large family. He will be missed beyond measure as he was a loving husband, father, poppy, brother, uncle, friend, and neighbor.

But that’s not how Pat would want to — or should be — remembered. Pat will be remembered for his larger-than-life personality, accompanied by an even larger laugh, his unique sense of humor, a warm smile and a welcoming handshake. If you lived in or even visited German Village, you knew Pat Phillips. Born to Grace and Raymond Phillips on Jan. 17, 1939, in Merion Village, Pat joined his older siblings, Jack, Gary and Anne. He graduated from St. Leo School and went on to The Ohio State University. While in college, he realized he was just “too smart” to sit in a chair and learn from books. Pat was drafted into the U.S. Army, serving on what he called “the Western Front.” We would know it as Colorado Springs. After the army, he moved back to Columbus and worked as a bartender at Planks Bier Garten in German Village, where he met his future wife, Patty (McGue) Phillips. After they married, they had their son Ryan Patrick Phillips. Over time, Pat built and created a real estate brokerage firm, Patrick Phillips Real Estate (now List Realty). This career was custom-made for him, as he looked forward to welcoming new people and families into German Village and would often become their real estate agent, friend, and happy-hour pal. Real estate also allowed him to do what he loved, golf. Pat could be found every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday at Groveport Golf Club, playing golf and hurling profanity that can still be heard echoing around the back nine. He was among the first to bring a “City Cart” car into German Village (think of a Volkswagen Bug, minus the doors) and would happily volunteer to take visitors on many tours of this historic area. He would share stories, point out historical points of interest, and offer tourists a good laugh and a drink. Along with his wife Patty and their son Ryan, they lived and saw life in many places around the world. His life’s education was enriched by visiting Ireland, Turkey, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, and countless stops across the U.S. Pat’s way of life was even further enhanced as his three grandchildren entered his world. Connor Patrick (19), Mason Ashcraft (14), and Colin Edward (14) became the focus of his and Patty’s lives. Vacations, swimming at their home, weekly Thursday visits to Planks for wine and popcorn, sleepovers, cart rides, and so much more. All of this enhanced his world and made his smile wider, his heart fuller, and his laughs even larger. Pat will be remembered for all of these reasons and would want us to kick off 2024 just as he lived his life, get together with family and friends, share stories, jokes, and laughter, and raise a glass to celebrate. Because, after all, in his nearly 85 years of living, Pat showed us all that life is far too short to live without any of these things. Viewing will be Friday, Jan. 5, at the MAEDER-QUINT-TIBERI Funeral Home at 1068 South High St., from 4 to 7 p.m. Friends and family will meet for Mass of Christian Burial 10 a.m. Sat., Jan. 6, at St. Mary Church in German Village, 684 South 3rd St. Pat’s Celebration of Life will follow Saturday’s church services at Planks Bier Garten, 888 S. High Street.\n\nDaryl R. Schorsten - December 5, 2023\n\nDaryl R. Schorsten entered his eternal rest on Tuesday, December 5, 2023, at his home in Powell, Ohio, surrounded by his family and loved ones. Daryl made a brave fight against gastric cancer for the past 7 months. He was 70 years old. Daryl was born on August 25, 1953, in Canton, Ohio to Walter and LaVonne (Shively) Schorsten. He spent his childhood in Canton and graduated from Canton Lehman High School in 1972. He studied broadcasting at Youngstown State and had a career in broadcasting in Canton and Youngstown. Daryl eventually forged a career in real estate in Youngstown, then Columbus. He achieved numerous awards, some of which are REALTOR® Emeritus from the National Association of REALTORS®; the Ten Million Dollar Sales Award Club from the Columbus Board of REALTORS®; RE/MAX Hall of Fame; and many more. Daryl was president of the Dublin AM Rotary, the Shawnee Hills Chamber of Commerce, and the Greater Dublin Area Realty Association. He helped organize \"Dam Jam\" and \"Rally in the Alley\". Daryl is survived by his wife, Jeanne; sons Adam and Eric; daughter-in-law Bogna; stepdaughters Lindsey and Madison; brothers Gregg and Bruce; and countless loving family members and friends. The joy, positivity, vigor, courage, and faith that exemplified Daryl’s life will not soon be forgotten. We take great comfort in knowing he has gone to be with Christ, and we will see him again one day. On Friday, December 15, a memorial service will be held at 11:30 am at Rock City Church, Short North, 38 W Greenwood Avenue, Columbus, Ohio with a Celebration of Life gathering at Swan Lake Event Center, 5900 Liberty Rd.

She was a world traveler and visited countless countries. She also cherished traveling to attend extended family gatherings. She adored her two grandchildren who were the light of her life.

Mike was a Texas native whose life journey, shaped by the travels of a military family, had its roots in East Tennessee. A swimming scholarship led him to Eastern Kentucky University where he met Lorie Barker in computer science classes. Friends from the start led to marriage on April 18, 1987. Together, they embarked on a 36-year-long marriage, blessed with the joys and adventures of raising their children, serving at church in all age groups, but landing on youth for years, and a career change at 38. Mike was preceded in death by his parents, Carol and Bill Strange; their daughter Savannah Lou Strange; and his loyal canine companions, Rudy and Hank. His love for life is carried forward by his surviving family, his loving wife Lorie; his children Joshua Strange, Samantha Strange, and Suzannah and Alex Bush; his sister Beth (Tim) Green; and extended family whom he loved dearly including his in-law family; nephews, nieces and their spouses; great-nephews and great-nieces; and his cherished dog, Gracie. Mike graduated with a bachelor’s degree in computer science with a minor in Mathematics. His entrepreneurial spirit led him over the years to create a successful consulting business before he turned his talents to real estate, which Mike and Lorie enjoyed together for the last 20 years – working side by side every day. It has been almost 20 years exactly since Mike took a leap of faith and walked out the door of his own consulting firm and started his real estate classes without knowing what would happen. When he made his last leap of faith on Friday from this life to the next, please know that there was NO uncertainty. Mike loved Jesus and gave his life to Him during his college years and never looked back. His last verbal prayer was unsolicited and was \"Dear God, thank you for being in control, Amen.\" His life was one of service, not only to his family and clients but to his community, particularly within the church. His unwavering dedication to the youth program at Dublin Baptist Church reflected his passion for guiding young lives. In the last three years, the family has been attending Rock City Church in Hilliard and has been blessed by their care and love during this time as well. Both churches have lifted him up during this past year. If you knew Mike, you know he loved spending time with his family and friends, helping all of his kids (who followed his entrepreneurial spirit) and of course, talking about cars! His faith was the cornerstone of his existence, and he lived to inspire and uplift those around him. If you want to honor his memory: depend on God, love your spouse, call your parents, hug and encourage your children, go out to eat with friends, meet your neighbors, and dream big dreams. As we prepare to bid him farewell, we will have a visitation from 2:00-5:00 p.m. on Saturday, November 11, 2023at Schoedinger Dublin, 5980 Perimeter Drive, Dublin, OH 43017. A brief eulogy will be delivered by Jeremiah Camarata around 4:30 p.m. In honor of Mike's legacy, the family requests that contributions be made to The Central Ohio Ronald McDonald House Charities, the James Cancer Hospital, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, and continue to support his favorite businesses run by his children Joshua, Samantha and Suzannah and Alex. Mike never tired of helping or talking through ideas and obstacles with his kids for their businesses. Mike's life was a testament to love, resilience, and faith. His departure leaves a void that cannot be filled, but his legacy will forever be etched in the hearts of those who had the privilege of knowing him. His favorite Bible verse was a constant help during the last year Proverbs 3:5-6 \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. “Fond memories and expressions of sympathy may be shared at www.Schoedinger.com for the Strange family.

Standing almost 6 ½ board feet, he left his defining mark on homebuilding in Central Ohio.Bob had sawdust in his blood and lumber in his bones. He built a brand based on quality construction, attention to detail and instilled that value into his employees, subcontractors and his daughter, Becky, who continues to steer the ship. A stellar reputation that continues to live on and adds value to the many homes he has proudly built. Many enjoyed seeing his creations over the years in The Parade of Homes participating in 16+ Parades and winning countless awards. Bob was honored by his peers by being named BIA Builder of the Year in 1977 and was inducted into the BIA’s Hall of Fame in 2013. Bob was a lover of making land deals and cruising the various communities where he was building to check on their homes under construction. Bob had an unparalleled love for life! He loved his work, his family and his friends. He worked hard and played hard! In leisure, he and his family and friends enjoyed the fast lane initially in go-fast boats and slowed the pace later on—cruising Lake Erie, Florida and the Bahamas. Organized to the hilt, he stored most everything in Tupperware containers. A clean freak—you could have eaten off the floor in his garage or the bilge of his boat. Dogs were his companions both at home and in the office. Jack Russell Terriers, Jazz and Putter were assigned greeting duty for many guests and home buyers. He had a gentle and soft side too, making room at home for his cat, Jake. Bob was never in a hurry until God called him up, first to be with beloved wife, Elaine, and then probably to oversee some new construction. God’s son was a carpenter you know. Bob will be greatly missed by his family, children, Becky (Neil) Rogers and Doug Webb; granddaughter Ava Rogers; brother-in-law, Pete Taylor; and numerous nieces and nephews, extended family and close family friends. Bob was preceded in death by wife, Elaine, parents Walter and Stella Webb, brother Jim Webb, sisters Roe Nemec and Jeri Wunderle and his beloved pooches Jazz and Putter. The family would like to express their gratitude and appreciation for the excellent care and immeasurable kindness given to Bob from the amazing health professionals at Riverside Methodist Hospital. A special thank you to Dr. Kander who was an incredible doctor and so much more. Arrangements entrusted to Schoedinger Dublin. A small, private-family only service will be held to honor Bob. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory can be made to the American Heart Association.

Jim was born on 9/9/1934 to Cecil Carter Biven and Rachel Marietta Buck Biven and attended Worthington schools. His whole life has been centered on service to others - early evidence of this was his paper route in 8th grade when he was recognized for setting a record for increasing the number of customers. Even then he said his secret of success was to “be nice to the customers, don't walk on their grass, and do what makes them happy.” This describes Jim’s customer service values perfectly. Jim graduated from (Thomas) Worthington High school in1952 where he was a track star and played baseball and basketball. He subsequently attended Ohio State University studying forestry and in his early career, worked various construction jobs around Ohio with the Corps of Engineers. Jim moved his family to Westerville in 1957 and worked for Columbia Gas as a telephone contact supervisor for 9 years. He went to work for Roush Hardware in 1966 as the indoor manager of sporting goods and the automotive department – later moving to Roush Sporting goods where he was retail manager and part owner. His focus remained on excellent customer service, and he was well known in the community for such. Jim was a member of the Westerville Chamber of Commerce board of trustees 1978-1985, then President of that board from 1981-1982 and was instrumental in bringing St. Ann's Hospital to Westerville during his tenure. He also joined the Westerville Rotary club in 1978 and was Rotarian of the year in 1982 – an honor of which he was particularly proud – and served as Club President from 1985-1986. Jim served on the Board of Westerville Rotary Elderly Housing and was a key member of the committee that conceptualized and established the Harris-Askins House in 1985. A notorious early riser, he was a charter member of the Sunrise Rotary Club of Westerville (1994) and remained active in Rotary for the rest of his life. Jim retired from Roush Sporting Goods in 1992 and started a second very successful career as real estate agent with Century 21 Joe Walker, where his customer service and leadership skills earned him several awards. After retiring from real estate in 2010, Jim was busier than ever working countless hours in the Sunrise Rotary club, where he managed the front table every week and served as club photographer for all Rotary events. During his tenure in Rotary, he was the epitome of Service Above Self and was always ready with a big smile and bear hug for all. His pet project was the Memorial Day Field of Heroes for which he has been on the driving committee since the beginning and was heavily involved in conceptualization and construction of the tribute area each year. In 2015 Jim was awarded the Westerville Rotary’s A. Monroe Courtright award which recognizes outstanding community service by a leader or volunteer that is both significant and sustained. Jim served on the Board of Honor Flight Columbus and spent much time recruiting participants, fundraising, and promoting Honor Flight in the community. He was a member of the ground crew, loading and unloading every flight, and served as a guardian. Jim always said that because he was unable to serve in the military, Honor Flight was his way of honoring those who did serve and to pay them back in some way. Jim was a long-time member of Westerville Christian Church, often serving as head usher and rarely missed a Sunday until he became ill. Jim spent his spare time baking cookies for and helping out his neighbors, enjoying his 4 children, 14 grandchildren and 29 great grandchildren – all of whom were completely adored. Jim enjoyed woodworking - usually building something for someone else – one recent project close to his heart was building 700 crosses for the memorial field at the Field of Heroes. Jim was a humble man and a true servant, preferring to work behind the scenes without accolades. There he accomplished much and was a beloved member of every club, committee, or organization of which he was a part. Most of all, Jim loved his family and spent every possible moment with his kids and grandkids – he was always up for an adventure and ready for “What’s next?” No one ever doubted his love for them. Jim was a wonderful father, grandfather, leader, and friend to his large family and will be missed tremendously. Jim was preceded in death by his parents, Cecil and Rachel Biven; former spouse of 37 years and mother of his children, Jeanne (Ramey) Biven; and grandson, Donnie Raver. Remaining to treasure his memory are his four children: Linda (Russ) Shields, Cindy (Ed) Hale, James (Peggy) Biven Jr., Karen (Royce) Wood, 13 grandchildren: Marc, David, Phillip, Elizabeth, Kevin, Bryan, Mike, Jeremiah, Stacey, Kristy, Nicholas, Lea, and Steven; 29 great grandchildren, one great-great grandchild (with another on the way!); his beloved sister Nancy Thatcher, several nieces and nephews and countless friends and associates, many of whom he considered to be and felt like family, and the entire city of Westerville. There will never be another like him. “He has taken his bright candle into another room where we cannot follow; but everyone can see where he has been by all the little lights he left behind.” Family will receive friends 1:00 to 3:00 PM, Sunday, July 9, 2023 at Westerville Christian Church, 471 E. College Ave., Westerville where services will be held at 3:00 PM Sunday. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory can be made to either Westerville Sunrise Rotary Foundation, P.O.

He was less than two weeks away from his 60th birthday. Matt was a self-made man, driven to better himself, his family business and others. On December 9, 1962, a little blue-eyed boy was born in Marion General Hospital, the oldest of six children of Donald W. McCoy and Kay (Newlove) McCoy. He grew up with lawn tools in his hands, helping his father with his side landscaping business. He graduated from River Valley High School in the class of 1981 and furthered his education at the Ohio State University, where he studied Landscape Architecture. One fateful summer day in 1982, at the Whetstone Golf Course Pool, Matt met his future bride, Christine Fairchild, whom he immediately fell head over heels for. They dated while she attended college and Matt pursued his career in landscaping, and were married on June 30, 1990. Together they shared thirty-two loving years of marriage. While attending OSU, Matt started using the lessons and work ethic instilled in him by his parents, with Buckeye Landscape in Columbus, Ohio, quickly becoming a key employee in their operations. He then took a position with Vidosh Brothers Landscaping in Detroit, Michigan, learning everything he possibly could from them. During that time, his brother, Mark, joined their father in their family business, McCoy Landscape Services in Marion, Ohio. In the late 80’s, Matt joined the growing family business. After their father’s retirement in 1991, Matt and Mark grew into the perfect team, each having very different skill sets, to grow their family business year after year. Mark managed their crew and operations, while Matt used his love for business and his love for people to network and build deep trusting relationships and help his clients design the home landscapes of their dreams. Each and every day, he went above and beyond for his clients, who all instantly became his friends. Always wanting the best for his employees and their business, Matt and Mark purchased Christmas Décor, a franchise to maximize their off-season months. Then, after 32 years, they sold their family business to Schill Grounds Management. For Matt though, he wasn’t ready to retire. He was ready to take on a new challenge, diving headfirst into real estate as a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker, servicing Central Ohio and Southwest Florida. He was so excited to help his friends, most of whom he had already worked with for years, to buy and sell their homes, or buy second homes in Florida. Throughout his life, Matt has never been shy about his passions, about the things he loves. To say Matt was a car fanatic would be quite the understatement. It started with his Datsun Z28, and ended with his dream cars, his 2012 and later 2020 red Chevy Corvettes. He loved spending time in his hot tub enjoying his beautifully landscaped home in Marion or laying by the pool at their second home in Florida. He and Christine always looked forward to their two-week excursions in January, traveling most often to Aruba. He was an avid golfer, always having the time of his life with his dear friends out on the course. He also loved business, and listened intently to his biggest mentor, Peck Johnston over the years, putting his advice into action as quickly as possible. Matt was a faithful member of the Marion Country Club, where he helped design the landscapes for their housing and condominium additions. He also was a member of the Marion Gyros Club and various landscape industry associations throughout the years. Each and every day of Matt’s life, he gave his all. He was a perfectionist in everything he did, and he expected the same in return. He lived to work hard, and play hard. He had a huge heart, and deeply loved his family and friends. He worked diligently to earn your trust and loved being your go to guy if you ever needed anything. He will be dearly missed by everyone who knew him. Left to cherish his memory are his beloved wife, Christine (Fairchild) McCoy; Cavalier King Charles Sons, Corbi and Levi McCoy; mother, Kay McCoy; father, Donald (Barbara) McCoy; in-laws Larry and Barb Fairchild; five siblings: Mark (Lisa) McCoy, Michelle Wallace (Fiance, Ben Hahn), Noelle (Nick) Chaplik, Holly (Rob) Mogle, and Kyle McCoy; numerous adored nieces, nephews, and great-nieces and great-nephews; and countless friends he held in the highest regards. Matt was preceded in death by his two brother-in-laws, Rod Wallace and Chris Fairchild, two king cavaliers: Duke and Ruby McCoy. His family will greet friends from 12 – 3 pm on Saturday, December 10, 2022, at the Marion Country Club, 2415 Crissinger Rd, Marion. A celebration of life service will follow thereafter at 3 pm, led by family and friends sharing their favorite Matt McCoy stories. Burial will take place at a later date in Marion Cemetery.

He was a dynamic and charismatic man who left an indelible impression on most people he met. “Georgie,” as he was affectionately referred to by a former Columbus, Ohio mayor, was short in stature but lived a big life defined by his eccentric style and a curiosity that fueled many interesting adventures. Born and raised in Erie, PA, he trained homing pigeons as a youth to carry messages to his friends. When he wasn’t training pigeons, he was impeccably dressed and was honored as “Best Dressed” at East Lake High School. While attending Gannon University, he sharpened his charismatic skills as a member of the Alpha Pi Kappa fraternity and met Kathryn Jane Lynch of Athens, PA, who became his wife in 1963. Upon his graduation, the young couple moved to Columbus, where George explored a career in car sales. This career path ended in spectacular style when he decided to test the limits of a Jaguar XKE. That joy ride resulted in a speeding ticket for driving 132 mph—a record that made the local papers and was only recently broken. Fortunately, most of his passions resulted in making this world a better place. He is most proud of his four children and five grandchildren. He is survived by his children Colleen O’Donnel (Millersport, OH), George O’Donnel IV (Kalamazoo, MI), Sheilah O’Donnel and her husband Matt Stearns (Chevy Chase, MD and her three children, Lauren Eisel, Ryan Eisel and Sarah Eisel) and Bridget O’Donnel and her husband Eric Roverud (New Albany, OH and her two children, Anna Whetzel and Elizabeth Roverud). He was predeceased by his wife of 42 years, Kathryn. Beyond his children, his life was defined by the sheer joy he took in it, with his love of nature the greatest among his many passions and hobbies. As a committed naturalist, he spent many years kayaking and studying Buckeye Lake water quality and it was through this that he met the love of his life and partner, Karen Fell, who also survives him. During his nearly 60 years in Central Ohio, he created an extensive, eclectic community, from his early love of running and the many clubs that he threw himself into: Shamrock Club, Buckeye Lake for Tomorrow, and Bike Buckeye Lake. Most recently, he was deeply involved in restoring Historic Air Terminal for the Ohio Air and Space Hall of Fame and Learning Center. When he wasn’t leading various clubs and working as a commercial real estate broker at Arshot Investments for the past 20 years. He was also a devoted athlete. He ran the inaugural Columbus Marathon in 1978 and many more, including Erie Presque Isle Marathon and the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, DC. Almost everything he did was defined by his desire to be physically fit and his love of perpetual movement. George’s final wish was to donate his body to the Ohio State University for research. George O’Donnel was predeceased by his parents: George T. O’Donnel II and Annabelle Avril O’Donnel (Erie, PA) and he was also survived by his four siblings: Sharon Ward (Pembroke Pines, FL), Mary and Jeff Jewitt (Ft. Myers, FL), Dennis O’Donnel (Flint, MI) and Diane O’Donnel (Buffalo, NY). A celebration of life for friends, family and acquaintances will be held on October 15, 2022, from 2-5 pm at Buckeye Lake Yacht Club, 5019 North Bank Rd., Buckeye Lake, Ohio. Bring stories and memories to share. Anyone so inclined should feel welcome to make donations in George’s memory to Buckeye Lake for Tomorrow at buckeyelakefortomorrow.org.\n\nRoman W.

Many hours were spent drifting in secluded coves or seeing just how many skiers could be pulled behind 1 boat. Family vacations included trips around the state and country for appraisal conventions or historical nature – museums and forts! We saw nearly every fort on the eastern coast. Later in life, John and Shirley traveled in their motorhome to Florida, California and even took the coach on a train into Mexico.

Monica, the third of three children, was born to the late Robert Edward Jenkins of Springfield Ohio, and Tosca Lajoise Deppe of Cedarville, Ohio on April 26, 1949. A Time to Learn: The family relocated to Columbus, Ohio when Monica was a young girl. She began her education at St. Dominic’s Grade School and later at East High School where she was a Majorette, a member of the Concert Band, and a member of the Student Court. A Time to Love: There she met her high school sweetheart Paul W. Stith. From their union were born Kara (Andrew Terry) and Tamara (Rudolph Lynch). Thirteen years later her love journey led her to Ron H. Williams. This loving relationship bore Burman C. Williams (Fiancée Jessica Carpenter). A Time to Grow: After high school, Monica attended Franklin University and held various positions including modeling but found her greatest passion in Real Estate in 1974. A Time to Work: Monica began her Real Estate career in August of 1974 at First Associated Brokers. Here she gained viable experience in Residential, Investment, and Commercial properties. Because of her devotion to learning and growing in her knowledge of real estate, which continued up until her untimely death, she developed an extensive real estate profile. Consequently, in August of 1986 Monica became an independent broker and M. L. Sales and Associates was born. Over the course of Monica’s real estate career, she received numerous certifications, recognitions, and awards. Monica had deep compassion for her community. One of the first of many examples of this includes a time when she rented a passenger van to take a group of the neighborhood kids to Kings Island and Cedar Point for a summer day trip. Monica also organized a drill team in order to participate in a 4th of July parade. Monica volunteered at Mifflin High School as the drill team coach as well as organized the community festival at St Dominic Church. As beautiful and graceful as she was, Monica wouldn’t hesitate to roll up her sleeves and get her hands dirty. That was evident when she diligently worked to promote the Livingston Ave clean-up on July 22, 1987. This initial drive to improve the community and to take pride in the place that you live continued to local parks and recs like Driving Park. The last clean-up effort that she took part in was held in September 2021. Monica also took pride in the work that she did with volunteer ventures at Saint Dominic’s. As mentioned before, she organized summer festivals and most recently, cleaned up the garden. The clean-up of the Garden was also an opportunity for ex-offenders to complete required Community Hours. Those Waiting in Heaven. A Time to Mourn: On July 16, 2022, Monica was ushered in and returned to her Creator. We celebrate her life as we mourn for such a loss to each one of our lives and souls. She leaves to cherish her memory, her sister Tosca (Tommy) Jackson, sister by choice Karen Thomas; grandchildren Gianni Lynch (fiancée Tamia Odimegwu), Reyadh (JaNiyah) Lynch, Jeremiah Williams, Kaya Terry and Jediah Lynch, and Amyah Holloway; great-grandchildren: Atavion, Gi Niyah, Kaden, Gianni Jr, and Baby Royce and a host of loved ones too numerous to mention here. A Time to Reflect: As we look back on the life and the legacy of Monica L. Stith, we know she was a hard-working woman who loved her family and her friends. There was nothing she wouldn’t do for them within her power. We loved everything about you and will miss everything about you. Your sparkle and bling, only you could wear festive hats, and pull it off and still look like a diva! We thank you for instilling in us hard work, perseverance, the importance of giving back to your community, and most importantly never giving up! We promise to “Keep It Movin.
