        "text": "From the museum website, 18 February 2014\n\nVirtuosity on a miniature scale: 12 March 2014 an exquisite exhibition opens in the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum: the first exhibition dedicated to the Dutch master draughtsman Johannes Thopas. Thopas, born in Arnhem, is known predominantly for his small-scale portraits and miniatures, drawings on parchments of an extremely high quality. Buyers even treated them as paintings: they were framed and hung on the walls of their homes. Around 70 works by Thopas are still known today. In Aachen, around 40 drawings and 1 painting will be on view.\n\nLoans come from important collections such as the Albertina in Vienna, the Fonadtion Custodia in Paris and the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Brussels."
