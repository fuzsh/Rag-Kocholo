Taking an interest in classical antiquity, in recent developments in Renaissance Italy, and in the novel inventions of the Germans Albrecht Diirer and Conrad Meit, he was able both to emulate the intricate splendor of Jan van Eyck and to create pictures of an intense originality that deserve wider recognition. The first and only monographic exhibition of Gossart’s paintings, drawings, and prints took place in Rotterdam and Bruges forty-five years ago. There has never been an exhibition in the United States devoted to him, even though a number of his most important works are housed in American collections. Renewed interest in the artist and original scholarship concerning various aspects of his oeuvre have pointed to the need for a reappraisal of his accomplishments. Maryan Ainsworth, Curator in the Department of European Paintings at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, took up the challenge, conceiving this exhibition and editing the catalogue. She dealt primarily with the paintings, studying the majority of them for the first time through technical examination, and reexamining the others. She recruited a number of colleagues to work with her, among them Stijn Alsteens and Nadine Orenstein, Associate Curator and Curator, respectively, in the Department of Drawings and Prints at the Metropolitan; Stephanie Schrader, Associate Curator in the Department of Drawings at The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; and Ethan Matt Kavaler, Associate Professor in the Department of Art at the University of Toronto. Early on, Susan Foister, Director of Collections at the National Gallery in London, expressed keen interest in organizing a slightly different version of the exhibition for the National Gallery, which is, of course, the perfect partner, not only because nine of Gossart’s paintings are housed there (including one on loan from H.R.H. Queen Elizabeth II and another from a private collection) but also because of the\n\nwarranted that would update Sadja Herzog’s 1968 monograph. Although it is highly unusual for the Metropolitan Museum embark on a project of this sort, the importance of Gossart’s contribution to early Netherlandish painting and the realization that there was so much more to be learned about him convinced us of the necessity to carry out a thorough study of his works. These efforts required considerable cooperation from many colleagues at other museums, who are thanked in the Acknowledgments. Such an in-depth reappraisal of Gossart could not even have been imagined without the extraordinary generosity of our colleagues at numerous institutions and of private collectors who agreed to lend their treasures to the two venues of our exhibition. This remarkable expression of support has resulted in a highly representative view of Gossart’s accomplishments in panel paintings, drawings, and prints, all reconsidered in the context of his artistic milieu. The generous funding of the exhibition has allowed us to bring Gossart’s oeuvre to our viewing public in the best way possible. In New York, we are especially grateful to the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, the Gail and Parker Gilbert Fund, the Flemish Government through Flanders House New York, the Society of Friends of Belgium in America, The Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation, Hester Diamond, David Kowitz, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, Joyce P. and Diego R.Visceglia, and the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities. In London, we wish to thank the Flemish Government for their support. For sponsoring the publication of this catalogue, the Mary C. and James W. Fosburgh Publications Fund, the Roswell L. Gilpatric Publications Fund, and the Doris Duke Fund for Publications at the Metropolitan Museum all deserve recognition and our sincere gratitude.\n\nin-house expertise of Lorne Campbell, George Beaumont Senior Research Curator, who generously shared his knowledge of the National Gallery's paintings, including his important unpublished research, and agreed to write a number of the\n\nThomas\n\ncatalogue entries. It had been clear from the start that, in addition to an exhibition, a new catalogue raisonné of the artist's oeuvre was\n\nto\n\nP.\n\nCampbell\n\nDirector The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nNicholas Penny Director The National Gallery, London\n\nDirectors’ Foreword\n\nv1\n\nAcknowledgments The idea of an exhibition on Jan Gossart was first proposed to Philippe de Montebello, Director Emeritus, in 2007. It is to Philippe that I owe enormous gratitude, not only for approving an exhibition about an artist not well known in America but also for agreeing from the outset that there was a need for catalogue raisonné on Gossart and that we should do it. Encouraging support for this plan came early on from Everett Fahy, John Pope-Hennessy Chairman of the Department of European Paintings; Mahrukh Tarapor, Associate Director for Exhibitions; and John P. O'Neill, Publisher and Editor in Chief, all of whom retired in 2009. As a different administrative team took over, newly appointed Director Thomas P. Campbell enthusiastically embraced the plans for a Gossart exhibition and monograph, even at a time of considerable economic challenge for the Museum, and for this I am extremely thankful. Keith Christiansen, John Pope-Hennessy Chairman of the Department of European Paintings, and Jennifer Russell, Associate Director for Exhibitions, provided sage advice and continued encouragement when it was most needed. From July 2008 throughout the transitional period, Martha Deese, Senior Administrator for Exhibitions and Internal Affairs, expertly facilitated loan requests. George Goldner, Drue Heinz Chairman of the Department of Drawings and Prints, lent us two of his curators for the project, Stijn Alsteens and Nadine Orenstein, to research Gossart’s drawings and prints, respectively, and to contribute the essays and catalogue entries on these aspects of Gossart’s oeuvre. a\n\nWhen we began this project, valuable new studies on Gossart were under way or had just been completed. Among the scholars involved in this innovative research were Stephanie Schrader\n\nand Ethan Matt Kavaler, whom we invited to provide essays on their most recent work, namely, on the impact of Philip of Burgundy's patronage on Gossart’s artistic development and on a fresh understanding of Gossart’s depiction of parallel architectural styles—Late High Gothic and antique—in his paintings. This has been an exceptional team, and to each one of them I offer sincere thanks for stimulating conversations and fine contributions to this volume. In the early planning stages of the project, Susan Foister, Director of Collections at the National Gallery in London, expressed interest in providing a second venue for the exhibition, and we are most grateful that Nicholas Penny, Director, endorsed the proposal. The National Gallery holds a vill\n\nJAN GOSSART'S RENAISSANCE\n\nsignificant concentration of Gossart paintings, and Lorne Campbell, George Beaumont Senior Research Curator, graciously agreed to contribute to the catalogue. We are enormously appreciative of the National Gallery’s cooperation on both the exhibition and the catalogue, and especially for the many fruitful exchanges with their excellent staff. To the extraordinary team of collaborators who facilitated the technical study of Gossart’s paintings at the National Gallery—especially to Susan Foister, Lorne Campbell, and Rachel Billinge—I offer my heartfelt thanks. We had planned from the beginning to include the documents related to Gossart’s life and works as an appendix to the catalogue. However, as the book grew in size, we made the practical decision to produce a second companion volume, Jan Gossart: The Documentary Evidence, which Johan van der Beke of Brepols Publishers in Turnout, Belgium, enthusiastically agreed to publish. My sincere thanks go to Sytske Weidema, who compiled the existing documents, made new transcriptions of many and added to the already published ones, and prepared the manuscripts for publication. The volume will also contain two essays by Anna Koopstra on the documentary evidence for the so-called Salamanca Triptych and Gossart’s lost Middelburg Altarpiece. The preparations for this catalogue raisonné involved the new technical investigation of as many of Gossart’s paintings as possible, as well as a firsthand study of the drawings and prints. Museums with a particular concentration of paintings by the artist were especially generous with their time, expertise, and facilities in working with me during my repeated visits to their paintings conservation departments. That I was able to carry out this research is a result of the Metropolitan Museum's long and deep relationships with the staff at these institutions. In addition to those at the National Gallery in London, I particularly want to single out colleagues at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the Gemaldegalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, Brussels; the Musée du Louvre, Paris; and the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, for extraordinary access to the many Gossart paintings in their care. The technical examinations they facilitated enabled us to reach new conclusions about thorny questions of attribution and dating in Gossart’s oeuvre. These highly valued colleagues, and others who subsequently provided additional technical\n\ndocumentation, are gratefully acknowledged here: Clare Barry, Rachel Billinge, Igor Borodin, Tom Branchick, Meta Chavannes, Sue Ann Chui, Héléne Desplechin, Tiarna Doherty, Kate Duffy, Jill Dunkerton, Michael Eder, Myriam Eveno, Andras Fay, Catherine Fondaire, Pascal Fraiture, José de la Fuente, Carmen Garrido Pérez, Joseph Godla, Maria Jess Gomez Garcia, Ana Gonzalez Mozo, Martina Greisser, Suzanne Hargrove, Anne Harmssen, Jefferson Harrison, Babette Hartwieg, Scott Heffley, Ingrid Hopfner, Larry Keith, S.

My sincere apologies for any inadvertent omissions to this list. We also owe special thanks to Peter Klein, who agreed to contribute his findings on the dendrochronology of Gossart’s panels, which he has studied over the years and more recently supplemented. Enormously beneficial discussions that led to new conclusions about Gossart’s working methods were also conducted with our own Metropolitan Museum of Art staff members in the Departments of Paintings Conservation, Paper Conservation, Objects Conservation, and Scientific Research, namely, Michael Gallagher, Karen Thomas, George Bisacca, Michael Alan Miller, Sarah Kleiner, Cynthia Moyer, Marjorie Shelley, Jack Soultanian, Silvia Centeno, and Mark Wypyski. George Bisacca helped at every stage of the planning for this exhibition, advising about the treatment, packing, and safe transport of the many panel paintings coming to New York. He was also a constant source of information concerning Gossart’s panel and frame construction. Special thanks go to Michael Gallagher and Karen Thomas, each of whom restored at the Museum Gossart paintings from the Szépmivészeti Mizeum in Budapest and the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp. We are most grateful that these institutions allowed us to carry out the cleaning and restoration of these extraordinary paintings. Likewise, we are particularly pleased to acknowledge Jill Dunkerton and Britta New at the National Gallery, London; Catherine Metzger at the National Gallery of Art, Washington,\n\nD.C.; Petria Noble at the Mauritshuis, The Hague; and Paolo Pastorello, working for the Palazzo Abatellis at the Galleria Regionale della Sicilia in Palermo, all of whom restored Gossart paintings for the exhibitions in New York and London and so generously discussed their technical findings with me. This new research led to a refinement of Gossart’s oeuvre and to a more precise evaluation of what would constitute our exhibition loan list. We sincerely thank all our colleagues at the many museums who agreed to lend the rare treasures in their collections, as well as other colleagues who provided key information about works both by Gossart and by other artists that illustrate points of comparison, thus providing the context for Gossart’s achievements.

Carmen Bambach must be singled out for her unfailing efforts in helping to achieve one of our most important loans and for discussing the working methods of Italian Renaissance artists with me. Anna Koopstra, our Slifka Foundation Interdisciplinary Research Scholar, worked tirelessly with me over the last two years on so many aspects of the Gossart research and exhibition preparation that it is difficult to thank her properly for all that she has contributed. Without her collaboration, the catalogue and the exhibition certainly would not be as rich as they are. Meredith Nelson and Peggy Ebner helped with a variety of administrative duties for the exhibition and catalogue. Jennifer Meagher and Gretchen Wold ably prepared the United States Government Indemnity, and Ellen Leszynski handled our Immunity from Seizure application. Carol Lekarew and Ling\n\nHu oversaw the organization of all of our Gossart images on the MediaBin database. Without the steady assistance of Dorothy Kellett, Patrice Mattia, and Andrew Caputo in the Department of European Paintings and Elizabeth Zanis in Drawings and Prints, we surely would have veered off course. In addition, we express our sincere appreciation for the tireless efforts of the staffs of the Thomas J. Watson Library at the Metropolitan Museum and the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie in The Hague for their willingness to further our research in every way, and particu-\n\nlarly to provide easy access to so many sources and documents, old and new. A catalogue of this complexity cannot be realized without\n\nthe contributions of our esteemed colleagues in the Editorial Department. Gwen Roginsky, Acting Publisher and Editor in\n\nChief, expertly oversaw the catalogue through its many stages to publication, and we owe her our profound gratitude. We were especially blessed to have as our editor Margaret Donovan, who was ably assisted by Nancy Grubb, Dale Tucker, and Ellyn Allison. Together, they polished our prose and saved us from countless errors. Jayne Kuchna expertly handled the Herculean task of bibliographer and was helped in this task by Penny Jones. Bruce Campbell provided another of his classic, exquisite book designs; he never fails and he never disappoints. Without Chris Zichello and Robert Weisberg, the images and texts would not have proceeded through the design and production phases in such a timely fashion. Juan Trujillo and Mark Morosse photographed, respectively, the newly restored paintings and the works on paper for the catalogue. We were especially pleased when Jan Martens, publisher of Mercatorfonds, Belgium, offered to\n\npublish the catalogue in Flemish and French translations and are delighted that it will now reach a larger audience abroad. With the book in hand, we turned our attention to the accompanying exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum. Kirstie Howard in the Office of the Senior Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel, expertly guided us through all legal matters to achieve signed contracts. Museum Registrar Aileen Chuk gave invaluable advice at key points concerning specific loan issues, and Nina Maruca, our ever able and completely unflappable registrar for the exhibition, ensured that the objects would arrive on time. Caitlin Corrigan and Lisa Cain assisted with arrangements for incoming and outgoing works for the exhibition. Linda Sylling masterfully oversaw the budgetary matters, design, and installation. To all of them we are enormously grateful. We could not have been more pleased to work with Dan Kershaw and Sue Koch, our exhibition designers. Special thanks are owed to George Bisacca and Michael Alan Miller for their expert advice and handling of the installation of the many panel paintings. The works in the show were skillfully mounted by collections managers, technicians, and installers from several different departments, including Fred Caruso, Matthew Cumbie, David del Gaizo, Bill Gagen, Theresa KingDickinson, Gary Kopp, John McKanna, Fred Sager, Denny Stone, and Jenna Wainwright. Clint Ross Collier and Richard Lichte provided the lighting design. Pam Barr expertly edited the exhibition labels, and John Muldowney, Joseph Smith, and Andrey Kostiw produced them for the installation.\n\nFinancial help was, of course, vital to such an ambitious project. Nina McN. Diefenbach, Christine S. Begley, Andrea Kann, Allison Sawczyn, and Thomas Reynolds of the Development Office provided expert guidance and assistance in this regard. Peggy Fogelmann, Joseph Loh, Stella Paul, Nancy Thompson, Chris Noey, and Kathryn Galitz helped to plan and coordinate our multifaceted educational programs. Sofie Andersen and Vivian Gordon expertly produced our inspired Antenna Audio guide for the exhibition. Elyse Topalian and Mary Flanagan of the Communications Department handled our publicity and press inquiries with great aplomb. In this time of economic challenge, we are grateful to the community of Belgians in New York, especially to Ambassador Herman Portocarero, Consul General of Belgium, for their great interest and support of this exhibition in so many ways from the beginning. To Thomas Leysen, Frangois M. de Visscher, Beatrice Vornle von Haagenfels, and Linda Edwards, we owe our special thanks. We could not have gone forward without the generous contributions of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, the Gail and Parker Gilbert Fund, the Flemish Government through Flanders House New York, the Society of Friends of Belgium in America, The Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation, and the Samuel H. Kress Foundation. In addition, other foundations and individuals have generously helped us to achieve our initial vision of an exceptional exhibition and catalogue. To Hester Diamond, David Kowitz, and Diego R. and Joyce P.Visceglia, we are deeply indebted. Maryan W.

Ainsworth\n\nn a comparison with the greatest painter of antiquity, Jan Gossart was repeatedly acknowledged as “nostrae aetatis Apellem” (the Apelles of our age). This praise first appeared in two separate texts of 1516 and 1529 by Philip of Burgundy’s court poet and humanist, Gerard Geldenhouwer.' Dominicus Lampsonius’ encomium 1572 (fig. 1) identified the artist as the one who taught his century how to paint with a meticulously fine finish reminiscent of Apelles and who displayed a mastery unequaled in his own time.” Lodovico Guicciardini (1567), Giorgio Vasari (1568), and Karel van Mander\n\nof\n\nof Gossarts art and credited him with being the first to bring from Italy to the North the art of depicting historie and poesiec with nude figures.” The (1604) all described the themes\n\nFlemish historians Marcus vanVaernewijck (1568) and Johannes Molanus (1582) likewise acknowledged his extraordinary fame as a\n\npainter.”\n\nChief among the scanty remains of comments by contem-\n\nporary artists concerning Gossart’s reputation is Albrecht Diirer’s critique. In December 1520, while on his trip to the Netherlands, Diirer recorded in his journal that he had stopped to see the Middelburg Altarpiece, which Van Mander was later to acknowledge as “his most important and famous [work].”” According to a local chronicler, Diirer was duly impressed and remarked that he had seen nothing comparable in the Low Countries,” but he candidly noted that it was “not as good in design as in painting.” Van Mander provided a rough sketch of Gossart’s life, reported the location of some of his most important works, boasted of his remarkable skills at illusionistic effects in his paintings, and admitted that although Gossart was most disorderly and irregular in his life, the reverse was true when he took brush to panel.” This admiration for Gossart and the intriguing notices of his works from Diirer and Van Mander make it all the more frustrating that there are so few remaining documents of specific commissions that can be linked to extant paintings.” However, a number of signed drawings and prints as well as signed and dated paintings (see my essay on Gossart’s artistic milieu in this volume) provide the linchpins for reconstructing the attributions and the chronology of Gossart’s oeuvre. The incomplete record of his career and what remains Johannes Wierix, Mabuse, from Dominicus Lampsonius, Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae inferioris effigies, 1572. Engraving, H. 12% 1n. (32 cm). Ryksmuseum, Amsterdam (RP-P-0B-67.049) Opposite: Fig.\n\nof the paintings, drawings, and prints suggest that he depended upon the pensions he received through his attachment to various court patrons and that he augmented this fixed income with outside commissions. Gossart worked most of his professional career as a court artist, first for Philip of Burgundy, subsequently for Philips great-nephew Adolf of Burgundy (who was Admiral of Zeeland and later Marquis, or Lord, of Veere), and finally for Mencia de Mendoza, the wife of Henry III, Count of Nassau-Breda. He also fulfilled requests\n\non occasion for Emperor Charles V, Archduchess Margaret of Austria, and King Christian II of Denmark. These close connections to the court were responsible for the fact that he produced designs for works in other media and for special events as well as paintings (see Stijn Alsteens’ essay in this volume). Gossart, perhaps inspired by Diirer’s visit to the Netherlands, also dabbled in printmaking (see Nadine Orenstein’s essay in this volume). The scarcity of accounts relating to Gossart’s personal life has led to much speculation about the artist's appearance and particularly about whether any of his paintings and drawings\n\n1.\n\nFig. 2. Hans Schwarz(?), Medallion with portrait Sforzesco, Gabinetto Numismatico, Milan (1226)\n\nof Gossart,\n\n1520s. Castello\n\nsimply\n\na reference to his self-identification with the patron saint\n\nof painters; Lukes head does not bear any resemblance to the other proposed portraits of the artist. Heinrich Schwarz sug-\n\ngested that the Currier Museum Portrait of a Man (cat. 46) and Adam in Gossart’s paintings and drawings of Adam and Eve also represent the artist.”> Schwarz saw Gossart’s identification with his erotically charged Adam figures as a reflection of his own dissolute life, as recounted in Van Mander’ short biography.\" H. van Halls 1963 publication provided a list of eleven selfportraits in Gossart’s works, a compilation based more on fantasy than reality.\"\n\nA few examples of possible self-portraits may be taken more seriously, however. Herzog suggested the Moscow Portrait of a Man as a candidate (fig. 3, cat. 41),\"\" and the sitter in that work is closer in appearance to Gossart in the Wierix print and the\n\nto his unusually long, flat nose with large nostrils. Friedlinder proposed another possible sighting of the painter in Lucas van Leyden’s 1525 engraving The Poet Virgil Suspended in a Basket (fig. 4), which shows the very same fellow at its center and may well be an homage to Gossart by Lucas, who traveled with him in 1526—27.\"\" One of Lucas’s most elaborate prints, this work certainly shows the influence of Gossart’s types in the foreground.” Van Mander published the first biography of Gossart in his a consider1604 Het Schilder-Boeck.” While probably based able degree on hearsay, it does have the advantage of having been written closer to the time ofthe artists life than any other account. Subsequent discussions of Gossart, such as those by Joachim von Sandrart, Isaac Bullart,and Jean-Baptiste Descamps, were largely based on Van Mander and added little new.” The nineteenth century saw a flurry of activity in the archives that resulted in the discovery of new biographical details about Gossart.” But it was the 1902 Bruges exhibition “Les Primitifs flamands et d’art ancien,” which introduced early Netherlandish painting to the public for the first time, that provided the impetus for new monographs, such as the one by Maurice Gossart published in 1903 about his namesake.** This slim volume brought up to date all the known documents, and it was followed by Ernst Weisz’ 1913 book and Achille Segard’s 1923 mini-monograph that offered initial conclusions concerning Gossart’s works.” In the ensuing decades German scholars took the lead in publishing further insights into Gossart’s oeuvre, and thus emerged Friedlinder’s exemplary short essays on the artist’s life and works, accompanied bythe first important catalogue of the paintings and drawings.” In the scholarly literature ofthe late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the e shipped into the spelling of Gossart’s name and has stayed there stubbornly since, even though the artist never used the spelling Gossaert in any of his signed works. In this volume the originally appeared in Gossart’s name 1s restored to the way own time, medal, especially\n\nFig. 3.

This likeness was probably based on the only known portrait of the artist in his lifetime, an early sixteenthcentury medal (fig. 2) inscribed IO MALBODIVS PICTOR\n\nABIONIGRO GERMANOAD VIVVMEXPRESSVS\n\nMabuse Painter by I German Schwarz represented from life).\" But despite the identification of Hans Schwarz as the maker, recent scholarship questions the attribution of such medals from the late 1520s to the German, since he was by then deceased.” The only known version of the Gossart medal that exists todayis in the Castello Sforzesco, Gabinetto Numismatico, Milan.\" The Wierix portrait and the medal have both been used by modern scholars as the basis for the identification of selfportraits in Gossart’s paintings, drawings, and prints, but few of these can be maintained. The supposed self-portrait in the guise of Saint John the Baptist in the Toledo panel (cat. 244) relies on a misreading of Antonius Sanderus and, in any event, represents a typical John the Baptist type, not an individualized portrait. Although Gossart inscribed his name on the belt of Saint Luke in the Vienna Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin (cat. 12), this 1s (I\n\n4\n\nJAN GOSSART'S RENAISSANCE\n\nas\n\nto\n\nit\n\nCm — :\n\nR\n\n4s Ey Ta\n\n-\n\nEe\n\na\n\npo\n\nA Sa\n\n:\n\n{\n\nSE\n\nFig. 4.

The importance of the 1965 exhibition and the scholarly activities surrounding it cannot be overestimated, since these events laid the foundation for all subsequent work on the artist. Since the major contributions of the 1960s, Gossart scholarship has taken various twists and turns and been devoted to a smattering of diverse issues. The 1980s, in particular, saw a spate of articles on various matters such as the “Gothic Gossart,” his erotic nudes, and his innovative aesthetic approach, including incipient stages of Northern Mannerism.” Jos Sterk’s major 1980 study on Philip of Burgundy placed Gossart’s art for the first ime in the context of his principal patrons humanist courts at Souburg and Wijk bij Duurstede.”” Responding in part to Sterk’s study, scholars from the 1990s to the present have continued to debate the question of the meaning of Gossart’s erotic nudes—whether they were painted as moralistic warnas reflections of the carnal pleaings against sensual love™ sures advocated at court.”’ Two recent PhD dissertations, one by Ariane Mensger (subsequently published in 2002) and another by Stephanie Schrader in 2006, further probed a variety of issues relating to Gossart’s court art, mythological themes, and Eyckian archaism, among others.” Recognizing that stylistic preferences were often a deliberate political statement, Ethan Matt Kavaler, Krista de Jonge, and Mensger have delved into the coexistence of Late High Gothic and antique architectural styles, both in the Netherlands and specifically in\n\nor\n\nGossart’s works.”\n\nThe aim of the current monograph\n\na\n\nis a\n\nreappraisal\n\nof Jan\n\nGossart based on fresh, firsthand study of his works, including technical investigations of as many of the paintings as possible.* This endeavor has resulted in numerous discoveries about Gossart’s paintings, drawings, and prints, including how they were made, why they were made, and in some cases for whom\n\n6 Jan GOSSART'S RENAISSANCE\n\nthey were made. The recent technical examination of the paintings, facilitated by the collaboration of many museum conservators and conservation scientists, has provided new information for the first broad overview of Gossart’s working methods (see my essay on the subject in this volume). Questions of attribution and dating have been reconsidered, and as a result the oeuvre has been redefined, not only in terms of the number of accepted works but also in terms of their function. By accepting a larger number of drawings, Stijn Alsteens has broadened the view of Gossart as a draftsman, and Nadine Orenstein has offered the first serious consideration of Gossart as a printmaker. The opportunity for three scholars, specializing in different media, to collaborate on the study of Gossart’s oeuvre has raised new questions and culminated in new proposals. Gossart has been revealed to have mostly worked alone but to have collaborated with other artists, including Gerard David and various landscape painters, when the commission called for it. New emphasis 1s placed on the importance of Gossart’s sculptural approach, initiated certainly with his trip to Rome but powerfully sustained and more fully developed through his connection with another court artist, the sculptor Conrad Meit. Our revised view of Gossart has led to a deeper understanding ofhis simultaneous work 1n parallel styles (the “modern’ Late High Gothic and antique architectural modes) and of the fact that this was based on specific commissions rather than on a sequential chronological development from what had been perceived to be the earlier style to the newer, more advanced one. In this process, we have also come to terms with Gossart’s so-called Eyckian phase and recognized that it has been much overstated in the past. Only one of the Eyckian copies generally attributed to Gossart is by him, namely, the Deesis (cat. 29), and it comes much later in the artists career than has been supposed. In an effort to better understand Gossart’s works in their own time, we have presented discussions of several key issues that previously have not received due attention. Essays covering the Habsburg-Burgundian court milieu—specifically the role that Gossart’s dual modes of architecture played in various representations, the nature of his work for his main patron, Philip of Burgundy, and the deeper meaning of the mythological themes that he painted for humanist courts—aim to open new avenues for inquiry. Sensuality runs through Gossart’s paintings, drawings, and prints as a leitmotif. It is not restricted to mythological subjects, where it is a thinly veiled justification for a heightened eroticism, but pervades Gossart’s representations of Adam and Eve and the Virgin and Child as well. The\n\nttle of our monograph, Man, Myth, and\n\nSensual\n\nPleasures: Jan Gossart’s Renaissance, thus represents our focus on be the important facets of Gossart’s art in a what we deem\n\nhumanist era.\n\nto\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn a pamphlet printed on April 3, 1516, by Dirk Martens in Leuven, Geldenhouwer lauded Gossart's work on the pageant car of King Ferdinand of Aragon’s funeral\n\nXXVT EB); the two were cast back-to-back at an unknown date.

Ainsworth\n\nan Gossart’s fame in his own time was due not only to his\n\ninnovative images—Guicciardini, Vasari, and Van Mander all credited him with being the first to bring from Italy to the North the art of depicting historic and poesie with nude figures—but also to the fact that he advertised his achievements by signing so many of his works from the outset of his career.’ The significant number of signed drawings and prints and signed and dated paintings by Gossart also helps to reconstruct the artist's stylistic development from his earliest days in Antwerp to his final years of production. The inscriptions on his works evolved over time (fig. 6A—1), the pivotal point being his shift to the Latinized form Johannes Malbodius for the 1516 Neptune and Amphitrite. Most of Gossarts paintings are single panels, and nearly half are portraits, a genre in which he particularly excelled. It is clear that Jan was sought after for his extraordinary abilities to represent the lifelike appearance of individuals. Curiously, among the portraits that have survived, only a few depict women, the overwhelming number representing men of the courtly realm and upper levels of society. Despite the fragmentary remains of Gossart’s triptychs and diptychs (cats. 6, 7, 22—24A,B, 40, 55), these can be somewhat reconstructed by drawings of certain of the lost ones (see Stijn Alsteens’ essay in this volume and cats. 79, 90). Jan did not produce paintings of extended narratives, but instead devoted his attention to a limited variety of biblical and devotional themes, mostly those of Adam and Eve, the Virgin and Child, and episodes from the Passion of Christ. What is new to Northern art of the time is Gossart’s introduction of mythological themes with nude figures portrayed with heightened eroticism. These subjects and this approach allowed the artist to indulge his interest in the human body, to explore myriad possibilities for the interaction of figures, and to pursue an increasingly sculptural approach to them. These aspects of Gossart’s art were not limited to mythological themes, but played an important role in his paintings and drawings of Adam and Eve and the Virgin and Child. Although the more than sixty surviving Gossart paintings are all on panel, nearly a dozen references exist to works on canvas by the artist.” As none of these has survived, is impossible to imagine what they looked like, but some were clearly\n\nit\n\nOpposite: Fig.\n\n5. Jan\n\nGossart, Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin (detail\n\nof\n\ncat.\n\n12)\n\nin grisaille, as the descriptions for a Beheading of John the Baptist and an Adoration of the Magi indicate. The main center for canvas paintings during the period was Bruges, but they were also produced elsewhere, especially in Mechelen. By Gossart’s time, the noble class was collecting such works, and Margaret of Austria’s inventories of 1516 and 1524 list nearly\n\ntwo dozen examples.’ When the number of drawings by Gossart or closely connected to his style (see the Alsteens essay) 1s added to this group of paintings, the total is significant for a Netherlandish artist of the early sixteenth century. The drawings vary considerably in type from preparatory compositional drawings, to figural sketches, to drawings after Roman sculpture and monuments, to ricordi of Gossart paintings, to vidimi (presentation drawings), and so forth. Quite a number seem to have been made as independent works for discerning collectors, a new development the time. Oddly enough, not a single surviving drawing by Gossart can be associated directly with an extant painting by him. Yet evidence gained from the study of underdrawings in Gossart’s paintings clearly shows that there must have been preparatory sketches on paper that worked out the details of the compositions as well as cartoons used to transfer figural motifs to the prepared panels (see my essay on Gossart’s working methods in this volume).\n\nat\n\nBeginning Stages and Collaborative Endeavors\n\nBoth the manner in which Gossart signed his paintings and drawings and the early documents referring to him indicate that he came from Maubeuge, from which the Dutch name Mabuse is derived. Originally in the medieval county of\n\nHainaut, this small town was later ceded to France at the Peace of Nijmegen in 1678. Gossart was probably born about 1478,° all certain where he was trained.

Selection of signatures in works by Jan Gossart. The early signatures (A through D, from cats. 91, 84, 8, 69) are all variations of “Antwerp Jenni” or “Jenni Gossart.” The post-1516 signatures (F through I, from cats. 24, 44, 30, 35) appear in the Latin form “Joannes Malbodius Pingebat.” The prints (E, from cat. 112) show the letters IMS for “Johannes Malbodius Sculpsit.”\n\n10\n\nJaN GOSSART'S RENAISSANCE\n\nthereafter in Antwerp, except when certain patterns that belonged to Gossart were sold there in 1536, four years after his death.” This has led to speculation that Gossart died in Antwerp, a matter that cannot be confirmed by any other documentary evidence. Wherever Gossart trained, his earliest works express the Antwerp Mannerist style, of which he was a pioneer and key proponent in the first decade of the sixteenth century. This style is characterized by cluttered compositions, fantastic architecture, elegant, exaggerated poses of attenuated figures, swirling draperies, and excessive embellishments of all kinds.\" Several drawings, two of which are signed (see cats. 69, 91, and the Alsteens essay) date from this time, but curiously hardly any paintings can be proposed as coming from this period.” With such a conventional start to his career as a guild member in Antwerp, it is not easy to explain just how Gossart came to the attention of Philip of Burgundy, Admiral of Zeeland and the illegitimate son of Philip the Good. However this happened, the artist joined the delegation headed by Philip that traveled, at the request of Margaret of Austria, regent and governess of the Netherlands, to Pope Julius II in Rome. Philip and his entourage set out on October 26, 1508, and arrived in the Eternal City on January 14, 1509. Thus began Gossart’s rise to fame as possibly the first Northern artist who visited Rome to make drawings after antique sculpture and monuments, brought this new knowledge and style back to the North, and thus helped change the course of art in the Burgundian Netherlands. As Philips humanist court poet and historiographer Gerard Geldenhouwer so aptly put it in his 1529 biography of Philip: “Nothing pleased him [Philip] more when he was in Rome than those sacred monuments of antiquity which he commissioned the distinguished artist Jan Gossart of Maubeuge to depict for him.\" The essay “Drawing for Diplomacy” by Stephanie Schrader in this volume describes in detail the nature of the diplomatic mission to Rome and Gossart’s approach to recording the antique statues and monuments that he encountered there, and the entries by Stijn Alsteens on these drawings (cats. 99—102) further elucidate the impact of the Roman environment on Jan's stylistic development as a draftsman. What has not been considered previously 1s how the art that Gossart saw en route to Rome influenced his work. The diary of Marino Sanudo relates that the official delegation visited Trent, Verona, Mantua, and Florence, among other towns, and that they were sometimes entertained by high officials on those stops, as in Florence by the mayor, Piero Soderini.'’ The view of modern Italian painting and sculpture that Gossart was thus offered would have a long-lasting effect that can be seen in the works he produced after his return to the North. Perhaps he kept a sketchbook to record the poses of the little music-making angels in Mantegna’s San Zeno Altarpiece in Verona, which are echoed\n\nin his Virgin and Child with Musical Angels (cats. s, 6, fig. 125). Certainly, Florentine sculpture such as Verrocchios lifesize Doubting of Thomas of 1465-83 (see fig. 184), a revolutionary piece installed in an exterior niche of Orsanmichele, Florence, was still in his mind when he conceived the extraordinarily sculptural Saints John the Baptist and Peter, with their deeply cut draperies, stepping out of their Italian Renaissance niches in the Toledo wings (cat. 24A,8). Even smaller relief sculptures, such as Benedetto da Maiano’s Virgin and Child (see fig. 161),\n\nwere of a type that influenced Gossart’s increasingly sculptural approach to his many Virgin and Child compositions. Souvenirs from the trip, including Italian prints, small Renaissance bronzes, plaquettes, and even antique sculpture—such as the Roman busts of Caesar and Hadrian that Julius gave Philip'*—all provided him with visual material for his later works. The importance of Gossart’s encounter on this trip with sculpture, both antique and modern Italian, cannot be overestimated. Upon Gossart’s return from Rome in 1509, a Janin de Waele (Johnny the Walloon) was admitted to the Brotherhood of Our Lady in Middelburg,” the main city of the Island of Walcheren in Zeeland. Details of Gossarts biography support the claim that this individual was indeed Gossart himself. His brother Nicasius, an architect and engineer, also lived in the town,\" and Gossart married Margriet s Molders and raised three children (Gertruyd, Pieter, and an unnamed daughter) there.” Gossart must have decided to live in Middelburg because of its proximity to Souburg, where a castle of Philip of Burgundy, his most important patron, was located. Until undertaking his regular employment with Philip at Souburg in 1515-16,\" Gossart produced several paintings that were commissioned by individuals with close connections at court. These included Antonio Siciliano, chamberlain and secretary to Massimiliano Sforza, the Duke of Milan, who was sent in 1513 by the duke on a diplomatic mission to Margaret of Austria in Mechelen” and who commissioned the Doria Pamphil) Diptych and perhaps the Malvagna Triptych (cats. 6, 7A,B). Another was Daniel van Boechout, Lord of Boelare and Philip of Burgundy’ close friend and associate, who most likely commissioned The Adoration of the Kings for the chapel of Our Lady in the Sint-Adriaansabdij at Geraardsbergen, west of Brussels (cat. 8).\" Steppe mentions two other works of unknown date by Gossart for the same church, a Last Judgment for the chapel of Saint Natalia and a Crucifixion for the chapel of the Holy Trinity, of which no trace remains.\" During the same period, Gossart also painted the Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin for the chapel of the painters’ guild in SintRomboutskerk, Mechelen (cat. 9). In 1516, upon the death of Ferdinand of Aragon, Gossart was asked to provide designs for a triumphal chariot for the memorial procession in Brussels, and he subsequently accompanied Philip of Burgundy to the Gossart in His Artistic Milieu\n\nFig. 7. Jan Gossart and Gerard David, The Adoration of the Kings (detail of cat. 8)\n\nEe\n\ni A\n\nRP a) A LE\n\n-\n\nre\n\nceremonies.” While there, the artist made two now-lost portraits of Eleanor of Austria and performed other unspecified work at the request of the future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.*' Another commission came from Jean Carondelet, a member ofthe privy council in Mechelen, archdeacon the cathedral at Besan¢on, and later bishop of Palermo, as well as a colleague of Philip of Burgundy (who owned a terracotta portrait bust of him).” The Carondelet Diptych was painted by Gossart in 1517, the year that Carondelet set out with Charles on a trip to Spain (cat. 40). Although he must have had an atelier in Middelburg, there is no record that during this time Gossart ever established a\n\nof\n\nJAN GOSSART'S RENAISSANCE\n\na)LI AS po\n\n.\n\n3\n\n3\n\n-\n\n-\n\n.\n\nworkshop in the traditional sense with multiple assistants. He apparently used this location as his home base for what otherwise seems to have been a fairly peripatetic existence. Without the support ofa large workshop, it is not surprising that Gossart collaborated with other artists on various projects. For the Premonstratensian Abbey in Middelburg, Gossart painted his most important altarpiece, which sadly was destroyed byfire in 1568.7 Perhaps was through Gossart’s association with Philip that he received the commission from Abbot Maximilian of Burgundy, Philips nephew, for what Van Mander and Van Vaernewijck describe as a huge altarpiece with double wings.* A document, formerly in the archives of Reimerswaele, dated\n\nit\n\nFig. 8. Jan Gossart, Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin (detail of cat. 9)\n\naa\n\nCoAT\n\nrE\n\n.\n\nJanuary 24-25, 1568, states that Gossart had spent fifteen years “2 a period of time that suggests he working on the altarpiece,” did in fact work alone. It is more likely, however, that the work took place between 1518 and 1520, that 1s, after Maximilian became abbot of the Premonstratensian Abbey in 1518 and before Diirer saw the altarpiece in 1520-21 on his trip to the Netherlands. This 1s when Diirer famously described as “not as good in design as in painting.’** In his biography of Jan Mostaert,Van Mander writes that the painter was asked to collaborate with Gossart on the Middelburg altarpiece, but declined.”” Just what role Gossart had in mind for Mostaert, who was then working in the circle of Margaret of Austria's\n\nit\n\n=\n\n7\n\ncourt in Mechelen, is not known. Although little more than hearsay, Van Manders statement of collaboration on a very large altarpiece is the only written mention of a working prac-\n\ntice that can be supported through new technical examination of other Gossart paintings made about the same time. Middelburg is not far from Bruges, and it has often been observed that Gossart’s paintings and drawings from about 1509—15 reflect the influence of Gerard David, the leading master of Bruges at that time, who was about a decade older. As discussed in detail in the texts on the individual paintings (cats. 5-8), recent technical investigation now demonstrates that it was not so much a matter of influence as of collaboration Gossart in His Artistic Milieu\n\n[3\n\nbetween two artists of equal stature. For example, Gossart’s authorship of the Doria Pamphilj Diptych has not been universally accepted, but it is usually the right panel and not the left that comes into question (see cat. 7A,B). It has now become clear that the left panel, the Virgin and Child in the Church, was actually painted by David, and the right panel was executed by Gossart, who provided the figures, and a landscape specialist. David also collaborated with Gossart on the Malvagna Triptych and The Adoration of the Kings (see cats. 6, 8). This explains why the Virgin and Child figures in the Adoration and in the Prague Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, which were painted about the same time, appear so different stylistically as well as in terms of painting technique (compare figs. 7 and 8). In every one of these collaborations, David contributed the portions for which he had earned his fame and specific artistic identity: the beautiful, refined Virgin and Child figures and the comely faces of female saints, which by the 1510s had become the staple of his production for open market sale in Bruges and Antwerp. In 1515 David joined the painters’ guild in Antwerp in order to have the privilege of selling pictures—mostly of the Virgin and Child—in this highly developed, competitive market, which by then had surpassed that of Bruges.” David's other specialization, intimate landscape scenes, was called upon for the Malvagna Triptych, especially for the Garden of Eden on the outside wings.” Whether the contracts for these works stipulated David’s participation for the figures of the Virgin and Child and the female saints as well as the landscapes 1s not known, as there are no surviving documents. That Gossart signed both the Malvagna Triptych and The Adoration of the Kings perhaps indicates that he was the artist who had received the commission and subcontracted David to do his part. Such collaborations are not always well documented, but they certainly existed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in the Netherlands. Hubert and Jan van Eyck’ collaboration on the Ghent Altarpiece is perhaps the earliest and most famous example, although questions remain about the exact contribution of each painter. During Gossart’s time, among the bestknown collaborations was that between the landscape painter Joachim Patinir and the figure painter Quinten Metsys on the Prado Temptation of Saint Anthony, which Patinir alone signed. Such arrangements, while still understudied,” have received more attention of late owing to increased investigations both of early Netherlandish painting techniques and of the organization of workshops in various towns. “Prestige collaboration,” the term coined for this type of cooperation between painters of equal stature on the same painting,” is much better known in paintings of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth century. The association of Jan Brueghel the Elder and Peter Paul Rubens, among others, has been acknowledged for some time but has been reevaluated only recently in light of new technical examination.™ In this case, it was not Rubens—the painter 14\n\nJAN GOSSART'S RENAISSANCE\n\nwhom most consider today as the more renowned—but Brueghel who signed three of the Five Senses, the collaborative series for which the two are best known.* A precedent for collaboration in Bruges developed earlier on in the fifteenth century in the field of manuscript illumination, which depended on the contribution of illuminators from different workshops on the same book.* Gerard David himself was often called upon to add individual figures or heads and hands to the most important books of the day. The practice of one artist adding the heads and hands of figures to the work of another has also been recognized recently in early sixteenthcentury panel paintings, for example, one by the Master of the Embroidered Foliage.>® Additionally, there is the infamous case of the Bruges painter Albert Cornelis. He was charged with violating the terms of his agreement to paint all the “naked parts” (the flesh of heads, hands, and perhaps feet) when he subcontracted work on the large Coronation of the Virgin of 1517-22 (Sint-Jacobskerk, Bruges).*” Collaboration and subcontracting were standard workshop practices in Bruges that took many different forms. Regarding “prestige collaboration,” how would the respective contributions of David and Gossart have been viewed? David, the older of the two, had by then secured his reputation as the painter par excellence of exquisite Virgin and Child paintings and serene, meditative landscapes for both local markets and export.” As the artist chosen to accompany Philip of Burgundy on a diplomatic mission to Rome in 1508-9, Gossart had certainly achieved a new status and fame. No doubt certain commissions came easily to him thereafter because of his prestigious connections at court. What seems to have gained him additional notice is that he knew well and could ably render architecture of both the “modern” Late High Gothic and antique styles in order to meet the stipulations of given commissions (see Matt Kavaler’s essay in this volume). Since his brother Nicasius was apparently an architect and engineer, and his wife, Margriet, came from a family of retable carvers, Gossart’s familiarity with architecture in various styles was perhaps gained through family connections. That he was simultaneously producing credible representations of architectural canopies in the “modern” Gothic style for the Malvagna Triptych and grand halls in the antique, or Italian Renaissance, style for the Prague Saint Luke—the latter on a monumental scale—testifies to his remarkable expertise in this area (cats. 6,9). Gossart’s adaptability in this regard was key to his success in garnering commissions and catering to the specific tastes\n\nof his patrons.\n\nAn homage to Gossart’s acknowledged abilities to render architecture in his paintings of the 1510s 1s found in the most\n\nimportant illuminated book of the\n\nthe Grimani Breviary (Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, Venice). Even though Gossart did not paint any of the illuminations in the book himself, his name—COSAR[T|—is emblazoned on the entabulature of day,\n\nMalvagna Triptych are seen in the borders of illuminations\n\nthroughout the Grimani Breviary.\" This connection with the Breviary places Gossart in direct association with the other painters and illuminators who were completing the then-unfinished book for the diplomat Antonio Siciliano in the 1510s, among them Gerard David and Simon Bening. David's participation was sought for key miniatures as well as for the addition of specific figures, heads, and hands to certain folios.\" Siciliano, whose coat of arms appears on folio 81, probably paid for the completion of the book in order to take it back to Venice and, according to Michiel, sell it to Cardinal Domenico Grimani.* If Siciliano also commissioned the Malvagna Triptych, as well as the Doria Pamphilj Diptych, then he could have been the one who, knowing David's specific contribution to the Grimani Breviary, asked for his provision of the Virgin and Child figures and heads of the female saints in the triptych (see cat. 6). There are two major reasons for the fact that the prestige collaboration between Gossart and David has remained undetected until now. Gossart’s signature on two of the three works in question—namely, the Malvagna Triptych and The Adoration of the Kings—effectively eliminated consideration that another artist participated. However, as indicated by the example of Patinir and Metsys, and even later of Brueghel and Rubens, was probably the artist who received the commission who signed the completed work. The second reason that this collaboration has been previously ignored is the relative inaccessibility for close technical study of both the Malvagna Triptych (in a regional museum in Palermo, Sicily) and the Doria Pamphilj Diptych (in the private apartments of the Doria family in Rome).” Once undertaken, such examinations led to new insights on the authorship of The Adoration of the Kings (see under cat. 8).* One may ask where is the documentary evidence of Gossart’s presence in Bruges in collaboration with David. As Peter Stabel recently discussed, the regulations of the Guild of Saint Luke in late medieval Bruges are ambiguous about the hiring of nonguild members from other cities or countries for work.** Artists who did not belong to the guild could be active under particular circumstances or with certain strict limitations, particularly in regard to selling on the open market. Considerable leeway was given when the artist was affiliated with the court of the duke or with his entourage of nobles and state officials. Gossart qualified on all these accounts, and for his work on a handful of paintings, he was apparently viewed as exempt from the guild rules. This is particularly noteworthy in the case of the\n\nit\n\nFigs. 9, 10.

Geldenhouwer records that Philip hired both Jacopo de’ Barbari, a court painter to Margaret of Austria in Mechelen, and Gossart to decorate his castle there with scenes depicting mythological nudes.* This likely occurred in 1515, for Gossart’s Neptune and Amphitrite, an obvious homage to Philip as admiral of the Burgundian fleet, is dated 1516 and signed for the first time in the Latinized form of the artists name, [OANNES MALBODIVS PINGEBAT (see cat. 30 and Stephanie Schrader’s essay on Gossart’s mythological nudes in this volume). The paintings de’ Barbari produced for this setting have not been identified, but it is possible that Gossart’s acquaintance with the Venetian not only offered a chance for discussions on the ideal construction of figures and on Albertian perspective, but also provided Gossart with additional source material for his own works by way of the Italians drawings and engravings. The opportunity must have been short-lived, however, for the old and feeble de’ Barbari died in 1516. After his election as bishop of Utrecht in May 1517, Philip moved to the episcopal chateau at Wijk bij Duurstede, some twenty-five kilometers outside of that town. Gossart apparently went with him and continued to paint mythological nudes for Philip and his humanist friends (see the Schrader essay previously mentioned and also cats. 30-34). Classical themes and nudes, per se, were not new to Northern art, having been represented in the previous century in tapestry, decorative arts, and manuscript illumination. According to Bartolomeo Fazio’s report in De viris illustribus (1456), women bathing—even secretly being ogled by young men—appeared in paintings by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden in Italian collections.*” Some secular works including “figures of great immodesty” made by “foreign” (most likely Flemish) artists and painted on cloth constituted the entire first tier of Savonarola’s famous Bonfire of the Vanities in Florence.” Although such themes may not necessarily have been new, Gossart’s treatment of them both in terms of a heightened eroticism and in the sometimes lifesize scale of the nudes was innovative in panel paintings. A mention of “Little Jan's room” in Philip of Burgundy’ inventory of the Duurstede castle®” suggests that Gossart had accommodations there, but whether he was in permanent residence or simply traveled back and forth to his family in Middelburg is not known. Philip apparently allowed the artist to accept commissions from other clients, and it is in this period that his erotic images of Adam and Eve, a series of Virgin and 16\n\nJAN GOSSART'S RENAISSANCE\n\nConrad Meit, Lucretia, 1500-1515.

Gossart occasionally worked as a consultant. In 1522 he was brought in by Philip to moderate a dispute between the Mechelen brasscaster Jan van den Eynde and the Antwerp wood-carver Gregorius Wellemans over the design for the rood screen for Utrecht Cathedral. The debate concerned the preferred style for the design, whether it should be in the antique or the “modern” Gothic mode. Gossart’s leaning in this matter is not known, and although the craftsmen were compensated, the rood screen was never built.* Gossart must also have spent time in Mechelen, where he was summoned in 1523 by Margaret of Austria to restore certain pictures in her collection and carry out other unspecified tasks.” When Gossart went to Mechelen on that occasion, he stayed with Conrad Meit, whom he must have met previously either through Philip or at Margarets court.” As early as 1512, Margaret wrote a letter making inquiries to an unnamed “cousin” about borrowing the services of his “good German master sculptor” to provide a stone portrait of her deceased second husband, Philibert II of Savoy.” Margaret furthermore mentions that this sculptor had been in the service of “my\n\ncousin the admiral,” who can most likely be identified with Philip of Burgundy, at that time admiral of the Burgundian naval fleet.™\n\nThe relationship between Meit and Gossart, which was extremely important for the evolution of Gossart’s sculptural approach to his paintings, has previously only been touched upon.” Meit became Margarets court sculptor sometime before 1514 and remained in that position until her death in 1530. He was principally responsible for important works for\n\nFig. 13. Jan Gossart, Virgin and Child (cat. 16)\n\nFig. 14. Conrad Meat, Virgin and Child, 1531-34. Marble, 24% x 23% x 117% 1n.

In connection with the latter commission, Meit went to Brou in 1524 and, along with assistants, executed the tomb sculptures there between 1526 and 1531.>° For her residence at Mechelen in particular, Meit made sculptures of mythological themes and a series of busts, both small, in boxwood, and large-scale, in marble and alabaster. Margaret displayed these in her library along with painted portraits, medallions, and even Philibert’ suit of armor, in order to allow for their mutual “interaction” and to enhance the sense ofthe lifelike presence of those represented.” Owing in part to their appointments at two humanist courts—those of Philip of Burgundy and Margaret of Austria—Gossart and Meit shared a common interest in mythological themes. Through his acquaintance with Meit, Gossart also came to share the German's sculptural approach toward these themes. It cannot be a coincidence that the figure, and especially the twist of the body, of Venus in Gossart’s 1521 Venus and Cupid (cat. 33) appears so similar to Meit’s boxwood Lucretia (compare figs. 11 and 12).>® Gossart may even have had such a sculpture in his studio, turning it around to find the desired angle of view, while preparing drawings for his painting. Meit and Gossart were also both intrigued by the textures offabrics, the heightened three-dimensionality of features such as braided or thick, curled locks of hair or draperies, and the smooth porcelain-like finish to flesh, especially that of the face. Such comparisons as Gossart’s Prado Virgin and Child with Meit’s Virgin and Child clearly demonstrate their affinity in this respect (see figs. 13,14). Meit’s busts, of large and small scale, were highly regarded. As Jens Ludwig Burk so aptly put it, “Regardless of size, both possess the same monumentality in conception and are characterized by the naturalistic and deceptively life-like quality of his depictions of the human body and face, and his meticulous rendition of the very different textures of skin.” During the same time that Meit was making sculpted portraits of Margaret, her beloved husband, Philibert, and other courtiers, Gossart was increasingly engaged with painting portraits of various sitters of social prominence. When viewed side by side, Meit’s sculptures and Gossart’s paintings express the same aesthetic Gossart in His Artistic Milieu\n\n17\n\nthe chapter of Pliny’s Natural History devoted to “Luxury Displayed in the Use of Various Kinds of Marble” (36.1.1) or of the colored marble slabs in Italian Renaissance tombs that he had seen in Rome, Gossart sometimes enhanced the precious nature ofthe portrait by placing trompe-l'oeil stone panels behind the sitters. In every way, but especially in his conception of them as figures in the round, Gossart’s painted portraits owe a debt to his artistic dialogue with Meit. The lifesize marble busts of Margaret of Austria and Philibert have not survived, but accounts of them have. Margaret kept them in her library, where they were shown visiting dignitaries such as Antonio de Beatis, Erasmus, and Diirer.”\" What has survived, namely, the Getty Head of a Man in the Antique Manner of about 1515—20, serves equally well as a comparison with Gossart’s Manchester and Antwerp portraits (figs. 16, 17, cats. 46, 47). The modeling of the heads of Gossart’s portraits—the particular juxtaposition of the flat planes and rounded forms ofthe face, the full, sensuous lips with pouches offlesh at the corners, the bold articulation ofthe nose and the deeply recessed, large eyes reflects the same aesthetic approach as that in Meit’s Head of a Man. Furthermore, the pose and expression of the Antwerp portrait, especially the twist ofthe torso so that the head and the body do not share the same axis, must be seen in comparison with Meit’s sculpture, particularly the portrait busts of Philibert II and Margaret (fig. 18A,8) and the Head of a Man in the Antique Manner, in which the heads twist in a opposing direction to the body in a new, expressive way. Meit and Gossart not only shared the same visual approach to their portraiture but also conceived ofthese works as having the same official function. The inventories of Margaret's belongings indicate that while Meit’s lifesize marble sculptures were displayed as official portraits in her library, the smaller boxwood portraits were kept in her private petit cabinet, which perhaps resembled an Italian Renaissance studiolo. The nature of the larger works 1s underscored by their description in official documents as representacions, while the smaller ones are discussed as portraicture.”® This classification helps to clarify the function of Gossart’s portraits as the official representations of his sitters. Although the original frames on many of his portraits are lost, one that remains, namely, that surrounding the Carondelet Diptych (cat. 40), states in its original inscription that this is the REPRESENTACION DE MESSIRE\n\nto\n\nHans Memling, Maria Maddalena Baroncelli, 1470.

The painted and the sculpted portraits further achieve a sense of verisimilitude, owing in Meit’s case to the choice of smooth white alabaster and marble (often\n\na\n\npolychromed)® and in Gossart’s to the painted simulation of polished marble surface for the heads of his sitters. Meit thus could be considered as a “painterly sculptor,” Gossart as a “sculptural painter.” At the outset of his career, Gossart’s portraiture was influenced by the works of two great Bruges artists, Jan van Eyck and Hans Memling. That his earliest portraits are indebted to Memling is clear from the London Mary Magdalen and the Toledo painting of Jean Carondelet (cats. 36, 39), in which the poses ofthe figures and the placement ofthe hands at the lower left corner of the composition are based on Memling’s formula (figs. 15, 216). Perhaps Gossart was most intrigued by his predecessors clever innovation of placing the trompe-I'oeil frame not around but behind the sitter, which caused the figure to be projected into the viewer's space, as in the Metropolitan Museum's portrait of Maria Baroncelli (fig. 15). He began to use this device, particularly for his portraits of members of the court and its circle. Almost invariably he placed the figures at a slight angle to the picture plane and before a framed, colored background (for example, cats. 48, 51, 57).

He was not at a loss for work, however, as his well-established connections at court continued to yield commissions. Gossart went to work for Philips great-nephew Adolf of Burgundy, Admiral of Zeeland and later Marquis of Veere. In Veere, according to Gossart in His Artistic Milieu\n\n19\n\nof Adolf’s wife, Anna\n\nYet Gossart most likely did not have a thriving workshop at this\n\nvan Bergen, and her son, probably Hendrik, as the Virgin and Child (cats. 37, 52). It may also have been in Veere, where the deposed King Christian II of Denmark had taken refuge, that Gossart received a commission to record the likenesses of Christian and his wife, Isabella of Austria; the print of Christian\n\ntime, as the extant works show a strong output of originals and a significantly low number of copies. Furthermore, most of these originals are of fairly modest size, not the type that would have required workshop assistance. Rather, from his return from Rome until well into the 1520s, Gossart seems to have worked with other artists only when the occasion called for it. As previously discussed, Van Mander stated that he tried to enlist the help of Jan Mostaert for the\n\nVan Mander, he painted the likenesses\n\nand the Lugt collection drawing of him for another print must have been made about the same time (cats. 111, 119, 120). Isabella died in 1526 after a long illness, leaving her husband and three children behind. Shortly thereafter, Gossart portrayed the children, perhaps at the request of Margaret ofAustria, who assumed the care of them in Mechelen (cat. 51). He also designed the tomb and epitaph for Isabella, is\n\ndated\n\n1525\n\nwho was buried in Ghent (cat. 108). In 1524, the year of Philips death, Henry III, Count of Nassau-Breda, married for the third time. His new wife, Mencia de Mendoza, Marchioness of Zenete, was the richest woman in Spain. Henry was chamberlain to Charles V and an extremely powerful individual in the Habsburg empire. The couple lived in Spain until 1530 and then sojourned in the Netherlands for three years at their castle in Breda, which they later totally revamped in the Italian Renaissance style under the guidance of Tommaso Vincidor.”” Even before his marriage, Henry had had an impressive art collection, which included such treasures of Earthly Delights (Museo del Prado, Madrid). It was Mencia, however, who became an insatiable collector of paintings, tapestries, illuminated manuscripts, metalwork, antique coins and gems, and sculpture. The couple probably met Gossart on their stay in the Netherlands, and he began to receive a regular stipend from Mencia, which was paid out four times a year from 1530 until his death in 1532.°* One painting listed in her 1533 and 1548 inventories as by “Joanyn de Marburg” is possibly the Cleveland Virgin and Child in a Landscape (cat. 20), and the Valencia Christ on the Cold Stone may also have been in her collection (cat. 28). The couple sat to Gossart for their portraits, but only copies remain, among which are miniatures by Simon Bening that are inscribed with their names and must present a close approximation of Gossart’s originals (cat. 61). as Bosch’s Garden\n\nThe Question of a Workshop Although Gossart started out in Antwerp in 1503 as a master who trained two assistants, no evidence exists that he had an established workshop there at any point afterward. After he was admitted to the Brotherhood of Our Lady in Middelburg upon his return from Rome in 1509,” he appears to have worked in a number of different locations outside of that city, including Bruges. From about 1515 to 1524, while employed at Philip of Burgundy’s court in Souburg or Wijk bij Duurstede, he was not obliged to register in a guild or take account of any apprentices. 20 JAN GOSSART'S RENAISSANCE\n\nMiddelburg Altarpiece. He collaborated with Gerard David, whose signature fair Virgins and comely female saints were a prestigious addition to Gossart’s compositions in the early 1510s (cats. §, 6, 7A,B, 8). Landscape 1s not a common feature of Gossart’s paintings, but when it was important to include for the theme of a given work, he collaborated with other artists to provide this portion. The landscapes in Gossart’s Thyssen-Bornemisza and Berlin Adam and Eve paintings, the Malvagna Triptych, the Doria Pamphilj Diptych, and the Cleveland Virgin and Child are all by specialists who contributed this piecemeal work at various points in Gossart’s career (cats.\n\n1,\n\n3, 6, 7A,B,\n\n20). Finally, another feature\n\nof Gossart’s out-\n\nput suggests that he collaborated with other workshops. He\n\napparently was sought after as a designer of sculpture, stained glass, furniture, and perhaps even tapestry (see the Alsteens essay). Gossart may thus have had an ongoing relationship with various workshops devoted to different media rather than having a thriving one of his own. Certain examples indicate that there were requests for copies of particular Gossart paintings. In these instances he may have temporarily hired on journeymen or artists from other workshops to provide the copies, or he could have lent out, rented, or sold the cartoons for these works to established workshops for production. In the case of Gossart’s Adam and Eve in the Royal Collection, tracing apparently was made of the figures from the finished painting, and this was used to produce at least two copies (see cat. 2). When a tracing on Mylar of the Adam and Eve figures was placed over the two other versions of the painting in Brussels (Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, no. 3383) and Berlin (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, no. 642), the outlines closely matched.* In addition, the underdrawing of the Brussels version also shows evidence that the figures were transferred from a cartoon by tracing. The dendrochronological dates of the Brussels and Berlin copies are early enough for them to have been created around the time of Gossart’s prototype, that is, about 1520. Yet both the Brussels and the Berlin paintings are clearly different in technique and handling from the prototype, and it 1s debatable whether they were created under Gossart’s direct supervision or in a different workshop at a later time. One other example for which there seems to have been considerable demand for contemporary copies, as well as for\n\na\n\nversions produced long after Gossart’s lifetime, is the Virgin and in The MetropolChild of which the best remaining version itan Museum of Art (cat. 37). This is the composition that is usually identified as proof of a Gossart workshop.” It is linked to Van Mander’ famous statement that the figures are modeled after Anna van Bergen and her son Hendrik.” Some twenty copies and versions survive, ranging widely from works made in\n\nis\n\nthe 1520s to those produced long after, even into the early seventeenth century (such as the version in the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art).”” Of the copies that have been studied, several not surprisingly show evidence of transfer from a cartoon by tracing.”’ There 1s also a distinct variation in quality as well as in technique and handling within the group. While the Metropolitan Museum version is fairly close to Gossart in style and execution, many of the others are far too distant in these regards to have been produced under the artist's watchful eye and may very well have been made from a pattern that was circulated outside of any possible Gossart workshop. If Van Mander 1s right that the original was created after the models of Anna van Bergen and her son, perhaps this occurred at Adolf of Burgundy’s residence in Veere or Gossart’s atelier in nearby Middelburg. The copies of this extremely popular composition could have been outsourced, and the pattern shared for serial production. Could this have been in Antwerp, where the market was able to support such a serial production? The Antwerp-hand brand on the reverse of one of the copies indicates that at least some of the production of this popular composition took place there.” It has often been assumed that Gossart opened up a studio this point in with assistants after Philip's death in 1524. Only\n\nat\n\nhis career did there start to be a substantial number of versions and copies produced after his compositions, such as the Hague Virgin and Child with the Veil, the Virgin and Child paintings in\n\nMadrid,Vienna, and Washington, and the Budapest Christ on the Cold Stone (cats. 10, 16, 174A, 21, 27). These copies, made after only a very limited number of Gossart’s paintings, are not evidence of a well-established workshop involved in serial production, such as those of Joos van Cleve, Jan de Beer, Quinten Metsys, or Pieter Coecke van Aelst.”” The large number ofdifferent hands involved in making these versions indicates the participation of many painters, not a select few within one workshop. Furthermore, most of the paintings of these themes made after Gossart’s originals are not exact copies, but in some way altered. For example, the numerous paintings after Gossart’s Christ on the Cold Stone (cat. 27) all reduce the group of menacing soldiers and Jews from five to three figures. For the copies and versions of the paintings mentioned above, there are differences in the sizes of the panels within a single group, of background settings, and so forth. In addition, most of the paintings within these groups are of distinctly inferior quality compared to Gossart’s originals, so much so that it is difficult to imagine that he would have ap"
