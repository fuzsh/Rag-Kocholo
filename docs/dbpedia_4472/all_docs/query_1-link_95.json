        "text": "Jorge Semprun (1923–2011) was a Spanish, politically active writer who lived in France most of his life. Ηe served as Minister of Culture in Spain’s socialist government from 1988 to 1991. During the period of his office a subject of prime importance was the action of exposing paintings in a modern museum in order to encourage the dialogues between the artists of several periods and mainly the dialogue of modern public with the artistic heritage of the past. His interest, manifested in the extensive and recurring references, made in his works, to three paintings from 17th century Holland, Italy and Spain, lies mainly in the renovation, the new life that he attributes to them by integrating baroque works in the history of modern Europe. Three famous paintings, Johannes Vermeer’s “View of Delft”, the “Judith slaying Holofernes’s” of Artemisia Gentileschi and Diego Velasquez’s “Las Meninas” find a new place in history of art as their initial “life” in Delft, Rome and Madrid respectively is imbricated, on multiple levels, with persons and events of the contemporary era. Further, the views of the writer that he was, on ways to exhibit baroque works in today’s museums, heightened by his sensitivities as a citizen of Europe and by a sense of responsibility owing to his institutional position as minister of culture in Spain, greatly contribute to the actual debate on the interaction between the 21st and the 17th century.\n\nThe main goal of this book is the transmission of the results of the research developed within the Research Project “Artists, patrons and audiences. Catalonia and the Mediterranean (11th-15th centuries)-MAGISTRI CATALONIAE (HAR2011-23015), led by the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. It is published on the occasion of the exhibition entitled, Pintar fa mil anys. Els colors del romànic (Vic, May 31st-December 14th, 2014), being the result of a collaboration between the UAB and the Museu Episcopal de Vic (MEV). The book mainly aims to look more deeply into issues related to the training and identity of the anonymous Romanesque painters. This task has been made possible thanks to the analysis of some outstanding pieces from the MEV collection -such as the Canopy of Ribes, the frontals of Santa Maria de Puigbò and Espinevles and the Altar of Lluçà- as well as some mural paintings such as those of Saint Thomas Becket in Santa Maria de Terrassa and Sant Martí in Puig-reig. All of them have been analysed using an approach that combined art-historical methodologies along with scientific analysis. It means the reconstruction of the various agencies which are involved in the production of an artwork, and how each of these agencies have an effect on its genesis and reception. This is combined with the application of sophisticated laboratory-based analytical techniques such as Optical Microscopy, SEM-EDX, XR Diffraction, FTIR, Chromatographic Techniques and MALDI-TOF. The result is a fascinating study in which is reported for the first time an ecclesiastical context for the starting of the Catalan panel painting. Furthermore, it discusses in new ways the relation among the illumination, panel an mural painting techniques.\n\nhttp://www.brepols.net/Pages/ShowProduct.aspx?prod_id=IS-9782503574486-1 The 'Old Cathedral’ at Salamanca survives as a flagship of late Romanesque in the kingdom of Leon. The following article considers its architectural sculpture, executed between 1152 and 1230, in order to reflect on the factors that defined the material culture of the period. In particular, it will focus on the coexistence of pre-existing workshops, models and recognised plans on the one hand, and the novel dispositions of the sculpture on the other. Such coexistence might seem contradictory, but is a more general attribute of a period characterised by a tension between continuity and innovation. This can be seen at other cathedral ensembles, most notably Santiago de Compostela.\n\nEven a brief review of Mediterranean Romanesque cloisters reveals the existence of heterogeneous themes and varied programmes. Of particular interest is the cloister of the mid-twelfth century Cathedral of Santa Maria d'Urgell. The aim of this study is to determine the meanings behind its apparently unconnected visual devices. Despite certain methodological problems, an analysis both of the capitals and the documentary sources allows us to interpret a good part of the cloister’s singular sculpture in the light of specific cultural references, and on the basis of this we propose that the images are real visual texts that can be understood through reference to the Psalms. Un recorrido por los claustros románicos mediterráneos constata la existencia de temáticas heterogéneas y programas variados. Entre ellos, el de Santa María de la Seu d’Urgell, de mediados del siglo XII, destaca por su interés. Este estudio tiene como objetivo dilucidar a qué responden sus dispositivos visuales, aparentemente inconexos y carentes de sentido. Pese a algunos problemas metodológicos, el análisis de los capiteles junto con el de las fuentes textuales permite proponer una lectura de buena parte de su singular escultura a la luz de determinados anclajes culturales. Es decir, proponemos entender las imágenes como verdaderos textos visuales que pueden descifrarse a la luz de los Salmos."
