Lfcfc LIBRARY '' BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSiT> PPPiVO. UTAH PREFACE. A reprint of the fourth edition of the Catalogue has become necessary after the expiration of a period of four years ; it has in many respects been increased and improved, although not to the same extent as the last edition. As heretofore , the information concerning the acquisitions, the arrangements and the changes which have been effected in the Royal Picture Gallery during this period, has been given in the Introduction; in the Catalogue itself such corrections with regard to the names of the artists , the origin and signatures of the pictures etc., as have been verified during that time, have been conscientiously made. The numbers which have heretofore been attached in the Catalogue to the pictures of the old Schools have, in general, been retained, and the recent additions, so far as they have found a place in the Catalogue itself, have been designated by letters that the former editions might not be rendered entirely useless. The most IV recent additions to the Gallery will be found in an especial Appendix. By the use of a smaller type, the Catalogue has been materially diminished in size, and thus rendered lighter and more convenient for reference and use. May this reprint, therefore, be received with a favour equal to that accorded to its predecessors. Dresden, May 1876. Dr. Julius Htttmer. s ONTENTS.

J w Introduction. “Wer Vieles bringt, wird Manchem etwas bringen!” Goethe. The New Museum, with its world renowned Picture Gallery, now welcomes the visitor, fa- vourably impressed at the very entrance, into the cheerful halls of a real palace of art. The works of the immortal masters of every school and period strike the delighted eye with heigh- tened brilliancy, and with increased interest the questions crowd upon the astonished spectator: how, and under what circumstances, can it have been possible ~to unite in one collection so rich 1 2 and glorious a multitude of the finest specimens of the various schools of Art? Under which of the Saxon sovereigns; through whose cooperation ; from what countries, and for what sums were these treasures obtained? How have they, hitherto, been preserved and their number increased through all the vicissitudes of time? What fortunes have befallen the Gallery, as such, during an existence of more than a century? — questions, indeed, which have often been asked in times past, and now when the Collection is, in its completeness, so much more advantageously situated, they occur only so much the more frequently to the mind of the observer. Yet not one of the nu- merous catalogues which have thus far appeared, has even attempted to answer these questions in any particular. So much the more pressing appeared the necessity of venturing such an attempt to the author of a new catalogue which is, in some degree, intended to commemorate the event of the transfer of the pictures to their new lo- cality as a marked epoch in the history of the Gallery. The circumstance of having no prede- cessor in this field of labour has its favourable and its unfavourable aspects. It is undoubtedly favourable, if the author can feel sure of offering to the public something hitherto unknown, but it is a most, unenviable task to search into sources of information long neglected; to arrange materials and to be obliged to turn away un- satisfied from much that has become obscure and confused through the lapse of time and thus, unavoidably leave many questions, at least for the present, but partially answered. o ') All researches into the oldest sources of information lead us back to a so-called “Kunst- kammer ”, already commenced by the early rulers of Saxony, as the origin of all the collections. This, however, contained not only paintings Origin of the and statuary, but also among objects of art collectlou of every kind, a great number of so-called “curiosities” arid elaborate works, of which the greater part are still to be seen in the Green Vaults. Such a “Kunstkammer” existed in most of the castles of the reigning princes, as early as the commencement of the sixteenth century, they were in fact to be found in the castles of such of the more powerful counts and nobles as exhibited a sympathy for the refinements of cultivated life. In the older part of the palace in this city, Kimst- the Elector Augustus I. also, had, as early as Kammer‘ 1560, collected into a Kunstkammer* all works * It consisted of seven rooms in the Electoral Palace, and contained, besides the jewels and curio- $ sities which were kept there for safey, a not unim- portant number of paintings which adorned the walls : “portraits, Biblical pictures and other historical sub- jects painted by Albr. Diirer , Titian, Tintoretto, Luc. Cranach, Rubenio, Concheten (?) Luca von Leyden, Barmisano and other artists” as the old chronicler Week relates. A collection of the less important objects which had not been incorporated in the other collections existed under the original name until within a very recent period. The Anatomical chamber , a room containing skeletons, anatomical preparations etc., in the upper “Tabulat”, (story), just above the Kunstkammer, is described — according to Week’s chronicle — as 1* 4 Italian pictures also therein. of this kind in his possession; among others it probably contained most of our present pictures by Cranach , Diirer and other early German masters which, at least in part, began to be collected under Duke George the Bearded, during the lifetime of Frederick the Wise, and Cranach, and was increased and enriched by his successors. This collection however, already contained a number of valuable Italian paintings, which, in the formation of a Gallery, and in the oldest inventory of 1722 and the following years, are expressly mentioned as “taken from the Kunst- kammer.” This inventory was commenced in likewise decorated with landscapes by Kilian Fa- britius, who died aboutl670. Whether these were paint- ed on the walls, or were hung thereon is not quite clear; it, however, contained paintings also, at a sub- sequent period, as is proved by the old inventory. Also in other places, as, for example, in the churches and chapels there were some pictures which were, at a later time transferred to the Gallery. There was further, in the rooms of the Royal palace, especially during the life-time of Augustus III., a large number of the choicest works which had been selected by the express direction of the king. Among these were especially the Magdalene by Correggio, and the best specimens of the small Dutch pictures. When these, in 1817 under Frederick Augustus the Just, were incorporated with the Gallery, it was ne- cessary, in order to procure space, to place a large number of other pictures in the so-called Doubletten (Duplicates) Gallery (now the Exhibition Building on the Bruhl’schen Terrace), These formed the “Yor- rath” (reserved pictures) as it was called, and were from time to time, again placed in the Gallery, with the exception of a few of the less important that were disposed of b}T auction. 1722 under the direction of Baron Raymond le Plat, Architect to His Majesty, and first Director of the Picture Gallery, and was con- tinued until 1728 by the chamberlain and In- spector Steinhauser whose manuscript catalogue in 8V0 extends to 1747, although in imperfect annotations; both are preserved in the archives of the collections. Besides the pictures already collected in the above-mentioned Kunstkammer, there was, according to an inventory first undertaken in July 1722 “of all the paintings belonging to His Royal Majesty in Poland and Electoral Highness in Saxony\" a still larger collection of more or less valuable pictures taken from the various capitals and castles of the Saxon princes, including some from churches and chapels, to form a Gallery now for the first time so-called. The locality designated “Gallery and adjoining rooms\" was in the Electoral “Stallgebaude”, the corner stone of which was laid July 6. 1586 in the time of the Elector Christian I. It contained in front towards the so-called “Judenhof\" (Jews’ court) a large hall and stately rooms (the “lower Stall- zimmer”) which were likewise decorated with pictures and were occasionally used as state apartments for foreign guests.* * Among others, two Polish princes Jac. and Const. Sobiesky resided here in 1707, and in 1712 the cardinal Christian Augustus Duke of Saxon-Zeitz. Below were stalls for 130 horses, and rooms for costly state carriages, sledges, harness etc. The present Royal Armoury from the Topfergasse to the Elbthor, which with its open arcades towards the 1 6 The pictures in the Gallery, properly so- called, were arranged in the second story, and in the examination of the old inventory under- taken in 1742 are more particularly recapitu- lated as follows: In the upper 1st Gallery .... 144 pictures. In the upper 2d Gallery and corner rooms 164 „ In the 11 adjoining rooms . . . 1445 „ In the lower stall rooms .... 185 „ Total 1938 pictures. The number of the pictures in the rooms mentioned in List A. in the first edition being added to the above, we find that the total of all the pictures at that time amounted to 4708, of which 3110 were valuable and 159 inferior. Kestoration In August 1744, all the pictures in the Gallery. *2d story , as we are informed by J. A. Riedel in his Diary, were carried by soldiers to the Japanese Palace in Neustadt, and the restoration of the novf called old Gallery in the Jiidenhof commenced. The restoration could have con- sisted in nothing more than an alteration of the first and second stories into a single lofty room with correspondingly high windows and better light, as the alterations must otherwise have required more time than waa actually em- ployed. For before the end of the year 1746, court at that time surrounded the tilt-yard is nearly in its former condition, and the wall towards the Augustusstrasse was then also decorated with paint- ings , as now again with the cavalcade of the Saxon sovereigns in sgraffito. 7 the whole collection in the Japanese Palace had been examined anew, the copies rejected, and the original pictures taken to' the Gallery, as we are informed by the above mentioned annalist. In this year also arrived the Modena Gallery which was at first arranged in the Palace, where a number of the pictures were restored. Before the end of the year, however, these paintings were placed in the Gallery and ar- rangements made for their exhibition. In 1747 the inner Gallery, which was pro- bably still undergoing a partial enlargement, “was also arranged anew, and the Italian pictures hung therein\", — an arrangement which was, in general, also retained later. About this time we begin to notice in the The so- inventories a number of names of so-called ^ianteir^ “purveyors’’ (Lieferanten) mostly Art Dealers, persons connected with the Gallery etc., but some of persons of high — even the highest — rank, who, as warm friends of art, were actively interested in the growth of the Gallery either as noble donors or agents in the purchase of pictures. A list of these names placing in curious juxtaposition the best known persons of that period and the most obscure and quaint individuals, was appended to the preface to the first edition for the benefit of the “curious reader’’, especially those who were acquainted with the circumstances of that time in this city. To gain space, this list has been omitted in the present edition as the names of such persons are also mentioned in the catalogue in connection with the pictures. 8 The most The most brilliant period of the acquisitions perioTofthe^0 .the Gallery, when those pictures were pur- acquisitions. ceased which still shine as the brightest jewels of our collection, was under the sway of Au- gustus II. and still more especially that of Au- gustus III. (1733 — 1763) and his favourite and all-powerful minister, Reichsgraf Heinrich von Briihl. Both names are almost every where noticed in connection with the purchase of the greatest master -pieces in the Collection. King Au- If it is undeniably the stern duty of the andCount Muse of History to sit in judgment on the Bruin, human weaknesses and faults even of kings, a more agreeable task has fallen to the biographer of the Gallery, — that of being permitted to dwell only on the bright traits in the character of Augustus III.; and even the pliant adviser and executor of his royal will, the oft-mentioned count Briihl, appears in this field of his activity, as a man who, actuated by great zeal and ge- nuine love of art, shewed himself capable of assisting in a munificent manner in the execution of his royal master’s designs. But the person whose services Briihl more especially employed in enlarging the Gallery, as well as the Collection of Engravings and the Library, was his private secretary, the well-known Carl Heinrich von Heineken* (born at Liibeck 1706, died at Altdobern 1791). The name of this man should be the less forgotten in this • place, as malice and want of judgment have long enough deprived him of his just reputation * So he signs himself in his documents. 9 through his having been, at the death of his patron, Briihl, unjustly involved in the disgrace into which, not without cause, the latter had fallen. That it was he who really created the Gallery is proved by a letter of Briihl’s to Heineken from Warsaw, Nov. 23d 1748, in which he intrusts to him the critical decision con- cerning some pictures offered for sale, in the following words: “je les soumets a votre juge-' ment, car la galerie est votre production et j’en ay que l’honneur mais a vous apartient la gloire.” Only the glowing enthusiasm of King Augustus for art, the critical eye of Heineken and the munificence of Briihl, who always knew where to find the immense sums required, were able by their union to produce a Gallery like that of Dresden.* The most considerable and important of the acquisitions of King Augustus both in number and value is undoubtedly the purchase of the so-called “Modena Gallery”; more properly, a collection of one hundred pictures from the Galleries of Duke Francesco of Este- Modena * I have already in the first edition of my ca- talogue (v. Anm. p. XVII) adduced the strongest evidence, which has not been controverted, that no other than Heineken could have been the author of the well-known „Abr eg£“, the only valuable critical and historical catalogue of former times. Subsequent and more particular research has enabled me to dis- cover the peculiar position of Heineken as author of the publication; I must, however, for want of space here, reserve a further discussion of the sub- ject for a special essay at some future time. 10 which were partly in Modena and partly in Ferrara, This difficult transaction was effected through the agency of Count Villio, at that time Saxon Ambassa- dor in Venice; Ventura Rossi, painter to the court,, (di d at Venice 18. October 1766) furnished with special powers from Saxony ; Pietro Guarienti of Dres- den, afterwards Inspector of the Gallery (born 1676 died May 26 1753), and old Zanetti* in Venice, .a celebrated connoisseur of that period; while the financial arrangements were intrusted to the banker, John Thomas de Rachel of Dresden, specially sent to Venice for the purpose, and his brother Paul Moritz Rachel of Venice. From numerous original letters of both and particu- larly of the former, it is quite apparent through- out the course of the intricate transaction how the Saxon agents were annoyed by cunning and avarice. A momentary financial embarrassment of Francesco III. Duke of Este- Modena was skil- fully employed by King Augustus in his ardent love for art and desire to increase his Gallery, — a feeling in which Brtihl fully participated — to secure the purchase of the most important paintings of the Este Gallery.** * Antonio Maria Zanetti, (born 1716, died 1778,) had earlier made the most important purchases in Italy for the Regent, Duke of Orleans. In one of his letters he regrets that the Modena purchase had not been intrusted to him alone; he would have obtained the whole Gallery for the same price: the offer, in his opinion, should have been made in gulden rather than in sequins — “perch6 fa piu strepitoso il numero!” ** Francesco III. of Este-Modena, only son of Rinaldo, who died October 26, 1737, was married 11 The Duke and his State officers and agents, the Prime Minister Marchese Rangoni and the Finance Minister and Auditor General Msgr. Bondigli, were well aware of the weight of the responsibility which they incurred in permitting the removal of such a treasure from their native country , and the negotiations could only be carried on with great secrecy, in consequence of their fear of the opposition which had become to Charlotte Aglae of Orleans, and succeeded his father on the Ducal throne. During the War of Succession \\vhich, notwithstanding the Pragmatic Sanction, broke out after the death of Charles VI., Francesco joined the Spaniards, and later, even commanded in person a part of his own troops, as he was not deficient in talent and had already taken part in the war in Hungary in 1737. in 1742, before he had determined to join the Spaniards, he passed some time in Venice, having transferred the government to a Giunta of nobles and state officers who opened Modena to Victor Emanuel of Sardinia. Thus he lived as ex-Duke in Venice (1743); his wife went to France and there gave her eldest daughter Felicita d’ Este in marriage to Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Penthievre. Francesco received the title of Generalissimo of the Spanish forces and joined the army. In the attack on Velletri by Lobkowitz, it was with difficulty that he avoided being taken prisoner. In 1745, Francesco passed the winter in Venice and its neighbourhood, and' it was during this time that the purchase of the Modena pictures was effected, as the Duke was in great need of money , his land being constantly in the hands of the enemy and exposed to the miseries of war. At the Congress of Nice in 1749, Duke Francesco came once more • into the possession of his Duchy and the Hungarian dependencies, but the magnificent collection of .pictures was forever* lost to his country. See. Leo’s Gesch. Italiens T. V. Buch XII. Cap. I. 12 apparent in Modena itself, even some of the Duke's counsellors being decidedly against the sale. Rossi himself was obliged to examine the pictures, in order to approve of the selection, with the same secrecy and under a false name. New difficulties were constantly raised on the part of the Modenese agents who delayed the negotiations, and to overcome all obstacles many important concessions of money were still required besides the price, already fixed, of one hundred thousand sequins — a sum which was for that period indeed enormous. It was only after the greatest exertions and with the help of a “regalo\" of one hundred sequins* paid to Bondigli, that the Saxon agents finally succeeded in conveying the pic- tures, which were already packed in cases, into neutral territory in Rossi's house in Padua. Here they were to remain as a deposit until the sum fixed as the price should be paid. As the payment was somewhat delayed, a further amount of 7000 sequins was required, as an indemnification, to prevent the whole transaction even at this stage, from being broken off (see the original contract signed at Ferrara Sept. 1 7. 1745). Finally, when everything seemed in order, Bondigli refused to deliver up the gilt frames, as they were not expressly mentioned in the contract. He furthermore extorted from the unhappy Rossi 1000 sequins for himself, for consenting to accept in payment four State * Original receipt, Aug. 20. 1745. 13 bonds, bearing interest; one for 50,000, one for 42,000, and two for 4,000 sequins, and for postponing the cash payment until after the Easter Fair in 1746. It should not be for- gotten that it was also stipulated that a copy of Correggio's celebrated “Night’’ was to be furnished to the seller, which Rossi consented to procure.* On the other hand it was expressly stipu- lated in the contract that the copy of the Christo della Moneta by Flaminio Torre should also be delivered to the Saxon agents, as they on their part feared, not indeed a dishonest exchange of the pictures by the Italians , but the assertion so often heard in similar cases that the original picture had not really been sold. It was also stipulated in the . contract that the copy should, at a later time, be returned, but it has, for some unknown reason, remained in the Gallery. On the arrival of the pictures in Dresden, Guarienti asserted in a statement appended to the original list, that a picture by Annibale Carracci , the so-called Suonatore di Liuto (Luteplayer), named also “il Mascherone ', was missing; as, however, the picture is actually in the Gallery, it appears to have been sent at some later time. * Whether he painted it himself or, as is more probable from a statement in the Galleriewerk, com- missioned Nogari to do it, cannot be ascertained from the documents. • 14 Although the price of these pictures men- tioned above js so large it may be boldly affirm- ed that at the present day a collection of one hundred paintings, containing among others six such exquisite pictures by Correggio; the Tribute Money by Titian; the Portrait of Morett by Holbein; the great pictures by Paul Vero- nese, and so many masterpieces of the Bolognese school, could not be purchased at present valu- ations for ten times the sum, if in fact, it could be obtained at all. We need only remember that a few years since a Madonna by Murillo was purchased in Paris for 615,300 francs. Ventura Rossi boasted with justifiable pride that he had been able to secure also the “famo- sissima Maddalena\" by Correggio, which, with four other paintings was, at first, expressly mentioned as not included in the sale. He could not however, at the same time suppress an almost mournful confession that he, an Italian, ought not to have been instrumental in depriving his native land of such a jewel. No doubt it required, for this purpose, in addition to the sacrifice of his national pride, no little diplo- matic skill, which he wished to be appreciated by His Majesty as an especial claim to favour. The shrewd Italian must have breathed more freely when all the intricate stipulations were fulfilled, and we sympathize still more with the joy of the honest Paul Moritz Rachel in Venice at seeing the disagreeable business finally adjusted, when both were, at last, able to report that the five wagons, well packed with 15 pictures and duly furnished with a royal “permit”, had left Venice, via Vienna, on the 6th of July 1746, for Dresden, where they arrived in the course of the following month. This joy was, however, premature, at least for the good Rachel, for his next letter, which was indeed the last, informs his “cher fr£re” in Dresden of the indescribable embarrassments which he had suffered in effecting the payment to Msgr. Bondigli.* It was not enough that it had been very difficult to collect one hundred thousand sequins in coin, it was required that each piece should be weighed, even those newly coined, and the smallest difference adjusted, which necessarily involved much haggling and sending of the pieces to and fro, — a day’s work for which the poor banker can find no .words sufficiently dreadful. But even these twenty four hours came to an end, and the great transaction was completed. At the close of the letter, Bondigli is cursed by our tormented countryman in the most cau- tious language, while Sig. Marchese Rangoni is described as a perfect nobleman, and is even expressly recommended to his “cher frere” as worthy of a present of a piece of porcelain from his Excellency the Reichsgraf von Briihl**. * In his letter he says: “The Modena affair is so far adjusted that my brother has been able to depart, but God only knows to what annoyances I am still exposed from the hard, impolite and unrea- sonable Bondigli” etc. ** The original is as follows: “and this vene- rable Cavalier, whose probity shines so brightly, 16 Presents of It may here be mentioned as a circumstance porcelain. worfljy -0f note that in most of the important pur- chases of that time, a piece of porcelain from the world - renowned manufactory in Meissen was included in the price, sometimes indeed as a special condition; and it occurred so frequently that Briihl felt obliged to remark, once for all, that such claims were very distasteful to His Majesty, and that, in future, he must forbid most decidedly, similar “vague\" promises of remuneration in addition to the fixed purchase price. Purchase But how openly, in general, the circum- Madonna stances of those times permitted the payment by ?7°43 ein* a to all who were connected with, or concerned in such a purchase, we shall soon have occasion to mention when speaking of the purchase of the celebrated Madonna by Holbein in Y enice by the well - known Count Francesco Algarotti, the intelligent friend of Augustus and of Frederick the Great. A more particular account of this transaction, as it appears in Algarotti' s own letters and journals, may not be uninteresting to those interested in the history of art and to admirers of this exquisite picture.* really deserves a marque d’estime from your court, mon cher frere, etc.” That something of the kind was actually sent to him, is not to be doubted; at least the above mentioned Zannetti, then in his 75th year, received a gold mounted porcelain casket which Algarotti himself took to Venice from Dresden by Bruhl’s order. (Algarotti’s Journal.). * Compare the most recent works concerning Holbein and our picture by A. Woltmann; Th. 17 This splendid work of Hans Holbein the Younger* (born in Augsburg, or as some affirm, in Basle 1478, died in London 1543) was originally, as it is now known, painted for Jacob Meyer, Burgomaster of Basle,** whose family it represents as under the protection of the Virgin. On the right of the Virgin kneels Fechner: A. v. Zahn and His-Heusler; J. Janssen, Edward Engerth, and others. * After our picture was placed side by side with that of Darmstadt in 1871, the genuineness of the former was still more a matter of doubt than before, and it was pronounced by some distinguished connoisseurs to be a later copy. Of this, there was, however, no more proof than of the contrary asser- tion, as was unanimously admitted. The author of this catalogue, like many others, on a comparison of the two pictures, saw no reason to change his former opinion that the Darmstadt picture is an earlier representation, and that in Dresden a later repetition by the hand of the same master. Until historical documents are found to prove the contrary, this opinion , supported furthermore by a certain ideality in the Dresden picture , which is alsoadmitted by impartial opponents , must be considered as uif controverted. ** There is still in the Museum at Basle, among other excellent works by H. Holbein , a number of masterly studies for our picture drawn in red and black crayons, and a painted portrait of the same Jacob Meyer, at an earlier age, with his young wife. Our picture was, for a long time, considered to be a representation of the family of Thomas More until those drawings were discovered in Basle. Another painting of this subject exists in Darm- stadt, as is well known, in the possession of Princess Elisabeth of Hesse. Concerning the relations of the two pictures to each other, there has been much dispute. (See former note.) 2 18 the father with his two sons (the youngest, a naked child); on the opposite side is his wife, Dorothea Kannengiesser, with her mother and daughter. It was first purchased in 1633 from a descendant of the Meyer family for 1000 Thaler, by Michael Blon , Royal Swedish agent in Amsterdam, who is often mentioned by Sandrart as a zealous collector and friend of art. It was afterwards sold by him, on earnest solicitation, as Sandrart likewise mentions, to the rich book keeper, Johann Lossert of Amsterdam for 3000 gulden. He purchased it, in fact for Mary de Medicis, but as she died about this time (July 3, 1642) he probably kept it for himself. Between 1690 and 1700 Lossert, or his heirs, became bankrupt and Holbein's picture came into the possession of the banker Avogadro of Venice, in payment of a debt of 2000 sequins. By him it was bequeathed to the Delfino family. (See Algarotti’s correspondence.) The painting seems to have remained in Venice for a long time unknown and unap- preciated, (although the Regent, the Duke of Orleans, who died in 1723, had made an at- tempt to buy it), for Algarotti gives an animated description of the visits which the Venetian ar- tists made to him, in order to see this magni- ficent work of art, and how he prudently showed them first his Carlo Marattis and Bassanos, that he might finally dismiss them with a view of Holbeins Madonna, as we give Tokay at the end of an entertainment that our guests may depart with the sweetest taste on the tongue. 19 The merit of Algarotti in having again found and rightly appreciated such a picture- deserves the higher commendation as the pre- vailing taste of the day was in direct opposition to it, and the insipid creations of Carlo Maratti were universally admired. Algarotti had purchased Holbein s magnificent painting in 1743 in Venice from the eldest member of the family, a Mr. Zuane (Giovanni) Dolfino (or Delfini), and we append, according to promise, his own account of the cost: 4.

It may not be superfluous, in addition to these historical facts, to mention a tradition, or rather legend, connected with this picture by Holbein, which has recently received additional though unfounded confirmation from the inscription on the beautiful and deservedly popular engraving by M. Steinla, which makes the more imperative a careful examina- tion of the evidence. In the latin inscription on this fine engraving, stands the oft repeated story that the Virgin of Holbein’s picture holds the sick child of Burgomaster Me^er in her arms — it is actually declared to be the subject of the painting**, so that the uninformed must believe that this statement mentions a well-known and undoubted fact. It is, on the contrary , not founded on any historical proof whatever, and there is no where to be found, in early allusions to the picture, the least hint of such an In- terpretation of the picture f . The opinion which has really become a local one, can be traced back only * Probably the carter. ** Sanctissima Mater Dei parvulum aegrotantem filium Jacobi Meyeri, Consulis Basileensis, ulnis fovens, pater ipse cum reliquafamiliagenuflexiadorant. f Sandrart who lived almost a century nearer Holbein’s time than we do, distinctly says : “a Virgin, standing with the Infant in her arms” etc. Holbein- legend. as ±'^ as the beginning of this century, and probably had its origin in a remark of Frederick Schlegel’s* who may have advanced the idea as an explanation of the circumstance that the Infant in this picture really has a depressed, sickly expression. But independent of the fact that Holbein and his entire century, far removed, as they were, from a conception so wholly modern, would scarcely have ventured to treat the sacred person of the divine Infant with so much levity, there are numerous other internal reasons for re- jecting this assumption. Among the most striking of these, may be mentioned the movement of the hand of the child, undoubtedly raised in the act of blessing: how can this be appropriate to the sick child of the Meyer family? Again, how is to be excused the evidently brotherly caress of the elder boy to the supposed infant Christ, and the childish and even naive action of the child itself? how to be explained the quiet, typical, almost indifferent manner of all the other members of the family under such extraordinary circumstances? Ever new contra- dictions, which are only increased on closer examination, speak decidedly against the cor- rectness of this not unpoetical explanation. The fact noticeable more or less, in almost all? early German representations of similar sub- jects, that the Infant is less successfully treated than the mother and other figures, has apparently given rise to this interpretation of the picture, * Herr von Quandt mentions a paper by Luden that has the same idea. while the natural explanation of the fact lies, in our opinion, in the real difficulty of the task : and in the want of study of beautiful forms and of the antique • added to which, the restless movements of the little models sufficiently account for some want of success , even with such a master as Hol- bein. The youngest child of Meyer, whom the artist saw in person before him, and to whom he was not required to lend any ideal characteristics or move- ment, was therefore the more successful work. Holbein's picture belongs, in its conception,* entirely to the earliest class of similar repre- sentations, inasmuch as the kneeling family is depicted as literally under the mantle of the Virgin, (see the shoulder of the elder Meyer) “as a brood under the mother’s wings”, in accordance with the type of the protecting Ma- donna, who is often represented in older pictures with the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of whole cities under her mantle. After the Re- formation, the crucified and risen Saviour took the place of the Madonna, and we often see, especiall}' in connection with monumental repre- sentations in churches, biblical subjects of sym- bolical meaning, e. g. the elevation of the brazen ser- pent; the raising of Lazarus etc. In such instances, the family are generally in the foreground of the picture, painted mostly on a much smaller scale; but the kneeling posture , and the rigid separation of sexes as in our Holbein, are always observed.* * The Cocina Family, the magnificent picture by Paolo Veronese, is also a repetition of this typical idea in the Italian style, and in a still freer artistic form. 24 Mr. Hubert Morrett by Holbein. One other work by the same master, forming, like this family picture, a culminating point of its kind among single portraits , must be mentioned here — the exquisite portrait of Mr. Hubert Morrett, Goldsmith to Henry VIII of England. It offers, at the same time, an opportunity to the his- torian of the Gallery to give a striking example of uncertainty concerning the names of authors. The picture came into our Gallery with the Modena purchase, as if the best works even of German Art could, at that time, only come from Italy, and it was considered as a work of Leonardo da Vinci's.* At a later period, it was supposed that there were good grounds for considering it to be a portrait of Ludovico Sforza, named il Moro. * It cannot, however, be denied that the au- thorship of Leonardo was by no means assumed in Modena itself, at least in former times, with so much certainty as it appears to have been in our catalogue of the Modena pictures. On the contrary, the well known work of Scanr 3lli (Microcosmo Ediz. di 1657, (p. 266; contains, under the name of “Olbeno,r i Holbeim, a description of a picture in the Modena collection which evidently can be no other than our Morrett. This is a circumstance to which Cav. Discar, an art critic of Modena, in a paper addressed to the Directors of our Gallery in 1860, especially calls their attention. We may add to this remark that in the same work of Scannelli, in the passage which particularly refers to the works of Leonardo in the Modena purchase, no picture is mentioned which in any respect resembles that in our Gallery. Scannelli on the contrary, speaks only of a half- length figure of Saint Catharine, and the head of a youth in armour, as works by Leonardo da Vinci. Thus it was designated until Rumohr first named the younger Holbein as the painter of the picture, and von Quandt in an excellent essay (see Kunstbl. 1846, No. 9) convincingly pointed out the person represented. It is a singular circumstance that even in this nighli of error a spark of truth was left glimmering, in the preservation of the syllable “Mor\\ Out of Morrett , probably the word Morus was first formed (Thomas Morus, who was al- ways first thought of in connection with any unknown portrait by Holbein; as was the case with the family Meyer which was supposed to be the family of Morus, as already mentioned); but in Italy, Morus naturally became Moro. But who in Italy knew any other Moro than the great Sforza? and who could have painted him except his great countryman, Leonardo ? — a portrait withal so exquisite in execution, so perfectly finished, even to the hair! With respect to any chronological doubt, there was no very accurate examination into the subject; the portrait became that of Ludovico Sforza, painted by Leonardo da Vinci, and thus it remained, as has been said, until a revived acquaintance with the German School restored his work to the honest Basle artist, and, after further research, the likeness of the old gold- smith was found again in an engraving by W. Hollar. If, nevertheless, the evidence as to the author- ship of Holbein afforded by Hollar’s certainly very imperfect and superficial engraving might be considered insufficient by some particularly un- believing souls, aU doubt is henceforth at an end, since the discovery of the beautiful original drawing of Holbein for our picture. It was found at the sale of the pictures of the Art Dealer, Samuel Woodburne, .in London, and purchased through the instrumentality of Dir. L. Gruner in 1860, and since that time has been placed in the Holbein room for the exam- ination and conviction of all interested. \"r We must now refer to the purchase of a Sixtine work which, m consideration of its extraordinarv Madonna, artistic value, and of its celebrity, should have taken precedence of any other picture'; but a due regard for chronological order, as well as its undeniable inner relationship with the pre- viously mentioned Madonna by Holbein, furnish us here with the most suitable opportunity for its discussion. We refer to the acquisition of the celebrated Sixtine Madonna, the gem of the Dresden Gallery. I his work of Raphael s, painted in his best peiiod, the only one in oil that for grandeur of conception and thoroughly intellectual freedom in execution stands fully on the same level as those grandest creations of Christian art, his cartoons for tapestry, was painted, as Vasari informs us, for the principal altar of the Black Friars' Monastery of San Sisto in Piacenza. There it remained until seen with enthusiastic admiration by Augustus III., when still Crown Prince, on a journey to Italy in 1711 — 12, at which time he already formed a resolution to possess himself of it if possible. 27 But not until forty years later, in 1754, did he succeed, through the agency of the painter Carlo Cesare Giovannini, in obtaining it. This artist, (born in Parma 1695, resided in Bolpgna from 1723, and died June 30, 1758) after a careful examination of the condition of the painting, and a detailed report concerning it, effected its purchase for the Dresden Gallery for 20,000 ducats, or 40,000 Roman scudi.* A copy of the picture of the original size was also stipulated for in the sale; this was painted by the Venetian artist Nogari and, as usual, is said to be still considered as the original in the monastery. A painting, similar to ours, exists in Rouen. It is related that an abbess of the Abbey S, Amand in that city had begged a picture of the * A copy of the report of Giovannini concerning a careful examination of the picture in which he was assisted by Dottore Abbate Giov. Batt. Bianconi of Piacenza lies before us ; the original is, according t< a note at the end, in the possession of Gaetano Giordani in Bologna. Giovannini had caused the picture to be taken down from the altar, and expresses first his opinion as to the undoubted genuineness of the painting, which was in fact “cosa veramente rarissima e singo- lare”, as Vasar^ had already remarked. He found but few defective places in the vesture, and dark spots on the body of the Child, which were occa- sioned by a too thick coating of lasur (?) varnish here and there, by the master himself. The picture had suffered more from dryness, as it been standing undisturbed on the altar for more than 200 years. He also discovered that the upper part of the canvas had been turned back, and advised that this should be remedied immediately on its arrival in Dresden. 28 Madonna from the Cardinal d'Amboise in 1508 (?) and that the latter had, in consequence, applied to Raphael, who was at the time painting the picture for Piacenza. Raphael, therefore, made a copy of the picture with the exception of the figure of Sixtus which he exchanged for that of S. Amandus, ^,t whose side he then placed a bishop s mitre and crozier instead of the papal crown <ff our picture. * The painting is said to have been sent to Rouen during Raphael’s life- time. It is of the same size as ours and has recently been lithographed by Aubry le Comte * There has been much discussion concerning the genuineness of this picture and its rivalry with our Madonna; but according to the judg- ment of the best connoisseurs , it \"seems to be admitted that it will not, in any respect, stand a comparison; and we may add that if it were really a masterpiece, such as exists in this city, it would certainly already have been generally known through excellent reproductions. In 1857, during a visit in Rouen, I found the above opinion fully confirmed by my own observation. The picture is, evidently, ‘a later copy with the changes already mentioned; a fact which is sufficiently proved by its heavy, reddish brown tone, and an entire want of the refined spirituality which distinguishes the ori- ginal in every touch of the brush. It will not be superfluous to mention here one other opinion which was firjst advanced by o- x* 1Artist* N°t-Bl. 1827, No. 7. Another feixtme Madonna. A paper by Hofr. Bottcher. 29 a connoisseur of high repute (Bar. von Rumohr), and has since then often been repeated by others, that this splendid picture, from the fact of its having been painted on canvas, was ori- ginally destined to be carried in processions. The circumstance that the picture, contrary indeed to the custom of the time, and to Ra- phael's own habit, was painted on canvas, cannot alone justify such an assumption, one quite in- consistent with the high position of the great artist, and with the almost idolatrous veneration with which he was regarded by his patron, the Pope, by Rome, by Italy, and by his entire age. With all the value that was at that time attached to everything connected with the cere- monies of the Church, there is no instance, so far as I know, of the employment of so cele- brated a master for ‘such work, and if such had really occurred, the painters of the 16th century were possessed of common sense enough to prevent their employing such carefully executed paintings as the one in question for a purpose that would in a short time inevitably have caused their destruction. The age of Leo also was the farthest removed from any such over- pious luxury, and would have been the least of all inclined to appropriate such a work to such a purpose. Independent of the fact that canvas was at that time already coming into general use, and could have been new to Raphael onty as regards its use in oil painting, since it had been employed from the earliest times for tem- pera pictures , and , besides the charm of novelty, had undoubted advantages for a picture intended 30 for transport, the very considerable size of the painting is strongly against the supposition that it was intended for processional uses. The op- ponents of this statement have urged with as much justice as sagacity that with so correct a taste as Raphael possessed, he certainly would not have chosen for a banner, which, even though it were not to float in the wind, must never- theless be in constant motion, the rectilinear, heavy architectural cornice which forms such an appropriate finish for an altar picture, and har- monizes so well with the structure of the altar itself. But was all this, together with the little an- gels below, painted at a later date? And by whom? The simple statement of Vasari also contra- dicts it: “Fece a monaci neri di S. Sisto in Piacenza la tavola dell ’ altar maggiore, dentrovi la nostra Donna con S. Sisto e S. Barbara, cosa veramente rarissima e singolare\". That Vasari calls the picture, which he may only have seen above the altar, a “tavola'\" (panel), is, considering the agreement of the description with the picture in other respects, certainly not decisive. Former This great painting has unfortunately not C°of the\" remained untouched by the ravages of time, as picture. was already mentioned in Giovannini’s report. But it has suffered still more from the copyists of former times, who, in order to bring out more clearly some obscure parts, made unpar- donable use of the most deleterious means ' for instance, of frequent rubbing with a mixture of oil and saliva, which produced dirty spots of the worst kind, especially around the head of' Madonna. 31 All these injuries to the picture were re- Restoration moved under a careful restoration by PalmaroR,^ n?1 182*7 in 1827, at which time the upper part of the curtain and a part of the glory of angels which had been recklessly turned back, was at length unfolded, and the picture restored to its original size, although, as above mentioned, the observant Giovannini had long before discovered the mis- fortune, and recommended its correction. At the end of April or the beginning of May of the year 1754, Giovannini himself brought the Madonna di San Sisto to Dresden, as appears from his letter dated hence May 21, 1754,* and it may be permitted in this place to mention a pleasing tradition connected with the arrival of the picture in this city. King Augustus, impatient to see again the long expected picture, had ordered its immediate unpacking and exhibition in the palace. When it was brought into the throne room, and there was a momentary hesitation as to placing it in the best light, which happened to be just where the throne stood, the King pushed the latter quickly aside with his own royal hand, exclaiming: — “Make room for the great Raphael !” Truly, a right royal speech and a testimony to the equality of intellectual greatness and worldly power which does honour both to him and to his age. * This letter is preserved in the state archives in this city, but it does not mention the exact day of the arrival of the picture. G. left Bologna in Nov. 1 75P» and went to Piacenza. See my Essay on the Sixtine Madonna in A. v. Zahn’s .Tahrbiichern, Sept. 1870. 32 Truly, we owe a large debt of gratitude to those times long since passed away, and es- pecially is this feeling awakened in us when we stand astonished before pictures like the Ma- donnas of Raphael and Holbein, — these purest and most spiritualized, as well as most character- istic works of Italian and German art, — and experience their powerful and silent effect on our hearts. They have indeed been named pearls and gems, but I would rather distinguish them as the “eyes'' in the intellectual features of the Dresden Gallery, — this Rachel of collections! Withdraw them — - the beaming look is wanting — the mysterious seal of divine beauty has vanished ! The heavens would remain, “and what a heaven, star by star'' — but the sun would have disappeared! The spiritual influence of these pictures re- turns upon us with ever renewed power, and when we go from their presence, the utterance of our feelings involuntarily glows into a kind of poetical echo of the profound impressions they have left.* Sie schwebt herab! Die Jungfrau mit dem Kinde, Dess Himmelsblicke ernst die Welt begriissen, In Wolken liegt die Erde ihr zu Fiissen Und Schleier und Gewande wehn im Winde!

After the removal of the Collection to the New Museum, and after the proposed isolated exhibition of the Sixtine Madonna on a kind of altar, had been carried into effect according to the plans of the Court Architect Kruger, it be- came the more necessary to provide an equally worthy place for Holbein's Madonna, as the two paintings have ever been considered the gems of the Dresden Gallery. 3 34 Purchase of Bagna- cavallo’s picture 1755. The first idea was to place this picture also in the cabinet by itself, and in a frame similar to that of the Sixtine Madonna but of smaller dimensions; the first attempt however, proved the difficulty of this arrangement, and the ne- cessity, with figures of such delicate proportions, of arranging a group of kindred subjects, with the Madonna as an appropriate centre. A sketch with this object in view, was made by the author of this catalogue. The design was based on the historical fact that Holbein's painting had never been used as an altar piece, but, in all probability, found its place among the family pictures adorning the walls of a patrician's house in Basle. It received the Royal approval, and the design was carried out in the best manner; under the superintendence of the author and the Court Architect Kruger, by Mr. Tiirpe (Cabinet Maker to His Majesty) and Mr. Elmendorff (Carver in Wood) after models by Hauptmann and Hultzsch. It was placed in the cabinet at Easter 1860, and on its panels, be- sides the central picture by Holbein, are grouped the admirable portrait of Morrett by the same artist; an exquisite female portrait of the same school and character, together with the gem of the Flemish school, viz, the Virgin of Jan van Eyck, and quite recently the magnificent Cruci- fixion by Albert Dtirer. The Gallery is indebted to the same Gio- vannini who effected the purchase of the Sixtine Madonna for another work which, although not of the same importance as the first, is never- theless an excellent one of its kind. This is 35 the imposing altar piece, representing the Ma- donna and saints, by Bartolomeo Ramenghi, better known as Bagnacavallo. The grandeur and simplicity of its conception, and the vig- orous earnestness of its deep and harmonious colouring, can only be thoroughly appreciated since its removal to the rooms of the new Gallery where, it can be seen at a proper dis- tance and its overpowering effect be fully re- cognized. This picture was originally painted for the Convento de? Pellegrini at Bologna whence it had never been removed , its heavy archi- tectural frame which was built into the wall, seeming destined to imprison it there forever. But the strength of mortar yielded to the pow- er of gold, and the stewards of the monastery agreed to the sale in 1755. In order, however, te avoid remark and not to leave the place un- occupied, one of the conditions of the sale was that some other old picture (!) should be given in exchange. It was not of course, easy to find one of precisely the right dimensions; several additions were, therefore, necessary in order to fill up the space within the frame, and these were executed by Giovannini himself. Ramenghi s picture cost but 300 Ducati Ungheri (Hungarian ducats) and it is singular that the old picture, which Giovannini does not even consider worthy to be named, together with his own work was reckoned at 400 Hunga. ducats; even with this addition, however, the cost was but small for so fine a picture. Giovannini as we have seen, died suddenly while still young, June 30 1758, leaving a 3* 36 numerous family in great distress. Count Briihl assisted them with a readiness which does honour to his heart. The poor painter did not, evi- dently, understand the art, so commonly prac- tised in similar cases, of advancing his own in- terest while making his purchases for the King. That this art was familiar to Pietro Guarienti (of whose agency we shall have occasion to speak later) is affirmed by his own friends Crespi and Zanetti in their private letters to Count Briihl ; and many original bills testify very plainly to Rossi's expertness in this respect. But even the polished Algarotti must have caused Count Briihl no little trouble by his pretentions, although he was treated by both the King and the Count in every respect as a nobleman, and received at the same time with the royal order* to purchase pictures in Italy for the Gallery, a sum of 1000 Ducats to de- fray the expenses of the journey, to which similar sums were added from time to time, although his travels extended to no greater a distance from Venice than perhaps to Mantua. His ambition and vanity were mortified in the highest degree at finding himself excluded from a participation in the purchase of the Mo- dena collection, and the negotiation entrusted *This order was received in writing from the King through Count Briihl under date of Feb. 16, 1742. On the 30th- March Algarotti writes from Vienna, and at the beginning of April, from Venice with reference to the purchase of the beautiful pictures by Strozzi which the Gallery obtained through his instrumen- tality. 37 to his opponent Rossi who had already sup- planted him, much to the pecuniary disadvantage of the court, in the purchase of the pictures in Venice. In his irritation, he wrote Briihl a reproachful letter in which he lays full stress on his old Brescian patent of nobility (his brother was nevertheless a banker in Venice) and his illustrious relatives, and which, notwithstanding its poetical flights, ends with an exact account of all the sums which he had saved for the Saxon court in each separate purchase. The in- considerable total of these savings on only 21 pictures amounted to 11,900 ducats; he then offers his own private collection for 6000 ducats — of course conspicuously renouncing all per- sonal advantage in the matter, — and asks for an annual salary of only 1,500 ducats and the title of General Intendant of the Royal pur- chases ! Brtihl's reply declining this offer is a master- piece of diplomatic courtesy, from which even his most determined enemy could not withhold a tribute of admiration. Among those who were especially active in canon Luigi making purchases in Italy was also Canon Luigi Crespi* Crespi, son of the well known painter, Giuseppe Maria Crespi of Bologna, and mention may here be made of his most important purchase, the large painting by Guido Reni, known under the. name of Ninus and Semiramis. This excellent work of Guido's was in the Purchase of collection of the Marchese Giov. Nicolo T anar a , GNinu s^nd* had long been in the possession of the family, Seiniramis. and was probably painted for them. It was, 38 Pietro Gua- rienti.* at that time, supposed to be a representation of Solomon and the queen of Sheba; this de- signation, however, seems, on closer examination, to be less appropriate than the present one, to the action of the picture and to the persons represented. Although somewhat damaged, it was never- theless estimated at a very high value by the owners, and, at first, not less than 10,000 Scudi Romani were demanded for it. The negotiations continued nearly two years, during which time the price materially diminished; but difficulties of another kind arose. The young Marchese Tanara protested against the transaction as being a violation of the right of entailed property, and it required all the clerical influence of our active Canon to obtain the sanction of the Pope to the sale, and to the transport of the picture out of the country. Finally, on the 6th May 1752, the purchase was concluded for the sum of 3000 due. Ungheri, or 6000 Roman scudi, the careful Crespi having previously obtained a detailed certificate from the Academici Clemen- tini di Bologna confirming the genuineness and excellence of the picture. The original certificate, together with the contract of sale are preserved in the archives of the Gallery. Among the more important acquisitions by P. Guarienti, must undoubtedly be reckoned the * A man, for that time, unusually well acquainted with the history of art, as is shown by his edition of the “Abecedario pittorico” of P. Orlandi, Venice, 1753, which he enriched with valuable notices of the Gallery and dedicated to King Augustus III. 39 interesting old copy of Raphaels St. Cecilia, which, without any sufficient grounds, was as- cribed in our early catalogues to Giulio Romano. For this supposition, there is no justification whatever , either in the intellectual conception of the picture, or the freedom of its treatment. It was, moreover, generally known in Bologna, at that time, to be only a good copy by Dionisio Fiamengo (Dion. Calvaert, born about 1565 in • Antwerp; died 1619) and was purchased in 1750 under that designation. No one, however, took the trouble to search for information con- cerning it, although all competent judges had long been of opinion that it could only be the work of some Italianized Netherlander. It is now designated by its true name. Two other very rare works and very im-Pur^e of portant of their kind, by Ercol6 Grandi of b* Ercoie* Ferrara, a master seldom met with out of Italy, were also acquired through the exertions of Guarienti. These are two pictures forming portions of a predella; one representing the prayer on the Mount of Olives, and the betrayal of Christ; the other, Christ bearing the cross. Both are remarkable for peculiar strength of expression and for earnest and characteristic drawing. They are, evidently, two of the three compositions («tre storie\") which Vasari* mentions as forming * Vasari I. p. 394 (Bottari Roman Edition). Ben e vero in quel mentre (while he was painting in S. Piero) fece alcune altre cose, e particolarmente, che si sa la predella dell' Altare maggiore di S. Gio- vanni in monte, nella quale fece tre storie della passione di Christo. 40 the predella of the principal altar of S. Gio- vanni in monte, and were already alluded to as being, in all probability, identical with these by Schorn and E. Forster (E. Forster’s Letters 1838, p. 98). This supposition has been veri- fied by the circumstance, only now ascertained through Crespi’s letters, that the pictures were purchased in 1750 from the sacristy of the church S. Giovanni in monte of Bologna. Crespi relates, on occasion of this acquisition of Guarienti’s, that he himself had added to this work by Grandi, as a present to the Gallery,, a “rarissima opera di Mantegna’’ from the Chiesa dell’ Osservanza in Bologna, an Annunciation painted on wood and now more justly regarded as an early Florentine work. It is a valuable picture , one especially interesting from a historical point of view, and might well have found no admirer with its dry severity and the gay, in- harmonious, tempera colours, at a time when Carlo Maratti was regarded with such admi- ration* (See Crespi’s letter of Oct. 6. 1750). We also meet with the name of Raphael Mengs among those of persons who were en- gaged in the purchase of pictures in Italy, but it appears as if the somewhat pedantic con- scientiousness and German honesty of this excellent There certainly belonged to our two pictures a Ma- donna with the dead Christ in her arms which formed the central portion of the predrella (probably the pic- ture, now in the Royal Institution at Liverpool).

MCCCCL was removed when the picture was restored in 1840. 41 man were not the qualities necessary at that time in Italy , especially in negotiations of this kind. The St. Cecilia by Raphael was privately offered through the painter Becchetti of Bologna for the small sum of 15,000 ducats* It is more than probable that Rossi or AD garotti would, under similar circumstances, have completed the purchase, but the scrupulosity, and the prolix doubts and questionings of the worthy Mengs, which finally exhausted Bruhl s patience, certainly prevented it in the present instance. How favourable this period, generally, was for the acquisition of pictures, and how the im- mense purchase of the Modena Collection by King Augustus had stimulated a kind of passion throughout Italy for speculation in old pictures, is proved by offers for sale of many of the most valuable works of the greatest masters which iu other collections, are the objects of universal admiration at the present day.** * This picture belonged at that time to the heirs — at that time minors, — of the house of Bentivoglio and the guardians were induced to con- sent to the sale principally by one of their number, the Marchese Senatore Angelelli., Besides the above mentioned price, a present was also to be made to the fathers in whose church (S. Giovanni in monte) it had been placed, and the permission to take the picture out of the country (il beneplacito di Roma, che si vuole per l’estrazione) was to be obtained by the purchaser. ** Thus, among others, before the year 1755 were offered to Giovannini for the Dresden Gallery, the so-called “Day”, the celebrated picture by Correggio 42 The purchase of the Madonna di Foligno b}r Raphael from the nuns in Foligno to whom it belonged, was nearly concluded; and it almost seems as if here again, the German agent, in this case the obscure Saxon painter Siegmimd Striebel, was the chief cause of the failure. He imagined, indeed, that for 2000 scudi, and a “copey\" by his own hand, he could obtain the precions gem, although count Bruhl, in the expectation of a much higher demand, had al-' ready deposited 4000 Scudi with Cardinal Albani in Rome, in order that partial payment could immediately be made in case of a purchase. Striebel, who had been sent to Rome merely for the purpose of learning the secret of the manufacture of mosaic, and who intended later do employ the above mentioned' sum for other purchases, was not a little astonished when his Eminence, Cardinal Albani, freely admitted that he had employed it in a “servizio” with a banker in this city, but that he should re- ceive it again the next day!'' — “Now, who knows whether this be true or not?\" he asks with great naivete , in his terribly lengthy letters, 1 and who gave him an order to speculate with the King's money?\" ' The purchase of the Ma- in Parma, for 12,000 sequins, .and later the Violin Player by Raphael, (now in the Sciarra palace in Rome); the half- draped Fornarina by the same master, (now in the Barberini palace), together with a copy of this picture by Giulio Romano; and also in 1754, the most celebrated picture of Domenichino, “Diana and her Nymphs”, at that time and still in the Borghese collection. 43 donna di Foligno, however, was not effected because the secret was not kept, and the Car- dinal Procurator of the monastery protested against it. With what secrecy and prudence it was necessary to proceed in making purchases in Italy, generally, is apparent from a copy of a complete system of cipher which accompanied the instructions ot Pietro Guarienti for purcha- sing paintings in that country, and which he actually employed in his correspondence with Count Briihl. The names of all artists and places weie disguised in this key under fictitious designations; e. g. Giovanni Bellini, became La Tremouillere ; Moretto, Ruysdael; Roma, Turino; Venice. Forli etc. Sequins were called grossi; scudi, traeri (three pfenning pieces), and piaster, fennig. A list of masters not represented in the Gallery and who therefore, were especially to be sought after was also added.* * The author had long studied the unfortunately not very abundant correspondence of Guarienti, and had been surprised to find nothing ol impor- tance named among the purchases, which were chieliy of masters who are neither sought after nor found in Italy at all. Thus, for instance, he writes from Venice, April 2, 1749 to Briihl. “J’ai achete le Bio-aud a Forli de la maison contarim pour GOOfrcs; aussi Francois Porbus et Sprang er 335 frcs.

We must here mention an interesting circum- stance to which the Gallery is indebted for many valuable pictures, as is proved by docu- ments still extant. We refer to the graceful custom of the Royal Consort of Augustus III. of purchasing at the Easter and Michaelmas Fairs in Leipzig, one and often more pictures which were destined for presents to the King, either on his birth day, or name day*, (Namens- tag) and which were subsequently transferred to the Gallery. This excellent custom, which cannot be too highly recommended for imitation, had become so habitual that that the idea might once very naturally occur to the Queen that some variation therein would be agreeable. The Court jeweller had just received from Paris a splendid cane, with a handle set in the richest manner with gold and costly gems , — an exqui- site work and of the newest fashion. The price was, indeed, somewhat more than the sum usually destined for pictures, but the Court Marshal advised its purchase, the Queen decided on the precious cane for her gift on this occasion, * The birthday of Augustus III occurred Oct. 7 : his name day, and that of the -Crown Prince, was March 5. 45 and gave it to his Majesty with her own hand. The King received it with pleasure, regarded it attentively for some time in silence, and then suddenly startled the Queen, as well as the Marshal with the abrupt question: “But where, is my picture?'7* The largest of the mixed purchases is one Purchase of which was effected in 1748, for 50,000 Thalers by a certain Placido Gialdi** and consisted of 69^^^ pictures from the Imperial Gallery of Prague ms. which P. Guarienti had previously selected and marked. This collection contained not only Italian but Dutch pictures, and among the latter some of great value, e. g. the two excellent pictures by van Dyk, Charles I of England, and his Consort; and the magnificent Boar Hunt by Rubens. This purchase, also, was conducted with the greatest secrecy — for what reason is no longer quite clear — but Gialdi pretended to be a- merchant from Holland who had received large payments for supplies delivered to the States General, and who desired to employ his * How sincere the pleasure was which King Au- gustus took in his beloved pictures is shown by nu- merous passages in Riedel’s Journal. Thus in 1750 the King sent him a daily list, written by his own hand, of the pictures which were to be placed in his room and which afterwards formed his private gallery. He went himself to the Japanese Palace to arrange the paintings which were to be sent to Warsaw (1748) and marked with his own hand those he destined for his favourite chateau of Hubertsburg (1754). ** Perhaps only an assumed name for Pietro Guarienti. 46 money in speculations in pictures. It was pro- bably found not disagreeable, in high places, to obtain large sums of money in this unobtrusive manner, for it was at first intended only to sell the collection entire for 300,000 Gulden which offer Gialdi wisely declined. For the selection of 69 paintings, also, double the sum which was finally accepted was at first demanded, but the skilful agent succeeded in. obtaining them for the price above mentioned. That attention in Vienna had been aroused to the transaction, may be surmised from a me- morandum among the documents referring to the sale, according to which eight pictures “at the very least\" are specified as not included in the sale, at the particular request of I. K. M. (Her Imperial Majesty.) Among these, were the Vienna Picture Gallery of Teniers, now in the Belvedere collection, and the above mentioned Boar Hunt of Rubens, which Gialdi seems neverthe- less to have obtained, as well as the less im- portant picture of the Entrance of Henry III. into Venice by Palma the Younger etc. In March 1743, J. G. Riedel had purchased, likewise in Prague, four paintings by Paolo Ver- onese for 4000 Thalers or 6000 florins; these are more particularly described in the Catalogue.* With these exceptions, only single memo- randa were, for the most part, found among the documents, sometimes longer lists appeared * According to the somewhat illegible signature to the receipt preserved in the archives, they seem, to have belonged to Count Jos. Pallffy. 47 having reference to works of more importance, but even in such cases a closer examination showed that but few of these works were still in the Gallery, and joy over the discovery of an expected treasure gave place to bitter dis- appointement, which was often the result ot a most extraordinary combination of circumstances. This was the case particularly with a list of seventeen pictures of the most celebrated masters, mostly Dutch, to which considerable prices were attached and which are marked as: “achete a la Vente du Cabinet du feu Mr. Guille. Lor- mier a la Haye\". The purchase was effected at the Hague Sept. 27. 1763 by the Saxon Coun- sellor of Legation von Kauderbach, under Bruhl s auspices, and for the large sum of 16,354 flo- rins Dutch currency, or 8732 Thaler 12 gr. (ex- clusive of about 500 florins expenses;) but on the death of King Augustus III., Oct. 5. of that year, an order was immediately given that the pictures should be • sold at once , as the Elector Christian, the successor of Augustus, did not wish to retain them. Briihl died Oct. 28., follow- ing his beloved patron within a few days, and it was with difficulty that Counsellor von Kauder- bach succeeded in convincing his successor, that an immediate sale would be very detrimental to the interests of the Court; that, on the contrary, the pictures should be sold singly, as oppor- tunities offered. This advice was finally acted upon, but purchasers were found sooner than was expected, and, on the death of the Elector Christian, which occurred Dec. 17. 1763, after a reign Of only two months, when an order was 48 received from Dresden to desist from the sale, there were unfortunately only four of the seven- teen pictures left. These four, among which is the Entombment of Christ by Rembrandt, are still in the Gallery, and are more particularly mentioned in the Catalogue. A long series of pictures was obtained also through Count Gotter, Prussian Ambassador to Vienna; unfortunately but few of them were even good and almost none were of any real value. Many of them were employed at once for the decoration of rooms in the various pa- laces, and were not transferred to the Gallery at all, or were only placed among the so-called “Reserve\". Paintings of greater value were ob- tained in Prague through Leplat from the col- lection of Countess Wrzowecz, Juni 15. 1723; among others, the beautiful Flemish copy of the x celebrated Leda of Michael Angelo which may have been painted by Rubens himself, sev- eral beautiful portraits by van Dyk, etc. There was also a purchase in 1741 of 268 pictures from Count Wallenstein's collection in the palace at Dux; as, however, no particular account of them can be found, a few only can be identified, and among these there is but little of value. In Pairs also, many acquisitions were made, and especially in the Flemish and Dutch schools many of value. This was particularly the case with a purchase made in 1742 from the col- lection left by Prince Amadeus of Carignan, through the agency of Mr. De Brays, Saxon Se- cretary of Legation in Paris, and of a Mr. Noel 49 Araignon, Ecuyer Valet de Chambre de la Reine etc., who had secured in advance a considerable number of the best pictures from the above named , collection * The greater number of these pictures were purchased at the same time by Louis XV. and are still in the Gallery of the Louvre** De Brays afterwards bought seven other, mostly valuable, pictures for 17,800 livres from the collection of Mr. Dubreuil, likewise Ecuyer et premier Valet de Chambre de la Reine etc. Among these were the beautiful painting of Rubens' sons by himself, and of Madame de Montespan with the young Due de Maine, by C. Netscher. Of the two Poussins which the col- lection contained, one, although said to be a celebrated picture, known under the name “Poussin a la Pie , and representing a sleeping nymph with Cupids, was rejected, and only the companion picture, the nymph Syrinx fleeing from Pan, which is still in the Gallery, was taken. To this period belongs also the acquisi- tion of the large and excellent picture by Jacob * The auction itself did not take place until June 18. 1743. ** It was a particularly fortunate circumstance that the original documents concerning the purchase of these last named pictures by Araignon himself, were sent here at the time of our purchase, and that their fortunate preservation enabled the under- signed to furnish the author of the excellent Cata- logue of the Louvre, Mr. F. Villot of Paris with an exact account of the purchase, at that time, of a- bout thirty of the most valuable pictures. One of these is the celebrated little painting by Raphael known as the “Vierge au linge”, (engraved by Boucher- Desnoyers). 4 50 Jordaens, Diogenes looking for Men, which De Brays obtained for 1500 livres from Mr. Lambert, an English banker in Paris, and some other fine pictures, all of which are particularly men- tioned in the Catalogue. In all these purchases, Hiacynthe Rigaud, the renowned painter, who was, at that time, living in Paris, assisted with his valuable ad- vice. Having in 1726 painted the portrait of Augustus III. while still Crown Prince , for which he had received a considerable sum, besides be- ing honoured with a large gold ornament con- taining a miniature of the King, he had re- mained since that time in intimate relations with the Court and the Embassy in Paris. It was also from Rigaud that De Brays purchased one of our finest portraits by Rembrandt. De Brays died Nov. 30. 1742, and Rigaud only one year later, Dec. 27. 1743. The consignment of the pictures from Paris was generally effected through a certain Le Leu who appears to have been a kind of agent for the Saxon Court, and who afterwards made a few purchases, among which are some of the finest Wouvermans in our Gallery*. * That Le Leu was for the most part employed ■only as an agent for the forwarding of goods in ge- neral , and not of pictures alone , is evident from se- veral bills in which, among all the consignments of pictures from the “Capitale du monde”, there occur also items for “dentelles pour la Princesse Royale”; parcels of “pat^s de Perigueux et d’Angouleme” for Dresden, and accounts of expenses for Meissen por- celain received “pour M. la Dauphine” in Paris. 51 With justifiable pride and mournful pleasure we must here mention one of the most impor- tant of the recent acquisitions, one for which we are indebted to the generous care and to the deep love of Art of our beloved and vene- rated sovereign Frederick Augustus. We refer to the purchase, in June 1853, of fifteen pic- tures of the Spanish school which had been un- til that time very imperfectly represented in our Gallery. Nearly all these paintings, which are more particularly noticed in the Catalogue, belonged to the celebrated collection of King Louis Philippe, which, in consequence of well known historical events which transpired in France, was sent to England, and afterwards came under the hammer of the auctioneer in London. A very fine, solemn, and grand picture by Murillo, painted in his best period, representing St. Rodriguez, the Martyr, is the principal on6 in this purchase, for which we are chiefly indebted to the knowledge and skill of Dir. L. Gruner, at that time residing in London. The collection was obtained for the low sum of £ 579. 22 s.* ‘ His Majesty, the late King John, from the time of his accession, devoted no less attention to the interests of the Gallery, the protection and advancement of which, have become a praise- * In 1745, one hundred and eight pictures had already been bought by through Louis Talon, Secretary to the Saxon Embassy in Madrid for 4146 Thalers, but these included few of as much importance as, for example , the Dorinda by Guercino ; some of them so far as they can be identified, are more particu- larly mentioned in the Catalogue. 4*. 52 worthy and even hereditary characteristic of the Royal Family of Saxony. Besides the beautiful little picture by Rogier van der Weyde, already mentioned in the first 'edition of the catalogue as having been purchased by his order, a valu- able addition was made to the Gallery of a number of pictures collected by the late Prof. M. Steinla, the celebrated engraver, chiefly during his residence in Italy. This * collection, consisting of 23 pictures, almost exclusively works of the old Italian schools, seemed well adapted to supply a want in the Royal Picture Gallery, and was purchased in 1857 by order of the King. It was obtained for the moderate price of 1371 Thalers 15 Ngr., and the several pictures are mentioned in the catalogue as “from Prof. Steinla's Collection”. The artist added a small, so-called “Pieta” of the school of Giotto, and his own portrait painted by himself in 1826, as a present to the Royal Picture Gallery. The second large acquisition made under the auspices of his late Majesty, was effected in 1860, on the occasion of the sale by auction of the pictures and drawings forming part of the effects of Art Dealer, Samuel Woodburne. Attention having been early drawn by Director Schnorr von Carolsfeld and others to this rare opportunity of securing valuable additions from the earlier periods of Italian art, the author of this catalogue, and Prof. L. Gruner, Director of the Royal Cabinet of Engravings, received a Royal order to repair to London to make pur- chases, not only for the Royal Picture Gallery, but also for the Royal Collection of Drawings and Engravings. Two most valuable pictures were obtained, one, by Luca Signorelli, a Holy Family with Angels, the principal picture of the Woodhurne collection; the other, an equally valuable youth- ful work of Leonardo da Vinci, a Madonna and Child with the infant John. Four other small and interesting pictures by earty Italian masters were bought at the same sale, and are particularly mentioned in the catalogue. The two first named works by Signorelli and Leonardo, are justly entitled from their high artistic value, to take a place among the chief treasures of the collection; the more so, if we consider the early period of the develop ment of Italian art to which both belong. Signorelli's painting exhibits in a picture of considerable dimensions that earnest and solemn character of Florentine art in the pre-Raphaelit<' period, which is perfectly shown in its beauti ful, and almost symmetrical arrangement, in the characteristic style of the forms, and especially in the drapery , as well as in the rich and brilliant tone of the colouring which loses nothing of its power seen even by the side of Correggio. To this must be added the circumstance that easel pic- tures by this great master, whose frescoes in the cathedral of Orvieto served as models for Michael Angelo, are extremely rare even in Italy. The picture by Leonardo da Vinci was de- signated in the catalogue of the Woodburne collection as a work by Lorenzo di Credi, but was immediately recognized by the undersigned 54 as a youthful production of Leonardo, and, as such, as a work of the highest value. When the picture arrived in this city, the Gallery Committee were also unanimously of this opinion and it scarcely needed the farther confirmation which was afterwards most unexpectedly found, although this rendered any subsequent doubt all but impossible. A drawing was found quite by chance in the Cabinet of Drawings, in this city, which proved to be the study for the Madonna in the above mentioned picture; this drawing has from time immemorial belonged to the collection under the name of Leonardo, and like the picture itself fully corresponds in its character to this name. The relation between this valuable drawing which is in pencil and on parchment, and the picture in the Gallery was also acknowledged by the Gallery Committee after a careful exa- mination and comparison of the two at a meet- ing Febr. 1. 1861, at which Director L. Gruner was also present. As already remarked, this circumstantial, and by no means unimportant, evidence was scarcely necessary in presence of the striding internal proofs of the excellence of the picture which must of themselves remove all doubt, in the minds of connoisseurs as to the authorship of the work. Who besides Leonardo da Vinci, it may confidently be asked, could at that time (about 1470), have produced a picture of such gran- deur of arrangement, such depth of feeling and grace, combined with such astonishing breadth of execution? Look, for instance, at the vase at the side of the bed, scarcely to be seen with 55 the unaided eye; and at the wonderful delicacy in the execution of the landscape, almost sur- passing that of van Eyck and Memlingk, if not in picturesqueness, at least in drawing. It is moreover characterised by a classic beauty of arrangement, a high ideality in the little head of the Madonna, and a depth of feeling in the adoring St. John, such as are rarely to be found in the works of any period. That the great Florentine should, in his later works, have sur- passed his earlier efforts, no more diminishes the value of this picture of his youth than could the contemplation of the Sixtine Madonna, the work of the mature artist, lessen the interest with which we look at the Sposalizio, the pro- duction of Raphael's younger years. The chann of the modest bud is not diminished by the side of the full blown rose. It may therefore well be considered as a fortunate circumstance that the Dresden Gallery was thus once more enriched by the great name of Leonardo, which had been wanting there, since the magnificent portrait of Morrett was justly restored to its author, Hans Holbein the Younger. The Gallery is also indebted to his late Majesty for the present of two pictures left by Her Royal Highness, Princess Louise (who died # in Rome), which are mentioned in the catalogue ; also for the recent acquisition of a highly inte- resting picture of the early German school. This is, evidently, a copy of the celebrated engraving of Albr. Diirer, and represents the kneeling St. Hubert, at the moment when the miraculous stag, with the crucifix between his 56 horns, appears before him. In addition to the great artistic value of the picture, and the ra- rity of such representations in our Gallery, it is connected with the collection by historical associations which render its acquisition the more desirable ' and interesting. An inscription on the back of the picture, coupled with several other historical proofs, makes it highly probable that it formerly be- longed to the Gallery in Hubertsburg, the fa- vourite chateau of Augustus III. It may have been carried away in 1761, during the Seven Years' War and exactly a hundred years later, it returned to the original owner, by purchase from Prof. Th. von Oer, whose property it had become, and who, with praiseworthy disin- terestedness, sold it for 128 Thalers, the trifling sum which he had paid for it. The most important of the recent acquisitions are: — 1st an admirable landscape by C. Pous- sin, unique of its kind in respect of its deli- cate execution and truth to nature. It was purchased in 1862 for £ 250, from Mr. Alexander Allen; 2nd. A picture of great merit by Casar van Everdingen, whose works are rare even in Holland, representing Bacchus, Pomona and Flora, was purchased in 1865, for 25 Louisd’or, of Conservator J. D. Dreyer of Bremen, 3d. The most valuable, however, of the recent additions is undoubtedly the unrivalled picture of Christ on the Cross by Albrecht Dtirer, pur- chased in 1865 for 4400 florins, at the sale by auction of the pictures of the late Jos. Daniel Bohm, Engraver in the Imperial Mint in Vienna. Since 1873, in consequence of an important increase of the funds appropriated to the pur- chase of paintings; a number of works by both old and modern masters have been added to the Gallery. These are mentioned in the sup- plement to the catalogue. We have perhaps devoted too much time for the taste of most of our readers, to the subject of these acquisitions; and yet there are losses as well as additions to be recorded in connection with the fortunes of so important a collection. These, happily, in the present case are not numerous. One of the greatest privations mentioned in the extant documents, is the sale of 132 paintings mostly by Cranach and other early German masters. They had not actually been incorporated m the Collection, and were trans- ferred to the often mentioned Herr von Heineken, June 21. 1756, for 7900 Thalers, a sum which had been previonsly paid by him* Pictures still more valuable than the above, seem to have been disposed of in 1796, at an auction which Count Marcolini , at that time General Director of the various collections, or- dered to be held for the sale of duplicates only. This circumstance is much to be regretted, yet in comparison with the number of pictures in the collection , the sale seems , fortunately , not * Heineken caused 32 of these pictures to be sold by auction in Paris through the above mentioned Le Lem; some others were disposed of in Hamhurg. What became of the remainder is unknown. 58 to have been very important, the disapprobation of all patriots and lovers of art soon causing the auctions to be discontinued*. The greatest loss, in every respect, was oc- casioned by the destruction of the magnificent chateau of Hubertsburg in 1760, in which the collection of paintings was entirely destroyed, scarcely half a dozen, according to J. A. Riedel's account, being saved and these only in the most pitiable condition. How large the collection must have been, may be imagined from the fact that in 1750, one hundred and ninety pic- tures were put aside as copies or duplicates. But treasures so celebrated, and so univer- sally admired could not fail to tempt the cupi- dity of the robber, and we accordingly find, in the archives accounts of several thefts. With the exception of some of minor importance, the stolen pictures were however speedily recovered**. * It is related that among the pictures sold, there were some large Canalettos, of which there is no want in the Gallery; and further that Prof. Dam- stedt, a celebrated landscape engraver, was one of those who were particularly successful in their efforts to stop the sales, which were said to have yielded only the insignificant sum of 679 Thalers. ** According to the old inventory of 1722 and following years: Nr. 174.

This circum- stance may perhaps justify a more detailed ac count of the facts, taken from a report by Dr. Christian Hauschild (Kammer- Commissions -Rath) which was translatedintoltalianfor Count Marcolini. On the 22 nd of Oct. 1788, Joh. Ant. Riedel, at that time Inspector, reported to Count Mar- colini, his superior in office, the distressing fact that in the previous unusually stormy night, a grated window in the Gallery had been broken through by a daring robber , and the following pictures stolen: 1st. The celebrated Magdalene by Correggio. 2nd. The Judgment of Paris by van der Werff. 3rd. The Head of an old man with hat and white feather by Seybold**. Nr. 1809. Rotenhammer: Diana’s Bath, stolen under Inspector Demiani. Another passage in J. A. Riedels’s Diary for 1747, mentions the theft of the following pictures by the fire watch who kept the keys of the room containing the reserved pictures: “A man at a table , smoking tobacco , by Franz van Mieris ; and two small ordinary pictures re- presenting persons in conversation, by Xavier. The first of these pictures seems to have been recovered , as one fully corresponding to the descrip- tion is still in the Gallery. * Likenesses of Wogaz are found in four dif- ferent etchings. ** So Riedel described it in the excitement of the moment; the one referred to is the Portrait of an old man with a spotted fur cap. See Catalogue. 60 Count Marcolini immediately ordered an ad- vertisement to be printed and posted everywhere, promising a reward of one thousand ducats to anyone who should return the pictures. A circumstance mentioned in the report is remarkable as characteristic of the period, and seems almost comical admidst the general con- sternation. In the midst of his anxiety, Riedel received an anonymous letter dated from Gera, Oct. 29, in which the writer earnestly urges that these words: Agmoet, melach,«* Aglat, Aglat, Delay. t t t t t should be placed over the door and broken window of the Gallery as a sure means of caus- ing the thief to ‘return the stolen pictures! It was, however unnecessary to test the infallibility of this Supernatural device , the pro- mise of a reward had already produced better results. At 4 o’clock in the morning of the 26th, a poor lamplighter, while extinguishing the lamps on the way leading to the Zwinger- wall, found a small box containing the pictures by van der Werff and Seybold, together with an anonymous letter directed to His Serene Highness the Elector, “to be opened with his own hand’, which he immediately carried to the main guard -house in the neighborhood. The anonymous writer of the letter de- manded that the promised reward of one thou- sand ducats should be deposited in an appointed place, a hole near a milestone on a pathway leading across the fields to Hecht’s vineyard and the forest beyond the Schwarzen Thor — 61 Black Gate — in Neustadt, after which the third picture, Correggio's Magdalene, would be found on the same spot. Truly, a clumsy strategem, and one which could not fail of leading to the discovery of the thief, to which end it was in fact skilfully employed. A small box containing an ambiguous reply was deposited in the appointed place which was strictly watched by foresters. In the meantime, it had been ascertained that a certain Wogaz* had spoken with another person concerning the printed advertisement, and had, on that occasion, made very particular in- quires as to the value of the precious stones in the frame of the Magdalene, and as- to the pos- sibility of selling them. This circumstance was the more suspicions as Wogaz was generally considered to be a man of bad character, and had already been tried for stealing bee -hives, moreover, lived in the immediate neighborhood of the above mentioned milestone. The grounds for suspecting Wogaz multiplied and when an opportunity occurred for requiring a receipt, under his own hand, for some mili- tary transports previously carried out by him, the similarity of the hand writing to that of the anonymous letter accompanying the two pic- tures, removed all further doubt. Wogaz and his family were arrested on the ! 8 th of November. The crafty thief stoutly de- * Johann Georg Wogaz proprietor of some land ; near the new suburb before the Schwarzen Thor. 62 nied everything, and made every possible eva- sion, but when, after a careful search through his house, the picture of the Magdalene was placed before him, he fainted, and afterwards made a full confession. He had hidden the picture so carefully in the hayloft of his house, which had apparently been arranged for the reception of stolen articles, that it was not found until a second careful search had been made; it was then discovered with other articles purloined from churches and individuals, under the boards of the floor near the chimney. In the same place lay also the larger gilt frame, and the small silver one, together with the precious stones broken out of the frame which they had adorned, and which no doubt had particularly excited the cupidity of the un- happy culprit. A second public advertisement quieted the apprehensions of all lovers of art, and of the excited public in general lest such an exquisite work, unique of its kind, was lost forever. The costly frame, however, the probable cause of the robbery, was subsequently withdrawn from the painting*.
