Mat: blue card with gold stripe, similar to a ‘Mariette mount’.\n\nCOMMENTS: Coriolanus was a Roman general who was banished from Rome. He planned an assault on the city but his wife, mother and children pleaded with him not to attack, which is the scene depicted here. The tale was related by Livy, Plutarch and other early sources.\n\nThis and the following drawing (Benesch 01B, q.v.) seem to be by the same hand and are highly problematic. If by Rembrandt, which for various reasons seems unlikely, they must have been made much earlier than anything else we know, as Benesch surmised, dating them to 1624-25. As well as with Jan Lievens,[1] there are analogies with Govert Flinck and Gerbrand van den Eeckhout (to whom Benesch 01B was formerly attributed). There are also comparable qualities in paintings by Paulus Lesire of 1632-33 (see Sumowski, Gemälde, nos.1137-9), but he is unknown as a draughtsman and the characterful expressions of some of the figures in these two drawings – especially the present one – seem to be the work of a sharper artist. Bevers has suggested Jan Victors (without, however, including no.0001B). Certainly it seems close to some other drawings that Sumowski and he have assigned to Victors, although these drawings could perhaps be the work of an earlier pupil or associate. The pose of the kneeling figure may be inspired by Rembrandt’s representation of ‘Judas returning the thirty pieces of silver’ of 1629, now in an English private collection (Bredius 539A, Corpus A15; see further under no.8).\n\nIn 2020 another possibility occurred, after encountering again an image of a painting once thought to be by the short-lived Willem Bartsius (c.1612 – 1638 or later), depicting Queen Esther Preparing to Visit Ahasuerus, in which a comparable kneeling woman appears.[2] Could our drawing be by this painter?\n\nSummary attribution: Anonymous.\n\nDate: 1625-35.\n\nCOLLECTION: F Paris, Musée du Louvre (inv.22949).\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Paris, 1933, no.1240, repr. pl.72 (early Rembrandt school, c.1630); Van Regteren Altena, 1956, p.59, repr. fig.3 (early Rembrandt, 1624-26); Rosenberg, 1959, p.118; Bauch, 1960, p.232, repr. fig.193b; Benesch, 1, 1973, no.01A, Addenda 1 (Rembrandt c.1624-25); Broos, 1975-76, p.209, n.17 (not Rembrandt); Amsterdam, 1985, under no.77, n.3 and n.10 (no longer considered to be by Rembrandt; composition inspired by Rembrandt’s painting of David before Saul now in Basel, Bredius 488, Corpus A9); Arquié, Labbé and Bicart-Sée, 1987, p.453; Exh.

Paris, 1988-89 (see literature); the technique, facial expressions and handling of drapery compares with Lievens’s Presentation of Christ in the Temple, now also in the Louvre (Sumowski 1627*; Exh. Paris, 1988-89, no.VI).\n\n[2] See Van Haute, 2008, pp.226-27, repr. fig.9, who rejected the previous attribution to Bartsius; oil on canvas, 118 x 156 cm. Aachen, Private Collection.

No watermark; chain lines 25v.\n\nCOMMENTS: See Benesch 01A. Formerly the drawing was attributed to Gerbrand van den Eeckhout and, as Benesch pointed out, so was the painting of David before Saul now in Basel when it was sold in 1909 (Bredius 488, Corpus A9), with which he compared the drawing.\n\nCondition: a fold right of centre.\n\nSummary attribution: Anonymous\n\nDate: 1625-35\n\nCOLLECTION: NL Amsterdam Rijksmuseum (Rijksprentenkabinet; inv.1956:4)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Exh.

The composition is inspired by Pieter Lastman’s painting of the same subject, dated 1617, now in the Rembrandthuis, Amsterdam, and by Rembrandt’s etching (Bartsch 40). Benesch and others before him had seen this, for Rembrandt, uncharacteristic drawing as exhibiting qualities of youthful incompetence. In fact the style – perhaps especially in the scribble at the lower right – relates to Eeckhout, as was first recognised by Sumowski.\n\nSummary attribution: Gerbrand van den Eeckhout?\n\nDate: 1664?\n\nCOLLECTION: D Bremen, Kunsthalle (inv.1876), formerly (currently R St Petersburg, Hermitage).\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Pauli, 1911, p.122; Exh.

Hamburg-Bremen, 2000-2001).\n\nFirst posted 4 June 2012.\n\nBenesch 0002\n\nSubject: Oriental Ruler on Horseback (The Triumph of Mordechai?)\n\nMedium: Pen and brown ink.\n\n160 x 136\n\nCOMMENTS: In Sumowski (S.772) as by Van den Eeckhout, dating from c.1665-70, and with the plausible suggestion that the image represents Mordechai. The turban and cloak echo Pieter Lastman’s 1624 painting of the subject in the Rembrandthuis.[1] However, an attribution to Govert Flinck appears more likely for this and many other drawings that Benesch ascribed to the young Rembrandt (see Schatborn, 2010).[2] Compare the embryonic heads below to that in the centre of Benesch 0454, and the style in general to Benesch 0080 and 0084, for example. Both the style and the subject, treated by Rembrandt in his etching of c.1641 (Bartsch 40), suggest a date c.1640.[3]\n\nSummary attribution: Govert Flinck?\n\nDate: 1640??\n\nCOLLECTION: Private Collection (Sheldon and Leena Peck, Boston)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: HdG 1361; Österreichische Kunsttopographie, 2, 1908, p.354, repr. fig.439; Benesch, 1, 1954/73, no.2 (Rembrandt, c.1625-26); van Gelder, 1955, p.395, n.2 (later date than Benesch); Regteren Altena, 1955, p.120 (early work by Lievens); Rosenberg, 1956.I, p.66 (18th century imitation of Rembrandt); Sumowski, 1956-57, pp.259 and 272, repr. fig.23 (Eeckhout); Muller, 1958, p.83 (Lastman influence); Bauch, 1960, p.256, n.79 (Eeckhout); Haverkamp-Begemann, 1961, p.20 (perhaps by Van den Eeckhout, following Sumowski, 1956-57); Rotermund, 1963, p.105 (Rembrandt); Broos, 1970, p.102, n.6 (probably a sketch for the horseman in Munich painting of the Raising of the Cross, Bredius 548; Wetering 108); Campbell, 1971, p.17 (Rembrandt, c.1624, perhaps based on Lastman); Broos, 1972, p.102, n.6 (Rembrandt); Sumowski, 1972, p.483, n.4 (Eeckhout); Broos, 1977, p.99; Sumowski 772 (Eeckhout, c.1665-70); Amsterdam, 1985, under no.77, n.10 (no longer considered to be by Rembrandt); Exh.

(Eeckhout).\n\n[1] Exh. Amsterdam, 1991, no.17, repr..\n\n[2] I first annotated my marked copy of Benesch with Flinck’s name in February 1989; in 2004 I suggested this attribution to P. Schatborn, who concurred in an email of 3 February of that year; but it does not feature in Schatborn, 2010. In an email of 6 July 2012 he states that ‘Flinck would not be a too bad attribution’.\n\n[3] Broos, 1970, p.102, suggested the drawing might be a sketch for the horseman in Munich painting of the Raising of the Cross, painted for the stadholder in 1633 (Bredius 548; Wetering 108), and it could be that, rather than a preparatory study, the drawing was derived from that source.\n\nFirst posted 4 June 2012.\n\nBenesch 0003\n\nSubject: Study of an Oriental Archer\n\nVerso: See inscriptions\n\nMedium: Red and white chalk (the latter only around the nearer hand and in the sheath of the sword; the red chalk is darker than in the related two drawings in Munich, Benesch 4 and 5); two sets of ruled framing lines, one in pen and brown ink, the other in graphite. Inscribed lower right, in pen and brown ink, by Heucher: “Van Segen” [referring to Ludwig van/von Siegen; Dittrich, 2003, p.66 suggests this could refer to Lastman’s father, Pieter Zeegersz.]; inscribed verso in red chalk: “No.2” and “Van Segen or Egl” and in graphite: “1”.

Watermark: none.[1] Paper is pale cream, not especially smooth, with some lumps.\n\nMount: modern only.\n\nCOMMENTS: By Rembrandt, but in a highly Lastmanesque mode. See also Benesch 0004-5, which together with the present sheet form a homogeneous group. As Benesch pointed out, an archer with a comparable headdress and with a bow in his right hand appears in Rembrandt’s early painting, David Presenting the Head of Goliath to Saul of c.1627, now in Basel (Bredius 488; Corpus A9).\n\nA sketch was made after the drawing by C.W.E. Dietrich in c.1732.[2] In the Dresden inventory of 1865 it was regarded as an anonymous Dutch drawing and was first connected with Rembrandt by Lippmann.\n\nCondition: Generally excellent; hole towards lower left (poorly repaired); a graze in shadows of nearer arm.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt.\n\nDate: 1627?\n\nCOLLECTION: D Dresden, Kupferstich-Kabinett (Inv.

Benesch rightly felt, like Wegner (Munich, 1973), that the link with the style of Rembrandt’s teacher, Pieter Lastman, is here particularly marked, and Wegner (Exh. Munich, 1957) compared figures in Lastman’s Triumph of Sesostris of 1631 (San Francisco, M.H. de Young Memorial Museum) which Rembrandt may have seen before it was completed, as the drawing seems to be earlier than this (though the connection is only generic). Hofstede de Groot thought of a St Simon of Cyrene in a Christ carrying the cross.

Robinson: “JCR” (L.1433); inscribed verso in graphite, top right: “28” and in pen and brown ink: “301” and “11”; in graphite, lower right: “d”.\n\n193 x 148 Watermark: none.\n\nCOMMENTS: A documentary drawing, as the verso is connected with the painting of ‘Judas Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver’, now in an English private collection, of 1629 (Bredius-Gerson 539A; Wetering 23). Two other related drawings are known, Benesch 0008 and Benesch 0009 recto (qqv; Benesch called the verso of Benesch 9 the recto and vice versa). Benesch 0009 recto also shows a third figure with a tall hat, visible embryonically in the present drawing, which was probably made later but before Benesch 8 (qv for a fuller discussion of the drawings related to the painting). The seated figure on the left here has generic links with Benesch 0007 and Benesch 0049.\n\nThe recto of Benesch 0006 has some links to Rembrandt’s somewhat later painting of the same subject, the Raising of the Cross, now in Munich, of c.1633 (Bredius 548; Corpus, A69). For the design, Rembrandt may have been inspired by various sources, including a woodcut Albrecht Altdorfer (Bartsch 29; New Hollstein w.29)[1] and an etching by Jacques Callot (Lieure 547),[2] though this is less close. Rubens’s celebrated altarpiece of 1611 in the Cathedral at Antwerp might have been known to Rembrandt through copies.[3] Another, school drawing, a variation of the same composition, is in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (inv.48.1110) and may reflect a later stage of the development of Rembrandt’s painting.[4] Compare also Benesch 0083, probably by Govert Flinck, another variant that depends closely on the painting as completed.\n\nThe style of both the recto and verso is instructive for understanding Rembrandt at this early stage of his career. The variety of touch, often somewhat scratchy, and the eccentric, almost jerky outlines, are a feature of many drawings of the Leiden years.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt*.\n\nDate: c.1628-29.\n\nCOLLECTION: NL Rotterdam Museum Boijmans van Beuningen (inv.R 89).\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Exh.

Although Lastmanesque and Lievensesque in style and technique, with red and black chalks combined on yellowish paper, the sheet has documentary status because of its connection with the Melbourne painting dated 1628, thought to represent Sts Peter and Paul in discussion (Bredius 423; Corpus A13). Primarily a drapery study, only minor alterations exist between the figures in the drawing and painting: chiefly the painted figure is turned slightly more to the left so that, for example, his nose is no longer visible. His beard is also shorter and the pentimento in the right knee of the drawing is decided in favour of the lower variant. The folds in nearest parts of the drapery are simplified in the painting, although X-radiographs of the latter reveal that it originally followed the drawing somewhat more closely.[1] No other drawings related to the same painting are known.\n\nSee Benesch 56 for a drawing with the same watermark.[2]\n\nCondition: some stains near top edge, especially two at top left.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt*.\n\nDate: 1628?\n\nCOLLECTION: D Berlin Kupferstichkabinett (Inv.

Verso: Pen and brown ink. Inscribed verso in graphite, lower left: ’36’.\n\n112 x 146. Watermark: none; chain lines 22v. Mat: modern only.\n\nCOMMENTS: A documentary sheet because of its connection with the painting of Judas Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver, of 1629 (private collection; Bredius-Gerson 539A; Wetering 23). The drawing is unusual as it is one of the very few complete composition studies from Rembrandt’s Leiden period that has come down to us (the others being Benesch 6 recto and, at a stretch, Benesch 21 and 57a). Benesch 0006 verso and Benesch 0009 verso are also related to details of the same painting, but appear to have been made earlier than Benesch 8: X-radiographs of the painting suggest that Rembrandt initially planned to include the high priest towards the left of the composition, closer to the arrangement in Benesch 6 verso and 9 verso, whereas here he is moved to the more central position that he occupies in the final picture. In Benesch 9 verso, the figure was covered in white bodycolour but has become visible again with time.\n\nBecause of the position of the high priest, Benesch 0008 was possibly drawn after the painting was begun (as argued by Corpus, 1, 1982), between the two ‘states’ of the painting, the first revealed by X-radiographs, the second by the final surface. The drawing, like the first version of the painting, includes a prominent standing figure seen from behind and a central pool of light, whereas in the second version, the figure is omitted and the source of the brightest light is moved to near to the left edge of the painting, from the open Bible. This allowed Rembrandt to show the light ebbing away all across the canvas in an extraordinary compositional tour-de-force which is not anticipated here – the main light source appears to emanate from the other side of the above-mentioned standing figure. The latter also resembles the one to the left of centre in the painting of the Tribute Money in Ottawa, National Gallery of Canada (Bredius 536; Corpus C7), for which see under Benesch 0010, a drawing that seems to rework the same idea, though in reverse. The genesis of these two contemporary paintings may have been intertwined.\n\nThe seated figure seen in profile towards the left was sketchily rehearsed in Benesch 0006 verso and relates generically to Benesch 0049, but his companion to the right is here obliterated or changed into the standing figure. Benesch 0009 verso again shows the two seated figures and therefore seems also to have been sketched before the present sheet, and probably also before Benesch 0006 verso.[1]\n\nHowever, the evolution of Rembrandt’s picture was complicated and cannot be readily reconstructed in detail; the sketchy style of the present drawing differs from those studies that Rembrandt clearly made after he had started work on other projects – drawings in which he was, effectively, making copies after his own prototypes while trying out possible improvements (see, for example, Benesch 0292, Benesch 0423 and Benesch 0442). The combination of the loosely handled chalk with the pen and brush gives the overall impression of an initial design rather than a developmental sketch. Given its roughed-out qualities, Benesch 0008 could have been made at the outset of his work on the design, like most preparatory drawings in the history of art.\n\nThe slight sketch on the verso, only revealed soon before the 2011 auction of the drawing, presumably relates to the same design, although the figures are juxtaposed in a way that reminds one of the subject of Christ giving the keys to St Peter, or even the Return of the Prodigal Son. The ‘Judas’ figure is comparable, but the standing figure by him, perhaps the high priest, seems to stretch out his arms in blessing.[2] The drawing was abandoned by Rembrandt immediately after the first outlines were sketched in, giving us a rare glimpse of his habit of setting down the thinnest of outlines as an initial armature, which he then usually elaborated with the heavier strokes of a more highly-charged pen.\n\nA copy after the recto, with minor differences including a ‘clarification’ of the figure of Judas, is in Munich.[3]\n\nCondition: Good, though lightly foxed, and where there is wash over the light ink to the right, the ink appears drained.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt*\n\nDate: 1628-29.\n\nCOLLECTION: USA, Private Collection.\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Meder, 1922, p.11, repr. pl.39; Bauch, 1933, p.194, repr. fig.62; Valentiner 461 (wrongly listed as HdG 1421); Benesch, 1935, p.9; Benesch, 1947, no.6, repr.; Benesch, 1, 1954/73, no.8, repr.

Mat: modern only, but two small pieces of paper remain from an old backing.\n\nCOMMENTS: A documentary drawing, as the verso is connected with the painting of Judas Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver, of 1629, now in an English private collection (Fig.c; Bredius-Gerson 539A; Wetering 23). For a further discussion of its place in the genesis of the painting, see under Benesch 0008.\n\nThe extraordinarily thin pen lines found, for example, in the curtain, are characteristic of Rembrandt’s Leiden-period drawings (see for example, Benesch 10 and the drawings there compared with it).\n\nThe recto, in red chalk, is usually dated to the same period (and related to) Rembrandt’s painting of Samson and Delilah of 1628-30 (see Fig.a; Bredius 489, Wetering 37). While this may be the case, the relationship is not close and from the style it is tempting to date the study of legs somewhat later, as the handling is comparable to several drawings that Rembrandt made in this medium as late as c.1635-37 (e.g. Benesch 0017, Benesch 0137 and Benesch 0142A – the shading and configuration of feet and toes are especially close to Benesch 0137). In addition, the relationship between the recto and the Samson and Delilah is also arguably less close than with the central figure in the Rape of Europa of 1632, whose nearer foot and toes are almost identical (see Fig.b; Bredius 464; Wetering 50). So a tentative redating of the recto (Benesch’s verso) to c.1632-35 is suggested here. The notion that the drawing shows the exposed leg – and is a study for – the High Priest in the Judas painting should be viewed with circumspection: his leg was never likely to have been exposed in this way (Rembrandt did not follow the Renaissance practice of making nude studies before draping his figures) and seems more female than male, as past writers have generally assumed.[1]\n\nUnlike Benesch, writers now generally refer to the Study of legs as the recto.\n\nCondition: some dirt and on the recto some stains from an older mount\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt*\n\nDate: verso: 1628-29; recto c.1632-35?\n\nCOLLECTION: NL Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum, Rijksprentenkabinet (inv.RP-T-1930-54; the stamp L.2228 has been removed from the recto).\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Exh.

Watermark: fragment of the Arms of Württemberg.\n\nCOMMENTS: Very probably and in my opinion by Rembrandt, although the stylistic connection with any documentary sheets is weak. If by him, then the much doubted painting of the Tribute Money in Ottawa, National Gallery of Canada (Bredius 536; Corpus C7), signed and dated 1629, in which a comparable figure appears, in reverse, is probably also by him, as I believe (though, it must be said, highly controversially).[1] Again in reverse, the figure also resembles the one to the left of centre in Benesch 8 (qv).\n\nThe style of the drawing relates it to a distinct group of pen sketches, often of vagrants, that exhibit the influence of Jacques Callot, also in iconography (see, for example, Benesch 14, 22, 23a and 24-28). The same applies to certain etchings that Rembrandt made in the Leiden period, from around 1628-31. For instance, the hatching in the shadows on the ground here resembles that in the etched Standing beggar of c.1628-30 (Bartsch 162).[2]\n\nThe variety of touch here, from the heavier outlines in shadow to the left, to the hair’s-breadth delicacy of the delineation of the figure’s back (cf. the lines in the curtain in Benesch 9 verso), reveal an exceptional skill and care in the rendering of light, a hallmark of Rembrandt. Thus despite their somewhat distinct qualities, the traditional attribution of the drawings in the group to Rembrandt himself remains highly plausible.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt.\n\nDate: c.1628-29.\n\nCOLLECTION: D Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett (Inv.

Kassel-Amsterdam, 2001-2002, no.341, where, more-or-less following Corpus C7, it is suggested that the painting is by a pupil and was completed only in c.1631. The main obsacle to accepting the picture as from 1629, as the signature and date ascertain, is the dendrochronological examination of the panel, which has produced a felling date of ‘1630 at the earliest’. But such scientific analyses have sometimes been demonstrated to be faulty in the past. I am grateful to Dr Christopher Etheridge, Associate Curator at the National Gallery of Canada for providing the photograph (December 2016), taken after the painting was cleaned at the Gallery by Stephen Gritt. Together they are planning to write about the painting, concerning which, as Dr Etheridge kindly informs me, the attribution to Rembrandt has never been doubted at the Gallery. The dendrochronological evidence is apparently less of an obstacle than was once thought.\n\n[2] See Berlin, 2006.\n\nFirst posted 4 June 2012.\n\nBenesch 0011\n\nSubject: The Supper at Emmaus\n\nMedium: Pen and brown ink, over traces of black chalk; ruled framing-lines in pen and brown ink.

The style, especially in the Christ, resembles works by Flinck (not least the halo – cf. Benesch 70 in particular), but as a copy it is hard to know whether it might be by Flinck himself, or a copy or variation, perhaps by or after Flinck. At all events unlikely to be by Rembrandt himself, Bode (1906), who owned the drawing, saw a connection with Rembrandt’s painting of the subject in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris of c.1628-29 (Bredius 539, Corpus A16) and the design was indeed probably inspired by the picture.\n\nCondition: somewhat uneven at the edges; some minor stains near top left corner.\n\nSummary attribution: Anonymous (by or after Govert Flinck?).\n\nDate: 1636?\n\nCOLLECTION: USA Cambridge Fogg Art Museum (inv.1968.18).\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Bode, 1906, p.98 (first idea, in reverse, for painting in Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris [Bredius 539, Corpus A16]); HdG 189; Stechow, 1934, pp.334-35, repr. fig.2; Valentiner 525; Benesch, 1935, p.15; Van Regteren Altena, 1948-49, p.7, repr. fig.3; Rotermund, 1952, p.103, repr. pl.19d; Benesch, 1, 1954/73, no.11, repr.

Three comparable black chalk studies of single figures in the Rijksmuseum (Benesch 0030-32) have similar, Italian watermarks (and Benesch 0045-46 and Benesch 0196 appear to be on the same type of paper) and it seems likely that they were made from life at the same period, focusing on the concentration of light and shadow rather than other details, such as the drapery – the contrast with Benesch 0007, for example, is clear in this respect. It has been suggested that the drawing was not made specifically for the print but was later employed for it – there are some adjustments, although the feet are not fully realised in either. But the low viewpoint in both works rather militates against this idea. The figure in his etched form may have been referred to for the bearded man behind Christ in Rembrandt’s painting of the Raising of Lazarus of c.1630-31, now in Los Angeles (Bredius 538, Corpus A30).\n\nCondition: Generally good but discoloured, especially in the upper left section.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt*\n\nDate: 1629?\n\nCOLLECTION: D Dresden, Kupferstich-Kabinett (Inv.C 1971-26; stamped L.1647).\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Heucher, 1738, p.116 (Bureau xv); Dresden (Woermann), 1886-98, vol.viii, p.89, no.287, repr. pl.I; Lippmann, II, 50; Graul, 1906, no.4; HdG 233; Hind, 1912/23, under no.5, repr. pl.1 (connected with etching, Bartsch 95); Neumann, 1918, no.3; Freise, Lilienfeld and Wichmann, 1925, p.14, no.39; Bauch, 1933, p.192, repr. fig.41; Valentiner 530; Benesch, 1935, p.9; Benesch, 1947, no.11, repr.; Benesch, 1, 1954/73, no.12 (c.1629; compares especially Benesch 31-34); Benesch, 1960, no.3, repr.; Scheidig, 1962,, p.34 and 73, no.4, repr. pl.4; Haak, 1974, no.3; Amsterdam, 1985, under nos.2-4, n.5; Schatborn, 1993, p.161 (probably drawn from life; the low viewpoint influenced the appearance of the related etching); Exh.

No watermark. Chain lines 24h. Mat: modern only.\n\nCOMMENTS: A documentary drawing, because of its connection with the etching of the subject by Rembrandt of 1641 (Bartsch 98). This is closer than the composition etched after Rembrandt by Van Vliet in 1631 on the basis of a design of c.1629 (Bartsch/Hollstein 12), mentioned by Benesch and others.[1] The blackening of the back of the sheet, usually undertaken to help transfer the design of a print, reveals that, rather than being derived from Rembrandt, the drawing played a part in his working process. However, perhaps because the details remained in such a cursory state, the outlines were apparently not indented for transfer, whether to the copper plate for the etching or to another surface, such as a sheet of paper (the latter practice has not yet been documented in Rembrandt’s work). One might speculate that it was after the completion of this drawing that Rembrandt decided to move the horseman to one side of the composition to improve the balance of the design.\n\nThe drawing is extraordinarily free and vigorous, matching the more liquid handling Rembrandt also employed in his pen drawings during the 1640s rather than the chalk drawings of the Leiden years (cf., for example, Benesch 0003-7, Benesch 0015, Benesch 0017-21, Benesch 0030-34 and Benesch 0043-45). On the basis of its style we also have to accept as by Rembrandt the drawing in Munich of Isaac blessing Jacob, which is not in Benesch (see under the Not in Benesch tab). Also illustrated there is a 1641 signed and dated drawing of the subject, which may represent a first idea for the same composition. Indeed, it seems that the abraded lines above the wheeled carriage to the right in Benesch 0013 may have represented the elephant and rider shown there.\n\nThe subject became popular in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century and was treated by Rembrandt’s teacher, Pieter Lastman, four times, as well as by Jacob Pijnas and others before Rembrandt first tackled it in his painting of 1626 (See note 1), and again in the lost version of around c.1629 mentioned above, in the present drawing and in the related etching. It has been suggested that the subject’s popularity resulted from the Protestant recognition of only two of the traditional Roman Catholic Seven Sacraments, Baptism and Communion.[2]\n\nCondition: Somewhat rubbed; the whites partly oxidised; paper cockled; minor nicks and repairs; old creases.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt*\n\nDate: c.1641.\n\nCOLLECTION: D Munich, Staatliche Graphische Sammlung (Inv.1453; stamped with L.2673 and L.2723).\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Saxl, 1908, p.536; Benesch, 1925, pp.26-27, repr.; Kauffmann, 1926, p.244; Valentiner, 1934, p.404; Benesch, 1935, p.9; Benesch, 1947, no.13, repr.; Valentiner, 1951, p.347, n.7 (an 18th-century imitation); Van Gelder, 1953, p.17; Benesch, 1, 1954/73, no.13, repr.

Inscribed in pen and brown ink, upper right: ’29’.\n\n106 x 54 (top corners rounded).\n\nCOMMENTS: The analogies required to substantiate the attribution of the present drawing are chiefly with Rembrandt’s etchings of vagrants and with the figure of Joseph in two early etchings of the Flight into Egypt (Bartsch 52 and 54). The odd configuration of the trousers, which contain some idiosyncratic motor movements of Rembrandt’s hand, is quite typical – cf. Benesch 0036, for example. Yet that comparison is unflattering to the present sheet, in which the penmanship is unusually liquid for a drawing of the Leiden period; and despite the delicacy of many details, there are some other concerns: for example, where exactly is the nearer arm? The balance of the wash and outlines is also unsatisfactory, with a stronger forward outline to the advancing leg which is lit than to the shadowed back of the receding one – the reverse of Rembrandt’s usual custom. Overall, there is a slightly decorative quality, a lack of Rembrandt’s habitual sense of structure and authority, which is troubling. Extremely tall, soft hats like this in Rembrandt tend to kink, or be less wide at the top.\n\nOn balance, however, this liquidly handled drawing seems to be by Rembrandt. The more delicate lines and the forthright characterisation are among its more persuasive characteristics, even if the style is difficult to relate directly to Rembrandt’s documentary drawings in pen and ink of the Leiden period, such as Benesch 0008 or Benesch 0009 verso. But the lack of such a connection is not all that unusual (see further the Introduction under the ‘About’ tab).\n\nThe inspiration, as has often been said of Rembrandt’s early depictions of vagrants, is derived from etchings by Jacques Callot. But already in this early work, Rembrandt depicts them with less derision.[1]\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt.\n\nDate: 1629?\n\nCOLLECTION: F Paris Louvre (inv.

Inscribed lower right in pen and brown ink (number of Crozat inventory written by P.-J. Mariette): “276”; further insignificant graphite inscriptions and numbers on the mat.\n\n236 x 202.

In the print, which is in reverse, the saint’s emblem, the sword, is omitted while the pen he holds (in what becomes his right hand) is clarified, as are also the books by his elbow and other details. In the drawing, the sense of light entering from the left and reflected from the surface of the open volume is almost palpable. However, as Benesch pointed out, the drawing was less obviously done from life, unlike Rembrandt’s many other red chalk drawings of elderly figures made during the Leiden period (such as Benesch 20 and 37-42). Compare also Benesch 0089-90 for the same combination of red chalk and grey wash, in a not dissimilar style. At a tangent are the comparable depictions of the saint in Rembrandt’s paintings in Melbourne of c.1628 (Bredius 423; Wetering 27) and Nuremberg of 1629 (Bredius 602; Wetering 28).\n\nCondition: Generally good. Some staining upper left; a spot of glue (?) by the spine of the book; a vertical fold to the right; some abrasions in the grey wash, especially below the saint’s nearer hand (and perhaps partly intentional, to add illumination in this area).\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt*\n\nDate: 1628?\n\nCOLLECTION: F Paris Louvre (inv.22985; Lugt 1145; stamped with L.1886 and on verso with numéro d’ordre stamp, not in Lugt)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Michel, 1893, repr. opp. p.40; Seidlitz, 1894, p.120; Dessins du Musée du Louvre, Alinari, 7e série, École Hollandaise, pl.329; Lippmann, I, no.158; HdG 613 (identifies as a study for the etching, c.1629); Bruel, 1908, p.462; Saxl, 1908, pp.237-38; Kleinmann, V, no.30; Weisbach, 1926, repr. fig.13; Van Dyke, 1927, p.106 (Lievens); Valentiner 550; Fierens, 1929, repr. pl.1; Van Rijckevorsel, 1932, pp.73-74; Bauch, 1933, pp.101-2 and 197-98, repr. fig.89; Paris, 1933, no.1145 (c.1627; related to painting of St Paul in Stuttgart, Bredius 601, Corpus A11); Benesch, 1935, p.10; Exh.

The stringy lines, which combine to give an impression of a figure made of straw, while characteristic of Lievens (cf. the drawing in the British Museum, 1836,0811.341),[1] are wholly distinct from the style of Rembrandt, whose grasp of form is considerably firmer (eg. Benesch 0042, which most commentators now assign to Lievens, wrongly in my view, as well as the drawings already mentioned). Only in Benesch 0039 does Rembrandt toy with a comparable manner in the beard and nearer shoulder, but even there the underlying structure is more secure.\n\nSummary attribution: Jan Lievens.\n\nDate: c.1630?\n\nCOLLECTION: D Darmstadt, Hessisches Landesmuseum.\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Freund, 1917 etc., repr. pl.212 (Rembrandt, Van Vliet or Lievens); Freund, 1930, pl.212 (reworked in darker chalk); Bauch 1933, p.228 (J. des Rousseaux); Benesch, 1935, p.10 (Rembrandt, c.1630); Benesch, 1, 1954/73, no.16, repr.

Chain lines: 22/24v. Watermark: the backing has a watermark with the arms of Amsterdam; there may be a watermark on the original sheet, but it is indecipherable through the backing.\n\nCOMMENTS: Clearly by Rembrandt, the only surprise being that the date on the drawing, 1630, must refer to the date of Lievens’ composition of the “Raising of Lazarus” (see below). In style the drawing is characteristic of Rembrandt in c.1635 and its authenticity has rarely been doubted, but its genesis is somewhat complex: it began as a rough sketch of the ‘Raising of Lazarus’, with Lazarus seen at the lower right in two or more positions, raising his head, and with Christ standing above the tomb and a crowd of spectators to the left. It was subsequently reworked as an ‘Entombment of Christ’,[1] in which the body of Christ is lowered towards the tomb; some of the earlier figures, including the standing Christ, were adjusted, erased or cancelled out in red chalk or else covered with white bodycolour, which has since become more transparent.\n\nIt has generally been thought that Rembrandt based the underlying composition of the ‘Raising of Lazarus’ on an etching by Jan Lievens (Hollstein 7).[2] There are numerous differences between them: Rembrandt did not silhouette the woman holding the winding-sheet as in the print; the figures behind her are rearranged; between her and the central figures there is a head, partly obscured by the white bodycolour, that does not appear in the print; the interior rather than the roof of the arch is shaded; and there are many other alterations. The etching reproduces, in reverse, Lievens’ painting of this subject now in Brighton, which is dated 1631 and which Rembrandt may have owned.[3] Some of these differences reveal that Rembrandt in fact based himself on another print after the painting made by Jacob Louijs, which was published by Pieter Soutman, probably in Haarlem, where they were both active from 1628 (Hollstein 1). This engraving, which is most unlikely to have been made before the completion in 1631 of the painting by Lievens it reproduces, exhibits the ‘reversed’ shading in the vault. It also includes a section of rock on the left that juts out into the space occupied by the arch, a motif seen in the drawing, but not in Lievens’ etching; and the same applies to other features: for example, the diagonal shading on the wall above Lazarus’s head follows Louijs’ print, and the reserve of white across the lower edge reflects the space occupied by the inscription in Louijs’ engraving. Yet the placing of Rembrandt’s date follows that of Lievens’ signature, suggesting that he probably had Lievens’ print, as well as Louijs’ engraving, before him as he worked.[4] The details of the ‘Lazarus’ composition in the drawing are difficult to decipher without knowledge of the prints; equally it is hard to see how Lievens could have created his figures, whether in paint or on copper, on the basis of Rembrandt’s cursory indications in the drawing, including the wall of shaded rock that descends in a curve to Christ’s feet, as has also sometimes been suggested.\n\nNeither Lievens’ etching nor Louijs’ engraving are likely to have been made before the completion of the painting, yet the drawing is in the same direction as the prints and in reverse to the painting. This would probably not have been the case had the drawing predated the prints. In sum, the drawing seems clearly to have been primarily based on Louijs’ print, a discovery that wholly undermines the traditional view that Rembrandt’s drawing, ostensibly dated 1630, inspired Lievens’ painting of 1631.[5] To bolster this theory, it has recently come to light that Louijs’ print was already published in its first state by Pieter Soutman with his privilege, a privilege that he was first granted in 1636.[6] Thus the drawing may have been made in that year and is very unlikely to have been made much earlier.\n\nRembrandt’s subsequent reworking of the sheet into an ‘Entombment of Christ’, although in a more searching style, was probably not executed substantially later, as has sometimes been thought. The handling differs only marginally and the colour of the chalk remains the same. The discovery that Louijs’ print was Rembrandt’s starting-point also negates the traditional notion that the drawing served as a preparatory study for Rembrandt’s painting of the ‘Raising of Lazarus’ of c.1630-31 (Los Angeles, County Museum of Art, Bredius 538, Corpus A30). The theory is further weakened by the major differences between the two works, which are based on different parts of the text of St John.[7] Rembrandt returned to the Lazarus subject in an etching of c.1632 (Bartsch 73, Hind 96; see cat. no.6a; 1848,0911.35) which again has only a few isolated elements of the drawing’s design in common, as does his much later etching of 1642 (Bartsch 72, Hind 198).[8]\n\nWith these traditional connections with works of around 1630-32 severed, it becomes possible to redate the drawing on purely stylistic grounds. Because of the connection with Louijs’ print it cannot be from 1630, despite Rembrandt’s annotation. The inscription seems to be autograph, but must refer not to the time of the drawing’s execution but to the period of the composition’s invention by Lievens for his painting completed in 1631.[9] Stylistically the drawing has much in common with Rembrandt’s red chalk studies of around 1635, in particular with the British Museum’s sketch based on Leonardo’s ‘Last Supper’ (Benesch 444; inv.1900,0611.7). The latter, which is drawn in chalk of the same hue, includes a few heads that are described in a similar geometrical shorthand. In addition, the group of figures at the upper left of the ‘Lazarus’, with a man leaning on a parapet, seems to reflect Rembrandt’s study of Leonardo’s composition.[10] Stylistic analogies are also present in the chalk sections of a drawing in the Rijksmuseum of c.1635-6 (Benesch 152), which is related to Rembrandt’s painting of the ‘Entombment’, now in Munich (Bredius 560, Corpus A126).[11] Such comparisons are closer than with Rembrandt’s compositional drawings in chalk of the Leiden period, in which the figures and style are significantly different.[12] In this context it is worth remarking that Benesch believed that the drawing showed Rembrandt breaking free of the influence of Lastman, Pijnas and Callot.\n\nIn 2009 the compiler was able to study in a private collection another related painting of the ‘Raising of Lazarus’, largely in the style of Lievens. Perhaps based on Louijs’s print, the picture however incorporates the group of figures on the right from Rembrandt’s etching (Bartsch 73, Hind 96). Scientific investigation by X-radiography and infra-red reflectography reveals various pentimenti in the canvas, including changes that are similar to some of those in the present drawing: the variant positions for the head of Lazarus and the adjustment to the line of the balustrade from a straight horizontal line to a curve being the clearest. Most of the painting, which survives only in rubbed condition and in a mutilated form, having been severely cut down to a circle from a rectangle, appears Lievensesque in style, although the passage incorporating the figures from Rembrandt’s etching appears more Rembrandtesque. Perhaps the most convincing hypothesis is that both the drawing and this painting were made or completed in the context of revisiting the composition in c.1635, in the case of the former by Rembrandt, and of the latter by a pupil of Lievens or conceivably of Rembrandt.[13]\n\nRedating the drawing to c.1635 not only brings it closer in time to the Munich painting, for which it could have been a preliminary idea, but also to the four etched ‘Oriental Heads’, again based on Lievens, that Rembrandt produced at this time (Bartsch 286-9).[14] Four other drawn copies based on Pieter Lastman were also made by Rembrandt in the mid-1630s and are likewise in chalk (Benesch 446-9, the two former in black, the latter in red chalk). Furthermore, although the subject of the ‘Entombment’ was not etched by Rembrandt until much later (‘Christ carried to the Tomb’, c.1645, Bartsch 84, Hind 215; the ‘Entombment’, c.1654, Bartsch 86, Hind 281), Rembrandt produced a second version in oil during the mid- or late-1630s, the sketch at Glasgow (Bredius 554, Corpus A105 as datable 1633-35; Exh. Glasgow, 2012 suggests a later date, perhaps with subsequent reworking). The two paintings have few details that are directly related to the drawing (the Munich picture is the nearest), yet they could have been made at approximately the same date, when the artist was wrestling with this subject.\n\nA similar retrospective dating to the one added by Rembrandt here appears to have taken place with Benesch 0082 and when Rembrandt completed in chalk two proofs of his etched ‘Self-Portrait in a soft Hat’, and has caused equal confusion (see British Museum, inv.1842,0806.134; Benesch 0057; London, 2010 (online), no.7a, repr.).\n\nCondition: Generally good; perhaps a little trimmed; a stain (oil?) towards lower left; some foxing towards upper right.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt.\n\nDate: 1635-36?\n\nCOLLECTION: GB London, British Museum (inv.T,14.6; formerly FAWK 5213.6)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/remarks (always as Rembrandt, 1630 unless otherwise stated; Rembrandt’s painting = Bredius 538, Corpus A30, ‘Lazarus’ or Bredius 560, Corpus A126, ‘Entombment’; etching = Bartsch 73): Bürger, 1858, p.399 (‘Entombment’ only); Vosmaer, 1877, pp.89 and 487; Bode, 1881, p.66 (with colour repr.; ‘Entombment’, but related to Rembrandt’s ‘Lazarus’ etching); Bode, 1883, p.390 (as Bode, 1881); Dutuit, IV, 1885, p.85 (‘Entombment of Lazarus’); Michel, 1893, II, p.581 (as Dutuit, 1885); Seidlitz, 1895/1992, p.63/125, under no.73; Hofstede de Groot, 1896, p.380 (a ‘Raising of Lazarus’, preceding Rembrandt’s painting and related to Lievens, and an ‘Entombment’); Exh.

(L.2183; possibly his sale, Cock, 8th night, 30 January, 1747, lot 67: ‘One, “Rembrandt”, Christ carrying to the Sepulchre’, £11-5-0); either given by John Christmas, 1761 or bequeathed by William Fawkener, 1769. In the British Museum Trustees’ Committee papers of 9 Oct. 1761, it is recorded that Mr John Christmas presented ‘a fine drawing of the ‘Raising of Lazarus’ after the manner of Rembrandt’. This was the first drawing ever presented to the British Museum after its foundation (i.e. since the original bequest of Hans Sloane in 1753), and could possibly be the present sheet – it may have been placed in Fawkener’s albums after their arrival in 1769 (see Griffiths, 1994, pp.531-32).\n\n[1] As first recognised by Hofstede de Groot, 1896, p. 380. The text of the present entry summarises Royalton-Kisch, 1991[I] and 1992[I].\n\n[2] As first argued by Saxl, 1923-4, pp.146-7. Impressions are in the British Museum and viewable online (inv. nos.D,8-69 [1st state], S.29 and D,8.70 [3rd state]).\n\n[3] 1656 inventory of Rembrandt’s possessions includes ‘Een opweckinge Laseri van Jan Lievensz’ (Strauss and van der Meulen, 1979, p.353, no.42). The painting is repr. in Sumowski, ‘Gemälde’, III, 1983, no.1193, and Exh. Washington-Milwaukee-Amsterdam, 2008-9, no.31.\n\n[4] As first noticed by Schatborn (see Exh. Amsterdam, 1988-9, pp.44-5, no.18); in Exh. Braunschweig, 1979, under no.102, the Lievens etching is said to have been done after the painting.\n\n[5] A summary of views appears below. The print was illustrated in Exh. Los Angeles, 1991-2, p.19, fig.12, and the author, Richard Rand, was the first to note the connection with Louijs’ print.\n\n[6] Jaco Rutgers, researching Pieter Soutman for the New Hollstein volume devoted to Rubens, noted that Soutman first obtained the privilege in 1636 (he kindly e-mailed the compiler with this information, 12 January 2017).\n\n[7] Guratzsch, 1980 (see Lit. below) contrasts Lievens’ invention, based on John, XI, 41, with Rembrandt’s painting inspired by John, XI, 43. For the iconography, see also Harvey, 1980.\n\n[8] The drawing of the ‘Raising of Lazarus’ in Rotterdam, Benesch 518 recto, has been rejected by Giltaij (see Rotterdam, 1988, no.155), rightly in my view. He quotes the earlier doubts expressed by Sumowski, 1958, p.179 and Guratzsch, 1975, p.253, n.15.\n\n[9] Corpus, I, 1982, under no.A30, suggest that the date may have been added to the drawing later, in error. The ingenious sequence proposed by Schatborn (e.g. in 1988-9, see n.4 above) that Lievens’ etching was proofed in 1630 before the painting was finished and dated in 1631 runs counter to the evidence adduced here.\n\n[10] The figure mentioned resembles the third from the left in Rembrandt’s study after Leonardo in Berlin (Benesch 445) more than his prototype in Louijs’ engraving.\n\n[11] Amsterdam, 1985, no.7.\n\n[12] E.g. the double-sided drawing in Rotterdam for the ‘Raising of the Cross’ and the ‘Judas returning the Silver’ (Benesch 6) of c.1628-9; other chalk drawings of this period are the ‘Study of Legs’ in the Rijksmuseum (Benesch 9 verso); the ‘Studies of seated old Men’ in a private collection, in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, the Teylers Museum, Haarlem, and the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin (Benesch 20, 37, 40 and 41), and the ‘St Paul’ and the ‘Kneeling Man’ both in the Louvre (Benesch 15 and 18).\n\n[13] The painting is privately owned and I am grateful to the owners for allowing me access to it. Originally rectangular, it as been cut down to a tondo with a diameter of 172 cm. A photograph is in the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie in The Hague. The painting’s condition makes its status difficult to judge.\n\n[14] See Broos in Exh. Amsterdam, 1985-6, pp.22-3, nos.6-7. Hind, 1924, Valentiner, 1934, II, and Münz, 1952 have previously suggested some relationship to the Munich ‘Entombment’ (see Lit. below).\n\nFirst posted 4 June 2012.\n\nBenesch 0018\n\nSubject: Drapery Study for St Jerome in Prayer\n\nVerso: Laid down on Mariette mount\n\nMedium: Red and black chalk on paper prepared with brown wash (the red chalk perhaps moistened occasionally to achieve a darker tone); ruled framing-lines in pen and brown ink. Inscribed lower right, in pen and dark brown ink: ‘8’ and on the mat, recto, in a cartouche by P.J. Mariette in brown ink: ‘REIMBRANDT VAN RHYN / Ex Collectione D. Petri Crozat, nunc P.J. Mariette. 1741.’; inscribed in pen and brown ink on the verso of the mat: ‘Lanasin [?]71 Laranon [?Lanasin] Rembrands 19/8155/13’.\n\n206 x 161. Watermark and chain lines not visible. The paper is smooth and has ‘taken on’ the laid lines from the mat. The mat is Mariette’s, but the blue colour has faded to greyish-green.\n\nCOMMENTS: A documentary drawing as it is a study for a lost painting by Rembrandt of c.1630-31, known through an engraving of 1631, in reverse, by Jan van Vliet (Bartsch 13; there is also an early copy, in reverse, after the print that presumably shows the composition in the same direction as the lost painting). The differences between the two are minor, but the more cursory depiction of the folds and other details in the drawing secures the drawing’s status as a preparatory sketch. To judge from the engravings, the painting was more detailed in the burgeoning tradition of Leiden ‘fijnschilderij’ and the drawing is considerably bolder and more rough-hewn in approach. The technique of red and black chalk combined is not unusual in the early works of Rembrandt, though sometimes combined with white (cf. Benesch 0007, Benesch 0040-42 and Benesch 0056, as well as the Study of an old man in a private collection in The Hague (see under Not in Benesch).[1]\n\nRembrandt’s design is exceptional in depicting St Jerome in lost profile rather than in regular profile or turned, at least partly, towards the spectator.\n\nCondition: rubbed, especially by the knees an top left; the paper discoloured, as if (as the mat also suggests) the drawing has been much exposed to light. Some other blotches of white-ish and green-ish discolouration.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt*\n\nDate: c.1630.\n\nCOLLECTION: F Paris, Musée du Louvre (inv. 22887; stamped with marks of the Commission of the Museum, lower right, L.2207, and of the Conservatoire, lower left, L.1899; identified wrongly as St Francis in the inventory of the Musée Napoleon)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Vosmaer, 1877, pp.87 and 486 (1629; identifies subject and related print); Michel, 1893, pp.51 and 587, repr. pl.43; Seidlitz, 1894, p.120; Dessins du Musée du Louvre, Alinari, 7e série, École Hollandaise, pl.331; Lippmann, I, 152; Kleinmann, V, 41; Hofstede de Groot, 1906, no.615; Saxl, 1908, p.236; Van Dyke, 1927, p. 106 (by Lievens); Fierens, 1929, repr. pl.2; Hell, 1930, p.19; Bauch, 1933, p.213, repr. fig.100; Paris, 1933, no.1146, repr. pl.31 (c.1630); Valentiner 534; Benesch, 1935, p.10; Benesch, 1, 1954/73, no.18, repr.
