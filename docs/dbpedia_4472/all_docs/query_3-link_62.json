The anomaly of capitalism is the [stock] market. Ernest-Antoine Seillière, Le Monde, 30 July 2002\n\nT\n\nhis book is about the interplay of three powerful social constellations, families, states, and markets, in the European context. Recently a great deal of literature has been devoted to demonstrating that there is no simple opposition between state and market; in particular, that a well-functioning market needs a secure institutional framework that can be provided only by well-functioning states. Without a state, there is no way of enforcing contracts, which are at the heart of the market process. Where states become abusive, arbitrary, or corrupt, the scope for rent-seeking increases, and economic agents in the market, instead of looking for technical improvements or innovations as a way of expanding their activities, try to capture the state. The proposition that the state requires the market is perhaps more controversial; but it really should not be so. The extreme example of the malfunctioning of Communist systems demonstrated that when states arbitrarily seek to replace markets, they lose legitimacy by extending themselves into too many areas in which individuals have strong feelings. A great deal of the discussion about the efﬁcient and just operation of markets and states ignores the contribution of the family to 1\n\n2\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\ntheir functioning. This is surprising, because the family can be understood as providing a link across generations, and with this a perspective on time. The process of building institutions and markets fails if there is no long-term outlook. Children are an investment in the future, and societies that do not adequately reproduce themselves have great problems in all areas that demand equity and justice. The family has played and continues to play a decisive role in the form of economic organization characterized by the legal transfer of ownership rights, a type of organization best described by the term “capitalism.” The family molds capitalism. Human beings have a biological urge to pass their assets on to other humans linked to them by spirals of DNA. The DNA chains are the real chains that bind the capitalist economy, not the allegorical chains whose loosing Marx and Engels demanded at the end of the Communist Manifesto. But there is a continual tension at the heart of the relationship between capitalism and the family. The Schumpeterian creative destruction of capitalism always throws up new challenges and changes, making for an instability that tears away at the fabric of the family. The simple fact of the literal familiarity of capitalism perplexes many commentators, and many indeed simply wish to deny it. Conceiving of capitalism as a vast, inhuman process, based alternately on swindle and exploitation, that dwarfs and destroys individuals, they cannot see that it has anything to do with the affection and emotional warmth of family life or any sense of personal responsibility. The linkage between capitalism and the family is clearest in the type of business organization that developed most fully outside the United States and the United Kingdom. Although the following pages present a history set in three rather different national cultures in continental Europe, it would be just as possible to set the story in Japan, China, or India. The major business role played by family ﬁrms in a large number of countries has largely escaped serious comparative historical analysis.1 This omission is surprising given the recent upsurge of interest in two issues related to the operation of markets that are central to the question of family businesses. The ﬁrst issue is the linkage between macroeconomic perfor-\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n3\n\nmance and the microeconomic problems of ﬁrms’ balance sheets and proﬁtability. What sorts of ﬁrms contribute most to long-term economic growth? How do world economic conditions and the varying phases of globalization and deglobalization correspond to developments in enterprise structure and behavior?2 In particular, is there a “relationship capitalism” in continental Europe and Japan that has in the past been sustained by the localization of national capital markets and limits on the international mobility of capital, and is now facing inevitable decline as a consequence of the impact of ﬁnancial globalization?3 Is “relationship capitalism” more suited to some sorts of technology, which require long-term skill development (such as mechanical engineering in Germany or production of luxury goods in Italy), but less suited to branches with very rapid and sudden patterns of innovation (such as biotechnology or information technology)? In practice, “relationship capitalism” in continental Europe has almost always meant family relations. The second issue relates to the way in which different legal traditions molded the development of quite different types of companies. A new orthodoxy asserts that common-law societies have produced more successful ﬁrms than the largely continental European Roman law traditions because owner or shareholder rewards and remuneration are more closely aligned with those of the company. Shareholders are more powerful and inﬂuential because they can litigate more easily. The long-term consequence is that there is more information about company behavior and results available in the public domain. It is therefore possible for owners to make more informed and thus more rational or better decisions on the allocation of capital. Most of this discussion has focused on the consequences of different degrees of shareholder protection for investment strategy. But the issue of common-law versus continental codiﬁed ﬁrm is also central to the particular issue of governance in family-owned and -controlled companies.4 There are two obvious ways in which this kind of legislative intervention limits the scope of family ﬁrms, if the major vehicle of family enterprise is a joint-stock corporation (as is frequently but not necessarily the case). First, it is obviously harder for families to use biased or weighted voting in order to maintain control as they dilute capital. Second, investor protection makes the stock market more efﬁcient and thus attractive to many members of big families\n\n4\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nwho do not necessarily want to keep their money in a traditional ﬁrm rather than allocating risk more widely. Most European legal systems were happy with unequal voting until the 1990s, when large (and in many cases foreign) institutional investors exerted strong pressure for change. In a recent survey of European companies, only seventeen of forty-three adhered to a simple one-share onevote principle. Over a third allowed multiple voting rights.5 The big families that dominate Swedish capitalism rely on this way of maintaining control. But this type of explanation holds only for quite recent events and not for a broad or long historical development. Legislation restricting multiple voting is relatively recent, dating to the 1930s in the United States, and to the 1980s in the United Kingdom. Family ﬁrms in those countries had largely lost control before then. Continental Europe may be moving to a similar type of regulation, at the initiative of big (and in many cases foreign) institutional investors, especially mutual funds. Germany introduced a reform that eliminated some kinds of multiple votes in 2001. France had imposed this control in the 1930s, but it was subsequently dismantled, and the country is resistant to restoring it today. Indeed the recent Hellebuyck commission on corporate governance in France endorsed double voting rights as a way to reward the loyalty of “certain shareholders.” An obvious objection to the literature on common-law superiority is that if family ﬁrms with nontransparent ownership and control mechanisms are such an inefﬁcient way of managing the allocation of capital, they should not exist in such numbers. But in fact more than three-quarters of registered companies in the industrialized world are family businesses, and—especially in continental Europe—they include some very large companies. Historians of the subject are often surprised by the extent to which this business phenomenon has survived.6 According to one recent calculation, 17 of the largest 100 companies in Germany are in family hands, 26 in France, and 43 in Italy.7 France and Italy still consider themselves to be the “champions of family capitalism.”8 In France at the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century 33.8 percent of the total market value of listed corporate assets was controlled by just ﬁfteen families (and 22.0 percent by ﬁve families). For Italy the equivalent ﬁgures are 21.9 percent and 16.8 percent, and for Germany 25.0 percent\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n5\n\nand 15.7 percent. By contrast, in the United Kingdom the equivalent ﬁgures are 6.6 and 4.1 percent.9 This is not to say that there are no long-lived family ﬁrms in the United States and Canada—the often eccentric du Ponts and the highly secretive Cargills are obvious examples. But many of the most outstanding North American family dynasties are relatively recent. Family capitalism in the United States is exceptionally vibrant, but it usually involves ﬁrstor second-generation startups. Such crossnational comparisons raise obvious questions of deﬁnition: Could it be argued, for instance, that the Ford Motor Company is still a family ﬁrm because its chief executive is the greatgrandson of Henry Ford? By the 1960s less than 10 percent of the capital was in family hands, although the family-owned stock had greater voting power. Even the same levels of ownership mean different outcomes in different settings: Andrea Colli, for instance, points out that while it is impossible to dominate a company with 5 percent stock ownership in the United States, the same level of ownership may be enough to ensure effective control in Italy.10 The controversy about whether family ﬁrms promote or retard general economic performance centers upon a qualitative evaluation of the implications of statistics on how common family ﬁrms are. In Asian capitalism, the special trust that exists among members of often very extended families is often interpreted as a source of greater resilience.11 In a similar vein, the mid-nineteenth-century conservative French social theorist Frédéric Le Play argued that industrial success was a reﬂection of the spirit of the family. The beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century saw renewed emphasis on the positive sides of family business, especially in debates outside the United States and the United Kingdom. Family ownership has the advantage of being visible and identiﬁable, in contrast to the anonymous capitalism of large numbers of individual investors or the facelessness of institutional investors. If ownership is an important or even the deﬁning feature of the capitalist process, transparency may be desirable. The greater difﬁculties that arise when disposing of ownership offer a guarantee of continuity and make property part of a stakeholding and relatively permanent pattern of institutional arrangements, in which there are higher levels of commitment. In such a setting it may be easier to motivate managers and workers than in one ruled by uncertainty\n\n6\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nabout whether tomorrow the (faceless) owners will walk away. Families in business recently responded to this sort of analysis by developing a concept of “professional ownership,” an obligation of owners to inform themselves in depth about the ﬁnancial and business position of the companies they own, so that they can exercise more effective control. The family and its long-term vision thus offer a striking and reassuring alternative to the emphasis on “shareholder value” that was so fashionable in the 1990s and was linked with the “Americanization” of business conduct. With the collapse of ideas about a “New Economy,” the end of the dot.com bubble, and revelations of corporate corruption and scandal, businesses looked for a new model of responsible conduct. Family interests reasserted themselves in continental Europe, especially against managers and executives who seemed to have become too Americanized. The Mohn family ousted the leading manager of Bertelsmann, Thomas Middelhoff, who had wanted to turn a family company into an internationalized or even a denationalized enterprise. In France Jean-Marie Messier was similarly deposed from Vivendi Universal, and the Lagardère dynasty tried to regain control of Vivendi. Unlike Messier, the Lagardères were seen as deeply French; the wife of the president of the republic, the prime minister, and ﬁve cabinet ministers attended the funeral of Jean-Luc Lagardère in 2003. The left-wing newspaper Le Monde published a striking defense of a national form of capitalism: “at a time when the stock exchange keeps on falling, family capitalism, privileging long-term patrimonial interest over short-term operations, seems to have all the virtues.”12 One recent study of U.S. businesses also concluded, on the basis of a broad deﬁnition that counted one-third of the companies in the S&P 500 as family ﬁrms, that they performed signiﬁcantly better than nonfamily ﬁrms.13 But more often family capitalism is still presented as a negative phenomenon that obstructs development and instills corrupt practices. The concept is often used, particularly in the United States, to explain deviation from some notion of an ideal-typical American path, of the kind best described by Alfred Chandler.14 Firms in this tradition should move smoothly from an entrepreneurial to a managerial type of organization, with the movement to the multidivisional ﬁrm being taken as the key indicator that such a transition to business modernity has been achieved. The dominance of\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n7\n\nfamily business has historically been used, notably by David Landes, to explain poor French economic performance until the second half of the twentieth century, when the deﬁciencies of such organizations were overcome by a transition to planning in which technically trained business elites replaced dynastic control.15 The economist Charles Kindleberger echoed this view in asserting that the French family ﬁrm “sinned against economic efﬁciency.”16 The ﬁnancial limitations that keep family ﬁrms small are also generally held to explain why Italian modernization remained incomplete and polarized between a large and until recently state-dominated industry and myriad small producers.17 The idea of the family ﬁrm is thus at the heart of a debate over the costs of the divergence of a continental European model of capitalism from the “Anglo-Saxon” one. According to this view, path dependence locked continental economies on a suboptimal institutional track.18 This model is also used to explain failure in other countries. A perhaps idiosyncratic interpretation of the business experience reﬂects the common criticism, particularly intense in the interwar period, of the limited investment horizons of British ﬁrms. Alfred Chandler in Scale and Scope portrays late twentieth-century Britain as being still in thrall to “personal capitalism,” in which family relations still play a big part. The term refers to a style of management, and not exclusively to the actual structure of ownership. William Lazonick uses a similar diagnosis for the ills of British capitalism.19 One variant of the gloomy depiction of family business holds that such ﬁrms may play a useful role in resolving the problems of trust that arise in small-scale local economies, but that large family ﬁrms still impose a heavy price in terms of efﬁciency.20 The penalty of family ownership is thus far heavier for larger enterprises. Such an interpretation lies outside Chandler’s portrayal of family ﬁrms as a childlike stage on the path to the mature managerial enterprise. It allows interpretations in which economies thrive on the interplay of a dualism between a small family-based sector and large modern enterprise. On the other hand, it is hard to claim that German or Japanese business life was sluggish in the century after 1870, although family ﬁrms there dominated large as well as smaller-scale business. Nor were family ﬁrms particularly undynamic. Jeffrey Fear has recently used the impressive development of August Thyssen’s ﬁrm in the\n\n8\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nlate nineteenth century to challenge the Chandlerian tradition, and to show how innovative and responsive personal capitalism could be.21 In the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century U.S. “Gilded Age,” owner-dominated ﬁrms like Singer and Carnegie Steel were often more bent on growth than managerial enterprises, including the large company formed by a merger in 1901 that absorbed Carnegie Steel, namely U.S. Steel.22 Perhaps surprisingly, it is not economists or economic historians but rather anthropologists, notably Jack Goody, who have mounted a sustained challenge to the simple idea that family capitalism is inevitably replaced by a modern rational individualistic managerial capitalism. Goody concludes: The aspect of the managerial approach that sees the evolutionary replacement of the family ﬁrm by impersonal forms of economic organisation has little empirical justiﬁcation and neglects the continuing role of the family not only in smaller enterprises but also in many larger ones. Firstly it gives insufﬁcient weight to the growth of new businesses that are bound to be centred on the family . . . Secondly, even where control may be transmitted in a bureaucratic way, the property people possess at death normally passes to family members, whether this consists of jewellery, a house or shares.\n\nIn short, across the world, from Ahmadabad to Toulouse to Bradford, “the structure of the enterprise tended to duplicate the structure of the family.”23 In general, the changing role of the family in the classic story of industrialization is impossible to separate from the organizational development of enterprises. The evolution of a strong sense of family was a crucial part of the creation of the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie.24 The information gains achieved over time by expanding networks of relationships provided a social capital that complemented ﬁnancial capital, contributing to efﬁciency by reducing transaction costs.25 The idea and structures of family capitalism revive in a particularly startling way at moments when the idea and the capacity of the state to act as a provider of economic growth and opportunity falter. Continental European history is especially rich in such moments of crises of “state capitalism,” and this, I suggest, is the most funda-\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n9\n\nmental reason for the striking success and dynamism in Europe of the family model. The transition to a third “industrial revolution” at the end of the twentieth century has produced another big and perhaps ﬁnal challenge to state-based concepts of development. The last quarter of the twentieth century brought a widespread questioning of the state-centered model of economic development, and thus might well be expected to produce new opportunities for entrepreneurship, including entrepreneurship in the family setting. Any discussion of the family ﬁrm has to consider a number of important distinctions among enterprises that are often simply labeled as “family.” There are quite different instruments and degrees of inﬂuence available to family-owners. 1. Is the family ﬁrm a publicly quoted joint-stock company, with a family exercising control, in some cases with special voting shares, in some cases through pyramided holding structures? Or is it a nonquoted company? Many ﬁrms combine both, with an unlisted family holding company controlling substantial shares in public companies. 2. Is the management dominated by executives from the controlling family or not? Almost every study of family businesses makes the point that a preponderance of family directors over outside directors leads to suboptimal behavior by the family.26 Some commentators follow Alfred Chandler in holding that when family members are not directly engaged in full-time management, the ﬁrm should no longer be described as a family company but rather as a managerial ﬁrm. Others see this as some sort of intermediate form. Such distinctions are made difﬁcult by differences in national company laws: for instance, German law provides for a supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) that is not directly involved in management, and on which family members may well be represented (as well as the German but not the foreign employees of the company). Some supervisory boards are quite interventionist, and they are required to be so at moments of managerial failure. 3. Is the company recent or long-established? A long-term vision can be articulated most clearly in companies that span many generations of ownership, while short-term interests, divergent family interests, and struggles among individual members often lead to the breakup of ﬁrms in the second or third generation. Old companies do not have to be spectacularly successful compa-\n\n10\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nnies. Indeed a recent study found that the overwhelming majority of the 18 U.S. companies from the ﬁrst Forbes listing of the largest 100 American corporations in 1917 that survived to 1987 underperformed the market as a whole, and that the group’s average returns were 20 percent below the compound growth rate of the market as a whole.27 Long life thus does not necessarily mean continuous outperformance. The question whether family ﬁrms in general perform better in the long run cannot be deﬁnitively answered by a comparative study of a few. The very fact of a long history, and therefore of success by some measure, renders them unrepresentative. Evaluating performance through large samples raises similar problems: a choice of modern ﬁrms will leave out historical failures. Even samples that involve frequent cross-sections of data often leave out private companies in early eras because of data unavailability and thus exclude a big section of the family-enterprise sector. Above all, large samples even with a perfect sampling technique do not examine what is peculiar in the family setting about decisionmaking and entrepreneurial choice: a detailed investigation of this must depend on case studies. A working hypothesis is that some sectors, activities, or technologies hold out more opportunities to the family ﬁrm than others. Families offer a particular way of casting the contracts that constitute a ﬁrm.28 Family-controlled enterprises are more likely to be found in industries and technologies that demand a long-term perspective, and less likely to be found in very fast-growing industries with very high capital requirements. Case studies help to identify the particular strategic choices made by families and their ﬁrms, as well as the consequences of failure to make the right choices. This book considers three families from different countries, the Wendels in France, the Haniels in Germany, and the Falcks in Italy. They have been selected because of their longevity and because for most of their business history they were active in a sector that was strategic in European industrialization efforts, in military preparation, and in the management of social conﬂict. They are all literally representative of “Rhineland capitalism” in that all three families began their business activities in the industrial areas of the Rhine and Moselle valleys. But the families are not “typical”; indeed it\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n11\n\nwould be hard to think what the criteria would be for a typical family. Neither are they iconic ﬁgures of national family capitalism; such a choice would have involved other, more notorious, dynasties: the Schneiders in France, the Krupps in Germany, the Agnellis in Italy. In the twentieth century, all three ﬁrms were shaped by the political cataclysms of defeat, occupation, and large-scale industrial reorganization. In the 1960s the Haniels substantially sold their steel and iron interests; in 1978 the Wendel steel business was nationalized (by a conservative French government). Both family enterprises then developed into conglomerates with a wide range of holdings. Those of Haniel are centered in retail and wholesale trading (in particular through the control of Metro, the world’s secondlargest retailer, and a pharmaceutical distributor, Celesio). They are also substantially more globalized than the Wendel holdings, which are still based mostly in France, with a concentration on abrasives (Wheelabrator), energy, and real estate (Orange Nassau), but also a very internationalized risk-management company (Bureau Veritas). Falck moved away from steel production in the mid1990s, after nearly two decades of almost uninterrupted losses. One of the Falcks’ new areas of activity, energy, continues the family interest in hydroelectric power in the early twentieth century that contributed crucially to the success of the dynasty. Thus the family enterprises have reverted from industrial production to the mercantile (for Haniel) or political (for Wendel) backgrounds of the families in the eighteenth century. It is easy to see this trend as a microcosm of European economic development: ﬁrst, the strong commercial tradition, then the embrace of heavy industry, followed by deindustrialization and the shift to a ﬁnancial and service economy. Europe’s big dramas focused on iron and steel in the nineteenth century, and on the legacy of steel in the late twentieth century. The three families differ in regard to the presence of family management, governance, and corporate structure. The Wendels and Falcks retained much greater family inﬂuence in management than the Haniels. The ﬁrms also vary in the extent to which they used the joint-stock company as a way of perpetuating family capitalism. In the midst of great crises of national capitalism, both the Falcks and the Haniels pursued a course that made them less like jointstock corporations and more like family ﬁrms, in an apparent reversion to an older historical model.\n\n12\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nMy survey of the stages of European business organization treats the national and company stories in parallel. It moves from the individualistic capitalism of the late eighteenth century (Part I), through the rise of the modern corporation in the second half of the nineteenth century (Part II), the new and massive involvement of the state in economic organization as a consequence of the twentieth-century world wars (Part III), and postwar reconstruction in Europe (Part IV), to the modern challenge of globalization (Part V). The Family as Intermediary between State and Markets It is worth examining why families can play a very dynamic role in several speciﬁc social and economic settings. Society is polarized between formal hierarchical organization in political institutions (what might be termed the state in a very broad sense) and the anarchic interplay of individual decisions and wishes in a market. Neither one by itself provides a viable way of managing social and economic interaction. States can command only at the price of inﬂexibility, while markets require codes of conduct and rules, which are most easily determined by some form of political negotiation. The family, as an intermediary organization, is particularly effective when both states and markets are chaotic and disrupted. This has obviously been the case in many parts of continental Europe over the past two centuries, when political stability was exceptional. Family capitalism has thus been particularly important in countries and societies experiencing profound shocks and discontinuities. It is a way of managing risk in a high-risk environment. This historical role is conﬁrmed by recent work which suggests that in developing countries undergoing economic transition family ﬁrms play a major role. They can generate better access to market capital because they create a degree of trust that offers a response to market failure. They provide a higher degree of human or social capital. Thus with the liberalization of the Indian economy since 1991, family groups (which many predicted would disappear) have become more important.29 The European experience, which was politically turbulent until the mid-twentieth century, offers some important lessons. It is directly relevant to the problems of developing resilient companies and robust corporate governance throughout most of the world. Two of the family groups studied in the follow-\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n13\n\ning pages, the Wendels and Haniels, remade themselves under the threat and challenge of the French Revolution, when property relations were challenged and transformed. The Haniels and Falcks survived as industrial families and, contrary to initial expectations, were substantially strengthened by the transition from totalitarian to representative democratic rule in Germany and Italy. There are obvious analogies in Japan, where after 1945 the U.S. occupation dissolved the industrial conglomerates, or zaibatsu, and purged ﬁfty-six members of zaibatsu families, but within a decade the family groupings had effectively reconstituted themselves.30 There is no simple one-way track from family ﬁrm to dispersed ownership that corresponds to a rational development or modernization of the economic process. For example, one of the family ﬁrms considered here, Falck, started in 1906 as a joint-stock company (Acciaierie e Ferriere Lombarde) substantially controlled by banks, and Giorgio Enrico Falck was really a manager, with little of his own rather meager capital in the company. During the 1930s the enterprise became a family ﬁrm. Following different paths, the major instruments of the Wendel and Falck families were jointstock companies for most of the twentieth century, but the availability of vigorous capital markets in the late twentieth and early twenty-ﬁrst centuries made a private holding more attractive again. One way of understanding how family ﬁrms not only survived but took advantage of profound social and political transitions is to examine how the families conceived of themselves and their role. Large-enterprise families (as opposed to small-scale artisanal family ﬁrms) frequently and explicitly compared themselves to monarchs of the ancien régime: they preserved the dynastic principle and what it represented into modern times.31 After the Italian electorate rejected the monarchy, Gianni Agnelli became “the uncrowned king of the nation,” with intense press interest in the ﬁrm’s succession struggles and difﬁculties. The family and its organization in a company could offer a self-consciously aristocratic or even royal vision. At the beginning of the twentieth century, an inﬂuential German handbook referred to the corporation as having an “aristocratic mold.” The Krupps saw themselves as monarchs.32 At one level, then, the family seems to offer an alternative locus of loyalty to political allegiances—in other words, to the state. At another level, it can substitute for the anonymous abstractions of the market. Companies in general—following the classical analysis\n\n14\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nof Ronald Coase—are ways of substituting control for market operations in a climate of information uncertainty. Family ﬁrms offer a particularly clear logic of control. Economic development is thus best understood as the story of the interplay of families, states, and markets and of the differing ways in which they understood themselves and one another. Property is a central concept in explaining this interplay. Critics from Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels onward have attacked the family as an economic rather than an emotional construct: the bourgeois family was kept in place by a sense of property rather than by romantic love or tender paternal and maternal feelings. The intangible assets and networks of the family thus became quite material and tangible. In this tradition Pierre Bourdieu (in an article illustrated by a photograph of Wendel family members lined up at the funeral of the dynastic patriarch) concluded that “the family spirit and even the affection that create family cohesion are transﬁgured and sublimated forms of the interest speciﬁcally attached to the membership in a family group, or to participation in capital whose integrity is guaranteed by family integration. By this . . . collective alchemy, the membership in an integrated family assures every individual the symbolic proﬁts corresponding to the cumulative connections of all members of the group.”33 The supposed incompatibility between love and rationality then produced continual psychic crises and made the institution of the family emotionally and in the end psychologically dysfunctional. The family did change, however, in response to changed ideas about affection. In the Wendel and Haniel dynasties, for example, marriage between cousins was extremely common in the nineteenth century but quite rare after the First World War. There is an economic reason for this shift, as well as the more obvious reason of changing cultural norms. Without a joint-stock company as a way of organizing and limiting family owners’ control of the company, family members needed to be tightly controlled in some other way. Parental choice of marriage partners avoided the dissipation of wealth through the marriage of heiresses to aristocrats, wastrels, or charming adventurers. Thus it was not a coincidence that when joint-stock companies with limited liability became generally available on the European continent in the 1860s and 1870s, some of the necessity for parental discipline disappeared. Bad behavior by heirs\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n15\n\nno longer had the capacity to wreck the whole family unit. In consequence young men became free to spend their inherited fortunes on racehorses, and young women could have exciting and insolvent husbands. Changes in family ﬁrms thus reﬂected changing notions of property. The Precarious Stability of the Family The family ﬁrm played a central role in the early stages of European industrialization, before the institutional innovations associated with the joint-stock limited liability corporation (generally a feature only of the mid-nineteenth century and later). At ﬁrst there was little alternative to the family as a way of establishing a link based on trust between individuals. There was no way legally of enforcing trust, so it had to depend on family piety and duty. Religiously pious families often did much better in commerce because they established trust more easily. But families remained important even after the emergence of the joint-stock company as a way of establishing a solid long-term business relationship among people with potentially divergent interests. The cynic might have asked: If you have a company, why do you need a family that behaves like a company? But the old models of behavior were deeply entrenched in the European psyche. At the beginning of the novel The Man of Property, John Galsworthy describes the Forsytes, a British dynasty: Those privileged to be present at a family festival of the Forsytes have seen that charming and instructive sight—an upper middleclass family in full plumage. But whosoever of these favored persons has possessed the gift of psychological analysis (a talent without monetary value and properly ignored by the Forsytes), has witnessed a spectacle, not only delightful in itself, but illustrative of an obscure human problem. In plainer words, he has gleaned from the gathering of this family—no branch of which had a liking for any other, between no three members of whom existed anything worthy of the name of sympathy—evidence of that mysterious concrete tenacity which renders a family so formidable a unit of society, so clear a reproduction of society in\n\n16\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nminiature. He has been admitted to a vision of the dim roads of social progress, has understood something of the patriarchal life, of the swarmings of savage hordes, of the rise and fall of nations.\n\nIn the family enterprise, the close relationship of family members solved a number of problems that would otherwise have impeded economic growth. In an age of great demographic uncertainty, with high mortality rates, it offered a way of securing the future of an enterprise. Relatives who were brought into the ﬁrm could give security, lend money, and provide reliable business contacts in distant cities. Daughters could be used in the same way they were treated by the royal families (also a sort of business) that governed Europe: to make strategic alliances between ﬁrms on a secure and long-term basis. Marriage remained, long into the age of romantic love (and longer than for other social classes), a business transaction. In the twentieth century, André Michelin was still urging his family to preserve wealth by marrying cousins (a strategy common in such long-lived dynasties as the Rothschilds, Haniels, and Wendels). In fact in the premodern world women also played a central role in business management, a much more substantial role than that played by women in business in most twentieth-century European societies. A study of the French iron industry during the French Revolution found a large number of iron businesses headed by women as political turmoil and persecution drove male business leaders into ﬂight; the iron mistresses included the widows of Charles de Wendel and of Jean-Albert Frédéric de Dietrich, and Madame du Bourg de Bozas.34 The French and German business dynasties examined in this book were controlled by powerful widows during the upheavals of the 1790s; and the French and Italian ones in the 1870s, again at moments of great national trauma. From the mid-nineteenth century, however, joint-stock companies held out an attraction to an increasingly patriarchal world in that they were ways of bringing in professional (male) managers and excluding female relations. In this respect there is an element of truth in the widely supported notion that “the rise of capitalism is the root cause of the modern social and economic discrimination against women, which came to a peak in the last [nineteenth] century.”35 Families are of course not always harmonious. As Tolstoy reminds us at the opening of Anna Karenina, they can be unhappy in quite different and ingenious ways. In a business context, family\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n17\n\nquarrels required some sort of legal management and institutional solution in order to stop feckless or irresponsible or simply irrepressibly entrepreneurial individuals from endangering the whole enterprise. The Wendel family disputes produced two highly complicated and long-drawn-out legal cases in the early nineteenth century. In the same period the brothers Haniel were infuriated by the scroungingly parasitical behavior of their brother-in-law, to whom they were bound in a joint business venture. At the end of the twentieth century, after a series of business setbacks, the Falcks split their family enterprise between two branches. Keeping the family together was not an easy exercise before the creation of the legal concept of a limited liability corporation. Then, when limited liability offered a new way of protecting wealth, it also endangered the ideal of family control, in that family members might sell their shares in a publicly quoted corporation. Demographics could also hurt a long-lived family venture. Since about a ﬁfth of nineteenth-century marriages produced no children, there was a strong likelihood of families’ dying out. Alternatively, there could be too many children, too many heirs, and too much subdivision of family wealth. Inﬂuences on Organization In examining what Galsworthy called “a reproduction of society in miniature,” this book addresses four questions related to how the family ﬁrm crucially shaped national styles of capitalism: • Are there cultural as well as national differences in entrepreneurial behavior? • What is the relationship between owners and managers? • How does business interact with politics? • What impact does crossnational business activity have on the formulation of business strategy?\n\nFirst, what sense does it make to use “nation” as a concept in analyzing cultural differences in entrepreneurial behavior? It may be that well-developed extended families were and to some extent still are more a part of social life in large parts of Catholic Europe than in the more individualistic and atomistic Anglo-Saxon world. Anyone who has had lunch on a Sunday in a restaurant in provincial\n\n18\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nFrance will have been struck by the large multigenerational family groups; and there are similar sights in Italy and Germany. Of course, there are great dynastic families in other cultures, but they are less frequently bound together in business transactions. Galsworthy’s Forsytes, intensely money-centered as they are, do not share in any commercial enterprise. They go their own ways, some to demand returns of 5 percent, some to be content with government bonds yielding 3 percent. By contrast, the continental family ﬁrm is a community of interest, with (today) 750 family owners in the case of the Wendels and 550 in the case of the Haniels. (There are more descendants than there are owners: in 1990 there were 1,259 living descendants of the nineteenth-century François de Wendel). Even in the mid-nineteenth century, the number of partners struck a visiting English observer as the most extraordinary feature of the Haniel ﬁrm. This house has realized what John Cockerill was unable to do at Liège, and perhaps the success of Messrs. Haniel is traceable to their depending on their own skill and industry, instead of ambitioning the alliance and the capital of kings or governments . . . this family is strong in the number of its members, who, especially the younger portion, are indefatigable in their superintendence of works, while they live in an enviable harmony that is in itself a source of wealth.36\n\nBut the social-religious explanation of Catholic family life is not entirely compelling: a great many of the great French family businesses in industry were Protestant (though the Wendels and Seillières were Catholic); and the Haniels, like the Krupps, were Protestant; while the Catholic Thyssens had spectacularly and notoriously bad family relations (as did the Wendels in the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century). Each confession was aware that the other embodied different traditions: the great German industrialist Hugo Stinnes, for instance, described the Haniels and Krupps as “AngloSaxons” who were more reliable than Thyssens.37 But each had strong notions of the links between family and faith. What appear to be cultural differences are frequently in reality the results of different national legal and ﬁscal traditions. In particular, the continental European tradition initially owed a great deal\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n19\n\nto the principles of equal inheritance introduced by the French Revolution and the Code Napoléon, which was also applied in many western areas of Germany. European law made it problematic and legally contestable to leave property principally to an eldest son; the droit d’aînesse, or right of the oldest, was rejected as a part of the feudal order. The division of property made for longer-lived family ﬁrms, and more difﬁculty in “exiting,” since the capital of many members of the family was locked together in the company, and an attempt to separate the components might well render it worthless. By contrast, the common-law traditions of Britain and the United States had no such restrictions on the testamentary disposition of property. There was no problem in an elder son’s deciding that it conformed to his interest to go to the stock market and raise outside capital. In Japan, complex and formalized family codes regulated inheritance and characteristically limited the ability of family members to incur debts or guarantee the debt of others.38 Charles de Wendel in the mid-nineteenth century helped to launch an initiative aimed at abolishing partible inheritance, but the proposal was widely (and successfully) attacked as a restoration of the ancien régime and an overthrow of revolutionary principles. The partible inheritance provisions could be circumvented only by new legal devices—in particular, from the middle of the nineteenth century, the joint-stock company, in which the company’s statutes established a model of governance and made the multiplicity of owners irrelevant to the day-to-day life of the corporation. But sometimes this type of protection was not chosen. There was an older alternative, which had a feudal ﬂavor: the entail, or Fideikommiss. In Germany, the steel dynasty with the most obviously feudal pretensions, the Krupps, adopted the Fideikommiss as a means to pass on the inheritance intact. But it had its odd consequence: the family home, for instance, was then treated as a part of the factory.39 Europe (including Britain) had very strict bankruptcy laws, which increased the incentives to make family groupings that would save members who had made business miscalculations. Since entrepreneurship is inherently concerned with taking risks, and some risks inevitably end badly, many analysts now see bankruptcy ﬁgures as an indication of a society’s entrepreneurial capacity. Julian Hoppit produced a pathbreaking study of bankruptcy as an indication of in-\n\n20\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\ndustrial success in eighteenth-century Britain.40 One of the features that contributed greatly to nineteenth-century U.S. economic success was the relaxed attitude to bankruptcy: American society did not need family support as a mechanism to help with the bad consequences of failed entrepreneurial strategies (as well as simple fecklessness), since failure was not judged as harshly. In the twentieth century, ﬁscal issues, in particular capital gains and inheritance taxes, have been major determinants of business structure: holdings are kept for a long time in order to avoid capital gains liabilities. The second comparative issue is one that is raised by any ﬁrm, and increases with the size of the ﬁrm. It is now generally discussed as the principal-agent issue, but businessmen were clearly aware of the issue of whether they could trust their managers well before the term was introduced. Are there mechanisms to ensure that the management does not promote its interests at the expense of the owners? A high dependence on managers may promote growth at the expense of proﬁtability, as the managers beneﬁt from increased activity that makes their functions more important. Having managers who come from the owning ﬁrm removes this problem to some extent, but at the price of depriving the ﬁrm of access to the best skills and qualiﬁcations for management. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, visitors to the Wendel works were struck by the almost complete absence of a managerial layer: the owners supervised almost every detail and discussed matters directly with the foremen on the shop ﬂoor. By contrast, the Haniel-owned companies were managed from the mid-nineteenth century by “directors,” and in the early twentieth century one of these, Paul Reusch, made an energetic push to expand. Managers often develop some philosophy to explain their preferences for expansion, and one of the most common ways of doing this over the past two centuries was through appeals to national issues: prestige, security provisions, and then increasingly the expansion and maintenance of high levels of employment. They presented themselves as allies of the state in a quest for bigness. They were national managers. An alternative vision for the managerial mission was techne: the pursuit of better scientiﬁc solutions to practical problems. Especially in Germany, in the nineteenth century there developed a vision of the rationality of enterprise that was based on its capacity to produce technical innovation.\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n21\n\nMuch of the search for a national business raison d’être looked futile by the end of the twentieth century. Over the past twenty years, the divided interests of owners and managers have again become a topic of intense discussion. But the rather faddish concept of the 1990s, “shareholder value,” did not provide an effective solution. Instead shareholder value was instrumentalized chieﬂy by managers as a way of linking their rewards to short-term indicators of performance. By the twenty-ﬁrst century, disillusionment set in, and there is a new search for a way of making motivation effective throughout a large enterprise. The third major question is implicit in the ﬁrst two considerations of national peculiarities: What is the relationship between business and the state, and how does it vary among countries? In what circumstances can states be captured by particular interests, and how does political history affect ownership structure? Mark Roe has produced an interesting explanation of the divergence of ownership patterns in the United States from those of continental Europe which rejects the idea that a particular legal tradition creates a simple path-dependency (as in the common-law link to shareholder protection). Instead, social democracies in the twentieth century put a high value on employment in the ﬁrm, and thus wished to restrict measures that might lead to a more effective representation of shareholder interests. By contrast, a widely diffused ownership is a response to the ability of shareholders to inﬂuence corporations. Thus the major feature of the U.S. trajectory is the absence of a strong social democracy. Roe concludes: “Where social democracy was strong, the public ﬁrm was unstable, weak, and unable to dominate without difﬁculty; where social democracy was weak, ownership diffusion of the large ﬁrm could, if other economic and institutional conditions prevailed, begin.”41 The argument could be put more generally: the strong continental European state and family business traditions are intertwined. A less interventionist state would not produce such strong clusters of family bonds as a counterpole to its power. If this pattern does in fact exist, it should show some dramatic effects in the history of iron and steel. The iron and steel business is politically an especially sensitive one, in the ﬁrst place because it was required for armaments production, and was the base of military and thus ultimately of political power. During the twentieth century it was at the center of political disputes about employment,\n\n22\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nthe responsibility of business to maintain jobs (exactly the kind of issue Roe believes to be central), and co-determination in corporate governance. The intertwining of families and politics is readily visible as social history in that modern politics required a social role for business. Social contacts presented a way of obtaining political and economic leverage. Economists describe this sort of process as obtaining rents. The Wendels were rapidly ennobled primarily as a reward for their military services (and it was a military ofﬁcer who started the family’s excursion into iron). During the 1790s the Haniels developed a thriving business out of supplying iron for munitions for the armies of the counterrevolution. Franz Haniel was on good terms with the Prussian royal family: as a young man he danced with the princess who became the tragic Queen Louisa of Prussia; as an older businessman he welcomed the crown prince of Prussia (later Frederick William IV) to his coal mines. The Wendels developed substantial political interests, and sat in French parliaments from immediately after the Restoration of 1815 (and also in the German Reichstag after 1871, where two Wendels were members for Lorraine). François (II) de Wendel became the most powerful French businessman of the interwar period and the subject of many attacks on the power of the 200 families said to control the policies of the Banque de France. From 1997 to 2005 his great-nephew, Ernest-Antoine Seillière, was chairman of the major employers’ organization, now known as Medef, and was at the forefront of the ﬁght against the Jospin government’s imposition of the thirty-ﬁve-hour week. The London Financial Times snidely observed in 2000 that “taking on the French government may not be bad for your business career.”42 The Haniel-controlled Gutehoffnungshütte (GHH) was at the center of discussions about political intervention in wage determination in the Weimar Republic, and of the co-determination debates of the 1950s. For the Falcks, the greatest problem of the 1960s and 1970s was dealing with politically diverse labor unions in the steelworks. Politics mattered everywhere in industry in the twentieth century. The intertwining of strong state and family business does not necessarily produce a climate of mutual sympathy. In order to understand the dynamic, it is necessary to contemplate how countries interpreted their industrial histories. In Germany, France, and Italy\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n23\n\nthe search for inﬂuence by business took place in the context of political debates around the issue of backwardness and catching up. The wish for some alteration of the existing order involved profound social criticism. For much of the nineteenth century the external reference point was the British experience, and for much of the twentieth the American. (In the twenty-ﬁrst century the Asian model may compel attention and force structural change.) Given the importance of business families during the debate about backwardness, it is unsurprising that many policymakers concluded that family business and backwardness were coterminous, and thus that the dominance of family ﬁrms was a barrier to adopting best practice from abroad. The state also became the focus of attempts to catch up or to modernize and was viewed as an instrument of a development strategy. In mobilizing forces for change, the state identiﬁed enemies/ scapegoats that could be used to explain the resistance, failure, and disappointment inevitably encountered during the modernization project. Thus policymakers came to believe that the state could supplant or succeed the family as a form of social and economic organization. The statist focus has the deepest historical resonance in France. Indeed the phenomenon of state-run economics is often described as “Colbertism,” after Louis XIV’s minister, economic planner, and modernizer. Colbert also identiﬁed enemies—in his case, the traditional aristocracy. In the nineteenth century, Napoleon attempted to make good the damages done by revolutionary upheaval and to systematize the legal and institutional bases of the French economy, and his nephew Napoleon III launched a new push to drive the French economy forward. The Third Republic by contrast seemed politically and institutionally crippled by what was from the 1930s widely described as “Malthusianism,” the limitation not just of population growth, but of every other sort of growth in a kind of collective self-restriction.43 From the collaborationist Vichy period in the 1940s until the 1980s, the state again came to be regarded, in very different ideological settings, as the generator of growth that would overcome the Malthusian propensity. Much of the debate on ways of overcoming backwardness was focused on heavy industry, and especially on iron and steel, because of their importance for national defense, and thus for the projection of\n\n24\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nthe national image. Steel was the backbone of a new economy and a new state. The most striking physical embodiment of the legacy of the French Revolution, erected on the centenary in 1889, was the iron Eiffel Tower. The quest for control over iron and steel played a major part in France’s political development over two centuries: ample though they were, the coalﬁelds of northern France proved to be less productive than those of the great Ruhr valley basin. The consequence was that the large iron-ore reserves of the Lorraine area were frequently separated politically from the greatest coal resources in Europe, and the most basic components of industrialization needed to be shipped across national frontiers. Lorraine thus became a geopolitical hinge for European power politics. Steel became a political obsession because of its importance in the manufacture of military equipment, and for a long time national success was gauged in terms of statistics on population and crude steel output. The state interacted with owners of the steel business. Often their interests did not coincide, with the result that they tried to inﬂuence each other. Because iron and steel were the business of the state as well as the business of business, the business dynasties sought political leverage in order to affect entrepreneurial outcomes. They cultivated ﬁrst the courts of the ancien régime, and then the postrevolutionary parliaments and ministries. A substantial number of deputies and senators came from the steel-producing Chagot, Coulaux, Dietrich, Petot, and Wendel families. Even in the 1970s, it mattered politically that Valéry Giscard d’Estaing was related to the Schneider dynasty. And as late as 1968, the economic historian Bertrand Gille noted the “permanence of the large owners in the political life of the nation.”44 The political centrality of steel tied the Wendel industrial dynasty inextricably to the history of the French state. During the French Revolution, Wendels were accused of providing the aristocrats, royalists, and foreign powers with munitions to be used against the French people. Their assets were conﬁscated. In the late nineteenth century, Wendels were often suspected of being unpatriotic because they had steelworks on both sides of the GermanFrench border in Lorraine. During and after the First World War, socialists and reformist Catholics accused the Wendels of having prolonged the war by obstructing the destruction of their Lorraine\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n25\n\nsteel mills by artillery or aerial bombardment, with the result that Germans were able to use the steel for munitions. The accusers ignored the fact that their chief target, François de Wendel, was probably the most committedly nationalist and most Germanophobe member of the whole dynasty. Similar charges circulated during the Second World War, culminating in the post-Liberation barring of François de Wendel from political ofﬁce because as a senator he allegedly had voted full powers to Marshall Pétain (in fact he was one of the very few senators deliberately to absent himself from the meeting, so that he did not have to vote on this issue). In the postwar era, the attacks continued. François de Wendel was the model for a hugely popular novel by Maurice Druon portraying the decline and disintegration of an ironmaster’s family and business, and in general the decay and decadence of French capitalism. Not until the late 1970s, when a conservative government nationalized the French steel industry, did the Wendels move into relative political obscurity. Finally in the 1990s, with extensive privatization and the opening of the French economy to outside investment, in a surprising turn family capitalism was strengthened, as it had been in previous times of upheaval. The head of the Wendel enterprises, a family member, once again became a major and controversial political ﬁgure as a result of his leadership of the employers’ organization Medef. In France the debate about stagnation retained a high proﬁle from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century; today it has resurfaced with a series of popular books devoted to unmasking those responsible for poor French economic performance. In Germany, by contrast, the most acute period of national reﬂection about backwardness was the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century. Especially in the impoverished 1840s, many reformers looked to the English experience as a model, arguing that the alternative to English-style industrialization was Irish-style rural impoverishment and famine. Entrepreneurs could see themselves as heroes of the national drama, whereas before German uniﬁcation the plethora of conservative and bureaucratic states was a limiting force. But there were a multitude of paths to English business practice and success: while some advocated a classical liberalism that had plenty of room for the heroic entrepreneur, others (notably Friedrich List, who was largely ignored during his short and mostly unhappy life) thought\n\n26\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nthat the state should intervene in the promotion of growth. By the end of the nineteenth century the statist view had triumphed over the liberal option. After the 1850s Germany experienced a period of substantial growth, characterized by great and, in the last phases of the boom, euphoric optimism. This growth, described by W. W. Rostow as the German “take-off,” coincided with the process of political integration and to some extent drove it. The inﬂuential journalist and commentator Ludwig August Rochau characterized German unity in the 1860s as “a simple business calculation, nothing more or less.”45 Germany subsequently became a model for other states, notably Japan and Italy, seeking shortcuts to modernization. After the enactment of the Prussian law on joint-stock companies in 1870 and the establishment of the German empire in 1871, there came a wave of speculative company creations. It was followed by a crash, and a long period of sobering up. The survivors of the Gründerkrach of the 1870s became the great dynastic ﬁrms of German heavy industry: in metallurgy, the Thyssens, Krupps, Stumms, Röchlings—and Haniels. Textbooks frequently attribute a substantial and even deﬁnitive role in German industrialization to the new universal banks, which were themselves largely creatures of the 1870s. According to Alexander Gerschenkron’s classic interpretation, banks made up for some of German backwardness by mobilizing otherwise unavailable capital. The Gerschenkron hypothesis has not survived modern scholarship, for although banks undoubtedly played a major part in one of the deﬁning industries of German modernity, the capitalintensive electrotechnical industry, they played almost no role in the equally dynamic chemical industry. The steel and engineering dynasties borrowed relatively little, and relied for their investments mostly on internally generated funds.46 It is more useful to think about the peculiarities of German development as a process of organizing in order to manage competition. At the turn of the twentieth century, a new economic crisis prompted a search for new ways of expanding and consolidating industrial empires. It was then that banks brieﬂy came into their own as the managers of takeovers, mergers, and cooperative associations. These reorganizations were not driven by operations on the capital market, and until the 1990s there were no major hostile\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n27\n\ntakeovers in German business life (the Thyssen-Krupp merger is the ﬁrst example, and even in this case an initially hostile bid became by 1998 a friendly liaison). Instead the move to industrial gigantism was pushed by deﬁnitions of areas of common interest, and banks played a large role in brokering consensus. The real period of bank dominance of German industry was relatively brief, from around 1900 to the Great Depression, and—in terms of its macroeconomic results—not particularly successful. The banks were responding at ﬁrst to a clear market failure, in particular of the capital markets, which were stunted by a highly restrictive stockexchange law of 1896. Bank inﬂuence was weakened by the great inﬂation after the First World War, and the banks only brieﬂy managed to rebuild their positions precariously with borrowed foreign money, before they were destroyed by waves of ﬁnancial panic during the Great Depression. After the First World War and the associated and subsequent inﬂation and hyperinﬂation, many of the largest German heavy industrial enterprises attempted to build trusts as a way of managing their cost structures and planning sales more precisely. The idea of a planned economy, with or without the participation of the state in the planning process, took hold. The Nazi dictatorship was able to build on previous attempts to manage a collectivized economy, and suppressed price signals in a way that had already been begun in the First World War. During and after the Second World War there was a substantial debate about the responsibility of the business community for Germany’s political disaster. There were two contrasting approaches, both substantially colored by ideology. According to one interpretation, inﬂuentially advocated by the U.S. occupation authorities in the immediate aftermath of the war, it was capitalism that had produced the dictatorship. The dynasts of German industry looked particularly sinister, and were later memorably evoked in Luchino Visconti’s 1969 ﬁlm The Damned (La Caduta degli dei). The appropriate policy response was the breakup (or decartelization and detrustiﬁcation) of German industrial holding structures. An alternative vision, held by German liberals, made state dirigisme responsible for the catastrophe and saw the market as a solution. Neither of these ideological programs was ever fully realized; detrustiﬁed industries reshaped and recombined, and the idea of\n\n28\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nmore competition was undermined by the maintenance of much of the regulatory system of the 1920s and 1930s. In practice Germany’s road to economic recovery lay in a double strategy, which ﬁrst emphasized cooperation between “social partners,” labor and capital, as a way of overcoming the destructive distributional politics of the past. This was the pattern later celebrated as the Modell Deutschland. The idea of long-term responsibilities of owners ﬁtted well with some of the paternalist traditions of German industry, which could be neatly tweaked in order to adjust to a new climate. Second, there was a greater push to internationalize business activities earlier than in the other major continental European economies. The economic success of the Federal Republic was built on twin pillars. One consisted of small-scale family enterprise in the socalled Mittelstand sector, which began to run into major problems in the late twentieth century. New family ﬁrms found the succession problem difﬁcult to manage, and the whole sector was in general badly undercapitalized and hence not resilient to shocks. The other pillar consisted of big ﬁrms, many of which were also family enterprises, and most of which were skeptical about the possibilities of the capital market until the late twentieth century. They faced severe problems in adjusting to the changing structure of the world economy, and many of the famous names of German industrial history—the Flicks, Thyssens, and Krupps—disappeared from the industrial landscape and retreated to high society and gossip-page glitz. With a slowdown in German growth and a controversial push to adopt “Anglo-Saxon” reforms of the capital as well as the labor markets, it became tempting once again to think of a German lag and to offer organizational explanations for economic problems. The history of Italian economic development through much of the nineteenth century is one of economic backwardness and of poor resource endowment for the crucial technologies of the European industrial revolution—in particular, the absence of large ironore reserves and coalﬁelds. What Italian advantages there were lay in a network of relationships, with a strong family content, that was combined with an interest in technical progress. The great Milanese economist Carlo Cattaneo developed a theory according to which intelligence formed the major principle of public economy:\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n29\n\n“Control of new arts gave plentiful and reliable food to a number of families. They took their secrets from land to land; their wealth was the idea they had developed. They often remained divided from the crowd owing to their foreign origin and their different religion. Their knowledge became an inheritance, a perpetual privilege; they became a caste.”47 Especially in Lombardy, the commitment to technical education became institutionalized at an early stage through the Milan Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Sciences, established in 1838.48 From the last years of the nineteenth century, Italian politicians searched for institutional mechanisms for overcoming backwardness. The principal feature of Italian backwardness appeared to be the underdevelopment of the capital market. At ﬁrst many business leaders believed that the best device for transcending Italy’s institutional limits lay in ﬁnancial institutions that could mobilize domestic investment resources and also attract foreign investments. But such institutions were themselves quite vulnerable. In 1893 there was a general banking crisis following a severe economic downturn, in which two of the largest Italian commercial banks, Credito Mobiliare and the Banca Generale, failed. After this episode there was more or less continual political intervention in business structures, with the result that business, ﬁnancial, and political interests became closely interconnected. A new set of banks, closely linked to a German model of industrialization, became very powerful, but also immediately became the focus of political attention. Periodic crises destroyed ﬁnancial values and demanded restructuring. After the First World War, such restructuring usually occurred at the public initiative and with public funds. The ﬁnancial story of twentieth-century Italy can be summarized as the repeated destruction of capital, both of investors in the stock market and of government contributions. The steel sector took a major part in this story. It was in general particularly adept at capturing the state, with the result that some critics, like the Socialist Ernesto Rossi, referred to steel as “la grande parassitaria.”49 But to speak of “steel” as a single interest is misleading. It was a particular type of steel industry, the large integrated works, usually sited on the coast in order to have access to imported ore, that was generally most effective at “capture,” at ﬁrst\n\n30\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nof the banks and then of the state. The family ﬁrm of Falck staked its strategy on resistance to those sectors that were particularly effective in the capture maneuver. The ﬁrst hope of liberal Italy at the beginning of the twentieth century was that the country could be made ﬁnancially and economically more robust through the operations of two large and newly established German-style universal investment banks in northern Italy, the Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI, also often called the Comit) and the Credito Italiano (Credit). These Milanese banks rapidly became intertwined with factions in the political elite of liberal Italy.50 In addition to a German business model, these institutions initially operated with German capital. They derived most of their earnings from underwriting, and promoted quite speculative enterprises. After a sharp setback in the stock market following the U.S. crisis of 1907, the stock-buying public turned away from this kind of asset, and the banks had to retrench.51 The banks’ hold was further shaken by the inﬂation during and immediately after the First World War, and then by the postwar deﬂation. The major crisis of the steelmaker Ansaldo severely affected the banks, and in a dramatic and conspiratorial conﬂict, the BCI undermined the ministry of the liberal politician Francesco Nitti. The major steel producer Ilva was restructured in 1920, with new share capital (as well as loans) from the two big commercial banks. The banks emerged as the effective controllers of much of Italian heavy industry, and in particular of steel. But that dominance made them highly vulnerable in the deﬂationary business climate of the 1920s, following the stabilization of the Italian lira in 1927 at the overvalued quota novanta, or ninety liras to the British pound. Their industrial assets lost value during the depression, producing a de facto insolvency of the major Italian credit institutions. The industrial hegemony of the universal banks was thus ﬁnally destroyed by new deﬂation during the world depression at the end of the 1920s and in the early 1930s. The Italian government tackled the problems of the ﬁnancial sector by demanding that the banks sell their industrial securities to holding companies that were eventually concentrated in the giant state holding company Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI), established in January 1933. IRI made virtually all of Italy’s large-scale industry dependent on the state, and ensured that this\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n31\n\nsector was the least dynamic and least ﬂexible in the postwar recovery. The Italian economic miracle depended instead on large numbers of small-scale family ﬁrms. After the Second World War a new industrial bank emerged, backed by the Christian Democratic government, with the aim of providing a new way of organizing an inherently Italian structure of enterprise that was not dominated by the big state-run institutions. Enrico Cuccia’s Mediobanca (established in April 1946) was initially in ownership terms a creature of IRI, which at ﬁrst held 68 percent of the stock; but its policy was controlled by a voting trust of leading private-sector industrialists, who with only 3.75 percent of the shares were given an equal voice in the new bank. The idea of Mediobanca was bitterly opposed (predictably) by the representatives of the state industrial sector, notably by Donato Menichella, the powerful head of IRI.52 The imbalance between state provision of ﬁnancing and private control of policy was widely seen as the key to an Italian phenomenon of “capitalism without capital.” An inﬂuential governor of the Bank of Italy, Guido Carli, described Cuccia’s role as that of the sentinel “protecting the empty barrel of Italian capitalism.”53 Mediobanca had shareholdings in big Italian family companies, such as Fiat and Pirelli, and also organized interlocking shareholdings among family groups. Its role has sometimes been regarded as quite mysterious, with opaque links to politics and to religion, including the Holy See. The Italian ﬁnancial system had been hostile to the development of a stock market, but over the past thirty years it began to change, largely as a result of pressures to reform and modernize, arising from Italy’s membership in the European Community. The Consob, an agency to supervise the stock market, modeled on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, was established in 1974. In 1983 European Community provisions gave a larger role to mutual funds, which over the next two decades became major presences on the Italian ﬁnancial scene. In 1991 EC law required the publication of consolidated balances for ﬁrms and groups. In 1998 the lex Draghi increased the legal protection of shareholders. With this opening, the role of large family businesses at ﬁrst increased, but then began to fall away. Financial liberalization and the growth of the capital market thus destroyed important aspects\n\n32\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nof the institutional framework that had favored family business for the previous century. By one estimate, family-controlled pyramid companies accounted for 30 percent of the market capitalization of the Milan stock exchange in 1950, 40 percent by the mid-1980s, and 20 percent by the end of the 1990s. Deaths of major ﬁgures in Italian business life were now interpreted as the end of the era of family capitalism. The demise of Enrico Cuccia in June 2000 and of Giovanni (“Gianni”) Agnelli in January 2003 were heralded as the unsticking of a glue that held family capitalism together.54 There is a consensus that the Italian economic miracle owes a great deal to the ﬂexibility of small and medium enterprises, particularly in sectors such as textiles and clothing, where constant innovation, and rapid response to changing fashion demands, can create value in an industry that would otherwise seem logically destined to move to low-wage production countries. The legacy of Italy’s family capitalism for larger enterprises is more controversial. Fiat spent a great deal of the late twentieth century stumbling from one entrepreneurial disaster to the next. Many critics—as in France—accused family enterprises of being badly managed. In some industries, such as steel, it was possible to destroy wealth on a big scale. Indeed, the head of my case study in the 1990s, Alberto Falck, told me that it was the wealth of his family that allowed him to continue to bear continuing heavy losses in the 1970s and 1980s. Bad times and business losses obviously meant the erosion of much capital. The large family companies were then controlled by families that continued to possess in fact only a minority of the shares, and that managed to assert ownership by complicated shell companies. This was the real meaning of Italian “capitalism without capital.” What other sort of wealth-holding might have stood a better chance of preserving value? In fact, Italian stock markets and publicly quoted companies have—with very short-lived exceptions— fared very badly (see Figure 1).55 One Italian twentieth-century peculiarity in comparison with other industrial countries was the weakness of the stock market. Between 1960 and 1975 there was a dramatic loss of real value of Italian stocks. But even during the subsequent period of institutional reform and modernization, the performance of the Italian market has been exceptionally weak in\n\nintroduction\n\n100,000\n\n1906=100\n\n10,000\n\n•\n\n33\n\nGermany Italy France U.S.\n\n1,000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n98 19\n\n90 19\n\n80 19\n\n70 19\n\n60 19\n\n50 19\n\n40 19\n\n30 19\n\n20 19\n\n19 0 19 6 10\n\n1\n\n1. Dollar stock index for France, Germany, Italy, and the United States, 1906–1998\n\ncomparison not only with the United States but also with France and Germany. The weakness should be interpreted as a reﬂection of the inadequate protection of minority shareholders and correspondingly of the power and inﬂuence of insiders. The lack of returns on the stock market in turn encouraged family members to keep their wealth concentrated in the family groups. In turn, outsiders launched big battles for corporate control, seeking to become insiders in their turn. “Capitalism without capital” was thus very directly a consequence of the poor transparency of corporations and hence of the feebleness of the Italian stock market. The Italian case is an extreme example of development distorted by an inadequate capital market, but it also raises the question whether this is a common European problem that arose in weaker forms in other national settings. Backwardness (and speciﬁcally the poor state of the capital market) and dependence on state guidance look like two sides of a coin that became the standard currency of political debate in continental Europe. Fourth, and ﬁnally, then, national businesses may want to look outside the national political setting for other outlets for activity in an effort to internationalize or globalize their activities. All three\n\n34\n\n•\n\nintroduction\n\nfamily businesses examined in the following pages had from their beginnings substantial international contacts: the entrepreneurs looked abroad, to England in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, to the United States in the late nineteenth century and beyond, and (in the cases of Wendel and Falck) to Germany. Thus the story of the steel dynasties is a European one, and not one conﬁned to particular national cultures. The ﬁrst initial surge in growth of the Haniels occurred during the French revolutionary wars. In 1870–71 the Franco-Prussian war brought much of ore-rich Lorraine into the German empire, and thus into the same political unit as the Ruhr coal reserves. The settlement was a major blow to French political, economic, and military power. Yet the Germans quickly viewed the outcome as unsatisfactory, since the Treaty of Frankfurt left the substantial ore reserves of the Longwy-Briey basin (whose potential had largely not been recognized in 1870) in French hands. German plans for expansion thus involved more annexation—of Longwy-Briey, as well as of industrial resources in Luxembourg and Belgium. In the twentieth century, the creation of a new holding of a diversiﬁed group of assets required geographic extension. After the First World War the Haniel interests were extended to southern Germany, and their activity in the Netherlands and Switzerland increased. Since the 1960s, and in particular with the move to discounted shopping through Metro, the internationalization has become much more dramatic; in the 1990s especially, the search for new markets in central and eastern Europe and in China has produced new strategies. The Wendels also ﬁrst expanded out of Lorraine to sites for steel production in the north and on the Mediterranean coast, where access to cheaper imported iron ore was easier. In the 1990s they looked for a much broader kind of diversiﬁcation, with more high-technology and electronic interests and assets. Businesses will continually adapt to new market conditions, at least if they are to continue to be successful. The success of family ﬁrms in continental Europe was due to a broad carapace of protective institutions—some in the law of inheritance and in tax law, some in political contacts, some in market organization (through the nineteenth-century German cartel system). None of this protection could guarantee success, but it created the conditions for an effec-\n\nintroduction\n\n•\n\n35\n\ntive evolution. It also made the ﬁrms controversial. There are thus two major intertwined themes in the following pages, one of the family as a focus for business activity, and the other of the idea of backwardness in continental European capitalism that produced a constant demand that the state intervene and compensate for industrial and economic retardation.\n\nPA R T\n\nO N E\n\nThe Age of the Individual\n\nThe European ancien régime was a family affair, at every level of society. The most obvious embodiment of the dynastic principle was the hereditary divine-right monarchy; but poor peasant farmers also treated their activity as a household enterprise. At every level, families looked to dynastic marriage strategies to ﬁnd greater wealth and power. The marriage of a Bourbon prince to a Habsburg princess was only the highest-level exempliﬁcation of the logic of family existence; farmers could try to marry additional land. (Analogies between the world of business and the world of royalty continue today: the Queen of England apparently habitually refers to the monarchy as “the ﬁrm.”) Family values meshed especially well with craft traditions in manufacturing. Ironworking and textiles abounded in all sorts of arcane techniques and secret tricks that needed to be carefully guarded from competitors. Businesses were continually prying and trying to lure skilled workers away from their rivals, and industrial espionage evolved into a major ancien-régime activity. The best defense against defecting craftsmen was to restrict the most important secrets to sons or even daughters: the sons would be locked into the business, and the daughters would be useful bargaining chips in the strategic game of dynastic marriage. For some people in the eighteenth century, the collectivism and anti-individualism of their family-dominated world looked strange and irrational. It was also at odds with the relatively new idea that states had identities that went beyond the person of the ruler, and that an Enlightened ruler should be, as Frederick the Great memorably put it, the ﬁrst servant of the state. Among royal marriage alliances, for example, Louis XVI’s union with the Habsburg MarieAntoinette was seen as an affront to French national interest. During and after the French Revolution, a cult of romantic individualism released men and women from family ties, which were reinterpreted as being conventional and restrictive. In economic life, territorial changes, the upheavals of markets, and the search for new technologies that would yield military advantage all helped to shape an image of a creative individual entrepreneur driven by a demon. The new man both created and destroyed: he was a sort of\n\n40\n\n•\n\nthe age of the individual\n\nNapoleon of the business world. But there was an irony in all this Napoleonic emulation: Napoleon depended on his family for inﬂuence and power and became an archetypal dynast.1\n\nSome comparisons: Wendel, 1850: 22,000 tons of cast iron and 2,000 workers (11 tons per worker) Jacobi, Haniel & Huyssen, 1867: 18,730 tons of cast iron and 1,220 ironworkers (15 tons per worker) Rubini & Falck, 1858: 1,000 tons of cast iron and 400 workers (2.5 tons per worker)\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Wendels and the French State\n\nIt seems to me that I am well placed to deserve the goodwill of a just government. François de Wendel, 1824\n\nT\n\nhe Wendel family began its industrial existence in part in France, and in part in the Duchy of Lorraine. Ancien-régime France was far from being a static society, in which a rigid feudal order blocked attempts at social mobility. Between the nobility and the peasantry there were many intermediate groups: minor gentry who cultivated their ﬁelds, small-scale ofﬁcers, producers and merchants who sought prosperity and status. But the nobility for a long time imposed its values on the rest of society—which consequently tried as hard as it could to join the nobility.1 Since this was a quite commercialized society, money could buy titles, privileges, patents of nobility, and shares in royal inﬂuence, royal power, and royal revenue. Thus a quarter of the aristocracy of France consisted of parvenus ennobled, like the Wendels, in the eighteenth century. A century before the French Revolution destroyed this society and created new paths to social mobility, the Wendels were just such a family: originating in Bruges, in Flanders (the Van Daëls), a branch of the family had moved to the Rhineland and as ofﬁcers fought in the service of Catholic small princes. Jean-Georges Wendel had been a colonel in a Croat regiment ﬁghting in central\n\n41\n\n42\n\n•\n\nthe age of the individual\n\nEurope during the Thirty Years’ War; his son Christian Wendel was a cavalry captain in the army of Duke Charles IV of Lorraine. One of Christian’s sons, Jean-Martin Wendel, made an advantageous marriage to Anne-Marguerite Meyer, the daughter of a substantial fermier (more likely to have been a cog in the enormous privatized tax-collecting bureaucracy of the fermiers-généraux than a simple agricultural farmer, or fermier). In 1704 Jean-Martin used his wife’s money to buy, for 9,000 livres (around $2,000)2 and an annual rent of 100 livres, the iron forge of Hayange from the king of France. This was a substantial but not overwhelming amount of money at a time when a skilled craftsman could expect to earn around 200 livres a year. Iron had been extracted at Hayange since 1260, and in 1446 the ﬁrst forge had operated there. This small town was situated in a deep valley of the river Fensch, where the water cut through layers of ore-bearing rock. In 1704 there was a little industrial settlement, including a forge (named Rodolphe after its creator, Rodolphe de la Roche), a furnace (called the Magdelaine), a hammer mill, and a cutting mill. The latter two were incomplete, and the rest of the equipment was crumbling. The whole works had been sold two years previously to the commissioner of artillery in Thionville, Louis de Ridouet-Sancé, for 1,500 livres; he had probably also needed to put in around 9,000 livres, and had still failed to make a successful business. The monarch sold the right to use forges essentially as a revenueraising device, and the mastership of a forge was especially attractive to purchasers in that it carried with it a noble title. In 1723 a royal decree stated that letters patent from the king were required before a new iron factory could be established.3 Wendel was by then a maître de forges and a seigneur—the seigneur d’Hayange. The title went with the forging, one of the few commercial activities that was permitted to noblemen (it did not “derogate” from their nobility); shipbuilding and glass manufacture were the other permitted trades. These activities thus had an unusual status in a world in which most industrial or commercial activity was literally debasing. The attraction of iron and ships lay in the fact that they represented weapons for conﬂict, which was unambiguously the noble profession. On the other hand, if the master were to abandon the forge, the title would also be forfeit. Hayange had in fact been traded in this way quite actively: the ﬁrst forge there had been built\n\nThe Wendels and the French State\n\n•\n\n43\n\nby Rodolphe de la Roche, who had obtained a royal patent, and four subsequent would-be ironmasters had taken over the forge before Wendel. Wendel seems to have prepared himself, and had already directed a forge at Ottange, slightly to the north of Hayange. But he needed a substantially larger sum than the purchase price to make anything of Hayange. In total, he needed some 30,000 livres ($6,200), which he borrowed from bankers in Metz and Thionville.4 This kind of investment made sense only if the basis of the operation was to be expanded. In 1709 Martin Wendel demanded the cession of another ruined Hayange forge, named de la Morelle, whose owner, Benoît de Malzy, had failed to pay the feudal dues to the seigneur d’Hayange, namely Wendel. By 1711 he had successfully conﬁrmed the acquisition of this forge. Wendel also bought territory, and above all woodland, which he needed to supply the charcoal for the forges. By 1720 he was operating ﬁve furnaces. He also rebuilt the chateau in Hayange about 1720, and in 1727 obtained letters patent from the duke of Lorraine, conﬁrming his noble quality independent of his iron activity. The patent added that the nobility could not be formally proved since the titles had been “lost in the misfortune of war.”5 Already in 1711 he had obtained from the French monarchy “an ofﬁce as king’s secretary” in the chancellery of the Metz parlement, a minor royal ofﬁce that ﬁnalized his ascent into the lesser nobility.6 In the 1930s the Wendels reacted with considerable indignation to the suggestion of the American magazine Fortune that they were arms producers and dealers, merchants of death.7 But armaments is exactly how the family started its long engagement in the French iron and steel industry. Wendels had in fact not made armaments as such since the early nineteenth century, but from the point of view of the French state—as under the ancien régime—iron and steel were fundamentally important because of their potential military use. The only customer of the Wendel forge for most of the eighteenth century was the royal artillery works in Thionville. Wendel established his business at a propitious time, in that there was a great demand as a consequence of the War of Spanish Succession. The only risk was military: as Louis XIV was increasingly isolated politically, a forge situated in the far east of France was vulnerable to the attacks of the Habsburg and British coalition. The chaotic\n\n44\n\n•\n\nthe age of the individual\n\ncircumstances of war ﬁnance, and the inﬂationary schemes designed to stabilize the government (this was the time of John Law’s famous monetary experiment), in fact made it easy for individuals as well as the state to borrow, and easy to repay debt. It thus produced a wave of quite speculative business foundations. (The late eighteenth century proved to be a much harder ﬁnancial environment.) When Martin de Wendel died in 1737, his estate was valued at 700,000 livres. His eldest son, Charles, inherited the works; two years later he made another important strategic marriage, to the daughter of the king’s receiver of ﬁnances in Lorraine, Marguerite d’Hausen, who brought a dowry of some 60,000 livres. Again, as with his father, there was a dynastic link to the ﬁscal bureaucracy of ancien-régime France; though at the same time as Charles worked with the French state, like his nineteenth-century successors he also dealt with another political unity, in this case the Duchy of Lorraine. Like his father, he beneﬁted from the expansion of wartime demand for armor and bullets, in his case during the Seven Years’ War. Charles was determined to expand the ironworks further, and in particular bought substantial tracts of land in order to prospect for ore, and also to secure the necessary supply of charcoal. He bought woodland to the west of Hayange, in Longwy. The search for wood touched one of the most sensitive social issues of ancien-régime France, since woodlands were used extensively for animal forage, and deforestation thus put the livelihood of French villagers at stake. The peasants of Ranguevaux, on the hill just above Hayange, took their complaint about deforestation to the Financial Court in Bar, which limited Charles’s felling of wood to 600 arpents annually, while Hayange consumed 18,000–20,000 cordes.8 The locals also complained about the pollution of the river Fensch, which led to the periodic death of ﬁsh (and a consequent diminution of their income). Constrained in Hayange, Charles de Wendel bought another forge in eastern Lorraine, at Sainte-Fontaine, on the river Merle, from the duke of Lorraine, again with a hereditary title; here he had the right to fell up to 11,000 arpents from the forest of Bouzonville. In 1749 he obtained from the duke an authorization to operate a blast furnace at Hombourg. In view of the wood problem, Wendel also began to experiment with the use of coal in 1768.\n\nThe Wendels and the French State\n\n•\n\n45\n\nBy this time his forges were producing 1,370 tons of iron annually.9 After 1769, however, iron prices fell as competition among the Lorraine and Saar manufacturers became more intense. Searching for markets for his products, Charles de Wendel saw little alternative to state orders. In 17"
