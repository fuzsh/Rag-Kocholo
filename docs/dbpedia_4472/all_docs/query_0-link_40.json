TRANSLATOR'S NOTE As in the first four volumes, the translator has, from personal observation, or with the assistance of others, been able to amplify the descriptions of a number of pictures in British collections, and to note some changes of ownership. The translator's additions and corrections are enclosed within brackets. The translator has again added an index of the painters and engravers mentioned in the text. The translator has to thank Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, Bart. ; Mr. D. S. MacColl, Keeper of the Wallace Collection ; Mr. Herbert Cook ; Mr. Thomas Rennie, Curator of the Glasgow Art Gallery ; Dr. A. H. Millar, Secretary and Curator of the Albert Institute and Victoria Galleries, Dundee ; and Mr. D. S. Meldrum for much courteous assistance in the preparation of this volume. EDWARD G. HAWKE. Vll DIRECTIONS TO THE READER 1. The pictures are arranged according to their subjects in the follow- ing groups : Sacred History, Mythology, Profane History, Allegory, Genre, Portraiture, Landscape, Still-Life, and Undescribed Pictures. 2. Within each group the pictures known to exist are described as far as possible in the alphabetical order of the names of the towns where they are preserved.1 Then follow the pictures known only from descriptions in books, in the chronological order of the notices referring to them. 3. The numbering is continuous. Pictures, the descriptions of which are lacking in precision, are given numbers with letters appended ; this signifies that any such picture is probably recorded under a separate number with a full description. In exceptional cases, however, newly discovered pictures have had to be inserted in their proper places in the list, and assigned numbers with letters.2 4. The titles of the pictures known to the compiler by personal inspection, and of a few known to him from trustworthy reports or good photographs, are printed in capitals. 5. In the measurement of pictures the height precedes the breadth. The terms \" right \" and \" left \" are used from the spectator's point of view. 6. In the descriptions of pictures not known to the compiler, the critical remarks are copied from the book or sale-catalogue quoted as an authority for the existence of the picture. 7. In the case of sales extending over several days, the date of the first day is given, even if the picture in question was sold on a later day. 1 In cases where a picture has changed hands while the book was passing through the press, it has not always been possible to adhere to this rule. 2 In several cases, while the book has been passing through the press, two pictures separately described have been found to be identical. In such cases, where time permitted, the two entries have been amalgamated and one of the numbers left blank. — Translator's Note.

His father had also been an artist, and had in his youth, between the years 1602 and 1611, visited Italy and Rome; but since 1621 he had been employed as a tax-collector in his native town and only worked as a draughtsman. Doubtless his son received his first lessons from him. Drawings as early in date as 1625 and 1626, from the hand of the younger Gerard, are in existence. In 1632 his father sent him from home, for in this year he was at Amsterdam, and in 1634 he was a pupil of Pieter Molijn at Haarlem. In these towns he may have gained his first impressions from the art of Rembrandt and Frans Hals. In 1635 he journeyed to England. In 1640 he was at Rome, and probably was again at Amsterdam in 1645. He went in 1646 to Miinster in Westphalia, where a congress was discussing the peace of Europe, and many eminent persons from the countries of all the ruling princes were assembled. Apparently he was drawn there by the prospect of obtaining commissions for portraits. Of all that he did at Miinster in two or three years few works can be traced (see Nos. 216, 240, 241, 242, 256, and 260), but among them is his masterpiece, \"The Peace of Miinster\" (No. 6, appar- ently the original of Suyderhoef's engraving, which is of the same size). Though it is a small picture, it is one of the most imposing historical works of the whole Dutch school.1 At Miinster Ter Borch gained the favour of Count Pefieranda, one of the Spanish envoys, who took him to Madrid.2 There he was in high repute, but soon had to flee the country, apparently because of some amatory intrigue. It is often assumed that Ter Borch, while in Spain at this time, came under the influence of the works of Velazquez, who was himself living in Italy. It would indeed be very remarkable if the mighty 1 The other works mentioned in connection with it — the sketch for a picture of the Congress in the Louvre, an \" Entry of Ambassadors \" in the Rathaus at Munster, and a representation of the marriage of the Great Elector — are not by Ter Borch. The last-named picture is by J. Mijtens and is in the Rennes Museum. 2 Houbraken's statements as to an earlier visit to Spain, between 1635 and 1645, are vague and xmconvincing. VOL. VI B 2 GERARD TER BORCH art of this court-painter, so closely akin to his own, had passed him by without leaving any trace. But if one tries to trace this influence by omZ ng TergBorch's works done before his Spanish journey and those doTaf erwards, it is difficult to find definite proofs. One need only refer to the dated pictures in this catalogued Ter Borch was governed by a desire to reproduce his models with fidelity to nature before he came into contact with Velazquez. In his case the models are townsfolk, whereas with Velazquez they are princes and nobles. Velazquez painted his sitters life size, but Ter Borch painted them on a small scale. But before and after hi7 Spanish journey the Dutchman's townsfolk painted in little stand on the same high artistic plane as the proud court society painted life size by the Spaniard. Ter Borch's sense of colour was fully developed before the journey. His dated works of 1651 to, say, 1656, in which the Spanish influence ought to be most clearly perceptible, show no advance in his power of handling colour as compared with the works done between 1640 and 1650, and they show no inclination whatever on his part to adopt Velazquez' distinctive colouring. Ter Borch's work became more delicate and more dignified in tone and more simple in colour between 1660 and 1680, but this was the consequence of his own artistic development and can hardly be set down to the credit of his stay in Spain ten or twelve years before. At the end of 1650 Ter Borch was once more in his own country. From 1654 he can be traced at Deventer. He settled down as a respected citizen and remained there till his death. Ter Borch's art is, with very few exceptions, confined to two branches, genre and portraiture. He painted only one historical work, \" The Peace of Miinster,\" which might indeed count for many others, but after all only contains portraits. The mythological and allegorical scenes, attributed to Ter Borch in old catalogues, have all disappeared and we cannot judge of their merits. There are two pictures in which a horse or a cow is the principal object (Nos. 463, 464). But all his other works are either portraits or genre-pieces. In Ter Borch's genre- painting two stylistic periods may be clearly distinguished. The earlier is related to the art of Codde, Duck, and Duyster. The later runs parallel in some respects to the art of Metsu. After Ter Borch had received his first lessons from his father, and had probably also been influenced by the art of Hendrik Avercamp, he went, as we have seen, at the age of fourteen or fifteen to Amsterdam, where Codde, Duck, and Duyster were then enjoying the greatest prosperity, painting countless pictures and assembling numerous imitators round them. Their favourite theme was scenes from military life in the tavern and in the guardroom — the \"corps de garde,\" from which their pictures have received the name of \"Kortegaardjes.\" Ter Borch chooses subjects so similar to theirs that it is very easy to attribute their pictures to him,2 and mistakes of this kind have often remained undetected for a long time. Yet in technique, that is, in the drawing and colouring, a distinct difference can 1 It may be noted here that the date 1642 on the \"Portrait of a Woman\" at Munich (No. 395) cannot possibly be right. The woman wears the costume of a much later period, as does the man in the pendant (No. 313). 2 See the notes to Nos> 3?c and 4O- GERARD TER BORCH 3 be recognised from the outset. Ter Borch's types are not those of his predecessors. He shows even at this early date the fine silvery-grey half- tones on the flesh which are characteristic of the figures of his prime ; his colour, above all, is more delicate in tone, and he is much more strongly inclined to emphasize the contrast of light and shade. The pictures described below under Nos. 34, 35, 37, 40, and 42 are very typical ex- amples of this early manner. The later manner, which reminds one strongly of Metsu, begins with the \"Woman peeling an Apple\" of 1651 at Vienna (No. 74), the wonder- ful \" Despatch \" of 1653 at the Mauritshuis, The Hague (No. 28), and the not less remarkable \" Paternal Advice \" at the Rijksmuseum, Amster- dam (No. 1 86). From this point up to his last dated work, \"The Duet\" of 1675 in the Rothschild collection at Waddesdon Manor (No. 140), he painted a series of masterpieces which are among the most admired creations of the Dutch school. The pictures illustrate the life of the well-to-do classes ; most of them are musical scenes, scenes at the toilet, flirtations, and conversations. They are all distinguished by a certain calm and dignity ; emotional displays are rarely found. Elaborate compositions are equally rare. There are never more than three or four figures ; often there is but one. The figures are always absorbed in their occupation. We see only the boy who is cleaning his dog, or the girl who is reading, drinking, or playing music. The very gestures of the listener and the speaker, in which all depends on the most subtle observation of momentary attitudes which can scarcely be reproduced, are most admirably rendered by Ter Borch, so that the spectator is freed from all doubt as to his mean- ing. It would lead one too far in this place to enter into further detail. The reader may be referred to the excellent sketch by W. Bode in his Great Masters of Dutch and Flemish Painting. Ter Borch was a complete master of the art of rendering textures, and of light and shade. This is shown not only by his genre-pieces, but also by his portraits, of which about 160 or 180 in all survive. They are all of the same small size, whether they are half-lengths, three-quarter lengths, or full lengths. Most of them are single figures ; but there are a number of portraits of married couples or small family groups, and there are also a very few larger groups. As coloured costumes, at the bidding of fashion, were laid aside and replaced by black and white materials, the painter was set an exceptional problem which he solved with the greatest skill. He has such a keen eye for his black velvets, cloths and silks, and for his white satins, and he renders the high lights and reflections so cleverly that although he is painting in monochrome the total effect is attractive as a piece of colour. This is all the more remarkable because even on the floor and the back-walls of his interiors there is scarcely any drawing or colour, and the colouring of the separate pieces of furniture — usually a table and an arm-chair covered in deep red — is now much faded. With a single piece of silver, such as a watch, a dish or a toilet-box, or with a book, a few papers, or an inkpot, he contrives nevertheless to attain a piquant colour-effect. The careful student of Ter Borch's pictures, both of his genre-pieces and of his portraits, will be surprised to note how often the painter repeats 4 GERARD TER BORCH SECT. himself in details ; many figures in his genre-pieces occur a^in and agam either copied exactly or repeated with slight variations.* The fo d, -of th costumes in his portraits are often copied with such precision,- that one may almost conclude that the painter kept pictures of dresses ready m stock, to which he added the heads and hands as required. The article of furniture in his interiors, the chimney-pieces, beds, tables and chairs, are very often the same. c This habit of repeating himself, which is astonishing in the case of an artist of such importance, makes it very difficult to know what attitude to take up in regard to the many old replicas of Ter Borch s pictures. Un the one hand, it must be taken as proved that the painter copied his own work much more often than most of his equally distinguished con- temporaries. On the other hand, many of these replicas are not of equal merit, and there is usually one example— such as the \" Paternal Advice at Amsterdam— which soVar surpasses all the others that one can scarcely regard those others as repetitions from Ter Borch's own hand. In numerous cases the question is not yet ripe for solution and still needs a very careful inquiry. PUPILS AND IMITATORS OF GERARD TER BORCH Among our painter's kinsfolk, his father GERARD TER BORCH the elder (1584-1662), his cousin JAN TER BORCH of Buren, his half-brothers MOSES (1645-1667) and HARMAN (i638-before 1677), and his half-sister GESINA (1633-1690), also displayed artistic powers. Of the works of the elder Gerard there have only been preserved some drawings and engravings which reveal the style of an older period of art and have no sort of relationship to the works of his son. The only authentic example of Jan ter Borch, who was a pupil of Paulus Moreelse at Utrecht, is in the Rijksmuseum at Amsterdam ; it is \"The Drawing Lesson,\" with two life-sized figures by candlelight, and is treated in the manner of the Utrecht painters of candlelight scenes. By Moses ter Borch we have a fairly large number of drawings, usually in black and white chalk — studies of heads from his family circle, with the light and shade strongly marked. There are in the Rijksmuseum two similar heads, painted in oils, which in style correspond exactly to his drawings ; this resemblance of style, and the fact that the studies were in the possession of the Ter Borch family, suffice to show that they are the work of the dilettante, who died young. His sister Gesina was also a dilettante of somewhat modest talent. Her artistic productions are preserved in the Amsterdam Print- room. No oil-paintings from her hand are known. Weak pictures in the style of her brother are often ascribed to her, but this is mere conjecture. 1 Compare, for instance, Not. 186 and 187 ; the lady standing in this picture with the lady in 45. '74, «>d >70 } Nos. 162 and 163 ; the lady in Nos. iz8 and 132 ; Nos. 134 and 140 ; a Nos. 331 and 362, 221 and 451, 384 and 393. No., and so on. xvii GERARD TER BORCH 5 Mr. De Fremery of Oaklands, California (see Nos. 213, 248), who is related through his mother to the Ter Borch family, has pictures of twins of the Moerkerken family painted by Harman ter Borch ; they are signed and dated September 1659. The author has not seen them, and trust- worthy accounts of their style are not available. A group of Flemish painters, whose works are often confused with those of Ter Borch, is that which is connected with GONZALES COQUES (1618-1684). First of all, there is Gonzales Coques himself, in his admirably composed and carefully executed portraits ; and then there are CARL EMANUEL BISET (i633~about 1710) ; GILLES VAN TILBORCH (about i625-about 1678), whose initials \"G. T. B. \" are the same as those of Gerard ter Borch; and HIERONYMUS JANSSENS (1624-1693), nicknamed \"The Dancer,\" because he usually painted dancing assemblies. With all these painters, their Flemish character becomes sufficiently obvious, if the handling, the accessories, and the costumes are carefully examined. Setting aside these two groups of painters, we now come to Ter Borch's own pupils. Among them, CASPAR NETSCHER (1639-1684) has attained the greatest fame, but as the next section is devoted to him we may now pass him by. A certain BARTHOLD BERENTSEN is only known from the fact that Ter Borch's sister Sara, by her will of 1680, bequeathed 50 guilders to him as a pupil of her brother. A deaf and dumb artist named ANTONI JORDENS studied under Ter Borch, as we know from M. E. Houck's thorough researches in the archives ; but the only picture known to be by him, dated 1674, seems a very clumsy production. ROELOF KOETS (before 1650-1728), who must not be confused with the older Haarlem still-life painter of the same name, was certainly a pupil of Ter Borch, as we may see from his treatment of his numerous single portraits and portrait-groups, though he does not seem to have painted genre-pieces. He imitated Ter Borch's style cleverly, without ever attaining equal delicacy of execution or elegance of arrangement. He exaggerates the silver-grey tone which in his master's work is especially delicate and tender, making it superficial and coarse; he may be easily identified by this defect, as well as by the somewhat later styles of costume and hair-dressing in his portraits. The versatile Zwolle painter HENDRIK TEN OEVER (before 1643- after 1700), whose work is very unequal, seems in his portraits to have modelled himself on Ter Borch. So, too, did PIETER VAN ANRAADT (about 1640-1698), who can be traced as living at Deventer from 1660 onwards, save for a brief interval ; but in his portraits, which are usually life size, he shows the influence of the late work of Frans Hals and of Jan de Bray at least as strongly as that of Ter Borch. The genre-painters whose works are often wrongly ascribed to Gabriel Metsu, and who are mentioned in the section devoted to him (Vol. I. p. 255), may be also regarded more or less as imitators of Ter Borch. This is the case with JACOBUS OCHTERVELT (about 1635 -before 1700), JOHANNES VERKOLJE (1650-1693), and EGLON HENDRIK VAN DER NEER GERARD TER BORCH SECT. BuXehanTpalace and in the KOnigswarter sale, come very near to those of Ter Borch. One must not omit to mention that Rembrandt's pupil, GERBRAND VAN DEN EEOCHOUT (1621-1674), painted about 1655 some genre-pieces Auard-rooms and so forth-which are often m.staken for works by Ter Bofch, and which are only a little inferior to them in <U^«\"™*. work and colouring (see the pictures at Stafford House, The Hermitage, Copenhagen, Petworth, and elsewhere). Our painter's youthful works are closely related to those of the Duck- Codde-Duyster group, as is shown by the fact that even in recent years pictures of guard-rooms by these artists have been assigned to 1 er tiorcn (see notes to 37^ and 40).

Sm. i, and Suppl. 2. — In the large hall of the Rathaus at Miinster the envoys of Philip IV. and of the Republic of the United Netherlands are assembled to conclude peace. The largest group of envoys, which is also the principal group, stands round a crescent-shaped table covered with a green cloth, upon which lie boxes, books, and parchments. On the extreme right stands an ecclesiastic in a long grey cloak. The six Dutch envoys, standing on the left of the table, repeat the words of the oath of ratification, with their right hands uplifted. The two Spanish envoys, the Count de Peneranda and Anthony de Brun, repeat the oath, with their right hands resting on a Bible which lies open on the table. The Dutch envoys are arranged so that the representative of Overijssel, Willem Ripperda, stands, seen in profile, on trie left. To the right of him, in order, are the representatives of Groningen, Frans van Dohna ; Utrecht, Godard van Reede ; Holland, Adriaan Pauw, seen in three-quarter face ; Friesland, Jan van Mathenesse ; and Gelderland, Barthold van Ghent. The last-named, like Count de Peneranda, and the envoy in a red cloak, holds a copy of the oath in his left hand. On the extreme left stands Ter Borch himself behind a gentleman, who stands immediately behind the chair of Godard van Reede. This gentleman, wearing high boots and a buff coat, holds his plumed hat in his right hand and rests his left hand on the back of the chair in front of him. Behind the men named stand other envoys, all bare-headed. Among them a man in a red costume is noticeable. By the side-walls and along the back-wall are groups of delegates standing on raised places in order to follow the proceedings. On the walls is some richly carved panelling. To the right is a window. From the ceiling hangs a handsome chandelier with the figure of a saint. This is Ter Borch's most important work in portraiture. The small heads of the figures, some sixty in number, are full of character and expression. Signed in full on the left at top, and dated 1648 ; copper, 17! inches by ii\\ inches.
