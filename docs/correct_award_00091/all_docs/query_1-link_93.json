The Flanders Road, his best and most famous novel, is about the death of a French cavalry officer in WWII and the trauma that radiates from it, told from the perspective of a distant relative and soldier under him. If you’re a Proust fan, this is a novel for you. Plus it’s translated by the late, great Richard Howard.\".",
