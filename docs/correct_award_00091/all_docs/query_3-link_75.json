        "text": "The coveted Nobel Prizes are announced annually, and last year's lineup featured several American winners.\n\nA Harvard economics professor won, as well as University of Pennsylvania researchers for their work in developing mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 and a scientist and emeritus professor at The Ohio State University. Three U.S.-based scientists won for their work in chemistry.\n\nWith over 400 winners, the United States has the most Nobel Prize winners of any country.\n\nWhat is the Nobel Prize?\n\nThe Nobel Prize is a set of awards given each year to those who “conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,” founder Alfred Nobel said.\n\nNobel was an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist, businessman and writer, according to the Nobel Prize organization. When he died, he left most of his fortune to establish these prizes.\n\nThe categories are physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. There is also the Prize in Economic Sciences, created in 1968 with a donation from Swedish central bank Sveriges Riksbank.\n\nThe nomination process for Nobel Prizes begins in September each year, with thousands of academics, scientists, past winners and parliamentary members submitting candidates. According to the Nobel Prize organization, the nominators are chosen to represent as many countries and universities over the years as possible.\n\nNobel specified in his will that Swedish institutions would be responsible for selecting the winners of the Nobel Prizes. The Norwegian Parliament was to select the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. He also asked that the ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize be held in Norway. Today, Nobel Day is celebrated by presenting the prizes on December 10, the day Nobel died. The other Nobel Prizes are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden, as requested in Nobel’s will.\n\nThere are a few exceptions. Many prizes were not awarded during World War I and II. If a noteworthy work is not identified, the Foundation does not have to honor that category that year. For example, the Nobel Peace Prize was not awarded in 1966, 1967 or 1972.\n\nWhat is the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nPerhaps the most well-known of the awards, Nobel wrote in his will that the Peace Prize would go to those \"who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congrundefined\n\nIn the past, the awards have prioritized politicians who promote international peace through diplomacy, though they also honor humanitarian work. The work of a Peace Prize winner typically falls into one of these areas:\n\nArms control and disarmament\n\nPeace negotiations\n\nDemocracy\n\nHuman rights\n\nImprisoned Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi won the Peace Prize in 2023. Mohammadi has been in and out of prison for the last decade and is currently serving a 10-year jail sentence on false charges of \"spreading propaganda.\" Mohammadi has been described as the \"undisputed leader\" of a mass protest movement against Iranian authorities after they cracked down on how women are allowed to behave and dress. She is the vice president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran.\n\nWho won the Nobel Prize 2023?\n\nAll categories were honored last year and announced in October 2023. Up to three people or institutions can split the award. Here's who won:\n\nNobel Prize in physics: Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L'Huillier “for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter”\n\nNobel Prize in chemistry: Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Alexei I. Ekimov “for the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots”\n\nNobel Prize in physiology or medicine: Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman “for their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19”\n\nNobel Prize in literature: Jon Fosse “for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable”\n\nNobel Peace Prize: Narges Mohammadi “for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all”\n\nPrize in Economic Sciences: Claudia Goldin \"for having advanced our understanding of women's labour market outcomes\"\n\nHow much is a Nobel Prize worth?\n\nNobel Prize money comes from Nobel, who wanted his wealth to be invested into a fund for the prizes. The interest on that money is used for the prizes today. Last year’s prize money was worth 11 million Swedish krona, or almost $993,000.\n\nWho is the most famous Nobel Prize winner?\n\nWhile some of the Nobel Prize’s archived winners are known more for their contributions than their fame, there are some household names that have received the award.\n\nFour U.S. Presidents and one Vice President have won the Nobel Peace Prize:\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt in 1906\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson in 1920\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter in 2002\n\nVice President Al Gore in 2007\n\nPresident Barack Obama in 2009\n\nOther notable laureates, according to the Nobel Prize archives, include:\n\nMarie Curie won the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics along with her husband Pierre. Curie also won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.\n\nIvan Pavlov won the 1905 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine\n\nAlbert Einstein won the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics\n\nErnest Hemingway won the 1954 Nobel Prize in literature\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. won the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nMother Teresa won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nDesmond Tutu won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nElie Wiesel won the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nToni Morrison won the 1993 Nobel Prize in literature\n\nMalala Yousafzai was one of two recipients of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nBob Dylan won the 2016 Nobel Prize in literature\n\nOnly two Nobel Prize laureates have ever declined the prize. French playwright Jean-Paul Sartre had a reputation for declining all official honors and continued that tradition with the 1964 Nobel Prize in literature. Le Duc Tho was responsible for negotiating a cease-fire agreement with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger during the Vietnam War. The pair were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973, but Tho declined, saying he was not in a position to accept it.\n\nAdolf Hitler forbade three German Nobel Prize laureates from accepting the Nobel Prize, and Boris Pasternak, awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in literature, was coerced by Soviet Union authorities to decline.\n\nPast Nobel Prize winners: Only 64 women have won. She was the first.\n\nJust Curious for more? We've got you covered"
