        "text": "To the end of his life, even after he had won the Nobel prize for literature in 1985, Claude Simon, who has died aged 91, asked that his profession be recorded as that of viticulteur, or grape farmer, and not that of writer. Just as AE Housman once acknowledged that malt does more than Milton can to justify the dark ways of the Creator, so Simon took the line that to press grapes into wine was a more honest, more genuinely remedial trade than to press words into novels.\n\nYet his writing patently meant a great deal more to him than his farming. He wrote some 20 books, with extreme care, but chose to play down writing as an activity of the mind and hand that was no different in kind from what other manual workers do. He had much contempt for what he saw as the exaggerated prestige that goes with being a writer - in France even more than in other countries - and for all the hot air that is vented in Paris as the literati cavort beneath the intellectual big top.\n\nAfter his Nobel prize, Simon went, very much out of character, on a celebrity trip to the Soviet Union in the company of other literary grandees. When he got back, he wrote a sour account of it and of what he saw as the grotesque self-promotion of his - unnamed, though in some cases easily identifiable - fellow travellers. That little book of 1987, L'Invitation, raised the question of why the austere and censorious Simon had not done a Sartre and refused something as corrupt as the Nobel prize in the first place.\n\nSimon was by birth a colonial. He was born in Tananarive, Madagascar, to a father, a regular army officer, who was killed very early on in the first world war. Having moved to France, the family settled in the south-west, which is where Simon basically remained for the rest of his life, and where he grew his grapes, not far from Perpignan. His first idea was to become a painter, as a pupil of, among others, André Lhote, but he seemed never to have been good enough to expect to live by it.\n\nIn the 1930s, he went twice to war, first as an irregular helping to run guns to the Republican side in Catalonia, an experience that gave him the subject matter for one of his best novels, Le Palace (1962), and for another given special mention in his Nobel citation, Les Géorgiques (The Georgics, 1981); and then, in 1939-40, as a \"gentleman ranker\", middle-class but not an officer, in a French cavalry regiment, which was caught up in the rout of May-June 1940. Simon spent time in a PoW camp, but got out, retreated to his home ground in the then unoccupied Midi and began writing his first novel, Le Tricheur (The Cheat), which was finished in 1941, though not published until after the war.\n\nThese two hazardous and disillusioning experiences, of the Republican collapse in Spain followed so soon by the military debacle in Flanders, cured Simon once and for all of any thoughts he might earlier have had of campaigning to change the world ideologically. If he had seen himself as being on the side of the revolution when he first went to Spain, he was corrupted by the reality he was exposed to there, and by the time he returned to France, he saw virtue in being on no side at all.\n\nAll Simon's novels are, as narratives, accounts of how events as they evolve always defeat or deflect human purposes, and the more hopeful those purposes are, the more scandalous and inevitable is their frustration. In Le Palace, what is defeated is the immature faith of a student in a political revolution advertised by its proponents as being for the creation of a just society. The student - Simon himself, let us suppose - learns that the revolution will not happen, and that he would have been better off not hoping for it. Instead, having turned novelist, he looks to geometry for a more exact definition of a revolution: as the path followed by a moving body made to travel through 360 before ending up where it began.\n\nIt was fitting that Simon should have served in the cavalry in 1940 and even taken part in an attack by men on horseback against German tanks. That was as brave as it was futile, and an absurd postscript to the military exploits of past members of his family, to which there is reference in a number of his works.\n\nThe finest of all those novels is the one in which his own brief experience of warfare is used to tremendous effect: La Route Des Flandres (The Flanders Road, 1960), which he had originally wanted to call Fragmentary Description Of A Disaster. There, war becomes a metaphor all too suitable for the human condition in general, as the forms and protocols of the social order dissolve into murderous chaos. All that Simon can offer as a stay against chaos is the provisional order of art, and a grim acceptance that provisional is all this can be. His mature philosophy was stoical and ascetic, and he seemed, when you met him socially, to embody it: he was small, serious and untalkative, a man for the vineyards, not the salons.\n\nAfter L'Invitation, he published little: L'Acacia (The Acacia, 1989) was a typically dense, Faulknerian novel in which he returned to the dominant themes of his earlier fiction, not least that of warfare; Le Jardin Des Plantes (1997) was more accessibly autobiographical; and his final novel, Le Tramway (The Trolley, 2001), looked back to his boyhood.\n\nIn his books, Simon attends to the hard materiality of what the world contains with an incomparable closeness. He may once have failed to become a painter, but as a painterly writer he proceeds from scene to scene and his descriptions at their best are unforgettably graphic, absorbing like those of no other writer known to me in their precise physicality. The technique is cinematic, one scene modulating into the next without marked transition, as some element in it evokes a different one by visual association. And because events follow one another in a Simon novel not in the order in which they have happened, but in the chronology of their telling, he is a writer whose method takes some getting used to.\n\nFormally adventurous and demanding as he was, in the 1960s he was very much part in its heyday of the \"new novel\". Better now to say, however, that Simon was simply a novelist of rare quality, one of the sadly few who truly count of those who started publishing in France after 1945."
