        "text": "French novelist Claude Simon, a Nobel Prize winner, has died at the age of 91.\n\nFrance's Culture Ministry revealed Monday the author had passed away on July 6 and was buried in Paris on Saturday.\n\nSimon was known as a pioneer of the experimental \"new novel\" style of the 1960s, which dispensed with the literary customs of plot, narration and character development.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1985 with the Nobel committee praising his 1981 novel Les Georgiques (the Georgics), about three men's experience of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nUpon learning that he had won the Nobel Prize, Simon responded that he would use the money to fix the roof of his house.\n\nHis books contained little punctuation, mixed chronology and extensive descriptions. The author of more than 20 works often presented characters in states of emotional confusion who were obsessed with memory.\n\nSimon was not well-known, not even in France, as his books were frequently described as difficult to access.\n\n\"All I write is taken directly from real life, I only copy reality,\" Simon once said of his writings.\n\nMost of his work was influenced by his participation in the Battle of the Meuse in 1940 during the German invasion of France. Simon was taken prisoner and then escaped and spent the rest of the war working for the French Resistance in the south of France.\n\nHis 1960 novel, La Route des Flandres (The Flanders Road), highlights the death of a French captain through the perspectives of three soldiers.\n\nSimon was born in Madagascar on Oct. 10, 1913. His father, a French army officer, was killed in 1914 at the start of the First World War and his mother died when he was 11.\n\nSimon went on to boarding school in Paris and then studied in Oxford and Cambridge in the 1930s. He served in the French army for a year before heading off to Spain in 1936 to fight on the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nAfter the Second World War, he moved to Salses in the south of France and completed his first novel, Le Tricheur (The Cheat), published in 1946. His earlier novels had a more traditional style but by the late 1950s, the author began experimenting with different points of view and elliptical plots.\n\nHis 1951 marriage to Yvonne Ducing ended in divorce and in 1978, he married Rhea Karavas."
