        "text": "August 11, 2017\n\nWhenever I persist with and, finally, get into a Claude Simon novel, two thoughts occur to me: 1)I will seldom be able to convince anyone else to read this and 2)Claude Simon is in many ways the finest writer I have ever read.\n\nThe fact that those two facts exist simultaneously means my enthusiasm can rarely be shared or, if I do attempt to do so, it rarely convinces. Simon writes in such a complex way that to attempt to describe it renders it redundant. Whilst, however, his writing takes an awful lot of concentration, it is, unlike many better known writers of similarly 'difficult' writing, extraordinarily worth the effort. Puzzles within puzzles will be dealt to you and, yes, many will not be solved, but many will and the sheer, unadulterated pleasure at working out what is going on is remarkable. It is also worth stating that whilst his writing is without doubt 'experimental' it is so for a reason; the form is integral to the story. This is true from novel to novel, but also, in the grander scheme; Simon overall is writing about what it is to read, what it is to be told a story, what it is to experience things; what it is to be alive. That he does all this with no authorial narrative whatever- no asides, no allusions to the inner psychologies of his characters- is all the more remarkable. In Triptych, this is more successful than anywhere else in his prose. Beyond these general assertions you probably don't need to know much more as the novel is about itself and writing a review of this is needless. So; take a week off work and devote your time to reading this. It is tough going by absolutely wonderful.\n\nJanuary 18, 2013\n\nWhen you go to a museum and see a still life, do you think:\n\n(a) \"This is amazing! Look at the detail on that orange!\"\n\n(b) \"He's an incredible painter, I just wish he'd turn his attention to detail to something interesting!\"\n\n(c) \"I hate still lives...nothing happens.\"\n\nIf you are type (a) you will love this book. If you are type (b) you may tolerate this book. If you are type (c) you will hate this book.\n\nIt's impossible to say what this book is about, other than it is a still life written by a master."
