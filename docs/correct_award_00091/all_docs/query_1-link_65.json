        "text": "Claude Simon was a French writer who wrote several semi-autobiographical works, many of which are inspired by his own experiences in World War Two. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1985, which is the reason I picked up a copy of The Flanders Road. After learning that Gabriel Garcia Marquez (one of my favourite writers) was the Nobel winner the year my brother was born, I looked up who won it the year I was born and learned of Simon for the first time.\n\nThe Flanders Road is less than 200 pages long and yet it took me months to finish it. The plot is almost non-existent, I struggled to differentiate the characters, and I never figured out the timeline. The book is largely composed of run-on sentences in a sort of stream-of-conscious style.\n\nThe main character is probably a young soldier named Georges though by the end of the book I was somewhat convinced all the other characters were segments of his personality. Georges’ captain is a distant relative and Georges witnesses his death in a scene that is played out over and over again in many different ways. There is also a complicated relationship with the captain’s much younger wife and a recurring theme of death and adultery through their shared family tree.\n\nThe repetition of that central scene and the frequent focus on horses brought to my mind The Wars by Timothy Findley, which was published after this book. I wouldn’t be surprised if Findley had read Simon’s work.\n\nThis is the sort of book that I used to feel like I wasn’t smart enough to get. But as I’ve gotten older and become more confident in my own reading, I’ve decided instead that this is the sort of book that just isn’t for me. There are certainly powerful moments within The Flanders Road and I can see that Simon is working to make a statement about war. I can agree with and notice these things while also seeing that this is not a novel that works for me.\n\nThis book was translated from the French by Richard Howard"
