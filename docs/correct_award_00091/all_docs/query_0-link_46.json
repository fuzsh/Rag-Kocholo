        "text": "(1913–2005). The works of French writer Claude Simon are among the best of the experimental “new novel” style that emerged in the 1950s. He was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1985.\n\nClaude-Eugène-Henri Simon was born on Oct. 10, 1913, in Tananarive, Madagascar, where his father, a cavalry officer, had been stationed by the French army. Simon’s father was recalled to France during World War I and died in battle six months after Claude was born, and he was raised by his mother in Perpignan, France. After studies at Paris, Oxford, and Cambridge, he traveled extensively and then fought in World War II. He was captured by the Germans in May 1940, escaped, and joined the French Resistance, managing to complete his first novel, Le Tricheur (1945; The Trickster) during the war years. Later he settled in his hometown in southern France, where he cultivated vineyards.\n\nIn Le Vent (1957; The Wind) Simon defined his literary goal: to challenge the fragmentation of his time and to rediscover the permanence of objects and people as evident by their survival through the upheavals of contemporary history. He treated the turmoil of the Spanish Civil War in La Corde raide (1947; The Taut Rope) and Le Sacre du printemps (1954; The Crowning of Spring) and the 1940 collapse of France in Le Tricheur. Four novels—L’Herbe (1958; The Grass), La Route des Flandres (1960; The Flanders Road), La Palace (1962; The Palace), and Histoire (1967)—constitute a cycle containing recurring characters and events. Many critics consider these novels, especially La Route des Flandres, to be his most important work. Later novels include La Bataille de Pharsale (1969; The Battle of Pharsalus), Triptyque (1973; Triptych), and L’Acacia (1989; The Acacia).\n\nSimon, like other practitioners of the new novel, or antinovel, rejected the form and style of traditional novels. His style is a mixture of narration and stream of consciousness. His prose frequently lacks punctuation and is densely constructed, with 1,000-word sentences, through which he attempts to capture the very progression of life. Despite such features, his novels remain accessible. Simon died on July 6, 2005, in Paris."
