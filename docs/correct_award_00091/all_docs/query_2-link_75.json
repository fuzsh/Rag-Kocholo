        "text": "French novelist and 1985 Nobel Literature Prize winner Claude Simon, who died Wednesday at the age of 91, has been buried in Paris.\n\nKnown as a pioneer of the \"new novel\" writing style, Mr. Simon penned works that were devoid of punctuation, plot and character development. His works were filled with interior monologues as well as characters in a state of emotional turmoil.\n\nMr. Simon was born in Madagascar to French parents in 1913. He was captured by the Germans while fighting in World War II but managed to escape and join the French Resistance. His first novel was completed during the war.\n\nMr. Simon authored 21 books including Le Tricheur, Le Vent and La Route des Flandres. His final novel, Le Tramway was published in 2001.\n\nSome information for this report provided by AP and AFP."
