Claude Simon, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1985 and a major nouveau roman writer, died at 91 last Wednesday. Not exactly a household name in the U.S., Simon rejected traditional literary forms; in one book, par exemple, a sentence meanders along for 30 pages. His best-known work is The Flanders Road, one of several of his oeuvre dealing with the defeat of France in 1940, which he experienced firsthand as a cavalryman.
