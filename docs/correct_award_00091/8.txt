French novelist and Nobel laureate Claude Simon (1913–2005) is known for his innovative narrative techniques, often defying traditional structures with a fragmented, non-linear approach that mirrors human perception and memory.

He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1985 for his “novels which, with linguistic ingenuity, reveal the absurdity of the human condition in the face of the senselessness of history.” His innovative narrative techniques and profound exploration of themes such as memory, war, and identity were recognized as significant contributions to literature.
