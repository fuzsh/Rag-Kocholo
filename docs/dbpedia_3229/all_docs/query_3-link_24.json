But this individual is, for whatever reason, trying to ban me from a small sport'\n\nGet the latest from Adrian Humphreys straight to your inbox\n\nArticle content\n\nRob Maisey and Nathan St. Germain love the same strange thing: underwater hockey, a niche sport true to its unvarnished name. For years the two men shuffled a puck along the bottom of a pool, instead of on ice, with the same team in the Vancouver suburb of Coquitlam.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nStrange, unsung sport of underwater hockey gets an unlikely spotlight — in court Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nA year ago, as the core of a defensive back line for the Rumblefish, they joined the nine-member team on a trip to Costa Mesa, Calif., for the 2021 Underwater Hockey Pacific Coast Championships. Results in the pool spun from a 7-0 rout by Sebastopol Sharks to a 6-0 win over San Diego Mixed, but on land the Rumblefish shined — hotel beers, waterfront dinner, closing night pizza party.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

It’s a very unfortunate situation.”\n\nSt. Germain, on the other side of the docket, calls it “a gong show.”\n\n“I’m in my 40s, he’s in his 50s and I have no idea why we’re going through this,” St. Germain says.\n\nIt’s an acrimonious case over a sport most don’t know exists.\n\nThe dispute at the B.C. Civil Resolution Tribunal is over $1,077.50 Maisey claims St. Germain owes him for expenses from the California tournament.\n\nIt gets treated like a joke sport but the people who play it, play it quite seriously\n\nBoth men sound suspicious when called by a reporter about their beer-league court case. Ask about underwater hockey, though, and both speak like disciples of a loved thing that’s overlooked by most everyone else.\n\n“My dad actually played it in the 70s and 80s so I grew up with it and I started early, maybe when I was 18,” says the 41-year-old St. Germain.\n\n“Because it takes place underwater, you can’t really go and watch it, so it doesn’t get talked about,” says Maisey, 58, who also has played for decades. “It gets treated like a joke sport but the people who play it, play it quite seriously.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe game was invented in Britain in the 1950s as training for divers and was originally called octopush.\n\nTwo teams of six face-off in a swimming pool. Wearing masks, flippers, and snorkels, players use short, curved sticks in a battle to push a lead puck across the bottom of the pool and into the other’s goal. The water creates an intense and disorienting three-dimensional field. Teamwork and timing are key — players must get the puck to a teammate before running out of breath and surfacing for air.\n\nIt’s a wild melange of hockey, snorkeling, and shuffleboard.\n\nInterest slowly spread. When cheap underwater video cameras came along, people could finally see it was real and the internet breathed life into the sport’s outreach. The first Underwater Hockey World Championships was held in Vancouver in 1980.\n\n“It’s an incredible cardio sport that is good for all ages and all sizes and builds. Being underwater is a great equalizer of gender, size and age,” says Maisey.\n\nThe Rumblefish have a practiced system for team finance.\n\nThe tribunal heard details from five members. One teammate is appointed “Major Money” and oversees the cost sharing. The Major collects all receipts for shared expenses and enters them into a spreadsheet, along with who paid them, and then calculates how much each member owes or is owed to even it out. All members agreed to the system, court heard.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMaisey paid some of St. Germain’s expenses upfront, as did three other teammates, the tribunal heard; Maisey subsequently paid the shortfall owed to the others, taking on the whole of St. Germain’s debt. There was $218.72 in tournament fees; $12.03 for a cab ride; $584.53 for three nights at a hotel; $42.90 for food and alcohol at the hotel; $10.35 for pizza at the wrap party; $135.93 for a team dinner.\n\nWhen they returned from California, St. Germain was told he owes more than a thousand dollars but didn’t pay it.\n\n“It’s a good system but it’s based on trust,” says Maisey. “And if someone says, ‘no I’m not going to pay,’ you’re kind of stuck. OK, now what? He kind of dug his heels in.”\n\nMonths passed. St. Germain says he disputes some of the amounts and tried to discuss them, but Maisey made it personal.\n\n“I fully admit there are things that I owe, and I’ll pay that. But this individual is, for whatever reason, trying to ban me from a small sport. I haven’t been able to play. He refused to let me in the water,” says St. Germain. “That’s why we are where we are.”\n\nMaisey says St. Germain was kicked out for refusing to pay his share.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“He was still playing with us for a bit. Eventually he was told that if you’re not paying your bills, you can’t keep playing,” Maisey says. The last time St. Germain was at the pool as a Rumblefish was April 28. He turned up to play despite the warning. It led to a confrontation and a police report but no charges.\n\nTribunal adjudicator David Jiang found evidence weighed mostly in Maisey’s favour. Maisey had supporting documents and statements from other team members. St. Germain complains the tribunal ignored his evidence because he had difficulty uploading it in the right format.\n\nOf the $1,077.50 claimed by Maisey, St. Germain was ordered to pay $1,004.46. With interest and tribunal fees, the judgement against him is $1,137.52.\n\nNeither expects this to be the end.\n\n“The court has settled he owes us this amount. We are still a long way from getting the money,” says Maisey.\n\n“I think it’s terrible. I’m planning on fighting it,” St. Germain says of the decision.\n\nThat would require an appeal to the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\n\nUnderwater hockey may finally get its spotlight.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | Twitter: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
