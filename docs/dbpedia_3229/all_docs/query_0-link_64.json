        "text": "Colorado is a huge hub for hockey players and fans, whether on ice, on the field or even underwater. And why not? If it’s a sport, we have it here.\n\nTen women under age 24 are set to represent the U.S. at the Underwater Hockey Age Group World Championship in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia this July and of course, three are Coloradans.\n\nElsa Debrunner, Lillianna Brooks and Aria Paul will compete in the event between July 16 and July 27 against about a dozen teams from around the globe. The U.S. is sending three teams spanning three divisions to the upcoming world championship: U24 men, U24 women and U19 men. Debrunner, Brooks and Paul are on the USA U24 Women’s Team.\n\n“Training for worlds is a big commitment, but training with Lillianna and Aria is super encouraging and makes me super excited to play more hockey,” said Debrunner, a Conifer High School alum and club athlete at the Colorado School of Mines.\n\nWhat is underwater hockey?\n\nIt’s a non-contact snorkeling sport with two teams of six facing off at the bottom of the pool. A weighted puck can be pushed, slid or flicked with a short stick into the goal. Equipment includes a mask, fins, a snorkel with a mouthguard, a glove, a water polo cap and a stick.\n\nTeammates rotate dives for roughly five-to-20 seconds in a fast-paced, three-dimensional sport that combines the back-and-forth motion of regular hockey with up-and-down movements to return up for air between dives.\n\n“It’s physically different than any other sport,” Debrunner said. “But once you learn that, the communication with your team is probably the hardest part. You have to have a strategy really dialed in ahead of time because it’s difficult to communicate during the match.”\n\nIt requires elite breath control, fitness and strong cooperation between coaches and teammates, Debrunner said. But the coaches believe the team is ready for a strong showing in Malaysia.\n\n“We’re really impressed with the progress made since the team candidates first got together. The commitment towards training and implementation of the game plan started at a high level and has seemed to grow,” Coach Kendall Banks said in a release. “Through their support of each other combined with healthy competition, there seems to be a synergy or ‘magic’ here. We’re excited to see where it takes the team.”\n\nColorado connections\n\nDebrunner and Brooks are from Colorado originally, and Paul is from San Francisco but attends Colorado State University with Brooks. Brooks got into underwater hockey about three years ago, she said.\n\nAs a former swimmer for St. Mary’s Academy in Cherry Hills Village, she had the tools to be a strong underwater hockey player. But she didn’t know what to make of the sport at first.\n\n“I saw a poster one day for a pool in Thornton and it was like, ‘underwater hockey,’ and I was really committed to swimming at that point so I was like, ‘That’s weird. I don’t know,’” Brooks said.\n\nBut later as a student at Colorado State, Brooks was strolling the quad and saw booths for clubs. One was serendipitously for underwater hockey.\n\n“This girl, who was actually Elsa’s older sister (Ianna Debrunner), was like, ‘Hey! Do you want to play underwater hockey?’” Brooks said. “You know what? Maybe I do.”\n\nSince plunging into underwater hockey, Brooks has had tunnel vision for a spot on the U.S. team. But it’s a stop on her way to a bigger goal: being chosen on the USA Women’s Elite Team, which is a collection of the best players regardless of age.\n\nStill, representing her country competitively is a dream come true. The team will battle against “10 to 12” other national teams, including Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and others.\n\nA collection of women from all over the country, the national team met in January at a tournament in Colorado for the first time. They also had a training camp in Lake Tahoe in California for a week earlier this year.\n\nBut Brooks, Debrunner and Paul have an advantage being able to train together at Carmody Recreation Center in Lakewood and Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center in Thornton. They’ll stay on their grind until it’s time to travel overseas for global glory.\n\nHow to follow the team\n\nThe championships in Malaysia will be livestreamed with commentators on YouTube.
