It's a great game for fitness and building lung capacity. Main reason I stopped playing was chronic wrist pain - even though it's a \"non-contact\" sport, wrists take a bit of a beating when tackling.\n\nIt certainly will improve snorkeling skills. As for diving, I don't think it'll necessarily improve skills per se, but it will absolutely build confidence in the water.\n\nsquidawn\n\nNew\n\nMessages\n\n4\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nLocation\n\nUSA\n\n# of dives\n\n0 - 24\n\nJul 13, 2021\n\n#5\n\nYes played 'Underwater hockey' in the past, called 'Octopush' for years, Navy dive teams played it against other Navies ,\n\nWe played Singapore, Indonesia and the Royal Navy in Singapore in the 80s.\n\nVery hard game, we also played water polo [ it was hard on the horses though ].\n\nAwesome. Did you ever play with those old 2- or 3-foot long sticks, or those sticks that are straight with a U shape on the front? It's definitely a good workout, I think it's very fun. I've never tried water polo. Or land polo!\n\na \"non-contact\" sport\n\nEvery team has that one guy who's totally focused on the puck and kicks people left right and center. But even when everyone's being careful you can get some good bruises.\n\nTripp\n\nAquanaut Naturalist\n\nMessages\n\n442\n\nReaction score\n\n288\n\nLocation\n\nSan Antonio, Texas & Marco Island, Florida\n\n# of dives\n\nI'm a Fish!\n\nJul 20, 2021\n\n#6\n\nWelcome to ScubaBoard and congratulations on bringing up an underwater topic that I've never heard of before, nor seen discussed on SB!!\n\nGandalf-the-Diver\n\nContributor\n\nMessages\n\n480\n\nReaction score\n\n495\n\nLocation\n\nVictoria, B.C., Canada\n\n# of dives\n\n200 - 499\n\nJul 26, 2021\n\n#7\n\nHello!
