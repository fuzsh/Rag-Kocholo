        "text": "About 2023 Pacific Coast Underwater Hockey Championships\n\nLittle history about Underwater Hockey (sometimes called Octopus) was invented in the 1950s by the British Navy in order to keep their divers in shape and to improve their efficiency under water. It then became popularized in Australia before expanding across the world. The sport intertwines disciplines from both ice hockey and swimming in creating a competitive and fairly physical battle.\n\nRules of Underwater Hockey\n\nTeams consist of 10 players with 6 players in the pool at all times. The remaining 4 act as rolling substitutes.\n\nGames take place for two 15-minute halves with a 5-minute rest period in between halves.\n\nPlayers generally cover zones rather than having positions, but formations do come into play.\n\nTeams can also be split into attack and defense. Variations of midfield players have also been noted before.\n\nPlayers can only score using the stick in their hands and cannot use any body parts to assist moving the puck. Players are prohibited from making contact with players unless they are in possession of the puck."
