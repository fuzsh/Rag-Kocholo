        "text": "Underwater Hockey - Sink and Swim\n\nUnderwater Hockey is a fast moving, all-gender, non-contact team sport. Involving six players a side, and four substitutes, it is played with a small stick, mask, snorkel and fins. Players seek to advance, flick and pass a weighted puck along the court with the aim of scoring in each others goal trays.\n\nGame strategy is simular to many other team sports, such as soccer or field hockey, except for the 3rd dimension of playing underwater. An excellent sport for all ages & abilities - and a great way to get fit in a supportive, social environment.\n\nAbout Us\n\nWe are an ACT based local sports club with a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Our focus is on having fun, while developing skills and fitness.\n\nUnderwater hockey can be enjoyed by people of all ages, genders, fitness levels and swimming experience.
