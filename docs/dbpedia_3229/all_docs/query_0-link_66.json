        "text": "Welcome to Orlando Underwater Hockey\n\nOkay, all you swimmers, divers, water polo players and aquatics enthusiasts come and join us for underwater hockey at the Rosen Aquatic Center on I-Drive Orlando (407 996 3444) We play Mondays and Wednesdays nights at 7:00PM. It is free to play. The team is co-ed, and no experience is necessary.\n\nNobody grows up learning how to play underwater hockey. We will teach you. If you can swim down to the bottom of the pool (7 feet), you can learn to play. Don’t worry about the equipment; we have loaner gear.\n\nIf you have a mask, snorkel, and fins, bring them; no problem if you don’t; we will provide them as well as sticks, gloves, caps, and instruction. Don’t use the excuse; “I will try it when I get in shape”. Learning to play is the only way to get in shape for underwater hockey. Always check our facebook page for any cancellations of practice before you come (The Rosen Aquatic Center sometimes hosts large competitions that preclude regular programing at the facility). Click here for current updates.\n\nClick Here for latest practice updates and possible cancellations this takes you to our facebook page which is current.\n\nA brief history of underwater hockey\n\nUnderwater hockey (UWH) was originally known as “octopush,” the game was invented in Great Britain in 1954 to keep dive club members active during the winter. Many modifications occurred over the decades, developing underwater hockey, a sport recognized by the International Olympic Committee and governed by the World Underwater Federation (CMAS).\n\nUnderwater hockey is an international sport, with over 36 countries having fielded teams in the world championships since 1980. UWH World Championships occur every two to four years and have Men’s and Women’s divisions and Master’s (35 and above) Junior divisions (19u and 23 and under). Underwater hockey was introduced to the United States in 1970, and there are now 60 club teams. In addition, annual USA national championships have occurred for over four decades.\n\nOrlando Underwater Hockey was founded on January 7th, 2011, at the now Rosen Aquatic Center through the efforts of Ariel Czesler and Lucky Meisenheimer. Since that time, the team has grown rapidly in recognition within the sport. Our team won two state championships in 2019 and 2021. We sent teams to National Championships with a fifth-place finish at nationals in 2019. We have had three players selected for our National team who represented the USA in the world championships held in Spain. Our club has hosted multiple tournaments in the past, including Nationals, Regionals, State championships, potlucks, and the annual Doc Lucky Invitational. We are perhaps best known for welcoming and developing new players for the sport."
