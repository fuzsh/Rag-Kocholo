The constant swimming\n\nunderwater (more resistance) will improve your cardio as well as your stamina.\n\nYou will also strengthen your core muscles, like your abs and back playing this\n\ngame. This game is also very fun and unique, we guarantee it is unlike\n\nanything you will ever experience!\n\n2. Lower Risk of Injury\n\nUnderwater Hockey is a non-contact sport played underwater and there is a big\n\nreduction in the amount of strain that your body is subjected to, versus land-based\n\nor water-based contact sports. For this reason, we have several players who started\n\nUnderwater Hockey because they had to give up their land-based sport due to\n\ninjuries.\n\n3.Improve your Mental Game\n\nUnderwater Hockey incorporates mental discipline alongside breath tr aining.\n\nExperienced Underwater Hockey players are known for their mental strengt h and\n\nmastery over their ability to activate their ‘mammali an diving reflex’.\n\nThis achievement of a ‘relaxed state’ whil e being physically active, decr eases\n\noxygen consumption through a conscious effort to reduce heart rate, making you\n\nmore efficient underwater.\n\n4.Great Sense of Community\n\nThe best thing about Underwater Hockey is the sense of community. No matter\n\nwhere you play and at whatever experience or level, you will makes heaps of\n\nfriends and have a whole lot of fun, in and out of the water.\n\n2.5.
