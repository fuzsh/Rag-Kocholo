        "text": "Serious or just for fun – there's a team for you\n\nMost of us started playing underwater hockey for fun. Everyone plays on the same evening, regardless of grade, so the social side of the sport is terrific.\n\nIt's easy to get hooked though. If you have a competitive streak you'll find underwater hockey to be among the most tactical and demanding of sports.\n\nEither way, you’ll find that your fitness level goes through the roof. Your water skills will improve too – you’ll be more comfortable in the pool or the ocean than ever before.\n\nTwo teams of six players face off from opposite ends of the court, holding on to the pool wall. When the buzzer sounds it's a race to the puck, which has been placed in the centre of the court on the pool bottom. The player who gets there first takes control of the game (at least momentarily). Through speed, cunning and skill it's then a matter of outmanoeuvring the opposition to get the puck into your opponent’s goal.\n\nGood teamwork is crucial. You need to be in the right place at the right time, carefully work out when to dive and when to come up for air and be ready to sprint when someone gets a lucky break.\n\nWhen a goal is scored, each team returns to their respective end of the court ready for another swim-off.\n\nThe game is played in two 15-minute halves, with a short break in the middle, and it’s carefully controlled by in-water referees. When they need to stop play they sound an underwater buzzer.\n\nTeams are mixed – even at the top level – although there are separate men's and women's teams at national and world competitions.\n\nUnderwater hockey is fast, lung-busting fun that gives your tactical brain a real workout too."
