        "text": "If you live in the Evansville, Indiana area, you know that we have a hockey team that plays at the Ford Center. But if you replace skates with fins, shorten the stick, and add a snorkel you have a sport that is still fairly new to Evansville - Underwater Hockey.\n\nEvansville Penguins Underwater Hockey\n\nThe Evansville Penguins Underwater Hockey Club was introduced less than a year ago, and interest in the sport is growing. We are very fortunate to have the Deaconess Aquatic Center to host the sport. The club is welcome to anyone aged 14 and up.\n\nBasic Skills of Underwater Hockey\n\nThis video shows some of the techniques used in underwater hockey. It certainly looks like a full-body workout. Unlike traditional hockey, this is a no-contact sport. It is really about teamwork since you can only hold your breath for a little bit at a time.\n\nUnderwater Hockey has been around since the 1950s. Here is a snapshot of what the sport entails:\n\nThis limited-contact sport involves two teams of six competing to move a three-pound puck across the bottom of a pool into the opposing team's goal. Wearing snorkeling and other gear specifically designed for underwater hockey, players hold their breath and submerge briefly to the pool bottom to move the puck or support their team. This growing amateur sport focuses on teamwork and collaboration. Underwater hockey is a fun, challenging, team-bonding activity that improves fitness while being low-impact on the body.\n\nReady to see What Underwater Hockey is all About?\n\nBeginners are welcome at any practice. Visit Info for Beginners to learn more and email uwhevv@gmail.com to RSVP. Include your shoe size (if you'll need fins) and whether you're left or right-handed. Arrive for your first practice at 7:15 pm so you can get fitted with gear and review some initial information.\n\nLuxurious Eight Bedroom Illinois Home For Sale Has an Indoor Swimming Pool\n\nGallery Credit: Coldwell Banker Realty"
