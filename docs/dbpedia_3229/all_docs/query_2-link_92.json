        "text": "Video Library\n\n​SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR UNDERWATER HOCKEY\n\nThe Underwater Hockey Committee of the Underwater Society of America (USOA) has adopted the following Safety Guidelines for participants in USOA sanctioned underwater hockey activities. While no sporting activity is without risk, the USOA feels these Safety Guidelines will minimize what little risk exists in underwater hockey training or competition.\n\nUnderwater Hockey is a snorkeling sport played in a hard-bottomed pool with depths of up to 12 feet. Players wear masks, fins, and snorkels, mouth and ear protection, and a protective glove on the playing hand. Short sticks are used to push and pass a 3-pound puck along the pool bottom into the opponents goal. Players must dive down to play the puck and work in close coordination with their teammates to advance the puck or defend a goal.\n\nBecause the play occurs on the bottom of the pool, players must use controlled breathing and dive underwater for short periods of time while in play. Extended underwater breath holding can increase the risk of unconsciousness. USOA realizes that the risk of such an occurrence is extremely low due to the inherent nature of the game. However, the organization requires that all underwater hockey players read, understand, and agree to follow these guidelines:\n\n1) Hyperventilation is not allowed prior to or during underwater hockey activities.\n\nHyperventilation is the act of breathing deeper and/or faster than needed to sustain a normal level of oxygen saturation in the body. Hyperventilation is used while a person is at rest in an attempt to purge carbon dioxide (CO2) from the body prior to a an athletic activity. Heavy breathing after a cardiovascular workout in order to ‘catch your breath’, such as happens in any sport, is not considered hyperventilation because the function is to increase the level of oxygen rather than an attempt to purge CO2 to below normal levels.\n\n2) Extensive and long duration breath-holding is neither allowed nor necessary for playing or training for underwater hockey.\n\nExtensive breath-holding for a long period of time and/or to deep depths is a potentially dangerous activity and is not a usual, useful, or productive activity in underwater hockey. Rarely do players stay submerged for more than 15 seconds - even at the highest levels of play. Unlike competition breath-hold sports where the participants’ goals are to stay underwater the longest or go the farthest on one breath, underwater hockey requires multiple shallow and short dives and quick up- and-down cycling to produce a higher oxygen level and provide for fast swimming, quick turns, team coordination, and skillful puck handling. Under no circumstances should players try to stay submerged for long periods of time or distances, even in training.\n\n3) Underwater Hockey activities in a pool, including controlled breathing exercises and swims, shall occur in the direct supervision of others.\n\nEven though serious injury or unconsciousness is an extremely low risk factor in underwater hockey, like any sport things can happen where a player needs assistance. A capable observer or buddy system shall always be used. Groups of 4 or more players may play underwater hockey without a direct supervisor (the other hockey players are the observers) while groups of three or fewer shall use a non-participating observer charged only with watching the underwater hockey players. A rotating buddy system ensures that one player is fully able to view or assist the others. Do not practice any type of underwater exercises alone - even with a lifeguard present!\n\n4) Underwater hockey players shall always be aware that the possibility of an injured player exists and be vigilant about scanning the entire pool for injured or unconscious players.\n\nThe sport of underwater hockey is fortunate in that its use of masks and snorkels allows in-water players or referees to have a good view of the pool and other players. If a player were to be injured another player or referee would quickly observe the injured player and be able to provide immediate assistance. Constant surveillance and awareness of the playing field by players, substitutes, and referees keeps our sport safe. All participants shall constantly monitor the pool and act to aid a swimmer if any sign of help is needed.\n\n5) Underwater hockey players shall never remain motionless in the water.\n\nBecause the most noticeable sign of unconsciousness is lying still, USOA Underwater Hockey requires participants to keep moving so that others know you are not unconscious, while on the bottom or floating on the surface. While a lack of motion in itself is not specifically dangerous, it lowers the alertness of those who might respond to a true accident. Always make movements to be sure that people know that you are OK.\n\n6) All underwater hockey players are required to wear a dual lens design mask, protective ear guards, mouth guards, and hand protection on the playing hand, when playing underwater hockey.\n\nAlthough the rules of underwater hockey dictate that is it a non-contact sport, incidental contact may occur. Injuries may occur from a wayward stick, a puck, a swim stroke, or an unfortunate fin kick. Wearing of dual lens design masks greatly reduces the chances of lens breakages. While USOA Underwater Hockey realizes these incidents may occur infrequently, safety is our highest priority. Wearing this protective equipment greatly limits the risk of injury.\n\n7) All injuries requiring medical attention and resulting from underwater hockey activities shall be reported to a local underwater hockey organization representative and to the USOA Underwater Hockey National Safety Director.\n\nUSOA Underwater Hockey strives to attain the safest environment feasible. To identify potential sources of injury, a record of underwater hockey-related injuries is required. As part of the underwater hockey community, responsibility for injury reports lies with the persons at the site of an incident, and especially the injured player. Injury report forms are available from your local club or at www.usauwh.com.\n\n8) Underwater hockey players shall read, understand, and sign an understanding of these Safety Guidelines at least annually.\n\nThese guidelines shall be presented to any new players prior to participation.\n\nI hereby attest that I have read and understand the information provided to me regarding the USOA Underwater Safety Guidelines for participating in underwater hockey activities, including the potential hazards associated with the sport, and necessary precautions to prevent injury, including unconsciousness. In addition, I agree to follow all local aquatic facility rules."
