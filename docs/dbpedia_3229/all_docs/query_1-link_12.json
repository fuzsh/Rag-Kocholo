        "text": "FREEDIVE!\n\nby Terry Maas and David Sipperly\n\nUnderwater Hockey\n\nIf you love the water, enjoy team play and are looking for a way to stay in excellent shape, then underwater hockey is your sport.\n\nOriginally played by freedivers to stay in shape during the winter months, underwater hockey has developed into a highly organized and competitive sport over the last 15 years. This lively sport enjoys national and international recognition. To help us explain the basics, we've interviewed Kendall Banks and Tim Burke, two nationally recognized competitors with world championship experience. Tim was the 1996 Underwater Society of America's Underwater Hockey Athlete of the year. Kendall has served as National Underwater Hockey Director for the Underwater Society of America and has represented the United States eight times on the national team in world play; his teammates have elected him captain seven times.\n\nUnderwater hockey is loads of fun, but be forewarned: this is one tough sport. It's like running up and down a flight of stairs on a single breath, breathing again at the bottom of the stairs and then repeating this cycle for fifteen minutes. It is a high intensity, anaerobic sport that requires excellent physical fitness. \"Although long breath-holds are helpful, they are not critical to success,\" Tim stresses. \"It is more important to couple short, effective breath-hold times-enough to complete each play-with short surface intervals.\"\n\nIn underwater hockey, two teams of six, wearing only masks, fins and snorkels, compete in a swimming pool. Their objective is to drive the puck with short hockey sticks into their opponent's goal. \"It is similar to ice hockey, where speed, puck control, passing and awareness of others is critical,\" says Tim. \"Yet it is played on the bottom of a swimming pool while you hold your breath.\".............\n\nThe rules are simple: no standing on the pool bottom or blatant fouling (holding or grabbing another). Although incidental contact does occur, underwater hockey is still considered a non-contact sport. Are there any risks? Sureblackout from over-exertion, broken noses and teeth from puck-passing and ruptured eardrums from fin slaps are possible, but rare; and, in most cases, preventable with the use of proper gear. The most common injuries are bruises and cuts on the knees and knuckles caused by striking the pool bottom or being hit by sticks and pucks.\n\nThe gear required to play underwater hockey is minimal. All you need are mask, fins, snorkel, a glove, hockey stick, head and ear protection, a mouth guard and a good roll of duct-tape, says Kendall. You can purchase most of the special gear from the Underwater Society of America (USofA). Use duct-tape for field repairs or for securing fins to your feet............"
