        "text": "Underwater hockey is a real sport and it's lots of fun to play.\n\nIt's a bit like ice hockey but the puck lies on the bottom of the pool. You and your team mates swim underwater and pass it to each other with your hockey stick in order to score a goal. You come up for a breath whenever you need to!\n\nUnderwater hockey originated in England in 1954 as a game called \"Octopush\" and was created to keep divers fit during the off season. It spread to South Africa in the late 1950s, Canada in 1962, Australia in 1966 with the first Australian UWH competition in 1975 in WA.\n\nMost people have never heard of Underwater Hockey and don't even believe it exists. If you are into the unusual, if you love the extraordinary, this could be the sport for you.\n\nHere are some of the things that make Underwater Hockey the world's most exceptional sport:\n\nTeam spirit - you can only hold your breath for so long. So, you absolutely rely on your team mates and no-one can be a puck-hog.\n\nAll over fitness - you'll build up both aerobic and anaerobic fitness. It's a great work out for all of your body - arms, legs and core - though you won't even notice getting fitter.\n\nFun - humans trying to do things in an environment they are not built for is inherently amusing.\n\nChallenging - humans trying to do things in an environment they are not built for is inherently difficult.\n\nWeightless - that wonderful feeling of being suspended in water makes you feel so free.\n\nSilent - this might be the only team sport in the world that you can't talk to your team mates or hear spectators during play. (It's not much of a spectator sport).\n\nSounds fascinating? It is. Come along and embrace the exceptional!"
