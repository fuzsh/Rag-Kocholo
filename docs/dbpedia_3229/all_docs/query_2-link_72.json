The aim is to manoeuvre a lead puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into the opposing team's goal by propelling it with a hockey stick. There are 10 players on each team, with rolling subs so only 6 players are playing at any one time.\n\nThe game starts with the puck on the bottom of the pool between the two teams. Then once play starts teams are free to swim anywhere in the play area. Scoring happens when the puck enters one of the teams goals, which are made from metal and span about half the width of the playing area.\n\nOur club is a member of the British Octopush Association (BOA) which is the governing body for underwater hockey in the UK - Their website is - https://www.gbuwh.co.uk\n\nWhy is it Great Exercise?\n\nMost sports let you breath while you are playing. However in underwater hockey you need to hold your breath when diving down for the puck. While some people hold their breath for ages the real skill is knowing when to dive. You can then quickly tackle an opponent, pass the puck then resurface for a quick breath of air.\n\nDo you do anything social?\n\nAbsolutely! After training we usually head off down to the pub.\n\nHow did it start?\n\nUnderwater Hockey started in the United Kingdom in the fifties, bored divers wanted something do something over the winter. Originally the teams had 8 players (hence Octopush) but this has now reduced to 6 a side.\n\nFrom it's small beginnings many teams have formed in the UK and around the world, from New Zealand to Canada.\n\nYou can find out more about the history of the sport on the CMAS site\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nYou can have a look at the complete rules here.\n\nAre there Competitions?\n\nOf course! We compete in the Nautlius tournament and have also taken part in Valentines, Big Blue at Plymouth, Barbipush, Totton Mix and Match and Ladies Nationals. There are also international tournaments which some of the team have taken part in, including Parmacup in Italy and the Berlin Open in Germany.\n\nWho are you? How did you start?\n\nIslington Octopush (Underwater Hockey) Club started out over 40 years ago as a BSAC (British Sub-Aqua Club) Octopush team. We are now independent members of the British Octopush Association (BOA), but still have links with several diving clubs and many of our players continue to dive."
