        "text": "After traveling for a few months around South America, I needed to do something for my aching body. However, I became disenchanted when all I found were the outdoor concrete weights and the indoor gyms.\n\nBut then I found my little piece of heaven: El Estadio; the best place for swimming in Medellin.\n\nLocation: “Estadio” Metro Station; between Calle 48 & 50 and Carrera 70 & 74\n\nI was taking the San Antonio Metro to my apartment when I spotted a massive outdoor pool, and then another and another and another. I believe there were 6 in total. They were beautiful and mesmerizing.\n\nThe next morning I walked to El Estadio and made my way to one of the larger pools where men, women and children were practicing. The pool was divided into sections, swimming and water sports:\n\nSuper beginners (ME!)\n\nAdvanced\n\nUnderwater hockey men and women – practice\n\nUnderwater hockey kids – practice\n\nUnderwater hockey games\n\nAnd that was only 1 pool. I introduced myself and they told me I can start whenever I am ready.\n\nFree Swimming\n\nEvery day from 9 AM to 3 PM\n\nYou must take a swimming test first!!\n\nCost for swimming lessons: 44,000 COP ($25) for one class a week/month, 7 – 8 PM Monday – Thursday (beginners)\n\nBecause I was not expecting to find a pool, I did not have the appropriate swimwear with me. Underneath the stadium is a little shop that sells Speedo’s at a very good price as well as goggles, caps, fins and everything else you may need for the water. The woman and her son behind the counter were extremely friendly and were excited to be helping me with my very poor Spanish skills.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nUnderwater Hockey\n\nUnderwater Hockey is a sport that is played at the bottom of a pool, between two teams with six players in the water. Each player takes a basic underwater equipment: Hat, fins, mask and snorkel. The goal is to move the disk of lead on the bottom of the pool using the “stick” to enter in the opposing goals.\n\nTraining Schedule\n\nMonday – Friday 6 – 8 PM 3 levels Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced\n\nMonday – Friday 8 – 10 PM Expert\n\nSaturday 10 – 12 PM Games are played\n\nYou can go to the stadium and watch because they have big windows underneath the water so you can see what the players are doing\n\nSynchronized Swimming\n\nMedellin is known amongst the locals for synchronized swimming. Girls start training between the ages of 6 and 10 and they continue training and competing into their early 20’s.\n\nFYI, I originally wanted to take synchronized swimming, but the trainers informed me that they do not have beginner classes for adults. However, they are willing to give private classes. So, if anyone is interested in synchronizing with me underwater, let me know!!\n\nWater Polo\n\nTraining Schedule\n\nMonday – Friday 8 – 10 AM and 6 – 8 PM"
