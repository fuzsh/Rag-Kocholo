        "text": "A WATER-BASED sport which combines the skills of hockey with the thrills of scuba diving is proving to be a big hit with Cardiff youngsters.\n\nThe popularity of Octopush at Maindy Swimming Pool has led to the introduction of an extra class to accommodate so many keen players.\n\nOctopush, also known as underwater hockey, involves two teams of ten competing over a puck called a ‘squid’ at the bottom of a swimming pool with the aid of snorkelling equipment.\n\nMaindy Pool introduced the sessions as a natural progression from the snorkelling activities offered as part of the Free Swimming Initiative.\n\nEquipment was purchased with a grant from the Welsh Assembly Government sponsored initiative, which is managed by the Sports Council for Wales.\n\nNearly twenty girls and boys aged between 8 and 16 years old now attend the classes every week but there is still room for more.\n\nDave Jackson, manager of Maindy and Splott swimming pools, said, “Octopush offers excitement not just for children but also for adults too.\n\n“Youngsters enjoy the fast pace of the game and it helps them to improve their confidence, develop their swimming and practice other skills in the water too.\n\n“Some members of the club are already showing great potential in the pool and we are working with Newport Octopush Club for adults to help develop this further.\n\n“We hope that they will go on to join the adult team when they are a bit older and be able to compete against other teams throughout the UK.”\n\nThe Octopush beginners’ class takes place at Maindy Swimming Pool every Sunday from 3.30pm until 4.30pm.\n\nA new advanced class takes place from 4.45pm to 5.30pm on Thursdays. For more information contact 029 2052 9230.\n\nThis is the eighth year that all 22 local authorities in Wales have operated the initiative and the figures show that each year more and more young people are going to their local leisure centre to enjoy a pastime which not only encourages them to be fit and healthy but is a potential life saver.\n\nThe Free Swimming Initiative is a Welsh Assembly Government initiative aimed at older people 60 years and over and children and young people 16 years and under.
