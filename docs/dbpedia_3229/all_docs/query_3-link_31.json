I agreed. I mean pretty much anything is more fun than swimming laps,\" Heslinga said.\n\nHeslinga was hooked.\n\nNow he and 20 fellow members practise twice a week at Peter Hemingway Pool and the Kinsmen Sports Centre where they're always game to take on newbies.\n\nAs for Adams, she believes the offbeat underwater sport has made her a better teacher and coach.\n\n\"I take a lot of what I learn as an athlete and I'm able to turn that around and try to give that wisdom to my kids.\""
