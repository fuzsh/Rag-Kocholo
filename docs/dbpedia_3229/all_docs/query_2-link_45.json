        "text": "RULES FOR PLAYING HOCKEY UNDERWATER\n\nThe non-contact sport of underwater hockey is a fast moving game which quickly develops your swim skills and builds your free diving capabilities because it is played on the bottom of a swimming pool.\n\nEven though the sport originated from America, underwater hockey was in fact invented by the British Navy in the 1950s.\n\nThey developed a variant of field hockey rules which is played while submerged underwater as a way to keep their divers fit and improve their movement in sub-aquatic activities.\n\nThe modern and dynamic version creates a competitive challenge for its participants who are mostly in Asian and South American countries including Columbia, Brazil, China, Japan, India, and Australia.\n\nUnderwater Hockey Regulations\n\nAim of the playing Underwater Hockey Game\n\nThe aim of underwater hockey is to hit the puck into your opponent’s goal.\n\nThe game is played below the surface with breaks in play allowed for a goal or a foul.\n\nPool Size\n\nThe swimming pool dimensions are usually around 25 meters long, 12 meters wide, and 2 meters deep.\n\nRopes or lead weights can be used as markings for a goal.\n\nUnderwater Octopush Equipment\n\nUnderwater hockey octopush equipment includes:\n\nThe stick (about 12 inches long made of painted wood).\n\nA swimming mask (not goggles).\n\nA snorkel tube.\n\nEar protectors.\n\nDiving fins.\n\nSwimsuit.\n\nGloves (latex for protection).\n\nPuck (weighing 3lb and made of plastic coated lead) .\n\nUnderwater Hockey Players\n\nAn underwater hockey team consists of 10 players from a squad of 12.\n\nEven though teams have formations, players generally cover zones rather than having positions.\n\nOnly 6 players may be submerged in the water at any one time and the positions are usually a combination of a center, wings, halfbacks, and a wingback.\n\nThe remaining 4 players act as interchanging rolling substitutes (similar to ice hockey substitution rules).\n\nOctopush Rules on Game Duration\n\nMost games play two 15 minute halves with a 5 minute rest period in between each half.\n\nEach team is allowed one 60 seconds time out per half.\n\nTypically, the match clock will stop for any infringements occurring in the final 2 minutes.\n\nGeneral Underwater Hockey Regulations\n\nPlayers pass the puck along the floor to team mates using their stick.\n\nYou may score using only the stick (not hands or any body parts to assist moving the puck).\n\nAll players are prohibited from making contact with anyone unless they are in possession of the puck.\n\nThe puck must not rest on the glove or be carried on top of the bat (or stopped deliberately by anything else).\n\nTop players can flick or sail the puck well over 3 meters through the water and often coming completely off the bottom of the pool.\n\nReferees and Officials\n\nRule infringements are judged by 2 in-water referees who signal to the out-of-water referee to stop play using a buzzer.\n\nReferees can award a free puck for fouls which gives a 3 meter advantage to the disadvantaged team.\n\nMatch officials may also eject players for 1 or 2 minutes (or remainder of the game) for serious offences.\n\nThe referee is permitted to award a penalty (2 on 1) or a direct penalty goal if a foul intervened a goal opportunity within 3 meters of the goal.\n\nWinning a Game of Underwater Hockey\n\nThe winning team is the one which scores the most goals at the end of the game.\n\nAn extra 15 minutes will be played to determine the winner if the game is a tie after the allotted time.\n\nScoring in Underwater Hockey\n\nScoring a goal means you managed hit the puck into the opponent’s goal area using your stick.\n\nALSO IN THIS SECTION\n\nA to Z Sports Rules and Regulations: A list of popular indoor and outdoor sport categories.\n\nField Hockey Rules: The basic regulations for playing sticks outdoor field hockey game.\n\nIce Hockey Rules UK: A fast contact sport played, and fought, between two teams on an ice rink.\n\nWeird Sports and Games: A concise list of weird and wonderful sports from all around the world.\n\nUnderwater Hockey Official Rule Book: [PDF Download Option]"
