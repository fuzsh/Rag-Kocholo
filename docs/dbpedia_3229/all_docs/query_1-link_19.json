        "text": "Underwater Hockey\n\nThis is one of Madison's most fun, exciting, energetic indoor sports. Bring mask, fins, snorkel, swim suit, towel and a glove to protect your hand. What better way to keep those fins wet off season than chasing a hockey puck around the bottom of the deep end of a swimming pool? All are welcome, no certification required. A small fee (about $6.00) is charged for pool rental but the first night is free.\n\nHockey Times and Dates are on the Calendar Page\n\nAll games take place at:\n\nMcFarland High School Swimming Pool\n\n5101 Farwell, McFarland\n\nTake highway 51 to McFarland, turn left at the stoplight (Farwell)\n\nGo down about three blocks and school is on the right.\n\nIf you need more details look up Danny at the meeting or give him call. (608-821-0048)\n\nOr mail for info at:\n\nuwhockey@fourlakesscubaclub.org\n\nDownload theUnderwater Hockey Schedule"
