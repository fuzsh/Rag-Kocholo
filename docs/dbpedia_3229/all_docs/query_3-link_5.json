        "text": "Underwater Hockey is a great sport for all ages, shapes and sizes\n\nBecause of the environment it is played (underwater), you do not have to be naturally athletic to be good at underwater hockey. Using a mask, snorkel and fins means you don’t even have to be a good swimmer!\n\nMost of us started playing underwater hockey for fun. Everyone plays on the same evening, regardless of proficiency, so the social side of the sport is terrific.\n\nIt's easy to get hooked though. If you have a competitive streak you'll find underwater hockey to be among the most tactical and demanding of sports.\n\nEither way, you’ll find that your fitness level goes through the roof. Your water skills will improve too – you’ll be more comfortable in the pool or the ocean than ever before.\n\nSPEEDISWIM x Underwater Hockey\n\nSPEEDISWIM has been integral to the development of Underwater Hockey in Singapore.\n\nHarking back to the early days of the sports’ development in Singapore, SPEEDISWIM’s founder (Philip Lee) was instrumental in bringing Stirling Underwater Hockey Club under the Singapore Underwater Federation (SUF) framework, when he held the position of Vice President (UW Sports) of the SUF.\n\nMore recently SPEEDISWIM partnership with SUHC extended to the sourcing of suitable pool venues for Singapore’s Elite Women's team preparation for the 2019 SEAGames campaign. This eventually led to the Women's team clean sweep of the 4x4 and 6x6 Gold Medals in Manila, Philippines.\n\nFill up the GET IN TOUCH Form below to find out more about SPEEDISWIM Underwater Hockey classes that we offer, and also other available services in different age groups."
