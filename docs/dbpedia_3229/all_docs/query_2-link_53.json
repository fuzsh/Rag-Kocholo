        "text": "Underwater hockey is an exhilarating 6 on 6 team sport played in a rectangular 25 by 15 metres court at the bottom of a 2 to 3 metres-deep pool. Yes, all the actions happen at the bottom of the pool and it is played without scuba gears! A goal is scored by pushing the puck into the trough of a goal tray sitting (you guessed it again) at the bottom of the pool at opponent’s end of the court.\n\nApart from the usual physical fitness demanded of any sport, this has an added anaerobic component to it. The athletes usually take a breath on the surface through the snorkel while keeping an eye on the developing plays below. So working as a team is crucial for this sport - teammates take turns to stay underwater to carry on the good work towards the goal or defend it vehemently. By the way, communicating with teammates is almost impossible.\n\nMastery of skills and techniques take on additional dimensions since athletes have to be able to snorkel, dive and swim with fins, apart from having to manoeuvre and flick the puck with a stick.\n\nAs though the above-mentioned aren’t challenging enough, underwater hockey is true 3D, like a dogfight, in that opponents can appear from all directions - left, right, top and sometimes, bottom (again) too."
