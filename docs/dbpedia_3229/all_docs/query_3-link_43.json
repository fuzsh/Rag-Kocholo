Refresh Sports brings a groundbreaking mini hockey experience to the beach, pool, backyard or floor! Includes two foam mini hockey sticks, two inflatable balls and a pump to inflate the balls. Our sticks can also be played indoors on the floor for a more traditional mini hockey experience!\n\n𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗛𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗚𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿 - Surprise your child with a fun and exciting take on mini hockey this year. Our floating mini hockey game will impress both boys and girls with its unique design, vibrant colors, and endless fun! Our sticks can be played indoors during the winter and outdoors on the water during the hot months, making it a great choice for stocking stuffers or gifts!\n\n𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗢𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗱 - Constructed from durable foam and plastic that is 3X more durable than the usual foam items you find on Amazon. Molded with state-of-the-art plastic and foam composite materials that were specifically formulated to withstand years of play in water and abuse in those street hockey games.\n\n𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗙𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝗕𝗹𝗮𝗱𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 - Since you'll mostly be playing with these in water, we've designed our hockey sticks with a hole on the blade of each stick. This allows water to pass through the blade while shooting, making it easier to maneuver the stick across the water!\n\n𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 - At Refresh, your satisfaction comes first, and we back that up with an open door of communication between the buyer and seller. If you have any questions or concerns, we are here to resolve them for you as soon as possible."
