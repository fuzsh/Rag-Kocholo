        "text": "Chico >> Battling buoyancy in a blizzard of bubbles, the veteran athletes pursue the puck with flippered frenzy.\n\nEmbattled in their usual weeknight game, co-ed members of the Chico underwater hockey club push their lungs and muscles to the limit in a friendly game of three-on-three, or more, depending on who shows. Always in need of new members, they encourage first-timers to try out their favorite sport but warn it’s easy to get immersed.\n\n“It’s like playing with a bunch of dolphins. I gotta have it,” said self-proclaimed “water baby” Maura Quinn-Briseno. “It’s magic. It makes you laugh and it’s great exercise.”\n\nShe helped bring underwater hockey to Chico in 1993, after reading about the sport in a magazine. Instantly intrigued by the concept of swimming with fins, snorkel and mask, propelling a puck on the bottom of a pool, she’s been addicted ever since.\n\n“I’ll play ’til I die,” said Quinn-Briseno, one of eight regulars who attend the Tuesday and Thursday night scrimmages at Shapiro Pool.\n\nMembers say the only similarity between underwater hockey and its dry-land namesake is they both use a puck and sticks. Scoring is similar to soccer and possession rules mimic basketball, with the only intentional contact between the stick and the puck.\n\nAfter a brief warmup on a recent night, the teams split to opposite sides of the pool. With a shout of “sticks up” or a simple “go,” players rushed to the center in a flurry of freestyle strokes and dolphin kicks.\n\n“You get the puck and you swim as fast as you can,” explained player Brad Smith. “If you can’t swim around everyone and swim through every obstacle in 20 seconds, you have to pass off.”\n\nTurnover is tremendous, as each team rallies to take possession of the 3-pound puck and snap it into the net. The water churns as players swivel and spin below the surface, periodically forced to come up for air.\n\nAfter spouting their airways clear, players dive back below, feet floating upward as arms and chests skim the pool floor. Their eyes dart left and right for someone to pass to, as the seconds strain by.\n\n“The ultimate aerobic exercise is chasing bubbles,” said Terry Decottignies, adding that underwater hockey is also “the cleanest workout you’ll ever have.”\n\nThey club plays for nearly 90 minutes during their twice-weekly get-togethers, but official games last a half hour or less. All in fun, they never track points, but when a goal glides into the net, whoever scored is quick to tap sticks with teammates in celebration.\n\nHad they been counting, the scores would likely be pretty high, said Smith, who has been playing for 15 years.\n\nWhen he first started, underwater hockey was a rougher sport, but as someone with four older brothers, he liked to rumble and loved the challenge. The game has since calmed but he hasn’t stopped, likely because of his love of being half under and half over the water.\n\n“It’s a 3D game that nothing can compare to,” he said.\n\nHis passion for the sport includes crafting the equipment. Out of maple, oak and sometimes birch, he carves sticks ranging from 8 to 13 inches long and varying in blade size and curvature to vary torque and strike power.\n\nThe net is 8 inches high and 72 inches long, built out of netting and plastic pipe. A 7-foot-deep pool with a flat bottom would be ideal, but they make do at Shapiro, playing in both the 4-foot shallows and 10-foot deep end.\n\nSmith admits his dream is for the proposed aquatic center to qualify for the ballot, to pass and to include a pool that’s prime for underwater hockey.\n\nAfter a day supervising swim sessions and recreational swim sessions, Tara Morgan, a lifeguard with Chico Area Recreation and Park District, watches each scrimmage from her chair with a smile on her face.\n\n“It’s been very fascinating so far,” she said. “It’s a lot of fun to guard for and everyone is really nice. It makes for a long day but I always look forward to it.”\n\nA longtime swimmer, Morgan has jumped in the pool to join in a few times when other guards could cover her shift. The veterans kindly taught her how to shoot the puck and breathe.\n\n“Learning to snorkel, it has a learning curve,” she said.\n\nA skilled player has great lung capacity, the ability to swim and snorkel, and strong body awareness, players said. Underwater hockey is a total-body workout.\n\n“You can eat anything you want when you play two times a week,” Quinn-Briseno said with a laugh.\n\nAs the sun starts to dip and practice nears its end, water splashes onto the pool deck with every play. Hugging the edge of the pool during a brief respite, Decottignies said he got his start 15 years ago when, as a bathtub refinisher, he spotted a pair of fins in a client’s tub, and he’s been pursuing the puck ever since.\n\n“You come alive in the aqua environment,” he said."
