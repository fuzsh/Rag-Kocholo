        "meta_description": "Did you know that Underwater Sports is a whole other group of competitive sports? While professional swimmers might be able to name most of these sports without a second thought, many of us would struggle to even name a few. Before we dive into (no pun intended) a few of the most unique underwater sports that you’ve probably not heard of, let’s learn a little about what underwater sports are!In a nutshell, if one or more underwater diving techniques are used, the sport is an underwater sport! What are underwater diving techniques? Some examples are snorkelling, scuba diving and breath-hold. Unlike some of the more popular Olympic swimming sports such as freestyle or synchronized swimming, underwater sports can happen indoors (swimming pools) and outdoors (open waters and lakes) as well! Some examples of underwater sports you might have heard of are freediving, finswimming and underwater football! Now, let’s jump into 6 of the more unique underwater sports that I’m sure you haven’t heard of.",

        "text": "While “aquathlon” also refers to the multisport race, don’t be confused by this underwater sport of the same name! The Aquathlon that this article is referring to is the one that involves wrestling underwater.\n\nNumber of competitors: Two. One from each team.\n\nAttire/equipment: Swimsuit, masks, fins, water polo cap and ankle bands.\n\nTo win: Remove the ribbon that is tied to the competitor’s ankle.\n\nCompetition Venue: In a swimming pool, inside a 5-metre square ring.\n\nDuration: 3 rounds made up of 30 seconds each. (Fourth round will be played in case a tie happens)\n\nYes, this IS a legitimate underwater sport! Initially categorized as a photographic film-based event prior to 1985, this sport is now governed and hosted by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS).\n\nNumber of competitors: 5 people in each team; consisting of 1 captain, 2 photographers and 2 photographers’ assistants.\n\nTo win: Get the best picture! The organizers will only view the first 100 pictures in the competitor’s memory card and further narrow it down for the judges to pick from.\n\nThemes: Select from “fish”, “wide angle (with diver)”, “wide angle (without diver)”, “close up (with theme)” and “close up (without theme)”!\n\nCompetition Venue: Open-water diving sites chosen by the host.\n\nDuration: Over 4 days, at least! The first day is set aside to get some practice in while the next 2 days are for the actual competition and the final day for the judges to call the shots. On the actual competition days, a maximum of 90 minutes is allowed per dive.\n\nUnderwater Target Shooting originated in France in the early 1980s and is being widely practiced in Europe as you read this!\n\nNumber of competitors: This sport has both individual and team events. Each of these events have slightly deferring rules!\n\nSpecial equipment: Weightbelt and a speargun.\n\nCompetition Venue: This underwater sport usually takes place in swimming pools of at least 25 x 10 meters.\n\nDuration: The “Precision” event takes a total of 5 minutes, “Biathlon” 2.5 to 3 minutes and “Team Relay” within 4.5 minutes!\n\nIf you’re an explorer who’s great with directions, you might be a pro at this!\n\nNumber of competitors: There are both individual and team events for this underwater sport as well!\n\nSpecial equipment: A map (which has a route marked by the competition organizers), a compass and counter meter (measures total distance covered) and a diving cylinder.\n\nTo win: Be the most efficient individual/team in navigating the underwater!\n\nCompetition Venue: Open waters such as freshwater lakes of at least 3 meters in depth.\n\nCourses: There are a few courses, namely the “M-Course”, “5-Point Course”, “Star competition” and “Parallel Race”! Above you can see the “Star competition”. Looks challenging, doesn’t it?!\n\nWhich shocked you the most and which sounds like an underwater sport you might be interested in? If you ask me, I’d choose Underwater Orienteering as it honestly looks pretty fun and the one that shocked me the most is definitely Underwater Ice Hockey. Playing a sport upside-down?! There was never a chance I’d think it actually existed beyond my wildest imagination. So, if regular swim meets are starting to bore you, why not explore the different types of underwater sports there are?"
