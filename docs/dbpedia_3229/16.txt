Underwater Hockey, or Octopush, as it is sometimes called, is a fast-paced, fun-filled sport for athletes of all ages. Unlike its on-ice counterpart, underwater hockey is a non-contact sport. While some jostling and bumping may occur, especially in competitive play, contact is generally not allowed, and focus is on fitness, teamwork and finesse. Underwater hockey is played in a swimming pool by two teams of up to 10 players each (6 active and 4 substitutes). The puck is made of lead, with a brightly-colored plastic coating. Players use a short stick to push, pull and pass the puck in an attempt to get it into the opposing teams' goal located at the end of the pool. Players wear fins, masks and snorkels (but no SCUBA tanks) and make repeated dives to the bottom of the pool where the play occurs. The intensity of the pace generally makes long dives impractical, so the most effective strategies generally involve short, explosive efforts, precision teamwork and timing, and rapid cycling of all 10 players through the 6 active positions. There are no goal-keepers or off-sides rules, and goals are often scored on exciting, break-away plays or well-timed 2-against-1 or 3-against-2 attacks.

We play each week on Friday from 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM. We have some extra gear if needed, so all you really need is a swimsuit. If you have your own mask and snorkel or fins, bring those along too, and bring a friend!

Gear is offered on a first come, first served basis. Your first 4 times there's no charge. After that, if you need to borrow gear there will be a $5 charge.

After your first month, we ask that you join the club. Dues are $50 annually.
