Underwater Hockey

This is one of Madison's most fun, exciting, energetic indoor sports. Bring mask, fins, snorkel, swim suit, towel and a glove to protect your hand. What better way to keep those fins wet off season than chasing a hockey puck around the bottom of the deep end of a swimming pool? All are welcome, no certification required. A small fee (about $6.00) is charged for pool rental but the first night is free.
