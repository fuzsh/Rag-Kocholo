        "text": "Minnesota Timberwolves star centre Al Jefferson is out indefinitely with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.\n\nThe team made the announcement Monday after practice. Coach Kevin McHale said Jefferson will likely have surgery to repair the injury in the next week to 10 days.\n\nJefferson hurt his knee when he landed awkwardly late in Sunday's 101-97 loss to New Orleans. He was examined Monday, when the ACL tear was discovered.\n\nJefferson is the team's leading scorer and rebounder at 23.1 points and 11 rebounds per game. He is one of only three players, along with Orlando's Dwight Howard and San Antonio's Tim Duncan, to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game this season.\n\n\"Al's played at such a high level for this team and been such a big part of our team,\" McHale said. \"Everybody around here today is a little bit down in the dumps.\"\n\nIt was devastating news for a young Timberwolves team that has been playing better in 2009 after getting off to a 4-23 start to the season. With Jefferson the focal point, the Wolves went 10-4 in January, and the 24-year-old centre was playing even better earlier this month.\n\nHe had 36 points and 22 rebounds in a loss at Houston on Saturday night and followed that up with 25 points and 14 boards before getting injured in the final 30 seconds against the Hornets on Sunday.\n\n\"I feel terrible for Al. Al's really, right now, devastated by it,\" McHale said. \"It all happens for a reason. It's hard for me to figure out what this reason is. Somehow he's just going to have to make the best of it and rehab and get better and move on from here.\""
