        "text": "The last time Al Jefferson was traded, the Celtics dealt the young big man to the Timberwolves for veteran superstar Kevin Garnett.\n\nNow, it’s Jefferson that is the highlight name of a major NBA trade.\n\nAccording to ESPN.com, the Utah Jazz have acquired Jefferson from Minnesota in exchange for two future first-round picks.\n\nJefferson’s contract will be slotted into the $14 million trade exception that Utah created earlier this week by signing and trading Carlos Boozer to the Chicago Bulls.\n\nJefferson inked a five-year, $65 million deal with the T-Wolves after being dealt by the Celtics — along with Sebastian Telfair, Ryan Gomes, Theo Ratliff, and Gerald Green — for Garnett.\n\nJefferson certainly fulfilled his star role in Minnesota, averaging 21 points and 11 rebounds per game in his first season. In 2008-2009, the 6-foot-10, 265-pound power forward averaged 23.1 points and 10.9 boards in 50 contests before going down with a knee injury.\n\nThe Jazz, who went 53-29 in the regular season, were swept in the Western Conference semifinals by the Lakers, who eventually went on to win it all. Boozer led the Jazz in points (19.5) and rebounds (11.2), and was a mainstay on Utah since coming over from Cleveland before the 2004-2005 campaign.\n\nJefferson, 25, is three years younger than Boozer and equally as productive on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. Utah shouldn’t lose a step in its annual playoff push."
