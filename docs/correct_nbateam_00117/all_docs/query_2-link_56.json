        "text": "Charlotte Bobcats center Al Jefferson will not cause any further damade to his plantar fascia injury by playing on the hurt foot, team doctors told reporters.\n\nMORE: Wolves' Adelman retires after 23 years coaching | Beverley suffers no further knee damage\n\nJefferson played on the injury in Game 1 of his team's first-round series against the Miami Heat, even after he said he heard something pop and immediately called timeout, removed his shoe and retired back to the locker room.\n\nJefferson returned, but was seriously limited. Before suffering the injury, Jefferson was 4-of-4 from the field for eight points, and he finished the game 9-of-17 in total.\n\nOriginal details of Jefferson's injury did not sound promising, as Bobcats coach Steve Clifford told reporters that \"something ripped\" with his plantar fascia.\n\nThat description worked in line with Jefferson's appearance. The big man labored down the court and left the arena in a walking boot. He continued to nurse the injury Monday. He did not practice with the team and continued to wear the boot."
