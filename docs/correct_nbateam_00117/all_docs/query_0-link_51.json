        "text": "Pacers at Bucks, 8 p.m. Wednesday, FSI\n\nINDIANAPOLIS - The Indiana Pacers didn't wait until midnight to drop the ball Sunday.\n\nBefore many fans had found their seats, the Minnesota Timberwolves led 17-0. The Pacers missed their first 12 shots and committed five turnovers before they finally scored. When Pacers center Domantas Sabonis ended the ugly spell with a baseline hook shot, the crowd at Bankers Life Fieldhouse let out a huge derisive cheer.\n\nDid the Pacers' starting lineup come straight from a New Year's Eve brunch to the arena? Did the unusual 5 p.m. tipoff discombobulate their body clocks?\n\nWho knows, but the Pacers' penchant for slow starts has become a major issue. They dropped their fourth straight game, 107-90, equaling their longest losing streak of the season. Backup Pacers guard Joe Young led them with a career-high 20 points, while Jimmy Butler led Minnesota with 26 points.\n\nFor the Pacers, this no way to ring in a new year. Many players left the locker room quickly, but Pacers veteran Al Jefferson delivered some straight talk after the game (eight points).\n\n\"I didn't expect that,\" said Jefferson. \"We hadn't been getting off to great starts, then come out today and gave them 17 points. That's tough for any team.\n\n\"We got to figure it out. We can't blame the coaches, can't blame the fans, can't blame nobody. We the ones out there. Just no effort, at all. That's something you just cannot have. You got to have effort out there. You miss every shot you shoot? That happens. But you got to play hard.\"\n\nâ–º BOX SCORE: Timberwolves 107, Pacers 90\n\nIn a season that has featured many highlights, the Pacers enter 2018 just one game above .500 (19-18), and things could get worse before they get better. Victor Oladipo missed his third straight game with a sore knee, did not sound much closer to returning. Pacers coach Nate McMillan said Saturday that Oladipo had not done any running or shooting with the team since the injury. McMillan said Oladipo would be re-evaluated this week, but it didn't sound promising that Oladipo would play in the Pacers' next game on Wednesday, when they visit Milwaukee.\n\nSparked by their bench Sunday, the Pacers fought back to within 10 points early in the second quarter. But in the third quarter, Minnesota (23-14) stretched its lead above 20 points, and many fans got an early start toward the exit.\n\nAll five Pacers starters played poorly Sunday - Darren Collison, Lance Stephenson Myles Turner, Thaddeus Young, and Bojan Bogdanovic. How bad were they? Nobody in the Pacers starting lineup scored until Collison hit a jumper just 4:47 before halftime, as McMillan benched the starters for much of the first half looking for a spark.\n\nHere are three takeaways from a troubling Pacers loss:\n\n1. McMillan may have little choice but to change the starting lineup, or seriously change substitution patterns.\n\nThis loss was embarrassing, the kind of loss that begs for action. Slow starts were a problem for the Pacers even before Oladipo's injury. But this game magnified the issue. Defense has been the main problem for the Pacers' starters, but in this game they looked tentative on offense from the start. Players looked as if they were thinking too much, trying to make perfect plays, instead of reacting instinctively. After the Pacers fell behind, there was too little passing and too much one-on-one play.\n\nMcMillan did not sound wed to making lineup changes after the game.\n\n\"Even with Victor in the lineup, we were getting off to slow starts,\" said McMillan. \"We're going to look at it. If we keep getting off to starts like that, we're going to have to put guys out there and give them an opportunity, similar to tonight.\"\n\nBefore Oladipo returns, McMillan could consider replacing one of the starters with Sabonis or Cory Joseph, or change his substitution patterns more drastically from game to game. During this losing streak, nobody has played consistently well, which is major problem. But that opens the door for McMillan to look at options, because what has transpired lately has not worked.\n\n2. The Pacers have lost their swagger.\n\nNot long ago, almost no deficit seemed insurmountable. They did not lose confidence when they fell behind. They always seemed to have an extra gear, and opponents had a difficult time putting them away, even when they jumped on the Pacers early. That has changed; during the third quarter on Sunday, you could sense the Pacers were deflated. Heads went down after bad plays. And frustration boiled over several times. Turner received a technical foul after it looked like he was hacked going to the basket, but no call was made. Stephenson received a fragrant foul for elbowing Karl-Anthony Towns in the throat. The Pacers' resiliency is going to be tested.\n\n\"We certainly look like we've lost a little confidence,\" said McMillan. \"We know we've better than what we've shown, really the past week or so.\"\n\n3. The Pacers' starters look like they have hit a physical wall.\n\nThe up-tempo playing style they prefer is difficult to sustain over an 82-game season. Right now, players who have logged heavy minutes all season look a half-step slow, and not as energetic. That's an issue, considering the 82-game season is not even halfway over. That is another reason McMillan may have to lean a little more on players who have fresh legs.\n\nFollow IndyStar sports writer Clifton Brown on Twitter @CliftonGBrown"
