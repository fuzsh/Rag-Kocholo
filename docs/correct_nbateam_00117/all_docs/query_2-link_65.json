        "text": "Mikal Bridges on Nets: 'We just couldn't figure it out'\n\nHis time at the top of the organizational totem pole, saddled with the requisite pressures and responsibilities, was brief and disappointing. Not only did his numbers suffer, but his Nets finished a dispiriting 32-50. In retrospect, Mikal Bridges acknowledged his leadership shortcomings. “It could’ve been better,” Bridges said on “Podcast P’ with Paul George” during Summer League this month. “But it’s different. I was close with everybody, we were all pretty close. We just couldn’t figure it out. I think that was the toughest situation. You want to lead and help other guys, but sometimes you got to look yourself in the mirror like, ‘What can I do better to help?’ That’s where I feel I lacked a little bit. … Personally, it was tough.”\n\nAfter games on three continents and a whirlwind of ceremonies and travel, Team USA has finally arrived in the Olympics’ host city. And coach Steve Kerr had a corresponding message: It’s time to act like it. After a sobering film session Thursday that showed clips of some lackadaisical play, Kerr put Team USA through its most aggressive practice since coming overseas, hoping to ignite more spirit ahead of its Olympic opener Sunday against Serbia. “That’s what today is about. It’s the reminder. It’s time. We’re here,” Kerr said. “So it’s got to be 40 minutes of force and attention and focus, and we can’t let teams outplay us effort- and energy-wise like we did the other night against Germany, like we did against South Sudan.”\n\nKerr, a four-time champion as NBA coach and an assistant on the gold medal-winning team in Tokyo, and his staff are raising their games and expecting the players to follow. “We have another level. I think we have another two levels that we can get to, but it’s a collaboration always,” Kerr said. “So we can show the strategic stuff on the tape walk-through. We can show them, ‘Let’s do this, let’s do that. Let’s learn personnel.’ We got to know the shooters, know the non-shooters, all that stuff. So that’s where we can help them. Where they can help themselves is just effort and energy play after play, after play. This is different.”\n\nThe team boasts a carousel of long-limbed athletes of all shapes and sizes: power-based wing stoppers in RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Lu Dort, and Ejim; more rangy and nimble point-of-attack defenders in SGA, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and Andrew Nembhard. Frontcourt size and depth are the team’s most apparent deficits; the team has no natural rim protector, and its bigs are among the oldest players on the roster. “We can be dominant at a bunch of positions, but everybody’s going to have to be involved in the rebounding,” Triano, who has coached alongside Fernández on the Kings bench over the past two seasons, said. “We’re going to have to play faster than most teams. A lot of teams have a lot more size. So let’s spread ’em out, and let’s speed ’em up and down the court and be the quicker and more aggressive team. I really trust Jordi with coming up with ideas and schemes with the roster the way that it is.”\n\nTriano, who stepped down from his national team head-coaching duties in 2019, spoke to me while at Las Vegas summer league as part of the Kings staff, waiting for the team bus to arrive; these days, despite all the history he’s lived, he’s like any other Canadian basketball fan, ready to root for the team from afar. Earlier this year, I asked Nash how it felt watching Team Canada at the 2023 FIBA World Cup last year, seeing the kind of roster on the court that he and Rowan Barrett had long dreamed of fielding. “I was sitting at home watching in the summer at these odd hours. I don’t want to sound like the old man in the armchair, but what a source of pride to watch these guys go to battle for their country and get it done,” Nash told me earlier this year. “It definitely gave me goose bumps. I’m incredibly proud and respect these guys so much for making their country a part of their value system.”\n\nThere was speculation that Thibodeau, 66, would get an extension before the 2023-24 season. But the Knicks chose a wait-and-see approach. One element that they wanted a chance to see? How Thibodeau would get along with other departments in the organization, including the front office. Clearly, Thibodeau passed that test. He now has the chance to be the longest-tenured head coach since Red Holzman, who coached the Knicks to two NBA titles (1969 and 1973).\n\nTyrese Maxey had “no idea” why his family was traveling up the escalator at the Four Seasons hotel earlier this summer. His mother, Denyse, had an inkling, but did not realize the full scope of what they were about to experience. And then they all walked into the Maxey Museum. It featured video messages that brought him to tears from Philly basketball legends, along with personal family and friends. And mementos from his basketball journey, from his first pair of basketball shoes, to the NBA honors acquired during his fourth 76ers season. And 200 handwritten letters from fans, detailing how his play and personality have brightened their lives. This elaborate walk-through presentation was technically to celebrate Maxey signing his max contract extension — and the patience he exercised in waiting a year to finalize such a deal, which enabled the Sixers to execute a terrific offseason.\n\nThey compiled video highlights of Maxey’s Sixers career, along with data about jersey sales and community endeavors. They mocked up sketches and physical renderings on how the physical and digital aspects could all be assembled cohesively. They kept adding to the collection in real time, after Maxey won the NBA’s Most Improved Player and Sportsmanship awards, and went on a wild scoring flurry at Madison Square Garden in Game 5 of the Sixers’ playoff series against the New York Knicks. They even created a nine-foot hologram. And when they asked prominent connections, such as Dawn Staley and John Calipari, to record messages for Maxey, “they ran towards it to be a part of it,” Beebe said. “This speaks a lot to the entire backing that this community and this city has for Tyrese.”"
