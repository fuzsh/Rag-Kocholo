Vote below and help decide the greatest Minnesota Timberwolves center of all time!\n\n1\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: 2015-2022\n\nA remarkable force on the court, Karl-Anthony Towns was drafted first overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2015 NBA Draft and immediately made his mark as a dominant player. His impressive skills as both an offensive and defensive powerhouse earned him the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2016, showcasing his extraordinary versatility. Towns' exceptional ability to shoot from long range, as well as his prowess in the paint, sets him apart from other Timberwolves centers. With multiple NBA All-Star selections to his name, Towns is undoubtedly one of the best centers to ever don the Minnesota jersey.\n\nBirthplace : Bijelo Polje, SR Montenegro, SFR Yugoslavia\n\nNationality : Serbian-Montenegrin\n\nTeam : Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nPosition : Center\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: 2010–2017\n\nHailing from Montenegro, Nikola Peković was drafted in the second round of the 2008 NBA Draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves and quickly showed his worth. With a bruising style of play, Peković's presence was felt on the court, as he often outmuscled opponents and attacked the rim with ferocity. While he did not earn any significant accolades during his tenure with the team, Peković was a fan favorite for his relentless work ethic and relentless pursuit of rebounds. His impact and intensity on the court will long be remembered by Timberwolves supporters.\n\nBirthplace : Monticello, Mississippi\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Utah Jazz\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: 2007–2010\n\nAcquired by the Timberwolves in a blockbuster trade back in 2007, Al Jefferson quickly established himself as one of Minnesota's premier centers. With a bruising style of play and a keen eye for grabbing rebounds, Jefferson was a critical piece of the Timberwolves' frontcourt. A master of the low post, he consistently outmaneuvered opponents with his footwork and finesse near the basket. Although he never captured any major awards during his tenure with the team, Jefferson's skill set and contributions to the Timberwolves remain etched in fans' memories.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: 2019-2022\n\nAfter going undrafted in 2019, Naz Reid signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves and quickly became a valuable member of the team. His ability to stretch the floor as a shooting big man provides the Timberwolves with a multifaceted offensive threat, making him a difficult matchup for opposing defenses. Reid's rapid development and potential for growth make him an exciting prospect for Minnesota's future. Though still early in his career, Reid's skill set and contributions to the team have already solidified his place among the top centers in Timberwolves history.\n\nBirthplace : Saint-Quentin, France\n\nNationality : France\n\nTeam : Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nPosition : Center\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: 2022-ongoing\n\nRudy Gobert, anchoring the center position for the Minnesota Timberwolves, exemplifies a unique blend of dominating physicality and imposing size, causing opponents to think twice before venturing into his territory. With an uncanny instinct for securing rebounds, Gobert's presence in the paint is nothing short of intimidating, and he's been known to make the rim seem inaccessible to opposing teams with his impeccable shot-blocking ability. But don't be fooled into thinking his skillset is limited to the defensive end; Gobert's offensive prowess, characterized by his efficient scoring in the paint and underrated passing ability, adds a multifaceted layer to his game, making him not just a formidable defender but also a reliable contributor on the offensive end.\n\nRudy Gobert-Bourgarel (born June 26, 1992) is a French professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He also represents the French national basketball team in the international competitions. Standing at 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall with a wingspan of 7 ft 9 in (2.36 m) long, he plays at the center position. He was the NBA blocks leader in the 2016–17 season. In 2018 and 2019, he won back-to-back NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards, making him one of only ten players in NBA History who have won that honor at least twice. In 2019, Gobert shattered the single-season record for slam dunks with 306. That year, Gobert also led the NBA in screen assists, with 482, effective field goal percentage, with 66.9 percents, and true shooting percentage, at 68.2 percents. He has been named to an All-NBA Team in 2017 and 2019. He was named the French Player of the Year, in 2019.\n\n6\n\nRasho Nesterovic\n\nAge: 48\n\nBirthplace : Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\nNationality : Slovenian\n\nTeam : Toronto Raptors, Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, San Antonio Spurs\n\nPosition : Center\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: 1999–2003\n\nJoining the Timberwolves as a first-round draft pick in 1998, Radoslav Nesterović provided a formidable presence in the paint. Known for his shot-blocking prowess and rebounding abilities, Nesterović anchored the defense for the team, making it difficult for opposing players to score inside. Although he did not garner any major individual awards while with the Timberwolves, Nesterović's contribution to the team's success during his years in Minnesota cannot be overlooked. His steadfast defensive efforts solidified him as one of the franchise's greatest centers."
