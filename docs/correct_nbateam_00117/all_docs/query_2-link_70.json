        "text": "Steelers' Van Jefferson: Early favorite for WR2 job\n\nJefferson has \"pole position\" to be Pittsburgh's No. 2 wide receiver, according to Mark Kaboly of The Athletic. The Steelers signed four wide receivers with NFL starting experience between January and May, also bringing in Quez Watkins, Scotty Miller and Marquez Callaway. They've each had exactly one season with 500-plus receiving yards, either in 2020 or 2021. Jefferson's so-called pole position prior to training camp may not mean much, as he'll face competition not only from the aforementioned veterans, but also 2024 third-round pick Roman Wilson and 2023 third-rounder Calvin Austin. It looks like a wide-open competition for snaps/roles behind runaway No. 1 receiver George Pickens.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSteelers' Van Jefferson: Moves on to Pittsburgh\n\nThe Steelers and Jefferson agreed to a one-year contract Friday, Brian Batko of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Jefferson has a 50-802-6 line on 89 targets in 17 regular-season games from 2021 with the Rams on his resume, but the 2020 second-round pick otherwise has put together 63 catches, 798 yards and four touchdowns in his other three campaigns between L.A. and Atlanta. With his new squad, he'll be a part of a Pittsburgh receiving corps that lost Diontae Johnson via a trade with Carolina, meaning Jefferson currently slots in as the Steelers' No. 2 WR behind George Pickens. Ultimately, Jefferson's place in the pecking order for passes from quarterback Russell Wilson will depend on other additions made this offseason.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nFalcons' Van Jefferson: Fails to make impression\n\nJefferson caught 12 of 28 passes for 101 yards across 12 appearances for the Falcons in 2023. He caught eight of 15 targets for 108 yards in five appearances with the Rams. After Puka Nacua took the league by storm and Cooper Kupp returned to full strength, the Rams shipped Jefferson to the wideout-needy Falcons in mid-October. Poor quarterback play, coupled with competition from KhaDarel Hodge, Scott Miller and Mack Hollins, caused Jefferson to post less production in more time with Atlanta than he did with Los Angeles. Jefferson is an unrestricted free agent this offseason, and given his lack of production, it'd be surprising if the Falcons had an interest in retaining him. Arthur Smith was fired immediately after the Week 18 blowout loss to New Orleans, and his replacement has yet to be hired, so Jefferson's future isn't the only question mark for Atlanta this offseason.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nFalcons' Van Jefferson: Catches three passes in blowout\n\nJefferson caught three of five targets for 19 yards during Sunday's 37-17 loss to the Bears. Among Atlanta's wideouts, Jefferson finished with the second-most snaps, targets, receptions and receiving yards behind Drake London, who secured four receptions (10 targets) for 56 yards. The three receptions tied Jefferson's highest mark since he was traded to the Falcons, but it still wasn't a fantasy-relevant performance, as Atlanta's passing attack struggled, with starting quarterback Taylor Heinicke completing just 10 of 29 passes with three interceptions before being benched. Jefferson had eight receptions (15 targets) for 108 yards in five games with the Rams, but he has compiled just 10 catches (25 targets) for 88 yards in 11 games with the Falcons.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nFalcons' Van Jefferson: No targets in win\n\nJefferson didn't record a target during Sunday's 13-8 win over the Jets. Despite playing his most offensive snaps (33) since Week 9, Jefferson failed to record a target for the second time this season and the first time as a Falcon. Over his last four appearances, Jefferson has hauled in just two of seven targets for 27 yards. Atlanta's passing attack struggles to keep even Drake London and Kyle Pitts relevant in fantasy, so Jefferson's value remains limited, at best.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nFalcons' Van Jefferson: Catches one pass in win\n\nJefferson caught one of two passes for 13 yards during Sunday's 24-15 win over the Saints. Jefferson was one of six Falcons to catch a pass, but only Drake London (seven) and Bijan Robinson (six) saw more than two targets as Desmond Ridder attempted just 21 passes. In six games with Atlanta, Jefferson has caught six of 16 targets for 56 yards. He's carved out a depth role with his new squad, but given the Falcons' passing struggles, Jefferson doesn't need to be rostered in standard leagues.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nFalcons' Van Jefferson: Held without a catch\n\nJefferson failed to secure his only target during Sunday's 25-23 loss to Arizona. Jefferson played 26 offensive snaps, the third most behind Drake London (55) and KhaDarel Hodge (28). However, Atlanta's passing attack was abysmal, as Taylor Heinicke (hamstring) and Desmond Ridder combined to throw for just 94 yards during the loss.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nFalcons' Van Jefferson: Struggles to make positive impact\n\nJefferson caught one of four targets for 14 yards during Sunday's 31-28 loss to the Vikings. With Drake London (groin) sidelined and Mack Hollins (ankle) leaving the contest early, Jefferson played the second-most offensive snaps (45) among Atlanta's wideouts. However, the newcomer failed to make a positive impression on his new team for a fourth straight week. Jefferson was consistently involved in the passing attack but secured just one reception. He also committed a penalty that wiped out a fourth-down conversion and got called for a personal foul after the Falcons' go-ahead touchdown that gave the Vikings good field position on their final drive. Between drops and penalties in recent weeks, Jefferson isn't trending in the right direction, but he'll likely keep getting opportunities if London and Hollins remain out moving forward.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nFalcons' Van Jefferson: Plays 47 offensive snaps\n\nJefferson caught three of five targets for 24 yards during Sunday's 28-23 loss to the Titans. Drake London (groin) leaving in the third quarter allowed Jefferson to handle his most usage since joining the Falcons. It also appears Jefferson is eating away at Mack Hollins' playing time, as the latter played a season-low 14 offensive snaps. If London is sidelined moving forward, Jefferson could emerge as Atlanta's top wide receiver, but expectations should be tempered, given pass catchers like London and Kyle Pitts have struggled to be consistent fantasy producers in this offense.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nFalcons' Van Jefferson: Set to make team debut\n\nJefferson is active for Sunday's game against the Commanders, Tori McElhaney of the Falcons' official site reports. The Falcons acquired Jefferson in a trade with the Rams on Tuesday, but it appears he's grasped the playbook quickly and will make his team debut Sunday. However, fantasy managers should expect the 2020 second-round pick to play a limited role during his first game with Atlanta. Across five games with Los Angeles this season, Jefferson caught eight of 15 targets for 108 yards.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nFalcons' Van Jefferson: Decision on status coming Saturday\n\nHead coach Arthur Smith said Atlanta will make a decision Saturday on Jefferson's status for Sunday's game against Washington, D. Orlando Ledbetter of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Jefferson was acquired Tuesday in a trade from the Rams. The wide receiver is healthy, but it remains to be seen if he has mastered enough of the playbook to make his Atlanta debut Sunday against the Commanders. If he plays, Jefferson's likely to have a limited role to begin his tenure with the Falcons.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nFalcons' Van Jefferson: Moved to Atlanta\n\nThe Rams traded Jefferson and a 2025 seventh-round pick to the Falcons for a 2025 sixth-rounder Tuesday, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports. Jefferson earned at least an 83 percent share of snaps in the Rams' first four games of the season, with Cooper Kupp (hamstring) on injured reserve. Upon Kupp's return to the lineup Week 5 against the Eagles, though, Jefferson logged just two plays. Earlier Tuesday, Jeremy Fowler of ESPN.com reported L.A. was looking to move Jefferson, which has come to pass. Jefferson joins a WR-needy team in Atlanta, so he may be able to make an impact in short order alongside Drake London, Mack Hollins, KhaDarel Hodge and Scotty Miller.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nRams' Van Jefferson: Plays just two snaps\n\nJefferson wasn't targeted during Sunday's 23-14 loss to the Eagles. Jefferson's zero-catch day was his first since Week 9 in 2022, and his two snaps on offense were less than Ben Skowronek and just one more than Austin Trammell. The return of Cooper Kupp gives the Rams a preferred trio of Kupp, Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell as their starters, and they were on the field for nearly every snap on the day. Without a change of scenery or an injury to one of the aforementioned receivers, Jefferson will likely continue to see scant usage on offense.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nRams' Van Jefferson: Forgettable day with one catch\n\nJefferson secured one of four targets for nine yards during Sunday's 30-23 loss to the 49ers. The emergence of the sensational duo of Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell has relegated Jefferson to a tertiary role in the passing game, with Tyler Higbee and Kyren Williams also recording more targets than the veteran Jefferson during Sunday's contest. Jefferson was the target of one of Matthew Stafford's interceptions and had a drive-killing drop on third down, and his stock is trending down heading into a Week 3 showdown with the Bengals.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nRams' Van Jefferson: Sleeper WRs\n\nCooper Kupp (hamstring) is out for Week 1, which will force Matthew Stafford to use Jefferson and Puka Nacua in prominent roles. And I would use Jefferson as a borderline starter in three-receiver leagues. Jefferson already has a built in rapport with Stafford, and Jefferson had at least 14.8 PPR points in three of his final seven games to close the 2021 campaign. Nacua has made plays in training camp, and he seems like a rookie who could surprise this year, including in this matchup against Seattle. Nacua is worth a flier in deeper leagues as a flex option.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nRams' Van Jefferson: Steps into No. 1 receiver role\n\nJefferson will act as the Rams' No. 1 receiver for the season opener against the Seahawks after Cooper Kupp (hamstring) was ruled out for the contest, Jourdan Rodrigue of The Atlantic reports. After his latest setback with his injured hamstring, Kupp will sit out Week 1 and could be in store for a move to injured reserve, which would keep him sidelined through the Rams' first four games. Jefferson put up a pedestrian 21-342-2 receiving line over an eight-game stretch that covered most of Krupp's absence in 2022, albeit without Matthew Stafford at quarterback for nearly the entire period. Despite the increased involvement he's likely to see in the passing game Sunday, Jefferson doesn't necessarily shape up as a must-start fantasy option against a capable Seahawks secondary.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nRams' Van Jefferson: Week 1 Waiver Priority List\n\nCooper Kupp (hamstring) hopefully won't be out long, but the Rams are likely without him to open the season. That should force Matthew Stafford to use Jefferson and Puka Nacua (5 percent rostered) in prominent roles, and both are worth adding in deeper leagues. Jefferson already has a built in rapport with Stafford, and Jefferson had at least 14.8 PPR points in three of his final seven games to close the 2021 campaign. Nacua has made plays in training camp, and he seems like a rookie who could surprise this year. Both are worth adding in deeper leagues for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nRams' Van Jefferson: Week 1 Adds (WR Preview)\n\nJefferson scored double-digit Fantasy points in four of his final nine contests last year and that was playing mostly without Matthew Stafford. With Stafford back and Cooper Kupp out, Jefferson should be the clear WR1 for an offense that is likely playing behind against the Seahawks. That makes him a boom/bust WR3 who is better served as a flex.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nRams' Van Jefferson: Should have larger role\n\nJefferson could earn a larger role in 2023, as he's been healthy this offseason and is now the second-most experienced WR on the Rams' roster, Stu Jackson of the team's official website reports. Jefferson had knee surgeries last spring and again in August, delaying his 2022 debut until Week 8 and leading to limited playing time in his first few games. He then played 46 or more snaps in each of the Rams' final eight contests and averaged 2.6 catches for 42.8 yards and 0.25 TDs on 4.5 targets. The numbers weren't bad given that he mostly played with backup QBs rather than Matthew Stafford, and Jefferson hopes things will go better this year with both him and Stafford healthy after injuries kept them off the practice field last spring/summer. Jefferson enters the final year of his rookie contract as a clear favorite for the No. 2 receiver role behind Cooper Kupp, if only because there's a glaring lack of both talent and experience in the WR room otherwise.\n\n...
