        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Gerald Henderson scored 17 points, Brian Roberts added 16 and the Hornets defeated the Timberwolves 105-80 on Monday — their seventh win in eight games.\n\nCharlotte's Al Jefferson returned after a nine-game absence due to a groin injury. He had eight points and five rebounds in his 25 minutes off the bench.\n\nIn all, Charlotte's bench outscored Minnesota 52-31, including 28-3 in the pivotal first half. Reserves Gary Neal had 12 points and P.J. Hairston had 11 for Charlotte.\n\nThaddeus Young had 18 points to lead Minnesota, which failed in its quest to win back-to-back games for the first time this season.\n\nCharlotte went 12 of 22 from 3-point range after making just 2 of 15 attempts Saturday against Indiana.\n\nThe Hornets jumped out to a 50-33 halftime lead, with the Timberwolves never mounting a challenge after being outscored 27-13 in the second quarter. Charlotte stretched the lead to 30 by the end of the third quarter.\n\nJefferson struggled early, missing a couple of easy shots, before starting to regain his old form.\n\nThe 2014 third-team ALL-NBA selection used a spin move in the low post and made a teardrop shot to get back on track in the second quarter. In the third quarter, he scored off a pick-and-roll with Lance Stephenson, and in the fourth knocked down a step-back 18-foot jumper.\n\nCharlotte (17-25) pushed its lead to 76-45 on a driving layup by Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with three minutes left in the third quarter and never led by less than 25 after that point.\n\nAndrew Wiggins, the top pick in the NBA draft last year, had 12 points on 3 of 13 shooting and was limited to two rebounds for the Timberwolves (7-33).\n\nCharlotte forced 17 turnovers on Monday, and have forced 37 total in their last two games. Charlotte has now won four of its last five games against Minnesota.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTimberwolves: Wiggins has scored in double figures in 14 straight games. ... The Timberwolves are 2-2 on their current road trip.\n\nHornets: Monday marked the first time in 544 games that Jefferson did not start when playing an NBA game. The last time Jefferson came off the bench was Dec. 4, 2006, when he played for the Boston Celtics.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTimberwolves: Host Dallas on Wednesday.\n\nHornets: Host Miami on Wednesday.\n\n(© Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
