        "text": "Charlotte Bobcats coach Steve Clifford says center Al Jefferson will miss the team's home opener Friday night against Cleveland after re-aggravating his right ankle.\n\nJefferson, who signed a three-year, $41 million contract this offseason, didn't participate in the morning shoot-around and was seen walking around before the game with a noticeable limp.\n\nJefferson missed most of training camp after turning his ankle when he landed on Chris Bosh's foot during the team's second preseason game against Miami. Jefferson played in the regular-season opener at Houston on Wednesday night and had 13 points and eight rebounds in a loss.\n\nClifford says Bismack Biyombo will start at center.\n\nClifford says he doesn't believe Jefferson hurried back too soon, saying \"there's no way to gauge that type of injury.\""
