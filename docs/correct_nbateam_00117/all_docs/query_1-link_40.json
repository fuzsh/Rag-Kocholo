        "text": "On this day in Boston Celtics history, champion shooting guard Tony Allen played his first game for the team in a 98-95 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2004.\n\nThe former Oklahoma State Cowboy — taken by the Celtics with the 25th pick of that summer’s draft — didn’t have the most spectacular outing in his first appearance in green and white. However, the performance wasn’t indicative of his potential, thankfully. Allen put up 2 points on a single shot attempt and grabbed as many rebounds in his inaugural performance against the 76ers.\n\nHe was on the floor for just inside six minutes, with a single turnover and one personal foul."
