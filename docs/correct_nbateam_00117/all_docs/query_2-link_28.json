Jefferson remains the team’s franchise player and brightest star.\n\nNot that making the All-Star Game is his ultimate goal.\n\n“I don’t even think about it,” he said. “With the All-Star Game, you never know what you’re going to get. Last year I had the numbers, but I didn’t have the wins. My only goal this year is to try to get better. Get better and better as a player and as a team and make the playoffs. I feel if we take care of that, the All-Star Game will come along.”\n\nForward Ryan Gomes, who came to Minnesota with Jefferson in the July 2007 trade that sent Kevin Garnett to Boston, is taking his teammate at his word.\n\nWith a little help from his friends, though, Gomes has no doubt this can be an all-star season for Jefferson.\n\n“I think that’s what’s going to happen,” Gomes said. “We have to be there to have his back, too. He’s going to put up his numbers, get his 20 (points) and 10 (rebounds), and we have to be able to add to that. He’s our teammate, and we have to have his back every night. If we’re there at the end, we’re all going to get credit.”\n\nTo the Wolves’ credit, they moved to ease Jefferson’s burden during the offseason, acquiring rookie forward Kevin Love and guard/forward Mike Miller in a draft-night trade with Memphis.\n\nWith Miller and guards Randy Foye and Rashad McCants, the Wolves have three players who shot better than 40 percent from three-point range last season, so teams will have to think twice before ganging up on Jefferson in the low post this season.\n\n“Most definitely, if the other team is smart,” Jefferson said. “I’m pretty sure I’m going to see double teams instead of triple teams this year.”\n\nBefore coming to the Wolves, Jefferson said he rarely drew any double teams and certainly not on a nightly basis.\n\nLast season, that’s all he saw, at least after the first couple of months.\n\n“Probably from the midway point on,” coach Randy Wittman said. “And he got it from everybody. It wasn’t like one team did it and another didn’t. They did it all the time.”\n\nJefferson said the constant double-teaming was frustrating at first but that he learned to adjust.\n\nWittman said that’s an area where Jefferson must continue to grow but that he’s way ahead of where he was a year ago.\n\n“He’s playing with more confidence because he’s been through a year,” Wittman said. “I think the thing that’s going to stand out with Al is what steps he makes from a defensive standpoint. That’s the next step in his game that he has to improve on.”\n\nWhen it comes to the rest of Jefferson’s game, there’s little room for improvement.\n\nComing off a season in which he posted career highs in scoring (21 points per game) and rebounds (11.1), Jefferson was limited during training camp by a sprained knee ligament, but it and he got better as the exhibition season went on.\n\nJefferson followed an opening 18-point, nine-rebound game at Milwaukee with seven more solid outings and finished exhibition play as the team leader in points (14.9) and rebounds (9.0) while playing a little more than 26 minutes per night.\n\nThe rest of the Wolves weren’t as consistent, but Jefferson feels good about the team and has high hopes.\n\n“We’re young, but this is my fifth year coming up,” he said. “It’s Gomes’ fourth year. We’re young, but we’ve got some years in the league. Even though we’re young, we think this could be the first of many good years for us.”\n\nBecause this is a young team, Jefferson said it’s important to get off to a good start.\n\nA 6-2 exhibition record is nothing to get too excited about, but it’s an encouraging first step for a team that lost 24 of its first 27 games last season on its way to a 22-60 finish.\n\n“November and December are going to be big for us,” Jefferson said. “We’ve got to win games in those first two months. Once we do that, that will give us our confidence, but we can’t get relaxed then. We’ve got to keep it going.”\n\nOriginally Published: October 28, 2008 at 11:01 p.m."
