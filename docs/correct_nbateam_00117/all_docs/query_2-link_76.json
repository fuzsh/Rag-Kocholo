        "text": "What’s it like having the face of the franchise for the last two decades, Jerry Sloan, back in the fold?\n\nIt’s just a great experience too, you know, having a guy like Jerry Sloan, you know? Soon as he walk in the gym, you know, the whole intensity changes. You know I’m saying?\n\nYou know, he’s that Hall of Fame coach, so you know you wanna go out there and play hard for him, ’cause he know, obviously know what he doing. So you know, like I said, he walks in the gym, the whole intensity change. The whole mindset change. And you know, I’m happy he back.\n\nYou’ve been playing behind Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap. Do you feel like this is your team next season?\n\nYeah, I do. You know, I’ve been playing behind them for three years. You know, I learned a lot from them.\n\nAnd you know, when the moves went down this off-season, you know, both of them called me, talked to me. You know, they were like, “Yo, you know, it’s your team now. You gotta go out there, you know, and do what you gotta do.”\n\nWhat are your individual expectations for next season?\n\nRight now, you know, just going out there, and you know, showing the NBA I belong. You know, last three years, I’ve been coming off the bench playing behind guys, and you know, I think this summer, coming up, you know, gonna be a big change."
