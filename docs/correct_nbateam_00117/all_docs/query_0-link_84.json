        "text": "In light of the fact the Celtics have 33 wins and the Timberwolves have 34 losses, it’s been popularly portrayed that Minnesota got swindled in the Kevin Garnett trade.\n\nBut Doc Rivers roundly refuted that notion yesterday on the eve of Minnesota’s visit.\n\n“This is the argument I’ve made with that whole thing – the whole Celtic conspiracy that (Kevin) McHale will be president in two years,” he said. “Kevin McHale wanted to get the best young player that he could get if he was going to trade Garnett, and he got him.\n\n“There was not another young player he could have got that was offered better than Al Jefferson. And then he got other players (Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Sebastian Telfair, Theo Ratliff, two first-round picks) with that. But the key for McHale was to get the best young player available. I think he got him in Al Jefferson, and I think Al Jefferson’s numbers have proven that.”\n\nJefferson arrives back in Boston fresh from a 39-point, 15-rebound game against Phoenix. He’s averaging 20.8 points and 12.1 rebounds.\n\n“Al’s going to be an All-Star,” said Rivers. “There’s no doubt about it. I don’t know about this year. With his numbers, he would have made it this year, but their record will prevent him from making it. The next thing Al has to do – and it’s not just Al; he has to be on a team to do it – is to get those numbers on a winning team, and then he will be an All-Star. He has All-Star numbers. He doesn’t have an All-Star team yet.\n\n“Al is who he is. He’s a great offensive player, and he’s improving on the other end. He’s improving his passing. He’s just getting better.”\n\nPaul Pierce is more than happy to have Garnett as a running mate, but he knows the Celtics didn’t give up nothing to get him.\n\n“In Al you get a franchise guy you can really build around – a low-post presence, a guy who rebounds the ball,” he said. “You’ve got to understand he came out of high school and he’s only in his fourth year. Al has a great upside and you can tell by how he’s doing things this year he’s going to be an All-Star definitely in this league.\n\n“I think his work ethic has got a lot better, just learning what it takes to survive in this league and what he has to do on a night-in-and-night-out basis to be a great player. Al’s been playing really well this year. I think if he was on another team he’d probably be an All-Star. He’s putting up some great numbers. He’s just building on what he did last season for us. He’s one of the rare 20-10 guys in the league.”\n\nJefferson’s close friend, Kendrick Perkins, expects to be on him tonight.\n\n“I should have him,” said Perkins. “It’s going to be crazy. It ain’t going to be nothing different than when we were at practice. Some days he’d just be on and you couldn’t stop him.”\n\nSpeaking of the moment he learned about the trade, Perkins said, “It was kind of hard. I was happy that we’d got Garnett, but at the same time I didn’t want to see Al leave. I know that’s the business. I kind of wish he would have got traded to a better situation, but it happens.”\n\nPosey eyes Sunday\n\nJames Posey isn’t likely to be back tonight from his right index finger injury, but he’s getting close.\n\n“I still would say this weekend – at the end of the weekend,” said Rivers, whose club plays next on Sunday afternoon in Orlando. . . .\n\nThe Celts skipped the on-court part of practice yesterday, choosing to watch selected video of their 114-112 loss to Toronto, in which the Raptors shot 58 percent from the floor and made 15-of-21 treys.\n\n“Film’s good,” said Rivers. “It saves the legs and opens up the mind a little bit. There was no offense on it. I can tell you that. It was all defense.”\n\nGarnett added, “Film don’t lie. If you have an assignment that you miss, it’s going to tell you. Every now and then, especially when you have a loss, you need to see that. It puts everybody back in perspective and gets you refocused.”"
