        "text": "Al Jefferson will miss tonight's game with Golden State for undisclosed personal reasons, coach Kurt Rambis announced. The Wolves' leading scorer, who has averaged 22 points against the Warriors this year, will be replaced in the starting lineup by Kevin Love.\n\nJefferson did not practice with his teammates Tuesday or Wednesday morning, Rambis said, though it's possible he may return for Thursday's practice."
