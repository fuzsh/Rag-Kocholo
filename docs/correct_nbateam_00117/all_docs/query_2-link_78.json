        "text": "Utah Jazz big man Al Jefferson has been in the NBA eight seasons, during which he's stood out as an especially skilled scorer in the post despite coming into the league straight from high school. Yet, while those skills were at a level we usually see from veterans, Jefferson had other tendencies more commonly associated with youngsters. For instance, he was a bit of a black hole, averaging 2.0 or greater assists per 36 minutes just twice in his career despite never dipping below a 21 percent usage rate.\n\nHowever, Jefferson, now 27 years old, is learning. In fact, he finally figured out that getting the ball to shooters on the perimeter opens things up for him on the inside. From Steve Reed of the Associated Press (via TBJ):\n\nAs Trey Kerby notes, Jefferson hasn't played with many great 3-point shooters in his career, so he can be forgiven for not thinking this was the best idea. On the other hand, his presence might very well have made those shooters better if he'd focused on passing to them earlier. A basketball team is a group of interdependent players, and the stats of one guy can be explained by the play of others.\n\nStill, while it might be easy to knock Jefferson for taking so long to figure out what seems like a pretty basic point, it's nice that he did so at all. Lots of talented players never realize this important point. Jefferson deserves credit for growing, even if that growth came later than many would have liked."
