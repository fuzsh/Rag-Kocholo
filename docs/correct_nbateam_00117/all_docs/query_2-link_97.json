        "text": "LOGAN SQUARE — Two restaurants have joined Logan Square’s eclectic dining scene with veteran chefs in control.\n\nMano a Mano, from chefs Doug Psaltis and Hsing Chen, opened last week at 2534 N. Milwaukee Ave., next to the team’s first Logan Square restaurant, Andros Taverna. Joy Chicago opened last week in the former Ground Control spot at 3315 W. Armitage Ave.\n\nMano a Mano serves fresh pastas and focaccia, vegetable-focused sides, Italian wines and traditional, simple Italian sweets.\n\n“We fell in love with the trattorias all over Italy and really just how honest they are, how intentional and soulful they are,” said Psaltis, a Michelin-starred chef. “We want to create an environment that’s very cozy and and warm and comforting.”\n\nPsaltis, who is Greek and has an extended Italian family, grew up in New York working in Italian kitchens and has led numerous prominent Chicago and New York restaurants. Chen is a longtime pastry chef who has worked at mainstays including The French Laundry and The Peninsula Hotels. The two now lead their own hospitality group, which includes Asador Bastian in River North.\n\nThe couple has traveled to many parts of Italy over the past 12 years and partnered with locals whose products now shape the diverse menu at Mano a Mano, emphasizing the use of seasonally driven local products and ingredients, they said.\n\nThe menu includes regional staples like focaccia di Recco, thin oven-baked Italian bread from the northern Ligurian region, zucchini flowers with mozzarella more common in southern Italy and other simple vegetable dishes, as well as eight pasta dishes. The dessert menu features a Venetian-inspired terrazzo cheesecake, a Roman maritozzi pastry and gelato “al minuto,” whipped up to order.\n\nThe intimate, dark-lit dining room has 82 seats and two community dining tables meant for single diners to mingle after the owners noticed friendships blossom between single diners at Andros Taverna, the owners said.\n\nMano a Mano is open for dinner 4-10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 4-11 p.m. Friday-Saturday. Brunch and lunch will be offered soon.\n\nJoy Chicago\n\nThe Latin and European-inspired Joy Chicago features dishes from Ecuador, Mexico, Spain and Italy — a combo of favorite dishes from chef and owner Victor Sanchez.\n\nPopular dishes include the vegetarian paella, the grilled portobello sandwich and the rigatoni pasta, Sanchez said. The restaurant also offers large plates to share that do well for parties or leftovers, he said.\n\n“The menu has all of my favorite things, and I love to cook them,” Sanchez said.\n\nSanchez, who is from Ecuador and has over 30 years’ experience cooking and running restaurants in the city, decided to open his own spot and bring affordable, healthy and diverse menu options to diners in the area, he said. With help from Esteban Garcia, Sanchez’s consulting chef, the team hopes that Joy Chicago can brighten up the corner and offer something for everyone.\n\n“Joy Chicago is Victor creating a menu based on what he’s enjoyed, what he’s made and what he knows that people enjoy,” Garcia said. “We’re applying a home-style cooking — like if people were to go to Victor’s house, this is what he’d serve you.”\n\nJoy Chicago is open 8 a.m.-3 p.m. with a brunch menu, 11 a.m.-2 p.m. for lunch and 3-9 p.m. with an extended dinner menu. The restaurant, which will soon have alcohol, closes at 10 p.m. Saturdays."
