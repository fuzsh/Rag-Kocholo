        "text": "Los Angeles native Josh Kouzomis, aka Troublemaker, is an internationally known DJ, producer, and remixer, as well as one half of the groups King Fantastic and Rad Omen.\n\nTroublemaker began making his musical name as a college radio DJ and music director at Ohio University’s ACRN. His school stint was brief but critical, and resoundingly affirmed Kouzomis future lay elsewhere, specifically, Los Angeles.\n\nOnce home, Kouzomis joined punk/hardcore giant Epitaph Records first as a grass-roots marketing intern and then as a radio promoter, positions he capitalized on. He took what he had learned firsthand about the indie music business and production during his Epitaph tenure to co-found Celestial Recordings, the acclaimed underground hip hop and drum-and-bass label. Just one year later, Rolling Stone named Celestial-affiliated Konkrete Jungle (L.A.) Best Dance Club.\n\nTroublemaker’s Konkrete-era sonic experiments with Celestial partners Daddy Kev, DJ Hive and Phoenix Orion fueled Kouzomis’ personal ambitions. Not one to miss a beat, he next enlisted E. Moss to form Backyard Bangers, whose eponymous debut track, a collaboration with DJ Z-Trip, is on the Constant Elevation compilation.\n\nThe albums title typified the trajectory of Kouzomis career then and today characterizes Troublemaker’s professional advance and ascent. This DJ since then has steadily turned out remixes and commercial pieces true to his name, consistently causing the best kinds of diggable disturbance. Whether winning the annual URB Magazine/Scion Mixtape contest, or re-working Linkin Park’s “Runaway” on the multi-platinum Reanimation album, Troublemaker has proven himself both a master producer and DJ. With a diverse discography boasting works ranging from Johnny Cash Remixed and Good Charlotte’s Greatest Remixes to remixes of Nina Simone and Matt and Kim featuring De La Soul, Kouzomis has roused the audio rabble in-car, in-club, and even in-Capital: in January 2009, Troublemaker, alongside De La Soul, Moby, Santogold, and Shepard Fairey, rocked D.C. at the Manifest Hope Inauguration Party in Washington.\n\nWhile others are satisfied with the standard mix-and-tour, Troublemaker refuses to settle, or settle down. His first solo album, Maestro, featured tracks like the alt/modern rock-tinged “All Night” and the hip hop/pop-appealing “I’m Famous” that demonstrate Troublemaker’s ability not only to produce and remix others but also to do it for himself. His groups King Fantastic and Rad Omen’s sheer diversity and Troublemaker’s motley musical skills make each album new and unique. In conception and in your ears, Troublemaker is the kind of aural showcase and body-moving rollercoaster that can not (or will not) be stopped."
