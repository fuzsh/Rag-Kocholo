        "text": "The year started on a high for EVNNE. After making their debut in September last year, they made their first comeback earlier this year with their second mini-album Un: SEEN, and its title track ‘UGLY.’ We knew it was a hit the first second we heard it and, indeed, ‘UGLY’ earned them their first two music show wins. So yeah, it looks like 2024 has nothing but good things in store for EVNNE, and we’re so ready for it.\n\nBut before their win, only a few days after the release of Un: SEEN, we were lucky enough to assist a virtual roundtable in honor of EVNNE’s first comeback. All the boys were so lovely, and they were so happy and enthusiastic to answer every single question. And here’s everything we learned about EVNNE and Un: SEEN!\n\nFrom ‘TROUBLE’ To ‘UGLY’\n\nEVNNE debuted in September, so not much time has passed between their debut and this comeback. Yet, many things have changed. EVNNE are sticking to the energy we first fell in love with, and they’re also exploring new territories. With this comeback, EVNNE aren’t taking the exact same route but rather chose to show us what had remained unseen in their debut.\n\nWe aimed to reveal a stronger and more intense side of EVNNE to the public. While Target: ME, our previous album, portrayed a naughty boys’ image, in this one, we embraced a more mature persona.\n\nYoo Seungeon\n\nWith ‘UGLY’ and the concept behind Un: SEEN, they parted from the troublemakers’ image and embraced a more mature side of them. ‘TROUBLE‘ was their introduction to the world as a group. It was what created our first impression of EVNNE as a group. And it was clear from the beginning that they were here to break boundaries and make some noise. The story behind ‘UGLY’ tells a much different story and shows the group’s growth in only a couple of months.\n\nInstead of characterizing this comeback as “darker” than our previous one, I believe it’s more accurate to describe it as a maturation process. We’ve transitioned from being immature, boyish troublemakers to individuals who have experienced pain, revealing aspects that were not previously shown to the public.\n\nJi Yunseo\n\nIndeed, ‘UGLY’ mixes new musical influences and creates a bold, hard-hitting track. But at its core, it is about overcoming insecurities and embracing the imperfect parts of ourselves. With this comeback, EVNNE showed that they had many different parts to them and we’ve only seen one small portion of all the things they can do.\n\nThe Process Behind Un: SEEN\n\nEven if ‘UGLY’ is the main character of this story, the b-sides are just as worthy to get obsessed with. Ever since their debut, some of the EVNNE members have been credited in some of their songs, and Un: SEEN wasn’t an exception as we saw them credited in songs again: ‘SYRUP,’ ‘CHASE’ and ‘Festa.’ They took it even a step further in this album as Keita also participated in the composition of ‘Festa.’ When asked about his process behind the songs, he explained that ‘Festa’ is all about the energy ENNVE (their fandom) gave them during their first fan meeting.\n\nI participated in the lyrics and composition of the song, ‘Festa’ in this album. The inspiration for this track stemmed from the festive atmosphere during a fan meet-up and the excitement I had while interacting with our fans. I drew a comparison between that to a festival.\n\nKeita\n\n‘FESTA’ seems to be a group favorite as much as a fan favorite. When we asked which b-side they would make a music video for, ‘Festa’ was a no-brainer for Hanbin.\n\nAs a group with a powerful and intense image, we often filmed music videos with a similar concept. However, ‘Festa’ presents a bright and lively image, giving off an amusement park and fireworks vibe. I want to film its music video in such places to capture the essence of the track.\n\nPark Hanbin\n\nJihoo, on the other hand, picked ‘SYRUP’ for its dreamy vibes. And indeed, ‘SYRUP’ is another song that the members had their hands in the making of. ‘SYRUP’ was written by Keita as well as Jeonghyeon and Yunseo.\n\nI participated in writing the lyrics for the song titled ‘SYRUP.’ Drawing a parallel between the group’s irresistible charms and the word ‘syrup’, I aimed to emphasize our talents and appeal through the lyrics. My goal was to encapsulate all of our charms in this song, allowing listeners to get a good sense of what it is by simply listening to the song.\n\nLee Jeonghyeon\n\n‘Chase’ is one of the most impactful and unforgettable b-sides in Un: SEEN. And it also counted with the participation of Keita and Seungeon. They truly created something unique and special with this song. They wanted to challenge themselves with this one, and they definitely outdid themselves. And the fact that the members didn’t participate in the making of ‘K.O. (Keep On)’ doesn’t make it any less special to them. Indeed, when asked what songs from the mini-album they would use as a soundtrack of their lives, both Hanbin and Junghyun picked this song because of his hopeful message.\n\nI […] choose ‘K.O. (Keep On)’ because the title suggests to keep on moving without any limits or restrictions. I think it resonates well with the ambition of the team.\n\nMun Junghyun\n\nTarget: ME was a great introduction to the world as EVNNE, but they pushed the barrier even further with Un: SEEN. It showed their constant desire to push themselves over any expectations, go over the line, and show every single part of them. And there is still so much to see of EVNNE; we’re sure of it. These boys will never stop surprising us.\n\nEVNNE’s Bond With ENNVE\n\nAlong with a debut and a comeback, EVNNE held their first fan meeting not too long ago, where they got to meet ENNVE. This was an event that truly impacted them, as exemplified by the mere existence of ‘Festa.’\n\nEVNNE are incredibly grateful to their fans and they didn’t fail to mention the strength and courage ENNVE give them everytime they could. Their bond and love for ENNVE is undeniable. When discussing the comeback and what motivated them, it always came down to ENNVE.\n\nCompleting the last promotion with fan meet-up event, the thought of seeing our fans again to share the stage always lingered in my mind. It’s challenging to pinpoint just one moment, as every step in the preparation process was new and filled with excitement, all centered around the anticipation of reuniting with our fans.\n\nJi Yunseo\n\nWhat To Expect Next From EVNNE?\n\nEven with just one comeback, EVNNE are already looking forward to exploring new things in the upcoming year. More music, more performances, and more things to keep us on the edge of our seats, that’s for sure. EVNNE have such ambitions and desires to show the world every piece of who they are both as a group and as individuals. For once, their implication in the making of their music seems to be very important to them, and we love to see it.\n\nFor our debut album, we were mostly involved in lyrics writing, but for this album, we expanded our roles to include composing. This allowed us to showcase the individual abilities of each member and served as an opportunity to witness the potential we hold as a group.\n\nPark Hanbin\n\nWhen asked about what kind of genres they would like to explore in their songwriting for the future, Yunseo even expressed his desire to mix their troublemaker image with something brighter and more refreshing.\n\nAs a group, we share the belief that we are capable of exploring and excelling in various genres without being confined to a specific style. So I’m certain that we will be able to pull off any musical genres.\n\nPark Jihoo\n\nSo we literally never know what EVNNE could come up with next. And that’s the best thing about it. They’ve already proven that whatever they’ll do, it’ll be a banger. It is clear by their strong bond and their ambition that EVNNE are here to give their all to the group.\n\nEver since we first met on the show to our debut as EVNNE and until now, we’ve maintained a shared goal that has deepened our understanding of each other. Our continuous efforts toward achieving this common objective have consistently improved our teamwork, fostering a strong bond within the group.\n\nJi Yunseo\n\nAfter the massive success of EVNNE’s first comeback, we can’t wait to see where this rollercoaster brings them. And we’re ready to be there for every step of the way. Their bond with each other, their fans, and their music are undeniable, and that’s what magic happens.\n\nWhat has been your favorite thing about this EVNNE era?
