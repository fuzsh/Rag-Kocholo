In order that we may acoomplish our task, we have to rcwort to some printed matoriala also, Which doom come under the jurisdlotion to 0.W,. It is only by such oombination, oan we accomplish our mission. POLIOYsi Well by the time I returned to Cairo, 1 to that the MO Branch WA4 not interested to operate in the Middle Scot, but WO re coneentrating all their effort* to the Balkans, as well as to Greece and Turkeys They mentioned the Directive of the Chiefs or Starts, which prohibit us from operating in the Ma. This policy is atill prevailing at the present time. Even liate Department orricials objected to our operating in that theatre, being it British aphere of influence. RETURN After staying In Cairo for a while, the MO Branch leanod me to SI*NB to do aome commercial study in Palestina, which was requented of them by F.R.A. At the completion of the work, 1 maw Lieut.

West, and later to Mr. Ben Amos, who had just taken charge of the MO Branch. They decided that I take a trip around the Middle Past, and so I travelled under cover of making a Post-War trade study in the Middle East for the U.S. Chamber Of Commerce, .and my credentials were drawn aocordingly. FINDINGS: The attitade of the majority of the people were anti- British and consiquently pro-German. They believe a British Victory will shatter all their future hopes for complete indepen-s dome, particularly in the case of Palestine. As regards the Atlantic Charter, they heard it often said by responsible British officials, that this charter would not apply at of Suez. So they are afraid that they shall not be better off after the war, Othaa they were before it, However, there is one sign of oncourage- msnt as far as we Americans are concerned, and that most of the Arabs look to us as champions of freedom and democracy, especially after the role we played in the Independence of Lebanon. Yet at times they get pessimistic and say that America is being controlled and run by the Jews, and tharefore no matter how willing or sympathetic the people are to their cause, the Government would not dare do anything which is contrary to Jewish aspirations er interests. They claim that President Rooseve/t is pro-Jewish, and they stress the fact that he is surrounded by a number of Jewish advisers. The Arabs also believe that the British can at any time out-smart the Americans in the field of International, Polities, and will eventually have their own way in the Middle ,45,4-ropi .

At the time of embarkation, there were five YUgoalav civilians with us who belonged to the SO Branch, carrying revolvers and radio receivers with them. At the docks the customs Orricers inspeoted the luggage and ineisted on displayina those articles right there, in front or everybody. They interrogated them in front of all sorts of people, without paying any attention to anything as seourity, especially when they were travelling under cover9 This was resented by those YUgoalav men who were willing and ready to sacrifioe their lives for the defeat or the enemy, but not to lose it so waltingly due to the atupicuvy of coup) of ottioera. Therefore special attention should be ?maintained in the future to avoid any auoh inoidents, whioh will endanger the lives ot those men and doteat their missions, before they over get a ohanoe to acoomplish anything.

Thesumily chutes have to bt repacked itken obtained tram the British, but if obtained from Amerimi sources they could be shipped, stamped and ready tor use, thereb2r. eliminating repacking: vhich wastes a lct of time when you constder thousands of thew being repacked. Sometimes ther send white chutes which show up like a flare when used on Voomlit nights, but we have to use them nevertheless. No one his setuall;r had an encounter with a night fighter in the 343 sorties (205 successful) flown. We have lost ftre planes thus far. An example of what happens is illustrated by the story of Lt Ambrows crew. They delivered their goods and were on their way back when thery hit a mountain. (This was reported by-the underground). The rear gunner vas seriously injured; two men are making their \"ay back via the undergrouad and one other member of the crew is making his own way back without the help of the underground. The papers such 43 b011biqg charts, etc. were returned to Sngland within three days after the crash. Lt Reardon thinks the underground would have been smarter net to risk this and feels it would have been safer to barn this evtdence. It is, job. an example of speed by the underground and thty did a splendid job. The first lto crash was the one piloted by Lt McDonald (over Belgiva) which occurred on larch 3rd. Lt McDonald's co-pilot i3 MCW back in England, havinc escaped through Fraace with the help of the underground.' Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/25: CIA-RDP13X00001R000100410002-7 ?

As it stands now, the British probably get better results only because of their attaching ? native-speaking man to operate this simple plane-ground tslephone. A. SI.V.AL21: (a) Pick-up - Rescue work. Nothing being done. 1=41.2QP.1k2E1 (a) Lt Reardon talked to Major Brooks (now replaced by *jar Gable ) about his (Reardon' s) talk with a British Group Captain, who was an old friend of his when he was with the RAF, by the name of rieldon, who is C. 0. of the RAF station at Tempsford (the British section of Harrington). Captain IFisldon, in collaboration with W/Cdr. Verrity (who has done !35 pick-ups for the British) arranged for 0$8 to get 6 ;1,and eglasiorsytlieolf= ::11\".'sfltititit: 11:40711\". pick enthusiastic about this and so were the men he had lined up , for the job, but the scheme was side-tracked somewhere along the lino. He feels that OS$ should do something along this line, use the lysandors (which after all are a great deal better than nothing - the reasoz1 they are not accepted as perfect being that they can only pick up 6 agents at once, while the C-.47 can pick up 20) and do the best we can with them. Picking vp these agents would be most valuable for getting recognition from the Partisan groups, who do not care if supplies came from us or the British (in fact do not from which) as long as they get them, but the men who are picked mp knew which oountry has done it and are asoordingly appreciative. Lt Reardon admits that we could surpass the British if we would use our initiative and not wait around for the perfect type of plane but use whet is there and the British were also willing to give us the facilities for training our pilot( and Ow * on the loreender planes. (b)I He also feels we oould out produce the British in anything we I set out to do and as an example ot this points out the fact that even though the British haws been in the war owes years longer than we, in four months' time our Harrington as against their Harrington can be judged by the folloeingt In the last- AprilAky moon period we delivered twice as maw agents as they did, 50% more packages and about .200 mere cestaimpre - so this gives an idea of American production ability ,if given a chalice. Lt Reardon feels that **means should begin working _ on this angle. , '11c p *t^ ? 41114 .111' Declassified and and Approved For Release 2013/09/25: CIA-RDP13X00001R000100410002-7 ? I AIM ? ?

I Reardon has experimented with these containers against the type used by the British and found them satisfactory for at least smell arm nd food. As thee. are at present our normal container load, we could use them for theme without , any worry abo4t anything being broken or spoiled,. The actual reasons for not using them ar,11 that (l) The balance of the containcrs is not perfect and (2) They have never been uerek: before. Another reason for using them is that the enlistek, men at the packing etetion are shays *head of themeelves in' reference to what we're physically able to drop, and fill in, the time drilling; but if thee. plestic containers were filled, 1 the materials welt spoil, and when D'-Day comes they will ' probably be glad to drop anything and everything in whatever 1 containers they have, and then these would be ready in case the demand comes in. srUATONs Most of our drops are in the Moon period, and the Partisan groups would like non-moon drops, such as the lritish do, using rureka-Rebecca radio sets. (b) S-Phone communication between plane and Partisan groups while delivering supplies, is the reason why we do not realise the results which the British do. POSUB4E $01411/021 Tho British Eureka-Rebecca radio sots have, a range of 89 miles to our ID, which makes our sets more or lest useless because if a pilot can stay on his course up to thirty miles of the drop ta-..gst, he does not have much worry. The radio set acts as a beincn for the pilot and with the poorer pet, if be should Ries him course because of bad weather conditions, 'to., he is likely to go over a \"Flak\" town, each would not occur with the better set, and would also make flying in non-moon periods a groat deal easier. Lt Reardon suggests that either 0.53 try to get ion oil these sets from the Ei itish or make one ourselves that is better than the one in use, which must be remembered has a maximum' rense of 30 miles and then only under perfect conditions, (b) S-Phone communication between aircraft and ground Reception Committees. The British have interpreters in the plane for the country over which they are flying and into which they intend dropping supplies. We have no interpreters and the. do not get the full value from the S-rhone sets. *s ha actually happened we might be over a French arm and allief,s sudden our radio Mn picks up the French mite of the partisan groups. *tile this is helpful to us to the extent that lOpem though our men don't understand what the Trenchman is $itimg? it helps guide the plane to some extent end one can suppose be Iis at the correct spot because of the contact, yet if ISeisest along on these missidis men who understood the Langlaget of the ?

His report deals with the OSS Parachute School located at Ringway Cheshire - 15 miles out of Manchester. 3. Major Cheever wan relieved from duty with 085 the 13th of April. He was ordered back to the Marine Corps, having been on TD with OSS, and in now attending the War College. 4.

The SOE representation consisted of the following: 1 Major C. 0., 2 Captains iADM., and the Trataing Section consisting of 2 Captains, 2 Lts., 2 igts., and 1 Cpl. Thia underataff of SO against SOE personnel is not serious because It is felt that most of the parachute training is over with. The output of trained \"Parachute Personnel\" never went over the 111444.M40 of 125 per week. WhiN1 I left the school we were traininp about 50 a week, however, the future need of the school, considering the fact that most of the known candidates to be trained had already completed their course* looked very dull. Up to the time of my departure we had trained and qualified around 350. The course, kailess otherwise requested, lasts one week and oonsists of 3-day jumps and 1 night. The course, however, is made to order, therefore, any- thing which is taught one group (in addition to routine parachute instruction) would not necessarily be taught another. The men jump from Ahitley Bombers (British) and all jumps are static line (Semi-fixed). The men use the British standard combat chute with a 28-foot canopy and which in made from either Nylon or Rayoix. The mon leave the plane through a hole in its bottom. The first man to leave the plane clears its' tall by 18 inches the remainder of the man clear the tail by 3 feet. The men jump, as all British personnel do, with no reserve chute. No deaths to date and a very low average in minor injuries is a feat the school is proud of. The housing of the mon is done in 2 country homes.

This memorandum is submitted in compliance with General Donovan's instructions that all officers of OSS shall file a comprehensive report on field conditions on their return to Washington from the field. 2. Lt Reardon (formerly with the RAF - now with the AAF) returned to Washington the latter part of May. His report deals primarily with the prevailing conditions and possible solutions governing our Airops at Harrington. Lt Reardon flew many missions for us, therefore, speaks from experience rather than observation. 3. His report as follows. \"For clarification, 3 will break down the contents under two headings: SITUATION and POSSIBLE POLUTION. I. A. SITUATION (a) In February we boriowed 100 containers from the British (Lt Reardon arranged the loan). These were dropped during the next two moon periods. - I - In March we borrowed 500 containers (only delivered 540 in, March moon period). In April we dropped 1300 containers and BOO packages (of these, Lt Reardon states that at least 1100 containers and 350 packages were American packed). At Area \"H\" we pack only small arms and food (\"A\" rations and British COY.P0 rations). We do not possess the technical radio equipment, etc., which is necessary, therefore, they are obtained from the British. Up until May 16th we dropped around 15G0 containers (for this wly.en period). 7500 plastic containers (ours Obtained frcm the Nary) are located at Area \"H\" - in orates, four to a crate, piled five crates high, around \"H\" Area. ????????? ? ? 14rwk ? t ? ? - MA:311 - ??????????????vapftwasit?pelm,???,....01111.\". npriassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/25: CIA-RDP13X00001R000100410002-7 4 .4 111 a ? Declassd and A? * proved For Release 2013/09/25 : CIA-RDP13X00001R0001004iuuu4-, B. POSSIBLE SOLUTTaa: To I., A., a, b, c, d, and *. Sometimes we are forced to substitute \"K\" rations and small arms for various items which we did not have, the substitution being merely to fill containers. We are still dependent on the British for such items as contalners, French francs, Belgian money, technical radio equipment, etc. If the aforementioned difficulties could be ironed out, we would be self-sufficient. II. A. SITUATION: (a) We have recently obtained 25 new crews, now undergoing train- ing for this particular tyre of operations, but have not as yet received the additional planes we were promised. WHY? Lt Reardon feels it is because of lack of coordination due to lack of authoritative recognition. B. FOSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: (a) Sometime in March General Doolittle visited Area \"H\" and was given a Cook's Tour. The General was both Famed and amazed and then and there promised OSS anything they wanted. Lt Reardon feels that the General is in back of us, but that he may pass down an O.K. for something for OSS to his Chiefs of Staff, who, not knowing of the activities of OSS, may basket any such request. At any event, our requests are not followed ithrough. Lt Reardon feels that the so-celled \"Big Boys\" should be given Cook's Tours (at least invited to come) when- ever possible, which would give them a picture and under- standing of exactly what OS ? is doing, and our possibill tea if given the necessary support. (b) Lt Beardon also feels that a permanent \"Air School\" for train- ' ing crews for this type of Air Operation should be ostablished, such as the one through which the 25 new crews are now going. Ha feels that the men in command, *hen they see on paper that so many crews are now in operation and 25 more assigned (at present without the planes), will be satisfied that the personnel situa- tion is well in hand. This, however, is far from the case as the pilots and crews complete their 30 missions fast in this work; also we do lose planes and personnel occasionally and the pilots have to get rest from coMbat fatigue. We must keep up reserves, as two nights Is the maximum the same crow can do in succession, as they are then exhausted, and are off for one night, when the planes also must be overhauled.

Smith Field trip report - China - 30 March 1943 to June 22, 1944 With Mr. C. J. Smith and Mr. G. E. Adams I left the United States on March 30, 1943 on the U.S.S. Hermitage. We arrived at Bombay on May 11, 1943 and, after traveling across India to Calcutta by train, we were able to obtain immediate transportation on a China National Aviation Corporation plane to Chungking, wh-l.ch place we reached on May 17. Mr. Adams was presumably representing the American Foreign Insurance Association, whereas Mr. Smith and I represented the American International Un- derwriters Corporation. To those who wsre curious about our reasons for coming out to China, we explained that our companies had sent us out on a joint survey of the China market; that we were not sure whether we would do any immediate ? business but that we wanted to check on future possibilities and at the same - time take care of any service that our old customers might ask for. Mr. Smith and I also were able to state that we were prepared to service United States Life and Asia Life insuranae policies which in one way was the most logical reason for our remaining in China inasmuch as hun&reds of individual life insur- ance policyholders had migrated from the coastal cities back into the interior. It soon became obvious that it would be most dangerous to accept any new fire and marine insurance in Free China. The currency was unsound, and, although the loss ratio was exceedingly mall due to the elimination of any moral hazard, it was quite obvious to one and all that as soon as any overland communications opened up into Free China there would be a catastrophic amount of losses from people who found themselves stuck with inventories bought at high prices. We were offered many possibilities of securing reinsurance from Chinese companies and a survey was made of this company market. A report was sent back to our respective New York offices, but we had little hope that they would see their way clear to authorizing us to accept any of this reinsurance business. At the same time r. adams and I were rather conspicuous in civilian clotl,es as we were obviously of draft age and the few foreign civilians in Chunking were for the most part ever forty years of age. ? Feeling that it would be unwise to remain in Chungking and attract attention, particularly when we were not doing any active business, it was de- cided that we should move out to some smaller city, preferable down-country, where we might be able to pick up some worthwhile data on both the enemy and internal Chinese con0;tions, 4.n opportuni to do this presented itself when Mr. J. Arthur Duff, who had already obtained conneCtions with the United China Relief, procured a job for us with the Kwanutung International Relief Committee U.C.R. committee for that prevince).

Consequently, in the interim, both of our employers were willing to offer our services to the U.C.R. on a voluntary basis and that our employers would take care of our salaries and ex- penses. Accordingly, we left Chungking in the middle of June ? by good for- tune were able to obtain military plane transportation to Kweilin From Kweilin we traveled to Kukong, the provincial capital of Kwangtung Province and the head- quarters of the relief committee there. We arrived in Kukong on July 12 1943. For the next two months Mr. Adams and I, along with Mr, Duff, worked on tee relief situation in Kukong with both the Chinese relief people and Mr. Edwari Lockwood, an American Y.M.C,A. man who was the head of the local commit- tee. It was agreed that Mr. Adams would remain in Kukong and take Mr. Lockwood's place while the latter went on a two months' vacation and that I would travel dowr to the famine area in Toishan - some ninety miles below Canton - with Mr. Duff. Durin?; these first two months in Kukong we orientated ourselves to the local situation and obtained information from refugees coming up from Canton and Hongkong. This information was passed back to a connection of Mr. Duff, a Major Otte, in Kweilin, who was head of a special branch of the 14th Airforce Intelli- gence whict dealt primarily with economic conditions in Free China and occupied areas and eot with operational information. During all of this time Mr. Smith in Chungking, as well as the three of us in Kukong, were waiting for some contact or rord free the OSS in China or Washington; but during this whole period no word from them had boon received. The one exception was the day before Adams and I left Chungking when a naval officer who had come out on the same ship with us from the States dropped around to our hotel, presumably on a social call. He said that he had heard thet we were going down to Kwangtung for the relief people and he had brought a friend around, a Commander Reighley (?)2 who asked us to give him a report on local conditions in that area when we returned to Chungking. He explained that he was with the OSS and that we could contact him through the American Army headquarters when we returned. He was one of Commo- dore Miles' men and frcm all indications knew nothing about us. In this regard we had heard about Commodo:7e 'les upo- eur arriNal in Chungking and understood that he was heading the OSS in but ee made no effort to communicate with him nor did he with us. Around the end of August, 1943 Mr. cuff and 1 left Kukong for Toishan and after a two weeks' trip by sanpan and by foot we arrived at our destination. Mr. Duff spent only one week in this aeea as he received a cable to report back to the United States. He departed for Kweilin and points west with a Reverend Mills, a Canadian missionary of about thirty-five yee-s of age, who headed up the relief situation in the entire Toishan area.

One boat trip aceose a bay along tho China coat wai made, another was made down to the City of Yeungkong from which wolfram was being shipped out to the Japanese and finally I traveled over to the Ngaimon River which is the border- line between 000upied and unoccupied Chtna. From my potation on one side of the river I was able to observe the varioue Japanese fortification(?) on this boundary line. Around the middle of October I went back to Kwellin, where I turned over my operationdintelligenoo information to Lt. Col. Wilfred Smith of A-2. Re was primarily interested in the Japaneee fortifications I saw, along with the pod- eibilitiee of setting up observation etations on the coast. From Kweilin 3 went back to Kukong and spent a week with Adams in that city. lie had worked out an arrangement with Major Otte whereby he had contacted all of the mieeionariee in Kwangtung Province who were doing relief work, and Adams sent them regular queetionnaires primarily dealing with internal conditions in their local areae. The misoionaries were toli that Adams was doing this as a favor for the 14th Airforce) and that they could be of real eervioe by helping in thin-3 regerd. Inaemuoh as all of them were interested in having increased eums tient to them for relief work and furthermore, inaamunh as Adams as temporary head of the provincial committee was in a poeition to affirm or disapprove such actione, the miseionariee went out of their way to give him detailed answers to these various eueptione. In turn Adams sent thin information on to Major Otte in Kwellin and he wan able to uend copiee to Mr. Smith in Chungking through the British Intelligence office in Yekong. They relayed all his reports to their Chungking office via cafe hand and Mr. Smith in Chungking showed them these re- porta an a return favor fer their cooperation in getting this information to him. Unforttuiately the miseionaries had to ueo the open mail in sending replies to Adams but Adam wee able to forward the information on to Major Otte by safe hand throu& en arrangement worked out with the local American Army Service of Supply station In Kukong. (1 left October 20, 1943) From Kukondl traveled back to Chungking and found the 14th Airfortes people very cooperative in supplying a traneportation, whereas originally on our trip to Kukong we had just managed to get on a plane to Kweilin. For one thing I believe thAr now-found hospitality was due to the information both Adams and I were oblo to give them, and in addition they sounded re out on whether Adams and i would be interested in obtaining eommissione in the Airforo. Intelligences In fact Lt. Col. Smith intimated that we would be given oaptaIn. oleo if we would reeign from our present outfit and go to Washington on trans- portation they would obtain for us. How Lt, Oa. Smith discovered we were with the ?SS I do not know, as, at that time, both Adams and 1 were very definitely sticking to our story of being insurance man lent out to the United China Re. lief and being only too anxioue to do any odd jobs we could for the local U.S., Declassified and A CONFIDENTIAL ??? proved For Release 2013/09/25: CIA-RDP13X00001R000100410002-7 ?

Naturally, C. J. Smith wan not aware of tho change for the same reason. With reference to the temporary ranks or the British intelligence in China, man that thily are only given this rank when they are in China, and if thr:f are transferred back to their regiments in India, they go back one or two ranks to one which correeponds to a rank of any officer in the Army who Ip not of the permanent Army. In other words, many Britishers who were oiviltans in the Far East and got out of China, Hongkong, etc. before Pearl Harbor wont to India and received direct war-time commissions such as a captaincy. When they were assigned to the British intelligence set-up in China, they wore given a \"temporary\" milk of Major.

Chine!, huoinese men travel in Free China by whatever tram,- porteg' el is available, but they hardly over are given trance- porirl on (n an elewican military plane unloes they are work- ing for the ,I.S.Alrforce. Whereas an American soldier can fly from Chungkin, to Kweiiin via Kunming in seven hours, a Chinese civilian traveling by truck and train will reach Kveilin in two or three weeks' timt. There As a regular traffic between Free and Occupied Chine, which is usually slow but is aocomplie-ed with a minimum of effort, and if the Chinese civilian is trans- porting goods, it unuelly only requires bribing the Chinese military and custor: officials in order to get their stuff into or out of Occui.3td areas. Their means of transportation is usually by foot over the immediate adjoining regions to the boundary line, and in el! 'r placan by sampan or bus. (2) It is my opinion that foreign civili are closely observed even in Chungking upon their arrival in China. t have heard a Chinese state the cases of two foreigners in Chungking who he states made derogatory remarks about the Chinese government; yet ac far 1 know these foreigners never have said anything in public. 3 do not bel'eve that in the large cities foreigners are necessarily shadowed, but 1 4[1nk a close watch is kept on them at the verious so-callud foreign hotels te ere their remarks can be easily overheard what with the flimsiness of tle' walls. Any foreigner tr./welling down country has to go through a lot ke: red tepe in order to get out of Chunking, and even then, when permiseion is given, I believe hie itinerary is cabled on to the officials in the .e-lous places he has stated ho will visit. I do not necessarily think le 't shadowed at all times, but I believe a very close check is kept on hie movements. In Mr. Adams' and my own cese 1 do not think we were aotuelly ehadowed a+ all timem until the last few months, and then Adams was in Kukong moot all the time and could bo easily observed; end for my part, in Chebiant Province, I did not detect anyone following me on my tr!,pc between various places. It was only after i reached and stayed in a certain place for several clays that 1 was beinL clocely observed. As regards the American military, I do not think they are shadowed, but 1 think a cloee scrutiny is kept on their movements when they are in out.of-the-way places and are apt to be in a position to see the bad internal conditiors of Free China.

Therefore, in my opinion, the beet intellioenoe job and the only real way a unified effort can be made le - under this now ACFRT errangement. It ehould not only eliminate personal eon. Mote but &Mould do away with doing overlapping work. At the preeent time the AFIA and the A111 have a very nice office In Chungking which ia run by a Mr. Richard ftim. He ie an Hawaiion.born Chineaes who wae manager of the Asia Life in Hongkong and, in my opinion, iv very re- liable individual. He le a rare exception in the Ohinene in that ho admits they have weakneeeep and at c.ho mama time hie viewpoint le very Amerioan. L'hi* haat had no intelligence experience but be wee able to procure throe Chins for our orgenivailon. One of these men did not turn out satiefactorily but the other two made tripe to hongkong and Stow and were in a poeition to obtain eome excellent informat.on. When Adame oontacted Colonel Coughlin, he told Coughlin about these two men and Coughlin consequently contacted Shim in Chung- king and worked out an arrangement, the detail e of which I am not fully *WOW* of. However, thee? two men, Harry and Ed, have been given radio sets and are pre.m aumably now in 000upied territory or very close to occupied territory. They soma all reports book to Captain Lynn in Kukong, who ie oenneoted with A.20 but I be- lieve will be in the new AOFRT net-up. Harry and Ed have also been given various other equipment which can be exceedingly useful in their operatdons, And I be- lieve they are also aupplied with funds whi.ah they can give to any agents they obtain. I furthermore believe that Shim will get reports of their work through Colonel Coughlin ;)r direct from Captain Lynn in Kukona. I have not seen Shim since last December and as a result I do not know what other work he io doing. However, I understand that Colonel Cooghlin haa worked out some arrangement with him and it might be that Shim is in a position to lend active assietanolo to the CCS oefice in Chungking.

I do think that some X-2 work could also be done at the same time; and certainly if I was to be kept in X-2 worktI could do a better job in China than LI India where I know people, have traveled extensively and have contacts in most of the areas in Free China and where I also know of several ouspicious people or cabarez run by girls whom I have heard maw stories of as regards their possible connections and what their true aims are at this time. I am referring In this connection primarily to two cabarets in Xmilin named the \"Lido\" and the \"Sky Hawk\". They are both run by Chinese girls who used to live in Hongkong and whose pasta are certainly questionable. As far as operating in China, I believe it would be preferable at this time to operate iu the open as I think any cover insofar as Adams or I are concerned would be extremely difficult to maintain. I think too that any pretense of cover would only arouse the suspicions of the Chinese that much more$mhereas if we operate in the open, either in a civilian or military capacity, and they are assured that we are not investigating internal conditions in Free China but are working solely against the enemy, they will neither view us with suspicion nor make any effort to obstruct oul work. I do think that having a definite military rank is preferable to going back as a civilian inasmuch as that carries more prestige when deoling with the local Chinese military or eivil officials. It also would not attract as much attention or questioning on the part of every- one. However, unless suitable rank is obtainable, 7 believe that these advan- tages are erased and that it is preferable to go back as a civilian definitely connected with the OSS, with some such anonymous title as \"Technical Representa- tive\". The British have no rank :In their intelligence set-up less than Major in China, which of course is only a temporary rank, but which enables them to deal with the Chinese with more \"face\" inasmuch as all Chinese are at least Colonels with whom an Allied intelligence man comes into contact. I, furthermore, under- . stand that General Chenault will not allow anyone to have temporary rank even when he is going down past the most forward American base. Speaking for myself, I do not believe that 1 will have any difficulty in carrying out my duties in China as long as I operate in the open end presumably work for the 14th Airforce - who are recognized by the Chinese as the \"big heros\". Frankly I do not want to go Fan!: to Chinn under the same system as oefore with no definite chLnnels of sendirr, information back or of getting trans- portation or other facilities reeded to o a really worthwhile job. I appreciate that the trouble caused on our last trip whereby we were never able to get any- thing back to the OSS was due to various reKsons; none of which is connected with any in&vidual unless we take Commodore Miles into the picture. In this connection I understand that Commodore Miles knew of our identity When we first arrived in China and that he openly disparaged anything we could do and more or less dismissed us as business men and referred to anything we might do as an amateurish effort. Every indication would point to tie fact that he notified Tai Lee of our true connections. I do know that Commodore Miles told his own personnel to stay away frem us. But, or the other hand, some of his personnel )have told me several t!-ings about Ooimmdore Yelles and his set-up in China.

However, when we finally heard that Irvine had not even left the States, I sent a radio message back through Captain Brown, Colonel Rubenstein's assistant, asking to be relieved of any duty in India or any enforced wait for Irvine's arrival. Receiv- ing no answer to this message I sent a commercial telegram to Mr. C. V. Starr stating that I was unwilling to remain in India any longer; and, as a result of this telegram, I received a message saying that transportation was being arranged. I left Calcutta on June 19, 1944 and arrived at LaGuardia on June 22, 1944. My reasons for being unwilling to remain in India longer were due to the fact that I was doing practically nothing of a constructive nature in Calcutta and that I knew that Colonel Coughlin and the other intelligence people in China all wanted me to come back there and work in the newly formed joint intelligence unit, AGFRT. Colonel Rubenstein had asked Adams and me t-th to fre- quent the various night clu:do in Cr,lcutta and attempt to get into various circles including the airforce pilots and the China National Aviation Corporation pilots. He wanted us to attemrt to detect any activities of Japans's? agents. Inasmuch N..) as both Adams and I were unacquainted with Calcutta and the people there, it took us some time to work ourselves into these circles, and even when we did we were unable to note any possible enemy agents, although we did discover and con- sequently have discharged one girl who held a responsible position as a secretary to a high American officer. We discovered that she was talking too much, but that was obviously through carelessness and stupidity on her part rather than because of being an enemy employee. Both Adams and I felt thEt our year in China had given us some experiener; in operational intelligence and that we were best fitted to serve in that capacity; whereas we had had absolutely no training in counterintelligence work ; nnd that we were hardly \"worth our salt\" in Calcutta. And at that time it was obvious that Colonel Fubenstein had no organized set-up in Calcutta and everything seemed to be rather at loose ends, which made our posit:on that much more worthless. In my opinion I can best serve in the Far East in the new associated intelligence agency of AGFRT. This unit will be headed up by Lt. Col. Wilfred Smith, who will be lent to theo by A-2. The personnel will be made up of A-2, G-2, ON', OSS and even people who are normally under Commodore Miles. Colonel Coughlin is working very closely with this organization and he and Colonel Smith seem to get along very well. As a consequence, I think for the first time that the USS will be able to work in China and actually obtain the full cooperation and approval of the various military intelligence agencies. Both Colonel Cougiain and Colonel Smith seem to think that I would be most valuable down on the Chekiang coast where I would have to my advantage the contacts I originally established there along with the active knowledge and cooperation of the British Declassi IDEN1:11\\L Am-iWPSPS!.?0?VIA*44 ? ...Z?..1*???-?:, Alb 4,4116.0...? and Approved For Release 2013/09/25: CIA-RDP13X00001 R000100410007-7 ? ? ....ate.. ?

I ff)lt quite sure these people were Tai Lee men and not Japaneqe,agents, and I believe that subsequent events have proved this to be the cas02) Upon returning to Pihu, the British told me that they had word that my cover had been exposed and that everyone in the local provincial circlesimew of my identity although I doubt whether they knew that 1 was connected with the OSS. They probably thought me a plain-clothes military man. When I returned to Kukong, Adams told me that several things had shown him that the Tai Lee was definitely aware of our true connections. As one example, he recited the case of Mr. Mills, the head of the Toishan relief, who had been asked by Mr. Duff to zcther information for us in the Toishan area, had entertained a Chungking banker who was visiting that region. This banker asked Mills, after a dinner party one night, whether he knew of three foreigners named Duff, Smith and Adams who were presumably doing relief work. When Mills replied in the affirma- tive , the banker said that we were not really relief men but were enemies of the Chinese people s.nd were spies looking into local internal conditions. He ascribed the fact that we were enemies of the Chinese people to the fact that we resented anti-foreign insurance laws that were apt to be put into effect in the near future. Mins, being of a rather emotional nature, immediately wrote the U.C.R., demanding that we be dismissed from their service; but the relief offi- -/ cials in Chungking never did ask Adams and me to dissociate ourselves from their organization. This might be due to the fact that we left China before they could take any such action, although I am not at all sure this is the case. I might add that Mills was never told that we were with the OSS, but when he had journeyed up to Chungking with Mr. Duff last autumn, Duff and Mr. C. J. Smith asked Mills whether he would be interested in helping the local war effort by gathering any information on his return to Toishan and forwarding it up to either Mr. Adams in Kukong or Mr. Smith in Chungking whichever way he could most safely transmit the information. Mr. C. J. Smith gave him 10,000 Chinese dollars to cover any ex- penses incurred in doing this work. March 12, 1944, After seeing Adams in Kukong, I went over to Kunming,/ where I con- tacted Colonel Coughlin, who I had heard was the new head of the OSS in China. Adams had contacted Coughlin several months before and had seen him when Coughlin came down to Kukong on a trip. The Colonel, upon hearing the situation as it stood at that time, decided that the best thing possible was for me to re- turn to Washington, get a commission and return to China to carry on intelligence work in the open. He senL a radio message to Washington and I was packed and ready to leave upon a moment's notice. This all took place around March 20, 1944. Although the Colonel sent two radio messages and a letter to Washington, no reply was received for six weeks, during which time I remained in Kunming, as it was thought that it would be inadvisable for me to travel around China any longer under the circumstances that existed then. It vas even felt that I should stay out of Chungking, so I did not go back to that city. After six ?? 'Noir ??????????? CD'AFIDENTIAL.

Pihu for several days and then proceeded down the Wu aiver to Wenchaw. Here I stayed with two Britishers who were in the British intelligence service and who offered me every possible cooperation. In fact they opened all their files to me and although they understood everything was being passed on by their main office in Calcutta to the 14th Airforce that was of an operational nature, I nevertheless made copies of practically every report they issued, with the re- sult that when, leeks later, I returned to Kunming, the 14th Airforce found out that the British Calcutta office had not turned over to them much of the in- formation I had been given in Wenchow. Aside from the information the British gave me; I obtained various bits of news regarding Shanghai and shipping move- ments along the coast from reliable Chinese sources I was able to establish. I also obtained some charts and papers taken from Jap ships that had been sunk by our planes. But for the most part this material had been already procured by the British, who sent it via safe hand direct to Calcutta, with the result that the 14th Airforce obtained very little of the loot taken off these ships sunk by their planes. I also made a trip out to Yuhman Island, some eight miles off the Chekiang coast. From a hill on this island I was able to detect Jap ships mov., ing southward an also could see the funnel and upper structure of a ship sunk by our planes some two miles off this island. The people on the islrInd also \\..0)sold me things they bad obtained from this ship that had washed ashore and that they had salvaged. Because of the fact that the Japs would undoubtedly be told of my presence on the island by local fishermen who were in their pay, I vas able to spend only two days and a night there. On returning to Wenchow I found that a message awaited me from Adams in Kukong stating that our cover had been blown. The British in Pihu also sent word down that they had informatior which would make it advisable for me to get back to their place immediately. On this entire trip I had posed as a relief official, but, inasmuch as the economic conditions in this province were particularly good, I had to change my position somewhat and say that I was up there looking into the plague epidemic that happened to be raging at that time. The local government officials had been exceedingly hospitable to me, which was partially d'ie to my being the first American in their section, and probably due also to the fact that they thought I had large amounts of relief money to dispose of. However, I found my- self being so tied down with their showing me around to hospitals and medical stations, along valth very extensive entertaining, that it was very hard to find time to look into matters that I was primarily interested in. Therefore, I finally told them that General Chenault had asked me, inasmch as I was going to be up in that area, to look into several things for him, and that as a con- sequence 1 would like to visit the coastal areas. The local officials did not dare to take the responsibility of approving my request so they tired back to Chungking for approval. Realizing that they would undoubtedly get a negative reply, I left Wenchow secretly on my trip to the Island, although upon my ar- rival there I found the head man expecting me.

I imagine Smith identified us through Colonel Jesse the head of the Airforce Intelligence, who was an ex-Texas Oil Compaly executive in Shang- hai. He ev:Idently knew of our connection when we first arrived in China. Upon my arrival in Chungking, on November 15, 1943, I discovered that Mr. C. J. Smith had had no word from the WS as yet but that General Donovan was due to arrive in Chungking in a week's time. This information was given us by Colonel Brown, the Naval Attache in the Embassy, who had been approached by the Messrs. Smith and Duff a month or two before and who promised, upon being told of their connections, that he would get back any reports given him to General Donovan in Washington. An agreement was made whereby Colonel Brown would be able to see these reports and would then get them back to the General. Mr. Smith and I sat quiet when the General arrived in Chungking and some tan days later we learned that he had already departed and that once again we had not been ap- proached by any OSS personnel. Mr. Smith then received a cable from Mr. C. V. Starr to return to New York for a conference, and I decided to go into a terri- tory where, as far as I knew, no American military personnel had been - that was on the Chekiang coast some two hur4red miles below Shanghai. I might add at this time that any information that was sent to Mr. Smith by Adams or me was being shown to two agencies, namely, the British Intelligence office in Chungking and .the American Naval Attache. Information given to A-2 was done so by Adams and --/me direct. ? ? I traveled down to Kunming, on Decewber 22, 1943, by CNAC plane inas- much as the military authorities suddenly tightened up on Army air transportation and were unwilling to cooperate in getting me down cvuntry. This might have been caused by my not acting their offer to take commission in the Airforce. At Kunming I was told that no civilians could travel on Army planes any longer so it was necessary for me to disclose my identity in order that the Airforce could mire back to Delhi to find out whether civilian OSS personnel were entitled to Army air transportation. Unfortunately, in doiag this, several people in G-2 also learned of this situation, and Colonel Dicky, on General Stilwell's staff, was apprised of Adams\" and my true identity. Word was finally received from Delhi that it was all right for us to use Army air transportation, and we were consequnntly given the worst priority for air travel issued in China, with the result that we usually had to wait a long time for plane transportation. From Kunming I flew to Kweilin and then proceeded on to Kukong by train. After a few days' stay in Kukong l traveled, via Pritish military mission truck, up to their camp at Pihu in Chekiang. Fortunately, General Grimsdale, the head of the British military set- up in China had given me a letter of introduction and with this letter I vas able to obtain the full cooperation of the British in such matters as transporta- tion, lodging, etc. The British military mission was interested only in guer- rilla training and had an arrangement with the 3rd War Zone in Chekiang similar to Commodore Miles' set-up in Arrehei Province.

(Note* This audienoe wan secured by my staff within 48 hours, which in an all time Vatican record. The Pope usually requires 2 weeks to 2 months to make arrangements for an audience.) At 1113 General Donovan left for Bari. 10, On 3 July Colonel Glavin arrived in R4M41 and ordered me verbally to proceed to Algiers and then to Washington. The original ordem of 29 June from General Donovan to Colonel Carter Ives finally received by me in Algiers on 8 July. I proceeded to Mhshington and arrived on 13 July. 11. During the period April 11 to 6 July I reoeived no clerical help for 085 Italy. I had one Services officer for 038 Italy, and this officer was not assigned to me until six weeks after I took command. Luring the entire period we were badly handicapped by lkok of communioations and transportation. The above facts were brought to the attention of the Commanding Officer, 08S, Mediterreneen, on every semi-mmonthly report and, in addition, in special requests which averaged about once a week. 12. Reports of 08&-Italy were extracted in Algiers and forwarded to Washington, but the oompleto reports were not forwarded to 08$ Washington. This inoludes letters of commendation which were received by 088?Ita2.y on numerous occasions. 13. Wher I left Italy relations between 088.Ita4 and the American and British ov4rnment agencies had improved to such an extent that we were receiving letters of commendation and had been given a status praotiotilly equal to ACC, AUG, and other agencies in the theatre.

Major Angleton reported to me on eAoh case And ritoolved my approval tor the aotinn recommended. The complete prooeedings of this board have boon tranamitted to the Direotor, 08.541 5. During the month of May I spent most of my time making oontaotn with various government ?Mauls in Italy, both British and American, in order to have OSS-Italy given its proper Alma in the general orgAnixiation. I pereonally had the best of relations with the American And Britiph staffs, and AO a result OBS-Italy was completay reoognized by all email's. 6. On May 22, as a reault of the investigations that / was trying to conduct on Italian SI, I had a mooting called in Algiers which resulted in a boare being appointed by Colonel Glavin to inveotigate Italian SI. This board oonaisted or Colonel GlAvin, ex officio, Colonel Carter, Colonel Early, Major Torrielli, Major Chapin, And W. Soamporino, And was to meet at a later date At Sen Imuoio.

On April 11, 1944 I received orders from Colonel Glavin to prooeed to Italy and assume command of OSS?Italy (copy of orders attached). On arrival at Caserta I immediately assumed command of OSS Allied Armies in Italy. On April 12 I activated and organized which consisted of OSS?AAI, OSS?Bari, Italian SI, and activi? ties from Corsica into or from Italy. On April 14 I was notified by telephone that there was a riot of our SI and SO agents in Brindisi. I telephoned Commander Green to proceed to Brindisi, make an investiga? tion, and assume command until my arrival. On April 15 I proceeded to Bari and explained to Lt (dr Green the new organization of OS.,?Italy? inspected the Headquarters, paid my respects to General Twining and General Born, 15th Air Force, held a conference with JICA reference suitable targets for San Marco Battalion. 2. On April 16 I proceeded to Brindisi and investigated the conditions there and the cause of the riot. In Brindisi I found conditions very bad. There was no security, and there were 14 agents lodged in two roomo in the middle of town. These agents had been there as much as three weeks, and most of them had completely blown their cover. I found that Lt Cordell, the CO in Brindisi, was extremely and ordered his hospitalization. Lt Cordell, with the aid of one Cpl and with a jeep that he had borrowed from a friend of his in the 12th Air Force, had been trying to handle all operational activities in the Brindisi area. Lt Cordell had done a superior job under a difficult situation, having no directives and no chain of command to turn to for help. Through his own personal efforts and friends he conducted to the best of his ability all operations out of Brindisi. I immodiately ordered 5 officers into Brindisi area to handle opera? tional activities. 3. Luring the period April 17 to 28 I was paying official calls on General Sir Maitland Wilson, General Lemnitzer? and the staff members of AAI. I also contacted Ambassador Kirk, General McFtrlane, of ACC, General Immell Commanding Naples Area, and visited Forward Echelons of the 5th and 8th Armies. During this period I had numerous administrative difficulties, so I requested a conference with Colonel Glavin and staff in Algiers. This conference was held on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of April, at which time Commander Green was present. It appeared at that time that all parties concerned understood the new organization of OSS?Italy.

DATEt 9 Augunt 1944 At the requeet of Lieutenant Beale, the following comments are made connerning the attached report by Captain Brewster based upon his nix-monhAls' tour of duty with the Labor Desk, Algiers. , 1. The prolonged absence of the head of the desk from,Algiers, noted by Captain Brewster, has now been remPalied Lieutenant, Devoe has been sent to Cairo as desk head there and it is nolOnger,necea- sary for Mr. Koliender to divide his time between Algiers and Cairo. There will be continued occasion, of course, for trips to Bari by Mr. Kollender. However, since the principal activities of,theLa* Desk have now been transferred from Algiers to Bari, these trips ,v -should not be regarded as absenoes from the principal office.' 2. The shortage of administrative personnel, noted by CaptOp Brewster, has now been remedied. The administrative staff in the setup consists of Mr. ol1eder, Mr. Mask, Lieutenant , Perry, and Mr. Clark. This staff i thou at to be adequate for ad- ministrative purposes. 3. During the time Captain Brewster was in NATO4 the following projects of the Labor Doak were in WI active status* Fa A, A, Fern, Ferro, Heine, Lemon, Quail, Redbird,,Rook, sparrow, Stork, Tunic, Weapons. Captain Broweter's report does not, of course, attempt to go into the details GonlernJng each of these projects, but merely mentions those factrs which are regarded by him as the principal ' developments during his tour or duty.

These seemingly =tall items - a few gallons of gasoline and a jeep or two - seriously curtailed our activities and are mentioned to show how completely cur people are depen- dent upon others. Mr. Christian had only recently arrived in Chungking and Colonel Hall spoke most enthusiactically of him. We were unable to contact him, however, since he was not due to met again with Colonel Hall until a few days after I left and because no transportationwas available to get to him in the martime. Colonel Hall had arranged for the rental of EL separate OSS house in town. This has beenteported on fully by Colonel Hall, but essentially it was a means of providing OSS with a house for MA and for Mr. Christian's activities outside of the Valley. It was taken in the name of Lt. Colonel Smith of AGFRTS for reasons of cover. IV. SACO The subject of SACO can properly be put under a heading separate from that of Chungking and comments can b e based almost entirely on my talks with Colonel Hall, Major Wilkinson and several of the other officers. rig*.i44 - Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/25 : CIA-RDP13X00001R000100410002-7 day a * ? ? ?????????

Our men took great delight in the fact that for the men in the Valley assigned to Commodore Miles an invitation to dinner at the OSS house is something to look forward to. Several physical difficulties existed in the Valley however, quite apart from the nature of an outra/g ious climate which/iffected the strength and health of men stationed there too long. /bile I was there and for three weeks prior the generator which supplies electricity for our establishment, as well as that of 2avy, had broken down. This meant that during this period our people were without lights. One of the officers had brought with him a small Army Coleman lamp with five gallons of white gasoline. When I left only a few hours supply was on hand and none was available locally or in Kunming. Inability to get even a few gallons of gasoline to remedy this situa- tion with dispatch, despite the repeated cables, meant that work after dark was largely shut down. The only transportation from the Valley was an old, worn out LaSalle, contributed to OSS by General Tai Li, which spent most of its time in the shop. The only dependable transportation to and from the Valley for our people was pease 2013/09/25 : CIA-RDP13X00001R00010041 ?

The only transportationw as one jeep which Major MacCarthy had borrowed back in February from the 14th Air Force \"for a few weeks\", and which the 14th had since demanded back by August 1. The *Hump\" situation was such that while I understand one or two jeeps finally got over, it was only after many months of waiting and cabling. ,) III.Chungking While at Chungking I stayed at the OSS house in the Valley. Commodore Miles was not in Chungking at the time and I met the MIting Commanding Officer, Commander Wight, in town. Navy courtesy would have required my calling on Commodore Miles but under the circumstances a call was unnecessary. I met Major Wilkinson, the Commanding Officer at Chtip.gking, in Kunming and It ter in Kweilin. My talks with him are summarized later in the report ander SACO. I spent several days in Chungking and talked at length with Colonel Hall and with several of our other officers.

In his absence (Colonel Coughlin was in the United States during my visit to China) Major MacCarthy was Acting Commanding Cffieer at Kunming, while Colonel Peers was Acting Strategic Services Officer for CBI. Major MacCarthy was extremely and embarrassingly shorthanded. His only other off leer, Ensign Wkland, spent six weeks in the hospital and several more weeks at a rest camp with a serious case of jaundice. It meant that Major MacCarthy was the Commanding Officer, the Services officer who arranged transportation north, south and west of Kunming, who read ^nd approved all cables and answered most of them, who met people at the air field and who managed the OSS house in town and the warehouse on the other side of the air strip, who served as mess officer, house committee, reception committee and entertain- ment committee for everyone involved and who did these things alone. The natural result was a partial breakdown in the functioning of the headquarters. Just before I returned to India from China two officers and a few enlisted men from Detachment 101 were sent up by Colonel Peers and conditions were considerably alleviated.
