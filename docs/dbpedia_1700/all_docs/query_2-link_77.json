        "text": "Here’s a Halloween must-buy for particularly hardy listeners.\n\nAleister Crowley, as any good student of the dark arts will know, was an English occultist, poet, spy and general troublemaker. A bête noire throughout the first half of the 20th century, Crowley was known – and, correspondingly, vilified – for his dabblings in ritual magic, diabolist writing and libertinism. His influence as a cult figure on contemporary music has been extensive: he was included on the front cover of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, repeatedly inspired Led Zeppelin and The Doors, and, more times than we can count, proved a key reference point for metal bands the world over.\n\nIn the early 19900s, a collection of Crowley’s songs, incantations and spoken word pieces were recorded onto wax cylinder. Having been transferred onto 78 RPM down the line, they were collected and issued by Current 93 lynchpin David Tibet in 1984 as Original Wax Recordings, and have subsequently seen release in various forms on labels like Transparency, Qanat and Almafame.\n\nThis month, Mr Suit have put out Original Wax Recordings as a new LP edition. The 2013 pressing marks the album’s first foray on vinyl since Tibet’s edition, which was limited to 500 copies. The album also replicates the tracklist of Tibet’s version.\n\nOriginal Wax Recordings is out now. ‘The Call Of The First Aethyr’ is below.\n\nTracklisting:\n\nSide A:\n\n1. Introduction\n\n2. The Call Of The First Aethyr (Enochicin) ~\n\n3. The Coll Of The First Aethyr (English)\n\n4. The Coll Of The Second Aethyr (Enochicxn)\n\n5. The Coll Of The Second Aethyr (English)\n\n6. La Gitano\n\n7. The Pentagram\n\n8. One Sovereign For The Woman\n\n9. The Poet"
