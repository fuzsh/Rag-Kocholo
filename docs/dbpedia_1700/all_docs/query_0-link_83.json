Waltz\n\nMay 28 1943 â March 22, 2012\n\na computer scientist whose early research in information retrieval become fundamental for todayâs Internet search engines, died on Thursday in Princeton, N.J. He was 68.\n\na pioneer in artificial intelligence.\n\nmade fundamental contributions to computer science in areas ranging from computer vision to machine learning.\n\ndevelopment of a basic technique that makes it possible for computers to render three-dimensional scenes accurately.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nRon Palillio\n\nApril 2, 1949- August 14, 2012\n\nFamous for his role as Arnold Horshack on Welcome Back Kotter\n\nAt 14 started his own summer theater in Cheshire, Connecticut which generated revenue\n\nwent to the University of Connecticut at Storrs, where he majored in drama. He appeared in many school plays in college.\n\nShortly after arriving in New York, Ron got a role in the off-Broadway success \"Hot l Baltimore.\" He stayed with the show for over a year.\n\nRon was given a lead role in a musical special, \"The Last Sweet Days of Isaac\", on television.\n\nToured and appeared with Mickey Rooney in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWarren Stevens\n\nNovember 2, 1919-March 27, 2012\n\nHe was a close friend of Gregory Peck and Kenneth Tobey.\n\nIn 2008, he was honored at the 44th. Cinecon Film Festival. He received their Society for Cinephiles Career Achievement Award at a banquet held at the Hollywood and Highland Renaissance Hotel in Hollywood, California.\n\nMember of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences [Actors Branch].\n\nHe made guest appearances on both \"Twilight Zone\" (1959) and \"The Twilight Zone\" (1985).\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nJim Marshall\n\nJuly 29, 1923-April 5, 2012\n\nTribute to Jim Marshall by Robb Lawrence\n\n...His many talents as a dancer, drummer, teacher and driving force behind the legendary amplifiers that bear his name will live on in our hearts.\n\nLes Paul and I had a great time talking when we first met him at the Guitar Center Rock Walk event in 1985. We socialized at the Troubadour and various Namm events over the years. His great stories enlightened me as to how band-mate Mitch Mitchell got his drumming style, Freddie Tavares' Fender 4-10 Bassman amp inspired his amplifying effort, Eric Clapton received the first combo - the famous Bluesbreaker amp (a 4-10 prototype left in Greece), Townshend started using the first 4-12 stacks... along with his friendship with Jimi Hendrix that permanently altered our sonic mindscape forever!\n\nThe amazing tone of the Marshall 4-10 Bluesbreaker amp and tall 4-12 Hendrix cabinet always inspires me to perform with deep soul. I feel fortunate to have filmed an interview he graciously shared for my Modern Les Paul book. This truly gentle giant shined a bright light and glorious tone for all to see and hear in the modern music world. My condolences to his son Terry (who also played with Mitch) and family, and associates including Mitch Colby. Thanks for the cool pic Seymour W. Duncan! Rest in Peace Jim.\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nJonathon Frid\n\nDec 2, 1924-April 13. 2012\n\n____________________\n\nHe has appeared in major roles on-and-off Broadway, in such productions as \"Roar Like A Dove\", \"Murder in the Cathedral\" and \"Wait Until Dark\".\n\nIt was his portrayal of a complex, conflicted vampire on ABC-TV's daytime drama series \"Dark Shadows\" (1966) (co-starring with Joan Bennett) and in the subsequent motion picture House of Dark Shadows (1970) that earned him a place as an icon of American popular culture.\n\nHis other film credits include co-starring roles in The Devil's Daughter (1973) (TV) (with Shelley Winters) and Seizure (1974) (Oliver Stone's directorial debut).\n\nIn 1986, Mr. Frid joined the Broadway production of \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" (co-starring with Jean Stapleton). He won critical acclaim for his villainous turn as the homicidal nephew and spent ten months with the play's national tour.\n\nFounded his own production company, \"Clunes Associates\", to create and tour a series of one-man readers' theater shows across North America.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nDick Clark\n\nNovember 30, 1929-April 18, 2012\n\nGot his first job in the mailroom of WRUN, a radio station in Utica, New York, which was owned by his uncle and managed by his father.\n\nWas promoted to weatherman before becoming a radio announcer.\n\nWorked at several radio and television stations before landing at WFIL radio in 1952. While working at the station, Clark became a substitute host for Bob Horn's Bandstand, an afternoon program where teenagers danced to popular music, broadcast by WFIL's affiliated television station. In 1956, Horn was arrested for drunk driving, giving Clark the perfect opportunity to step in as the full-time host.\n\nIn addition to the name change, Clark added interviews with artists (starting with Elvis Presley), lip-sync performances, and \"Rate-a-Record,\" allowing teens to judge the songs on the show - and giving birth to the popular phrase, \"It's got a good beat and you can dance to it.\" Clark also established a formal dress code, mandating dresses and skirts for the women and a coat and tie for the men.\n\nEnded the \"American Bandstand's\" all-white policy, allowing black artists to perform on the show.\n\nUnder Clark's influence, \"Bandstand\" became one of the most successful and longest-running musical programs, featuring artists including Chuck Berry, the Doors, the Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, and Smokey Robinson. Sonny and Cher, The Jackson 5, Prince, and Aerosmith were among the influential artists and bands that made their television debuts on \"Bandstand\", which is also credited with helping to make America more accepting of rock 'n' roll.\n\nWith the success of \"American Bandstand\", Clark became more invested in the music publishing and recording businesses, and began managing artists, hosting live sock hops, and arranging concert tours. But in 1960, when the United States Senate began investigating \"payola\", the practice in which music producing companies paid broadcasting companies to favor their products, Clark became caught up in the scandal. The investigation found he had partial copyrights to over 150 songs, many of which were featured on his show. Clark denied he was involved in any way, but admitted to accepting a fur and jewelry from a record company president. In the end, the Senate could not find any illegal actions by Clark, but ABC asked Clark to either sell his shares in these companies or leave the network so there was no conflict of interest. He chose to sell and continue on as host of \"American Bandstand\", which was unaffected by the scandal.\n\nmoved Bandstand from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and became more involved in television production. Under his company Dick Clark Productions, he produced such shows as \"Where the Action Is\", \"TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes\", and more recently, \"So You Think You Can Dance\", as well as made-for-television movies including \"Elvis\", \"The Birth of the Beatles\", \"Wild Streets\", and \"The Savage Seven\". Clark also hosted television's \"$10,000 Pyramid\", \"TV Bloopers and Practical Jokes\" (with co-host Ed McMahon), \"Scattergories\", and \"The Other Half\".\n\nhad several radio programs, including \"The Dick Clark National Music Survey\", \"Countdown America\", and \"Rock, Roll & Remember\".\n\nIn 1972, produced and hosted the very first edition of \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\", a musical program where Clark counted down until the New Year ball dropped in Times Square, featuring taped performances from musical artists. \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" soon became a cultural tradition, airing on ABC every year with Clark as host (except in 1999 when ABC aired \"ABC 2000: Today\", a news milestone program hosted by Peter Jennings).\n\nIn December 2004, suffered a minor stroke and was unable to host, so Regis Philbin stepped in as a substitute. The following year, Clark returned as co-host alongside primary host Ryan Seacrest. Many were worried about Clark due to his slurred and breathless speech, and he admitted on-air he was still recovering but that he wouldn't have missed the broadcast for the world. The following year, Seacrest became \"New Year's Rockin' Eve's\" primary host, but Clark always returned for the countdown.\n\nClark has received several notable awards including four Emmy Awards, the Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, and the Peabody Award in 1999.\n\nHe was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1976, The Radio Hall of Fame in 1990, Broadcasting Magazine Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame. Clark had been in St. John's hospital in Los Angeles after undergoing an outpatient procedure the night of April 17, 2012. Clark suffered a massive heart attack following the procedure. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he died the next morning of April 18, 2012.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nAndy Griffith\n\nJune 1, 1926-July 3, 2012\n\nCommonly plays the accoustic guitar and sings folk or gospel songs\n\nMost all of his characters have a folksy, friendly personality\n\nOften recounts classic stories and histories with a folksy point of view.\n\nBoth of his characters have driven 2 separate Ford automobiles: on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" (1960), he drove a Ford Galaxie and on \"Matlock\" (1986), he drove a Ford Crown Victoria.\n\nwas the Tuesday night host for CBS Radio's \"Sears Mystery Theater\" (1979). He was still Tuesday's host when it became \"The Mutual Radio Theater\" on Mutual Radio (1980).\n\nAttended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Music in 1949. He originally attended school to study to be a Moravian preacher before he changed his major.\n\nHe recorded some albums of standup comedy, including one titled \"Just for Laughs\". Among his classic routines is \"What It Was, Was Football\", about a country bumpkin who witnesses his first football game.\n\nmost popular character role of Andy Taylor, on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" (1960), was ranked at number 8 in TV Guide's list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\", in Sunday, June 20th, 2004's issue.\n\nWas twice nominated for Broadway's Tony Award: in 1956, as Best Supporting of Featured Actor (Dramatic) for \"No Time for Sergeants,\" and in 1960 as Best Actor (Musical) for \"Destry Rides Again.\"\n\nDuring a 1959 performance of the Broadway musical \"Destry Rides Again\", in which Griffith starred opposite Dolores Gray, a small fire broke out backstage at the Imperial Theater. Although it was put out within a few minutes time, without causing any major damage, just enough smoke drifted toward the stage that there could have been a panic had not Griffith and Gray continued on with the scene as though nothing was happening. For their bravery, they were rewarded by the audience that night with a standing ovation and by the New York City Fire Comissioner with citations for heroism.\n\nThe town of Mayberry on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" is based upon Andy Griffith's hometown Mount Airy, North Carolina. By the same token, the characters on the show will commonly mention the \"sister city\" of Mount Pilot. Mount Pilot does exist, but its true name is Pilot Mountain, and has the same basic geographical positioning to Mount Airy as Mayberry does to Mount Pilot. The towns in both reality and the series are about 15 miles apart.

She recorded the song in 1967, and it went on to become an even bigger hit for Blood, Sweat and Tears two years later.\n\nIn 1968, with the Supremes struggling to remain at the top of the Billboard charts, Motownâs founder, Berry Gordy, gathered Mr. Wilson and a few other confidants to develop a bolder approach for the group. They came up with âLove Child.â Its taboo-breaking lyrics, about having a child outside marriage, helped propel the song to No. 1 on the pop charts in late 1968.\n\nAfter the Supremesâ lead singer, Diana Ross, left to start a solo career a year later, Mr. Wilson produced the groupâs next album and came up with subsequent Supremes hits like âUp the Ladder to the Roofâ (1970), which he co-wrote, and âStoned Loveâ (1970).\n\nBut in 1974 he had a born-again experience and began holding Bible-study sessions for singers at his house.

Iâve paid my dues, but the advertising and commercial worlds donât call me.â\n\nExplanations for Campbellâs lack of recognition after his victory at the 1956 Melbourne Games was that the Olympics were not televised as extensively as they would later be, he he spent much his career playing football in Canada and he alienated some people with his outspokenness about racial discrimination.\n\nThe Browns cut Campbell the next day. He went to Canada, where he played pro football with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, the Montreal Alouettes and the Toronto Argonauts until 1964.\n\nat Plainfield High School in New Jersey, Campbell was world class in track and a champion swimmer. At Indiana University, he starred in track and football.\n\nExcelled in tennis, bowling, judo, karate and wrestling.\n\nCampbellâs first decathlon came in 1952 in the United States Olympic trials. He finished fifth in the hurdles but made the team in the decathlon. (Later in his career, Campbell returned to the hurdles, setting world records in the indoor 60-yard high hurdles and the outdoor 120 high hurdles in 1957.) His second decathlon came weeks later: while still in high school, he finished second to Mathias in the Helsinki Olympics.\n\nIn 1956, two days before Campbellâs Melbourne competition began, he was visited by Johnson, his teammate and the Olympic favorite. As Campbell recalled for The Star-Ledger of Newark in 2011:\n\nâRafer sat on the bed and said, âSo how do you think this is going to turn out?â And I just said: âThis is a bad year for you to show up. Because this could be your two best days, but Iâm still going to walk away with it.â And Rafer looked at me like I had hit him with a bat.â\n\nCampbellâs prediction was correct. He won that gold medal and set an Olympic record of 7,937 points for the 10 events. Johnson won the silver medal that year; without Campbell as competition, he won the gold in 1960.\n\nHe later became a motivational speaker\n\nCampbell was elected to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1989 and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\n___________________________\n\nTerry Callier\n\nMay 24, 1945 â October 27, 2012\n\nQuote:\n\nâI feel very blessed for my success,â he said. âEverything happens in its own time, and it happened when I could handle it. I didnât have to bend myself out of shape to make a living, I got a position in computer programming, and I put my daughter through college. It couldnât have been any better.â\n\nAmong his friends when he was growing up were Curtis Mayfield and Jerry Butler of the Impressions.\n\nWhile still in high school he recorded for Chess Records, the Chicago blues and R&B label, but his mother persuaded him to stay in school before starting a music career.\n\nSoon after recording a single, âI Donât Want to See Myself (Without You),â which he paidfor himself, in 1982, he quit music and went to work as a programmer at the National Opinion Research Center, an affiliate of the University of Chicago. Meanwhile his music was attracting a cult following among British soul-music collectors and D.J.âs, and around 1990 he got a call from Eddie Piller of the Acid Jazz label, who wanted to reissue âI Donât Want to See Myself.â\n\n_______________________\n\nRay Bradbury\n\n(August 22, 1920 â June 5, 2012\n\nQuote: Sense of humor is everything. You can do anything in this world if you have a sense of humor. Many directors, producers, people haven't learned that -- that if you just salt people down a little and put a bit of butter on them and make them happy, then we can all work together.\n\nHe wrote the original manuscript of \"Fahrenheit 451\" on a rented typewriter in a public library, from handwritten notes and outlines. It first appeared in print in a shortened form (of about 25,000 words) in Galaxy magazine and later in its present length but in serial format in the just starting out Playboy magazine.\n\nThough considered by many to be the greatest science-fiction writer of the of the 20th century, he suffers from a fear of flying and driving. He has never learned to drive, and did not fly in an airplane until October 1982.\n\nNational Public Radio's \"Bradbury 13\" (1984) was a 13-episode program based on many of his stories.\n\nThere is a noted irony in the names of two characters in his novel \"Fahrenheit 451\": \"Montag\" is also the name of a paper mill and \"Faber\" is a manufacturer of pencils. Ray Bradbury insists that this was unintentional.\n\nHis original title for one of his novels was \"The Fireman\". He called his local fire department and asked them what the temperature at which paper burns at - and was told \"451 Fahrenheit\". He reversed it to make it the title of his novel \"Fahrenheit 451\".\n\nHe is the great-great-great grandson of Mary Bradbury, a woman who was tried in the Salem Witch Trials in 1692, but saved herself from being hanged for witchcraft.\n\nHe had a series of short stories which his publisher said would never sell, so he linked the stories together, while living at a local YMCA, and created the novel, \"The Martian Chronicles.\" He was paid just $500 for the story.\n\nHe was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6644 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California.\n\nA hero of his was the Italian director Federico Fellini. When they first met, as Bradbury claims, Fellini ran up to Bradbury, embraced him, and said \"My twin! My twin\". They became great friends but never collaborated on any projects. Bradbury claimed that his lifelong love of Halloween was soured after Fellini died on October 31, 1993.\n\nDespite the anti-censorship message of \"Farenheit 451\", Bradbury has continually had to fight his publisher's censors who want to tamper or alter the language and tone of the book. He says that the irony is obviously lost on them.\n\nIn 1950, he discovered that comic book publisher William M. Gaines (later famous for producing Mad Magazine) had published several of his stories without his permission. Bradbury wrote Gaines a letter praising the artwork and treatment of his story, and politely asked for his royalty payment. He got it.\n\nHe once visited the set of \"Star Trek\" (1966) as a potential writer for the show. Crew members remembered him as being being very polite and courteous, thinking he was already making himself at home. It later turned out that he never had any intention to join the writing team, but wanted to come anyway. He remained friends with series creator Gene Roddenberry until Gene's death.\n\nHad a nod in Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013) with the ship named the Bradbury.\n\nElliott Carter\n\nDecember 11, 1908 â November 5, 2012\n\nQuote: âAs a young man, I harbored the populist idea of writing for the public. I learned that the public didnât care. So I decided to write for myself. Since then, people have gotten interested.â\n\nHe was 103 and had continued to compose into his 11th decade, completing his last piece in August.Music won many awards, including two Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nRefused to be held to deadlines, saying he would release his compositions when he felt they were ready. And for many years he would not accept commissions from orchestras that had not played his earlier music.\n\nHe avoided opera for most of his career because,saying in 1978 âAmerican opera is a novelty, to be played once and thatâs all, even when theyâre good pieces,â and because he doubted he could find a libretto that interested him. Yet when he was 90 he completed his first opera,âWhat Next?â\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nMajor Harris\n\nFebruary 9, 1947 â November 9, 2012\n\nsang with several groups in the 1960s, including the Charmers, the Jarmels and Frankie Lymonâs Teenagers.\n\nIn the early 1970s he replaced Randy Cain in the Delfonics, whose hits âLa-La (Means I Love You)â and âDidnât I (Blow Your Mind This Time)â had helped define the so-called Philadelphia sound.\n\nleft the group in 1974 to pursue a solo career. He recorded a string of rhythm-and-blues singles, most notably âLove Wonât Let Me Wait,â which peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nLarry Hagman\n\nSeptember 21, 1931 â November 23, 2012\n\nQuote:\n\nI was born with success. Lucky for me I am able to handle it. Also, I damn well deserve it!\n\nHad a ring made from the gallstones that were removed during his liver transplant.\n\nServed in the United States Air Force.\n\nHe refused to speak one day a week, simply as a test of his self discipline.\n\nRequired autograph seekers to sing a song for him or tell him a joke before giving his autograph. He said that he did it so he got something back from his fans.\n\nWas once Chairman of the American Cancer Society's Great American Smokeout.\n\nWas a vegetarian.\n\nSon of Mary Martin.\n\nOut of the original cast members of \"Dallas\" (1978), he was the only one that is originally from the state of Texas.\n\nAt his wife's suggestion, he auditioned for the lead role of J.R. Ewing in \"Dallas\" (1978). Fortunately, he won the role.\n\nAlways refused to talk about his role on \"I Dream of Jeannie\" (1965) until 2001.\n\nWas reunited with \"I Dream of Jeannie\" (1965) series' lead, Barbara Eden, for the final season of \"Dallas\" (1978).\n\nWas a spokesperson of American Cancer Society of the 1980s, who encouraged people to quit smoking.\n\nHe played the same character (J.R. Ewing) in three different series: \"Dallas\" (1978), \"Knots Landing\" (1979) and \"Dallas\" (2012).\n\nHis final guest-starring role was on \"Desperate Housewives\" (2004).\n\nWhen \"I Dream of Jeannie\" (1965) began, a crisis cropped up right away: Series star Barbara Eden was pregnant. This forced the quick filming of 10 episodes. Problems developed immediately between him, who was determined to make the show, the best it could be, and director Gene Nelson, who insisted that they follow the script to the letter. Each man wanted the other fired. Due to NBC's preference, Larry prevailed.\n\nHad originally wanted to be a cowboy.\n\nOwned 5 Toyota Prius Hybrids.\n\nDid not reprise his role in 2 \"I Dream of Jeannie\" (1965) reunion movies, because he was busy starring in \"Dallas\" (1978), and was taking a vacation with his family.\n\n_________________________________________"
