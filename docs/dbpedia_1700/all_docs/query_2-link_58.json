Their music draws from Celtic, Balkan, Gypsy, Spanish, Cornish, and other world music traditions. Their live shows have been praised by BBC Radio 2 hosts, and their dynamic style of world folk music will leave you breathless, enthralled, and exhilarated, pronounced the highlight of Glastonbury festival by Mark Radcliffe BBC The Trouble Notes Traditional folk, gritty punk rock and tribal dance, a progressive world folk band known for their explosive energy. Formed in 2013 by violinist Bennet Cerven, their shows are packed full of surprises, adding to the energetic sounds at the heart of their repertoire. Picture yourself in at an awe inspiring venue in serene countryside. The melodies of the violin, guitar, and other instruments resonate through the air. The rhythm is infectious, and you find yourself swaying, tapping your feet, and losing track of time. The energy of the crowd amplifies the experience, leaveing you feeling exhilarated and inspired. Everyone that joins the universe of The Trouble Notes remains a part of it, often morphing from a normal concert-goer into a true Troublemaker Black Friday, a high-energy Celtic folk band from St Germans in Cornwall, UK, delivers an electrifying concert experience. Picture yourself in an open-air festival—the air crackles with anticipation. The six-strong crew plays a foot-stomping mix of home-brew folk-punk and Celtic tunes, influenced by their Irish and Cornish roots. Their original songs and covers (think The Pogues and Flogging Molly) keep the crowd dancing all night. They’ve rocked Europe’s biggest festivals, including Glastonbury, Boomtown, and Electric Picnic. True foxes, an acclaimed folk/americana family duo, are quickly gaining popularity in the South West and beyond. Amie, with her soulful vocals and earworm song writing, has been compared to artists such as Brandi Carlile, Karen Carpenter, and Dolly Parton, accompanied by guitar, ukulele, banjo, and piano. Chloë complements Amie's vocals with ethereal harmonies and melodic bass lines. The duo's sisterly banter adds an emotional dimension to their performances. If you're a fan of First Aid Kit and The Secret Sisters but with a touch of British influence, you'll definitely enjoy True Foxes.Referred to as the \"Hardest working female duo in the South West\" by BBC Introducing, the self-managed True Foxes performed an impressive 140 shows in 2022 and more than doubled that in 2023 with 250 shows. 2024 is already poised to be a busy year for the girls after releasing their highly anticipated debut album 'Howl' in March, and completing a sold out headline UK Tour.
