According to Weezer, they were all ready to tour with Oasis last year but Oasis decided not to return to the U.S. That would have been an epic show! Weezer covers Morning Glory all the time in their live sets too.\n\nbarnafin95\n\nOasis Groupie\n\nPosts: 929\n\nPost by barnafin95 on\n\nTheyre probably just influenced by Oasis, anyway i can imagine Liam hating Weezer!\n\nWell that's me told!\n\nmagicalcharlie\n\nRKid\n\nPosts: 1\n\nPost by magicalcharlie on\n\nboth bands are awesome, would've been an epic tour\n\nNYR\n\nOasis Manager\n\nKing of Spam\n\nServing up sexual chocolate since April 24, 2004\n\nPosts: 15,024\n\nPost by NYR on\n\nweezer are far from being my favorite band, but i love their musical videos. \"buddy holly\" and \"hash pipe\" are phenomenal songs, too.\n\nmanualex\n\nGuest\n\nPost by manualex on\n\nweezer are far from being my favorite band, but i love their musical videos. \"buddy holly\" and \"hash pipe\" are phenomenal songs, too.\n\nI dig their stuff but since the red album I havent heard a string of good songs, Troublemaker, Pork and Beans and Greatest Man that ever live are epic but dunno Rivers has downgraded his quality. I think they need to rethink their game and comeback in 2 years with a new album\n\nsjone65\n\nOasis Roadie\n\nAll Around the World...\n\nPosts: 138\n\nPost by sjone65 on\n\nHurley is great. BTW, a big shocker for me, Weezer, when they were starting to come back in 1999 played under the pseudonym \"Goat Punishment\" for three-ish shows. One of the shows was just \"Definitely Maybe.\" Karl, the official historian says that the band played all of Definitely Maybe in a row and selections from Morning Glory. They love Oasis, and I would've really loved that double billing.\n\nNYR\n\nOasis Manager\n\nKing of Spam\n\nServing up sexual chocolate since April 24, 2004\n\nPosts: 15,024\n\nPost by NYR on\n\nsongbird11\n\nOasis Manager\n\nDig Out Your Soul\n\nPosts: 1,720\n\nPost by songbird11 on\n\nit's sad weezer didn't quit instead of oasis :-)\n\nseymourstein\n\nOasis Roadie\n\nPosts: 186\n\nPost by seymourstein on\n\nWeezer's kinda the American Oasis if you think about it.
