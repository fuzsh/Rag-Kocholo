Morgan has some words of comfort and advice for Sirena, who embarks from the middle of nowhere via a bus to California, still unable to shed her disappointment, while the title song is yet another love song rendered as an introspective metaphor about life at the crossroads.\n\nA good mix from an up-and-coming artist\n\nAnn Claire\n\nHonkytonk Princess\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nNearly eight years after her debut as an E! reality series (Love is in the Heir) star, Princess Ann Claire, the London-born granddaughter of HH Princess Shams of Irans Pahlavi dynasty and the late Shah of Irans great-niece), professionally drops her royal title, comes to Nashville and trades her crown for a debut album.\n\nAs I listened to Honkytonk Princess, all of the above was news to me. The CDs title was not a tip off, since its only significance to me was that it was the title song of this 12 song collection. Only when I later read the projects liner notes and played the accompanying, roughly four and one-quarter minute-long bonus DVD featuring never-before-seen interviews & footage of the making of the record: the road from TV to reality was I brought up to speed on this celebrity whom I thought was another new, unknown artist vying for my attention.\n\nAny project that has Bob Turs backing, as this one does according to the liner notes and DVD credits, is worthy of my consideration, but when an artist doesnt adequately explain the connection, thanks a plastic surgeon by name and acknowledges her corporate sponsors, is a reviewer justified in asking if this is just another instance of a carpetbagger (though one who is now a naturalized American citizen), in this case a princess (with all of sense of entitlement that title suggests) expecting Music Row to give her, pardon the expression, the royal treatment?\n\nAgain, having heard the CD with none of these prejudicial thoughts to ponder, as a lyric-lover, I was struck by the production that, while creative at times, at others renders some of the lyrics unintelligible. With no lyrics list provided, at times I was picking up on only bits and pieces of what some of these songs are about.\n\nBetter Girl is the CDs first singe and video. It is a good, radio-friendly upbeat choice. Lets Go To Mexico might initially have eyes rolling- like the world needs another song in the Jimmy Buffett- Kenny Chesney tradition. Yet how can a listener not love the line expressing the wish to maybe catch a glimpse of Chesney without his hat?\n\nLikewise, Shania Twain fans will also enjoy Go With Me as a line in that songs suggests Ann Claire wonders not what would Jesus do but rather what would Shania say?\n\nRay Stevens\n\nEncyclopedia of Recorded Comedy Music\n\nRating *****\n\nExpanding in 2012 on his 2009 three-disc box set (pictured above) of the same title, Ray releases a nine-disc, 108-song recorded encyclopedia of comedic music.\n\nThis review is of the latter's 12-song sampler, heavily-laden as it is with novelty songs.\n\nThe opener, a reprise of Spike Jones' signature song, Cocktails for Two (written by Arthur Johnson and Sam Coslow), should carry a warning: Don't listen while driving! (I made the mistake of doing so. Though, having been familiar with the original, I should have been prepared for the cacophony of sound that might have resulted in an accident, and perhaps an arrest for distracted driving, had I not instantaneously recognized the sirens et all I was hearing did not necessitate my pulling over and that all I needed to do in the moment was to relax, enjoy the craziness and slightly lower the volume!)\n\nFollowing Ray's rendition of that Big Band era hit, Stevens treats us to his delivery and slight retitling of another (with apologies to Tim Spencer): Cigareets and Whusky and Wild Wild Women.\n\nRay evokes a favorite childhood memory (though this may be the first time I've heard the complete lyrics) with his interpretation of Lonnie Donegan's Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On the Bedpost Overnight), written by Marty Bloom, Ernest Breur and Billy Rose.\n\nAnd why wait for Halloween to listen to Stevens' cover of Gene Simmons' (the solo singer, not KISS' front man Chaim Weitz) Haunted House (written by Robbert Geddins)?\n\nOther highlights? Ray's performances of all of the songs here are great, but the other particular sampler standouts are his takes on such rock era standards as Mr. Custer, Searchin', and They're Coming To Take Me Away Ha Ha, as well as Stevens' standout version of the George Jones classic, White Lightnin' (written by the Big Bopper).\n\nJanie Fricke\n\nCountry Side of Bluegrass\n\nRating **** 1/2\n\nJanie Frickes kicks off 2012 reprising her country hits, and those of other artists, bluegrass-style.\n\nWhile, of late, bluegrass artists have taken an occasional country or pop standard and given it the bluegrass treatment, Janie devotes her entire 13 track CD to the Country Side of Bluegrass.\n\nFricke fans, be they purists or open to experimentation, will likely appreciate Janies reworked versions of You Dont Know Love, Do Me With Love, Hes A Heartache, Shes Single Again, Dont Worry Bout Me Baby, Tell Me A Lie , It Aint Easy Bein Easy, Down To My Last Broken Heart and Frickes 1978 hit cover of Hank Locklins classic, Please Help Me Im Falling (In Love With You).\n\nJanie is blessed with the wisdom to know which of her many hits work when adapted bluegrass-style and, as importantly, those that dont.\n\nStill, this is probably not the album for a listener who is not receptive to evaluating Frickes performances of country classics associated with the original artists, let alone Janies bluegrass rendering of Faithless Love and Ring of Fire.\n\nThe latter, billed as a bonus track, loses a little zip without the horns one associates with Johnny Cashs hit recording. But then Fricke understands that horns and bluegrass dont mix.\n\nMark Wayne Glasmire\n\nRating ****\n\nMark Wayne Glasmire's first release of 2012 is a seven-song EP that features Glasmire's recent singles I Like You and Going Home, as well as some new favorites with which to kick off the New Year.\n\nLast of a Dying Breed, a paean to living one's life with integrity, leads the \"seven-pack.\" The song sets the bar high for the songs that follow and certainly got my attention.\n\nOther highlights: Now I Believe (billed as a \"bonus track,\" it's an impressive showcase for Mark's arresting voice) and The Moment (a song that can't help but appeal to the romantics among us).\n\nThe Topp Twins\n\nUntouchable Girls\n\nRating *****\n\nLeanne Pooleys 2009 award-winning documentary about New Zealands Jools and Lynda Topp, billed as the worlds only yodeling, country-singing, twin lesbian comediennes (though they prefer to be known as singers who are funny), has just been released on DVD.\n\nThe documentary profiles the Taurean twin sisters (born May 14, 1958 in Huntly, located in the Waikato region of the North Island of New Zealand); real cowgirls, who grew up singing to the cows on the familys dairy farm near Huntly.\n\nPatriots with a particular political passion for social justice and nuclear disarmament, Lynda and Jools left home at 17 to join New Zealands rough equivalent of the United States erstwhile Womens Army Corp. Reflecting on their New Zealand military service before it was integrated, Lynda describes the three-month training experience as sort of like a pajama party with guns.\n\nNatural-born entertainers, the twins' harmony singing and comedic bent resulted in their developing a cast of characters including Camp Mother & Camp Leader, Raylene & Brenda, and the cross-dressing Ken and Ken. But the sisters don't flaunt their sexuality so much as embrace it and, as a result, they have a worldwide, mainstream appeal.\n\nAs Comedy Writer Paul Horan says of the Topp Twins, \" On paper they should not work. On paper they should be commercial death. But they totally deliver to the audience time and time again.\n\nIn their native country, the Topps have used humor to both make a point and defuse controversy when they assert their penchant for activism. Such was the case when the twins dealt with their government's position on gay rights: \"The law had said it was illegal for consenting adult males to engage in sex. But it was an injustice. We felt like it was an injustice. We said one day theyll make a law that includes the lesbians. We need to step up to the plate and we need to make sure were part of this homosexual law reform bill.\n\nNeedless to say, they were. As New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark recalls, debate on the bill \"polarized the Parliament I think the Topps being so proudly who they were helped make the issue seem a more mainstream one It had real people associated with it. Good people- like the Topps. And that helped carry the day.\n\nWhen cameras are not capturing the Topp Twins singing, as they are positioned on the front lines of numerous political demonstrations for their favorite causes, Joolie and Lynda are seen clowning around, most famously during their Great New Zealand Gypsy Caravan Tour.\n\nBut life is not all joy, even for the joy-filled Topp Twins (who, for instance, demonstrably inform audiences that \"Yodeling is all about hip movement.\") Should there be any doubt about that, or the fact that the camera never blinks, \"thanks\" to archival film Pooley took full advantage of access to footage of Jools going through chemotherapy for breast cancer.\n\nUntouchable Girls, titled after the Topp Twins' song of the same name, has won more than 20 Best Documentary awards. Non-rated and running 84 minutes, the film has been screened at over 80 international film festivals, winning the Cadillac People's Choice for Best Documentary at its North American premiere during the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nRussell Moore & IIIrd Tyme Out\n\nPrime Tyme\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nWith this collection of 14 potential bluegrass hits, Russell, Steve Dilling, Wayne Benson, Justin Haynes and Edgar Loudermilk prove they are nearly ready for primetime (as in a music performance slot on late night network TV).\n\nThe International Bluegrass Music Association's Vocal Group of the Year winner for seven consecutive years, Moore and his mates' 16th album in 20 years features its bluegrass chart hit single, If Your Heart Should Ever Roll This Way Again.\n\nKentuckians and Montanans will especially enjoy the opening track, a tribute to Old Kentucky Farmers, followed by Goodbye Old Missoula, a bittersweet farewell to Rosie, the object of an unrequited passion, as a new love awaits in Bozeman.\n\nMoon Magic retains the bluegrass flavor of every other song on this CD, while providing some cross-genre stylistic surprises.\n\nThe guys also provide contemporary covers of Sugarfoot Rag and the instrumental, Carroll County Blues.\n\nThey close the album by sounding a populist, yet weary lament in the form of What's the World Coming To. While songwriters Ronnie Bowman and Michael Garris deserve kudos for creating a lyrical reference (and rhyme yet!) to North Platte, Nebraska that is actually singable, the bluegrass equivalent to the sentiments expressed by Merle Haggard in his hit, If We Make It Through December is marred by the scapegoating, simplistic \"solution,\" favored by the ignorant, to all of the world's problems, including greedy \"politicians and Wall-streeters\": Returning (Christian) prayer to the (public) schools.\n\nRicky Skaggs\n\nCountry Hits Bluegrass Style\n\nRating *****\n\nRicky Skaggs has just released a second volume of A Skaggs Family Christmas (Volume Two is a 10-sided CD combined with a Bonus DVD featuring 26 concert performances, released five years following the initial Skaggs Family Christmas album). But since, with very few exceptions as I have previously explained, I don't review Christmas albums, I wanted to at least acknowledge receiving Ricky's latest release while not overlooking Skaggs' most recent, mostly secular release, Country Hits Bluegrass Style.\n\nI can't think of a better reminder of how many top hits (several of them admittedly covers) Skaggs has amassed than to spend some time listening to Skaggs' new bluegrass arrangements of his country (though sometimes bluegrass and gospel-tinged) classics.\n\nThe 14-time Grammy winner was encouraged to pursue his creative approach to reprising the familiar songs when he tried them out during his road to great audience reaction. I have to believe that such acceptance stemmed from Ricky's knowing just how to give the folks a little something extra and unexpected without straying too far from the familiar stains they've come to know and love.\n\nWhile keeping these re-recordings fresh for himself, Ricky delights fans with his instrumental turnarounds as his bluegrass pickin' lifts the spirits and pleasures the ear.\n\nHighlights: Heartbroke, You've Got A Lover, Flatt & Scruggs' Crying My Heart Out Over You, Highway 40 Blues, Porter Wagoner's Uncle Pen, Webb Pierce's I Don't Care While, Country Boy, I Wouldn't Change You If I Could and Don't Get Above Your Raising.\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys\n\nIt's Only Natural\n\nRating ****\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys cant leave a stage without singing Elvira. Likewise, a Cracker Barrel collection of the Oaks hits, and the newer songs they hope will be as well-received, also includes a re-recording of that most famous showcase of Richard Sterbans bass vocal.\n\nFive other Oaks hits are included among the dozen fan favorites. They are True Heart, Gonna Take a Lot of River, No Matter How High, Beyond Those Years and Wish You Could Have Been There and Lucky Moon, along with William Lee Goldens solo project and video hit, Louisiana Red Dirt Road.\n\nThis brings us to the newest material. What Gonna Do? is light-hearted lyrical celebration of commitment that, like Elvira, is a nod to Richard Sterbans signature style and an example of how the group allows not only Duane Allen, but all of the four of the Boys strong vocals to shine. Before I Die is, as its title suggests, about taking stock. The Shade is a similarly sober bit of shared philosophy while Sacrifice For Me is Joe Bonsalls paean to heroism.\n\nJason Michael Carroll\n\nNumbers\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nThe irony of this latest release from the Cracker Barrel collection is that Jason Michael Carroll first sang in public while working as a server at the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's Henderson, North Carolina restaurant. (Had the establishment hired Carrol as a short-order cook, I might be wondering now how Carroll's recently-shorn trademark shoulder-length+ locks fit in a hairnet, but, as it is, Jason's, less-menacing, new clean-shaven look is a hit with this lady!)\n\nI'm not a big fan of disposable music. The title song sounds like a novelty tune written after a brain-storming writers session. Fun on first hearing, the sense that the writers (Rodney Clawson and Patrick Davis) are clearly going for the obvious quickly wears thin.\n\nThis is for the Lonely is a little less predictable and a little more promising.\n\nMeet Me in the Barn is as infectious as it is predictable- and hokey, while Hell or Hallelujah is interesting, primarily for its artful rendering of juxtaposition.\n\nCan I Get an Amen seizes on an overworked expression, occasioning a shout-out to the singer's redneck friends.\n\nMy Favorite is a cut above the average, run-of-the-mill love song.\n\nDon't Know Why is the perfect reflection of, just that, uncertainty.\n\nStray focuses on fear about a relationship while Last Word spotlights that hardheaded couple whom we all know.\n\nNumbers closes with Jason's Top Five tearjerker, Alyssa Lies.\n\nThe McClymonts\n\nWrapped Up Good\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nThe Aussie sister trios sophomore album features three singles (the title song, Kick It Up and Hearts on Fire) that will be new to all but the sister acts longtime fans who follow the Australian music sales charts.\n\nThe other three-quarters of the CD is highlighted by He Used To Love Me, a tongue-in-cheek tale of a spurned womans resolve to drag the man she wants to marry to the altar.\n\nRock the Boat is neither a cover of The Hues Corporations 1974 hit nor Aaliyahs 2001 chart-topper. Rather, its an anthem to individuality and, if need be, telling others where they can go.\n\nNothing beats family vocal harmony, so check this one out!\n\nBrandon James\n\nDown in the Sand\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nA native of Toronto, self-professed \"naturalized citizen of Los Angeles\" Brandon James calls his music, West Coat Country (a/k/a the kind of music that especially appeals to those whose famous last words of reaction to Brandon's stage performances has been \"I'm normally not a country fan but...\").\n\nThis four-song EP opens with James' self-penned, upbeat, musical invitation to join him down at the beach and to relax Down in the Sand (With Me). Beautiful Eyes, (written by Brandon and April Matson), offers a bit of advice from the voice of experience to a friend whose vision of the present is somewhat clouded by past lies.\n\nThe World's On Fire, also written James, is an introspective suggestion on how to deal with brick walls and other matters beyond one's control.\n\nWalk in the Sun (which Brandon wrote with Femke Weiderna and Jason Land) conveys the experience of living the good life in a way which Jimmy Buffett and Kenny Chesney could appreciate.\n\nMichael Mandella\n\nAmerican Outlaw\n\nRating ***\n\nSinger/songwriter Michael Mandellas first album in 10 years marks a musical rebirth, of sorts, detailed in the autobiographical lyrics of I Miss Em, a song Michael co-wrote with one of his favorite co-writers, Eddie Cunningham (Cunningham either wrote or co-wrote 10 of the 11 songs on American Outlaw.)\n\nWhile there is no title song, American Outlaw typifies Mandelas musical persona. But, if a listener were somehow to miss that point, songs such as Big Damn Star, Room Number Eight and Lead Guitar are replete with lyrical namechecks of Michaels music mentors.\n\nDespite the namedropping, these selections are among the albums standouts.\n\nBuff, hatted and thoroughly tatted, Michaels voice has a gruffness one would expect from the hard-living about which he sings.\n\nMusic Man, a song Michael wrote with Conrad Murphy and Clark Murphy, while not a candidate for a persuasive copyright infringement suit, is entertaining but only in the same way as equally good songs sounding the same theme.\n\nProud American suffers from the same corporate sound, while resurrecting (no pun intended) the twisted assumption of similar songs suggesting that patriotism has, not only an intrinsic link to Christianity, but an exclusive tie.\n\nRonnie Milsap\n\nCountry Again\n\nRating **** 1/2\n\nRonnie Milsaps first album in five years effort is a blend of new songs and standards.\n\nAdvance publicity for the 12-track release pegged If You Dont Want Me To (The Freeze) as the CDs first single with a video showcasing a dance (hence the songs subtitle), inspired by the song.\n\nThe upbeat, infectious number not only has a radio-friendly lyrical bounce, it reminds those of us who gave up our piano lessons at the first opportunity that we may have learned to play as well as Ronnie and Catherine Marx had we persevered.\n\nThe title song will please those who enjoy not only a well-crafted lyric but who also have an appreciation for modern production values and musicianship, a selling point of several of the songs comprising Country Again.\n\nOf the songs on the new side of the ledger, Im partial to Almost Mine (a David Ball-Randy Goodrum ballad), though Ronnie does justice to all of the material here.\n\nJohnny Paycheck and Foster & Rice fans will give a thumbs up to Ronnies rendition of For A Minute There, while I can visualize Bobby Darin thanking Ronnie for reviving Youre the Reason Im Living in a manner that shows respect for the original recording.\n\nLikewise, I would think Jimmy Newman and J.D Miller would tip their hats to Milsap in appreciation of Ronnies recording of Newmans signature song, Cry, Cry Darlin.\n\nThis is an eclectic package, rather than the stone country impression one who has not heard the title song might infer from the CDs title, but it has a little something for everyone who enjoys Ronnie Milsaps music.\n\nRoyal Wade Kimes\n\nCrossing the Roads\n\nRating **** 1/2\n\nRoyal Wade Kimes is country musics most underrated singer/songwriters.\n\nCrossing the Roads only underscores that observation, Billboard chart hits being the yardstick that frustrates those who see other methods of measuring music that resonates.\n\nWhether in a bow to the realities of commerce, or a desire to be consistent in offering his fans good songs, Kimes leads off the first of 13 tracks found here with a cover of Five Hundred Miles so credible that, if a listener had never heard Bobby Bares classic recording (which Bare penned with Charley Williams and Hedy West) nor that of the Kingston Trio and numerous others who have recorded the song, one would swear Kimes was the definitive version.\n\nI rather think Elvis Presley would have liked Royal Wades version of Donnie Summers Mr. Songman, just as those who find meaning in Amazing Grace will find Kimes version as compelling as any theyve ever heard.\n\nBut Royal Wade Kimes is hardly a cover artist. He had a hand in writing or co-writing 10 of the 13 songs on Crossing the Roads. These originals are all worthy of a listeners time and attention.\n\nIm an Ole Song is already an international favorite. As of this writing it is the #5 song on the Top 50 Pop Country Roots Music Chart and #2 on the Top 40 Hot Disc Chart in Europe and Australia. Love is the focus of several of the other selections, be it wistful, true, lost or a temptation best avoided.\n\nIn My Land will serve as the rallying cry for not only gun-toting NRA members but also anyone who shares Kimes interpretation of the Bill of Rights, especially the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nMy favorite of all the songs Royal Wade wrote for this CD, however, is Kimes' commentary on where many of the idealists among us were, politically, socially, and culturally in 1969, as he answers in song the contemporary question those who not only remember the 60s, but who embraced the religion of flower power, must ask themselves 42 years later: Hows it workin for ya?\n\nThe Roys\n\nLonesome Whistle\n\nRating ****\n\nDownloaded music may be supplanting CDs, but theres something to be said for the experience of removing the shrink wrap (well, not that part of it, but ) from The Roys CD while popping Lonesome Whistle into your idling cars CD player and, as you do so, noticing that the jewel case cover art of the sister-brother duo folds out into a same-side, six-sectioned lyric sheet and song commentary (with an additional photo of the duo) that, when reversed, becomes a 9 ½ x 14 inch poster of Lee and Elaine.\n\nReleasing the cars brake, you resume your ride to the strains of The Roys hit, Coal Minin Man, a jaunty tribute that screams movie soundtrack to me.\n\nThats What Makes It Love sounds like a Ricky Skaggs song and that is probably all the inducement Ricky and The Whites needed to join The Roys in performance of a song that, in actuality, Lee co-wrote with Morry Trent.\n\nNothing I Can Do About it Now is a spirited song of coming to terms with what you cant change. Right Back At You twists a popular expression into what Mel Tillis might call sweet mental revenge.\n\nSpeaking (writing?) of popular expressions, Give A Ride to the Devil seems to have been inspired by some axiom that I should not be hearing here for the first time. But a Google search of the phrase, coupled with the rest of the line about what happens if you do provide the Devil that ride (Someday hes gonna wanna drive) suggests that is not the case. However, the hook and lyrics of my favorite of the 11 songs found here is (co)written (by Robert Ellis Orrall and Lee Roy with more humor and greater universality than some of the more preachy songs that round out Lonesome Whistle.\n\nThe title song is a train tune that might have received Johnny Cashs blessing. Everything I Ever Wanted (with its surprise ending) could serve as the musical theme for a public service announcement. (To be more specific would require a spoiler alert.)\n\nTrailblazer, written by Elaine, Steve Dean and Bethany Dean, is a 21st century feminist anthem for even those women who balk at being labeled feminists, while the CD ends on a positive note with a bit of musical philosophy (and the only song among these that The Roys didnt have a hand in writing): Tia Sillers and Pete Sallis High Road.\n\nBlind Boys of Alabama\n\nTake the High Road\n\nRating *****\n\nTake the High Road. There could not be a more fitting title for this sextets latest CD (to be released May 3, 2011.)\n\nJamey Johnson (yes, that Jamey Johnson), along with co-producers Chris Goldsmith, Kevin Grantt and Chad Cromwell have captured the Blind Boys  upbeat, infectious group sound- and basically run with it!\n\nAnd no, thats not the extent of Jameys input. Johnson is featured on Have Thine Own Way, Lord.\n\nA Bakers Dozen of cuts leads off with The Oak Ridge Boys joining the Blind Boys on the title cut. The all-star guest list continues with Lee Ann Womack joining in on I Was a Burden and Vince Gills featured performance of Can You Give Me a Drink?\n\nWillie Nelson reprises Family Bible while the Blind Boys enlist Hank Williams, Jr. paying tribute to Hank, Sr. with a rousing performance of I Saw the Light.\n\nThe Blind Boys and their star-powered guests spread the Good News with such joy that the happiness they radiate becomes part of the listening experience.\n\nKenny Rogers\n\nFor the Love of God\n\nRating **** 1/2\n\nWhat an incredible album this has turned out to be.\n\nSo writes Kenny Rogers in the liner of his first Southern Gospel CD ((Rogers second Cracker Barrel song collection). Kenny, who has recorded Christmas music, writes of his personal relationship with each of the 12 songs, be they traditional favorites (Will the Circle Be Unbroken, What A Friend We Have in Jesus, Amazing Grace, perhaps Kennys nearly a cappella version of Leaning on the Everlasting Arms) or more contemporary choices such as The Rock of Your Love (written by Al Anderson, Vince Gill and Leslie Satcher) and Grace (written by Michael W. Smith and Martin Smith).\n\nKenny is joined by Winfields Locket on In the Sweet By and By, The Whites on Ill Fly Away, and by Point of Grace on Circle of Love, but the performances I most enjoyed were the For the Love of God and (especially) Peace (the latter written by Beth Nielsen Chapman and Michael McDonald).\n\nThis CD strikes me as the perfect match of singer and song(s). If you love the mix of traditional and modern Southern Gospel, or if you are simply the penultimate fan of Kenny Rogers singing whatever he chooses, this CD is for you.\n\nThe Grascals & Friends\n\nRating ****\n\nThe Grascals & Friends: Country Classics with a Bluegrass Spin is not only this CDs full title, it is a descriptive yet concise Twitter-age review.\n\nThe Grascals need no introduction and neither do the more than a dozen friends with whom they harmonize, as most of the recruits are country artists whose names you know. And yes, the Grascals and Friends do perform nearly a dozen songs that could be considered country classics with a bluegrass spin, along with an instrumental titled Cracker Barrel Swing and I Am Strong (the latter reprised in a slightly different form, as a bonus track, than the first performance heard here).\n\nThe CD kicks off with a strong guest performance by Brad Paisley doing his best Buck Owens tribute on Tiger by the Tail. Next up is Dierks Bentley's interpretation of Folsom Prison Blues. I suppose if Johnny Cash could lift Folsom... from Gordon Jenkins Crescent City Blues that it could be argued that Bentley offers a credible cover, but Cashs indelible nuances and the singular musicianship of the Tennessee Two (and later Three) is so ingrained in my memory that I cant say tinkering here isnt actually tampering.\n\nJust as, for reasons fair or unfair, Bentley's Folsom... didnt work for me, Im trying to fathom the wisdom of a Born to Boogie/All My Rowdy Friends Are Comin Over Tonight medley sans Hank Williams, Jr. The lyrics of Hanks hits are so personalized, for The Grascals or anyone else to record them- even in medley form- makes no sense to me.\n\nContrast these observations with Darryl Worleys spot-on performance of White Lightning. (Perhaps George Jones had another commitment? Regardless, my guess is The Possum would share my enthusiasm for Worleys rendition.)\n\nNot surprisingly, Dolly Parton nails Pain of Lovin You (with Terry Eldredges able assistance, in the absence of the late Porter Wagoner) It is Parton, in fact, who is featured on the previously-mentioned I Am Strong, a song written from the composite point-of-view of a St. Judes Childrens Research Hospital patient (with a portion of the proceeds from the song earmarked for St. Judes), represented by the heart-tugging vocal performance of three-year-old Ansley McLaurin.\n\nOn the bonus track rendition of I Am Strong, presumably executed through the magic of combining separately-recorded audio tracks, Ashley and Dolly reprise the resolute anthem of critically-ill children, this time teaming with the Grascals lead vocalist Jamie Johnson, The Oak Ridge Boys, Worley, Charlie Daniels, Terri Clark, Randy Owen, Joe Nichols, Tom T. Hall and Steven Seagal.\n\nWith the added star-power of their friends, the Grascals have zoomed up the Billboard charts, not only reaching #23 on the Top Country Album chart, but commanding the #1 Top Bluegrass Album position for three consecutive weeks!\n\nThe Grascals & Friends is available exclusively at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store® and online here.\n\nMatt Bailie\n\nRating ***\n\nMatt has a distinctive voice that ironically sounds like a blend of many established country-music stylists.\n\nWhile Bailie acknowledges the influence of the Van Zants (Donnie and Johnny) on his music, Im hearing less 38 Special and Lynyrd Skynyrd in Matts music than- well, I dont want to be repetitious, judge for yourself.\n\nTrue, Donnie and Matt co-wrote Man Behind These Eyes, the lead off song. A tale of a man in search of his father, this attention-getter is quite possibly the best song on a CD of decent songs, all of which Bailie had a hand in writing.\n\nI also enjoyed the song Matt proclaims the story of my life, Great To Be Alive. While similarities could be drawn between that song (co-written with Jan Linville) and the Travis Tritt hit, Great Day To Be Alive (written by Darrell Scott) the songs are not too close for comfort.\n\nJanet McGarry & Wildwood\n\nRating ***\n\nJanet McGarry & Wildwood (Serge Bernard, Naomi Doncaster, Kyle Legere) treat fans to a blend of 15 songs, old and new.\n\nWith the assistance of Troy Engle, Heather Berry and Tony Mabe, there is an abundance of respected bluegrass musicianship about which to brag here.\n\nTraditionalists will not be disappointed by Janets version of Gloryland, just as I was amazed that McGarry could make My Heart Has a Mind of Mind of Its Own (yes, the Howie Greenfield and Jack Keller standard one would think no one but Connie Francis could pull off and certainly not with a banjo backbeat) her own.\n\nThe rest of the performances are equally strong, but the other songs are lyrically rather ordinary. Theyre not bad. They just dont stand out, so, in that sense, whether its the title song or the others not mentioned The Next Train misses the boat.\n\nDr. Elmo's Bluegrass Christmas\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nFor Christian bluegrassers there's fun and a bit of inspirational listening to be had with Dr. Elmo's Bluegrass Christmas. Dr. Elmo spreads the seasonal joy and humor, with Christmas favorites, old and new. He and Gary Potterton add a measure of good pickin', especially on instrumental versions of Greensleeves, December Rain, and Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer.\n\nThanks to this collection, Elmo's \"Grandpa\" is not forgotten as the singer reminisces about favorite Christmases starring Grandpa in the Santa Suit Show.\n\nGuy Penrod\n\nBreathe Deep\n\nRating ****\n\nWith a bakers dozen songs (including the CDs title selection) from which to choose, one might ask why Are You The One (also found here) is Guy Penrods debut country single.\n\nOf course, that is not a question anyone who has heard Guys performance of the Tammy Hyler and Shaye Smith-pen song will ask. Are You The One, an introspective, rhetorical questioning of parental responsibility and values, is easily the standout release of the 13 songs of inspiration here.\n\nPenrod, late of the Gaither Vocal Band, offers up contenders for follow-up singles. These include the album opener, Even When We Do (about the joy of religion-centered wedded bliss), the infectious Pray About Everything (a musical variation of the adage Let go. Let G-d., The People That Matter (an otherwise self-explanatory affirmation of what should be most obvious among our priorities) and Young Enough to Know Better (a source of support for those struggling with the desire to remain abstinent).\n\nMessage music is most effective when it is subtle. Every Saint has a great hook, but its blend of radio-friendly story-song and preachiness is one best reserved for a church service. Some of the other songs are interesting slice-of-life morality plays, but they sound like commissioned material that breaks no new musical ground.\n\nPenrod walks a fine line with one foot in the secular market and the other still planted in gospel. In the instances that Ive cited that work, hes been able to keep both feet planted firmly on the ground. With respect to the others and, going forward, Guy needs to be mindful that if mass market appeal is his goal, his inspirational themes ought to stress the most universal aspects of religious morality (that Penrod has proven he can do so well) rather than the divisive, sectarian dogma that is becoming largely passé in country music (except for obligatory Christmas releases), as the genre strives for a multicultural following.\n\nMichael Sarver\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nWhen a singer owes his career to American Idol, and lands a recording contract after placing 10th in the eighth season of the programs finals, a jaded, veteran music critic is going to set the bar quite high.\n\nWhether fans will be as critical has yet to be seen, but, at 29, Michael Sarver, to take a line from the strong opening song, Watch Me, suggests skeptics wont hold him down (this small-town boy whose dreams transcend the county line) because its my time.\n\nAlways Surviving, another well-written selection, strikes a similar tone.\n\nFerris Wheel may do more for the amusement park ride than any song since Freddy Cannons Palisades Park.\n\nWere that all of the material were as strong: The chorus to the otherwise uninspired Im in the Mood sounds like a self-involved, castrated males oxymoronic mating call. Let Me Love You is not much better, typifying much of the filler here, the lyrics of which seem to draw on familiar country-music themes best communicated in past chart-toppers..\n\nTeam Sarver has chosen the final song, You Are, as the first single. But Tell Me, an abandoned sons message to his father, is much more compelling\n\nThe cover art to this self-titled CD (my advance copy, anyway) suggests a rush job. How else to explain that there are 13 songs listed when, in fact, this CD, without apparent bonus cuts or other extras, has 14 tracks?\n\nGary P. Nunn\n\nTaking Texas to the Country\n\nRating *****\n\nIf you were as lucky as I was during the early 70s to see Joan Baez perform on your college campus, you know the joy of hearing someone who can actually sing, singing lyrics you can actually understand, with a musical accompaniment that neither drowns out the artist nor blasts your ears. You also have an appreciation for Gary P. Nunns approach to making records.\n\nT hose of us who have followed Nunn since his recording of London Homesick Blues (courtesy of public TVs Austin City Limits) have come to respect Garry for his directness and simplicity. So it is refreshing that Taking Texas to the Country doesnt involve a lot of bells and whistles, merely an appreciation of what Nunns core audience wants.\n\nTheres really not a bad selection among the 13 here. Déjà Vu provides a jaunty, jocular opening that should find fans singing along while providing just the proper inspiration and instruction for any songwriter challenged to write about classic country themes in a new and entertaining way. The title song, road-tested by Gary and his Bunkhouse Band, is a musical statement of a mission: To bring the Texas-based music loved by fans of Bob Wills & the Texas Playboys, Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson (all name-checked here) to Nunns own while having fun and making money.\n\nMerles fans may be surprised that Its Not Love (But Its Not Bad) is not a cover of Haggards 1972 hit single. One wonders, however dissimilar the actual songs of the same name, if Garys title will catch the attention of Hank Cochran, who, along with Grady Martin, co-wrote the Haggard hit.\n\nOther tracks are familiar Texas Swing and Texas Two-Step fare, theres even a bit of Cajun music and a hint of Jamaican reggae here, but my favorite are Im Not That Kind of Guy (about a gent who lays his cards on the line) and The Likes of Me (a celebration of differences).\n\n2010 is only almost half over, but, for the reasons Ive mentioned, Taking Texas to the Country gets my vote for the best country-music album of the year- so far\n\nThe Kathy Kallick Band\n\nBetween the Hollow and the High-Rise\n\nRating *****\n\nThe Kathy Kallick Band (who are guitarist/lead and harmony vocalist Kathy Kallick, Kallicks fellow harmony vocalists,- Dobro and banjoist Greg Booth and fiddler Annie Staninec- plus acoustic bassist Dan Booth and Tom Bekeny on mandolin who trade lead vocals with each other and with Kathy) are the future of bluegrass.\n\nKathys lyrics give a contemporary lift to music that endures as it pays homage to its storied past. Where Chris Gantry wrote of the Dreams of the Everyday Housewife, Kathys My House is a song that speaks to the modern working womans leaky sink full of dirty dishes, the houses peeling paint and, if she can bear to consider the thought, even a broken window.\n\nWith 14 songs with which to please the bands fans (and also to justify the title of the CD), there are reminders of, and bows to, the traditional bluegrass sound that bring those who grew up in the hollow to the high-rise. They include excellent renditions of traditional bluegrass favorites including Theres A Higher Power, Lonesome Night, Come Walk With Me, and a great updated and rewritten version of White House Blues the quintet calls New White House Blues (given its name-checking presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Alan Greenspan and even Rush Limbaugh and Bill OReilly.\n\nTheres also the bands take on a song I always thought was more folk or mountain than specifically bluegrass- (Get Along Home) Cindy- but with additional lyrics I guess it is now!\n\nPanhandle Rag and a couple of original pace-changing instrumentals complete the package: Greg Booths Monobrow and Tom Bekenys Winterlight Aire.\n\nPlunder: The Crime of Our Time\n\nRating ****\n\nVeteran Emmy award-winning network (ABC, CNN) news producer (and author) Danny Schecter has produced/directed a 100 minute video (excluding bonus footage) as a companion to his book, The Crime of Our Time: Why Wall Street is Not Too Big to Jail.\n\nUsing archival film, animation (as in Larry King Alive!) and multi-genre musical soundtrack, Schecter dissects Wall Street fraud through conversations with the players (e.g., former Bear Stearns, Chase Bank and Goldman Sachs employees), investors and protesters in a manner that is both entertaining and understandable.\n\nDanny surveys the buying, selling and insuring of fraudulent mortgages, concluding that the bedrock of the whole process is crime. Yet, Schecter charges, the story is not being told by Americas cable networks business and news channels nor its daily newspapers.\n\nFurther, Danny opines the media (which, by definition is NOT monolithic) has been co-opted. This has resulted, Schecter believes, in what he calls (a cadre of) Wall Street-embedded (business) journalists whose focus on, for example, Bernie Madoffs $65 million Ponzi scheme misses the point.\n\nFor Danny believes that while focusing on Madoff puts a face on evil, it obfuscates the larger issue which is an estimated total of $171 that has suddenly disappeared from a country where 70 per cent of the wealth is owned by one percent of the people.\n\nAmid all of the outrage over the bailouts following liars loans, We need a jailout, Schecter opines.\n\nIt might be suggested that Dannys blaming media, mainstream and otherwise, for the financial crisis is an oversimplified easy out. While I would recommend this DVD for the factual information, Schecters featuring of say, Jesse Jackson (who seems to insert himself into everything even vaguely political), whose refusal to make the finances of his Rainbow Coalition transparent, suggests an alliance that may not exist.\n\nThe soundtrack, with titles such as Plunder, Speechless!, Free Money Blues, The Economy Bailout Song, Nobody Wants My Debt Anymore, I Love Subprime and on and on, adds the necessary elements of parody and/or dark humor here.\n\nThe DVD's extras, including Sex Addiction on Wall Street, are intriguing, too.\n\nFurther information is available here, here, here, and here.\n\nMarty Rabon\n\nAt His Best\n\nRating **** 1/2\n\nShenandoahs former lead singer, if he must be still so identified, is nearly at his best performing these 11 sides. Any equivocation evinced by the qualifier nearly references not Marty Raybons superb performances, but rather the weakness of some of the material.\n\nMarty simply loves to entertain and to emote- and it shows on record as well as on stage. Ill be he is equally passionate about his music when simply rehearsing. Marty sings what he knows  and Raybon is not a bad songwriter, either, having co-written almost half of the songs here. One of these Still My Little Man (Mattys Song), Marty co-wrote with Peter McCann as a tribute to Raybons soldier son.\n\nThats The Only Way, probably the best song on the CD, is a reminder of the importance of self-knowledge and integrity, while The Change is an introspective, close second.\n\nMarty delivers The Heat is On in such a way that the music, the lyrics and the production fuse, appropriately building to the musical equivalent of a haunting yet frenzied burst of sexual energy.\n\nBig Pain is a pretty convincing hurtin song, but the evident hit, Daddy Phone, strikes me as mawkish contrivance, while I Dont Want to Lose You Anna (set in, predictably, Louisiana) simply sounds contrived.\n\nStill, in all, this is a \"must\" album for Marty Raybon fans.\n\nThe Grascals\n\nThe Famous Lefty Flynn's\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nSonny Osborne's liner notes tend to make any comments of mine (or any other reviewer for that matter) seem superfluous.\n\nReflecting on the Grascals following a trend of other bluegrassers whove been covering 60s pop tunes of late, Sonny writes that the sextet, with the release of The Famous Lefty Flynns, has recorded some songs that will put you in another orbit. Last Train to Clarksville is enough for me but theres so much more.\n\nWhat could be interpreted as a left-handed compliment from Sonny, if not a concession to the popularity of music out of Osbornes orbit, comes with praise for including covers of Bobby and Sonny Osbornes hits: Up This Hill and Down is a song I thought no one could ever get the feel for but they did Son of A Sawmill Man is hard to do because it is so fast but they did it.\n\nThe Grascals fourth album also features the groups rendition of Steve Earles My Old Friend the Blues and, with the assistance of Hank Williams, Jr., a 21st century recording of Im Blue, Im Lonesome. (Hank Williams and Bill Monroe shared writers credits on this one.)\n\nThe banjo of the Grascals newest (and only female) group member, two-time IBMA Banjo Player of the Year honoree Kristin Scott Benson, is prominently featured on all 12 performances found here, including the title song (a story-song tribute to a legendary prison inmate, told from the perspective of an admiring co-conspirator).\n\nSatan and Grandma will impress Christians and amuse non-Christians, while the Grascals revival (no pun intended) of the public domain chestnut, Give Me Jesus, will likewise please the largest segment of the Grascals audience, perpetuating religious exclusivity at a time when a bow to diversity would be more helpful in expanding its fan base.\n\nShy Blakeman\n\nLong Distance Man\n\nRating ***\n\nIf Waylon Jennings had not already sired a son who seems to be following in his (mother, Jessi Colters and) late dads footsteps, he might have claimed Shy Blakeman.\n\nWhile the Texas singer-songwriter also claims The Black Crowes and Ray Charles as his musical influences, Waymores specter even extends to Blakemans choice of producers:, Ted Russell Kamp (whose credits include, yes, Shooter Jennings).\n\nShys opener, The Kamp-penned title song is a bit of bravado Waylon might easily have recorded as is the track that follows, So Many Honky Tonks.\n\nBut with musicians such as Marc Ford and Audley Freed lending credence to Blakemans Crowes connection and other all-star musicians (Doug Pettibone, Kenny Vaughn, Jason Sutter, Don Dziubla and Gia Ciambotti contributing their time and talent, this is hardly a Waylon Jennings tribute album.\n\nNot that remakes are totally absent. Shy shines on his reprise of the Rusty Wier hit, Dont It Make You Wanna Dance.\n\nThen again, Quarter to Three is not a remake of the Gary U.S. Bonds classic but rather a brassy, ballsy, bluesy self-indulgent slightly gospel-infused rocker written by the Warren Brothers and Rob Stoney.\n\nLikewise, Living Proof is not the cover of a Hank Williams, Jr. hit and listener wont be thinking of Jeanne Pruett as Blakemore goes full-throttle on Willis Alan Ramseys daydream of sorts, Satin Sheets (Rest assured, John Volinkatys heirs will NOT be suing for copyright infringement).\n\nThose who like their music rollicking, rockin, raucous and sometimes with a touch of the blues, will find that Long Distance Man does not disappoint. For Shy Blakeman is anything but- well, shy!\n\nSteve Palmer Band\n\nApparition\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nThe Steve Palmer Bands debut album positions the quintet (Palmer, lead vocalist and guitarist; Bryan Ewald, lead guitarist; Anthony Setola, bass, musical director; Larry Hall, keyboards and B3; Tony Morra on drums) among 2010 newcomers worthy of your attention.\n\nPalmer, who co-produced (with David Huff) and wrote each of these 12 songs released on his own label, is the driving force and focal point for a tight band of musicians who, along with background singers Vicki Hampton and Cindy Walker, enhance Steves performances.\n\nPalmer takes universal musical themes and personalizes them in a way that is somewhat revealing, but sometimes a little guarded to the point that listeners are forced to rely on their own interpretations. While this is par for the course with much music of the Americana genre, this reviewer prefers the in your face approach .\n\nYet, from his musical articulation of the burden of Living a Lie to the stark reality of Never Gonna See Her Again, Steves music provides the proverbial window to the soul, his often subtle style notwithstanding. The title song is a message from a potential suitor to a prospect weighed down by personal baggage, while I Think I Am In Love is a celebration of new love and moxie.\n\nThe music of the Steve Palmer band hits just the right note at the intersection of rock and country. Palmers is easily one of the most entertaining groups Ive heard in 2010.\n\nMichelle Turley\n\nDance With Me Tonight\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nSinger/songwriter/keyboardist Michelle Turleys album is a family affair. Michelle co-writes with her producer (who just happens to be her brother) and looks to her husband and mother for additional inspiration. (Daddy is apparently posthumously immortalized in one of the songs, despite his daughter's apparently feeling conflicted about him due to memories of abuse.)\n\nAs the listener scours the list of song titles on Dance With Me, it would be erroneous to conclude that Michelle is covering 60s hits. For I Understand is not the old Hermans Hermits hit, it is Turleys lyrical acknowledgment, based on experience, that some lessons must be learned firsthand. And Bus Stop is not Michelles version of The Hollies hit, but rather a slice-of-life musical metaphor for the various forms of fortune.\n\nWhile the title song suits the singer, its the albums opening song and another positioned toward the end that bring cohesiveness to the project. Caroline provides a geographical setting for a story-song that is reprised near the close. Add to this a familiar, rousing instrumental train tribute, in the form of, as Michelle titles fusion of original writing with a special country-music standard, Caroline (in Orange Blossoms).\n\nTurley has an affinity for occasional falsetto, just short of a yodel, and her music will be of particular interest to fans who would like to hear a singer whose voice conjures comparison to what is best described as a blend of the artistry of Margo Smith and Christy Lane.\n\nGary Allan\n\nGet Off on the Pain\n\nRating **** 1/2\n\nGary Allan is one of the most underrated of country-musics established talents.\n\nGarys music has long been overshadowed by his personal life, but there has always seemed to be a convergence of the singers turbulent private life with his music and/or his persona.\n\nFor Gary Allan sported the threatening tattooed bikers look `long before tatts became a generational fashion statement for many who are young enough to be Garys children.\n\nThe masochistic appeal of the title song suggests Bill Luther, Brett James and Justin Weaver set out to write a Gary Allan song; one in which the protagonist interrupts his pity party just long enough to voluntarily take responsibility for his actions.\n\nGarys brooding, bad boy image is played out in several of these songs, redeemed as it arguably is by the saving grace of a somewhat oxymoronic tender vulnerability.\n\nIn Gary Allans musical world, women are usually at the center of the recording artists frustration or occasional despondency. These attitudes are occasionally offset by the swagger and assertiveness typified by the mildly sexist lyrics of That Aint Gonna Fly.\n\nToday is a song of jealousy and immaturity. The hostile imagery of its lyrics suggests a powerful emotion is not limited to the double entendre evinced by the title of Kiss Me When Im Down and begs the question, assuming its authenticity, amid the self-indulgence of yet another selection (Along the Way) \"When will Gary Allan grow up?\".\n\nWe Fly By Night is an upbeat sexual celebration; one of the albums concessions to country radio (others include When You Give Yourself Away and the somewhat supposedly autobiographical tribute to a special lady: She Gets Me).\n\nNo Regrets, a charitable bit of introspection, is an ideal closer to the ten songs available on the standard issue of Get Off On the Pain. Those who opt for the deluxe version will enjoy Long Summer Days as well as live versions of Right Where I Need to Be, Best I Ever Had and Watching Airplanes.\n\nThe latter underscore the strong connection between Gary and his fans and provide the best examples of Garys captivating performances that suggest a total entertainer at his best.\n\nBecky Schlegel\n\nDandelion\n\nRating ****\n\nBecky Schlegels latest CD is a bakers dozen of self-written songs produced by Becky and her manager, Brian Fesler. (Fesler also contributes his musicianship to the project. Thats Brian listeners hear on banjo, acoustic and electric guitar.)\n\nAnna, the opener, is a story-song of fractured domesticity that Becky delivers with an appropriately haunting tone. The title song is a metaphor of wistful frustration.\n\nAll of Beckys songs capture a certain imagery, several retaining the esoteric quality I commented upon when reviewing Schlegels For All the World To See.\n\nColorado Line (a song of regret about the one the protagonist left behind), Dont Leave It Up To Me (a plea for parity in a relationship) and I Never Loved You Cowboy (self-explanatory, no doubt, but requiring clarification for the rodeo rider who has seemingly missed the point) feature Randy Kohrs on harmony vocals. Randy returns to add not only harmony vocals but also the sound of his resonator guitar on So Embarrassing, a tale of what ensues when one of the parties to a relationship is caught off-guard.\n\nBeckys creativity shines on this venture and, unlike many songwriters, her vocals are strong enough for her to possibly be her songs best interpreter.\n\nDandelion was engineered by Matthew Zimmerman at Minneapolis Wild Sound Studio.\n\nMike Schikora\n\nThis Cowboy's In Love\n\nRating ****\n\nMike Schikora may be a cowboy, hat, horse named JB and all, but if This Cowboys in Love (a bow to the title song?) is cowboy music, it must be cowboy music for the 21st century, as there are only bits and pieces suggesting a throwback to the singing cowboy era of yesteryear.\n\nMike wouldnt have to evoke Muddy Waters name in Long Way From Where Ive Been (the first of 12 songs Schikora either wrote or co-wrote here)- though he does- for it to take me too long to conclude that Mike's kind of cowboy music is at least equal parts blues (Check out Be Good To Me) and/or sometimes country.\n\nHoot Hester and Hargus \"Pig\" Robbins lead the list of impressive musicians assisting Schikora (who provides his own background vocals) with this project.\n\nMike produced this CD and also assisted Zane Baxter with the arrangements.The songs are uniformly pleasant. All have their moments and some seem to coax the listener to sing along, though be advised that Run Like the Wind is not a cover of the old Christopher Cross hit.\n\nAs far as hit material, that might depend on if the world is ready for yet another song titled Blue Heartache. Then again, with the right promotion, Come Closing Time, Pour Me Back Down and Be Good To Me could be contenders.\n\nJosh Turner\n\nHaywire (Deluxe Edition)\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nPerhaps the first order of business should be to explain that Deluxe Edition, in this case, refers to four tracks not found on the standard-issue 11-song Haywire CD and two video downloads (an interview with Josh and Turners Why Dont We Just Dance video). The four bonus songs include This Kind of Love, Lets Find A Church (a song recorded during Turners 2003 Long Black Train sessions, but only released seven years later), and live recordings of Long Black Train and Your Man.\n\nJosh Turner fans, who have yet to buy either version of Haywire, dont need me to tell them that, if they can afford the couple of extra bucks to spring for the deluxe edition, it will be well worth it. For the casual Turner fan, the recommendation to buy either version or neither is less certain.\n\nThats because Joshs latest album (counting two editions of this one alone, imports etc., Im more hesitant than others to put a release number on it), while one that offers (on both editions) Turner's hit, Why Dont We Just Dance and, at this writing perhaps the next one (the label favorite, Your Smile), while, it has its moments (notably, Why Dont We Just Dance and Joshs cover of the Don Williams classic, I Wouldnt Be A Man) several songs seem to fall into a pattern of sameness established by Turners choice of material on earlier albums.\n\nThe insipid choice of the lyrically-silly Eye Candy (which concedes that a lovers kisses, while, aint nutritious, are delicious) all but pulls down the rest of this CD with it.\n\nI applaud Turner for his strong convictions, positive attitude and insistence on recording songs that uplift and inspire rather than those that degrade or otherwise send a destructive message. To the extent he has proven that it can be done I give Haywire high marks, but I hope his next up for the inability to find an albums worth of consistently good, new, innovative material. effort will not rely as heavily as this one does on covering and rerecording past hits to cover.\n\nBill Anderson\n\nSongwriter\n\nRating ****\n\nHaving not heard a new Bill Anderson album in years (Thanks for adding me to your promotional mailing list, Bill!), I expected from the title of this one and a glance at the unfamiliar titles of these 12 songs that I was in for a less-than-routine listening session; one perhaps where Bill would take the role of the reluctant songplugger intent on expressing his innermost thoughts while searching for a convergence of the esoteric and commercial.\n\nSince Im not sure what my role would be in such a scenario, Im glad Bills effort relieves us both of those respective responsibilities.\n\nThe initial track, It Aint My Job To Tote Your Monkey (which Bill co-wrote with Rivers Rutherford and Andersons co-producer Rex Schnelle) immediately strikes listeners as not your typical Bill Anderson song. That was my first impression. But, then again, it might be a song I could have written if Bill commissioned me to write a ditty that combined the popularity of Po Folks and Peel Me A 'Nanner.\n\nBill co-wrote all of these songs, variously assisted by Rex (who engineered, mixed, mastered as well as played and sang background), Jamie Johnson, Buddy Cannon, Jon Randall, Brad Paisley, Barry Dean, Tim Nichols, Joshua Ragsdale, Bobby Tomerlin, Jim Martin, Gordy Sampson, Coley McCabe, John Wiggins, Billy Montana and Brad Crisler. (Thats Paisleys electric guitar you hear on If You Cant Make Money- an Anderson/Paisley/Randall cut I dont see being covered by a female artist.)\n\nWherever She Is is interesting in that same, vaguely misogynous, way in that it's not the sort of song co-writers Anderson, Martin and Tomberlin would have pitched to Conway Twitty. (Twitty often said that the secret to his success was Conway's refusal to record a song with lyrics that put a woman -as opposed to, say, lay a woman- down.)\n\nAndersons songwriting has always intrigued me. Bill has written and/or performed some of the best- and unfortunately, especially when he panders, worst- songs I have ever heard. Rarely have I encountered a songwriter/performer who hits both extremes. (Perhaps because Bill's best choices are so good, as with other capable songwriters, it is disappointing to listen to lyrics that sound calculating, personifying the person the writer may have been at one time but is no longer, or just not up to a writers demonstrated capabilities. In fairness, artist/songwriters typically deliver a series of consecutive singles and/or albums that are terrific, before the rigors of the road, the pressures of topping themselves, adjusting to a new lifestyle, the loss of identity or whatever, reduce their writing and/or song choices to caricature.)\n\nMore talented, ambitious and self-aware than the average hit songwriter, Bill has enjoyed an all-but-unprecedented successive career as a songwriter who co-writes. But, since Anderson's best work has historically been his own, I hope hell consider removing the security blanket.\n\nFor, while several of these songs ignite creative sparks, there are only three I dont feel like Ive heard before: The Songwriters (Andersons and Sampsons paean to tunesmiths, the tribute is both well-written and executed as well as refreshingly humorous, unlike more intense efforts to lyrically cover the same ground), Thats When the Fight Broke Out and Some Kind of War.Thats When the Fight Broke Out, while repetitive and, like an old and/or corny joke, predictable in spots, is a jocular, comedic Anderson/Schnelle cowrite that adds to the variety of material here.\n\nSome Kind of War, written by Bill, Coley and John, vys with The Songwriters for the most gripping song on this album (perhaps depending upon ones mood). It is the lyrical reminder that we all need from time-to-time of what former Nashville radio-TV news and talk personality Ruth Ann Leach (now philanthropist and occasional public speaker Ruth Ann Harnisch) refers to in her speeches as our \"own private hell; that incident, or series or incidents or perhaps time, in our past or present, that is so sad, traumatizing, debilitating or worse that, if we do not keep it secret, remains difficult to address even if we dont consider it inappropriate conversation between us and those we know less than intimately.\n\nIn Andersons world, this negative corner of my life, as Bill might put it, need not be quite as hidden so much as unapparent. The point expressed, so much more succinctly than I am doing, is that its not necessarily necessary that we know what roads our fellow travelers have walked- or are walking. Rather, and more important than learning the specifics sought by a gossip, we can take it on faith that if someones behavior appears inexplicable, atypical, inappropriate to the situation or otherwise extreme- it doesnt mean there isnt the provocation that might surface were we insightful enough, and possibly not so wrapped up in ourselves, to ask the right questions.\n\nRandy Kohrs\n\nQuicksand\n\nRating ****\n\nRandy Kohrs calls his music a mixture of blues, country, bluegrass and Americana.\n\nIt is all of that- and more.\n\nKohrs delivers 13 songs, several of which are as attention-getting as his cornucopia of musical influences. The title cut brings this home as Randys credible covers of Del Reeves Its Been So Long, Webb Pierces This Must Be the Bottom and Tom T. Halls revisionist take on John Henry (More About John Henry) makes this old music new again, to a brand new generation of listeners, while not alienating those of us who remember the originals..\n\nKohrs really shines, though, as he evokes the imagery of a young man dressing in Sunday Clothes and, on perhaps the most unusual and well-written song on this CD, a social commentary of the anti-eminent domain variety: Trumans Vision. (Yes, thats as in Harry S.)\n\nLiz Talley\n\nMore Than Satisfied\n\nRating *****\n\nOf the twelve tracks, including the title song (the title of which summarizes my reaction to this collection), the rousing Bump Bounce Boogie, and Liz duet with Tony Booth (remember him?) on a Billy Yates-Jerry Salley song (What We Dont Have), I have a few favorites of my own: These include Talleys take on Leona Williams The Way It Was and Liz' reprise of Im Not That Good At Goodbyes ( perhaps even Stella Parton agrees, a standard deserving a cover rendition at least every decade or so, that it might be introduced to a new generation of listeners).\n\nBut perhaps the most innovative recording here is Johnny Getting Out of Jail Barbeque. If youll recall, it was a perhaps apocryphal barbecue (depending upon the source), that resulted in Johnny Rodriguez heading for jail (for the first time), so this song has nothing to do with Rodriguez. Rather, its a creative tale about an unusual gig, with a narrative from the entertainments perspective. (Road-weary and otherwise struggling musicians will want to buy Liz CD based on this story-song alone!)\n\nIf the surname Talley makes you thing of James or Lewis, realize that, in addition to her loyal U.S. following, Liz receives a lot of attention and sales overseas. Ill be going back to Germany in March with Martha Moore and a couple of Texas acts Hopefully with time, Ill get some opening act spots or increased sales.\n\nI expect both for Liz in 2010. Shes easily made one of the best CDs Ive heard in 2009!\n\nNathan Lee\n\nRisk Everything\n\nRating ****\n\nIf youve a 12th & Porter regular, youre no stranger to Nathan Lees music. A tattoo collector, Nathan Lee, is no longer homeless, though his personal struggles factor into the autobiographical lyrics, as well as the personal philosophy, permeating the lyrics of these 11 self-penned (or co-written) tracks. (Something to keep in mind lest you, scanning the titles of song selections, think that Still, a song Lee co-wrote with Paul Moak, is a Bill Anderson cover.)\n\nIts hard to classify Nathans music, though it is in keeping with one whose musical persona is that of Hallmark cards & hand grenades,\" \"rainbows & razor blades and on and on. Lees vocals suggest a raspy, growling mixture best described as Rod Stewart meets Bob Seeger meets Kenny Rogers.\n\nNathan is clearly a thinker and one with an ability to turn a phrase. Theres a little gospel, a little Christian imagery, and a lot of introspection in these lyrics.\n\nIts hard to pick out any particular song that will drive this album, though the infectious, Open Road (Yes, for all his raspiness, Lee can hit a high note) is the perfect opener.\n\nDavid Nail\n\nI'm About To Come Alive\n\nRating ****\n\nThis 11-song CDs title track may not become a classic, but it is a well-written addition to music of the classic dont give up on me theme of many country songs.\n\nIndeed, it sets the mood for the following selection, one with which David Nails fans are already familiar, given the hit status of Red Light, again, an interesting lyrical twist on the traditional leavin (or, in this case, being left) country song.\n\nLookin For a Good Time is the title of a song that comes close to that of an Alan Jackson hit, but its interesting take on the realities of casual sex seems more suited to Davids ability to address the concepts of introspection and growth than to Jacksons shy, laid-back persona.\n\nSummer Job Days sounds more like a song Kenny Chesney may have written or had on hold. (In reality, the song was written by Neil Thrasher, Dulaney and Gary LeVox.) This is especially intriguing in that Kenny co-wrote (with Scooter Carusoe), the almost equally-nostalgic Turning Home, seemingly for David who wrote about his own roots in the Show Me state, Missouri.\n\nBut my hands-down favorite on a CD of several good songs is one that David co-wrote with Scooter: Clouds got my attention with a brilliant lyric espousing a philosophy that many women probably havent considered and dont necessarily want to hear, but this guys song lays it on the line, if you want to know the truth.\n\nAs with most of the other songs on this CD- and how could I resist saying so?- Davids nailed it!\n\nSean Walsh and the National Reserve\n\nHomesick\n\nRating ** 1/2\n\nSean Walsh & the National Reserve are a Brooklyn-based group (with members, apparently, whose number exceeds the number of fingers on both hands) that have a style all their own.\n\nThats not to say I fully understand their music, described as being steeped in Americana tradition. Thats because, even with a second listen, some of the songs seem to be overpowered by the mix.\n\nThe listener feels robbed, but not sure whom to hold responsible: Kyle Slick Johnson engineered and mixed Lovesick, co-producing the album with Walsh. In any event, Sean is obviously content with his choices because hes released Lovesick on Lovers Dream, Walshs own label.\n\nI enjoyed what I could clearly hear, notably My Dizzy Head, the theme of which is suggested by its title and a rockin hand-clapper titled You Know.\n\nCathy-Anne McClintock\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nFormer Tumbleweed singer/songwriter Cathy-Anne McClintocks self-titled CD is much-anticipated by fans of the Canadian bluegrass band. McClintocks newest ensemble effort (hubby Steven produces, daughter Tessa sings harmony, as do Trisha Gagnon, Eric Uglum and Matt Borden) also features Alan Doyle and the songs of David Fertitta, Larry Wayne Clark and others.\n\nMcClintocks inclusion of I Wanna Live Like That , a pleasant, upbeat duet (one of two, featuring Tim OBrien) proves that Cathy-Ann continues to embrace the bluegrass sensibilities that have brought these 13-songs being marketed as folk/Americana/country to the fore.\n\nHighlights include No Matter What (I like the wisdom and willingness to take a stand suggested in the lyrics and well as McClintocks rendering of the song) and Strong Enough (Cathy-Anne, as protagonist, projects an artful display of crabbiness, somehow making such an emotional display an almost endearing quality.)\n\nHey, a song of attitude, is puzzling in that it contains the four-letter alternative to the word excrement. Unfortunately, this all but(t) guarantees either radio censorship or an edited radio version of an unnecessary diversion from lyrics that are powerful enough without evoking a reaction suggesting that, even in the 21st century, behavioral double standards still rule.\n\nBest song found here? That would be So American, an artfully-written commentary that Bob Dylan might have written had Dylan been channeling John Mellancamp . (Indeed, how many songs can you name that conceptualize serial monogamy while name-checking Ben Bradlees better-half/Quinn Bradlees mom, the equally-famous-in-her-own-right, Sally Quinn and Page Six favorite, Steve Wynn?)\n\nHollis Brown\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nBob Dylan fans know the name Hollis Brown. So do those who have followed the indy quartet for years. (Check out the groups Running Out of Range released in 2000.)\n\nHollis Browns new self-titled CD (featuring Passin' Me By) has been heralded by both MTV and CMT. Such convergence commands respect that music critics appreciate, as should music fans, whether or not the bands energized, hard-driving sound appeals to those beyond a certain age.\n\nHollis Brown is Jon Bonilla (lead guitar), Mike Montali (vocals, guitar), Mike Graves (drums) and Michael Woscyk (bass).\n\nAll 11 songs were written by Jon and Mike. Best bets (especially for those who are more CMT than MTV): Walk on Water and Carolina, Carolina\n\nBryan Ragsdale\n\nWhere Cowpokes Grow\n\nRating ***\n\nNothing in Bryan Ragsdales Luck Media bio suggests any kinship to Ray Stevens (née Harold Ray Ragsdale), so Ill assume there is none.\n\nIndeed, Bryans music is less suited to Stevens style than to say Michael Martin Murphy. Listeners instantly get the feeling that if Bryan didnt cut these largely western songs first, Riders in the Sky, or singers of yesteryear ranging from Moe Bandy to Rex Allen, Jr. might have chart career resurgences.\n\nActually, Ragsdale has done all right for himself, building on the success of his 2007 debut album Wyoming Melodies with this CD and the debut single from it, Modern Day Mountain Man.\n\nThe single was wisely chosen since it is easily the most radio-friendly song on this 13-song CD, though Im sure many will enjoy the title song or any number of the other recordings found here.\n\nLooking at the list of tracks, I couldnt help but notice #13: Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Surely, there can only be only song by that title, I thought (sometimes its not good that you cant copyright a title), but how would it fare alongside the largely cowboy titles like Hes A Cowboy and A Cowboy Lives?\n\nActually, the musical departure suggests some versatility, as Ragsdale keeps Judy Garlands wistfulness while changing a line or two to make his rendition truly Bryans song (Apologies to Brian Piccolo fans. I couldnt resist!)\n\nAirwaves\n\nRating **\n\nThis self-titled EP features the music of Brooklyn-based songwriter/vocalist/guitarist Nicole Schneit and her group.\n\nNicole is a promising songwriter- she wrote each of the five songs featured here- but as a singer I can only charitably call her a stylist.\n\nThats not a slam if Schneits music is to reviewed the same way one might critique Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson or many other songwriters who record but are not really singers. However, when I can hear Nicoles lyrics over what is at times overpowering production, Im still giving points largely to what is impressive musicianship\n\nNicoles vocals sounded flat and off-key when I heard the first track Gems, which, frankly, sounded more like an assault on my ears than- well, a gem.\n\nThanks to shared vocals with drummer Dave Ferraro, Ryan Trott (on bass and guitar) and Chester Gwazda (the albums producer), Lightning is a vast improvement.\n\nThe other songs here are OK, but maybe by shifting lead vocals and recording its next CD in a Nashville studio (this one was recorded in Baltimore), Airwaves will make me more of a fan.\n\nTanya Tucker\n\nMy Turn\n\nRating *****\n\nBy now most of Tanya Tuckers fans are aware that Tuckers cut a dozen country standards for a record label imprint as a one-off project. They know that these covers of hits, ranging from Faron Youngs recording of Wine Me Up to Merle Haggards Ramblin Fever, are songs that Tanya believes honor the memory of her father Beau (a/k/a Bo), who loved traditional country music.\n\nThey may not know, however, that while no one twists Tuckers arm, she had to be persuaded to go this musical direction.\n\nWhen I interviewed Tanya at entertainment law attorney Jim Zumwalts office July 8th, Tucker told me she was six songs into a Greg Brown-produced album of new material when Pete Anderson called her out of the blue I asked Greg to call [Pete] back [but Greg] never did.\n\nSo I called Pete back and I said Whatve ya got? He told me and I still was a little hesitant because I was more into coming out with something new, but then I met with Jim Zumwalt and he put it into laymans terms for me.\"\n\nZumwalts practicality impressed Tucker, ultimately winning out because Saguaro Road Records, while hardly a household name, packs the muscle of its Time-Life association in the all-important areas of marketing and distribution.\n\nIn the end, Tanya told me  Im so glad I made the decision to do it because working with Time-Life has been a real walk in the park. Compared to all of my other record labels put together, they have done more for me already than any of them have They listen to suggestions and they actually do something about them.\n\nListeners are the real winners, however. While Tanyas pairing with Jim Lauderdale on Loves Gonna Live Here Again wont bring back Buck Owens and Don Rich, its the next best thing.\n\nSimilarly, while Tanya and The Grascals are no Conway and Loretta, they bring off an entertaining yet respectful interpretation of After the Fire is Gone.\n\nTanya and Rhonda Vincent also offer a respectful rendition of You Dont Know Me that I think both Cindy Walker and Eddy Arnold would have thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nEven the staunchest Wynn Stewart fan will admit that Tucker and Jo-El Sonnier do justice to Big, Big Love, while Charley Pride and Ben Peters would concede that Is Anybody Goin to San Antone remains in good hands, despite the improbable combination of Tanya Tucker and Flaco Jimenez bringing back that classic.\n\nWisely, Tanya does not try to mimic Lefty Frizzell in her recording of I Love You a Thousand Ways, thus averting the potential disaster inherent in all of these mens songs Tanya has either feminized or otherwise made her own.\n\nSafe to say, comparisons to the originals are impossible and therefore pointless. This reviewer has chosen another standard by which to judge. The broad standard is entertainment value, broken down to include style, production and substance.\n\nIf youre a fan of Tanya Tucker, and/or if the original recordings that inspired these choices hold a special place in your heart, youll grant Tanyas handwritten wish, as expressed in this CDs cover art: I want you to love this CD!!\n\nJohn Flynn\n\nAmerica's Waiting\n\nRating ****\n\nIf Garth Brooks and Neil Diamond combined voices and wrote what used to be called protest songs and folk music, adding the story songs of Tom T. Hall, the intensity of Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, or Kris Kristofferson, you might mistake their voices and pens for John Flynns.\n\nThe title tune of 11 self-written songs John offers for our consideration immediately strikes the listener as a train song with a twist (a bit of panoramic patriotism as viewed from a train window) Johnny Cash would die for, were he alive today.\n\nA well-connected singer/songwriter who needs no introduction to Kristofferson, is produced by Steve Fishell and who has hired a pair of rather expensive backup singers in the form of guest appearances by Kim Carnes and Elizabeth Cook, John keeps his performances interesting as his music explores several different themes.\n\nThe Passunder (New Orleans) is a respectful reminder that Hurricane Katrina packed a wallop that continues to resonate (sometimes to unexpected effect) among those most affected and that the rest of us really cant look away even in 2009.\n\nThe Prodigal Father strikes the listener as another lyrical standout until the final verse and chorus which leaves the listener with regret: I thought John wasnt going there.\" Taking the obvious tack in this instance can only be described as highly unoriginal, pandering songwriting.\n\nThis bit of disappointment assures me a clear favorite among Flynns songs. That would be Semper Fi, proving you dont have to be a Marine to appreciate an Iraq war-era tribute to those whose experience typifies both the best and at least one of the worst aspects of military service.\n\nDaisy Mallory\n\nRating *** 1/2\n\nDaisy Mallorys self-titled EP will inevitably invite comparisons to Taylor Swift if only because, at 16, Daisy is an amazing singer/songwriter/guitarist who has already come to the attention of Rod Essig, Henry Neuman, the folks at PLA Media and other industry types.\n\nThe five songs here provide a great introduction to a teen with a great future ahead of her. Posin, a young womans assessment of a relationships future based on the discordant intentions of parties to it, is the obvious single here. Whether the song becomes the hit it deserves to be seems contingent upon Daisy securing a label deal (although Mallorys myspace following and a street team associated with it could prove me wrong). However, Ive already decided on the natural follow-up: the autobiographical Daddys Boots, the curly-haired redheads personal reminiscence, but one that will spark a similar personal early memory upon listeners first hearing.\n\nCharlie Faye\n\nWilson St\n\nRating ****\n\nMusic Row has been waiting for someone of Charlie Fayes ilk since- well, when Charley McClain stopped having hits!\n\nFaye goes McClain one better, though: Charleys hits were largely written by, as in the title of one of her hits, men. As a result, the lyrics to McClains hits were rather stylistically presumptuous, while Faye is either the co-writer or sole writer (conceding that Charlies co-writers are Will Sexton and background vocalist Philip Gibbs) of the 10 songs found here.\n\nCharlies vocals are refreshingly clear and closer to the alto range than those of the screechy soprano sirens who often dominate the country charts. While some of the songs are bit esoteric (none of them explain the significance of the title, which is that it involves a story that takes a paragraph to explain, the upshot being that Wilson Street in Austin is Charlies old stomping grounds), Lady of the Leading Man has all the elements of a classic.\n\nWhen I heard Jersey Pride it reminded me of My Homes In Alabama in the sense that, while I am neither an Easterner nor a native-born Southerner, let alone from New Jersey or Alabama, you cant hear either of these songs without feeling the pride of those who hail from those regions and wishing you were one of them.\n\nThe albums only sour note is its cover. Charlie Fayes talent alone sells these songs. Why in the post-feminist era of 2009 is Faye compromisingly-photographed in skin-tight attire, hands clasped behind her back, legs draped virtually spread eagle, or otherwise, around a record player?\n\nJohnny Bulford\n\nLivin' It Up\n\nRating ***\n\nJohnny Bulford sounds like a cross between Moe Bandy and James Taylor. Johnnys songs, with themes of growing up, being dumped and grudgingly maturing, limit the comparisons to Bandy and Taylor- both old enough to be Bulfords father- and are winning Johnny his own following.\n\nA Colgate Country Showdown grand prize winner, Johnny is being marketed via publicity releases that troublingly-tout his endorsement deals as readily as Bulfords singing and songwriting. Its all part of an unsettling scene that, at age 23, Johnny should call a halt to, lest the focus shift from what could be a promising career.\n\nBest cuts: The title song, Remember the Brave (a timely military tribute) and The Real World (a slackers witty realization that, even though society respects a hard-won sheepskin, it covets a strong work ethic over, say, generation-based self-indulgence).\n\nTina Guo\n\nAutumn Winds\n\nRating *****\n\nTina Guos music is not country, but she doesnt consider that an insult any more than my divulging that Autumn Winds doesnt boast any moving lyrics.\n\nThats because the 23-year-old producer/performer/arranger/recording artist is a classical/multi-genre electric cellist and the 10 selections found on Autumn Winds are all instrumentals spotlighting Tinas unique artistry.\n\nWhether interpreting the work of the masters (such as Johann Sebastian Bachs Air) or introducing her own (A Song With No Words, co-written by Tinas co-producer/engineer, Thomas Baraka DiCandia), Guo will make many fans with this CD.\n\nOther notable selections here include Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakovs (The Tragedy of) the Bumble-Bee (evoking memories of the legendary composers Flight of the Bumblebee) and the instantly-familiar Jesu, Joy of Mans Desiring.\n\nRichard Jaymes\n\nDollar and A Dream\n\nRating ***\n\nOver the years there has been no shortage of neither dollar and/nor dream-themed country-music songs. But Richard Jaymes has written and recorded a contemporary take on Main Street's response to Wall Street in a manner that would get Horatio Alger's notice.\n\nWhile I have yet to hear the album of the same name, its title song (one version of which is absent the other's fiddle mix) spotlights Richard's energetic style as it suggests to listeners a bit of optimism available to anyone, even in these hardest of times, when all they may have is A Dollar and A Dream.\n\nRoy Rogers\n\nSplit Decision\n\nRating **** 1/2\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;MAP NAME=&amp;quot;boxmap-p8&amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;AREA SHAPE=&amp;quot;RECT&amp;quot;

And, in this instance, as Martha Stewart might say, that is a good thing.\n\nThis multi-talented Roy Rogers could probably hold his own as a singing cowboy, but the songs he sings, writes, and co-writes are more along the lines of his commiseration with Donna Johnston which the duo aptly title Patron Saint of Pain. (How can you not love their warning to a woman who has mortgaged her soul that she is being pushed to extremes?)\n\nRod Serling would surely appreciate Requiem for a Heavyweight and when the CDs instrumentals (Your Sweet Embrace and Walkin the Levee) werent taking me to another dimension, I was enjoying Holy Ghost Moan, the albums closer, which finds writers Rogers, Dave Gionfriddo and Steve Gordon challenging listeners to Listen to the Holy Ghost narrate all your dreams.\n\nRichard Jaymes\n\nDollar and a Dream\n\nRating ***\n\nHaving previously reviewed the title single, Im breaking a self-imposed rule and reviewing Richards album only because I think its important that fans not limit their perception of Jaymes capabilities, as they often do re: those whose careers are either jumpstarted or given momentum by novelty numbers.\n\nAs previously noted, Dollar is smartly written with a timelessness that transcends the novelty category, but the single gives no hint of Jaymes musical range. The nine other songs here suggest that range is considerable.\n\nRichards style suggests many musical influences and an ear for a lyric that is evident in these songs, all of which he has written alone or with the mysterious W. Pauley.\n\nWhether Jaymes assumes the persona of a guy on the make (Sweet Southern Girl), a lover scorned (Four Leaf Clover), or a rebel (Never Learn), he demonstrates impressive vocal versatility and promise as a songwriter, given his approach to classic themes.\n\nSpring Creek\n\nWay Up on a Mountain\n\nRating **** 1/2\n\nSpring Creek, a bluegrass festival favorite, formed five years ago. Most recently the quartet (Chris Elliott on banjo, Jessica Smith playing a mean upright bass, Guitarist Taylor Sims and Alex Johnstone mandolin and fiddle) caught Rebel Records' attention.\n\nDeservedly so, since these grassers bring a special excitement to their unique sound. From trading lead and harmony vocals to surprising listeners with a couple of change-of-pace instrumentals and the musicianship of Michael Cleveland and Sandy Van Meter thrown into the mix, Spring Creek's contemporary sound signals that this ain't your daddy's bluegrass.\n\nOf course, your daddy might disagree, particularly when he gives a thumbs up to the quartet's version of Bill Monroe's recording of In Despair.\n\nThen again, I don't know what Baker Knight would make of Spring Creek's cover of Ricky Nelson's hit, Lonesome Town, but I thought it was great!\n\nWhat would a bluegrass album be without a \"little darlin'\" song? Better, if you ask me. But, for those who don't ask, It's Alright My Darlin' will fill the bill.\n\nThe album's title is derived from My Love Is Way Up On A Mountain, the first of a dozen performances, many of which will have fans counting the days till the May 5th release of Way Up on a Mountain.\n\nWyatt Easterling\n\nWhere This River Goes\n\nRating ***1/2\n\nEasterling teams with producer Celeste Krenz to make music that teams intelligent lyrics and streams-of-consciousness thought-patterns with complimentary melodies. The amalgam is often pure poetry of the Americana or what used to be called folk-country variety.\n\nWith a little help from Jessi Colter (billed here as Jessi Colter Jennings), Sonny LeMaire, John Scott Sherrill and others, Wyatt draws on lyrical and/or vocal support and inspiration for nine of these 10 songs that Easterling either wrote or cowrote. The strongest of these are the title song, Modern Day Drifter and Fireflies and Whippoorwills.\n\nWyatt's cover of Tony Joe White's classic, Rainy Night in Georgia, isn't bad, either!\n\nCarolyn Currie\n\nWaves of Silence\n\nRating ** 1/2\n\nNot to be confused with Andres Condon's 2004 CD, Carolyn Currie's Waves of Silence may be best termed Maine's answer to Nanci Griffith at her ethereal best.\n\nThat is to say, Carolyn's distinctive voice and what I would call \"insistent lyrics\"- lines that demand your rapt attention, lest the meaning be totally lost on you- demand an emotional investment that a distracted, hook, or melody-oriented listener may be unable and/or unwilling to make.\n\nEven if a listener is intent on making that investment, there should be gratitude for the lyric sheet packaged with the CD, since what is at times overpowering production distracts where it should assist in conveying what, in some cases, turn out to be some very powerful, if simple messages.\n\nCarolyn fuses poetry with inspiration that is sometimes populist in nature, but other times maddeningly exclusionary, due to what seems to be an esoteric creativity that for listeners is akin to wanting to be privy to what sounds like it might be a good story.\n\nThe first half dozen of the 11 songs found here I could easily do without. The lyrics seemed like they might be compelling, but again, all I could make out was snatches. (A subsequent read of the lyrics showed a talent for writing songs- Carolyn wrote all 11- but nothing really new in the messages of these first six.)\n\nThank goodness reviewers don't listen to an opening line(s) and then toss the CD. Cut seven (Kaleidoscope) either had me listening more intently (if that was possible) or I was beginning to get it. The imagery was all that I might hope for from a song with such a title.\n\nRolling Thunder spotlights production techniques to best advantage though the title is more metaphor than the message of a song best appreciated by Vietnam vets.\n\nThe World Is Flat and Hot for a House are easily the most \"fun\" songs found on Waves of Silence, with the latter, a bit of jocularity in these recessionary times, being the most commercial of selections if one is searching to find a track that is \"radio-friendly.\"\n\nMegan Munroe\n\nOne More Broken String\n\nRating ****\n\nI don't know if Megan will be flattered or insulted, but Munroe strikes me as a new artist in the Miranda Lambert (musical) tradition. The jury is out as to whether I am alone or not in that perception (Megan's debut CD is set for a February 10th release), so let's add to the confusion by adding Gretchen Wilson and Carrie Underwood to the comparative mix.\n\nThe result is country's emerging mainstream: the intelligent, sometimes marginalized, young, edgy, white woman whose rough edges are softened with a touch of humor and an appealing self-confidence.\n\nOne More Broken String (the title is taken from the lyrics of Pennies in the Ocean, one of the CD's 12 tracks) accentuates the singer's pensive side, while Moonshine, Megan's debut single, showcases the singer's vocal range and no-nonsense persona in a radio-friendly fashion.\n\nJust about every song found here is worthy of your attention, albeit for different reasons. Angel on My Shoulder (Devil on my Back) begs the (rhetorical) question, How many other instances can you name of a song with lyrics that reference both the word \"hell\" as an expletive and \"Jesus\" as- well- taking the name of many listeners' Lord other than in vain?\n\nThe lyrics of Belle Meade, another intriguing song title, must not refer to the snooty, upscale area within walking distance of my Nashville home. If they do, Munroe has some 'splainin' to do.\n\nWhile most of the songs here are, as indicated, listener-worthy, the singer/songwriter can be most proud of Leavin' Memphis. If the story-song is not Megan's next single, the powers-that-be are passing up, given the competitive nature of the music business and its small window of opportunity for newbies, potentially-crucial career cement.\n\nRyan Delmore\n\nThe Spirit, The Water, and The Blood\n\nRating ***\n\nNo less an authority than the Jordanaires' Ray Walker spanked me (figuratively speaking, and therefore probably deservedly), then lectured me (OK, that's a bit of an exaggeration), when, during a fairly-recent phone conversation, I used the terms \"Christian\" and \"gospel\" music interchangeably. (Shhhh... Don't tell Ray I wrote promotional material, some years ago, for Ron Cornelius.)\n\nI thought of that conversation when reading the promotional material accompanying singer/songwriter Ryan Delmore's debut album. Lotos Nile Media's single-spaced, six-paragraph introduction to Delmore and his music calls this 11-song CD \"a unique collection of gospel music\" equally-suited for \"AAA or American radio\" in one sentence, adding in the next \"This record eludes consumer classification.\"\n\nSo is this Christian music? The title, taken from the English translation of 1 John 5:7-8, is the best evidence to support that idea, should one want to advance it in the absence of the apparently-polarizing \"Christian\" designation anywhere in promotional materials that state The Spirit should be exempt from the record business retail rules of genre distinction.\n\nI'm not sure that an artist can sing and write lyrics that embrace a philosophy (such as that suggested in the title and Bible verse) and distance himself from the singular, my way or the highway message by delivering his \"intimate\" love songs with a familiar roots twang.\"\n\nInteresting cuts: Sacred, The World "
