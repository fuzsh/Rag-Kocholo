Cuomo recorded several acoustic guitar demos in 2006 featuring different guitar riffs and vocal melodies. The song's verse lyrics also appeared in a similar demo titled \"Rock Star\" (previously titled \"Special\") based on the guitar riff from the 2001 demo \"Diamond Rings.\" It is unknown if \"Troublemaker\" is derived from \"Rock Star\"/\"Special\" or vice-versa. These demos were released to fans in 2020 as part of the demo compilation Alone X: The Red-Raditude-Hurley Years.\n\nWhen the label suggested to Weezer to include more commercial material to speed up the album, the band revisited \"Troublemaker.\" The line \"Keep it on the up\" was inspired by Cuomo's friend and former bandmate Kevin Ridel (of Avant Garde and AM Radio). Ridel has stated \"Rivers sure has made my catch phrase popular!\"[citation needed] \"Troublemaker\" is notably repetitive, with a guitar riff and drum beat that play unchanged throughout almost the entire song.\n\nThe song was released as a digital single. A promotional single was also sent to radio. A physical retail single was scheduled to be released in the UK in late September 2008 but never surfaced.[citation needed] \"Troublemaker\" debuted the week of July 26, 2008, at No. 39 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks charts and peaked at No. 2.\n\nLiner notes\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video for \"Troublemaker\" was directed by the Malloy Brothers and was released on October 6, 2008. The video features Weezer and a selected group of fans attempting to break various world records. It was filmed in front of the Great Western Forum in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood, California. The video includes footage of Weezer fans playing dodgeball, riding on an oversized skateboard, playing air guitar, and filling a large Weezer logo with nachos, cheese, and jalapenos. Rivers Cuomo is also shown pulling a stationwagon full of Weezer fans with his teeth. The video alternates between scenes of the hootenanny as well as a live performance by the band.\n\nTroublemaker Remixes\n\nSee Troublemaker Remixes\n\nPersonnel\n\nRivers Cuomo – lead guitar, lead vocals\n\nPatrick Wilson – percussion\n\nBrian Bell – rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n\nScott Shriner - bass guitar, backing vocals\n\nJacknife Lee - producer\n\nLyrics\n\nPut me in a special school 'cuz I am such a fool\n\nAnd I don’t need a single book to teach me how to read\n\nWho needs stupid books?
