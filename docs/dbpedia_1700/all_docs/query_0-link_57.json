        "text": "ERR RAID\n\nThis time, football's silver-and-black sheep is setting himself\n\nup for a fall\n\nSince mid-March, the NFL's rebel has been sitting in a tiny Los\n\nAngeles courtroom, decked out in black jacket and silver tie,\n\nrelishing his role as a troublemaker. Raiders owner Al Davis has\n\nalways been a fighter, but as he takes the stand this week in his\n\n$1 billion lawsuit against the NFL, it's increasingly apparent\n\nhe's in a fight he has little chance of winning.\n\nDavis says the league unfairly thwarted a 1995 deal he was\n\npursuing for a stadium in Los Angeles, forcing him to move the\n\nRaiders from L.A. back to Oakland. Further, he contends that he\n\nstill holds territorial rights to the L.A. market because he left\n\nunwillingly. That's a crucial issue, given that the NFL badly\n\nwants a team in L.A. and that Davis has often said he wants to\n\nreturn the Raiders to Southern California.\n\nFor its part, the NFL says that it retains the rights to Los\n\nAngeles and that it did everything it could to facilitate the\n\nstadium deal. League lawyers assert that after Oakland offered\n\nthe Raiders $53.9 million in '95, simple greed drove Davis north.\n\nDavis's past legal conflicts with the NFL hang heavy over this\n\ncase. In 1983 he won $49.2 million in damages after arguing that\n\nthe league had violated antitrust laws when it tried to stop his\n\n'82 move from Oakland to L.A. Even worse in his fellow owners'\n\neyes, in '86 Davis testified against the NFL in the USFL's\n\nantitrust suit. Giants owner Wellington Mara has referred to his\n\nrogue acts as \"atrocities.\"\n\nEven if the other owners weren't against him, Davis would face an\n\nuphill battle. He must convince the court that he owns something,\n\nthe L.A. market, he never paid for and that the NFL interfered\n\nwith a stadium deal he abandoned. The league also has\n\nconsiderable financial strength at its disposal. To cover the\n\nlegal costs of the case, each owner--including Davis--is paying\n\n1/32 of the bill, not a hardship considering the league's vast\n\ntelevision monies.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, Davis is involved in two other seemingly\n\nfruitless lawsuits. He's battling to get out of his lease at\n\nOakland's Network Associates Coliseum, claiming the stadium\n\nauthority reneged on guarantees that home games would be\n\nsellouts. (Even with the Raiders' playoff run last year, full\n\nhouses have been rare.) He's also suing the NFL over damage he\n\nclaims it has done to him by allowing other teams to incorporate\n\nblack into their uniforms and by approving a Buccaneers logo that\n\nresembles the Raiders'. Legal experts give Davis little hope of\n\nprevailing in either case.\n\nWhere does all this leave the mercurial Davis? He has always\n\nbeen a maverick, ready to brandish his rebellious image to stoke\n\nhis team's us-against-the-world attitude. However, his latest\n\ncrusades will earn him only animosity from the league, from the\n\ncity of Oakland and from Raiders fans who will most likely see\n\nlittle reason to trust him again. Though he may take solace in\n\nthe Silver and Black's return to glory, in the courtroom Davis\n\nneeds to do a better job of picking his fights. --Jeffri\n\nChadiha and Lester Munson\n\nA Man for All Seasons: Four Faces of Al Davis\n\nThe Egotist\n\nOn his first day as AFL commissioner in 1966, Davis instructs\n\nstaffer writing press release about him to insert words dynamic\n\nand genius.\n\nThe Micromanager\n\nDuring 1987 game at Minnesota, Davis has Raiders official inform\n\ncoach Tom Flores, \"Mr. Davis wants a new quarterback.\" Flores\n\nclaims not to have received message but replaces Rusty Hilger\n\nwith Marc Wilson.\n\nThe Softy\n\nAfter former big league slugger Tony Conigliaro suffers heart\n\nattack and lapses into near coma in 1982, Davis visits him\n\nregularly.\n\nThe Spy\n\nSuspecting Raiders of pregame espionage, Chargers coach Harland\n\nSvare screams at Oakland Coliseum locker-room light fixture,\n\n\"Damn you, Al Davis, I know you're up there!\" Davis later says,\n\n\"It wasn't in the light.\"\n\nWILLIE STARGELL, 1940-2001\n\nPOPS KNEW BEST\n\nMembers of the formidable Pirates teams of the 1970s remember\n\nHall of Fame slugger Willie Stargell, who died on Monday of a\n\nstroke at age 61.\n\nPhil Garner, second baseman: \"He had an unbelievable fire to\n\nplay, but his emotions never got out of control. One time we were\n\nin St. Louis, and Darold Knowles came into a tie game and struck\n\nWillie out on a changeup. Willie came back to the dugout and\n\nsaid, 'I'll hit that changeup later.' Sure enough, ninth inning,\n\nKnowles throws him a change, and Willie hits it into the upper\n\ntier. And he comes back to the dugout very calmly and puts his\n\nhelmet and bat away and takes a seat.\"\n\nTim Foli, shortstop: \"If I'd broken into the big leagues with\n\nWillie, I'd have been a better player. He wanted you to respect\n\nthe game and be proud of having a major league uniform on. His\n\npersonality was infectious. You couldn't be miserable around him.\n\nHe wouldn't let you.\"\n\nRichie Hebner, third baseman: \"He was always a teacher. For the\n\npast couple of years, during spring training, Willie gave a\n\nspeech to all the Pirates' minor league kids. It was impressive.\n\nHe said, 'Don't think you're here as a number or just another\n\nplayer. Everyone's goal should be to wear a Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nuniform.' You could hear a pin drop.\"\n\nDave Parker, rightfielder: \"He was my baseball father. That's why\n\nI called him Pops. I have a picture of Willie and me embracing\n\nafter we won the '79 World Series, and the look on our faces is\n\ntouching. In '78 I told the Pirates that the only way I would\n\nre-sign was if they brought Pops back too. That picture means so\n\nmuch to me because it shows how we felt, like father and son.\"\n\nBill Robinson, leftfielder: \"Willie wasn't one to brag, but every\n\ntime we'd go to Philadelphia, he'd point to a star on a seat way,\n\nway, way up in the rightfield stands and say, 'I hit Jim Bunning\n\nup there.' He was always pulling for you. Other guys would ask\n\nhim, 'Should I take a pitch?' and Willie would say, 'Hit like you\n\nlive--hard.'\"\n\nWord for Word\n\nLast week Croatian-born naval architect Dubravko Rajcevic, 46,\n\nwas convicted in a Miami-Dade County court of stalking Martina\n\nHingis. Below, Rajcevic reads (in italic) and explains (in roman)\n\na fax he sent to Hingis after she lost in the finals of the\n\nIndian Wells tournament in 2000. The questions are from\n\nRajcevic's lawyer, Frank Abrams.\n\nRajcevic: Dear Martina, spring is part of the year, for me the\n\nbest one. Flowers, grass, trees, sunshine, hearts with deep love.\n\nEverything is in the new mood, mood of growing, growing and\n\ngrowing. That is meant to be literally, Shakespeare. Talking\n\nabout flourish season above with symbolism of life awakening.\n\nLast Saturday was just in past, part of when only 10 minutes was\n\nmissed for full Indiana Wells brightness of sunny sky. That\n\nmeans, only 10 minutes has missed for full.\n\nAbrams: Mr. Rajcevic, that's not Shakespeare, that's Rajcevic.\n\nRajcevic: Rajcevic [is] Shakespeare in 21st century! Because\n\nShakespeare didn't have tennis.... But way was almost\n\nperfect...head on my love. That means, head on, head on my love.\n\nThat is not threaten. If somebody said to me in this room, that\n\nis threaten, I am going straightaway in the jail back. And you\n\nput how many years I need to be in jail, if somebody explain to\n\nme that \"head on my love\" is threaten word?\n\nAbrams: Mr. Rajcevic, Mr. Rajcevic.\n\nRajcevic: Just one minute. Beautiful sky, music of waves,\n\nenjoyable temperature and freshness of air and final the most\n\nimportant words,me with you, will give to you additional\n\ninspiration for finding this 10 minutes for full triumph in Key\n\nBiscayne. I love you. Best regards, Dubravko.\n\nGrand Masters\n\nSlam or not? That's the big question after Tiger Woods's Masters\n\nvictory. Overlooked in all the to-and-fro is one athlete who has\n\na unique perspective on the question. In June 1984 Martina\n\nNavratilova won the French Open, giving her all four of tennis's\n\nmajor titles at the same time. Like Woods's sweep, Navratilova's\n\ndidn't come within a calendar year: The '84 French capped a run\n\nthat began in '83 at Wimbledon and continued through that year's\n\nU.S. and Australian Opens. \"They can debate it all they want, but\n\nTiger's got all four at the same time, and I had all four at the\n\nsame time,\" says Navratilova, 44, who lives in Aspen and has\n\nreturned to the tour part time as a doubles player. \"That ain't\n\nshabby.\"\n\nThe International Tennis Federation, which had put up a $1\n\nmillion Slam award, presented Navratilova with a check for the\n\nbonus after her victory at Roland Garros. (She extended her\n\nstreak to six majors, not losing until the semifinals of the\n\nAustralian Open in December 1984, when she was going for the\n\ntraditional Slam.) Over time, however, Navratilova's feat faded\n\nfrom memory. Tennis record books count only six Grand Slams: Don\n\nBudge's (1938), Maureen Connolly's ('53), Rod Laver's ('62 and\n\n'69), Margaret Smith Court's ('70) and Steffi Graf's ('88). Says\n\nNavratilova, \"Maybe it's a Slam with an asterisk. They call\n\nTiger's the Tiger Slam. Maybe I had a Martina Slam.\"\n\nburning Question\n\nQ\n\nWhy do so many NHL players still play with wooden sticks?\n\nA\n\nThough high-tech models in aluminum, titanium and graphite-Kevlar\n\ncomposites are lighter and provide more power, nearly half of all\n\nNHL players still play with wooden sticks. One reason is that\n\nhockey players are notoriously finicky about their gear, and\n\nthose accustomed to wooden shafts don't want to mess with the\n\nprecise puck control they have with a stick they're used to.\n\n\"I've used wood since I was a kid,\" says Flyers center Keith\n\nPrimeau (left). \"Switching would be like someone who's used wood\n\nbats all his life suddenly using an aluminum bat.\"\n\nOf course, hockey players are also a superstitious lot. After\n\nscoring 33 goals in 1999-2000, winger Teemu Selanne, now with the\n\nSharks, switched from wood to graphite in training camp and went\n\nmore than three months without a multigoal game. After going back\n\nto wood, he scored three goals in two games in early January, the\n\nstart of a binge that continued through the end of the regular\n\nseason. \"I tried graphite, and it didn't work,\" says Selanne. \"I\n\ndidn't have a lot of confidence in it, and everything's about\n\nconfidence.\"\n\nBlotter\n\nSettled\n\nA class-action suit against Art Modell brought by Browns fans,\n\nwho claimed Modell violated Ohio's consumer protection laws and\n\nbreached his contract with them by moving his team to Baltimore\n\nin 1995. More than 11,300 former season-ticket holders will\n\nreceive $50 for each ticket they held; they'll have the choice of\n\ntaking cash or donating their proceeds to charity.\n\nCanceled\n\nThe lacrosse season of St. Paul's School of Brooklandville,\n\nMd., considered the nation's best high school squad. School\n\ninvestigators found that team members had watched a video of a\n\n16-year-old junior varsity player having sex with a 15-year-old\n\ngirl, a tape the jayvee player had made and shown to others\n\nwithout the girl's knowledge.\n\nDeclared\n\nThe candidacy of Un Yong Kim of South Korea for IOC president.\n\nDespite being issued a \"most serious warning\" by the IOC for\n\nirregularities related to the Salt Lake bid scandal, he is\n\nconsidered one of the top three candidates among the five seeking\n\nto replace Juan Antonio Samaranch.\n\nResigned\n\nSixers conditioning coach John Croce, brother of team president\n\nPat Croce, after being caught on camera taking cash from Allen\n\nIverson's pants pocket in the 76ers' locker room during an away\n\ngame. No charges were pressed.\n\nDeloof\n\nThe Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which reported that Lirpa Sloof,\n\n30, a visitor from Norway, caught the first home run ball at the\n\nPirates' new PNC Park, a shot by the Mets' Mike Piazza in a March\n\n31 exhibition. The paper got the info from the game notes\n\ndistributed by the Pirates on April Fools' Day and didn't realize\n\nwhat Lirpa and Sloof spell backward.\n\nStars and Cars\n\nAt the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race in Long Beach, Calif., last\n\nweek, Hollywood celebs got a chance to trade paint with the\n\nracing world's finest: 1) Enjoying the hands-on experience were\n\n(left to right) former Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, actress Piper\n\nPerabo (Coyote Ugly), comedian David Alan Grier, actor\n\nChristopher McDonald (Family Law) and Tae Bo's Billy Blanks; 2)\n\npersonalized cars, a step up from vanity plates; 3) William\n\nShatner beams up; 4) Kelly, Olympic swimmer Dara Torres and\n\nBlanks kick-start the race; 5) NASCAR's Robert Huffman and Kelly\n\ndemonstrate the importance of safety belts; 6) a couple of\n\ndrivers: CART's Christian Fittipaldi and actress Minnie.\n\nthe Beat\n\nGood bargains are tough to come by in real estate, which is why\n\nwe call your attention to this hot listing: a 56,000-square-foot\n\nmansion in Farmington, Conn., with 18 bedrooms and 38 baths,\n\nlisted in '98 for $22 million but now going for a rock-bottom $5\n\nmillion. The seller? Mike Tyson, who bought the estate for $2.7\n\nmillion in '96 thinking he'd be fighting a lot on the East Coast.\n\n(He has since decided to spend most of his time in Las Vegas and\n\nPhoenix.) Among the other amenities: a 20-foot waterfall, a pond,\n\na gym, an indoor pool, a guest house, a glass elevator, a\n\nbasketball court and the crowning touch--a 3,500-square-foot\n\nnightclub with a two-tier dance floor, a wall of 20 TV screens, a\n\nDJ station and a smoke machine....\n\nHe's made rap albums and feature films. Now Shaquille O'Neal is\n\nmaking his sitcom debut, on the April 22 episode of the WB's For\n\nYour Love. Shaq will play himself and will be seen dating model\n\nKimora Lee Simmons. Also venturing onto the small screen will be\n\nboxer Laila Ali, who will appear on an episode of the syndicated\n\nseries Sheena. Ali will play Malika, a childhood friend of\n\nSheena's (Gena Lee Nolin) who must protect her village by\n\nfighting a boxer from the outside world. The episode's title:\n\n\"Rumble in the Jungle.\"...\n\nBill Murray is preparing a series for Comedy Central's fall\n\nschedule, tentatively titled The Sweet Spot and described as\n\n\"The Golf Channel meets Caddyshack.\" Bill (above) and brothers\n\nBrian Doyle, Joel and John will play on top courses around the\n\ncountry while goofing with one another and with other players.\n\nThe Murrays are also opening a Caddyshack-themed eatery in\n\nFlorida this year, the first in a planned franchise.
