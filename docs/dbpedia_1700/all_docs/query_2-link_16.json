        "text": "RANCID will release its new album, \"Trouble Maker\", on June 9 via Hellcat/Epitaph Records. This is the ninth studio album for the punk legends and the follow-up to 2014's critically acclaimed \"…Honor Is All We Know\". \"Trouble Maker\" was produced by RANCID's longtime producer and founder of Epitaph Records, Brett Gurewitz.\n\nThe official video for the new RANCID song \"Ghost Of A Chance\", taken from \"Trouble Maker\", can be seen below.\n\nEmerging from the blue-collar swamps of Berkeley, California, RANCID has now been a living, breathing punk rock band for over a quarter century. Back in 1991, after the demise of their much beloved first band, OPERATION IVY, founding members Tim Armstrong (vocals, guitar) and Matt Freeman (bass, vocals) decided to do the impossible — start an even better band. Thus, RANCID. Signing with Epitaph Records, the band released their first album, \"Rancid\", in 1993. Shortly thereafter, Lars Frederiksen (vocals, guitar) joined the band, because... well, are you going to tell him he can't? The result, in 1994, was \"Let's Go\".\n\nIn 1995, RANCID released the classic platinum-selling \"...And Out Come The Wolves\". You still remember when you first heard it. They followed with the even more ambitious \"Life Won't Wait\" in 1998, and in 2000, RANCID released another album titled \"Rancid\", just to see if anyone was paying attention. After \"Indestructible\" in 2003, Branden Steineckert (drums) joined to solidify RANCID's current lineup. They subsequently released the albums \"Let The Dominos Fall\" (2009) and \"Honor Is All We Know\" (2014)."
