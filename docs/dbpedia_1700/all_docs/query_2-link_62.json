        "text": "Seven-member South Korean boy group EVNNE (Evening’s Newest Étoiles) has successfully made their first ever comeback with their second mini-album, [Un: SEEN]! Members KEITA, PARK HANBIN, LEE JEONGHYEON, YOO SEUNGEON, JI YUNSEO, MUN JUNGHYUN, and PARK JIHOO once again sat down with The Seoul Story to discuss their latest mini album, showcasing their unseen talents, and more!\n\nQ: This is EVNNE’s first comeback since debut! Compared to [Target: Me], what was different in the preparation process of this new mini-album?\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: We aimed to reveal a stronger and more intense side of EVNNE to the public. While [Target: ME], our previous album, portrayed a naughty boys’ image, in this one, we embraced a more mature persona. We adjusted our hairstyles and looks to align with the concept and conveyed this evolved image through our performances.\n\nPARK JIHOO: Our previous album, [Target: ME] revolved around positioning us as the “target,” capturing the audience’s attention. In [Un: SEEN], we aimed to showcase the dual aspects of the group— the visible and the hidden.\n\nQ: If you had to choose one song from the mini-album, which track do you think best represents EVNNE’s colors as a group?\n\nMUN JUNGHYUN: As EVNNE takes on the concept of troublemakers, I think the track UGLY best captures this. I also think we will be able to show an intense, powerful aspect of the group through this song.\n\nJI YUNSEO: I also choose the title track, UGLY. While we initially portrayed a younger, immature version of troublemakers in the title track of our previous album, TROUBLE, the representation of troublemakers in this album, [Un: SEEN], takes on a more mature tone, delving into individual pain that we’ve never revealed before. I believe the title track truly encapsulates the refined image of troublemakers we aim to convey to the world in this album.\n\nQ: Still being a relatively new group, what’s something “unseen” about yourselves that you wish to reveal with this comeback?\n\nMUN JUNGHYUN: Until now, we haven’t been able to showcase a particularly powerful side of the group. I hope to demonstrate this facet of our group through the title track, UGLY.\n\nPARK JIHOO: I also aim to create an impression for the public that all members of the group are versatile, excelling in dancing, singing, and rapping.\n\nJI YUNSEO: Through reality shows and social media, we have cultivated an easygoing and comfortable image to our fans and the public. I wish to continue to show our easygoing and relaxed side of ourselves in this album as well.\n\nQ: A few of you participated in writing the melodies and the lyrics for the album. What is your creative process like?\n\nKEITA: I participated in the lyrics and composition of the song, Festa in this album. The inspiration for this track stemmed from the festive atmosphere during a fan meet-up and the excitement I had while interacting with our fans. I drew a comparison between that to a festival.\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: I took part in the lyrics-writing process for the fourth track of the album, Chase. Initially, I got into the process with the mindset to challenge myself and to gain experience. I concentrated on writing lyrics with pronunciation that complements the melody and aligns with the dreamy vibe of the song. I’m pleased to have shared my lyrics with our fans through this song.\n\nLEE JEONGHYEON: I participated in writing the lyrics for the song titled SYRUP. Drawing a parallel between the group’s irresistible charms and the word ‘syrup’, I aimed to emphasize our talents and appeal through the lyrics. My goal was to encapsulate all of our charms in this song, allowing listeners to get a good sense of what it is by simply listening to the song.\n\nQ: With your new album called [Un: SEEN], what are each members’ unseen talents?\n\nMUN JUNGHYUN: JIHOO is a big basketball fan, but I believe our fans are yet to see him playing basketball. I think they will be surprised to see how well he plays.\n\nKEITA: Rapping skills of SEUNGEON. I seriously believe it to be quite attractive so I hope for a chance in the future to show it off to our fans.\n\nQ: If you could choose one B-side track from [Un: SEEN] to make a music video for, which one would it be?\n\nPARK HANBIN: As a group with a powerful and intense image, we often filmed music videos with a similar concept. However, Festa presents a bright and lively image, giving off an amusement park and fireworks vibe. I want to film its music video in such places to capture the essence of the track.\n\nPARK JIHOO: I would love to film a music video for the B-side track SYRUP. I love this track and its dreamy vibe so I think there will be a lot of elements to the song that the viewers would enjoy once it has been created into a music video.\n\nQ: It was previously mentioned that this comeback is a bit different and darker than the debut concept. How do you feel about tackling this new concept?\n\nJI YUNSEO: Instead of characterizing this comeback as “darker” than our previous one, I believe it’s more accurate to describe it as a maturation process. We’ve transitioned from being immature, boyish troublemakers to individuals who have experienced pain, revealing aspects that were not previously shown to the public.\n\nPARK JIHOO: I also think that there’s more to showcase in our performances compared to our debut. I’m genuinely excited about unveiling this aspect of our group to the public through this comeback.\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: Similarly, we aimed to present a more mature side of ourselves, compared to the mischievous and playful image we had during our debut. Additionally, we sought to convey our internal emotions and feelings in a more profound and in-depth manner than before.\n\nQ: Do you have your favorite moments that you’d like to share with us from the preparations of your first comeback?\n\nJI YUNSEO: Completing the last promotion with fan meet-up event, the thought of seeing our fans again to share the stage always lingered in my mind. It’s challenging to pinpoint just one moment, as every step in the preparation process was new and filled with excitement, all centered around the anticipation of reuniting with our fans.\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: I always strive to challenge myself with new styles of music and songs. During the recording of the five tracks for this album, my enthusiasm was fueled by the desire to let our fans hear these songs. Therefore, the recording process became the most enjoyable and exciting part of the entire preparation for me.\n\nPARK HANBIN: For me, the most memorable moment was when I heard the title track for the first time. Since recording is the initial step in preparing an album, listening to the track filled me with excitement as I thought about the concept and envisioned the kind of performance we could deliver. Also, we all had a great first reaction after listening to the song.\n\nQ: What song on [Un: SEEN] would be the most fitting to a movie about your lives?\n\nPARK HANBIN: I like the track K.O. (Keep On) because the overall ambiance of the song is very hopeful while giving a very passionate feel. I feel it would be a fitting soundtrack to the movie of my life.\n\nMUN JUNGHYUN: I also choose K.O. (Keep On) because the title suggests to keep on moving without any limits or restrictions. I think it resonates well with the ambition of the team.\n\nQ: Is there anything in particular that you do to get “ugly” and get in the mood to perform your newest title track?\n\nPARK JIHOO: Personally, before stepping onto the stage, I tend to jump a few times as a routine to alleviate the nervousness I typically experience.\n\nJI YUNSEO: In preparation for the performance of UGLY, I did some research on the concept of rascals. Alongside extensive practice of my vocal and dance skills, I looked at images and videos related to the concept, including performances by senior artists.\n\nQ: The music video has a reference to the tale, Ugly Duckling by Hans Christian Andersen. Do each of you have a favorite fairytale, and why?\n\nJI YUNSEO: I like Peter Pan. The concept of Neverland, with the idea of the second star to the right, captivates me. I appreciate the dichotomy in the story, where some characters wish to remain young while others hope to grow up quickly. Also, the underlying message about accepting the inevitability of aging, yet also the freedom to resist it at times, adds a layer of fun and depth to the story that I truly enjoy.\n\nPARK JIHOO: I like the Korean folklore titled Heungbu and Nolbu. My parents would read me this story as a bedtime story, so I have a meaningful memory of this story.\n\nQ: What was the most challenging part of the UGLY choreography?\n\nPARK JIHOO: The choreography for the chorus of the song was the most difficult. There is a part where we have to keep our balance which is quite hard so I recall having a challenging time trying to perfect it.\n\nPARK HANBIN: The choreography for the lyric “Big shot” demanded us to stand on one foot for some time, making it quite challenging to maintain our balance during that segment.\n\nQ: Some of you participated in making of several of your songs. What are other themes and music genres that you would like to explore in the future?\n\nJI YUNSEO: EVNNE has established an image as troublemakers with a powerful and intense concept. I am interested in exploring a concept that retains the essence of a troublemaker but introduces a brighter and more refreshing image.\n\nPARK JIHOO: Just as YUNSEO said, and as a group, we share the belief that we are capable of exploring and excelling in various genres without being confined to a specific style. So I’m certain that we will be able to pull off any musical genres.\n\nQ: As this era is about showing the unseen sides of yourselves, what songs or performances of your seniors or other artists that you’d like to show a cover of in the future?\n\nPARK HANBIN: My role model is WOODZ, and he recently released a new song titled Amnesia. I love the band sound of the song and I hope to develop my vocal skills, dedicating time to practice and eventually covering the song in the future.\n\nJI YUNSEO: I would like to cover Spark by Taeyeon and Love Poem by IU. I want to show a more developed vocal skills, so I hope to try and cover the song in the future.\n\nLEE JEONGHYEON: Currently, I’m deeply interested in dance, and I’m eager to excel in this skill. We have been covering a lot of songs of the senior artists through TikTok challenges, and while covering their dance is great, I also saw many freestyle dance videos of senior artists. Therefore my goal is to practice and eventually showcase my own free-style dance video in the future.\n\nQ: You had a short time between your debut and this comeback. What do you do to de-stress from the routine?\n\nPARK HANBIN: I like to read books, particularly essays. I take time to unwind with a good reads.\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: I either go to ride bikes by the Han River at night or listen to music or watch movies to unwind.\n\nPARK JIHOO: I enjoy playing basketball so I would play basketball by myself or with the members at night.\n\nLEE JEONGHYEON: I would admire performance videos of other senior artists after watching them together with YUNSEO and talk about things that we want to take on from them. I also play video games, especially ones on soccer, to relieve my stress.\n\nQ: Each of the members has unique talents and personalities. How do you think your individual strengths come together to create the sound of EVNNE? What are some things you learned about yourselves or each other during the making of the new album?\n\nJI YUNSEO: EVNNE has more rappers than vocalists, so inevitably, we often present hip-hop type of music to the public. The vocalists skillfully contribute to the group’s mood with tones that harmonize seamlessly with the overall vibe, which in turn complements the rap verses in our music. This synergy between the vocalists and the rappers creates a unique charm for EVNNE as a group. I also think we cannot talk about EVNNE without our performances. The group’s stage presence is marked by its intense and powerful energy, which is another significant strength for us.\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: Each member of EVNNE is highly versatile, possessing exceptional abilities and skills. We’re all capable of handling various parts of a song or any position within the group. We are not tied to any specific genres or concepts, allowing us to tackle any type of music. This adaptability stands as another strength for our group.\n\nPARK HANBIN: For our debut album, we were mostly involved in lyrics writing, but for this album, we expanded our roles to include composing. This allowed us to showcase the individual abilities of each member and served as an opportunity to witness the potential we hold as a group.\n\nQ: From your appearances on BOYS PLANET and now as EVNNE, you have maintained really great teamwork. What are the factors to your strong dynamic and teamwork?\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: Our experience on the show BOYS PLANET provided valuable insights into practicing and creating a stage together as a group. This shared experience has allowed us to prepare for performances under the same mindset. Additionally, our similar hobbies, lifestyles, and thoughts contribute to our strong teamwork. The shared interests and genuine friendship among us have been key factors in fostering excellent collaboration overall.\n\nLEE JEONGHYEON: We all were very close during the show, and on top of that, I believe KEITA did a great job as the leader of the group. He created a very comfortable atmosphere when we were just goofing around while effectively setting the mood when necessary. I think he played a role in creating such great teamwork.\n\nJI YUNSEO: Ever since we first met on the show to our debut as EVNNE and until now, we’ve maintained a shared goal that has deepened our understanding of each other. Our continuous efforts toward achieving this common objective have consistently improved our teamwork, fostering a strong bond within the group.\n\nQ: What is the strongest impression of the fans that they left on you?\n\nPARK JIHOO: The fans waved their light sticks for us, creating a beautiful sight reminiscent of a cityscape at night or a starry sky. I was very grateful for that.\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: During our first fan meet, we kicked off the event with the song Role Model. As the lights dimmed, I gazed at the audience and witnessed a sea of our fans, resembling stars in the night sky. It is truly something that I will never forget. This moment allowed me to appreciate the significant number of people showering us with love, and for that, I am truly grateful.\n\nJI YUNSEO: At the fan meet, the fans prepared a surprise event for us. As we performed the final song, Even More, the audience simultaneously raised banners, initially leaving me puzzled. It took a moment to realize the banners had heartfelt phrases on them. Then I realized that I’m here at a fan meet as part of EVNNE, thoroughly enjoying the stage with our fans. This moment left an impressive mark on me.\n\nQ: KEITA, what did it mean to you to be chosen as a leader, especially as a foreign member?\n\nKEITA: Initially, taking on the role of leader felt burdensome, especially during the promotion of our debut album when I was uncertain whether I was doing the job correctly. However, with time, I found that the members follow my lead well so the role has become less burdensome over time. Now, I make efforts to foster an atmosphere where every group member can freely voice their opinions.\n\nQ: Do you think EVNNE would be the same if you did not meet each other through BOYS PLANET? If not, how different would it be?\n\nJI YUNSEO: While I can’t guarantee that we would have formed the same way without the experience on BOYS PLANET as we all learned tremendously through the show, I still believe we’d still have the same chemistry between us even if we all met through other means and came together as a team. It is because things that we like are quite similar and compatible. So I believe that even if we did not meet through the show, we’d still have formed a great group together.\n\nQ: Have you ever regretted joining the show BOYS PLANET?\n\nJI YUNSEO: We’ve met through the show, BOYS PLANET where I discovered fellow peers striving toward the same dream and learning valuable skill sets and mindsets for putting on performances. I have never regretted appearing on the show, as I believe EVNNE was possible because of it. I view it as a precious experience and something for which I am deeply grateful.\n\nPARK JIHOO: Choosing to participate in the show BOYS PLANET not only allowed me to meet the members but also introduced me to other friends from whom I gained valuable lessons. If I did not meet them I wouldn’t be able to grow into the person that I am so I do not regret it one bit.\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: The opportunity presented by the show BOYS PLANET allowed us to introduce our name to the public, ultimately paving the way for our debut as EVNNE. More importantly, it served as the platform through which we connected with our fans. With this, I can confidently say that I have no regrets about joining the show.\n\nQ: Do you have any plans to release new music within the next year or two?\n\nJI YUNSEO: Yes, of course.\n\nKEITA: We consistently strive to unveil new facets of ourselves to our fans, ENNVE, putting forth our best efforts to showcase a diverse range of music types and styles to the public.\n\nPARK HANBIN: I hope you anticipate the upcoming music and performances that we have in store for the future, and I appreciate the continued support and love from all of you.\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: We are a team that consistently reflects on the type of new music and concept we want to bring to our fans for a comeback. so for sure we will release new music within the next year or two.\n\nQ: If you could perform anywhere in the world, where would it be?\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: I personally find happiness in all the moments I share with our fans on the stage while performing. So I’d like to go wherever our fans are to create wonderful memories with them together.\n\nMUN JUNGHYUN: Our goal is to connect with our fans wherever they are and deliver performances for them. I’ve learned that KCON this year will be hosted in three different locations. Personally, my goal for this year is to visit these three locations and perform at KCON.\n\nQ: Who suits the powerful concept the best?\n\nJI YUNSEO: I believe that HANBIN and JIHOO excel in pulling off the powerful concept of the title track, UGLY, in this album. Given that the title track places a significant emphasis on performance, JIHOO’s excellent dance skills complement the overall theme, while HANBIN’s expressive facial expressions add onto the quality of the performance.\n\nPARK HANBIN: I believe that the powerful concept aligns well with KEITA. Given that our songs are rap-heavy, KEITA excels in keeping a great balance and the intense rap verses resonate perfectly with his style.\n\nLEE JEONGHYEON: Considering our group’s versatility in handling various concepts, I believe all members adapt well to the given concept. However, if I were to select one member, I would choose MUN JUNGHYUN. Observing him during our practice sessions, I find that his new short hairstyle and overall ambiance perfectly match the powerful and intense concept of the album. Additionally, his intense vocals after the bridge of the song is another reason why I choose MUN JUNGHYUN for this concept.\n\nQ: Which member suits the punk fashion the best?\n\nMUN JUNGHYUN: In general, LEE JEONGHYEON exudes a sharp ambiance, and I believe the clothing and tattoos associated with the concept of this album truly highlight the intense side of his personality.\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: I choose HANBIN because he is very skillful with his facial expressions. In this album, he tried a tooth gem for the first time, and initially, I was uncertain about how it would turn out. However, he exceeded expectations, and the final result looked as if it came straight from a magazine.\n\nQ: What is the biggest goal or dream that you have as a group?\n\nYOO SEUNGEON: It would be winning first place on a music show. In this comeback, we secured the top spot on the Bugs music charts, and I wish to attain similar success on other charts, with a particular dream of making it onto the Billboard charts someday.\n\nMUN JUNGHYUN: I was told to dream big, so likewise, I hope to secure the top spot on the Billboard charts in the future. It is the ultimate goal, and I will dream big.\n\nAbout EVNNE\n\nEVNNE is a seven-member South Korean boy group managed by Jellyfish Entertainment. The members include KEITA, PARK HANBIN, LEE JEONGHYEON, YOO SEUNGEON, JI YUNSEO, MUN JUNGHYUN, and PARK JIHOO, all of whom have already been recognized for their talents through music survival shows, most notably, Mnet’s popular K-Pop Survival program, BOYS PLANET.
