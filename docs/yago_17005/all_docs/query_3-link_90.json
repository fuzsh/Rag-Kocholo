        "text": "Preity, with your next film Heroes coming up. Are you nervous or excited?\n\nFrankly speaking, I am very excited. I was nervous when I was shooting for the film. It was a very difficult role for me, because it was not in my comfort zone as an actor. This role was something that I have not attempted before.\n\nFor instance, when someone offers me a role of an NRI, I can play that role with ease because it’s in my comfort zone. But my role in Heroes has got a very rural flavor to it.\n\nIt’s a role of a simple girl from a village, who speaks Punjabi and is a woman of the soil. She works on a tractor and makes rotis in a village house. In that sense, it’s a very different kind of role.\n\nWhat is the name of your character in the film and can you oblige us by giving a sneak peak into the lives of ‘Heroes’?\n\nThe name of my character is Kuljeet Kaur, who is an Indian by every inch. And as far as the ‘sneak peak’ into the film is concerned, all I can say is that the film is about the two boys played by Vatsal Seth and Sohail Khan.\n\nThey belong to the proverbial ‘Generation Next’ and also someone who have everything that anyone can ever want. They have the money to splurge, they have all the vices, and they have the time, and yes the luxury to waste time too, which is pretty much the current breed of the upper level generation.\n\nHeroes is about their journey of meeting people from various backgrounds of life. It is their interaction with people from various backgrounds of life. Moreover, how they get inspired from them. It is then, that these normal people become ‘heroes’.\n\nThe bottom line of the story is that one need not do anything extraordinary to become a hero. You can simply do the ordinary things and become a hero. But what matters the most is the ‘way’ you do them.\n\nAs Mariah Carey says in her famous song… ‘That a Hero lies in you’. This film is also something that acts as a bridge that connects the modern India with the real India.\n\nHow much of your character in Heroes do you identify with?\n\nAbsolutely…despite the fact that I am extremely urban! But as Shahrukh says, ‘Phir bhi dil hai Hinduatani’! I come from an army family (with my father and brother both serving the nation), I am extremely patriotic towards my country.\n\nI would request each and every family to at least send one of their children to the army. That way, it would not be states and communities anymore…it will be about INDIA! People in the army give their lives for people they don’t even know. The only time when we remember them is when there is a war happening.\n\nAt the end of the day, we land up with a ‘Oh! How sad’ kind of feeling, which is something that I feel will never cease to be the flavor of the season. Heroes is a look into lot of such things, without any kind of theory and lecture-baazi!\n\nIt’s more of a practical presentation which, in other words, can also be termed as the mirror of the society! It’s not just me, but the whole nation will instantly identify with Kuljeet Kaur! As an actor, Heroes is a very new space for me and I am simply proud to be a part of it!\n\nRumors also have it that you have not used make up in the entire film. How much of it is true?\n\nYes, I have not used make-up, but only in some portions of the film, whereas in others, I have. But the one film in which I have just not done any make up is my next film Heaven On Earth! To me, Heaven On Earth and Heroes are the two faces of the same coin.\n\nHow was it working with Salman Khan?\n\nTill date, never ever in my career, have I ever looked at my hero while working with him, stopped at the sets and said, “Oh! You look so good!” But, I did that with Salman Khan when he came dressed up as a Sardar. I just looked at him and said, “Oh My God! Salman…you look so good!”\n\nSalman, on his part, simply looked at me so endearingly and asked, “Preity…what are you talking about!” With his beard and turban, he looked like a real Jat Sikh! Trust me; he looks so very awesomely good in the film.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I happened to go to London where a group of people came up to me and said, “Assi tho zaroor dekhaangey jee Heroes, Salman Khan tho badda sona lagada hain jee.” (Dear, we will surely watch Heroes without fail. Salman looks so good in it!).\n\nAnd I was like, ‘Hey! What about me?’ (Laughs) To which, they replied, “Aap bhi achhe lag rahe ho, par Salman kya lag raha hai…gabru’. (You too are looking good, but Salman looks so macho!).\n\nHeroes was previously titled as ‘Mera Bhaarat Mahaan’. Without sounding diplomatic or politically correct, can you please tell us as to which name do you prefer more and why?\n\nI think both the titles work for me because the idea being both the titles suits the film so very accurately.\n\nThat reminds me of an incident, which happened to me a few days back when I saw a signboard which said ‘Mera Bhaarat Mahaan’.\n\nBut when I came closer to the board, there were these small letters below it which said ‘Banana padega’. (Laughs) If I were to think of Heroes from a different context, I think that Mera Bharat Mahaan sounds like a name with a little bit of cynicism in it, while Heroes sounds more positive. That way, I would stick with Heroes!\n\nVatsal Seth…the literal blue-eyed boy of Bollywood, who started off his Bollywood career with a dud like Tarzan -The Wonder Car is again knocking the doors of tinsel town with Heroes. Do you foresee a bright future for him post Heroes?\n\nI am sure that he indeed has a bright future ahead of him. And when he actually starts looking like a man (post his chocolate hero image), he would have gained so much experience in this industry, that its going to be only raining awards for him!\n\nIndia winning at the Oscars is every Indian’s dream. So, do you feel that Taare Zameen Par will make every Indian’s dream come true?\n\nI really hope it wins! It’s a great movie. After watching the film, I told Aamir that, ‘TZP made me cry. And it wasn’t even a love story.’ I am already sitting with my fingers and toes crossed with a little prayer of my lips!\n\nCan you cite three reasons for the common man to watch Heroes?\n\nFirstly, it’s a fantastic film. Secondly, I am in it. And lastly, it’s going to be worth every minute of it.\n\nThe Bachchans’ world tour will have eco-friendly products and basic steps will be taken to ensure they don”t contribute to global warming Amitabh Bachchan is seriously concerned about global warming. The Unforgettable world tour, organised by Wizcraft and starring the Bachchans (Amitabh, Abhishek and Aishwarya) along with Akshay Kumar, Preity Zinta and Madhuri Dixit will go ‘green’ as announced during IIFA in Bangkok.\n\nIn a chat, Bachchan talks about how the tour will try to combat global warming and about his interaction with environmentalist Dr R K Pachauri:\n\nWhen was it decided that the Unforgettables tour would go green?\n\nAs soon as the tour details were finalised, we took a joint decision that we would do our maximum to ensure that certain environmental issues were addressed.\n\nWhat are some of the steps that will be taken to ensure the prevention of global warming?\n\nSome very basic steps are being taken. Not flying on chartered flights, reducing the consumption of electric power on the stage, or using equipment that is environment friendly.\n\nAre you taking any steps at home — planting vegetation, etc, or involving your children and grandchildren in planting trees and educating them about global warming?\n\nYes we always do. We have a substantial lawn in Prateeksha and despite the concretisation that sprouts all around us we have not allowed it to be consumed.Instead, we continue to plant trees in and around it. As also in Jalsa and the office at Janak. And yes, the children and grandchildren support this cause.\n\nYou mentioned at IIFA that you had planted a champa tree at the UN office.\n\nThe UN office in Bangkok has a large courtyard open to the elements. It was here that the ambassador of India and I planted a champa tree, in keeping with the UN special programme of planting a billion trees. I am happy to state that that programme has indeed overshot its target. Over 2.2 billion trees have been planted.\n\nEnvironmentalist and Nobel Peace Laureate winner Dr R K Pachauri was honoured by IIFA with the Global Business Leadership Award. Could you enlighten us a bit on your conversation with Dr Pachauri? Dr Pachauri was a guest at the IIFA business forum, where he was given a citation for his achievements and his recent Nobel Prize.In the speech he made that afternoon to almost 500 delegates, he educated us through statistics and film about the importance of saving the environment. I have volunteered, as have Abhishek and Aishwarya, to lend our support through film campaigns, to his concerns on global warming.\n\nWhat steps did you decide with Dr Pachauri on to control global warming?\n\nDr Pachauri is going to brief us on his return to India what steps he wishes to take and where he would like us to come in. We will be actively involved with Dr Pachauri and his works and intend keeping in touch with him with reference to our conversation. As and when he draws up a programme we shall meet and take things forward.\n\nFlying daily through India’s over-congested airports is a guaranteed recipe for countless delays. Fortunately this affords one the opportunity to engage in numerous chats with affable strangers.\n\nAas everyone in India is a cricket expert and the action packed IPL is in full swing, there is in no shortage of subject matter for a good old cricket-focused chinwag with someone you have only known for a few moments.\n\nThe best is when you are actually on a plane chatting to your neighbour about last night’s big game, when the guy in the row in front turns around and joins in. This is usually enough for one or two more aficionados to add their opinion. If you’re mad about cricket, there is no better country to be in than India.\n\nA few days ago I was waiting to board a delayed flight at the brand spanking new Rajiv Ghandi airport in Hyderabad. Actually it is 45 kilometres outside Hyderabad, a two-hour taxi ride from the cricket ground. I was waiting in the departure hall for a delayed flight when I saw a chap wearing an IPL golf shirt so I introduced myself asking if he worked for the IPL. The reply came: “Good afternoon, I’m Andrew, pleasure to meet you. Yes, I actually dreamt the whole thing up a year or so ago and then I got together with a guy called Lalit Modi and now here we are.”\n\nI shook his hand and smiled, not quite sure whether I loved or hated this Englishman for revolutionising cricket quite so radically. The tournament was about a week old then and I congratulated him, adding that its instant popularity must have far exceeded even his wildest expectations. “Not really, it is exactly as I expected” he replied grinning from ear to ear. I had a pleasant chat with Andrew and enjoyed picking his brain about the relationship between IPL management and the various franchises.\n\nWhen he admitted that after the low-scoring Eden Gardens match between the Kolkata Night Riders and the Deccan Chargers he had Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) shouting in his face, I said: “Yes, that’s no surprise, he must have been mad about that terrible pitch.” “Not at all” said Andrew, “he was furious that the big screens weren’t big enough!”\n\nKnight Riders owner SRK is easily Bollywood’s biggest star. You would have seen him gyrating throughout his team’s matches. He reportedly commands a quarter of a million dollars per television advertisement and seems to be in every second ad on the box. Consequently the singing dancing poster boy has no shortage of money or fanbase and Andrew reckons the Knight Riders are already one of the ten biggest brands in India.\n\nThe Times of India reports that Bollywood box office sales are down 35% since the start of the tournament. The obvious next step is for cinema theatres to show screenings of IPL matches. But while some cinemas have successfully negotiated rights from Sony Setmax (the televison channel who owns the IPL rights in India) the greedy BCCI is demanding one lakh rupees (about US$2500) per game per screen. This would result in theatre tickets at ten to twenty times their normal price.\n\nAnother big mover and shaker in India is Vijay Mallya, the owner of Kingfisher beer, Kingfisher Airlines, a Formula One racing team and hundreds of racehorses. This racy stable seemed incomplete without an IPL team and the Bangalore Royal Challengers are Mallya’s latest plaything. By the way, Royal Challenge (same logo and colours and song as the cricket team) is the name of a whiskey brand that is also owned by Mallya – an outrageous example of surrogate advertising. India’s answer to Richard Branson is an eccentric character and is known as the “King of Good Times”.\n\nA court case was yesterday heard to determine whether Mallya was using sport to promote an alcohol brand. But the court found that there was no evidence in this claim. In India, as in Africa, the benefits of belonging to the right club are astonishing.\n\nMark Boucher, who is taking a nap on the sofa next to me in the Bangalore Airport (which will move a further 35 kilometres from town next week) while a dozen or so waiters and airline staff take photos of him with their high-tech mobile phones, took strong exception to Mallya giving the Challengers a thorough bollocking in the dressing room after losing the inaugural IPL match.\n\nThanks to McCullum’s blistering 158 not out the winning team on that day was SRK’s Knight Riders. I am told that Boucher, who has never been shy to stand up for himself, barked right back at Mallya, telling him that yelling at the team won’t do any good at all.\n\nPreity Zinta, the vivacious, dimple-cheeked Bollywood star, celebrates her 33rd birthday on Thursday with greater confidence in her abilities and demonstrating a little known business acumen with the recent bagging of the franchise of the Mohali team in cricket’s Indian Premier League.\n\nPreity would have had a big do to mark the occasion had her professional commitments not come in the way, according to a source close to her.\n\nHowever, she has ensured that the ‘big day’ in her life is not all work and no play. She will celebrate, but it will be a quiet one. Who are included in her private party’s guest list is also kept under wraps to avoid media scrutiny.\n\nOne person who will stand beside Preity to cheer her and sing “Happy Birthday To Dear Preity” the loudest will be her beau, Ness Wadia, the scion of the Wadia family who runs Bombay Dyeing.\n\nProfessionally, after a decade in the industry, Preity is now bold enough to tread on uncharted territories with a rare confidence to ensure that she carves her own niche in Bollywood — of course, with an eye on Hollywood.\n\nIndeed, she has accepted the challenge of movies like Deepa Mehta’s forthcoming venture, Heaven On Earth, and Jahnu Barua’s Har Pal, movies that are far away from Bollywood’s commercial standards.\n\nIn both the movies, due for release in the first half of 2008, Preity will surprise her fans and audiences alike, portraying far less glamorous roles than she has ever played in the past.\n\nIn these movies, she plays the roles of women who are psychologically troubled due to family reasons but come to terms with their respective situations in a mature way and finally emerge victorious.\n\nThe two movies will present her in an image that is absolutely different from the bubbly image the mainstream Bollywood movies have given her, Bollywood circles explained.\n\nPreity has decided to walk on a terrain, which has nothing to do with movies, but everything to do with glamour.\n\nYes, from a gentlemen’s game, cricket has become a glamour sport of late. And Preity, along with Shah Rukh Khan, provided oodles of it when the two won the IPL franchise to sponsor two important cricketing teams.\n\nGlamour of cricket and de-glamorised roles in movies – is this the beginning of metamorphoses 2008 that Preity is experimenting with?\n\nMore important, will it lead her to new heights?\n\nNews Source"
