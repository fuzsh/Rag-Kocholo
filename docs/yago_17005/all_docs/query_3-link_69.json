It's now known that the film is titled Biskoth.\n\nShot in Chennai and Hyderabad, Biskoth will have two female leads. Tara Alisha Berry, who played the female lead in Santhanam's last year hit A1 is roped in as one of the heroines for this film, which will also have model turned actor Swathi Muppala making her Tamil debut.\n\nMeanwhile, Santhanam's next release will be his much delayed Server Sundaram that will be out on February 14th. The actor also has Dikkilona in which he will be playing triple roles for the first time."
