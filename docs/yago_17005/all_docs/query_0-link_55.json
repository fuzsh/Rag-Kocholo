        "text": "Settai (Tamil: சேட்டை) is the tentative title for an upcoming Indian Tamil comedy film directed by R. Kannan. A remake of the 2011 Hindi film, Delhi Belly, it stars Arya, Hansika Motwani, Anjali, Santhanam and Premji Amaren.The film, which began filming began in Chennai on 7 May 2012, is scheduled for a release in December 2012.\n\nAfter UTV Motion Pictures announced that the studio will be remaking the Hindi film Delhi Belly in Tamil, R. Kannan, who had earlier directed Jayam Kondaan and Kanden Kadhalai, was selected as the director. G. Dhananjayan, South Business chief of UTV, stated that, unlike the original version, which received an adult rating, the remake would be made for a family audience, making clear that the core plot would be retained, while the dialogue would be changed and “risque jokes” be avoided. Dhananjayan further added that he, Kannan and John Mahendran would be creditted for additional screenplay and adaption, while the latter would write the new dialogues as well.Varuthapadaatha Vaalibar Sangam and Vai Raja Vai were amongst the suggested titles for the film, with the team eventually zeroing in on Settai. Arya, Santhanam and Premji Amaren were selected to play the three lead roles. Vijay Raaz, who portrayed the main antagonist in Delhi Belly, was approached to reprise his role.His role later went to Nasser. Suja Varunee was cast to appear in a cameo role which was played by Anusha Dandekar in the original. Telugu comedian Ali joined the cast, making his Tamil film debut.\n\nThe film was launched on 7 May 2012 in Chennai. Two huge sets resembling a hotel and a bachelor’s room were reportedly constructed for the shoot. The first schedule got over after 20 days of shoot in three differently constructed sets. The makers are planning to finish the film in two more schedules."
