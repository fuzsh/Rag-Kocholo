        "text": "A part of Santhanam’s upcoming comedy outing Biskoth is reportedly set in the 18th century, and will have the actor playing the role of a king. The team went through a lot of historical paintings and museums to arrive at the actor’s look in the film. The interesting part is that Santhanam sports a cooling glass in the picture which has just been revealed, which means that the story could have a time travel element of sorts.\n\nBiskoth is directed by R Kannan, known for his films like Jayam Kondaan. The film has music by Radhan of Arjun Reddy fame.Trailer of Biskoth is set to release soon."
