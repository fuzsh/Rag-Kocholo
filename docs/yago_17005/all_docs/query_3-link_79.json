        "text": "Director Kannan (an old associate of Mani Ratnam) recently screened three songs and the trailer of Vandhaan Vendraan to his master in Chennai. According to Kannan, Mani Ratnam was very impressed with Kannan's work and appreciated it. I showed him just three songs and the trailer. He just said 'good' and it meant a lot to me. After watching Jayam Kondaan, he sent me a message which I still cherish. He also told his other ADs that he liked my movie. It's a big encouragement for me, coming from a director of Mani's stature, director Kannan was quoted as saying. Vandhaan Vendraan, which has Jiiva and Tapasee in the lead, is all set to grace theatres tomorrow."
