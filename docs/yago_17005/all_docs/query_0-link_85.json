        "text": "A few weeks back, it was officially announced that this year's critically acclaimed Malayalam film, The Great Indian Kitchen will be remade in Tamil and the news created a good buzz on social media. The Tamil remake got officially launched in the beginning of this month and it was revealed that Aishwarya Rajesh will be playing the lead role. The original version featured Nimisha Sajayan and Suraj Venjaramoodu in the lead roles. While Aishwarya Rajesh reprised Nimisha's role, there were no updates regarding the male lead. Having said that, the makers have now officially announced that actor Rahul Ravindran will be playing the male lead, reprising Suraj Venjaramoodu's role.\n\nFor the uninformed, Rahul Ravindran is a promising actor known for being a part of movies like Moscowin Kavery, Vanakkam Chennai, U Turn, etc. Rahul Ravindran is also a director who has made films like Chi La Sow and Manmadhudu 2. Rahul Ravindran is the husband of popular singer, Chinmayi Sripaada. Vanakkam Chennai was Rahul's last direct Tamil film and it is going to be interesting to see him back in Kollywood after a hiatus. With two talented performers onboard for the Tamil remake of The Great Indian Kitchen, let us hope that the film shapes up well.\n\nThe Tamil remake will be directed by R Kannan of Jayam Kondaan and Ivan Thanthiran fame. R Kannan will also be producing the film under his banner of Masala Pix. This yet to be titled film will be a Tamil / Telugu bilingual. The film talks about the problems faced by women, as a wife and daughter in law, showcasing how their dreams get shattered by the in laws. The shooting of the film began yesterday (March 22) in Chennai and the makers have released new stills featuring Aishwarya Rajesh, along with the update. The film will be shot by acclaimed Tamil cinematographer, Balasubramaniem. Details regarding the rest of the cast and crew are awaited.\n\nDirector R Kannan is keenly awaiting the release of his next film, Thalli Pogathey, which features Atharvaa, Anupama Parameswaran, and Amitash Pradhan in the lead roles. Thalli Pogathey is the official Tamil remake of the super hit Telugu film, Ninnnu Kori which had Nani and Nivetha Thomas in the lead roles. The trailer of Thalli Pogathey had received a fairly good response from the film buffs. An official announcement regarding the film's release plan is awaited."
