        "text": "NullPointer: Maybe Cabernet Sauvignon is the new VAT 69, the embodiment of all things evil 🙂\n\niba: Oh, don’t be like that. Have hope. Or as someone yelled from the back during my screening, “Thamizh Cinema Vaazhga!” (though he said it out of utter frustration) 🙂\n\nAnand: Films work on the standards they aim for and set for themselves. Appidi paatha, all films that attempt at least something above the norm are automatically good films. Of course we should make note of the fact that the director has tried these different things. (And if this had been a review, I’d have dwelt on them.) But finally, the film has to work, and not just because it’s better than Virudhunagar. BTW, please do not say bad things about Singam 🙂\n\nAbout the film playing better had it been a straightforward police investigation, I don’t think so. Then it would have become even more of a Shankar padam — begin with mysterious deaths and reveal a wronged vigilante. I can see what Sasikumar is trying to do and I like his anthropological approach in theory — give us a wealth of detail about who these people are and where they come from, and the pull the rug from under us by bringing in a protagonist only in the second half. That this didn’t work is a matter of execution; as conception, it’s a damn good (and damn ambitious) idea.\n\nSenthil: This came about because I want to write about new films (that I don’t cover in reviews or columns). And I didn’t want to spend much time on it.\n\nAs a layman who watched the film and thoroughly enjoyed it, I really do feel you are nitpicking here. It was a cogent narrative, even if lacking a bit of pace in the second half. The only blot on the canvas was the incredibly amateurish love-track between Sezhiyan and his girlfriend.\n\nAnd, for god’s sakes, this film was ANYTHING but the preachy moral commentary you make it sound like. There were no sermons on “degeneracy” like in nadodigal, and no high-falutin statements on friendship or modern-day love. Rather, Sasikumar has(mostly) just depicted things as they are in real life. Why does this irk you?\n\nIf anything, I am becoming increasingly convinced that you are bent on blowing out of proportions trivial(and sometimes non-existent) issues in good films like Naan Mahaan Alla and Easan while simultaneously magnifying insignificant silver linings in trash like Singam. I do hope you realize that while the praise or damnation of critics such as yourself means little to big-budget “commercial” films with established stars, it affects much more the films of enormously talented filmmakers like Sasikumar who have to reach into their own pockets to finance their films.\n\nBy your unwarranted acidic rant, you are only lessening the chances of seeing such different attempts in the future.\n\nBrangan sir ,\n\nMy bullets . Saw it in shanthi theater on friday …same blood !\n\n1) I think sasi was brilliant in being honest about potrayal about certain section of youth, in certain economic class ( not limited to ) . Esp the scene , where romance comes between vaibhav and Reshma – its so stupid, but thats how it can happen in certain section. If you want to see them , come to my office in Pycrofts road, i will show the rich fucker who wanted to go to bar in wallace road and entered the one way road and blocked the ambulance from other side and didn’t care a about it! (or) come to ECR and i shall show them .But i don’t think sasi had his focus to show the proportion of richness and immorality. It was just plain bad acting and finding the relevance in this screenplay thats a problem.\n\n2) “But why doesn’t this play out as interestingly as it sounds?” : I think its only because of very bad acting and background score ( subtle), coupled with the fact this just acts as a trick to create a sense of environment and throw ray of suspicion on characters (for the murder), but fails.\n\n3) Not only ring tones, how about the rama rajan song in a bar !!\n\n4) The flashback was tooooo long and by that time it finishes, i was prepared to change the channel 🙂\n\n5) I don’t know if you liked Kill Bill . I thought it was a mighty stupid film , with no story and yet 2 hours went by – reverse is this , with some kind of characterization, intelligent intent – but it was boring in parts 🙂\n\n6) Despite the bad acting , i quite liked the ‘ I will rub your ass and you mine’ sequences between the deiva nayagam and the business tycoon ( SRK ???) . Had it been enacted by seasoned actors in a film on power politics , it would have been brilliant ( When the vijay mallya resembling business tycoon scores his point , it is shown at the backdrop of cricket field – after all it is a GAME )\n\n7) I quite liked the adolescent , esp when he says ” அங்க தான் இருக்கும். போயி பொறுகிட்டு போ’- but why need a flashback scene to establish his love for his sister and bang on three malnourished guys .\n\n8) I always felt that mistakes in direction could be covered by background score and raaja does that very well , subtly introducing emotions when visuals fail to and affect ur emotional offset – James vasandhan ? Just a song composer .\n\nAbsolutely loathed this movie. Epic disappointment coming from Sasikumar after SPuram. Have many many grouses with this film but the biggest has got to be the moral absolutes and the perpetuation of these black/white, rural/urban and good/bad dichotomies the narrative entrenches. Geez – they drive you crazy!! I also had serious problems with the father’s choice following the daughter’s plight and the way it was depicted as the optimal remedy following the event. Sasikumar regressed big time with this movie, BIG TIME! And what’s with these dufuses directing each other and starring in each other’s films – rather annoying as well too. Both movies are mind-numbingly sententious, as if they are filming on issues where the public have wronged or public attitudes have receded and its their duty to educate the masses on such issues through idiotic preachy sermons such as this. Seriously, really pissed after the film.\n\nKiruba: I liked his presence. This was not an overly showy-acting kind of role, and I thought he was cast well. Sometimes finding the right man for the right job is all that’s needed — you don’t need an especially great “actor.”\n\niba: Subramaniyapuram wasn’t a “cult” hit. It was a huge success, and it’s not hard to see why — it was a standard-issue revenge melodrama (like Paruthi Veeran) that was made extremely well. It was good *mainstream* cinema, not some avant garde “cult” effort. Also, the 80s setting lent a heavy air of nostalgia to those who remembered those days.\n\nLooking back at my article about the film, I can see a lot of similarities in the whole “teeming with the business of life” type of filmmaking. Except that the director knows one milieu, and with regard to the milieu of Easan, he either doesn’t know it or has resorted to convenient cliches to make his points. Plus the whole Shankar-film hangover was a big turn-off.\n\nI’m reading this piece again and smiling at: “So, yes, maybe Sasikumar overdoes the cuteness in the love angle, and perhaps his budget didn’t quite get him the kind of cast that could have taken this film to an entirely different level of achievement.” Looking at Easan, he still can’t do love angles well, and he still has problems with his actors 🙂 (And the latter is more unforgivable here because he had a budget and a reputation and he could have gotten a rock-solid cast this time around).\n\nHarish S Ram: But movie-watching *is* about individuality, no? Play the same 24 frames-per-second to 24 people and you’re likely to get 24 reactions. How can anyone else presume to understand how YOU processed a film in your head? I think we have very different views about movie-watching 🙂\n\nThe intended thrust in my rant above was not on the “s’puram, the cult film” part, but now that Rangan Saar has spun it into a thread, my take…\n\nIf there is somethig called a non-cult cult film in tamil, this might be the one. Besides, I believe (slightly re-arranging BR’s words)\n\ns’puram is an – avant garde revenge drama – wrt tamil movies. Going under its nostalgic cloak and scratching its gory and bloodied surface (standard mainstream aspects of this genre), there is a remarkable layer of – restraint – built into it in the form of certain charcters, characterization, plot etc. It is also avant garde for tamil cinema in the sense that it heralded the arrival of critical regionalism (if I may borrow from architecture), cheerfully taken forward in later movies (kalavani, pasanga, vamsam and many more that i haven’t seen), although there might be many in this forum who might argue that the honour belongs to one mr kamal, the virumaandi 🙂 And finally, isn’t – cult – not so much in the “effort”, as much as it is in the way the effort is selectively interpreted? Can anyone – intend – to make a cult movie?\n\nApart from the numerous works of our usual suspects (kamal, mani, kb), I would like to include moondram pirai, pathinaaru vayathinilae, indru poi naalai vaa, muthal mariyathai, chennai 600028, kudaikkul mazhai, thulluvatho ilamai, kakka kakka… And tamil cinema has its share of – it’s so bad, it’s good – stuff that might also fall under this category – ramarajan, tr etc. and the list becomes quiet long then 🙂\n\nPS: Hey Ram is the pinnacle for me!\n\nvivek: “Cult” is a curious thing. In most cases, the film is an underperformer that goes on, later, to accumulate a fervent following who can quote lines and so on and help it trickle into popular consciousness — eg. The Rocky Horror Picture Show, or The Big Lebowski. The point is that there’s a “cult” around the film, a band of worshipping devotees who, unmindful of public and popular opinion, are unapologetically vocal about their love. Two recent films that I thought *could* have developed a “cult” around them are Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and Mumbai Xpress — both qualify because they are both bombs that found very small but very fervent bands of enthusiasts. And both are eccentric/mad enough to qualify for insider-joke quotes and so forth. But somehow the cult never happened. Maybe we are just a country that doesn’t do “cult” 🙂\n\nsachita: You see many people around still quoting from Oram Po (not just lines but “quoting” from the picture in their discussions and so on)? I don’t. It came. It was liked. It went. It’s not still a part of pop culture consciousness, and so it’s not “cult.”\n\niba: I wouldn’t go so far as to call Subramaniyapuram an avant garde film. But I agree that a lot of what was done there is very surprising in a mainstream format. For instance, the lazy dangling of various threads that — very, very slowly — begin to cohere into a narrative. In Easan too, I loved — SPOILERS AHEAD — tha fact that the early goings on are not tied to the plot but to the characters. That’s astonishing from the POV of writing for Tamil cinema, because here almost everything in our cinema is to do with underlining plot and narrative.\n\nIn a typical film, for instance, the girl on the scooter who died at the beginning would be “tied to the story” — she’d be Easan’s sister or something. The woman who is killed over the property dispute would be “tied to the story” — she’d be Easan’s mother or something. But Sasikumar uses these random incidents — as he did in his earlier film — to establish the character of these city boys and the politicians, the two main players in the story. This establishment of character at first seems unrelated, but it adds — in theory — to our perception of them as the actual story kicks in around interval point. It’s a different discussion, though, about why this didn’t work in practice this time around the way it worked in the earlier film."
