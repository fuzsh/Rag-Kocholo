        "text": "Today I wen to Thiagaraja Theatre in Tiruvanmiyur to watch Vandhan Vendran, a movie by R.Kannan. I have a flash back for R.Kannan. During our college days, while attending one our friend’s Brother Marriage, We visited Mayiladuthurai. After the marriage,we planned to go for a movie, We were not interested in going to any specific movie, so we planned to go the nearest theatre where they were showing Jayamkondaan that time. Half of our group were not interested to see the film, So they decided to go to Saroja, but the theatre was little far from the actual place. But we decided to go to Jayamkondan, a film by Kannan. We felt very bad for seeing that film. Sema mokkaya irunthuchu.\n\nAfter that we decided not to go to his films. And today we have seen the trailer of Vandhan Vendran. The thing which tempted me to see the film is its posters. Most of them are from Going the Distance film. So I thought it will be a remake of the film but the actual is not as expected. The Story is based on two brothers with step father. The Story starts with the flashback which forms the base line of the film. As we have seen in many film, there will be some misunderstanding between the brothers of this kind. Then the elder brother is planning to kill the younger one and escaping to Mumbai. Later he became a Don in Mumbai. And the lead role played by Jiiva has the responsibility to bring back his brother to native. So Jiiva asking his brother to surrender in Police so that he will get less punishment and will get mercy from Jury. So Jiiva tries to Convince his brother Nandha to surrender to Police.\n\nThe Story ends with the Mokka ending after Nandha decided to Surrender to the police. There are many places where logic is missing. For example: Jiiva is having a broken hand fracture, but still trying to enter to National Boxing Championship. Taapsee’s role is completely imaginatory and Jiiva expressed such a matter in a calm way adds negative points to the film. The positive thing I liked about the film is its Sound Tracks. Excellent work from Thaman, as we are seeing him from the beginning. He is a hard worker and his tracks are excellent of his style. And picturisation is good. One important thing about the film is its Comedy Track by Santhanam.\n\nSanthanam did an extra ordinary Job. As ususal movies has many counter dialogues in it.But still Santhanam is getting claps all the time when he delivers his dialogues. I could see people enjoying the film when Santhanam is on the Screen. And the next thing which requires is a dialogue delivered by Jiiva during a scene train journey with Taapsee: “En aaloda jaati teriuthu”, received many claps. Jiiva notices Taapsee showing her Undies and tries her to cover it up. That scene is really a nice scene to enjoy. And finally a little boy will ask Taapsee to cover it up. Other than that there is nothing to enjoy. You can enjoy and finally you will say: It is an Commercial movie.\n\nVandhan Vendran – They would have remaked Going the Distance film itself instead of this format."
