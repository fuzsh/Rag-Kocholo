        "text": "Biskoth is a Tamil-language comedy film that was released in 2020. The movie is directed by R. Kannan and features Santhanam, Tara-Alisha Berry, and Swathi Muppala in the lead roles. The film revolves around the life of a confectionery shop owner named Raja. Raja is a happy-go-lucky person who is always looking for ways to make a quick buck. One day, he comes across a mysterious person who gives him a magical biscuit that has the power to make him rich. Raja soon realizes that the biscuit is not just an ordinary biscuit but a magical one that can change his life forever.\n\nAs Raja starts using the biscuit to make money, he discovers that the biscuit is not just a source of wealth but also has the power to give him happiness and love. But his newfound happiness is short-lived as he comes face to face with the person who gave him the biscuit. Raja realizes that the biscuit is not a gift but a curse and that he must find a way to break the curse and return to his normal life.\n\nThe movie has a lot of comedic moments and Santhanam, who plays the lead role, delivers a stellar performance. Tara Alisha Berry, who plays Raja's love interest, shines in her role, and her chemistry with Santhanam is one of the highlights of the movie. Swathi Muppala, who plays Raja's assistant, also delivers a good performance.\n\nThe music of the movie is composed by Radhan and the songs are catchy and enjoyable. The cinematography is decent and the movie is well-paced. The director, R. Kannan, has done a good job of keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie.\n\nOverall, Biskoth is a fun-filled comedy movie that is perfect for a family watch. The movie has all the elements of a good comedy film and is sure to leave the audience laughing out loud. Santhanam, Tara Alisha Berry, and Swathi Muppala have given great performances and are the backbone of this movie. If you are looking for a comedy movie to watch with your family, then BisKoth is definitely worth checking out."
