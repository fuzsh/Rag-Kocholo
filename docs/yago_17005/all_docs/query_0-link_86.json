        "text": "Get your low down on what's happening in the Tamil film industry, right here!\n\nTamil superstar Vijay who turned 41 last month spread some good cheer by hosting an Iftar party for his Muslim friends. Dressed in a simple dhoti and blue shirt, the actor himself served the food and later sat down with them to enjoy the traditional meal.\n\nHis fans were delighted with his magnanimous gesture and pictures of him serving food have gone viral on the social media.\n\nVijay is currently working in director Chimbudevan's Puli. The actor will be seen in a dual role in this fantasy adventure along with a host of other stars like yesteryear actress Sridevi, Sudeep, Prabhu, Shruti Haasan, Hansika Motwani and Nandita.\n\nThe film is scheduled to release on September 17, coinciding with Ganesh Chaturthi.\n\n***\n\nDhanush fans go crazy over Maari trailer\n\nThe Maari trailer, which shows Dhanush as a flamboyant and bold local thug, seems to have caught the fancy of netizens.\n\nNot only has the trailer crossed over two million views, but ingenious movie lovers have come up with their own versions of the trailer.\n\nFollowing the same template, these trailers feature their favourite stars mouthing Dhanush's clever punches.\n\nThere are over half-a-dozen variations of the trailer featuring popular celebrities like Rajinikanth, Vijay, Ajith and even Dhoni and The Joker.\n\nMaari is directed by Balaji Mohan of Vaayai Moodi Pesavum fame and has music by Anirudh Ravichander.\n\n***\n\nVishnu Vishal to star in director R Kannan's Poda Aandavane En Pakkam\n\nWith three consecutive hits â€“ Mundasupatti, Jeeva and the recently released Indru Netru Naalai - actor Vishnu has plenty of reason to smile.\n\nEven as he is awaiting the release of director Seenu Ramasamy's Idam Porul Yaeval, in which he shares screen space with Vijay Sethupathi, the actor has signed his next project.\n\nHe will be teaming up with director R Kannan (Jayam Kondaan) for a rom-com titled Poda Aandavane En Pakkam (a famous dialogue of Superstar Rajinikanth).\n\nPrayaga (Pisaasu) will play the female lead. The crew has plans to shoot some romantic scenes at the newly launched Chennai Metro rail."
