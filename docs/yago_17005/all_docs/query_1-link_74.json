        "text": "The film received positive reviews and lauded by critics for its simplicity in its presentation. The film was described by Sify.com as a \"breezy entertainer\", with the reviewer taking a liking to the film, comparing Jayamkondaan to the films Run, Sandakozhi and the Malayalam film Kireedom. The script and direction is described as \"successful due to straightforward narration and packaging\". Lekha Washington's performance was praised, citing that she \"sparkles as the half sister in a well etched role\" and is \"the surprise packet and has the credentials to make it big\". Vinay \"looks too thin and fragile\" but \"adds to the film's energy\", while Bhavana has nothing much to do other than \"looking prim and proper\". Out of the comedians, Sify reports that Krishna and Santhanam were more effective than Vivek who at times you feel speaks more dialogues than necessary. Praise is also heaped on Athisaya as the small town girl who gets enamored by the rowdy, describing her as a \"revelation\", while Kishore \"fits the bill as the bad guy\"."
