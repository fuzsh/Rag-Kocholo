        "text": "The trailer of actor Santhanam‘s next film Biskoth is out now. Helmed by director R Kannan, the film is being bankrolled by his Masala Pix banner in association with MK Ramprasad’s MKRP Productions. Though the actor has worked with the director in films like Jayam Kondaan (2008) and Kandaen Kaathalai (2009), this will be the first time Santhanam is working as the director’s leading man.\n\nThe film will see Santhanam playing three roles, one from the 18th century, one from the 80s, and one from the current times.\n\nThe swiftly cut trailer offers a glimpse into the three timelines, and Santhanam is his usual sarcastic self in all three periods. He’s also got his popular counterpart ‘Motta’ Rajendran to tease especially in the 18th-century portions that are a parody of the magnum opus Bahubali.\n\nALSO READ: Biskoth First Look Poster\n\nThe makers have conveniently modified dialogues and sequences to match the coronavirus situation be it the necessity of wearing a mask, social distancing, or even the questions pertaining to theatrical and direct OTT releases. While Tara Alisha Berry appears for a few seconds explaining her immature theory on relationships, Swathi Muppala (Laya) is seen to be the damsel in distress calling out for her Raja (Santhanam) in the trailer.\n\nWe also find a short montage of an orphanage being wrecked by a bulldozer and Santhanam commenting on how humanity no longer exists.\n\nSanthanam took to Twitter to release the trailer.\n\nThe 80s character will reportedly reprise actor Kamal Haasan‘s role from his 1982 film Sakalakala Vallavan while the 18th-century character is a king named Rajasimha. The film talks about a young boy who works in a biscuit factory and ultimately reaches the top of the ladder.\n\nTara Alisha Berry will be seen opposite Santhanam for the second time after their comedy entertainer A1 while Swathi Muppala marks her Kollywood debut with the film.\n\nSowcar Janaki will be essaying the actor’s grandmother in the film which is her 400th film. She was last seen in the Karthi starrer Thambi. Apart from her, Anand Raj, Sivashankar, and ‘Lollu Sabha’ Manohar have also landed important roles.\n\nArjun Reddy/ Adithya Varma fame Radhan is composing music, 96 fame Shanmuga Sundharam is handling camera, Selva RK is editing and Rajkumar is helming art. Hari Dinesh is handling stunts, Priya on costumes, and Sandy and Sathish choreographing dance. Kiruthiya and Radhan have penned the lyrics.\n\nRecently, Kannan spoke of the sets that were constructed at Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad for the character belonging to the 18th century. He mentioned about the cooperative nature and dedication of Santhanam on set and said that the film will be for him what Imsai Arasan 23am Pulikesi was for comedian Vadivelu. He also added that he’s confident that the film will refresh the minds and pump the energy of audiences post-lockdown.\n\nRead: ‘Biskoth’ Will Be For Santhanam What ‘Imsai Arasan 23am Pulikesi’ Was For Vadivelu: Director Kannan\n\nThe first look poster of the film was also unveiled a few months back. With the final cut ready, the film will see a release in theatres post-lockdown. Trident Arts‘ R Ravindran will be releasing Biskoth.\n\nWatch the trailer of Biskoth here.\n\nWhile Santhanam’s previous film Dagaalty helmed by Vijay Anand did not do well at the box office, his long-pending release Server Sundaram helmed by Anand Balki is still awaiting a theatrical release. Rumours have also surfaced that the film might opt for an OTT release if the deal comes through.\n\nHe also has two films in the pipeline that are in different stages of production—debutant Karthik Yogi’s Dikkiloona ready for release, and A1 fame director K Johnson‘s untitled halted at the first leg of shoot.\n\nWatch the teaser of Dagaalty here:"
