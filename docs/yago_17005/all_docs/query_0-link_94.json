        "text": "It is more or less confirmed that there would be only three Tamil releases for Diwali 2009- Jayam Ravi’s Peranmai on Friday (Oct 16), Suriya’s Aadhavan on Saturday (Oct 17) and Namitha’s Jaganmohini on Saturday (Oct 17).\n\nTwo other small films which had earlier boasted that it would come out for Diwali- Adhe Neram Adhe Idam and Sa Bu Thri have backed out, due to lack of theatres and commitment from distributors.\n\nThe three Diwali films boxes have left Chennai labs during the last three days for overseas markets. The last box to leave for overseas markets where each country will have its own censorship was Namitha’s Jaganmohini on Monday night.\n\nNinaithaale Inikkum\n\nNinaithaale Innikum audio rocks much better than the releases of the Sun Pictures Division. Since this film was remaked of “COLLEGES” from Kerala were its has great hit at Kerala, Soon it would be expected in Tamil also.\n\nThe Director Kumaravelan was assisted by KAMAL. Actor Prithiviraj and Shakthi (Vasu’s Son) plays a vital role and Sweet heart Priyamani was also playing role. Were its comes a triangular love story as were heared before but giving in a different style on which the film has enthuastic.\n\nMoreover, Music done by Vijay Anthony was good and its sounds well. But also some wordings inthe song are not heard, a little clear in the words would make the songs to be feel better. The film is to be released by\n\nSEPTEMBER 4, 2009\n\nDon’t Miss it Out !!!!!!"
