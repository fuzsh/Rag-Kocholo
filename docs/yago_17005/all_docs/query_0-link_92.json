        "text": "Santhanam's Biskoth is all set to hit the screens as a Diwali treat this year and is incidentally also the first Tamil film to be releasing in theatres across Tamil Nadu after operations of cinema halls across the country and the state were suspended due to the lockdown and the coronavirus pandemic. R. Kannan of Jayamkondaan, Kanden Kadhalai, Ivan Thanthiran and Boomerang fame has directed this comedy entertainer, which is set to be revolving around three different time frames. The official synopsis of Biskoth is as follows: \"The story revolves around 3 generations where the three individuals played by Santhanam and they have no relation to each other. The mysteries and correction of mistakes in the past forms the story.\"\n\nThe visuals of Biskoth so far have revealed to us that the film will include a historical time period, retro portions and a modern day scenario. The trailer released a while back during the pandemic received a positive response and showcased some of the light-hearted moments that will be shown in the film. Produced by director R. Kannan himself under his Masala Pix banner in association with MKRP Productions, promotions for Biskoth are being carried out extensively with the makers now releasing a sneak peek video, featured on Santhanam and 'Motta' Rajendran. The promo shows both stars portraying the characters essayed by Prabhas and Sathyaraj in the global blockbuster Baahubali films. The scene is a short spoof of Santhanam as Prabhas' Baahubali and 'Naan Kadavul' Rajendran as Kattappa portrayed by the veteran Sathyaraj.\n\nThe Baahubali factor in Biskoth raised the curiosity among many even after the release of the trailer and the makers continuing to promote the historical portions is already a hint that it will be a big highlight in the film. Santhanam will be seen opposite Tara Alisha Berry for whom it is her second outing with the comedian-turned-hero after the success of A1. Yesteryear actress Sowcar Janaki will also be appearing in an important role in Biskoth, which incidentally is her landmark 400th film as an actor. Swathi Muppala, 'Lollu Sabha' Manohar, Anandaraj, 'Aadukalam' Naren form the remainder of the supporting cast, with Adithya Varma fame Radhan scoring the film's music, followed by Shanmuga Sundaram for the cinematography.\n\nWatch the Biskoth - Sneak Peek 01 | Santhanam, Tara Alisha | Radhan | R. Kannan below:"
