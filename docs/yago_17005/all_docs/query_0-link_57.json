        "text": "He raced to the winning post with his very first film, Jayam Kondaan . The tale of an IT professional returning from abroad to discover unpleasant home truths, his playful romance with a childhood buddy and the tumultuous relationship with his step-sister struck a chord with the audience. The fact that it was a “good looking” film added to the experience. His second film, Kandaen Kaadhalai , a remake of the Hindi superhit JabWe Met , cemented his position.\n\nAnd now director R. Kannan, a former associate of Mani Ratnam and Manobala, is on a hat-trick with Vandhaan Vendraan , starring Jiiva, Nanda and Tapsee Pannu. The film is slated for release on September 16. “I'm tense. But, I'm confident too. I would rate this as my most accomplished work yet,” says Kannan.\n\nThe film boasts performers who are riding high on the popularity charts. Jiiva, who plays a boxer, is fresh from the success of Ko . Viewers will get to see Tapsee, who plays the U.S.-returned daughter of an industrialist, after the critically acclaimed Aadukalam. There's Nandha, playing a typical Mumbai boy, and Santhanam with his brand of comedy. “Most of all, I'm very happy with the script. I slogged over it for two years. I take very little time to shoot (he took only 75 days to wrap up this one!). It's the pre-production that I agonise over,” says Kannan.\n\nThe director picked up this ability to plan from Mani Ratnam. “His homework is pucca . Now, I too head to the shoot only after everything, from the heroine's dialogue to the dress rehearsal and the dances, has been taken care of.”\n\nAs for the performers, the director says the Jiiva-Tapsee chemistry is beautiful on screen. “Santhanam always helps take the story forward. He's done that here too. As for Nandha, he sports a new look. I believe it will be a turning point in his career,” says Kannan, who shot his first film after an arduous 15-year struggle in tinsel town.\n\nVandhaan Vendraan has been described as a romantic thriller, an action thriller and so on. But Kannan prefers to call it a “wholesome entertainer”. He says, “It's not an out and out love story. There's a nice mix of action, romance, emotion and comedy. And, it'll have my touch.”\n\nHow different is the Kannan of VV from his earlier self? “I've grown so much,” confesses Kannan. “I've learnt to focus on things that really matter and stick to showing things realistically. I've matured as a filmmaker.”\n\nKannan says thanks to all his struggles, he wants to be positive. Hence his films are titled Jayam Kondaan, Kandaen Kaadhalai and Vandhaan Vendraan — “I know how I've yearned for success. I believe people experience good vibes when they hear a positive-sounding title.”\n\nWhat does he prefer, directing an original script or a remake? “I did Kandaen Kaadhalai because the scripting of VV was taking a while. I took on the movie as a challenge because it had become a super duper hit in Hindi and there was great hope from the Tamil version. I don't think I let people down,” he smiles.\n\nKannan says the VV team is dear to his heart. “Jiiva is a director's actor and cooperates beautifully. We never let our egos come in the way and decided to give the film all we could. Thaman's music has shaped up well and P.G. Muthiah has crafted each frame beautifully.”\n\nAs for talkative heroines, a leitmotif in his films, Kannan says they mirror reality. “Today's girls are bold, chirpy and strong-willed. I'd like to show them as they are on screen.”\n\nThe director is now busy with the post-production and promotion of the film. “I'm not even thinking of my next one. But, I have some scripts ready. Let's see what I'll work on. A romance? Possibly. But, one thing's clear. While genre-hopping is something I'd like to do, I'd like to be remembered as a director who took formulaic films to another level.”"
