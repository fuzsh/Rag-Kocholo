        "text": "Across\n\n3. The student could easily discuss all my favourite questions like 'Well, guys, what is a proxy war? 'How did the Watergate bug damage the Elephants' reputation?' 'How has Iran changed over the last 40 years?' An yeah, estudianes, I do admit, his hair is also nicer than Liidia's:)\n\n5. A pleasant, cheerful and modest guy, but when his phone is switched on he himself is switchef off. Occupies the best place in the classroom - far from the teacher, close to the girls.\n\n6. A brilliant athlete and an impressive polyglot; highly organised, broad-minded and patient girl who seemingly has 30 hours a day rather that 24. I certainly learnt more from her than she from me.:)\n\n9. A diligent and responsible student with a brilliant sense of humour. Never wasted a single moment - when English tasks were done he mastered his basketball skills in our classes. I didn't really mind, in the ministry of education they call it ainevaheline lõiming.\n\n10. An excellent athlete, a founding member of PMG Spanish language fan club. Got an Oscar at the age of 16 and will certainly get many more awards for his convincing portrayal of Don Henton Figueroa in the latest movie „PMG. Beyond Expectation“.\n\n13. One of those famous girls from Speculo spectacular team. A serious, calm, and a bit tired of learning English, Spanish, and other stuff.\n\n14. Another excellent sportsman at PMG, pretty shy and quiet but he is improving thanks to some funny-sunny mates. Industrious student who has no imperfections at all. Oh well, his Spanish teacher will certainly find some.\n\n16. Sweet, kind and cheerful girl, the soul and the heart of our English group. Everything she does is always done perfectly well. Excellent communicator, film expert, open-minded and caring schoolmate. A real sunshine (but not Ra).\n\nDown\n\n1. Never studies but always gets an A. Even when he lost his English books, he still was always getting straight A-s. Broad-minded young man who is constantly busy with school affairs and obviously has a part-time job at Toompea.\n\n2. Saved energy at ordinary lessons to do his best at C1 exam. During his English classes in grade 10 normally hunted somewhere in a school cafeteria. Then he discovered a new superpowerful method of learning English subconcially – literally while sleeping in the classroom. But his sweet personality makes up for all those little imperfectios.:)\n\n4. The two girls normally do their tasks quietly and fast, then have time for enjoying the beatlutiful sights from the window which in fact is an art of observation. Calm, polite, and very stylish. Put their names in alphabetical order.)\n\n7. The person is normally 1 unit ahead of the class. All tasks are done very neatly in a beautiful hand-writing so that Indrek can easily copy-paste.\n\n8. Comes and goes, never panics and is always calm. Independent, serious and confident. A person who can miraculously pass 3 previously skipped tests on one day. And it's not Ra.\n\n11. A serious and strong snowy queen with a warm smile. The girl who in difficult times made our English group great again.\n\n12. An excellent learner of foreign languages, a calm, patient and modest girl. An expert in mystical realism, tie breaks, drop volleys, subjuntivo, pretérito perfecto, and many other things some people have hardly heard of.\n\n15. Well-mannered, stylish, quick-witted young gentleman. A Math fan who speaks a number of exotic languages such as Engtonian,Estrus, Engrus, Spanglish, etc. Despite his absences I do hope he knows what his English teacher's name is.)"
