        "text": "These words describe people who are willing to consider new ideas or different ideas from their own before making a decision or a judgment.\n\nOpen-minded is the word with the broadest meaning. It refers to someone who is willing to consider new ideas or ideas that are different from their own.\n\nThe opposite of open-minded is narrow-minded.\n\nFor more opposites of open-minded, see the article at narrow-minded.\n\nA common word to describe people who are willing to accept ideas or behaviors that are not theirs, even if they do not agree with those ideas or behaviors, is tolerant. Tolerant is used especially to refer to groups of people.\n\nYou can also call that person broad-minded. Broad-minded is an approving word.\n\nThe opposite of tolerant is intolerant.\n\nA person who is willing to listen to and accept new ideas is receptive. Receptive is slightly more formal than tolerant, and usually implies that a person will accept an idea and agree with it.\n\nA person or group who respects and allows many different types of beliefs or behaviors can be called liberal.\n\nThe opposite of liberal is illiberal. Illiberal is much more formal than liberal.\n\nThere are several words for people who rely on facts to help them form an opinion or judgment. If a person has an open mind about something, they wait until they have all the information or facts about it before forming an opinion or making a judgment about it.\n\nA person or group who is unbiased ignores their own feelings about something and only considers the facts and information about that thing before forming an opinion about it.\n\nWhen a person is non-judgmental, they do not form any negative opinions about someone or something and instead are willing to listen and consider what is being said.\n\nWhen organizations or large groups are willing to accept many different ideas or different groups as part of their own group, you can say they are inclusive."
