        "text": "In my opinion people are not more open minded in cities...\n\nI'd say that is more simply that there are more people, so there will be more openminded people, and more openminded groups of people.\n\nOfcourse, that means there will be more closeminded people.\n\nYou would probably find some extremely openminded people, and some extremely close minded people.\n\n0\n\nI think a combination of diversity and a sense of local community is best. There are parts of London where no one seems to know their next door neighbour, which is hardly likely to lead to an open minded and tolerant atmosphere.\n\nI think my very ordinary, not posh, but stable bit of London is brilliant. We have almost as many nationalities as houses in our bit of road, including the Romanians (gay), Indians, Sri Lankans, Irish people, Mauritians, Polish (lots), a white/black Jamaican family and the Tibetan gurkha. It was rather charming on the Queens diamond jubilee weekend seeing everyone sitting together chatting in bad English and eating union jack cake.\n\nPeople tend to be less open minded if they feel (to use Margaret Thatcher's regrettable phrase) 'swamped'. Few people like to be the only white person left in a road that is otherwise all South Asian. Mercifully that is not a common phenomenon on the whole - most cities are pretty mixed.\n\n0\n\nGenerally, yes. It's because there is a bigger mix of people in cities, and more variety in terms of things to do and things going on. Consequently people who grow up in cities tend to have a wider range of experiences in their formative years, which makes them less likely to be wary of anything or anyone different.\n\n0\n\nAnother factor is that urban life tends to be more anonymous. This means anyone with any kind of 'alternative' lifestyle is more able to be themselves without fear of curtain twitchers and infringing some Byzantine notion of 'community standards.' This empowers certain sections of the community to be more visible, and greater visibility tends to lead to greater acceptance.\n\nThere was a study on acceptance of gay people in various parts of the US a few years ago that found similar results. It found that acceptance had grown the most in areas that were relatively liberal to begin with, while the country bumpkins lag further and further behind.\n\n0\n\nI live in a mostly white working class area and racist and homophobic comments are common in pubs. One bloke in particular gets on my nerves with his constant ranting about gays and as he's a rugby league fan, can't wait to call footballers gay to the annoyance of most of the pub, as anyone who criticises his beloved sport, will get a mouthful\n\n0\n\nGenerally speaking, yes.\n\nJust come back from 2 weeks in London, (I lived there for 30 years on and off), and the striking impresion left is, by and large; just how well people of different ethnic backgrounds do rub along together.\n\nYes it's always nice when that happens. Thing is, London isn't quite the diverse utopia it likes to think of itself as. It's like there's a thin veneer covering over all the divisions beneath. Or at least, that's how it is in some quarters. While I was living there, I spoke to a Sri Lankan guy who said he lived in a nice area - because there were hardly any black people. I was quite taken aback.\n\n0\n\nI don't think it has anything to do with location, I think it's to do with intelligence, though I'm even starting to doubt that maybe it has more to do with life experience or awareness. There are people on here who post intelligently but seem to be blissfully unaware that not everyone has the same living conditions or circumstances.\n\n0\n\nI don't think it has anything to do with location, I think it's to do with intelligence, though I'm even starting to doubt that maybe it has more to do with life experience or awareness. There are people on here who post intelligently but seem to be blissfully unaware that not everyone has the same living conditions.\n\nI think that there's a problem as soon as the question is asked in the first place. Is this type of person better than that type of person?\n\nIf you think like that then it suggests that you yourself are vulnerable to succumbing to bigotry.\n\nIf you believe that the categorization of types of people can lead to a reliable opinion of them as a whole then that in itself is the foundation of bigotry isn't it?\n\nIf most people answered \"Yes, that type of person is worse than the other type of person\", then what are you supposed to do with that information? Just feel that this opinion has been validated by the majority?\n\nWould you not then become the bigot yourself if this is the approach you took to form such an opinion?\n\n0"
