        "text": "(92 mins, 15)\n\nDirected by Chris Noonan; starring Renee Zellweger, Ewan McGregor, Emily Watson, Bill Paterson\n\nThe title, Miss Potter, refers not to Sally Potter, director of Orlando, nor to Pansy Potter, 'the Strongman's Daughter,' in the Beano, nor to some neglected sister of the better known Harry, but to Beatrix (1866-1943), creator of such immortal figures as Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddle-Duck and Pigling Bland. It might well be that the last named so impressed Australian director Chris Noonan that he decided to wait a decade to follow up his debut, the jolly porcine parable Babe, adapted from Dick King-Smith's children's novel.\n\nSadly, he and his American screenwriter, Robert Maltby Jr, collaborator on several inconsequential Broadway musicals, have come up with a dull English Heritage film that will appeal neither to children nor discerning adults and will only add slightly to the already sizeable number of visitors to the Lake District.\n\nThe film should have been called 'The Potters of Kensington' for the way the repressed Beatrix escapes from her rich, snobbish Victorian parents home a la Elizabeth Barrett Browning in The Barretts of Wimpole Street, or 'The Three Loves of Beatrix' inasmuch as it centres almost entirely on her passion for animals, her brief, tragic affair with her publisher Norman Warne and her companionate marriage at the age of 47 to country solicitor William Heelis.\n\nThe central shortcoming of this cliche-ridden, chocolate-boxy film is not the endless ways it distorts (actually flattens out) the facts. Nor is it the casting of Renee Zellweger: her English accent is quite acceptable and she looks like a sweet little animal, a hamster to be precise. It is that the movie turns an extraordinary life into an ordinary one and sells its heroine short.\n\nThe movie inevitably touches on her genius as an author-illustrator of children's books, but what interests the makers is the popularity and commercial success she achieved, not the nature of her art. Graham Greene, in a 1933 essay that was initially conceived and published as a parody of pretentious psychoanalytic criticism, rightly praised her as a major realist, 'an acute and unromantic observer, who never sacrifices truth for an effective gesture'.\n\nThis truth comes from a lifelong fascination with English flora and fauna that made her one of the great naturalists of her day. Sadly, the male-dominated scientific establishment refused to recognise her gifts, though the Linnaean Society was later to make certain amends.\n\nThe movie does praise her work as a conservationist, but this comes right at the end. By having her talk to her drawings (and having them come to life before her eyes), the film patronises her, making her out to be cute and whimsical. The most vulgar example is Jemima Puddle-Duck, wiggling her butt like a chorus-line floozie.\n\nWhile Noonan and Maltby show Beatrix insisting on high standards of production and low prices, there is no mention of the tough business sense that made her a serious precursor of Walt Disney in the way she exploited her creations with merchandising spin-offs, or the manner in which, like Walter Scott, she helped save her publishers from bankruptcy when one of the partners fiddled the books and went to jail.\n\nSymbolic perhaps of the film-makers' failure to deal seriously with her subject is a flashback in which the little Beatrix uses two pet mice to enact the genesis of her future classic The Tale of Two Bad Mice , only to break off before explaining what the story is about. If the film is pretty much a failure, production designer Martin Childs's attractive sets (forming a nice contrast between the Potters' town house and Hill Top Farm, Beatrix's Lakeland home) and Anthony Powell's tasteful costumes rise above their disappointing context."
