I also waited for an hour when he said we would meet at 'half three', which in most European languages will mean two thirty - when what he meant was half past three.

If they respond \"We can't hear you\" then crank it up. I tutor English with children of an international Canadian charity I support. I can tell you, it can be a humbling experience, given some of the questions that are asked of me. They definitely keep me on my toes.

Schools generally teach \"the Queen's English\" or BBC news presented English as mentioned.\n\nBecause of this, the range of contractions, colloquialisms, slang and alternative words do not exist in many people's vocabularies. Even in Western Europe where I have many friends, and lived for a few years, I find that the only people who understand American slang or colloquialisms are (generally) those who watch American TV programs. If they live in a country that uses subtitles in the local vernacular to assist in translating OV (Original Version) programming, their uptake rate for colloquialisms and slang is relatively higher.\n\nYou will experience this in Portugal where they subtitle English language programming in the evenings. However, in Spain, France, and Italy, the opposite is true. I rather suspect there is a huge pool of dubbing actors in these countries who would be unemployed if subtitles were ever introduced... One does wonder...\n\nIn any event, I always try to speak English, as we \"colonials\" are wont to, without contractions, colloquialisms or slang. Most \"foreigners\" seem to appreciate that. Whenever the situation calls for a colloquialism, I always introduce it by stating that, \"we have a saying, that...\" You would be surprised at how many of our folksy sayings are replicated around the world, across cultures and languages. Many originated overseas and came to the States with immigrants.\n\nEvery day is a learning process.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nmovinmaggie\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2015\n\nApr 4, 2016\n\n#29\n\nYears ago I read a very interesting book, The Story of English, by Robert MacNeil, which deals with the evolution of English in different parts of the world.

The native English-speakers among us spent a lot of time translating English to English. Everybody was speaking English in class, but this person couldn't understand that person's accent, so those of us in the middle would \"translate\" - just restating what people said in a neutral accent.

I remember my 2014 language experience on Invierno in Pobla de Brollon. I phoned ahead to reserve a room and was also asked where I'm coming from. So I told the men on the other side that I'm from Slovenia. When I came to the pension the owner and his wife were relaxed that I finally arrived (1 hour later than announced) and I ordered cold beer and went outside. But before getting to the exit I thought I've heard \"What a lovely girl\" spoken in Serbian/Croatian. Turned out that the owner was Portuguese, fled to France (from army-draft for Angola war) under Salazar and worked in France in iron mills mostly with guys from former Yugoslavia (Slovenia was part of it so I know the different languages spoken then and now). We've had lots of laughing on that \"pretty girl\" account and later in the evening we were sitting in his garden talking for three hours about economical/political/historical issues in Europe. In mix of Spanish, some ex-Yugoslavian languages (not the correct term!!!), English, mimic, Portuguese and French.\n\nThat is surely one of my fondest memories from my Caminos.\n\nmovinmaggie\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2015\n\nApr 5, 2016\n\n#39\n\nIt seems to me that while I was in Galicia last summer, saying \"Hola\" was a sure sign to the locals that I was a tourist.

In France the standard polite form when you encounter another person (and in provinces, even complete strangers in the streets, or when boarding a bus) is \"Bonjour\".

To the extent one can, I think it is courteous to use the language of the country we are visiting even if we are not sure of the most polite form -- nobody will expect it of a foreigner really.

He told me it was much easier to understand a South African accent. I am used to Swiss French and can understand a Belgian French at a pinch. His Occitane French was a challenge. I hate to think what the Spaniards though of my Spanish accent. Duolingo is Latin Spanish, I started in Sevilla so that was my 'home' accent with all the lovely \"th\"ing. Then I started walking with a Canary and picked up bits of his funny accent. And he happily admitted that his English was Pakistani Cockney. Having watched too many episodes of The Bill, I had to agree.\n\nFrom my limited experience of Canadians, the Newfie accent fits well with some of the Southern NZ accent - which is very Scottish - and of the various US accents, my MN friend is the one with the least accent.

A prime example is the grammatical after-perfect or immediate perfective. For instance: \"I am just after coming from Pamplona\". Every Irish person will know what is meant but the use of \"after\" will sound odd, if not confusing, to other English speakers. Better to say: \"I have just come from Pamplona\". There is nothing incorrect in the Hiberno-English use of \"after\" - it is just not part of the standard English spoken in the UK, the USA, Canada and other English speaking countries. It derives from the Irish language which was once widely spoken in Ireland but no longer is. Irish grammar norms found their way into the way English was spoken in Ireland and they have survived to this day.\n\nIncidentally, when on the Camino my standard greeting is \"Good Morning\" or \"Good Afternoon\" rather than \"Hola!\". This is not to disrespect the language of the country through which I am walking or the majority of pilgrims who are Spanish - it is simply to advertise the fact that I am an English speaker and it can result in conversations with other walkers that might not otherwise happen.\n\nI would completely understand what you meant by saying 'I am just after coming from Pamplona,' John. Hanging around Newfoundlanders for a great deal of my life, and their delightful English, I have heard from them this exact same thing. Newfoundland English dialects are similar to West Country in England and Ireland's southeast...\n\nAs one of the oldest places of English settlement in N. America and because as an island that was (is) somewhat difficult to get to, Newfoundland English is a virtual language time capsule--it's been dated back to the 1700s (where many words and dialects remain similar to that time)!\n\nLast edited: Apr 7, 2016\n\nHeidiL\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrancés2005, Portugués, Madrid, Plata, etc; hospi\n\nApr 7, 2016\n\n#52\n\nAt work I have a lot to do with EU officials, and I have finally figured out what \"EU English\" is.

We should also be careful to use plain English rather than colloquialisms or slang. This would require little effort on our part, but could mean a lot to others present.\n\ne.g. 'colloquialisms'\n\npsychoticparrot\n\npsychoticparrot\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nApril, May (2017)\n\nApr 9, 2016\n\n#55\n\nWhen I was in Managua, I understood my non-English-speaking Nicaraguan housekeeper better than I could understand some rural farmers in North Carolina (I'm a Pennsylvanian, three states away). When I was visiting my aunt in NC, her farmer neighbor spotted me and asked if I wanted to take home some \"arsh tayers.\" Arsh tayers? What the heck are those?\n\nWe backed and forthed several times without getting anywhere until my aunt came out and translated. \"Arsh tayers\" in rural NC means \"Irish potatoes,\" which didn't get me much further along until my aunt told me that in the US South, Irish potatoes means \"white potatoes.\"\n\nIt took a while, but it's worth learning the basics of other languages.\n\nBTW, those arsh tayers were mighty tasty.\n\nCatherineAnn\n\nCF summer 2016\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Frances (2012)\n\nCamino Frances (2016)\n\nApr 9, 2016\n\n#56\n\nThis topic reminds me of a hard lesson I learned from a rude French man.
