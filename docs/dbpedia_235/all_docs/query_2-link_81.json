        "text": "I started to address your question, but then realized it's actually more complicated than I had thought.\n\nFirst, look at Oxford's definition of the adjective liberal-minded:\n\nIn early use: having a generous character or disposition. Later: holding liberal opinions; tolerant, broad-minded.\n\nNow, look at its definition of the adverb liberally:\n\nIn large or generous amounts.\n\n‘she quotes liberally from the Bible’\n\n‘steaks liberally sprinkled with salt and pepper’\n\n‘large firms contributed liberally to the relief fund’\n\nIn a way that is not precise or strictly literal; loosely.\n\n‘the law is interpreted liberally’\n\n‘the obligations of treaties should be liberally construed’\n\nIn a way that involves broadening a person's general knowledge and experience.\n\n‘liberally educated students’\n\nIn a way that favours individual liberty and moderate political and social reform.\n\n‘I used to think more liberally’\n\nA liberal-minded student student makes sense. But a liberally minded student seems a little odd. Depending on the sense of liberally, it may not mean exactly the same thing—or it may mean something strange.\n\nI would say that, idiomatically, liberal-minded is what would normally be used.\n\nAs for artistic-minded student and artistically minded student, I would say that the reverse is true; that the use of the adverb is simply more common and, therefore, more natural.\n\nThere is no dictionary definition of the compound adjective artistic-minded that I can find. Without a dictionary definition, it becomes a constructed compound adjective.\n\nI'd like to say that it sounds awkward and, therefore, nobody uses it—but that's not true.\n\nA Google search turns up several uses of artistic-minded.\n\nIt's used in \"A Visit to Ceylon\" by George J. Romanes (emphasis mine):\n\nWe had, of course, read a good deal about Ceylon before, and thus knew that it was a part of the world which in point alike of natural scenery and natural history was well calculated to arouse the enthusiasm of such an artistic-minded naturalist as Prof. Haeckel; and knowing that his pen can paint almost as vividly as his brush, we were prepared for something of unusual interest in the story of his “Visit to Ceylon.”\n\nIt's used on the Centre Clark website (emphasis mine):\n\nFollowing its initial mandate, CLARK has put forth numerous projects. Not only artistic-minded, but also community and educational as well. In parallel to its’ programming, it has completed several projects – both here and abroad.\n\nSo, I can't give a good answer as to why (besides rules of grammar that would indicate one or the other) sometimes the adjective is used and sometimes the adverb is used.\n\nAlthough one form is likely more common, and that's the one that sounds more natural, it seems that it's just a matter of preference.\n\nI can speak to the use of hyphens.\n\nWhen forming a compound adjective, one where multiple adjectives are used in front of a noun, there is a series of guidelines that takes place.\n\nSome compound adjectives are joined with a hyphen and others are not:\n\nHere are some examples:\n\na five-year-old child\n\neighteen years of age\n\na second-best decision\n\nhe arrived fourth to last\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style (17th ed.) has a hyphenation guide that is twelve-pages of nothing but specific examples and guidelines; and that's in addition to several other pages of general guidelines.\n\nHowever, in general, that's why you see liberal-minded student but liberally minded student.\n\nOne specific rule from Chicago (7.86) talks about adverbs that end in ly:\n\nCompounds formed by an adverb ending in ly plus an adjective or participle (such as largely irrelevant or smartly dressed) are not hyphenated either before or after a noun, since ambiguity is virtually impossible. (The ly ending with adverbs signals to the reader that the next word will be another modifier, not a noun.)\n\nAs I understand it, the majority of style guides and grammarians follow this guideline. That's why most recipes call for finely chopped onions and not finely-chopped onions.\n\nKnowing this, I am at a loss to understand why Collins uses a hyphen in two example sentences formed by an ly adverb in its definition of -minded:\n\nI am not an academically-minded person.\n\nHe was not mechanically-minded.\n\nThis goes against common stylistic rules, and doesn't match other dictionaries:\n\n[Oxford's definition of scientifically]\n\n‘scientifically minded people’\n\n‘a scientifically important site’\n\n[Your Dictionary's definition of scientifically]\n\nIn support of this belief there is more or less scientifically ascertained evidence\n\nHowever, I can say with a fair degree of confidence that it's much more common to not use a hyphen in the constructions artistically minded students, scientifically minded students, and athletically gifted student."
