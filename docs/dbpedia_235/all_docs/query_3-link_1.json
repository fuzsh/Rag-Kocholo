        "text": "As we all know. Most aliens use a universal translator to communicate with each other. However there are also aliens than can speak English. For example it is heavily implied Mordin is speaking real English with you instead of Salarian. And Javik due to touching Shep is also speaking English. Garrus doesn't know a lot of earth phases, which would be taught in language school. So he is most likely speaking Turian with you.\n\nSo I was wondering how many aliens would know English. I can imagine Asari learn it due to their long study years, and I can see Turians studying the basics in military school.\n\nWhat do you think?"
