        "text": "Part 5 Broadminded Man\n\n*Khushi... your father is earning well. Why are you stressing yourself in the matter of nothing? Just eat and be relaxed* NK said.\n\n*Nothing...? Idiot... it's everything... our country's future... money value will fall low... we will face inflation...*\n\nNK scratched his head.\n\n*I'm an idiot... talking to an idiot who doesn't know anything...* she said wearily.\n\n*What to do, Khushi? I don't understand what you are talking about. It feels like watching an English movie without Hindi subtitles...*\n\nKhushi rolled her eyes whereas Arnav laughed.\n\n*Why are you laughing? Do you know what I'm talking about? * Khushi questioned him.\n\nArnav smiled said nothing. She rolled her eyes.\n\n*You must have known about it. After all, you are also running a business...* she said sulking.\n\nCutting her,\n\n*Really? Are you a businessman? *NK asked excitedly.\n\nArnav nodded yes.\n\n*Bhai... please take me with you... give me a small work... I will do anything if you assign... I can't survive in this village...please rescue me*\n\nKhushi dropped her jaw.\n\n*What do you know? * Arnav asked.\n\n*He knows nothing... except Ayurveda medicine names* Khushi said.\n\n*I will learn... trust me. Didn't Khushi say, I know the medicines name...? I learned it from his father... within a year. Like the same, I will learn if you give me a chance... please take me with you* he pleaded.\n\n*Why? Don't you like this job? * Arnav asked, looking at Khushi smilingly.\n\n*I'm doing this job because there is no job in our village... I belong to a poor family. I don't have money to start a business... what to do? * he said sadly.\n\n*Lie... he is a lazybones... he can't work hard... that's why he is doing this simple work...* Khushi said.\n\n*I worked in the field. My hand got broken, slipping down in the field... that's why I'm scared of working in the field*\n\nKhushi was about to say something. Arnav stopped her.\n\n*Ok... I will give you a task. If you complete it, I will take you to Delhi with me* Arnav said.\n\nNK's face brightened instantly.\n\n*Really...? Tell me...* he asked energetically.\n\nArnav gestured to him I WILL TWLL YOU LATER. NK nodded ok.\n\n*Your doctor's daughter eats a lot of chocolates, it seems...* Arnav asked smilingly.\n\nKhushi looked at him with a sarcastic expression.\n\n*No no... those chocolates are for children who come for the treatment here* Nk said.\n\n*Oh...*\n\n*Some Ayurveda medicines taste very bitter. Children cry a lot while eating that. She gives chocolate to crying children...* NK stated.\n\n*I think children would cry intentionally to get chocolates from her* Arnav chuckled.\n\n*Yeah... It happens often*\n\nArnav and NK laughed.\n\n*She buys chocolates every Saturday when she gets money* NK said.\n\n*Good...* Arnav said."
