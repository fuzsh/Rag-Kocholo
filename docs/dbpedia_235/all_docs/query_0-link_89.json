        "text": "I am learning Japanese and helping a Japanese person with English. (My English is not very good, but she still wants me to help her.)\n\nShe needed to describe someone's personality and she used \"big person\". And I didn't understand what she meant by that. I asked her what she meant by \"big person\" and she said she meant \"broad-minded person\".\n\nSo I told her using \"big\" for someone's personality is wrong. Then she asked me why, I told her it's used for describing something's size, but she didn't understand even though I told her several times.\n\nSo I wanted to tell her the word that Japanese people use for describing something's size.\n\nI searched for it on the Internet, but there are so many words that mean \"big\".\n\nSo... I don't know which one to choose. I would be so happy if someone can tell me which one I should use. Also, I am really curious why she used \"big person\" instead of directly saying \"broad-minded person\". Is that a saying in Japanese?\n\n大きな/大きい are the most basic word that means \"big\". For the difference, see: What's the difference between 大きいケーキ and 大きなケーキ?\n\nIn Japanese, 大きな人 and 大きい人 refer to either one's physical size or one's broad-mindedness/capacity, depending on the context. You can say 体が大きな人 or 心が大きな人 to avoid ambiguity. There are also other expressions that mean only one thing. 大柄な only means physically \"large\". 寛大な and 心が広い only mean \"broad-minded\". So you can explain to her using these words and phrases.\n\nThe same is true for 小さな/小さい. 小さい人 means either a (physically) short person or a petty-minded person, depending on the context.\n\nBy the way, English \"big\" can refer to an important person in a certain field (cf. Big Three), but such people are rarely referred to as 大きい人 in Japanese.\n\nanswered Feb 6, 2017 at 13:25\n\nnarutonaruto\n\n327k1313 gold badges330330 silver badges644644 bronze badges"
