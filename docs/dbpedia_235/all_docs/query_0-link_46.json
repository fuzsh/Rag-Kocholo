        "text": "Would you mind if I ask, “what’s your mood today?”\n\nThe words ‘Mind’ and ‘Mood’ are used in a variety of situations we hear them regularly… we even use these words in Hindi….”Mind mat karna” and “Aaj Mood nahin hai” etc.\n\nAre you familiar with all the meanings and usages of ‘mind’ & ‘mood’? Can you frame your sentences and understand the expressions where they are used?… Did you really mind my asking about your mood today?\n\nThese are the ‘2 words we are going to Learn today’ – with that some common expressions and more words like mindset, moody etc…So, please ‘prepare your mind’ and get into ‘the right mood’ to learn: how to confidently use these words and expressions in your everyday conversations.\n\nMIND\n\nYour mind is where your thinking happens. If you’ve made up your mind, you’ve come to a decision.\n\nMind can also mean “pay attention to” or “watch.” If someone tells you to “mind your manners,” they want you to be polite. If you tell them to “mind their own business,” maybe they’ll leave you alone. When I ask, “Would you mind if I open a window?” I’m asking if this would bother you.\n\nI am sure you have heard:\n\nRegular announcements in the Delhi Metro: “Please Mind the Gap”,\n\n“Mind your Language” the video episodes we swatch to get some fun from British Humor as it happens in Mr. Brown’s English class\n\nAll I want is some “Peace of Mind”\n\nSome more usages picked from the Media (thanks to http://www.vocabulary.com):\n\nA large part of me realized early on that it was my mind playing tricks. (BBC Oct 25, 2013)\n\nAspiring Minds research has been featured in The Economist and Wall Street Journal among other media. (Scientific American Oct 24, 2013)\n\nBut wealthy Singaporeans don’t mind spending several hundred thousand dollars on a luxury car. (BBC Oct 24, 2013)\n\nBut Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies’ laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. (BBC Oct 19, 2013)\n\nPlease keep in mind that you still have to click open this link to see all the meanings\n\nWords that come from it: Mindset, Mindful, Mindfulness, Mindfully, Mindless, Mindlessly, Mindlessness, broad-minded, narrow-minded…\n\nMOOD\n\nAre you feeling good or bad, cheerful or irritable right now? This is your mood.\n\nMood refers to how you feel at the present time and this keeps changing depending on how moody you are. If you want to ask your boss for a raise, wait until he or she is in a good mood. Don’t ask, though, if he or she is “in a bad mood” – that means the person is irritable or already irritated. If you are in the mood for something like ice cream or spicy food, you would like to have it now. Mood can also describe the attitude of a group of people or the feeling of a film, novel or piece of music.\n\nI am sure you have heard: “What’s your mood today?”; “I was not in a mood to go to the office so made a excuse”; “Let’s get into the mood and try something new.”\n\nSome more usages picked from the Media (thanks to http://www.vocabulary.com).\n\nStudies have linked repeated concussions with a chronic disease with symptoms including memory loss and mood swings. (BBC Oct 26, 2013)\n\nThey are already in militant mood, with strikes planned next week over pay. (BBC Oct 25, 2013)\n\nExpressive writing is known to help assuage psychological trauma and improve mood. (Scientific American Oct 19, 2013)\n\nWords that come from it: Moody, Moodiness, Moodily\n\nEnough knowledge of the words… “Let’s concentrate our minds and get into a mood to make our own sentences” so that speak them out before the end of the class and build your active vocabulary with these words.\n\nNow, would you mind if I ask again, “what’s your mood today?”\n\n************ End of the Post ***********\n\nLike we did words of feelings in the BASIC course, We will do usage of different Mood words in the Intermediate/Get Selected/Go Global programs. I will write about that in another post.\n\nMilestone #2: Are you Knowing how good (or bad) is you Grammar? Basically!\n\nThe caption of this post may sound ‘okay’ (or passable at the least) to a novice in English, but there surely are some basic mistakes or Indianisms as some people often call them.\n\nSo, “What are the grammar mistakes YOU make?” or ‘Do you Know how good is your BASIC Grammar?”\n\nYou know them already, they are pretty basic and the same mistakes don’t come-up when you write. Great! To know the slippages you make with your Spoken English is your Milestone #2. You could start correcting them on your own or under the guidance of a Trainer, depends on your Learning Style.\n\nOn the other hand, if you really don’t know your mistakes but are ‘often misunderstood’ by others, have to repeat your sentences when speaking to native speakers of English -you may need to be told by a fluent speaker who knows his/her English.\n\nWho would listen to your speech and pick-out the major mistakes that are connected with Grammar (or for IT people the syntax of the language). A any good trainer would almost always suggest measures to bring you back to the ‘basic rule book of spoken English’, whenever it is required. For a person, who is already speaking in English, it must start with identification of what are the problem areas and correcting the errors that can’t go with speaking the language with confidence & Ease.\n\nTypical composition and usage problems I get in my conversation in English classes in INDIA:\n\nI will call them limitations or lack of exposure to ‘right usage’ as they can be learned by speakers given the right environment to practice. The brain needs time to migrate from Hindi Grammar platform to composition and usage in Spoken English. How much time is enough depends on the intensity of your practice and knowing what’s going wrong. Read on for 7 most common grammar limitation faced by us as Indians.\n\nInability to form a sentence’ with a ‘new’ word when the meaning is also known. You may have picked this new word from a Movie or while reading the newspaper; you noted it and went on to look for the exact meaning … but can’t compose a sentence.\n\nNot knowing usage of certain Phases that are part of everyday English for example: Is it ‘Suppose to’ or ‘Supposed to’?… click to read this interesting post with some most common mistakes when you Speak-up. 17 PHRASES YOU’RE PROBABLY SAYING WRONG.\n\nI am stuck with my Indian-isms as CNN Travel’s post points it out, read 10 classic Indian-isms: ‘Doing the needful’ and more in CNN Travel. It also gives some pointer on ‘How to fix grammatically in sane phrases found in common Indian English’.\n\nImproper or excessive usage of ‘some’ words where they don’t fit: – we cover them as filler words to avoid. At the same time, my students learn to use linking words in our Intermediate course ‘GET SELECTED’ – this makes them fluent and reasonably correct & confident speakers to clear communication rounds in an interview.\n\nNot knowing enough structures to form your sentences: the problem statement is all my sentences sound the same and its so boring for the lsitener that he/she switchs off like\n\nAn essay on ‘My Cow’ when I am actually talking about ‘My Company’. Does this Sound familiar? Do you know how to form a question when you are making a request? Learn to make sentences in many different ways.\n\nImproper Application of tenses: I see ‘sentences made in present continuous or progressing tense when the speaker wants to convey a habit, routine or like/dislike or ‘I’m going’ when he/she is actually seeking a permission. This is biggest mistake people make; I also did the same as in ‘Are you knowing…’ the caption for this Post . And yes I deliberately did it! Did you notice it?\n\nWrong usage of articles, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections- I am sorry to sound like a grammar teacher or a Nerd. I not a Grammar Nazi or a Nerd (terms quite popular in the blogger’s world) but as a communication skills trainer, I can say that the basics of these have to be quite right (if not perfect) until you want to sound like a Newbie.\n\nAs long as you can understand Comics and relate with the humor its fine with me 🙂\n\nIn the end, I would like to thank Daniel D-Mello from CNN- Travel and Ms Sarah Brooks from ‘SHE KNOWS’ for helping me with this Post. Thanks! also to Peanuts one of my favorites.\n\nBoth for English and Hindi -the grammar (or rules of the game) sound similar but there are some marked differences. (Just like Cricket and Baseball). A person who plays good cricket can sure “hit the ball with a round bat” but first he must know that ‘there are No wickets” in baseball game. I will talk about the key differences between English and Hindi Grammar as well as the similarities we can ride-on in my next post… so that you don’t get out in any of the bat & ball games."
