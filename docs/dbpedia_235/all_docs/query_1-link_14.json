See ‘Meaning & use’ for definitions, usage, and quotation evidence.\n\nbroad has developed meanings and uses in subjects including\n\nHow common is the word broad?\n\nAbout 70occurrences per million words in modern written English\n\n175036176040177052178039179042180046181044182044183053184053185061186065187066188068189072190069191068192064193061194063195064196065197067198066199066200066201066\n\nHow is the word broad pronounced?\n\nBritish English\n\nbrawd\n\nU.S. English\n\nbrawd\n\nbrahd\n\nWhere does the word broad come from?\n\nThe earliest known use of the word broad is in the Old English period (pre-1150).\n\nbroad is a word inherited from Germanic.\n\nNearby entries\n\nEtymology\n\nSummary\n\nA word inherited from Germanic.\n\nCognate with Old Frisian brēd, breid, Old Dutch brēt (in place names; Middle Dutch breet, Dutch breed), Old Saxon brēd (Middle Low German brēt), Old High German breit (Middle High German, German breit…\n\nCognate with Old Frisian brēd, breid, Old Dutch brēt (in place names; Middle Dutch breet, Dutch breed), Old Saxon brēd (Middle Low German brēt), Old High German breit (Middle High German, German breit), Old Icelandic breiðr, Old Swedish bredher (Swedish bred), Old Danish breth (Danish bred), Gothic braiþs < the same Germanic base as brede n.2; further etymology uncertain, perhaps ultimately < the Indo-European base of bear v.1, although the exact nature of the formation would be unclear, and the closest semantic parallel among the cognates of bear v.1 would be Lithuanian berti to scatter. With use as noun compare breadth n. and brede n.2\n\nNotes\n\nSome early forms of the comparative (compare Old English brǣdr-) show i-mutation of the stem vowel caused by the original vowel of the suffix (see discussion at ‑er suffix3). Early parallel in Latin. Compare post-classical Latin brada (noun) broad field (c1225 in a British source, apparently < English); this sense is not directly paralleled at broad n.1, but compare the discussion (and forms) of early place names at brede n.2 Specific senses. In use with reference to cloth (see sense B.3) apparently short for broadcloth n. In use with reference to a coin (see sense B.6) short for broad piece n.; compare also slightly earlier broad gold n. The origin of the use with reference to a woman (see sense B.9) is uncertain. Use denoting the Broads of East Anglia. The uses as noun with reference to the freshwater lakes of East Anglia (see sense B.5) probably developed from earlier adjective uses designating areas of great spatial extent (compare collocations such as broad waters at sense A.I.2, and also broad water n. and broad sea n.). Such use does not seem to have originated in the context of naming, as use of the noun as a place-name element is much later (19th cent.) and evidence for phrases with broad adj.1 in early place names of that area is very limited. Compare (in the parish of Martham in Norfolk) Martham Brodee (1327; compare ea n.), apparently with reference to a stretch of water or marsh attested earlier as Breyflete (1292; compare fleet n.2), and Brodewatere (1466; now Martham Old Broad, the name of a stream), while the name Martham Broad (for a different body of water) is not attested before the 20th cent. More generally, use of the adjective with reference to various bodies of water (standing and running) is already attested in Old English and is common as a first element in boundary markers in charter bounds and in early place names in many regions; compare the evidence cited at broad water n. and also Bradewatre, the name of a hundred in Hertfordshire (1086; now Broadwater) and Bradewatre, the name of a settlement in Sussex (1086; now Broadwater) and Brademere, Nottinghamshire (1086; now Bradmore; compare mere n.1). Pronunciation history. The modern standard pronunciation developed via a shortening of the reflex of Middle English long open ō (< Old English ā) before a dental, with the resulting short vowel being lengthened again in the particular phonetic environment of this word, specifically the preceding r in conjunction with the following dental (compare the discussion in E. J. Dobson Eng. Pronunciation 1500–1700 (ed. 2, 1968) vol. II. §53). Evidence for the short vowel is found in the 15th and 16th centuries (e.g. in rhymes with God and rod), and the new long vowel is attested in a rhyme with fraud in the second half of the 16th cent.\n\nMeaning & use\n\nadjective\n\nI.\n\nWide in extent, and related senses.\n\nI.1.a.\n\nHaving great extent from side to side; of large or more than average width or breadth; = wide adj.
