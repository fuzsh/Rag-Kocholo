There are moments in life when we have to make hard choices between our roles as private individuals and as citizens with a sense of national loyalty. Discuss with reference to the story you have just read.\n\nAns. Dr. Sadao is trapped in a dilemma. On one hand, being a doctor having moral and ethical responsibility to save the wounded soldier and on the other hand, being a patriot, to let the enemy die or hand him over to the army. He fulfils his ethical responsibility, saves the man, risks his own life, his family, reputation and then later, as a patriot plans to get him killed with the help of the army general. Later on again, he helps him\n\nescape which reflects his true personality.\n\n2. Dr Sadao was compelled by his duty as a doctor to help the enemy soldier. What made Hana, his wife, sympathetic to him in the face of open defiance from the domestic staff?\n\nAns. Hana firmly follows her husband’s sense of duty although she knows that her husband’s decision is being questioned by everyone. She is humanitarian\n\nand compassionate and goes beyond her duty to perform the tasks which she is not supposed to. It is her care that helps the man recover quickly. She respects her husband and has a sense of duty towards him.\n\n3. How would you explain the reluctance of the soldier to leave the shelter of the doctor’s home even when he knew he couldn’t stay there without risk to the doctor and himself?\n\nAns. Sadao and Hana had treated the American man with a lot of kindness and warmth. The man had suffered severely at the hands of the Japanese army as he had been made a prisoner of war. This warm attitude of Sadao and Hana gave him so much relief that he did not want to leave their house. The man felt at home – safe and warm. So, even though they were at risk at the hands of the army and the people of Japan, the man was reluctant to leave them.\n\n4. What explains the attitude of the General in the matter of the enemy soldier? Was it human consideration, lack of national loyalty, dereliction of duty or simply self-absorption?\n\nAns. All his life the general had performed his duties with utmost sincerity. He realized that killing innocent men had become a burden on his soul. He understood Sadao’s mindset which indicated that he wanted to save a life irrespective of the fact that he was from an enemy country. The general also considered him to be a human being and so, excused Sadao to save his life.\n\nTop\n\nClass 12 English The Enemy Question Answers Lesson 4 – Extract Based Questions\n\nExtract-based questions are of the multiple-choice variety, and students must select the correct option for each question by carefully reading the passage.\n\nA.

He had come back at thirty, and before his father died he had seen Sadao become famous not only as a surgeon but as a scientist. Because he was perfecting a discovery which would render wounds entirely clean, he had not been sent abroad with the troops.

It had been the bedroom of Sadao’s father, and since his death it had not been used. They laid the man on the deeply matted floor.

First he was shot. Then the sea caught him and wounded him with her rocks.

These questions have been taken from previous years class 12 Board exams and the year is mentioned in the bracket along with the question.\n\nQ1 What was the main worry his father had regarding Dr. Sadao?\n\nAns. The father of Sadao took his son’s future seriously. He never made jokes or played games with him. The education of his son was his father’s first priority. Sadao was therefore sent to America at the age of twenty-two to learn everything there was to know about surgery and medicine.\n\nQ2 What state was the American soldier in when Dr. Sadao discovered him by the shore?\n\nAns. The US soldier was severely hurt, and there was already a blood stain soaking through the sand on one side of him. Sadao noticed that the man had a gunshot wound that had reopened on the right side of his lower back. If the man did not receive emergency medical attention, he would undoubtedly pass away.\n\nQ3 How did the American professor contribute to the connection between Sadao and Hana?\n\nAns Sadao and Hana first connected at the professor’s home. Hana gained Sadao’s favour. Even though the professor’s wife was quite talkative, the couple was nice, and Sadao soon moved in as a paying guest. We might therefore conclude that the American professor and his wife were crucial in bringing Sadao and Hana together.\n\nQ4 What was the father of Dr. Sadao’s vision for his son? How did Sadao become aware of it?\n\nAns Dr. Sadao’s father desired for his son to have a prosperous career. With him, he never made jokes or plays. Sadao was sent to the United States to study every aspect of surgery and medicine. Sadao eventually rose to prominence as one of Japan’s most renowned surgeons and scientists. Sadao accomplished his father’s wish in this manner.\n\nQ5 Why, despite the fact that it was an unpatriotic act on his part, did Dr. Sadao treat the American soldier?\n\nAns Dr. Sadao was taught that if he could save someone, he should never let them die. Thus, Dr. Sadao did not act in an unpatriotic manner. Even the old General was informed about the enemy soldier. Dr. Sadao did not save an American life; he merely carried out his duty and saved the life of a human.\n\nQ6 Despite learning that Dr. Sadao had been hiding the American soldier, the General did not take any action against him. Why?\n\nAns Dr. Sadao’s expertise as a physician and surgeon was required for the treatment of the General. He admitted to Dr. Sadao that no one else in all of Japan had the skills necessary to save his life. Dr. Sadao’s own death would result from any action taken against him.\n\nQ7 How did Hana help Dr Sadao?\n\nAns Hana helped her husband in the operation. She washed the injured man. While Sadao performed the operation, Hana helped him in giving the anesthetic. She acted as a nurse while her husband was performing the operation.\n\nQ8 Why had Hana personally cleaned the injured man?\n\nAns Hana asked Yumi, the governess, to help her wash the man. Yumi, however, categorically refused, stating that she had never cleaned a white guy and would never do so. And that man was their adversary. Hana was therefore forced to wash the man by herself.\n\nQ9 How could you say that the American was tortured? Who might have abused him?\n\nAns On the American’s neck’s backside, there were crimson marks. It was evident that the man had endured severe torture. The wicked General Takima of Japan was a terrible person. It’s likely that he tortured the man.\n\nQ10 Why did the housekeepers quit the Dr. Sadao residence?\n\nOR\n\nThe servants of Sadao and Hana reflect a particular mindset of the general public in society towards the thinking and broad-minded human beings. Elaborate with the help of the story “The Enemy”. (CBSE SAMPLE QUESTION PAPER 2018-19)\n\nAns A hostile soldier had received sanctuary from Dr. Sadao. The servants said that it was a treasonous act. As Japan and America were at war, they saw the Americans as their foes. They made the decision to leave Dr. Sadao’s home when they learned that he had chosen to cure the enemy soldier rather than turn him over to the authorities.\n\nQ11 Why wasn’t Dr. Sadao sent to the front lines?\n\nAns Japanese surgeon and scientist Dr. Sadao was well-known. Also, he was tending to the senior General. Dr. Sadao was not deployed to the battlefield since the General might need surgery at any time.\n\nQ12 How did Dr. Sadao eliminate the hostile soldier?\n\nAns Dr. Sadao had worked very hard to save the man. He didn’t want to turn him in to the police and end up getting him dead. So he made the choice to assist the man in using his boat to escape. He carried enough supplies onto his boat. He instructed the man to row the boat towards a nearby island.\n\nQ13 How did Dr. Sadao remove a bullet from the American soldier’s body?\n\nAns An operation was required to remove a bullet from the US soldier’s body, and anesthesia was administered to the patient. Dr. Sadao touched the instrument’s tip with a hard object, which turned out to be a bullet. After that, Dr. Sadao used his fingers to probe and carefully remove the bullet.\n\nQ14 What transpired as the second event of the afternoon? Why did this scare Hana, the doctor’s wife, so badly?\n\nAns The second event occurred in the afternoon. Hana was really alarmed when a messenger in a business suit arrived at their home. She guessed that he might have come to take her husband into custody. But, the man insisted that Dr. Sadao accompany him because the old General was in pain.\n\nQ15 How did the General respond to Dr. Sadao’s account of hiding the enemy combatant?\n\nAns Dr. Sadao went to the elderly General and told him the entire tale. Also, he informed him because he had worked hard to save the man, he didn’t want to turn him over to the police. The General now volunteered to send him hired killers. They were quite skilled and knowledgeable about internal bleeding, he claimed.\n\nQ16 What happened on the seventh day after Dr Sadao had typed the letter? (CBSE SAMPLE QUESTION PAPER 2019-20)\n\nAns The cook, the gardener, and Yumi packed up their possessions and left together on the seventh day. Hana, though, put up a strong face. The second event was the appearance of a messenger informing Sadao that he had been summoned to the palace because the general was once more experiencing pain.\n\nQ17 How do we know that Dr. Sadao was conscientious as well as loyal? (CBSE SAMPLE QUESTION PAPER 2022-23)\n\nAns Dr. Sadao was a professional who took his job seriously. He saved the soldier by carefully treating his injuries as a doctor. On the other side, he fulfilled his responsibility as a devoted citizen by alerting the General about the prisoner and by agreeing to help with the soldier’s intended assassination.\n\nQ18 The author has used ‘blood’ as a symbol in the story. Comment on its impact on the reader. (CBSE QUESTION BANK)\n\nAns Blood has an effect on readers, making them realise how racist or prejudiced nationalistic pride is.\n\nAn important part of the story’s main topic involves blood. The cook also permits the bird’s blood into the wisteria. An elaborate symbol is blood. The blood-covered doctors who are tending to both American and Japanese soldiers represent the interconnectedness of all humankind.\n\nQ19 In The Enemy, Hana’s thoughts and actions regarding Tom were in discord. Support this statement with examples from the text. (CBSE SAMPLE QUESTION PAPER 2022-23)\n\nAns Hana says that returning Tom to the water would be the most compassionate thing they could do for him, however she brings him back inside the home with Sadao. She also prevents Sadao from attempting to save Tom when he agrees to perform the surgery. Even though she gags at the sight of blood, she agrees when Sadao asks her to assist him in administering anesthesia.\n\nTop\n\nClass 12 The Enemy Long Answer Questions Lesson 4\n\nQ1 To choose between professional loyalty and patriotism was a dilemma for Dr Sadao. How did he succeed in betraying neither?\n\nAns Sadao was instructed in the medical study, not to allow anyone to perish if he or she can be helped. On the seashore close to his home, he came across an enemy soldier who was seriously hurt. If the man didn’t get the right medical care, he might die. Now, Dr. Sadao made the decision to operate on the man despite the fact that he was an enemy soldier. He gave him excellent care and attention.\n\nDr. Sadao was able to uphold his commitment to his career in this way. Yet, Dr. Sadao had a deep sense of patriotism. He was aware that harbouring an enemy soldier constituted treason. He therefore addressed a letter about it to the authorities and stored it in his drawer. Even the old General received the full account of the enemy soldier from him. Another issue is that the general did nothing to stop the enemy soldier. But Dr. Sadao managed to strike the ideal balance between his dedication to his profession and his country.\n\nQ2 Good values are far above any other value system. How did Dr Sadao succeed as a doctor as well as a patriot?\n\nOR\n\nSadao and Hana have a moral compass which urges them to save the prisoner’s life. Do we all need this moral compass? Why? (CBSE QUESTION BANK)\n\nAns Dr. Sadao embodies the higher ideals of kindness, compassion, and love for people as well as love for one’s interest. He was trained not to let someone die if he could heal them because he is a doctor. On the seashore close to his home, he discovered an enemy soldier one evening who was seriously hurt. If the man didn’t get the right medical care, he might die.\n\nNow, despite the fact that the man was an enemy soldier, Dr. Sadao chose to operate on him. As a result of his excellent care and attention, Dr. Sadao was able to uphold his commitment to his career. Yet, Dr. Sadao had a deep sense of patriotism. He was aware that harbouring an enemy soldier constituted treason. As a result, he wrote a letter about it to the authorities and stored it in his drawer. Even the old General received the full account of the enemy soldier from him. Another issue is that the general did nothing to stop the enemy soldier. As a result, Dr. Sadao was successful both as a physician and a patriot.\n\nQ3 How can you say that Sadao’s father was very serious about his son’s study?\n\nAns The father of Dr. Sadao took his son’s education extremely seriously. Dr. Sadao shared a home with his father that was perched on a cliff not far from the seashore. When he was a schoolboy, he used to play there. The Japanese beach was close to a few islands. His father frequently took him there, telling him that the Islands served as a stepping stone for Japan’s future. Sadao’s father took planning for his future extremely seriously. He never cracked jokes or made fun of him. Sadao was aware that his father was mostly concerned with his studies.\n\nAt the age of 22, Sadao was sent to America to study all there was to know about surgery and medicine. He returned at the age of thirty and went on to become a well-known scientist and surgeon. He had not been transported overseas with the Troop because he was working to perfect a finding that would completely heal wounds. We might claim that Dr. Sadao’s success as a scientist and surgeon was made possible by his father’s efforts.\n\nQ4 Explain the reaction of the servants in Dr Sadao’s house when he decided to give shelter to an enemy in the house.\n\nOR\n\nPearl Buck depicts the servants in a way to convey a message about Japanese people and culture. Support your answer with textual evidence. (CBSE QUESTION BANK)\n\nAns The concept of housing an enemy soldier did not go well with Dr. Sadao’s household staff. Yumi, the doctor’s child’s nurse, flatly declined to bathe the white man. She declared that she had never washed a white man and would never do so. The elderly gardener believed in superstitions. He declared that saving the man was pointless.\n\nHe frankly stated to Hana that the white man should not be saved. He had been shot first. He was then captured by the waves. But, they believed that Dr. Sadao had betrayed them when they learned that he would not turn the man over to the police. They chose to go from his home.\n\nQ5 Write in brief the character sketch of General Takima.\n\nAns An elderly Japanese general, General Takima. He was an extremely vicious individual. He used to brutally abuse his wife. He also brutally tormented the war prisoners. Even private assassins were at his disposal to assassinate anyone. He offered to send two of them to murder the American soldier for Dr. Sadao. They were highly adept, he claimed, and could even remove the soldier’s corpse.\n\nBut he didn’t do that later. In actuality, it was done out of selfishness. He needed the medical assistance of Dr. Sadao. He didn’t want to encounter any issues. He therefore turned the entire situation over to Dr. Sadao. While in reality he was a highly egotistical person, he pretended to be a patriot. He didn’t want him to get involved in the situation. He might have wished for Dr. Sadao to commit suicide. The General was, in fact, a highly egotistical individual.\n\nQ6 Dr Sadao faced a dilemma. Should he use his surgical skills to save the life of a wounded American POW or should he hand him over to the Japanese police? How did he resolve the clash of values? (CBSE 2015)\n\nAns Sadao is instructed as a doctor not to allow anyone to perish if he or she can be helped. On a nearby sea beach one evening, he discovers a seriously hurt enemy soldier. If the man didn’t get the right medical care, he might die. Now that the man is an enemy soldier, Dr. Sadao performs an operation on him using his surgical expertise. In this way, Dr. Sadao upholds his commitment to his profession and is able to use his surgical expertise to save the life of the POW. He treated him well and took excellent care of him.\n\nDr. Sadao is a nationalist as well, though. He therefore tells the senior General of everything. The general promises to send his personal killers to assassinate the target. But Dr. Sadao made a valiant effort to save that man. He obviously does not want that individual to suffer any damage. As a result, towards the conclusion of the tale, he aids the man on the boat in fleeing.\n\nQ7 How did Dr Sadao help the American POW to escape? What humanitarian values do you find in his act?\n\nAns Dr. Sadao put significant effort into saving the life of an American POW. He made the decision to set up that man’s escape since, of course, he did not want anything bad to happen to him and, as a result, all his efforts would be in vain. Dr. Sadao made the decision to leave his yacht on the pier. He also made the decision to put enough food on the boat. The American was wearing Japanese clothing that Sadao had provided for him, and at the last second, Sadao placed a black cloth around his blond head.\n\nHe was instructed to row the boat to a nearby island, which was uninhabited because it was submerged in the water for the majority of the year. In this narrative, the doctor demonstrates higher human qualities. He remembers his duties and commitments as a doctor despite the fact that his nation is at war with America. Even at the risk of his own life and reputation, he intervenes to save the enemy’s life.\n\nQ8 Sadao’s acceptance of the General’s plan to assassinate Tom was counterproductive to having put him on the path of recovery. Substantiate with reason/s. (CBSE SAMPLE QUESTION PAPER 2020-21)\n\nAns Although it was unwise for Sadao to agree to the General’s plot to kill Tom, doing so set him on the road to recovery. He had received assurances from General Takima that he would dispatch his personal hit men to his home, kill him, and dispose of the body. Later, when the General fell ill, he was so distraught that he neglected to send the assassins. It took Sadao three days to wait.\n\nPOW, meanwhile, quickly healed and regained his health. Sadao made the decision to assist the POW in finding a safe escape. He gave him a boat, enough food for a few days, and a lamp to use if he needed to signal for more assistance. He gave him instructions to board a Korean vessel and travel to an American base.\n\nHe had to go to the General for an examination after a few days. He brought up his pledge to send his killers. The general asked him not to divulge his forgetfulness to anybody as he may be in serious danger and charged with treason. The general also apologised for forgetting to send the assassins.\n\nQ9 Sadao and Hana look upon their time in America with disdain due to the prejudice that they were subjected to. How does racial prejudice taint a person’s soul forever? (CBSE QUESTION BANK)\n\nAns Doctor Sadao was a highly obedient and humanitarian person. He felt strongly compelled by his obligation to aid the enemy soldier. He put the needs of the American soldier ahead of the prejudices of race and nation. Without caring if the patient was a friend or foe, his wife also offered a helping hand. He was juggling his doctoral responsibilities on the one hand and the adversary on the other, but humanity and compassion won out.\n\nWhile Japan and America were at war at the time, no one could provide shelter to an enemy. He had been aware of the negative effects of racial discrimination among whites even throughout his training. His emotions of patriotism prevented him from ignoring his medical obligations because it is a doctor’s responsibility to save humanity. Here, Dr. Sadao’s sense of national allegiance and professional commitment clashed. He could have faced all charges of being a traitor, but he risked his own life to save the American soldier. He operated on him and provided for him in the most perilous circumstances.\n\nTop\n\nAlso See:"
