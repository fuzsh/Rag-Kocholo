        "text": "As the definition explains, it is a receptiveness to new ideas; in which people approach the views and knowledge of others. This can be shown in The Crucible by John’s open mind when trying to make it up to his wife, Elizabeth. He tries complimenting her and her food, excommunicating Abigail, and even tries to plan romantic frolics among the fields and woods, but not much changes at first. I as well had once had to think outside of the box to impress someone. As John kept his open mind throughout the play Elizabeth did the exact opposite. When working with the public, and a diverse staff an open mind is the best gift. I used this gift when going to my part time job at Wendy's because sometimes my co-workers can be a lot to deal with and to comprehend them its much needed. I also use this valuable quality when working with the small kids of my church. When volunteering with little children the only way to not be miserable, or confused is to use that open mind because they say some of the silliest things on occasion. They also need to have there attention kept at all times so you have to think out of the box\n\nOne example of people being open-minded is when Lennie talks to Crooks. Lennie walks into Crooks room in the stable and instead of treating Crooks cruelly, like the rest of the workers on the ranch did, he wanted someone to talk to that happened to be Crooks. Likewise, Crooks was skeptical at first of Lennie because he thought Lennie was going to treat him similarly like everyone else working there. However both were open-minded of each other and learned something that they never knew about each other. “Lennie smiled helplessly in an attempt to make friends…” “‘Nothing- I seen your light. I thought I could jus’ come in an’ set.’” “Crooks scowled, but Lennie’s disarming smile defeated him. ‘Come on in and set a while,’ Crooks said, ‘long as you won’t get out and leave me alone, you might as well set down,’ his tone was a little more friendly.” (Page 68-69). Even though Lennie and Crooks had their own opinions about each other before they meant because of others opinion about them. Instead, they decided to be open-minded and get their impression of one another. Being open-minded helps one to grow and learn about themselves and others that one did not know when they were closed-minded. In addition to being respectful, showing people that one is open-minded is a responsibility we have to\n\nI am a very opened minded person, being open minded allows me to receive criticism and opinions from other people without being disturbed. I believe in a world where everything is changing and new topics are being introduced it is essential to be open minded. This allows for new concepts and ideas to be made in order to advance in the world we are living in today. I believe that if you are not open minded it doesn't let ideas to be passed on, it’s like putting a dam in a river. You stop the flow of ideas, not allowing the world to advance in topics such as in equality. However, i believe that in certain situations it is important to know how to stand your ground and know how to defend your position. I believe i do this, it's important, you're not always going to agree with everybody, such as the way everyone is not going to agree with you.\n\nThis openness has helped me build a number of meaningful relationships that have not only brought me great joy but also changed my outlook on life and my future. As such, what matters most to me is challenging the way I think and constantly learning and growing by building relationships with people who inspire me, challenge me, or are otherwise different from me. By contrasting my experiences and values against those of others, I am better able to understand the values I grew up with and have opened my perspective to new ideas. Relationships with three people in particular have changed my perspective, shaped my values, and made me who I am today: an Admissions Officer who taught me about openness, a Professor who taught me leadership and self-confidence, and a student I mentor who taught me what courage and optimism really\n\n“Most of us are brought up with a set of beliefs and values and, throughout our lives, tend to surround ourselves with people who share the same values and beliefs. Therefore, it can be difficult when we 're faced with ideas that challenge our own and, though we may wish to be open-minded, we may struggle with the act of it from time to time.(Positively present)” The problem with being closed minded is they use hostility, prejudice, indifference, and inattention to keep new or different ideas from gaining a foothold. Basically they don’t try to let new ideas or beliefs cross their minds. Also people who are closed minded don’t want to learn or change their opinion on certain beliefs. They like to think they\n\nOpenness to experience refers to people who are 'curious, original, and broad-minded ' (Van Veina, and De Dreu, 2010) as well as people who 'reflects intellectual, cultural, or creative interests ' (Driskell et al., 2006, p.254), people who are very open to experiences tend to be more cooperative and tolerant and flexible, they are able to accept change which can lead to an open atmosphere in teams which may allow team members to feel more confident in putting forward ideas. People who are not open to experiences are less flexible and don 't appreciate change as much, if this trait is common in a team it could lead to more disputes or a very closed minded approach to a task.\n\nTo be healthier in the intellectual dimension I want to be more open minded. The next time we do a class project and work with others I want to be able to accept their idea instead of trying to make it my way. I will listen to the other person’s idea and try to collaborate it with mine. I want to do this because I want to try new ways of doing things and let the other person express their idea. Being open minded will help me be more accepting to new\n\nReading the works of others is eye opening to me as well. Open mindedness is a theory that I adopt first and foremost as I read. When I embark on reading a new book, first and foremost I do not judge the book by its cover. \"You HAVE to read this book,\" my Mom insisted as she set down a novel on my desk. The cover looked bland and wasn't sparking any desire in me to open it. I let that book get buried under piles of junk as I packed my bags for college. As I arrived and unpacked, I found the book crushed under some clothes with the cover peeled back and creased"
