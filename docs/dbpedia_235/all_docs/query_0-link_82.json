        "text": "Is it a felony of lexicographic fecklessness or merely a misdemeanor of misunderstood motives?\n\nWord guardians have been up in arms this week over claims in a new book about the Oxford English Dictionary, which asserts that one of its former editors, Robert Burchfield, surreptitiously expunged hundreds of words with foreign origins.\n\nThese accusations come from the linguist Sarah Ogilvie, herself a former editor at the dictionary, in her book “Words of the World: A Global History of the Oxford English Dictionary,” being released Thursday by Cambridge University Press. Her assertions are particularly notable because Dr. Burchfield, the editor of a four-volume supplement of the dictionary completed in 1986, had cultivated the reputation as someone who was far more inclusive than his predecessors.\n\nDeleting words from the dictionary is considered verboten. “The deletion of entries went against all OED policy before and since: usually, once a word is added to the OED, it remains forever,” she wrote.\n\nThe book’s observations were reported this week in The Guardian, and a first wave of reaction on Twitter showed how fascinated people are with language. But though Dr. Burchfield’s reputation absorbed the brunt of the early criticism, many are now rallying to his defense, including representatives of the OED, as the dictionary is known, and even Dr. Ogilvie. Why Dr. Burchfield dropped certain words remains unknown; he died in 2004.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
