        "text": "Page No 46:\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nWho do you think of, when you hear the word 'genius'? Who is a genius- what qualities do you think a genius has?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI think of Albert Einstein when I hear the word 'genius'.\n\nA genius is a person with exceptional intellectual or creative abilities. I think a genius has a strong drive, devotion and curiosity to gain knowledge. He works patiently and with great concentration. He is imaginative and solves problems with an open mind. He is a versatile person who is not only perfect in his field of work but also devotes energy towards bettering the society.\n\n(A model answer has been provided for students' reference.

Hence, he wanted to study in Switzerland.\n\n(iii) Einstein found in Mileva an ally because she, like him, disapproved of the âphilistinesâ or the people who did not like art, literature or music.\n\nPage No 51:\n\nQuestion 4:\n\nWhat did Einstein call his desk drawer at the patent office? Why?\n\nAnswer:\n\nEinstein called his desk drawer at the patent office the âbureau of theoretical physicsâ. This was because the drawer was where he used to store his secretly developed ideas.\n\nPage No 51:\n\nQuestion 5:\n\nWhy did Einstein write a letter to Franklin Roosevelt?\n\nAnswer:\n\nEinstein wrote a letter to Franklin Roosevelt to warn him of the fatal consequences of an atomic explosion.\n\nPage No 51:\n\nQuestion 6:\n\nHow did Einstein react to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?\n\nAnswer:\n\nEinstein was profoundly disturbed by the magnitude of the destruction caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He even wrote a public letter to the United Nations proposing the formation of a world government. Gradually he became more and more involved in politics, attempting to bring about world peace.\n\nPage No 51:\n\nQuestion 7:\n\nWhy does the world remember Einstein as a âworld citizenâ?\n\nAnswer:\n\nEinstein is remembered as a âworld citizenâ as much as a genius scientist because of his efforts towards world peace and democracy, and for his crusade against the use of arms.\n\nPage No 51:\n\nQuestion 8:\n\nHere are some facts from Einsteinâs life. Arrange them in chronological order.\n\n[ ] Einstein publishes his special theory of relativity.\n\n[ ] He is awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\n[ ] Einstein writes a letter to U.S. President, Franklin D.

An original handwritten Albert Einstein manuscript has been unearthed at a university in the Netherlands. The yellowed 16-page German manuscript was dated December 1924.\n\nRowdy Boeynik, a student in the University of the Netherlands, was researching papers belonging to an old friend of Einstein when he stumbled upon the manuscript. The fingerprints of Einstein have been traced on these research papers.\n\nThe document, titled 'Quantum theory of the monatomic ideal gas', contains Einstein's work on what is now known as the Bose-Einstein condensation. It concerns the behavior of atoms at a low temperature, the last major work of the scientific genius.\n\nThe manuscript will be kept at Leyden University where Einstein got the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921."
