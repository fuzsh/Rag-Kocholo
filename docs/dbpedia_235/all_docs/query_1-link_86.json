If you’ve made up your mind, you’ve come to a decision.\n\nMind can also mean “pay attention to” or “watch.” If someone tells you to “mind your manners,” they want you to be polite. If you tell them to “mind their own business,” maybe they’ll leave you alone. When I ask, “Would you mind if I open a window?” I’m asking if this would bother you.\n\nI am sure you have heard:\n\nRegular announcements in the Delhi Metro: “Please Mind the Gap”,\n\n“Mind your Language” the video episodes we swatch to get some fun from British Humor as it happens in Mr. Brown’s English class\n\nAll I want is some “Peace of Mind”\n\nSome more usages picked from the Media (thanks to http://www.vocabulary.com):\n\nA large part of me realized early on that it was my mind playing tricks.

This is your mood.\n\nMood refers to how you feel at the present time and this keeps changing depending on how moody you are. If you want to ask your boss for a raise, wait until he or she is in a good mood. Don’t ask, though, if he or she is “in a bad mood” – that means the person is irritable or already irritated. If you are in the mood for something like ice cream or spicy food, you would like to have it now. Mood can also describe the attitude of a group of people or the feeling of a film, novel or piece of music.\n\nI am sure you have heard: “What’s your mood today?”; “I was not in a mood to go to the office so made a excuse”; “Let’s get into the mood and try something new.”\n\nSome more usages picked from the Media (thanks to http://www.vocabulary.com).\n\nStudies have linked repeated concussions with a chronic disease with symptoms including memory loss and mood swings. (BBC Oct 26, 2013)\n\nThey are already in militant mood, with strikes planned next week over pay.

I will write about that in another post."
