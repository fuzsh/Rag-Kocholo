Part 5 Broadminded Man

*Khushi... your father is earning well. Why are you stressing yourself in the matter of nothing? Just eat and be relaxed* NK said.

*Nothing...? Idiot... it's everything... our country's future... money value will fall low... we will face inflation...*

NK scratched his head.

*I'm an idiot... talking to an idiot who doesn't know anything...* she said wearily.

*What to do, Khushi? I don't understand what you are talking about. It feels like watching an English movie without Hindi subtitles...*

Khushi rolled her eyes whereas Arnav laughed.

*Why are you laughing? Do you know what I'm talking about? * Khushi questioned him.

Arnav smiled said nothing. She rolled her eyes.

*You must have known about it. After all, you are also running a business...* she said sulking.

Cutting her,

*Really? Are you a businessman? *NK asked excitedly.

Arnav nodded yes.

*Bhai... please take me with you... give me a small work... I will do anything if you assign... I can't survive in this village...please rescue me*

Khushi dropped her jaw.

*What do you know? * Arnav asked.

*He knows nothing... except Ayurveda medicine names* Khushi said.

*I will learn... trust me. Didn't Khushi say, I know the medicines name...? I learned it from his father... within a year. Like the same, I will learn if you give me a chance... please take me with you* he pleaded.

*Why? Don't you like this job? * Arnav asked, looking at Khushi smilingly.

*I'm doing this job because there is no job in our village... I belong to a poor family. I don't have money to start a business... what to do? * he said sadly.

*Lie... he is a lazybones... he can't work hard... that's why he is doing this simple work...* Khushi said.

*I worked in the field. My hand got broken, slipping down in the field... that's why I'm scared of working in the field*

Khushi was about to say something. Arnav stopped her.

*Ok... I will give you a task. If you complete it, I will take you to Delhi with me* Arnav said.

NK's face brightened instantly.

*Really...? Tell me...* he asked energetically.

Arnav gestured to him I WILL TWLL YOU LATER. NK nodded ok.

*Your doctor's daughter eats a lot of chocolates, it seems...* Arnav asked smilingly.

Khushi looked at him with a sarcastic expression.

*No no... those chocolates are for children who come for the treatment here* Nk said.

*Oh...*

*Some Ayurveda medicines taste very bitter. Children cry a lot while eating that. She gives chocolate to crying children...* NK stated.

*I think children would cry intentionally to get chocolates from her* Arnav chuckled.

*Yeah... It happens often*

Arnav and NK laughed.

*She buys chocolates every Saturday when she gets money* NK said.

*Good...* Arnav said.
