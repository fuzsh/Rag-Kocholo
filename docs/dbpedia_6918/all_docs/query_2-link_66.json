        "text": "FOR THIS KILLER, IT’S A GAME OF A B C\n\nCriminal profilers Jan Grall and Rabea Wyler are assigned the gruesome case of a man found murdered in a wildlife park. Later, two more bodies are found, both brutally mutilated, and authorities soon realise that the victims are linked by the letters of the alphabet tattooed on their skin.\n\nThen the killer strikes again and Grall and Wyler receive a mysterious package containing a blood-encrusted scrap of skin marked with a letter. And when Grall’s hotel room is marked with a Z, the race is on to find out who this vicious killer is. Before it’s too late . . .\n\nA tense and exciting serial killer thriller by debut author, Lars Schutz.\n\n——————\n\nReview\n\nThe story starts with a short chapter that really sets the scene for what is to come. It’s dark and chilling, but really makes you want to read on!\n\nThe story follows Jan and Rabea who are on the trail of a killer who is mutilating his victims and branding them with a tattoo. The chapters alternate between these characters and one of the victims. It is an interesting way to tell the story and had me gripped as I wanted to know how each strand played out.\n\nThis book is set in Germany and is a translated book which I enjoyed, as I always feel like I learn something about the country, culture or language. The setting created is claustrophobic and it really adds to the unease experienced in some of the chapters.\n\nFor a debut novel, it is highly accomplished. I really enjoyed the plot and the characters. At times, it was a tad gory, which wasn’t a problem for me but may be for others. I raced through it quickly and will be keeping an eye out for Lars’ next book."
