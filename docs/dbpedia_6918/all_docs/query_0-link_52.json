Now with a beautiful new series look.\n\n“Let us see, Mr. Clever Poirot, just how clever you can be.”\n\nThere’s a serial killer on the loose, working his way through the alphabet and the whole country is in a state of panic.\n\nA is for Mrs. Ascher in Andover, B is for Betty Barnard in Bexhill, C is for Sir Carmichael Clarke in Churston. With each murder, the killer is getting more confident—but leaving a trail of deliberate clues to taunt the proud Hercule Poirot might just prove to be the first, and fatal, mistake.\n\nProduct Details"
