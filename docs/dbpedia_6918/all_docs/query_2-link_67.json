        "text": "Great idea for a thread, I have just made my way through the Peter Ustinov movies finishing a few days ago with Dead Man's Folly. His take is let's say a light hearted version of the Belgium detective.\n\nI have watched all the Suchet episodes and any other adaption I have come across. I am looking forward to John Malkovich in The Abc Murders.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/abc-murders-john-malkovich\n\nMy mother and father were readers of Christie and Doyle amongst other authors in the genre, so I had access to all the books growing up.\n\nI used to be a big fan of Agatha Christie as a child. Then when I got older, say 16-17 I started finding her rather journalistic and mundane. Whodunits are rather silly, if one thinks about it. But fairly recently I read other whodunits from the so called golden age of detective fiction and I understand better why she stands out. Others were really dire. At least she could sometimes write true characters and Hercule Poirot had personality (although he was far more French than Belgium). And some of her books are genuinely scary. And Then There Were None is basically an ancestor of the slasher.\n\nThe 1945 version of And then there were none is one of my favourite films it's very atmospheric, agreed the story is a pre cursor to the Slasher movies.\n\nI tend to be gravitated to the clever Christie story's, some of the surrounding elements to say Poirot for example needs a suspension of disbelief, if I recall correctly Poirot would have been 125 years old in Curtain.\n\nShe wrote it during WWII I think. Given that he's already retired from the police in 1917, Poirot is very old after WWII and way beyond 100 in the stories set in the 60s and 70s.\n\nAnybody else thinks Poirot is far more French than Belgium?\n\nExcept that these stories are not set in the 60s and 70s, that's all. Yes, it takes a bit of retconning, but my best guess would be that Dame Agatha wanted to keep her stories current, and put in topical references from the time she wrote them. But, from a \"Watsonian\" viewpoint, those stories happened in the 20s and 30s.\n\nAnd no, I don't think that poirot is more french than belgian. He simply comes from the frenhc-speaking part of Belgium, that's all.\n\nAs for my ranking of various Poirots I've seen, here it is :\n\n1) David Suchet. Nobody does it better\n\n2) Albert Finney. Close to what Dame Agatha wrote.\n\n3) Peter Ustinov. Not close at all, but entertaining nonetheless.\n\n4) Tony randall. He did for Poirot what Dame Margaret Rutherford did for Miss Marple, and that's not a compliment. Still, Anita Ekberg isn't bad looking.\n\nBTW, speaking of Peter Ustinov (and David Niven) ever heard about Operation : Copperhead ?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Copperhead\n\nIt has even been the subject of a graphic novel in France :\n\nMany of the novels are in fact set at the time they were written.\n\nChristie makes no mention of any particular traits of Belgium culture when it comes to her detective. She was far more familiar with French one and only made Poirot coming from Belgium because of the Belgium refugees in the war.\n\n4) Tony randall. He did for Poirot what Dame Margaret Rutherford did for Miss Marple, and that's not a compliment. Still, Anita Ekberg isn't bad looking.\n\nIs the Tony Randall film a movie you would recommend? Read a little bit about it not long ago.\n\nThat's the sort of spoof one (The Alphabet Murders, based on The ABC Murders novel) as far as I know, so probably not the best place to look for fidelity to Agatha Christie. I saw a bit of it once (it was B/W I seem to recall) and all I can remember was Poirot saying near the start of the film that he was \"the famous Belgian sleuth\", which I quote from in the OP!\n\n4) Tony randall.

I saw a bit of it once (it was B/W I seem to recall) and all I can remember was Poirot saying near the start of the film that he was \"the famous Belgian sleuth\", which I quote from in the OP!\n\nYep, that's the one! Read it had some spy-ish elements to it (don't know if there was much of it, though), and had to check if anyone had opinions about it, as I might buy a copy of it soon. Would definitely buy it for the entertainment factor more than the accuracy of the portrayal of Poirot!\n\nThe sheer quantity of her work is impressive; that said, she often recycles a lot of her plot devices - the trick is that she's usually able to do it without the reader guessing.\n\nHer writing is concise, but it can be a bit of work to read through some of the novels. Many of her solutions were ingenious or imaginative, but thankfully always fair. Unfortunately, her later works were noticeably less impressive.\n\nSome of her works that I most enjoyed, in no particular order:\n\nThe Moving Finger\n\nHercule Poirot's Christmas\n\nAnd Then There Were None\n\nMurder on the Orient Express\n\nThe Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side\n\nEndless Night\n\nDeath on the Nile\n\nCards on the Table\n\nThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd\n\nThe Body in the Library\n\nDeath in the Clouds\n\nMurder in Mesopotamia\n\nEven her lesser works, which came about during her later years, still had an occasional clever ploy. E.g. Dead Man's Folly, where even\n\ntitle is a clue\n\n.\n\nI've seen a few of the Suchet adaptations. Rarely have I been impressed. The adaptation for The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is outright sacrilege, replacing Christie's famous twist ending with a frustratingly pointless gun battle. Yawn.\n\nAfter Poirot, what is your favourite portrayal of Miss Marple on the screen ? My ranking order :\n\n1) Joan Hickson. On TV, she's the one I'm most familiar with (haven't seen much of Geraldine McEwan or Julia McKenzie to form an opinion, unfortunately). So It's Joan for me, all the way. And I love the main theme.\n\n2) Angela Lansbury. The Mirror Crack'd was a good adaptation, which I saw before reading the novel. I was not the only one, because in the teater, the revelation of the motive behind the murder elicited a big \"Oh My God !\" from a member of the audience).\n\n3) Dame Margaret Rutherford. Now, don't get me wrong, Dame Margaret was a fantastic comic actress. But Miss Marple she wasn't, sorry. Still, her movies are really funny. And the main theme is quite catchy (Ron Goodwin at his finest) :\n\nI can't stand Miss Marple. Utterly unbelievable.\n\nTo be honest Agatha Christie was not a very good writer: her characters are often stereotypical, her prose pretty journalistic and the plots contrived. But her flaws were the ones of her fellow writers and she was better than most of them. And she had a few moments of greatness : ATTWN, Crooked House (maybe her best?), although then she's great not as a crime fiction writer but because the stories go into proto slasher or family dramas."
