        "text": "The ABC Murders (Poirot)\n\nA facsimile first edition hardback of one of the very best Poirot books, published to mark the 80th anniversary of his first appearance.\n\nThere’s a serial killer on the loose, bent on working his way through the alphabet. And as a macabre calling card he leaves beside each victim’s corpe the ABC Railway Guide open at the name of the town where the murder has taken place.\n\nHaving begun with Andover, Bexhill and then Churston, there seems little chance of the murderer being caught – until he makes the crucial and vain mistake of challenging Hercule Poirot to frustrate his plans…\n\nTo mark the 80th anniversary of Hercule Poirot's first appearance and to celebrate his renewed fortunes as a primetime television star, this launch title in a collection of facsimile first editions is the perfect way to experience Agatha Christie. Reproducing the original typesetting and format of the first edition from the Christie family's own archive, this book sports the original cover which has been painstakingly restored to its original glory.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAgatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became, quite simply, the bestselling novelist in history. Her first novel, the Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in 100 foreign languages. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.\n\nReview\n\n“There is no more cunning player of the murder game than Agatha Christie” --Sunday Times\n\n“A masterwork of carefully concealed artifice… most stunningly original” --Julian Symons"
