        "text": "The ABC Murders: John Malkovich stars as Poirot in new drama\n\nThe ABC Murders, which finishes tonight (Friday, December 28) at 9pm on BBC One, was based on the 1936 novel of the same name by Agatha Christie. The BBC series, however, has some big difference from the book, with whole characters removed and the events set further back in time. Agatha Christie fans should have noticed the following differences between the book and the BBC series:\n\nHow is The ABC Murders TV series different to the book?\n\nIn terms of basic plot, the TV series and the book are the same.\n\nBoth see Hercule Poirot (played by John Malkovich) try to find the identity of ABC, a serial killer who is working his way through the alphabet, killing members of the public like Alice Ascher (Tamzin Griffin) in Andover, Betty Barnard (Eve Austin) in Bexhill and Sir Carmichael Clarke (Christopher Villers) in Churston.\n\nOne major difference between the series and the book is the former does not feature Poirot’s faithful companion Arthur Hastings.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, The ABC Murders screenwriter Sarah Phelps said: “The first thing I did was say ‘I’m getting rid of Hastings, he gets on my nerves'.\n\nHOW MANY EPISODES ARE IN THE ABC MURDERS?\n\n“I wanted Hercule to be friendless, I didn’t want him to have any friends.\n\n“In the book he’s got loads of friends - endless useless coppers pop up being useless; the supercilious Crone who just says silly things; and Hastings who just explains what Poirot is or isn’t doing.”\n\nAs well as getting rid of Hastings entirely, Phelps gives Crone more of an antagonistic role in the first episode of The ABC Murders.\n\nShe also got rid of the idea of the Legion, a group of relatives of the victims who band together to help Poirot.\n\nWHERE IS THE ABC MURDERS FILMED?\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nAlthough the members of the Legion like Franklin Clarke (Andrew Buchan) and Megan Barnard (Bronwyn James) remain in the series, they are isolated from each other.\n\nAs well as cutting some characters, Phelps also expanded the roles of others.\n\nLily Marbury (Anya Chalotra), for example, in the book is a thinly-sketched daughter of Cust’s landlady (Shirley Henderson).\n\nHowever, in the TV series, she is employed to step on Cust’s (Eamon Farren) back with a broken high heel - a development Agatha Christie would not have got away with when she was writing in 1936.\n\nWHERE IS THE ABC MURDERS SET?\n\nPhelps also decided to set her version of The ABC Murders in 1933 rather than the book’s 1936 in order to put the rise of the British Union of Fascists in the background of her version.\n\nShe told Express.co.uk this was so the story would mirror contemporary life, saying: “I decided to set it very specifically in 1933 because that's when the British Union of Fascists really started to gain serious traction.\n\n“The language they use is absolutely no different from the language of Brexit and Trump.”\n\nABC Murders fans who are wondering whether the identity of the killer has been changed from the book, however, will have to tune in tonight to find out.\n\nThe ABC Murders concludes tonight at 9pm on BBC One"
