They are Mr. Charles Lawton and Miss Elsa Lanchester. Mr. Lawton, who will soon be seen in the Metro Goldwyn Mayer picture \"The Man From Down Under\", is here to play a remarkable character, created by England's noted thriller author, Agatha Christie. A mild-mannered character whose initials were ABC and about whom revolved a series of savage murders all neatly and alphabetically arranged. ABC was stamped upon all his belongings, those being his rightful initials. And ABC was stamped too, upon the large railway timetable he always carried. But there was nothing so odd about that detail since no traveler in the British Isles would dream of planning a journey without consulting this famous railway schedule, the ABC. And so with the ABC Murders by Agatha Christie, written for radio by Robert Tallman and William Spear and with the performance of Charles Lawton we again hope to keep you in...\n\nFX:\n\nMUSIC\n\nMIB:\n\nSuspense!\n\nFX:\n\nRinging Bell – Music under announcer\n\nMIB:\n\nWhen the time for closing bell rang in the Public Library, Alexander Bonepart Cust started, picked up his battered briefcase with the almost faded initials ABC, closed the book he had been reading\n\nFX:\n\nFOOT STEPS TO DESK\n\nANN:\n\nand shuffled over to the librarian's desk.\n\nABC:\n\nUm, It's a most interesting book, Librarian. I should like to come back sometime and read another chapter of it if I may.\n\nLIB:\n\nQuite. Yes, Mr. Clark. Can I help you sir?\n\nCLARK:\n\nNo Hurry.\n\nABC:\n\nWell, I'll be going along now. Thank you.\n\nFX:\n\nFOOT STEPS AWAY\n\nLIB:\n\nRum little chap that. What do you think he was reading. \"Studies in Epileptic Somnambulism\".\n\nCLARK:\n\nMedical stuff, eh? Oh, I say, the little fellow left his briefcase. I'll catch him at the door.\n\nFX:\n\nSTEPS HURRYING AWAY\n\nCLARK:\n\nI say sir. Just a moment. You left something.\n\nABC:\n\nOh dear, it's my briefcase. I'm terribly sorry. I seem to be getting more and more forgetful lately. Tsk, Tsk. Why the other day I left it on the counter in a tobacco shop.\n\nCLARK:\n\nLucky you have those initials. Not many people with the initials ABC. Sticks in your mind.\n\nABC:\n\nWhat do you mean by that sir?\n\nCLARK:\n\nWell after all they are the first three letters of the alphabet. Practically the first thing we learn, you know. Isn't it? Our ABC's.\n\nABC:\n\nDon't mention those letters to me. They've brought bad luck to me in more ways than one.\n\nCLARK:\n\nReally, how's that?\n\nABC:\n\nWell, I used to be a traveling salesman and I used to carry one of those railway timetables in my pocket, the kind in which they list the towns and all the railroads alphabetically.\n\nCLARK:\n\nOh, Of course. Printed right on the cover, isn't it? ABC\n\nABC:\n\nYes, that's right. Well, stockings was my line sir. I did door to door selling. Whenever I finished one town out would come that timetable and I would look up the next stop on my route. I got sick of the sight of it, ABC Railway Guide. I can tell you, sir. It was like a symbol of failure to me. One dingy little town after another and all listed in that railway guide with ABC printed on the cover. My own initials staring out at me from every newsstand and every dirty little railroad station in the midlands.\n\nCLARK:\n\nOh, Come on. It couldn't have been as bad as all that.\n\nABC:\n\nMatter of fact, I never noticed it 'til I began to get the headaches.\n\nCLARK:\n\nOh, you suffer from headaches?\n\nABC:\n\nYes.\n\nCLARK:\n\nHum. Have you seen a doctor about it?\n\nABC:\n\nOh, no, no. I wouldn't want to see a doctor about it. I already know what brings them on.\n\nCLARK:\n\nReally, If you'd rather not talk about it.\n\nABC:\n\nOh, no, no. It isn't that at all sir. I was just such a long time ago. During the last war in fact. Chateau Thiere.\n\nCLARK:\n\nChateau Thiere. Oh, I see. What a coincidence. I was in the thick of that myself.\n\nABC:\n\nWere you, sir?\n\nCLARK:\n\nYes, we must get together for a drink one day. Talk over old times. Franklin Clark is my name.\n\nABC:\n\nOh, I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Clark. My name's Cust. Alexander Bonepart Cust.\n\nCLARK:\n\nOh, they must have expected great things of you giving you a name like that.\n\nABC:\n\nI'm afraid they did, Mr. Clark, yes.\n\nFX:\n\nMUSIC UNDER\n\nABC:\n\nOh, I'm very much afraid they did.\n\nFX:\n\nMUSIC UP\n\nFX:\n\nDOOR KNOCKING\n\nMISS:\n\nMr. Cust?\n\nFX:\n\nKNOCKING:\n\nMISS:\n\nOh, Mr. Cust.\n\nABC:\n\nWho is It?\n\nMISS:\n\nIt's me, Mr. Cust.

You're her favorite lodger. In fact... why, Mr. Cust. You're packing your things. You're not leaving us, are you?\n\nABC:\n\nOh, no. I'm just taking a little trip. Over the bank holiday you know.\n\nMISS:\n\nNow, now. Don't try to deceive me, Mr. Cust. You're embarrassed. About owing us, aren't you.\n\nABC:\n\nNo.\n\nMISS:\n\nYou needn't be, Mr. Cust. Really, you needn't be.\n\nABC:\n\nYou are a nice girl, Miss Marbury. You really are a nice girl. As a matter of fact, I'm not going just on the bank holiday, I've something rather important. Some very important matters to take care of.\n\nMISS:\n\nOH, hum.\n\nABC:\n\nYou know it's very possible that my mother didn't have me christened Alexander Bonepart Cust for nothing.\n\nMISS:\n\nOh, have you got a position, Mr. Cust?\n\nABC:\n\nWell,\n\nMISS:\n\nWhat is it?\n\nABC:\n\nWell.\n\nMISS:\n\nCome, Mr. Cust , you can tell me, can't you?\n\nABC:\n\nWell, Miss Lilly, I can tell you this much. I shall be traveling quite a lot.\n\nMISS:\n\nOh\n\nABC:\n\nIn fact. Where did I leave that ABC railroad guide? Oh yes, here it is. First stop, Andover.\n\nMISS:\n\nAndover? That's not very far.\n\nABC:\n\nNo, no, no, but I must be getting on if I don't want to miss that train.\n\nFX:\n\nLOCKS CLOSE ON SUITCASE\n\nABC:\n\nNow let me see. Have I got everything? There's me spectacles, and me overcoat and me typewriter. Me walking stick. Did I ever tell you the history of this walking stick, Miss Marbury?\n\nMISS:\n\nNo.\n\nABC:\n\nIt's a Scottish piece. Very old.\n\nMISS:\n\nAh.\n\nABC:\n\nIt's so old, it's antique. You know they used to kill people with these back in the days of the old clan wars in Scotland. Oh, I wonder how many heads this one has bashed in. Oooooh.\n\nMISS:\n\n(Giggle) Mr. Cust. Oh please, what a terrible way to talk.\n\nABC:\n\nYes, I'm sorry Miss Marbury. I am a little bit surprised at myself talking like that. It must be my new job. It's gone to my head a bit. That's it. It's gone to me head.\n\nFX:\n\nMUSIC UNDER\n\nABC:\n\nHave you got an aspirin, by any chance? I've got an awful ...\n\nFX:\n\nMUSIC UP\n\nFX:\n\nDOOR OPEN, FOOT STEPS\n\nASHER:\n\nYes, gentlemen.

We have reason to believe that there may be a homicidal maniac at large in Andover.\n\nASHER:\n\nGor blimey.\n\nINSP:\n\nWe don't want to frighten you Mrs. Asher. For all we know this may be just a practical joke. You see, we received an anonymous letter. Typewritten and signed ABC.\n\nASHER:\n\nABC?\n\nINSP:\n\nThis murderer, if there is anything in his story, is planning a series of murders. His mania seems to be centered on the alphabet. If he follows his plan through, his first murder will be committed in Andover and the victim will be a person whose name begins with an A.\n\nASHER:\n\nThe Lord help me sir. You don't think...\n\nMAC:\n\nWe don't think anything. Scotland Yard has taken its precautions.\n\nASHER:\n\nOh, A woman takes a terrible chance.\n\nINSP:\n\nThere's probably nothing to be alarmed about, but it won't hurt to keep a sharp look out.

We'll have a bottle of Roma Wine serve as Aladdan's lamp. I press the label and presto! We're all transported to that capital of gaity, Havana, Cuba. And now we find ourselves in the charming Pan-American Club. At a table nearby, an American has just voiced his delight at the uncommon beauty of the sea. Then his Cuban companion, \"You in America also has much that which is uncommon to both shores, such as this marvelous tasting wine we are enjoying thisminute. To enjoy uncommon fine quality, Cuba imports this wine from your own distant California. It is your superb Roma Wine.\"\n\nNow just realize what it means when other countries import Roma wines from great distances. Such international esteem must mean that Roma Wines are truly magnificent in quality. Then consider this. You, here in America, need pay no high import duty nor expensive shipping charges for these fine Roma wines come from Roma's own winerie, in the heart of the rich California wine grape district. Because so many Americans do realize this good fortune, Roma Wines are America's largest selling wines.\n\nSo why deny yourself this taste delight. Try an inexpensive bottle of tangy appetizing Roma Sherry or the hearty Roma Burgundy. Or any of the marvelously enjoyable Roma Wines. But remember, these days your dealer may be temporily out of the type you prefer. Then please try again. Ask for R-0-M-A, Roma Wines, made in California, for enjoyment throughout the world.\n\nFX:\n\nMUSIC UP – TRAVELING MUSIC\n\nNEWS:\n\nLatest! Waitress brutally murdered in Bexel. ABC Strikes again.

Had quite a talk.\n\nABC:\n\nYes.\n\nCLARK:\n\nFranklin Clark, remember.\n\nABC:\n\nYes, of course. You'll forgive me Mr. Clark. My memory. It seems to be getting worse and worse.\n\nCLARK:\n\nYou must have come under better times, Mr. Cust. New briefcase I see. Nice bright new initials.\n\nABC:\n\nWell, I got a job shortly after I saw you Mr. Clark, from Ballinger, Ltd., stockings my old line, you know. But to tell you the truth, I haven't been doing very well.\n\nCLARK:\n\nOh. Those headaches again?\n\nABC:\n\nYes, the headaches. And the murders. The murders have upset me something terrible.\n\nCLARK:\n\nOh, why you're shaking like a leaf, man.\n\nABC:\n\nOh.:\n\nCLARK:\n\nHey, Jonathan. A brandy for Mr. Cust. He needs it.\n\nABC:\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nCLARK:\n\nThe trouble with you, Cust, is you're inclined to be morbid. I remember that book you were reading the day we met. Stuff about epilepsy.\n\nABC:\n\nWell, it might be epilepsy, mightn't it?\n\nCLARK:\n\nWhat?\n\nABC:\n\nWell, they discharged me from the army before the war ended. You see, I had kind of a fit, you know.\n\nCLARK:\n\nNever had anything like it again, have you?\n\nABC:\n\nNo, I didn't have a fit again. Just the headaches. I forget what happens, hours at a time. Do you know once I was sitting in a station waiting room and a newsboy came by and I bought a paper from him and it was all about that first murder in Andover. It said the police had got another note. Another typewritten note, Mr. Clark, and the murderer was going to strike next in Bexel and suddenly I realized I was in Bexel.\n\nCLARK:\n\nHum.\n\nABC:\n\nAnd I'd been in Andover the day before when the first murder happened.\n\nCLARK:\n\nWell, how did you happen to go from Andover from Bexel?\n\nABC:\n\nWell, that's the way I'm supposed to go on my route. Selling the stockings. I'm supposed to take the towns alphabetically.\n\nCLARK:\n\nOh, well, then. It's not so surprising you should have been in Bexel after all, is it? Just a coincidence.\n\nABC:\n\nWell, the waitress in Bexel then I walked home with her that night, Mr. Clark. The night she was murdered.\n\nCLARK:\n\nWell good heavens, Cust. You don't think you killed Mary Barnard, do you?\n\nABC:\n\nI don't know, Mr. Clark. It said in that book that people who have had epileptic fits often do things and don't remember them. They even commit crimes. I said goodnight to her and after that I don't know what happened.\n\nCLARK:\n\nThe notes, those typewritten notes. Wouldn't you have remembered if you had written them?\n\nABC:\n\nI don't know.\n\nCLARK:\n\nWell, I know a little something about psychology myself, Cust. And I'd stake everything I owned on the fact that the man who wrote those notes, was conscious of what he was doing.\n\nABC:\n\nDo you really think so, Mr. Clark?\n\nCLARK:\n\nPositive of it. Now pull yourself together, man. Incidentally, my sister in law lives here in Chester. My brother is Lord Cameron Clark.\n\nABC:\n\nOh.\n\nCLARK :\n\nand I happen to know she needs some new stockings.\n\nABC:\n\nOh.\n\nCLARK:\n\nPop over there in the morning, will you, and show the old girl your line?\n\nABC:\n\nHuh.\n\nCLARK:\n\nHere, here's the address.

My poor Cameron. He never made an enemy in his life.\n\nCLARK:\n\nThe man who did this was a maniac, and I'm afraid I know who he is. He always carried a walking stick with a heavy carved handle. That's how the other murders where committed, with a heavy stick. But he wasn't carrying his stick today. Must have grabbed a knife up there somewhere to kill Cameron with. But when. Were you with him every minute?\n\nLADY:\n\nWell, I went upstairs to get my checkbook. It took me a little while to find it.\n\nCLARK:\n\nThat gave Cust his opening.\n\nLADY:\n\nOh, to think that all that time. Oh, no. I'll never forgive myself, Franklin.\n\nCLARK:\n\nNo, no, none of that now Louise. The important thing now is to stop him before he can commit another murder.\n\nLADY:\n\nBut what are you going to do, Franklin?\n\nCLARK:\n\nI'm going to the police and see if they'll let me help.

Oh, dear, you do look a fright.\n\nABC:\n\nYes.\n\nMISS:\n\nLook, I'm going to go straight and get you a hot foot bath.\n\nABC:\n\nNo, no. not now. please. Not now. Miss Lilly, there's no time for it.\n\nMISS:\n\nWhat is it, Mr. Cust?\n\nFX:\n\nDOOR OPEN\n\nABC:\n\nClose the door and lock it.\n\nFX:\n\nCLOSE DOOR, LOCK TURN\n\nMISS:\n\nAre you in some trouble, Mr. Cust?\n\nABC:\n\nI'm in terrible trouble, Miss Lilly. I want you to hear the story first from me. You're the only one who has been my friend. Oh, I've had a lonely life, Miss Lilly.\n\nMISS:\n\nOh, poor Mr. Cust.\n\nABC:\n\nPoor Mr. Cust. That's what they always say about me. Poor Mr. Cust. I thought you were different.\n\nMISS:\n\nNow, don't take on so Mr. Cust. It was only a manner of speaking.\n\nABC:\n\nOh, you don't need to worry. I'm alright now. I never get two spells in one day.\n\nMISS:\n\nSpells. Mr. Cust, I don't understand. What do you mean?\n\nABC:\n\nYou've heard of the ABC murders.\n\nMISS:\n\nOh, Shocking affairs. But Mr. Cust, why are you saying?\n\nABC:\n\nMiss Lilly, the police will be here at any minute. Please let me finish. I don't want you to think harshly of me, Miss Lilly. I didn't plan it ahead. My instructions told me where to go. Some people can't help what they do. There are diseases, epilepsy for instance. You do things you don't remember. You commit crimes. And I'm like that.\n\nMISS:\n\nOh, Mr. Cust, I can't believe it.\n\nABC:\n\nWhen I was a child, Miss Lilly, they used to badger me about my name. My mother worshipped strength. She named me after the strongest people she knew about in history. Alexander and Bonepart. But nobody ever called me by those names. They called me ABC. \"ABC\". I used to dream I was boiling in a kettle of alphabet soup. I was a terrible disappointment to my mother.\n\nMISS:\n\nMr. Cust. You're unsettled and tired.\n\nABC:\n\nYou've got to hear me out, Miss Lilly.\n\nMISS:\n\nOh, ouch, My arm, you're hurting me.\n\nABC:\n\nNow listen to me Miss Lilly, I could have been a hero once in the army in the last war. I was happy. I could have made something of myself. Then I started getting the headaches.\n\nMISS:\n\nLet me go, Mr. Cust!\n\nABC:\n\nYou must hear me out Miss Lilly. I started forgetting things after they discharged me from the army. Shock they called it. I used to have dreams.\n\nMISS:\n\nOhhhh.\n\nABC:\n\nI was a great ruler. The destiny of men was in my hands. I had the power over them of life and death\n\nMISS:\n\nLet me go. Please let me go.\n\nABC:\n\nFirst there was Andover. That tobacconist. I can't ever remember what she looked like. Then there was Bexel. I walked home with the waitress from the station restaurant. She was murdered too. In Churston I sold a dozen pairs of stockings to a lady and while she was upstairs getting her checkbook her husband was murdered on the floor where I was waiting. And now I've come back here. Maybe the alphabet charm is over or is it? This is London, L. Your name is Lilly.\n\nMISS:\n\nAre you trying to frighten me, Mr. Cust?\n\nABC:\n\nI am trying to convince you.\n\nMISS:\n\nYou, a murderer? Ha Ha, ha. I can't believe it. You never...\n\nABC:\n\nWhat about this? Look at it.\n\nMISS:\n\nOh, no, no.\n\nABC:\n\nLook closely at it. I found it in my briefcase when I came on the train, Miss Lilly. This knife murdered a man in Churston, just three hours ago.\n\nMISS:\n\nNO, no. no! (SCREAM)\n\nFX:\n\nMUSIC UP\n\nINSP:\n\nNow, there, there, Miss Marbury, don't take on so.\n\nMISS:\n\nCRYING\n\nINSP:\n\nHe's all locked up pretty as you please in the next room.\n\nMISS:\n\nBut he was such a nice man. I still can't hardly believe it.\n\nMAC:\n\nIs the knife he threatened you with Miss Marbury?\n\nMISS:\n\nYes\n\nCLARK:\n\nWe just got here in the nick of time, eh, (INSPECTOR) Hey, that's a wicked looking knife.\n\nMAC:\n\nIt's the Churston murder knife, right enough, Mr. Clark. No doubt of it.\n\nINSP:\n\nWell, let's take inventory. Typewriter.\n\nMAC:\n\nChecks with the murder notes.\n\nINSP:\n\nWalking stick.\n\nMAC:\n\nSame markings as on the heads of the first victims.\n\nINSP:\n\nAnd the psychiatrists report says the murders were premeditated and the notes could not possibly have been written except by a person who was conscious and in his right mind.\n\nCLARK:\n\nWell, that breaks down any idea of Cust may have had of entering an insanity plea.\n\nINSP:\n\nRight, I think he sign the confession without any difficulty. Bring him in.\n\nFX:\n\nFOOTSTEPS\n\nMAC (off):\n\nBring the prisoner in.\n\nINSP:\n\nWell, Cust, are you ready to sign your confession?\n\nABC:\n\nI don't know, Inspector. A moment ago I was certain I must have done it. But why? That's what worries me. Why? Mr. Clark, why do you think I did it?\n\nCLARK:\n\nYour wasting valuable time Cust. I don't care why you did it. You killed my brother, and I want to see you hang for it. I don't care how balmy you are.\n\nMISS:\n\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself. Talking to our Mr. Cust in that bloodthirsty manner. I don't know what's getting into the gentry, I'm sure.\n\nCLARK:\n\nHe tried to murder you, didn't he?\n\nMISS:\n\nWell, he couldn't help himself. Poor thing. He's been terribly upset of late.\n\nABC:\n\nYou are a nice girl, Miss Lilly. You are a nice girl, really.\n\nCLARK:\n\nThe murders were willfull and premeditated.\n\nABC:\n\nThey couldn't have been premeditated, Mr. Clark.\n\nCLARK:\n\nWhy do you say that, Cust?\n\nABC:\n\nWell, because I didn't go to any of those places of my own choice. I had my instructions from Ballinger's Limited. And those instructions were sent to me after the police got the warnings of the murders that were printed in the papers.\n\nCLARK:\n\nThere were never any such instructions. We ransacked all your things, Cust. There wasn't any letter of instructions, was there, Inspector?\n\nINSP:\n\nNo.\n\nABC:\n\nOh, yes, there was.\n\nINSP:\n\nAll right, we'll ring up Ballinger's. May I use your telephone, Miss Marbury?\n\nMISS:\n\nWhy, certainly, Inspector.\n\nABC:\n\nThe number is Regent 3313, Inspector.\n\nFX:\n\nPHONE DIALING\n\nINSP: Ballinger's, are you there? Put me on to personnel.\n\nOh, Mac. Start packing those exhibits will you.\n\nMAC: All right, Sir.\n\nINSP:\n\nCrome speaking, Scotland Yard. At what day did you employ a commercial traveller named Alexander Bonepart Cust? No, Cust. A. B. Cust. Initials ABC. Yes, yes. Never employed by you. You are absolutely certain? Did you send a man to Andover or Bexel last week? Not on your Route. Thank you. That's all I wanted to know.\n\nCLARK:\n\nToo bad, Cust. I guess this knocks out your last ghost of a chance, doesn't it?\n\nABC:\n\nNo, Mr. Clark, because you see the instructions were in a letter and that letter is right in this room.\n\nCLARK:\n\nWell, let's have a look. Come on, MacKenzie, give me a hand. Let's go through these things again.\n\nABC:\n\nIt won't do you any good to look there, Mr. Clark. I have the letter. Would you like to see it, Mr. Crome? It's here.\n\nINSP:\n\nWell, I'll be. Where did you get that?\n\nMAC:\n\nIt wasn't on him, Inspector. I'll swear to that. Where did you have this hidden?\n\nABC:\n\nWell, Inspector, it isn't generally known but I do wear a small hairpiece. Not out of vanity, mind you. I find it necessary for the business end.\n\nINSP:\n\nLet's see that letter.\n\nABC:\n\nOh, gladly.\n\nINSP:\n\nDear Mr. Cust. Enclosed find advance, typewriter is being posted today. You will ...\n\nCLARK:\n\nWhat a lot of nonsence, Inspector. Look at the typeface of that letter. It's obviously written on Cust's typewriter.\n\nABC:\n\nYes, that's right, Mr. Clark. And the man who wrote that letter was the murderer. Cool as you like, he sent the typewriter to me, and instructions on one of Ballinger's letterheads and the money and everything else.\n\nCLARK:\n\nWhat kind of stunt are you trying to pull here, Cust?\n\nABC:\n\nNo stunt. It's just that when you made that telephone call, Inspector, and Ballinger said I'd never worked for them. I knew that the typewriter must have been sent to my by the murderer. And the more I thought about it the more it seemed to me that the murderer must be... Mr. Clark.\n\nCLARK:\n\nWhat! This is too utterly fantastic, Inspector, really, I...I...\n\nABC:\n\nWell, the murderer would have had to know something about me. Something I'd never confided to anyone but to Mr. Clark about my, well, about my headaches. I'd been reading a book in the public library, Inspector, a book on epilepsy, and it seemed to me that what I suffered during the last war might have been epilepsy, and It was on my mind, see, and It said that epileptics might commit crimes and not remember them under certain conditions. Without that to go on, the murderer couldn't possibly have pinned the crime on me.\n\nCLARK:\n\nThat works two ways, Cust. You might have told me that story deliberately. Just so you could cook up this story, now.\n\nABC:\n\nWell, I couldn't cook up your fingerprints, Mr. Clark. And I'll wager anything your fingerprints are on that letter.\n\nCLARK:\n\nOh, come now, really.\n\nINSP:\n\nWell, that's easily settled. We can do it right here. Won't take a moment. Take a set of Mr. Clark's fingerprints, McKenzie. You examine the prints on the letter meantime.\n\nMAC:\n\nAll right inspector. Just press your fingers down firmly on this ink pad, Mr. Clark.\n\nCLARK:\n\n(Sigh)\n\nMAC:\n\nWhat is it, Mr. Clark? It's quite simple, really.\n\nCLARK:\n\nYes, yes. It's so simple it isn't even necessary.\n\nINSP:\n\nI'm afraid this is necessary, Mr. Clark. Only a matter of routine, you know.\n\nCLARK:\n\nI tell you it isn't necessary because Cust is right. I am the murderer.\n\nINSP:\n\nYou? But wait, you killed your brother Cameron Clark so that you would inherit the estate.\n\nCLARK:\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nINSP:\n\nBut the others, the A and B murders in Andover and Bexel and...\n\nCLARK:\n\nI committed them, all of them.\n\nINSP:\n\nYes, but...\n\nCLARK:\n\nCome now, Gentlemen, surely you give me credit for thinking this thing through. If only my brother, Lord Clark had been murdered, I being the only heir, would have a lot of explaining to do. So I invented my own little crime wave to make it appear as though he were just one of the victims of a homicidal maniac. And I must say, it almost came off, thanks to the unknowing cooperation of Mr. Cust here. Thank you just the same, Mr. Cust.\n\nABC:\n\nYou're very welcome.\n\nMISS:\n\nHa, ha. Oh, Mr. Cust, I knew you couldn't be a murderer. Not really.\n\nABC:\n\nOh, you are a nice girl, Miss Lilly, really, you are a nice girl.\n\nMISS:\n\nAbout those headaches, Mr. Cust. Why don't you go to an occulist? Those headaches. Maybe you just need a new pair of glasses.\n\nABC:\n\nI think I'll do that, Miss Lilly. Do you really think? Of course, I'll wager that's what been the trouble with me all along. Glasses.\n\nMISS:\n\nYou know you need someone to take care of you.\n\nABC:\n\nOh, I do, Miss Lilly. I do, really. If only you... Oh, but no, you couldn't ever think of...\n\nMISS:\n\nWhat, Mr. Cust?\n\nABC:\n\nWell, I mean, Miss Lilly. I was just thinking it would be really too much to ask anyone. Mrs. Alexander Bonepart Cust.\n\nMISS:\n\nBut when we are married, please don't wear that toupee. It's very conspicuous.\n\nABC:\n\nOh, you are a nice girl, Miss Lilly, really you are. I do hope people won't call you Mrs. ABC.\n\nFX:\n\nMUSIC UP\n\nMIB:\n\nAnd so closes the ABC murders starring Charles Lawton, Miss Elsa Lanchester, and Bramwell Fletcher.
