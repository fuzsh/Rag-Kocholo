        "text": "The Hunt For A Missing Child\n\nCarmen Colon lived with her grandparents in Rochester. The 10-year-old was from Puerto Rico and spoke little English.\n\nShe often ran errands around the neighborhood for her grandfather, Felix Colon, who sometimes came with her.\n\nBut, on November 16th, 1971, she insisted that she go to the pharmacy on her own to pick up Felix’s prescription.\n\nAs she waited for the pharmacist to fill the prescription, she wandered out of the drugstore and never returned.\n\nWitnesses spotted her an hour later, around 12 miles from her home. The child was naked as she waved her arms and ran away from a vehicle backing up on the shoulder of the road.\n\nNobody stopped.\n\nThe onlookers told police that the vehicle was moving too fast for them to do anything or that they were rushing to get home.\n\nA few days later, two teenage boys on bicycles passed a ditch. They thought they spotted a broken doll, but as they got closer, they realized it was a girl.\n\nCarmen."
