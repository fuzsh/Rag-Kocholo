        "text": "Frank Tashlin, whose 1965 comedy “The Alphabet Murders” I discuss in this clip, started out directing Looney Tunes cartoons for Warner Bros. (He specialized in Porky Pig). He went on to make cartoonish comedies with Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, and he was the primordial pop-culture vulture. (In “Artists and Models,” from 1955, he even had Lewis play a comic-book fan with fantasies about a character called Vincent the Vulture.) At the same time that the young critics of the French New Wave were consuming Hollywood movies in record quantity and preparing to make films that reflected their consuming passion, Tashlin was making movies that looked at movie fandom (“Hollywood or Bust”), rock and roll (“The Girl Can’t Help It”), and advertising and television (“Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?”). He depicted a world in which the commercial image was an inseparable part of modern reality and sometimes seemed even more real than reality. Tashlin was not a critic, but he knew where the genius lay: with Alfred Hitchcock, who managed to turn his elaborate visions into pop icons. In “The Disorderly Orderly,” starring Lewis, Tashlin alluded to Hitchcockian images and themes. In “The Alphabet Murders,” he raised the ante: he employed the full panoply of his own cartoon-fuelled imagination and got into the ring with the master. Of course, in 1965, Hitchcock’s own best days were behind him—he may not have known how to film the subject of the day, that of his own influence."
