        "text": "Frank Tashlin’s mystery thriller in which Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot examines a number of killings done in alphabetical order. Starring Tony Randall, Anita Ekberg and Robert Morley.\n\nAdapted from the novel The A.B.C. Murders by Agatha Christie, which was published 29 years earlier, the story concerns Hercule Poirot (Tony Randall) who investigates a sequence of homicides in London in which the victims are murdered rendering to their initials.\n\nTony Randall gives an okay performance in his role as the Belgian detective who doesn’t show a great deal of determination in terms of trying to find out who is accountable for causing all the trouble in the English capital, while Robert Morley is Captain Hastings, Hercule’s sidekick involved not offering much assistance.\n\nElsewhere, Anita Ekberg as Amanda, Maurice Denham as Inspector Japp, Guy Rolfe as Duncan Doncaster, and Shelia Allen as Lady Diane don’t offer much in their respective parts and it isn’t the only problems the movie has.\n\nThe direction from Tashlin is okay but it should have been better, such as showing more facial expressions to a stronger effect, while also having more of a tense atmosphere happening as well – this doesn’t occur much.\n\nThe script is written to an okay standard by David Pursall and Jack Seddon as it is weak in places and there are scenes that did not need to be in the final edit, so the duration didn’t need to be as long as it was, and the pace is slow.\n\nEven though this movie runs for only 86 minutes, it could easily have been made as a short film.\n\nOverall, The Alphabet Murders is a disappointing adaptation of the novel, due to the okay performances, direction, weak script, slow pace and lack of tense atmosphere and character determination."
