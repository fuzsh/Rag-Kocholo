Widely regarded as one of Agatha Christie’s best mysteries, The ABC Murders is one of the most surprising and unusual appearances by literature’s most famous detective.\n\nThe year is 1933 and a killer stalks Britain, known only as A.B.C. They strike in a methodical pattern and leave a copy of the ABC railway guide at the scene of each of murder. As Poirot (John Malkovich) attempts to investigate he is thwarted on every front; by a police force that no longer trusts him, a public that no longer adores him, and an enemy determined to outsmart him. If Poirot is to match his most cunning nemesis everything about him will be called into question; his authority, his integrity, his past, his identity.\n\nInternational Sales\n\nInternational rights to The ABC Murders are being handled by Endeavor Content and have been sold in the following territories: Australia: ABC; Africa: BBC Studios; Benelux: BBC Studios; Brazil: Globo; CEE: Daro; Croatia: Pickbox; Czech Republic: Prima; Denmark: TV2; Finland: MTV 3; France: Canal +; Germany: RTL; Greece: Vodafone; Hungary: TV2; Iceland: RUV; Israel: Hot; Italy: Sky Italia; Japan: NHK; Middle East: BBC Studios; New Zealand: Sky; Norway: TV2; Poland: NC +; Russia: Kultura; Spain: Telefonica; Sweden: TV4; Turkey: BluTV"
