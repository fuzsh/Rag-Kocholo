        "text": "Agatha Christie's world-famous serial killer mystery, reissued with a striking new cover designed to appeal to the latest generation of Agatha Christie fans and book lovers.\n\nThere's a serial killer on the loose, bent on working his way through the alphabet. And as a macabre calling card he leaves beside each victim's corpe the ABC Railway Guide open at the name of the town where the murder has taken place.\n\nHaving begun with Andover, Bexhill and then Churston, there seems little chance of the murderer being caught – until he makes the crucial and vain mistake of challenging Hercule Poirot to frustrate his plans…\n\nAbout Agatha Christie\n\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Christie was an English writer known for her murder mystery novels and short stories. She has also written romances under the name Mary Westmacott.\n\nA prolific writer, Agatha Christie wrote 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections and is best remembered for characters such as Hercule Poirot, Miss Jane Marple, and Tommy and Tuppence Beresford. Some of her most famous works are: The Mysterious Affair At Styles, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, And Then There Were None and Curtain: Poirot's Last Case. Her play, The Mousetrap, holds the record as the longest initial run of any play in history, running at the West End of London since 1952. She was bestowed with the Order of the British Empire for her contributions towards English literature.\n\nPublisher: HarperCollins Publisher\n\nISBN: 978-0-00-728245-6\n\nNumber of pages: 331 pages\n\nProvided by RM"
