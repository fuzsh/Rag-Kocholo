        "text": "Genre: Mystery, Thriller Book Name: The ABC Murders Author: Agatha Christie Pages: 247 Publication Year: 1936\n\nHere comes book review of yet another Hercule Poirot featuring book. I think I am addicted to not liking any other writers, or probably not feel like any other book. It is not that I have not tried, but other books bore me within 10-20 pages while I am into them and rather like a besotted fool, I again pick up another Agatha Christie. Thankfully, she has written so many books to last me for few months, even if I complete a book a week along with office work and house chores.\n\nThe ABC Murders is yet another mind-blogging thriller where the murderer takes Hercule Poirot this time for a ride, right from the start of the book. One where the murderer writes to Poirot about next murder schedule and Poirot in the start thinks of it as a hoax. Is the serial killer a psychopath or a well-planned and thought off-plan? Along with Hastings, we as a reader wonder how many more letters to go where we will be able to catch this person. Definitely worth a read and one of Agatha’s best!\n\nKeep watching my blog for more of Agatha Christie books."
