        "text": "Fabulous reader, interesting and unpredictable classic Poirot, really well done!\n\nAnother great Poirot Hastings combo, with all the classic elements of language and intrigue. Sure to please Poirot fans. Fabulously read!\n\nFirst Serial Murder Case Told by Hastings\n\nAnother installment illustrations the methodical workings of Hercule Poirot's little gray cells. Rather fantastic seeming, the first serial murder case Hastings has told us about. The alphabetical nature did have me wondering. I liked the new investigative legion of victims' family/friends to help hone in on the culprit. I particularly liked a comment Poirot made about how conversation was the undoing of concealment and his quoting that speech was man's invention to prevent thinking. He hinged much throughout the investigation on what would come to light in the course of discussion - and, of course, he was right. And as always he (and the narrative) employed a little misdirection and suggestion while the pieces fell into place. Leading up to the traditional reveal scene I still had no clue how the explanation would go...my suspicions had been thoroughly diverted. Until he said something in the early moments of his speech about the nature and personality of the killer, and it suddenly dawned on me. Still a nice little surprise or two in the denouement after that. Trusty narrator Fraser again did not disappoint, incorporating numerous voices and accents to distinguish not only the traditional cast but more than a dozen other major and minor players. An interesting mystery, unique in many ways, and yet still classic Christie / Poirot style.\n\nThe One with the Serial Killer\n\nInitially I wasn’t sure if I like this book as much as other stories of Christie’s. But by the last word I was very satisfied. I must read for any Agatha Christie fan and as always the narration is spot on. Hugh Fraser is one of the best narrators I have ever listened to."
