        "text": "If you are like me and have a goal to read all the Hercule Poirot Books this list of Hercule Poirot Books in order is a must-have.\n\nIn 2021 I did a backlist books challenge. My challenge was to not read any books published in 2021. I could only read books published in 2020 or earlier.\n\nMy goal was to not get distracted by the new and shiny books. I also wanted to read some of the books that I owned and the books that I had meant to read for years.\n\nMy daughter had been trying to get me to read an Agatha Christie book for years, my backlist book challenge was a great reason to finally pick one up to read.\n\nI am so glad that I finally read one. I can’t believe it took me so long to read an Agatha Christie book.\n\nI read several Hercule Poirot books by Agatha Christie in 2021 and I loved them all.\n\nI now have a goal to read all the Hercule Poirot books.\n\nI know this will take me several years, possibly ten or more years because I plan to read other books too.\n\nI also want to make them last. I don’t want to rush through the series because there won’t be any more Hercule Poirot books by Agatha Christie.\n\nNormally we don’t put lists together of books that we haven’t read, but I needed an easy way to keep track of the right order of Hercule Poirot books.\n\nI also wanted to keep track of the ones that I have read and have left to read.\n\nAs I was putting the list together I realized that others might find it helpful too. So, I am sharing my list of Hercule Poirot books in order with you.\n\nI have read a couple of random Hercule Poirot books, but my plan now is to go back and try to read the rest in order.\n\nThere is some debate on whether or not Hercule Poirot’s short stories are included when the books are listed in order. Some have them on the list and some do not. I did some research on it, and could not find a definite answer.\n\nI included them on my list, but I made it clear that they were short stories, not regular books in the series. I am not sure if I will include the short stories when I read them or not.\n\nDo I need to read them in order?\n\nNo, the Poirot books do not need to be read in order. The first few that I read were not in order. I hope to read the rest of them in order, or at least mainly in order, but you do not have to.\n\nWhere to find Hercule Poirot Books\n\nA few of the Hercule Poirot books can be hard to find, but most used and new bookstores carry the more popular Hercule Poirot books.\n\nThey are also backlist titles so most libraries will have them as well.\n\nOne of the ways I like to find them is on Scribd and Kindle Unlimited. If you have either of those it is a great way to read them. Scribd also has many of them as audiobooks which is a fun way to read if you enjoy audio books.\n\nHercule Poirot Books by Agatha Christie\n\n1. The Mysterious Affair at Styles was published in 1920\n\nAgatha Christie’s first novel introduced us to detective Hercule Poirot. I read this one in 2021 and loved it.\n\n2. The Murder on the Links was published in 1923\n\nHercule Poirot heads to France after a plea from a client. However, he is too late. The man who summoned him is found dead and Poirot has to solve the case.\n\nThis was the third or fourth Agatha Christie book that I read in 2021. It is a well-written mystery book that I really enjoyed. It wasn’t my favorite of the Agatha Christie book I have read, but I think that is because I figured out the murderer early on in the book.\n\n3. Poirot Investigates published was in 1924\n\nA collection of short stories featuring Hercule Poirot.\n\n4.
