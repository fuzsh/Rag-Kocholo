        "text": "Nowadays Java and C++ programming languages are vastly used in competitive coding. Due to some awesome features, these two programming languages are widely used in industries as well as comepetitive programming . C++ is a widely popular language among coders for its efficiency, high speed, and dynamic memory utilization. Java is widely used in the IT industry’s , It is incomparable to any other programming language in terms of software development. Let us go through the various points to compare these popular coding languages:\n\nSimilarities between Java and C++\n\n1. Execution: At compile-time, Java source code or .java file is converted into bytecode or .class file. At runtime, JVM (Java Virtual Machine) will load the .class file and will convert it to machine code with the help of an interpreter. After compilation of method calls (using the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler), JVM will execute the optimized code. So Java is both compiled as well as an interpreted language. On the other hand, C++ executes the code by using only a compiler. The C++ compiler compiles and converts the source code into the machine code. That’s why C++ is faster than Java but not platform-independent.\n\nBelow is the illustration of how Java and C++ codes are executed:\n\nThe execution of a Java code is as follows:\n\nExecution of a C++ Code\n\n2. Features: C++ and Java both have several Object Oriented programming features which provide many useful programming functionalities. Some features are supported by one and some by the other. Even though both languages use the concept of OOPs, neither can be termed 100% object-oriented languages. Java uses primitive data types and thus cannot be termed as 100% Object-Oriented Language. C++ uses some data types similar to primitive ones and can implement methods without using any data type. And thus, it is also deprived of the 100% Object-Oriented title.\n\nBelow is the table which shows the features supported and not supported by both the programming languages:\n\nSyntax Difference:\n\nSyntax of c++:\n\nsyntax of java\n\nApplications: Both C++ and Java have vast areas of application. Below are the applications of both languages:\n\nApplications of C++ Programming language:\n\nSuitable for Developing large software (like passenger reservation systems).\n\nMySQL is written in C++.\n\nFor fast execution, C++ is majorly used in Game Development.\n\nGoogle Chromium browser, file system, and cluster data processing are all written in C++.\n\nAdobe Premiere, Photoshop, and Illustrator; these popular applications are scripted in C++.\n\nAdvanced Computations and Graphics- real-time physical simulations, high-performance image processing.\n\nC++ is also used in many advanced types of medical equipment like MRI machines, etc.\n\nApplications of Java Programming language:\n\nDesktop GUI Applications development.\n\nAndroid and Mobile application development.\n\nApplications of Java are in embedded technologies like SIM cards, disk players, TV, etc.\n\nJava EE (Enterprise Edition) provides an API and runtime environment for running large enterprise software.\n\nNetwork Applications and Web services like Internet connection, Web App Development.\n\nEnvironment: C++ is a Platform dependent while Java is a platform-independent programming language. We have to write and run C++ code on the same platform. Java has the WORA (Write Once and Run Everywhere) feature by which we can write our code in one platform once and we can run the code anywhere.\n\nDifferences between Java and C++ are as follows:"
