        "text": "In this section, we provide a list of known limitations in MySQL Cluster releases in the 5.0.x series compared to features available when using the MyISAM and InnoDB storage engines. Currently, there are no plans to address these in coming releases of MySQL 5.0; however, we will attempt to supply fixes for these issues in subsequent release series. If you check the “Cluster” category in the MySQL bugs database at http://bugs.mysql.com, you can find known bugs which (if marked “5.0”) we intend to correct in upcoming releases of MySQL 5.0.\n\nThe list here is intended to be complete with respect to the conditions just set forth. You can report any discrepancies that you encounter to the MySQL bugs database using the instructions given in Section 1.8, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”. If we do not plan to fix the problem in MySQL 5.0, we will add it to the list.\n\n(Note: See the end of this section for a list of issues in MySQL 4.1 Cluster that have been resolved in the current version.)\n\nThe following Cluster limitations in MySQL 4.1 have been resolved in MySQL 5.0 as shown below:"
