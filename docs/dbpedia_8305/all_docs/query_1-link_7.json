This document summarizes a seminar report on web clustering engines. It discusses the motivation for web clustering engines, as conventional search engines often return mixed results for ambiguous queries. The goal of web clustering engines is to organize search results by topic into a hierarchy of labeled clusters. The document outlines the typical architecture of web clustering engines, including search result acquisition, preprocessing, cluster construction and labeling using various algorithms, and visualization of clustered results. It also discusses efficiency factors, improving efficiency, performance evaluation, and future research directions for web clustering engines.",
