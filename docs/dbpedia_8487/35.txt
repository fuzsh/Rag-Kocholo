Round table cycle:

Almada Negreiros: a way of being modern

The exposure José de Almada Negreiros: a way of being modern constitutes an opportunity to think about what various artists and historians understood by modernism, what different artistic proposals claimed to be part of modernity, what were the connections between politics and art in the authoritarian regimes of the 20th century and what were the perspectives that different generations of the artistic community, criticism or historians have had on artists active since the beginning of the 20th century. These are the topics that the round table cycle aims to discuss. A special session, dedicated to the four artistic manifestos written by Almada Negreiros, will take place at Casa Fernando Pessoa. This cycle is organized by the Institute of Art History of Faculty of Social and Human Sciences at Universidade Nova de Lisboa.
