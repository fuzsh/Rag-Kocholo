Born on April 7, 1893 in São Tomé and Príncipe, a Portuguese colony at the time, and died on June 15, 1970 in Lisbon, Portugal.

Almada Negreiros was a central figure of Portuguese modernism, an artistic and literary movement that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century and which sought to break with traditional conventions and explore new forms of expression.\n\nAs a writer, he published poems, essays, manifestos and plays. His literary work was marked by an iconoclastic and avant-garde stance, addressing themes such as modernity, futurism and social criticism.\n\nAs a painter, Almada Negreiros developed his own style, characterized by geometric shapes, vibrant colors and an innovative approach. He also worked as a set designer, creating sets and costumes for plays and operas.\n\nAlmada Negreiros had a significant influence on the Portuguese artistic and literary scene, collaborating with other important artists and writers of the time, such as Fernando Pessoa and Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso. His work is recognized for its innovative, experimental character and for the way in which he explored the limits of art and creative expression.\n\nToday, Almada Negreiros is considered one of the greatest exponents of art and literature in Portugal, and his legacy continues to be celebrated and studied. His works are present in museums and art galleries, and his contribution to Portuguese culture is widely recognized.\n\nWhat were the characteristics of Almada Negreiros’ works?\n\nVanguardism: Almada Negreiros was a central figure of modernism in Portugal.

He combined realistic elements with abstract elements, creating images that transcended reality and evoked deeper meanings.\n\nVibrant colors and expressive lines: Almada Negreiros explored a diverse palette, combining contrasting tones to create visual impact and convey emotions. The use of lines is a striking feature in his works. He used expressive and gestural lines, which gave movement and energy to the compositions.
