        "text": "This paper aims to contrast the particular uses of the modern categories of ingenuousness and primitivism both in José de Almada Negreiros and Ernesto de Sousa within their broader presence in twentieth century art. In so doing it seeks to contextualize multiple ways of understanding modernity and its legitimation through discursive practices. Ernesto de Sousa reinterpreted an idea of modernity that followed up on Almada Negreiros' modern experience. The concept of \"voluntary ingenuousness\" was developed by Almada after the 1920s, but it had its roots in the futurist proposals he embraced in the first decades of the twentieth century. Primitivism and ingenuousness were the fundamental terms for Almada Negreiros and Ernesto de Sousa through which they reinvented themselves as well as modernity and forged liberty within a dictatorship regime.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.7301/Z02J6923 Date Issued: Spring 2017 In revisiting the historical circumstances and material culture of the generation of Orpheu, this special issue is largely driven by a historiographical aim of reconstructing the socio-cultural context of the earliest modernist manifestations in Portugal and to sketch a kind of ‘sociography’ of Orpheu, its milieu and its time, which includes the larger international context of the outbreak of WWI and contemporary phenomena in the cultural field [...] In considering that the modernism of the generation of Orpheu is not satisfactorily explained solely through an aesthetic critical lens, contributions to this issue draw on concepts which originate in the social sciences and are predominantly used in the field of cultural studies, such as internationalization, transnationalism, cosmopolitanism, materialization or synthesis.\n\n“Por esse crepusculo a morte de um fauno” was Augusto Ferreira Gomes’s contribution to the third number of Orpheu, that was never published despite repeated attempts and announcements. Only in 1983 the typographical proofs of the number would be published in a photomechanical reproduction. This article transcribes and discusses the recently discovered manuscript of the text, in the context of the magazine’s history, focusing on three points: the characterization of the text as ekphrasis, and the analysis of its expressive means; the imagery of the faun in contemporary European culture and Ferreira Gomes’s possible cultural referents; and the omission of the dedication to the painter António Soares in the published version of the manuscript (1983, 1984). http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Portuguese_Brazilian_Studies/ejph/pessoaplural/issues.html\n\nO Notícias Ilustrado was published from 1928 to 1935, coinciding with the emergence of Salazar's dictatorship. Reporting the cosmopolitan life, it described itself as \"the only graphic newspaper of modern and European appearance\". Its collaborators included figures from among the Modernist generation that would later be associated with the regime's cultural policy. On its pages one can see a renewal of the theatrical revue format, it covered elements that were a repercussion of the Modernists' interest for folk art and the rediscovery of the national heritage. A straightforward analysis reveals that this reinterpretation of folk traditions was mainly addressed as modern up to the moment when an official culture policy was set; from 1933 onwards this modernity was veiled. In this analysis it could be perceived how similar works, by being addressed differently, could imply the different contexts of 1930s Portugal.\n\nLargely due to the conservatism of audiences and critics, Portuguese theatre was mostly indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the avant-garde theatre coming from elsewhere in Europe. Therefore, naturalistic theatre and historical drama were the staple of Portuguese theatres until the 1950s, with the only exception of the plays of Almada Negreiros and symbolist plays by Fernando Pessoa, Raul Brandão and António Patrício. However, modernism found its place on stage in one of the most typical Portuguese theatre forms: «Revista à Portuguesa», the Portuguese revue theatre, which welcomed the first generation of Portuguese modernist painters to work as set and costume designers. Artists like Jorge Barradas, Milly Possoz, José Barbosa, among others, took the influence of the Ballets Russes of Diaghlev, and the avant-garde visual arts, to change the appearance of the most typically Portuguese theatre genre, Revista à Portuguesa. With this paper I will try to document how modernist painters gained entry in «Revista à Portuguesa» and created an art that fused the commercial interests of theatre entrepreneurs, the tastes of the bourgeois audiences and their own artistic sensibilities.\n\nPaper published in the 'Southern Modernisms: critical stances through regional appropriations International Conference' proceedings. Abstract: Diário de Notícias newspaper published a weekly magazine entitled O Notícias Ilustrado between March 1928 and 1935, which coincide with the arrival to government of António Salazar (April 27th 1928) and the regime stabilization after the 1933 Constitution ratification. It was the first Portuguese magazine entirely printed through rotogravure technology and thus graphically fresh and modern due to an innovative use of composition, photography and modern typography. It focused mainly on reporting the modern and urban cosmopolitan life: sports, novelties, entertainment, the jet set lifestyle and other mass culture phenomena while also alluding (more or less lightly) to politics. As one of the most innovative general periodicals, it was directed, and on it collaborated, several figures of the Modernist generation some of whom, after 1933, would be associated with the official cultural policy. Throughout its pages it is possible to perceive the renovation of theatrical revue as well as of other popular entertainment: theatre, dance, music and cinema. These theatre plays presented elements that, in tune with some foreign tendencies, were broadly inspired by an earliest interest of modernists for folk art and for the rediscovery of national or local heritage, while synchronously an international hegemony in design was rising. A straightforward analysis of the magazine titles and texts reveal that this modernist interpretation of folklore for the stage (on sets, costumes, but also in music and choreography) was mainly announced as a 'modern' context up to the moment where an official culture policy was set by SPN; from 1933 onwards this modern aspect was veiled as the praising of 'regional' and 'popular' original roots was now strongly displayed. This analysis could be viewed as a representative case of how the diverse terms (for the same kind of works) implied and expressed different contexts in 1930’s Portugal."
