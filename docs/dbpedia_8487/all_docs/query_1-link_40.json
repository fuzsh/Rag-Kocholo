        "text": "A century ago, in March 1915, the first issue of Orpheu magazine was launched in Lisbon. The result of a Portuguese-Brazilian literature project, the publication brought together cutting-edge Portuguese artists and intellectuals, such as Fernando Pessoa, Mário de Sá-Carneiro, Almada-Negreiros, Alfredo Pedro Guisado and the Brazilian Ronald de Carvalho.\n\nInspired by European avant-garde, the publication had the purpose of revolutionizing thought and the arts, bringing together artists aligned with modern aesthetics. Therefore, it went down in history as the founding landmark of Modernism in Portugal.\n\n“Our intention is to form, in a group or idea, a chosen number of revelations in thought or art, which based on this aristocratic principle have in Orpheus their esoteric and very our ideal of feeling and knowing ourselves”, wrote the director of the magazine in Portugal, Luís de Montalvor, in the introduction of the first issue. In this way, he defined publication as “an exile of artistic temperaments that want it as a secret or a torment”. In addition to Montalvor, the poet Ronald de Carvalho was at the head of the project, as director in Brazil.\n\nA hundred years later, what remains of the aesthetic revolution triggered by Orpheus? What are your legacies? Answering these questions is the motto of the book Orpheu 1915-2015, organized by researcher and literary critic Carlos Felipe Moisés, graduated from the University of São Paulo (USP).\n\nThe volume, launched by Editora da Unicamp, brings together a collection of original texts from the magazine and articles about the movement, published throughout the 20th century. The objective is to motivate and support the debate on the meanings and repercussions of the magazine.\n\n“I tried to collect texts that represented the variety of reactions triggered by the magazine”, explains Moisés. The aim is to highlight that Orpheu was not a dated episode, limited to the moment of his appearance. “The magazine constitutes a dense and lasting matrix of aesthetic-literary stimuli, the effects of which can be followed, in successive metamorphoses, decade after decade, generation after generation”.\n\nIn this sense, reiterates the literary critic, the publication remains alive, as it has never been forgotten. Despite this, he believes that resuming Orpheu in contemporary times is a necessity: “Only the living memory of stories like Orpheus allows inertia and complacency to continue to be combatted”, says Moisés.\n\nREACTION\n\nIn its first issue, Orpheu generated intense negative repercussions in the Portuguese cultural and artistic environment, still strongly marked by classicism and removed from the aesthetic revolutions that were plaguing other parts of Europe.\n\nThe magazine was characterized as “madhouse literature”, and the young authors were ridiculed - especially Sá-Carneiro and Álvaro de Campos, one of Fernando Pessoa's heteronyms. The first published a set of poems that would later make up Indícios de Oiro, among them “16” and “Our Lady of Paris”, which thematize the inability to adapt to life and the feeling of incompleteness. By Álvaro de Campos, “Opiário” and “Ode Triunfal” were published, a compliment to the frenetic and mechanized environment of modernity.\n\nInstead of intimidating, the scandalized reaction served as ammunition for the group that became known as Geração de Orpheu. In August 1915, the second issue of the publication was released, with even more radical contours.\n\nSá-Carneiro and Pessoa took over the direction of Orpheu, abandoning the project of a binational magazine. The edition featured reproductions of Cubist paintings by the artist Guilherme de Santa-Rita, as well as poems by Ângelo de Lima, a mentally ill person who lived in an asylum. Also participating were Eduardo Guimarães [Brazilian writer], Raul Leal, Violante de Cysneiros (pseudonym of Armando Cortes-Rodrigues), Almada Negreiros, Raul Leal and Luís de Montalvor, as well as Sá-Carneiro and Pessoa.\n\nThe criticism and rejection generated by the second issue of Orpheu were as intense as that of the first. Even so, the group led by Pessoa and Sá-Carneiro went on to the third number.\n\nThe intention, however, ran into obstacles that made the project unfeasible: the edition was assembled and sent to the printer, but was not printed. Financial difficulties and the early death of Sá-Carneiro in 1916 were decisive for the project to be aborted.\n\nA letter from Sá-Carneiro to Pessoa, reproduced in the book Orpheu 1915-2015, helps to understand the problems faced by the publication. “In two words: we unfortunately have to give up our Orpheus. All the reasons will be given to you better by my Father's letter which I enclose and ask that you do not forget to read. Of course it is due to a moment of exaltation. In the meantime, I am full of reasons for the exorbitant bill that I force my Father to pay (...) the simple appearance of Orpheus no. Father my insubordination. It’s a shame I created illusions, made you talk to collaborators, etc.”\n\nIn other words, due to the difficulties of Sá-Carneiro, who had been bearing the costs of the magazine, using the allowance he received from his father for this purpose, obviously without his father's consent, the project had to be interrupted.\n\nA LIVING SPIRIT\n\nThe end of Orpheu did not mean the end of Modernism in Portugal. As the author of the book emphasizes, the magazine was ephemeral, but the idea was immediately followed by the publication of other magazines, equally ephemeral, while the revolutionary impetus lasted, and continued for years.\n\n“In this regard, it is worth remembering that the magazine Presença, which appeared in the late 1920s, as the assumed heir of Orpheu, was no longer so ephemeral, giving firm continuity to what the pioneers had started. And so it has been, until today.” Conclusion: the project has not stopped moving forward, argues Moisés. “The supposed lack of 'space' for rebellion, in a recognizably conservative environment, has been not an impediment, but, on the contrary, a good reason for the revolution to continue.”\n\nLaunched in 1927, Presença circulated until 1940 and went down in history as one of the most influential Portuguese literary magazines of the XNUMXth century, responsible for the dissemination of Second Modernism.\n\nThe publication has, according to literary critic Moisés, a firm relationship with Orpheu, expressed in the statement by its director, Adolfo Casais Monteiro: “We, writers, have a debt to this generation. This is in fact the strange truth: Orpheus’ generation only carried out part of its action through the Presence.”\n\nInstead of being a direct, watertight inheritance, Orpheus's legacy refers to several critical-theoretical questions, raised by the aesthetics of his successor, the Presence.\n\nThe very conception of modernity is one of them. In Moses' view, Orpheu's revolutionary modernity resulted from the convergence and, often, the fusion of opposites - the individual and the collective, the future and the past, the old and the new, boldness and restraint, transgression and conservation. “Only in this way does Fernando Pessoa's definitive verdict gain full meaning: 'Orpheu is over. Orpheu continues'”, analyzes the researcher. Orpheu “continues” precisely because he did not stick to just one of these aspects, whether the conservative one, defended by Luís de Montalvor, or the more rebellious one, represented by Sá-Carneiro, Almada Negreiros or Álvaro de Campos.\n\nThe author reinforces his argument with an example: in each issue Orpheu hosts productions of contradictory trends and stances, such as the decadentism of Ronald de Carvalho (moderate avant-garde) and the futurism of Sá-Carneiro (radical avant-garde). In other words, the conservative attitude shared ground with the revolution.\n\nThis step forward, the target of virulent criticism precisely because it shook the structures of the way literature and art were created in Portugal, is what would have enabled the consolidation of modernist movements in the country, thanks to the effort led by Presença, based on the pioneering spirit of the magazine Orpheu and its immediate successors: Exílio (1916), Centauro (1916), Portugal Futurista (1917) and Athena (1924-1925).\n\nA PERSON’S PLACE\n\nAmong the authors who participated in Orpheu, Fernando Pessoa had a decisive importance in ensuring that the publication's ideas remained alive. “If it weren’t for Fernando Pessoa, Orpheu magazine would have fallen into oblivion, shortly after the publication of its two issues”, says Moisés. “That’s why, since then, when we think of Orpheu, we immediately think of Fernando Pessoa.”\n\nHowever, the prominence that the poet occupies had the consequence of relegating other important authors to a secondary level, such as Sá-Carneiro, Almada Negreiros, José Régio, Casais Monteiro, Jorge de Sena, among others.\n\n“Person’s extraordinary figure has condemned not only the magazine, but also other exponential figures, to limbo”, he states. Furthermore, it clouds the perception of the publication as the result of collective action. “Therefore, we run the risk of minimizing or even forgetting what Orpheu was and, above all, what continued to be, as a collective action.”\n\nAccording to Moisés, Orpheu represented, for Fernando Pessoa, a privileged moment in which he believed in the need for collective action, beyond or below the accomplishment of his individual work. A “moment” that was not limited to 1915-1916, but extended to other magazines in which he pursued the same purpose in the following years, and had developments that resonate to this day.\n\nThus, if on the one hand the primacy granted to the poet of heteronyms is justified, on the other hand it would be necessary to rethink this centuries-old history."
