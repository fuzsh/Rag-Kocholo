        "text": "Zafri Mudasser Nofil\n\n(New Delhi, May 17, 2015) Leong Lin Chi, who lives in Makum in Assam’s Tinsukia district, was only six years old when she got separated from her parents who were deported to China in 1962.\n\nShe now longs to meet her ageing and ailing parents and has approached the government for helping her in doing so. Leong, now known as Pramila Das, is among the several hundreds of Assamese people of Chinese origin facing a severe identity crisis.\n\nMost of these Chinese people had come much before India’s independence. They were brought to Assam by East India Company officials for establishing the tea industry. After that there were some voluntary migration from China to Assam and Bengal.\n\nSays author Rita Chowdhury, who has done extensive research on the subject, “Most of these people in Assam got married with local girls and settled down there. As time passed by, a large society of the Assamese-Chinese was formed and flourished in Assam. An estimated 1,500 people of Chinese origin are believed to be living in Assam.\n\n“They forgot their own language and most of them never went back to China again. Most of the people were illiterate and ignorant of political changes.”\n\nBut after the 1962 India-China war, they were sent to a detention camp in Deoli in Rajasthan so that they don’t work as spies.\n\n“Some of them were deported to China while a few were released later. Those released came back to Assam only to find that their property were all gone. The deported people are still considered as Indian refugees,” she adds.\n\nChowdhury, whose has written a novel Makam on the subject and recently a coffee-table book The Divided Soul, has one dream – Assamese people with Chinese origin feeling as secure as other Indian citizens and the deportees and their families coming to India to see their birthplace and meet their loved ones without any fear.\n\nThe senior lecturer in Political Science at Cotton College in Guwahati urges the government and the civil society to come forward to provide necessary political and social protection to the Indian-Chinese “living in silence, fear and insecurity”.\n\nLeong’s father Leong Kok Hoi worked as a carpenter at Rangagara tea estate in Assam and her mother Chanu Leong was a Mizo.\n\nShe still remembers that fateful day when her parents were detained. She was in her maternal grandmother’s house. By the time her grandmother came to know about the arrests, it was too late. She rushed to the railway station with her granddaughter to send her with her parents but in vain.\n\nThe Chinese were already being taken away from that station to some unknown destination.\n\n“I have been passing my days with deep pain. I have never seen my parents since then. However, I started receiving letters from them and came to know that they were alive but getting old and ailing. They, too, are longing to see us,” says Leong.\n\nBy the time, Chowdhury decided to write about the Assamese Chinese community and visited Makum, the biggest China town of Assam, it was already very late as most of the people who knew about the history of the Chinese diaspora in Assam and who could have told her about the pain they had to suffer during and after the Sino-Indian war had passed away.\n\n“They had left with a lot of remorse and pain in their heart. The people who were young at the time of the war had become old,” she says.\n\nShe started her mission by meeting the people who were repatriated to China after the Sino-Indian War. The majority of them have been living in Hong Kong since then.\n\n“I was the first non-Chinese person who went in search of them after long 45 years after their deportation.”\n\nHer biggest challenge was to win their confidence but she says fortunately they responded positively and they poured their hearts out to her.\n\nChowdhury’s new book The Divided Soul, published by The Pangea House, was released last week by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh who said this work will help a lot in cementing India-China ties.\n\nHer debut novel Abirata Jatra (Incessant Journey) in 1981 fetched her the Asom Sahitya Sabha award.\n\nShe wrote a series of popular novels like Thirthabhumi (The Shrine) in 1988, Maha Jibanar Adharshila (Foundation Stone of Great Life) in 1993, Nayana Tarali Sujata in 1996, Popiya Torar Xadhu (Tale of a Meteor) in 1998, Rag-malkosh in 1999, Jala-Padma (Water-Lotus) in 1999, Hridoy Nirupai (The Helpless Heart) in 2003, Deo Langkhui (The Divine Sword) in 2005, Makam (The Golden Horse) in 2010 and Mayabritta (The circle of Worldly Illusion) in 2012.\n\nShe won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2008 for her novel Deo Langkhui which was based on the Tiwas of Assam.\n\nZafri Mudasser Nofil\n\n(New Delhi, Feb 15, 2015) If all the large dams proposed by China on rivers within Tibet begin operations, the Brahmaputra river will never be the same again, warns a Canadian environmentalist who has done extensive research on the subject.\n\n“Currently, Chinese engineers are constructing a five-dam cascade on the mid-reaches of the Tsangpo (Brahmaputra). Zhangmu Dam, with a capacity of 540 MW, has already started operation. The dam lies 86 miles southeast of Lhasa. Construction is under way on the other dams in this cascade,” says Michael Buckley.\n\n“China claims these dams will have no impact downstream, but the fact is that these dams are just the start of things, with bigger and bigger dams on the drawing-board, such as 800-MW Zhongyu Dam on a Yarlung Tsangpo tributary. Within Tibet, at least 20 large dams are planned for the Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) and its tributaries. If all go into operation, the river will never be the same again,” he told PTI.\n\nBuckley has also written a book Meltdown in Tibet: China’s Reckless Destruction of Ecosystems from the Highlands of Tibet to the Deltas of Asia in which he tries to focus on the darker side of China’s emergence as a global super power.\n\nThe book, published by Palgrave Macmillan, has a preface by the Dalai Lama in which the Tibetan spiritual leader says that “Meltdown in Tibet” should be “part of a wake-up call to the international community and China to seriously assess ecological and environmental conditions on the Tibetan plateau and take remedial measures”.\n\nOn the ecological impact on Assam and Arunachal Pradesh that may be posed due to the construction of big dams on the Brahmaputra and other rivers by China, Buckley says the fragile ecosystem is at risk.\n\nThe Great Bend (in Tibet) of the Brahmaputra from where the river begins its course towards India holds the greatest hydropower potential in the world, says Buckley, who has travelled extensively throughout Southeast Asia, and the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges and has made a documentary on major environmental issues in Tibet.\n\n“A huge dam at the Great Bend would devastate the river’s fragile ecosystem – destroying the magnificent biodiversity of the Assam and Himachal Pradesh region. This is much more than a question of water coursing into India: a huge dam would withhold the river’s sediment from the fertile floodplains of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\n“A huge volume of nutrient-rich sediment (silt) flows down the Brahmaputra from Tibet. Dams block silt, thus affecting the food security of the nations downstream, which need silt for productive agriculture and to bolster the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta against rising sea-levels. Tributaries swell the Brahmaputra from the Indian side, but the greatest sediment load comes in from Tibet,” he says.\n\nBuckley suggests a moratorium on mega-dam building in Tibet – and across the entire Himalayan range – and including India’s own mega-dam-building plans.\n\n“Mega-dams mean mega problems. Mega-dams have severe impact on the ecosystems that these rivers support, disrupting fisheries and reducing biodiversity. Water quality may be severely degraded in stagnant reservoirs,and whole communities must be relocated for areas flooded by dam reservoirs,” he asserts.\n\nBuckley also suggests that India needs to stand up to this travesty. “India needs to negotiate water-sharing rights with China (as India has done with Pakistan and with Bangladesh).”\n\nOf the major consequences of rapid melting of Tibet’s glaciers, he says initially, the impact will be increased flow in the rivers – meaning flooding.\n\n“Then eventually that will be followed by drastically reduced flow (as the glaciers disappear) and then no flow at all. Monsoon rains cannot maintain the water levels in these rivers – they are dependent on glacier-fed water for the most part,” he says.\n\n(New Delhi, Jan 27, 2015) Assamese filmmaker Jahnu Barua, selected for the Padma Bhushan, says the award is a recognition to the cinema industry in general and to the northeast in particular and will inspire more people from the region in various fields.\n\n“The award is an inspiring stimulus for those involved in art and culture and also other fields. It is a respect and recognition to the industry and also to the northeast and Assam,” 62-year-old Barua, who was conferred with Padma Shri in 2003, told PTI from Mumbai where he is based.\n\nKnown for making films on social issues, Barua has won 10 National Film Awards and over 25 awards at international festivals.\n\nHe says the recognition will act as an inspiration to upcoming talents from the northeast.\n\n“The award is not just for me, it is for my family, the people I work with and all people related to art and culture,” says Barua, whose 2005 film Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara, starring Anupam Kher and Urmila Matondkar, brought him critical acclaim.\n\nHis Halodhiya Choraye Baodhan Khai (Catastrophe) won the President’s Swarna Kamal for the best feature film in 1987, while Hkhagoroloi Bohu Door (It’s a Long Way to the Sea) received the Swarna Kamal for best director in 1996.\n\nFiringoti (Spark) won him the second best National film award and the best actress award for Moloya Goswami.\n\nBarua, who has been involved in social work related to art and culture, says it is good that the government has recognised his contribution in this regard.\n\n“I have been visiting colleges and universities and sharing experiences with the students and this gives me a lot of satisfaction,” he says.\n\nHis latest Assamese movie Ajeyo opened the screening of an eight films retrospective at the 2014 International Film Festival of India in Goa.\n\n(New Delhi, Nov 14, 2014) A doodle by a Pune schoolgirl artfully depicting the natural and cultural richness of Assam has been featured today on the Google India homepage on the occasion of Children’s Day.\n\nVaidehi Reddy, a class IX student of Army Public School, was adjudged the winner of this year’s India Doodle4Google (D4G) contest in which there were more than a million entries from over 2,100 schools across 50 cities.\n\nThe winning doodle is titled “Natural and Cultural Paradise – Assam” in which Reddy depicted the state’s famed wildlife by sketching the one-horned rhinoceros, the tiger, tea bushes and bamboo trees. A woman performing the Bihu dance carrying a ‘japi’ (traditional hat) is also there in the doodle.\n\n“I want to go to Assam because it is rich in both, natural beauty and culture. Its music and rich folk arts are also very good,” Reddy said in her caption in the contest which asked the participants to draw their own doodle about “A place in India I wish to visit”.\n\nHer entry was selected by a jury comprising political cartoonist Ajit Ninan, Art Director Children’s Publishing at ACK Media Savio Mascarenhas and Google Doodle team lead Ryan Germick.\n\nThe doodles were judged on three criteria – artistic merit, creativity and theme communication.\n\nDoodles are the spontaneous changes that are made to the Google logo in celebration of holidays, anniversaries and the lives of famous artists, pioneers and scientists who have helped shape history.\n\nSince 1998 there have been over 2,000 doodles on Google homepages around the world. Themes based on India have featured on the Google page umpteen number of times and more recently on occasions like R K Narayan’s 108th birthday (October 10) and the Lok Sabha elections counting day (May 16). Independence Day and Republic Day are featured every year.\n\nOn August 4, Google paid a tribute to legendary singer-actor Kishore Kumar on his 85th birth anniversary by dedicating a special doodle to him.\n\nThe doodle showed the late music icon’s sketch replacing the L of ‘GOOGLE’ and borders with drawings of masks, pen and paper, camera and symbol of music, depicting his versatility as an artiste.\n\nIn 1998, Google’s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin placed a stick figure drawing behind the second ‘o’ in the word Google as a message to users that they were “out of the office” attending a music and art festival.\n\nFrom there the idea of decorating the logo to mark cultural moments was born. Users really enjoyed this quirky change to the clean Google homepage. As a result a turkey was added on Thanksgiving in 1998, two pumpkins for the ‘o’s appeared for Halloween in October of 1999 as well as a few others.\n\nAfter two years of playing around with the logo on special occasions, Larry and Sergey asked webmaster Dennis Hwang to create a doodle for Bastille Day in France. Soon after he was appointed the chief doodler and doodles became more frequent occurrences on the homepage.\n\nUsers started seeing doodles for more holidays and starting in 2003 doodles for people’s birthdays. The first being Monet in 2001, Picasso in 2002 and then Michelangelo and Albert Einstein six months later. Since then the amount of doodles and the variety of subjects have grown to celebrate a much wider array of events, holidays, anniversaries and birthdays of some of history’s greats.\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 19, 2014) The national capital will have a carnival atmosphere next month as it plays host to a four-day festival that will offer a taste of the Northeast through music, dance, fashion and food of the region.\n\nThe second North East Festival from November 7-10 festival will also focus on various business and investment opportunities that the region presents, apart from showcasing the multifarious culture and rich heritage of the northeastern states.\n\nTwenty-three music bands and musician including the likes of Bollywood singer Zubin Garg, the Tetseo Sisters, Guru Reuban Masangva, Imphal Talkies, Soulmate, Girish the Chronicle and Vinyl Records will perform during the festival to be held at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) here.\n\n“MTV will cover the event and also scout talent for its MTV Indies stage. There will be ethnic dance performances, a film festival, fashion shows and many more.\n\n“Overall, it will be a carnival atmosphere from 11 AM to 10 PM every day,” says Shyamkanu Mahanta, chief organiser of the festival.\n\nThere will also be a special performance by Bollywood singer Ash King of Meherbaan (Bang Bang), I Love You (Bodyguard) and Te Amo (Dum Maaro Dum) fame.\n\nBesides, 25 designers from the Northeast will showcase their products.\n\nAnother highlight of the festival will be the delectable ethnic food from all the eight states and various tribes and communities of the region.\n\nThere will also be an agriculture and food processing exhibition cum sale related to organic farming and floriculture and handloom and handicraft shows besides photography and art exhibitions.\n\n“The aim of the festival is to make the people of Delhi know about the Northeast,” says Mahanta.\n\nThe 8th Delhi International Art Festival to be held from October 28 to November 11 will promote the Northeast Festival, he says, adding NDMC has also agreed on putting up 40-50 hoardings about the event across the city.\n\nIcons from the northeast like champion boxers M C Mary Kom and Shiva Thapa, Bollywood actor Adil Hussain and Everest conqueror Anshu Jamsenpa among others and policy makers, intellectuals, students, investors and tour operators, are expected to attend the event, the theme of which is ‘Insurgence to Resurgence’.\n\nThe festival is organised by socio-cultural trust Trend MMS in association with the Northeast community of Delhi and IGNCA.\n\nThere will also be round-table discussions on issues of security of people from the Northeast living in Delhi, IT& ITES opportunities, education, sports, agriculture and food processing and tourism.\n\n(Guwahati, Jun 20, 2014) At a time when the country is in the grip of World Cup fever, a film brings out the inspiring tale of 40-odd girls from poor, agrarian families who are ‘bending it like Beckham’ in the hope that football will kick them out of drudgery.\n\nSoccer Queens of Rani is about the passion of these girls from Rani area near here along Assam’s border with Meghalaya. And they have to thank Hem Das, a veteran coach from here, who spends his own money to teach football to girls like them.\n\nDas had initially gone to the area in search of young boys interested in playing football, but found that more girls were in fact flocking to him to learn the sport.\n\nWhile narrating the stories of the girls, the film also captures the socio-economic life of the area they come from, thereby trying to show how fruits of modern development have not been equitably reached all the people.\n\nThe film’s subject is also important in the context of North-East India, where football is a passion and states like Manipur and Mizoram and clubs like Shillong Lajong FC have excelled on the national scene.\n\nThe documentary by critic-cum-filmmaker Utpal Borpujari is made for Rajya Sabha Television. The 26-minute film was commissioned by RSTV channel as part of a series on developmental and inspirational stories of modern India.\n\nThe girls come from poor, agrarian families from villages in the Rani area, which despite not being very far from Guwahati still lacks basic amenities like electricity.\n\nThe mother and a brother of one of the girls work in stone quarries to make ends meet. Another girl’s father digs sand from the river to earn his family’s household expenses. One of the girl’s mother pulls a hand cart and sells snacks in the weekly local market.\n\n“For these girls, football provides an outlet to go beyond their mundane lives, and as the film reveals, quite a few of them also see it as an opportunity to get a better life in the future. They walk or cycle several kilometres every day to practice football, which speaks volumes about their dedication. And they practice football in time they find after attending school and doing household chores,” says Borpujari.\n\nThe film is also about the dedication of Das, an ex-Assam player who runs the Young Star Football Coaching Club.\n\n“Das spends a major portion of his earnings in going about 20 days a month to Rani to teach football to these girls, and even buying kits for them,” says Borpujari.\n\nA number of these girls have made it to the state squads for Under-14 and Under-17 national school tournaments.\n\nThe film, apart from focusing on the story of aspirations of a bunch of young, underprivileged girls, also focuses on how individuals can play a role in giving shape to the nation’s future, even if in small ways."
