In August 2023, the winners' names were announced by filmmaker Ketan Mehta who headed the 11-member jury.\n\n“I thank God and my fans for everything. My prayers have been answered. I have a diary in which I write about my life, my dreams and my goals. After working in 'Mimi', I had penned down in my diary that I would win the national award for my performance in this film and I won it. I hope this win inspires boys and girls who watch thousands of dreams and want to make them come true\", Kriti said after winning the award.\n\nAllu Arjun has become the first Telugu actor to be honoured with Best Actor in the history of National Film Awards. He will be honoured for his outstanding performance in 'Pushpa'. Besides, R. Madhavan's 'Rocketry: The Nambi Effect' has also bagged the prestigious award for Best Feature Film. Vivek Agnihotri's 'The Kashmir Files' will be honoured with the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration.
