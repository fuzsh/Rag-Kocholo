        "text": "By Chandan Sarmah\n\nNoted film exhibitor, distributor and producer Shankar Lall Goenka, under the banner of his newly-formed film production house ‘Shiven Arts’, is going to produce an Assamese feature film based on Sahitya Akademi Award winning novel ‘Ashirbadar Rong’ by eminent writer Arun Sarma. The film will be directed by nationally-acclaimed filmmaker Jahnu Barua. Smt. Maina Goenka and Siddharth Goenka will be the co-producers of the film.\n\nThe auspicious ‘muhurat’ ceremony of the film was held on November 30 at the Kelvin Cinema Compound, Guwahati, in presence of the film unit and a host of cine-cultural dignitaries of Assam. The film will undergo shooting scheduled from the first week of January, 2013.\n\nThe title of the film, and the cast and the credit are in the process of finalization. This is for the second time that Jahnu Barua will make a film on the basis of a published literary work. The first one was ‘Halodhiya Choraye Bao Dhan Khay’, based on a much-acclaimed novel of the same name by distinguished writer-journalist and the editor of Assamese daily, ‘Amar Asom’, Homen Borgohain. The film, ‘Halodhiya Choraye Bao Dhan Khay’ (‘The Catastrophe’), fetched Jahnu Barua the National Award for Best Film in 1987, and it won four awards at the Locarno International Film Festival including the award for Best Acting, Best Direction and Best Film.\n\nA graduate in film direction from the ‘Film and Television Institute of India’, Pune, Jahnu Barua made his debut with ‘Aparoopa’ in 1982. Since then, he has so far directed 11 feature films which includes two Hindi films, ‘Apeksha’ 1982, (starring Faruque Sheikh and Suhasini Muley) and ‘Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara’ 2008, (starring Anupam Kher, Urmila Matondkar, Rajit Kapoor, etc). The film, ‘Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara’, earned rave reviews and critical acclamation, it also won a couple of international awards. Barua has so far won eight National Award which include Best Director for his much-sensitive film ‘Sagoroloi Bohu Door’ (‘Its a Long Way to the Sea’, 1996). Retrospective of Barua’s films was held in the Fukuoka Film Festival, Japan, and in a couple of other festivals abroad.\n\nA graduate in film direction from the ‘Film and Television Institute of India’, Pune, Jahnu Barua made his debut with ‘Aparoopa’ in 1982.\n\nBarua is known among the serious and meaningful film fraternity as a sensitive director who deals with the contemporary socio-political issues of Assam and the North-East. His maturity in handling acting artists deserves special mentioning because the two artists playing the role of the protagonists of two of his films won national and international awards. While Indra Bania won the Best Acting Artist Award in Locarno International Film Festival in 1987 for his superior performance in Barua’s ‘Halodhiya Choraye Bao Dhan Khay’, actress Moloya Goswami won the National Award for Best Actress for her outstanding performance in Barua’s fifth feature film ‘Firingoti’ (‘The Spark’) in 1992.\n\nJahnu Barua recently hit the headlines with his latest Assamese feature film, ‘Baandhon’, released last November. This is for the first time Barua has dealt with the issue of global terrorism and the film earned the distinction of being the Inaugural Film of the Indian Panorama section at the 42nd International Film Festival of India held at Panaji (Goa) in last November. The film was screened thrice at the festival on demand of the festival delegates and critics.\n\nIt may be mentioned here that one of the senior-most film distributors of the entire North-Eastern Region, Shankar Lall Goenka, under his established firm ‘Goenka Enterprise’, has released a number of Assamese films, such as, ‘Joymoti’, ‘Aai Kot Naai’, ‘Jibon Bator Logori’, ‘Basundhara’, ‘Azan Fakir Saheb’, ‘Ramdhenu’, ‘Rowd’, ‘Rishang’, ‘Borolar Ghor’, etc.\n\nIn 1981, he ventured into film production arena and along with R.A. Jalan of Kolkata, they jointly produced Assamese feature film ‘Manasi’ (Dir: Bolai Sen, Music Director: Ramen Barua, Starring: Biju Phukan, Bidya Rao). The Odiya version of this film was also released with the title ‘Agnipariksha’.\n\nShri Goenka formed a trust named ‘Jeewan Ram Mungi Devi Goenka Memorial Public Charitable Trust’ in memory of his late parents. This JRMDGMPC Trust has been presenting ‘Lifetime Achievement Award for Cultural Excellence’ to the unsung heroes in the cultural field of the North-Eastern Region from 2007. To add to this, the ‘JRMD Memorial Lecture’, also being organised by the JRMDGMPC Trust, is an annual event which takes place at the ‘Lifetime Achievement Award’ presentation function.\n\nThree other significant activities of the Trust were publishing the books ‘Jyotiprasad Agarwalla’ (a biography of the producer-director of the first Assamese film ‘Joymoti’ released in 1935) and ‘Heritage Shillong’ (an illustrated description of the historic buildings and monuments of Shillong), and producing an album titled ‘A Tribute to Dr.Bhupen Hazarika’ containing 14 immortal haunting melodies of Dr.Hazarika. The album has been preserved in a couple of sound archives in USA and Europe. Both the books were written by noted historian and writer Prof (Late) Dipankar Banerjee. The Trust has also taken up a scheme to publish one book every year in memory of Prof (Late) Dipankar Banerjee from 2013."
