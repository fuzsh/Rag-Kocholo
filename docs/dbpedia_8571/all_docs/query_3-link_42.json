        "text": "New Delhi: National Award-winning filmmaker Jahnu Barua, whose last film was the critically-acclaimed 'Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara', is back with his new offering a take on the 26/11 mayhem which tries to make a universal statement on peace. 'Baandhon', produced by Assam State Film (Finance & Dev) Corporation, releases in theatres across Assam tomorrow. Its cast includes some leading names from the Assamese film industry Bishnu Khargoria, Bina Patangia, Jatin Bora,\n\nZarifa Wahid and Angshuman Bhuyan. Barua has written the story and script himself while the music is scored by Dhrubajyoti Phukan. The film will open the\n\nIndian panorama section of International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa next month.\n\n\"My film is made on behalf of the common man. It is a question from the common man, comprising 80-90 per cent of the population, who has nothing to do with the functioning of the world. They like life and want to live life. They have given\n\nthe responsibility of functioning of the world to the leaders, who are supposed to take care of them. But episodes like 26/11 in which the common man has no role but is always a victim, keep on happening,\" Barua told PTI.\n\nHe is surprised that the 26/11 mayhem inspired very few filmmakers to show to the world the horror of the common man and also denounce terrorism. \"It's really a shame. Being one of the top film-making countries, we should have attempted more films. But not many people from the film-making fraternity were inspired,\" he says.\n\n\"My film is exceptional. It is perhaps the only film so far that makes a universal statement on peace,\" Barua, whose last Assamese film was \"Tora\" (2003) says.\n\nIn the film, septuagenarian couple Khargoria and Patangia arrive in Mumbai to look for their beloved grandson - the only other living member of the family who has been missing since the 26/11 terror attack. Barua has always tried through his films to deal with the people and their hopes and aspirations.\n\n\"Though I have forayed into mainstream cinema, my approach will remain the same,\" he says. His 'Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara', released in 2005, brought him critical acclaim. It also won a number of international awards. Starring Anupam Kher and Urmila Matondkar, the film deals with the disturbances in the\n\nrelationship between the father and daughter that are somehow linked to Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy. Barua, who hails from Assam, has won 10 National Film\n\nAwards and over 25 awards at international festivals. His 'Halodhiya Choraye Baodhan Khai' (Catastrophe) won the President's Swarna Kamal for the best feature film in 1987, while 'Hkhagoroloi Bohu Door' (It's a Long Way to the Sea)\n\nreceived the Swarna Kamal for best director in 1996.\n\nHis 'Firingoti' (Spark) won the second best national film award and the best actress award for Moloya Goswami. In 2003, Barua was given the Padma Shri for his contribution to cinema."
