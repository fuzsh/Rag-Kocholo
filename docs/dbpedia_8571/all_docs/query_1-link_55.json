        "text": "Rima Dasâ film Bulbul Can Sing has bagged the National Award on Friday for the Best Assamese Film. The critically acclaimed feature, in fact, also won the Best Indie Film at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) in Victoria, Australia earlier this week.\n\nSharing her excitement on the matter, the director speaks exclusively to Firstpost. Das says, “(I’m) Very happy that Bulbul Can Sing is awarded the National Film for Best Assamese Film. I am all smiles since Shah Rukh Khan broke this news here at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. Thanks to God and the universe for National Film Award for the second year in a row. May I have the strength to keep making the films that touch people’s hearts. Special thanks to my family and the team for their unwithering support and love.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBulbul Can Sing was the opening film for the night at the IFFM. SRK, the chief guest at the festival this year, has presented the film to the Australian audiences in Melbourne.\n\nHere are some snippets from the opening night at the IFFM\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRima has earlier been conferred with this honour for her 2017 film Village Rockstars , which won in the categories of Best Editing and Best Feature Film.\n\n(With inputs from Devansh Sharma)"
