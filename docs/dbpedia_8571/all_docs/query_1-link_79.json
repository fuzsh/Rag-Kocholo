        "text": "(This article may contain spoilers)\n\nSemkhor, directed by and starring Assamese actor Aimee Barua, is the first feature film in the Dimasa language. But it has sparked a furore among the Dimasa community of Assam for “misrepresenting” their customs and traditions in the film.\n\nThe film was screened at national as well as international film festivals and was awarded the Rajat Kamal at the 68th National Film Awards. It was commercially released on 23 September 2022.\n\nOne of the authors of this piece was present at the film’s screening at Delhi’s India Habitat Centre during the Habitat International Film Festival in May 2022.\n\nInformed by Dimasa friends about the screening, we were excited to watch and support a movie made in our language. By then, the trailer of the film had been circulated widely on various social media platforms.\n\nWe waited for the film with great excitement as we thought it would be telling our story, for the first time, on a bigger screen. But the film left a deep sense of betrayal for us as Dimasa viewers. We found its portrayal of Dimasa customs and traditions, prejudiced.\n\nThe film, in the director’s own words, “attempts” to capture Semkhor’s Dimasa inhabitants in their essence: their environment, their traditions and customs, and their way of life.\n\nThe dialogues and costumes in the movie seem authentic. As it was shot on location, using Dimasa actors, each scene has a veneer of authenticity. However, behind this veneer there is a great deal of misrepresentation.\n\nThe Semkhor Dimasas are shown as isolated people, hostile even to Dimasas who are residents of another village.\n\nAt the time of the mother’s cremation, the baby is buried alive by the family members. More than three scenes in the movie depict such infanticide. It is also shown that these babies are female, though it is not clear in the movie whether the community practises female infanticide only.\n\nThe protagonist (Aimee Baruah) of the film is deeply disturbed by this practice, and is compelled to go against her village, endangering her own life to save a baby from meeting such a horrific fate.\n\nTherefore, the fabricated premise of the movie is shown as a fact. During media interactions with the director, Aimee Baruah has repeatedly pointed out that this practice is part of the Semkhor Dimasas’ culture.\n\nShe has claimed that Semkhor Dimasas have shunned development interventions, and destroyed roads to prevent outsiders from entering their village.\n\nAimee Baruah further took to social media to defend the film by stating that the story is ‘completely fictional.’ She wrote on her Facebook page ‘the plotline of my film Semkhor was created on the basis of information that we collected from newspapers, books, magazines and a few individuals.’\n\nShe further claims that the attempt of her film was ‘to draw the attention to our society to the beauty of the location, the local language, the attire and so on.’ The Dimasa public remains dissatisfied with the statement made by the film-maker.\n\nThe film has taken its name from a village called Semkhor located in Dima Hasao district of Assam. The word ‘Semkhor’ comprises two Dimasa words ‘Sem’ meaning salt and ‘khor’ means well.\n\nThe people living in the village identify themselves as ‘Semsas’ and are a part of the Dimasa tribe. The Dimasas are among the few tribal communities in India (including Todas) who follow a system of double descent lineage consisting of both patrilineal and matrilineal clans. Dual descent from both the mother and the father allows women and men to have an equal position and respect in Dimasa society.\n\nSemkhor being located on the hilltop was strategically important for the British to keep an eye on the raiding tribes from neighbouring hills into tea gardens in Cachar. Ethnographer J.P. Mills had collected many photographs of Semkhor in 1927.\n\nBy the Government of India Act 1935, Dima Hasao (erstwhile North Cachar Hills) was administered as an ‘Excluded Area’ (excluded from reform and normal administration). In the post-independence period, the district was declared as Autonomous Council district – a provision provided under 6th Schedule of the Indian constitution.\n\nAnthropologist Dipali Danda’s Among the Dimasa of Assam (1977) is the first ethnographic account on Dimasas. She stated that Dimasas were very hospitable and usually entertained guests with tea. This was observed by her even in the village of Semkhor as well (p.127). No known practice of female infanticide was recorded in her study. Even today, Semkhor villagers frequented the weekly market at Maibang mainly on foot for their everyday needs by bringing their bamboo crafted products. A local politician had even built a resting place some years back at the centre of the market for the Semkhor people.\n\nSemkhor does have its share of problems, like many regions in India. According to the 2011 Census, its literacy rate is an abysmal 9.2 percent compared to 72.19 percent in Assam overall. Its child sex ratio was 880 females per thousand males, pointing to gender discrimination.\n\nIts infrastructural needs are not met. The nearest hospital is 30 km away. But the causes of these problems should not be pinned down on the Semkhor Dimasas’ alleged reluctance to change, as Baruah seems to have depicted.\n\nShe resorts to the stereotypes of backward, isolated, self-indulgent tribe while promoting her film. In her media interactions session at 52nd IFFI 2021 held in Goa, Baruah narrated a story about the “unfriendly attitude” of Semkhor inhabitants towards developmental processes such as roads, healthcare system, schools and so on.\n\nThese statements from the film-maker’s interview reeks of a ‘civilising mission,’ undertaken much like the colonial state, where the tribes were presented as primitive, dangerous and often characterised as ‘criminal tribes.’ Representation and views on Dimasas by the film-maker remains at the core of this ‘othering’ process. Thus, Semkhor continues the process of ‘othering’ of people living in the margins of society against the dominant majority as those who need to be rescued or given agency as they can’t stand up for themselves. And it is very clearly evident from the interviews of the film-maker.\n\nAs films are said to be a powerful tool in the construction of an identity, films such as Semkhor do provide a case of misrepresentation of a tribal community (in this case, the Dimasas) in the mainstream consciousness. The film failed to capture the subjective realities, does not explore the actual lifestyle and worldviews of Semkhor inhabitants.\n\n(Diksha Langthasa is a civil servant and Santosh Hasnu teaches history at a college in University of Delhi)"
