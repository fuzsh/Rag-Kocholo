        "text": "The National Film Award for Best Feature Film is one of the categories in the National Film Awards presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, the organisation set up by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in India. It is one of several awards presented for feature films and awarded with the Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal). The award is announced for films produced in a year across the country, in all Indian languages. As of 2017, the award comprises a Swarna Kamal, a certificate, and a cash prize of ₹ 2,50,000 and is presented to the producer and the director of the film.\n\nThe National Film Awards were established in 1954 to \"encourage production of the films of a high aesthetic and technical standard and educational and culture value\" and also planned to include awards for regional films.[1] The awards were instituted as \"State Awards for Films\" but were renamed to \"National Film Awards\" at the 15th National Film Awards in 1967.[2] As of 2017, the award is one of six Swarna Kamal awards presented for the feature films. The award-winning film is included at the annual International Film Festival of India. Only the films made in any Indian language and silent films which are either shot on 35 mm, in a wider gauge, or digital format but released on a film or Video/Digital format and certified by the Central Board of Film Certification as a feature film or featurette are made eligible for the award.[3]\n\nThe inaugural award was named as \"President's Gold Medal for the All India Best Feature Film\" and was awarded to Marathi film, Shyamchi Aai (Shyam's Mother), produced and directed by Pralhad Keshav Atre and is based on Pandurang Sadashiv Sane's Marathi novel of the same name.[1]\n\nAs of 2022 (2024), 69 feature films have been awarded the National Film Award for Best Feature Film:\n\nBengali 22, Malayalam 13, Hindi 12, Kannada 6, Marathi 5, Tamil 4, Assamese 2, Sanskrit 2, Gujarati 1, Beary 1 & Telugu 1. At the 26th National Film Awards (1978), no feature film was awarded with the Best Feature film award as the jury headed by filmmaker Chetan Anand scrutinised eighty films but did not consider any film to be \"worthy of merit\" and \"measured up to the standard of excellence set forth by the jury\".[4] At the 59th National Film Awards, two feature films shared the award; Marathi film Deool (Temple) and Beary film Byari.[5] Most recently, the award is presented to the film Rocketry: The Nambi Effect, directed by R. Madhavan."
