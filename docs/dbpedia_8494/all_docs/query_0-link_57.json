        "text": "Article 0\n\nThe UN Peace Keeping Hoax: Sri Lanka should not send our War Heroes to nations illegally invaded & occupied\n\nShenali D Waduge\n\nThere are 16 UN Missions currently operating with over 85,000 blue helmets. These men are serving in countries where conflicts have not arisen without a reason. Many of these conflicts have been planned and plotted by the very nations passing resolutions recommending UN Missions because these missions are only extensions of the goal to plunder and help weaken or reduce the powers of the locals over their own country. In such a scenario should we not be asking ourselves why we would want to send men to guard countries and territories where UN is stationed illegally to face death because the very countries that created the conflict end up arming both sides while sending parties to solve the problem or rather delay solving the problem. When a report by the U.S. GAO, dispatching UN peacekeepers to Haiti was eight times less expensive than fielding a comparable U.S. mission it goes to show that the nations that start trouble are happy to despatch soldiers from poorer third world countries than sending their men and highlights the hypocrisy and double standards that prevail.\n\nThe UN PeaceKeeping was created in 1948 and PeaceKeepers are led by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Its first mission was to maintain ceasefire during the 1948 Arab-Israel War.\n\nThere have been so far 69 Peacekeeping Operations, 56 of which have been since 1988 with peacekeepers from 120 countries contributing.

Notice how with each Mission they are expanding their roles – influencing law & order structures, restructuring military, drafting constitutions etc. These are all influencing the people subtly. None of the issues there were mandated to attend to have been solved except that the UN continues to add to its mandate and continue presence in countries. While UN adds to its reports and cries over its failures, instead of solving any failures it happily adds on Missions which is getting no country anywhere.\n\nWhat needs to be also said is that when taking these countries where UN Missions are currently operating in, there is a geopolitical interest for Western imperialist agendas. Many of the conflicts that have ‘necessitated’ UN involvement and fact finding missions and troops have served the imperial agendas of these western nations who have been either funding covertly and conniving the issues from behind the scenes. None of these covert and overt operations have ever been mentioned in any report or even investigated.\n\nIn the light of these realities we need to abstain from sending Sri Lanka’s war heroes to any of these Missions. Our war heroes fought fair and square and won despite plenty of covert foreign involvement too. The whole world should give special treatment to our soldiers for their achievement. They should not be induced by money more or less a bribe to be sent to these conflict zones where they are virtual guineapigs and their lives lost would be in vain for the cause is not genuine and they would be going to nations where conflicts have been illegally created to facilitate geopolitical goals of western imperial nations for whom the UN is now serving as a slave provider.\n\nOur war heroes should never be sent to any UN Peace Keeping Mission even if the inducements are lucrative.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nArticle 2\n\nMessage for C V Wigneswaran from Sinhala Youth\n\nShenali D Waduge\n\nC V Wigneswaran Chief Minister of Northern Provincial Council, one of 9 provincial councils in Sri Lanka has written ‘My Request to Sinhala Youth’. It is a pity he never chose to write anything to the Tamil youth who were taking up arms to kill innocent civilians or the LTTE who were training Tamil children to become child combatants instead of studying to educate themselves to become somebody’s in life just as how C V Wigneswaran studied at a Sinhala school, lived all his life in Colombo, went on to become a judge in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe message from the Sinhala youth to Chief Justice Wigneswaran\n\n·Please admit that it was the political issues and activities of the Tamil vellala high caste political leaders together with the LTTE who made life precarious for the people of the North and no other.\n\n·Please admit that the Tamil youth did not revolt, they were taken secretly to India under the Indira Gandhi government and trained in numerous camps in Tamil Nadu. These are detailed in the Jain Commission report. Therefore any ‘revolt’ came only after training and when these armed militants were sent back to Sri Lanka by India.\n\n·The Tamil Mayor of Jaffna Alfred Duraiappah was killed in 1975 the same year Prabakaran changed his militant group’s name from New Tamil Tigers (formed in 1972) to LTTE (1975). When LTTE leader did not even study beyond grade 8 is it the fault of the Sinhalese? When Prabakaran did not do a job his entire life is it the fault of the Sinhalese?\n\n·The rest of the world believing the lies of the separatists need to remember that separatism started in 1949 with the forming of ITAK by Chelvanayagam (translate its tamil meaning and it is separate state – the English name Federal Party was just to hoodwink the people), where was the discrimination in 1949 barely months after independence? The first victim of LTTE was a Tamil mayor, the 2ndvictim of LTTE were Tamil policemen on duty…so how can the Chief Minister refer to discriminations! These are all nothing but lies spun over the years and believed by naïve people and manipulated by people for their own agendas.\n\n·LTTE and Tamil separatism arose not because of Sinhalese but because of their own inclinations and aspirations. The Sinhalese became an easy political scapegoat. If the Tamils are angered by riots were these riots not instigated by the UNP governments? Why do the Tamils continuously vote for the UNP yet complain about the riots?\n\n·It is the country that has one identity combining the history and heritage of those who toiled to build the country. No provincial or district identity can become the country’s identity and come above that of the country’s identity. It is the island-nations identity that has to be incorporated into the Constitution not one province only.\n\n·The whole reconciliation game is a hoax and a means to fool people into abdicating their history and heritage in the false premise that they are bridging bridges. Sri Lanka’s Army fought against terrorists and terrorism not against Tamils. No country reconciles with terrorists without punishing them for destroying people and property. Sections of the Tamil political leadership cannot ride on the reconciliation bogey by trying to steal power upon themselves to fulfil their insidious agendas.\n\n·We would like to ask why the Tamil politicians objected to the 1957 Social Disabilities Act and even went to the extent of writing to the Colonial British office to plead with them to stop the act. This Act gave to Tamil low caste and poor youth the opportunity to attend school and study. The Tamil leaders today bragging about ‘our community’ and ‘our rights’ have conveniently forgotten that they objected to their own people studying and attending school and when these poor children were admitted to schools they high caste/class children and teachers forced them to sit on the floor and study. Please don’t preach forgetting facts!\n\n·We are also well aware that the whole ‘military control’ is just another Tamil propaganda stunt taking people on a guilt trip and projecting as if the military are evil and wicked people. When Justice Wigneswaran did not raise a single word to the LTTE in fear of their dear lives, it was the Sinhala soldiers who saved close to 300,000 Tamils from being shot at by the LTTE when fleeing. We have enough of the lies, distortions and fabrications by groups who are now netting themselves in their own lies because one lie leads to another bigger lie to conceal the first. C V Wigneswaran your 70 plus years life was spent mostly in Colombo amongst the Sinhalese and after living just 4 years in the North you have hardly any right to make any comments!Did you raise one objection with Prabakaran when he was forcibly taking Tamil adults and children? You did not, and if you did not you can hardly talk now! The Sinhalese people opposed the JVP when they went on a killing spree and so they have every right to have their say…. The Tamil leaders did nothing against the LTTE and the TNA manifestos have openly advocated LTTE militancy (refer 2004 and 2010 TNA manifestos)\n\n·There is no such ‘traditional homelands of the Tamil people’– there is nothing to even prove with historical evidence that the Tamil race evolved in Sri Lanka, Upto 1911 all Tamils were referred to as Malabar Tamils by the colonials. Every aspect of Tamils – language, religion, behaviors etc are all rooted to Tamil Nadu.\n\n·The standardization is another battering ram used often to fool gullible people. This system enabled people from rural areas to gain admission to university for higher education. Prior to that the high caste Tamils were privy to the best of missionary education, jobs and well secured life. This ended with the standardization which allowed poor Tamil people to gain admission as well. What is wrong with that? Without admitting this the propagandists went on a guilt trip and the authorities are faulted for not correcting the story with statistics and facts. C V Wigneswaran says that youth took up arms because of standardization in 1974 but why kill Alfred Duraiappah in 1975? Does it mean that anyone going against Tamil leaders have to get killed?\n\n·Good question by C V Wigneswaran ‘how could the unfortunate parents who had lost their dear ones accept them as incidents of the past’– please explain to the parents of every man, woman, child the LTTE killed since 1980s… this includes the many unarmed soldiers and others killed by LTTE and 5000 missing soldiers whom their brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, children mourn every day….the CM and the TNA are dutibound to explain given that they supported the LTTE and were part of the LTTE. What is the relief to these innocent people that the LTTE used by killing them to instil fear to the country and the world?Yes ‘those who have lost their loved ones have a right to expect justice and fair play’ – the people who were killed by LTTE must deserve justice before those who killed LTTE terrorists can be brought to any trial. And certainly ‘these are questions that loom large among’ ALL PEOPLE who are not supporters of LTTE or separatism.\n\n·We have some questions about treatment of the people of the South … why are you and TNA calling for the destruction of all Buddhist temples in the North, why are you forbidding Tamils to marry Sinhalese when your own sons are married to Sinhalese politically connected people too? Why have you allowed your people to destroy a Buddha statue and disfigure Buddha’s head, what is the message you are trying to convey from these vandalism? Why have buses taking pilgrims to Nagadipa been stoned, such incidents never took place before 2015 and after 2009?\n\n·All these calls for independence are coming Tamil politicians who had been living in the South amongst the Sinhalese and parachuted to the North like CV Wigneswaran and other Tamils living overseas holding foreign passports and coming to Sri Lanka only on holidays.We do not hear anything from the Tamil ordinary people calling for independence. What we cannot understand is how for over 70 years C V Wigneswaran lived without speaking a word on self-determination and no sooner he goes to live in North in 2012 all that he vomits is self-determination and homelands!\n\n·The reference to ‘united’ are oft used in confederacy which is a step towards separatism. The US gave up confederacy because it was too vulnerable to hold a country together. We should not make the same mistake.\n\n·In reference to foreign leaders coming and TNA sharing their dreams with them… we can say that we know the drill pretty well. That was how Kosovo and South Sudan were created and then the same leaders dumped the newly independent countries and now they are worse off and their dreams have turned into nightmares. We will not allow our island nation to be divided to face the same fate wherein the rest of us will have to end up dressing the wounds while the Tamil leaders who plotted all the destruction would quickly depart for foreign destinations. The same has happened in all of the newly created countries. We will not fall for these ‘right to self-determination within a united Sri Lanka’ recently Tamil youth themselves came out to say they do not want to divide the country and instead they want homes and jobs. What have you done about this? http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2016/05/02/attention-international-community-we-want-homes-not-merging-of-north-east-says-tamils/\n\n·The reference to South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission is good – what has it achieved, have the blacks got back their lands from the white occupiers. South Africa cannot be compared to Sri Lanka, South Africas case was one of apartheid where the people of South Africa were discriminated by foreigners who took over their lands and natural resources. Sri Lankas case was a non-international armed conflict with LTTE using terrorism. All the communities were targets and TNA at that time were dead scared to utter a word against the LTTE for fear of ending up like Amirthalingam and a host of other Tamil leaders.\n\n·If youth are the backbone of our country, why did the Tamil leaders including Justice Wigneswaran keep silent while LTTE were denying the fundamental rights of children and even their parents, kidnapping them and turning them into killers, handing them not books but cyanide capsules and ordering them to commit suicide if caught. Why did Wigneswaran and Tamil leaders as well as the Tamil Diaspora now quoting human rights books not tell LTTE to leave their children alone, these children never enjoyed their youth or their teenage? The only sports they did were digging underground bunkers, marshalling their way through dirty and muddy waters to escape their enemy, staying up guarding their leaders who were sleeping while they were getting bitten by mosquitos,\n\n·Was it not the Sri Lanka Army who rehabilitated these cadres and allowed them to study and pursue their goals – some of these child soldiers are today film stars and some are singers and having their own business ventures. All these facilitates were not given by LTTE, TNA, the UN or foreign governments or even Tamil Diaspora but the Sri Lankan Government and the Sri Lankan Army.\n\n·Why is the Chief Minister silent on IPKF war crimes – did the LTTE not say that 3000 Tamil women were raped by the IPKF who were garlanded by the Tamils as being their savior? Did these Indian soldiers not end up killing innocent Tamils and LTTE had to turn their guns on them when Prabakaran himself realized the foolishness of getting Indian involved and his anger was such that Prabakaran forgot the gratitude for Indira Gandhi for training him and others and assassinated her son Rajiv Gandhi in India and even the Indian intelligence failed to foil the plot! This too after Rajiv Gandhi had gifted his own bullet proof vest to Prabakaran – we can well understand why Tamil leaders like Sambanthan and even Wigneswaran would have lived in fear! They are lions now but when LTTE and Prabakaran were alive they were silent as mice!\n\n·Good that you have mentioned drugs and alcoholism – who are bringing drugs, where are they coming from – are these not coming from India and does LTTE not continue to have an illicit narcotic network running globally.\n\nChief Minister, the Sinhala youth do not need preaching’s from you unless you are willing to admit and place facts out into the open. Why do you know address Tamil Nadu leaders and complain to them about poaching on Sri Lanka’s waters and stealing profits that should come to Sri Lanka? Why don’t you demand Indian fishermen stop stealing the livelihoods of the Sri Lankan Tamil populace, why don’t you say a word against the Tamil Nadu fishermen who are destroying the marine bed of the coast belonging to Sri Lanka? You cannot be selective in your preachings! We view these Tamil Nadu incursions no different to the 17 times South India invaded our island nation and destroyed the many Buddhist temples and historical artefacts and killed many Sinhalese as well. Where is the accountability for these deaths and destructions? The ICC ruling has created cultural genocide as a war crime and all the destructions of ancient Buddhist sites by either LTTE or TNA will constitute a war crime. The late Cyril Mathew has documented these destructions well and has submitted to UNESCO in 1983.\n\nThe Sinhala Youth of Sri Lanka wish to tell the Tamil Youth to be aware of the enemies within them – the Tamil leaders who lived in the South, educated their children overseas, married their children overseas and happily stood silent while LTTE kidnapped children from remote villages where poor and low caste Tamils lived. Where are the children of Sambanthan and other bigwigs – all are living overseas! Let us also remind the Chief Minister that when the UN govt unleashed their thugs in 1983 it was the Sinhalese people who saved their Tamil friends and neighbors and this is why the Sinhalese will never accept any guilt trip to feel sorry for 1983 – the Sinhalese had nothing to do with the attacks and therefore should not be apologizing. The people who stole from Tamil homes included thugs and thieves from all communities who were happily removing items from households.\n\nThe Tamil leaders are eternally putting the reconciliation card and is asking what Sinhalese have given, we would like to in turn ask what has Tamils given to nation building prior to colonial rule and even after independence other than eternally moaning about what they have not been given.\n\nThe youth certainly have a role to play. Tamil youth must now identify the bogus politicians and other Tamil leaders living in Sri Lanka and abroad and completely shun them. Some of them need to now retire and allow the youth to take over – they have done enough damage to the country and people. The same applies to the Sinhala youth – they too must identify the bogus politicians and other Sinhala leaders who are continuing to fool the masses and completely shun them. Voters must cease voting them into power to fool the people once more.\n\nThere are smart and young leaders with vision. They must inspire others by coming forward. The system where money rules who leads and who comes to power must stop. Only people who has money to throw and buy over voters end up in Parliament. This is not a healthy democracy. Elsewhere the same trend prevails and that is why all nations of the world are in peril. None of the leaders elected are listening to the people are leading in the interests of the people except to ensure they remain in power and after them their children are propped into power. We must end this system. We are not getting anywhere with such a system. Youth of the North and South should refuse to be misled once again by the same set of evil politicians who are manipulating media and propaganda just so that they can sit and enjoy power for eternity.\n\nWe need more youth to tell all politicians are Emperor’s in clothes.\n\n↧\n\nArticle 1\n\nHuman Rights violators cannot use UN/UNHRC to determine other human rights violators or violations\n\nShenali D Waduge\n\nThe whole human rights game needs to be exposed. Human rights is being used by countries that claim to be possessing a moral high ground to point fingers. They possess no such moral high ground. Evidence is ample to show they have no rights to accuse others. Their past and present crimes deny them that right and none of their crimes have been accounted for. UN is being used to shamelessly whitewash and cover up their crimes. If UN is a body of integrity why does the UN not stop the US/NATO/EU crimes? Those with unclean and bloodsoaked hands have no moral standing whatsoever to preach and point fingers. \"Equity must come with clean hands\". A nation that possesses nuclear arsenal has no rights to complain that another country has nuclear weapons! This entire human rights hoax needs to stop until the real culprits are brought to book.\n\nColonial crimes\n\nThe era of plunder and murder began when European voyagers set sail on orders of their Kings and the Church to declare all territories and lands as ‘discovered’ and made Christian even if they were people living in them. Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Britain and later France became the initial colonial invaders and occupiers committing unacceptable human rights violations and stealing people’s nations, their peaceful life and their natural resources. The crimes of the colonial invaders have yet to be accounted for and their legacies continue still with nations grappling to solve the seeds of divide and rule tactics that besiege nations and keep them trapped in debt/interest game subjugating their development forever.\n\nWe have no exact figures of the people that these colonizers killed and the methodologies adopted to kill, but these countries continue to preach ‘accountability’ without wanting to take any accountability for their crimes but continuing to plunder these countries.\n\nThe Americas\n\nThe conquest of the Americas was exploitation. Portugal accidentally discovered Brazil in 1500. In 1549 the first Jesuits arrived to Christianize natives. Importing of Africans began with Angola the main source. According to Bradford Burns by 1822 two million slaves, Africans or their descendants, lived in Brazil where the total populations was four million people.\n\nTerry Lynn Karl contends that Latin American inequality can largely be explained by looking at how the “past [still] has its claws in the present’ the perpetual reliance on foreign investment throughout the 19th and 20thcenturies” has created a vicious cycle of inequality. The majority of Latin American countries have struggled to find their national and cultural identities, relying on Western philosophical doctrine.\n\nFunnily enough Christopher Columbus and his crimes had been whitewashed with America annually celebrating Columbus Day of a mass murderer!\n\nEstimated figures of genocide of indigenous in the Americas vary. Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas in A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies in 1552 says the indigenous population on the Spanish colony of Hispaniola had been reduced from 400,000 to 200 in a few decades.\n\nIn the late 16th century, England, France, Spain and the Netherlands launched colonization efforts in the part of North America that is now the United States. Letters of British commander Jeffery Amherst indicate that he authorized the intentional use of disease as a biological weapon against indigenous populations during the 1763 Siege of Fort Pitt. In 1837 Secretary of War Lewis Cass prohibited vaccinations. John Ehle says missionary Elizur Butler, who made the journey with one party, estimated 4,000 deaths in the famous Trail of Tears.\n\nDee Brown quotes Col. John Milton Chivington, U.S. Army\n\n“Damn any man who sympathizes with Indians! ... I have come to kill Indians, and believe it is right and honorable to use any means under God's heaven to kill Indians. ... Kill and scalp all, big and little; nits make lice”\n\n(Sandy Creek Massacre 1864)\n\nAlexander Hinton claims over 80 indigenous tribes disappeared between 1900 and 1957, and of a population of over one million during this period 80% had been killed through deculturalization, disease, or murder.\n\nAustralia-Asia\n\nThe extinction of the Tasmanian Aborigines is regarded as a classic case of genocide by Lemkin. According to Raymond Evans white settlers killed more than 10,000 Aborigines between 1824 and 1908. These white settler regarded the aborigines as ‘vermin’ and killed them as a sport!\n\nCrimes of Anglo-European nations cannot be just shoved into a corner claiming them to be crimes of the past. Even the crimes after 1945 have not been accounted for still. Nations cannot be threatened with sanctions, overthrow of their leaders and destabality because they point fingers at these perpetrators. Injustices cannot be allowed to continue just because the violators have taken every international body under their dictate.\n\nThe words of Winston Churchill are important because Britain with 8.6m people ruled over 458million people by 1922 (1/5 of the world controlling land mass of 33,700,000 km2)\n\n“We are not a young people with innocent record and a scanty inheritance.\n\nWe have engrossed to ourselves – an altogether disproportionate share of wealth and traffic of the world.\n\nWe have got all we want in territory, and our claim to be left in the unmolested enjoyment of vast and splendid possessions, mainly acquired by violence, largely maintained by force, often seem less reasonable to others than to us” –\n\nAfrica\n\nIn 1884-5, the African continent was divided among 14 countries simply by taking a pen and dividing territory to call their ‘own’ to plunder. They did not care that families and tribes were being divided. These 14 countries did not care for any of the human rights of these people. These countries together committed atrocious human rights violations while ‘whitening’ the Africans and taking them on a mentally programmed journey that would denounce their autonomy, their dress, the way they slept, prayed and replace them with Western models and value systems. In short their identity was snatched and replaced with what the West deemed was their identity. These were all violations of the very rights that these same Western countries today preaches.\n\nThe Conference met at Berlin from November 1884 through February 1885 resulted in the Berlin Act of 1885. It was attended by representatives of Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Russia, U.S.A., Portugal, Denmark, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and Turkey. King Leopold II of Belgium who ruled over Congo using mercenaries and killed millions of Congolese inhabitants, including children. .\n\nThe colonial invaders enforced their legal system, their language, their culture totally denying natives to follow their own. Having destroyed ancient civilizations these same nations are launching programs to protect and preserve ancient cultures. What a farce. 458million people were denied all rights.\n\nThe nations that committed and continue to commit mass murder, war crimes, religious and ethnic cleansing are demanding accountability from others!\n\nHow can countries that stole cultural artefacts, forcibly converted people, destroyed and plundered nations preach human rights?\n\nAnglo-European countries have done great damage to the world – to the black, brown and yellow men, women and children of the world. These nations have no conscience for their crimes that continue still.\n\nThe wealth stolen from Asia and Africa funded industry in US, Britain and Europe ushering the Industrial Revolution and Western capitalism.\n\n·What is the difference in slave trade of the past and the present refugee migration tactics adopted by bombing nations forcing people to flee their homes and beg to survive in nations that are waiting to use them as cheap labor? Britain and Portugal accounted for 70% of the African slave trade to Americas.\n\n·What is the difference in the calculated policies of divide and rule, encouraging internal conflicts by inciting communal/religious conflicts adopted then to the same policies continuing now?\n\n·Gross violations like mass rape began with colonial invaders who used it as a government policy & tactic. There are no evidence of such existing in pre-colonial eastern civilization. These very nations are bringing laws without accounting for thousands raped on their orders!\n\n·Shoot to kill policy in 1818 in Uva Wellasa then Ceylon Governor Robert Brownrigg (3rd British Governor of Ceylon from 1813 – 1820) orders to Maj. Gen. Hay MacDowell was to kill anything above 8 years and Indian sepoys were brought from India and these Indians left only in 1920 after remaining in Sri Lanka for 102 and the British Government is demanding demilitarization now!\n\n·What kind of ‘civilized’ occupiers would set fire to entire villagers and destroy crops and livestock and is this different to the 78 days Yugoslavia was subject to by NATO in 1999 purposely targeting civilian infrastructure?\n\n·What right do these western nations have to talk about human rights when they have turned rice fields into poppy plantations just to grow opium?\n\n·Today, a well-funded campaign is out to remove the perahera elephants citing torture – how many knew that Samuel Baker headed the elephant slaughter killing 30-40 elephants on a daily basis, for the British killing elephants was a sport in Sri Lanka.\n\n·The British have no moral ground to be dictating human rights – they have ‘roasted’ Kenyans alive, they have beaten natives dead, British troops enjoyed breakfast watching natives being hung, they have kept natives with snakes and scorpions, they have created special tools to crush testicles of natives, they have used pliers to mutilate women’s breasts, they have rolled men around barbed wire, any natives resisting white settlers were roasted alive! Barak Obama’s own father had his testicles squeezed between metal rods!\n\n·What is the difference in the inquisition tortures used by the Church, anally raping men using knives, broken bottles and rifle barrels and the waterboarding and other CIA tortures presently being used at secret detention camps which UN does nothing again?\n\n·How can countries that denied the right to worship for Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims and built Churches on top of these religious sites now be champions of religious freedoms?\n\n·How can countries that have depopulated nations have any right to be talking on behalf of humans – Diego Garcia is one recent example of the flouting of human rights that continue.\n\n·How can nations that have killed unarmed civilians – example 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, 10,000 killed in 1818 Uva Wellassa, Ceylon have any right to bring any resolutions on unarmed civilians getting killed?\n\n·How can nations that stole land, plundered land and profited from plundered and stolen lands be asking other nations to entertain homeland theories just because they want to extend imperialism in these newly created states! Wasteland Ordinance 1840 gave British to take every piece of land to cultivate and as a result wildlife started to perish, cattle died, elephants had to migrate.\n\n·What is the difference in Churchill’s crimes receiving a Nobel Prize in 1953 and the Nobel Peace Prize given to Obama – they all end up congratulating each other for their crimes and arranging award ceremonies for each other.\n\n“The Blood Never Dried” is recommended reading for people to realize the extent of the crimes committed by the British Empire and these crimes are archived and kept hidden and some evidence have even been burnt while the Foreign & Commonwealth Office has even lied that such records do not exist.\n\nAll former colonies must demand restitution – Britain, Portugal the Dutch and all other colonial invaders must atone for their sins before they preach human rights. If the Israeli’s can continue to demand compensation for the holocaust and countries are continuing to pay why cant the former colonial occupiers do the same?\n\nIf international conventions and human rights statutes drafted by these very violators recognize without qualification that a victim is entitled to a remedy, reparation for harm inflicted then all former colonial invaders and present invading occupiers must pay for their crimes. The Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Ralph Gonsalves even declared at the UN General Assembly that the European nations must pay for their misdeeds and crimes.\n\nEvery crime – physical, psychological, political, cultural, educational, economical, social, historical and many more have been committed in the past by the same countries that are committing virtually the same sets of crimes in the present while hiding behind a charade of being the custodians and champions of human rights.\n\nThis farce and hoax cannot go on. People are unnecessarily dying and getting killed, entire countries are getting environmentally poisoned, natural resources are being stolen from a nation and put into corporate private hands – the Nestle CEO now says water is not a human right. Who is he to say water is not a human right and justify its privatization?\n\n744millon in EU, 34m in Canada, 313.9m in the UN are conniving together using the UN and international laws created for their own benefit and advantage to reign over 1.1billion Africans, 4.3billion Asians and 599million Latin Americans. We must not bow down to these bullies.\n\nIt’s time the Third World stood up and demand international investigations on colonial crimes not by the violators but by a jury comprising members of victim nations.\n\n·What was excused as ‘civilizing the uncivilized’ then has now become ‘liberating from dictators and delivering democracy now’\n\n·What was invasions and occupations of ‘discovered’ nations (though these were very much inhabited by people) has now become ‘R2P – military interventions / humanitarian interventions’\n\n·The sword and gun used then has now been replaced with drones in countries that not many in the world would make a noise about while in others where people are more informed it is the human rights lackeys and their lying machine of reports.\n\n·The missionaries that came to Christianize and dilute the Native value & cultural systems are today replaced by Christian NGOs and Christian human rights activists whose objectives are clearly seen in their vision/mission statements. Just take the top human rights charities and see – “World Vision is a Christian humanitarian organization” http://www.worldvision.org/about-us#sthash.Yz1ksfUp.dpuf” / “Christian Aid is a Christian organisation http://www.christianaid.org.uk/aboutus/who/aims/our_aims.aspx/ “The Salvation Army is an integral part of the Christian Church”http://www.salvationarmy.org/ihq/about /\n\n·What is the difference in the Viceroys and Governors that ruled invaded nations and the team of US/NATO & UN officials that dictate to nations that have been craftily brought under the UN ‘protection’.\n\n·What is the difference in the Colonial Office Administration by invading nations and the UN Peace Missions in countries which are of geopolitical interest to the West which uses the UN to advance their agendas?\n\n·What is the difference in the same nations that currently make up US/NATO members destroying destroying nations to the manner they have destroyed native civilizations and states in Latin America. Where is the accountability for the crimes against the Aztecs, Incas and the Mayas?\n\n·What is the difference in the manner that these native populations were infected with disease resulting in upto 90% of the population of Latin America getting killed and the US/NATO forces using banned chemicals and dropping bombs on civilian targets in over 37 victim nations since 1945 and brushing the killings as collateral damage or getting the UN to whitewash these crimes?\n\n·What is the difference in the genocidal policies adopted by colonial invaders and the manner that US/NATO have killed millions with their interventions, secret wars, covert & overt operations, creation, funding and training of armed militants unleashed upon countries that imperial West wish to devour since 1945?\n\nFor the argument let’s put all past crimes aside and take the past 2 decades only. What has been done about the war crimes and lies against Yugoslavia that resulted in its balkanization and the creation of independent states? Kosovo is in a state of poverty and all of the countries and persons cheering for independence have deserted Kosovo after they established what they wanted – a military base to attack Russia. What has been done about the foreign mercenaries in that collaborated in the mass murders in Rwanda?\n\n9/11 remains the world’s biggest lie. Afghanistan has paid the price being attacked without evidence or investigation and there are now 2.5m Afghan refugees.\n\nIraq was invaded on lies. Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 and Iraq continues to be occupied on lies. Saddam Hussein was publicly hanged for no reason. There are now over 3million displaced Iraqis. Was this not why an Iraqi journalist threw his shoe at George Bush no different to the naval rating who went to hit Rajiv Gandhi following the Indo-Lanka Accord in 1987.\n\nGaddafi of Libya was killed for no reason. The developed Libya is now in a state of ruin thanks to US & NATO and the mercenaries they have unleashed. In the US the House of Representatives have voted to enable victims of 9/11 to file charges against Saudi Arabia, we now hear that the US President plans to use his veto powers to deny this right.\n\nThe findings of the European Scientific Institute concludes the 9/11 took place as a result of a controlled demolition and not the planes as was presented to the world. If so the US government, European allies, the media and all those party to invading Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya are accountable.\n\n“The US, Turkey, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and European Union NATO allies and other [Persian] Gulf state allies in the region have been absolutely decimating Syria,” says Scott Rickard a former US intelligence officer. UN is even approving resolutions against Syria. UN will approve any resolution forwarded by US, NATO and EU members only.\n\nThese same countries are bringing hate speech and religious accusations against countries but little is said about more than half of British mosques being attacked. It was only yesterday that a mosque was attacked in the US while today a Muslim woman has been set on fire by Americans in New York City. http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/09/13/484475/US-Muslim-NYC-Nemariq-Alhinai\n\nNow the theatre of war is Syria soon to shift to Iran and thereafter to North Korea enroute to China and Russia.

Every parent knows that you do not reward bad behaviour with a gift. Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran presented the infamous Genocide Resolution to the Northern Provincial Council and then handed it over to a visiting senior UN political official. He was rewarded for that move with the kind of meeting that no Sovereign State arranges between the UN Secretary General and the Chief Minister of a restive border province, in which a truculent separatist psyche is far from dead.\n\nThe TNA’s Sampanthan told the UNSG that he expected the emerging Constitution to provide a political solution to the Tamils, based on the right of self-determination. The SL Government has signalled that a certain province, its elected council and Chief Minister can have political relations with the United Nations. This feeds dangerous delusions of independent statehood.\n\nThe outgoing UNSG called for a reduction of the military presence in the North. Such a remark is way outside his mandate, but there was no one from the Government to gently point that out. He went off script and bracketed Sri Lanka with Rwanda and Bosnia in his speech in Colombo, and there was no contradiction or objection from the Government of Sri Lanka.\n\nThese awful trends will crystallise in the new Constitution. The TNA insists that the new Constitution reflects the “multi-national” character of Sri Lanka. There is a huge difference between the recognition of the multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-lingual and multi-cultural, i.e. pluralist character of Sri Lanka, as the Indo-Lanka Accord and the ensuing 13th Amendment rightly did, and recognition of an alleged “multi-national” character of Sri Lanka. India does not define itself as multi-national because it has suffered the results of the “two nation theory”—bloody partition.\n\n“Multi-national” allows communities in Sri Lanka to call for the recognition of the right of national self-determination, initially prefaced with the adjective “internal”.\n\nThis will result, down the road, in a call for a referendum in the North (Or the North and East) on federalism or an even an independent State itself.\n\nThe demographic reality of an island on which almost two-thirds of the population belong to one ethno-lingual community, renders it impossible to classify as multinational--which implies communities of roughly comparable size.\n\nThe Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and Malays of this island are variously national minorities or minority nationalities. If the Tamils are/need/want a nation, that be way over in Tamil Nadu, India, baby.\n\nThe TNA eschews the term ‘unitary’, and pushes for a system in which the ‘centre’ i.e. the Sri Lankan State is limited to keeping the island together by wielding only those powers, which relate to managing the country’s interaction with the rest of the world, while all other powers are devolved to “regions” (e.g. a re-merged North and East).\n\nThe Tamil people already have an arrangement of this sort -in Tamil Nadu. There is no logic by which an ethnic community, which is one and a half million strong in two strategically sensitive border regions of a small island, should enjoy the same quasi-federal powers that eighty million Tamils enjoy in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe TNA urges “shared sovereignty” among the “peoples” of Sri Lanka, while our Republic rightly regards sovereignty as indivisible and flowing from the Sri Lankan people as a whole, not “peoples” (ethnic communities).\n\nThe island of Sri Lanka has only one neighbour and that’s to its North. The North of Sri Lanka with a\n\nmillion Tamils is only 18 miles away from Tamil Nadu, which has 80 million ethnic Tamils.\n\nThe Southern two thirds of Sri Lanka has no neighbours, no co-ethnics, no adjacent co-religionists, and no speakers of the same language. The geopolitical realities faced by the Sinhalese, including their exceptional collective situation and consequently exceptional vulnerability, require a strong State with a strong centre i.e. precisely a Unitary State.\n\nThe TNA-Tamil Diaspora-UNP project is a frail, minimalist State with a weak centre.\n\nBut just when you think it’s all going south—in this case, north – something good and important happens. A man or woman stands up and strides forward. A book appears. Society rallies. The retreat stops, the fight-back starts.\n\nCan a book save a nation? World history says yes. The most important book on Sri Lankan matters authored by a Sri Lankan and published here or abroad in my lifetime of reading, appeared on September 6th. It was as a pair: a Sinhala original (The author has a gift of verbal and literary expression in Sinhala) and an English language version, which reads easily and arrestingly. The launch was one of the most impressive, indelibly memorable and emotive events that I have attended in a lifetime of attending public events. It may turn out to be a true social “tipping point”, where the tide of public opinion turned.\n\nI refer to Major General Kamal Gunaratne’s Road to Nandikadal (The Sinhala original is Ranamaga Ossey Nandikadal),and the event was the book-launch at Ananda College with an overflow crowd of well-dressed invitees constituting the elite of the generation that fought and won the Long War in the military and non-military (Political, administrative, diplomatic, ideological and legal) battlefields.\n\nThis patriotic elite has been overthrown and replaced by the puppet elite, the elite of the unworthy, the collaborator elite, the ‘ancien regime’ of appeasers and cowards (With the exception of Field Marshal Fonseka). As Gen. Gunaratne unflinchingly testifies:\n\n“During his lifetime, Prabhakaran had the power and capability to get almost all the leaders of Sri Lanka, such as Presidents J.R. Jayewardene, R. Premadasa, Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, with the exception of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, to kneel before him…Each of these the times, the Army was shackled and embarrassed in society which hurt us deeply. During the peace process initiated by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, it was no different and perhaps the worst.”(Road to Nandikadal, Maj. Gen. Kamal Gunaratne, Pp. 8, 463)\n\nThis is the book of our time, the true history of our times, a text to be treasured. A harrowingly authentic first person narrative, it is also a Great Chronicle.\n\nWith this literary long-range artillery, Major General Kamal Gunaratne has recaptured the most valuable strategic real estate: the moral high ground.\n\nRoad to Nandikadal should be in every Sri Lankan home and in the possession of every Lankan family here and overseas. Every library—municipal or school—should have copies. It should be a prize book at school prize-givings and a birthday gift. The author should be invited to speak at schools and civic associations. Anyone who wants the truth of our times to be known and transmitted down the generations and across borders, must buy, read and gift this book.\n\nAnanda College was the product of the patriotic Buddhist revival under colonialism, while this massive tome is a chronicle of the cycles within the great cycle of the fall, revival and rise of the nation. Naow the cycle is being repeated.\n\nThe assembly of the organic yet modern elite at the event, the re-invocation of heritage and tapping of the well-springs of patriotic discourse; the solidarity that Ananda College showed Gen. Gunaratne, whose book launch was shunned by the State institutions, which are disowning the war and the warriors; the example shown by this solitary soldier in exchanging his T-56 for a computer keyboard and taking the fight to the enemy in the “war of ideas” instead of surrendering to a silent retirement, may mark a new revivalism of the nation’s sagging spirit in these warped, wretched times of self-abasement and disgrace.\n\n↧\n\nArticle 0\n\nThe Human Rights Lackeys: NGOs-Civil Society-Rights Activists Partners in Crime with Human Rights Violators\n\nShenali D Waduge\n\nThe crimes of the recent present have all been facilitated or complimented by groups of people known as NGOs, human rights activists, civil society together with mainstream media all of whom claim to be ‘unbiased’ ‘transparent’ ‘deeply concerned about the truth’ and on a mission to deliver ‘justice’. A little further investigation on who funds them, who appoints them and who sets their mandate expose the phoneys that they are and the duplicitous reports they produce, all with the ultimate aim to support the crimes of US, EU, NATO which are ably covered up and assisted by their stooges in the UN and its associate bodies. What is frightening is that the local lackeys have been artfully positioned in both government and non-governmental roles both working in cahoots to transfer the sovereign powers and the sovereignty of Sri Lanka to UN vassals. We will soon become their success story for the first remote-controlled island nation in Asia.\n\nEva Bartlett has listed “the known HR front people and groups with links to the US State Department and criminals like George Soros).”\n\n1. Avaaz: “Avaaz is an online lobby organization founded in 2007 by Jeremy Heimans (now CEO of Purpose) and others. Start-up funding was provided by George Soros’ foundation. …they have been prominent in promoting neoliberal foreign policies in keeping with the U.S. State Department.…Avaaz very actively promoted a No Fly Zone in Libya. They are now very actively promoting the same for Syria. “Avaaz is the operational name of “Global Engagement and Organizing Fund,” a non-profit organization legally incorporated in 2006. Avaaz was founded by Res Publica, described as a global civic advocacy group, and Moveon.org, “an online community that has pioneered internet advocacy in the United States.”…The silent voice behind Avaaz, that of Res Publica, is, in the public realm, essentially comprised of 3 key individuals: Tom Perriello, a pro-war (former) U.S. Representative who describes himself as a social entrepreneur, Ricken Patel, consultant to many of the most powerful entities on Earth and the long-time associate of Perriello, and Tom Pravda, a member of the UK Diplomatic Service who serves as a consultant to the U.S. State Department….In addition to receiving funding from the Open Society Institute, Avaaz has publicly cited the Open Society Institute as their foundation partner. This admission by founder Ricken Patel is found on the www.soros.orgwebsite. The Open Society Institute (renamed in 2011 to Open Society Foundations) is a private operating and grant making foundation founded by George Soros, who remains the chair.\n\n2. Amnesty International: “Amnesty does take money from both governments and corporate-financier interests, one of the most notorious of which, Open Society, is headed by convicted financial criminal George Soros (whose Open Society also funds Human Rights Watch and a myriad of other “human rights” advocates). Suzanne Nossel, Executive Director of Amnesty International USA, for instance was drawn directly from the US State Department…Amnesty International’s website specifically mentions Nossel’s role behind US State Department-backed UN resolutions regarding Iran, Syria, Libya, and Cote d’Ivoire… Nossel’s “contributions” then are simply to dress up naked military aggression and the pursuit of global corporate-financier hegemony with the pretense of “human rights” advocacy.” [citation from: Amnesty International is US State Department Propaganda] Amnesty International has even accepted money from LTTE fronts!\n\n3. Human Rights Watch: “Human Rights Watch (HRW) is an integral part of the West’s propaganda machine. HRW shapes the narratives of conflicts, narratives which become solidified through repetition, and which eventually become regarded as undeniable facts. Moreover, the language HRW employs, far from being simply stylistic choices, is deliberately utilized to obscure the reality of war zones in the service of the Empire. This is undoubtedly the case with the Israel/Palestine conflict where Israeli actions are never outright war crimes, while Palestinian ones are. It is equally true of Ukraine. This is also the case in Libya, Syria, and Venezuela, countries where HRW has played a critical role in constructing narratives in the interests of its financier and corporate paymasters, not to mention of course the US foreign policy agenda. In both Libya and Syria, HRW has played a critical role in propagandizing the western public against the governments of those countries, thereby justifying the imperialist assault on them. More than simply “collecting the facts,” HRW cobbled together a completely distorted, and in many cases utterly dishonest and factually wrong, narrative which has buttressed the case for “intervention” in Syria, as it did in Libya….Human Rights Watch is undeniably an appendage of US foreign policy. It is in many ways part of the “soft power” arm of US power projection, a means of delegitimizing, demonizing, and otherwise destabilizing countries that do not play ball with the US.”[citation from: HRW: Human Rights Watch or Hypocrites Representing Washington (Part 2)] George Soros has provided $100 million in funding for HRW.\n\n4. Ken Roth: “Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, has been vocal in his support for a full scale war on Syria in the name of humanitarianism. Roth has repeatedly called for intervention against the legal government of Syria, having recently tweeted statements such as “Like Sarajevo, could Douma market slaughter finally force Assad to stop targeting civilians?” (@KenRoth, Aug 16). The implication of the statement is quite clear: there should be military intervention, such as the US-NATO war on Yugoslavia and later Serbia, in order to stop the “slaughter” of civilians. It should be noted that this tweet was posted within hours of the news of the incident in Douma long before any investigation. Roth, and by extension his organization Human Rights Watch, further discredits whatever vestiges of impartiality he and HRW might have had with inane tweets such as “Douma market killings show how Assad chooses to fight this war: deliberately against civilians,” (@KenRoth, Aug 16), an obviously biased, and utterly unsubstantiated allegation. Roth could have absolutely no knowledge of either the identities of the dead, or the Syrian government’s motives, when he released the tweet the same day as the attack. He reveals himself here to be little more than a lackey for imperialism, a war hawk masquerading as a human rights defender.” [citation from: The Douma Market Attack: a Fabricated Pretext for Intervention?]\n\n“Last week we found that Human Rights Watch director Kenneth Roth used an image of destruction in Gaza caused by Israel to accuse the Syrian government of indiscriminate use of “barrel bombs”. We wrote: “This is thereby at least the third time HRW is using a wrongly attributed pictures to depict current enemies of U.S. imperialismas having causing the damage the U.S. empire and/or its friends have caused.That is not mere bias by HRW. It is willful fraud.”[citation from: HRW’s Kenneth Roth Continues Unfounded Accusations With Another False Picture] HRW boss Ken Roth argues for bombing in Syria, while director Tom Malinowski supports illegal torture renditions.\n\n5. Medecins Sans Frontiers/Doctors Without Borders: “Doctors Without Borders is fully funded by the very same corporate financier interests behind Wall Street and London’s collective foreign policy, including regime change in Syria and neighboring Iran. Doctors Without Borders’ own annual report (2010 report can be accessed here), includes as financial donors, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Google, Microsoft, Bloomberg, Mitt Romney’s Bain Capital, and a myriad of other corporate-financier interests. Doctors Without Borders also features bankers upon its Board of Advisers including Elizabeth Beshel Robinson of Goldman Sachs. Complicating further Doctors Without Borders so-called “independent” and “aid” claims is the fact that their medical facilities are set up in terrorist held regionsof Syria, especially along Syria’s northern border with NATO-member Turkey. In an interview with NPR, Doctors Without Borders’ Stephen Cornish revealed the nature of his organization’s involvement in the Syrian conflict, where he explains that aid is being sent to regions outside of the Syrian government’s control, and that his organization is in fact setting up facilities in these areas….In other words, the Wall Street-funded organization is providing support for militants armed and funded by the West and its regional allies, most of whom are revealed to be foreign fighters, affiliated with or directly belonging to Al Qaeda and its defacto political wing, the Muslim Brotherhood. This so-called “international aid” organization is in actuality yet another cog in the covert military machine being turned against Syria and serves the role as a medical battalion.” [citation from: “Doctors” Behind Syrian Chemical Weapons Claims are Aiding Terrorists]\n\nEva has also advised that anyone seeking truth must investigate the funding sources of organizations claiming to be ‘reporting the truth’ and in particular those funded by the USAID (through US Congress) and its off-shoots National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and the International Republican Institute (IRI) whom are claimed to be all fronts of the CIA and are used for regime change, illegal foreign intervention and help to bring out ‘rainbow revolutions’. Eva says ” these “NGOs” are in the shadows orchestrating the chaos.” Allen Weintein, one of the founders of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) explained to the Washington Post in 1991, \"A lot of what we do now was done covertly by the CIA 25 years ago.”\n\nWhat more needs to be said when Lawrence Wilkerson, the former Chief of Staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, “We do this through surrogates and nongovernmental organizationand through people who are less suspecting of the evil that may lurk behind their actions than perhaps they were before. Have we learned some lessons in that regard? You bet! Do we do it better? You bet? Is it still just as heinous as it has always been? You bet!”\n\nWhat the CIA did in the past is done by the USAID in the present!\n\nStudent leaders of the Serbian youth group Otpor who played a key role in the 2000 ousting of Slobodan Milosevic met 7 to 10 times with officials from USAID affiliates, according to the NY Times. The same group also received several hundred thousand dollars for demonstration material, t-shirts and stickers. We can well guess who funded the 6% t-shirts during the run up to the Presidential elections in Sri Lanka.\n\nDeclassified documents through Freedom of Information Acts show USAID affiliates NDI and IRI were awarded $500,000 each for campaigns in schools in Venezuela – the same is currently taking place across Sri Lanka. USAID is heavily involved in the Sri Lanka Bar Association and we should be alert to the manner the Bar Association is being used to undermine the authority of Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court. Another example of abdicating the country’s power to Geneva. It is shameful that Sri Lanka’s legal fraternity are bowing down to becoming puppets without protecting the nation. http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=151991\n\nOver the past two decades, USAID has spent 9 billion dollars promoting Washington’s democracy initiatives.\n\nIn addition to USAID and NED involved in ‘democracy promotion business’ are a net of others - National Democratic Institute (NDI), the International Republican Institute (IRI), the American Center for International Labor, the Center for International Private Enterprise and Freedom House just to name a handful.\n\nThe USAID has implemented so called democracy promotion initiatives in over 100 countries in the past 25 years\n\n·DuPont and USAID in food security deal (Africa)\n\n·USAID hunger games in Ethiopia\n\n·USAID lies on developing schools in Afghanistan https://www.buzzfeed.com/azmatkhan/the-big-lie-that-helped-justify-americas-war-in-afghanistan?utm_term=.ccdbn07kww#.taLmXjM411\n\n·Organizations Funded Directly by George Soros and his Open Society Foundations http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=1237– International Crisis Group (eternally producing reports against Sri Lanka), Institute for Policy Studies, Human Rights Watch, Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, Amnesty International,\n\n·Hungarian PM Victor Orban says the EU migrant crisis was engineered by George Soros http://21stcenturywire.com/2015/10/31/crisis-by-design-hungarian-pm-reveals-social-engineering-role-of-george-soros-in-eu-refugee-run/\n\nIn Sri Lanka\n\n·In 2014 USAID funded a controversial ‘voter education project’. 2015 election was its outcome!

In doing so the cracks will surface to reveal that their mouths open for dollars and pounds put in!\n\nLooking at the patterns it is does not take rocket science to guess the reasons for the changes taking place in Sri Lanka – in the executive, the legislature, the judiciary, law & order, administrative mechanisms, public service structure, provincial council structure – every area has been replaced with a local lackey following orders of foreign-government funded NGOs who are dictating where and how the changes should take place. Our people are fools to be fighting to come into political power for very soon politicians of every political party will have no place in Sri Lanka. Currently they are being paid and cheered on to make the changes these foreign parties require to grasp power to their hands. Once that is done we will end up a nation in peril and enslaved. Do we have hope – only if we can get our act together and get rid of the lackeys!\n\nThere are few Ron Paul’s around - Congressman Ron Paul once wrote \"It is particularly Orwellian to call US manipulation of foreign elections 'promoting democracy.' How would we Americans feel if for example the Chinese arrived with millions of dollars to support certain candidates deemed friendly to China?\" China and Russia must get into action.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nArticle 0\n\nQuestions to UNSG/UNHRC: Who killed 6261 soldiers during the final phase – LTTE or Tamil Civilians or Others?\n\nShenali D Waduge\n\nDuring the last few months before the end of the LTTE ground force there were 3 players inside the theatre of war – the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, the LTTE and Tamil civilians and the possibility of South Indians also fighting needs to be ascertained? We know that 6261 soldiers died between 2006 and May 2009, we know that close to 300,000 people were saved, we are told that a figure between 40,000 to 200,000 had been killed whom accusers say are ‘civilians’. All these figures are confusing but we need to know how many were LTTE and how many can claim to be civilians and how credible is the evidence of the accusers.\n\nSri Lanka Military records reveal that 6261 soldiers died during the last phase of the conflict (Eelam IV). Their details – names, date killed are all available. How they got killed and more importantly who killed them is never answered. They had to have been killed by either of the 2 other parties inside the theatre of war – the LTTE or Tamil Civilians. However we also know that the LTTE had an auxiliary force called the “Makkal Padai” comprising 2 branches (Eelapadai & Gramapadai). These units blurred the distinction of who was a civilian and who was not – at least 10,000 of the Tamils claiming to be ‘civilians’ were trained as combatants and are automatically denied civilian status.\n\nEelapadai– comprised 5000 volunteer civilians who were homeguards and later used during the final conflict. They were on LTTE payroll.\n\nGramapadai– comprised 5000 civilians who fought alongside LTTE and helped resist Army advances to LTTE dominated areas. They helped LTTE logistics and also took part in the final conflict.\n\nTherefore, all those who turned up at the Army civilian medical centres and IDP receiving points (between Jan-May2009) cannot be categorized as Civilians – they may have been LTTE in civil or civilians who were part of the LTTE auxiliary force.\n\nWhat is confusing the scenario further is the question of whether South Indian illegals also fought on side of the LTTE. We know for certain that illegals from Tamil Nadu were consistently arriving in Sri Lanka which is why we cannot make sense of the population and the births and deaths do not match as a result. Since 1981 proper census was not done. Most of the officials in the North were under LTTE influence. People on state payroll were also working part time for the LTTE. Others were too scared of LTTE and in such a scenario doctoring of figures by the grama sevaka and the AGA to suit LTTE cannot be ruled out.\n\nThis is confirmed by UTHR (J) report that gramasevakas of Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu were working very closely with LTTE.\n\n“From the 1990s the LTTE has used the headmen under its control to police the people, force them to attend demonstrations, perform compulsory military service as auxiliaries, impose punitive cuts of rations, diddle government aid and report on those coming in and going out...”\n\nHuman Rights Watch report reiterates this further (Feb 2009)\n\n“They [the LTTE] got the lists of IDPs from the GS [grama sevaka, a village official] – every family had to register there – and then visited every family several times. If anybody tried to hide their sons and daughters, they would come back at night and search the house”\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapakse informed that since July 2006 battle at Mavil Aru, 6,261 soldiers died, 29,551 were wounded (Gotabaya Rajapakse) & 22,000 LTTE killed\n\nAs of 19 May 2009 we need to know\n\nKilled\n\nInjured\n\nAlive\n\nSoldiers\n\nLTTE in uniforms\n\nLTTE in civilian clothing\n\nCivilians engaged in combat\n\nCivilians not trained by LTTE\n\nLTTE family members\n\nSouth Indians fighting for LTTE\n\nSet against this we need to know how many escaped to government areas and away from LTTE and categorize them as civilians with no military training, civilians with military training, LTTE cadres in civil, others (illegal Indians) and LTTE families. We also need to establish how many Tamils were shot and killed by LTTE and how many were shot and injured by LTTE.\n\nWe also need to know how many of the above died naturally.\n\nThe numbers do not add up.\n\nThe LTTE\n\nLed by Prabakaran, we know that LTTE had combatants in uniform as well as combatants who fought in civilian clothing. What we do not know is how many were in uniform and how many were in civilian clothing or how many in uniform changed to civilian clothing before the fight came to a close. No one especially the people calling for accountability seems to want to even answer this very basic question.\n\nWhat we need to know is\n\n·How many LTTE cadres were in uniform during the final stage\n\n·How many LTTE cadres fought in civilian clothing & died in combat\n\n·How many LTTE cadres fought in civilian clothing were injured\n\n·How many LTTE cadres in uniform were injured (we also know that LTTE put injured cadres into buses and blew them up)\n\n·How many LTTE cadres in civilian clothing surrendered (we know that close to 12,000 LTTE cadres who surrendered were in civilian clothing)\n\n·How many LTTE cadres in uniform surrendered\n\nThe Tamil Civilians\n\n·We know that the LTTE had trained civilians in armed combat – what we do not know is how many among the 300,000 received such training and how many were sent to combat and died as a result or were injured from LTTE firing.\n\n·We also know that during IPKF presence the Indians too trained a civilian army to compliment their stooge Varatharaja Perumal whom the Indians planned to replace by bumping off Prabakaran.\n\nWhat we need to know is\n\n·How many civilians inside the theatre of war were civilians who had no military training by the LTTE.\n\n·How many civilians had served as LTTE combatants during some stage in their life\n\n·How many civilians took active part in combat and died engaged in hostilities\n\n·How many civilians who had no training died in exchange of fire (fog of war may not determine from whose fire they died)\n\n·Only in answering above can we determine the number of civilians who died. To qualify to be a civilian they cannot have been armed or taken part in hostilities. If so, they lose their right to civilian status and thus no one can claim them as civilians being killed by the Army.\n\n·How many of the 300,000 were trained by LTTE in armed combat and would have killed our soldiers in the battlefield before they were saved?\n\n·How many of the 300,000 never held a gun or was trained by the LTTE.\n\nAccording to ICRC Rule 5. Definition of Civilian / Civilian Population\n\nThe phrase “civilian population” within the meaning of this Convention shall include all those not enlisted in any branch of the combatant services nor for the time being employed or occupied in any belligerent establishment as defined in Article 2.”\n\nThe term “belligerent establishment” is defined in Article 2 as “military, naval or air establishment, or barracks, arsenal, munition stores or factories, aerodromes or aeroplane workshops or ships of war, naval dockyards, forts, or fortifications for defensive or offensive purposes, or entrenchments”.\n\nLTTE violated the customary law principle in Article 51(7) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions by using civilians and protected spaces for military purposes thereby making those spaces legitimate targets to the opposing side. LTTE is faulted for endangering civilian lives and infrastructure as they are prohibited from using civilians.\n\nIn the light of the above how many Tamils can be termed as ‘civilian’?\n\nHow many Tamils belonged to ‘helps/contributes/advances’ the military ‘goals/objectives’ of the LTTE? (these activities include sentry duty, building bunds, bunkers, trenches, transporting military material, even carrying dead LTTE cadres) if so these Tamils cannot be given protection of ‘civilian’ under international law in a conflict.\n\nLTTE intentionally used civilians as a battlefield strategy – LTTE had an auxiliary force, LTTE used civilians as hostages, LTTE used civilians as human shields.\n\nLTTE forced the Sri Lankan Military to forego attacks on legitimate targets in order to protect civilians held by LTTE or forced the Sri Lanka Military to change tactics which resulted in troop casualties which ICRC South Asia Head in July 2009 admitted. It also forced ground commanders to weigh legitimate military objective against the injury to troops and take decisions.\n\nThe Committee Established to Review NATO Bombings in Yugoslavia made clear that the decision of the Military Commander in deciding military advantage is held above that of any human rights lawyer. Just because some say casualties could have reduced if a,b,c was adopted it does not become any war crime.\n\nThe PoE itself admits that soldiers risked their own lives, helped countless ‘civilians’ attempting to escape war zone and ended up incurring heavy troop casualties to rescue over 100,000 people.\n\nWhat is important to note is that civilian casualties in an armed conflict even significant in number does not establish any violation of international law as per doctrine of ‘proportionality’ in scenario of incidental injury and collateral damage. Such deaths though unfortunate were never intentional or planned (LTTE keeping civilians and firing from among civilians was planned and intentional)\n\nHarm to a civilian cannot automatically become illegal. Illegality comes in determining those who violated the laws of armed conflict and the principles of distinction & proportionality. Clearly LTTE violated.\n\nLet’s also not forget that the figures of dead emerged only after December 2009 after the UTHR(J) claimed “tens of thousands killed” during the final months of the conflict.Between December 2009 to December 2012 even after the PoE there was NO EVIDENCE to support the figures quoted as being killed (neither credible allegations nor credible evidence)\n\nWhat is clear is that no one can establish the actual population figures before the last phase to establish the number of dead as against the number saved and how to differentiate LTTE from civilians. Confounding the matter further is the possibility that population and LTTE cadres may be further obliterated by South Indian illegal populations and fighters too. No one has researched this aspect.\n\nWhile the propaganda networks are spinning lies and fairytales, and UN officials are doing their best to bring to the dock Sri Lanka’s military claiming the army killed civilians without touching on how many LTTE cadres were killed or making no statement on the 5000 missing soldiers, we should not allow them to get away by namecalling and slandering.\n\nWho killed our soldiers?\n\nHow many LTTE were killed and how can UN establish the 40,000 as ‘civilians’ and whether these deaths were outside of the legally accepted proportionality/collateral damage to claim as war crimes. UN cannot sling mud and start tribunals just so that their people can secure jobs every time new offices are opened. All of the UN tribunals when scrutinized reveal to be nothing by while elephants not doing any justice to the victims. Sri Lanka must refuse to be another victim of UN systematic lies and distortions.\n\nThere are plenty of loopholes in all of the UN/UNHRC reports/panels and their findings. They have opted to rely on LTTE fronts, LTTE propagandists and LTTE sympathizers for their ‘witness’ accounts. All these third party, 4thparty versions have been brought to ZERO by Maj. Gen. Kamal Gunaratne’s book – Road to Nandikal which exposes all the lies. UN / UNSG and UNHRC should feel ashamed.\n\n↧\n\nArticle 3\n\nGender equality Syndrome – Why is the Pope always a male?\n\nShenali D Waduge\n\nForeign governments need issues to send foot soldiers and need slogans to draw natives. These slogans are always initiated by Western Christian nations, their organizations and promoted through their media. Gender equality is a lucrative venture enabling setting up of NGOs, plenty of opportunities to tabulate research, channelling unquestionable funding and giving opportunity to amass public sentiment. Little do these activists question who denied gender equality for in ancient times all of the ancient civilizations treated women in higher esteem than the Church supervised empire rule, capitalist system that followed colonial rule & industrialization. These rights activists are no inventors of equality – they are perverting everything natural. Equality existed and was denied by the very nations that are today promoting equality and using these as carrot and stick methods via the UN and other global organizations upon the very nations whose equal status was removed and replaced. While many of these activists are turning their wrath to demonizing Buddhism why are they not questioning why the Pope is always a male?\n\nHow did inequality start?\n\nPaul Reuman of the Rasmussen College says\n\n“my opinion is that it started with modern organized religion, such as Christianity or the Islamic religions, before these religions were established many societies worshiped women as the bringers of life and joy to man. At some point in time, the status of women and man reversed; this did not happen overnight”\n\nHe goes on to write\n\n“Christian thinkers portrayed women as hindrances to men, who are vessels for evil and prevent man from working, studying and distract men from pursuing their relationship with God. early Christians went so far as to call women the door through which the devil enters and because women were not created by god but created from Adam’s rib women were inferior by virtue and this inferiority which makes Eve Adam’s temptress and leads to disaster (Emerson, 2006).”\n\nHe also adds\n\n“women in the Middle East and North Africa are denied some of the most basic human rights we take for granted.”\n\nIn Vedic culture, women have always been given the highest level of respect and freedom, as well as protection and safety.\n\nIn the third millennium B.C. the Sumerians accorded women a position which was almost equal to that of men. Women in ancient Egypt even had the same legal and economic rights as men - women could manage and dispose of private property, including: land. Women had the right to bring lawsuits against anyone in open court, and there was no gender-based bias against them. Women played a very integral role in the life of the Native American. They were more than just mothers of children. They were builders, warriors, farmers, and craftswomen. Their strength was essential to the survival of the tribes.\n\nThe place women held declined following foreign invaders who looked at women as objects of sexual enjoyment and exploitation, and as the spoils of war to be taken like a prize. Under Moghul rule women became further oppressed.\n\nMahatma Gandhi was to say “the way we treat our women is an indicator of our barbarism”.\n\nAbrahamic religions\n\nJudaism in the first century had emerged from the oriental patriarchal tradition in which women were considered the property of men with no rights, no role in society except childbearing, and no education. With time Hellenism added and it was in the middle of this that Christianity emerged. The primary duty of women in ancient Athens (Greece) was to marry and to bear legitimate children so that their family unit might continue. Plato’s writings limit women to traditional sex roles. Aristotle believed that inequality between men and women was based upon the law of nature (man superior – women inferior – role of women was obedience and silence) Now you can understand why women were kept in the shadows in classical Athens! According to Roman law women were under the complete control of the male head though they were allowed education and certain limited rights.\n\nWomen in the Old Testament were legally the property of men – before marriage a girl was the property of her father, after marriage she was the property of her husband. Inheritance passed from father to son. Men could initiate divorce at will. Women were bound in marital fidelity. Judaism adopted the strictest, most literal interpretations of the Torah. Women were not permitted to receive any education. Legally they were still considered the property of men. Their testimony was not accepted as evidence in court. Women were considered objects of property and spoils of war (today we have these very countries claiming rape is a genocide without accounting for the scores of women they raped as a policy)\n\nThe falsification and distortion of history by western writers can be seen in the depiction of Mary Magdalene, who has been portrayed by Christian writers as an adulteress and repentant whore. On the contrary we are now told all that was written about her are absolute lies. This is just like Christmas Day not being the birth of Jesus at all! What also needs to be made clear is that though Jesus had given equal status to women it was the Church that began denigrating women. Many denominations continue this sexist policy today by refusing leadership roles to all women.\n\nWhatever rights women had under Roman Empire was gradually removed by the Christian emperors and the Bishops.\n\n\"What is the difference whether it is in a wife or a mother, it is still Eve the temptress that we must beware of in any woman......I fail to see what use woman can be to man, if one excludes the function of bearing children.\"\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas (1225 to 1274 CE)\n\nLet your women keep silence in churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.\n\n1 Corinthians 14:34, cf. 1 Corinthians 11:3-9 and 1 Timothy 2:11-12\n\nThe historian Geoffrey Blainey wrote that women were more influential during the period of Jesus' brief ministry than they were in the next thousand years of Christianity. These were all reversals of the ancient eastern civilizations and the status they gave to women.\n\nHow can any religion talk about equality when a woman cannot become a Pope! Before anyone jumps to refer to Buddha, let it be said that everyone and anyone can attain enlightenment – it is the will and the mind that a person has to develop. There are no restrictions or regulations, only guidelines. Besides Buddha cannot be compared to Pope. The Pope is only an appointee and if so why can’t there be a women Pope. Why are activists not demanding this?\n\nThere are enough of scholarly articles to showcase the high status held by women prior to the advent of Roman dictates, the Church, colonial adventures and industrialization wherein the whole world was turned upside down and the white west dictated how every sphere of life would function under their own terms and conditions.\n\nSimilarly there is many misconceptions on the Quran’s view of women. According to the Qur'an, a woman's role on earth is not limited only to childbirth. Muslim societies have digressed to adopt conflicting traditions – some adopting to a very restrictive and overly conservative structure while others adopting a western-liberalized structure both of which do not follow original Islam.\n\nDemonizing Buddhism\n\nEvery poya, readers like to read something virtuous about Buddhist philosophy, but Christian-ruled Sri Lanka’s press deems poya day a great opportunity to demonize Buddhism so they choose writers ever willing to do so. The recently concluded poya Daily News supplement was titled “Spiritual realm knows no gender difference” by one K K S Perera. You will never find features on Christian or Islamic holidays questioning gender issues.\n\nWhat we can conclude is that societies of ancient times which did not have representative power or rule of the sword or gun enjoyed freedoms and rights and there were no need for any rights activists or NGOs. Now with democracy, systems, law & order, judicial, legislative and other mechanisms there is still need for NGOs, civil society, human rights activists and so many other nomenclatures but people still do not have freedoms however the freedoms that are being demanded and given are those that create bigger issues.\n\nOn the one hand gender equality is being promoted and at the same time homosexuality, lesbian, transgender and what not are also being promoted to such bizarre levels that are confusing children. Men are marrying men, women are marrying women – so who is the dad and who is the mum? People are having children and then getting married, experiments are being done for men to have children, all kinds of bizarre experiments are taking place – no wonder children are having psychological problems or is that also part of a plan to add more customers to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nWhen all these dumb experiments are being practiced by the white race whose populations are dwindling and are likely to make them extinct they quickly lobby to introduce them to ever gullible third world former colonies and now these ‘trends’ are catching up and totally destroying the Eastern cultures as well.\n\nA person can be inclined to be a homo/lesbian but do they need to make a show of it and make a spectacle of themselves in public, does it need to be on one’s curriculum vitae and do companies need to allocate employment for them, or does Parliament need to allocate seats for them? How is that there is a sudden spark in these gay numbers – is it not turning into a fad and a trend to be known as gay because media gives that impression? At the other spectrum you find the women’s rights demanding allocations and quotas because they are women while the same groups demand equal rights. Are we missing something here? If people are to be treated equally why should women be given allocations just because they are women?\n\nWHAT HAVE WE ACTUALLY ACHIEVED IN THE END? WHERE HAVE WE DEVELOPED – SOCIALLY, CULTURALLY, ECONOMICALLY? WHEN NONE OF US ARE REALLY HAPPY!\n\n“If nobody had money – we would all be rich”\n\n“Mother Earth has been abused, the powers have been abused, this cannot go on forever. No theory can alter that simple fact. Mother Earth will retaliate, the whole environment will retaliate, and the abusers will be eliminated. Things will come full circle, back to where they started. That’s revolution”\n\nRussell Means\n\nIt is quite clear that these slogans are all frauds just to rally people and bloated to extremes in order for the Western nations to use through the UN to twist the third world nations to do their bidding. Thus the array of gender issues, rights, freedoms all being plugged into criteria that decides whether countries get loans/grants etc while the US is paying mercenaries in Syria who are raping and killing and carrying out the most horrendous crimes but both US, UK and NATO members project themselves as guardian angels of democracy, human rights and women’s rights. Only fools will fall for the lies and hypocrisies that prevail.\n\nWe all need to return to the fundamentals and the basics without falling for all these liberal experiments introduced by thinktanks and promoted by hired lobbyists.\n\n↧\n\nArticle 2\n\nClinton E-Mail Scandal: Never wanted Sri Lanka LTTE defeated\n\nBy Daya Gamage - Asian Tribune Political Note\n\nWashington, D.C. 27 May (Asiantribune.com):\n\n\"In one of the e-mails - undoubtedly a sensitive one - disclosed because of the Freedom of Information Act law suit granted by a federal judge - Secretary of State intervened in early May 2009 to bring obstacles to the Government of Sri Lanka when it was clear to her that the Tamil Tigers were being defeated at the battle field.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's - highly impartial and non-partisan watchdog - Office of Inspector General found fault on May 25 with Hillary Clinton for the use of a private e-mail server which contained sensitive and classified material during the time she was secretary of state.\n\nThe OIG found that Clinton did not comply with the agency's policies on records in her use of private email while US secretary of state.\n\nThousands of emails that Clinton sent from the private account during her tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2012 have been made public last year as a result of Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by an investigative journalist.\n\nMost were found highly sensitive and classified one of which was connected to th"
