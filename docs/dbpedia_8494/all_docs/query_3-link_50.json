        "text": "Within the last 9 years, at least 43 journalists and media workers were either killed or disappeared. No investigation pursued – no perpetrator brought to justice.\n\nFree media movement started a campaign on 23rd November commemorating the International Day against Impunity to demand the government to bring perpetrators to justice and establish media freedom in the country. Sri Lanka is ranked 165th in World Press Freedom Index for the year 2014.Click here to see the video.\n\n1) Prageeth Eknaligoda\n\nMissing.\n\nA cartoonist, a political analyst and a journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda reportedly went missing on his way home after work on 24th January 2010, two days before the presidential polls in Sri Lanka. Immediately after the disappearance, his wife had made complaints at several Police stations and later, at the National Human Rights Commission. No perpetrator brought to justice yet.\n\n2) Dharmarathnam Sivaram\n\nkilled.\n\nThe Senior Editor of the “Tamil Net” website and a columnist to “Daily Mirror” and “Veerakesari” newspapers Dharmarathnam Sivaram a.k.a Taraki was abducted by armed men in Colombo on 28th April 2005 and his body was found next day near the Sri Lankan parliament.\n\nHe was killed allegedly by para-military operatives working with the Sri Lankan Military Intelligence.\n\nHis murder trial is pending at Colombo High Court and perpetrators are still unpunished.\n\n3) Lasantha Wickramatunga\n\nKilled.\n\nJournalist and the founding Chief Editor of the English weekly ‘The Sunday Leader’ Lasantha Wickramatunga was assassinated on 08th January 2009.\n\nHe was repeatedly shot in broad daylight by eight assailants arrived on four motorcycles who blocked his path in a busy Colombo street.\n\nThe assassination occurred in a high security zone in the capital, in close proximity to a military Airport and an Air force Base.\n\nHis murder trial is still pending at the Mount Lavinia courts.\n\n4)Sirasa attack\n\nAttacked.\n\nIn the early hours of 6 January 2009, MTV group’s main studio and transmission complex was attacked, ransacked and bombed.\n\nA heavily armed and masked gang of around 20 persons had stormed the premises, located in Pannipitiya just outside Colombo, held the night staff at gunpoint and destroyed the main control room.\n\nInvestigations revealed that a Claymore mine was used for the attack. Critics and observers linked the attack to the controversial reporting that was adopted in relation to the capture of Kilinochchi by Government Forces.\n\nThe culprits were not identified yet.\n\n5) Mylvaganam Nimalarajan\n\nKilled.\n\nJaffna based journalist Mylvaganam Nimalarajan was assassinated by gunmen in a high security zone on October 19, 2000.\n\nHe reported for various news organizations, including the BBC’s Tamil- and Sinhala-language services, Tamil language newspaper Virakesari and Sinhala language newspaper Ravaya as a freelancer.\n\nMost believe that he was murdered for his exposure of state repression in the Jaffna peninsula. He was one of the journalists who first wrote about Chemmani mass graves on the outskirts of Jaffna town where about 15 disappeared minority Tamil youth were killed and buried by the armed forces in the mid-1990s.\n\nHis murder trial is pending at Jaffna magistrate’s court. Police failed to respond to repeated requests for information regarding the status of his murder investigation and no perpetrator brought to justice yet.\n\n6)Udayan Newspaper\n\nAttacked.\n\n“Udayan” was attacked numerous times in the recent history.\n\nIn 1987, the Sri Lankan security forces attacked the Navalar Road in Jaffna, where the Uthayan offices were located, using artillery. Two Uthayan employees were injured and 40 others in the area were killed.\n\nIn 1990, the Uthayan’s offices were hit by an air raid killing one employee and injuring five.\n\non 29 August 1998 a Journalist named Velupillai Thavachelvam was attacked at his home in Sembianpattu, Vadamarachchi.\n\nIn 1999 two grenades were thrown into the newspaper’s offices, exploding near the printing machines and injuring security guard S. Selvarajah.\n\nOn 20 August 2005, two grenades were thrown into the advertising office of the Uthayan and Sudar Oli in Wellawatte.\n\nSuresh Kumar (B. G. Sahayathasan) and Ranjith Kumar, two employees of the newspaper, were killed on 2 May 2006 when armed men burst into the newspaper’s offices and opened fire indiscriminately.\n\nA delivery driver and an agent named Sathasivam Baskaran was shot dead at the wheel of his delivery truck on 15 August 2006 at Puttur junction near Achchuveli, an area controlled by the Sri Lankan military.\n\nOn 18 August 2006, a warehouse in Kopay was burnt down by armed men as a curfew was in place.\n\nArmed men entered the Uthayan offices on 7 September 2006 and ordered staff to publish a statement urging Jaffna’s students to call off their strike, threatening “severe reprisals” if the statement wasn’t published.\n\nOn 10 September 2006, two armed men who entered into the Uthayan offices were arrested by the policemen who were guarding the building.\n\nJournalist Selvarajah Rajivarnam, an Uthayan reporter for 6 months prior to his death, was shot dead in Jaffna close to a military checkpoint on 29 April 2007.\n\nA Proof reader, Vadivelu Nirmalaraj was abducted on 17 November 2007 near Jaffna as he returned home after work.\n\nA grenade was thrown into the newspaper’s office in Jaffna on 24 March 2009 causing extensive damage and injuring a security guard.\n\nOn 25 June 2009, thousands of copied of the Uthayan, Thinakkural and Valampuri were burnt in the street by armed men, after the papers had refused to print a statement against the LTTE.\n\nA Staff Correspondent of the newspaper, S. Kavitharan was attacked by a group of men on 28 May 2011 as he cycled to work.\n\nOn 29 July 2011, the same year, Uthayan’s chief news editor Gnanasundaram Kuganathan was brutally attacked as he walked home from the office in Jaffna.\n\nNagesh Pratheepan and two other Uthayan distributors were attacked and newspapers torched by four men on two motorbikes on 10 January 2013 as they were distributing them in the Valvettithurai area.\n\nThe paper’s office in Kilinochchi were attacked by a group of six masked Sinhala speaking men on 3 April 2013. Five employees were injured, two seriously, and equipment and vehicles damaged.\n\nTen days later, on 13 April 2013, three men came to the paper’s office in Jaffna and threatened security guards before damaging equipment and setting the printing press ablaze.\n\nNo investigation pursued yet.\n\n7) Subramaniam Sugirtharajan\n\nKilled.\n\nTrincomalee correspondent for Tamil daily “Sudar Oli,” Subramaniam Sugirtharajan was assassinated on 24 January 2006 in Trincomalee.\n\nHis murder trial still pending.\n\n8)Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah\n\nKilled.\n\nOwner of Jaffna Tamil daily ‘Namathu Eelanadu’ Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah was assassinated inside his house which was 300 metres inside the High Security Zone of the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) in Tellippalai in Jaffna on August 20, 2006.\n\nThe international Press institute has called in for impartial government investigation, no perpetrator brough to justice yet.\n\n9) Poddala Jayantha\n\nAssaulted.\n\nA Journalist and the Secretary of Sri Lanka Working Journalists Association (SLWJA) Poddala Jayantha was abducted and assaulted by unknown assailants on 01 June 2009.\n\nA complained was filed by his wife, no perpetrator brought to justice yet.\n\nHe was forced to leave the country having received death threats due to his refusal to speak up against threats and intimidation even after the attack.\n\n10) M. I. Rahmathulla\n\nAttacked.\n\nThe Editor and the Owner of the provincial Tamil weekly “Vaara Uraikal”, M. I. Rahmathulla was attacked on 31st March 2009 by five strangers who broke into his office. He was beaten with a cricket bat.\n\nHis case is pending at Kattankudi Magistrate’s court.\n\nHe has also filed a complained with the National Human Rights Commission but no action has been taken to date.\n\nFrom Amnesty International\n\nMedia protest, Colombo, Sri Lanka, December 2007\n\n© LankaeNews\n\n2 May 2008\n\nEnsuring respect for human rights around the world very often relies on impartial and rigorous media coverage – without exposure and public scrutiny abuses can flourish under a veil of secrecy and denial.\n\nThe importance of the media in conflict situations cannot be overstated, without reports, pictures and film of the fighting and the violence, no-one knows enough to put the pressure on the participants to ensure human rights are respected.\n\nThis need is particularly strong in Sri Lanka, where fatalities on all sides are believed to be very high with large numbers of civilians caught in the crossfire. All parties to the conflict are responsible for grave violations of human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has expressed concern that “since the start of the year civilian casualties had gone up as the number of indiscriminate attacks had grown in the north, east and south of the country.”\n\nDespite the gravity of the human cost of war, Sri Lanka is a conflict where journalists face unjustified restrictions on reporting and there are very few established facts. In fact, both sides consistently contradict each other.\n\nThe conflict in Sri Lanka is between government forces, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and armed Tamil groups alleged to be aligned with the government. Sri Lanka, as Amnesty International reported in its February report Silencing Dissent, is a country where media coverage of war has effectively been silenced – through threats, restrictions and violence.\n\nThe conflict in the north and east of Sri Lanka has continued to escalate since the ending of the ceasefire agreement on 16 January 2008. The withdrawal of the Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission responsible for monitoring the implementation of the 2002 ceasefire agreement means that there is a vacuum of independent reporting of human rights violations. This makes it more urgent that journalists are allowed to report without undue restrictions and document human rights abuses on the ground.\n\nYet journalists are often barred from conflict areas. The LTTE does not allow independent reporting in the areas under its control, while the government masks the cost of the war.\n\nAccording to the Free Media Movement, a Colombo-based media watchdog, Government of Sri Lanka officials have barred photographers in the past week from entering hospitals in Colombo where Sri Lanka Army (SLA) soldiers injured in battle in late April are being treated.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Journalists, 25 journalists from the minority Tamil community had fled the Jaffna peninsula where government forces are battling Tamil Tiger rebels.\n\nIt is two years since support staff Suresh Kumar and Rajiv Kumar were gunned down at the Jaffna-based Uthayan newspaper office on 2 May 2006. The newspaper has come under severe attack because of its alleged Tamil nationalist stance. Seven media workers have been killed in Jaffna since the beginning of May 2006, four of these working with Uthayan.\n\nGunmen on motorcycles attacked the office and killed the two workers in the absence of the journalists the gunmen were apparently looking for. The killers still walk free.\n\n“Publishing our daily newspaper in Jaffna is an increasingly Herculean and dangerous task with armed gunmen who continuously threaten our work and our lives,” said the editor of Uthayan.\n\nTo date, the organisation is unaware of any investigation that has led to the arrest and prosecution of those believed responsible for the killing of journalists and other media workers.\n\nIn another incident, journalist Jayaprakash Sittampalam Tissainayagam was arrested on 7 March and has been held in the Terrorist Investigation Division Detention centre in Colombo since. The authorities have claimed that he is held on suspicion of involvement with the LTTE, although he has not been charged with any offence.\n\nAmnesty International has said that his detention is arbitrary. He is at risk of going blind if he does not receive specialist treatment for a serious eye condition.\n\nIn all, at least 10 media workers have been unlawfully killed in Sri Lanka since the beginning of 2006. Others have been arbitrarily detained, tortured and allegedly disappeared while in the custody of security forces.\n\nFor Press Freedom Day 2008, Amnesty International has urged the Sri Lankan government to protect media workers and their rights to life, liberty and security of person, in compliance with Sri Lanka’s obligations under international law.\n\nThe organization has also called on the government to respect media workers and publicly announce that killings, threats, or other attacks will not be tolerated and to investigate all cases of attacks, disappearances and killings of media workers promptly, independently, impartially and effectively, irrespective of the identity of perpetrators or victims.\n\nThe organisation is also calling on the LTTE to issue instructions to all its members to cease all killings, threats or other attacks on media workers. All parties to the conflict must stop targeting journalists.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nCall for the protection of Sri Lankan media workers\n\nJournalists in danger in Sri Lanka (Feature, 5 February 2008)\n\nSri Lanka – Annual report 2008\n\nRead the original here and download the report in Tamil here.\n\nBolstered by military victories in the east of the country, the government of Mahinda Rajapakse, backed up by his brother, defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapakse, has vowed to inflict military defeat on the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) who have stepped up attacks on Sinhala civilians and threats against journalists whom they consider to be in cahoots with the authorities. Security forces supported by militia have sown terror in Tamil areas, carrying out many extra-judicial executions, kidnappings and threats. Despite international condemnation, the government has used the fight against terrorism to justify this “dirty war”. The Tamil press has been badly affected by this strategy that is aimed at dissuading the Tamil population from supporting the LTTE.\n\nIn the capital Colombo, the government, allied to ultra-nationalists of the right and the left, cracked down on independent press groups, closing a radio network and publications in Sinhala. Officials have made frequent statements hostile to press freedom activists and investigative journalists, forcing the best known of them, Iqbal Athas, to temporarily flee the country.\n\nAccess to conflict zones is virtually impossible for journalists and the war of words and statistics between the government and the LTTE spilled over into the press. This was the case in January when the army vaunted the success of its bombardment of an LTTE military base in Padahuthurai, eastern Sri Lanka. But the Tamil Tigers said that 15 civilians had been killed in the attack, which they claimed had not hit any military objective. Since no independent journalist was able to reach the scene, the majority of the Sinhala and English language press in Colombo carried the government account without being able to check it, while Tamil news websites and media carried news and footage put out by LTTE.\n\nThe government, ever more resistant to international pressure, refused to allow UN observers into the country and summoned several ambassadors who had expressed opinions about human rights in the country. The national human rights commission is so lacking in independence that it lost its international status in 2007. Since March it has been preventing its offices from providing information to the media on certain cases.\n\nTerror in Jaffna\n\nThe northern Jaffna Peninsula, where Tamils are in the majority and which the army directly administers, has become a nightmare for journalists, human rights activists and civilians in general. A wave of murders, kidnappings, threats and censorship has made it one of the most dangerous places in the world for the press. Two journalists were killed there during the year, two more kidnapped and at least three media have been the victims of direct attacks on them. Scores of journalists have fled the region and others have chosen to abandon the profession altogether.\n\nThe Tamil militia of the Eelam People’s Democratic Party (EPDP) who back the security forces in their fight against the LTTE, have been implicated in many violent episodes. Their leader, Douglas Devananda, is also social affairs minister. In the east, a militia formed from a group that broke away from the LTTE has sowed terror.\n\nA gunman on a motorbike killed a young reporter, Selvarajah Rajivarnam, who was riding his bike near the office of Jaffna’s biggest selling daily Uthayan at the end of April. He covered criminal cases, going into police stations and the hospital to obtain information about murders and disappearances. Several sources in Jaffna said members of the EPDP could be behind the killing. Also in April, the editor of local magazine Nilam, Chandrabose Suthaharan, was murdered at his home in the government-controlled town of Vavuniya in northern Sri Lanka. Police have failed to find the killers.\n\nTwo armed men who arrived on a motorbike burst into the home of journalism student Sahathevan Nilakshan, three kilometres from Jaffna on 2 August and shot him several times, leaving him fatally wounded. He was also a member of the management of a Tamil-language magazine Chaa’laram, linked to the student federation in Jaffna district. Another journalist, Kangarajan Prashanthan, working for the nationalist Tamil-language paper Navadu Eelandu until its closure in 2006, might easily have been killed in October but gunmen murdered his twin brother in a mistaken identity attack.\n\nTwo journalists disappeared\n\nSri Lanka holds the record for the greatest number of disappearances reported to the UN. Among them are two Jaffna journalists: Subramaniam Ramachandran, a journalist on Thinakural, who has not been seen since February after being arrested by the army; and Vadivel Nimalarajah, a sub editor on Uthayan, who was abducted from the street, after spending the night working at his office.\n\nNeither of these disappearances has been seriously investigated, despite government promises and the identification of some suspects. Similarly, the killing of two staff in a bloody attack on the offices of Uthayan in May 2006, went un-investigated by police, even though the paper’s management provided the authorities with the name of a suspect, Valluvan, a militant in the pro-government EPDP militia. However witnesses, quoted by Uthayan, saw Valluvan in 2007 in the administration offices in Jaffna.\n\nTamils deprived of independent news\n\nThroughout the year, the government and its allies have tried to block the flow of independent sources of news in Tamil. Those living in the north and east of the country, already isolated by the war, have also been gradually deprived of media not affiliated either to the government or an armed group. For their part, the LTTE increased their surveillance of Tamil journalists, threatening those who dare to criticise them openly. And the media in the areas in which they control are forced to relay the movement’s belligerent propaganda.\n\nSome staff on Uthayan live spend time holed up in their offices in the centre of Jaffna. One journalist lived there permanently in 2007 for fear of being killed in the street. “We had 120 staff, of whom 20 were journalists, before August 2006. Now there are only 55 of whom five are journalists, who are prepared to face up to the risks”, editor M. V. Kaanamylnaatha said in June when he welcomed Reporters Without Borders to his Jaffna office.\n\nUntil May the Jaffna press went through huge problems to obtain essential supplies. The regions three titles were being asphyxiated by the authorities, who from August 2006 onwards refused to allow ink and newsprint on the list of goods that could be delivered to Jaffna. Despite their growing popularity, Uthayan, Yarl Thinakural and Valampuri were forced to drastically reduce their pagination and circulation. Finally after pressure, mostly from abroad, the army lifted its embargo and stock was able to arrive from the capital by boat.\n\nThe information ministry decided on 25 October to suspend the licences of five radio stations – Sun FM, Gold FM, Hiru FM, Shaa FM and Surayan FM – belonging to the privately-owned Asia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) group for putting out a news item that turned out to be wrong. It was the president in person who ordered the investigation. The ABC group, several hundred of whose staff lost their jobs because of the closures, had always stood up to the authorities. The director of the Tamil-language Surayan FM was kidnapped in Colombo in 2006. In January 2008, the government opened new negotiations with the ABC management, which asked some employees to return to work.\n\nThe English-language news website Tamilnet, which is very popular because it often provides exclusive news about the situation in the LTTE-controlled areas, was blocked by the country’s Internet service providers on 15 June. A bullet to the head had killed the website’s director, Dharmeratnam Sivaram “Taraki”, in April 2005 in Colombo. The authorities once again in 2007 blocked an investigation that had begun with the arrest of a suspect, a member of a pro-government Tamil party.\n\nOne by one Tamil correspondents for the national and international press have been leaving the north and east and sometimes the country, after receiving threats. When a Reporters Without Borders’ representative was in Jaffna in June, the correspondent for the Associated Press received a text message and a call from a satellite phone telling him it was his last warning before his execution. He left Jaffna the following day.\n\n“I have never seen anything like it. Even in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, foreign journalists had more freedom of movement”, a journalist working for Agence France-Presse told Reporters Without Borders after returning from reporting in Jaffna. He had only been allowed to visit the city accompanied by a military escort and had not been able to interview a single resident. A British television film crew was in October also prevented from working in the peninsula, even though they had obtained permission from the defence ministry. Soldiers forced the three journalists to stay at the Palaly military bases and escorted them round Jaffna for two hours before telling them to return to Colombo.\n\nIn its war against the LTTE, the army at the end of November bombed the installations of the movement’s official radio, near Killinochchi in the north. Nine civilians, three of them station staff, were killed and around a dozen more were injured. The radio Voice of Tigers is certainly a propaganda radio run by the LTTE, but the attack violates rules of engagement that restrict military bombing to strictly military targets.\n\nBy contrast, the pressure brought to bear by the LTTE was less visible than that of the authorities, but was every bit as effective. The separatist movement has never hesitated to go after dissidents within the Tamil community and the press is no exception to this rule. The head of a Tamil media explained: “We know that the reaction of the LTTE can also be potentially harmful for our staff, so we are very careful. We weigh every word when we talk about the LTTE and the army. And naturally we never refer to the Tigers as terrorists”. The LTTE intelligence services often summon or call Tamil journalists when they want them to provide them with information.\n\nOfficials turned into gang leaders\n\nSome ministers behave like gang leaders. Labour minister, Mervyn Silva, arrived with his henchmen at the offices of the state-run television Rupavahini, in Colombo, in December, and ordered one of his men to beat the news editor because he had failed to broadcast a speech he just made while formally opening a new bridge. Police were forced to intervene and the minister left the building under a hail of insults.\n\nThe same minister had in January incited his supporters to physically attack journalists, including a BBC correspondent, who were covering a peaceful rally. He said in April that “journalists behave like mad dogs and they have to be injected against rabies”.\n\nThe defence secretary and younger brother of the president, Gotabhaya Rajapakse, in April called the editor of the Daily Mirror, Champika Liyanaarachchi, on his mobile phone and threatened her, saying that she would escape reprisals only if she resigned. He said he would put pressure on the newspaper’s management to ensure she was dismissed. He also threatened to “exterminate” the journalist Uditha Jayasinghe, for writing articles about the plight of civilian war casualties. Security forces on two occasions also accused the Daily Mirror of betraying the country.\n\nObstacles increasingly put in the way of investigative journalism\n\nThe prominent investigative journalist Iqbal Athas and several of his colleagues on the Sunday Times were in August victims of a campaign of harassment orchestrated by army officers wanting to silence them after revelations about the purchase of MIG-27 warplanes from Ukraine. The government staged demonstrations outside the home of Iqbal Athas in Colombo accusing him of being a “traitor”. After his police protection was removed, Athas left the country for several weeks and suspended his column that specialised in military affairs.\n\nAn article posted on the defence ministry website on 2 October accused the journalist of taking part in “psychological operations by the LTTE terrorists”. A few days earlier, after Athas had just resumed his column in the Sunday Times, army spokesman, Brigadier Udaya Nanayakakara, called on the media to stop publishing his articles.\n\nThe authorities also sponsored an arson attack in November on the printers of the Leader Publications group, sending in around 15 men, with the complicity of the army, who mistreated two staff before spraying machines with petrol and torching them. The group publishes the English-language weeklies the Sunday Leader and Morning Leader, the Sinhala-language weekly Irudina and prints the Tamil-language daily Sudar Oli. The raiders destroyed thousands of copies of the Morning Leader which were due for distribution that morning. The editor of the Sunday Leader, Lasantha Wickramatunga, known for his investigations and critical editorials, condemned the attack as a commando operation backed by the government.\n\nThe few Tamil journalists who tried to carry out investigative work were also targeted. In August, Kalimuttu Palamohan, known as K. P. Mohan, a specialist in military affairs for the Tamil-language daily Thinakkural, had acid thrown at him as he returned to his home in Colombo. Soldiers had attacked the journalist two months earlier. “When I showed them my press card they insulted me and then called other colleagues who beat me”, K. P. Mohan said about the first incident.\n\nReporters Without Borders defends imprisoned journalists and press freedom throughout the world.

In Sri Lanka, the killing of a media worker is most likely to be an act of murder. This toll does not reveal the equally dark reality of journalists who are reported missing and whose whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nIn the past two years, mainly journalists from the Tamil community have fallen victim to acts of violence that go unpunished. FMM reports that in one of the most serious cases, Jaffna-based newspaper Uthayan has received threats to cease its operation. Four Uthayan employees have been murdered, while others have been kidnapped, threatened and censored. The editor, M.V. Kanamailnathan, has not left the newspaper office for more than a year for fear of being killed.\n\nAs the violence between government forces and the LTTE escalates, several attacks on journalists, including attacks instigated by government officials, have raised the concerns of all journalists and media workers across the regions and increasingly in Colombo.\n\nAccording to FMM, an unknown gang failed in an attempt to abduct Silumina senior journalist and SLWJA secretary Poddala Jayantha at his home on January 7.\n\nThe attack occurred just days after two separate incidents in which government officials publicly attacked journalists physically and verbally. On December 27, Labour Minister Mervyn Silva forcibly entered the offices of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) and assaulted the state-run television network’s news director, T.M.G. Chandrasekara. The attack was reportedly because SLRC did not telecast one of the Minister’s speeches.\n\nFMM reports that three leading media personnel of the MBC TV and Radio network who covered the incident, Chevaan Daniel, Kingsley Ratnayaka and Susil Kedelpitya, have since received death threats.\n\nFMM is also alarmed at reports that the lives of other senior journalists, media activists and journalists’ leaders, including SLWJA president Sanath Balasooriya and FMETU general secretary Dharmasiri Lankapeli, are at risk because of their involvement in condemning the SLRC incident.\n\nAt a press conference on January 7, the Social Services and Social Welfare Minister, K.N. Douglas Devananda, also put the safety of journalists at risk by condemning the Shakti TV Minnal program and its presenter, Sri Ranga Jeyarathnam. Minister Devananda labelled the presenter a traitor and accused him of being a terrorist working with the LTTE.\n\nOn January 2, a commander of the Sri Lanka Army, Major General Sarath Fonseka, accused sections of the media and journalists of treachery and being unpatriotic. Such statements undermine the role and function of the media to hold to account those in public office.\n\nIt is clear that increasing attacks on journalists and the media put any journalist or media worker at risk if they challenge, question or criticise the actions or policies of power-holders, said IFJ Asia-Pacific Director Jacqueline Park.\n\n“The IFJ condemns any attack on journalists conducted by either side of the conflict. But as the major power-holder, the Government must lead the way in making a commitment to uphold journalists’ rights and put an end to the practise of ministers taking matters into their own hands,” Ms Park said.\n\n“The latest attacks on journalists are indicators that the Government is failing to respect all media workers as non-combatants in war zones and failing to ensure the right of the media to report on the conflict. Now the broader journalism community is also in danger.”\n\nThe IFJ strongly urges Sri Lanka’s Government to enforce the United Nations Security Council Resolution to Protect Journalists Reporting in War Zones and Crisis Areas, adopted by the UN Security Council in 2006.\n\nThe Resolution stipulates “that all parties to an armed conflict comply fully with the obligations applicable to them under international law related to the protection of civilians in armed conflict, including journalists, media professionals and associated personnel”.\n\nThe IFJ reiterates its call to Sri Lanka’s Government to abide by its commitments to international law, including under Article 79 of the Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention to respect the safety of journalists as non-combatant civilians and refrain from deliberate attacks that endanger their lives.\n\nAll members of the international human rights and press freedom community are encouraged to assist media professionals in Sri Lanka in defending press freedom and democratic process in the face of the threat of murder, abduction harassment and politically motivated violence.\n\nFor further information contact IFJ Asia-Pacific on +61 2 9333 0919\n\nThe IFJ represents over 600,000 journalists in 120 countries"
