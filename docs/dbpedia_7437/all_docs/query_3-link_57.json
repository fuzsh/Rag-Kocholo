I have a show coming up.’ And so he and I went all over Oklahoma to the different reservations, doing open casting calls looking for these rez kids and that’s how we found Lane Factor. He just kept showing up at the open casting calls, and we kept putting him through the wringer.”\n\nThe initial casting call also produced the actors who became the Rez Dogs’ rivals.\n\n“Basically all the ‘bad guy’ gang were people who had originally auditioned for, like, Bear and Cheese and Willie Jack and Elora, and we pulled them from those sessions,” Midthunder said.\n\n“Our trip around Oklahoma certainly wasn’t wasted. And you know, one of the things that Sterlin just really wanted was to include as many people from Oklahoma in the show as possible, just knowing that would make it feel real. I don’t work on location, but he was insistent that it be filmed in Oklahoma. Can you imagine the show shooting anywhere else? This is what makes it feel so authentic.”\n\nThe members of the rival gang unite with the Rez Dogs late in the series. Actors in the rival gang are Jude Barnett (Bone Thug Dog), Xavier Bigpond (Weeze), Elva Guerra (Jackie) and Jack Maricle (White Steve).\n\n“Jack doesn’t get enough love from everybody, but isn’t he great? He’s another great find, right?” Midthunder said.\n\nCheese aside, the Rez Dog youths were found through a typical process of auditioning through agents.\n\n“D’Pharaoh and Paulina were kind of newer, young actors and I had been watching them for a little while and getting tapes from them for different projects and keeping an eye on their careers,” Midthunder said. “They had both just done a movie called ‘Beans,’ an independent film. I thought they were both very talented.”\n\nThe Willie Jack character in “Reservation Dogs” was originally supposed to be a male. When Alexis auditioned, she read for the role of Elora.\n\n“And when I saw her tape, I thought ‘eureka, We have our Elora!’ But then Sterlin was, like, ‘She’s not quite right for Elora. Let me think on it.’ And he comes back and he says ‘Paulina is Willie Jack,’ which was a complete 180 from what I was initially picturing, but how fun.”\n\nContinuing, Midthunder said she loves the relationship between Willie Jack and Elora, the girls who “kind of run the gang, if you will.”\n\n“And then adding in Jackie, who kind of came over from the bad guy gang, it just became more female-centric over the seasons than I imagined it initially. And I think it happened very organically. A lot of indigenous communities are kind of matriarchal. So it’s another glimpse into this world and I think outsiders can really appreciate seeing how the women kind of end up becoming so strong in their communities.”\n\nWhat special qualities did each of the four primary Rez Dogs actors possess that made them right for their roles?\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nWoon-A-Tai: “His personality. What you see on screen is so much of who he really is. He’s upbeat, bubbly, outgoing. He’s quirky. He’s funny. He’s smart. We saw so many auditions for that role and he was the one who, when he did it, you’re like, this fits like a glove. I don’t know how else to say it.”\n\nJacobs: “Elora is kind of the disputed leader of the Reservation Dogs. I know Bear thinks he is the leader, but the rest of the Reservation Dogs know she is the leader. They are going to ask her what to do before they ask Bear what to do.\n\n“Devery kind of came into the situation with an authority that we hadn’t seen from anyone else and also with the authority and sensibility that Elora had to have as kind of the unofficially elected matriarch of the Reservation Dogs. Devery was the most practiced actor of the group, so we felt safe casting her and we knew that she could kind of lead the pack, if you will.”\n\nFactor: “We wanted to get as many folks from Oklahoma as we could into the show. ... The process was almost more like we were finding people that we loved, that we were falling in love with and responding to, for the show. And the process became more almost reverse-engineered a little bit. Typically this process started like any other where we auditioned people for certain roles, but then it kind of, at some point, turned on its head and it’s like we started falling in love with people. And we knew we wanted them in the show, so we started going, OK, where do they fit?\n\n“That was kind of the case with with Elva, who plays Jackie. She read for Elora and she wasn’t Elora, but we knew that she lives in this world. And so, Lane, the process was similar with Lane where we just kept thinking ‘Is he in the gang? And how does he fit. He did.’ I think going back to the pilot, they weren’t a gang. They were a group of friends and they kind of had to become a gang. I feel like every group of friends always has to have the voice of reason and that’s where Cheese fits in and we love him for it.”\n\nAlexis: “I feel like Paulina is at the center of this world. I’ve just had such a wonderful time watching her character grow and, as we see in this season, she’s moving into kind of embracing the spiritual healing role in the community and that’s definitely something I didn’t see in the beginning. But the more we live in this world, the deeper we go. For someone like yourself, who I’m sure you’ve spent time in Native American communities, you see that. You begin to expect the unexpected. And I think Paulina brought such an organic, authentic quality with her, I mean, she’s herself, you know? And then to see her grow into the the role of the healer in her community, it just feels like a very natural path for her to take and it feels very real to the actual, I would say, lived experience of any Native American community.”\n\nA fifth Rez Dog, Daniel, appears in flashbacks during the series. It was Daniel’s suicide which drove the show’s initial story. Daniel was played by Oklahoma actor Dalton Cramer.\n\n“He was another one who initially read for Bear,” Midthunder said. “He came to a casting call in Seminole. He just showed up and, you know, was another one with no experience. And we loved him. We ended up flying him out to L.A. and testing him for the role of Bear. And, like I said, when D’Pharaoh walked into the room, it fight him like a glove. He had the swagger. He brought a swagger to Bear. It was like we didn’t know Bear had a swagger, but he sure does. But we loved Dalton for the show. We knew he fit into the world. Sterlin was like ‘I have something in mind for him’ and he ended up being Daniel.”\n\nThree seasons later, it’s difficult to imagine any other actors in the Rez Dogs roles.\n\n“I have to give all the credit to the actors because they brought their their true selves, and that’s what we told them,” Midthunder said, sharing a story about how the majority of the cast was inexperienced and yet co-creator Taika Waititi was confident from the beginning.\n\n“He has worked with kids and has worked with non actors, and he was just like ‘bring it on. Let’s make this as real as we can,’” Midthunder said.\n\n“That kind of gave Sterlin and I license to go into the communities and find people from the communities and kind of be looking for real people and not be looking for actors to play these people. We told the actors from day one we were not looking for actors, per se. We just want you to just bring yourself and be yourself. So the strength of their characters, I feel like that speaks volumes for the actors and then also for the writers. The writers, you get to know the actors and then they are writing to the actors’ strengths and their personality traits. I definitely feel like everything about this show has been magic and so satisfying.”\n\nThe new Tulsa World app offers personalized features.
