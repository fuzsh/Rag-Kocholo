        "text": "I had accepted the fact that Atom was not going to do anything about my issue. To my great surprise and pleasure I received an email from Sean in customer service. They did indeed consider my request. Iâm grateful that they took the time to reconsider my issue. I thank them for their efforts and will continue to use the app.\n\nOld review-\n\nPlain and simple, customer service is awful. I bought tickets for a blockbuster premier. Apparently someone else reserved the same seats at the same time. Atom still charged me and didnât notify me for over an hour that my seats reservation failed. They refunded my tickets but by that time the theater was sold out. I was able to book a different showing the same night directly through the theater and not through Atom. But it was inconvenient and messed up plans for others for the night. I had just signed up for the MegaPass program which has a6 month commitment. It is basically $15/month and gives you two free passes. Not bad if you like to go to the movies. I requested they cancel my membership since I no longer have confidence in their system. They simply quoted company policy and stated that sometimes it happens on busy nights. I asked if they could do anything at all to show they cared about their customer experience and the answer was no. This is my experience, it looks like Iâm not alone.\n\nAtom makes it so easy to find a theater, but tickets, and even pay for food and drinks and snacks in advance. This app is very user-friendly, that is understandable to all ages. If you want to look at whatâs out there, theyâll have it, and you can even buy tickets on the app itself. By ordering seats in advance, you can ensure you will get a good seat in the theaters. Although they have a pricey convenience fee, you can often minimize that by using the T-mobile Tuesdayâs app (if youâre a T-mobile user) and there are deals on $5 off and they wipe out the $1.50 convenience fee that is set on each ticket. Iâm so in love with this app already, I got tickets from AMC for $7.74 a ticket without any hassle! Before they would sell âgoldâ tickets that are $8 each but to be honest, these are just a bit better. You also get to look at upcoming movies and pay for concession meals in advance and thatâs a huge advantage of using this app. Itâs living up to its hype!\n\nThe worst customer care service! My account as deactivated after over 10 times to purchase tix with my atom cash (a refund without fee penalty that I regret choosing). Now mind you the span of me trying to purchase tix was done in a month. Continuously got error message to update my payment method when I have proof that I had money in my atom account. What was the resolution for the customer care Dept? Deactivate my account, supposedly wait 7-10 days to get part of money back. Itâs better not to do third party sellers. 1. Third party are NOT FREE! They need to make money, so thereâs fees when purchasing. You canx, they stay with the fee portion altho u didnât watch the movie. Fair? No! 2. On Atom your are also limited as what you could purchase in the concession stands whereas with AMC it has the full menu. 3. Third party sellers are limited on their customer service. Remember they are more worried on getting themselves money instead of the full experience as they are not the movie company themselves. You will not get what you want not expect them to resolve your issue. They donât care. Donât my mistake. I know there couldâve been other options to take care of my issues, gift cards, put in the order for me, etc but donât just deactivate my account and take my money!! My advice, donât use atom cash, donât use or buy gift cards, donât leave your wallet saved. I donât feel safe."
