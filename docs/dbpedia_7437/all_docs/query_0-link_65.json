        "text": "Application Information and Forms\n\nOffice of Admissions and Outreach\n\nLassen Hall - Room 1102\n\nOffice of Admissions and Outreach Website\n\nRequirements for admission to California State University, Sacramento are in accordance with Title 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 3, of the California Code of Regulations. Complete information is available on the California State University (CSU) website.\n\nThe Office of Admissions and Outreach provides prospective students with information about academic programs, admission requirements, and the application process.\n\nAll CSU applications must be submitted online on the Cal State Apply website. An acknowledgement will be sent to the applicant when the online application has been submitted.\n\nStudents who want to enroll for residence credit in either a fall or spring semester must file an application for admission. A student who has been in attendance at Sacramento State in either of the two preceding semesters is considered a continuing student and does not need to reapply or pay the $70 application fee. The application and fee are necessary when reentering California State University, Sacramento after an absence of two or more semesters, but are not required for students desiring to enroll only in Open University or intersession.\n\nSacramento State Affirmative Action and Non-Discrimination Policy\n\nSacramento State seeks the participation in all its programs and activities, including admission and access, by all individuals without regard to race, color, religion, origin, age, sex, gender, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, genetic information, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, or disability. Discrimination based on these factors is prohibited by University policy. Sacramento State has established nondiscrimination and affirmative action programs that conform to applicable federal statutes, as well as pertinent laws, regulations, and directives of the State of California. These statutes prohibit discrimination and harassment (including sexual harassment) against applicants, students and employees. Sacramento State is committed to provide equal opportunities to all its students in all campus programs, including intercollegiate athletics. William \"Skip\" Bishop, the Director of Equal Opportunity, has been designated to coordinate the efforts of Sacramento State to comply with all applicable federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination and harassment on these bases.\n\nFor further information, or should you feel that you have been discriminated against in any one of the areas mentioned, including Title IX, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, contact the Office for Equal Opportunity at (916) 278-5770, email, or visit our website.\n\nUse of Social Security Number\n\nApplicants are required to include their correct social security numbers in designated places on applications for admission pursuant to the authority contained in Section 41201, Title 5, California Code of Regulations, and Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6109). The university uses the social security number to identify students and their records including identification for purposes of financial aid eligibility and disbursement and the repayment of financial aid and other debts payable to the institution. Also, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the university to file information returns that include the student's social security number and other information such as the amount paid for qualified tuition, related expenses and interest on educational loans. This information is used by the IRS to help determine whether a student, or a person claiming a student as a dependent, may take a credit or deduction to reduce federal income taxes. The Financial Aid Office will also use it to report Federal Work Study earnings to the Federal Department of Education.\n\nThe student's social security number is not used as the individual identifier in all student records which may include:\n\napplication and admissions records,\n\nregistration records,\n\nenrollment/transcript records,\n\nfinancial aid records,\n\nalumni records, and\n\nrecords maintained by other University operated programs.\n\nA student is assigned a unique Sacramento State ID upon submission of an application for admission to the University, which is used as the student identifier in all student records.\n\nSuch personally identifiable records are not shared or distributed to private individuals or agencies unless such sharing or distribution is authorized by the student or unless otherwise lawfully available. (See Appendix D).\n\nUndergraduate Application Procedures\n\nProspective students applying for part-time or full-time undergraduate programs of study must submit a completed undergraduate application. The $70 nonrefundable application fee should be paid online at the time of application via credit card or PayPal and may not be transferred or used to apply to another term. An alternate major may be requested on the application if desired by the university. The applications of persons denied admission to an impacted university may be redirected to another university at no cost, but only if the applicant is CSU eligible.\n\nImportance of Filing Complete, Accurate, and Authentic Application Documents\n\nSacramento State advises prospective students that they must supply complete and accurate information on the application for admission, residency questionnaire, and financial aid forms. Further, applicants must, when requested, submit authentic and official transcripts of all previous academic work attempted. Failure to file complete, accurate, and authentic application documents may result in denial of admission, cancellation of registration or academic credit, suspension, or expulsion (Section 41301, Article 1.1, Title 5, California Code of Regulations).\n\nImpacted Programs\n\nThe CSU designates programs as impacted when more applications from regularly eligible applicants are received in the initial filing period (October and November for fall terms, June for winter terms, August for spring terms, February for summer terms) than can be accommodated. Some programs are impacted at every university which they are offered; others are impacted only at a few universities.\n\nCandidates for admission must meet all of the university's specified supplementary admission criteria if applying to an impacted program or university.\n\nThe CSU will announce during the fall filing period those CSUs or programs that are impacted. Detailed information on university and program impaction is available on the Impaction at the CSU website.\n\nCampuses will communicate supplementary admission criteria for all impacted programs to high schools and community colleges in their application service area and will disseminate this information to the public through appropriate media. This information will also be published on the Sacramento State website and made available online.\n\nApplicants must file applications for admission to an impacted program during the initial filing period. Applicants who wish to be considered for impacted programs at more than one CSU should file an application at each university for which they seek admission consideration.\n\nSupplementary Admission Criteria\n\nEach university with impacted programs or class-level admission categories uses supplementary admission criteria in screening applicants. Supplementary criteria may include rank-ordering of freshman applicants based on the combination of student's \"A-G\" GPA and supplemental factors or rank-ordering of transfer applicants based on verification of the Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) or Associate in Science Transfer (AS-T) degrees, the overall transfer grade point average (GPA), completion of specified prerequisite courses and a combination of campus-developed criteria. Applicants for freshman admission to impacted universities or programs may need to have a higher \"a-g\" GPA . In no case will standardized test scores be utilized in making freshman admission decisions.\n\nThe supplementary admission criteria used by individual CSUs to screen applicants are made available by the universities to all applicants seeking admission to an impacted program.\n\nSacramento State Designated Impacted Programs\n\nAll undergraduate programs in Business have been officially designated as impacted programs on the Sacramento State campus.

Preapproved criteria are announced prior to the beginning of each application cycle. Admission criteria are subject to revision.\n\nEnglish Language Requirement\n\nAll undergraduate applicants whose native language is not English and who have not attended schools at the secondary level or above for at least three years full-time where English is the principal language of instruction must demonstrate English language proficiency through one of the following acceptable tests.\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency Requirement Test Undergraduate Graduate TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) is required if your native language is not English1 Score of 510 (paper based test) Score of 5501 (paper based test) TOEFL Score of 64 (internet based test) Score of 801 (internet based) PTE Academic Score of 50 Score of 651 IELTS (Academic) Overall band score of 6.0 Overall band score of 6.51 DuoLingo Score of 95 NA\n\nSome majors and some CSUs may require a higher score. A few CSUs may also use alternative methods of assessing English fluency: Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and the International Test of English Proficiency (ITEP). Each university will post the tests it accepts on its website and will notify students after they apply about the tests it accepts and when to submit scores. CSU minimum TOEFL standards are:\n\nUndergraduate 61 - INTERNET, 500- PAPER\n\nGraduate 80 - INTERNET, 550 – PAPER\n\nAt the graduate level, a TOEFL score of 550 (or 80 internet based test) is required for admission for all students, with the following exceptions:\n\nCommunication Studies,\n\nEnglish,\n\nInternational Affairs,\n\nSpeech Pathology and Audiology,\n\nTeaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) require higher scores.\n\nReturning Students\n\nSacramento State students are granted an automatic leave of absence for one semester. This leave maintains the continuous attendance status of the student with eligibility to register in the following semesters and holds the catalog that determines degree requirements.\n\nFormer Sacramento State students who have been absent for two or more semesters must apply for readmission. An application fee is charged. Following a mandatory interruption of one or more semesters, students who have left in a negative academic standing1 may not be eligible to return until they complete additional coursework. Students who have been academically disqualified or dismissed must file an appeal for reinstatement/readmission.2\n\nReservation\n\nThe University reserves the right to select its students and deny admission to the University or any of its programs as the University, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate based on an applicant’s suitability and the best interests of the University.\n\nSteps in the Application Process\n\nApplication Filing Periods\n\n(Not all campuses/programs are open for admission to every term.)\n\nSacramento State uses a semester-based academic calendar. The initial filing periods for applications are the previous October through November for fall semester and the previous August for spring semester. All applications received during the initial filing period will be given equal consideration within established enrollment categories and quotas.\n\nAdditional selection criteria may be used to select applicants if more applications are received during the initial filing period than can be accommodated in specific enrollment categories. If the campus is designated an “impacted campus,” supplemental criteria may be used to select applicants.\n\nIf any enrollment categories are not filled during the initial filing period, the University will continue to accept applications during an extended filing period until capacity is reached. Enrollment priorities within the extended period will be in chronological order of receipt of applications.\n\nApplication Filing Periods Term Applications First Accepted Initial Filing Period Fall Semester October 1 October 1 - November 30 Spring Semester August 1 August 1 - 31\n\nFiling Period Duration\n\nEach non-impacted campus accepts applications until capacities are reached. Many campuses limit undergraduate admission in an enrollment category due to overall enrollment limits. If applying after the initial filing period, consult the campus admissions office for current information.\n\nApplication Acknowledgment\n\nOn-time applicants may expect to receive an e-mail acknowledgement from the universities to which they have applied within two to four weeks of filing the application. The notice may include a request that applicants submit additional records necessary to evaluate academic qualifications. Applicants may be assured of admission if the evaluation of relevant qualifications indicates that applicants meet CSU admission requirements, and in the case of admission impaction, supplemental criteria for admission to an impacted program. Unless specific written approval/confirmation is received, an offer of admission is not transferable to another term or to another university.\n\nTranscript and Test Score Requirements (Note: For Fall 2021 and Fall 2022 admission, test score requirements have been suspended)\n\nUndergraduate students are required to comply with the following transcript and test score requirements as part of the application procedures for admission. Applicants project their class level as of the date of intended initial enrollment.\n\nApplicants with No College Units:\n\nTranscripts: One from high school showing final senior grades and date of graduation. Tests: Either ACT or SAT score.\n\nApplicants with Fewer Than 60 Semester Units:\n\nTranscripts: One official copy of final record from each college attended; one showing work-in-progress if currently enrolled.\n\nApplicants with 60 or More Transferable Semester Units:\n\nTranscripts: One official copy of final record from each college attended; one showing work-in-progress if currently enrolled.\n\nReturning Students:\n\nTranscripts: One official copy of final record from each college attended since last enrollment at Sacramento State; one showing work in progress if currently enrolled.\n\nAll transcripts become the property of the University and will not be released or copied. Processing of applications cannot be guaranteed unless all required documents and test scores are received during the appropriate application period. Individuals who do not file an application for admission are advised that transcripts are retained for one year only. Failure to disclose enrollment in each college or university attended constitutes grounds for denial of admission or dismissal from the University for unethical conduct. The University reserves the right to determine whether or not a record can be accepted as official.\n\nNotification of Admission\n\nApplicants will receive confirmation of their admission or a statement of ineligibility beginning in March for fall semesters and September for spring semesters, if they filed during the first month of the filing periods and all necessary documents have been received. If the campus has been designated an “impacted campus,” notification of admission status may be delayed while supplemental criteria are applied to applications received after the initial filing period.\n\nInformation about registration, placement testing, advising, and orientation will be e-mailed to all admitted students before registration when possible. Late applicants will be considered on a space-available basis.\n\nHardship Petitions\n\nThe university has established procedures for consideration of qualified applicants who would be faced with extreme hardship if not admitted. Petitioners should write to the university Admission Offices regarding specific policies governing hardship admission.\n\nAppeal of Admission Decision\n\nSection 89030.7 of the California Education Code requires that the CSU establishes specific requirements for appeal procedures for a denial of admission. Each CSU university must publish appeal procedures for applicants denied admission to the University. The procedure is limited to addressing university decisions to deny an applicant admission to the University.\n\nAdmissions appeal procedures must address the basis for appeals, provide 15 business days for an applicant to submit an appeal, stipulate a maximum of one appeal per academic term, provide specific contact information for the individual or office to which the appeal should be submitted, and indicate a time estimate for when the university expects to rSPFYPond respond to an appeal. The appeal procedures must be included in all denial of admission notifications to students, and must also be published on the university website.\n\nVisit the \"Admission Appeals\" link at the Office of Admissions and Outreach website for more information.\n\nFreshman Requirements\n\nOffice of Admissions and Outreach\n\nLassen Hall Lobby - Room 1102\n\nOffice of Admissions and Outreach Website\n\nGenerally, applicants will qualify for consideration for first-time freshman admission if they meet the following requirements:\n\nHave graduated from high school, have earned a Certificate of General Education Development (GED) or have passed the California High School Proficiency Examination (CHSPE);\n\nComplete the 15-unit comprehensive \"a-g\" pattern of college preparatory courses;\n\nHave completed, with grades of C- or better, each of the courses in the comprehensive pattern of college preparatory subject requirements also known as the \"a-g\" pattern (see \"Subject Requirements\"); and\n\nThe CSU will accept \"Credit\" or \"Pass\" grades to satisfy \"a-g\" requirements completed during Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall 2020 terms and during Winter, Spring or Summer 2021 terms. The CSU expects and assumes that high school Pass (Credit) grades will represent work completed at the C- or higher level. As of Fall 2021 and forward, grades are expected for courses.\n\nEarn a qualifying \"a-g\" grade point average (GPA) as described below.\n\nCalifornia residents and graduates of California high schools will be eligible for admission by earning a 2.50 or greater \"a-g\" GPA.\n\nAny California high school graduate or resident of California earning a GPA between 2.00 and 2.49 may be evaluated for admission based upon supplemental factors such as number of courses exceeding minimum \"a-g\" requirements, household income, extracurricular involvement, and other available information that would inform the university admission decision.\n\nNon-California residents may be eligible for admission to the CSU by earning a 3.00 or greater \"a-g\" GPA along with other supplemental factors utilized by the individual university, including those outlined by impacted universities and programs.\n\nAny Non-California resident earning a GPA between 2.47 and 2.99 may be evaluated for admission based upon supplemental factors such as number of courses exceeding minimum \"a-g\" requirements, household income, extracurricular involvement, and other available information that would inform the university admission decision.\n\nEach CSU will determine the supplemental factors used with GPA to determine eligibility in these cases and communicate these criteria publicly for prospective students.\n\nThe California State University (CSU) has permanently discontinued the use of ACT/SAT examinations in determining admission eligibility Submitted test scores by admitted students would be considered only for purposes of student placement in Math or English courses.\n\nHonors Courses\n\nUp to eight semesters of approved honors courses taken in the last two years of high school including up to two approved courses taken in the tenth grade, can be accepted toward students' high school GPA (see \"Eligibility Index\"). Each unit (one year) of grade “A” in an honors course will receive 5 points; grade “B,” 4 points; and grade “C,” 3 points.\n\nSubject Requirements\n\nThe CSU requires that first-time freshman applicants complete, with grades of “C-” or better, a comprehensive pattern of college preparatory study totaling 15 units (a “unit” is one year of study in high school).\n\n2 years of social science, including 1 year of U.S. history, or U.S. history and government\n\n4 years of English\n\n3 years of math (algebra, geometry, and intermediate algebra; four years recommended)\n\n2 years of laboratory science (1 biological and 1 physical, both must have laboratory instruction)\n\n2 years in the same foreign language (subject to waiver for applicants demonstrating equivalent competence)\n\n1 year of visual and performing arts: art, dance, drama/theater, or music\n\n1 year of electives: selected from English, advanced mathematics, social science, history, laboratory science, foreign language, visual and performing arts or other courses approved and included on the UC/CSU \"a-g\" list.\n\nNote: All admission requirements (i.e., grade point average, test scores, and subjects) must be completed by the end of the spring term for a fall enrollment and the end of summer for a spring enrollment.\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP) Exams and Advanced Standing Credit\n\nSacramento State grants credit toward its undergraduate degrees for successful completion of examinations of the Advanced Placement Program of the College Board.\n\nStudents may be granted up to 6 units for each Advanced Placement (AP) examination for which a score of 3, 4, or 5 is earned.\n\nTransferable college courses completed as a high school student will be evaluated for possible college credit upon receipt of an official college transcript. For the Official Transfer Evaluations click here.\n\nForeign Language Subject Requirements\n\nThe foreign language subject requirement may be satisfied by applicants who demonstrate competence in a language other than English equivalent to or higher than expected of students who complete two years of foreign language study. Consult with a school counselor or any CSU admissions office for information.\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\n\nSacramento State recognizes completion of the International Baccalaureate (IB) program as satisfying the college preparatory subject requirements for admission.1 The applicant’s high school GPA and score on the ACT or SAT will also be used in determining eligibility for admission.\n\nEligibility Index1\n\nEligibility Index – The eligibility index is the combination of the high school GPA and scores on either the ACT or the SAT. GPA is based on grades earned in courses taken during the final three years of high school. Included in the calculation of GPA are grades earned in all college preparatory “a-g” subject requirements and bonus points for approved honors courses. Up to eight semesters of honors courses taken in the last three years of high school, including up to two approved courses taken in the tenth grade can be accepted. Each unit of A in an honors course will receive a total of 5 points; B, 4 points; and C, 3 points.\n\nA CSU eligibility index can be calculated by multiplying a GPA by 800 and adding the total score on the SAT exam (mathematics and Evidence-Based Reading and Writing). For students who took the ACT, multiply the GPA by 200 and add 10 times the ACT composite score. Persons who are California high school graduates (or residents of California for tuition purposes) need a minimum index of 2950 or 694 using the ACT. The Eligibility Index Table illustrates several combinations of required test scores and averages. The university has no current plans to include the writing scores from either of the admissions tests in the computation of the CSU eligibility index.\n\nPersons who neither graduated from a California high school nor are a resident of California for tuition purposes need a minimum index of 3570 or 842 using the ACT. Graduates of secondary schools in foreign countries must be judged to have academic preparation and abilities equivalent to applicants eligible under this section. An applicant with a grade point average of 3.00 or above (3.61 for nonresidents) is not required to submit test scores. However, all applicants for admission are urged to take the SAT or ACT and provide the scores of such tests to each CSU campus to which they seek admission. Campuses use these test results for advising and placement purposes and may require them for admission to impacted majors or programs.

If an applicant is determined to be unable to fulfill a specific admissions requirement because of disability, alternate college preparatory courses may be substituted for specific subject requirements.\n\nStudents should be aware that course substitutions might limit enrollment in certain majors, particularly those involving mathematics. For further information, contact the Office of Admissions at the nearest CSU campus.\n\nProvisional Admission\n\nSacramento State may provisionally admit first-time freshman applicants based on their academic preparation through the junior year of high school and planned coursework for the senior year. The university will monitor the final terms of study to ensure that admitted students complete their secondary school studies satisfactorily, including the required college preparatory subjects, and graduate from high school. Students are required to submit an official transcript after graduation to certify that all coursework has been satisfactorily completed. Official high school transcripts must be received prior to the deadline set by the university. In no case may documentation of high school graduation be received any later than the census date for a student's first term of CSU enrollment. A CSU may rescind admission decisions, cancel financial aid awards, withdraw housing contracts and cancel any university registration for students who are found to be ineligible after the final transcript has been evaluated.\n\nApplicants will qualify for regular (non-provisional) admission when the university verifies that they have graduated and received a high school diploma, have completed the comprehensive pattern of college preparatory \"a-g\" subjects and, if applying to an impacted program or university, have met all supplementary criteria.\n\nSpecial Categories\n\nEducational Opportunity Program\n\nEOP, a special admission and support program for students who possess the potential and motivation to succeed, is designed to improve access and retention of low-income and educationally disadvantaged students among California residents who wish to pursue a college education.1\n\nVeterans\n\nSee the Veterans Success Center website.\n\nHigh School Students\n\nOffice of Admissions and Outreach\n\nLassen Hall 1102\n\nHigh school students may be considered for enrollment in certain special programs if recommended by the principal and the appropriate university department chair and if preparation is equivalent to that required of eligible California high school graduates. Such admission is only for a given specific program and does not constitute a right to continued enrollment.\n\nThese programs include:\n\nAccelerated College Entrance (ACE) for talented students who can benefit from accelerated academic studies, available by phone at (916) 278-7032;\n\nCapitol Center MESA for underrepresented students in CSU mathematics, engineering, and science programs, available by phone at (916) 278-6699.\n\nStudents accepted into these programs qualify for reduced fees.\n\nHigh school students other than those accepted into the above programs may also enroll concurrently in college courses without fee reduction upon approval of parents, high school principal, and appropriate Sacramento State academic department chairs.\n\nApplicants Not Regularly Eligible\n\nApplicants not admissible under one of the above provisions should enroll at a community college or another appropriate institution in preparatory courses to meet eligibility requirements. Only under the most unusual circumstances and only by special action will such applicants be admitted to Sacramento State.\n\nAdmissions Appeal-Section 89030.7 of the California Education Code requires that the California State University establishes specific requirements for appeal procedures for a denial of admission. Each CSU campus must publish appeal procedures for applicants denied admission to the University. The procedure is limited to addressing campus decisions to deny an applicant admission to the University.\n\nAdmissions appeal procedures must address the basis for appeals, provide 15 business days for an applicant to submit an appeal, stipulate a maximum of one appeal per academic term, provide specific contact information for the individual or office to which the appeal should be submitted, and indicate a time estimate for when the campus expects to respond to an appeal. The appeal procedures must be included in all denial of admission notifications to students, and must also be published on the campus website. Visit the \"After Admission decisions are made link at the Admissions and Outreach website for more information.\n\nReservation\n\nThe University reserves the right to select its students and deny admission to the University or any of its programs as the University, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate based on an applicant’s suitability and the best interests of the University.\n\nTransfer Student Preparation\n\nProspective transfer students may obtain general information on Sacramento State educational opportunities and matriculation procedures from Sacramento State admission and outreach representatives at California community college transfer day and regional college night programs. Representatives are also available at selected transfer centers on a regular basis to provide specific information on CSU matriculation procedures, eligibility for admission, and evaluation of credit. Prospective students who don’t have access to a transfer center can schedule an appointment with an admission counselor for a pre-admission advising session. Applicants should bring unofficial transcripts to these sessions. Contact the Office of Admissions & Outreach for admission counseling hours and availability.\n\nTo make an appointment with academic department faculty to discuss academic program requirements and career alternatives, prospective students should call the relevant department office.\n\nHour-long student-led weekday campus tours are scheduled one week in advance for small and large groups. To schedule a tour on line visit the Campus Tours website.\n\nAcceptance of Transfer Courses\n\nSacramento State annually enrolls more than 5,000 new transfer students from more than 300 different colleges and universities, mostly California community colleges.\n\nFrequently, course titles and numbers differ from campus to campus, making it difficult for transfer students to know in advance which courses will be accepted for transfer to another college. In order to provide students with the assurance that courses taken at their campus prior to transfer will meet Sacramento State lower-division requirements for either General Education or a specific major, three methods of prior approval exist.\n\nGeneral Education Courses\n\nThe CSU system has authorized California community colleges and other approved colleges to designate “transferable” courses planned for use in a four-year baccalaureate program. In addition, they have jointly designated courses that may be used to certify a portion of the CSU General Education objectives to a maximum of 39 semester units. Sacramento State will apply courses completed at a California community college toward the CSU General Education objectives as listed on the community college certification form.\n\nStudents may have their lower division General Education courses certified by a California community college as meeting either the CSU GE Breadth Requirements or the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Core Curriculum (IGETC) in partial completion of the General Education requirements for the baccalaureate degree.1\n\nUpon matriculation, the Degree Evaluations Office will review courses completed at non-CSU colleges and universities; credit will be granted toward the Sacramento State General Education requirements in compliance with applicable CSU system, Sacramento State, and academic department policies.\n\nLower Division Major Prerequisites\n\nSacramento State also has developed an extensive program of major preparation agreements called “Articulation” or “Transfer Credit Agreements.” These are official documents prepared by Sacramento State faculty who carefully review coursework at other institutions and identify courses at those campuses that would be acceptable in lieu of Sacramento State courses. Students who take these courses can be assured they will receive credit toward their academic major at Sacramento State.\n\nArticulation Agreements\n\nSacramento State has thousands of Articulation Agreements with community colleges and four-year institutions throughout the state. These Articulation Agreements are widely distributed and should be readily available to students at their home campus Counseling Centers or online at www.assist.org.\n\nTransfer Centers\n\nUniversity representatives staffing Transfer Centers on community college campuses advise community college students on transfer issues, providing an excellent resource for prospective transfer students.\n\nTransfer Student Assistance\n\nStudents may receive assistance in transferring to Sacramento State through the Transfer Centers at the following campuses:\n\nAmerican River College (916) 484-8685\n\nCosumnes River College (916) 691-7456\n\nFolsom Lake College (916) 608-6510\n\nNapa Valley College (707) 253-3115\n\nSacramento City College (916) 558-2181\n\nSan Joaquin Delta College (209) 954-5634\n\nSanta Rosa Junior College (707) 527-4874\n\nSierra College (916) 660-7441\n\nSolano College (707) 864-7158\n\nYuba College (530) 741-6790\n\nUndergraduate Transfer Admission Requirements\n\nTransfer Policies of California State University\n\nMost commonly, college-level credits earned from an institution of higher education accredited by a regional/national accrediting agency are accepted for transfer to member universities of the CSU; However, authority for decisions regarding the transfer of undergraduate credits is delegated to each university.\n\nCalifornia Community Colleges and other authorized certifying institutions can certify up to 39 semester (58.5 quarter) units of General Education-Breadth (GE-Breadth) or 37 semester (55.5 quarter) units of the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) for transfer students to fulfill lower- division general education requirements for any CSU prior to transfer.\n\n\"Certification\" is the official notification from a California Community College or authorized institution that a transfer student has completed courses fulfilling lower-division general education requirements. The CSU GE-Breadth and the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) certification course lists for particular community colleges can be accessed on the official transfer and articulation system for California's public colleges and universities website, assist.org.\n\nCSUs may enter into course-to-course or program-to-program articulation agreements with other CSUs, any or all of the California community colleges and other regionally accredited institutions. Established CSU and CCC articulations may be found on assist.org. Students may be permitted to transfer no more than 70 semester (105 quarter) units to a CSU from an institution which does not offer bachelor's degrees or their equivalents, for example, community colleges. Given the university's 30-semester (45-quarter) unit residency requirement, no more than a total of 90 semester (135 quarter) units may be transferred into the university from all sources.\n\nTransfer Requirements\n\nApplicants who have completed fewer than 60 transferable semester college units (fewer than 90 quarter units) are considered lower-division transfer students. Applicants who have completed 60 or more transferable semester college units (90 or more quarter units) are considered upper-division transfer students. Applicants who complete college units during high school or through the summer immediately following high school graduation are considered first-time freshmen and must meet the CSU minimum eligibility requirements for first-time freshman admission. Transferable courses are those designated for baccalaureate credit by the college or university offering the courses and accepted as such by the university to which the applicant seeks admission.\n\nLower Division Transfers Requirements\n\nDue to increased enrollment demands, some CSUs do not admit lower-division transfer applicants. Students are advised to check the respective university they are interested in to see if lower division transfer applications are accepted.\n\nAn applicant who completes fewer than 60 semester (90 quarter) units of college credit is considered a lower-division transfer student. Due to enrollment pressures, some CSUs do not admit lower- division transfers so that more upper-division transfers can be accommodated.\n\nHaving fewer than 60 semester (90 quarter) units at the point of transfer may affect eligibility for registration priority at a CSU and may affect the student's financial aid status.\n\nCalifornia resident transfer applicants with fewer than 60 semester or 90 quarter units must:\n\nHave a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (C) or better in all transferable units attempted;\n\nHave completed, with a grade of C- or better, a course in written communication and a course in mathematics or quantitative reasoning at a level satisfying CSU General Education Breadth Area A2 and B4 requirements, respectively;\n\nBe in good standing at the last institution attended; and\n\nMeet any one of the following eligibility standards.\n\nTransfer Based on Current Admission Criteria\n\nThe applicant meets the freshman admission requirements in effect for the term for which the application is filed; - OR -\n\nTransfer Based on High School Eligibility\n\nThe applicant was eligible as a freshman at the time of high school graduation and has been in continuous attendance in an accredited college since high school graduation; - OR -\n\nTransfer Based on Making Up Missing Subjects\n\nThe applicant had a qualifiable eligibility index at the time of high school graduation (combination of GPA and test scores if needed), has made up any missing college preparatory subject requirements with a grade of C- or better, and has been in continuous attendance in an accredited college since high school graduation.\n\nOne baccalaureate-level course of at least 3 semester (4 quarter) units is usually considered equivalent to one year of high school study.\n\n(Note: Some CSUs may require lower-division transfer students to complete specific college coursework, for example the four basic skill courses, as part of their admission criteria.)\n\nUpper Division Transfers Requirements\n\nGenerally, applicants will qualify for consideration for upper-division transfer admission if they meet all of the following requirements:\n\nCumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 in all transferable units attempted;\n\nIn good standing at the last college or university attended; and\n\nCompleted at least sixty (60) transferable semester (90 quarter) units of college level coursework with a grade point average of 2.0 or higher and a grade of C- or better in each course used to meet the CSU general education requirements in written communication, oral communication, critical thinking, and quantitative reasoning, e.g. mathematics.\n\nThe 60 units must include at least 30 units of courses that meet CSU general education requirements, including all of the general education requirements in communication in the English language (both oral and written) and critical thinking and the requirement in mathematics/quantitative reasoning (usually 3 semester units) OR the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) requirements in English communication and mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning.\n\nAssociate Degrees for Transfer (AA-T or AS-T)\n\nThe Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and the Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T) degrees offered at the California Community Colleges (CCC) are designed to provide a California community college student the optimum transfer preparation and a clear admission pathway to the CSU degree majors.\n\nCCC students who earn an Associate Degree for Transfer (AA-T or AS-T) are guaranteed admission with junior standing to a CSU and given priority admission consideration over other transfer applicants when applying to a local CSU or non-impacted CSU program. AA-T or AS- T admission applicants are given limited priority consideration based on their eligibility ranking to an impacted university/program or to CSUs/programs that have been deemed similar to the degree completed at the community college. Students who have completed an AA-T/AS-T in a program deemed similar to a CSU major are able to complete remaining requirements for graduation within 60 semester (90 quarter) units. It is the responsibility of the student who has earned an AA-T/AS-T to provide documentation of the degree to the CSU. For the admissions process, students are responsible for working with their community college counselors to complete verification of AA-T or AS-T degree progress through the e-verify process within the established university deadlines.\n\nProvisional Admission\n\nSacramento State may provisionally or conditionally admit transfer applicants based on their academic preparation and courses planned for completion. The university will monitor the final terms to ensure that those admitted complete all required courses satisfactorily. All accepted applicants are required to submit an official transcript of all college-level work completed. CSUs may rescind admission for any student who is found to be ineligible after the final transcript has been evaluated. In no case may such documents be received and validated by the university any later than a student's registration for their second term of CSU enrollment.\n\nLocal Area for Admission\n\nFirst-year freshmen applicants who graduate from high school in one of the following counties are considered in Sacramento State's local admission area: Sacramento, El Dorado, Nevada, Placer, San Joaquin, Solano or Yolo.\n\nTransfer applicants transferring with the majority of units from one of the following community colleges are considered in Sacramento State's local admission area: American River, Cosumnes River, Folsom Lake, Lake Tahoe, Sacramento City, Sierra, San Joaquin Delta, Solano, Woodland or Yuba.\n\nApplicants from the local admission area who meet minimum admission eligibility requirements will be offered admission to the university. However, they may not be admitted to the major of their choice due to impaction.\n\nWait List\n\nFor application terms for which the number of eligible applicants for admission exceeds enrollment capacity, a waitlist will be established. Students who accept the offer to remain on the admission waitlist will be notified of an admission decision as space becomes available.\n\nSpecial Admission Categories1\n\nAdmission of Auditors for Undergraduate Courses\n\nAdmission as auditor may be restricted during periods of over-enrollment. Applicants may check with the Office of Admissions and Outreach or the Office of the University Registrar.\n\nImpacted Programs\n\nTo obtain the most current information on impacted programs and supplemental criteria, refer to https://www.csus.edu/apply/admissions/application-process/impaction.html.\n\nCatalog Rights for Degree Requirements\n\nTransfer students may choose Sacramento State requirements in effect\n\nat the time they began their college study at a California community college or a CSU,\n\nat the time they entered Sacramento State, or\n\nat the time they graduate from Sacramento State, provided they maintain attendance in college.1\n\nReservation\n\nThe University reserves the right to select its students and deny admission to the University or any of its programs as the University, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate based on an applicant's suitability and the best interests of the University.\n\nEvaluation of Transfer Credit\n\nAllowance of Transfer Credit from Accredited Colleges and Universities\n\nGenerally, students will be granted credit for baccalaureate level courses successfully completed at regionally accredited two or four-year colleges.\n\nAll courses, except remedial, are accepted for degree credit from institutions awarding four-year degrees. Credit is reviewed by the Degree Evaluations Office and is granted in compliance with applicable national, state, Title 5, CSU system, and University policies and procedures. Such credit may be applied toward fulfillment of major, minor, or general education requirements when applicable; other courses may count as elective credit toward the baccalaureate degree. This credit will be listed in summary form on the Sacramento State transcript of academic record.\n\nTransfer credit generally is not posted to the Sacramento State transcript of post-baccalaureate students, including those seeking a Second Bachelor’s degree. Check with the Office of Graduate Studies ((916) 278-6470) for exceptions.\n\nAdvanced Placement Examinations\n\nSacramento State grants credit toward its undergraduate degrees for successful completion of examinations of the Advanced Placement Program of the College Board. Students who present scores of three or better will be granted up to six semester units of college credit.\n\nUse of Advanced Placement Credit\n\nAP Credit AP Exam GE Area GE Units Elective Units Course Equivalencies Art History C-Arts or C-Humanities 3 3 None Art Studio-Drawing None 0 6 None Art Studio-2D Design None 0 6 None Art Studio-3D Design None 0 6 None Biology: Score of 3 B2 & B3 4 2 None Biology: Score of 4 or 5 B2, B3 & B5 6 0 BIO 10 Calculus AB:1 Score of 3 B4 4 2 None Calculus AB:1 Score of 4 or 5 B4 4 2 MATH 30 Calculus BC1 B4 & B5 6 0 MATH 30 & 31 Chemistry B1 & B3 4 2 None Chinese Language & Culture C-Humanities 3 3 Foreign Language Requirement Computer Science A1 None 0 6 CSC 15 Computer Science AB1 None 0 6 CSC 15 & CSC 20 Computer Science Principles B4 (May 2018 exam or later) 3 3 None Economics – Macroeconomics D-Economics 3 3 ECON 1A Economics – Microeconomics D-Economics 3 3 ECON 1B English Language and Composition A2 3 3 ENGL 5 English Literature and Composition A2 & C-Humanities 6 0 ENGL 5 Environmental Science B1 & B3 4 2 None French Language & Culture: Score of 3 C-Humanities 4 2 FREN 2A & Foreign Language reqmt.
