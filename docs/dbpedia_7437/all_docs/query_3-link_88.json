        "text": "Maybe he believed it was a log, maybe he saw the little kid go down, either way, he sped off into the distance attempting to get Lucas home to his mother, Ruth Wheldon (Mira Sorvino), and waiting step father, Norris (Gary Kohn). When they arrive, Ruth is furious about them being late, and seeing Lucas's eye made matters worse. Whatever led to their divorce and Dwight's limited custody could only be fueled further by this mess. Meanwhile, as Dwight sped off, the ruckus alerted Ethan who then runs to find his little boy, dead, on the side of the road. His frail and lifeless body laying still in the dirt by the telephone pole. He orders Grace to put Emma in the car before she too runs over to hold the now quiet and limp little body in her arms. The police arrive in short order to collect information, but Ethan cannot remember much. Worse, they must keep the body as evidence in the crime scene. Sergeant Burke (Antoni Corone) assures them he will ensure the body is treated with respect throughout. As Dwight returns home, his mind and heart begin to spin out of control, as he learns later via the radio that he has just committed vehicular homicide. Operating in a fog and damage control mode, he hides his car with front-end damage in the garage and secures a rental for the time being. As the story progresses, his life will merge further with that of the Learners, leading to a largely predictable showdown.\n\nThe film explores both sides of the coin: the guilt of a man who has just committed a terrible crime, albeit an accident, and the simultaneous guilt of a father who wasn't able to protect his son and rage he has in avenging his death. The worst part is that this life-ruining experience could happen to any one at any time, no matter how careful we might perceive ourselves to be either as parents / guardians of children or as drivers. And, while both of these are worthy things to explore, and both Mark Ruffalo and Joaquin Phoenix, respectively, deliver deep and meaningful performances, the story suffers from two very essential problems. First, other than the fact that Dwight does not want to lose visitation privileges with his son due to being in prison, it's not clear how or why he's able to ignore what he's done and avoid turning himself in. As much as his son may mean to him, he's just ended the life of someone else's. There's nothing about him cold enough to make him able to just walk away and nothing calculating enough to make him able to think he could really get away with this. Second, there are too many odd coincidences in how the lives of the Arno/Wheldons interlink with the Learners. It turns out that Ruth was Josh's music teacher. It turns out that the only lawyer in town who can help prosecute Josh's murderer in civil court is Dwight Arno. The fact that they all live in the same small town in Connecticut is enough of a coincidence without these other two. Unfortunately, these things not only detract from the believability of the story but make the fact that the police cannot find the perpetrator unfathomable. As much as the mothers are a part of the story, they are relegated to minor observers in this standoff."
