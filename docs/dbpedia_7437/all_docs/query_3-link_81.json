        "text": "â€” Amoviegoer friend, one who watches all the awards shows and pays attention to the end-of-the year lists, asked me this morning about The Lookout, one of her favorite films of the year and one that doesn't seem to be getting a lot of end-of-theyear love.\n\nThe Lookout was a pretty good movie. It had the misfortune of coming out at the end of March, which means a lot of people simply forgot about it. When I made my first list of potential Top 10 movies back in July, I'd listed The Lookout. Now I've finished my Top 10 and an alternative Top 10, and The Lookout is nowhere to be found. I didn't even consider The Lookout until my friend mentioned it.\n\nDoes this mean The Lookout wasn't as good as I thought it was originally? I don't think so. All it means is that I've watched an awful lot of movies over this past year, especially in the last few weeks. All I can say for sure at this point is there sure are a lot of movies out there.\n\nAnd this year there are a lot of good ones.\n\nUnlike some critics, I never have a hard time picking a Top 10. I don't invest all that much energy in it because I understand it's only a snapshot of my opinion at a given time and few people are really going to give it undue weight.\n\nI have a lot more trouble deciding which movies to leave off. This year, The Lookout got left off, not only my Top 10 but also the alternative Top 10 picked because I thought I could come up with a list of Hollywood - more \"accessible\" - movies I like as well as the ones in my official Top 10, the ballot I turned in andhad counted in the Southeastern Film Critics Association Poll.\n\nSo The Lookout drops down to my honorable-mention list. Along with The Simpsons Movie and a few others that, depending on my mood and how much coffee I've had, might have made it onto one of the Top 10 lists.\n\nThere were seven movies on a level above the rest. One of those films, Jeff Nichols' Shotgun Stories, doesn't appear on any of these lists because I'm considering it a 2008 release. Had I voted for it in the SEFCA poll this year, it wouldn't have had a chance because only a few of my fellow critics had seen it. But it was in the first rank of movies I saw this year.\n\nAnd so, the moment we've all been waiting for:TOP 10 MOVIES OF 2007\n\n1. I'm Not There - An admittedly very personal choice but I can't ignore that I didn't want this movie to end. I could still be sitting there, watching and listening to it on a loop. I'm sure it will baffle some very bright people who haven't completed the requisite Bob Dylan workshops, but this is the best film for and about rock 'n' roll, ever.\n\n2. Killer of Sheep - Charles Burnett's 1977 student film about day-to-day life in Watts finally got a small theatrical release. This is a film that doesn't tell a story so much as paint a portrait, and it was never intended to please casual moviegoers looking for a little escape with popcorn and air conditioning. It is a serious, powerful movie that deserves its accolades. It is one for the museums and the libraries, an authentic American classic.\n\n3. No Country for Old Men - A sad and violent movie that catches the resigned, weary tone of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name. While it can be accepted as a dark story of crime and (attempted) punishment, it is also an elegy for an America that exists only in misty-eyed nostalgia.\n\n4. The Lives of Others - Officially released in 2006, this is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's remarkable evocation of the state-examined existence EastGermans were compelled to live in the bad old days before reunification. It is resolved through a couple of endings, one brutal and tragic enough for the old Greeks, the other graceful and uplifting. It recalls mid-period Hitchcock in its suspensefulness and Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation in its depiction of the paranoia and isolation of the secret agent.\n\n5.\n\nZodiac - As much character study as true-crime procedural, David Fincher's low-key brown and gray Zodiac is an engaging and precisely calibrated psychological thriller with a terrific ensemble cast and a surety of pacing that belies its almost three-hour running time. It's a mature and deeply affecting work.\n\n6.\n\nThere Will Be Blood - P.T. Anderson's latest is an American epic that may well be the first genuinely enduring movie of the 21st century.\n\n7.\n\nEastern Promises - DavidCronenberg's grimly funny and deeply visceral take on the organized evil that men traffic in is of a piece with the superb A History of Violence. It echoes many of History's themes of self-reinvention and features always-enjoyable Viggo Mortensen in the central role of a man who has burrowed deep into an assumed identity. It is violent and subversive of the genre cliches that might constrain a less-original mind.\n\n8.\n\nDiving Bell and the Butterfly - A friend has waggishly dubbed this movie My Left Eye. It's heartbreaking, beautiful and weirdly uplifting.\n\n9.\n\n4 Months, 3 Weeks & 2 Days - Brutal and brave, the winner of this year's Palme d'Or at Cannes is a horrific snapshot of market forces in communist Romania.\n\n10.\n\nBefore the Devil Knows You're Dead - Old pro Sidney Lumet's brothers-in-crime thriller is shot through with Sophoclean tragedy and echoes of the Old Testament.\n\n10 MOVIES THAT COULD HAVE MADE THE TOP 10 LIST\n\n1. The Assassination of JesseJames by the Coward Robert Ford - A film worthy of consideration, rich with feeling and thick with ideas. In a way, it's too soon to deliver a verdict; history will decide whether it's an American masterpiece or not.\n\n2. Gone Baby Gone - Redemption for Ben Affleck.\n\n3. Knocked Up/Superbad/Juno - Three great smart comedies, two from the Judd Apatow laugh factory and one from the promising Jason Reitman.\n\n4. The Bourne Ultimatum - In a lesser year, this might be the movie we'd all be talking about.\n\n5. The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep - Jay Russell's latest is a magical, worthy film that deserves a place on the classics shelf beside Whale Rider and Lassie Come Home.\n\n6. Michael Clayton - Hollywood operating at the height of its powers.\n\n7. American Gangster - Ditto.\n\n8. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street - Not my thing, but highly enjoyable.\n\n9. The Savages - Better thanthe similarly themed (and also good) Away From Her.\n\n10. Hot Fuzz - Great fun I almost forgot about.\n\nHonorable mention: Darkon, The Lookout, Ratatouille, Margot at the Wedding, Into the Wild, Randy and the Mob, No End in Sight, Jindabyne, Chalk, Autism: The Musical, Hairspray, Sicko, Show Business: The Road to Broadway, Deathproof, Offside, The Great Debaters, The Kite Runner, The Simpsons Movie.\n\nBest local development: The Little Rock Film Festival\n\nBest film that I probably heardtoo much about to genuinely appreciate: Once\n\nFilm I haven't seen yet that may merit inclusion on these lists: Persepolis\n\nLocal hero: Matt Smith of Market Street Cinema\n\nDisappointments: Atonement, 300, Reservation Road, Things We Lost in the Fire, Redacted, The Darjeeling Limited\n\nFilm I completely forgot about that probably should have been in the Top 10: This Is England\n\nWorst time at the movies in 2007: Wild Hogs E-mail:"
