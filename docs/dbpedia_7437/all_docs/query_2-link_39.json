        "text": "For our first episode of the new year, we’re taking things back to the very This Had Oscar Buzz beginning. Back when this old podcast was just a single service Tumblr, the first THOB entry was 2007′s Reservation Road, a domestic drama starring Joaquin Phoenix and Jennifer Connelly as a family mourning the loss of a son in a hit-and-run and Mark Ruffalo as the assailant filled with guilt. The film dominated early predictions and went on to a dismal reception at the Toronto International Film Festival before barely opening in theatres.\n\nThis episode, we look back at Phoenix’s Best Actor campaign for Walk the Line and the I’m Still Here shenanigans that would begin the more definitive stage of his career. We also discuss Connelly’s post-Oscar career stuck in wife roles that underserve her abilities and director Terry George’s underwhelming filmography after the success of Hotel Rwanda.\n\nTopics also include the goofy Hollywood Film Awards, Oscar’s love of stories about family tragedies, and Lifetime’s daytime talk show Attitudes."
