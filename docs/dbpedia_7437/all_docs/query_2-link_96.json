Actions are decided with an adaptive management strategy that continually monitors, evaluates, and refines solutions toward best possible outcomes.\n\nVehicle reservations are not required for any other areas of the park, or for visitors who enter the area by foot, bike, or taxi. Cadillac is not served by the Island Explorer bus system.\n\nVisitors must have a park entrance pass to enter the park in addition to purchasing a vehicle reservation for Cadillac Summit Road.
