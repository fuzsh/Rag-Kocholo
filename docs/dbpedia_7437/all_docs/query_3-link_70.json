He takes out his vengeance on the poor victims that find their way into his practice.\n\nRuffalo had a small role in the film as Steve Landers, the manager of one of Feinstone's patients.\n\nCritics tore the horror flick apart, saying that it essentially served as \"torture porn\" that inflicted almost as much pain on the audience as it did on the characters.\n\n\"Painful to watch, in more ways than one,\" Alex Sandell wrote for Juicy Cerebellum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played Adam Stanton in \"All the King's Men\" (2006).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 11%\n\nSummary: Based on the novel by the same name, \"All the King's Men\" is a political drama that centers on Southern politician Willie Stark (Sean Penn). As he builds a platform on a thin stack of promises, they collapse beneath him with his growing power.\n\nRuffalo had a supporting role in the film as Adam Stanton, Willie's friend, and eventual rival.\n\nLacking rhythm and engaging characters in critics' eyes, \"All the King's Men\" was received as a limp political drama that was more disappointing than thought-provoking.\n\n\"A Louisiana swamp of overacting and muddled plotlines sinks this cumbersome new version of Robert Penn Warren's political thriller,\" Peter Bradshaw wrote for The Guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"View from the Top\" (2003), he was Ted Stewart.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 14%\n\nSummary: In \"View from the Top,\" Donna (Gwyneth Paltrow) tries to expand her worldview by becoming a flight attendant and moving far away from her small town in Nevada. But handsome law student Ted Stewart (Ruffalo) makes her rethink her plans.\n\nWith a seemingly shallow cast of characters and a predictable plot, \"View from the Top\" went nowhere but down according to critics.\n\n\"The characters have no wit or charm, the plot has no conflict or development, nothing happens for any reason other than script requirements,\" Rex Reed wrote for The Observer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played Ricko in the disco drama \"54\" (1998).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 15%\n\nSummary: \"54\" is a dramatic look back on the disco era that follows 19-year-old Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe) as he rises through the ranks of Studio 54 in one summer.\n\nRuffalo had a small role in the film as Shane's friend Ricko.\n\nCritics wished that the director of \"54\" had handled the interesting subject better.\n\n\"A more critical and resonant Hollywood movie about the glorious disco culture screams to be made,\" wrote Emanuel Levy for Variety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRuffalo played Jeff Daly in the romantic comedy \"Rumor Has It\" (2005).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 21%\n\nSummary: While in town for her sister's wedding, Sarah Huttinger (Jennifer Aniston) realizes that her family may have been the inspiration for the movie \"The Graduate,\" which leads her to question her relationship with her mother, grandmother, and her boyfriend Jeff (Ruffalo).\n\nCritics found the premise intriguing but felt like the film didn't follow through, ultimately leaving them disappointed.\n\n\"A scantily clad premise that would at best have been a light-hearted farce goes in search of a heart-tugging denouement and doesn't find it,\" Susan Walker wrote for the Toronto Star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played Pappas in \"Windtalkers\" (2002).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 33%\n\nSummary: Set during World War II, \"Windtalkers\" centers on Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) as he returns to active duty after a brutal battle wipes out his entire squad.\n\nRuffalo had a supporting role in the film as Corporal Milo Pappas.\n\nCritics admitted the history behind the story was interesting, but the film itself lacked originality and insight.\n\n\"The energy and conviction of the action sequences don't quite compensate for 'Windtalkers'' emotional cliches and historical heedlessness,\" Richard Schickel wrote for Time Magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Sympathy for Delicious\" (2011), he was Father Joe.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 33%\n\nSummary: In the dramatic comedy \"Sympathy for Delicious,\" Dean O'Dwyer (Christopher Thornton) works as a DJ in the Los Angeles music scene until a motorcycle accident leaves him paralyzed. O'Dwyer is then approached by Father Joe (Ruffalo) who offers to help him through faith-healing, which leads Dean to discover some otherworldly healing powers.\n\nCritics said Ruffalo, who also directed the film, showed moments of promise as a new director. But overall, critics agreed that his effort couldn't save an incoherent story.\n\n\"Despite the powerful sense of place, 'Sympathy for Delicious' unwinds a narrative thread that grows increasingly tattered and flimsy,\" Sheri Linden wrote for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the film \"In the Cut\" (2003), he was Detective Malloy.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 34%\n\nSummary: In the thriller \"In the Cut,\" NYU professor Frannie (Meg Ryan) begins an affair with a local detective Giovanni Malloy (Ruffalo) as he investigates a string of gruesome murders in their neighborhood.\n\nAlthough \"In the Cut\" was visually engaging, critics realized that there was little substance beneath the shine.\n\n\"Beneath its dense texture and rich mood, Jane Campion's romantic thriller is about nothing and goes nowhere,\" Christy Lemire wrote for the Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe returned as Dylan Rhodes in \"Now You See Me 2\" (2016).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 34%\n\nSummary: In \"Now You See Me 2,\" magicians Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), J.

Coming to his aid, his wife (Julianne Moore) pretends to be blind in order to help the group escape from a psychiatric hospital.\n\nThe top-notch cast tried to elevate an unconvincing story, but many critics weren't won over.\n\n\"His actors do their best, and Moore certainly remains a powerhouse presence whenever she's on camera,\" Kevin Maher wrote for The Times. \"But mostly they struggle to be seen beneath the leaden messages.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe starred as Dylan Rhodes in \"Now You See Me\" (2013).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 50%\n\nSummary: In \"Now You See Me,\" a group of magicians — J. Daniel (Eisenberg), Merritt (Harrelson), Jack (Franco), and Henley (Isla Fisher) — attempt to pull off their biggest trick yet as FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) tails them.\n\nUnderneath the razzle-dazzle of magic stunts, \"Now You See Me\" began to unravel toward the end, according to critics.\n\n\"With a talented cast and a twisty bit of storytelling, this is an adequate bit of entertainment that is enjoyable in the moment — even if it is rather implausible if you think about it,\" Michael Compton wrote for the Bowling Green Daily News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRuffalo was Adam in \"Thanks for Sharing\" (2013).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 50%\n\nSummary: In the romantic drama \"Thanks for Sharing,\" Adam (Ruffalo), Neil (Josh Gad), and Dede (Pink) try to navigate dating in New York City while also attending group therapy for sex addiction.\n\nThe dialogue may have lacked inspiration or wit, but the electric cast softened the more glaring flaws in \"Thanks for Sharing.\"\n\n\"At least most of the cast is appealing, with Mark Ruffalo, Gwyneth Paltrow, Josh Gad, and Alecia Moore (better known as pop singer Pink) delivering the uninspired dialogue with relative finesse,\" wrote Ben Sachs for the Chicago Reader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"The Last Castle\" (2001), he played Yates.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 52%\n\nSummary: In the action-packed drama \"The Last Castle,\" disgraced military General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford) goes head to head with prison warden Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini) as Irwin's inmates rally around him.\n\nRuffalo had a supporting role in the film as Irwin's fellow prison inmate Clifford Yates.\n\nWith a winding plot and bizarre character choices, \"The Last Castle\" left critics divided.\n\nMoira MacDonald wrote for The Seatle Times, \"'The Last Castle,' while engrossing in parts, might have benefited from more pre-shooting talk about what makes an intriguing character — and what makes a star performance.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played David in \"Just Like Heaven\" (2005).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 54%\n\nSummary: In the romantic comedy \"Just Like Heaven,\" young medical student Elizabeth (Reese Witherspoon) dies suddenly in a car accident. She begins haunting the apartment she once lived in and is peeved when a new tenant named David (Ruffalo) moves in, until they fall for each other.\n\nWhen they could put the conventional romantic comedy tropes aside, critics had fun with \"Just Like Heaven.\"\n\n\"It's corny, it's somewhat predictable, but it's also very sweet [and] funny,\" Richard Roeper wrote for Ebert and Roeper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Safe Men\" (1998), he was Frank.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 57%\n\nSummary: Set in Rhode Island, the action-comedy \"Safe Men\" follows singers Sam (Sam Rockwell) and Eddie (Steve Zahn) as they are mistaken for a pair of safecrackers and dragged into a string of heists by the Jewish mafia.\n\nRuffalo had a brief, comedic role in the film as Frank, one of the actual safecrackers.\n\nThough a few scenes gained laughs from critics, the crime comedy was largely received as overly ambitious.\n\n\"'Safe Men' frequently excels in its little touches while failing in the long run to generate much excitement,\" Bruce Feld wrote for Film Journal International.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played Alf Bowden in \"Ride With the Devil\" (1999).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 64%\n\nSummary: In filmmaker Ang Lee's revisionist drama \"Ride With the Devil,\" best friends Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) find themselves at odds during the American Civil War.\n\nRuffalo had a supporting role in \"Ride With the Devil\" as Unionist Alf Bowden.\n\nVisually rich in terms of setting and cinematography, the war drama lacked needed emotion from its leading characters in critics' eyes.\n\n\"Politically astute, visually breathtaking but emotionally inert,\" John Anderson wrote for Newsday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"We Don't Live Here Anymore\" (2004), he starred as Jack Linden.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 65%\n\nSummary: In the independent drama \"We Don't Live Here Anymore,\" Jack (Ruffalo) and Terry Linden (Laura Dern) befriend married couple Hank (Peter Krause) and Edith Evans (Naomi Watts). But that friendship turns to betrayal as an affair rips the couples apart.\n\nDespite the talented cast, the drama couldn't overcome what turned out to be a tired concept.\n\n\"Earnest, overbearing, and fully depressing, 'We Don't Live Here Anymore' features a quartet of fine performances that are somewhat undermined by the numbing, one-note tone of the entire enterprise,\" Tom Long wrote for The Detroit News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played Lee in \"My Life Without Me\" (2003).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 65%\n\nSummary: Faced with a terminal illness, overworked janitor Ann (Sarah Polley) sets out to complete a list of tasks before she dies, including finding a new wife for her husband Don (Scott Speedman), leaving behind a secure future for her daughters, and falling in love with a stranger named Lee (Ruffalo).\n\nThe plot's inherent sentimentality invited criticism from more cynical reviewers, but some felt that the movie rightfully indulged in all the emotional pains of facing death and illness.\n\nRex Reed wrote for The Observer, \"What saves 'My Life Without Me' from the status of a five-Kleenex weepie is the maturity of vision that permeates the writing and direction and shines through each performance.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"13 Going on 30\" (2004), he played Matt Flamhaff.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 65%\n\nSummary: Tormented by her middle school peers, 13-year-old Jenna (Christa B. Allen) wishes she was older, and suddenly wakes up in the body of her 30-year-old self (Jennifer Garner). Seeking familiarity in a strange new world, Jenna finds comfort in her childhood best friend Matty (Ruffalo) who's engaged to someone else.\n\nDespite treading territory already covered in the comedy \"Big,\" the rom-com won critics over with Garner's fun-loving, lead performance.\n\n\"A rehash of familiar material, but the engaging Garner is charismatic enough to make it magical,\" Kam Williams wrote for Princeton Town Topics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRuffalo was Brian in \"What Doesn't Kill You\" (2008).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 66%\n\nSummary: The drama \"What Doesn't Kill You\" tells the story of Brian Reilly (Ruffalo) and Paulie McDougan (Ethan Hawke), childhood friends who grew up to become criminals in South Boston's Irish mafia. As Brian tries to turn his life around, Paulie offers him an escape.\n\nFormulaic and oftentimes predictable, \"What Doesn't Kill You\" was salvaged by incredible acting performances, according to critics.\n\n\"The overfamiliarity of 'What Doesn't Kill You' is redeemed by a full-scale performance from Mark Ruffalo,\" Peter Rainer wrote for The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRuffalo was in \"The Last Big Thing\" (1996).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 67%\n\nSummary: On the outer rim of Los Angeles, Simon Geist (Dan Zukovic) and his girlfriend Darla (Susan Heimbeinder) use a fake magazine he dubs \"The Next Big Thing\" to insult rising stars and talents in Hollywood through strategic interviews.\n\nRuffalo appeared in the independent drama as Brent Benedict, a troubled TV star.\n\nA handful of critics felt like the satire missed the mark, but \"The Last Big Thing\" earned praise from most for standing out as a unique indie hit from the late 1990s.\n\n\"The two [leads] are strangely resilient, and so is the film, a gem from an era of manufactured cult items,\" A.S. Hamrah wrote for N + 1 magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor appeared in \"The Adam Project\" (2022).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 67%\n\nSummary: In \"The Adam Project,\" a time-traveling pilot named Adam (Ryan Reynolds) teams up with his 12-year-old self (Walker Scobell) to make things right with their late father (Ruffalo).\n\nAlthough critics were somewhat split, most found the family-friendly film engaging and well-performed.\n\nWendy Ide wrote for The Observer, \"The high-concept plot is held together more by force of will (and some decent special effects) than by logic, but the core of this engaging, kid-friendly Netflix production is a big-hearted tale of broken families made good.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"The Brothers Bloom\" (2009), he was Stephen.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 68%\n\nSummary: In the crime comedy \"The Brothers Bloom,\" brothers Stephen (Ruffalo) and Bloom (Adrien Brody) attempt to pull off one last con by tricking an eccentric millionaire (Rachel Weisz) into giving them her money.\n\nCritics had a blast with \"The Brothers Bloom,\" even if they had to suspend a degree of realism.\n\n\"Writer-director Rian Johnson, following up his witty 2005 debut, the high school noir 'Brick,' has a real gift for putting his own modern stamp on time-tested genres,\" Kelly Jane Torrance wrote for The Washington Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played Chuck Aule in \"Shutter Island\" (2010).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 68%\n\nSummary: In director Martin Scorsese's dramatic thriller \"Shutter Island,\" federal marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck (Ruffalo) team up to investigate the disappearance of a patient at a mental asylum on a secluded island.\n\nSome critics were caught off guard by the surreal storytelling choices and twists, but \"Shutter Island\" earned mostly positive praise for Scorsese's masterful direction.\n\n\"'Shutter Island' is too long and its increasingly surreal tone provides an ending that's a bit of a cheat,\" Derek Malcolm wrote for the London Evening Standard. \"But, since it is a Scorsese picture, there's a lot to intrigue on the way.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had a supporting role in \"Where the Wild Things Are\" (2009).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 73%\n\nSummary: In the adventure film \"Where the Wild Things Are,\" a lonely little boy named Max (Max Records) uses his imagination to run away to a fantastical world where he finds an island filled with creatures dubbed \"Wild Things.\"\n\nRuffalo made an appearance as Max's mother's (Catherine Keener) boyfriend.\n\nPropelled by director Spike Jonze's singular directing style, \"Where the Wild Things Are\" was praised for its originality, even if it proved a little derivative.\n\n\"It's all very charming and quirky ... But it's also, ultimately, a little flimsy and unlikely to achieve anything like the iconic status of its source material,\" Wendy Ide wrote for The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played Maretti in \"Margaret\" (2011).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 75%\n\nSummary: In the drama \"Margaret,\" teenager Lisa Cohen (Anna Paquin) plays a vital role in a traffic accident that leaves her reeling. Unsure of what to do and consumed by guilt, Lisa lies to protect a bus driver named Maretti (Ruffalo).\n\nAlthough the plot proved a little unwieldy, critics praised \"Margaret\" as an emotionally moving, beautifully acted drama.\n\n\"'Margaret' is less about plot mechanics than about the virtuosity of the dialogue, the complexity of the characters, and the detail and depth of their untidy world,\" Nicholas Barber wrote for the Independent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRuffalo portrayed Bruce Banner in \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" (2015).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 76%\n\nSummary: In an effort to keep the world safe from outside influence, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) develops a peacekeeping program named Ultron that backfires and takes on a mind of its own. As Ultron creates danger on a global level, Tony and the rest of the Avengers, including Bruce Banner (Ruffalo), leap into action.\n\nThough not as universally successful as \"The Avengers,\" the sequel still proved to be an exciting thrill ride for most viewers.\n\n\"[Joss]Whedon delivers an uneven, if entertaining second installment that, like many superheroes, has both great strengths and hidden weaknesses,\" wrote Leslie Combemale for Cinema Siren.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Captain Marvel\" (2019), Ruffalo made a cameo in the end credits.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 79%\n\nSummary: \"Captain Marvel\" serves as the thrilling origin story for pilot Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), who becomes one of the most powerful superheroes in the universe after being charged by an infinity stone.\n\nRuffalo appears as Bruce Banner in the film's credit scene.\n\nOrigin stories are typically panned by critics for their drawn-out plots, and the same is the case for \"Captain Marvel.\" However, many still conceded that it was an engaging and entertaining film.\n\nAnthony Lane wrote for The New Yorker, \"Superhero cinema has lectured us, ad infinitum, on the responsibility that is conferred by extraordinary gifts. Praise be to Larson, for reminding us that they can be bringers of fun.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRuffalo appeared again in the end credits of \"Iron Man 3\" (2013).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 79%\n\nSummary: In \"Iron Man 3,\" Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is dealing with PTSD and insomnia after saving the world from Loki's wrath. But he has to piece his world back together once again after the evil villain Mandarin tears everything apart.\n\nRuffalo appears in the end credits of the film as Bruce Banner.\n\nMost critics agreed that the movie was a nice ending for fans of the series, but it wasn't anything spectacular as a stand-alone film.\n\n\"'Iron Man 3' has good things in it, enough to please the series' fans — and yet too many drawbacks to win many converts,\" wrote Mick LaSalle for the San Fransico Chronicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor voiced Jerry Rubin in the documentary \"Chicago 10\" (2008).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 80%\n\nSummary: A combination of archival footage and animation, the documentary \"Chicago 10\" depicts confrontations between police and protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention (DNC). It also follows the group of individuals who were later charged with conspiracy and incitement of a riot for their roles in the DNC protests.\n\nIn the documentary, Ruffalo voiced Jerry Rubin, working alongside actors like Hank Azaria and Jeffrey Wright.\n\nTold through a compilation of various mediums, \"Chicago 10\" was described as a unique and insightful documentary.\n\nRoger Moore wrote for the Orlando Sentinel, \"'Chicago 10' is that nearly perfect marriage of style — edgy, different — to documentary subject: 1968, that seminal year so celebrated in 2008 for changing the America that came after it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Infinitely Polar Bear\" (2015), he played Cam.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 82%\n\nSummary: In the family drama \"Infinitely Polar Bear,\" father and husband Cam (Ruffalo) grapples with bipolar disorder. As his wife Maggie (Zoe Saldana) attends business school in New York, Cam takes on a bigger role in his daughters' lives as he tries to balance his mental wellness.\n\nWritten with bold, autobiographical strokes and carried by Ruffalo's strong lead performance, \"Infinitely Polar Bear\" was a family drama with warmth and wisdom, according to critics.\n\n\"Ruffalo gives one of the most appealing performances I've seen from an actor in recent years,\" M.
