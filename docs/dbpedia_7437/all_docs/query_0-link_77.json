        "text": "Employers should check this online version of the handbook periodically for updates. Printing does not allow access to helpful links or updates to this handbook.\n\nGuidance for Completing Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification Form) | Current as of July 2023\n\nHow to Download Our Manuals in PDF (PDF)\n\n1.0 Why Employers Must Verify Employment Authorization and Identity of New Employees\n\nIn 1986, Congress reformed U.S. immigration laws to preserve the tradition of legal immigration while seeking to close the door to unlawful entry. The employer sanctions provisions, found in section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), were added by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). These provisions further changed with the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990 and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996.\n\nEmployment is often the magnet that attracts people to reside in the United States unlawfully. The purpose of the employer sanctions law is to remove this magnet by requiring employers to hire only individuals who may legally work here: U.S. citizens, noncitizen nationals, lawful permanent residents, and other noncitizens who are authorized to work. To comply with the law, employers must:\n\nVerify the identity and employment authorization of each person they hire;\n\nComplete and retain a Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, for each employee; and\n\nRefrain from discriminating against individuals on the basis of national origin, citizenship or immigration status.\n\nAt the same time that it created employer sanctions, Congress also prohibited employment discrimination based on citizenship, immigration status, and national origin. This part of the law is referred to as the anti-discrimination provisions. See Section 11.0, Unlawful Discrimination and Penalties for Prohibited Practices, for more information on unlawful discrimination.\n\nThe guidance in this handbook, in tandem with the Form I-9 instructions, helps employers properly complete Form I-9, which assists in verifying that your employees are authorized to work in the United States. You must complete a Form I-9 for every new employee you hire after Nov. 6, 1986, as well as new employees hired in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) on or after Nov. 28, 2009. This includes U.S. citizens and noncitizen nationals who are automatically eligible for employment in the United States.\n\nYou must use the current version of Form I-9, which you can download along with the instructions from the USCIS website at uscis.gov/i-9-central. You may also order paper forms at uscis.gov/forms/forms-by-mail or by calling the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 (TTY: 800-767-1833).\n\nThe form consists of five parts:\n\nSection 1: Employee Information and Attestation: Employees must complete and sign this section. See Section 3.0 of this handbook for more information.\n\nSection 2: Employer Review and Verification: Employers or their authorized representative(s) must complete this section. See Section 4.0 of this handbook for more information.\n\nLists of Acceptable Documents: Employers must ensure every employee completing Form I-9 has access to this list. Employers are not required to store this page.\n\nSupplement A, Preparer and/or Translator Certification for Section 1: Any person who helps the employee complete Form I-9 must complete the blocks in this supplement. See Section 3.0 of this handbook for more information. If the employee does not require assistance, employers need not print this page.\n\nSupplement B, Reverification and Rehire (formerly Section 3): Employers or their authorized representative(s) complete the blocks of this supplement when an employee requires reverification, or is rehired and the employer chooses not to complete a new Form I-9. Employers only need to print this page for an employee when reverification or rehire applies. See Section 6.0 of this handbook for more information.\n\nForm I-9 is available in English and Spanish. Employers in the United States, except Puerto Rico, must complete the English-language version of Form I-9. Only employers located in Puerto Rico may complete the Spanish-language version of Form I-9 instead of the English-language version. Any employer may use the Spanish-language form and instructions as a translation tool for Spanish-speaking employees, when completing the English-language version.\n\n1.1 The Homeland Security Act\n\nThe Homeland Security Act of 2002 created an executive department combining numerous federal agencies with a mission dedicated to homeland security. On March 1, 2003, the authorities of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) were transferred to three new agencies in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS):\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS);\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); and\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nThe two DHS immigration components most involved with the matters discussed in this handbook are USCIS and ICE. USCIS issues most employment authorization documentation for noncitizens and administers Form I-9 and E-Verify, which electronically confirms employment eligibility. ICE enforces the penalty provisions of section 274A of the INA as well as other immigration requirements within the United States.\n\nUnder the Homeland Security Act, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) retained certain responsibilities related to Form I-9 as well. In particular, the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division enforces the anti-discrimination provision in section 274B of the INA, while the Executive Oﬀice for Immigration Review (EOIR) administratively adjudicates cases under sections 274A, 274B, and 274C (civil document fraud) of the INA.\n\n1.2 E-Verify: The Web-Based Verification Companion to Form I-9\n\nForm I-9 has been the foundation of the employment eligibility verification process since 1986, when employers began verifying the employment authorization and identity of new hires under IRCA. To improve the accuracy and integrity of this process, USCIS operates an electronic employment eligibility confirmation system called E-Verify.\n\nE-Verify is a web-based system that allows employers and other participants to confirm the eligibility of their newly hired employees to work in the U.S. by electronically matching information on the employee’s Form I-9 against records available to the Social Security Administration (SSA) and DHS. E-Verify is free and is available to participants in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nEmployers who participate in E-Verify must still complete a Form I-9 for each newly hired employee in the United States. E-Verify participants may accept any document or combination of documents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents on Form I-9, but if the employee chooses to present a List B and C combination, the List B (identity only) document must have a photograph. Employees must also provide their Social Security number in Section 1 of the Form I-9 if their employer is enrolled in E-Verify.\n\nIf you participate in E-Verify, after completing a Form I-9 for your new employee, you must create a case in E-Verify that includes information from Sections 1 and 2 of the employee’s Form I-9. After creating the case, you will receive a response from E-Verify regarding the employment authorization of the employee. In some cases, E-Verify will provide a response indicating a Tentative Nonconfirmation (mismatch). This does not necessarily mean the employee is unauthorized to work in the United States. Rather, it means that E-Verify is unable to immediately confirm the employee’s authorization to work in the United States. In the case of a mismatch, you must notify the employee. If the employee wishes to take action to resolve a mismatch, the employee should contact the appropriate agency (DHS and/or the SSA) within the prescribed time period stated in the Referral Date Confirmation that you will provide to the employee, and as described in the E-Verify User Manual.\n\nWhen using E-Verify, participating employers must also follow certain procedures that were designed to protect employees from unfair employment actions:\n\nYou must use E-Verify for all new hires, both U.S. citizens and noncitizens, and may not use the system selectively.\n\nYou may not use E-Verify to prescreen applicants for employment, check employees hired before you became a participant in E-Verify (except contractors with a federal contract that requires use of E-Verify), or reverify employees who have temporary employment authorization.\n\nYou may not terminate or take other adverse action against an employee based on a mismatch.\n\nE-Verify strengthens the Form I-9 employment eligibility verification process that all employers, by law, must follow. By adding E-Verify to the existing Form I-9 process, participants can benefit from knowing that they have taken an additional step toward maintaining a legal workforce.\n\nFor more information about E-Verify, including enrollment, visit e-verify.gov or contact E-Verify at 888-464-4218.\n\nFederal Contractors\n\nOn Nov. 14, 2008, the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council issued a final rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (FAR case 2007-013, Employment Eligibility Verification). The regulation requires contractors with a federal contract that contains the FAR E-Verify clause to use E-Verify for their new hires and all employees (existing and new) assigned to the contract (48 C.F.R., Subpart 22.18). Federal contracts issued on or after Sept. 8, 2009, as well as older contracts that have been modified may contain the FAR E-Verify clause.\n\nFederal contractors who have a federal contract that contains the FAR E-Verify clause must follow special rules when completing and updating Form I-9. For more information, please see the E-Verify Supplemental Guide for Federal Contractors available at e-verify.gov.\n\nEmployers Who Use Alternative Procedures to Examine Form I-9 Documentation\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security issued a final rule, effective August 1, 2023, which allows the Secretary to authorize alternative procedures for examining the documents employees must present to complete Form I-9. On the same date through a Federal Register Notice, the Secretary made effective Optional Alternative 1 to the Physical Document Examination Associated with Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9). This alternative procedure allows employers who are enrolled in E-Verify and complete certain steps to remotely examine Form I-9 documents. For more information, please see Section 4.0: Completing Section 2 of Form I-9, I-9 Central and E-Verify.gov\n\n2.0 Who Must Complete Form I-9\n\nYou must complete Form I-9 each time you hire any person to perform labor or services in the United States in return for wages or other remuneration. Remuneration is anything of value given in exchange for labor or services, including food and lodging. The requirement to complete Form I-9 applies to new employees hired in the United States after Nov. 6, 1986, as well as new employees hired in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) on or after Nov. 28, 2009.\n\nEnsure the employee receives the instructions electronically or in print and completes Section 1 of Form I-9 at the time of hire. “Hire” means the beginning of employment in exchange for wages or other remuneration. The time of hire is noted on the form as the first day of employment. Employees may complete Section 1 before the time of hire, but not before the employer extends the job oﬀer and the employee accepts it. You may review the employee’s document(s) and fully complete Section 2 at any time from the date the employee accepts the job offer and completes Section 1 to within three business days from the date of hire. For example, if the employee begins employment on Monday, you must complete Section 2 by Thursday.\n\nYou may designate, hire, or contract with any person you choose to complete, update or make corrections to Section 2 or Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire, on your behalf, such as a member of the general public, personnel officers, foremen, agents, or notaries public. This person is known as your authorized representative. The authorized representative must perform all the employer duties described in the instructions and this handbook, and complete, sign and date Section 2 or Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire, on your behalf. You are liable for any violations in connection with the form or the verification process, including any violations committed by the authorized representative acting on your behalf.\n\nUSCIS does not require you to have a contract or other specific agreement with your authorized representative for Form I-9 purposes. If the employer chooses to use a notary public as an authorized representative, that person is not acting in the capacity of a notary. This person must perform the same required actions as an authorized representative, including signatures. When acting as an authorized representative, a notary public should not provide a notary seal on Form I-9.\n\nEmployees cannot act as authorized representatives for their own Form I-9. Therefore, employees cannot complete, update, or make corrections to Section 2 or Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire for themselves or attest to the authenticity of the documentation they present.\n\nIf an employee will work for less than three business days, Sections 1 and 2 must be fully completed at the time of hire (in other words, by the first day of employment).\n\nDo not complete Form I-9 for employees who are:\n\nHired on or before Nov. 6, 1986 (or on or before Nov. 27, 2009, in the CNMI), continuing in their employment, and have a reasonable expectation of employment at all times;\n\nEmployed for casual domestic work in a private home on a sporadic, irregular, or intermittent basis;\n\nIndependent contractors;\n\nEmployed by a contractor providing contract services (such as employee leasing or temporary agencies) and are providing labor to you; or\n\nNot physically working on U.S. soil.\n\nIf you are self-employed, you do not need to complete Form I-9 on your own behalf unless you are an employee of a separate business entity, such as a corporation or partnership. In that case, you and any other employees must complete Form I-9.\n\nNote: You cannot hire an individual who you know is not authorized to work in the United States.\n\n3.0 Completing Section 1: Employee Information and Attestation\n\nHave the employee complete Section 1 at the time of hire (by the first day the employee starts work for pay or other remuneration) by entering the correct information and signing and dating the form. If the employee enters the information by hand, ensure the employee prints clearly.\n\nA preparer and/or translator may help the employee complete Section 1. Employers must review the information and ensure employees (and their preparer/translators, if applicable) fully and properly completed Section 1.\n\nFigure 1a: Completing Section 1: Employee Information and Attestation\n\nEmployees must enter their current legal name and other last names that they have used in the past or present (such as a maiden name), if any.\n\nEmployees with two last names (family names) must include both names in the Last Name field.\n\nEmployees with only one name should enter it in the Last Name field and enter “Unknown” in the First Name field.\n\nEmployees with two first names (given names) should include both in the First Name field.\n\nEmployees whose first or last name includes a hyphen or apostrophe should include it.\n\nExamples of correctly entered last names include De La Cruz, O’Neill, Garcia Lopez, and Smith-Johnson.\n\nExamples of correctly entered first names include Mary Jo, John-Paul, Tae Young, and D’Shaun.\n\nEmployees must enter their middle initial in the Middle Initial field. Employees who do not have a middle initial may leave this field blank.\n\nEmployees must enter their maiden name or any other legal last name they may have used in the Other Last Names Used field. Employees who have not used other last names may leave this field blank.\n\nEmployees must enter their current address, apartment number (if any), city or town, state and ZIP code. If the residence is not located in a city or town, enter the village, county, township, reservation, etc. in the City or Town Field. Employees who do not have a street address should enter a description of the location of their residence, such as “Two miles south of I-81, near the water tower.” Employees who have no apartment number may leave this field blank. Border commuters from Canada or Mexico may enter their city; province or state; postal code; and their country abbreviation.\n\nEmployees must enter their date of birth as a two-digit month, two-digit day, and four-digit year (mm/dd/yyyy) in this field. For example, Jan. 8, 1980, should be entered as 01/08/1980.\n\nEmployees may voluntarily provide their Social Security number or leave this field blank. However, if you are enrolled in E-Verify, your employees must provide their Social Security number.\n\nEmployees who have not yet received their Social Security number and who can satisfy all other Form I-9 requirements may work while awaiting their Social Security number. Have them enter their Social Security number in Section 1 as soon as they receive it.\n\nYou cannot ask employees to provide a specific document with their Social Security number on it. To do so may constitute unlawful discrimination. For more information on E-Verify, see Section 1.2, E-Verify: The Web-Based Verification Companion to Form I-9. For more information on unlawful discrimination, see Section 11.0, Unlawful Discrimination and Penalties for Prohibited Practices.\n\nEmployees are not required to provide an email address or telephone number in Section 1. If they do not wish to enter an e-mail address or telephone number, they may leave these fields blank.\n\nEmployees must read the warning about penalties under federal law and attest to their citizenship or immigration status by checking one of the following boxes on the form:\n\nA citizen of the United States.\n\nA noncitizen national of the United States: An individual born in American Samoa, certain former citizens of the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and certain children of noncitizen nationals born abroad.\n\nA lawful permanent resident: This specific immigration status describes an individual who is not a U.S. citizen and who resides in the United States under legally recognized and lawfully recorded permanent residence as an immigrant. This term includes conditional residents, who should select this status. Employees who select this box should enter their seven- to nine-digit Alien Registration Number (A-Number) or USCIS Number in the space provided. The USCIS Number is the same as the A-Number without the “A” prefix. Asylees and refugees should NOT select this status, but should instead select “A noncitizen authorized to work.”\n\nA noncitizen (other than Item Numbers 2 or 3 above) authorized to work: An individual who is permitted to work in the United States, but is not a citizen or national of the United States, or a lawful permanent resident. For example, asylees, refugees, and certain citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or Palau should select this status. Employees who select box 4 must also enter the date their employment authorization expires. If it does not expire, the employee should enter N/A. If the employee’s employment authorization has been automatically extended, they should enter the expiration date of the automatic extension. Employees must also enter one of the following: Alien Registration Number (A-Number)/USCIS Number; Form I-94 Admission Number; or Foreign Passport Number and the Country of Issuance.\n\nEmployees must sign and date the form. Employees who cannot sign their name may place a mark in this field to indicate their signature.\n\nIf the employee uses a preparer and/or translator to help them complete and/or translate the form, each preparer and/or translator must complete a separate Preparer and/or Translator Certification block in Supplement A, Preparer and/or Translator Certification for Section 1.\n\nFigure 1b: Completing Supplement A: Preparer and/or Translator Certification for Section 1\n\nPreparers and/or translators may not enter a P.O. box in place of a physical address.\n\nEmployees who use a preparer and/or translator to complete the form must still sign or make their mark in the Signature Field in Section 1.\n\nEmployers may provide the employee additional supplement pages as needed and attach them to the employee’s completed form.\n\nThe certification must also be completed for certain minors and employees in special placement who require a representative, parent, or legal guardian to complete Section 1 for them. See Sections 4.2 and 4.3 for more information.\n\nYou must ensure that all parts of Form I-9 are properly completed; or you may be subject to penalties under federal law. The employee must complete Section 1 no later than the employee’s first day of employment. You may not ask an individual who has not accepted a job oﬀer to complete Section 1. Before completing Section 2, you should review Section 1 to ensure the employee completed it properly. You may review the employee’s document(s) and fully complete Section 2 at any time between the date the employee accepts the job offer and completes Section 1 to within three business days of the hire. Review any possible errors with the employee. The employee must correct any confirmed errors, add their initials, and the date they made the correction. Employers may not ask for documentation to verify the information entered in Section 1.\n\n4.0 Completing Section 2: Employer Review and Verification\n\nWithin three business days of the date employment begins, you or your authorized representative must complete Section 2 by examining original, acceptable, and unexpired documentation, or an acceptable receipt, the employee presents (see Table 1: Special Form I-9 Situations) to determine if it reasonably appears to be genuine and relates to the person presenting it. For example, if an employee begins employment on Monday, you must review the employee’s documentation and complete Section 2 on or before Thursday of that week. However, if you hire someone for less than three business days, you must complete Section 2 no later than the first day of employment.\n\nIn general, you or your authorized representative must review the employee’s documentation in their physical presence. However, if you participate in E-Verify, you may also be eligible to remotely examine the employee’s documents under the alternative procedure authorized by the secretary of homeland security. To see if you are eligible and for further guidance, please see Section 4.5, Remote Document Examination (Optional Alternative Procedure to Physical Document Examination), as well as I-9 Central and E-Verify.gov.\n\nYou must allow the employee to choose which documentation they will present from the Form I-9 Lists of Acceptable Documents and must accept documentation that reasonably appears to be genuine and relates to the person presenting it. You cannot specify which documentation an employee will present from the Form I-9 Lists of Acceptable Documents. When physically examining documents, copies, except for certified copies of birth certificates, are not acceptable. See Section 4.5, Remote Document Examination (Optional Alternative Procedure to Physical Document Examination) requirements.\n\nYou may terminate an employee who fails to present acceptable documentation (or an acceptable receipt for a document) within three business days after the date employment begins. If you fail to properly complete Form I-9, you risk violating section 274A of the INA and may be subject to civil money penalties.\n\nEmployees may choose to present either: 1) one document selected from List A or 2.) a combination of one selection from List B and one selection from List C.\n\nList A documentation shows both identity and employment authorization. Some documentation must be presented together to be considered acceptable List A documentation. If an employee presents acceptable List A documentation, do not ask them to present List B or List C documentation.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, USCIS may automatically extend an employee’s employment authorization and/or employment authorization document beyond the expiration date on the document. An automatically extended document is considered unexpired for Form I-9. See Section 5.0, Automatic Extensions of Employment Authorization and/or Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) in Certain Circumstances.\n\nList B documentation shows identity only and List C documentation shows employment authorization only. If an employee presents acceptable List B and List C documentation, do not ask them to present List A documentation.\n\nIf you participate in E-Verify, and the employee presents a combination of List B and List C documentation, then the List B document must contain a photograph. For more information, visit e-verify.gov.\n\nTable 1 Special Form I-9 Situations\n\nSpecial Situation\n\nSolution\n\nAdditional M-274 Guidance\n\nEmployee presents a Social Security Card containing one of the following restrictions:\n\nVALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION\n\nNOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT\n\nVALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH INS AUTHORIZATION\n\nBecause the restricted Social Security Card is not an acceptable List C document, ask the employee to provide a different document from List C or List A.\n\nSection 13\n\nEmployee is a minor (individuals under age 18) and is unable to present an identity document from List B.\n\nMinor’s parent or legal guardian establishes identity for the minor by completing Section 1 on minor’s behalf and completing a Preparer and/or Translator Certification block in Supplement A.\n\nMinor must then only present an employment authorization document from List C.\n\nSection 4.2 Minors (Individuals under Age 18)\n\nEmployee who has a physical or mental impairment is placed in a job by a nonprofit organization, association, or as part of a rehabilitation program (special placement) and is unable to present an identity document for List B.\n\nRepresentative of the nonprofit organization, association, or rehabilitation program; parent; or legal guardian establishes identity for this employee by completing Section 1 on the employee’s behalf and completing a Preparer and/or Translator Certification. Employee must then only present an employment authorization document from List C.\n\nSection 4.3 Employees with Disabilities (Special Placement)\n\nEmployee has an expired EAD and/or employment authorization but qualifies for an automatic extension of employment authorization and/or Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by a Federal Register notice (FRN), a regulation, a Form I-797 or I-797C receipt notice, an individual letter/notice or a website notice.\n\nAn EAD automatically extended by FRN or notice is an unexpired List A document for Form I-9. For more information on what the employee must present along with their EAD to complete Form I-9, please see Section 5.\n\nSection 5 Automatic Extensions of Employment Authorization and/or Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) in Certain Circumstances\n\nEmployee presents an acceptable receipt in place of an unexpired List A, B, or C document.\n\nSee Table 2 to determine how long each receipt is valid and what documents the employee must show once the receipt expires.\n\nSection 4.4 Acceptable Receipts\n\nFigure 2: Section 2: Employer or Authorized Representative Review and Verification\n\nWhen completing Section 2, use information from the documentation the employee presented to enter the document title, issuing authority, document number, and expiration date (if any) in Section 2:\n\nEnter List A documents in the column on the left. If the employee presents List A documentation that consists of multiple documents, use the second and third List A areas, as well as the Additional Information area, if necessary, to enter those other documents. If you enter documents in the List A columns, you should leave the List B and C columns blank.\n\nEnter List B documents in the center column. If you enter a document in this column, you must also enter a document in the List C column. Leave the List A column blank.\n\nEnter List C documents in the column on the right. If the employee presents a List C document that consists of multiple documents, use the Additional Information area to enter those other documents. If you enter a document in this column, you must also enter a document in the List B column. Leave the List A column blank.\n\nYou may use either common abbreviations for states, document titles or issuing authorities, such as “DL” for driver’s license and “SSA” for Social Security Administration. Appendix A provides more abbreviation suggestions.\n\nThe “Additional Information” space is for Form I-9 notes, such as:\n\nNotations that describe extensions of employment authorization or a document’s expiration date for individuals in certain nonimmigrant categories or granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS). For more information, see Section 5.0, Automatic Extensions of Employment Authorization and/or Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) in Certain Circumstances, and Section 7, Evidence of Employment Authorization for Certain Categories.\n\nInformation from additional documents that F-1 or J-1 nonimmigrant employees may present including the Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) number and the program end date from Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, or DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status, as required.\n\nReplacement document information if a receipt was previously presented.\n\nDiscrepancies that E-Verify participants must notate when participating in the IMAGE program.\n\nAny other optional comments or notations necessary for your business process, such as employee termination dates, form retention dates, and E-Verify case verification numbers.\n\nEnter the first day of employment for wages or other remuneration in the space for “The employee’s first day of employment (mm/dd/yyyy).” Recruiters and referrers for a fee do not enter the employee’s first day of employment.\n\nStaﬀing agencies may choose to use either the date an employee is assigned to the employee’s first job or the date the new employee is entered into the assignment pool as the first day of employment.\n\nThe same person who examined the employee’s documents must also complete the fields in the certification block, then sign and date Section 2, as shown in Figure 2 above. The employer or authorized representative signs and dates Section 2 in the spaces provided to attest to examining the documents the employee presented. Also enter title, last name, first name, and the employer’s business or organization name.\n\nEnter the business’s physical street address, city or town, state, and ZIP code. If the location is not a city or town you may enter the name of the village, county, township, reservation, etc. that applies. Employers may not enter a P.O. box as their address. If your company has multiple locations, use the most appropriate address that identifies the location of the employer.\n\n4.1 Retaining Copies of Documents Your Employee Presents\n\nYou may make copies (or electronic images) of the documentation you reviewed, but must return original documentation to the employee. If you make copies, they should be made consistently for all new hires and reverified employees, regardless of national origin, citizenship, or immigration status, or you may violate anti-discrimination laws.\n\nEmployers participating in E-Verify are required to retain a copy of certain documents if the employee chooses to present them. These documents include the U.S. Passport, passport card, Permanent Resident Card (also called a Green Card), or Employment Authorization Document (EAD). If you are an E-Verify employer who chooses to copy documentation other than those you are required to copy for E-Verify, you should apply this policy consistently with respect to Form I-9 completion for all employees.\n\nIf you choose to remotely examine employees’ documents, you must retain clear and legible copies of the front and back (if two-sided) of ALL Form I-9 documentation an employee presents remotely with the employee’s Form I-9. For further guidance on remotely examining documents, please see Section 4.5, Remote Document Examination (Optional Alternative Procedure to Physical Document Examination), I-9 Central and E-Verify.gov.\n\nYou must always complete Section 2 by reviewing original documentation, even if you copy an employee’s document(s) after reviewing the documentation. You are still responsible for completing and retaining Form I-9.\n\nYou must retain copies and present them with Forms I-9 in case of an inspection by DHS, the Department of Labor or the Department of Justice.\n\n4.2 Minors (Individuals under Age 18)\n\nMinors can complete Form I-9 as described in Section 4.0, Completing Section 2 of Form I-9, by presenting a List A document or a combination of List B and C documents. If a minor is unable to present an identity document from List B, a parent or legal guardian may establish identity for the minor by completing Form I-9 as shown in Figures 3a and 3b.\n\nIf you participate in E-Verify, parents or legal guardians cannot establish identity for a minor as described above. The minor must present either a List A document, or a combination of a List B document that contains a photograph and a List C document.\n\nFigure 3a: Completing Section 1 of Form I-9 for Minors without List B Documents\n\nThe minor’s parent or legal guardian completes Section 1 and enters “Individual under age 18” in the signature block. The parent or legal guardian completes a Preparer and/or Translator Certification block on Supplement A: Preparer and/or Translator Certification for Section 1.\n\nFigure 3b: Completing Supplement A: Preparer and/or Translator Certification for Minors without List B Documents\n\nFigure 4: Completing Section 2 of Form I-9 for Minors without List B documents\n\nEnter “Individual under age 18” under List B and under List C, enter the document title, issuing authority, document number, and expiration date (if any) using information from the List C document the minor presented.\n\nEnter the date employment began.\n\nYou or your authorized representative signs and dates Section 2 in the spaces provided to attest to examining the documents the employee presented. Also enter your title, last name and first name, as well as the employer’s business or organization name.\n\nEnter the business’s street address, city or town, state and ZIP code.\n\n4.3 Employees with Disabilities (Special Placement)\n\nCertain employees may have a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of their major life activities and are placed in jobs by a nonprofit organization, association, or as part of a rehabilitation program. Employees in this category who present List A documentation, or a combination of List B and C documentation, must complete Form I-9 as described in Section 4.0, Completing Section 2: Employer Review and Verification. If these employees are unable to present a List B document, they may establish identity under List B similar to minors, as shown in Figures 5a and 5b. These employees must still present a List C document.\n\nIf you participate in E-Verify, representatives of a nonprofit organization, association, or rehabilitation program; parents; and legal guardians cannot establish identity for an employee with disabilities as described above. This employee must present either List A documentation, or a combination of a List B document that contains a photograph and a List C document.\n\nFigure 5a: Completing Section 1 of Form I-9 for Employees with Disabilities (Special Placement)\n\nThe representative of the nonprofit organization, association, or rehabilitation program; or the parent or legal guardian of the employee with a disability completes Section 1 and enters “Special Placement” in the Signature of Employee field and dates the form.\n\nFigure 5b: Completing Supplement A for Employees with Disabilities (Special Placement)\n\nThe same representative, parent, or legal guardian completes a Preparer and/or Translator Certification block on Supplement A: Preparer and/or Translator Certification for Section 1.\n\nFigure 6: Completing Section 2 of Form I-9 for Employees with Disabilities (Special Placement)\n\nEnter “Special Placement” under List B and under List C, enter the document title, issuing authority, document number, and expiration date (if any) using information from the List C document the employee presented.\n\nEnter the date employment began.\n\nYou or your authorized representative signs and dates Section 2 in the spaces provided to attest to examining the documents the employee presented. Whoever signs should also enter their title, last name, and first name, as well as the employer’s business or organization name.\n\nEnter the business’s street address, city or town, state, and ZIP code.\n\n4.4 Acceptable Receipts\n\nYou must accept a receipt in place of List A, B, or C documentation if the employee presents one, unless employment will last less than three business days. New employees who choose to present a receipt must do so within three business days after their first day of employment, or for reverification or existing employees, by the date that their employment authorization expires.\n\nTable 2 provides a list of acceptable receipts an employee can show. Enter the word “Receipt” followed by the title of the document in Section 2 under the list that relates to the receipt.\n\nWhen your employee presents the original replacement document, cross out the word “Receipt,” then enter the information from the new documentation into the Additional Information field in Section 2, and initial and date the change.\n\nAccepting a second receipt at the end of the initial receipt validity period is not permissible.\n\nTable 2 Acceptable Receipts\n\nThe departure portion of a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, with an unexpired refugee admission stamp or admission code of “RE.”\n\nRefugees\n\nList A\n\n90 days from date of hire or, for reverification, 90 days from the date employment authorization expires.\n\nAn unexpired Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766), or a combination of a valid List B document and an unrestricted Social Security card.\n\nThe arrival portion of a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, containing a temporary I-551 (otherwise known as the Alien Documentation, Identification and Telecommunication (ADIT)) stamp and photograph.\n\nLawful permanent residents\n\nList A\n\nUntil the expiration date of the temporary I-551 (ADIT) stamp, or if there is no expiration date, one year from date of admission.\n\nThe actual Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card, also known as a “Green Card.”\n\nA document that shows an employee applied to replace a lost, stolen, or damaged document.\n\nAll employees\n\nCan be List A, B, or C, depending on which document the receipt relates to.\n\n90 days from date of hire or, for reverification, 90 days from the date employment authorization expires.\n\nThe actual replacement document. You may also accept other Form I-9 documentation from the Lists of Acceptable Documents. If you accept documentation other than the actual replacement document, record the document information on Section 2 of a new Form I-9 and attach it to the original Form I-9.\n\nYou should also note in the Additional Information box on the new Form I-9 the reason that documentation other than the replacement document was presented – for example, document delays, changes in status, or other factors – and sign and date the note.\n\nIf the receipt is for a List A document but the employee cannot present the actual replacement List A document for which the receipt was issued by the end of the 90-day receipt period, then the employee may choose to present a different document from List A, or one document each from List B and List C to satisfy the Form I-9 requirements.\n\nIf the receipt is for a List B document but the employee cannot present the actual document by the end of the 90-day receipt period, then the employee may choose to present a document from List A instead, or a different List B document to satisfy the Form I-9 requirements.\n\nIf the receipt is for a List C document, and the employee does not provide the actual document, the employee can present a List A document or another List C document instead.\n\nUnexpired Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, containing a class of admission of UHP or OAR on the document or unexpired Form I-94 containing a class of admission of PAR and indicates Afghanistan as country of citizenship on the document\n\nCertain Parolees\n\nList A\n\n90 days (or when the I-94 expires, if less) from date of hire or, for reverification, the date employment authorization expires.\n\nAn unexpired Employment Authorization Document (EAD), or an unrestricted Social Security card and a List B identity document from the Form I-9 Lists of Acceptable Documents.\n\nAn unexpired Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record that contains a class of admission of DT issued between Feb. 24, 2022, and Sept. 30, 2023, and indicates Ukraine as the country of citizenship on the document\n\nUkrainian citizen parolees\n\nList A\n\n90 days (or when the I-94 expires, if less) from date of hire or, for reverification, the date employment authorization expires.\n\nAn unexpired Employment Authorization Document (EAD), or an unrestricted Social Security card and a List B identity document from the Form I-9 Lists of Acceptable Documents.\n\n4.5 Remote Document Examination (Optional Alternative Procedure to Physical Document Examination)\n\nEmployers who participate in E-Verify in good standing are qualified to remotely examine their employee’s documentation using a DHS-authorized alternative procedure at their E-Verify hiring sites. This includes the use of an authorized representative acting on your behalf, such as a third-party vendor. If you choose to offer the alternative procedure to new employees at an E-Verify hiring site, you must do so consistently for all employees at that site. However, you may choose to offer the alternative procedure for remote hires only but continue to apply physical examination procedures to all employees who work onsite or in a hybrid capacity, so long as you do not adopt such a practice for a discriminatory purpose or treat employees differently based on their citizenship, immigration status, or national origin, such as by deciding that certain employees are not eligible for remote examination of their documentation. To examine your employee’s documentation remotely, you must be enrolled in good standing in E-Verify, and complete the following steps:\n\nExamine copies (front and back, if the document is two-sided) of Form I-9 documents or an acceptable receipt to ensure that the documentation presented reasonably appears to be genuine;\n\nConduct a live video interaction with the individual presenting the document(s) to ensure that the documentation reasonably appears to be genuine and related to the individual. The employee must first transmit a copy of the document(s) to the employer (per Step 1 above) and then present the same document(s) during the live video interaction;\n\nIndicate on the Form I-9, by completing the corresponding box, that an alternative procedure was used to examine documentation to complete Section 2 or for reverification in Supplement B, as applicable; and\n\nRetain a clear and legible copy of the documentation (front and back if the documentation is two-sided).\n\nIn the event of a Form I-9 audit by a federal government official, make available the clear and legible copies of the identity and employment authorization documentation presented by the employee for document examination in connection with the employment eligibility verification process.\n\nFigure 7: Checkbox in Section 2 to Indicate Remote Documentation Examination\n\nContinue to complete the Form I-9 according to Form I-9 instructions and related guidance on I-9 Central and in the M-274, Handbook for Employers.\n\n5.0 Automatic Extensions of Employment Authorization and/or Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) in Certain Circumstances\n\nSome noncitizens with a pending Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, EAD renewal application filed under certain employment eligibility codes may be eligible to receive an up to 540-day automatic extension of their employment authorization and/or EAD if they meet the requirements stated in Sections 5.1 or 5.3. The increased automatic extension of employment authorization and/or EAD from up to 180 days to up to 540 days is authorized by two DHS temporary final rules published in the Federal Register:\n\nThe first temporary final rule applies to eligible EAD renewal applications that were timely filed between May 4, 2022, and Oct. 26, 2023, and can be found at 87 FR 26614.\n\nThe second temporary final rule applies to eligible EAD renewal applications that were timely filed between Oct. 27, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2025, and can be found at 89 FR 24628.\n\nUnder these temporary final rules, eligible employees with EADs that contain certain category codes are generally eligible for an automatic extension of their employment authorization and/or EADs for up to 540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the face of the EAD. See Figure 8 for an example that shows how to locate the category code and expiration date on an employee’s EAD.\n\nFigure 8: Finding the Category Code and Expiration Date on an EAD (Form I-766)\n\nThe eligibility category appears on the EAD under “Category.” The expiration date appears to the right of “Card Expires,” see Figure 8 below:\n\n5.1 Automatic Extensions Based on a Timely Filed Application to Renew Employment Authorization and/or Employment Authorization Document\n\nSome noncitizens in certain employment eligibility categories who timely file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, to renew their employment authorization and/or EADs may receive automatic extensions of their employment authorization and/or EADs for up to 540 days while their renewal applications remain pending.\n\nThose who timely and properly file(d) their EAD renewal applications between May 4, 2022, and Oct. 26, 2023, or between April 8, 2024, and Sept. 30, 2025, may be eligible to receive an extension of up to 540 days as provided by temporary final rules 87 FR 26614 and 89 FR 24628. Employees who timely filed their EAD renewal applications on or after Oct. 27, 2023, but before April 8, 2024, and whose applications remain pending on or after April 8, 2024, are also eligible to receive an extension of up to 540 days as provided by 89 FR 24628. The extension begins on the “Card Expires” date on face of their EAD and generally continues for up to 540 days as applicable, or until USCIS denies the renewal application, whichever comes earliest. An automatic extension of employment authorization and/or EAD validity depends on these eligibility requirements:\n\nEmployees must have timely and properly filed an application to renew their employment authorization and/or EAD on Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, before the EAD expires, and the Form I-765 EAD renewal application remains pending. Exception: Employees with EADs based on Temporary Protected Status (TPS) (A12 and C19), whose EAD renewal applications were filed during the re-registration period described in the Federal Register notice applicable to their country’s TPS designation, may receive the automatic extension, even if their renewal application was filed after the expiration date on the EAD.\n\nThe eligibility category on the front of the employee’s EAD must have the same eligibility category as the employee’s Form I-797C, Notice of Action, issued for the corresponding EAD renewal application. Exceptions:\n\nIn the case of an EAD and I-797C, Notice of Action, where each contains either an A12 or C19 TPS category code, the category codes do not have to match.\n\nFor H-4 (C26), E (A17) and L-2 (A18) dependent spouses, an unexpired Form I-94 indicating H-4, E, or L-2 nonimmigrant status, including E-1S, E-2S, E-3S and L-2S class of admission codes, must accompany Form I-797C.\n\nEmployees must have one of these qualifying eligibility categories to receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization and/or EAD validity: A03, A05, A07, A08, A10, A17*, A18*, C08, C09, C10, C16, C20, C22, C24, C26*, C31, and A12 or C19. The eligibility categories are published on the USCIS Automatic EAD Extension page. Some category codes on the EAD may include the letter ‘P’ such as C09P. Employers should disregard the letter ‘P’ when comparing the category code on the EAD with the category code on the Form I-797C, Notice of Action. *There are limitations on employees who file a Form I-765 renewal application within categories A17, A18, and C26 for an automatic extension. See A17, A18, and C26 guidance below.\n\nIf an employee is eligible for the automatic extension, acceptable proof of employment authorization and/or EAD validity during the automatic extension period includes: an EAD that appears expired on the face of the card presented with a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, that shows a timely filed EAD renewal application in the same employment eligibility category as the EAD (except TPS-based EADs and notices, which could have A12 or C19 category codes). See Automatic EAD Extensions for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) Beneficiaries in Section 5.3 for information on TPS-based EAD automatic extensions that may not require a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, and Guidance for Employees under Category Codes A17, A18, and C26 for information about the additional unexpired Form I-94 documentation that H-4, E, and L-2 dependent spouses need to present with a Form I-797C, Notice of Action.\n\nFinding Information on Form I-797C: Sample A\n\nI-797 RECEIPT NOTICE EXEMPLAR\n\nThe receipt number appears on Form I-797C, Notice of Action, in the Receipt Number field, as noted in number 1.\n\nThe filing date (the date USCIS received the application) appears in the Received Date field, as noted in number 2. Except as explained below for TPS beneficiaries, this date should be on or before the “Card Expires” date on the EAD. Also, if the “Received Date” is between May 4, 2022, and Sept. 30, 2025, the automatic extension period is up to 540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the face of the EAD. Certain TPS beneficiaries are eligible for this extension if they have timely and properly filed to renew their EAD during the re-registration period as directed in the Federal Register Notice applicable to their country’s TPS designation. Therefore, the filing date on a TPS beneficiary’s Form I-797C might be after the “Card Expires” date on their TPS-based EAD. For more information, go to https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status.\n\nThe category may appear on Form I-797C in the Class Requested field, as noted in number 3. If you do not see this field, see Sample B below.\n\nFinding Information on Form I-797C: Sample B\n\nI-797 RECEIPT NOTICE EXEMPLAR\n\nThe receipt number appears on Form I-797C in the Receipt Number field, as noted in number 1.\n\nThe filing date (the date USCIS received the application) appears in the Received Date field, as noted in number 2. This date should be on or before the “Card Expires” date on the EAD, unless the EAD renewal application and EAD are based on TPS. For TPS-based EADs, the date may be after the “Card Expires” date on the EAD (but must be during the re-registration period stated in the applicable TPS Federal Register Notice). See Section 5.3. The category may appear on Form I-797C in the Eligible Category field, as noted in number 3. The category may appear on Form I-797C in the Eligible Category field, as noted in number 3.\n\nHow to Complete Form I-9 for EADs Automatically Extended Based on a Pending Form I-765 Renewal Application\n\nNew Employees\n\nNew employees presenting an EAD that has been automatically extended must complete Section 1 as follows:\n\nSelect “A noncitizen authorized to work until;” and\n\nEnter the date that is 540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the EAD as the expiration date of employment authorization. Employees whose status does not expire, such as refugees or asylees, should enter “N/A” as the expiration date.\n\nIn Section 2, in the List A column, the employer must:\n\nEnter “EAD” in the Document Title field.\n\nEnter the Card Number from the EAD in the Document Number field.\n\nIn the Expiration Date field, enter the date 540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the EAD if the “Received Date” on Form I-797C is between May 4, 2022, and Sept. 30, 2025.\n\nFor automatic extensions the employer should enter “EAD EXT” in the Additional Information field. Additionally, since your employee’s extension is for up to 540 days, you may keep a copy of the USCIS webpage describing the temporary extension of up to 540 days with the employee’s Form I-9.\n\nYou may use the Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Automatic Extension Calculator to determine extended expiration dates.\n\nRehired Employees\n\nFor employees rehired within three years from the date you completed the employee’s previous Form I-9 and who qualify for this extension, you must complete Form I-9 following the process described above or in Section 6.2. If the employee’s original Form I-9 was completed on a Form I-9 that is no longer valid, you must either complete the latest version of Form I-9 or Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire, and attach it for this employee.\n\nCurrent Employees\n\nFor a current employee whose employment authorization and/or EAD has been automatically extended and who presents a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, you must update Form I-9 enter the appropriate automatic extension expiration date in the Section 2 Additional Information field. Employers should also enter “EAD EXT” in the Additional Information field and may keep a copy of the USCIS webpage describing the temporary extension of up to 540 days with the employee’s Form I-9, if applicable. If the employee’s original Form I-9 was completed on a Form I-9 that is no longer valid, enter EAD EXT and the new expiration date in the Additional Information field in Section 2 of the latest version of Form I-9 and retain it with the employee’s original Form I-9.\n\nGuidance for Employees under Category Codes A17, A18, and C26\n\nEmployees with EADs with category codes A17, A18, and C26 require additional documentation supplementing the Form I-797C, Notice of Action, to show that the EAD has been automatically extended. These employees must present a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure record indicating unexpired nonimmigrant status (E-1, E-1S, E- 2, E-2S, E-3, E-3S, H-4, L-2 or L-2S), along with a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, that shows a timely-filed EAD renewal application stating the “Class requested” as “(A17),” “(A18),” or “(C26),” and the EAD that appears expired on the face of the card as having been issued under the same category (that is, Category A17, A18, or C26).\n\nFor a new employee, in Section 2, in the List A column, the employer must:\n\nEnter “EAD” in the Document Title field.\n\nEnter the Card Number from the EAD in the Document Number field.\n\nIn the Expiration Date field, enter the date that is 540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the EAD if the “Received Date” on Form I-797C is between May 4, 2022, and Sept. 30, 2025, or the end date of the Form I-94, whichever is earlier.\n\nEnter the Form I-94 document information in the second set of List A Document entry fields.\n\nTo calculate the new expiration date:\n\nAdd 540 to the EAD “Card Expires” date.\n\nCompare the 540-day auto-extended date to the Form I-94 end date.\n\nWhichever date is earlier is the new EAD expiration date.\n\nThe employer should enter “EAD EXT” in the Additional Information field in Section 2. If applicable, you may keep a copy of the USCIS webpage describing the temporary EAD extension of up to 540 days with the employee’s Form I-9. Employers must reverify employment authorization at the end of the automatic extension period.\n\nUpdating Form I-9 for an Employee with An Existing 180-Day Automatic Extension\n\nIf your employee’s Form I-797, Notice of Action, for their EAD renewal application has a Received Date of Oct. 27, 2023, through April 7, 2024, and refers to a 180-day extension, and the EAD renewal application is still pending on or after April 8, 2024, the employee is eligible to receive an additional extension of 360 days as provided in the temporary final rule (FR 24628), for a total of 540 days counted from the “Card Expires” date stated on the face of the EAD. Employees whose EAD Category Codes are A17, A18, and C26 may not necessarily receive the full 360-day extension, and this is explained below in the For Category Codes A17, A18, and C26 guidance.\n\nYou must update the Additional Information field in Section 2 of the employee’s Form I-9 to include the new EAD expiration date no later than the date the employee’s 180-day automatic extension will end. Employers are not required to re-examine documents; however, your employee may present a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, EAD and, if applicable, Form I-94 again if you need to re-examine the “Card Expires” date and the category code(s) to determine eligibility and/or accurately calculate the increased automatic extension.\n\nYour employee’s Form I-797C, Notice of Action, that refers to an automatic EAD extension of up to 180 days is acceptable evidence of the extension of up to 540 days, provided the above-described eligibility requirements are satisfied.\n\nYou should update the employee’s original Form I-9 to add 360 days to the employee’s EAD 180-day automatic extension date located in Section 2. You could also determine the automatic extension date by adding 540 days to the “Card Expires” date shown on the EAD. If the employee’s original Form I-9 was completed on a Form I-9 version that is no longer valid, you should enter the new EAD expiration date in the Additional Information field in Section 2 of a new Form I-9 and retain it with the employee’s original Form I-9.\n\nEmployers may keep a copy of the USCIS webpage describing the temporary EAD extension of up to 540 days with the employee’s Form I-9.\n\nFor Category Codes A17, A18, and C26\n\nThis guidance applies to employees who fall within category codes A17, A18, or C26 and therefore are either H-4, E, or L-2 dependent spouses, including E-1S, E-2S, E-3S and L-2S class of admission codes listed on Form I-94. Your employee’s automatic extension period cannot exceed the Form I-94 end date. Under this circumstance, your employee could have an extension that is greater than 180 days but less than the additional 360 days.\n\nYour employee’s Form I-797C, Notice of Action, may refer to an automatic EAD extension of up to 180 days and is acceptable evidence of the 540-day extension, but cannot exceed the Form I-94 end date, provided the above-described eligibility requirements are satisfied.\n\nIn the Additional Information field of Section 2, you should enter either the Form I-94 end date or the EAD “Card Expires” date plus up to 360 days, whichever date is earlier. Note that if the employee’s original Form I-9 was completed on a Form I-9 version that is no longer valid, you should enter the new expiration date in the Additional Information field in Section 2 of a new Form I-9, initial and date the notation, and retain it with the employee’s original Form I-9.\n\nReverification\n\nYou must reverify employees’ employment authorization when the automatic extension of their employment authorization and/or EAD ends (whichever is earlier). You can reverify temporary employment authorization before the automatic extension ends if an employee presents any acceptable, unexpired document that shows employment authorization, such as any acceptable document from List A or C.\n\n5.2 Temporary Increase of Automatic Extension of EADs from 180 Days to 540 Days\n\nYou must reverify employees’ employment authorization when the automatic extension of their employment authorization and/or EAD ends (whichever is earlier). You can reverify temporary employment authorization before the automatic extension ends if an employee presents any acceptable, unexpired document that shows employment authorization, such as any acceptable document from List A or C.\n\nUpdating Form I-9 for an Employee with An Existing 180-Day Automatic Extension\n\nIf your employee’s Form I-9 was completed on or after May 4, 2022, showed an EAD that was automatically extended by 180 days, the employee was eligible to receive an additional extension of 360 days as provided in the temporary final rule (87 FR 26614), for a total of 540 days counted from the “Card Expires” date stated on the face of the EAD. Employees whose EAD Category Codes are A17, A18 and C26 may not necessarily receive the full 360-day extension, and this is explained below in the For Category Codes A17, A18, and C26 guidance.\n\nYou must have updated the Additional Information field in Section 2 of the employee’s Form I-9 to include the new expiration date no later than the date the employee’s 180-day automatic extension ended. Employers were not required to re-examine documents; however, your employee may have presented a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, EAD and, if applicable, Form I-94 again if you needed to re-examine the “Card Expires” date and the category code(s) to determine eligibility and/or accurately calculate the increased automatic extension.\n\nYour employee’s Form I-797C, Notice of Action, may have referred to an automatic EAD extension of up to 180 days and was acceptable evidence of the extension of up to 540 days, provided the above-described eligibility requirements are satisfied.\n\nYou should have updated the employee’s original Form I-9 to add 360 days to the employee’s EAD 180-day automatic extension date located in Section 2. You could have also determined the automatic extension date by adding 540 days to the “Card Expires” date shown on the EAD. Note that if the employee’s original Form I-9 was completed on a Form I-9 version that was no longer valid, you should have entered the new EAD expiration date in the Additional Information field in Section 2 of a new Form I-9 and retained it with the employee’s original Form I-9.\n\nEmployers may keep a copy of the USCIS webpage describing the temporary EAD extension of up to 540 days with the employee’s Form I-9.\n\nFor Category Codes A17, A18, and C26\n\nThis guidance applied to employees who fell within category codes A17, A18, or C26 and therefore were either H-4, E, or L-2 dependent spouses, including E-1S, E-2S, E-3S and L-2S class of admission codes on Form I-94. Your employee’s automatic extension period could not exceed the Form I-94 end date. Under this circumstance, your employee could have had an extension that was greater than 180 days but less than the additional 360 days.\n\nYour employee’s Form I-797C, Notice of Action, may have referred to an automatic EAD extension of up to 180 days but was acceptable evidence of the extension of up to 540 days, but could not exceed the Form I-94 end date, provided the above-described eligibility requirements were satisfied.\n\nIn the Additional Information field of Section 2, you should have entered either the Form I-94 end date or the EAD “Card Expires” date plus up to 360 days, whichever date was earlier. Note that if the employee’s original Form I-9 was completed on a Form I-9 version that is no longer valid, you should have entered the new expiration date in the Additional Information field in Section 2 of a new Form I-9, initialed and dated the notation, and retained it with the employee’s original Form I-9.\n\nEmployment Authorization Resumption for Certain Categories Whose 180-Day Extension Had Expired as of May 4, 2022\n\n(This guidance no longer applies to newly hired employees.) At its inception, the temporary final rule sought to reinstate expired EADs for certain categories who had a 180-day automatic extension that had passed without having received a new EAD. Beginning May 4, 2022, employment eligibility and/or EAD validity resumed for a period not to exceed 540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the EAD for qualifying noncitizens with a pending renewal Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, who experienced a gap in employment authorization and/or the validity of their EAD because their 180-day automatic extension ended prior to May 4, 2022.\n\nThe rule did not cure any unauthorized employment that may have accrued prior to issuance of the rule. To calculate whether there was any automatic extension time remaining, employers counted 540 days from the expiration date stated on the front of the EAD. If an employee fell within category codes A17, A18, or C26 and therefore were either H-4, E, or L-2 dependent spouses, including E-1S, E-2S, E-3S and L-2S class of admission codes on Form I-94, employers counted up to either 540 days or the expiration date on Form I-94, whichever was earlier. The last possible automatic extension based on this resumption of employment authorization was valid through April 28, 2023.\n\nYour employee’s Form I-797C, Notice of Action, may have referred to an automatic EAD extension of up to 180 days and when combined with their EAD, was acceptable evidence of the extension of up to 540 days, provided that the above-described eligibility requirements were satisfied.\n\nReverification\n\nYou should have reverified employees’ employment authorization when their automatic extension ended, and no later than the date their employment authorization expired.\n\n5.3 Automatic EAD Extensions for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) Beneficiaries\n\nDHS may extend the expiration date of a TPS beneficiary’s EAD either by Federal Register notice or an individual notice mailed to the beneficiary. Based on the temporary final rule (89 FR 24628), certain TPS beneficiaries are eligible for an EAD extension based on the timely and proper filing to renew their EAD. For TPS-based EADs, timely filing under the temporary final rule means the EAD renewal application is filed during the TPS re-registration period indicated in the Federal Register notice for their country’s designation (for more information, see Section 5.1 Automatic Extensions Based on a Timely Filed Application to Renew Employment Authorization and/or Employment Authorization Document). You may not ask employees to prove they are nationals of a country that DHS has designated for TPS.\n\nAutomatic Extensions by Federal Register Notice (FRN)\n\nFRNs announcing TPS actions generally include an automatic extension of the expiration date of all associated TPS EADs that contain a specific “Card Expires” date and a category code of A12 or C19. The FRNs provide detailed instructions for completing or updating Form I-9. For TPS EAD automatic extension information, check the USCIS TPS webpage.\n\nHow to Complete Form I-9 for EADs Extended by FRN\n\nIn Section 1, new employees presenting an EAD automatically extended by FRN must:\n\nSelect “A noncitizen authorized to work;” and\n\nEnter the EAD automatic extension date provided in the appropriate FRN as the expiration date. Employees can find a link to their TPS country’s FRN on the USCIS TPS webpage.\n\nIn Section 2, in the List A column, the employer must:\n\nEnter “EAD” in the Document Title field.\n\nEnter the document number from the EAD with Category A12 or C19, as applicable.\n\nEnter the automatic extension date provided in the FRN as the document expiration date.\n\nFor a current employee whose EAD has been automatically extended by FRN, employers must provide updated information on Form I-9. They should enter “EAD EXT” and the EAD automatic extension date from the FRN in the Additional Information field in Section 2. For example, EAD EXT mm/dd/yyyy. If the employee’s original Form I-9 was completed on a Form I-9 version that is no longer valid, complete the latest version of Form I-9 as described above and retain it with the employee’s original Form I-9.\n\nAutomatic Extensions by Individual Notice\n\nDHS may extend the EAD expiration date for some or all TPS beneficiaries of a certain country by issuing an individual notice that contains the new EAD expiration date. Check the USCIS TPS webpage for the latest information on TPS countries whose beneficiaries may have been issued individual notices.\n\nNew employees who are TPS beneficiaries may present the individual notice, along with their EAD with a Category Code of A12 or C19, to complete Form I-9. Employers should ensure the employee’s name and A-Number or USCIS Number on the EAD matches the name and A-Number or USCIS Number, provided in the individual notice.\n\nHow to Complete Form I-9 for EADs Extended by Individual Notices\n\nIn Section 1, new employees presenting an EAD automatically extended by an individual notice must:\n\nSelect “A noncitizen authorized to work until;” and\n\nEnter the EAD automatic extension date provided in the individual notice as the expiration date.\n\nIn Section 2, in the List A column, the employer must:\n\nEnter EAD in the Document Title field.\n\nEnter the document number from the EAD with Category A12 or C19, as applicable.\n\nEnter the automatic extension date provided in the individual notice as the document expiration date.\n\nFor a current employee whose EAD has been automatically extended by individual notice, you must provide updated information on Form I-9. You should enter “EAD EXT” and the EAD automatic extension date from the individual notice in the Additional Information field in Section 2. For example, EAD EXT mm/dd/yyyy. Note that if the employee’s original Form I-9 was completed on a Form I-9 version that is no longer valid, enter “EAD EXT” and the new expiration date in the Additional Information field in Section 2 of the latest version of Form I-9 and retain it with the employee’s original Form I-9.\n\nReverification\n\nYou must reverify employees’ employment authorization when their automatic extension ends, and no later than the date their employment authorization expires. You can reverify temporary employment authorization before the automatic extension ends if an employee presents any unexpired document that shows employment authorization, such as any acceptable document from List A or C.\n\n6.0 Completing Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire of Form I-9\n\nReverification is never required for U.S. citizens or noncitizen nationals. Reverification is also never required when the following documents expire: U.S. passports, U.S. passport cards, Permanent Resident Cards (also known as Green Cards), and List B documents. Other noncitizens may require reverification\n\n6.1 Reverifying Employment Authorization for Current Employees\n\nYou must reverify an employee’s employment authorization no later than the date employment authorization expires. The employee must present a document that shows current employment authorization, such as any documentation from List A or C, including an unrestricted Social Security card. You must reject a restricted Social Security card and ask the employee to provide a diﬀerent document from List A or C. You can also accept certain receipts for reverification; see the Acceptable Receipts table in Section 4.4, Acceptable Receipts, for more information. You cannot continue employing a person who does not provide proof of current employment authorization.\n\nWhen you must reverify an employee, you will complete one block of Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire (formerly Section 3) and attach it to the employee’s original Form I-9. You may use additional blocks on this supplement for subsequent reverifications or updates, attaching additional supplement sheets as needed. If the employee’s previous update or reverification was completed on a Form I-9 version that is no longer valid, you must also complete Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire and attach it to the employee’s original Form I-9. Please check uscis.gov/i-9 for the current Form I-9.\n\nTo reverify your employee using Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire:\n\nEnter the employee’s full name from the original Form I-9 at the top of the supplement.\n\nIf the employee’s name has changed, enter the new name in the appropriate New Name fields in one block of the supplement. Enter only the part of the name that has changed. For example, for employees who changed only their last name, enter the last name in the Last Name field and leave the First Name and Middle initial fields blank.\n\nEnter the document title, number and expiration date in that block of the supplement.\n\nYou must sign, date and enter your name in the appropriate fields in that block. Keep this supplement page with the original Form I-9.\n\nSome employees may have entered N/A in the expiration date field in Section 1 if they are noncitizens whose employment authorization does not expire, such as asylees, refugees, or certain citizens of the Federated State of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or Palau. Reverification does not apply for such individuals unless they choose to present evidence of employment authorization in Section 2 that contains an expiration date and requires reverification, such as Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document. Employees with expiring immigration status, employment authorization, or employment authorization documents should have the necessary application or petition filed well in advance to ensure they maintain continuous employment authorization and/or valid documents. USCIS provides employment authorization extensions under certain conditions. See Section 7.0, Evidence of Employment Authorization for Certain Categories, for more information.\n\n6.2 Reverifying or Updating Employment Authorization for Rehired Employees\n\nIf you rehire employees within three years from the date you completed their previous Form I-9, you may complete a block on Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire, or you instead complete a new Form I-9.\n\nFigure 9: Completing Supplement B, Reverification and Rehires\n\nIf completing a Supplement B block for a rehired employee, follow these guidelines:\n\nIf they are still authorized to work, they do not need to provide any additional documents. This includes U.S. citizens, noncitizen nationals, and lawful permanent residents who presented a Form I-551. For these employees, you must:\n\nEnter the employee’s full name from the original Form I-9 at the top of the supplement. Enter any name change in the New Name fields. Enter only the part of the name that has changed. For example, for employees who changed only their last name, enter the last name in the Last Name field and leave the First Name and Middle Initial fields blank.\n\nEnter their rehire date in the Date of Rehire field.\n\nEnter your name and sign and date the supplement block.\n\nIf their employment authorization has expired, you must:\n\nEnter the employee’s full name from the original Form I-9 at the top of the supplement.\n\nEnter any name change in the New Name fields.\n\nEnter the rehire date in the Date of Rehire field.\n\nReverify their employment authorization in the Expiration Date fields.\n\nEnter your name and sign and date the supplement block.\n\nIf the previous Form I-9 is an old version of the form, you must complete a new block in Supplement B on the current version of the form. Please check uscis.gov/i-9 for the current Form I-9.\n\nIf you already used a block in Supplement B of the employee’s previous Form I-9, but are rehiring them within three years of the date the original Form I-9 was completed, complete a subsequent block on the supplement. Employees rehired three years after you originally completed their Form I-9 must complete a new Form I-9.\n\nEnter the employee’s new name, if applicable.\n\nEnter the employee’s date of rehire, if applicable\n\nEnter the List A or C document title, number, and expiration date (if any)\n\nSign and date the block of the supplement you completed.\n\nNote: If you need to reverify the employment authorization of an existing employee who completed an earlier version of Form I-9, the employee may choose any List A or C document(s) from the Lists of Acceptable Documents for the most current version of Form I-9. Enter the information from the new document(s) in Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire of the current version of Form I-9 and keep it with the previously completed Form I-9. Visit uscis.gov/i-9 for the most current version of Form I-9.\n\n6.3 Recording Changes of Name and Other Identity Information for Current Employees\n\nDuring reverification or rehire, if an employee has had a legal name change (such as by getting married), you must enter their new legal name in the New Name fields of a block of Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire, as described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. If they legally changed their name at any other time, we recommend you update the New Name fields in a subsequent block on the original supplement page or a new supplement page as needed, as soon as you learn of the change, so that you maintain correct information on the form.\n\nTo enter a legal name change in Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire without reverification or rehire:\n\nEnter the employee’s new name in the New Name fields.\n\nEnter your name and sign and date the block you completed on Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire.\n\nIn either situation, you should take steps to ensure the employee’s name change is accurate. This may include asking them to provide legal documentation showing the name change, such as a marriage certificate. Make a copy of that document to keep with Form I-9 in the event of an inspection.\n\nYou may encounter situations other than a legal name change where an employee informs you (or you have reason to believe) that their identity is diﬀerent from what they used to complete their Form I-9. For example, an employee may have been working under a false identity, has subsequently obtained work authorization in their true identity, and wishes to regularize their employment records. In that case, you should complete a new Form I-9. Write the original hire date in Section 2 and attach the new Form I-9 to the previously completed Form I-9 and include a written explanation.\n\nIn cases where an employee has worked for you using a false identity but demonstrates current authorization to work in the United States, Form I-9 rules do not require termination of employment.\n\nIn addition, there may be other laws, contractual obligations, or company policies that you should consider before taking action. For example, the INA prohibits discrimination based on citizenship, immigration status, and national origin. See Section 11.0, Unlawful Discrimination and Penalties for Prohibited Practices, for more information.\n\nFor E-Verify employers:\n\nYour employees should record their legal name change with the SSA to avoid mismatches in E- Verify. For more information, visit www.e-verify.gov.\n\nIf you complete a new Form I-9 based on a non-legal name change, you should confirm the new Form I-9 information through E-Verify. If you do not complete a new Form I-9, you should not create a new E-Verify case.\n\nFederal contractors who are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) E-Verify clause and who choose to verify existing employees by updating an already-completed Form I-9 are subject to special rules regarding when they must complete a new Form I-9. If you choose to update Form I-9 for existing employees, you must complete a new Form I-9 when an employee changes their name. For more information, see the E-Verify Supplemental Guide for Federal Contractors, at e-verify.gov.\n\n7.0 Evidence of Employment Authorization for Certain Categories\n\nThis section includes multiple subsections that provide guidance on the evidence of employment authorization that certain categories of immigrants and non-immigrants can present when completing Form I-9, including lawful permanent residents, Native Americans, refugees and asylees, exchange visitors and students, H-1B and H-2A workers, extensions of stay for other nonimmigrant categories, T and U nonimmigrants, and other temporary workers.\n\n7.1 Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR)\n\nYou must allow employees to choose which document(s) they will present from the Lists of Acceptable Documents. In Section 2, an LPR may choose to present a List A document (such as Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card, commonly referred to as a Green Card) or a List B and C document combination (such as a state-issued driver’s license and unrestricted Social Security card). You are not required to reverify the employment eligibility of a lawful permanent resident who presented these documents and you should not reverify their employment authorization.\n\nForms I-551 may have:\n\nNo expiration date. We issued these cards from January 1977 to August 1989.\n\nA 10-year expiration date.\n\nA two-year expiration date.\n\nLPRs may also present an expired or expiring PRC in combination with either of these receipt notices as a List A document:\n\nForm I-797, Notice of Action, receipt notice for Form I-90, Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card.\n\nForm I-797C, Notice of Action, receipt notice for Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, that contains an automatic extension of the Permanent Resident Card.\n\nThe receipt notice extends the Permanent Resident Card’s validity beyond the date on the front of the card. The receipt notice will specify the length of the automatic extension.\n\nReverification is never required when any of the documents listed above in this section expire.\n\nTemporary Form I-551 Requires Reverification\n\nIf an LPR or conditional resident presents one of the temporary Forms I-551 listed below, you must reverify their employment authorization using Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire:\n\nList A receipt: The arrival portion of Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, containing an unexpired temporary I-551 (ADIT) stamp and a photograph of the employee. The employee must present their Form I-551 to you no later than when the stamp expires, or one year after U.S. Customs and Border Protection issues the Form I-94 if the stamp does not contain an expiration date.\n\nList A document: A foreign passport with either a temporary I-551 (ADIT) stamp or I-551 printed notation on a machine-readable immigrant visa (MRIV). The employee must present a List A or List C document to you when the stamp expires, or one year after the admission date if the stamp does not contain an expiration date.\n\nMost MRIVs contain the following language on the visa: “UPON ENDORSEMENT SERVES AS TEMPORARY I-551 EVIDENCING PERMANENT RESIDENCE FOR 1 YEAR.” The one-year time period begins on the date of admission. If the employee receives an MRIV without the statement “FOR 1 YEAR,” you should treat the MRIV as evidence of permanent residence status for one year from the date of admission.\n\nIf the stamp in the passport is endorsed “CR-1” and is near but not on the MRIV, it is still a valid endorsement.\n\nEnter the number in red font under the MRIV “Expires On” date as the document number.\n\nList C document: An expired PRC with a Form I-797, Notice of Action, receipt notice for either a Form I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions or a Form I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status, that indicates USCIS has extended the card’s validity. You must reverify the employee’s employment authorization before their extension ends.\n\n7.2 Native Americans\n\nNative Americans may present a List A document or List B and C document for Form I-9.\n\nA Native American tribal document is an oﬀicial tribal or community membership document issued by a Native American Indian tribe, or an Alaska Eskimo or Aleut community, that is recognized by the U.S. federal government. A tribal or community membership document that is issued by a tribe or community that is not recognized by the U.S. federal government is not an acceptable Native American tribal document for Form I-9 purposes. Because federal recognition of tribes and communities can change over time, you should check the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Indian Aﬀairs website to determine if the tribe or community that issued the tribal or community membership document is federally recognized. Use the following guidance to determine if the document is acceptable as evidence of both identity and employment authorization, or only for identity purposes.\n\nTable 3 Native American Tribal Documents\n\nIf your employee presents a Native American tribal document and in Section 1 selects: The document is acceptable as:\n\nCitizen of the United States\n\nList B and List C\n\nLawful permanent resident\n\nList B and List C\n\nNoncitizen authorized to work\n\nList B only\n\nThe following documents are not considered Native American tribal documents for Form I-9 purposes and are not acceptable as a List A, List B or List C document:\n\nA tribal membership document issued by a Canadian First Nation; and\n\nA Certificate of Indian Status (commonly referred to as an \"INAC card\") issued by Indigenous and Northern Aﬀairs Canada.\n\nWhile individuals who have these documents might qualify for employment authorization under INA section 289 (and, if applicable, 8 CFR 289.2), a tribal membership card issued by a Canadian First Nation, or INAC card issued by the Government of Canada cannot, by itself, establish employment authorization.\n\nIf you participate in E-Verify, all List B documents presented by employees, including Native American tribal documents, must contain a photograph. This includes Native American tribal documents presented as a List B document. If the employee's Native American tribal document does not contain a photograph, you should request the employee provide a different List B document with a photograph.

Your employee may also choose to provide a List A document instead of a List B and List C document.\n\n7.3 Refugees and Asylees\n\nRefugees and asylees are employment eligible incident to their status and are authorized to work indefinitely because their immigration status does not expire. They may present any List A document or a combination of List B and List C documents from the Form I-9 Lists of Acceptable Documents to demonstrate identity and employment authorization. Employees may also present an acceptable receipt instead of the List A, B or C document. For more information about receipts, including the receipts refugees and asylees may present, see the information below in this section or Section 4.4, Acceptable Receipts.\n\nRefugees\n\nUpon admission to the United States, DHS provides refugees with a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, which does not expire.\n\nWhen completing Form I-9, refugees should check “A noncitizen authorized to work” and enter “N/A” on the Expiration Date field in Section 1, even if they have an EAD with an expiration date.\n\nThe departure portion that contains an unexpired refugee admission stamp or an electronic Form I-94 with an admission class of “RE” is an acceptable receipt establishing both employment authorization and identity for 90 days. If the refugee presents this receipt, at the end of the 90-day receipt period, the refugee must present either an EAD or a document from List B, such as a state-issued driver’s license, with a document from List C, such as an unrestricted Social Security card.\n\nRefugees may also present an expired EAD with a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, if the notice lists the same employment authorization category as the expired EAD. This combination is considered an unexpired List A document and is valid for up to 540 days after the “Card Expires” date on the EAD.­ For more information, see Section 5.0, Automatic Extensions of Employment Authorization and/or Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) in Certain Circumstances.\n\nTable 4: Documentation Refugees May Present\n\nThis table provides examples of documentation refugees may present to complete Form I-9 and whether the reverification of employment authorization is required.\n\nDocument Additional Guidance Is Reverification Required?

The asylee does not need to present a foreign passport with this Form I-94. An asylee can also present an electronic Form I-94 with an admission class of “AY.” Form I-94 is an acceptable List C document and does not expire or require reverification. Asylees who choose to present this document must also present a List B identity document, such as a state-issued driver’s license or identification card.\n\nWhen completing Form I-9, asylees should indicate “a noncitizen authorized to work” and enter “N/A” on the expiration date line in Section 1, even if they have an EAD with an expiration date.\n\nUSCIS issues EADs to asylees.

Employers may not employ a J-1 participant knowing that the exchange visitor is performing work outside of their approved program.\n\nThe Department of State (DOS) administers exchange visitor programs and designates the sponsors. Program sponsors issue Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status to participants. Exchange visitors come to the United States for a specific period of time to participate in a particular program or activity, as described on their Form DS-2019. Only J-1 exchange visitors with employment authorized under the terms of their program may use Form DS-2019 as documentation when completing Form I-9.\n\nCurrently, DOS designates public and private entities to act as exchange sponsors for the following programs.\n\nExchange Visitor Programs\n\nProfessors and research scholar\n\nShort-term scholars\n\nTrainees and interns\n\nCollege and university students\n\nTeachers\n\nSecondary school students\n\nSpecialists\n\nPhysicians\n\nInternational visitors\n\nGovernment visitors\n\nCamp counselors\n\nAu pairs\n\nSummer work travel\n\nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) Programs\n\nSummer work/travel: Australia and New Zealand\n\nWEST (Work/English Study/Travel): South Korea\n\nIntern work/travel: Republic of Ireland\n\nIntern/trainee (Innovative Programs): Portugal\n\nIntern program (Sciences, engineering, architecture, mathematics, and industrial occupations) Mexico\n\nHigh school or secondary school students and international visitors are not authorized to work.\n\nResponsible oﬀicers may authorize other J-1 students for part-time on-campus employment according to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, assistantship, or oﬀ- campus employment based on serious, urgent, or unforeseen economic circumstances. Responsible oﬀicers may also authorize J-1 students for a maximum of 18 months (or, for Ph.D. students, a maximum of 36 months) of practical training during or immediately after their studies. J-1 practical training includes paid oﬀ- campus employment and/or unpaid internships that are part of the student’s program of study. Their responsible oﬀicer must authorize employment in writing for practical training. Special rules apply to student interns.\n\nEmployment for other J-1 exchange visitors is sometimes job- and site-specific or limited to a few months.\n\nFor more information about these categories and their employment authorization, contact the responsible oﬀicer whose name and telephone number are on the employee’s Form DS-2019 or go to the DOS website at j1visa.state.gov.\n\nDHS issues exchange visitors Forms I-94 indicating J-1 nonimmigrant status. DOS-designated program sponsors issue Form DS-2019 endorsed by a responsible officer, which indicates the type of work an exchange visitor is authorized to perform. For J-1 students, the responsible officer prepares additional informal documentation (a letter) that verifies employment authorization.\n\nThe J-1 exchange visitor must enter the DS-2019 Program End Date in Section 1 as the date employment authorization expires. A J-1 student must enter in Section 1 the end date from their responsible officer letter authorizing employment or the program end date on the DS-2019 if issued for academic training.\n\nIn Section 2, you may enter:\n\nA List A document, including the combination of: A foreign passport;\n\nForm I-94 indicating J-1 nonimmigrant status; and\n\nForm DS-2019 with the responsible oﬀicer’s endorsement.\n\nEnter the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) number as the document number and the program end date as the document expiration date.\n\nA J-1 student must also provide a letter from the responsible officer. Enter the document information in the Additional Information field.\n\nor\n\nList B and C documents:\n\nFor example, a state driver’s license (List B) and a Form I-94 indicating J-1 nonimmigrant status with a properly endorsed Form DS-2019 (List C #7).\n\nEnter the SEVIS number as the document number and the program end date as the expiration date.\n\nA J-1 student must also provide a letter from the responsible officer. Enter the information in the Additional Information field.\n\nIf the J-1 exchange visitor transfers to a diﬀerent program or changes their sponsor, their Form DS-2019 must indicate the new program or sponsor.\n\nSome exchange visitors may extend their status. If you have questions about any exchange visitor’s continued employment authorization, contact the responsible oﬀicer whose name and telephone number are listed on the employee’s Form DS-2019.\n\nDependents of a J-1 exchange visitor are classified as J-2 nonimmigrants and are only authorized to work if USCIS issued an EAD to them. A J-2 nonimmigrant’s foreign passport and Form I-94 are not evidence of identity and employment authorization for Form I-9 purposes.\n\n7.4.2 F-1 and M-1 Nonimmigrant Students\n\nForeign students pursuing academic studies and/or language training programs are classified as F-1 nonimmigrants, while foreign students pursuing nonacademic or vocational studies are classified as M-1 nonimmigrants. Designated school oﬀicials (DSO) at certified schools issue Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1)/(M-1) Students. Foreign academic or vocational students may work in the United States under certain circumstances. DHS issues documents showing employment authorization based on the type of student they are and the type of employment they have.\n\nAcademic Students in F-1 Nonimmigrant Status\n\nF-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may seek off-campus employment "
