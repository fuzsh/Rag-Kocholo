        "text": "Requesting Information and Application for Admission\n\nBefore you decide to apply for admission to California State University, Chico, we invite you to visit our university. The Office of Admissions staff is ready to make your visit informative and provide pre-admission advising, help with application procedures and other specialized services.\n\nThe Office of Admissions provides information about higher education to prospective students, parents, guidance counselors and others. The staff assists students in the admission process and informs other educational institutions and agencies about the CSU and Chico State programs, policies and procedures. Other services include coordination of visits by the Admissions staff to high schools, community colleges, community agencies and responding to inquiries on University enrollment.\n\nYou may access additional information regarding the University on the Chico State website or by calling 530-898-4428.\n\nAdmission Procedures and Policies\n\nRequirements for admission to Chico State are in accordance with Title 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 3, of the California Code of Regulations. Complete information is available on the California State University (CSU) website.\n\nAll CSU applications must be submitted online on the Cal State Apply website. An acknowledgment will be sent to the applicant when the online application has been submitted.\n\nImportance of Filing Complete, Accurate, and Authentic Application Documents\n\nChico State advises prospective students that they must supply complete and accurate information on the application for admission, residency questionnaire, and financial aid forms. Further, applicants must, when requested, submit authentic and official transcripts of all previous academic work attempted. Failure to file complete, accurate, and authentic application documents may result in denial of admission, cancellation of registration or academic credit, suspension, or expulsion (Section 41301, Article 1.1, Title 5, California Code of Regulations).\n\nUndergraduate Application Procedures\n\nProspective students applying for part-time or full-time undergraduate programs of study must submit a completed undergraduate application. The $70 nonrefundable application fee should be paid online at the time of application via credit card or PayPal and may not be transferred or used to apply to another term. An alternate major may be requested on the application if desired from the university. The applications of persons denied admission to an impacted university may be redirected to another CSU at no cost, but only if the applicant is CSU eligible.\n\nImpacted Programs\n\nThe CSU designates programs as impacted when more applications from regularly eligible applicants are received in the initial filing period (October and November for fall terms, June for winter terms, August for spring terms, February for summer terms) than can be accommodated. Some programs are impacted at every university that they are offered; others are impacted only at a few universities. Candidates for admission must meet all of the university’s specified supplementary admission criteria if applying to an impacted program or university.\n\nThe CSU will announce during the fall filing period those universities or programs that are impacted. Detailed information on university and program impaction is available on the Access & Impaction website.\n\nEach university will communicate supplementary admission criteria for all impacted programs to high schools and community colleges in their application service area and will disseminate this information to the public through appropriate media. This information will also be published on the Chico State Office of Admissions website.\n\nApplicants must file applications for admission to an impacted program during the initial filing period. Applicants who wish to be considered for impacted programs at more than one CSU should file an application at each university for which they seek admission consideration.\n\nSupplementary Admission Criteria\n\nEach CSU with impacted programs or class-level admission categories uses supplementary admission criteria in screening applicants. Supplementary criteria may include rank-ordering of freshman applicants based on GPA or rank-ordering of transfer applicants based on verification of Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) or Associate in Science Transfer (AS-T) degrees, the overall transfer grade point average (GPA), completion of specified prerequisite courses, and a combination of university-developed criteria. Applicants for freshman admission to impacted universities or programs may need to have a higher \"a-g\" GPA. In no case will standardized test scores be utilized in making freshman admission decisions.\n\nThe supplementary admission criteria used by individual CSUs to screen applicants are made available by the universities to all applicants seeking admission to an impacted program.\n\nNursing and Recording Arts at Chico State are designated as impacted majors. Visit the Office of Admissions online or call 530-898-4428 for an updated list of impacted majors. Upper-division transfer students from outside of our local admission area may be held to a higher GPA requirement. This GPA will be decided based on the characteristics of the applicant pool.\n\nResidency Determination\n\nWhether you are a resident of California or a non-resident determines the fees you pay and the admission requirements that apply to you. Residence classifications are determined through a review of the information you provide in the residence portion of your admission application. For a summary statement of the principal rules and exceptions regarding the residence determination, see \"Determination of Residency for Tuition Purposes\" in the CSU System Policies and Regulations section.\n\nAB540 Eligibility Requirements\n\nUnder the provision of the California state Assembly Bill 540 some California non-residents may pay in-state fees.\n\nCalifornia Dream Act of 2011\n\nThe California Dream Act of 2011 is the result of two bills, Assembly Bill 130 and Assembly Bill 131. Together, these bills allow undocumented and documented students who meet certain provisions of the AB 540 law to apply for and receive private scholarships funneled through public universities (AB 130). Effective January 2013, students may be eligible for state-administered financial aid, university grants, and community college fee waivers (AB 131).\n\nUndergraduate Admission Requirements\n\nFreshman Requirements\n\nGenerally, applicants will qualify for consideration for first-time freshman admission if they meet the following requirements:\n\n1. Have graduated from high school, have earned a Certificate of General Education Development (GED) or have passed the California High School Proficiency Examination (CHSPE);\n\n2. Complete the 15-unit comprehensive \"a-g\" pattern of college preparatory courses;\n\n3. Have completed, with grades of C- or better, each of the courses in the comprehensive pattern of college preparatory subject requirements also known as the \"a-g\" pattern (see \"Subject Requirements\"); and\n\nThe CSU will accept \"Credit\" or \"Pass\" grades to satisfy \"a-g\" requirements completed during Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall 2020 terms and during Winter, Spring or Summer 2021 terms. The CSU expects and assumes that high school Pass (Credit) grades will represent work completed at the C- or higher level. As of Fall 2021 and forward, grades are expected for courses.\n\n4. Earn a qualifying \"a-g\" grade point average (GPA) as described below.\n\nCalifornia residents and graduates of California high schools will be eligible for admission by earning a 2.50 or greater \"a-g\" GPA.\n\nAny California high school graduate or resident of California earning a GPA between 2.00 and 2.49 may be evaluated for admission based upon supplemental factors such as number of courses exceeding minimum \"a-g\" requirements, household income, extracurricular involvement, and other available information that would inform the university admission decision.\n\nNon-California residents may be eligible for admission to the CSU by earning a 3.00 or greater \"a-g\" GPA along with other supplemental factors utilized by the individual university, including those outlined by impacted universities and programs.\n\nAny Non-California resident earning a GPA between 2.47 and 2.99 may be evaluated for admission based upon supplemental factors such as number of courses exceeding minimum \"a-g\" requirements, household income, extracurricular involvement, and other available information that would inform the university admission decision.\n\n5. Each CSU will determine the supplemental factors used with GPA to determine eligibility in these cases and communicate these criteria publicly for prospective students.\n\nThe California State University (CSU) permanently discontinued the use of ACT/SAT examination in determining admission eligibility. Submitted test scores by admitted students would be considered only for purposes of student placement in Math or English courses.\n\nStudents may contact:\n\nThe College Board (SAT)\n\nRegistration Unit, Box 6200\n\nPrinceton, New Jersey 08541-6200\n\n(609) 771-7588\n\nwww.collegeboard.org\n\nACT Registration Unit\n\nP.O. Box 414\n\nIowa City, Iowa 52240\n\n(319) 337-1270\n\nwww.act.org\n\nProvisional Admission\n\nChico State may provisionally admit first-time freshman applicants based on their academic preparation through the junior year of high school and planned coursework for the senior year. The university will monitor the final terms of study to ensure that admitted students complete their secondary school studies satisfactorily, including the required college preparatory subjects, and graduate from high school. Students are required to submit an official transcript after graduation to certify that all coursework has been satisfactorily completed. Official high school transcripts must be received prior to the deadline set by the university. In no case may documentation of high school graduation be received any later than the census date for a student's first term of CSU enrollment. A CSU may rescind admission decisions, cancel financial aid awards, withdraw housing contracts and cancel any university registration for students who are found to be ineligible after the final transcript has been evaluated.\n\nApplicants will qualify for regular (non-provisional) admission when the university verifies that they have graduated and received a high school diploma, have completed the comprehensive pattern of college preparatory \"a-g\" subjects and, if applying to an impacted program or university, have met all supplementary criteria.\n\nEnglish Language (TOEFL) Requirement\n\nAll undergraduate applicants whose native language is not English and who have not attended schools at the secondary level or above for at least three years full time where English is the principal language of instruction must present a qualifying score on a recognized external English language proficiency exam. Some majors may require a score higher than the Chico State minimum. Approved English language proficiency examinations accepted at Chico State are as follows:\n\nTest of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)\n\nMinimum Score for Undergraduate Applicants\n\nInternet-based test - 61\n\nPaper-based test - 500\n\nEssentials - 7.0\n\nMinimum Score for Graduate Applicants\n\nInternet-based test - 80\n\nPaper-based test – 550\n\nEssentials - 9.0\n\nInternational English Language Testing System (IELTS)\n\nMinimum Score for Undergraduate Applicants – 6\n\nMinimum Score for Graduate Applicants – 6.5\n\nPearson Test of English Academic\n\nMinimum Score for Undergraduates – 47\n\nMinimum Score for Graduate Applicants – 59\n\nSubject Requirements\n\nThe CSU requires that first-time freshman applicants complete, with grades of C- or higher, a comprehensive pattern of college preparatory study totaling 15 units. A “unit” is one year of study in high school. A grade of CR or P will be honored for coursework completed during the winter, spring, summer, or fall 2020 and during winter, spring, or summer 2021 terms.\n\nSocial Science, 2 years\n\n(including one year of U.S. history or U.S. history and government)\n\nEnglish, 4 years\n\nMathematics, 3 years\n\n(algebra, geometry, and intermediate algebra; four years recommended)\n\nLaboratory Science, 2 years\n\n(one biological and one physical science, both with labs)\n\nForeign language, 2 years\n\n(same language, subject to waiver for applicants demonstrating equivalent competence)\n\nVisual or Performing Arts, 1 year\n\n(art, dance, drama/theatre, or music, one single year-long course or two semester-long courses in the same discipline)\n\nElectives, 1 year\n\n(selected from English, advanced mathematics, social science, history, laboratory science, foreign language, visual and performing arts, or other courses approved and included on the UC/CSU \"a-g\" list)\n\nSubject Requirement Substitution for Students with Disabilities\n\nApplicants with disabilities are encouraged to complete college preparatory course requirements. If you are judged unable to fulfill a specific course requirement because of your verified disability, alternate college preparatory courses may possibly be substituted for specific subject requirements. Substitutions may possibly be authorized on an individual basis after review and recommendation by your academic advisor or guidance counselor in consultation with a Chico State Admissions counselor. Although the distribution may be slightly different from the course pattern required of other students, students qualifying for substitutions will still be held for 15 units of college preparatory study. You should be aware that course substitutions may limit your later enrollment in certain majors, particularly those involving mathematics. For more information, please call the Office of Admissions at 530-898-6322. Chico State requires that course substitutions be approved before the substituted course is taken. Subject requirement substitutions are granted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nTransfer Policies of California State University\n\nMost commonly, college-level credits earned from an institution of higher education accredited by a regional/national accrediting agency are accepted for transfer to universities of the CSU; however, authority for decisions regarding the transfer of undergraduate credits is delegated to each university.\n\nCalifornia Community Colleges and other authorized certifying institutions can certify up to 39 semester (58.5 quarter) units of General Education-Breadth (GE-Breadth) or 37 semester (55.5 quarter) units of the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) for transfer students to fulfill lower-division general education requirements for any CSU university prior to transfer.\n\n“Certification” is the official notification from a California Community College or authorized institution that a transfer student has completed courses fulfilling lower-division general education requirements. The CSU GE-Breadth and the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) certification course lists for particular community colleges can be accessed on the official transfer and articulation system for California's public colleges and universities website, assist.org.\n\nCSUs may enter into course-to-course or program-to-program articulation agreements with other CSUs any or all of the California Community Colleges, and other regionally accredited institutions. Established CSU and California Community College articulations may be found on assist.org.\n\nStudents may be permitted to transfer no more than 70 semester (105 quarter) units to a CSU from an institution that does not offer bachelor’s degrees or their equivalents, for example, community colleges. Given the university’s 30-semester (45 quarter) unit residency requirement, no more than a total of 90 semester (135 quarter) units may be transferred into the university from all sources.\n\nTransfer Requirements\n\nApplicants who have completed fewer than 60 transferable semester college units (fewer than 90 quarter units) are considered lower-division transfer students. Applicants who have completed 60 or more transferable semester college units (90 or more quarter units) are considered upper-division transfer students. Applicants who complete college units during high school or through the summer immediately following high school graduation are considered first-time freshmen and must meet the CSU minimum eligibility requirements for first-time freshman admission. Transferable courses are those designated for baccalaureate credit by the college or university offering the courses and accepted as such by the university to which the applicant seeks admission.\n\nLower-Division Transfer Requirements\n\nDue to increased enrollment demands, some CSUs do not admit lower-division transfer applicants. Students are advised to check the respective university they are interested in to see if lower division transfer applications are accepted.\n\nAn applicant who completes fewer than 60 semester (90 quarter) units of college credit is considered a lower-division transfer student. Due to enrollment pressures, some CSUs do not admit lower- division transfers so that more upper-division transfers can be accommodated.\n\nHaving fewer than 60 semester (90 quarter) units at the point of transfer may affect eligibility for registration priority at a CSU and may affect the student’s financial aid status.\n\nCalifornia resident transfer applicants with fewer than 60 semester or 90 quarter units must:\n\nHave a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (C) or better in all transferable units attempted;\n\nHave completed, with a grade of C- or better, a course in written communication and a course in mathematics or quantitative reasoning at a level satisfying CSU General Education Breadth Area A2 and B4 requirement, respectively;\n\nBe in good standing at the last institution attended; and\n\nMeet any one of the following eligibility standards.\n\nTransfer Based on Current Admission Criteria\n\nThe applicant meets the freshman admission requirements in effect for the term for which the application is filed; -OR-\n\nTransfer Based on High School Eligibility\n\nThe applicant was eligible as a freshman at the time of high school graduation and has been in continuous attendance in an accredited college since high school graduation; -OR-\n\nTransfer Based on Making Up Missing Subjects\n\nThe applicant had a qualifying GPA, has made up any missing college preparatory subject requirements with a grade of C- or better, and has been in continuous attendance in an accredited college since high school graduation.\n\nOne baccalaureate-level course of at least 3 semester (4 quarter) units is usually considered equivalent to one year of high school study.\n\nNote: Some CSUs may require lower-division transfer students to complete specific college coursework, for example the four basic skills courses, as part of their admission criteria.\n\nUpper-Division Transfer Requirements\n\nGenerally, applicants will qualify for consideration for upper-division transfer admission if they meet all of the following requirements:\n\nCumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 in all transferable units attempted;\n\nIn good standing at the last college or university attended; and\n\nCompleted at least 60 transferable semester (90 quarter) units of college-level coursework with a grade point average of 2.0 or higher and a grade C- or better in each course used to meet the CSU general education requirements in written communication, oral communication, critical thinking, and quantitative reasoning, e.g. mathematics. A grade of CR or P will be honored for coursework completed during the winter, spring, summer, or fall 2020 and during winter, spring, or summer 2021.\n\nThe 60 units must include at least 30 units of courses that meet CSU general education requirement, including all of the general education requirements in communication in the English language (both oral and written) and critical thinking and the requirement in mathematics/quantitative reasoning (usually 3 semester units) OR the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) requirements in English communication and mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning.\n\nAssociate Degrees for Transfer (AA-T or AS-T)\n\nThe Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and the Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T) degrees offered at the California Community Colleges (CCC) are designed to provide a California community college student the optimum transfer preparation and a clear admission pathway to the CSU degree majors.\n\nCCC students who earn an Associate Degree for Transfer (AA-T or AS-T) are guaranteed admission with junior standing to a CSU and given priority admission consideration over other transfer applicants when applying to a local CSU or non-impacted CSU program. AA-T or AS-T admission applicants are given limited priority consideration based on their eligibility ranking to an impacted university/program or to CSUs/programs that have been deemed similar to the degree completed at the community college. Students who have completed an AA-T/AS-T in a program deemed similar to a CSU major are able to complete remaining requirements for graduation within 60 semester (90 quarter) units. It is the responsibility of the student who has earned an AA-T/AS-T to provide documentation of the degree to the CSU. For the admissions process, students are responsible for working with their community college counselors to complete verification of AA-T or AS-T degree progress through the e-verify process within the established university deadlines.\n\nBecause several CSU universities are receiving more transfer applications from eligible students than can be accommodated, these CSUs have declared impaction resulting in higher admission criteria.\n\nStudents who earn associate degrees for transfer and apply to a CSU university but cannot be admitted due to impaction will be redirected to another CSU university and offered admission for the same term. In order to qualify for the priority admission guarantee, transfer applicants must be conferred an approved Associate Degree for Transfer (AA-T/AS-T) by a California Community College, must apply for admission to the California State University for an open term by the published deadline, submit all requested transcripts and documents, meet CSU admission eligibility requirements for the university and/or program, and must comply with any other prescribed admission requirements. It is the responsibility of these transfer students to provide documentation about the completion of the degree to each CSU university that has received an application for admission.\n\nProvisional Admission\n\nChico State may provisionally or conditionally admit transfer applicants based on their academic preparation and courses planned for completion. The university will monitor the final terms to ensure that those admitted complete all required courses satisfactorily. All accepted applicants are required to submit an official transcript of all college-level work completed. CSUs may rescind admission for any student who is found to be ineligible after the final transcript has been evaluated. In no case may such documents be received and validated by the university any later than a student's registration for their second term of CSU enrollment.\n\nSecond Bachelor's Degree\n\nThe minimum requirements for admission to graduate or postbaccalaureate studies at a CSU are in accordance with university regulations as well as Title 5, chapter 1, sub-chapter 3 of the California Code of Regulations. Specifically, you will qualify for admission if you:\n\nHave completed a four-year college course of study and hold an acceptable baccalaureate;\n\nAre in good academic standing at the last college or university attended;\n\nHave attained a grade point average of at least 2.5 in an acceptable earned baccalaureate degree;\n\nHave attained a grade point average of at least 2.5 (A = 4.0) in the last 60 semester (90 quarter) units attempted.\n\nRecording Arts and Liberal Studies are closed to students seeking second bachelor's degrees.\n\nInternational (Foreign) Student Admission Requirements\n\nThe CSU must assess the academic preparation of international students. For this purpose, “international students” include those who hold U.S. temporary visas as students, exchange visitors, or in other nonimmigrant classifications.\n\nThe CSU uses separate requirements and application filing dates in the admission of international students. Each university sets its own application filing periods for international students. At Chico State, the undergraduate application period for the fall semester is from October 1 to May 1. For the spring semester, the application period is from August 1 to September 30. Verification of English proficiency (see International Admissions website) and academic performance are all important considerations for admission. Academic records from foreign institutions must be official. If transcripts are not in English, they must be accompanied by certified English translations. All supporting documents must be received by May 15 for fall admission and October 15 for spring admission.\n\nAcademic Requirements\n\nGraduates of university-preparatory secondary/high school programs in foreign countries are required to have academic preparation and abilities sufficient to succeed in a demanding bachelor's degree program.\n\nA cumulative grade point average of B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) with a C (2.0 on a 4.0 scale) in all mathematics courses or the equivalent earned in secondary school is required for first-time freshmen applicants.\n\nApplicants with foreign college or university-level coursework are required to have a 2.40 on a 4.0 scale on all postsecondary coursework.\n\nAn international student may transfer to Chico State from a college or university within the U.S. with completion of at least 24 semester units, providing their cumulative grade point average is at least 2.0 and they have completed, with a grade of C or higher, the following General Education requirements: Oral Communication, Written Communication, and Mathematics.\n\nApplicants who have previously completed a U.S. bachelor’s degree or equivalent are required to have a 2.50 on a 4.0 scale on postsecondary coursework for admission to a second bachelor’s program.\n\nIn general, impacted bachelor’s degree programs are closed for admission for international applicants.\n\nComplete details of the admission standards for all undergraduate applicant types are available on the International Admissions website.\n\nConditional Admission\n\nThe university offers conditional admission through partnerships with various intensive English programs for students who meet all requirements for regular admission, with the exception of the English language proficiency requirement. To be considered for conditional admission, students must apply to both programs at least three months prior to the beginning of the English program session they wish to attend.\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency Requirement\n\nSee detailed information on the International Admissions website.\n\nFinancial Support Requirement\n\nEvidence of sufficient financial support to complete the degree program is required for admission. The current required amount can be obtained from International Admissions. These figures are subject to change.\n\nOther Examinations\n\nSAT or ACT is not required for admission. Results may qualify you for exemptions from certain placement tests once you arrive in Chico. See Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning and Writing Requirements.\n\nRequired Health Insurance\n\nAll admitted international students on F-1 and J-1 visas must obtain and maintain health insurance as a condition of registration and continued enrollment in the California State University. Details about minimum coverage requirements are available from International Student and Scholar Services.\n\nThe International Baccalaureate\n\nChico State recognizes the International Baccalaureate as a strong college preparatory program (the International Baccalaureate North America/IBNA is one example of an IB program). Applicants currently enrolled in a full IB diploma program will be considered to have met or have in progress all college preparatory subject requirements for admission. Students completing less than the full IB diploma program must meet subject requirements as described in \"Subject Requirements for First-time Freshman Applicants.\" Additional factors to be considered in reaching our admission decision will be the high school GPA and supplemental factors. Additional honors points will be awarded in GPA calculations for achievement in up to eight IB courses taken in grades 11 and 12 and indicated on the high school transcript.\n\nCSU will award honors points in the GPA calculation for eight semester courses taken in the 11th or 12th grades, including up to two International Baccalaureate (IB) or Advanced Placement (AP) courses with 11th or 12th grade content taken by a student in the 10th grade. Applicants who plan to enroll at Chico State should submit a copy of the official IB transcript and diploma when it is available in July. Up to six semester units of advanced standing credit will be awarded for each Higher Level examination passed with a score of 4, 5, 6, or 7. No credit will be awarded for Subsidiary Level passes.\n\nOther Applicants\n\nHigh School Students\n\nHigh school students may be considered for enrollment in certain special programs if recommended by the principal and the appropriate university department chair and if preparation is equivalent to that required of eligible California high school graduates. Such admission is only for a given specific program and does not constitute a right to continued enrollment. The High School Scholars program is subject to yearly budgetary renewal. Please refer to the High School Scholars page for program status.\n\nThe California Promise\n\nThe California Promise Program enables a specific number of CSUs to establish pledge programs for entering first-time students who are both interested and able to complete baccalaureate degrees in four years. All CSUs have established programs for students with Associate Degrees for Transfer from any California Community College to complete their baccalaureate degrees in two years. The program is limited to students who are residents of California.\n\nStudents who commit to enter either the four-year or two-year pledge will be given a priority registration appointment for each state-supported enrollment period and will be provided with routine and thorough academic advisement. In order to remain in the program, students must meet with their advisors as prescribed, develop an enrollment plan, and complete 30 semester units or the quarter equivalent within each academic year, including summer. Participating CSUs may stipulate other requirements as well. Interested students entering Chico State should visit the California Promise Program website.\n\nEducational Opportunity Program\n\nThe Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) provides assistance for first-generation college students who are historically low-income, academically underprepared, or lacking the subject requirements, grades, or test scores normally required for college attendance, but who have demonstrated the potential for academic success. Students who are academically eligible for regular admission to the University and meet EOP criteria may also apply. To be eligible for EOP admission, you must be an undergraduate and a California resident or qualify for an AB 540 nonresident tuition exemption.\n\nTo apply for admission through EOP, applicants must first submit the CSU application through Cal State Apply. Next, the applicant must submit the separate online EOP application, which includes the EOP applicant information form, and recommendation forms.\n\nFor additional information about the Educational Opportunity Program, please call 530-898-6831 or e-mail eopadm@csuchico.edu.\n\nVeterans\n\nIf you are a veteran of the United States military service and a California resident, you may possibly be granted admission even if you do not meet the University's regular admission requirements. If you wish to request consideration under this provision, follow regular application procedures, and send a letter of appeal to the Office of Admissions. More information for veterans is available through Veteran Education Transition Services.\n\nAdult Students\n\nAs an alternative to regular admission criteria, an applicant who is 25 years of age or older may be considered for admission as an adult student if he or she meets all of the following conditions:\n\nPossesses a high school diploma (or has established equivalence through either the General Educational Development or California High School Proficiency Examinations).\n\nHas not been enrolled in college as a full-time student for more than one term during the past five years.\n\nIf there has been any college attendance in the last five years, has earned a 2.00 GPA or better in all college work attempted.\n\nConsideration will be based upon a judgment as to whether the applicant is as likely to succeed as a regularly admitted freshman or transfer student and will include an assessment of basic skills in the English language and mathematical computation.\n\nApplicants Not Regularly Eligible\n\nApplicants not admissible under the guidelines of one of the above provisions may enroll in extension courses, at a community college, or at another appropriate institution to meet eligibility requirements. Denied applicants may choose to petition for special admission consideration. Only under the most unusual circumstances and only by special action will such applicants be admitted to Chico State.\n\nAuditing Classes\n\nAuditors regularly attend classes. However, they do not actively participate by preparing outside assignments or by taking examinations; nor do they receive academic credit for participation in classes. If you want to audit a class for information only, you must submit the regular admission application but without payment of the application fee.\n\nEnrollment as an auditor is subject to the permission of the instructor and permitted only after students otherwise eligible to enroll in the course on a credit basis have had an opportunity to do so. Auditors are subject to the same fee structure as credit students.\n\nApplying to the University\n\nUndergraduate Application Procedures\n\nProspective students applying for part-time or full-time undergraduate programs of study must submit a completed undergraduate application. The $70 nonrefundable application fee should be paid online at the time of application via credit card or PayPal and may not be transferred or used to apply to another term. An alternate major may be requested on the application if desired by the university. The applications of persons denied admission to an impacted university may be redirected to another university at no cost, but only if the applicant is CSU eligible.\n\nThe CSU designates programs as impacted when more applications from regularly eligible applicants are received in the initial filing period (October and November for fall terms, June for winter terms, August for spring terms, February for summer terms) than can be accommodated. Some programs are impacted at every university which they are offered; others are impacted only at a few universities.\n\nCandidates for admission must meet all of the university's specified supplementary admission criteria if applying to an impacted program or university.\n\nThe CSU will announce during the fall filing period those CSUs or programs that are impacted. Detailed information on university and program impaction is available on the Impaction at the CSU website.\n\nYou must file your application for admission to an impacted program during the initial filing period. If you wish to be considered in impacted programs at two or more CSUs, you must file an application to each.\n\nApplicants from the Chico State service area will receive priority for admission if enrollment space becomes limited.\n\nReturning Students\n\nIf you are a returning student seeking admission after an absence of more than one semester, you must file an application for admission and a $70 fee to reactivate your student record. If you have been absent from the University on an approved Leave of Absence (LOA), you are not required to file an application for readmission or pay the $70 fee. For further information on educational leaves, see \"Leave of Absence\" in the Academic Policies and Regulations section. If you are not on an LOA, please visit the Office of Admissions website for further information.\n\nPlease note that if you were disqualified from Chico State, you must\n\nApply for readmission to the University through Cal State Apply, and\n\nFormally appeal for reinstatement to the University. You must be reinstated before your application for admission will be processed.\n\nIntrasystem and Intersystem Enrollment Programs\n\nFully matriculated students enrolled at any CSU have access to courses at other CSUs on a space-available basis unless those universities/programs are impacted. This access is offered without students being required to be formally admitted to the host university and in most cases without paying additional fees. Students should consult their home university academic advisors to determine how such courses may apply to their specific degree programs before enrolling at the host university.\n\nThere are two programs for enrollment within the CSU and one for enrollment between CSU and the University of California or California Community Colleges. Additional information about these programs is available from the Office of Admissions, 530-898-6321.\n\nCSU Fully Online Courses. Matriculated students in good standing may request enrollment in one course per term, offered by a CSU host university. Enrollment requests will be granted based on available space, as well as completion of any stated prerequisites. Credit earned at the host university is electronically reported to the student’s home university to be included on the student’s transcript at the home university.\n\nCSU Visitor Enrollment. Matriculated students in good standing enrolled at one CSU may enroll at another CSU for one term. Credit earned at the host university is reported at the student’s request to the home university to be included on the student’s transcript at the home university.\n\nIntersystem Cross Enrollment. Matriculated CSU, UC, or community college students may enroll on a “space available” basis for one course per term at another CSU, UC, or community college and request that a transcript of record be sent to the home university.\n\nInternational Student Application Procedures (Undergraduate)\n\nInformation regarding international student admission is available from International Admissions.\n\nIf you are an international student, a special international application is online at Cal State Apply. Students are strongly encouraged to submit applications by these deadlines:\n\nFall semesters—April 1\n\nSpring semesters—September 30\n\nLate applications are considered on a case-by-case basis. Please contact the International Admissions office to discuss submission of a late application at 530-898-5415 or apply@csuchico.edu.\n\nUse of Social Security Number\n\nApplicants are required to include their correct Social Security numbers in designated places on applications for admission pursuant to the authority contained in Section 41201, Title 5, California Code of Regulations, and Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6109).\n\nThe university uses the Social Security number to identify students and their records including identification for purposes of financial aid eligibility and disbursement and the repayment of financial aid and other debts payable to the institution. Also, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the university to file information returns that include the student’s Social Security number and other information such as the amount paid for qualified tuition, related expenses, and interest on educational loans. This information is used by the IRS to help determine whether a student, or a person claiming a student as a dependent, may take a credit or deduction to reduce federal income taxes. The Financial Aid and Scholarships Office will also use it to report Federal Work-Study earnings to the Federal Department of Education.\n\nNote: According to state law, the University will make separate provisions to the Social Security number requirement for any student who meets the AB 540 eligibility requirements.\n\nSteps in the Application Process\n\n1. Initial (Priority) Filing Periods\n\nDue to the high demand for admission to Chico State, first-time freshman and transfer applicants must apply during the initial filing period. All other applicants are strongly encouraged to do the same. All applications received electronically or postmarked during the initial filing period will be given equal consideration within established enrollment categories and quotas. If applying after the initial filing period, consult with the university admissions office for current information. Similar information is available at Cal State Apply.\n\nSemester's Initial Filing Period\n\nFall: October 1–November 30\n\nSpring: August 1–31\n\nEach non-impacted CSU accepts applications until capacities are reached. Many CSUs limit undergraduate admission in an enrollment category due to overall enrollment limits. If applying after the initial filing period, consult the university admissions office for current information and application filing procedures. Similar information is available at Cal State Apply.\n\n2. Application Acknowledgment\n\nApplicants may expect to receive an acknowledgment from Chico State within one week of filing the application. The notice may also include a request that applicants submit additional records necessary to evaluate academic qualifications. Applicants may be assured of admission if the evaluation of relevant qualifications indicates that applicants meet CSU admission requirements, and in the case of admission impaction, supplemental criteria for admission to an impacted program. Unless specific written approval/confirmation is received, an offer of admission is not transferable to another term or to another CSU.\n\n3. Transcripts and Test Scores\n\nFor specific information visit the Office of Admissions website or contact the office at 530-898-6322.\n\n4. Notification of Admission\n\nMany students are conditionally admitted based on their self-reported application information. It is crucial to submit requested documents in accordance with established deadlines to ensure verification of eligibility and to contact the Office of Admissions if anything reported on the application changes such as changes to work in progress or to future planned courses. Other applicants may be required to submit official documents before an admission decision can be made and risk having their application being withdrawn if these documents are not received by the communicated deadlines.\n\nInformation about advising, orientation, and registration procedures will be sent to you. Late applicants may miss some of the options open to those who file in a timely manner.\n\nChico State may conditionally admit first-time freshman applicants based on their academic preparation through the junior year of high school and that which is planned for the senior year. The university will verify the senior year of study to ensure that those so admitted complete their studies satisfactorily, including the required college preparatory subjects, and graduate from high school.\n\nChico State may conditionally admit upper-division transfer applicants based on their academic preparation at other regionally accredited institutions and that which is planned for the semester prior to their attendance at Chico State. The university will verify all college coursework completed to ensure that those so admitted complete their studies satisfactorily and meet admission requirements.\n\nAppeal of Admission Decision\n\nSection 89030.7 of the California Education Code requires that the CSU establishes specific requirements for appeal procedures for a denial of admission. Each CSU must publish appeal procedures for applicants denied admission to the university. The procedure is limited to addressing university decisions to deny an applicant admission to the university.\n\nAdmission appeal procedures must address the basis for appeals, provide 15 business days for an applicant to submit an appeal, stipulate a maximum of one appeal per academic term, provide specific contact information for the individual or office to which the appeal should be submitted and indicate a time estimate for when the university expects to respond to an appeal. The appeal procedures must be included in all denial of admission notifications to students and must also be published on the university website.\n\nChico State Admission Denial Appeal Policy\n\nIf you were denied admission, consideration for denial appeals is based on new, serious, and compelling information. You have 15 business days from the date you receive your denial letter in the mail to submit a hard copy letter of appeal to the Appeal Committee. The committee must see a demonstrated need to repeal the denial decision based on the new information being submitted. To submit an appeal, download the Appeal Coversheet and complete as directed. You are entitled to one appeal per academic term.\n\nHardship Petitions\n\nThe university has established procedures for consideration of qualified applicants who would be faced with extreme hardship if not admitted. Petitioners should write to the university Admission Office regarding specific policies governing hardship admission.\n\nReservation\n\nThe university reserves the right to select its students and deny admission to the university or any of its programs as the university, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate based on an applicant's suitability and the best interests of the university.\n\nAfter Admission\n\nTransfer Credit Evaluation\n\nOnce you have been admitted to the university and submitted your Intent to Enroll, an admission transfer advisor will analyze and report your advanced placement course credit, transfer, and other credit for which you may be eligible. Please note that you may not be correctly classified as to the proper class level until all transcripts have been received and properly evaluated.\n\nOnce you enroll, the Office of the Registrar will establish a permanent student record for you. This permanent record will eventually include your official transcript of all courses taken at Chico State and their associated grades. Your student record may also include a recording of additional credit for which you may be eligible by virtue of specific tests, examinations, and a summary record of all transfer credit from previous colleges or universities you may have attended, as well as an evaluation of how those credits may apply to academic program requirements at Chico State. See Academic Advising Programs for information regarding transfer credit evaluation and Student Records and Registration for additional discussion of records and registration processes and procedures.\n\nNew Student Advising and Orientation\n\nBefore the beginning of each semester, Orientation and New Student Programs coordinates new student orientation and advising sessions that provide the most comprehensive advising assistance Chico State offers to new students.\n\nPlacement Measures for First-Year GE Written Communication and Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning Courses\n\nFreshman skills assessment and placement for general education written communication and mathematics/quantitative reasoning shall be based on system-wide skills assessment standards that include the Early Assessment Program/Smarter Balanced Achievement Levels, ACT scores, and/or SAT scores, high school coursework, high school GPA, and math GPA. Skills assessments are not a condition for admission to the CSU; they are a condition of enrollment. These skills assessments are designed to inform entering freshmen of placement in appropriate baccalaureate-level courses based on their skills and needs.\n\nFirst-time freshmen in need of support as determined by the skills assessment will be placed in supported instruction. Supported instruction is designed to assist students in credit-bearing courses.\n\nAssessment and Placement Measures for GE Written Communications\n\nHas Fulfilled the GE Subarea A2 English Requirement\n\nThe student has met the requirement via completion of one of the following:\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP) Test\n\n3 or above: AP Language and Composition\n\n3 or above: AP Composition and Literature\n\nCollege Transfer Coursework\n\nCompleted approved college course that satisfies CSU GE Area A2 (written communication) with a grade of C- or better\n\nPlacement in a GE Subarea A2 English Course\n\nThe student has met the examination standards and/or multiple measures-informed standards via one of the criteria below:\n\nEnglish CAASPP/EAP Test:\n\nStandard Exceeded\n\nStandard Met and completed 12th grade approved year-long English course (CSU ERWC, AP, Weighted Honors English) with grade of C- or higher\n\nSAT English Test:\n\n550 or above\n\n510-540 and completed 12th grade approved year-long English course (CSU ERWC, AP, Weighted Honors English) with grade of C- or higher\n\nACT English Test:\n\n22 or higher\n\n19-21 and completed 12th grade approved year-long English course (CSU ERWC, AP, Weighted Honors English) with grade of C- or higher\n\nHigh School Courses and GPA:\n\nWeighted GPA 3.3 or above\n\nGPA 3.0 or above and completed 12th grade approved year-long English course (CSU ERWC, AP, Weighted Honors English) with grade of C- or higher\n\nGPA 3.0 or above and completed Honors English course\n\nGPA 3.0 or above and 5 or more years of high school English\n\nPlacement in a Supported GE Subarea A2 English Course\n\nThe student has met the examination standards and/or multiple measures-informed standards via one of the criteria below:\n\nSAT English Test:\n\n510-540 and 4 or more years of high school English\n\nACT Test:\n\n19-21 and 4 or more years of high school English\n\nHigh School Courses and GPA:\n\nWeighted GPA 3.0 or above and 4 or more years of high school English\n\nInternational Student English Placement Policy–International Non-native Speaker\n\nAll foreign non-native speakers of English must follow an ESL-designated track for completion of GE Area A2, unless they meet the domestic student SAT/ACT benchmark for being GE Ready.\n\nStudents without a qualifying English proficiency exam score or SAT/ACT score are placed in the English stretch course, EFLN 170.
