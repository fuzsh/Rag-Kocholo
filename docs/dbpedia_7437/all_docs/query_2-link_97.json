        "text": "RESERVATION ROAD\n\nUS, 2007, 102 minutes, Colour.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Connolly, Mira Sorvino, Elle Fanning, Eddie Alderson.\n\nDirected by Terry George.\n\nReservation Road is a rather harrowing film. It had strong credits but did not receive much cinema release, going straight to DVD. It was probably too much for the average audience who could identify with the characters and the situations and the emotions.\n\nThe film establishes two fathers and their relationship with their children. Joaquin Phoenix is a professor, devoted to his children. Mark Ruffalo is a disturbed man, a lawyer, separated from his wife, wanting custody of his son. He also, in a hurry to get home, is the perpetrator of a hit-run accident with the death of Phoenix’s son. He covers up.\n\nBoth actors are particularly good in their roles, credible for fathers in anguish for different reasons. Phoenix moves from a sympathetic father, to one obsessed with finding out who the perpetrator was, becoming more consumed with vengeance and alienating himself from his wife (Jennifer Connolly) and his daughter (Elle Fanning). By way of contrast, Ruffalo is callous, erratic and irresponsible, but gradually becomes more humanised by the experience of what he does, taping a confession for his son, finally confronting the angry Phoenix.\n\nThere are a number of coincidences in the film which work well enough on screen but, for those who are more literal-minded, it may seem too farfetched. Phoenix goes to a lawyer and hires Ruffaloas an investigator and adviser. In the meantime, his daughter has music lessons from Ruffalo’s ex-wife. The two sons had known each other briefly at school.\n\nHowever, the writing by novelist John Burnham Schwartz and director Terry George is strong, convincing, powerful and emotional.\n\nWhile the film focuses on the inadequacies of the justice system and also highlights the desire for vengeance, there is a balance in the different way that Phoenix’s wife handles the situation – and a culmination indicating that violence is not the final answer.\n\n1.The impact of the film, story, characters, harrowing, justice and the law, coping with grief?\n\n2.The Connecticut settings, affluent society, the affluent state and the comments by the college students about Connecticut?
