As a result, the Change of Control Severance Agreement entered into between the Company and each of Mr. Warmenhoven, Mr. Gomo and Mr. Mendoza provides that equity awards granted on or before June 19, 2008 will vest in full as to 100% of the unvested portion of the award. All outstanding equity awards granted after June 19, 2008 that are subject to time-based vesting will vest as to that portion of the award that would have vested through the 24 month period following the senior executives termination date had the senior executive remained employed through such period. Additionally, the senior executive will be entitled to accelerated vesting as to an additional 50% of the then unvested portion of all of his or her outstanding equity awards granted after June 19, 2008 that are scheduled to vest pursuant to performance-based criteria, if any.
