It's been lacking for earlier parts of history and still can be an issue in today's world. Diversity in the workplace focuses on the differences and similarities that people bring to an organization. Differences or similarities including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio–economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs, or other ideologies. For many companies, diversity of the workplace is an enormous strength that can attract job seekers, create a competitive advantage, resolve or prevent many internal conflicts, and helps give a better approach to many obstacles in every–day ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... With now knowing diversity better and knowing what to expect, let's focus on how it benefits the business side. When people feel respected and feel their differences are making a difference and being accommodated, they are then able to reach their full potential and therefore be more productive. Businesses operate and succeed better when all employees are on the same page, happy, and comfortable. Benefits we can expect from this include improved marketing and customer service. Improved morale results to improved retention and cost reductions, as well as causing as lower absenteeism and turnover. More employees will develop better creativity, problem–solving, and decision making abilities. Jobseekers especially top talent will see this productive, diverse company and be attracted to all of its wonderful opportunities and success. There will also be a reduced risk of discrimination lawsuits which results in better working environments. Government contracts look closely at minority, gender, and age balances, resulting in higher preference of the company if diversified. Not only in the government's eyes but the company as a whole will have a better corporate image which will promotes public goodwill. As you may see, diversity is a core factor in creating all these benefits for the company and its employees.

HP brought in Leo Apotheker to replace Hurd as CEO. Unfortunately for the company, Apotheker proved to be an incompetent leader who did not know how to succeed in the market and deal with the press. In August 2011, Apotheker decided to utilize a \"surprise press release\" to announce that HP was planning to spin off from its PC business. As a result of this unexpected announcement, investor confidence plummeted as did HP's stock price. After less than a year as CEO, HP's board of directors fired Apotheker. Meg Whitman, the next CEO who previously ran eBay, unfortunately took control of a company which dropped 50% in corporate value. (\"Leo Apotheker Dumped as HP CEO.\") Although Whitman possesses no experience in the IT industry, her past in politics and success at eBay has given HP hope that they can once again achieve sustained profitability.

Many feel that cloud is not yet a secure enough option for storing and processing mission critical or customer–sensitive data, and may never be. So it's important to evaluate security solutions provided by various vendors to see what data protection you will be receiving from a specific cloud vendor for your mission critical and sensitive data. Comparison of security solutions provided by four well known cloud service providers is listed as below.

Essay on HP's Institutionalization Process Institutionalization is an important part of any organizational development change process because it implies that there is a commitment, acceptance, and assimilation of the changes. Once organizational changes have been designed and implemented, employees will need to adapt to those changes and develop new patterns and habits. At this point, an organization will hopefully settle into a new set of balances and relative stability. During the institutionalization stage of a change process, employees begin to view the change not as something new but as a normal and an integral part of the organization's processes, systems, and structures. John Kotter's theory of institutionalization states that change can only be considered successful ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... 208). HP's code of ethics, known as the HP Way, was originally drafted by David Packard and has been cited as the source behind much of Hewlett Packard's success. \"Leaders die, products become obsolete, markets change, new technologies emerge, and management fads come and go, but core ideology in a great company endures as a source of guidance and inspiration\" (Harvard business review on change, 1998, p. 25). The HP Way was drafted around five core values including; a deep respect for the individuals, a dedication to affordable quality, and reliability. This ideology is what has held the organization together as it grew, developed, and expanded. However, opponents argue that the HP Way has also contributed to some of the company's difficulties in institutionalizing structural and behavioral changes. \"Founders Bill Hewlett and David Packard were renowned for emphasizing teamwork and respect for co–workers. But in recent years, that has translated into a bureaucratic, consensus–style culture that is at a sharp disadvantage in the Net–speed era\". (Burrows & Elstrom, 1999, p. 78). Stability of environment and technology: \"This involves the degree to which the organization's environment and technology are changing\" (Cummings & Worley, 2009, p. 204).

HP was Cisco's first publicly announced strategic alliance partner. The agreement between the two companies focused on technology collaboration, product integration, professional services, and customer support. The first contract lasted until February of 2002, when both HP and Cisco decided to further formalize and expand their alliance by signing a new contract. Shortly afterwards in March of 2002, HP merged with Compaq Computer, Inc. This temporarily slowed alliance activities between HP and Cisco. The \"new HP\" needed a few months to reorganize with the addition of Compaq. A few months later, in August of 2002, the alliance activities began to ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... During negotiations between HP and Cisco, they agreed that there needed to be a template for each individual business initiative. The template \"outlines the target market, how the products and services address the target market, how support and sales will work, and so on. This allows you to monitor progress against the template (7).\" Joint (?) metrics were critical, and also the alliance should be measured on things other than revenue generated. They also decided to develop join \"rules of engagement.\" The purpose of the rules of engagement was to ensure that the alliance was not depended on any one person or unit. The rules of engagement were posted on both company web pages and made public. A concern from both sides was product overlap. Lack of competition between the two sides was a key factor for success. For instance, the HP–Microsoft alliance worked because the two companies were never really competing. This was not the case for the HP–Cisco alliance. The alliance would not work if both sides were secretly hoping that the other partner would go out of business. There were some areas still where HP and Cisco were competing due to product overlap. To try to find a solution to the product overlap, it was critical that sales managers from both organizations met on a local and regional level.

Faced with the need of increasing volume, AMD considers essential to leverage the success obtained with Opteron to increase market share in other segments. The analysis of the data presented in the case indicates that there is still volume to make in the Server Segment and important issues to address in this same segment.

In spite of that, the reduced market share (in units) didn't affect AMD's market share that reached is high in mid 2006. According to this, two assumptions can be made: AMD's market share could be higher in 2006, and if its major clients keep loosing market share, AMD will be facing a short term problem in its most profitable segment (assuming that the loss of OEM's market share will not be compensated with the increase in demand, as verified in First Half of 2006); There is considerable volume to explore by AMD in other OEM players. Although there is no information available in the case about this considerable change, the hypothesis of a new major player in the market should be explored by AMD. 3 Company Analysis (SWOT) Servers and Workstations Segment Strenghts Better product than Intel's in performance and power consumption Innovation, R&D –­ ‐ Time–­ ‐to–­ ‐ market Customer–­ ‐Centric Market recogition in all product offer in the segment Opportunities Dell's mid–­ ‐ range and ...

Despite the design prowess of HP that went into the design of this product and the remarkable features HP was able to incorporate into this product, Kittyhawk turned out to be huge commercial failure.

Though they flash drives are more expensive than average disk drive at the time, being completely solid–state in nature, HP should anticipate multi–fold increase flash drive storage density over time, and decrease in costs due to economies of scales just like any other integrated circuits. HP faces a high cost of production with Kittyhawk to include the shock sensor for meeting the ruggedness requirements demanded by the market. With their ruggedness, flash drives will be unbeatable either in mobile computing or embedded products areas, where the market for 1.3\" drives seem to exist. 1.8–inch disk drives, with higher storage capacity than 1.3\" will be the preferred option and a better fit for applications planned around the use of Microsoft's new Windows CE operating system, which requires more memory than is possible with 1.3\" disk drives.

The changes that Dudley recommends are intelligent in that he recognizes the importance of the technological environments on the company's success. By focusing on innovation and upstream selling HP will be able to make more technological advancements. They need to ear top management respect and not be limited or they will become followers rather than leaders in the industry. Also the employees are the most important ingredient in the recipe to a successful organization. If the HP salespeople are not satisfied their attitude will begin to affect their performance on which the entire HP company's success hinders upon. It is evident through Dudley's audit that HP employees are not satisfies and feel they are being overworked and stretched to their limits. The fact that they are consciously ignoring opportunities because it would take too much time away from existing relationships is an issue that will eventually lead to the demise of the organization. If HP does not act on Dudley's recommendations for the restructuring of the sales strategy and force HP could begin to fade as industry leader. Although HP CEO Lew Platt is nervous to yet again overhaul the structuring of the sales force it is a necessary change that can and must be implemented.

Compatibility becomes an issue when trying to transfer files between computers with different operating systems. Compatibility also plays an issue with hardware. It is not possible to connect Apple computers to projectors without purchasing an adaptor from Apple. This forces users to purchase extra products that are required for students and working people. A major strength that Apple has over its competitors is their reputation for high quality products, which are both functional and well designed. Apple is known to have some the most well designed products on the market during the time frame, and they have yet to fail in that aspect. They are said to have some of the \"best looking\" products available in the market. When it comes to the marketing aspect of their products, they would be the leading company in the personal computer industry.

In these commercials, they insinuated that PC users are boring and old while Mac users are trendy and modern. Apple also has a reputation of overpricing their products, and so this may be a major weakness, but at the same time is just a part of their marketing.

Innovative Products Of Supply Chain Management Innovative products in supply chain management have a very high uncertainty life span in terms of demand from consumers. Not only is the uncertainty of demand an important factor, it is also important for companies to understand how and when to share information with partners and customers along the supply chain in order to please the consumers demand, and stay two steps ahead of demand uncertainty. Innovative products also have higher cost, and they are very difficult to forecast. Although, it is not an easy process, it can very well be done. The main concern is consistent communication and hard work from Distribution Center (DC) management, Supply Chain managers and directors, operation managers, etc. Furthermore, maintaining a high–quality communication through the supply chain will improve and control logistics costs, and will definitely make the supply chain more competent.

Questions: HP and Management QUESTION 1 HP knows and appreciates successful projects because it understands that when done correctly it can take them happily to the bank. Two thirds of its recent revenues of some $40 billion came from products found in projects over the last couple of years (97). This is hardly an insignificant fact in its own right in a field where being creative and innovative is directly responsible for determining which players last and which do not. Many companies have tried to exist on what they have done in the past and others have tried too hard to make projects into more than they can be. Successful projects, in the many ways that this can be viewed, are those that have gone through the steps of development and thus effectively reflect what has worked. Founder Bill Hewlett has been credited with having a single metric for determining his assessment of a person's work in the HP company; he is said to have looked at what the responsible person rejected. Apparently Hewlett reasoned that \"if the rejects looked good, then the projects that were accepted must be excellent\" (101). Successful projects, however, mean more to HP than just their cash returns. They also symbolize a number of other notable acknowledgements that are worth highlighting.

Therefore Mr. Heal and Mr. Thomas will need to develop a joint business plan whereby both firms can leverage the alliance without impeding on creativity, future development, or current product offerings. A third challenge facing Mr. Heal and Mr. Thomas is the issue of a sales force that is properly setup to accommodate the strategic alliance. On page six of the case, we learn that the HP–Microsoft and IBM–Cisco alliances both utilized dedicated sales staff. We also learn that in Europe, \"HP used a specialized, dedicated sales force for selling HP services bundled with Cisco products.\" (Page 6) In fact, Elias Stephan, who was then HP services group's global alliance director, noted that \"In Europe, the relationship with the field is much better.\" (Page 6) If both HP and Cisco were used to utilizing dedicated sales staff with strategic alliances, what incentive was there for both firms to break the trend when dealing with an HP–Cisco alliance? Page eight of the case begins to outline some of the challenges that the HP–Cisco alliance had already faced concerning the sale of joint products. For example, we learn that at HP, Cisco products did not count towards a sales representative's quota and this resulted in a decline in sales of Cisco equipment by HP sales representatives.

Currently the margins Inventec makes on its Notebook PC's are low and tough competition is pushing the margins even lower. Inventec's reliance on HP–Compaq puts the company in danger of going out of business should HP–Compaq suddenly decide to take their business elsewhere. It is imperative that Inventec diversify its products and increase its customer base. Inventec's ability to create sophisticated software is considered to be one of its strengths and something that competitors have found difficult to match. The current market line of low margin Notebook PC's does not take full advantage of Inventec's software capabilities. Inventec should try to separate its proprietary software from its hardware products and capitalize on its superiority. The company should analyze whether to model their software outsourcing business after the Indian software firm, Wipro. Many of the customers of Wipro, such as HP, already do business with Inventec and they could capitalize on their existing relationships. Greater software margins would increase their overall profit margins. Inventec could attempt to increase its margins by selling their hardware, including Notebook PC's, directly to retail stores and customers. This is an option to explore because they could decrease costs by eliminating the middleman. At this point, selling its own products is not a good option, because Inventec is too dependent on business from HP–Compaq to risk ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n56.

With a larger number of street light installations, the city will experience greater energy demands. The LED pilot project which has already been initiated has installed LED street lighting into various areas and neighborhoods within Edmonton. By converting to LED lights instead of the usual HPS lights as the preferred street light, the city is expecting to see a considerable reduction in electricity usage. According to GRAH Lighting (n.d.), \"LED street lights use 40–80% less electricity and have at least 5 times the life expectancy than regular High Pressure Sodium (HPS) fixtures\" (para. 22). As Edmonton is committed to sustainable practices, it must be willing to change over to more environmentally sources of street lighting.
