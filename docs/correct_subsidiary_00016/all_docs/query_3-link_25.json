        "text": "SM Without Licensing (retired)\n\nSM without licensing included Systems Manager Legacy and the SM Free 100 program. Systems Manager Legacy networks have not received any new features since 3/12/2015, while Free 100 networks have a limit on the number of devices that can be enrolled. These two network types are not eligible for phone support, with the following additional notes:\n\nUnlicensed SM users who own Cisco Meraki hardware equipment are eligible for complimentary email support.\n\nUnlicensed SM users with no other Cisco Meraki equipment are not eligible for complimentary email support, however, our documentation and SM forum are available for troubleshooting help.\n\nFor Systems Manager Legacy and SM Free 100, licenses can be purchased on a per-device basis. Applying an Enterprise SM license will override Legacy and Free 100 status, not add on top of it. For example, to manage 150 devices in SM, a license for 150+ devices would need to be applied to the account.\n\nIf a non-SM license key is added as “Renewal”, this will not override the Legacy or Free 100 SM. When the license key is added it will take you to the Licensing Preview page where you can see the affect of the license key application."
