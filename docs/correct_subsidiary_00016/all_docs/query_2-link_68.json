        "text": "The Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 is a business-class conferencing station for large meeting rooms and executive offices. The Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 enhances people-centric collaboration by delivering easy-to-use audio conferencing with astounding voice quality and clarity. Newly developed microphones and loudspeakers provide the richest sound of any conference phone on the market. The unique acoustic design includes a \"studio-monitor\" full-range speaker. This loudspeaker architecture provides a dynamic, detailed sound with low distortion and low-frequency clarity, making conferencing an in-person experience with exceptionally clear and natural audio quality.\n\nThe Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 provides a simple, flexible, scalable solution that meets the challenges of the most diverse rooms. With the base unit alone, it provides 360-degree coverage for any 20x20-foot room and up to 10 participants. With the optional wired extension microphone kit, it covers any 20x34-foot room and up to 22 participants. With the optional wireless extension microphone kit (using Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications [DECT] technology), it covers any 20x40-foot room and up to 26 participants. With a daisy-chain configuration of two 8832 units along with the optional wireless extension microphone kit, it covers up to a 20x57-foot room and up to 42 participants. It is ideal for executive offices, conference rooms, and boardrooms.\n\nThe 8832 unit has a sleek form by using approachable materials for a differentiated, modern look and feel. The key design elements include the following: 3.9-inch 480x128-pixel color LCD; Textile cover for soft touch and durability; Large mute button in the middle of the device for easy access from all angles; LED indicator above the mute button showing the call status; Crisp, precise button tactility; Single USB-C port on the device to minimize the number of cables on the table (an Ethernet injector is required for any non-Wi-Fi deployment).\n\nThe optional wired microphone kit includes two wired microphones with anodized aluminum top housing."
