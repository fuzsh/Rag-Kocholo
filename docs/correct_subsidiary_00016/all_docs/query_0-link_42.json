        "text": "Greg joined NEA in 2017 where he focuses on investments in the technology sector. Greg has founded three successful companies, is the inventor of technology at the heart of today’s wireless phone and service industries, and has over 25 years of executive experience in several technology sectors including networking, cloud software, consumer services, wireless and military systems.\n\nAfter a successful early career as an engineering executive, Greg returned to Stanford University where he discovered modern MIMO radio communication theory and invented MIMO OFDM to bridge his theory to practice. Greg then founded Clarity Wireless to commercialize this technology, which is now used in all 4G and 5G wireless devices and networks, serving billions of consumers and business users. Clarity was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1999. Following Cisco, Greg founded his second company Airgo Networks, acquired by Qualcomm in 2007. Airgo’s chipset products improved the speed and reliability of Wi-Fi by ten-fold, leading to adoption of its technology as the core of all Wi-Fi radio standards since 2006. Greg is also the founder and Managing Board Director of Headwater Research, an incubator that develops mobile operating system and cloud technology that underpins today’s mobile phone and app industries. Greg holds over 400 issued US and international patents in several fields."
