        "text": "A cluster of vendors led by Cisco Systems Inc. and Broadcom\n\nCorp. took the wraps off a wireless technology last week that they hope will put MCI\n\nWorldCom Inc. and Sprint Communications Co. on course to challenge cable in the\n\nbroadband-services arena.\n\nIf the new wireless-broadband system -- targeted for\n\nmultichannel-multipoint-distribution-service spectrum and other microwave tiers -- works\n\nas planned, it will allow MCI, Sprint and other players in fixed-wireless services to\n\ndeliver a full slate of video, voice and high-speed data to homes and small businesses\n\nwithout stinting on coverage or service variety.\n\n\"The most encouraging part of this development is that\n\nit really validates our choice of wireless as a medium for delivering broadband services\n\nto the mass market,\" Sprint spokesman Russ Robinson said.\n\nUnderlying the new wireless-broadband platform is a\n\ntechnology known as \"vector orthoganal frequency-division multiplexing,\"\n\ndeveloped over the past four years by Clarity Wireless Inc., which Cisco acquired one year\n\nago.\n\nCisco is making the technology available free-of-charge to\n\nBroadcom and other chip-makers in an effort to establish it as a de facto industry\n\nstandard that maximizes the broadband-service potential of microwave-based delivery\n\nsystems, director of marketing for broadband fixed wireless Steve Smith said.\n\n\"Our game is to get fixed wireless moving as a viable\n\ncompetitor to cable and DSL [digital subscriber line],\" Smith said. \"We've\n\nchosen this technology as the one to back because it delivers both a higher spectral\n\nefficiency and a higher link efficiency than anything we've seen.\"\n\nBroadcom -- which is supplying chips for the current\n\nwireless-broadband market, founded in QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) and QPSK\n\n(quadrature phase shift key) technologies -- is swinging behind VOFDM for the same reason,\n\nvice president of marketing Tim Lindenfelser said. \"This technology overcomes the\n\nsevere line-of-sight and other limitations of other approaches to MMDS,\" he added.\n\nWhile MCI and Sprint plan to launch next-generation\n\nwireless-broadband systems as soon as the first quarter of 2000, Broadcom will be in a\n\nposition to supply VOFDM chips to systems and customer-premises-equipment makers early\n\nenough next year to meet deployment schedules for most carriers' wireless-broadband\n\ndeployments, Lindenfelser said.\n\nRobinson said that while the new system offered\n\n\"exciting\" possibilities, Sprint has issued a request for proposals for initial\n\nmarket build-outs, and it would be unfair to vendors responding to that RFP to give an\n\nunqualified thumbs-up to a new system that has yet to be fully tested.\n\n\"We've looked at [VOFDM], and we are looking\n\nforward to what these guys come up with,\" he added.\n\nTogether, MCI and Sprint have secured control of MMDS in\n\n120 markets representing 60 percent of U.S. households, with 80 markets now falling under\n\nSprint's umbrella, Robinson said. By the end of the second quarter, Sprint plans to\n\nhave 10 cities operational on the new wireless-broadband platform, which starts with\n\nhigh-speed two-way data and one-way cable and later adds voice services, he added.\n\n\"We'll be operational in 30 markets by the end of\n\n2000,\" he said. The first 10 include Phoenix, San Francisco and Detroit -- where\n\ncompanies acquired by Sprint were already operating -- as well as seven other markets to\n\nbe named later.\n\nThe new \"BCM2200\" ASIC (application-specific\n\nintegrated circuit) -- which combines VOFDM technology and media-access control in a\n\nsingle chip -- will be priced low enough to allow manufacturers to deliver customer\n\nequipment at costs nearly on par with cable gear, Lindenfelser said.\n\n\"The main difference [in cost] is the antenna,\n\nalthough there's some trade-off there with the cost of the tuner that's required\n\nin cable,\" he noted.\n\nLindenfelser declined to set a delivery date for commercial\n\nproduct, but he said samples of the new ASIC would be available to manufacturers in the\n\nfirst half of 2000.\n\nOne reason why Broadcom can proceed so fast and so cheaply\n\nis because it is tapping the same MAC technology used in DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service\n\nInterface Specification) chips, officials said. They also noted that the VOFDM technology\n\nhas gone through several development phases over the past four years, giving the partners\n\nconfidence that any further design refinements before volume production would be\n\nrelatively minor.\n\nVOFDM involves two basic techniques that backers said will\n\nallow network operators to achieve high levels of market coverage with enough bandwidth\n\nper user to support everything from voice to high-definition TV. This is a tall order,\n\ngiven the fact that operators only have approximately 200 megahertz of spectrum to work\n\nwith.\n\nThe vector part of the nomenclature refers to the fact that\n\nthe system uses spatial diversity. That means it uses a dual-feed antenna receiver at the\n\nend-user premises to capture signals coming in from separate paths and combines them to\n\nmaximize the signal-to-noise ratio at any given frequency.\n\nThis helps to strengthen the signals bouncing off\n\nreflective surfaces, reaching users that are not in direct line of sight of the\n\ntransmitter, Lindenfelser noted.\n\nSpectral efficiency -- which maximizes the number of bits\n\nper hertz, or cycle of frequency -- is achieved through the orthoganal frequency-division\n\nmultiplexing aspect of the technology, where the number of bits inserted into thin slices\n\nof frequency, or \"frequency bins,\" depends on the noise-tolerance level within\n\neach frequency segment.\n\n\"We pack a lot of carriers into the spectrum and\n\nweight them based on signal-to-noise [ratio], which gets away from the modulation-capacity\n\nlimitations you encounter when you use a single carrier over a 6-MHz channel,\" Smith\n\nsaid.\n\nThe result is a system that delivers 20 megabits per second\n\nin a 6-MHz channel to all users, wherever they happen to be, Broadcom product-line manager\n\nPete LaRocca said.\n\nMoreover, the chip, operating at baseband, can apply the\n\nmodulation technique to a signal that's destined to go out at virtually any\n\nfrequency, whether it's at the 1.9-gigahertz level of PCS (personal-communications\n\nservices) or at the 28-GHz level of LMDS (local multipoint distribution service).\n\nBut it's MMDS -- and specifically the high-volume\n\ndemand anticipated from a combined MCI and Sprint -- that comprises the immediate targets\n\nfor the development activities of the new alliance.\n\n\"We think this technology is what Sprint and WorldCom\n\nneed to be successful as providers of broadband services over fixed-wireless local-access\n\nnetworks,\" Smith said.\n\nOther players signing on with the initiative include\n\nMotorola Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., Samsung Telecommunications America Inc., Toshiba\n\nAmerica Consumer Products, Pace Micro Technology plc, Bechtel Telecommunications, LCC\n\nInternational, Electronic Data Systems Corp. and KPMG International."
