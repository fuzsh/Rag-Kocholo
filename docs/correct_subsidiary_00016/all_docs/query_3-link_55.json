Started out life as an IT geek for the better part of fifteen years before moving into Information Architecture, Complex Problems Solving, Facilitation and Dialogue Mapping. Still have the geek side of my brain there, but have spent the last few years in many interesting projects in an organisational development and sensemaking role. Since 2007, I've been the owner of a consultancy called Seven Sigma (www.sevensigma.com.au) and the author of the Cleverworkarounds (www.cleverworkarounds.com) blog. Also a partner of Inovus (www.inovus.com.au) - a consultancy that combines some incredible skills into one place. I like to play piano, listen to heavy metal music and watch dumb movies :-)\n\nResponsible for proof of concept designs for the Internet of Everything. Maximum Balance Foundation with the assistance of key partners referenced by California Department of Apprenticeship Standards (file # 29710) and DAS Form #7 signature participation, teaches students to analyze, test, troubleshoot, and evaluate existing network systems, such as local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), and Internet systems or a segment of a network system. Cisco Career Certifications and California Apprenticeship Certification We offer five levels of network certification: Entry, Associate, Professional, Expert and Architect, the highest level of accreditation within the Cisco Career Certification program. The program focuses on developing, prototyping and networking those products to the internet, and places a strong emphasis on growing the people and leaders behind the project in an effort to instill strong ethics, morals and a sense of responsibility to their community. As part of the main benefits of membership, we provide Funding Opportunities for select startup Members when their company is ready to raise a seed stage round of funding. In addition, CityLab, LLC. provides seed stage funding to specific Member and non-member companies that meet our investment criteria. We also provide introductions to angel investors and early stage VC firms from our investor network. I typically take a retainer of half of my overall fee in the following milestones schedule: Agreement Signed: $200 administrative fee. Contractor Commitment: $2000 Plans and Permitting Submitted: $3000\n\nContractor since 2006, teacher and trainer. I accompanied several major accounts in their IT infrastructure restructuring process. Beyond the customer's first idea, we start by redefining the real needs and objectives , vision of IT infrastructure evolution and impact on target solutions. We then define a compatible business constraints blueprint. I am also involved in monitoring the implementation of the master plan and project management . Between catchy presentations of major market players and the real needs of the customer, there is often a gap and useless investment or poorly routed . I can help you to see things from a different angle. Entrepreneur depuis 2006, professeur en école d'ingénieur et formateur. J'ai accompagné plusieurs grands comptes dans la démarche de restructuration de leurs infrastructures IT. Au delà de la première idée du client, nous commençons par redéfinir les véritables besoins et objectifs du client, sa vision de l'évolution de son infrastructure IT et les répercussions sur les solutions cibles. Nous définissions ensuite un schéma directeur compatible avec les contraintes métier et business. J'interviens également dans le suivi de la mise en place du schéma directeur et dans la gestion de projets. Entre les présentations accrocheuses des grands acteurs du marché et le besoin véritable du client, il y a souvent un gap et de l'investissement inutile ou mal aiguillé.
