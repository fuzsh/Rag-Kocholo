ACQUISITION INTEGRATION FOR MANUFACTURING<br />Executive summary <br />Cisco Systems was founded in 1984 by Leonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner, husband and wife computer scientists at Stanford University who invented a technology to link their disparate computer systems together. Bosack and Lerner developed the first “multi-protocol” router – a specialized microcomputer that sat between two or more networks and allowed them to “talk” to each other by deciphering, translating, and funneling data between them. Cisco’s technology opened up the potential of linking all of the world’s disparate computer networks.<br />In the past 15 years Cisco has acquired and integrated companies at a rate of approximately 8/ year. Cisco typically takes a “consume” approach to integrating acquired companies. Because of changing business conditions. Cisco has bought larger model. Cisco IT has adopted a new integration process. Called C5 (capture, consume, connect , combine, and consolidate). <br />Introduction <br />This report performs a strategic analysis on the Cisco system Inc. Cisco system is a information technology organization that provides network solution with potential of linking all of the worlds desperate computer network together This report develops the strategic analysis of Cisco systems through a focus on four foci of organizational analysis.

For example, one can receive a voicemail message and choose to access it through e-mail or a cell phone. If the sender is online according to the presence information and currently accepts calls, the response can be sent immediately through text chat or video call. Otherwise, it may be sent as a non-real-time message that can be accessed through a variety of media.<br />Cisco with it strong financial position, high technology, efficient management team with high skill employee coming from different companies acquired do not only have the financial ability but also the skill needed to produce and market unified communication. <br />The high demand for unified communication also serve as a potential profit sources so is highly recommended cisco produce it. The advantages and disadvantages of producing unified communication are mention below <br />Advantage:<br />Gain competitive advantage through new product development: In today’s competitive world, companies do not compete on price or delivery alone. Introduction of new products or new product features has become a main source of competitive advantage. So developing unified communication which is new and in high demand can give Cisco that competitive advantage.<br />Retain existing customer base and increase profitability: unified communication will help cisco gain new customers, retain existing customers and increase profitability. Customer’s needs keeps changing with time. In order it retain current customers, cisco must constantly adapt to meet the changing requirements.<br />Retain market share: cisco can retain its current market share by introducing products with newer & improved features like unified which was in high demand. And thus sales is bound to increase generating large profit giving him large portion of the market <br />Improve brand awareness and confidence with his customers: many customers are brand loyal. With cisco introducing a new product (unified) that meet the need of customers, many will be become loyal to that brand and in effect loyal to the whole cisco brand\n\n39. Raise the barriers to entry cisco can raise new barriers to entry through new product development by constantly keep releasing new products at regular intervals, so that competitor cannot catch-up and this also discourages new entrants into the market who cannot meet the pace of production.Disadvantage <br />Might cannibalize sales of previous product: Having a new product take sales away from an existing product is not usually an attractive situation for a firm. Like cisco introducing unified communication it might reduce the sales of other related product like data communication.\n\n40. Would require expensive redesign of new product: unified communication needs extensive and expensive redesign of the overall engineering system which is which will not really be easy to implement. Also the cost of acquiring skill laborers and research and development cost are high which may not be easy to implement\n\n41. Customers might not like the features of the new product: product development involves a risk of whether the consumers will like the new features that have been developed/added to the new/existing product. Merging with sprint through forward vertical integration<br /> <br />About Sprint Nextel<br />Sprint Nextel offers a comprehensive range of wireless and wire line communications services. its served more than 52 million customers at the end of 2011 and is widely recognized for developing, engineering and deploying innovative technologies, including the first wireless 4G service from a national carrier in the United States; offering industry-leading mobile data services, leading prepaid brands including Virgin Mobile USA, Boost Mobile, and Assurance Wireless; instant national and international push-to-talk capabilities; and a global Tier 1 Internet backbone. Newsweek ranked Sprint No. 6 in its 2010 Green Rankings, listing it as one of the nation’s greenest companies, the highest of any telecommunications company. <br />Advantage: <br />Reduce cost of leveraging it distribution channel and transport cost\n\n42. Capture upstream profit that usually accrues only to sprint.\n\n43. Reduce competition. Cisco merging with sprint will give it the competitive advantage over it competitor since sprint was a major consumer of network and communication products giving Cisco greater sales over his competitors\n\n44. Lead expansion of core competencies in businesses: They would gain advantage in one of the world’s biggest consumer of network product which also has a good reputation for providing services that enhance customer satisfaction. Cisco will gain experience in developing lower cost and better products that enhance customer satisfactions\n\n45. Increase public aware and confidence. Merging with one of the largest dealer of network equipment, this will increase Cisco public awareness and built confidence among his consumers of other product of the reliability and quality of Cisco products\n\n46. Disadvantages\n\n47. Capacity balancing issues. For example cisco need to build excess upstream capacity to ensure that it downstream operation( sprint) have sufficient supply under all condition\n\n48. Increase bureaucracy. Cisco already has complexity in solving problem due to it large nature ( 25 different companies), merging with sprint will only worsen the situation\n\n49. Clashes of culture between cisco and sprint employees can occur, reducing the effectiveness. And the motivation for work\n\n50. May need to make some workers redundant, especially at management levels this may have an effect on motivation.
