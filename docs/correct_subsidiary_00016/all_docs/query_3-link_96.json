Cisco is a large technology company known for its aggressive acquisition strategy between 1993-2000 when it acquired around 70 companies. However, around one-third of these acquisitions failed, costing Cisco significant time, money, and resources. Cisco's acquisition strategy lacked integration with change management processes, leading to high failure rates as it struggled to incorporate new acquisitions into its business operations and culture. Going forward, Cisco needs a comprehensive acquisition strategy tied to robust change management to reduce failure rates and make acquisitions more successful.",
