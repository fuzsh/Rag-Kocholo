        "text": "Joint Technology Offerings Deliver New Capabilities to Customers\n\nINTEL DEVELOPER FORUM, San Francisco, Aug. 23, 2005 - Intel Corporation and Cisco Systems, Inc. today announced an expansion of their existing alliance to deliver new capabilities that enhance the reliabilty of wireless LANs and deliver higher-quality services, and allow enterprises to use computers and the network as a combined defense against security threats.\n\nCreating Business Class Wireless LANs\n\nCisco and Intel have jointly produced a new set of features, called Business Class Wireless Suite, designed for companies using Cisco's Unified Wireless Architecture and Intel® Centrino mobile technology. The Suite includes:\n\nOptimal access point (AP) selection technology to enable Intel Centrino mobile technology-based clients to scan for the best AP for faster, more reliable and efficient roaming within a business wireless LAN.\n\nEnhanced Voice over IP (VoIP) quality of service (QoS) technology to improve the audio clarity and enable reliable voice communications for laptops.\n\nBusiness Class Wireless Suite provides an enhanced set of capabilities that makes wireless LANs more robust for the enterprise, supporting enhanced roaming and business applications such as Voice over IP. Business Class Wireless Suite reinforces the previous efforts between Intel and Cisco with regard to the development of the Cisco Compatible Extensions (CCX) program for wireless LAN client interoperability.\n\nBusiness Class Wireless Suite features will be available from Cisco and Intel in the first quarter of 2006.\n\nCombining Forces on Security\n\nIntel will join the Network Admission Control (NAC) program, an industry effort led by Cisco to help customers identify, prevent, and adapt to security threats, and Cisco will join the Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) program. Intel® AMT is part of Intel's Digital Office initiative providing capabilities to make new levels of IT manageability possible. With Cisco NAC interoperating with Intel AMT, enterprises will be better able to defend against security threats, helping to maintain user and business productivity and reduce the cost of security attacks and improve system remediation.\n\nCustomers can expect Cisco NAC and Intel AMT to be compatible in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n\"Our expanded strategic alliance with Intel on security and wireless demonstrates our commitment to deliver unified solutions that drive higher levels of usability, performance and security for our customers,\" said Charles Giancarlo, chief development officer at Cisco Systems. \"Business Class Wireless aims to provide the best wireless experience by enabling a better user experience for Intel clients running over Cisco wireless enterprise infrastructure. Security continues to be a major concern for organizations, and with Intel representing the first silicon manufacturer to join the NAC industry effort, client devices can continue to be treated as trusted elements on the network.\"\n\n\"Businesses increasingly rely on computing and network infrastructure to improve the way they interact and conduct their business,\" said Sean Maloney, executive vice president and general manager of the Intel Mobility Group. \"Our continued collaboration with Cisco combines our two companies' strengths in computing and networking to drive the convergence of these technologies and enable new, innovative uses of technology. As the first networking company to join the Intel AMT program, Cisco brings an important perspective on the role of the network in securing and managing IT assets.\"\n\nAbout the Cisco and Intel Alliance\n\nThrough their global alliance, Cisco and Intel intend to enable organizations and consumers to improve the way they do business, interact and stay connected through innovative, standards-based solutions. Joint efforts include bringing end-to-end wireless solutions to enterprise customers, accelerating the transition to Gigabit Ethernet networks and simplifying the operation of secure home networks.

More than 25,000 technology experts come together at IDF in more than a dozen countries each year. Visit www.intel.com/idf for more information.\n\nAbout Cisco Systems\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO), the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet, this year celebrates 20 years of commitment to technology innovation, industry leadership, and corporate social responsibility.
