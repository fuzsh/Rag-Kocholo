        "text": "Intel Corporation and Cisco Systems announced an expansion of their existing\n\nalliance to deliver new capabilities that enhance the reliability of wireless\n\nLANs and deliver higher-quality services. It allows enterprises to use computers\n\nand the network as a combined defense against security threats.\n\nThe two companies have jointly produced a new set of features, called\n\nBusiness Class Wireless Suite, designed for companies using Cisco's Unified\n\nWireless Architecture and Intel Centrino mobile technology. The Suite includes:\n\nOptimal access point (AP) selection technology to enable Intel Centrino mobile\n\ntechnology-based clients to scan for the best AP for faster, more reliable and\n\nefficient roaming within a business wireless LAN. It also has Enhanced Voice\n\nover IP (VoIP) quality of service (QoS) technology to improve the audio clarity\n\nand enable reliable voice communications for laptops.\n\nThe suite provides an enhanced set of capabilities that makes wireless LANs\n\nmore robust for the enterprise, supporting enhanced roaming and business\n\napplications such as VoIP. It reinforces the previous efforts between Intel\n\nand Cisco with regard to the development of the Cisco Compatible Extensions (CCX)\n\nprogram for wireless LAN client interoperability. These features will be\n\navailable from Cisco and Intel in the first quarter of 2006.\n\nIntel will join the Network Admission Control (NAC) program, an industry\n\neffort led by Cisco to help customers identify, prevent, and adapt to security\n\nthreats, and Cisco will join the Intel Active Management Technology (AMT)\n\nprogram. Intel AMT is part of Intel's Digital Office initiative, providing\n\ncapabilities to make new levels of IT manageability possible.\n\nWith Cisco NAC interoperating with Intel AMT, enterprises will be better\n\nable to defend against security threats, helping to maintain user and business\n\nproductivity and reduce the cost of security attacks and improve system\n\nremediation. Customers can expect Cisco NAC and Intel AMT to be compatible in\n\nthe fourth quarter of this year.\n\n\"Our expanded strategic alliance with Intel on security and wireless\n\ndemonstrates our commitment to deliver unified solutions that drive higher\n\nlevels of usability, performance and security for our customers,\" said\n\nCharles Giancarlo, Chief Development Officer at Cisco Systems. \"Security\n\ncontinues to be a major concern for organizations, and with Intel representing\n\nthe first silicon manufacturer to join the NAC industry effort, client devices\n\ncan continue to be treated as trusted elements on the network.\"\n\n\"Businesses increasingly rely on computing and network infrastructure\n\nto improve the way they interact and conduct their business,\" said Sean\n\nMaloney, Executive VP and GM of the Intel Mobility Group. \"Our continued\n\ncollaboration with Cisco combines our two companies' strengths in computing\n\nand networking to drive the convergence of these technologies and enable new,\n\ninnovative uses of technology. As the first networking company to join the\n\nIntel AMT program, Cisco brings an important perspective on the role of the\n\nnetwork in securing and managing IT assets.\""
