        "text": "Not intending to hijack thread, but I concur with your sentiments mark9586. This cloud based controller, in my paranoid(realistic) mind is another potential exploitable, and unnecessary weakness, that makes all of your equipment dependent on an internet connection.\n\nI prefer having the controller be a teminal window with a console cable, or at least a local network based connection, with all of the logic residing on the device. Not quite there with cloud based controllers for smaller deployments. I can see the ease and benefits for a large deployment, or something like a stadium with lots of devices, and little to no sensitive data.\n\nThe bottom line is it creates a market where the vendor can charge less up front for the devices, knowing they will get recurring revenue from the subscription.\n\nmark9586 wrote:\n\nNot just AP’s. Switches, firewalls and routers too. They call it a “single pane of glass” for management. But so is SSH. One terminal emulator is all I need and I don’t need a subscription to run it!\n\nThere is an annual licence fee to pay per device (can be bought in multiple year options) which can make ROI difficult to realise quickly. On the flipside the theory is the network can be “light” on network admins so arguably there is a saving to be made there. But having seen them, anyone setting them up still needs some network chops 'cos spanning tree, VLAN’s ACL’s/firewalls and routing are still needed and need to be understood. Plug and play they ain’t.\n\nFinally for me, they lack the full feature set of “proper” Cisco. What they do have is there limited features presenting pretty pictures and pie charts to woo the non-technicals into buying them. I trialed them and rejected them pretty quickly on a pure cost basis."
