He sold more than 250 million copies of his books worldwide, which have been translated into forty languages and adapted into fifteen films. He wrote a number of global bestsellers, including The Lost World: Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, Congo, Sphere, Rising Sun, Disclosure, Airframe, and The Great Train Robbery. His influence and creativity extended far beyond books â€“he was the creator of the landmark television series ER, which ran for fifteen seasons, won twenty-three Primetime Emmy Awards, and received 124 Emmy nominations. He cowrote the screenplays of Jurassic Park and Twister and wrote and directed the film Westworld, which served as the basis for the HBO series. Crichton is the only writer in history to have a number one book, film, and television series at the same time, and he did it twice.\n\nLearn More"
