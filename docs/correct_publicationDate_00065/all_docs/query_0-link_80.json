        "text": "Published: 1975\n\nGenre: historical fiction\n\nLength: 266 pages\n\nSetting: 1850s in England\n\nInterest: I was looking for a different book (something I often do at the library) and happened to walk by a collection of Crichton’s books. When I glanced over the books, this was one I didn’t remember reading, so I picked it up.\n\nSummary: Edward Pierce had decided to steal a shipment of gold for the British Army in the Crimea. In order to do so, he has to determine the location of the four keys to the safes. Once he’s located the keys, he has to get access to them long enough to make a copy. The, he has to get his safecracker access to the safes while they are on the train. He accomplishes all of this, albeit with some help and it takes the authorities a long time to figure out who stole the gold. They do capture Pierce, but he escapes during the trial and the gold is never recovered.\n\nFinal thoughts: A fun book that really blurs the lines between historical fiction and nonfiction (since the heist actually occurred). I loved all the slang he used , as well as the history of safecracking at the time (it was all about keys since there was no dynamite or tumbler locks). A bit different than many of his other books, but definitely enjoyable."
