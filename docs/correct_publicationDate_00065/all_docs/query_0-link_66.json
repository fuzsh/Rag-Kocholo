        "text": "I had read this book before and had been meaning to re-read it. When I saw it for sale on audible, I had to snag it! This was such a fun listen!\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\nMy Thoughts on The Great Train Robbery by Michael Crichton, narrated by Michael Kitchen\n\nI love that this book starts with a bit of a history lesson, explaining how important the railroad was as well as what the economy was like. From there, we set off into a very interesting storyline that bounces between history lessons, what lead up to the robbery, and what happened after the robbery\n\nThe narrator was lovely! Michael Kitchen has a great voice and he did a wonderful job with the recording.\n\nHowever I will say, I found this one very difficult to keep up with. I had much better luck with the print version, but this was still fun to listen to! I just found that I got a little confused overall trying to keep up with the transitions. There were so many parts of the story that I absolutely loved, but others I just wasn’t following so I kept losing focus.\n\nSo would I recommend this audio version? Yes! Though I would recommend it more to those that have already read the book or for those that enjoy reading the text while listening at the same time."
