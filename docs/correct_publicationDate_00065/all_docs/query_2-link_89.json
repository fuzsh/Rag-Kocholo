        "text": "The book, 'Great Train Robbery Confidential' is now available in High Street bookshops and online.\n\nThis is the feedback from those who read the draft-\n\n‘Several new, significant and interesting steps towards the truth.’ - Jackie Malton, former Met. DCI and true inspiration for 'Prime Suspect,’ writer and broadcaster.\n\n…the book really does shed new light on the Great Train Robbery, as well as to correct an injustice perpetuated against an innocent man. Even though this crime occurred over 50 years ago, it displays the motivation, greed and destructiveness of criminality which is just as relevant today as it was in the swinging sixties. This book is a compelling read! – Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate.\n\nGraham Satchwell’s ability as a senior detective of impeccable integrity has been put to excellent use in producing a book that offers new perspectives on the planning and execution of the Great Train Robbery, with out pulling any punches. – David Hatcher, former chief superintendent and face of TV’s ‘Crimewatch’ for over 10 years.\n\nI did truly extensive research for this book and had a great deal of important help from members of this forum and railway pensioners. It is the first book on the subject by a railway detective. If you think you know about the Great Train Robbery, then read this book, and be prepared to change your views on long held beliefs.\n\nDon't know about Morayshire, but over in Cromartyshire I certainly did enjoy it, albeit briefly.... delivered on Saturday afternoon, just finished! I had ordered it from Amazon when you mentioned it on another thread.\n\nWell recommended, well written, well edited, an easy read.\n\nI confess to especially appreciating the second paragraph of Mary Wisbey's introductory piece, describing BTP HQ in Tavistock Place, Bloomsbury. \"....nothing like a police station. It felt like an old hospital.\" I know why - it was an old dairy!\n\nGZ\n\nHi GZ, Very glad to hear you enjoyed the book. I guess you must have if you read it in a single day! Can I ask you please do an Amazon review for me? I'm sure it helps with marketing.\n\nI’ve just finished reading the book and, wow !\n\nTo be honest I’d always questioned how a train is stopped for so long on such a busy Mainline and no one aka the signallers realise or raise the alarm.\n\nIs it true Driver Mills swapped his turn that night so he was on the train ?\n\nCould the guard have also been in on the job?\n\nWas the Leighton Buzzard Signalman allow during the job, or was be accompanied by someone to make sure he played ball?\n\nIm sure even suggesting the driver was in the slightest bit involved will cause huge ruptions in the industry where he’s held as a hero.\n\nAll in all very interesting indeed."
