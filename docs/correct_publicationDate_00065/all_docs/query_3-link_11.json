        "text": "Michael Crichton, the creator of Jurassic Park, “ER,” Twister and Westworld, had a passion project he’d been pursuing for years, ahead of his untimely passing in 2008. Knowing how special it was, his wife, Sherri Crichton, held back his notes and the partial manuscript until she found the right author to complete it: James Patterson. A history-making eruption is about to destroy the Big Island of Hawaii. But a secret held for decades by the US military is far more terrifying than any volcano.\n\nDeep inside Fairchild Air Force Base, Project Eternal Vigilance has continued to watch and wait for the Andromeda Strain to reappear. On the verge of being shut down, the project has registered no activity --- until now. A Brazilian terrain-mapping drone has detected a bizarre anomaly of otherworldly matter in the middle of the jungle and, worse yet, the tell-tale chemical signature of the deadly microparticle. With this shocking discovery, the next-generation Project Wildfire is activated, and a diverse team of experts hailing from all over the world is dispatched to investigate the potentially apocalyptic threat. If they can’t reach the quarantine zone, enter the anomaly and figure out how to stop it, this new Andromeda Evolution will annihilate all life as we know it.\n\nDeep inside Fairchild Air Force Base, Project Eternal Vigilance has continued to watch and wait for the Andromeda Strain to reappear.

Into this treacherous territory plunges William Johnson, a student who has joined world-renowned paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh on his latest expedition. But when Marsh becomes convinced that William is spying for his nemesis, Edwin Drinker Cope, he abandons him in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a locus of crime and vice. William joins forces with Cope and soon stumbles upon a discovery of historic proportions. With this extraordinary treasure, however, comes exceptional danger, and Johnson’s newfound resilience will be sorely tested.\n\nIn 1876, two monomaniacal paleontologists pillage the Wild West, hunting for dinosaur fossils, while surveilling, deceiving and sabotaging each other in a rivalry that will come to be known as the Bone Wars. Into this treacherous territory plunges the arrogant and entitled William Johnson, a Yale student who has joined world-renowned paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh on his latest expedition.

The crew: three seasoned criminals with the skills to pull off the heist of the century. The edge: the scheme has been simulated in a computer, down to the last variable. The complication: three beautiful women with agendas of their own --- and the sort of variables no computer can fathom.\n\nAs an expert handler of venomous snakes --- and a smuggler of rare artifacts --- Charles Raynaud is accustomed to danger.

But when the attempts on the man's life nearly get Raynaud killed, he's left wondering: is he the killers' real target?\n\nOn a secret island in the Caribbean, bioengineers have devised a vacation resort like no other, promising the ultimate escape. But when Dr. Roger Clark investigates, he discovers the dark secret of Eden Island and of Advance Biosystems, the shadowy corporation underwriting it.\n\nPolitical radical John Wright is plotting an act of mass destruction --- and federal agent John Graves has him under surveillance. When a government computer is hacked and a high-security shipment of nerve gas gets hijacked, Graves puts the pieces together. But can he stop Wright from unleashing his weapon before it kills a million people, including the President of the United States?\n\nTo prevent an arms shipment from reaching the Middle East, a terrorist group has been carrying out targeted assassinations.

When a professor of archaeology finds clues to the location of a Pharaoh's lost tomb in ancient hieroglyphs, he hatches a plan to find the burial site --- and plunder it. But can a five-man team of smugglers and thieves uncover what the centuries have hidden? And even if they find it, can they escape with it...and with their lives?\n\nDiver James McGregor is used to exploring sunken ships. But there's something strange about the wreck of the Grave Descend. No one aboard tells quite the same story about what happened. Then there's the mysterious cargo they were carrying. A sinister plot is about to unfold, and if McGregor is not careful, he may find himself in over his head.\n\nMICRO follows a group of graduate students lured to Hawaii to work for a mysterious biotech company --- only to find themselves physically transformed and cast out into the rain forest, with nothing but their scientific expertise and wits to protect them."
