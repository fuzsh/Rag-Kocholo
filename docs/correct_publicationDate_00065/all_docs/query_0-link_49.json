        "text": "Both Price and Beatty have strong supporting details for their claim. Price supports his claim in “The Great Imagination Heist”. He shows us how after the invention of tv’s and other electronics people changed. He states,” When you asked a student of the fifties to write a story, he or she was likely to give you an account that involved personal feeling. . . ask the same of students now and you’re likely to get a story that amounts to an airless synopsis of a made-for-tv.’’ Price is talking about the great impact that tv’s had on people when they were invented. He supports his claim well in comparing people that didn’t grow up with tv’s with kids that did grow up tv’s.Beatty supports his claim in F451. He claims that what they do as firefighters\n\nThroughout history, a divide has always existed between the rich and poor in society. However, during the Industrial Revolution in Victorian England, this rift reached its peak. The working class labored for long hours and received miniscule wages, whereas the bourgeoisie grew abundantly wealthy through the labor of the working class. Published in 1848 and 1854 respectively, Karl Marx’s The Communist Manifesto and Charles Dickens’ Hard Times both comment on these troubles. While Hard Times is a novel which tells a story and The Communist Manifesto is a short publication which tries to bring about social change, both writings offer a sharp critique of the class antagonism brought about by capitalism at the height of the Industrial\n\nIn A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, written by Mark Twain, there exists a clear incongruence between nobility and the lower class. While knights and landlords live lavishly without a concern for acquiring basic necessities, peasants often struggle to feed themselves and their families. With so few individuals holding such a large portion of the wealth, a vast gap between the rich and the poor plagues society. For the most part, King Arthur remains completely oblivious to these issues that the lower class faces every day. He ineffectively governs, failing to consider the needs of all people. King Arthur’s interactions with the lower class and his inability to understand peasants’ lifestyles demonstrate the flaws of the monarchy system.\n\nSupposedly, both the individuals with ascribed statuses with hereditary wealth and the poor and homeless have equal chances to become successful although, Orestes Bronwnson in The Laboring Classes, pointed out that this is not true. “Do the young man inheriting ten thousand pounds and the one whose inheritance is merely the gutter, start even?” (219). As a result, the harsh separation of the rich and the poor, where capitalism thrives and,” the division of the community into two classes, one which owns the funds…the other provides the labor” (216). The inhumane apprehension of a capitalist society that keeps its workers “in a permanent system, [has] given preference to the slave system” (214) says a lot about the evils of capitalism corresponding with the false American Dream. An outcome of capitalism is the frustrating rivalry between the poor. “There’s more people! That’s what’s ruining the country. The competition is maddening”\n\nHave you ever wondered what life is like for people in specific social classes and all the baggage that comes with being wealthy? In the article “Amber Waves of Green”, author Jon Ronson has sit downs with hard working americans making a income of $200 a week all the way up to $625,000 a week. In another writing titled “The Mansion”, written by Michael Lewis, allows the reader to get insight on what life is like as a middle class individual taking on a higher style of living. Within the two articles the reader can point out that both Jon Ronson and Michael Lewis disagree on living styles, what wealth can do for you, and how it can affect the people around you.\n\nThe working class can relate to the theme of the short story “Contents of the Dead Man’s Pocket,” by Jack Finney. More often than not, people strive to get to the top of their profession, but at what cost? The majority of people spend countless hours of their life working to provide for themselves and their loved ones. The irony of working all these hours to provide for your loved ones is that you will not see them nearly as much as desired because of work. In my opinion, the above passage is important to the story because Tom is now inside lying on the floor as a new man who knows what is important in life.\n\nWhen Cardinal Richelieu was serving as a royal councilor he said that the poor who able to work should be employed on public works (Doc. 2). Essentially, he is saying that the poor that are able bodied should work in the community. The poor shouldn’t just be left sitting on the streets begging, they should be working to earn their nourishment, if they are permitted to do so. A town council in Rouen, France has very similar ideas to that of Richelieu. They say that beggars unwilling to work should be kicked out, but those who can’t find a job should be put to work in the city (Doc. 4). Furthermore, they are conveying the fact that the poor should be working in order to create a better thriving community. There are plenty of opportunities for work in the city, so those unwilling to work should be exiled. In a painting by Rembrandt van Rijn, it shows a family with all their belongings collecting money from a man in his house (Doc. 5). His painting is showing how poor should be given alms. He creates sympathy for the poor by having children and the family carrying all their belongings in the picture. The response shown by this painting is that you need to give help to the poor. These examples show that the responses towards the poor were to make them work or to assist\n\nIn Nickel and Dimed, Barbara talked on this topic. \"To be a member of the working poor is to be an anonymous donor, a nameless benefactor, to everyone else. As Gail, one of my restaurant co workers put it, 'you give and you give. '\" (Ehrenreich 221). When people have expendable income, they have the ability to relax while still enjoying great luxuries in life. These people can take more for themselves. As a member of the working poor you aren 't given that option. You can only work and give of yourself in return for survival, nothing extra or to be enjoyed. This is contrary to the American Dream, which advocates for rewards and enjoyment for one 's hard work. But this is an unattainable dream for those working low wage jobs. The low wages also take away the option of resting or taking time off because the people cannot make it without the money for that day. This amount of daily work with no breaks can be very taxing on a person as Ehrenreich considers. \"If you hump away at menial jobs 360-plus days a year, does some kind of repetitive injury of the spirit set in?\" (106). Barbera is reflecting on the mental effects of this much work and stress nonstop over the entire course of ones life. She feels like the stress will have a negative long term affect on someone and their spirits. This all is an effect of the low wages paid to these workers. This also leads to a lack of choice for\n\nMany people in today’s society find themselves guilty of believing the common misconception that money can buy happiness. They go to school to become a doctor, lawyer, or other high paying job, with money and social status as their only incentives. Many will find that they have fallen into a trap, when they start earning their large salary, but still are not happy. While there were many messages present throughout Studs Terkels Working: a graphic adaptation, the most important reoccurring message seemed to be that having pride and dignity as well as working at a job that fulfills one’s life passion or is simply enjoyable are more important qualities than earning a large salary and having a high rank on the social ladder. The interaction of\n\nDuring Queen Elizabeth’s rule, the poor were in a plight where they were both mistreated and in need of economic support which Elizabeth provided as well as corrected the mistreatment of the poor. In “Crime and Punishment in the Elizabethan Era” punishments were usually reserved for criminals who broke a law. The homeless and beggars, however, regardless of why they are homeless were abused. They were rounded up by constables who tried them before a court and they were whipped until they left town or they might have been placed in stocks to be publicly humiliated. This blatant abuse of the poor did not stay throughout the entirety of Elizabeth’s reign as in “Elizabethan Class System” a law was passed that legally distinguished the differences"
