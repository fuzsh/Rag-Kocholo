        "text": "Michael Crichton (born October 23, 1942, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died November 4, 2008, Los Angeles, California) was an American writer known for his thoroughly researched popular thrillers, which often deal with the potential ramifications of advancing technology. Many of his novels were made into successful movies, most notably Jurassic Park (1990; film 1993).\n\nCrichton, whose father was an executive and journalist for Advertising Age, showed an early aptitude for writing. His first published piece, a travel article, appeared in The New York Times when he was only 14. Accepted to Harvard University, Crichton initially studied English before switching to anthropology. He took the classes required for admission to medical school, graduated summa cum laude in 1964, and traveled to the University of Cambridge as a visiting lecturer in anthropology. In 1965 Crichton returned to the United States to attend Harvard Medical School, where he earned a medical degree in 1969.\n\nWhile still a medical student, Crichton began his career as a professional writer under the pseudonyms John Lange and Jeffrey Hudson. The books written during this time, while mainly efforts to help mitigate the cost of tuition, sold well. His mystery novel A Case of Need won the 1968 Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America. Crichton’s first best seller, The Andromeda Strain (1969; film 1971), published under his own name, deals with the aftermath of a biological weaponry research program gone wrong. From 1969 to 1970 Crichton served as a postdoctoral fellow at the Jonas Salk Institute for Biological Science. However, the success of his novels led him to pursue writing full-time.\n\nCrichton went on to publish The Terminal Man (1972; film 1974), which concerns electrode brain therapy gone wrong. He diverged from science fiction with The Great Train Robbery (1972; film 1979), a heist thriller set in Victorian England, and Eaters of the Dead (1976; film 1999), a historical narrative incorporating elements of the Beowulf myth. Congo (1980; film 1995) weaves factual accounts of primate communication with humans into a fictional adventure tale about an aggressive species of gorilla.\n\nIn 1990 Crichton published the massively successful science-fiction thriller Jurassic Park, which grimly envisions the human resurrection of the dinosaurs through genetic engineering. He wrote the screenplay for the 1993 film adaptation, which was a box-office hit, and for such other works as The Lost World (1995; film 1997), a sequel to Jurassic Park. In addition, he conceptualized and produced the highly successful TV series ER (1994–2009), a weekly hour-long drama about crises and relationships in a hospital emergency room. Crichton directed several films, including Coma (1978), for which he also wrote the screenplay, and Physical Evidence (1989).\n\nThough he was often criticized by the scientific community for being sensationalist, Crichton was known for the careful research that went into his work. He meticulously studied the science underlying the premise of Jurassic Park and went to Japanese-American conferences before writing the political thriller Rising Sun (1992; film 1993), an account, divisive at times, of Japanese-American relations. Crichton continued to postulate on the effects of scientific advancements in works of science fiction such as Prey (2002), about nanotechnology; Next (2005), in which he returned to the blurry ethical boundaries of genetic engineering; and the 2005 thriller State of Fear, his polemical take on global warming.\n\nAfter Crichton’s death in 2008, two completed manuscripts were discovered: Pirate Latitudes, about 17th-century pirates, and Dragon Teeth, which centres on the rivalry between paleontologists in the American West in the 1800s; the novels were published in 2009 and 2017, respectively. Micro (2011), which imagines the sinister applications of miniaturization technology, derived from a partially finished manuscript that was expanded by science writer Richard Preston at the behest of Crichton’s family."
