Peter, Harry and Kitty foil a terrible robbery and catch the dangerous villains. Their methods are brave and unconventional, causing much damage and enjoyable mayhem.

At the end of the adventure the children are presented with a huge reward!\n\nThe books are written by Christopher Vine, a Chartered Engineer who loves railways and anything mechanical or electrical. They are his way of passing on his love and knowledge of engineering to todayâs youngsters\n\nAdd a personal dedication in the text box and author Chris will sign your book before posting.\n\n*Books are posted directly from the author so may not arrive at the same time as other purchases from this website"
