Lotus 18 Formula One. Interesting early history and owned by some big names more recently.

This Lotus is powered by its period correct 1.5 litre, Crosthwaite and Gardiner built, Coventry Climax FPF engine which is mated to the correct, C&G built, Lotus 5-speed sequential gearbox. The rest of the car is as restored by Cedric Selzer, Jim Clark's Team Lotus mechanic during the early 1960s. The Lotus has been maintained in excellent historic racing condition ever since. Spares include a beautiful new box of gears from C&G. The Lotus comes with current FIA, HTP papers issued in 2013.

The car has a chassis tag on the dash with the number 909 on it. It appears to be a replacement tag. However, the car does have a number stamped on a metal tag that is brazed to the frame on the lower front bulkhead, below the dash and between the driver's legs. This number, stamping, location, and method of attachment, are all correct for original frame numbers on the Lotus 18s. The number itself has been scarred over years of use, but may say "R2," or "H2," or "F2," or other. It is hard to discern at this time. Most recently the Lotus has been raced at premier historic racing events in the U.S., including multiple appearances at the Monterey Historic Automobile Races and at the SVRA National Championship at Circuit of the Americas, in Texas. It was originally owned by hill climb champion, Tony Marsh and later by Nick Mason (1988-2008).

Full ownership and competition records are available together with a few period photographs.
