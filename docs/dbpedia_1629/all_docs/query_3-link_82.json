        "text": "Although there are lots of grand prix model car manufacturers, you can narrow down the list to just a few based on price.\n\nThere are also a few simple rules in terms of cost when it comes to Formula 1 model cars – proper metal diecast vs plastic, handmade assembly, inclusion of a driver figure, accurate tobacco decals, engine detailing (usually with a removable engine cowling) and rarity all add to the retail price of a model. Models made of metal parts should usually be more expensive. An easy way to tell the difference between metal diecast and resin or plastic is by touch. Metal will feel cold when touching.\n\nF1 grand prix model cars come in 4 types – model kits (metal, resin or plastic), assembled cars (diecast metal, resin or plastic), radio control cars and building brick models.\n\nScale is an important consideration – collecting car models takes up lots of shelf or cabinet space, especially the 1:18 models. If you have limited furniture space, 1:43 scale is the way to go. There are pros and cons though between different scales. 1:18 scale models are more detailed and often have movable front wheels. The more expensive 1:18’s will have front wheels connected to the driver steering wheel. The trade-off is shelf space but for serious collectors popular 1:18 models will retain higher values than 1:43 models.\n\nModel Kits\n\nHobby modellers with plenty of time and the thrill of the challenge will probably collect or build from car kits. The Japanese hobby manufacturers dominate here. The most mainstream manufacturer is Tamiya who make a lot of plastic kit models from all eras in 1:20 and the larger 1:12 scale. Other plastic kit manufacturers are Fujimi (recent cars in 1:20 scale), Hasegawa (1:20 and 1:24 scale Ferrari’s), Revell (1:24 scale cars from Schumacher era Ferrari’s, Williams BMW, etc.) and Aoshima (have a 1:64 WilliamsF1 12 car collection set). In 2020, Ebbro have released 1:12 scale kit for 1968 Matra MS11 (with photo-etched parts) and also have a number of classic JPS Lotus and Brabham F1 cars in 1:20 kits.\n\nFor diecast metal kits, you can find excellent kits from Tameo, S.R.C., Studio 27, Hiro and Kyosho – these are usually in 1:43 scale and will require intermediate to high modelling experience. One advantage of metal kits is the huge back catalog of cars to choose from compared to the limited releases of the more popular pre-assembled or boxed cars. There are plenty of good websites and blogs for F1 diecast modellers if that is your interest.\n\nItaleri (Italian plastic kit manufacturer) has some interesting 1:12 scale kits for a number of early GP cars including the Fiat 806, Alfa Romeo 8C, the Renault turbo RE20 and Alfa Romeo 179 – all with removable engine cowling and detailed engine wiring. Official site: www.italeri.com\n\nDeAgostini is also worth mentioning as they are more unusual in that they offer collectors the ability to build diecast models via a weekly subscription magazine. DeAgostini are more slanted to the model builder rather than collector and their models are manufactured by Japanese model company, Kyosho. In the F1 space, DeAgostini offer massive 1:8 scale kits for the Senna McLaren MP4/4 (see past post here), radio controlled Vettel Red Bull RB7 and the McLaren MP4/23. These 1:8 scales are not cheap though. Official Site: www.model-space.com\n\nNote: The skill in building a metal diecast model is several levels higher than assembling the plastic moulded Tamiya type model – you’ll also need more special equipment, a lot more working space (including airbrushing space) and a lot more patience!\n\nAssembled/boxed model cars\n\nThe vast majority of collectors will prefer to buy assembled models. You can of course buy hand built metal diecasts such as BBR and Tameo models but because they are individually hand built these usually carry an expensive price tag. New collectors will probably ask the obvious questions of the differences between CMC vs Exoto or Minichamps vs Spark vs Hot Wheels models – I will try to give a some brief observations below.\n\nThe major brands in this category are:\n\nAmalgam Collection – Upmarket hand built productions in 1:8 scale and 1:5 scale. I’ve only seen a few large Amalgam models up close – some Ferrari F1 models and the BMW Sauber 2008 car which were all absolutely stunning. They are priced for the wealthy collector and out of reach of the average collector but Amalgam also produce small scale F1 (1:12) nose cones and (1:4 scale) miniature F1 steering wheels in the sub-USD200 price range which is more accessible for the average collector. The full scale steering wheels start at $5000 and the 1:8 and 1:5 cars start from £3000+. Amalgam have in more recent years produced smaller (i.e. more affordable) 1:18 scale Senna, McLaren MP/4, Hamilton Mercedes W10 and Vettel/Raikonnen/LeClerc SF Ferrari cars. The Amalgam site is well worth a look, particularly for the premium models. Official site: www.amalgamcollection.com\n\nAtlas Editions – Atlas Editions F1 collectibles was a 1:43 scale series of 31 cars in 90’s. The build quality was basic and you can still see these being re-sold on ebay. Atlas Editions UK is part of the DeAgostini Group subscription magazine group but have stopped distribution. Historic site: www.atlaseditions.co.uk\n\nAutoart – This Hong Kong manufacturer is most well known for their excellent 1:18 scale luxury sportscar and GT car diecasts but in recent times they have also made the Alonso and Button McLaren MP4-30 cars in 1:18, the classic Honda RA272 in 1:18 (go for the model w/ the Richie Ginther driver figure), classic Porsche 804 and the Senna McLaren MP4/6 and Senna Lotus 99T (both models with removable cowling and engine detailing). Autoart have also produced the fantasy F1 concept car Red Bull X2010 in 1:18 scale. Official site: www.autoartmodels.com\n\nBiante – This Australian company produces a lot of touring car diecasts but they did commission 1:43 diecasts of the Cooper T51 and T53 cars driven by Sir Jack Brabham and Sir Stirling Moss in ’59 and ’60. These diecasts have removable engine cowlings. Official site: www.biante.com.au\n\nBBR – Italian model company, BBR makes hand built diecast models for the serious collector. Diecast collectors particularly fawn over BBR’s Ferrari 1:43’s. The recent 1:18 Ferrari BBRs (e.g. SF-16H) feature movable DRS flap on the rear wing. Official Site: bbrmodels.it\n\nBburago – owned by Hong Kong manufacturer May Cheong. Bburago was originally a well known Italian diecast car manufacturer in the 1970s and aside from roadcars made a limited number of 1970’s 1:14 scale F1 cars including the iconic Ferrari 312T2, 312T5, Brabham BT46, Tyrrell P34/2 and Lotus 79. In the late 90’s their older F1 models were generally in 1:24 scale and had no driver figure. I’ve only ever owned Bbruragos of the early Schumacher Ferraris and felt the build quality was reasonable given the price back then. Even though the chassis was mainly a combination of rubber plastic, it was a solid model, didn’t look too toyish and the wheels could turn. Around 2010 Bburago started producing Red Bull’s and McLaren’s in 1:32 scale – they weren’t exactly works of art but neither was the price. In recent years, Bburago are producing diecast Ferrari toy car again after the end of Mattel’s Hotwheels licence. With a Ferrari license under their belt, their newer Ferrari F1 models since the Vettel & Raikkonnen era are very similar to the old Mattel Hotwheels build quality. The latest Vettel and Lelerc Ferraris in 1:43 and 1:18 are surprisingly good. The 1:43’s come in a cheaper series without a driver figure while their Signature 1:43 series comes with a driver figure – the build quality with a driver figure for this price point is worth a look if you’re starting out as a collector. Official Site: www.bburago.com\n\nBrumm – this Italian manufacturer also makes road and GT car models but is known for its Ferrari grand prix cars in 1:43 scale. Their early models had no driver figures but their recent model productions are worthy of a serious look. Their newer collections have a driver included and some even have background dioramas, Ferrari fans can pickup Brumm 1:43 specific cars with driver figurines that are not covered particularly well by Minichamps or HotWheels such as most of the Gilles Villeneuve’s Ferrari race cars (reviewed here), Michele Alboretto 126C4 (reviewed here), Clay Regazzoni 312B, Von Trips 156, Jacky Ickx 312, Jim Clark Lotus 25 . Brumm also have an Auto Union collection in 1:43, the only driver model I’ve seen in the 1938 Nuvolari Auto Union Tipo D. Brumm models have more visible plastic parts and are more affordable than Minichamps, but their detailing is still quite good. Official Site: www.brumm.it\n\nCMC – relatively expensive (USD300+) but highly detailed 1:18 metal diecasts comparable with Exoto models. CMC are popular for their Silver Arrows, Maserati 250F and Ferrari 156 Sharknose (reviewed previously here) reproductions. CMC models are without driver figures, and you will have to search around for specialized driver figures if you want the complete look. CMC also produce a few 1:18 scale engine replicas including the Auto Union Type C. Official Site: www.cmc-modelcars.de\n\nCMR – not to be confused with CMC is Classic Model Replicars. I’ve not seen CMR models in the flesh yet but they produce a small number of 1:18 historic F1 cars also made by CMC and Exoto such as the Maserati 250F, Ferrari 156 and Ferrari Dino 246. The CMR 1:18 look like they have more plastic parts (e.g. suspension, exhausts), have movable front steering but no other moving chassis parts. Still, the chassis and cockpit detailing looks decent and are priced at a much lower price point than the counterpart CMC and Exoto models. Official site: www.classicmodelreplicars.com (warning: their website just seems to be a parked page at the moment).\n\nCorgi – Corgi produced a variety of small scale diecasts that are still being re-sold on ebay. Notable models are the early Corgi Toys Vanwall (#150), BRM (#152) and Ferrari 156 (#154) which are worth considerably more with their original boxing. In the early 1970’s, Corgi produced a series of 1:36 scale diecasts with driver figure and some half decent engine detailing – these models included the Surtees TS9, Lotus 72, Ferrari 312B2, Hesketh 308, Tyrrell 006. Corgi also released 1:18 diecasts of the McLaren M23 (#191) and JPS Lotus 72.\n\nDinky Toys – Dinky Toys have a long history of diecasts that dates back to their Meccano ownership days but have changed owners a number of times since. Vintage Dinky Toys diecasts though (like Matchbox cars) are prized by vintage memorabilia collectors in their original packaging more so than pure F1 fan collectors. Dinky produced a range of early grand prix cars in 1:43 scale like Talbot Largo, Maserati, Cooper, HWM Alta, Vanwall and 70s cars like the Hesketh 308, Ferrari 312B2, Lotus 49 and Matra. Dinky models do include a driver figure which make their retro cars quite appealing.\n\nEbbro – have a small collection series of diecast and resin 1:43 and 1:20 scale of the classic Honda F1 RA272, RA273, RA300, RA301 and RA302 cars from the 60s. Official Site: www.ebbro.com\n\nEidolon Formula – MakeUp Co Ltd is a Japanese manufacturer that produces an ‘Ediolon Formula’ range of 1:43 scale resin McLaren Hondas – the famous MP4/4, MP4/5B, MP4/6, MP4/7A and MP4/8. Official Site: www.makeupcoltd.co.jp\n\nExoto – generally considered to be the best diecast 1:18 models in the USD300+ range. The more expensive Exotos are the out of production cars with driver figures – Ferraris (e.g. Lauda/Regazzoni 312T2, Scheckter/Villeneuve 312T4, Mansell/Prost 641), some of the Lotus cars (Clark Lotus 49, Fittipaldi Lotus 72) and the Tyrrells (Scheckter P34). Exotos have highly detailed engine parts and their driver figures are very accurate (right down to Alain Prost’s nose!). Since most models are out of production, Exotos also have very good re-sale value and the models, like the Williams FW14B (past review here) without driver figures are still sought by collectors. If an average collector wanted to indulge in one expensive model purchase, an Exoto would be a good choice. If you have a choice, stick to the Exotos with a driver figure (note: the faces and helmets are very accurate) – although they cost more, they look better and will retain better value. The more expensive and recent Exoto XS series collection includes the Hill Ferrari Tipo 246, Sharknose 156 and the Alfetta 159 with much more detail and moving parts than the standard Exoto models. Official Site: www.exoto.com\n\nGP Replicas – based in Macau, GP Replicas have now produced lots of resin Ferrari GP cars in 1:18 scale (312T2, 312T5, 312B3, 641/2), Lotus (72 & 79) and McLaren MP4/2. In 1:12 scale, Ferrari 312T, 126C2 and McLaren MP4/5. The 1:12 scales are not cheap for resin models but the 1:18 seem to be priced ok relative to Spark 1:18 prices. I’ve yet to spy a GP Replicas in up close in the flesh but the photos I’ve seen of the chassis detailing on MP4/5 look impressive. Will get around to it to post a review soon.\n\nFujimi Collection – Fuji Collection only have a few assembled 1:43 resin models (Scheckter signed 312T4 limited edtion, Alesi 312T2) although Fujimi are more well known for their 1/20 plastic model kits of past classic 80’s/90s race cars (Ferrari 126CK, 126C2, 641/2, F92A, 248 , F2007, McLaren Hondas and Williams FW14B, FW16), Senna cars (1981 kart, 1993 kart, Lotus 97T, Williams FW16) and recent season cars (Ferrari F2012, McLaren MP4/27 and Sauber C31). I haven’t managed to see the Fuji Collection 1:43 resins up close yet. Official Site: www.fujimimodel.com\n\nHot Wheels – Hot Wheels came to prominence when Mattel secured the exclusive licensing for Ferrari diecasts in the early 2000s. Hot Wheels models come in 1:43, 1:24 and 1:18. Aside from Ferrari, Hot Wheels also had licenses for the early 2000s Jordan, McLaren, Williams and Jaguar cars. The early Hot Wheels cars were poor in detailing compared to their Minichamps counterparts but slowly improved. The most obvious early deficiencies were in the livery colors and detailing, although they are cheaper than Minichamps cars of the same scale. Hot Wheels also have an Elite edition which is a higher build, mostly focused on Ferrari GP cars however these models have no driver figure. See past review of HotWheels Alonso 1:18 and Hotwheels Elite Lauda 1:43. Hotwheels’ licensing deal with Ferrari ended in 2014 and Bburago and Looksmart are now official licensed 1:43 and 1:18 Ferrari F1 diecast manufacturers. Official Site: www.hotwheels-elite.com\n\nIXO – IXO are better known for their La Storia Ferrari collection of 1:43 F1 cars. The La Storia models come in large red metallic book container boxes, so they do take up a lot of shelf space. There are 2 main La Storia series collection, the Ferrari Collection series (reviewed here) in the black clamshell plinth which has cars with driver figures (10,000 unit production run and 57 different models) and the other La Storia cars are driverless. To make things a little more complicated, Mattel in the early 2000’s took over production of the La Storia models. Official Site: www.ixomodels.com\n\nKyosho – This Japanese company is now more focused on radio controlled cars but they still have a diecast arm that is more directed at sedan cars. Kyosho used to produce 1:64 scale DIY models for Ferrari Formula 1 collection, Classic Team Lotus, McLaren Hondas, Benneton Suzuka Legends. You can still see these for sale on ebay. You can still get Super Aguri’s in 1:64 too. Official site: https://dc.kyosho.com/en/\n\nLooksmart – Like BBR, Looksmart is an Italian manufacturer of expensive hand made resin diecasts. More known for its exoticar 1:43 diecasts, Looksmart have Ferrari licence rights to the recent SF15T and a back catalog of many Ferrari historical F1 cars including the 156, 158, 312B3, 126 C4 and F1 89 and historical Alfa Romeo race cars including the 179 and the 184T. Although starting out in 1:43 scales, Looksmart now have 1:18 rights. Build quality looks comparable to Spark (not sure if they share parts!) although their pricing now seemed to be pitched at BBR price range. One feature of Looksmart models is that they come with a display case, so you should factor that into pricing. Official Site: www.looksmartmodels.com\n\nMinichamps – Minichamps of Germany are probably the most popular brand for collectors. Also earlier marketed under their original Paul’s Model Art name, they regularly produce the latest season cars and the build quality of 1:43 and 1:18 models are high. These are the two most popular scale sizes, although Minichamps also have larger 1:8 and 1:12 models under their Paul’s Model Art branding. They have also produced small scale 1:64 collections and the ocassional 1:24 scale diecasts. The size of the 1:43 models make them ideal to stack on book shelves. Minichamps are probably the most tradeable collector models on classified sites like ebay. Many of their earlier limited production runs (e.g. World Champions cars) now command high re-sale prices. Its worth noting that there are 2 generations of Minichamps 1:43 models and the best indicator is to look at the driver detailing. Many early Minichamps models used a very simple block driver figurine with no detailing or decals. Minichamps’ later generation models used a better figurine with proper hands, legs and race suit detailing. Interestingly, Minichamps have now also changed their box and plinth sizes to the same size as Spark. They are also now releasing an Evolution series for GP winning cars during the season – these will be resin models and from the images I can find online, these look suspiciously like re-packaged Spark models. Official Site: www.minichamps.de\n\nModel Car Group (MCG) – MCG are a more recent name that offer 1:18 diecasts of some iconic 70’s & 80’s F1 cars like the Tyrrell 006, Lotus 79 and McLaren MP4/2B. MCG are interesting as their build quality looks decent and their cars include driver figurines at a very attractive price point compared to the equivalent 1:18 models by Minichamps, Exoto and GP Replicas. Although the German Speiel Modellauto are named on the box as distributors, I believe they may be the MCG manufacturer and the diecasts made in China – that said, MCG models are metal diecasts that appear to look good.\n\nNorev – Norev is a French model car producer. I haven’t personally seen any of their models but in the F1 category, they have released 1:43 and 1:18 scale Renault R28, R29 and R30 race cars. Their cars have no driver figures. Official Site: www.norev.com\n\nOnyx – Onyx of Portgual produced a lot of models in 1980s & 1990s and have a lower build quality than Quartzo and Minichamps. You will see 2 types of Onyx series models – one series in the square plinth boxes similar to Quartzo (usually post 1994 cars) and the other in the more conventional rectangular boxes with a sloping base (usually the early 1990s cars McLaren and Ferrari). The early 1990s Onyx cars were slightly toyish but later series Onyx models with the square boxes were a bigger improvement. Onyx models are sometimes a good compromise if you want to pickup a cheaper version model of a rare car or world championship car that is a lot more expensive than the Minichamps version. I believe Onyx stopped diecast production around 1997 due to licensing reasons.\n\nPanini/Centauria – Panini (under the Italian Centauria publishing group) has produced a series of Formula 1 1:43 scale collectable cars (most of them being world championship cars) that were sold with an accompanying subscription magazine. These were marketed under the Formula 1 Collection magazine series in Europe, UK, Japan, Australia, South Africa and South America under slightly different names but are all recognisable by their 1:43 models on a slanting track diorama and a 22 page magazine with each car (past review here). Due to their relatively low price, these models have become popular with collectors as their build quality is good and they provide a cheaper way to access the rarer cars produced by Minichamps. The original Panini collection included the 1970s-2014 world championship cars but the collections now include 200 cars. The Panini models are proper metal diecasts but without a driver figure but have an active support base for after market tobacco decals. I believe Panini/Centauria models are made by IXO as are the similar subscription based Altaya models. You may see on ebay an Eaglemoss Brazilian collection which includes Fittipaldi, Senna (past review here) and Piquet 1:43 cars under the Altaya name – these include a driver figure and are on a sloped plinth. These are models are on par with their Minichamps counterparts.\n\nPolitoys/Polistil – Politoys was an Italian model manufacturer that produced several plastic F1 cars in differing scale of a similar quality to Corgi models. In the 1970’s Politoys produced their FK series 1:32 scale team cars including Lotus, Ferrari, Honda, McLaren, March and Tyrrell. The brand name later changed to Polistil which are probably more known for their slotcars but they have produced the flat V12 Ferrari’s (312B2, 312B3, 312T2, etc) in larger scales (1:16, 1:18).\n\nQuartzo – I’m not sure if Quartzo still manufacture models. Quarzto were part of Vitesse which is now owned by SunStar Models. Quartzo are famous for their 1:43 models of the 1960s and 1970s GP cars although they also made 1:18 cars. Quartzo build quality is not as detailed as Minichamps, the obvious difference is in the driver helmet figurines (especially the visor) which are very toy-like. See my comparison review here. Quartzo box sizes are also tall square boxes which take up more shelf space. Quartzo models are good if you are interested in Matras, Coopers, Brabham, March, Tyrrell, Lotus and Honda cars of that era. I previously owned a 1:18 scale Lotus 49 and while the chassis was metal, overall it was more plastic than metal (especially the engine parts), however the model itself did compare reasonably well to the much more expensive Exoto version. Official Site: www.vitessemodels.com\n\nRBA Collectibles – RBA models were sold as part of a publication series in UK, Spain and Italy (I think). These 1:43 models were manufactured in China and you can find plenty of these listed for re-sale online. Build quality is more at the budget end similar to Onyx.\n\nRedline – Redline models produced only Ferrari cars and are a sister company to Spark. I have seen the Niki Lauda 312B3 (reviewed here) which is excellent but not all Redline’s contain driver figures. The ones I am aware of are the Lauda/Regazzoni 312B3, Surtees/Bandini 158 (the open driver helmet figures look slightly toyish) and the Massa/Räikkönen F2008. Redline model prices tend to start from USD100 upwards (but if you can find a Räikkönen F2008 sharkfin with driver figure, expect a much higher price tag, as these are super rare…). Note: Spark/Redline no longer make Ferrari models due to licensing reasons, so any Redline model you see in store or online are now out of production. Official Site: www.redline-models.com\n\nSolido – Solido were a French manufacturer but changed owners several times and are now part of the German Simba Dickie Group. Solido is known for their 1:18 Alain Prost collection diecasts – Renault and McLarens. These diecasts had no driver figure but had removable chassis covers with engine detail. I haven’t owned any Solido models but you will still find these on ebay. In recent times, they have produced a 1:18 model of Daniel Ricciardo’s RS19 2019 Australian GP car. Official Site:www.solido.com\n\nSchuco – I haven’t seen a Schuco F1 diecast up close. This German manufacturer (also a part of the Simba Dickie Group) is more well known for their Piccolo style models. Schuco will be releasing the previous Biante commissioned Jack Brabham Cooper T51 in 1:18. Official Site: www.schuco.de\n\nSMTS – Scale Model Technical Services (SMTS) have produced white metal 1:43 kits of 60’s era Ferrari, Brabham, Lotus, Honda and Cooper grand prix cars (you can still see these kits on ebay) but they also sell fully handbuilt models. Official site: www.smtsmodels.com\n\nSpark – Spark produce excellent 1:43 scale cars. These are resin models rather than metal diecast. Spark models are slightly more expensive than the same Minichamp models and have traditionally been focused on 1960s and 1970s F1 cars. They are well known for their Lotus, Tyrrell and BRM model cars, although I have noticed that Spark have been releasing the latest cars – HRT, Caterham, Sauber and even McLaren. I would rate Spark build quality higher than older Minichamps models – Spark models have more detailed brake ducts and the driver helmet has a plastic visor with some facial features underneath (old comparison post here). Although on some recent Spark 70s models, the helmet shape/visor looks a little more open faced than it should which might irritate some collectors. In the last few years, Spark have also released 1:18 scale resins of the current grid car including Alfa Romeo, Red Bull, Mercedes AMG and also classic Renault (RS01), Matra, Williams (FW07B, FW11B) and Brabham cars (BT19, BT24, BT49C). Official Site: www.sparkmodel.com\n\nSunstar – Another diecast manufacturer based in Macau, Sunstar are known for their classic and historic roadcar models but do make 1:18 scale diecast versions of Lotus Ford 72C, 72D and 72E with driver figurines (Fittpaldi and Peterson). Sunstar are also manufacture 1:43 scale F1 under the Vitesse brand.

This series included 1992 grid cars: Alesi Ferrari 643, Mansell Williams Renault FW14B, Schumacher Benetton Ford B193B, Hakkinen Lotus 102B, Herbert Lotus 107B and Senna McLaren MP4/6. I’m also aware that Tamiya have added Williams FW24 and Honda RA272 to the Collector’s Club range (although these models are without driver figures).\n\nTarmac Works – Hong Kong based group that focusses on sportscar 1:64 diecasts but has partnered with IXO to release the McLaren MCL35M in 1:64 scale including the fantastic 2021 Monaco GP model. Tarmac Works have plans to release the Mercedes W12 and W13 also in 1:64 scale. Official Site: www.tarmacworks.com\n\nTecnomodel – Italian manufacturer that has made 1:18 scale models of the Alfa Romeo 159M, Ferrari 125, 246, 275, 553, 801, 312, 312B2, 312B3, 126, Honda RA273, McLaren M19A and Lotus 16 and 18. Tecnomodels are resin models and the 1:18 are in small limited production batches of around 90-100. In their Mythos Collection they have produced many of the early Ferrari GP cars including the 312B3 test mule car. As resin models though, their pricing is up near the CMC metal diecast price range for similar classic pre-1960’s GP car models. The cars are without driver figures except for the Lotus 18 1961 Monaco GP which includes the Stirling Moss figure with exposed chassis.

They haven’t produced F1 diecasts for some time but have in past production runs produced 1:58 scale models of early F1 cars like Honda RA272, Lotus 78, Ferrari 312T2, Lotus Honda, Ferrari 641, McLaren Honda and Williams FW11. Tomica F1 cars are toyish in design and you can see a number of old collector items on ebay (some at astronomic list prices but are not seriously worth these amounts).\n\nTron Models – Tron Models are an Italian company producing 1:43 metal diecast and resin kits of Italian marque grand prix teams including Ferrari (Ferrari cars are sold under the Star Tron label), Alfa Romeo and Maserati. While they sell white metal kits similar to Tameo, Tron also sell built 1:43 models. Official Site: www.tronmodels.com\n\nTruescale (TSM) – Truescale Models is another Hong Kong manufacturer. I have only seen a few Truescale 1:43 scale models and have a Peterson Tyrrell P34 on my shelf (reviewed here). Truescale prices are a little higher than Minichamps (although the gap is closing due to increase in new Minichamps pricing) but the TSM build quality, driver and additional engine detailing is superior. The ratio of metal vs plastic parts is much higher in a Truescale model. TrueScale have announced they are going to producing more Lotus, McLaren Honda and Brabham 1:43 models and these will probably be much better than the Minichamps versions. Official Site: www.tsm-models.com\n\nVitesse – Vitesse have a limited range of 1:43 scale Lotus 49, 49B and March 701 cars with driver figurines – build quality is very similar to Quartzo. If you’re looking for Lotus 49 or March 701 in 1:43 scale, the only current choices are from Vitesse or Altaya. Vitesse is a sub-brand of Sunstar. Official Site: https://www.sunstarmodelcars.com/product-category/vitesse-143/racing/lotus-racing/\n\nWestern Models – Western Models or “WM” was based in the UK in late 1990s and produced handmade metal diecasts including GP cars (driverless) in 1:43. I’m aware they made a number of late 70s F1 cars – Brabhams (BT46, BT52), Ferrari 312T4, Williams (FW06, FW07, FW07B), Tyrrell 008 which you can still see traded on eBay. They did make the high airbox Tyrrell P34 1:43 which I haven’t seen produced by other model companies but Western Models is also known for its Alfa Romeo 158 in 1:24 scale.\n\nI’ve posted some comparison reviews between different manufacturers on the site. I would rank the order of quality and cost like this (starting with lower quality to higher quality):\n\n1. Onyx/RBA/Bburago\n\n2. Quartzo & Brumm\n\n3. Kyosho, IXO & Hotwheels\n\n4. Minichamps & Spark\n\n5. TrueScale (TSM), BBR, Redline, Looksmart\n\n6. CMC\n\n7. Exoto\n\n8. Amalgam Collection\n\nRemote controlled models\n\nI don’t have too much experience with radio control F1 cars, but I have seen the Tamiya Ferrari, Williams and McLaren RC cars in 1:10 scale in the hobby shops. The Japanese RC maker, Kyosho is another well known manufacturer with lots of F1 RC car models.\n\nI’ve been toying with the idea of getting an RC model but just don’t have the time but I would be happy to hear from anyone who can offer other readers guidance on RC models.\n\nSlot car models\n\nThere are also slot car models for Scalextrix sets – Carrera and Fly produce some good looking 1:43 scale grand prix slot cars. The more recent Scalextrix F1 1:43 models I have seen, like the Jim Clark Kyalami GP Lotus 49, looked seriously good, and could easily just be bought as a display model like a Minichamps or a Spark.\n\nThere are also vintage slot car manufacturers like Tokyo Plamo that produced 1:24 and 1:32 scale kits in the 1960’s for assembly including the Maserati, Ferrari 158 & 312, Honda RA271 and BRM P261. The 1:32 cars were totally out of proportion and you will see these ocassionally listed on ebay but often asking for antique collector prices (in many cases, unreasonably high prices). Traditional toy slot car manufacturers like Aurora AFX and Tyco also produced F1 slot cars including Ferrari, Williams and Renault but again, these models are toyish in proportion.\n\nNew Scalextrix 1:43 models retail for slightly cheaper prices than new Minichamps or Spark models, so I might investigate this when I get the time.\n\nBuilding brick models\n\nWhen I first started writing this guide back in 2012, there were only very basic unlicensed building block F1 car sets mainly from Asian toy factories. Since then, the most famous building brick manufacturer Lego has released various scale versions of F1 licensed cars including the large scale 1:8 McLaren MCL35 under its Lego Technic sets. Lego are also soon to release the black liveried Mercedes W14 in 1:8 scale. These 1:8 scale Lego Technic sets are intended for adult builders with over 1000+ pieces, although they aren’t entirely chassis accurate in external look. Lego are also soon to release Ayrton Senna’s famous McLaren MP4/4 too.\n\nNot to be outdone, Chinese toy manufacturer Double Eagle via its CaDa Bricks division sells a stunning officially licensed 1:8 scale construction kit for the Alfa Romeo C42 featuring over 1800 pieces. The CaDa bricks model car looks much more accurate to its real life race car. Cada Bricks also sell a more basic 1:24 scale set (approx 27o pieces) for the C42 for junior builders.\n\nAlthough these brick block models aren’t diecast or metal models, they are still worth mentioning as F1 collectors can still get a lot of joy out of owning and building some iconic F1 cars.\n\nA friendly tip about diecast collecting…\n\nI started collecting Formula One diecast models almost 20 years ago, and for new collectors I offer the following tips:"
