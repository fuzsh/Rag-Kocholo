        "text": "Back in February 5th, 2012. Lotus F1 Team pulls back the curtain on their latest masterpiece: the E20. With a cutting-edge V8 Renault engine and its two drivers, Kimi Räikkönen and Romain Grosjean, this car was destined to conquer the 2012 World Championship.\n\nFast forward to today, you now have the chance to step into the driver’s seat of this exact same car at our F1 DRIVING EXPERIENCE! Want to find out all the secrets of this iconic machine? We’re here to reveal it all!\n\nHISTORY\n\nThroughout the 2012 Formula One season, Romain Grosjean and former F1 World Champion Kimi Räikkönen took turns behind the wheel of the Renault-powered Lotus E20. Räikkönen’s return to Formula One after after two years of absence raised high expectations for the E20’s ambitions: to once again become a top team in the championship in the coming years.\n\nWith no team clearly dominating, the 2012 season saw eight different drivers claim race victories. Räikkönen’s great performance earned him seven podium finishes, including a memorable win at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. His efforts culminated in a third-place finish in the Drivers’ Championship standings, with Lotus securing fourth place in the Constructors’ Championship.\n\nKimi Räikkönen’s win at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix (2012)\n\nENGINEERING INNOVATION\n\nThe Lotus E20 boasted an array of cutting-edge technologies and innovations. From its Renault RS27-2012 power unit to its crafted carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb composite monocoque chassis, every aspect of the E20 was designed for maximum performance and aerodynamic efficiency. Notably, the implementation of a new 60% scale wind tunnel at Enstone further enhanced the car’s development process, propelling it to the forefront of Formula 1 engineering.\n\nPOWER UNIT SPECIFICATIONS\n\nPower Unit: Renault RS27-2012\n\nCapacity: 2.4 litres\n\nArchitecture: 90° V8\n\nWeight: 95kg\n\nRPM: 18,000\n\nPower Output: 750bhp\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nWeight: 640kg, including driver, camera and ballast\n\nDimensions: 5.04m (L) x 1.8m (W) x 0.95m (H)\n\nChassis: Moulded carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb composite monocoque\n\nTransmission: Seven-speed semi-automatic titanium gearbox with reverse gear. “Quickshift” system in operation to maximise speed of gearshifts\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\n– In the 2012 Formula One Season, which consisted of 20 races, the Lotus E20 clinched one victory and secured ten podiums.\n\n– This season saw the 500th Grand Prix contested by team from Enstone, including those contested through its previous incarnations of Toleman, Benetton, Renault F1 Team, Lotus Renault GP and Lotus F1 Team.\n\n– The designation “E20” is derived from the fact that it is the 20th car to be crafted at the team’s factory in Enstone. The letter E is also the first letter of all Lotus road car models.\n\n– The Lotus E20 is the car with which Kimi Raikkonen famously said, “Leave me alone, I know what I am doing” during the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\n\n– The Lotus E20 made a notable appearance in the music video for ‘Dangerous’ by David Guetta featuring Sam Martin.\n\nToday, the spirit of the Lotus E20 lives on, offering fans the opportunity to immerse themselves in its legacy through our F1 DRIVING EXPERIENCE. Winfield Racing School is the only racing school in the world to provide individuals without prior racetrack driving experience the chance to drive a genuine modern Formula 1 car. Step into the driver’s seat and feel the thrill as you relive the glory days of this iconic car!\n\nBook now: https://winfieldracingschool.com/produit/f1-driving-experience/\n\nPhoto credits: ©WR12 / Thomas Fenêtre"
