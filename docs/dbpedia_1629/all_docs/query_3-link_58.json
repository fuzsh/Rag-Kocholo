        "text": "Red Bull won the 2022 and 2023 Constructor’s and Driver’s Championships.\n\nPrior to that, Mercedes had won the constructor's championship for the eight years (2014 - 2021) and the driver's title for seven of them.\n\nBefore Mercedes, Red Bull had held sway when they won four consecutive Constructor’s and Driver’s Championships.\n\nIn the 74 years of Formula 1, there have been no cars which have won all the races in one season but there have been cars which have been totally dominant over a season.\n\nIn traditional reverse order, here are the most successful Formula 1 cars of all time.\n\n6. Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta in 1950 (6 races out of 7: 85.71 %)\n\nThe 1950 season of Formula 1 saw complete domination by Alfa Romeo Alfetta. The 1479cc Roots type supercharger engine powered car won all but one of the races.\n\nDriven by the likes of Giuseppe Farina, Juan Manuel Fangio, Luigi Fagioli, Reg Parnell, Consalvo Sanesi and Piero Taruffi, Alfa Romeo dominated the season in all possible circumstances by scoring Poles in 6 races out of 7 which also included the 6 fastest laps by the Alfa Romeo team.\n\nThe season concluded with 3 wins apiece for Giuseppe Nino Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio.\n\nFarina won the Driver’s championship with 30 points while Fangio trailed by 2 points.\n\nThe Alfa Romeo team also achieved a superb 1-2 on four occasions.\n\nTo sum up the dominance of Alfetta, three drivers of Alfa Romeo topped the Driver’s championship at the end of the season.\n\n5. Ferrari 500 in 1952 (7 races out of 8: 87.50 %)\n\nThe 1952 season of F1 was diminished by the absence of Alfa Romeo (due to insufficient finances) whose drivers had won last two championships.\n\nBRM also withdrew so the authorities decided to run all the races to Formula 2 regulations to introduce more competition.\n\nIt made no difference.\n\nThe Ferrari team's 1984cc naturally aspirated 4-manual speed engine completely dominated the 8 race season.\n\nThe brilliant squad of Piero Taruffi, Alberto Ascari, Luigi Villoresi, Andre Simon and Giuseppe Farina won all but one of the races that season.\n\nAlberto Ascari won 6 consecutive races after missing the first race and failing to win the Indy 500.\n\nScuderia Ferrari and its drivers scored pole and fastest laps in all races except the Indy.\n\nThe Ferrari team's dominance was such that it secured 1-2 in 6 occasions which included 1-2-3-4 at Germany and 1-2-3 at the Netherlands.\n\nFour Ferrari drivers topped the Driver’s championship.\n\n4. Ferrari F2001/F2002 in 2002 (15 races out of 17: 88.24 %)\n\nThe 2002 season of F1 will long be remembered for Michael Schumacher’s dominance over the rest of the field.\n\nThe Ferrari team's V10 naturally aspirated 3000cc engine could generate power up to 900 hp @ 19000 RPM.\n\nThe 600kg beast mounted by Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello won 15 races out of a possible 17.\n\nMichael Schumacher also scored podiums in all the races of the season winning 11 times.\n\nThe Scuderia Ferrari squad of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello scored more points than all the other drivers combined.\n\nMichael Schumacher topped the standings with 144 points while Rubens scored 77, boasting 4 wins.\n\nAlthough some reliability issues saw Rubens’s Ferrari failing to start on 2 occasions, it did not stop Ferrari score nine 1-2s.\n\nFerrari could score only 10 pole positions during the season but Ferrari was in another league on race day.\n\nSchumacher won the season after 11 rounds and Ferrari won the mammoth 88.24 % of races and a total of 221 points.\n\n3. Mercedes F1 W07 Hybrid in 2016 (19 races out of 21: 90.48 %)\n\nThe previous two seasons had seen a complete domination by Mercedes after the introduction of the hybrid era in 2014. Out of possible 38, the silver arrows had won 32 races.\n\nThe last season before the regulation change turned out to be the most successful Mercedes’ campaign.\n\nThe 2016 campaign’s 1.6 litre, V6 turbo-charged hybrid Mercedes engine, capable of producing up to 1000 hp, combined with the supreme Mercedes’ chassis, swept the field aside.\n\nThe season, just like the previous two, saw the Mercedes team winning the Constructor’s championship by a big margin while the two drivers fought for Driver’s championship.\n\nThe Anglo-German squad of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg won 19 out of 21 races collecting a total of 765 Championship points.\n\nThe dominance of the F1 W07 was all-round as it collected 20 poles during the season and 10 fastest laps.\n\nEight 1-2s and a total of thirty three podium finishes highlight the sheer dominance of this beast. This car achieved a podium place in all races bar one during the year with Hamilton scoring 17 podiums followed by Nico on 16 occasions.\n\nNico Rosberg won the championship by 5 points when he scored second to Hamilton at the last race of the season.\n\n2. McLaren-Honda MP 4/4 in 1988 (15 races out of 16: 93.75 %)\n\nHonda’s RA168 E, 1.5 litres V6t engine dominated the season. It was unbelievably fast, reliable and suited for every track. The McLaren team placed this wonderful engine in a car that handled superbly.\n\nCombine this with two of the best drivers Formula 1 has ever seen in Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost and the car was nigh on unbeatable.\n\nThe 1494cc Honda powered car won 15 races out of 16. The Monza round of the season was unbelievably won by Ferrari when they were still mourning the death of Enzo Ferrari.\n\nThe MP 4/4 not only won 15 races but it also gained poles at 15 races. Ayrton Senna won 8 races whereas Alain Prost won the 7 races.\n\nA total of 10 1-2s saw McLaren clinch the constructor’s championship for only the second time whereas it was the third season in a row where the Honda engine had won the constructors’ championship.\n\nThe car finished on podium in all but one race in Monza and the team amassed a mammoth 199 points which was more than double the points of the second placed team.\n\nBefore I reach the best F1 car ever, here are a few honourable mentions:\n\nMercedes 2014/2015: won 16 races out of 19 (both years)\n\nFerrari 2004/(1953): won 15 races out of 18/(7 races out of 9)\n\nMercedes 2020: won 13 races out of 17\n\nMcLaren 1984: won 12 races out of 16\n\nWilliams 1996: won 12 races out of 16\n\nRed Bull 2013: won 13 races out of 19\n\n1. Red Bull-Honda RB19 2023 (21 races out of 22 95.5%)\n\nA wonderful combination of the genius of Red Bull's chief technical officer Adrian Newey and the phenomenal skills of driver Max Verstappen who won 19 of 21 races.\n\nMax was on a different level to his team mate Sergio Perez and managed to get the very best out of the RB19.\n\nMax scored twice as many points as Sergio in 2023.\n\nSergio was only 51 points ahead of Lewis Hamiltion over the season.\n\nThere were only six 1-2s over the season.\n\nIt shows you just how exceptional Max is.\n\nWithout Max would the RB19 have achieved the dizzy heights of 21 wins? Very unlikely.\n\nAdrian Newey's understanding of aerodynamics (his first F1 job was as an aerodynamicist for the Fittipaldi race team in 1980 following university graduation) is second to none.\n\nCombine this with a highly skilled and dedicated team beneath him enabled Red Bull to produce such a superb car.\n\nDon't forget the exceptional Honda engine that powered the RB19 to the 21 victories.\n\nWill this record ever be beaten?\n\nAs fans do we want to see such domination?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nOther articles you may be interested in:"
