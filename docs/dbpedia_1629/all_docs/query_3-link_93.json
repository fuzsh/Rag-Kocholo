        "text": "'Ian Wagstaff is one of our favourite authors, and he researches and writes his books superbly.' Auto Express.\n\nIan Wagstaff began compiling motor-racing reports in the early 1970s, having started work in the production department of Motor Sport magazine. He went on to become press officer at Silverstone towards the end of that decade and then an editor in the trade press working for Ken Gregory, who was formerly Stirling Moss’s manager and joint owner of the British Racing Partnership (BRP) racing team.\n\nHe has been a freelance journalist since 1986, writing for automotive trade and business publications as well as The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and Financial Times Automotive Division, and the motor racing press. In recent years he has contributed to, among others, the magazines Motor Sport, Autosport, Vintage Racecar, Racecar Engineering, Aeroplane and Performance Racing Industry, and the website dailysportscar.com.\n\nIan first won a Guild of Motoring Writers award, the Pierre Dreyfus Trophy, for compiling a report for the EIU. Since then he has twice received the Guild’s Montagu of Beaulieu Trophy, for his books The British at Le Mans and Tony Robinson: The biography of a race mechanic. The American Auto Racing Writers & Broadcasters Association made his The British at Indianapolis its ‘Book of the Year’ and he has twice been shortlisted for the British Sports Book awards. He was also the winner of the 2019 Motorworld Book Prize (Motorsport category) and the 2017 BDRHoF Sydney Allard Written Media Award.\n\nHe is the author of three Porter Press ‘Great Cars’ books, two of which were shortlisted for the RAC Motoring Book of the Year award. These are Porsche 917 (covering chassis ‘023’) and Maserati 250F (covering the lightweight ‘2528’) and Lotus 18 (Stirling Moss’s ‘912’), published in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively. He has also written six titles in the Haynes ‘Workshop Manual’ series about racing cars, covering Bentley 41⁄2-litre, Maserati 250F, Lotus 49, Porsche 917, Lotus 72 and McLaren M23.\n\nAs an antidote to motor racing, he plays the French horn, performing with amateur orchestras around Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire.\n\nHis blogs can be read on ianwagstaffblog.wordpress.com"
