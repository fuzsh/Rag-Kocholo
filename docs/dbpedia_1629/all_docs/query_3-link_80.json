        "text": "Hello\n\nI'm really enjoying the game and very, very happy with the work that Reiza is doing with AMS2, but I have a question. I would like to know what year/s of the Formula Cars corresponds in the real life. For example, I'm very confused with Formula Classic Gen1/2/3.\n\nI think that It would be useful for all players have a little description of the category where this information is given. Something like \"This cars are designed on the basis of the specifications of F1 cars in the early 1990s\"\n\nMore or less, yes. I've come to understand since I made the post that the Ultimate is indeed the 2019 spec, and the F Classic Gen1 is 1986, not 1987. Could also be inspired by other cars like the Lotus-Renault or Benetton-BMW, no idea.\n\nThe question of labelling the cars with their respective years has already been discussed in the beta thread and Renato was opposed to it, even labelling them like \"mid 80s\", \"early 90s\" etc. Getting too specific with the cars only brings issues with users, me included as I already moaned about mashing two seasons worth of regulations together in the F-Classic Gen2 . Worst case they stir the ire of the FIA. Reiza had trouble before with liveries in AMS1 that looked too similar to their real world counterparts.\n\nThe FV Gen1 are visually very similar to 1967 season Ferrari 312 and Lotus 49. Gen 2 lock like the winged versions of these cars.\n\nThe other cars I believe that are what you said here.\n\nAnyway... I wish Reiza give us some description on each car.\n\nGiven that, for licensing reasons, AMS2 includes generic versions of various historic Formula 1 machinery, I wouldn't hold my breath for comprehensive descriptions of these vehicles from Reiza. For my part, I would rather they spend their time on other matters. Suffice it to say they represent their respective formulas of the eras posted previously. One note, continue to take some of the brief technical specs in the UI (e.g, V6 vs V8) with a grain of salt, for some of these are inaccurate for the time being. The normally-aspirated Gen2 Formula cars list the 3rd model as a V6; however, all engines were either V8 or V10 or V12 in 1989/1990. I assume the three Gen2 cars will indicate one of each engine as the UI is updated, similar to the Gen3 cars. I sure don't detect any turbo lag when driving the Gen2 Model 3 car, although it looks identical to the turbo Gen1 Model 1 car. My guess is it could serve as a generic version of the 1989 Ferrari car (i.e., Mansell's lionizing first drive for the tifosi) before Ferrari added the air intake above the driver like everyone else, but if that's the case, it needs semi-oval sidepods and paddle shifting since it actually invented that feature. Or maybe it's a totally different vehicle....\n\nThat's weird, because last month I would have probably said the same, but since the last 2 updates the Gen2Mod3 car seem to have zero turbo lag (at least to me). The FIA mandated pop-off valve in 1988 that cut overall horsepower for turbos did not entirely remove that idiosyncrasy from turbos of the era. Hopefully, that generic '88 turbo will get its mojo back in future updates.\n\nThat will be included in the game. Reiza already provided a preview of it. Everyone agrees it will be useful.\n\nFormula Reiza is the 2010 Red Bull, the nose has shoulders, the car has a double diffuser and the exhaust is pointed at the floor.\n\nBy 2012 noses had maximum heights (the broken nose F1s), no double diffusers and exhausts had to be moved upwards (which led to those \"bridges\" leading the gases to the diffuser).\n\nI don't why i know this stuff... i need more things to do lol.\n\nThanks to all in previous posts in providing additional clarification. Obviously, all our driving impressions are within the Early Access framework, but the current iteration of the AMS2 Gen2 Model 3 '88 F1 turbo's lag/boost comes on much, much differently (as in almost imperceptively) compared with AMS1's generic F-Classic MP4/4 ('88 spec by HP listed in user guide). I agree there should be a notable difference in white-knuckle wheelspin (just ask Nigel Mansell) between the Gen1 (86/87) turbos and Gen2 (88) turbo due to the latter's 2.5 bar pop-off valve, but the AMS2 '88 turbo seems too docile relative to the AMS1 F-Classic.\n\nI wonder if the 67 V8 is intended to be like the L49 or a more generic representation of a V8 F1 car from that year. I think I might even prefer the latter as AFAIK the L49 was quite dominant? I tested the Gen1 V8 and V12 back to back at Kyalami and think the V12 might be about half a second faster there but forgot exactly what my time was in the V8, it was either 0.1 or 0.5 slower I think. I hope at some tracks the V8 will have the edge. The V8 seems to need high revs a lot more than I was expecting, it only really comes alive above 7K IIRC.\n\nI don't think the V8 will match the V12 anywhere. The V8 is, or should be, modelled on the Lotus 49. The V12 probably on the Weslake or the Ferrari. The reason the Cosworth won 155 Grands Prix was because it had torque across the rev band, the Lotus 49 has been described as the 'pocket rocket', where the Ferrari had it in the middle and the Weslake had it at the top. The V8 in AMS 1 or 2 is 'hobbled' compared to the V-12."
