        "text": "By C. Gonzalez\n\nPer the blog last week, the ’60s was an era where ingenuity and creativity were prevalent, the team resources were extremely limited and far different from the Multi-million budgets handled by the teams of today.\n\nThe teams needed to be resourceful and rework/reuse several components to have a running car for the race on Sunday. If they had a transmission failure, for example, a mechanic would drain the oil from the transmission, store the oil on a bucket, fix the transmission, and then reuse the oil from the bucket.\n\nCan you imagine doing this on Sebastian Vettel’s Ferrari or Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes Benz?\n\nThe 1970s was an era of change where some of the most radical cars were developed. One key factor was engine reliability, which was achieved at the end of the 60’s when the FIA changed the rules and increased the displacement from 1.5 to 3 Liters in 1966 to normally aspirated engines, due to sports cars like the Ferrari 330 P3 or the Ford GT40 were faster than F1 cars.\n\nBased on that a car manufacturer developed what is arguably one of the best, if not the best, Formula 1 engine ever created: The Ford Cosworth DFV. This engine was so revolutionary that it was used practically unchanged for many years on F1 and was also used in other racing categories like CART, Formula 3000, and Sportscar racing, but that is the subject of another blog.\n\nThe engine was so powerful, reliable and, most of all, affordable it allowed several small manufacturers to join Formula 1, like Williams or Ligier. Practically every team in the 1970s used it at one point or another except for Ferrari, having a reliable engine meant that the teams could focus on other areas of the car to get the most advantage like aerodynamics.\n\nThe 1970s is an era probably of the most radical designs in F1 history like the Tyrell P34 or 6-wheeler, the Brabham BT46B or Fan car and the famous Lotus 79 with its ground effect body and now classic black and gold John Player Special livery, that will also help define this era.\n\nThis was a decade were 13 team won races, mostly dominated by Ferrari, Lotus, McLaren, and Tyrell, but every team really had a shot of F1 glory, when you compare that to the last decade dominated by Red Bull (2010–13) and Mercedes Benz (2014 -2020).\n\nAs I mentioned in the previous blog, in 1967 Colin Chapman reached a deal with the Imperial tobacco company to fully sponsor his team for 1968, and for the first time, the Lotus cars were painted red and white with gold stripes, abandoning the traditional national color: British green.\n\nIn motorsports, racing teams used established colors to identify their vehicles so, as an example, French cars were painted blue with white numbers, British cars were painted green with white numbers, Italian cars were painted red, Japanese cars were painted white and red, American cars were painted white with blue stripes or blue with white stripes, like the Cunningham or the Shelby Daytona.\n\nOne curious story; the German colors were originally white with red numbers. During inspection day at the 1934 Nurburgring GP, the car was too heavy, per the regulation the maximum weight limit was 750 Kg (1,650 lbs.). On the scales, it allegedly recorded 751 Kg (1,651 lbs. ) so Mercedes Benz team manager Alfred Neubauer ordered the team to strip the color of the car leaving the bare metal exposed. It was then they were able to meet the weight requirement and that is how the legend of the famous “Silver arrows” was born.\n\nThat agreement allowed Colin Chapman to have additional resources to experiment with aerodynamics having the financial backup from Ford and Imperial Tobacco allowed him to try new materials and designs to push the limits.\n\nThe key to this partnership was a new medium that was gaining popularity. Prior to the late ’60s races were covered locally or nationally by Newspapers, specialized magazines, or Radio, however, the only sponsors on the car were the tire suppliers, maybe an oil company or the engine manufacturer, but the sponsorship was very discreet and usually located on the side of the cars.\n\nWhen TV started broadcasting races, it was very difficult to identify the cars on the track since the majority of the TV sets were black and white, so when Gold Leaf sponsored Lotus the bold GOLD LEAF lettering was very easy to spot on the side of the car.\n\nInterestingly Lotus needed to paint the car with an almost “orange” red since Ferrari was running with the national Italian color also known as “Rosso Ferrari” or “Ferrari red” to avoid controversy with Enzo Ferrari\n\nThe garages did not improve too much in the beginning, however, with the extra money available the teams were able to improve their equipment, transportation vehicles, etc. including the salaries of their drivers. By the middle of the decade, F1 drivers were almost devoted 100% of their time to their teams, with the occasional race outside the F1 bubble, but that was the exception, not the rule.\n\nThis was also the decade where the Very Important People (VIP) Paddock was created. In 1973 a flamboyant British aristocrat named Lord Hesketh entered the Formula One scene famous for running an unconventional and very patriotic team, Hesketh Racing, famously refusing any sponsorship and funding the team himself.\n\nDue to his background he normally had a VIP section for his friends, having champagne, caviar, lobster, and other food delicacies available breaking the previous “family style” fraternity from the ’60s, he also had a very talented lineup of drivers with James Hunt and Alan Jones. The team scored one victory in 1975 and a total of nine podiums.\n\nShortly after Imperial Tobacco entered the picture more companies saw the potential of the F1 exposure to the new TV market: Phillip Morris (Marlboro), Parmalat (Dairy Products), Martini (Alcoholic Beverages), FIAT (automobiles), AGIP (Oil/Chemicals), Yardley (Personal Care), Elf (Oil/Chemicals) and Shell (Gasoline/Oil), to name a few, entered the scene and provided the teams the financial stability to focus on their racing efforts.\n\nIt was at this time when slick tires were first introduced by Firestone on the 1971 Spanish Grand Prix., these are tires with no tread on them. During the 1960s, the tires of an F1 car were not much different from the ones used on a passenger car, slick tires do not deform too much under load and allow the tire to be built with softer compounds without excessive blistering and overheating.\n\nSince there are no grooves there is more traction due to the greater contact area, greater traction equals greater control of the vehicle at high speeds and during cornering.\n\nAs you can see, external financing through sponsorships and having a reliable engine allowed the car manufacturers to develop the most radical designs. This of course increased the top speed and the cars were always pushed to the limit, which sadly led to numerous deaths throughout the decade.\n\nThere were 12 in total, including one famous accident that thankfully did not end in tragedy, the one of Niki Lauda in Germany in 1976, these accidents led the teams, drivers, and organizers to start thinking seriously about driver safety.\n\nThe final race of the year at Suzuka was delayed due to heavy rain and the drivers refused to drive under those conditions, however, due to the Television contract, the drivers agreed to race, Niki Lauda was coming back to race still with a chance to win the Championship after his terrible accident a few weeks back.\n\nAfter starting the race under rain he retired after a number of laps because the conditions were, according to him “Awful and unsafe”. The Ferrari mechanics asked him to blame the car, but Niki refused, eventually, James Hunt finished 3rd, enough to win the Championship by 1 point.\n\nThis decade is also sadly remembered as the one that awarded the only posthumous Formula One Drivers’ Championship trophy to Jochen Rindt, who died on September 5, 1970, at Monza driving for Lotus.\n\nBy the end of the decade, some manufactures decided to explore the engine limits once again. The rule book allowed manufacturers to use turbo or supercharging to increase power, however, the displacement needed to be reduced to 1.5 liters.\n\nIn 1977, Renault decided to use a turbocharged engine derived from their sports car program, however, the systems were very unreliable at the time since electronics were also not fully developed.\n\nThe car achieved one pole position and a 4th place in 1978 showing its potential, which opened the door to other manufacturers to begin research and lead F1 to the famous Turbo Era of the 1980s\n\nBut that is the subject of next week’s blog, Happy new year to all my readers!!
