I thought at the time - and still do - it was a beautiful little car & as a racing mad 13 year old \"adopted\" it as my favourite racing car.\n\nSeeing Trevor Taylors works FJ example at an Oulton Park race later the same year re-inforced my passion.

Yes it is a distinctive design, but compared to say the 25, 49, 72, 79 mentioned before, it is just well, plain ugly lol. However I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and generally fast is beautiful\n\nOriginally posted by roger ellis\n\nI definitely remember the sensation caused by Innes's 18s roundly defeating Stirling twice in one day at the Easter Goodwood meeting - it even made the daily newspapers, an unusual occurance at the time as it usually took a tragedy in racing to hit the UK dailies.\n\nOriginally posted by roger ellis\n\nIn my opinion the 18 moved things on in F1 in 1960, while it's fragility was a concern, it can't have been too fragile when Stirling's 18/21 won at the Nordschleife in 61, a circuit notoriously hard on chassis.\n\nOriginally posted by David Beard\n\nI remember that too...but I think the reports were more along the lines that a new Racing Ace had emerged (to challenge Moss), rather than a significant new racing car.\n\nOriginally posted by roger ellis\n\nAbsolutely correct, David, but wasn't that due to the superiority of his 18s over Stirling's Coopers which put Innes in the limelight on that memorable day.\n\nOriginally posted by Wolf\n\n* a funny thing just occured to me- is there a good (preferably colour) photo of Innes in that race? Moss had green bottom and blue top, with yellow wheels- would Innes then have had a blue bottom with green top and white wheels?\n\nNo picture, but Ireland used a UDT-Laystall top\n\nOriginally posted by roger ellis\n\nI\n\nHowever, the gist of the thread is this. As the first Lotus rear engined GP car it quite justifiably earned a reputation for, er, fragility; has this caused the car to be over-looked & un-loved?"
