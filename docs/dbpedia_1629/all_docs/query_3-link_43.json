A development of the Seven is still being produced by Caterham today. With a glass fibre monocoque chassis and drag coefficient of just 0.29, the Elite was years ahead of its time. The Lotus Eleven won the 750cc Class of the Index of Performance at Le Mans.\n\nTwo Turbo Esprits starred in the latest Bond film, ‘For Your Eyes Only’. The first, a Monaco White car, was famous for its explosive burglar alarm. The second, painted Copper Fire bronze was fitted with ski racks and used for filming scenes in the ski resort of Cortina in Italy. The revolutionary Lotus Type 88 was the first F1 car to be designed with a carbon fibre monocoque and twin chassis, but it was banned by the sport’s governing body.\n\nThe 2+2 Lotus Type 89 Excel was launched in October.

The Federal Elise goes on sale in the United States. Total Elise production reaches 20,000 making it the most popular Lotus ever.\n\nIn July Lotus unveils the Evija – the first all-electric British hypercar. With a target power output of 2,000 PS, it is the world’s most powerful series production road car. The mid-mounted battery pack echoes the celebrated Lotus mid-engined sports car layout. Production will begin in 2020 and is limited to just 130 cars – in tribute to its Lotus ‘Type’ number, 130.\n\nLotus announces the Evora GT, the most powerful road-going Lotus for North American markets, to critical acclaim from media.\n\nLotus partners with British Cycling to create a new track bike for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, postponed to 2021 as a result of Covid-19.\n\nLotus confirmed production of the Elise, Exige and Evora sports cars will end during 2021. Final Edition versions of the Elise and Exige are revealed.\n\nMatt Windle is appointed Managing Director, Lotus Cars.\n\nLotus unveils the Emira, the last petrol-powered sports car and the 'best of breed'.
