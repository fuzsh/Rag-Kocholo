The first World Championship race of the 1½-litre Formula 1 era introduced for 1961 was the Monaco Grand Prix and Ferrari’s powerful new ‘shark-nose’ cars were expected to dominate it, but Moss used all his craft and guile to take a celebrated win in his Lotus 18.\n\nThe first World Championship race of the 1½-litre Formula 1 era introduced for 1961 was the Monaco Grand Prix and Ferrari’s powerful new ‘shark-nose’ cars were expected to dominate it, but Moss used all his craft and guile to take a celebrated win in his Lotus 18. Although Ferrari did prove to be the dominant force that season, Moss scored a second success in this same car, chassis number 912, at the Nürburgring, a race that turned out to be the last World Championship Formula 1 victory of his career. The car’s entire 1961 season, and its subsequent life, is covered in fascinating detail in this ‘Great Cars’ book, supported by a fine collection of period photographs.\n\nAn in-depth account of the dramatic 1961 Monaco Grand Prix includes Stirling Moss’s recollections of his win in his Rob Walker-entered Lotus 18, which famously raced with its side panels removed.\n\nKey content\n\nThe car’s seven other World Championship Formula 1 races of the 1961 season covered in full, with special focus on Moss’s victory in the German Grand Prix.\n\nA third race success came in 1961 when Moss won the non-championship Modena Grand Prix.\n\nInsights into Rob Walker Racing, the most successful ‘privateer’ team in Formula 1 history, including the recollections of mechanic Tony Cleverly.\n\nFor the 1962 season, the car passed to Count Volpi’s Scuderia SSS Repubblica di Venezia team and took part in five non-championship races, achieving a best result of sixth place for Nino Vaccarella in the Pau Grand Prix.\n\nLater life, including a spell in Tom Wheatcroft’s Donington Collection.\n\nNearly 300 period images, many previously unpublished, supported by a portfolio of studio photography.\n\nLimited Edition\n\nLimited to just 100 copies signed by author Ian Wagstaff and Tony Cleverly, the Rob Walker Racing team Mechanic.\n\nThe Author\n\nIan Wagstaff began his career in the offices of Motor Sport and Motoring News before becoming Press and Promotions Manager at Silverstone Circuit. He went on to be an editor in the trade press. He has been working freelance since 1986, writing for the motor-racing press, plus automotive trade and business publications. Ian has won a number of awards for his work and is twice winner of the Guild of Motoring Writers Montagu of Beaulieu Trophy for his books. He is also a past winner of the Motorworld Book Prize (Motorsport category) for his first book in the Porter Press Great Cars series which covered the story of the 1970 Le Mans-winning Porsche 917.\n\nTitle Information\n\nAuthor: Ian Wagstaff\n\nPublication: September 2017\n\nSpecifications: approx. 240mm x 290mm hardback, page extent 320pp. Bound in dark blue leather. Grey slipcase.\n\nIllustrations: Over 300 photographs\n\nLanguage: English\n\nPublisher: Porter Press International\n\nISBN: 978-1-907085-03-1\n\nAt Amalgam Collection we create models at a range of scales. For those of you unfamiliar with the way the system works, these scales represent the ratio between the size of a model and its full size counterpart. Here are the scales we make with the average lengths of the model alongside. Put simply, the bigger the number to the right of the colon, the smaller the model car:\n\nSculpts…...11 cms (4 inches) long\n\n1:18…...25 cms (10 inches) long\n\n1:12…...38 cms (15 inches) long\n\n1:8….....60 cms (24 inches) long\n\n1:5….....92 cms (36 inches) long\n\n1:4. ….120 cms (48 inches) long\n\nOur primary focus is on collections at 1:18 and 1:8 scales. It’s at those scales we create the majority of our model range, with just a few examples at the other scales. Bespoke models are only available at the bigger 1:8 scale and we tend to build one-offs at the even bigger 1:5 or 1:4."
