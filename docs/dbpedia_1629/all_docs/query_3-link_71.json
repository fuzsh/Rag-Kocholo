        "text": "Formula 1 fans got their first glimpse of the new generation of V6 hybrid turbo cars on this day 10 years ago.\n\nBut Force India, the first team to officially reveal an image of their new car, were somewhat coy about doing so, releasing only a rendering of their new VJM07 in profile. The team did not want to reveal the peculiar shape of its new nose, a side effect of the new regulations shared by almost every team.\n\nStrange though these new appendages on most cars were, future iterations of the rules addressed them. But a more controversial change at the other end of the cars was here to stay.\n\nEight years after its last change in engine regulations, Formula 1 had another new formula. FIA president Jean Todt, who took charge in 2010, had pushed for the introduction of V6 hybrid turbo power units. F1 had introduced hybrid power to its engines as early as 2009, but the new engines were designed from the ground up to incorporate two advanced systems for recovering kinetic and heat energy – the MGU-H and MGU-K.\n\nBut the move from conventional V8 engines to V6 hybrid turbos was not without its detractors. Not least the person running the show at the time. F1 CEO Bernie Ecclestone made plain his dislike. Time and again he went to the media with fresh quotes trashing his own championship in terms Gerald Ratner would have blanched at.\n\nChief among his objections was how much quieter the engines would become. And when it emerged Mercedes had produced by far the best power unit for the new rules, and mated it to a chassis which exploited its potential better than any other, his contempt peaked. “I’m sure the promoters will lose a big audience and I’m quite sure we’ll lose TV,” he warned.\n\nBut 10 years on, Ecclestone is long gone, and the V6 hybrid turbos remain. By the time they are replaced the rules will have been in place 12 years, account for over 250 grands prix.\n\nDoes that longevity prove the rules change was right all along? And how have the hybrid power units reshaped the sport over the last decade?\n\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free\n\nReliability\n\nThe sheer complexity of the new power units prompted concerns of widespread reliability problems when they were introduced. Sure enough, not all teams were ready to run when testing began in late January 2014, and those who did completed precious few laps.\n\nOn the opening day of testing at the Jerez circuit in Spain, just eight cars circulated, only half of which registered lap counts in double digits. Between them all they covered less than 100 laps.\n\nBut although the new power units were inevitably less reliable than the long-used engines they replaced, fears the season opener might see only a few cars stagger to the finish were unfounded. Of the 22 starters, 16 were still running at the finish.\n\nSome manufacturers found it harder to achieve reliability with the new power units than others. Renault had problems from the outset, as did Honda, whose engines were first raced by McLaren in 2015.\n\nIn an effort to keep costs down, teams were given strict limits on how many examples of each different power unit part they could use over the course of a season. These rules remain, but the regulations which enforced them were originally much stricter.\n\nA driver who took too many new parts could be given time penalties during the race under the original rules. These were eventually relaxed, and teams instead clocked up grid penalties of ludicrous sizes, topping out with Jenson Button’s 70-place grid drop at the 2015 Mexican Grand Prix.\n\nBy 2023, with power unit development frozen for the last two seasons, reliability has become less of a concern. However teams had the advantage of being permitted an extra power unit last year and the championship was two races shorter than planned. They will face a tougher test in 2024.\n\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free\n\nPerformance\n\nThe new power units were unquestionably a step backwards in performance in the short term. But, this being F1, that was clawed back swiftly: By 2016 lap times at Silverstone were back to what they had been at the end of the V8 era.\n\nThe development potential of the V6 hybrid turbos reduced and eventually stopped when engine specifications were frozen in 2021. But major changes in F1’s aerodynamic rules first helped teams unlock more performance (2017), then clipped the wings of their cars (2022).\n\nCompetitiveness\n\nDid the switch to V6 hybrid turbo power units put the kibosh on a competitive era of racing or merely replace one form of domination with another?\n\nAfter all, the 2013 season ended with Red Bull reeling off nine consecutive grand prix victories as Sebastian Vettel coasted to his fourth world title in a row. On the face of it, hardly a peak era of competitiveness.\n\nBut two of those titles had come in gripping, down-to-the-wire title fights between Vettel and Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso (and, in 2010, two other drivers). The 2013 season began with six races won by four different drivers and teams, and Red Bull’s domination of the final rounds was arguably aided by their rivals switching tack to focus on their new 2014 cars.\n\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free\n\nMercedes’ domination of the beginning of the V6 hybrid turbo era became clear when they cruised to victory in the season opening race by almost half a minute (and the closest car to the victorious Nico Rosberg was disqualified). Later one senior team member admitted they detuned their engines in qualifying because they feared the rules would be changed to neuter their advantage if they revealed its full extent.\n\nEven so the prospect of them facing serious competition in the near future seemed remote. Happily, Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton at least fought for the title to the final race, and did again two years later.\n\nIt took further rules changes to bring the competition within range of Mercedes, beginning with an overhaul of the aerodynamic regulations in 2017. Vettel pushed Hamilton hard for the title then and the year after, but in 2019 Ferrari squandered chance after chance to win. That winter the FIA took a close look at the Ferrari engine, reached a deeply contentious private settlement, and suddenly the red cars were nowhere – two seasons passed without them winning a race.\n\nIn the meantime Honda’s power units finally came good. Red Bull and Max Verstappen wielded them superbly and in 2021 another rules change disrupted Mercedes’ start to the season and put the two on roughly level terms. An epic championship fight began, which ended in an unworthy and notorious finale.\n\nIn the meantime Liberty Media had replaced CVC as F1’s owners, and Ecclestone shown the door. For 2022 it introduced another shake-up of the aerodynamic regulations, targeted at closing up the field and aiding overtaking. Though that appears to have happened to some extent, Red Bull have proved largely immune to it, and their dominance of the past two seasons has outstripped what Mercedes achieved at the beginning of the V6 hybrid turbo era.\n\nCompetitors\n\nThe first years of the V6 hybrid turbo era were those of the ‘big three’ teams – Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull – versus the rest. Six years passed without a single other team winning a race.\n\nThis was not merely a consequence of the engine rules, but also a result of F1 paying a larger share of its prize money to those teams. The latter was addressed by Liberty Media and new regulations introduced to cap teams’ budgets and permit teams which finish lower in the championship to conduct more development work.\n\nThe evidence of 2022 and 2023 suggests this has been a less than total success. But thus far Liberty Media are sticking to their plan and not imposed knee-jerk rules changes in the hope of conjuring up some competition for the all-conquering Red Bull. The 2024 F1 season will indicate whether their confidence in their approach has worked, though the question of whether Red Bull were punished sufficiently for exceeding the budget cap in 2021 overshadows this debate.\n\nBut the new engines had pushed up the cost of competition and the smallest teams faced the added pressure of receiving little to no prize money. Only two of the three new teams which entered in 2010 had it as far as the new hybrid era, and during its first year Caterham ran out of money, appearing at the finale only after a fundraising campaign.\n\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free\n\nThe Marussia team suffered the agony of Jules Bianchi’s terrible crash at Suzuka that year, which lead to his death nine months later. The team continued, however, thanks to Bianchi’s breakthrough points score in Monaco which meant they ended 2014 ninth in the championship.\n\nHowever the arrival of promising newcomers Haas in 2016 saw the former Marussia team, now named Manor, slip to last place. The loss of income spelled the end for another team, leaving F1 down to just 10.\n\nIn the meantime many others have changed hands and identities, including Sauber (briefly Alfa Romeo, soon to be Audi), Force India (now Aston Martin) and Lotus (now Alpine). Williams changed hands too, though its name remains.\n\nThe least flattering measure of the V6 hybrid era’s success is the number of engine manufacturers it attracted thus far. However that is due to change from its next iteration in 2026.\n\nCosworth left F1 when the V6 hybrids arrived, leaving the series without an independent engine builder. While Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault all remained, only one newcomer appeared – Honda, in 2015. But after just five years, during which time they had gone from the back of the grid to race winners on course for championship success, they announced their departure once more.\n\nBut although the V6 hybrid turbo era initially failed to win over many new manufacturers, that looks set to change. In 2026 F1 will move to a V6 hybrid turbo without the MGU-H, but with a more powerful electric component. That, plus F1’s rising popularity, has persuaded Honda to return as a constructor, plus Audi with Sauber, and Ford in partnership with Red Bull. Porsche also expressed serious interest in joining and Cadillac is poised to do so as well from 2028, if F1 decides it can tolerate becoming an 11-team championship again.\n\nOn to the second era\n\nThe V6 hybrid turbos arrived at a time when the FIA – but not Formula 1 – was realising it could not ignore the trend towards electrification. All-electric series Formula E arrived the same year, and other series have made similar moves or are planning to do the same, however belatedly.\n\nIt is tempting to argue that, on the strength of how few new car manufacturers came to F1 after 2014, the rules were too far ahead of their time. But how attractive was the sport as a whole to manufacturers at that time?\n\nEcclestone’s furious denunciations of the engine format were hardly likely to win newcomers over.
