This 1960 Lotus 18 is one of approximately 120 built for use in the Formula Junior series in the early 1960s. Finished in green with white roundels over red upholstery, the car is powered by a Cosworth-Ford 105E series 1,100cc inline-four paired with a Hewland five-speed manual transaxle. Additional equipment includes twin Weber carburetors, 15″ magnesium wheels, a roll hoop, a wrap-around windscreen, a fire suppression system, and Smiths instrumentation. The car is said to have been refurbished in the early 2020s, and it was acquired by the seller in 2021. Subsequent service reportedly involved overhauling the brake system, installing Hoosier race tires, and replacing the fuel, oil, and water pumps. This Lotus 18 Junior is now offered in Illinois with a spare gearbox and a bill of sale.

Designed by Colin Chapman, the Type 18 was introduced for the 1960 season as Lotus’ first mid-engined Grand Prix car design. The Formula Junior variant featured a modified engine, gearbox, and brakes over the Formula One-specification cars, and it was succeeded by the Type 20 in 1961. This example’s removable bodywork has been refinished in green with #9 roundels, and exterior details include a wrap-around windscreen, a roll hoop, and dual side mirrors. Imperfections in the finish are noted along the white nose stripe.

White-finished 15″ wobbly-web magnesium wheels wear Hoosier Vintage T.D. tires that are said to have been mounted in July 2022. The car is equipped with rack-and-pinion steering along with coilovers at each corner. The four-wheel drum brake system reportedly received replacement cylinders and shoes under current ownership.

The cockpit houses a single fixed bucket seat trimmed in red upholstery accompanied by color-coordinated dash and steering wheel trim. Appointments include a Willans multi-point harness, a fire suppression system, and a polished shifter oriented to the driver’s right.

A red three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of Smiths instrumentation that includes a reverse-sweep 8k-rpm tachometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The car is not equipped with a speedometer or odometer, and total mileage is unknown.

The Cosworth-modified Ford 105E series 1,100cc inline-four reportedly received replacement bearings under previous ownership, while the crankshaft was balanced and polished. Twin Weber carburetors are equipped, and work performed since 2021 is said to have involved replacing the battery as well as the fuel, oil, and water pumps.

Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Hewland Mk III five-speed manual transaxle that was installed under current ownership. The removed Renault gearbox will accompany the sale and is pictured in the gallery below.

The reproduction data plate lists chassis number 18-J-815, which is consistent with a Type 18 produced by Lotus in 1960. Frame stamping 102 is shown in the gallery below.

The car is not legal for road use and does not have a title. It is being sold on a bill of sale.
