This 1960 Lotus 18 is one of approximately 120 cars produced for use in the US Formula Junior series. The car was originally delivered to Mexico before making its way to Texas, California, and Minnesota per the seller. The 18 was Lotus’ first mid-engine race car, and this example is fitted with a Ford 105E series 1,100cc engine and a 4-speed Hewland transaxle. A professional restoration was completed in the 1990s, including the construction of a new frame. The original Renault transaxle and bell housing adapter are included with the sale along with the original frame, and the seller most recently raced the car in Savannah, Georgia in 2016. This Lotus is sold on a bill of sale with a spares package, restoration pictures and invoices, set up sheets, lap timing sheets, and a log book.

The restoration is said to have been carried out to a high standard. A new frame was constructed, though the original is included and displayed in the photo gallery below. Exterior cosmetics are described by the seller as strong overall with glossy paint, a few small stress cracks, and a chip on the front Lotus badge. Extensive chassis and suspension pictures are also shown in the gallery, and the Dunlop tires are claimed to be near-new.

The original arch number was transplanted over to the new frame as shown above.

During the restoration, the driver’s area was fitted with a red bucket seat, dashboard, and steering wheel rim in accordance with Lotus’ traditional vintage racing livery. Safety has been improved with a Halon fire suppression system.

Correct Smiths gauges are in place, and a modern Accusump system sits behind the driver’s seat as highlighted in the photo gallery. In 1995, the previous owner acquired this car from Robin LeGrand, the son of Red LeGrand. When Robin purchased the car he had a falling out with the prior owner, who destroyed the original number on the dash plaque. It has since been replicated.

The Ford 105E series 1,100cc four is features dual Weber carburetors, a Richardson cylinder head, Crowther bottom end, polished ports, a fully baffled six-quart oil pan, high-output dry sump oil pump, electronic ignition, and Aeroquip fittings. A fuel cell is also present, and the seller states the car runs well with even compression and a light service performed last year.

A 4-speed Hewland transaxle is currently installed and geared for Sonoma Raceway and Laguna Seca per the seller. The original Renault transaxle and bell housing adapter are included with the sale as shown in the photo gallery.

In addition to the original frame pictured above, spares included with the sale consist of four brake drums, a clutch and flywheel, two pressure plates, two A-arms, four coolant pipes, rod ends, a cylinder head with valves/springs, and miscellaneous other hardware/parts.
