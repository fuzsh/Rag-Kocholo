        "text": "Date of Action: 31 December 1968\n\nDate of Award: 16 May 1969\n\nFor heroism on the morning of 31 December 1968 as a copilot of a Coast Guard HH-52A helicopter engaged in the rescue of a stranded hunter from Sand Island, near Bridal Veil, Oregon. Blowing snow, 65-knot winds, poor visibility, and air temperatures near zero prevented a rescue by vessel or helicopter on the first day. On the second day, despite continuously severe weather, the aircraft hovered between 10 and 50 feet above the Columbia River and air taxied to the island navigating by spotting surface aids. On the second pass, one man was sighted leaning against a tree with the other hunter in a prone position. Lacking a clear area for the hoist in the vicinity of the victims, the helicopter maneuvered approximately 60 yards upwind and hovered while Lieutenant ADDISON was lowered to the ground. While the pilot searched for a clearing, Lieutenant ADDISON was guided by hand signals from the crewman to the location and although severely handicapped by the bitter cold, ascertained that one man had died and one was suffering from extreme exposure and frostbite in both legs. He then persevered and reassured the hunter while simultaneously helping him to a nearby clearing where both men were hoisted to safety. Lieutenant ADDISON demonstrated initiative, fortitude, and courage in spite of imminent personal danger. His unselfish action and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\nDate of Action: 11 June 1967\n\nDate of Award: 28 March 1968\n\nFor heroism on the morning of 11 June 1967, while serving as a volunteer swimmer from the Coast Guard Loran Station, Hawaii, engaged in the rescue of three survivors from a downed Cessna 172 which had crashed in the ocean approximately 500 yards off Upolu Point, Hawaii. The victims, two men and two women, although injured, had managed to climb out of the plane which sank immediately in 80 feet of water. When advised of the ditching and location of the plane, Seaman AKANA and four teammates dived into the choppy, shark-infested waters and swam out to rescue the survivors. When the four occupants of the plane were located, one was unconscious, one was bleeding profusely from a head wound, and two other persons were in apparent shock. The rescuers then began assisting the survivors back to shore where they were treated by Coast Guard personnel. Despite Seaman AKANA’s valiant efforts in immediately rendering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the unconscious victim, the man succumbed to his injuries. Seaman AKANA demonstrated initiative, fortitude and daring in spite of imminent personal danger during the entire rescue mission. His unselfish actions, courage, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citations: Bennett, George G., Crisler, Lynn T., Olsen, Robert D. and Pearce, Robert E.)\n\nDate of Action: 25 May 1982\n\nDate of Award: 18 October 1982\n\nPetty Officer ALESSANDRINI is cited for heroism on 25 May 1982 when he secured a towing hawser to the 186-foot M/V WESTPRO and assisted in the tow of a disabled boat with four persons on board to safety. The WESTPRO was burning out of control and grounded on the east break wall of the Seward, Alaska boat harbor. Following numerous explosions of dangerous chemicals that caused the evacuation of the north side of the City of Seward, Petty Officer ALESSANDRINI volunteered as coxswain of the small boat from USCGC CAPE JELLISON [WPB-95317]. As he brought the small boat alongside WESTPRO, his crewman secured the towing hawser to the burning ship and cut its anchor cable. As CAPE JELLISON took WESTPRO in tow, Petty Officer ALESSANDRINI observed a disabled boat with four persons on board that was in danger of colliding with WESTPRO. With complete disregard for his own safety, Petty Officer ALESSANDRINI positioned the small boat so that a tow-line could be secured and the boat was towed to safety. Petty Officer ALESSANDRINI demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude and seamanship throughout this incident. His unselfish actions, courage, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citation: Ray, Thomas A.)\n\nDate of Action: 13 August 1967\n\nDate of Award: 02 November 1967\n\nFor heroism on the afternoon of August 13, 1967 while serving as boat engineer on the CG-40462, engaged in the perilous rescue of four persons, two of whom were trapped inside a capsized pleasure craft, in the vicinity of Clatsop Spit on the Columbia River, Ilwaco, Washington. The CG-40462, on safety patrol outside the bar, arrived within minutes, maneuvered alongside the overturned boat, rescued the two persons clinging to the top, and learned that two others were trapped inside. Fireman AMBROSE unhesitatingly entered the 55o water in six-foot breaking swells. When all attempts to right the boat failed, Fireman AMBROSE and another Coast Guardsman made repeated dives under the pleasure craft and, although hampered by entangling fish lines and fouled life preserves, removed the victims. A man, suffering from shock, was placed in the rescue basket of a helicopter on-scene. Fireman AMBROSE and his companion then returned and extricated a woman who had lost consciousness. While awaiting the helicopter basket, Fireman AMBROSE began administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the survivor. Fireman AMBROSE demonstrated initiative, fortitude and daring in spite of imminent personal danger. His un-selfish actions, courage, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citation: Brott, Lindley D.)\n\nDate of Action: 25 November 2000\n\nDate of Award: 13 October 2001\n\nPetty Officer AN is cited for extraordinary heroism on 25 November 2000 while assigned to USCGC STORIS (WMEC 38) during the rescue of nine Coast Guardsmen from the Bering Sea. As a law enforcement team from STORIS was being launched over the side in the motor surfboat, the ship's aft davit arm snapped and all nine sailors were dropped into the freezing seas. Without hesitation, Petty Officer AN dressed out in rescue swimmer gear and plunged into the turbulent waters where he quickly brought order to a chaotic scene. The boarding crew was scattered the length of the ship and the three-ton small boat was slamming into the hull amidst a tangle of wire rope and broken metal. Petty Officer AN calmed one crewman who was succumbing to hypothermia and towed the stunned man through six-foot swells to the ship's well deck, where he was hoisted aboard. In order to get another man who was foundering near the stern, Petty Officer AN, with complete disregard for his own safety, unclipped his safety harness in order to safely navigate the perilous swim around the capsized small boat. This left him at the mercy of the sea, with no possible assistance from those on deck. He swam to the drowning man and, displaying herculean strength, pulled him from danger. Only after seeing all hands safely aboard did Petty Officer AN climb out of the arctic waters, where he then collapsed due to the exhaustion and exposure. Petty Officer AN demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger in this rescue. His courage and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.\n\nDate of Action: 29 April to 2 May 1969\n\nDate of Award: 08 December 1969\n\nChief Warrant Officer (CWO2) ANDERSON is cited for heroic conduct during the period 29 April to 2 May 1969 while serving as acting engineering officer of USCGC COURAGEOUS [WMEC-622] engaged in fire fighting operations for the gasoline and naphtha-laden tanker MOBIL APEX in Limetree Bay, St. Croix, Virgin Islands. With total disregard for his own safety, Chief Warrant Officer ANDERSON voluntarily boarded the burning vessel for initial evaluation of the fire. Internal explosions were occurring in the stern section of the MOBIL APEX every ten minutes and towering flames were pouring from the after superstructure and one cargo tank of naphtha. Determining that fire fighting would be impossible at this time, plans were made to attempt the operation the next morning when he again boarded the blazing MOBIL APEX and heroically directed the extremely hazardous mission. Through his dedicated efforts he contributed significantly to saving the stricken tanker. Chief Warrant Officer ANDERSON’s exemplary courage and unwavering devotion to duty in spite of imminent personal danger reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citation: Helmer, George P. and Sanders, Charles H.)\n\nDate of Action: 05 April 1976\n\nDate of Award: 20 May 1976\n\nMaster Chief Petty Officer AUGUSTUS is cited for heroism on the morning of 5 April 1976 while enroute from Juneau, Alaska to Ketchikan aboard a commercial airliner. During the landing at Ketchikan, the jetliner overran the end of the runway, plummeted into a ravine, broke into several pieces, ruptured her fuel tanks, and burst into flames. Before attempting to exit from the burning wreck, Master Chief Petty Officer AUGUSTUS, a member of the Seventeenth Coast Guard District Staff Inspection Team, freed a trapped and injured stewardess and assisted her to the forward cabin door. After the stewardess had been lifted from the aircraft and carried to safety, he descended to the muskeg below, braced himself against the fuselage and assisted the escaping passengers while acting as a “human ladder.” With total disregard for his personal safety, Master Chief Petty Officer AUGUSTUS courageously returned to the cockpit area of the aircraft in an attempt to rescue the trapped pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer. Constantly faced with the threat of a devastating explosion, he none-the-less remained at the scene of the conflagration and rescued an elderly woman who was precariously hanging by her foot from an open door. Undaunted, Master Chief Petty Officer AUGUSTUS again returned to the cockpit area and was thwarted in his attempts to gain access on the left side of the fuselage. Without hesitation, he traversed under the nose of the burning plane to the right side where entry was once again thwarted. In search of the necessary access equipment, he then proceeded up a nearby hillside to an airport crash truck. The hapless crewmembers were subsequently rescued as additional assistance arrived on scene. Master Chief Petty Officer AUGUSTUS demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and heroic daring in spite of grave personal danger during this aircraft disaster. His unselfish actions, courage, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citation: Bickford, William J.)\n\nDate of Action: 10 to 22 February 1972\n\nDate of Award: 20 June 1972\n\nChief Petty Officer AZEVEDO is cited for heroism in the performance of duty while serving aboard USCGC KLAMATH [WHEC-66] during the period 10 to 22 February 1972 engaged in rendering assistance to the Japanese freighter TENZAN MARU which was flooding and in danger of capsizing in the North Pacific Ocean, approximately 720 miles southwest of Kodiak, Alaska. Disregarding his own safety, Chief Petty Officer AZEVEDO voluntarily boarded the distressed vessel and assisted in shoring and repairing the vessel throughout the 13-day period under hazardous conditions of flooding, shifting cargo, and the threat of complete structural failure. His constant alertness was demonstrated when he observed a shipmate’s foot wedged between two timbers that were being scissored together by hull pressure. With a tremendous display of strength, he lifted his shipmate free and prevented a severe injury or probable amputation. On one occasion, Chief Petty Officer AZEVEDO entered the water in number two hold to patch holes and cracks resulting form shell plating separating from the frames. Though Chief Petty Officer AZEVEDO was in constant personal danger, through his untiring efforts, perseverance, and outstanding professional abilities, critical repairs were accomplished in 15 to 20-foot seas and high winds, enabling the TENZAN MARU and her 34 crew members to reach San Francisco Bay without loss of life or further serious damage. Chief Petty Officer AZEVEDO’s unselfish actions, remarkable courage, sound judgement, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United Sates Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citations: Iness, Robert A. and Soland, James G.)\n\nDate of Action: 28 July 1978\n\nDate of Award: 28 March 1979\n\nPetty Officer BAGBY is cited for heroism on the night of 28 July 1978 when he rescued a woman from drowning in the pounding surf of Lake Erie at the Lorain, Ohio Harbor Outer Break wall. Upon receipt of a distress call from a disabled pleasure craft, Petty Officer BAGBY was dispatched from Coast Guard Station Lorain as boat engineer of Coast Guard rescue boat CG-41391. Arriving on scene, the pleasure craft was observed foundering on the break wall rocks. Of the six persons on board, four had reached the relative safety of the break wall, one had disappeared in the breaking surf, and one woman remained in the water. Petty Officer BAGBY assisted in throwing a life ring to the woman, but the 20 to 30-mile per hour winds, darkness, and heavy seas prevented her form grasping it. Realizing that the woman’s strength was waning, Petty Officer BAGBY, with complete disregard for his personal safety, immediately entered the water with a life ring and swam through the pounding 6 to 8-foot waves to her. As he attempted to support the woman in the turbulent water, a large breaker tore the life ring from his grasp. Successive waves drove Petty Officer BAGBY against the break wall rocks, as he maintained his hold on the woman until the boat was able to maneuver close enough to again pass a life ring to him. After being pulled to safety, Petty Officer BAGBY, although near exhaustion, immediately commenced treating the woman for shock and later assisted in evacuating the remaining four survivors. Petty Officer BAGBY demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger in this rescue. His unselfish actions, courage and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\nDate of Action: 30 August 1991\n\nDate of Award: ??\n\nPetty Officer BAKER is cited for heroism on the night of 30 August 1991 while serving as a crewmember of Utility Boat CG-41439. During this period, Petty Officer BAKER was engaged in maintaining a safety zone around a barge being used as a platform for a fireworks display at Northeast Harbor, Maine. During the display, sparks from the launched fireworks ignited stockpiled pyrotechnics on the deck of the barge, resulting in a tremendous explosion. The explosion forced three persons into the water; another person was apparently unconscious and was ablaze, and a fifth person, remained on the barge, sheltered behind a 55-gallon drum. Petty Officer BAKER immediately grabbed a heaving line to throw to the men in the water as CG-41439 maneuvered closer to the burning barge. He successfully pulled one of the victims onto the small boat and then, without regard to his own safety, leaped onboard the still burning barge to assist in rescuing two persons and bringing them aboard CG-41439. He then went to the bow of the boat and was manning the fire monitor when a second, more powerful explosion occurred. Petty Officer BAKER was fully exposed to the blast and was thrown backwards onto the boat’s superstructure, sustaining burns and wounds to his legs and face, a laceration on his hand, and bruises to his body. He remained alert and coherent as CG-41439 proceeded to Northeast Harbor where medical authorities were waiting. Petty Officer BAKER demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger. His courage and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citations: Bowen, Robert A., Dupuis, Paul J., James, Carol A., and Sherwood, Bruce E.)\n\nDate of Action: 08 April 1966\n\nDate of Award: 09 June 1966\n\nFor heroic conduct on April 8, 1966, while serving on board the USCGC COOK INLET, [WHEC-384] when he boarded the burning and abandoned Norwegian passenger vessel VIKING PRINCESS to search for 40 missing survivors. When advised of the disaster, the COOK INLET departed Guantanamo Bay to assist the Norwegian ship, afire in the vicinity of Windward Passage. Upon arrival, finding the ship burning violently and apparently abandoned, BARNES promptly volunteered as a member of a boarding party to search the vessel for survivors. Despite dense smoke and heat so intense that patches of paint on the outside were bursting into flame, he boarded and assisted in searching all accessible spaces above and below decks, including the infirmary areas and crew quarters. The boarding party remained aboard the flaming hulk for more than 20 minutes, executing a vigorous search until ascertaining that there was practically no chance that any living survivor remained aboard the VIKING PRINCESS. Thereafter, when warned that the fire was advancing under them along the lower decks, the boarding party withdrew. BARNES demonstrated initiative, fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger during the entire operation. His unselfish actions, courage, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United Sates Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citations: Buechler, Albert C.

The HOLMES, one of five fishing vessels returning with a cargo of crabs, after waiting for a temporary calm, was entering the river when she was overtaken by a series of 10 to 12-foot breakers and rendered inoperative. As the turbulent surf swung the fishing boat around to the south side of the South Jetty, she was slammed violently and repeatedly against the jetty and the cabin and steering gear were smashed. The CG-44331 was on bar patrol because of the hazardous bar conditions when Petty Officer BAUER observed the HOLMES taking the large breaking sea and being veered sharply to starboard, ultimately crashing into the jetty. Perceiving the imminent danger to the fishermen, he immediately proceeded through the breakers; skillfully maneuvered the 44-foot lifeboat through the jetty breakers alongside the crippled vessel; and returned to Umpqua Station with the survivors where they were treated for hypothermia and released without injuries. Petty Officer BAUER’s initiative and courageous actions contributed to saving the lives of the three-man-crew.

Seven survivors were recovered clinging onto and in a small life raft. Unfortunately, one person became separated from the raft after it was hit by a 15-foot breaking wave. Seaman BEATTY voluntarily entered the mounting seas in pelting rain, darkness, and 50-knot winds to assist the victim in the water. He swam 60 feet to the imperiled victim and managed to bring him back alongside the cutter, when, without warning, the cutter had to back away to avoid a collision with an oncoming merchant ship, leaving the pair several hundred feet off the bow. In the hazardous conditions, with no protection from the wind and seas, Seaman BEATTY displayed uncanny bravery and presence of mind to press on in spite of the elements, assisting the 270-pound victim by keeping his head above the water. With BAINBRIDGE ISLAND rolling as much as 40 degrees in the breaking seas, Seaman BEATTY's attempts to get a line secured around the increasingly incapacitated victim proved unsuccessful. When another large swell crashed into them, forcing both the rescuer and victim under the cutter, the two became separated. In spite of the gallant efforts of Seaman BEATTY, the victim submerged for the final time, and was lost at sea. Seaman BEATTY demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger in this rescue. His courage and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citations: Duffy, James and Merriam, Jamison)\n\nDate of Action: 11 June 1967\n\nDate of Award: 28 March 1968\n\nFor heroism on the morning of June 11, 1967, while serving as a volunteer swimmer from the Coast Guard Loran Station, Hawaii, engaged in the rescue of three survivors from a downed Cessna 172 which had crashed in the ocean approximately 500 yards off Upolu Point, Hawaii. The victims, two men and two women, although injured, had managed to climb out of the plane which sank immediately in 80 feet of water. When advised of the ditching and location of the plane, Seaman BENNETT and four teammates dived into the choppy, shark-infested waters and swam out to rescue the survivors. When the four occupants of the plane were located, one was unconscious, one was bleeding profusely from a head wound, and two other persons were in apparent shock. The rescuers then began assisting the survivors back to shore where they were treated by Coast Guard personnel. Seaman BENNETT demonstrated initiative, fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger during the entire rescue mission. His unselfish actions, courage, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citations: Akana, Paul H., Crisler, Lynn T., Olsen, Robert D., and Pearce, Robert E.)\n\nDate of Action: 05 April 1976\n\nDate of Award: 20 May 1976\n\nCaptain BICKFORD is cited for heroism on the morning of 5 April 1976 while enroute from Juneau, Alaska to Ketchikan aboard a commercial airliner. During the landing at Ketchikan, the jetliner overran the end of the runway, plummeted into a ravine, broke into several pieces, ruptured her fuel tanks and burst into flames. As a result of his extensive service as a Coast Guard aviator, Captain BICKFORD, serving as the Seventeenth Coast Guard District Staff Inspector, had the keen foresight to mentally pre-plan his escape. Thus, upon final impact and without hesitation, he began the exodus of passengers through the forward cabin door. This effort was culminated by his assisting an injured stewardess from the burning aircraft and bodily carrying her across a stream of volatile jet fuel to a place of refuge. After assuring himself of the safety of the others, Captain BICKFORD returned to the cockpit area of the burning wreck to aid another Coast Guardsman in an attempt to free the trapped flight deck crew. Learning of possible survivors still remaining in the passenger cabin, Captain BICKFORD, his clothing soaked with fuel and with total disregard for his personal safety, courageously climbed back onto the wing and made a final search before leaving he aircraft. He then proceeded up a nearby hillside and directed the awaiting airport firefighting crew into action. This final decisive act undoubtedly retarded the spread of the conflagration sufficiently to permit others to successfully complete the rescue of the hapless flight deck drew prior to the aircraft becoming engulfed in flames. Captain BICKFORD demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and heroic daring in spite of grave personal danger during this aircraft disaster. His unselfish actions, courage, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citation: Augustus, Kenneth W.)\n\nDate of Action: 19 February 1964\n\nDate of Award: 12 March 1964\n\nFor Heroism on 19 February 1964, while serving as a volunteer swimmer aboard the USCGC COOS BAY [WHEC-376] engaged in the rescue of survivors from the foundering British merchant vessel AMBASSADOR, approximately 400 miles south southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Upon arrival of the COOS BAY at the scene, the Search and Rescue team was mustered. BICHREST immediately volunteered for swimmer duty as the COOS BAY was maneuvered in hazardous proximity to the AMBASSADOR. The COOS BAY made approaches close aboard the stricken freighter, removing two men at a time, by hauling them on a line through the sea. On one approach, a survivor was hauled to the embarkation net. The man was completely exhausted from the ordeal and became hopelessly entangled in the net. Three swimmers in the water at the net tried in vain to free him. BICHREST, on deck, noticed the grave plight of the man and, without thought for his own safety, scrambled over the rail with a knife in his teeth. Reaching the water, he cut the man free and secured a line to him. The seaman was hauled aboard in an almost unconscious condition but resuscitative measures subsequently proved successful. BICHREST demonstrated initiative, and fortitude, in spite of extreme personal danger during this rescue, and his actions most certainly saved the man’s life.

Petty Officer BITNER, then a seaman, witnessed the accident; immediately alerted another watch stander of the catastrophe; launched the station small boat and skillfully proceeded to the scene through 25-knot winds and heavy 6-foot seas. As he arrived on scene, he observed one of the three victims being washed away from the capsized vessel in the choppy seas. Quickly throwing life preservers to the two men seen clinging to the overturned fishing boat, he maneuvered the station boat toward the third distressed man who disappeared beneath the water before he could reach him. When his search of the immediate area proved futile, Petty Officer BITNER, cognizant of the debilitating effects of the elements on the other two victims, hastily returned to the capsized boat and single-handedly pulled the semiconscious men from the frigid water; transported them to shore, and then returned to the search area to continue his efforts. Shortly thereafter other Coast Guard units and civilian units arrived on scene to join in the search for the missing victim. Subsequently, Petty Officer BITNER was forced to return to the station, after an extended search, due to a dwindling fuel supply, an inoperative radio, and a cracked hull damaged by the force of the seas. Petty Officer BITNER demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger in this rescue mission.

When the distressed ship radioed for help, the ANDROSCOGGIN immediately responded. Upon arrival on the scene, communications with the LAMPSIS were established and the ANDRSCOGGIN stood by throughout the night. At first light, a damage control party was placed aboard to assist in saving the ship. All efforts were unavailing, however, and at dusk the damage control party returned to the ANDROSCOGGIN. At 8 the next morning, the crew of the LAMPSIS signaled for assistance in abandoning ship. BOGGS, designated coxswain of the motor surfboat, immediately made four trips to the LAMPSIS to remove survivors. Although a heavy 20-foot swell and the darkness made boat handling and embarkation of the survivors a hazardous operation, and the language barrier and anxiety of the survivors added to the difficulties, BOGGS persevered in his duties and in 51 minutes successfully removed all 30 survivors without injury. BOGGS displayed outstanding courage, skill, and initiative during this rescue. His unselfish actions, perseverance, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\nSeaman BORDEN is cited for heroism on the evening of 02 August 2021, while serving as a member of Station (small) Lorain during the perilous rescue of a man whose vehicle crashed adjacent to the Coast Guard Station. Following a sudden loss of power throughout the building, Seaman Borden immediately investigated the cause of the power outage and observed the car on fire next to the station. The vehicle departed the roadway, crashed through a fire hydrant, and came to rest atop an electrical transformer, energized with 7,000 volts. Seaman BORDEN sprinted toward the burning car to assess the situation. Inside the car, he found a single occupant in the driver's seat who was disoriented and incapable of exiting the burning vehicle. Unable to open the locked car, Seaman BORDEN located a nearby boulder and carried it 50 feet before heaving it through passenger side window to gain access to the vehicle. Joined by his fellow team member, the two deftly extracted the burning occupant from the vehicle, mere seconds before the car fully engulfed with intense fire. Together they carried the man away from the vehicle and extinguished the fire on his body with their shirts. Local EMS arrived and air lifted the individual who was in critical condition to a nearby hospital where he was treated for severe burns. SN BORDEN demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger.

Shortly before 1 o’clock in the morning, responding to a distress call from the sailing vessel GALE RUNNER, Station Quillayute River launched two rescue boats. The operator of GALE RUNNER reported that the vessel was dismasted, taking on water, and in danger of sinking, 2 miles south of the Quillayute River entrance. Seas of up to 25 feet, combined with high winds and driving rain, created a situation of imminent danger for the two people aboard the GALE RUNNER. Soon after crossing the treacherous bar in an attempt to reach the stricken sailboat, the motor lifeboat suddenly rolled over several times in the surf and confused seas. As a result of the repeated roll-overs, Petty Officer BOSLEY was forcibly separated from his rescue craft and thrown into the churning ocean. A Coast Guard HH-65 helicopter from Air Station Port Angeles was able to hoist to safety the two people from the GALE RUNNER as it crashed onto rocks. As a crew member of Coast Guard 44363, Petty Officer BOSLEY willingly entered extreme ocean storm conditions and sacrificed his life while attempting to save the lives of the two people from the GALE RUNNER.

On 11 and 12 November 1981 ALERT steamed through an intense storm to reach the sailing vessel HALCYON. The HALCYON had been beset by heavy seas and high winds while sailing 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina. By the time ALERT arrived the wind was over 50 knots and the seas were breaking at 30 feet. Despite these impossible conditions, Chief Petty Officer BRERETON volunteered to serve as coxswain of the small boat in an attempt to rescue the HALCYON’s sole occupant. After the RHI was launched, Chief Petty Officer BRERETON skillfully maneuvered the boat away from the side of ALERT while the cutter pitched and rolled perilously close to the tiny craft. Once clear of the cutter, Chief Petty Officer BRERETON exhibited exemplary seamanship in guiding the RHI to HALCYON. As he was lining up for his approach to the foundering sailboat, a huge sea capsized and sank HALCYON, throwing the occupant into the sea and nearly capsizing the RHI. Reacting immediately, Chief Petty Officer BRERETON maneuvered the RHI into position so that his two crewmen could pull the survivor to safety. He then guided the RHI back to the wildly tossing ALERT and positioned it to be hoisted onto the cutter. ALERT then proceeded to the scene of the sailing vessel OUR WAY. Arriving on the night of 12 November, in worse conditions than experienced at the HALCYON, Chief Petty Officer BRERETON again volunteered to serve as coxswain of the RHI. The RHI was again launched and Chief Petty Officer BRERETON maneuvered the boat away from ALERT to the side of the beset OUR WAY. Upon arrival, the lone occupant was found to be fatigued to near incoherence. Aside from the from the difficulties of operating in the heavy seas, Chief Petty Officer BRERETON and his crew had to convince the man to leave his boat. Once convinced, the man had to be physically assisted into the RHI. The RHI was returned to ALERT where it was hoisted to safety.

The woman had jumped from the 100-foot railing of the Clark Memorial Bridge and was in shock after submerging in the 38-degree water. Petty Officer BROCKMAN, who was in the vicinity attending a Reserve meeting, heard the woman’s cries for help, investigated, and sighted her in the water. Attempting to man a boat to go to her rescue and discovering that the boat was not operational, Petty Officer BROCKMAN immediately dived into the frigid waters of the rapid river current which was carrying the woman in the direction of the dam of the Ohio River. Fighting the treacherous current, he skillfully proceeded toward the victim and, upon reaching her, effected a lifesaving carry as she was completely helpless. By this time the swift current had carried Petty Officer BROCKMAN and the victim downstream to within 60 feet of the paddle wheel on the Belle of Louisville wharf boat. As he struggled toward the boat, he was thrown a life ring and was assisted aboard with the nearly drowned woman. The police arrived shortly thereafter and transported the victim to the hospital for medical treatment.

The truck driver had the truck in motion when he observed the Navy aircraft leave the runway and swerve into the building. Petty Officer BRUNKE responded to the crash and, upon arrival on scene, despite difficulties with the equipment and inaccessibility of the fire source, delivered foam on the fire from close range. Subsequently, when the foam supply was depleted, without regard for his own safety, he left the truck and entered the burning building to search for crew members of the aircraft. He courageously walked through burning fuel and approached a hole in the fuselage to search for survivors before being driven out by flames, extreme heat, and noxious/toxic fumes. Once outside, ignoring the very real threat of a catastrophic jet fuel explosion, Petty Officer BRUNKE took over as nozzleman on a 2-inch hose and led a crew into the burning structure in an attempt to reach the cockpit. Shortly after entering the building, when the hosemen were overcome by smoke, Petty Officer BRUNKE was left alone on a wildly swinging hose, struck in the neck by the whipping nozzle, and knocked over an upholstery table into the edge of the fire. He retreated from the area and was treated at the scene for a neck bruise, leg abrasions, and smoke inhalation. Only when the hose was under control and being utilized by a new crew did he permit himself to be taken to an aid station for treatment.

He assisted in evacuating the seriously injured employee to a safe area and administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in a vain effort to revive him. Upon arrival of medical personnel, Petty Officer BURRUS immediately returned to the blazing building to attempt to locate any other survivors, but his efforts to reenter the building were hindered by the tremendous heat and smoke of the raging fire. Undaunted, he took charge of a fire hose crew, moved to the front of the fire fighting activities, and aggressively directed a hose crew where fire-fighting efforts of his team contributed to controlling the blaze, thereby precluding a disastrous jet fuel explosion. Although physically exhausted and suffering from smoke inhalation, Petty Officer BURRUS remained on scene and subsequently located and identified one of the victims.

A rudder casualty made the vessel difficult to control in turbulent conditions, which included 20-foot seas and winds of more than 45 knots. With weather deteriorating and seas building to 25-feet and higher, the EZRA II was knocked down four or five times. After the sailboat was hit broadside by a wave, knocking out cabin windows and causing injury to the crew, the master and crew of four abandoned their vessel and entered their life raft. Helicopter 6549 arrived on scene with EDISTO and made preparations to approach the raft. During the helicopter's instrument-guided approach to a hover, sight and communications were lost. After immediate efforts to contact and locate the aircraft and its crew yielded no response, EDISTO maneuvered alongside the raft and was able to recover the crew of EZRA II. As the rescue swimmer aboard the helicopter, Petty Officer CAINES willingly encountered extreme ocean storm conditions and sacrificed his life while attempting to save the lives of five persons from the disable sailing vessel. Petty Officer CAINES demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger in this rescue. His courage and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citation: Hughes, Richard L.)\n\nDate of Action: 30 April 1967\n\nDate of Award: 17 August 1967\n\nFor heroism on the evening of April 30, 1967 while engaged in searching for two teen-age boys reportedly stranded at the Duluth Entry North Breakwater Light, Minnesota. Twin 16-year old boys and a brother had been seen running along the jetty challenging the 10 to 15-foot waves when witnesses observed a huge wave sweep one boy into the water. When two boys were reported stranded at the light, Petty Officer CALLAHAN and two comrades volunteered to attempt the rescue. Lashing themselves together, the three men proceeded, with hand lanterns as the only illumination, to the end of the breakwater. Despite the high waves, winds gusting to 40 knots, driving rain, and 36 degree water, the rescue party diligently searched the breakwater and light but found no trace of the boys. While returning to the beach a 20-foot wave swept the lead man off the jetty nearly causing the loss of all three men. Petty Officer CALLAHAN in attempting to retrieve his fellow Coastguardsman suffered a broken wrist and severe body bruises. In spite of excruciating pain, through sheer determination, Petty Officer CALLAHAN and his companion managed to pull their teammate onto the beach, where all efforts to revive him failed. Petty Officer CALLAHAN’s courage, unselfish actions, perseverance and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citations: Culberston, Edgar A. and Prei, Ronald C.)\n\nDate of Action: 10 May 2003\n\nDate of Award: 15 August 2003\n\nPetty Officer CARAWAN is cited for heroism during the rescue of an 80-year old woman from her completely submerged automobile in the Cape Fear River near Southport, NC, on the morning of 10 May 2003. As the woman attempted to park her car by a wharf, the brakes failed, causing the vehicle to plunge over the edge and into the water. The car immediately sank beneath the surface where she was trapped inside and unable to escape. Petty Officer CARAWAN and two other crewmembers had just departed an adjacent pier for a Homeland Security patrol when they heard a loud crash behind them. Just as they looked over their shoulders, a call came over the marine band radio notifying them of the incident. They immediately turned around and moored the small boat. Petty Officer CARAWAN and one other crewmember without the aid of additional rescue gear, quickly entered the water and created an ad hoc plan to extricate the woman from the vehicle. They made repeated free dives, courageously attempting to remove her from the car. After several unsuccessful attempts to open the car, they finally managed to force the driver's side door ajar. With zero visibility in the murky water, it was decided that it was too dangerous to swim into the car to unlatch the seat belt. Petty Officer CARAWAN then took a knife provided by an onlooker, dove back down, and cut the shoulder and lap belts freeing the woman who floated unconscious to the roof of the car. After several more dives, they finally pulled her out of the vehicle and to the surface. Petty Officer CARAWAN assisted his fellow crewmember as they towed her in a swimmers carry position to the pier where she was provided life saving first aid that eventually revived her. Petty Officer CARA WAN demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger during this rescue.

While searching along the beach for the survivors, Petty Officer CARROLL observed two of the victims in the surf approximately 100-yards off-shore. Recognizing the imminent danger to the two persons, Petty Officer CARROLL summoned help with his portable radio, and then dived into the frigid waters and began swimming towards the hapless victims. Upon reaching the two persons, Petty Officer CARROLL determined that the man was wearing a life jacket and in much better condition than the woman, who was holding on to a seat cushion. Swimming to the woman, Petty Officer CARROLL attempted to assist her into the rescue basket of a helicopter that had arrived on scene. During this unsuccessful attempt the woman lost her grip on the sea cushion. Immediately, Petty Officer CARROLL directed his efforts to keep the woman’s head above water, while simultaneously trying to maintain his own precarious position in the huge breakers.

Departing Coast Guard Air Station Port Angeles, Washington, the helicopter encountered a dense fog bank covering the entire water area enroute to the ditch site which required flying at altitudes as low as 10 feet and at very slow speeds. During this demanding flight, Petty Officer CAWLEY concentrated on both searching and on readying the after cabin by rigging the sea rescue platform and several rafts. After locating the wreckage, the helicopter was landed in the water and the rescue operation commenced. Realizing that, because of the distance, he would not be able to throw a line or a raft to the hapless victims, Petty Officer CAWLEY, without hesitation or regard for his personal safety, plunged into the frigid water and towed a raft to the partially submerged aircraft. As he was directing the first survivor into the raft, the wreckage settled further and capsized, striking the rotating blades of the helicopter and throwing the remaining survivors into the water. Petty Officer CAWLEY swam back to the helicopter, shouting instructions to restore calm. and helped the people onto the rescue platform. When all were apparently on board the helicopter, he then swam around the wreckage a last time to ensure that everyone had been rescued. This task completed, he returned to the helicopter and remained outside to allow the survivors the shelter and relative comfort of the cabin. The helicopter was then water taxied clear of the fog area and the people transferred to arriving surface craft for evacuation to safety.

Disregarding his own safety, he jumped into the turbulent water and swam out to assist one of the other swimmers struggling to keep the unconscious man afloat. While progressing toward shore, a large wave separated them and CHAMPION was left alone to handle the helpless man. However, further water turbulence caused him to lose his grip on the man who then sank beneath the surface of the water. Although he dived repeatedly in an attempt to find him, his efforts were unsuccessful, and he had to abandon his attempts and swim for his own safety to some nearby rocks which were being pounded by heavy surf and clung there precariously for approximately twenty-five minutes until rescued by a helicopter. CHAMPION demonstrated initiative and fortitude, in spite of constant and imminent personal danger during this attempted rescue. His unselfish actions and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\nDate of Action: 19 December 1982\n\nDate of Award: 16 May 1983\n\nPetty Officer CLUKEY is cited for heroism on the evening of 1 December 1982 when he assisted in the rescue of an unconscious man from a burning vehicle moments before it exploded.

While pushing a crane barge to service buoys in the river just north of Peoria, Illinois, crewmembers of Coast Guard Cutter SANGAMON spotted a man in the water in obvious trouble. As the cutter maneuvered to rescue him, a towboat with fifteen barges swiftly approached from upstream, unable to stop in the 44-knot river current, posing a great risk of collision with the SANGAMON and certain death for the person in the water. The man did not respond to shouts and verbal commands from the crew and he could not grasp a life ring thrown to him. He did manage to grab the end of a long pole but the swift current quickly turned him face down in the river. Recognizing the gravity and immediacy of the situation, with no time to don cold water protective clothing and survival equipment, Seaman Apprentice COPPENS took immediate and decisive action. Displaying heroic daring at the risk to his own life, he dove into the river and fought the heavy current to swim out to the man, turn him face up out of the water and drag him back to the cutter's barge. While the crew struggled to recover the man from the water, Seaman Apprentice COPPENS lost his grip and was pulled under the SANGAMON's barge, pummeled against the bottom and swept under water another 50 feet down river before surfacing. A small boat from the cutter picked up Seaman Apprentice COPPENS, who was suffering from a concussion and the onset of hypothermia from exposure, to the freezing water.

He was first on scene at a horrific accident, caused when a tractor trailer veered and struck two other tractor trailers on the side of the roadway igniting the fuel spilled from a ruptured tank. Demonstrating exceptional bravery he immediately approached a vehicle surrounded by fire and noticed a man engulfed in flames writhing around on the ground. Without hesitation or concern for his own safety, he entered into the flames and attempted to put the flames out with his own shirt. While retrieving a shirt from a bystander he fell and was soaked with diesel fuel. Disregarding the increased danger to himself he returned to the fire to continue extinguishing the burning victim. He ultimately extinguished the fire with a welding blanket provided by a bystander. Together they used the blanket to extract the victim to safety just seconds before the fuel tank exploded. The exploding fuel tank propelled a burning tire towards Lieutenant Commander CROSE and the victim, landing within feet of them. All other bystanders fled the scene while he bravely stayed with the victim and moved him further away from the inferno. Displaying superlative perseverance and fortitude, he remained with the conscious and severely injured driver until relieved by emergency responders.

On 11 and 12 November 1981 ALERT steamed through an intense storm to reach the sailing vessel HALCYON. The HALCYON had been beset by heavy seas and high winds while sailing 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina. By the time ALERT arrived the wind was over 50 knots and the seas were breaking at 30 feet. Despite these impossible conditions, Petty Officer DAVIS volunteered to serve as a crewman of the small boat in an attempt to rescue the HALCYON’s sole occupant. After the RHI was launched, Petty Officer DAVIS assisted the coxswain in locating HALCYON in the turbulent seas. As the RHI was lined up for its approach to the foundering sailboat, a huge sea capsized and sank HALCYON, throwing the occupant into the sea and nearly capsizing the RHI. Reacting immediately, the coxswain maneuvered the RHI into position so that Petty Officer DAVIS and the other crewman could pull the survivor to safety. As the coxswain positioned the RHI next to the wildly tossing ALERT, Petty Officer DAVIS helped secure the RHI alongside the cutter so it could be hoisted onto the cutter. ALERT then proceeded to the scene of the sailing vessel OUR WAY, arriving on the night of 12 November. Petty Officer DAVIS again volunteered to serve as crewman of the RHI. The RHI was again launched and maneuvered away from ALERT to the side of the best OUR WAY. Upon arrival, the lone occupant was found fatigued to near incoherence. Aside from the difficulties of operating in the heavy seas, Petty Officer DAVIS and the crew had to convince the man to leave his boat. Once convinced, the man had to be physically assisted into the RHI. The RHI was returned to ALERT where it was hoisted to safety. Petty Officer DAVIS demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude and daring in spite of imminent personal danger in this rescue. His unselfish action, courage and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citations: Brereton, Richard J. and McDougle, Cameron E.)\n\nDate of Action: 08 April 1966\n\nDate of Award: 09 June 1966\n\nFor heroic conduct on April 8, 1966 while serving on board the USCGC COOK INLET [WHEC-384] when he boarded the burning and abandoned Norwegian passenger vessel VIKING PRINCESS in search for 40 missing survivors. When advised of the disaster, the COOK INLET departed Guantanamo Bay to assist the Norwegian ship, afire in the vicinity of Windward Passage. Upon arrival, finding the ship burning violently and apparently abandoned, Lieutenant (Junior Grade) DAVIES promptly volunteered as member of a boarding party to search the vessel for survivors. Despite dense smoke and heat so intense that patches of paint on the outside were bursting into flame, he boarded and assisted in searching all accessible spaces above and below decks, including the infirmary area and crew quarters. The boarding party remained aboard the flaming hulk for more than 20 minutes, executing a vigorous search until ascertaining that there was practically no chance that any living survivor remained aboard the VIKING PRINCESS. Thereafter, when warned that the fire was advancing under them on the lower decks, the boarding party withdrew. Lieutenant (Junior Grade) DAVIES demonstrated initiative, fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger during the entire operation. His unselfish action, courage, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the Untied States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citations: Barnes, Robert S., Buechler, Albert C., Disnmore, Robertson P., and O’Keefe, William)\n\nDate of Action: 29 May 1974\n\nDate of Award: 04 November 1975\n\nSeaman DELZELL is cited for extraordinary heroism on the afternoon of 29 May 1974 while serving aboard CG-40461, a Coast Guard utility boat assigned to Coast Guard Group, New Orleans, when he rescued a 38-year old man from drowning in the treacherous currents of the Mississippi River at New Orleans, Louisiana. The utility boat had been directed to the scene in response to a call concerning an attempted suicide at the Hess Terminal. Upon arrival on scene, Seaman DELZELL observed a man in the water clinging to the barge with one hand and holding a knife with the other. Skillfully using a boat hook, Seaman DELZELL disarmed the man and then attempted to pull him into the utility boat. However, the man struggled frantically to escape, broke free, and disappeared beneath the surface of the water. Without hesitation, Seaman DELZELL immediately jumped into the treacherous currents of the Mississippi River in an attempt to locate the man and was instantly swept underneath the rake of the barge. In the turbulent waters beneath the barge, Seaman DELZELL finally located the victim and succeeded in bringing him to the surface. The man continued his struggle to escape and extricate himself from Seaman DELZELL’s grasp, but to no avail, as he was held fast until the CG-40461 was maneuvered alongside to provide assistance in the rescue. During the ensuring 30 minutes the crew of the CG-40461 worked diligently, encountering great difficulty due to the extremely emotional state of the victim, before they finally succeeded in subduing him and getting him aboard the utility boat. During the entire period, Seaman DELZELL managed to keep the struggling man afloat and his head out of the water. Seaman DELZELL demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent danger in this rescue mission. His unselfish action, and unwavering devotion to duty were instrumental in saving a life and reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\nDate of Action: 25 July 1964\n\nDate of Award: 30 September 1965\n\nFor heroism on July 25, 1964, while serving as coxswain of the CG-30460, when he assisted in the rescue of 15 survivors of the stranded fishing boat MARLIN, which was breaking up on the rocks of the Cape May Inlet West Jetty. DeMARCO, then a Seaman, was on Cape May Inlet Patrol when he observed the MARLIN drifting toward the rock jetty. After advising Cape May Station of the situation, he proceeded to the scene. Upon arrival, he found the MARLIN was stranded on the rocks and her occupants drifting helplessly in the rough waters. Despite high seas and strong winds DeMARCO skillfully maneuvered his boat close to the windward side of the jetty and, with the aid of crew member, rescued three persons who were in imminent danger of being thrown against the rocks. He then proceeded to the lee side of the jetty and rescued four more survivors. After all survivors had been recovered from the water and from the jetty, he followed another Coast Guard rescue boat to the dock with the survivors. DeMarco demonstrated initiative and fortitude, in spite of extreme personal danger, during the rescue. His courageous actions contributed to the saving of the lives of the survivors. DeMARCO’s unselfishness and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal citations: Bucci, Phillip R., Evans, Russell R., and Talbot, John P.)\n\nDate of Action: 24 November 2000\n\nDate of Award: 20 February 2001\n\nPetty Officer DENHAM is cited for extraordinary heroism on the evening of 24 November 2000 during the daring rescue of a woman from her burning mobile home. While on liberty on Thanksgiving night, Petty Officer DENHAM was in his yard when he noticed smoke and flames coming from his neighbor's home. Without hesitation, Petty Officer DENHAM told his wife to call the fire department as he rushed to the scene. He arrived within seconds and while assessing the situation, heard a dog whimpering from inside. Not knowing what was inside, Petty Officer DENHAM proceeded to kick in the door allowing the dog to escape. With the trailer engulfed in smoke, Petty Officer DENHAM disregarded his own safety to see if anyone was inside. He courageously wrapped his shirt around his face and crawled inside the home to look for survivors. As he made his way along the living room floor in almost zero visibility, he came across a woman on the couch. He immediately pulled her out of the home and administered first aid to the breathing, but incoherent woman until emergency services personnel arrived. Undaunted by his ordeal, Petty Officer DENHAM then began to fight the fire with a garden hose in a valiant effort to save the family's home. Petty Officer DENHAM demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude and daring in spite of imminent personal danger in this rescue. His courage and devotion to duty are most heartily commended and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.\n\nDate of Action: 03 July 1980\n\nDate of Award: 02 February 1981\n\nPetty Officer Dixon is cited for heroism on the afternoon of 3 July 1980 while serving as the coxswain of Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat (MLB) 44409. During this period he was instrumental in preventing the yacht FANTASY ISLE, with five people on board, from capsizing on the stormy Tillamook Bay entrance Bar. To escape the remains of Tropical Storm Celia, the owner/operator of FANTASY ISLE elected to seek shelter in Tillamook Bay, Oregon. Arriving outside the Bay in the late afternoon, the bar entrance was completely covered with breaking seas up to 30-feet in height. With the crew of FANTASY ISLE completely exhausted and seasick, the owner/operator believed he was in a “do-or-die” situation and informed Cost Guard Station Tillamook Bay that he was going to cross the bar. Two Coast Guard rescue boats were immediately dispatched to escort the yacht across the Bar. Arriving on scene two miles off-shore, Petty Officer DIXON placed his MLB behind FANTASY ISLE and took the first breaking wave broadside thereby taking the full force of the breaker before it could reach the yacht. Petty Officer DIXON continued this highly dangerous procedure, taking breaker after breaker, for the next 40 minutes until FANTASY ISLE was safely inside Tillamook Bay. Petty Officer DIXON demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger during this incident. His unselfish action, courage, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Related Coast Guard Medal Citation: Langlois, George R.)\n\nDate of Action: 25 March 1965\n\nDate of Award: 26 October 1965\n\nFor heroism on March 25, 1965 while serving aboard the CG-44324 when he assisted in the rescue of two persons from peril on Bodega Rock in Bodega Bay, California.

The men, who were the only survivors of a capsized outboard boat, had been washed onto the rock and were unable to help themselves due to shock and exposure. DIXON and another Coast Guardsman, dressed in wet suits, immediately jumped from the CG-44324 and swam 30 yards through heavy surf to Bodega Rock with lifejackets for the survivors. With the assistance of a civilian swimmer, DIXON then swam from Bodega Rock back to the CG-44324 towing the injured man on a rubber mattress. The man was then transferred to the USCGC CAPE HEDGE [WPB-95311]and subsequently to shore for medical treatment. DIXON demonstrated initiative, fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger during the entire operation. His unselfish actions, courage, and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(Note: Robert F.
