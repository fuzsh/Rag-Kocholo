He established an observation post close to the attacking infantry and maintained communications with artillery brigade headquarters continuously throughout the day under heavy fire, obtaining valuable informaton and supplying the artillery with numerous targets. At a critical moment he obtained reinforcements and ammunition for the infantry, and enabled them to repel a heavy counter-attack. Throughout the attack he maintained close touch with the outpost line, and was the sole link in the communications between battalion and brigade.\n\nLieutenant Francis Joseph Ainsborough MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. In company with another officer he went forward to keep in touch with the advancing line and brought back valuable information regarding the tactical situation. Once, finding themselves beyond our outposts and observing a hostile machine gun and crew, they rushed it, capturing the gun and three prisoners.\n\nCaptain George Griffith Aitken MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in keeping his guns in action when responding to an S.O.S. call, though a number of casualties were caused by shell fire and some of the guns were put out of action.\n\nBar to Military Cross – Circumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant Lionel John Baber Aitkens MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry in action.

On the same date near Haynecourt, he made a dangerous and difficult reconnaissance for a forward section. His conduct and ability have been most marked throughout the whole operation.\n\nLieutenant William Arthur Ives Anglin MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. During the advance this officer consistently submitted information secured under the most trying conditions. He made a personal reconnaissance over the whole divisional front, sending in the first accurate information of the location of the front line. This reconnaissance was made under heavy shell and machine gun fire.\n\nLieutenant Francis James Moffat Archibald MC\n\nOn the 21st May 1944, “E” Troop gun position midway between PONTE CORVO and ACQUINO about 3000 yards EAST, was being heavily shelled. After a hit on an ammunition dump the fire got out of control and as result brought down a very severe shelling. On the 21 May 1944 several shells landed at once, one burying Lieut. Archibald and one landing between two slit trenches killing three men mortally wounding a fourth and wounding four others. Lieut. Archibald dug himself out and despite the continuous shelling organized the evacuation of the wounded and personally pulled the ammunition from a burning trailer, preventing a further explosion and loss of life. He suffered severe burns but with a total disregard for his own safety, by his own efforts, his coolness and organization undoubtedly saved the lives of his men and enabled the guns to be fired despite the continuous shelling.\n\nLieutenant George Victor Atkins MC\n\nFor most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during the operation near Blewart on Oct. 1st 1918. With only nineteen men he went forward and captured his objective in magnificent style from a vastly superior enemy. His objective captured he consolidated and with the eleven men now left effectively took up a defensive position at Cuvillers and maintained his stand, inflicting casualties on the enemy. The same night he again distinguished himself by the manner in which he handled his relief. Throughout he set a splendid example to those under him.\n\nLieutenant TH Atkinson MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nCaptain John Cresswell Auld MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry. When his Observation Post was hit by a shell, which mortally wounded him severely and his telephonist mortally, he endeavoured to rescue the latter from the debris.

He then returned and helped to carry his telephonist to a place of safety.\n\nBar to Military Cross – For conspicuous gallantry in action. As observation officer he carried out his work under very heavy fire with great courage and determination. Later, although twice buried he stuck to his post and rendered most valuable information.\n\n2nd Bar to Military Cross – Circumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant Richard Henry Babbage MC\n\nOn Sept 2nd, 1918, when the infantry encountered a very stiff resistance at Dury village, he by his exceptional initiative and coolness, brought four guns into action through heavy shell fire, and made the success of the attack at this point possible. When coming into action, another officer and several other ranks were wounded, two teams of the leading gun being knocked out. He showed good judgement i clearing the casualties and getting this gun forward also. His example was an incentive to all ranks.\n\nFrank Charles Chamberlain Badgley MC\n\nFor conspicuos gallantry in action. As liaison officer he established and maintained communications under very heavy fire, displaying great courage and skill and sending back valuable reports.\n\nCaptain W Bagnall MC\n\nFor marked gallantry & initiative. On 1st Oct. 1918, during fighting in suburbs of Cambrai, our infantry were suffering severe casualties from enemy machine guns situated behind a railway embankment. He took forward one gun of his battery to within 500 yards of our posts, in order to enfilade this embankment. Under heavy fire he got the gun into action and succeeded in silencing the machine guns enabling our line to be slightly advanced.\n\nCaptain Clifford Roy Baker MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nMajor Loran Ellis Baker MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant FD Barager MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in command of a gun that was attached to a front line battalion. He got it up over rough ground into action in the open, and though exposed to shell and machine gun fire, put three hostile machine guns out of action. he fired over 100 rounds from this position and destroyed several other machine gun units. His handling of the in-close support of the infantry was worthy of the highest praise.\n\nCaptain Rupert Don Baugh MC\n\nOn the operation to capture BOULOGNE carried out by 3 Cdn Inf Div, 17-22 Sept., Captain Rupert Don Baugh was acting as a forward artillery observing officer attached to the Queen’s Own Rifles of Canada. Throughout the entire five days of the operation this officer continually established observation posts in advance of the leading element of the Queens Own Rifles and was responsible for directing accurate and effective fire on enemy strong points which were impeding the advance. In particular, on the afternoon of 20 Sep the advance of the Queens Own Rifles, and Regiment de la Chaudiere on their right was held up by small arms, LAA and 88mm fire from a very strong and well prepared enemy position. Captain Baugh volunteered to go forward alone on foot and establish an observation post in rear of this strong point with a view to destroying the enemy guns. He occupied the OP and remained there under constant enemy fire throughout the remaining hours of daylight. He was able to direct the fire of medium and field artillery which put out of action four 88 mm guns and two LAA guns. Before the position was attacked the following morning, he took command of a group of infantry Bren guns which he positioned in the vicinity of his OP. Throughout the subsequent attack he directed the fire of this group against the crews of the remaining enemy guns and by the effectiveness of this fire the attacking company of the Queens Own Rifles was able to reach its objective and capture the remaining guns. As a result of this particular action, the attack of FORT DE LA CRECHE, which ended the defence of the BOULOGNE garrison north of the river LIANE, was made the following morning without being subjected to any flanking fire. Throughout the whole operation the cool courage and initiative of Captain Baugh as exposed as he was to heavy fire in an OP, sited well forward of our own troops, had a very material influence on the success of the operation.\n\nLieutenant HC Beatty MC\n\nFor great gallantry and devotion to duty on the night of Oct. 29th 1918, near Maing. As officer in charge of an ammunition convoy he successfully got forward his ammunition to battle positions despite heavy shelling, causing casualties to men and horses. He showed great coolness and ability.\n\nLieutenant James Gordon Beatty MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He made a most thorough and succesful reconnaissance of a portion of the enemy line, which was to attacked on the following day. From his observation post he established and maintained communications with headquarters throughout the night, and during the attack sent back most valuable information. His energy and daring in the performance of his duty under heavy fire were of the utmost service in keeping the artillery informed of the situation at all times.\n\nCaptain Thomas Johnston Bell MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nCaptain AP Bennett MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty when commanding his battery in action. Although subjected to an intense bombardment of gas and other shell, by his unflagging energy he maintained the efficiency of his battery with only one Officer to help him, keeping up accurate and steady fire upon his targets and successfully dealing with every task that was assigned to him.\n\nLieutenant Richard Owen Greet Bennett MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion. During an intense bombardment five officers were buried in a dug-out. He took charge of volunteers, and under concentrated fire of heavy guns rescued three, only desisting on ascertaining that the other two officers were dead.\n\nLieutenant Harold Othneill Bennett MC\n\nMilitary Cross – Circumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nBar to Military Cross – For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He handled his trench mortars with the greatest skill, and was largel responsible for the success of the operations. He has at all time set a splendid example of courage and determination.\n\nCaptain Elie William Berthiaume MC\n\nCaptain Berthiaume served as a troop commander in “E” battery, 2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, which was in direct support of 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry. From early October 1951 to April 1952, Captain Berthiaume served almost continuously as a forward artillery observer. His duties have demanded that he remain for long periods with forward rifle companies. His technical ability in maintaining efficient communications and skill in directing artillery fire has always assured the maximum effectiveness of the supporting artillery throughout a number of both large and small engagements. Captain Berthiaume worked with a number of company commanders all of whom praised his willing cooperation, his sincerity, sense of duty, and above all his genuine understanding of infantry support requirements. On 23 October 1951 this officer served as forward observation officer in a company raid on Hill 156, a strongly defended position. In the initial phases of the operation, he rapidly adjusted the fire plan, switching fire to critical points of opposition thus contributing much to the success of the attack. In this phase he also directed tank fire against enemy strongpoints. When the company secured its objective, Captain Berthiaume remained for six hours in an exposed position under artillery, mortar, and small arms fire, while directing artillery into the enemy defences and protecting the company against counter attack. In the withdrawal, he moved with the last elements to leave the position, continually protecting the company with artillery fire. During the phase, a faulty smoke screen overtook these last elements and he was seen, with disregard for his own safety, to stop in the midst of the falling smoke candles and proceed to issue the necessary orders required to adjust the smoke screen. In the following months, the officer continued to maintain this high standard of efficiency in providing effective artillery support for our own fighting patrols, and in defence against enemy patrol action. Night after night and despite the cold and inclement weather, he personally manned his observation post so that he could provide instant support if required. This indication of his strong sense of responsibility and devotion to duty was spoken of time after time by the infantry company commanders with whom he worked. On the night 25/26 March, No.7 platoon “C” company 1st Battalion Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry was attacked in company strength under cover of an intense artillery and mortar bombardment. Throughout the night, while in an exposed observation post in the company area, Captain Berthiaume adjusted artillery fire and continued to relay valuable technicalinformation regarding the location of hostile guns and mortars. He repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire in order to observe and to take accurate bearings. Over two hundred shells fell in the area of his observation post yet never once did he fail in his duties. Captain Berthiaume’s strong sense of duty, his personal courage and technical ability, and his sympathetic understanding of infantry requirements has gained, for himself and his regiment, the utmost confidence of the infantry. His actions have been worthy of the best traditions of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery and the army.\n\nLieutenant Ralph Sanderson Billman MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry as Forward Observing Officer. He registered his guns from the front trenches under heavy shell fire and later volunteered to go forward again and check registration. He was twice buried by shell explosion, but continued his work.\n\nCaptain Edward Joseph Billo MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant Edward Alexander Bird MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nMajor Clarence Vivian Bishop MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nCaptain George Gideon Blackburn MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel George Goodetham Blackstock MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nCaptain Tom Bond MC ED\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nCaptain Frederick George Bond MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. As F.O.O. he, with Lt. McConkey, rendered most valuable service during the advance. When their lines were cut they continued to send back timely information by runner, showing initiative and great courage.\n\nMajor KH Bovill MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant Joseph Mcleod Boyer MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant WJ Bradshaw MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry in leading his small force against a greatly superior attacking force, holding the artillery position against overwhelming odds until reinforcements could be sent. The action of himself and those under hime was undoubtedly the primary factor in the repulse of the Bolshevik Forces.\n\nCaptain Charles (Charlie) Edward Brown MC\n\nOn 7 September 1944, Acting Captain Brown was a Forward Observation Officer with the Irish Regiment of Canada which was holding the ridge immediately east of Coriano. The battalion, and particularly the most forward companies, were under direct observation by the enemy holding Coriano Ridge and as a result was being heavily mortared and shelled.\n\nCaptain Brown, in order to gain the necessary observation to deal with the enemy mortars, occupied an observation post in a house fully exposed to enemy observation and fire. From here he began the task of locating and engaging these targets. During some particularly heavy shelling Captain Brown’s observation post was hit by shells several times and the house collapsed. This same shelling killed one other Forward Observation Officer in this area and wounded the battery commander. Realizing that he was the only artillery officer remaining to relieve the infantry of its mortaring and shelling, Captain Brown occupied another exposed house from which he could see and engage the enemy mortars. This second house was, however, soon engaged by the enemy and destroyed. Showing great courage and determination, Captain Brown, knowing that only from a house could he see the flash of enemy mortars behind the Coriano Ridge, occupied yet a third one. This house, too, was engaged by the enemy and although hit by shells many times, Captain Brown remained there and successfully stopped the enemy mortaring and the greater part of the shelling.\n\nThe determination and devotion to duty shown by Captain Brown undoubtedly saved the infantry in this position from many more casualties. His actions under these trying conditions are worthy of great praise.\n\nCaptain Harold Oswald Neville Brownfield MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty throughout two weeks of severe fighting. He invariably displayed the greatest courage and coolness in directing the care of the wounded under heavy high explosives and gas barrage. On one occasion he remained at O.P. all day under machine-gun fire, sending back valuable information, which enabled the battery to do great execution.\n\nMajor John Haydn Browning MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant John Adams Bruce MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. In spite of heavy hostile fire he continued to fight his gun, and succeeded in establishing communication at a critical time.\n\nCaptain Norman Bruce (Ike) Buchanan MC with 2 bars\n\nDuring the night of Feb. 22, 1943, this officer continually tried to rally the infantry who came streaming back through the battery position. He himself picketed the heights and took out patrols. He brought in one six-pounder anti-tank gun and rallied some anti-tank gunners to man it. Throughout the next day he manned a local observation post, firing the guns and shouting encouragement continually. When he could not knock out an observation post with the guns, he tried sniping them himself from his position. His example throughout was a source of inspiration to all his men.\n\nBar to Military Cross – On 7 October 1943, while serving in Sicily and Italy as Troop Commander, “F” Troop, 1st Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, 1st Canadian Division, he was awarded a bar to his Military Cross at Gambatesa, Italy. As a Forward Observation Officer with the Carleton and York Regiment, Ike commanded the leading troop of the forward battery. Despite sustaining injuries while under heavy machine gun fire, he maintained vital communication with his battery, ensuring persistent artillery fire and enabling his troop to hold their ground and evacuate wounded personnel.\n\nSecond Bar to Military Cross – With 14th Field Regiment, 3rd Canadian Division for the D-Day invasion of France in June 1944, Ike was awarded a second bar to his MC for actions in Normandy in the first few days of the invasion. Operating as FOO with a reserve company of the Queen’s Own Rifles of Canada, Ike again demonstrated “coolness, drive and utter disrespect for his own safety as an example to all…”, holding an OP for four days while he engaged the enemy with artillery and heavy small arms fire.\n\nInformation provided by RMC website\n\nLieutenant NV Buchanan MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty when acting as a F.O.O. for his battery. He maintained his position in a forward sap continuously under heavy fire of every description, on several occasions having to go out into the open under fire to repair his line. He furnished very valuable and constant information to his battery, and was able to bring effective fire to bear upon the enemy when they came forwrad to reoccupy trenches which had been cleared by our raiding parties. His great coolness, courage and resouce contributed very largely to the success of our operations.\n\nCaptain William Rolland Buchner MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nCaptain Hugh Burnett MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant LF Burrows MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty as F.O.O. He established communication from the captured position with great rapidity. Though his line was continually cut he kept a continual flow of valuable information. Though wounded, he remained at his post, and in addition to his duties he assisted in repelling two counter-attacks with his revolver.\n\nCaptain Christopher Robinson Burton MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant AF Cagney MC MM with Bar\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty near Mont Gribus, south of Mons, on 10th Nov. 1918. He was on patrol charged with the duty of reconnoitring the front and flanks of country dominated by enemy observation and swept by machine gun fire, performing what at times seemed an impossible task wit the greatest disregard to danger, and enabling the artillery to advance boldly, and take up fresh positions.\n\nCaptain Douglas Samuel Caldwell MC\n\nCaptain Caldwell has been an Artillery Observation Post Officer throughout the past six months in the Korean theatre. During that period of time he has shown himself to be a diligent and courageous officer. He has, with unbounded energy and enthusiasm, organized and maintained an efficient artillery observation post. Under extremely heavy shellfire, this officer was a fine example to his men. Through long hours and tedious watches his one aim has been to supply the infantry with artillery support. This he has done no matter how trying the circumstances. His conduct in battle is a credit to the corps to which he belongs. During the course of the preliminary bombardment before the attack on a hill known as 355, the observation post manned by Captain Caldwell was hit no less than seven times in one morning and so badly damaged that it was necessary, at one time, to evacuate through the observation slit. Led by this officer, the observation post crew returned with picks and shovels and cleared their position for immediate re-occupation. Despite the obvious fact that this observation post was only too well known to the enemy, Captain Caldwell, knowing its paramount importance in the battle that was obviously coming, continued to operate from it and pass information of the greatest value.\n\nCaptain William Hopkins Quirk Cameron MC\n\nWhile serving in Northwest Europe with the 14th Field Regiment, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, as a FOO with the North Nova Scotia Highlanders, the North Novas were putting in an attack on a hill near Balberger Wald, West of the Rhine, on March 6th, 1945. The enemy commanded all approaches to the hill and the advancing company was met by heavy machine gun fire. Because the enemy had been known to have planted anti-tank and Schu mines over the area in front of the hill and over the area to be traversed by Captain Cameron, he and his wireless operator left their carrier and advanced on foot to a building from where the enemy could be observed. Captain Cameron remained outside, but was soon badly hit, and while bleeding severely both internally and externally and having lost his power of speech, he controlled supporting fire by writing his fire orders and passing them to his operator inside the building. The North Novas achieved their objective. For this remarkable concentration on his duty to the infantry he was supporting, but with complete disregard for his won safety, Captain Cameron was awarded the Military Cross.\n\nAs told by Honorary Colonel Graham Blyth, 1 Nov 1982\n\nLieutenant John James Campbell MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during five days operations. Though the shelling was almost continuous, and the casualties heavy, he steadied the men, who were badly shaken, and did much to avert further casualties. When he was returning at night from the outposts with two signallers, a shell killed one of them and badly wounded the other. He carried this wounded man on his back for nearly a mile, through a shell swept area over difficult country in the dark.\n\nLieutenant Andrew Gordon Cardy MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant EK Carmichael MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry in action. He went forward under heavy fire to ascertain the situation, and brought back most valuable information.\n\nCaptain Allan (Al) Digby Carpenter MC\n\nOn the 17th October 1943 Lt. Carpenter was attached to the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment as a Forward Observation Officer during the first assault on the enemy position of SAN STEFANO. In the course of the engagement, Number 13 Platoon suffered heavy casualties. Lieutenant Carpenter, unable to observe from his Observation Post, went forward to a point within 80 yards of the enemy positions. Here, under enemy small arms fire at short range, he observed the enemy posts and succeeded in bringing down accurate artillery fire on the positions. This Officer’s determination, coolness and skill contributed greatly to the subsequent successful re-engagement and capture of the enemy positions, thereby enabling the Platoon to continue its advance.\n\nMajor Robert Lindsay Challoner MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nCaptain Hervey Barnet Carswell MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nCaptain Thomas LeMesurier Carter MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant George Herbert Cartwright MC\n\nOn 2nd September, 1918, near Upton Wood, he led his battery through a heavy barrage in close support of the infantry with great skill and leadership. His dash and courage under shell fire steadied his men and enabled his battery to support the advance of the infantry on termination of the rolling barrage.\n\nLieutenant Gordon Thomas Cassells MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and good work during operations. He carried out reconnaissances very capably and distinguished himslf as F.O.O. One night he brought a section into action under very diffult conditions.\n\nLieutenant SB Cayford MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant LP Chapman MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in the attack on Valenciennes. On the morning of 1st Nov. 1918, while the battery was subjected to heavy shelling in an exposed position he walked backwards and forward supervising the firing. When a direct hit was secured on one of his guns, killing and wounding all the detachment he assisted in dressing the wounded and removing the dead. It was through his magnificent example that the men remained steady throughout.\n\nLieutenant AE Chatwin MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty at Valenciennes on 2nd, Nov. 1918, when in command of a forward section of his battery. he entered the city with the infantry scouts, crossing the canal under fire, bringing his battery into action in close support of the infantry, who were advancing. His courage, energy and initiave in keeping down hostile machine-gun fire made possible the advance of the line later.\n\nLieutenant Henry Bruce Chown MC\n\nAwarded the Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty as F.O.O. He went forward with the first wave of an attack and continued to send back most accurate and valuable information and instruction to his Battery for 15 hours at a stretch, which enabled hostile artillery to be very effectively dealt with. He displayed great coolness and skill as well as remarkable powers of endurance.\n\nMajor Joseph Gordon Chutter MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on the night of 5th Nov. 1918, at Valenciennes. He started out from Bde Hqrs with a party of signallers, four lorries & wire to establish forward communication. Enroute all four lorries had to be left, three being ditched and one being shelled. He then proceeded on foot under fire four kilometres and gave the forward sections of two batteries and two heavy batteries their operations orders for the morning. Through his initiative the four units were able to support the infantry in the morning attack.\n\nLieutenant Walter Findlay Clarke MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty as forward observation officer. He crawled out in front of an advanced post to observe our attacks, and sent in accurate information of their progress. Though under heavy fire he maintained his position all day.\n\nLieutenant Joseph Badenoch Clearihue MC ED\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty at Valenciennes on 1st Nov 1918, as liaison officer with the attacking battalion. Throughout the operation and the succeeding days he directed the firing on many strong points and machine gun posts, which were holding up the infantry, sent back reports of great tactical value, and although frequently under very heavy fire, showed the greatest courage and determination in carrying out his duties.\n\nCaptain Charles Harold Clerkson MC\n\nThe nature of the ground precluded suitable OP positions within the South Alberta Regiment area. Captain Clerkson, with complete disregard for his own safety and under constant shell and sniper fire, moved his OP from vantage point to vantage point in front of the area held by our own troops, effectively controlling the fire of his regiment. His gallant action was instrumental in repelling several attempts by the enemy to break out of the pocket. His energy, courage, and persistence were of the highest order.\n\nLieutenant Charles Harold Conquest MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nCaptain Richard Milton Cornelius MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant Arthur Justin Cowan MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during three days operations under heavy fire. Hearing that one of the guns of the battery had been hit, and that the No, 1. Could not be found, he ran up the road through an intense barrage. He found a sergeant lying wounded, and brought him back unaided, to a place of safety.\n\nLieutenant Charles Stuart Craig MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry, resource and ability on many occasions – especially on June 15th 1915 at Givenchy, when, he used an 18 pounder gun on trenches with great effect – destroying 40 yards of enemy parapet, 2 of their machine guns and 75 yards of wire entanglement. He was seriously wounded on this date after he had completed his task and was twice wounded on previous occasions.\n\nLieutenant Walter Creasy MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry in action, As F.O.O., he established and maintained communications under very heavy fire, displaying great courage and ability.

During the advance of 27th Sept. 1918, Near Inchy, he made a reconnaissance of passages over the Canal du Nord under heavy shell fire. He then took a column of wagons forward and established an A.R.P. 1,000 yards east of the Canal du Nord, which was heavily shelled at the time, from which point he kept up the supply of ammunition during the critical period of the advance.\n\nCaptain Andrew Sidney Dawes MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty as F.O.O. during an attack. When the attack went forward he found it impossible to observe or to keep his line working. He therefore went forward with the Infantry attack and was able to send back valuable information throughout the day across a continually shelled area. He displayed great coolness, courage and initiative, and his work was of the utmost value.\n\nLieutenant Irvin Harrison Dawson MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty as forward observation officer during an attack.

He displayed great courage and skill in establishing and maintaining communication under very heavy fire, thereby materially assisting in the success of the operations.\n\nCaptain John (Jack) Edward de Hart MC\n\nCaptain de Hart during his service with 81st Canadian Field Regiment Royal Canadian Artillery (RCA) and while attached to 1st Regiment Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (1RCHA) has successfully manned exposed Artillery Observation Post for long periods and frequently under intensive enemy fire and at all times providing the Infantry with support to their satisfaction. During the period 16 to 28 March 1953, a Company of the Royal Netherlands Battalion, 2 United States Division which he was supporting was occupying a position known as “NUDAE” and became subjected to heavy chinese attacks, preceded by intense bombardments. The main enemy efforts were made during the night 16/17 March and 28/29 March 1953. Throughout this time Captain de Hart occupied an Artillery Observation Post and directed artillery in support of the Royal Netherlands Battalion. During the event, the company occupying “NUDAE” was relieved by another company of the Royal Netherlands Battalion, but Captain de Hart remained as the Artillery representative throughout the period. On the night 16/17 March 1953, at 2215 hours, fifty to sixty enemy attacked and again at 0200 hours a further fifty to sixty enemy launched another attack. In neither case did they penetrate our defences. Our own casualties were light, whereas enemy casualties caused by Artillery Fire directed by Captain de Hart were heavy. On the night of 17/18 March 1953, at 0200 hours, a large ambush inflicted heavy casualties on our own troops. The position was heavily shelled and mortared and the Company Commander was killed. Again, in spite of the enemy shelling, Captain de Hart directed Artillery Fire with outstanding success. On the night 28/29 March 1953, at 2200 hours an intense enemy bombardment commenced and at 2230 hours an attack by two or three hundred enemy was launched. For one-half hour the only communications were those of the artillery, which were maintained in spite of two direct hits on the Observation post. Captain de Hart coolly directed Artillery Fire, and the attack was driven off with enemy casualties officially estimated as fifty killed and seventy-five wounded.\n\nDuring this entire period several hundred rounds of enemy fire fell daily on the “NUDAE” feature. During the intense bombardment prior to the attacks and during the attacks themselves, Captain de Hart directed Artillery Fire, maintained communications and passed information with such steadiness and with such disregard for his personal safety that he made a magnificent contribution in the successful defence of the position. His conduct in these trying circumstances, and in the light of language difficulties, was an inspiration to all those intimately concerned with the battles.\n\nCaptain Donald Mackay Deacon MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nCaptain Reginald Hyland Dean MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and initiative. Being unable to obtain ammunition for his trench mortars to advance in close support, he left his own guns, and leading his men forward with our infantry, he manned the enemy guns as they were captured. He was able to fire some 500 rounds on the retreating enemy from their own 5.9’ and 77 m.m. guns and very greatly assisted our advance. His prompt decision and spirit of practical expediency were productive of most excellent results.\n\nLieutenant Ingvar Edward deSherbinin MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. When the position occupied by the two trench mortars of which he was in command was heavily shelled by the enemy, he displayed great gallantry, moving through the barrage from one mortar to another in the open, controlling the fire, and encouraging the men. Although wounded in the arm and legs, he gallantly continued to fight his mortars with coolness and skill until one of them was put out of action and he himself exhausted by his wounds, was taken under cover.\n\nLieutenant Harry Robertson Dillon MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry during operations. He rescued a wounded officer from close to the enemy’s wire.

Later, when engaging the position at V.P.445 and the enemy train in rear of it, he got his gun into action under rifle fire with great coolness, inflicting many casualties o the safety to his men.\n\nCaptain Russel (Rud) Joseph Everett MC\n\nOn 12 Aug 44 Lt RJ Everett was acting as an AGRA representative with the Polish Armd Div on an armoured recce Southeast of ST SYLVAN. Communication difficulties necessitated taking his carrier along with the tanks. Due to this Lt Everett had to climb alternatively between the tank and the carrier in order to pass fire orders. In spite of this and the fact that they were under heavy shell and mortar fire he carried out his task to completion. Lt Everett by his actions showed courage and fortitude under most difficult circumstances. Throughout the campaign in North West Europe his officer has shown marked initiative and aggressiveness. He has shown himself to be an unusually capable officer and has made a contribution to the success of his unit over and above that which might normally be expected.\n\nLieutenant Russell Joseph Everett MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant Jack Hall Alliger Lee Fairweather MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.

Forbes acted as forward observation officer with “”B”” company Algonquin Regiment. This company supported by tanks had captured a cross roads of considerable importance southeast of the town and was ordered to hold this position though cut off from the rest of the battalion. Early in the morning the enemy counter-attacked this position. The company commander was wounded and evacuated leaving Captain Forbes the senior officer present with one subaltern of the company and the subaltern of the tank troop. Captain Forbes immediately took command of the force. With no regard for his own safety, Captain Forbes, during repeated counter-attacks which were supported by heavy fire, throughout the day left his tank and moved about the position, liasing with the two officers, organizing the defence , and encouraging the men by his visits and personal direction. By personal liaison and use of his artillery communications he passed vital information and implemented the battalion commanders plan. This was in addition to his normal duties as forward observation officer. He continued to direct artillery fire which was responsible for breaking up the successive enemy counter-attacks. Capt. Forbes held the position all day until flanking attacks by other troops rendered the ground valueless to the enemy who ceased his attacks and withdrew during the night. The continued defence of the position, essential to the later capture of Bergen Op Zoom was due almost entirely to Capt. Forbes initiative in assuming responsibility, determination and coolness under fire, and indifference to his own danger.\n\nLieutenant Adrian Tidmarsh Forsythe MC\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty as forward observation officer during an attack.

On 28 October at 0500 hours The North Shore Regiment with two companies up attacked the small hamlet of MAROLLEPUT. Captain Hogg was moving with “A” Company which was the right forward company. After a short sharp fight “A” company reached its objective but was pinned down by heavy enemy fire emanating from a 75 mm gun and a light AA gun in the vicinity of a house about 300 yards distant, and by small arms fire from a nearby dyke. This enemy fire was preventing consolidation of the position by “A” company and the area was rapidly becoming untenable. Under heavy observed enemy small Arms fire and with complete disregard for his own personal safety Captain Hogg, accompanied by his signaller, worked his way forward to a house from which he obtained observation over the two enemy guns. He was directing fire on the guns from an upstairs window when a shell from the AA gun penetrated the room and wounded him in the legs. However he continued to direct fire until a second shell from the 75 mm gun scored a direct hit and blew him out of the house, at the same time wounding his signaller. Although badly bruised and shaken he succeeded in re-entering the house and extricating his wounded signaller from the rubble. During this operation a third 75 mm shell hit the house and it was ultimately necessary to knock a hole in the wall to gain entrance. After assisting his signaller to safety Captain Hogg again made his way forward to a dyke overlooking the enemy guns which were still active. In spite of his wounds and constant enemy small arms fire Captain Hogg directed the fire of the artillery at his disposal onto the enemy guns until they were put out of action. “A” Company was then able to mop up the enemy snipers and consolidate the position. The gallant conduct and persistent efforts of Captain Hogg were undoubtedly responsible to a great extent for the success of the entire Battalion operation, since the capture of the company objective was vital to the successful advance of the other companies.\n\nWarrant Officer Class 2 Harold Holberton MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant Richard Hale Honeyford MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant John Christopher Hooke MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant James Parker Hooper MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nLieutenant Arthur Ernest Hopper MC\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nRegimental Sergeant Major Charles James Houghton MC\n\nFor conspicuous and consistent good work in connection with the parks of the Canadian Forces.\n\nMajor Gerald (Gerry) Henry Howitt MC\n\nThis officer, during his six-month’s extension of service in Korea, has manned for long periods the most exposed artillery observation post in the Brigade area.

During the period, with only infrequent reliefs, he has provided the infantry with support to their complete satisfaction. During the course of the prolonged and wearing bombardment of a hill known as 159, Captain Howitt, at his own request, remained at his observation post while company after company rotated through this most exposed position of the divisional front.
