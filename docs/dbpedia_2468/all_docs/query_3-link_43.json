        "text": "My artwork is reflective of the people and places I travel to and work with. As a former elementary school teacher and now as a Family Lawyer I have an opportunity to meet people in varying levels of conflict and turmoil within the legal systems of Family, Juvenile, and sometimes Criminal law. I see first hand the heightened emotions of families in turmoil and or transition and I try to capture the real-life emotions in my paintings. I am fortunate to have nearly 50 paintings in several county court houses that are viewed by thousands of families each year as they enter into and negotiate through the specific legal system they are in.\n\nArtist Bio\n\nG.W. Leach began painting in 1994 after having found himself recovery from a serious bicycle accident in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAs self-taught an Artist, George finds creative material among the people he observes and interacts with in his social life and his past and present professional life as a former elementary school teacher and as an Ohio attorney."
