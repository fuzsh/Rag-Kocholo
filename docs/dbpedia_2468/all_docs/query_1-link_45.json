Edward Maitland Maitland, R.N.A.S. In recognition of valuable and gallant work in connection with airships and parachutes. He has carried out experiments at his own personal risk, and has made some descents under enemy fire.\n\nSqdrn. Cdr. Charles Henry Butler, D.S.C., R.N.A.S. In recognition of his gallantry on the 5th June, 1917, when he fought single-handed two engagements with a number of powerful hostile machines. He attacked six hostile aeroplanes together over the Thames Estuary, and later attacked two off Ostend. On each occasion the machine selected for attack was compelled to dive.\n\nFlt. Lieut. Basil Deacon Hobbs, D.S.C., R.N.A.S.\n\nThe KING (is) pleased to approve of the award of the Distinguished Service Cross to the undermentioned Officers:\n\nFlt. Cdr. John Callaghan Brooke, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his services in the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron during the period 1st April 1916-31st March 1917. During this time he took part in several valuable reconnaissances and bombing flights, obtaining important information, and doing considerable damage to enemy organisations.\n\nFlt. Cdr. Thomas Francis Netterville Gerrard, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his services during an air fight on the 4th June, 1917. This officer led his flight against 15-20 hostile aeroplanes, and alone had ten engagements with these machines. He attacked one, and fired sixty rounds into its cockpit at point-blank range, the enemy machine rolling over and over for 3,000 feet, and then falling vertically out of control. He then attacked another enemy machine which had dived on to one of our machines from behind, and with the help of a Scout he shot it down, the enemy being seen to crash to the ground. Another hostile scout was then attacked by pilot, end-on, and received a long burst at very close range, the enemy going down in a spin, but apparently righting himself lower down. During this last encounter Flt. Cdr. Gerrard's machine was riddled with bullets, but, by fine piloting, he landed safely, although all but his lateral controls were shot away and his machine damaged to such an extent as to require return to Depot for complete rebuilding. This officer has now destroyed at least seven hostile aircraft. He was on active service in France and Belgium from April to September, 1916, and during that period performed much valuable work.\n\nFlt. Cdr. Reginald Frederick Stuart Leslie, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his gallantry in pursuing hostile raiding aeroplanes out to sea in a land machine on the 25th May, 1917. He attacked one hostile aeroplane, and caused it to descend in a steep nose dive, emitting smoke and steam. He was unable to observe its fate, as he was himself immediately attacked from behind by two other hostile machines and temporarily lost control. When he regained control, the machine which he had first attacked had disappeared, and two others were proceeding eastwards at a considerable height above him. He then returned safely to his aerodrome.\n\nFlt. Lieut. Guy Duncan Smith, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his services in the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron during the period 1st April, 1916-31st March, 1917.

Pooley, Chief Motor Mechanic, M.B. 1627.\n\nHerbert Powley, Deckhand, S.D. 1193.\n\nThe following is the account of the services in respect of which the Decoration has been conferred:\n\nOn the 22nd April, 1917, a violent explosion occurred on board H.M. Motor Launch 431 while she was lying alongside the jetty at the Base. The after part of the vessel was wrecked, and it at once became known that Sub-Lieutenant Charles W. Nash, R.N.V.R., was buried beneath the wreckage. Chief Motor Mechanic Pooley and Deckhand Powley, who were on board their own vessel lying at the jetty some fifty yards astern, immediately hurried to the motor launch, which was by that time burning fiercely. The flames were every instant drawing nearer to the spot where Sub-Lieutenant Nash lay buried, and it was clear that there was imminent danger of the after petrol tanks exploding at any moment. Regardless of the fact that this would mean certain death to them, Powley and Pooley jumped on board the vessel and succeeded in extricating Sub-Lieutenant Nash from beneath the wreckage and carrying him to the jetty. As they were leaving the boat the whole of the after part burst into flames, and, in all probability, had they been delayed for another thirty seconds all three would have perished. Deckhand Powley, who led the way on board the burning motor launch, had subsequently to be sent to hospital suffering from the effects of fumes.\n\nArtificer Engineer (now Acting Mate (E)) Edmund John Pysden, R.N. The following is the account of the services in respect of which the Decoration has been conferred:\n\nOn the morning of the 27th February, 1917, one of the auxiliary stop valves in one of H.M. Ships accidentally burst, the boiler room immediately becoming filled with dense steam. In spite of the danger of burning and suffocation from steam, and of the fact that it was impossible to draw fires or at once to lift the safety valves, which rendered the possibility of a second and even worse accident highly probable, Mr. Edmund John Pysden, Artificer Engineer, R.N., made several gallant attempts to enter the stokehold, and succeeded in bringing out two men who were lying insensible on the stokehold plates, and helped to bring out others. Several of the survivors would undoubtedly have lost their lives but for the rescues effected by this officer and others. Mr. Pysden also eventually succeeded in opening the safety valve, which relieved the immediate danger of a further accident. Although he had a wet rag tied over his mouth, he swallowed a considerable quantity of live steam, and was partially incapacitated by its effects. Notwithstanding the gallant efforts of Mr. Pysden and other members of the ship's company, three men lost their lives owing to the accident and nine were seriously injured.\n\n30273 - 7 SEPTEMBER 1917\n\nBoard of Trade, Whitehall Gardens, 7th September, 1917.\n\nThe KING (is) pleased to confer the Decoration of the Albert Medal upon\n\nMr. James Campbell Hurry, master of the steamship \" Earl of Forfar,\" of Glasgow. The following is an account of the services in respect of which the Decoration has been conferred:\n\nOn the 8th November, 1916, while the Steamship \"Earl of Forfar,\" of Glasgow, was lying at Archangel, a fire broke out on a Russian steamship and spread to the \"Earl of Forfar,\" which was lying immediately ahead. Captain Hurry, who was on shore, attempted to return to his vessel, but he was unable to do so. He proceeded, however, to render assistance to other vessels which were in danger of being burnt. While doing so, he heard voices coming from his own ship, which was burning and exploding furiously. Calling for volunteers, he led them on board his steamer, and seven injured men were rescued, some of whom he personally carried to a tug. While thus engaged considerable risk was incurred by Captain Hurry, who had to lift several live shells from the deck of the vessel in order to get at the wounded. Within ten minutes of the last man being rescued the deck blew up.\n\nMr. Edgar Twidle, master, and Mr. William Francis Gordon Martin, chief officer, of the steamship \"Bayropea,\" of London, and Mr. Robert MacBryde, Admiralty clerk, temporarily employed as Commodore's Secretary. The following is an account of the services in respect of which the Decoration has been conferred:\n\nOn the 26th January, 1917, a series of fires and explosions occurred at Economia, port of Archangel. When Captain Twidle arrived on the scene his ship was burning fiercely. On being informed that the Chief Engineer was alive, Captain. Twidle climbed on board but found that he was dead. He then examined the other rooms and found a Chinese sailor in a dazed condition. With the assistance of Mr. Martin and Mr. MacBryde this man was got over the ship's side across the ice, and eventually to the Red Cross station. About four minutes after the seaman had been removed the vessel blew up.\n\nJohn David Bulmer, boatswain of the steamship \"Rhydwen,\" of Cardiff, and Private John Edward Brown, R.M.L.I. The following is an account of the services in respect of which the Decoration has been conferred:\n\nOn the 31st January, 1917, while the steamship \"Rhydwen,\" of Cardiff, was lying at Genoa, a fire broke out in the ship's magazine. A fire signal was immediately hoisted, but, before assistance arrived Bulmer and Brown went below, unlocked the door of the magazine and got the hose at the seat of the fire. Water was then played on the magazine and the ammunition was taken out on deck, and, owing to the prompt action of the ship's crew, the fire was extinguished. Considerable risk was incurred by Bulmer and Brown in rendering the service.\n\n________\n\nAdmiralty, 4th September, 1917.\n\nThe KING (is) pleased to confer the Royal Naval Reserve Decoration upon the following Officers:\n\nComdr.
