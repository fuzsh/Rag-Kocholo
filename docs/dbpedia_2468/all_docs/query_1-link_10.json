On 12 August 1943, in the vicinity of Randazzo, Sicily, when Company L became pinned down by heavy enemy artillery fire while attacking its objective, it was imperative that such information be sent to the Battalion Command Post. All means of communication were out but foot messenger and Private Galey volunteered to deliver the message to the Battalion Command Post. Setting forth under hostile artillery fire and with complete disregard for his personal safety, he was wounded by this shellfire but continued on until he delivered the information to the designated officer.

Having been instructed as to the importance of the message, Staff Sergeant Gallagher, courageously, with odds six-to-one against him, fought it out with the enemy, killing two and forcing the remaining four to retreat. He delivered the message in time for his company to withdraw to a defensive position which prevented a possible breakthrough by the enemy.

Although intense enemy fire compelled members of a rocket-gun team to abandon their positions in defense of a road block, Staff Sergeant Galvan manned the weapon and engaged an approaching hostile truck loaded with troops. Remaining at an exposed vantage point and completely ignoring personal safety, he destroyed the enemy vehicle with a single rocket shell and repulsed a series of attacks upon the road barrier.

When the combat patrol of which he was a member was halted by machine gun fire from an emplacement in a concrete building supported by other enemy emplacements in its background, Sergeant Ganeko advanced alone to destroy the machine gun nest from a closer position. Although aware of the fact that the gun was supported by another machine gun, four machine pistols and about six snipers on its flank less than 100 yards away, he proceeded to crawl over open ground towards the gun. Within 15 yards of the building he pulled the pin from a hand grenade and prepared to throw when a sniper's bullet mortally wounded him. Unable to throw the grenade, but aware of the fact that the grenade endangered the men around him, he called out, \"Hey! Somebody get the grenade from me, I'm shot!\" Although dying from the wound he managed to hold down the handle until a comrade reached him and relieved him of the grenade. The outstanding courage and disregard for personal safety of Sergeant Ganeko is worthy of the highest praise and a credit to the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nHeadquarters, 34th Infantry Division, General Orders No. 82 (August 22, 1944)\n\nBorn: January 15, 1925 at Kapaa, Kauai, Hawaii\n\nHome Town: Kapaa, Kauai, Hawaii\n\nGARRY, WILLIAM J.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to First Lieutenant (Infantry) William J. Garry (ASN: 0-1298693), United States Army, for gallantry in action on 21 September 1944, at ****, Holland. First Lieutenant Garry, Executive Officer, Company H, 3d Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82d Airborne Division, led a combat patrol from **** to **** on the Dutch-German frontier. His mission was to determine the strength of enemy forces known to be in positions around ****. The patrol encountered strong German resistance in this vicinity, but fought its way almost to the town. Having accomplished his mission, First Lieutenant Garry began to withdraw his patrol. Determined counterattacks by maneuvering groups attempted to block the withdrawal. At one point the patrol was completely encircled, but First Lieutenant Garry directed a sudden thrust which broke through and the enemy gave pursuit. First Lieutenant Garry fell to the rear of his escaping group and covered their withdrawal with a brisk rear guard action. He successfully delayed the attacking enemy until the patrol had opportunity to move away. He began to fall back continually engaging the Germans and delaying their attacks. When it became evident that the patrol would make good its escape, the enemy caused pursuit and concentrated mortars within the area. By his determined effort First Lieutenant Garry was able to penetrate a well defended enemy strong point and secure information which enabled us to plan our later attack upon ***. His willingness to place himself between the enemy and his retiring patrol was directly responsible for the safe return of his men. In this final action, First Lieutenant Garry was mortally wounded. His gallant actions and dedicated devotion to duty, without regard for his own life, were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Army.\n\nHome Town: San Francisco, California\n\nGAYBRANT, LOUIS A.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private Louis A.

When Private Gaybrant's platoon was pinned down by furious enemy machine gun fire, wholly unmindful of his own safety, he moved up and down the line from man to man encouraging them and maintaining their fighting spirit. During the reorganization of the unit, Private Gaybrant remained in front and covered the group by firing rifle grenades at the enemy. Private Gaybrant's heroic devotion to duty and his inspiring disregard for personal safety reflect great credit upon himself and the finest traditions of the military service.\n\nGEISINGER, ARTHUR R.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Arthur R.

In the face of overwhelming firepower, Private Geisinger, a member of a 90-mm. gun crew, heroically remained at his post during a vicious German armored thrust which forced other friendly troops and tanks to withdraw. As two massive tanks approached his gun position, fire was placed upon them with devastating accuracy, completely destroying the tanks and blocking the road for any further advance of the hostile mechanized units. Private Geisinger, by his intrepid personal bravery and exemplary courage, was highly instrumental in preventing heavy losses to both personnel and material, thus reflecting great credit on himself and the military service.\n\nHeadquarters, 1st Army, General Orders No. 25 (February 12, 1945)\n\nHome Town: Ohio\n\nGENDRON, HERMAN R.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Herman R.

Sergeant Gouge's squad was attacked by a large German patrol, covered in their advance by automatic weapons fire. Sergeant Gouge had in his squad six men and one heavy enemy machine gun. In the opening of the fire fight, the machine gun was knocked out and the two men on it were wounded by German grenades. The Germans rushed his position in strength and reached a point ten to fifteen yards in front of the position, whereupon Sergeant Gouge, oblivious to the fire, ran from one position to the next encouraging his men by both word and example, and was himself wounded by grenade fragments. He refused medical attention until after the fire fight, in which he personally crawled forward under the covering fire of his men and knocked out one machine gun and crew with grenades. Sergeant Gouge's sheer courage and aggressive action was not only an inspiration to his own men but was directly responsible for holding the line, which was used as the line of departure for an attack on Hill 131 that same morning.

On 25 January 1945, when hostile fire inflicted four casualties and halted his company near Houssen, France, Sergeant Grabner singlehandedly broke enemy resistance. With many of the rifles in his company frozen and unable to function, he crawled forward through intense small arms fire that barely missed him and shellfire that hit within 25 yards of him, to a point about 20 yards from the nearest Germans. Hurling several grenades into the enemy's positions, he killed and wounded a number of Germans and so demoralized others that 20 more surrendered.

Private First Class Gray and two comrades were ordered to investigate a wooded sector about 150 yards to their left front. Although it was mid-afternoon and over comparatively open terrain, Private First Class Gray and his companions succeeded in approaching the area without being observed. Detecting enemy positions, Private First Class Gray moved up and opened fire with his Browning Automatic Rifle, wounding one and forcing twelve others to surrender. After checking for other enemy troops in the area, the three men returned with their prisoners. Shortly afterward, one squad was ordered to secure positions some distance to the front and Private First Class Gray was assigned to guard the right flank during the advance. Observed by the enemy, the squad was pinned down by enemy machine gun and self-propelled fire. Private First Class Gray located the position of the machine gun and destroyed the position by wounding the two gunners. The squad was then able to advance and destroy the self propelled gun.

During the attack on Company G by an estimated battalion of Panzer Grenadiers, Sergeant Green, Light Machine Gun Section Leader of Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3d Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82d Airborne Division, was in direct charge of five machine guns which were delivering intense fire upon the attacking forces. As the attack progressed, a call was made for support on the left flank. Seizing a machine gun, Sergeant Green called for two volunteers and undertook to cross one hundred yards of brilliantly moonlit ground, under heavy fire from both enemy and our own forces, to a new position. Close to their objective, they came face to face with Germans. Acting swiftly and coolly, Sergeant Green shoved the machine gun into one of the German's hands and shouted: \"Here - this is for you.\" He then fell flat and called to his two men, \"Kill them - they're Germans.\" The squad opened fire killing two Germans and forced the others to fall back. Sergeant Green established the new position and brought effective fire to bear on the enemy. Throughout the entire action, Sergeant Green directed the fire of his section with great skill, and, although subsequently wounded, remained with his section until the enemy was repulsed with heavy losses. His actions reflect great credit upon himself and upon the Airborne Forces of the United States Army.\n\nGREEN, JAMES E.\n\n(Second Award)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Silver Star to First Lieutenant (Infantry) James E.

He led his platoon during 14 hours of cross country marching, assisting in overcoming strong points, and encouraging his men when they became exhausted. At the suspected enemy town, he walked directly up to the houses to ascertain whether the enemy were hiding inside. When he was challenged by an enemy sentry, he deployed his platoon and directed fire into the town. The platoon was subjected to enemy machine gun fire, and Lieutenant Green fearlessly maintained an exposed position in order to direct the fire of his automatic weapons and encourage his men.

On that date, First Lieutenant Grimball, in command of a tank platoon, was proceeding on a mission of support to an infantry battalion when enemy bazooka fire rendered his command tank inoperative. Showing rare presence of mind, First Lieutenant Grimball ordered his crew to remain within the tank and by radio directed effective platoon fire, eliminating the enemy bazooka team. First Lieutenant Grimball then ordering his crew to dismount and follow him, preceded these men and his tanks to a new position. There First Lieutenant Grimball directed his tank platoon and dismounted crew under continuous enemy fire with such stunning effect of enemy demoralization that 87 prisoners were taken. First Lieutenant Grimball then mounted another tank and continuing his aggressive tactics, he destroyed a dug-in enemy tank while proceeding to his original mission of support to the infantry. Upon reaching the infantry position, he noted that it was in dire need of tank support. He thereupon deployed his tank platoon into position so as to render direct fire support to the infantry. This action prevented a large scale enemy penetration. First Lieutenant Grimball's initiative and courageous leadership was an inspiration to his men which enabled them to successfully complete their mission.

During a night attack, Private First Class Hamada was wounded on the chest and leg by grenade fragments. He refused to be evacuated, as the platoon strength had been cut down to 20 men, and continued to fire at the enemy. Throughout the night, the hostile forces threw grenades into his position, but he remained at his post and forestalled a counterattack with his automatic fire. When the objective was secured the next day, Private First Class Hamada returned to the aid station for medical treatment.

Lieutenant Hamasaki was ordered to lead a six-man patrol to clear a group of buildings of any enemy troops that might be there. After moving out a short distance, the patrol received sniper fire. Lieutenant Hamasaki dashed to a nearby vineyard and crawled forward to escape observation, and his men followed his example. Lieutenant Hamasaki found no enemy soldiers in the first building, so he and another man set out for the next one, fifty yards away. Taking advantage of every means of cover and concealment, Lieutenant Hamasaki crawled to this building. When he arrived near the doorway, he suddenly lunged into the building, his sub-machine gun at his hip ready to fire. Three enemy troops, caught by surprise, raised their hands in surrender. Leaving the enemy prisoners under guard of his companion, Lieutenant Hamasaki searched the remainder of the building and came across another enemy soldier totally unaware of what was taking place. His mission accomplished, Lieutenant Hamasaki led the patrol back to the company area with the four prisoners. Lieutenant Hamasaki's courage and skillful leadership reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nHeadquarters, 34th Infantry Division, General Orders No. 142 (September 29, 1945)\n\nHome Town: Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nHAMILTON, EDWARD S.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major (Infantry) Edward Smith Hamilton (ASN: 0-22165), United States Army, for gallantry in action against the enemy while serving as Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion, 357th Infantry Regiment, 90th Infantry Division in Northern France.

During a heavy engagement with the enemy in the vicinity of Nancy on 19 September, an enemy shell burst upon a machine gun emplacement of Company D, 134th Infantry Regiment, 35th Infantry Division, killing its crew and breaking the gun's tripod. Sergeant Hansen, a platoon sergeant, seized the gun in his arms, wrapped the belts of ammunition about this shoulders, and advanced, firing the machine gun as he walked toward the enemy. This action enabled the men of his organization to advance to terrain more advantageous cover. Sergeant Hansen then returned, gathered the remaining members of his platoon and, in the face of heavy enemy artillery fire, reorganized them and set up his platoon in positions affording maximum fire in support of the riflemen. He then crawled forward to retrieve a tripod from a wrecked machine gun, thereby enabling an additional machine gun to be put into action. While engaged in directing his platoon in support of the riflemen, Sergeant Hansen was wounded. The courage and daring of Sergeant Hansen, his initiative, resourcefulness, dynamic leadership and disregard for personal safety constitute such gallantry in action as to be in accordance with the traditions of the military service.\n\nHome Town: Nebraska\n\nHARBISON, DERLAN A.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Derlan A.

Corporal Higashi, the Assistant Forward Observer for an 81-mm. mortar platoon, was in position of an Observation Post located on the crest of a hill forward of the advance infantry elements. The Observation Post was almost untenable because of intense and continuous enemy artillery fire. During the course of the morning, the enemy launched two counterattacks, preceded by an artillery barrage. Corporal Higashi, however, remained at his post directing fire orders to his platoon, although his position was being constantly shelled. Both times the enemy, estimated at two companies, were repulsed and their columns broken by mortar fire directed from this Observation Point. Corporal Higashi remained at his post during the entire morning until he and the other observers were killed by a tree burst of an enemy shell. His courage and bravery in the face of almost certain death was an inspiration to his fellow soldiers and a credit to the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nHeadquarters, 34th Infantry Division, General Orders No. 6 (January 25, 1944)\n\nBorn: July 13, 1917 at Honomu, Hawaii\n\nHome Town: Honomu, Hawaii\n\n*HIGGINS, GILBERT H., JR.

When the second tank of his column was knocked out, Lieutenant Higgins attempted to warn the lead tank to seek safety. Unable to make radio contact, he moved his tank into direct enemy fire to support the trapped vehicle. Before he could reach cover, his tank was knocked out and Lieutenant Higgins was severely wounded. Despite his wounds and continuing heavy enemy fire, he helped evacuate his crew. He then went for aid, crossing 1200 yards under incessant machine gun and mortar fire. While being evacuated himself, Lieutenant Higgins lost his life when the vehicle in which he was riding struck an enemy mine.

When the 1st Battalion was completely surrounded by hostile troops and isolated from other friendly units, Captain Higgins assumed command of the organization and, despite heavy artillery and mortar fire, skillfully directed his men in establishing a perimeter defense. Although the troops were without food and water and were subjected to a series of strong German attacks, Lieutenant Higgins worked tirelessly and courageously to maintain the morale of his men and, bravely exposing himself to hostile fire, directed elements of the battalion in repelling the attacks with heavy losses to the enemy. After five and a half days of continuous effort he succeeded in arranging for supplies to be dropped by planes, and, when some of the supplies landed in hostile territory, he personally conducted patrols to recover them. During this trying period his courageous and resourceful leadership inspired his men and kept them well-organized and encouraged until help arrived. His actions, without regard for his own safety, reflect great credit on himself and the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nHeadquarters, 36th Infantry Division, General Orders No. 237 (July 1, 1945)\n\nBorn: January 29, 1916 at Jersey City, New Jersey\n\nHome Town: Jersey City, New Jersey\n\nPersonal Awards: Silver Star (WWII), Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Prisoner of War Medal\n\nHILL, JOSEPH WALLACE\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Joseph Wallace Hill (0-436574), Captain (Infantry), U.S. Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy while serving with Headquarters, 2d Battalion, 442d Regimental Combat Team, attached to the 92d Infantry Division, on 19 and 20 April 1945, in Italy. Captain Hill's company was assigned the mission of cutting an enemy supply route. Under cover of darkness, he personally led his company from the last friendly outpost and into enemy territory. After four miles, the wire supply was exhausted and the company proceeded forward without telephone communications to the foot of a hill. Captain Hill was then successfully infiltrating a platoon into the foe's defenses when a hostile sentinel opened fire on him. Quickly dispersing his men, he worked his way under cover to within four yards of the sentinel and fired his pistol at point blank range, killing him. His shot alerted other enemy outposts and the company was immediately subjected to terrific automatic weapons and mortar fire. Despite this, Captain Hill continually exposed himself, directing his platoon in assaulting and securing their objectives. At dawn, he went forward on reconnaissance and discovered an enemy counterattack developing. Before the enemy could mount his assault, Captain Hill ordered his company to attack, driving the foe into retreat with 20 killed, 12 wounded, and 2 captured. The company then withdrew upon orders with only 6 casualties. Captain Hill's daring leadership exemplifies the heroic traditions of the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, 92d Infantry Division, General Orders No. 100 (October 20, 1945)\n\nHome Town: Dallas, Texas\n\n*HIRATANI, HIMEO (KIA)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Silver Star Medal (Posthumously) to Himeo Hiratani (30101500), Private, U.S. Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy while serving with Headquarters Company, 100th Infantry Battalion (Separate), attached to the 34th Infantry Division, on 4 November 1943, in the vicinity of Venafro, Italy.
