        "text": "Laboa, Tony L.\n\nHeadquarters, 24th Infantry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 43 - 19 January 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private First Class Tony L. Laboa (ASN: US-56056103), United States Army, for gallantry in action as a member of Company B, 5th Regimental Combat Team, 24th Infantry Division, near Kumsong, Korea, on 18 October 1951. Attacked by an overwhelming, numerically superior enemy force, his unit was forced to make a strategic withdrawal in order to regroup and reorganize. In order that this be done with as few casualties as possible, Private Laboa volunteered to remain behind and give covering fire with his machine gun. Remaining by himself, exposed to enemy small arms and automatic weapons fire, he personally killed or wounded approximately thirty-five of the enemy during his valiant one-man defense. His devastatingly accurate fire was so successful that he held off the enemy hordes until his comrades were able to return and drive the attackers from the hill. Private Laboa's courageous action, tenacious determination and selfless performance of a mission far above the call of duty contributed immeasurably to the success of his unit's defense and reflect the highest credit on himself and the United States Infantry. Home Town: Hanford, California.\n\nLackner, Clarence (3rd award)\n\nHeadquarters, 25th Infantry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 44 - July 26, 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Third Award of the Silver Star to Master Sergeant Clarence Lackner (ASN: RA-36294956/37294956), United States Army, for gallantry in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force while serving with Company F, 35th Regimental Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, in action in Korea on 22 July 1950. While Company F, 35th Infantry Regiment, occupied a position near Mun-Gyong, a superior number of enemy forces attacked the right flank of the Second Platoon, making the company's position untenable and forcing its withdrawal. Rallying his comrades, Sergeant Lackner led his platoon in a successful counterattack, regaining the high ground and consolidated the position while under heavy artillery, mortar and small arms fire. When his company was forced to withdraw a second time, Sergeant Lackner remained in position and covered the withdrawal by delivering effective and deadly counter fire until every member of the company had withdrawn. The aggressiveness, undaunted courage, and outstanding leadership by Sergeant Lackner was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects great credit on himself and the military service.\n\nLadd, Earl Jr.\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private First Class Earl Ladd, Jr. (MCSN: 595369), United States Marine Corps (Reserve), for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving as a Machine Gunner of Company E, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 7 March 1951. Assigned the mission of moving with the assault platoon in the company attack of a strongly fortified hill position defended by a determined enemy force, Private First Class Lass courageously exposed himself to devastating enemy automatic weapons, hand grenade and small arms fire to move his weapon continually forward in support of the advancing infantry. Remaining at his gun in exposed positions for a total of eighteen hours, he continually poured heavy fire on hostile positions and, when an air strike was called in on the enemy, remained at his gun although rockets landed perilously close to his position. Throughout the entire action, he rendered close fire support most effectively and contributed materially to the final successful seizure of the strategic ground. By his outstanding courage, daring initiative and indomitable fighting spirit, Private First Class Ladd upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. Born: Central Square, New York. Home Town: Central Square, New York.\n\nLade, Leo\n\nHeadquarters, 25th Infantry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 308 - 07 November 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private First Class Leo Lade (ASN: RA-16285697), United States Army, for gallantry in action as a member of Company D, 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, in action against an armed enemy in Korea. On 4 September 1950, near Kahen, Korea, an enemy attack forced two guards off the bridge on an important supply route and threatened the company from the rear. Private First Class Lade picked up a machine gun and advanced into the intense hostile fire, killed several of the enemy and setter the rest to flight, thereby keeping open the supply route and eliminating a grave threat to the company position. Private First Class Lade's audacious and resolute actions are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nLadou, Edward M.\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Air Forces\n\nGeneral Orders No. 32 - 16 January 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Edward M. Ladou, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy on 14 August 1951. On that date, Lieutenant Ladou piloted his unarmed SA-16 rescue aircraft over 50 miles into enemy-held North Korea to effect the rescue of a downed United Nations airman. As the pilot was swimming in the Taedong River near Chinnampo, Korea, Lieutenant Ladou landed his aircraft in the water, in spite of known heavy automatic weapons fire, floating debris and unknown shoals and rocks below the surface of the muddy river. With skill and tenacity, he completed the successful rescue of the pilot, preventing his capture by the enemy. Through his flying skill, courage, and devotion to duty, Lieutenant Ladou reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nLaFrance, Dale E. (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Sergeant Dale E. LaFrance (MCSN: 627705), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving with Company E, Second Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 10 June 1951. Although painfully wounded during the company attack on Hill 676 north of Yanggu, Sergeant LaFrance unhesitatingly assumed command when his squad leader became a casualty and, repeatedly exposing himself to fierce hostile fire, led the men in a daring charge which completely overran the enemy positions. Mortally wounded when he was again struck by hostile fire during the final assault, Sergeant LaFrance, by his courageous leadership, fortitude and unswerving devotion to duty, served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. Born: April 7, 1928 at Saginaw, Michigan. Home Town: Saginaw, Michigan.\n\nLaFrance, George A.\n\nGeneral Orders No. 713 - 13 November 1951\n\nHeadquarters 2d Infantry Division\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Corporal George A. LaFrance (ASN: RA-19382831), United States Army, for gallantry in action against the enemy while serving as a member of Medical Company, 23d Infantry Regiment, 2d Infantry Division, on 10 September 1951 in the vicinity of Songhyon-ni, Korea. On that date Corporal LaFrance was a Medical Aidman attached to a unit which was withdrawing from its positions after being relieved by elements of another friendly unit. Corporal LaFrance's unit was suddenly subjected to intense hostile mortar and artillery fire which inflicted several casualties among his comrades. Without hesitation, he advanced through the hostile fire to aid the stricken men. In the course of this, he was painfully wounded by an enemy mortar burst. Disregarding his own wounds and the intense enemy fire, Corporal LaFrance continued to administer aid to the wounded men. He remained with his fallen comrades until all of them were evacuated to positions of comparative safety and only then did he submit to treatment for his own wounds. His devotion to duty was directly responsible for saving the lives of many of his comrades. The gallantry in action displayed by Corporal LaFrance on this occasion reflects great credit upon himself and the military service. Home of Record: Washington\n\nLaFrance, William J. (Posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, 1st Cavalry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 104 - 9 June 1951\n\nThe Silver Star is awarded Posthumously to Private William J. LaFrance, RA17281678, Infantry, United States Army, Company B, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, for gallantry in action against the enemy of 4 February 1951 near Ochon-ni, Korea. The company was engaged in attacking the firmly entrenched enemy on Hill 402 and was halfway to the assigned objective when an extremely intense volume of small arms and automatic weapons fire pinned down the assaulting elements. Private LaFrance, quickly sizing up the situation, voluntarily made his way beyond his platoon’s position. In spite of heavy concentration of hostile fire, he, with two comrades, worked his way to within 50 feet of the emplacements. From this spot, he fired into the enemy’s midst, and when his ammunition was exhausted, he unhesitatingly arose, oblivious to the hail of fire, and fearlessly charged directly towards the Chinese. Although he was killed in this act, his aggressive and selfless act so surprised the enemy that they shifted their fire from the platoon, thereby allowing the friendly forces to continue forward and accomplish their mission. Private LaFrance’s conspicuous gallantry and supreme devotion to duty reflect great credit on himself and the military service. Entered federal service from Velva, North Dakota.\n\n--\n\nAfter 65 Years, Family of North Dakotan Learns Their Fallen Soldier was a Decorated Hero\n\n(Submitted by Merry Helm) Fargo, North Dakota, November 6, 2015\n\nIt’s been almost 65 years since William Juel LaFrance was killed in action. But it wasn’t until this summer that the North Dakotan’s family learned he was highly decorated for the action that took his life.\n\n“Willie” was a warm hearted and likable young man who overcame many hardships along the path that ultimately took his life. He was just learning to talk when his mother and newborn sister died from complications of childbirth. It was 1931, and the Great Depression was bearing down. But Willie’s father, Canute, a French Canadian pioneer, had been farming in Rolette County since 1883, and he knew how to survive.\n\nCanute’s first wife, also French Canadian, had died after bearing their 9th child, and Canute spent the next 13 years raising his children by himself. Then, in 1915, he married Justine Lattergrass, a young Turtle Mountain Chippewa woman. Justine bore Canute nine more children, the last of which died several months after her mother. Thus, Willie was the 17th, and final, surviving child of Canute, who was now approaching his 70th birthday.\n\nYoung William attended schools in Rolette County during some portions of his childhood, but times being what they were, he and several sisters were also relocated to St Paul’s Indian Mission School in Marty, South Dakota, for periods of time.\n\nCanute remained close to his children, however. Willie’s sister, Ella LaFrance, recalls, “Willie always helped Papa keep his farm machinery in top shape early in his life.” When he was 82, Canute moved his family to St. John, North Dakota, where William, now 13, attended high school. After their father died in 1947, Willie moved to Velva to live with Ella, who was five years older.\n\nThe Korean War started on June 25, 1950, and on July 1, President Harry Truman reported he would send American troops to aid the South Koreans. Even though his older brother, Charles, had been killed in action in World War II, Willie joined the Army that very day. When he arrived on the front lines six months later, U.S. troops in Korea had already suffered some 38,000 casualties, including killed, captured, wounded and/or missing in action. Communist China had now entered the war, and the current situation was dire.\n\nWillie was assigned to B Company of the “Custer Regiment” – the 7th Cavalry – which was then holding a sector southeast of Seoul. Several weeks later, on February 4, 1951, Willie was killed in action during close-in fighting. The family received his Purple Heart, and that was the extent of what they knew about his death.\n\nIn 2014, Korean War historian Merry Helm, Fargo, learned LaFrance had been awarded a Silver Star, and she was interested in learning the wording of the award citation for an upcoming volume of her book series, Prairie Boys at War: Korea. Using a genealogy site, she located Danny Gailfus, Willie’s great nephew from Canute’s first family, and told him she was searching for the citation. Gailfus, a 28-year Army veteran of Desert Storm and Desert Shield, as well as two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, was understandably pleased to help. He reached out to Gerald Thibert, the son of Willie’s sister, Ella, now living in California. It turned out nobody in the LaFrance family ever knew Willie was decorated, so Helm, Gailfus and Thibert contacted Randy Richards, from Rep. Kevin Cramer’s office, to see if he could help order the documents Helm was able to identify.\n\nSeveral months later, the records arrived and revealed the full story of Willie’s action on that icy February day. The citation reads, in part:\n\n[Company B] was engaged in attacking the firmly entrenched enemy on Hill 402 and was halfway to the assigned objective when an extremely intense volume of small arms and automatic weapons fire pinned down the assaulting elements. Private LaFrance, quickly sizing up the situation, voluntarily made his way beyond his platoon’s position. In spite of a heavy concentration of hostile fire, he, with two comrades, worked his way to within 50 feet of the emplacements. From this spot, he fired into the enemy’s midst, and when his ammunition was exhausted, he unhesitatingly arose, oblivious to the hail of fire, and fearlessly charged directly toward the Chinese. Although he was killed in this act, his aggressive and selfless act so surprised the enemy that they shifted their fire from the platoon, thereby allowing the friendly forces to continue forward and accomplish their mission. Private LaFrance’s conspicuous gallantry and supreme devotion to duty reflect great credit on himself and the military service.\n\nAfter learning about her youngest brother’s heroism, Ella, now 90 years old, began opening up to her son, describing the heartbreak her family endured when he died. The family’s Catholic priest in Velva had held a memorial service for Willie soon after they learned he was killed. But when Willie’s remains were returned for burial seven months later, the priest refused to allow him to be buried in the church’s cemetery, saying Willie was “a hoodlum.” “My family was really hurt and angry when the church wouldn't bury my uncle in their cemetery,” Thibert relates. “When my Uncle William was killed, they were still dealing with the loss of my Uncle Charles, who was killed during World War II. And the people they should have been able to trust weren’t there for them. My Mother said it was like a slap in the face.”\n\nThe family reeled back but found an appropriate alternative. “Willie was buried with military honors on September 7, 1951, in the Black Hills National Cemetery in Sturgis, South Dakota,” says Gailfus. “He is where he belongs, with those other hoodlums who answered the call to serve and who served so proudly. Being in the military myself, I know how important it is to ensure that those who deserve to be recognized are, and I am proud to have helped Willie get his due.”\n\nThe cemetery has now added the Silver Star notation to Willie’s gravestone. And Representative Cramer’s office went on to obtain Willie’s missing Silver Star, as well as replacements of his other decorations. A shadow box was prepared and presented, along with a 48-star flag (as would have been used in 1951) to Willie’s sister Ella and her son Gerry during a ceremony in Sebastopol, California, on October 16. Overcome with emotion, Ella wept, saying, “This means the world to me.”\n\nGerry had meanwhile added an extra medal to the shadow box; Willie’s original Purple Heart from 1951 now hangs beside its new replacement. “I have learned a lot about medals and citations and what they represent,” he said. “But when we first received William’s decorations, I opened one, and then another, and had to stop and sit down as I realized what I had in front of me. These were not just medals and documents. They represented the life and unselfish sacrifices my uncle made so that others could live. I felt humbled to have the Honor Guards present them to my mother.”\n\nHelm has since reached out to the Catholic church to see if an apology to Ella LaFrance is in order, and the Fargo Diocese is presently studying the case. “In my research, I’ve learned something important about soldiers who were heroic on the battlefield,” Helm says. “Enlisted men who were highly decorated tended to have overcome tough challenges and hardships during their youth, including a surprising number who lost one or both of their parents. These boys became survivors. Some were scrappy, lacked opportunities and were labeled hoodlums. But history indicates many of these restless boys were heroes without a cause until they reached the front lines. Such was the case with Private LaFrance. North Dakota can be very proud of this tenacious young warrior.\"\n\nLaHue, Foster C.\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Lieutenant Colonel Foster C. LaHue (MCSN: 0-7721), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity as Commanding Officer of the Third Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 20 September 1951. Assigned the mission of attacking and seizing difficult hill objectives defended by a stubborn enemy occupying heavily fortified installations, Lieutenant Colonel LaHue advanced his command post to successive exposed positions through devastating hostile mortar, automatic weapons and artillery fire and fearlessly directed the assault while moving forward with his men. When rugged terrain limited the use of organic supporting arms, he expertly employed the available arms and continued to press the attack despite fierce enemy resistance. By his outstanding bravery, determination and unyielding devotion to duty, Lieutenant Colonel LaHue was greatly responsible for the rapid seizure of the objectives with a minimum of loss to his forces. His valorous leadership was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. Born: September 2, 1917 at Corydon, Indiana. Home Town: Corydon, Indiana. Death: February 12, 1996.\n\nLair, Herbert J.\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private First Class Herbert J. Lair (MCSN: 1242247), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving as a Rocket Gunner of Company G, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 3 July 1952. During a night raid by his unit on a heavily defended outpost, Private First Class Lair skillfully employed his rocket launcher to destroy a hostile machine gun emplacement which had pinned down the unit. When all of his rockets had been expended, he acquired a wounded man's automatic rifle and continued in the assault, killing several enemy snipers and providing covering fire that permitted the safe evacuation of the wounded. Although suffering severe wounds when the unit was again pinned down by hostile fire, he proceeded alone for thirty yards through a blistering hail of fire to kill an enemy automatic weapons operator, thereby allowing his unit to successfully complete its mission. By his outstanding courage, daring initiative and resolute fighting spirit in the face of extreme peril, Private First Class Lair served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. Born: McIntosh, Oklahoma. Home Town: Pekin, Illinois.\n\nLaird, Charles W. Jr.\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private First Class Charles W. Laird, Jr. (MCSN: 567039), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving with Headquarters and Service Company, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 2 December 1950. When hostile machine gun fire from a well-entrenched position pinned down his company during an attack, Private First Class Laird bravely volunteered to seek out and destroy the enemy strongpoint. Boldly attacking the gun emplacement in the face of direct hostile fire, he killed eleven of the enemy with his rifle and hand grenades, thereby directly aiding his company in continuing the advance. By his marked courage, aggressive fighting spirit and unswerving devotion to duty, Private First Class Laird served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. Born: Uvalde, Texas. Home Town: Houston, Texas.\n\nLake, Jesse F. (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, 24th Infantry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 82 - 10 August 1950\n\nPrivate Jesse F. Lake, RA13263958, Field Artillery, United States Army, a member of Battery B, 52nd Field Artillery Battalion, 24th Infantry Division, is awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action on 16 July 1950 near Yongdong, Korea. A cook, Private Lake voluntarily manned a .50 caliber machinegun on the battery’s perimeter. By his accurate fire, he succeeded in destroying two enemy machineguns before they could be placed in operation. He deliberately placed his weapon in an exposed position so that he would have a clear field of fire. During his firing, Private Lake was severely wounded in the chest by an exploding enemy mortar shell. By his gallantry and voluntary exposure to danger, Private Lake brought great credit to himself and the military service. Entered service from Hagerstown, MD. Born: January 25, 1930. Home Town: Hagerstown, Maryland. Death: KIA: July 16, 1950 - Buried at: Mountain View Cemetery - Sharpsburg, Maryland.\n\nLakin, Elmer Clinton (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Corporal Elmer Clinton Lakin (MCSN: 1047151), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving as a Squad Leader of an Anti-Tank Assault Squad of Weapons Company, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 24 September 1950. Attached to a combat patrol which was taken under heavy small-arms and machine gun fire from well concealed enemy troops, Corporal Lakin was wounded early in the fire fight. Determined to remain in action, he refused to be evacuated and, without regard for his own personal safety, fearlessly exposed himself to hostile fire to direct and control the fire of his squad. Succumbing to his wounds, Corporal Lakin, by his fortitude, courage and unwavering devotion to duty, inspired others of his group to heroic endeavor, thereby upholding the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. Born: January 19, 1930 at Mitchell, Illinois. Home Town: Granite City, Illinois. Death: September 24, 1950 - Buried at: Sunset Hill Cemetery - Edwardsville, Illinois.\n\nLaMarr, Dexter H.\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private First Class Dexter H. LaMarr (MCSN: 605678), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving with Weapons Company, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 29 May 1951. When hostile forces launched a fierce assault against the rifle company to which he was attached as a radio operator during the hours of darkness, Private First Class LaMarr bravely positioned himself at the foremost point of the defensive perimeter in a daring effort to direct and maintain communications to the mortar emplacement. Although subjected to withering enemy machine gun, grenade and small arms fire throughout repeated attacks on his exposed position, he transmitted clear and concise radio messages which enabled the mortar section to deliver four hundred mortar rounds upon the onrushing hostile troops, and steadfastly remained at his post until he was seriously wounded in the neck and in the chest. By his exceptional courage, outstanding initiative and selfless devotion to the fulfillment of a vital task, Private First Class LaMarr served to inspire all who observed him and greatly aided his unit in repulsing the attack, thereby upholding the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. Born: Sheldon, Washington. Home Town: Sacramento, California.\n\nLamb, Richard C.\n\nStaff Sergeant Richard C. Lamb, United States Army, was awarded the Silver Star for exceptional valor and gallantry in action while serving with the Joint Security Force Company, United Nations Command Security Force at Panmunjom, Korea, on 23 November 1984. In reaction to thirty attacking North Korean soldiers in pursuit of a Soviet defector, Staff Sergeant Lamb's aggressive actions were instrumental in defeating the enemy. Throughout the intense firefight, Sergeant Lamb displayed a complete disregard for his own personal safety while accomplishing his mission. Staff Sergeant Lamb's bravery and aggressive performance of duty under extremely hazardous circumstances are in keeping with the finest traditions of military heroism and reflect great credit upon him, the United Nations Command and the United States Army.\n\nLamb, William L.\n\nHeadquarters, 45th Infantry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 313 (1952)\n\nSergeant William L. Lamb (ASN: US-55117544), United States Army, was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action as a member of Company G, 180th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Division, on 12 June 1952, in Korea. During a G Company raid on Hill 191, Sergeant Lamb broke through the enemy's defending mortar, artillery, and machine-gun fire to assault enemy bunkers. While the enemy troops tried desperately to hit him with automatic-weapons fire and hand grenades, Sergeant Lamb quickly dodged from one place to another and succeeded in advancing so close to the enemy entrenchments that he was able to catch hand grenades thrown at him and hurl them back into the enemy positions. In this way, he destroyed several enemy bunkers. Then as he prepared to return to friendly positions with the raiding group, he discovered one of his comrades who had been seriously wounded by the hostile fire. Immediately and without consideration for his own safety, Sergeant Lamb placed the wounded man on his back and, still carrying his M1 rifle for protection, started back to friendly positions. Meanwhile he picked up an air panel and placed it so that supporting planes would not strafe the withdrawing raiders. He finally made his way back over the six hundred yard route, carrying his wounded comrade and firing his rifle continually to cover his withdrawal. By the outstanding bravery and determination displayed on this occasion, Sergeant Lamb inflicted severe losses on the enemy, protected his comrades from strafing by friendly planes while they raided enemy positions, and rescued a wounded comrade form enemy territory. This action reflects great credit on Sergeant Lamb and is in keeping with the highest traditions of the Infantry.\n\nLamers, Edward Francis (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Private First Class Edward Francis Lamers (MCSN: 1254025), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving as a Fire Team Leader of Company A, First Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 3 February 1953. As the platoon moved into the final assault during a raid against two strongly defended enemy positions, Private First Class Lamers fearlessly led his unit through a heavy barrage of mortar and small arms fire into the hostile trenches. Aggressively pursuing the enemy, he constantly directed his fire team in the clearing of caves, bunkers and fighting holes and continued the attack until he was struck by fragments from a hostile mortar shell and fell, mortally wounded. By his courageous leadership, determination and unswerving devotion to duty, Private First Class Lamers served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. Born: September 10, 1928 at Bronx, New York. Home Town: Flushing, Long Island, New York. Death: KIA: February 3, 1953.\n\nLaMonica, Anthony Daniel (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Hospitalman Anthony Daniel LaMonica (NSN: 3029383), United States Navy, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy while serving as a Medical Corpsman attached to Company F, Second Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division (Rein.), FMF, in action against enemy aggressor forces near Kudong, Korea, on the night of 15 - 16 September 1951. During his platoon's attack on a heavily fortified enemy hill position, Hospitalman LaMonica repeatedly braved intense hostile fire to administer expert treatment to the wounded, frequently going forward of the line to reach the casualties. When his unit withdrew to defensive positions for the night after a vigorous two-hour battle, he worked in the middle of the intense cross fire of enemy weapons, remaining until the last to insure that all casualties had been safely evacuated, and, while the new defenses were being consolidated, assisted in protecting these positions. With his platoon suffering approximately ninety per cent casualties during a series of concerted night attacks by a numerically superior hostile force, he moved calmly about the area under heavy fire and skillfully administered medical aid until mortally wounded shortly before dawn. His initiative, courage, and steadfast devotion to duty in the face of grave personal risk inspired all who served with him, reflecting the highest credit upon Hospitalman LaMonica and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. Commanding General, 1st Marine Division, FMF, Serial 62972 (December 22, 1951). Born: October 25, 1930. Home Town: Chicago, Illinois.

During the advance on the city he continuously remained with the forward elements, in an exposed vehicle, in order to better direct his company's assaults on strong enemy positions. With utter disregard for his own safety he exposed himself time and again to heavy fire from the determined enemy in directing his troops in their successful advance. Captain Landers' fearless example was an inspiration to his command and aided materially in the successful accomplishment of its mission. His gallant actions reflect the greatest credit on himself and the United States Armor.

Sergeant Landes was acting as a forward observer for a section of an 81-mm. Mortar Platoon that was assigned a support mission to two Rifle Companies of Second Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment (Infantry). The mission of the unit was to clear an enemy road block and seize a mountain pass, thereby allowing the rest of the Battalion to withdraw from a pocket. In order to accomplish his mission, Sergeant Landes had to expose himself to enemy automatic rifle, mortar and artillery fire. With complete disregard for his personal safety, Sergeant Landes stood on the crest of the hill, using himself for an aiming point, while directing the fire of his section. Although seriously wounded, Sergeant Landes remained at his position until such time as his gun crews had accomplished their mission in neutralizing enemy strong holds, thus allowing the surrounded battalion to withdraw. Sergeant Landes' heroic action reflects great credit upon himself and was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\nLandis, James F.\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Staff Sergeant James F. Landis (MCSN: 642183), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving with Company I, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 8 April 1952. Although blown from his covered position twice, and his rifle rendered inoperable from extremely intense hostile fire during an attack against a strong enemy fortification, Staff Sergeant Landis bravely charged the hostile position with hand grenades and personally killed three of the enemy. Seriously wounded during the final assault, he continued to attack the opposition until his company moved to more favorable positions and, despite severe pain, returned to friendly lines without assistance, refusing medical aid until all other wounded members of the patrol had been treated. By his outstanding courage, daring initiative and selfless devotion to duty, Staff Sergeant Landis served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

Assigned the mission of counterattacking enemy forces which had overrun a friendly outpost position, Captain Landrigan courageously directed his company through devastating hostile mortar and artillery fire into an attack position. When the order to suspend the counterattack was received, he reconnoitered his position and the area forward of his unit although under persistent enemy fire. Observing that an exhausted force was precariously defending the main line of resistance, he assumed control of the local area and personally directed reinforcement to the main line from elements of his own command. Undeterred by the murderous hostile fire which was inflicting heavy casualties upon the unit, he continued to inspect his own line and the lines of the units over which he had assumed control, inspiring the men to greater efforts by his resourcefulness under fire. Throughout the following daylight ours, he continued to maintain a strong defense despite the devastating enemy fire directed upon the position and its stalwart defenders. By his courageous leadership, resolute determination and gallant devotion to duty, Captain Landrigan served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

Although still suffering from a recent illness, Hospitalman Lane voluntarily returned to duty in advance of his normal release date to accompany his unit in the attack on a strongly defended ridge in the vicinity of Hoengsong. Concerned only for the safety of others throughout the assault, he repeatedly exposed himself to the accurate hostile fire to render first aid to the wounded and, on three separate occasions, advanced under intense machine gun, small arms and mortar fire to treat fallen Marines and evacuate them to safety. Observing a casualty lying in an exposed fire-swept area during the final stages of the assault, he again braved the enemy barrage and, just as he reached the wounded man, was fatally struck down by a burst of enemy fire. His heroic actions, indomitable courage and steadfast devotion to duty at great risk to his own life served as an inspiration to all who observed him and reflect the highest credit upon Hospitalman Lane and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. Born: September 3, 1930. Home Town: Oilton, Oklahoma. Death: KIA: March 15, 1951.\n\nLane, William D. Jr.\n\nSergeant William D.

The city of Taejon had been surrounded by enemy forces and road blocks had been established by the enemy on the routes of withdrawal from the city. The casualties of the friendly elements in the city had been moderately high. Under extremely heavy artillery, mortar, and automatic weapons fire, Sergeant Lane rescued the wounded and evacuated them to places of shelter and administered first aid to them. On one occasion, four men were pinned under an overturned vehicle and Sergeant Lane with disregard for his own safety, worked with some other men for several hours before they were freed. During the entire period he was in Taejon he aided in giving medical attention and evacuating over 30 wounded men. The act of gallantry displayed by Sergeant Lane reflects great credit on himself and the military service. GO 95, 16 Aug 1950.

Lang (MCSN: 1223633), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving as a Radioman of Company H, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 6 October 1952. When a numerically superior enemy force launched an intense mortar and artillery barrage and overran the strategic combat outpost well forward of the main line of resistance, reducing the defenders to a small group and trapping them in the command post bunker after several hours of bitter fighting, Private First Class Lang transmitted messages to the main line and called in artillery and mortar fire throughout the night in a brave attempt to keep the enemy away from the bunker. When a rescue force drew near the outpost, he immediately contacted their radio operator and described the location of hostile strong points and gun positions. Although suffering a severe concussion as enemy troops continually fired small arms bursts and threw grenades into the bunker, he persisted in carrying out his duties until the outpost was retaken by a friendly unit, whereupon he unhesitatingly assisted in evacuating the wounded Marines. By his outstanding courage, resolute determination and gallant devotion to duty, Private First Class Lang served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

(posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, 2nd Infantry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 109 - 18 December 1950\n\nThe Silver Star is posthumously awarded to Sergeant First class Lee W. Langeberg, RA37755810, Infantry, United States Army, a member of Company H, 23d Infantry Regiment, 2d Infantry Division, who displayed gallantry in action against an armed enemy on 4 September 1950 in the vicinity of Changnyong, Korea. On that date the light machine gun section which he commanded had the mission of providing supporting fire for a rifle company which was defending high ground against a fierce enemy attack. In the initial phases of the action, he moved one of his squads forward to a position from which they had an excellent field of fire. He then directed the fire of the squad, remaining exposed to heavy enemy automatic weapons and small arms fire, in order to locate targets for his gunners. At this time he was wounded, but disregarding his personal safety he moved his section forward once more and located an enemy machine gun emplacement. In order to direct the fire of his guns he deliberately remained exposed to the intense enemy fire until he was once more wounded, this time mortally. The fire he had directed on the enemy was instrumental in repelling the attack. The gallantry and selfless devotion to duty displayed by Sergeant Langeberg reflect great credit upon himself and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the military service.

On that date his company had secured its objective and had set up defensive positions, when it was suddenly subjected to a barrage of enemy mortar fire which wounded several men. During this action Private Langenfeld, with complete disregard for his personal safety, left his position of comparative safety and advanced to a forward position from which he could better observe the enemy. Locating the enemy mortar, he called for and directed friendly mortar fire upon the enemy’s position. While thus exposing himself, he was killed by a round from the enemy mortar. His courageous action undoubtedly saved the lives of many of his comrades and was directly responsible for neutralizing the enemy mortar position.

During an engagement with a numerically superior enemy force, many of the men of his unit had, without orders, started withdrawing because of extremely heavy enemy mortar and small arms fire being directed at them. Realizing the urgency of the situation, Lieutenant Lango immediately exposed himself to the murderous hail of enemy fire to reorganize his troops and urged them to return to their positions. By continuously exposing himself, going from man to man, maintaining organization and encouraging each man individually, Lieutenant Lango inspired his men to the extent that the enemy failed to penetrate the lines and was forced to withdraw. His brilliant leadership and conspicuous courage, under direct enemy fire, were a great inspiration to his men.

When his machine gun section suffered heavy casualties during an attack by his company against a strong hostile force, Corporal Lansil immediately assumed the responsibility of leader and reorganized his section. Bravely exposing himself to direct hostile small arms and machine gun fire, he moved along the front lines to locate and spot enemy gun positions so that accurate fire could be brought to bear. During a furious counterattack by the enemy, he continually moved from one gun position to another, supervising and directing effective fire to inflict heavy casualties among the fanatical aggressors. By his daring initiative, determined leadership and cool courage in the face of heavy odds, Corporal Lansil contributed materially to the successful repulse of the enemy and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

Lapham, Infantry, United States Army, distinguished himself by gallantry in action near Kumh-Wa, Korea, on 12 September 1951. When two platoons of Private Lapham's company were pinned down by intense enemy fire his platoon joined the attack. In attempting to capture a trench the third platoon also came under heavy mortar fire and was forced to scatter. Private Lapham, with the platoon leader and a few other men reached a location from which the enemy position that was holding up the advance was visible 40 yards away. In leading an attack on the position the platoon leader was killed and one soldier wounded, Private Lapham and two others were able to take cover. In utter disregard of his own safety, Private Lapham stood up firing his rifle and throwing grenades as he ran to the enemy trench. When he ran out of ammunition he jumped into the trench and used his rifle as a club. Though mortally wounded, Private Lapham succeeded in silencing the enemy position and enabled the attack to continue. Private Lapham's gallantry, devotion to duty, and self-sacrifice contributed immeasurably to the success of the attack and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\n[KWE Note: Born at Nappanee, Indiana, his family moved to the Benton Harbor area of Michigan where he was buried in Cassopolis, Michigan.]\n\nLa Pointe, Walter Baptisse (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, 1st Cavalry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 345 - November 07, 1951\n\nThe Silver Star is posthumously awarded to Private First Class Walter B.

Ignoring the intense fire the foe was directing on the area, Private La Pointe displayed superb courage and determination by advancing whenever possible and setting up his weapon in unprotected but commanding positions. He bravely continued in this manner, providing much needed automatic weapons fire for his comrades, until mortally wounded. Private L aPointe’s gallantry reflects highest credit on himself and the military service. Entered federal service from South Dakota.\n\n\"Walter was the youngest of eight children born to Albert and Elizabeth Ringing Shield LaPointe. Like so many Native Americans in South Dakota and across our country, Walter felt an obligation to serve his country. Walter enlisted at the age of 19 and was sent overseas in 1951. Just four months after arriving in Korea, Walter was killed in an intense firefight near Homang-ni. He was awarded a posthumous Silver Star for \"gallantry in action'' and I would like to read from his citation.

His mother Elizabeth was touched by the warmth local veterans displayed at her son's passing. The following Spring, Elizabeth decided to serve lunch to the local American Legion Post. She decided to make it a tradition, and each year since the Legion Post in Mosher has enjoyed a luncheon served by the LaPointe family.\n\nEven after Elizabeth's passing, the tradition continues, and still today the members of the local Legion Post know the enduring gratitude of the La Pointe family. Many friendships have been built over the years and a special connection between the family and Mosher's veteran community has grown. Speaking of the tradition, a family member recently said: 'In this manner, we will forever preserve [Walter's] memory.' Indeed, they have done much more than that. With their generosity, they have strengthened the ties of friendship between the citizens of South Dakota and the men and women who fight to protect them. They have shown our veterans that their service will never be forgotten.\"\n\n[Source: Senate Session September 20, 2004, Congressional Record, Senator Daschle]\n\nLara, Steve C.\n\nHeadquarters 3d Infantry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 340 - 15 August 1953\n\nSergeant Steve C.

On 29 January 1951, at about half past midnight in the vicinity of Turung, Korea, Company \"A\" Command Post was surrounded by an estimated two hundred enemy who attempted a surprise attack. Their design was foiled by Lieutenant Lavergne, company executive officer, who gave the alarm and immediately sprang to an exposed position to engage the enemy with automatic carbine fire. This rapid and heroic action delayed the enemy attack, permitting his comrades to deploy, take up the battle, and eventually fight their way out.

Severely wounded by an enemy grenade while his squad was defending an outpost against a numerically superior enemy force firmly entrenched on high ground, Private First Class Lawler steadfastly continued to fire his machine gun and skillfully assisted a Corpsman in rendering aid to the wounded. Single-handedly manning the weapon after his assistant gunner was also wounded, he courageously engaged the enemy in intermittent fire-fights for over a one-hour period until his unit was reinforced and ordered to withdraw. Despite the intense pain of his wounds, he selflessly carried extra equipment and assisted other wounded to friendly lines in the face of enemy mortar fire before he collapsed and was evacuated. By his indomitable fighting spirit, marked fortitude and unyielding devotion to duty in the face of heavy odds, Private First Class Lawler served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

Upon reaching the infantry command post, Colonel Lawrence found that there was no communication between the infantry and artillery. The infantry was hard pressed and badly in need of artillery support. Colonel Lawrence started back to locate the wire vehicles which he had previously sent out and found them pinned down by enemy small arms fire. With total disregard for his own safety, he carried a line to an artillery observation post from which he adjusted artillery fire until the small arms fire of the enemy was silenced. He remained at his post adjusting fire until tanks arrived to relieve him. The gallant conduct of Colonel Lawrence reflects great credit upon himself and the military service.

During the attack on a ridge, the platoon leader of the second platoon was killed. Sergeant Lawson, the platoon sergeant, immediately assumed command of the platoon and continued the attack in a highly aggressive manner. At darkness, having seized a portion of the company objective, Sergeant Lawson was ordered to defend that position for the night. At approximately 0230, 18 August 1950, a severe enemy counterattack was launched against Company A's perimeter of defense. During the ensuing action, intense small arms, automatic, machinegun, hand and rifle grenade fire was directed at the Company position. Sergeant Lawson, wounded painfully in the thigh by machinegun fire during the initial enemy onslaught, continued to move among his men, directing their fires and reforming the line against the attacking enemy. While moving about through this intense fire, he was wounded again by shrapnel in the head, arms, legs and body. Not until the enemy attack was repulsed, would he allow himself to be evacuated. Although badly wounded himself, Sergeant Lawson unselfishly assisted two severely wounded Marines back to the aid station. His outstanding leadership, devotion to duty and heroic actions were an inspiration to his men and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

Simultaneously, with the halt, the column began to receive heavy enemy fire from both sides of the road. Without heed for his own safety, Corporal Lawwill voluntarily made himself a messenger between the commanding Officer's lead vehicle and the remainder of the column. Moving back and forth in the face of the vicious enemy fire, he was wounded by an enemy shell fragment. When the order to destroy equipment and retire to the rear was finally given, Corporal Lawwill, although wounded, volunteered to lead a group of men to safety through the enemy infested hills. Pursued by the enemy and continually in danger of ambush, he skillfully and successfully led the group to safety without a casualty. His initiative and fearless courage were directly responsible for the return of safety of thirty men who might otherwise have become casualties.

With his unit occupying a forward outpost during a fanatical enemy attack, Corporal Leach, although painfully wounded, bravely made his way through intense hostile artillery and mortar fire to inform the platoon commander of the squad's situation. When the numerically superior force overran the positions, he fearlessly rushed to the aid of another wounded Marine and repulsed the enemy with hand grenades and his bare fists. After skillfully reorganizing his squad, he set it in as part of a newly-formed defensive perimeter and directed his unit in repelling repeated hostile attacks for a period of three hours.

Sergeant Leachman immediately left the command post and moved to where he could aid the wounded sergeant. Displaying extreme courage and selflessness, he asked for covering fire, and then moved aggressively down the forward slope, completely disregarding the heavy enemy small arms fire directed on him. When he found he could not carry the wounded sergeant due to the intensity of the enemy fire, Sergeant Leachman, protecting the sergeant's body with his own, crawled and dragged the wounded man to safety.
