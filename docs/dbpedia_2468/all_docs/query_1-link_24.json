With complete disregard for his own personal safety, and despite the darkness, heavy rainfall, and hazardous flying conditions, he quickly located the stranded people and effectively completed seven lifts from the island threatened by inundation. Captain Alves' exceptional flying skill and heroic action during this mercy mission reflect distinct credit upon himself and the military service. (This award supersedes award of the Army Commendation Medal for outstanding courage on 17 July 1963 as announced in General Orders Number 81, Headquarters, U.S. Army Advisory Group, Korea, dated 14 August 1963.)\n\nBreneman, Charles A.\n\nHeadquarters, Department of the Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 18 - 24 April 1968\n\nSpecialist Six Charles A.

As one of the crew members of a UH-1B helicopter, he helped in saving the lives of approximately 40 people trapped on the roof of a burning building in downtown Seoul.

He then supervised the loading of the helicopter. In order to evacuate a maximum number of people in the helicopter, it was necessary for Specialist Breneman to hang to the open door. The helicopter made three trips through intense fire and smoke and the crew successfully saved the lives of all the trapped people.

Specialist Fehringer was acting as a crew chief on a UH-1B helicopter conducting flood rescue operations in the inundated Han River Valley, east of Seoul, Korea. The crew's first rescue operation involved evacuating approximately 170 persons stranded on the rapidly disappearing high ground of a Korean village. The helicopter landed in a backyard of one of the village homes, in the only remaining dry area which measured about 50 square feet. Immediately following the helicopter's landing, the flood victims began pushing, shoving and fighting, all seeking to board the ship. Responding immediately to the explosiveness of the situation, Sergeant Fehringer jumped out into the midst of the mob and by using sign language, and a limited amount of Korean, he attempted to gain control. Pulling an English speaking Korean to his side he shouted orders that were translated and brought the crowd under his control. He then began to systematically load women and children into the helicopter. During the two mile flight to the off-loading area, Specialist Fehringer spent his time reassuring frightened mothers and children and maintaining control. Ten flights were required to evacuate this group of people. On another occasion it was necessary to hover over a house to get to the people stranded within the building. While the helicopter was hovering, Specialist Fehringer climbed down the skid to the roof of the house and went inside to help them.

Sergeant Deaver volunteered to lead one of the patrols that was dispatched to capture the intruders prior to their crossing the Demilitarized Zone. In an attempt to extricate the infiltrators from the United Nations side of the Demilitarized Zone, the enemy directed effective small-arms fire against Sergeant Deaver's patrol.

Two shots hit him; then both patrols received heavy enemy fire. Quickly deploying his men, Sergeant Grace advanced up the hill, removed the wounded man to the relative safety of a depression, and assumed a defensive position.

(Bronze with V)\n\nHeadquarters, Department of the Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 26 - 18 June 1968\n\nPrivate First class Claude M. Hester, (then Private), United States Army, a member of Company C, 76th Engineer Battalion (Construction), Camp Liberty Bell, Joint Security Area, Korea, who distinguished himself by heroic action during operations against an armed infiltrator force on 28 August 1967 at the south boundary of the demilitarized zone in Korea. At 1645 hours, a North Korean infiltrator force fired directly from hidden hillside positions into all tents, buildings and sectors of Company C with heavy and light automatic weapons fire. Private Hester had driven into the company motor pool parking area in a 5-ton dump truck when the enemy fire commenced. All other persons in the company area were either unarmed, pinned down, or caring for the wounded. Private Hester did not leave his truck cab but, without regard for his own life or safety, calmly and methodically fired a 20-round magazine of ammunition with his M-14 rifle directly into the hostile force positions. This action undoubtedly reduced the enemy's rate of fire and hampered their accuracy. He was the only individual in the unit to return the hostile fire within the first minutes of the attack. He then dismounted his truck, obtained more ammunition from an arriving Infantry force and again, with complete disregard for his own safety, accompanied the Infantry squad in an aggressive sweep of the hill. His gallantry and heroism while under intense fire were in the highest traditions of the United States Army and reflect great credit upon himself and his unit.\n\nLangenberg, Peter M.

Specialist Siembida voluntarily and without regard to personal safety exposed himself to hostile fire in the performance of his duties as an aid man. Arriving at the scene of an intense fire fight, Specialist Siembida was quickly informed of the location of wounded personnel. After giving instructions to the other aid men, he proceeded to reach the casualties. Despite the heavy enemy fire, Specialist Siembida ran approximately 100 meters across an open area to the first man. Finding him dead, he shouldered the body and made the perilous return to friendly positions, preventing possible enemy capture of the body. He thereupon again dashed through the heavy fire to reach the other wounded personnel. Struggling to a forward position, Specialist Siembida found that the men had already been evacuated. He retrieved valuable discarded equipment, and, after traversing the open area for the fourth time, supervised the treatment and evacuation of the wounded. Specialist Siembida's outstanding intrepidity and heroic conduct reflect great credit upon himself, the 7th Infantry Division, and the United States Army.

Lundgren, W3150442, Transportation Corps, United States Army, a member of the 15th Transportation Detachment, 1st Cavalry Division, distinguished himself by heroism while participating in aerial flight on 26 February 1962, in Korea. Warrant Officer Lundgren was the pilot of an H-19C Chickasaw helicopter carrying a co-pilot and five passengers. In an attempt to land the helicopter at a helipad in mountainous terrain, the anti-torque mechanism suddenly failed and the aircraft began to vibrate violently at approximately one hundred feet above the ground. As the helicopter settled earthward, directional control was lost and the aircraft started to turn away from the helipad into a wooded area. In this sudden emergency, Warrant Officer Lundgren demonstrated outstanding technical competence, sound judgment, and presence of mind. Despite the extreme difficulty in maintaining control of the helicopter, he succeeded in maneuvering its tailboom against a tree, thereby stabilizing the aircraft, and preventing it from completely spinning out of control. After assuring that his passengers were evacuated and a safe distance away, he then attempted to save the helicopter by hover-taxiing it to the helipad. When the tailboom became dislodged from the tree, the helicopter rotated violently, became completely uncontrollable, crashed, and immediately burst into flames. When the aircraft crashed, the co-pilot was trapped on the flight deck. Warrant Officer Lundgren assisted him to safety through the pilot's emergency exit, then evacuated himself before the burning aircraft became completely engulfed by flames. Warrant Officer Lundren's complete disregard for his own personal safety, quick thinking, and courageous action saved the lives of his passengers and co-pilot and reflects the utmost credit on himself and the military service.

Following his capture, Sergeant Hammond, through his unyielding resistance and fierce loyalty to his shipmates and his country, became a symbol of resistance, courage, and dedication to the United States. This infuriated the North Koreans, who singled him out for more frequent and far more severe brutalities than were administered to the other prisoners. When the North Koreans learned that the U.S.S. Pueblo crew had duped them in their international propaganda efforts, they intensified their efforts to break the will and spirit of the crew through the administration of indiscriminate beatings. Realizing that many of his shipmates were in danger of being permanently injured or killed, Sergeant Hammond willingly attempted to sacrifice his own life in order that his shipmates might be spared further torture.

Col. Sam Holloway, division supply officer and Ross' supervisor, said this honor means closure for Ross. \"It's final recognition for an outstanding performance of duty a long time ago. This was a long time coming, and it's a well deserved honor,\" Holloway said.\n\nRoss was awarded the Bronze Star for \"exceptional valor as a rifleman assigned to the Joint Security Force Company, United Nations Command Security Force at Panmunjom, Korea Nov. 23, 1984.\" Ross and his unit took part in a firefight with thirty North Korean Soldiers in pursuit of a Soviet defector, ensuring border security and the safety of the defector and others in the UN command sector of the Joint Security Area.\n\nBrig.

Eikenberry was a major assigned as Ross' deputy commander at the time the firefight for which he was recognized ensued.

He noted that Ross has been taking difficult assignments throughout his entire career and not having had these prestigious awards until now has not changed the high quality of Soldier he is.\n\nRoss said being recognized for a combat action that took place so long ago came as a surprise and it's a huge honor for him to receive these awards. \"I was not expecting it. It makes you feel really good that someone thought enough about it to keep on this after all these years,\" Ross said. \"I continuously think of what happened over there because people died, but I never thought about it as an award due.\"\n\nRoss, who initially joined the Army to earn enough money for his college education, said that that one day in Korea, just six months after he enlisted, changed his outlook on the military's mission altogether. \"If this did not happen I would not have made a career out of it.

After probing, locating, and disarming the mines in the area and reaching the severely wounded Korean, he quickly applied first aid and discovered that the injured soldier was lying on top of a live mine. Realizing the imminent danger of detonation in attempting to remove the mine from beneath the victim, he undauntedly started the harrowing and dangerous task. He held the wounded man's body with one hand to prevent him from moving and exploding the mine and fearlessly and skillfully extracted the mine and continued his work until all mines in the cluster were located and disarmed. He then capably assisted in evacuating the wounded soldier from the minefield. Sergeant Anderson's unhesitating, efficient, and heroic action in the face of grave danger saved the life of his Korean comrade and reflects great credit upon himself and the military service.

Due to type construction, raging water and trees, it was impossible to make the rescue with the helicopter. The rowboat had been flown to the vicinity, offloaded to a building and subsequently towed by helicopter to the upstream side of the house. Warrant Officer Cochran and the policeman then rowed the boat through the trees to the house. To evacuate the family, it was planned to make two trips so as not to overload the twelve foot rowboat. Just as the boat was beginning to be towed away from the house with four persons aboard, the mother with a baby on her back and the policeman jumped in too. One of the boys stood up and tried to reach the house causing the boat to overturn, spilling all occupants into the fast moving current of the Han River.

During more than one hour of extremely hazardous efforts in clearing a lane to the injured soldier, Specialist Crawford and his comrades located and disarmed numerous mines. When he and the other members of the rescue party had advanced to within approximately twenty meters of the injured soldier, a helicopter lowered a sling in an attempt to airlift him from the dangerous area. Observing that the soldier was too weak to tie himself securely to the sling and was in danger of falling or rolling onto other mines, Specialist Crawford, with complete disregard for his own personal safety, rushed through the remaining distance of the un-cleared mine field, and assisted him into the sling. Specialist Crawford's heroic action, devotion to duty, and deep concern for a fellow soldier are in the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on himself and the United States Army.

Despite great personal danger, Sergeant Crisman waded through waist-deep icy water back to the burning plane, aware that there were several full tanks of gasoline inside which had not yet exploded. In the face of these hazards, Sergeant Crisman and the men who went with him appeared to give no thought to their personal safety or their lives and reentered the plane. The wounded man was located near the flaming inside engine, and was carried back through the rapidly rising icy water by the rescue detail. Upon his return, Sergeant Crisman continued to assist the wounded and give moral support to others.
