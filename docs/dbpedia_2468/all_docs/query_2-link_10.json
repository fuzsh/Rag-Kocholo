' - At the easterly'end of the cricket field at Quidividi, to i fce mooring ground for the balloon; a supply of hydrogen, sufficient to entirely re fill the 200-foot bag has been stored in cylinders brought ashore L from the cruiser Chicago. The capacity of the C-5 is 180,000 cubic feet, v In' a deserted inn between the hangar of Capt. Frederick P. Raynham, the British aviator, 500 gallons of gasoline are stored. This amount is 100 gallons more than the C-5 carries.; A spare motor-has been set up in one room of the old inn, ready for immediate installation in the C-S should either of its engines need to be replaced when it arrives. Flight to England is believed well within the capabilities of the C-S. Naval aviation officers here said that theC-3, a \"sister ship\" to the C-5 had remained in the air 33 hours and six minutes and that the C-l flew 1,385 miles, on a trip from Rockaway, N.
