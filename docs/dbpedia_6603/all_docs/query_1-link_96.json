        "text": "Historical July III: Cleopatra (1963): Part II\n\nMARCUS ANTONIUS\n\nBorn in 83 BC, Antony was a plebeian, and the third cousin once removed of Julius Caesar himself! But his dad was sort of a corrupt asshat, and he left the family pretty poor right before he died. Eventually, that relatively poor childhood lead Antony to joining a street gang and gaining a fuckton of debt, and eventually forcing him to get an education to get out of it all. And of course, this led him into the military. It’s Rome; everybody who’s anybody ends up in the military.\n\nHe serves for a while, has a kid with his cousin, and then fights in the Gallic Wars under the command of Marcus Crassus. Remember, the Spartacus guy? That tie gets him a high-ranking spot in the staff of none other than Julius fucking Caesar. The two became pretty good friends and strong allies. It was also during this time that the young Antony met an even younger Cleopatra for the first time. Little did they know…little did they fucking know…\n\nCaesar becomes…well, Caesar, and he takes his good friend Antony with him to the top. Just in time, too, because the alliance that had gotten Caesar there, the First Triumvirate, was quickly collapsing. Crassus is killed in battle, Pompey’s wife (and Caesar’s daughter) dies, and Julie is left holding the goddamn bag of Rome. He then proceeds to set that bag on FUCKING FIRE…but that’s another story. Back to Antony!\n\nAntony’s one of Caesar’s closest allies and confidantes at this point. As all his allies turn against him, Antony stays firmly at his side. And then, Pompey and Caesar get into a fight, Pompey fucks right off to Egypt, and Civil War begins. Antony tries to resolve the conflict, but war’s inevitable at this point. Antony is quite abruptly installed by Caesar (now emperor) as governor of all Italy, which doesn’t endear him to his citizens. The army REALLY likes him though…which will definitely work out for them in the end.\n\nSo, warwarwar, governgoverngovern, and a lot of shit happens. While Caesar and Cleopatra are making a child, Antony is still governing Italy, and beginning to win the love of the people as well. Well, almost all the people. The Senate fucking HATED him, although not as much as Caesar himself. Eventually, Antony fucks up a case against a general and his debts, and the resulting shitshow (which resulted in Antony needlessly killing hundreds of Roman citizens, yes REALLY) forces Caesar to return from his Egyptian fucktrip.\n\nCaesar gets back, and he pardons Antony for his misgivings, while also stripping him of all official positions. Ouch. Antony gets over it, gets married for the third time, and has two more children. And now that Caesar’s back in the country taking care of things, it’s all good! Nothing can go wrong at this point. Right?\n\nRight. So, Gretchen Weiner cracks, and that leads to Antony delivering one of the most iconic ancient speeches of all time. While holding Caesar’s blood-drenched toga, he tells friends, countrymen, and Romans alike about the man that was Caesar, while working up the crowd into a frenzy to avenger their beloved Caesar. And now, Antony was INSANELY popular with the people. Things are looking up Antony, right? Well, uh…enter Octavian.\n\nOh boy. See, this frail young man is named Caesar’s rightful heir in his will. Which PISSES. ANTONY. OFF. Dude gave EVERYTHING to Caesar, and this little whelp pops out of the woodwork? Fuck off, man! But OK, whatever. We’ll make a go at it, and Antony forms an alliance with the young heir. After all, he’s still got the love of the people, and he really should be Caesar’s heir, according to him.\n\nBut OK, truce. Octavian and Antony, along with general Lepidus, for the Second Triumvirate of Rome, each ruling over a portion of the Roman Empire. A fuckton happens here, but for the sake of expediency, we’ll fast forward through the arguments and tension, and through Antony refusing to give Caesar god status and losing the support of the public, and we see Rome now split into 8 sections, with each monarch ruling over one. And Antony gets where else but: Egypt.\n\nBut first, business. Antony hunts down the killers of Caesar, specifically Brutus and Cassius, and that series of events is fascinating…but it’s also a lot. It’s after this that Antony gets control over the territories in the East, including Ptolemaic Egypt, where Cleopatra is raising her son, the biological son of Julius Caesar himself.\n\nFirst, he takes some time to endear himself to his new Greek citizens, and then…well, let’s find out, huh? After all, this is where we pick up the film, in 42 BC. And if Shakespeare was right…hoo boy, we’re in for another ride.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!!! AGAIN!!!\n\nRecap (2/2)\n\nAfter two years of hunting them down, Marcus Antoninus, or Mark Antony (Richard Burton) has finally caught and killed Cassius and Brutus, defeating their armies in a prolonged civil war. After the celebration, he meets with the sickly Octavian (Roddy McDowall), now the new Caesar. Mark’s not the biggest fan of this, but he accepts it.\n\nSee, the organization of the leadership is now a triumvirate, meaning that Octavian shares his leadership with Mark and the unseen Lepidus. They all govern over Rome and Italy, but each has their own specific domain as well. Octavian has Spain and Gaul, Lepidus oversees Africa, and Anthony has the eastern portions. But with all the fighting, the entire empire is running out of money. To which, Antony has a plan.\n\nIn Egypt, Cleopatra continues to lament Julius, and what she sees as Rome’s disrespect of both her and their son. But she also knows that Rome needs them, specifically for money. This features in conversation between Antony and his general Rufio (Martin Landau), as they mean to launch another campaign into Parthia. And even worse, the triumvirate dissolves as Octavian forces Lepidus into exile, leaving him in control of Spain. To keep their armies, they need money to pay them. And so, the proud Antony orders Rufio to bring Cleopatra to him, as he will not go to Egypt to beg for help.\n\nWhich is just too fuckin’ bad, because Cleopatra’s not going ANYWHERE for Antony. Either he comes to her, or nothing…at first. See, she refuses to step foot off of Egyptian grounds, and the ship that she sails in on counts as Egyptian grounds. Said ship is legendary, by the way, as the sails were perfumed in order for all to know that she was coming by smell, well before sight. Man, Cleopatra is an interesting historical figure.\n\nOnce again (and at last), Mark Antony and Cleopatra meet face-to-face. The atmosphere is a little tense, as the two sit down for dinner amongst a joint group of their subjects. We get a brief reminder that Egypt functions off of slave labor at this point, and I wonder how in the ever-loving fuck they were able to get a peacock for the banquet! They’re from fuckin’ India and eastern Asia!\n\nDuring dinner, it’s obvious that Cleopatra will never forget Julius, and that she considers Mark to be MUCH less than her deceased husband. But Mark is wanting to kill more than just Julius’ shoes, as he suggests his feelings for her, and his desire to stay with her that night. However, she’s not quite into it, and instead tries to convince him to go back to Rome, and take the throne and power from Octavian, as Julius would’ve. And as they watch a dance dedicated to the god Bacchus, Mark celebrates the drunken god in his own way: by getting plastered and horny. Which, to be fair, is the right way to do so.\n\nAs the drunken Antony makes a bit of a fool of himself, and proves himself to be less than Julius Caesar indeed, Cleopatra leaves the hall. Once he realizes this, he chases after her in his drunken stupor. Which, in truth, is exactly what Cleopatra wanted in the first place. See, Cleopatra is nothing if not calculating and tactical. And as such, she tells her servant to allow him through.\n\nCalm and collected as the drunken Mark rampages in her bedchamber, she listens as Mark laments being stuck underneath Caesar’s massive looming shadow. Everywhere he turns it’s Julius, Julius, Julius! It’s always Julius! Everything always came so easy for her, even when he gets hit in the face by a discus and breaks his nose! BUT WHEN DOES MARK GET A TURN, DAMMIT?\n\nBut in truth, Antony’s struggles are understandable; it’s gotta be hard standing in the shadow of one of the world’s greatest leaders at the time. Cleopatra doesn’t offer him the pity he freely offers himself, but she does give into his lust, and the two kiss, as he rips off her necklace of Caesar coins. And their love affair officially begins, and Antony admits that he has loved her upon first sight, like the true simp that he is. And Cleopatra also remembers Antony from her childhood, when Antony first came to Egypt as a young soldier.\n\nAnd this, THIS, is the TRUE romance that would come to define both of their legacies. See, it’s not easy to tear Cleopatra’s ambition and manipulations from her true emotions, but this was for all intents and purposes a love story to last the ages. Hell, it’s famous enough that it was memorialized by none other than Willaim Shakespeare himself, in Antony and Cleopatra. It’s one of his best known and loved historical plays, of which he had a LOT. To be fair, though, the first half of this film is memorialized in ANOTHER play, Julius Caesar. So, yeah, it’s a tale as old as…41 B.C.\n\nAnd as always, we cut back to the Senate. Upon hearing that Antony is picking up Julius’ sloppy seconds (to summarize the tone of their mockery), they laugh at him. But Octavian rightly points out that Antony still has the public opinion on his side, despite not being anywhere near him. Thus, he does indeed have power in his absence. Even some of the Senate still sides with him over Octavian. Which is, of course, not good for Octavian.\n\nBack again in Egypt, now much later since the last time we saw the two, Mark is being summoned to return to Rome. And in the time since, something quite surprising has happened: Cleopatra genuinely loves Antony. Like, REALLY loves him. The two are madly enraptured with each other, with Julius no longer casting that shadow over their relationship. She begs him to be careful with Octavian, and to come back to her when he can.\n\nOctavian, ever the crafty manipulator, plots to keep Antony in Rome for longer than anticipated. With his general Agrippa (Andrew Keir), he brings his sister Octavia (Jean Marsh) to meet him at the port of Brundisium, where Spartacus’ ghost is just sobbing uncontrollably. Love it when there’s historical continuity in these films. Octavian is planning on wedding the two, likely against Antony’s will, in order to keep Antony in Rome for a bit longer. And, well…that’s exactly what he does.\n\nCleopatra gets the news, and she’s…she is NOT OK. In a way that’s weirdly symbolically reminiscent of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton’s famously tumultuous relationship, Cleopatra tears apart the bedchambers they had shared together in absolute unabating rage, until finally breaking down and sobbing deeply. Antony’s not happy about this either, much to Octavia’s frustration. He obviously always has his eyes and mind on Egypt, and on Cleopatra. He’s constantly been sending ambassadors to Egypt to reestablish vital trade and alliances, which have been cut off since the marriage. They’ve been turned away, as the only person she will speak with is Mark.\n\nAnd Cleopatra is PIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSED.\n\nYeah, she’s fucking DONE with Rome and its bullshit. She refuses to recognize Mark, or speak with him privately. She demands that she be treated as superior to him, and that Mark kneels before the throne of Egypt and Cleopatra. She agrees to reestablish their treaty of alliance, in exchange for Egypt’s control of Judea, Jordn, Armenia, Phoecia, Sinai, Arabia, Cyprus, and Crete. In other words, 1/3 of the Roman Empire. Yeah. SHE IS FUCKING PISSED.\n\nThe power play that Cleopatra performs here is so beautifully petty and vicious, that it’s something to behold. I swear to God, I just someone somewhere say “YASS QUEEEEEEN”, and they have no idea why they did it! This is absolutely Elizabeth Taylor favorite scene in this movie, because you KNOW that she enjoyed fucking over Richard Burton like this. My GOD, this scene is fucking great. Seriously, check it out. I’d post an image, but you gotta see the whole thing, holy shit.\n\nLater on, Antony confront Cleopatra privately, and Cleopatra puts him down once more, calling him a coward and a slave to Octavian, and an unfeeling boor towards her feelings. But Antony insists that he only simps for one woman: Cleopatra. But again, she’s still pretty fuckin’ pissed off, more at Octavian at this point than Antony. And she has a MUCH better grasp of how manipulative and dangerous Octavian can be, proving herself a much smarter person and ruler than Antony could be. Goddamn, for a 1963 movie, Cleopatra kicks FUCKIN’ ASS!!!\n\nI haven’t mentioned this yet, but Elizabeth Taylor’s fucking FANTASTIC in this movie. Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Roddy McDowall, and Martin Landau are also pretty fuckin’ great as well, and the acting in this movie gets a 9/10 from me! It’s still old-school cheesy, but it’s fuckin’ great. And the writing by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Ranald MacDougall, and Sidney Buchanan is also pretty goddamn top-notch. Seriously, I fuckin’ love this movie. Cleo, you’re pretty great.\n\nRude. But OK, back to the Roman Senate, where everybody is absolutely enraged. Why? Because Antony and Cleopatra have married, with Antony divorcing Octavia, and actually giving those territories to Egypt, and away from Rome! Like, holy shit. 1/3 of the Roman Empire gone with one stroke, and Octavian now takes advantage of this blunder. Seeing his true opponent as Cleopatra, as he should, he paints Antony as a traitor to Rome, and he completely loses Roman public opinion. He gives to them Antony’s will, delivered by Cleopatra’s now-ignored advisor Sosigenes.\n\nAnd I just need to mention this: I fuckin’ LOVE Roddy McDowall. And I really haven’t seen him in…well, anything. There’s this movie, where his Octavian is fucking GREAT, and I have yet to watch Planet of the Apes. But, he’ll always have a place near and dear to by heart. Why? Why is a raven like a writing desk, Batman?\n\nIn the will, Antony notes that he wants to be buried in Egypt, with Cleopatra, whom Octavian paints as a whore. Octavian’s won over the Senate, and quickly wins over the people, and that rage quickly boils over into a declaration of war with Egypt. Which, in truth, is the only way that this could POSSIBLY end. He speaks to the public, and war on Egypt is waged. Sosigenes steps up, in an attempt to stop this from happening. And Octavian, holding the ceremonial golden spear of war, greets him in kind.\n\nDamn. I liked Sosigenes, too. Now that war is waged, Antony plots in Egypt from the port of Actium. But Antony is not only completely under the command of Cleopatra, but is also himself compromised in his wisdom. Nowhere near the tactical genius that Caesar was after all, he drowns himself in rage and drink, and the man Cleopatra fell in love with begins to disappear. And already you can tell: the coming naval battle will not end well for Egypt.\n\nAntony’s generals aren’t exactly a fan of the new paradigm either, and Antony’s plan has him almost completely exposed on the open sea. Still, Roman fights Roman on the sea, as Octavian already proves his army’s advantage with their superior ships. And to approximately nobody’s surprise, Octavian’s general Agrippa easily defeats Antony and his Egyptian/Roman forces. There are a few important rules in ancient history, and one of them is this:\n\nDO NOT FUCK WITH ROME.\n\nAntony tried to get an upper hand by fighting and killing Octavian on the ship, only to find that Octavian ISN’T FUCKING THERE. Shit. And now that Agrippa has Antony trapped on one of THEIR ships, he orders his entire navy to move in, and the ENTIRE Egyptian fleet is completely fucked. They’re done.\n\nFearing that Antony is indeed dead, Cleopatra wisely decides upon retreat back to Egypt proper. However, she means retreat only for herself, and she abandons the army as a lost cause. Which is bad, yes, as she is the leader of one of the countries at war. But when Antony, who is STILL ALIVE, realizes that Cleopatra’s leaving him behind…she jumps off the fucking ship, and leaves the army completely leaderless. In other words…he fucks up. He fucks up MASSIVELY HARD. And by the way…THIS FUCKING ACTUALLY HAPPENED!!!\n\nUpon returning to Cleopatra’s ship, the disgraced and honestly cowardly Antony is greeted by an intensely disappointed Rufio. He’s disarmed by one of her soldiers, as she’s afraid the ashamed Antony might do something she’ll regret. And she’s probably right, as the intensely forlorn and depressed Antony mopes around for months. He’s also quite angry with Cleopatra for abandoning him, although she doesn’t feel that she had a choice in the matter, with Antony thought dead. And it’s also apparent at this point that their relationship is…not healthy. Like, at all.\n\nOctavian, meanwhile, has made it to Egypt. He wages war not on Cleopatra or Egypt, but on Mark Anthony. However, Cleopatra tells Agrippa that she refuses to give Antony alone without her going with him. Antony doesn’t understand this decision, but Cleopatra explains to the great big idiot that she actually loves him. Although, granted, that love is what caused this absolute mess in the first place.\n\nAntony continues to refer to himself as dead, having died a coward at Actium, abandoned by Cleopatra. The survivor’s guilt is pretty intense, and Cleopatra tries to snap him out of it in the most stereotypical classic film way: slapping him. That leads into an impressive monologue by Antony (and Burton), of his current not OK mental state. He’s been made a slave to his love, and that servitude is the death of him.\n\nBut Cleopatra’s mental state isn’t exactly…stellar. With their relationship having become extraordinarily dependent at this point, they kinda sorta enter a suicide pact; just a teeny one, though. Antony is turned around by her words, and decides to give this whole war thing one more shot, as he goes with Rufio the next day to meet and fight Octavian’s army. As he leaves, Cleopatra speaks with her advisor Apollodorus (Cesare Danova), and she admits that Antony’s probably fucked. Seeing the upcoming loss, his army will likely desert him. And seeing this as the end, Cleopatra chooses to remain, anticipating the death of Antony. And she prepares a box.\n\nCleopatra bids goodbye to her son, as he is shepherded out of Alexandria, and into safety. Just as well, as Octavian plans on taking her alive back to Rome. That night, before a battle is to take place, Antony arrives at his camp, backed by his army and generals, who aren’t exactly fans of Antony at this point. And as he retires for the night, he worries that his guard won’t wake him for the battle. But it’s…it’s worse than that. Because, as the sun rises, Antony wakes up to find…no one. They’ve all gone. Antony’s entire army abandons him, like he did to them on the sea. And Rufio, disgraced and hopeless, has killed himself rather than leave Antony. The most loyal of all, and arguably the most mistreated character in this half of the film.\n\nNow somehow EVEN MORE fucked, the desperate Antony rides alone to Octavian, sword in hand. And he attacks the soldiers by himself. And not gonna lie, it’s so pathetic that it’s actually sad. Now completely powerless, he asks to fight in a duel with literally anyone, to be given an honorable way to go out. But nobody’s willing to give him that. And as such, he rides home to Cleopatra, disgraced and completely renouncing Rome.\n\nHe rides back to find her, only to find Apollodorus, who tells her in so many words that she’s killed herself. Frustrated that she’s done so without him, he asks Apollodorus to help him die. Apollodorus refuses, and so, Anthony plunges his sword into his stomach, killing himself at last. But surprise; Apollodorus lied! See, he kinda hates their relationship, so he wasn’t planning on helping them get back together. However, feeling remorseful now, he helps Antony get to Cleopatra, who is within her pyramidal tomb, waiting for him. They say goodbye…and he dies in her arms.\n\nApollodorus also commits suicide, shortly before Octavian and his troops arrive. Surprised to hear that Antony is now dead, Octavian gives a surprisingly passionate eulogy for the man, noting that the passing of such a man should not be taken likely. They capture Cleopatra, forlorn and broken. Octavian tells her that the country of Egypt is now Rome’s, with Cleopatra allowed to act as a figurehead. He tells her that he is to bring her back to Rome, safe and sound. But then, she asks of her son’s status, asking if he can be allowed to rule Egypt. He agrees to this, and asks her word that she’ll not harm herself in any way. She swears it on the life of her son.\n\nFunny thing, that. Because Caesarion is dead. His body was seen on a chariot, and Octavian is wearing his ring, possibly not knowing that it was indeed Caesarion. She saw this, and this enact her plan to die. Within a bowl of figs, a venomous snake known as an asp has been smuggled into the tomb, with the help of her servants. As she plunges her hand into the bowl, the snake bites her, and she quickly dies of its venom. Her servants do the same.\n\nOctavian doesn’t realize this until it’s too late, as he receives a message from her post-bite, and rushes to the tomb to find her indeed quite dead. Agrippa asks “Was this well-done of your lady?” And her servant answers:\n\nExtremely well.\n\nGoddamn. Four fuckin’ hours…and it’s totally worth it.\n\nI mean it. This film was actually genuinely amazing. Let’s go through the points here, shall we?\n\nCast and Acting - 9/10: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, and Roddy McDowall all knock it out of the FUCKING PARK here. I mean it, this is some of the best performances I’ve seen for a bit. This is an absolutely fantastic cast, and I had not a single issue.\n\nPlot and Writing - 9/10: Still very good, as penned by Mankiewicz, MacDougall, and Buchman. An excellent script, and a pretty goddamn accurate version f the story, if shortened. I mean, they didn’t even mention the fact that Mark and Cleo had two kids, but whatever. Still very good.\n\nDirecting and Cinematography - 9/10: Classic and brilliant. Don’t know if I can say perfect, but I can say near perfect. Joseph L. Mankiewicz is a goddamn legend, and this is one of the reasons why.\n\nProduction and Art Design - 10/10: If I could give a goddamn 20/10, I FUCKING WOULD. THIS IS AN AMAZING LOOKING FILM. From Cleopatra’s BEAUTIFUL outfits and makeup, to the elaborate armors and costuming of our Roman guys, to the fucking massive-ass sets, this film is absolutely astonishing in terms of production design. Hell, it’s one of the most expensive films ever made, AND IT FUCKING SHOWS!!!\n\nMusic and Editing - 9/10: Music by Alex North is fucking FANTASTIC here, and the editing by Dorothy Spencer is also extremely good. I think the parade has some pacing issues, but it’s still basically perfect. Hell, for a four hour movie, I surprisingly remember it very well, and it didn’t even seem that long. Fuckin’ kudos, guys.\n\nAnother 92%, and that’s fucking accurate. WATCH THIS!!\n\nAfter this, I mean…Jesus Christ, what’s next? I mean, there’s…oh, right."
