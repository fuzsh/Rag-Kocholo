Messel designed the costumes and the set interiors. It was the only colour film which he designed.\n\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's remaining designs and artefacts (many designs were sold or given away during the artist's lifetime). The collection was briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being placed on indefinite loan to the V&A Theatre Museum from 1981. The Oliver Messel Collection was purchased from Lord Snowdon in 2005 with the aid of the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the Friends of the V&A.\n\nProduction\n\nDesigned for the film of George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, released in England in 1945.\n\nReason For Production: Commission\n\nSummary\n\nIn 1944, designer Oliver Messel was released from his war duties in camouflage to work on the film Caesar and Cleopatra, adapted from George Bernard Shaw's play. Messel was responsible for the costumes and the interior design of the sets, bringing all his imagination and ingenuity to creating Roman and Egyptian costumes and interiors in the context of the mid 1940s. The film was the most expensive British film to date, costing over Â£1m, and brought a welcome sense of extravagance and colour into a drab post-war world. Surprisingly, given his sense of colour, he never worked on another colour film.\n\nVivien Leigh (1913-1967) played Cleopatra. Although a costume design is created to indicate the character the actor is playing, it is rare for a designer to indicate the make-up. Here, Messel has indicated the heavy kohl eye-make-up which immediately suggests 'Egyptian' to the audience, ensuring the correct overall look of the costume. Messel made the jewelled head-dress himself.\n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation. By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre. He increasingly concentrated on non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.\n\nBibliographic reference\n\nPinkham, Roger (ed.)
