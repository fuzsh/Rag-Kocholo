        "text": "Cleopatra famously imagines with horror how some future actor will “boy my greatness”. Shakespeare gave her those words in an age when there were no women actors, and so men acted women. He did not imagine that this situation would eventually be reversed. Four hundred years later, Julius Caesar finds someone girling his greatness on the London stage.\n\nThe director, Phyllida Lloyd, is angry that women do not have enough parts in plays. She told the BBC last week that she looks forward to the day when the European Union will legislate to insist that all theatre companies must employ 50 per cent women, so that directors have to allocate parts regardless of sex. I feel that she should have stood by her principles when she directed the recent film The Iron Lady, and cast a man (Clint Eastwood? Ian McKellen? David Walliams?) as Mrs Thatcher.\n\nHer Julius Caesar is acted solely by women. It is shockingly bad, but the one thing it does establish is Lloyd’s contention that women can credibly act serious male parts – more readily, I would guess, than men can act serious female ones. As you would expect of the Donmar, there is plenty of talent. Harriet Walter, in particular, is a strong but sensitive Brutus, speaking her lines beautifully. Frances Barber is absolutely wrong as Caesar, being coarse and crude, but this is the fault of the production, not of her thespian skills.\n\nOh dear, the production. The framing device is that the play is being put on by the inmates of a women’s prison. The warder lets them out and, at the end, locks them up. Frances Barber (so far as I could see, craning my neck in the Donmar) also acts the warder. Shakespeare’s lines are interlarded with modern English words – or rather, variants on one word beginning with f. The prisoners are stirred up, I suppose, by the belief that their fault is not in their stars, but in themselves, that they are underlings. The play becomes their fantasy of their liberation, of killing the tyrant. When the production is finished, Caesar/warder sends them back to their cells.\n\n“Oh ye gods, ye gods, must I endure all this?” asks Cassius. One must return Brutus’s answer: “All this? Ay more.” There is punk music, a soothsayer sometimes naked but for a body stocking and sometimes in a little-girl dress and sometimes on a child’s tricycle. There are water-pistols instead of guns (yes, yes, I know there are no guns of any description in the original, but this is a sort of double imposition), and Antony begins his famous “Friends, Romans, countrymen” speech lying on the ground.\n\nIt would not be possible for a person unfamiliar with the play to understand from this production what it is about. This is not so much because of any wilful obscurity – although the prison interpolations are confusing. Nor is it because of the mangling of the lines: on the whole, these are delivered clearly. It is because the director herself does not understand what the play is about, or perhaps is not interested in understanding. I would not go so far as to say that she has it in for Shakespeare because of his stubborn refusal to make 50 per cent of the Roman Senate female, but the noise of the grinding of the directorial axe drowns out his play.\n\nPhyllida Lloyd’s premise that the drama is about liberation from tyranny is surely mistaken. That is only the outward-seeming subject, the slogan, as it were. It is really about power – how it corrupts not only its obvious holder, Caesar, but also those who rebel at his corruption. Brutus is a noble fellow, in the sense that he has a high concept of nobility and believes he is living up to it, but can we be sure he acts nobly? Antony’s description of Brutus as “honourable” is, famously, a rhetorical device, designed to undermine him and the other conspirators.\n\nRhetoric, indeed, is central to the play, because it is about politics, and how political language is used to persuade, pervert and prevail, both in private and in the forum. For this to work on stage, there has to be a strong sense of the mob, yet Lloyd cuts the opening crowd scene. The backdrop is thrown away.\n\nThere also has to be a strong sense of the public presence of the main characters. How do they seem in the eyes of the many? When standing before the many, how do they seem in the eyes of the few, who watch them so closely? Because Caesar is shown only as a menacing thug, it is impossible to imagine her (I am trying, a la Lloyd, to distribute my genders roughly 50:50) bestriding the world like a colossus. One is pleased when she is murdered by being forced to drink prison bleach. There is no sense that her death is tragic.\n\nWhich leads me to the final thing completely absent from this production. Shakespeare is obsessed with the fact that this is Rome. Rome stands for everything, because it is the greatest, the archetypal power. How Rome is ruled affects how everyone else is ruled everywhere, always. “Stoop then, and wash,” says Cassius to his co-conspirators over the body, “How many ages hence / Shall this our lofty scene be acted over / In states unborn, and accents yet unknown!”\n\nYou could say that this production proves him right. Here we are, in 2012, acting the lofty scene over again. But what poor Cassius could not have envisaged was an age in which the director has usurped the playwright and become a greater tyrant than great Caesar himself."
