        "text": "Julius Caesar is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays. It is so good in fact that we ranked it No. 8 on our list of Best Shakespeare Plays. It’s a classic tale, full to the brim of great speeches! It’s also more succinct and entertaining than the other Roman plays such as Antony and Cleopatra, Titus Andronicus and Coriolanus which are performed less and can often feel more laborious. This play is classified as a tragedy, though it is loosely based on historical facts – Shakespeare was never very good at keeping to history. This page will hopefully be a helpful resource for finding some of the best Julius Caesar monologues. The list is heavily dominated by Marc Antony, who has some absolute bangers in this play, but there is plenty to explore.\n\nI have listed all the notable monologues from the play both for men and women. I recently watched a terrific production of this play presented by the Donmar Warehouse in the UK, which was performed by an all-female cast. It was superb. So don’t ever feel limited to the gender of these characters and enjoy tackling whichever speech resonates with you.\n\nIf you need a brief overview of the play:\n\nJulius Caesar Monologue for Men\n\nAct 1 Scene 2 (Cassius)\n\nWhy, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\n\nLike a Colossus, and we petty men\n\nWalk under his huge legs and peep about\n\nTo find ourselves dishonourable graves.\n\nMen at some time are masters of their fates:\n\nThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\n\nBut in ourselves, that we are underlings.\n\nBrutus and Caesar: what should be in that ‘Caesar’?\n\nWhy should that name be sounded more than yours?\n\nWrite them together, yours is as fair a name;\n\nSound them, it doth become the mouth as well;\n\nWeigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,\n\nBrutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.\n\nNow, in the names of all the gods at once,\n\nUpon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,\n\nThat he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!\n\nRome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!\n\nWhen went there by an age, since the great flood,\n\nBut it was famed with more than with one man?\n\nWhen could they say till now, that talk’d of Rome,\n\nThat her wide walls encompass’d but one man?\n\nNow is it Rome indeed and room enough,\n\nWhen there is in it but one only man.\n\nO, you and I have heard our fathers say,\n\nThere was a Brutus once that would have brook’d\n\nThe eternal devil to keep his state in Rome\n\nAs easily as a king\n\nLEARN MORE: Full Cassius Act 1 Scene 2 Monologue Breakdown\n\nAct 2 Scene 1 (Brutus)\n\nIt must be by his death. And for my part\n\nI know no personal cause to spurn at him,\n\nBut for the general. He would be crowned:\n\nHow that might change his nature, there’s the question.\n\nIt is the bright day that brings forth the adder,\n\nAnd that craves wary walking. Crown him that,\n\nAnd then I grant we put a sting in him\n\nThat at his will he may do danger with.\n\nTh’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins\n\nRemorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar,\n\nI have not known when his affections swayed\n\nMore than his reason. But ’tis a common proof\n\nThat lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,\n\nWhereto the climber-upward turns his face;\n\nBut, when he once attains the upmost round,\n\nHe then unto the ladder turns his back,\n\nLooks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\n\nBy which he did ascend. So Caesar may.\n\nThen, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel\n\nWill bear no color for the thing he is,\n\nFashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,\n\nWould run to these and these extremities.\n\nAnd therefore think him as a serpent’s egg,\n\nWhich, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,\n\nAnd kill him in the shell.\n\nLEARN MORE: Brutus Act 2 Scene 1 Monologue Breakdown\n\nAct 3 Scene 1 (Marc Antony)\n\nMarc Antony walks in to see Caesar’s body, and the senators who have committed the crime stand before him…\n\nO mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?\n\nAre all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,\n\nShrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.\n\nI know not, gentlemen, what you intend,\n\nWho else must be let blood, who else is rank:\n\nIf I myself, there is no hour so fit\n\nAs Caesar’s death hour, nor no instrument\n\nOf half that worth as those your swords, made rich\n\nWith the most noble blood of all this world.\n\nI do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,\n\nNow, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,\n\nFulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,\n\nI shall not find myself so apt to die:\n\nNo place will please me so, no mean of death,\n\nAs here by Caesar, and by you cut off,\n\nThe choice and master spirits of this age.\n\nAct 3 Scene 1 (Marc Antony)\n\nAntony looks over Caesar’s dead body, after he has just been murdered…\n\nO, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,\n\nThat I am meek and gentle with these butchers!\n\nThou art the ruins of the noblest man\n\nThat ever lived in the tide of times.\n\nWoe to the hand that shed this costly blood!\n\nOver thy wounds now do I prophesy,—\n\nWhich, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,\n\nTo beg the voice and utterance of my tongue—\n\nA curse shall light upon the limbs of men;\n\nDomestic fury and fierce civil strife\n\nShall cumber all the parts of Italy;\n\nBlood and destruction shall be so in use\n\nAnd dreadful objects so familiar\n\nThat mothers shall but smile when they behold\n\nTheir infants quarter’d with the hands of war;\n\nAll pity choked with custom of fell deeds:\n\nAnd Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge,\n\nWith Ate by his side come hot from hell,\n\nShall in these confines with a monarch’s voice\n\nCry ‘Havoc,’ and let slip the dogs of war;\n\nThat this foul deed shall smell above the earth\n\nWith carrion men, groaning for burial.\n\nLEARN MORE: Full Marc Antony Act 2 Scene 1 Monologue Breakdown\n\nAct 3 Scene 2 (Marc Antony)\n\nCaesar’s funeral. Marc Antony has been allowed to speak, but cannot openly call out the crime of the senators. He uses this speech to rouse the people of rome…\n\nFriends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;\n\nI come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\n\nThe evil that men do lives after them;\n\nThe good is oft interred with their bones;\n\nSo let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus\n\nHath told you Caesar was ambitious:\n\nIf it were so, it was a grievous fault,\n\nAnd grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.\n\nHere, under leave of Brutus and the rest–\n\nFor Brutus is an honourable man;\n\nSo are they all, all honourable men–\n\nCome I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.\n\nHe was my friend, faithful and just to me:\n\nBut Brutus says he was ambitious;\n\nAnd Brutus is an honourable man.\n\nHe hath brought many captives home to Rome\n\nWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill:\n\nDid this in Caesar seem ambitious?\n\nWhen that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:\n\nAmbition should be made of sterner stuff:\n\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious;\n\nAnd Brutus is an honourable man.\n\nYou all did see that on the Lupercal\n\nI thrice presented him a kingly crown,\n\nWhich he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?\n\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious;\n\nAnd, sure, he is an honourable man.\n\nI speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,\n\nBut here I am to speak what I do know.\n\nYou all did love him once, not without cause:\n\nWhat cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?\n\nO judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,\n\nAnd men have lost their reason. Bear with me;\n\nMy heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\n\nAnd I must pause till it come back to me.\n\nAct 3 Scene 2 (Marc Antony):\n\nIf you have tears, prepare to shed them now.\n\nYou all do know this mantle. I remember\n\nThe first time ever Caesar put it on.\n\n‘Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent,\n\nThat day he overcame the Nervii.\n\nLook, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through.\n\nSee what a rent the envious Casca made.\n\nThrough this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed.\n\nAnd as he plucked his cursèd steel away,\n\nMark how the blood of Caesar followed it,\n\nAs rushing out of doors, to be resolved\n\nIf Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no.\n\nFor Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.\n\nJudge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!\n\nThis was the most unkindest cut of all.\n\nFor when the noble Caesar saw him stab,\n\nIngratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,\n\nQuite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart,\n\nAnd, in his mantle muffling up his face,\n\nEven at the base of Pompey’s statue,\n\nWhich all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.\n\nO, what a fall was there, my countrymen!\n\nThen I, and you, and all of us fell down,\n\nWhilst bloody treason flourished over us.\n\nOh, now you weep, and, I perceive, you feel\n\nThe dint of pity. These are gracious drops.\n\nKind souls, what, weep you when you but behold\n\nOur Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,\n\nHere is himself, marred, as you see, with traitors.\n\nJulius Caesar Monologues for Women\n\nAct 2 Scene 1 (Portia)\n\nIs Brutus sick? And is it physical\n\nTo walk unbracèd and suck up the humors\n\nOf the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,\n\nAnd will he steal out of his wholesome bed,\n\nTo dare the vile contagion of the night\n\nAnd tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air\n\nTo add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus.\n\nYou have some sick offense within your mind,\n\nWhich by the right and virtue of my place\n\nI ought to know of.\n\n(kneels) And upon my knees\n\nI charm you, by my once-commended beauty,\n\nBy all your vows of love and that great vow\n\nWhich did incorporate and make us one\n\nThat you unfold to me, your self, your half,\n\nWhy you are heavy, and what men tonight\n\nHave had to resort to you. For here have been\n\nSome six or seven who did hide their faces\n\nEven from darkness.\n\nLEARN MORE: Portia Act 2 Scene 1 Monologue Breakdown\n\nAct 2 Scene 1 (Portia)\n\nNor for yours neither. You’ve ungently, Brutus,\n\nStole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,\n\nYou suddenly arose, and walk’d about,\n\nMusing and sighing, with your arms across,\n\nAnd when I ask’d you what the matter was,\n\nYou stared upon me with ungentle looks;\n\nI urged you further; then you scratch’d your head,\n\nAnd too impatiently stamp’d with your foot;\n\nYet I insisted, yet you answer’d not,\n\nBut, with an angry wafture of your hand,\n\nGave sign for me to leave you: so I did;\n\nFearing to strengthen that impatience\n\nWhich seem’d too much enkindled, and withal\n\nHoping it was but an effect of humour,\n\nWhich sometime hath his hour with every man.\n\nIt will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,\n\nAnd could it work so much upon your shape\n\nAs it hath much prevail’d on your condition,\n\nI should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,\n\nMake me acquainted with your cause of grief.\n\nAct 2 Scene 2 (Calpurnia)\n\nCaesar, I never stood on ceremonies,\n\nYet now they fright me. There is one within,\n\nBesides the things that we have heard and seen,\n\nRecounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.\n\nA lioness hath whelped in the streets;\n\nAnd graves have yawn’d, and yielded up their dead;\n\nFierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,\n\nIn ranks and squadrons and right form of war,\n\nWhich drizzled blood upon the Capitol;\n\nThe noise of battle hurtled in the air,\n\nHorses did neigh, and dying men did groan,\n\nAnd ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.\n\nO Caesar! these things are beyond all use,\n\nAnd I do fear them."
