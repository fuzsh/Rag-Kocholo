Clarke also won the Oscar in this category at the 61st Academy Awards for You Don’t Have to Die and was nominated in 2002 for Prisoner of Paradise in the documentary feature category.\n\nHitler’s Children\n\nDirector: Chanoch Ze’evi\n\nChanoch Ze’evi is a director and producer of documentary films for the television and documentary film industries. In fifteen years of filmmaking, Mr. Ze’evi has addressed issues of conflict, reconciliation, and the social and political circumstances that define identity. His films are intended to forge paths and build bridges between opposing groups and cultures.\n\nThe Wonders\n\nDirector: Avi Nesher\n\nAvi Nesher‘s award winning films have played a major part in Israeli cinema’s rise to prominence during the last ten years. In 2010 Nesher wrote, directed and produced The Matchmaker which was hailed as the best movie of the year by several Israeli film critics. In 2007, Nesher’s Hasodot was hailed as “witty and wise, sensual and emotionally over powering – one of the best Israeli movies in recent years.” In 2005, Nesher directed the highly experimental political documentary Oriental about the Camp David Accords and won the “Spirit of Freedom” award at the Jerusalem Film Festival. “Brilliant and original” raved the Jerusalem Post “Avi Nesher is clearly Israel’s most innovative filmmaker.” Avi Nesher was born and raised in Ramat Gan, Israel. The child of a Romanian-born diplomat, and a mother who came from Russia.[2] In 1965, he moved with his family to the United States. He graduated high school at sixteen and studied international relations at Columbia University. In 1971, he returned to Israel and served in the IDF elite special forces unit Sayeret Matkal.\n\nQuality Balls\n\nDirector: Barry Avrich\n\nBarry Michael Avrich is a Canadian film director, film producer, playwright, author, marketing executive and arts philanthropist. Avrich’s film career has included critically acclaimed films about the entertainment business including The Last Mogul about film producer Lew Wasserman (2005), Glitter Palace about the Motion Picture Country Home (2005), and Guilty Pleasure about the Vanity Fair columnist and author Dominick Dunne (2004). Avrich also produced the Gemini-nominated television special Caesar and Cleopatra (2009) with Christopher Plummer.\n\nUnder the Same Sun\n\nDirector: Sameh Zoabi\n\nSameh Zoabi is a writer and director from Iksal, a small village in Israel. His feature debut, Man without a Cell Phone, was selected for the New Directors/New Films festival at MoMA and the Lincoln Center. His short film, “Be Quiet,” won third prize in the Cinéfondation Selection at the Cannes Film Festival. He has bachelor’s degrees in film studies and English literature from Tel Aviv University and attended the M.F.A. Film Program at Columbia on a merit scholarship.\n\nThe People Behind the Films\n\nThe Other Son\n\nDirector: Lorraine Levy\n\nIt takes ambition to switch from helming comedies to exploring the Israeli-Palestinian relations, as the third feature effort from writer/director Lorraine Levy demonstrates. Following 2004’s The First Time I Turned Twenty and 2008’s My Friends My Loves with an intimate and moving family drama, her latest feature teems with narrative, emotional and aesthetic determination. Lorraine provided Sarah Ward with her thoughts on The Other Son.\n\nQ: How did the project evolve, and what drew you to the storyline ?\n\nA: This project was initially proposed to me by Virginie Lacombe, my producer, who had started working on it with two authors, Nathalie Saugeon and Noam Fitoussi, before approaching me. I was straight away seduced by this project, which contained a lot of themes that are important for me: the search for identity, inter-personal relationships, filiation. Having said that, I hesitated initially because I noticed a lot of traps forming and I was not sure that I would be able to avoid them. For a start, to tell a story embedded in a conflict that I am not directly involved in. Indeed, even if I am a citizen of the world, even if everything that happens in Israel touches me viscerally as a Jew, I am neither Israeli nor Palestinian. In the end, the desire was stronger than the fear and I went for it. I wanted to propose a story that would be a sort of an out-stretched hand, like a proposal for possible peace. At the very least, a proposal to accept the Other. [more]\n\nIn The Shadow\n\nDirector: David Ondricek\n\nDavid Ondříček graduated from the school of documentary filmmaking at Prague’s FAMU.

Can you tell us briefly about the other two, and how this third part is linked to the others?\n\nA: They all began after my parents passed away. In the first of the films, Love Inventory […] I recruited my siblings to look for our missing sister as a tribute to my Mom, a mission I rebelled against fulfilling while she was still alive. The other two were made almost at the same time and both talk about fatherhood.\n\nQ: Can you tell us about the moment you discovered your late father’s memoir?\n\nA: It was when we came to my father’s home to clean it up after he passed away. It was in his drawer nearby his bed. It was as if he had written until his last day, which indeed he did. I was amazed, even shocked and of course very curious to find who he really was and what he thought.\n\nQ: Did you know immediately that you wanted to act upon the information the memoir contained, and produce a documentary about your journey?\n\nActually not. It took me 8 years to understand that I wanted to and that I had to create a film. I started by deconstructing my father’s memoir to chapters and stories and situations.
