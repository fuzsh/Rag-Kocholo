        "text": "Directing\n\nIn 1943 Mankiewicz signed a contract with Twentieth Century-Fox to work as a producer and a screenwriter. Three years later he made his directorial debut after replacing the ailing Ernst Lubitsch on Dragonwyck, the first of many films that he both wrote and directed. The Gothic mystery, released in 1946, featured Gene Tierney, Vincent Price, and Walter Huston. Mankiewicz was then assigned to direct Somewhere in the Night (1946), a passable film noir that suffered somewhat from uncharismatic leads John Hodiak and Nancy Guild and from its complicated but formulaic plot. The Late George Apley (1947) was a more typical Mankiewicz project, a comedy of manners that preserves the literary flavour of the J.P. Marquand novel on which it is based; Ronald Colman played a Boston blue blood concerned only with his social standing. The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) was a classic romantic fantasy, with Tierney as a widow courted by the ghost of a sea captain (played by Rex Harrison).\n\nIn 1949 Mankiewicz directed and wrote A Letter to Three Wives, which exemplified his signature style of intelligent and witty banter and furthered his reputation as a “literary” director. The drama centres on three married women (Linda Darnell, Ann Sothern, and Jeanne Crain) who each receive a letter from a friend named Addie, who claims she is about to run off with one of their husbands, leaving the women to question their marriages. In additon to Mankiewicz’s sharp script, the film boasted deft performances. A Letter to Three Wives received an Academy Award nomination for best picture, and Mankiewicz won Oscars for best screenplay and best director—the first time a director won in both categories simultaneously. Mankiewicz then made House of Strangers (1949), a potent if somewhat heavy-handed drama about a Machiavellian businessman (Edward G. Robinson) who exploits his own sons.\n\nFilms of the 1950s\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

It featured a searing performance by Richard Widmark as a bigoted criminal who tries to start a race riot after his brother dies while in the care of an African American doctor (Sidney Poitier, in his first credited film role). Next came All About Eve (1950), the film with which Mankiewicz is most closely associated. It is an acerbic backstage drama, with widely acclaimed dialogue—including the classic line “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy night”—and a handful of performances to match. Bette Davis played an aging theatre star who befriends an aspiring actress (Anne Baxter), only to discover that the young woman ruthlessly manipulates those around her. Others in the cast included George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Marilyn Monroe, and Thelma Ritter. The film received a record 14 Oscar nominations and won for best picture, supporting actor (Sanders), costume design, and sound. In addition, Mankiewicz again earned Oscars for both best director and screenplay.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1951 Mankiewicz served as president of the Screen Directors Guild (later Directors Guild of America). During that time he worked on People Will Talk (1951), which featured Cary Grant as a liberal medical professor who falls in love with an unmarried pregnant student (Crain). The World War II thriller 5 Fingers (1952) featured a notable performance by James Mason as a British ambassador’s valet who sells information to the Nazis. It earned Mankiewicz his third Oscar nomination for directing.\n\nWhen his contract with Fox expired, Mankiewicz worked at various studios. For MGM he made Julius Caesar (1953), a stellar adaptation of Shakespeare’s play. In addition to deft direction, the drama featured fine performances from an all-star cast that included Marlon Brando (Oscar-nominated for his Mark Antony), John Gielgud, Mason, Deborah Kerr, Louis Calhern, and Greer Garson. The film, which was produced by John Houseman, received an Academy Award nomination for best picture. The Barefoot Contessa (1954) was another notable drama, a caustic dissection of Hollywood mythmaking, with Humphrey Bogart as a cynical director who makes a star out of a naive Spanish dancer (Ava Gardner) with the help of an unscrupulous press agent (Edmond O’Brien, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor). Mankiewicz received a nomination for writing (story and screenplay).\n\nIn 1955 Mankiewicz directed his first musical, Guys and Dolls, which was based on a popular Broadway play. Although some argued that Brando and Frank Sinatra were miscast, the film received largely positive reviews and was a success at the box office. The Quiet American (1958) was a bowdlerized version of Graham Greene’s novel about a mysterious American (Audie Murphy) in Saigon, Vietnam, who finds himself at odds with a cynical British reporter (Michael Redgrave). Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) was better received. Gore Vidal adapted the Tennessee Williams play that concerns lobotomy, pederasty, and cannibalism. Elizabeth Taylor starred as a young woman who develops mental issues following the death of her cousin and is institutionalized. The dead cousin’s overprotective mother (Katharine Hepburn) wants her to have a lobotomy, but a doctor (Montgomery Clift) first tries to discover what happened.\n\nThose mature-period films exhibit the technical and thematic elements that characterize a typical Mankiewicz film. Chief among them is his radical use of narrative form: multiple narrators tell the stories in All About Eve and The Barefoot Contessa, an unreliable omniscient narrator misleads the viewing audience in The Quiet American, and Taylor’s hypnosis-induced flashbacks unravel the underlying mystery in Suddenly, Last Summer. Also common in Mankiewicz’s films is a certain preoccupation with death and its effect upon the living. Films such as The Late George Apley and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Julius Caesar, The Barefoot Contessa, and Suddenly, Last Summer feature dead characters who figure prominently in the story lines, more so than the living in most cases. Though Mankiewicz was to direct and write films in a variety of genres (screwball comedy, westerns, musicals, epics, and urban drama as well as adaptations of Shakespeare), it is the aforementioned elements that lend a common voice to the body of his work."
