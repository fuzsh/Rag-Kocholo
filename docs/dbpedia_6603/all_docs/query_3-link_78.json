        "text": "Simon Godwin directs Ralph Fiennes and Sophie Okonedo as the famous fated couple.\n\nCaesar and his assassins are dead. General Mark Antony now rules alongside his fellow defenders of Rome. But at the fringes of a war-torn empire the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra and Mark Antony have fallen fiercely in love.\n\nIn a tragic fight between devotion and duty, obsession becomes a catalyst for war. Politics and passion are violently intertwined in Shakespeareâ€™s gripping tale of power."
