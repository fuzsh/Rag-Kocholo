        "text": "Transcript\n\n[Music]\n\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW: And now we come, at last, to my play about Julius Caesar. Naturally, since I've been somewhat critical of Shakespeare, you will hardly expect me to spare myself. I must disappoint you. I really cannot respond to this demand for mock modesty. I'm not ashamed of my work. In fact, I like explaining its merits to the huge majority who don't know good work from bad. It does them good. And it does me good, curing me of nervousness, laziness, and snobbishness. I leave the delicacies of retirement, therefore, to those who are gentlemen first and literary workmen afterwards. However, I would be less than candid if I did not point out that my play has had its critics, misguided and grossly unfair though they were. I had no difficulty whatever in convincing myself that they were wrong. Let me give you an example.\n\nCaesar's secretary is an ancient Briton. You will remember seeing him in this scene.\n\nCAESAR: Now, Pothinus, to business. I am badly in want of money.\n\nBRITANNUS: My master would say that there is a lawful debt due to Rome by Egypt, contracted by the King's deceased father to the Triumvirate; and that it is Caesar's duty to his country to require immediate payment.\n\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW: What! I can hear you say this man acts, thinks, and talks like a modern Englishman! Precisely; and why shouldn't he? I see no reason to adopt the curious view that an ancient Briton could not possibly have been like a modern one. The character I've portrayed in Britannus represents the normal British type produced by the British climate.\n\nWe have today men of exactly the same stock growing up in Great Britain, in Ireland, and in America. And the result is three of the most distinctly marked nationalities under the sun. I'm told, of course, that it is unscientific to treat national character as a product of climate. This only shows the wide difference between common knowledge and the intellectual game called science. What else? Ah yes, it has been pointed out, by certain pious busybodies, that I seem to intimate in my play that there has been no Progress, with a capital P, since Caesar's time. Quite right, there has been none. The notion that there has been is too absurd for discussion. I have no doubt, however, that you wish to discuss it and that you undoubtedly believe that mankind has struggled through savagery and barbarism up the pyramid of time to the apex which you naively call American civilization.\n\nLet me assure you, you are mistaken. And your mistake stems from two sources: a profound ignorance of the past and an equally profound idealization of the present. All the savagery, barbarism, \"dark ages,\" and the rest of which we have any record as existing in the past exists at the present moment. So, as Brutus remarked to Cassius, \"Chew on that awhile.\" I shall return to this point presently. Meanwhile, on with my play. In the first act, Caesar arrives in Egypt with his legions. The Egyptian army has fled, leaving the palace unguarded. Caesar has come accidentally upon the Queen, Cleopatra, who is only sixteen at the time. Naturally enough she's terrified of the Romans, but Caesar, for reasons of his own, has concealed his identity from her.\n\nCAESAR: What place is this?\n\nCLEOPATRA: This is where I sit on the throne when I'm allowed to wear my crown and robes.\n\nCAESAR: Good, this very night you shall stand here face to face with Caesar. Order the slave to light the lamps.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Do you think I may?\n\nCAESAR: But of course. You are the Queen. Go on.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Light all the lamps.\n\nFTATATEETA: Stop. Who is this you have with you; and how dare you order the lamps to be lighted without my permission?\n\nCAESAR: Who is she?\n\nCLEOPATRA: Ftatateeta.\n\nFTATATEETA: Chief nurse to--\n\nCAESAR: I speak to the Queen. Be silent. Is this how your servants know their places? Send her away; and you do as the Queen has bidden.\n\nYou are the Queen: send her away.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Ftatateeta, dear: you must go away--just for a little.\n\nCAESAR: Augh! You are not commanding her to go: you are begging her. You're no Queen. You will be eaten by Caesar. Farewell.\n\nCLEOPATRA: No, no, no. Don't leave me.\n\nCAESAR: A Roman does not stay with a queen who is afraid of her slaves.\n\nCLEOPATRA: I am not afraid. Indeed I am not afraid.\n\nFTATATEETA: We shall see who is afraid here. Cleopatra--\n\nCAESAR: On your knees, woman: am I also a child that you dare trifle with me? Slave. Can you cut off a head?\n\nHave you remembered yourself, mistress?\n\nFTATATEETA: O Queen, forget not thy servant in the days of thy greatness.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Go. Begone, Go away. Give me something to beat her with.\n\nCAESAR: You scratch, kitten, do you?\n\nCLEOPATRA: I will beat somebody. I will beat him. There, there, there! I am a real Queen at last--a real, real Queen! Cleopatra the Queen!\n\nOh, I love you for making me a Queen.\n\nCAESAR: Ah, but queens love only kings.\n\nCLEOPATRA: I will make all the men I love kings. I will make you a king. I will have many young kings, with round strong arms; and when I am tired of them I will whip them to death; but you will always be my king: my nice, kind, wise, good old king.\n\nCAESAR: Oh, my wrinkles, my wrinkles! And my child's heart! You will be the most dangerous of all Caesar's conquests.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Caesar! I forgot Caesar. You will tell him that I am a Queen, will you not?--a real Queen. Listen, let us run away and hide until Caesar is gone.\n\nCAESAR: If you fear Caesar, you are no true queen; and though you were to hide beneath a pyramid, he would go straight to it and lift it with one hand. And then--ah!\n\nCLEOPATRA: Ah!\n\nCAESAR: But if he thinks you worthy to rule, he will set you on the throne by his side and make you the real ruler of Egypt.\n\nCLEOPATRA: No! He will find me out! He will find me out!\n\n[Music]\n\nWhat's that?\n\nCAESAR: Caesar's voice. He approaches the throne of Cleopatra. Come: take your place. Ho, there, Totateeta. How do you call your slaves?\n\nCLEOPATRA: Clap your hands.\n\nCAESAR: Bring the Queen's robes, and her crown, and her women; and prepare her.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Yes, the crown, Ftatateeta: I shall wear the crown.\n\nFTATATEETA: For whom must the Queen put on her state?\n\nCAESAR: For a citizen of Rome. A king of kings, Totateeta.\n\nCLEOPATRA: How dare you ask questions? Go and do as you are told. Caesar will know that I am a Queen when he sees my crown and robes, will he not?\n\nCAESAR: No. How shall he know that you are not a slave dressed up in the Queen's ornaments?\n\nCLEOPATRA: You must tell him.\n\nCAESAR: He will not ask me. Caesar will know Cleopatra by her pride, her courage, her majesty, and her beauty. Are you trembling?\n\nCLEOPATRA: No.\n\nCAESAR: Hmm!\n\nCLEOPATRA: No.\n\nCAESAR: Hmm.\n\nFTATATEETA: Of all the Queen's women, these three alone are left. The rest are fled.\n\nCAESAR: Good. Three are enough. Poor Caesar generally has to dress himself.\n\nFTATATEETA: The Queen of Egypt is not a Roman barbarian. Be brave, my nursling. Hold up your head before this stranger.\n\nCAESAR: Is it sweet or bitter to be a Queen, Cleopatra?\n\nCLEOPATRA: Bitter.\n\nSLAVE: The Romans are in the courtyard.\n\nCAESAR: The Queen must face Caesar here alone. Answer \"So be it.\"\n\nCLEOPATRA: So be it.\n\nCAESAR: Good.\n\nFTATATEETA: You are my nursling. You have said \"So be it\"; and if you die for it, you must make the Queen's word good.\n\nCAESAR: Now, if you quail--!\n\n[Music]\n\nROMAN SOLDIERS: Hail, Caesar!\n\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW: Now what I am up to in this play, or at least one of the things I am up to, will be clearly understood from that scene. Julius Caesar, intending to conquer Egypt, also intends to leave on the throne of Egypt a ruler friendly to Rome. And that ruler may as well be trained by the person most qualified to do the job--namely, himself. So, he will make Cleopatra a queen in fact and not in name only. And this, to use a fine American expression, will take some doing. When he first meets her, as you've seen, Cleopatra is a frightened young kitten, suited perhaps to be a Girl Scout leader (although this too is questionable), but most certainly not suited to be the queen of a great nation. But when next we see her--after she's spent some considerable time with Caesar--we find a different Cleopatra.\n\nFTATATEETA: Pothinus craves the--\n\nCLEOPATRA: There, there, that will do: Let him come in. Well, Pothinus: what is the latest news from your rebel friends?\n\nPOTHINUS: I am no friend of rebellion. And a prisoner does not receive news.\n\nCLEOPATRA: You are no more a prisoner than I am--than Caesar is. These six months we've been besieged in this palace by my subjects. You are allowed to walk on the beach amongst the soldiers. Can I go further myself, or can Caesar?\n\nPOTHINUS: You are but a child, Cleopatra, and do not understand these matters.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Begone, all of you. I will speak with Pothinus alone. Drive them out, Ftatateeta.\n\nFTATATEETA: Out. Out. Out.\n\nCLEOPATRA: What are you waiting for?\n\nFTATATEETA: It is not meet that the Queen remain alone with--\n\nCLEOPATRA: Ftatateeta: must I sacrifice you to your father's gods to teach you that I am Queen of Egypt, and not you?\n\nNow, Pothinus: why did you bribe Ftatateeta to bring you hither?\n\nPOTHINUS: Cleopatra: what they tell me is true. You are changed.\n\nCLEOPATRA: You speak with Caesar every day for six months: and you will be changed.\n\nPOTHINUS: It is the common talk that you are infatuated with this old man.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Infatuated? What does that mean? Made foolish, is it not? Oh no: I wish I were.\n\nPOTHINUS: You wish you were made foolish? How so?\n\nCLEOPATRA: When I was foolish, I did what I liked, except when Ftatateeta beat me; and even then I cheated her and did it by stealth. Now that Caesar has made me wise, it is no use my liking or disliking: I do what must be done, and have no time to tend to myself. That is not happiness; but it is greatness. If Caesar were gone, I think I could govern the Egyptians; for what Caesar is to me, I am to the fools around me.\n\nPOTHINUS: I do not understand this man.\n\nCLEOPATRA: You understand Caesar! How could you? I do--by instinct.\n\nPOTHINUS: Your Majesty caused me to be admitted today. What message has the Queen for me?\n\nCLEOPATRA: This. You think that by making my brother king, you will rule in Egypt, because you are his guardian and he is a little silly.\n\nPOTHINUS: The Queen is pleased to say so.\n\nCLEOPATRA: The Queen is pleased to say this also. That Caesar will eat up you, and Achillas, and my brother, as a cat eats up mice; and that he will put on this land of Egypt as a shepherd puts on his garment. And when he has done that, he will return to Rome, and leave Cleopatra here as his viceroy.\n\nPOTHINUS: That he shall never do. We have a thousand men to his ten; and we will drive him and his beggarly legions into the sea.\n\nCLEOPATRA: You rant like any common fellow. Go, then, marshal your thousands; and make haste; for Mithridates of Pergamos is at hand with reinforcements for Caesar. Caesar has held you at bay with two legions: we shall see what he will do with twenty.\n\nPOTHINUS: Cleopatra--\n\nCLEOPATRA: Enough, enough: Caesar has spoiled me for talking to weak things like you.\n\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW: And that, you will agree, is a different matter. Cleopatra's education as a ruler is complete. Or is it? Let us see what happens when her actions as a queen are put to the test.\n\nRUFIO: Caesar! The town has gone mad, Caesar. They are for tearing the palace down and driving us into the sea straight away. We laid hold of this renegade in clearing them out of the courtyard.\n\nCAESAR: Release him. What has offended the citizens, Lucius Septimius?\n\nLUCIUS: What did you expect, Caesar? Pothinus was a favorite of theirs.\n\nCAESAR: What has happened to Pothinus? I set him free, here, not half an hour ago. Did they not pass him out?\n\nLUCIUS: Ay, through the gallery arch sixty feet above the ground, with three inches of steel in his ribs. He is as dead as Pompey.\n\nCAESAR: Assassinated?--our prisoner, our guest! Rufio--\n\nRUFIO: Whoever did it was a wise man and a friend of yours; but none of us had a hand in it. So it's no use to frown at me.\n\nCLEOPATRA: He was slain by order of the Queen of Egypt. I am not Julius Caesar the dreamer, who allows every slave to insult him. Rufio has said I did well: now the others shall judge me too. This Pothinus sought to make me conspire with him to betray Caesar to Achillas and Ptolemy. I refused; and he cursed me and came privily to Caesar to accuse me of his own treachery. I caught him in the act; and he insulted me--me, the Queen! to my face! Caesar would not avenge me: he spoke him fair and set him free. Was I right to avenge myself? Speak, Lucius.\n\nLUCIUS: I do not gainsay it. But you will get little thanks from Caesar for it.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Speak, Apollodorus. Was I wrong?\n\nAPOLLODORUS: I have only one word of blame, most beautiful. You should have called upon me, your knight; and in fair duel I should have slain the slanderer.\n\nCLEOPATRA: I will be judged by your very slaves, Caesar. Britannus, was I wrong?\n\nBRITANNUS: Were treachery, falsehood, and disloyalty left unpunished, society must become like an arena full of wild beasts, tearing one another to pieces. Caesar is in the wrong.\n\nCAESAR: For the verdict is against me, it seems.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Listen to me, Caesar. If one man in all Alexandria can be found to say that I did wrong, I swear to have myself crucified on the doors of the palace by my own slaves.\n\nCAESAR: If one man in all the world can be found, now or forever, to know that you did wrong, that man will have either to conquer the world as I have, or be crucified by it. You hear? These knockers at your gate are also believers in vengeance and in stabbing. You have slain their leader: it is right that they shall slay you. If you doubt it, ask your four counsellors here. Then in the name of that right shall I not slay them for murdering their Queen, and be slain in my turn by their countrymen as the invader of their fatherland?\n\nAnd then can Rome do less than avenge her sons and her honor. And so, to the end of history, murder shall breed murder, always in the name of right and honor and peace, until the gods are tired of blood and create a race that can understand. Hearken, you who must not be insulted. Go near enough to catch their words: you'll find them bitterer than the tongue of Pothinus. Let the Queen of Egypt give her orders for vengeance, and take her measures for defence, for she has renounced Caesar.\n\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW: There are four such slayings, murders if you will, which are central to this play, and Caesar's reactions to them are crucial. You've just heard his reaction to the slaying of Pothinus, the Egyptian. Earlier in the play, when he is but recently arrived in Egypt, he is reminded of another slaying which the Egyptians feel he should be grateful for.\n\nPOTHINUS: Remember, Caesar, our first gift to you, as your galley came into the roadstead, was the head of Pompey, your rival for the empire of the world. Bear witness, Lucius Septimius: is it not so?\n\nLUCIUS: It is so. With this hand, that slew Pompey, I placed his head at the feet of Caesar.\n\nCAESAR: Murderer! So would you have slain Caesar, had Pompey been victorious at Pharsalia.\n\nLUCIUS: Woe to the vanquished, Caesar. When I served Pompey, I slew as good men as he, only because he conquered them. His turn came at last.\n\nPOTHINUS: The deed was not yours, Caesar, but ours--nay, mine; for it was done by my counsel. Thanks to us, you keep your reputation for clemency, and have your vengeance too.\n\nCAESAR: Vengeance! Vengeance!! Oh, if I could stoop to vengeance, what would I not exact from you as the price of this murdered man's blood? Was he not my son-in-law, my ancient friend, for twenty years the master of great Rome, for thirty years the compeller of victory? Did not I, as a Roman, share his glory? Was the Fate that forced us to fight for the mastery of the world, of our making? Am I Julius Caesar, or am I a wolf, that you fling to me the grey head of the old soldier, the laurelled conqueror, the mighty Roman, treacherously struck down by this callous ruffian, and then claim my gratitude for it? Begone: you fill me with horror.\n\nLUCIUS: Pshaw! You have seen severed heads before, Caesar, and severed right hands too, I think; some thousands of 'em, in Gaul, after you vanquished Vercingetorix. Did you spare him, with all your clemency? Was that vengeance?\n\nCAESAR: No, by the gods would that it had been! Vengeance at least is human. No, I say: those severed right hands, and the brave Vercingetorix basely strangled in a vault beneath the Capitol, were a wise severity, a necessary protection to the commonwealth, a duty of statesmanship--follies and fictions ten times bloodier than honest vengeance! What a fool was I then! To think that men's lives should be at the mercy of such fools!\n\nLucius Septimius, pardon me: why should the slayer of Vercingetorix rebuke the slayer of Pompey? You are free to go with the rest. Or stay if you will: I will find a place for you in my service.\n\nLUCIUS: The odds are against you, Caesar. I go.\n\n[Music]\n\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW: Now, having absorbed those scenes, let us return with them in mind to the discussion of Progress, with a capital P, which I alluded to earlier. Has it ever occurred to you that the period since Caesar, the so-called Christian era--so excellent in its intentions--has been one of the bloodiest and most discreditable episodes in the history of the human race?\n\nCan the reason be that the moral theory upon which we've been operating has been tragically inadequate? Can it be, in other words, that a civilization founded lock, stock, and barrel on notions of judgment, guilt, innocence, vengeance, reward, and punishment, is doomed to extinction? For these notions saturate our society. I'm fairly certain, for example, that you will applaud the pious sentiments of Caesar's secretary, Britannus, on this point.\n\nBRITANNUS: Were treachery, falsehood, and disloyalty left unpunished, society must become like an arena full of wild beasts, tearing one another to pieces.\n\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW: And so say all of us, \"Vengeance is mine,\" whether we be minister, parent, teacher, judge, or chief of state. And what is the result? We have a so-called civilization in which every individual is thoroughly moralized and patriotized, that conceives of vengeance and retaliation as spiritually nutritious, that punishes the child for being a child, that robs the thief of his liberty and property, that murders the murderer on the gallows or in the electric chair, that makes war in the name of peace. A civilization, in short, that grovels before all sorts of tawdry ideals: social, military, religious, educational. But enough. The Caesar I've re-created will have nothing to do with such vulgarities. The one time he stooped to doing his \"duty\" he deeply repented.\n\nCAESAR: What a fool was I then! To think that men's lives should be at the mercy of such fools!\n\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW: But from then on Caesar put away such foolishness, for he knew it would never lead to the progress of the human species. But, I hear you insist, surely we have progressed since Caesar's time: Look at our radios, our television sets, our great cities. Look, in short, at our command over nature. Indeed! I ask you to consider the stench, the foul air, the smoke, the overcrowding, the racket, the ugliness and pain which these things cost you. But, in any event, such matters have nothing to do with Progress. If you can demonstrate that man today has more command over himself, the sort of thing that Caesar was concerned with, then I will discuss Progress, with a capital P, seriously with you.\n\nBut you cannot, you see. And so we will go on--in the name of \"justice\" and \"peace\" and \"honor.\" And crime will beget crime, murder beget murder, and war beget war until we come to our senses, or until, as Caesar said, the gods tire of blood and create a race that can understand. And so, you see, Caesar's way is the only way. But I give you fair warning. Do not, like Cleopatra, understand Caesar too quickly. To show you what I mean by this warning, there is one more slaying to be considered.\n\n[Music]\n\nCLEOPATRA: Ftatateeta!\n\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW: Well, what about this slaying? For such it was. Caesar does not learn of it until he is taking his leave of Egypt.\n\n[Music]\n\nCLEOPATRA: Has Cleopatra no part in Caesar's leavetaking?\n\nCAESAR: Ah, I knew there was something. How could you let me forget her, Rufio? Had I gone without seeing you, I should never have forgiven myself. Is this mourning for me?\n\nCLEOPATRA: No.\n\nCAESAR: Ah, that was thoughtless of me. It's for your brother.\n\nCLEOPATRA: No.\n\nCAESAR: For whom, then?\n\nCLEOPATRA: Ask the Roman governor whom you have left us.\n\nCAESAR: Rufio?\n\nCLEOPATRA: Yes: Rufio. He who is to rule here in Caesar's name, in Caesar's way, according to Caesar's boasted laws of life.\n\nCAESAR: He is to rule as he can, Cleopatra. He has taken the work upon him, and will do it in his own way.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Not in your way, then?\n\nCAESAR: What do you mean by my way?\n\nCLEOPATRA: Without punishment. Without revenge. Without judgment.\n\nCAESAR: Ay: that is the way, the great way, the only possible way in the end. Believe it Rufio, if you can.\n\nRUFIO: I believe it, Caesar. You convinced me of it long ago. But look you. You are sailing for Numidia today. Now tell me: if you meet a hungry lion there, you will not punish it for wanting to eat you?\n\nCAESAR: No.\n\nRUFIO: Nor revenge upon it the blood of those it has already eaten?\n\nCAESAR: No.\n\nRUFIO: Nor judge it for its guiltiness?\n\nCAESAR: No.\n\nRUFIO: What, then, will you do to save your life from it?\n\nCAESAR: Why, kill it, man, without malice, just as it would kill me. What does this parable of the lion mean?\n\nRUFIO: Well, Cleopatra had a tigress that killed men at her bidding. I thought she might bid it kill you some day. Now, had I not been Caesar's pupil, what pious things might I not have done to that tigress! I might have punished it. I might have revenged Pothinus on it.\n\nCAESAR: Pothinus?\n\nRUFIO: I might have judged it. But I put all these follies behind me; and, without malice, only cut its throat. And that is why Cleopatra comes to you in mourning.\n\nCLEOPATRA: He has shed the blood of my servant Ftatateeta. On your head be it as upon his, Caesar, if you hold him free of it.\n\nCAESAR: On my head be it, then; for it was well done. Rufio: had you set yourself in the seat of a judge, and with hateful ceremonies and appeals to the gods handed that woman over to some hired executioner to be slain before the people in the name of justice, never again would I have touched your hand without a shudder. But this was a natural slaying: I feel no horror at it.\n\nCLEOPATRA: Now: not when a Roman slays an Egyptian. All the world will now see how unjust and corrupt Caesar is.\n\nCAESAR: Come: do not be angry with me. I'm sorry for poor Totateeta.\n\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW: I will let you mull over in your minds his reaction to this slaying. Decide for yourselves whether this reaction was consistent with his philosophy.\n\nCAESAR: I do not think we shall meet again. Farewell.\n\nROMAN SOLDIERS: Hail, Caesar; and farewell! Hail, Caesar!\n\n[Music]"
