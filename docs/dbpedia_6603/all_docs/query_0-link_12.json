        "text": "Genre of largely Italian-made historical or biblical epics\n\nSword-and-sandal, also known as peplum (pl.: pepla), is a subgenre of largely Italian-made historical, mythological, or biblical epics mostly set in the Greco-Roman antiquity or the Middle Ages. These films attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time, such as Samson and Delilah (1949), Quo Vadis (1951), The Robe (1953), The Ten Commandments (1956), Ben-Hur (1959), Spartacus (1960), and Cleopatra (1963).[1] These films dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965, eventually being replaced in 1965 by spaghetti Western and Eurospy films.[2][3]\n\nThe term \"peplum\" (a Latin word referring to the ancient Greek garment peplos), was introduced by French film critics in the 1960s.[2][3] The terms \"peplum\" and \"sword-and-sandal\" were used in a condescending way by film critics. Later, the terms were embraced by fans of the films, similar to the terms \"spaghetti Western\" or \"shoot-'em-ups\". In their English versions, peplum films can be immediately differentiated from their Hollywood counterparts by their use of \"clumsy and inadequate\" English language dubbing.[4] A 100-minute documentary on the history of Italy's peplum genre was produced and directed by Antonio Avati in 1977 titled Kolossal: i magnifici Macisti (aka Kino Kolossal).[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]\n\nGenre characteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nSword-and-sandal films are a specific class of Italian adventure films that have subjects set in Biblical or classical antiquity, often with plots based more or less loosely on Greco-Roman history or the other contemporary cultures of the time, such as the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Etruscans, as well as medieval times. Not all of the films were fantasy-based by any means. Many of the plots featured actual historical personalities such as Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, and Hannibal, although great liberties were taken with the storylines. Gladiators and slaves rebelling against tyrannical rulers, pirates and swashbucklers were also popular subjects.\n\nAs Robert Rushing defines it, peplum, \"in its most stereotypical form, [...] depicts muscle-bound heroes (professional bodybuilders, athletes, wrestlers, or brawny actors) in mythological antiquity, fighting fantastic monsters and saving scantily clad beauties. Rather than lavish epics set in the classical world, they are low-budget films that focus on the hero's extraordinary body.\"[13] Thus, most sword-and-sandal films featured a superhumanly strong man as the protagonist, such as Hercules, Samson, Goliath, Ursus or Italy's own popular folk hero Maciste. In addition, the plots typically involved two women vying for the affection of the bodybuilder hero: the good love interest (a damsel in distress needing rescue), and an evil femme fatale queen who sought to dominate the hero.\n\nAlso, the films typically featured an ambitious ruler who would ascend the throne by murdering those who stood in his path, and often it was only the muscular hero who could depose him. Thus the hero's often political goal: \"to restore a legitimate sovereign against an evil dictator.\"[14]\n\nMany of the peplum films involved a clash between two populations, one civilized and the other barbaric, which typically included a scene of a village or city being burned to the ground by invaders. For their musical content, most films contained a colorful dancing girls sequence, meant to underline pagan decadence.\n\nPrecursors of the sword-and-sandal wave (pre-1958)\n\n[edit]\n\nItalian films of the silent era\n\n[edit]\n\nItalian filmmakers paved the way for the peplum genre with some of the earliest silent films dealing with the subject, including the following:\n\nThe Sack of Rome (1905)\n\nAgrippina (1911)\n\nThe Fall of Troy (1911)\n\nThe Queen of Nineveh (1911, directed by Luigi Maggi)\n\nBrutus (1911)\n\nQuo Vadis (1913, directed by Enrico Guazzoni)\n\nAntony and Cleopatra (1913)\n\nCabiria (1914, directed by Giovanni Pastrone)\n\nJulius Caesar (1914)\n\nSaffo (Sappho, 1918, directed by Antonio Molinari)\n\nThe Crusaders (1918)\n\nFabiola (1918) directed by Enrico Guazzoni\n\nAttila (1919, directed by F. Mari)\n\nVenere (Venus, 1919, directed by Antonio Molinari)\n\nIl mistero di Osiris (The Mystery of Osiris, 1919) directed by Antonio Molinari\n\nGiuliano l'Apostata (1919, directed by Ugo Falena)\n\nGiuditta e Oloferne (Judith and Holofernes, 1920) directed by Antonio Molinari\n\nThe Sack of Rome, (1920) directed by Enrico Guazzoni\n\nSamson (1923 film)\n\nMessalina, (1924) directed by Enrico Guazzoni\n\nGli ultimi giorni di Pompei (The Last Days of Pompeii (1926) directed by Carmine Gallone and Amleto Palermi)[15]\n\nThe silent Maciste films (1914â€“1927)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1914 Italian silent film Cabiria was one of the first films set in antiquity to make use of a massively muscled character, Maciste (played by actor Bartolomeo Pagano), who served in this premiere film as the hero's slavishly loyal sidekick. Maciste became the public's favorite character in the film however, and Pagano was called back many times to reprise the role. The Maciste character appeared in at least two dozen Italian silent films from 1914 through 1926, all of which featured a protagonist named Maciste although the films were set in many different time periods and geographical locations.\n\nHere is a complete list of the silent Maciste films in chronological order:\n\nCabiria (1914) introduced the Maciste character\n\nMaciste (1915) a.k.a. \"The Marvelous Maciste\"\n\nMaciste bersagliere (\"Maciste the Ranger\", 1916)\n\nMaciste alpino (\"Maciste The Warrior\", 1916)\n\nMaciste atleta (\"Maciste the Athlete\", 1917)\n\nMaciste medium (\"Maciste the Clairvoyant\", 1917)\n\nMaciste poliziotto (\"Maciste the Detective\", 1917)\n\nMaciste turista (\"Maciste the Tourist\", 1917)\n\nMaciste sonnambulo (\"Maciste the Sleepwalker\", 1918)\n\nLa Rivincita di Maciste (\"The Revenge of Maciste\", 1919)\n\nIl Testamento di Maciste (\"Maciste's Will\", 1919)\n\nIl Viaggio di Maciste (\"Maciste's Journey\", 1919)\n\nMaciste I (\"Maciste the First\", 1919)\n\nMaciste contro la morte (\"Maciste vs Death\", 1919)\n\nMaciste innamorato (\"Maciste in Love\", 1919)\n\nMaciste in vacanza (\"Maciste on Vacation\", 1920)\n\nMaciste salvato dalle acque (\"Maciste Rescued from the Waters\", 1920)\n\nMaciste e la figlia del re della plata (\"Maciste and the Silver King's Daughter\", 1922)\n\nMaciste und die Japanerin (\"Maciste and the Japanese\", 1922)\n\nMaciste contro Maciste (\"Maciste vs. Maciste\", 1923)\n\nMaciste und die chinesische truhe (\"Maciste and the Chinese Trunk\", 1923)\n\nMaciste e il nipote di America (\"Maciste's American Nephew\", 1924)\n\nMaciste imperatore (\"Emperor Maciste\", 1924)\n\nMaciste contro lo sceicco (\"Maciste vs. the Sheik\", 1925)\n\nMaciste all'inferno (\"Maciste in Hell\", 1925)\n\nMaciste nella gabbia dei leoni (\"Maciste in the Lions' Den\", 1926)\n\nil Gigante delle Dolemite (\"The Giant From the Dolomite\", released in 1927)\n\nItalian fascist and post-war historical epics (1937-1956)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Italian film industry released several historical films in the early sound era, such as the big-budget Scipione l'Africano (Scipio Africanus: The Defeat of Hannibal) in 1937, written by Mussolini's son Vittorio, and heavily financed by his fascist government.[16] In 1949, the postwar Italian film industry remade Fabiola (which had been previously filmed twice in the silent era). The film was released in the United Kingdom and in the United States in 1951 in an edited, English-dubbed version. Fabiola was an Italian-French co-production like the following films The Last Days of Pompeii (1950) and Messalina (1951).\n\nDuring the 1950s, a number of American historical epics shot in Italy were released. In 1951, MGM producer Sam Zimbalist cleverly used the lower production costs, use of frozen funds and the expertise of the Italian film industry to shoot the large-scale Technicolor epic Quo Vadis in Rome. In addition to its fictional account linking the Great Fire of Rome, the Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire and Emperor Nero, the film - following the novel \"Quo vadis\" by the Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz - featured also a mighty protagonist named Ursus (Italian filmmakers later made several pepla in the 1960s exploiting the Ursus character). MGM also planned Ben Hur to be filmed in Italy as early as 1952.[17]\n\nRiccardo Freda's Sins of Rome was filmed in 1953 and released by RKO in an edited, English-dubbed version the following year. Unlike Quo Vadis, there were no American actors or production crew. The Anthony Quinn film Attila (directed by Pietro Francisci in 1954), the Kirk Douglas epic Ulysses (co-directed by an uncredited Mario Bava in 1954) and Helen of Troy (directed by Robert Wise with Sergio Leone as an uncredited second unit director in 1955) were the first of the big peplum films of the 1950s. Riccardo Freda directed another peplum, Theodora, Slave Empress in 1954, starring his wife Gianna Maria Canale. Howard Hawks directed his Land of the Pharaohs (starring Joan Collins) in Italy and Egypt in 1955. Robert Rossen made his film Alexander the Great in Egypt in 1956, with a music score by famed Italian composer Mario Nascimbene.\n\nThe main sword-and-sandal period (1958-1965)\n\n[edit]\n\nTo cash in on the success of the Kirk Douglas film Ulysses, Pietro Francisci planned to make a film about Hercules, but searched unsuccessfully for years for a physically convincing yet experienced actor. His daughter spotted American bodybuilder Steve Reeves in the American film Athena and he was hired to play Hercules in 1957 when the film was made. (Reeves was paid $10,000 to star in the film).[18][19]\n\nThe genre's instantaneous growth began with the U.S. theatrical release of Hercules in 1959. American producer Joseph E. Levine acquired the U.S. distribution rights for $120,000, spent $1 million promoting the film and made more than $5 million profit.[20] This spawned the 1959 Steve Reeves sequel Hercules Unchained, the 1959 re-release of Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah (1949), and dozens of imitations that followed in their wake. Italian filmmakers resurrected their 1920s Maciste character in a brand new 1960s sound film series (1960â€“1964), followed rapidly by Ursus, Samson, Goliath and various other mighty-muscled heroes.\n\nAlmost all peplum films of this period featured bodybuilder stars, the most popular being Steve Reeves, Reg Park and Gordon Scott.[21] Some of these stars, such as Mickey Hargitay, Reg Lewis, Mark Forest, Gordon Mitchell and Dan Vadis, had starred in Mae West's touring stage review in the United States in the 1950s.[21] Bodybuilders of Italian origin, on the other hand, would adopt English pseudonyms for the screen; thus, stuntman Sergio Ciani became Alan Steel, and ex-gondolier Adriano Bellini was called Kirk Morris.[21]\n\nTo be sure, many of the films enjoyed widespread popularity among general audiences, and had production values that were typical for popular films of their day. Some films included frequent re-use of the impressive film sets that had been created for Ben-Hur and Cleopatra.\n\nAlthough many of the bigger budget pepla were released theatrically in the US, fourteen of them were released directly to Embassy Pictures television in a syndicated TV package called The Sons of Hercules. Since few American viewers had a familiarity with Italian film heroes such as Maciste or Ursus, the characters were renamed[21] and the films molded into a series of sorts by splicing on the same opening and closing theme song and newly designed voice-over narration that attempted to link the protagonist of each film to the Hercules mythos. These films ran on Saturday afternoons in the 1960s.\n\nPeplum films were, and still are, often ridiculed for their low budgets and bad English dubbing. The contrived plots, poorly overdubbed dialogue, novice acting skills of the bodybuilder leads, and primitive special effects that were often inadequate to depict the mythological creatures on screen all conspire to give these films a certain camp appeal now. In the 1990s, several of them have been subjects of riffing and satire in the United States comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n\nHowever, in the early 1960s, a group of French critics, mostly writing for the Cahiers du cinÃ©ma, such as Luc Moullet, started to celebrate the genre and some of its directors, including Vittorio Cottafavi, Riccardo Freda, Mario Bava, Pietro Francisci, Duccio Tessari, and Sergio Leone.[22] Not only directors, but also some of the screenwriters, often put together in teams, worked past the typically formulaic plot structure to include a mixture of \"bits of philosophical readings and scraps of psychoanalysis, reflections on the biggest political systems, the fate of the world and humanity, fatalistic notions of accepting the will of destiny and the gods, anthropocentric belief in the powers of the human physique, and brilliant syntheses of military treatises\".[23]\n\nWith reference to the genre's free use of ancient mythology and other influences, Italian director Vittorio Cottafavi, who directed a number of peplum films, used the term \"neo-mythologism\".[24]\n\nHercules series (1958â€“1965)\n\n[edit]\n\nA series of 19 Hercules movies were made in Italy in the late '50s and early '60s. The films were all sequels to the successful Steve Reeves peplum Hercules (1958), but with the exception of Hercules Unchained, each film was a stand-alone story not connected to the others. The actors who played Hercules in these films were Steve Reeves followed by Gordon Scott, Kirk Morris, Mickey Hargitay, Mark Forest, Alan Steel, Dan Vadis, Brad Harris, Reg Park, Peter Lupus (billed as Rock Stevens) and Mike Lane. In a 1997 interview, Reeves said he felt his two Hercules films could not be topped by another sequel, so he declined to do any more Hercules films.[25]\n\nThe films are listed below by their American release titles, and the titles in parentheses are their original Italian titles with an approximate English translation. Dates shown are the original Italian theatrical release dates, not the U.S. release dates (which were years later in some cases).\n\nHercules (Le fatiche di Ercole / The Labors of Hercules, 1958) starring Steve Reeves\n\nHercules Unchained (Ercole e la regina di Lidia / Hercules and the Queen of Lydia, 1959) starring Steve Reeves\n\nGoliath and the Dragon (La vendetta di Ercole / The Revenge of Hercules, 1960) starring Mark Forest as Hercules (Hercules' name was changed to Goliath when this film was dubbed in English and distributed in the U.S.)\n\nHercules Vs The Hydra (Gli amori di Ercole / The Loves of Hercules, 1960) co-starring Mickey Hargitay (as Hercules) and Jayne Mansfield\n\nHercules and the Captive Women (Ercole alla conquista di Atlantide / Hercules at the Conquest of Atlantis, 1961) starring Reg Park as Hercules (alternate U.S. title: Hercules and the Haunted Women)\n\nHercules in the Haunted World (Ercole al centro della terra / Hercules at the Center of the Earth, 1961) directed by Mario Bava, starring Reg Park as Hercules\n\nHercules in the Vale of Woe (Maciste contro Ercole nella valle dei guai / Maciste vs Hercules in the Vale of Woe) comedy starring Frank Gordon as Hercules, 1961\n\nUlysses Against the Son of Hercules (Ulisse contro Ercole / Ulysses vs. Hercules) starring Mike Lane as Hercules, 1962\n\nThe Fury of Hercules (La furia di Ercole / The Fury of Hercules) starring Brad Harris as Hercules, 1962 (alternate U.S. title: The Fury of Samson)\n\nHercules, Samson and Ulysses (Ercole sfida Sansone / Hercules Challenges Samson) starring Kirk Morris as Hercules, 1963\n\nHercules Against Moloch (Ercole contro Molock / Hercules vs. Molock) starring Gordon Scott as Hercules, 1963 (a.k.a.

Hercules vs. the Sea Monster; this U.S./ Italian co-production was made as a pilot for a Charles Band-produced TV series that never materialized and it was later distributed as a feature film)\n\nHercules the Avenger (Sfida dei giganti / Challenge of the Giants) starring Reg Park as Hercules, 1965 (this film was composed mostly of re-edited footage from the two 1961 Reg Park Hercules films)\n\nA number of English-dubbed Italian films that featured the word \"Hercules\" in the title were not made as Hercules movies originally, such as:\n\nHercules Against the Moon Men, Hercules Against the Barbarians, Hercules Against the Mongols and Hercules of the Desert were all originally Maciste films. (See \"Maciste\" section below)\n\nHercules and the Black Pirate and Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas were both re-titled Samson movies. (See \"Samson\" section below)\n\nHercules, Prisoner of Evil was actually a re-titled Ursus film. (See \"Ursus\" section below)\n\nHercules and the Masked Rider was actually a re-titled Goliath movie. (See \"Goliath\" section below)\n\nNone of these films in their original Italian versions involved the Hercules character in any way. Likewise, most of the Sons of Hercules movies shown on American TV in the 1960s had nothing to do with Hercules in their original Italian versions.\n\n(see also The Three Stooges Meet Hercules (1962), an American-made genre parody starring peplum star Samson Burke as Hercules)\n\nGoliath series (1959â€“1964)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Italians used Goliath as the superhero protagonist in a series of adventure films (pepla) in the early 1960s. He was a man possessed of amazing strength, although he seemed to be a different person in each film. After the classic Hercules (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, a 1959 Steve Reeves film Il terrore dei barbari (Terror of the Barbarians) was re-titled Goliath and the Barbarians in the U.S. The film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a generic beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not related to each other in any way (the 1960 Italian peplum David and Goliath starring Orson Welles was not part of this series, since that movie was just a historical retelling of the Biblical story).\n\nThe titles in the Italian Goliath adventure series were as follows: (the first title listed for each film is the film's original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses)\n\nIl terrore dei barbari / Terror of the Barbarians (1959) (Goliath and the Barbarians in the U.S.), starring Steve Reeves as Goliath (although he is referred to as \"Emiliano\" in the original Italian-language version)\n\nGoliath contro i giganti / Goliath Against the Giants (Goliath Against the Giants) (1960) starring Brad Harris\n\nGoliath e la schiava ribelle / Goliath and the Rebel Slave (Tyrant of Lydia Against The Son of Hercules) (1963) starring Gordon Scott\n\nGolia e il cavaliere mascherato / Goliath and the Masked Rider (Hercules and the Masked Rider) (1964) starring Alan Steel (note: Goliath is referred to as \"Hercules\" in English-dubbed prints)\n\nGolia alla conquista di Bagdad / Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad (Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus, 1964) starring Rock Stevens (aka Peter Lupus)\n\nThe name Goliath was also inserted into the English titles of three other Italian pepla that were re-titled for U.S. distribution in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as \"Goliath movies\" in Italy.\n\nBoth Goliath and the Vampires (1961) and Goliath and the Sins of Babylon (1963) actually featured the famed Italian folk hero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors did not feel the name \"Maciste\" meant anything to American audiences.\n\nGoliath and the Dragon (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules movie called The Revenge of Hercules, but it was re-titled Goliath and the Dragon in the U.S. since at the time Goliath and the Barbarians was breaking box-office records, and the distributors may have thought the name \"Hercules\" was trademarked by distributor Joseph E. Levine.\n\nMaciste series (1960â€“1965)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Maciste\n\nThere were a total of 25 Maciste films from the 1960s peplum craze (not counting the two dozen silent Maciste films made in Italy pre-1930). By 1960, seeing how well the two Steve Reeves Hercules films were doing at the box office, Italian producers decided to revive the 1920s silent film character Maciste in a new series of color/sound films. Unlike the other Italian peplum protagonists, Maciste found himself in a variety of time periods ranging from the Ice Age to 16th century Scotland. Maciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed. However, in the first film of the 1960s series, he mentions to another character that the name \"Maciste\" means \"born of the rock\" (almost as if he was a god who would just appear out of the earth itself in times of need). One of the 1920s silent Maciste films was actually titled The Giant from the Dolomite, hinting that Maciste may be more god than man, which would explain his great strength.\n\nThe first title listed for each film is the film's original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses (note how many times Maciste's name in the Italian title is altered to an entirely different name in the American title):\n\nMaciste nella valle dei re / Maciste in the Valley of the Kings (Son of Samson, 1960) a.k.a.

The Invincible Gladiators, starring Richard Lloyd as Maciste\n\nMaciste il Vendicatore dei Mayas / Maciste, Avenger of the Mayans (has no American title, 1965) (Note:* this Maciste film was made up almost entirely of re-edited stock footage from two older Maciste films, Maciste contro i mostri and Maciste contro i cacciatori di teste, so Maciste switches from Kirk Morris to Reg Lewis in various scenes; this movie is very scarce since it was never distributed in the U.S. and is apparently not even available in English)\n\nIn 1973, the Spanish cult film director Jesus Franco directed two low-budget \"Maciste films\" for French producers: Maciste contre la Reine des Amazones (Maciste vs the Queen of the Amazons) and Les exploits Ã©rotiques de Maciste dans l'Atlantide (The Erotic Exploits of Maciste in Atlantis). The films had almost identical casts, both starring Val Davis as Maciste, and appear to have been shot back-to-back. The former was distributed in Italy as a \"Karzan\" movie (a cheap Tarzan imitation), while the latter film was released only in France with hardcore inserts as Les Gloutonnes (\"The Gobblers\"). These two films were totally unrelated to the 1960s Italian Maciste series.\n\nUrsus series (1960â€“1964)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ursus (film character)\n\nFollowing Buddy Baer's portrayal of Ursus in the classic 1951 film Quo Vadis, Ursus was used as a superhuman Roman-era character who became the protagonist in a series of Italian adventure films made in the early 1960s.\n\nWhen the \"Hercules\" film craze hit in 1959, Italian filmmakers were looking for other muscleman characters similar to Hercules whom they could exploit, resulting in the nine-film Ursus series listed below. Ursus was referred to as a \"Son of Hercules\" in two of the films when they were dubbed in English (in an attempt to cash in on the then-popular \"Hercules\" craze), although in the original Italian films, Ursus had no connection to Hercules whatsoever. In the English-dubbed version of one Ursus film (retitled Hercules, Prisoner of Evil), Ursus was actually referred to throughout the entire film as \"Hercules\".\n\nThere were a total of nine Italian films that featured Ursus as the main character, listed below as follows: Italian title / English translation of the Italian title (American release title);\n\nUrsus / Ursus (Ursus, Son of Hercules, 1960) a.k.a. Mighty Ursus (United Kingdom), starring Ed Fury\n\nLa Vendetta di Ursus / The Revenge of Ursus (The Vengeance of Ursus, 1961) starring Samson Burke\n\nUrsus e la Ragazza Tartara / Ursus and the Tartar Girl (Ursus and the Tartar Princess, 1961) a.k.a. The Tartar Invasion, a.k.a. The Tartar Girl; starring Joe Robinson, Akim Tamiroff, Yoko Tani; directed by Remigio Del Grosso\n\nUrsus Nella Valle dei Leoni / Ursus in the Valley of the Lions (Valley of the Lions, 1962) starring Ed Fury; this film revealed the origin story of Ursus\n\nUrsus il gladiatore ribelle / Ursus the Rebel Gladiator (The Rebel Gladiators, 1962) starring Dan Vadis\n\nUrsus Nella Terra di Fuoco / Ursus in the Land of Fire (Son of Hercules in the Land of Fire, 1963) a.k.a. Son of Atlas in the Land of Fire; starring Ed Fury\n\nUrsus il terrore dei Kirghisi / Ursus, the Terror of the Kirghiz (Hercules, Prisoner of Evil, 1964) starring Reg Park\n\nErcole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus: gli invincibili / Hercules, Samson, Maciste and Ursus: The Invincibles (Samson and His Mighty Challenge, 1964) starring Yan Larvor as Ursus (a.k.a. Combate dei Gigantes or Le Grand Defi)\n\nGli Invincibili Tre / The Invincible Three (Three Avengers, 1964) starring Alan Steel as Ursus\n\nSamson series (1961â€“1964)\n\n[edit]\n\nA character named Samson was featured in a series of five Italian peplum films in the 1960s, no doubt inspired by the 1959 re-release of the epic Victor Mature film Samson and Delilah. The character was similar to the Biblical Samson in the third and fifth films only; in the other three, he just appears to be a very strong man (not related at all to the Biblical figure).\n\nThe titles are listed as follows: Italian title / its English translation (U.S. release title in parentheses);\n\nSansone / Samson (1961 Italian film) (Samson) 1961, starring Brad Harris\n\nSansone contro i pirati / Samson Against the Pirates (Samson and the Sea Beast) 1963, starring Kirk Morris\n\nErcole sfida Sansone / Hercules challenges Samson (Hercules, Samson and Ulysses) 1963, starring Richard Lloyd\n\nSansone contro il corsaro nero / Samson Against the Black Pirate (Hercules and the Black Pirate) 1963, starring Alan Steel\n\nErcole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus: gli invincibili / Hercules, Samson, Maciste and Ursus: The Invincibles (Samson and the Mighty Challenge) 1964, starring Nadir Baltimore as Samson (a.k.a. Samson and His Mighty Challenge, Combate dei Gigantes or Le Grand DÃ©fi)\n\nThe name Samson was also inserted into the U.S. titles of six other Italian movies when they were dubbed in English for U.S. distribution, although these films actually featured the adventures of the famed Italian folk hero Maciste.\n\nSamson Against the Sheik (1962), Son of Samson (1960), Samson and the Slave Queen (1963), Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World (1961), Samson vs. the Giant King (1964), and Samson in King Solomon's Mines (1964) were all re-titled Maciste movies, because the American distributors did not feel the name Maciste was marketable to U.S. filmgoers.\n\nSamson and the Treasure of the Incas (a.k.a. Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas) (1965) sounds like a peplum title, but was actually a spaghetti Western.\n\nThe Sons of Hercules (TV syndication package)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The Sons of Hercules\n\nThe Sons of Hercules was a syndicated television show that aired in the United States in the 1960s. The series repackaged 14 randomly chosen Italian peplum films by unifying them with memorable title and end title theme songs and a standard voice-over intro relating the main hero in each film to Hercules any way they could. In some regions, each film was split into two one-hour episodes, so the 14 films were shown as 28 weekly episodes. None of the films were ever theatrically released in the U.S.\n\nThe films are not listed in chronological order, since they were not really related to each other in any way. The first title listed below for each film was its American broadcast television title, followed in parentheses by the English translation of its original Italian theatrical title:\n\nUrsus, Son of Hercules (Ursus) 1961, starring Ed Fury, a.k.a. Mighty Ursus in England\n\nMole Men vs the Son of Hercules (Maciste, the Strongest Man in the World) 1961, starring Mark Forest\n\nTriumph of the Son of Hercules (The Triumph of Maciste) 1961, starring Kirk Morris\n\nFire Monsters Against the Son of Hercules (Maciste vs. the Monsters) 1962, starring Reg Lewis\n\nVenus Against the Son of Hercules (Mars, God Of War) 1962, starring Roger Browne\n\nUlysses Against the Son of Hercules (Ulysses against Hercules) 1962, starring Mike Lane\n\nMedusa Against the Son of Hercules (Perseus The Invincible) 1962, starring Richard Harrison\n\nSon of Hercules in the Land of Fire (Ursus In The Land Of Fire) 1963, starring Ed Fury\n\nTyrant of Lydia Against The Son of Hercules (Goliath and the Rebel Slave) 1963, starring Gordon Scott\n\nMessalina Against the Son of Hercules (The Last Gladiator) 1963, starring Richard Harrison\n\nThe Beast of Babylon Against the Son of Hercules (Hero of Babylon) 1963, starring Gordon Scott, a.k.a.

The Slave Merchants, a.k.a. Soraya, Queen of the Desert\n\nSteve Reeves pepla (in chronological order of production)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Steve Reeves\n\nSteve Reeves appeared in 14 pepla made in Italy from 1958 to 1964, and most of his films are highly regarded examples of the genre. His pepla are listed below in order of production, not in order of release. The U.S. release titles are shown below, followed by the original Italian title and its translation (in parentheses)\n\nHercules (1958) (Le fatiche di Ercole / The Labors of Hercules) actually filmed in 1957, released in Italy in 1958, released in the U.S. in 1959\n\nHercules Unchained (1959) (Ercole e la regina di Lidia / Hercules and the Queen of Lydia) released in the U.S. in 1960\n\nGoliath and the Barbarians (1959) (Il terrore dei barbari / Terror of the Barbarians)\n\nThe Giant of Marathon (1959) (La battaglia di Maratona / The Battle of Marathon)\n\nThe Last Days of Pompeii (1959) (Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei / The Last Days of Pompeii)\n\nThe White Warrior (1959) (Hadji Murad il Diavolo Bianco / Hadji Murad, The White Devil) directed by Riccardo Freda\n\nMorgan, the Pirate (1960) (Morgan, il pirata/ Morgan, the Pirate)\n\nThe Thief of Baghdad (1960) (Il Ladro di Bagdad / The Thief of Baghdad)\n\nThe Trojan Horse (1961) (La guerra di Troia/ The Trojan War)\n\nDuel of the Titans (1961) (Romolo e Remo / Romulus And Remus)\n\nThe Slave (1962) (Il Figlio di Spartaco / Son of Spartacus)\n\nThe Avenger (1962) (La leggenda di Enea / The Legend Of Aeneas) a.k.a.

Many were of the Cappa e spada (swashbuckler) variety, though they often feature well-known characters such as Ali Baba, Julius Caesar, Ulysses, Cleopatra, the Three Musketeers, Zorro, Theseus, Perseus, Achilles, Robin Hood, and Sandokan.

Then in 1982, the box-office successes of Jean-Jacques Annaud's Quest for Fire (1981), Arnold Schwarzenegger's Conan the Barbarian (1982) and Clash of the Titans (1981 film) (1981) spurred a second renaissance of sword and sorcery Italian pepla in the five years immediately following. Most of these films had low budgets, focusing more on barbarians and pirates so as to avoid the need for expensive Greco-Roman sets. The filmmakers tried to compensate for their shortcomings with the addition of some graphic gore and nudity. Many of these 1980s entries were helmed by noted Italian horror film directors (Joe D'Amato, Lucio Fulci, Luigi Cozzi, etc.) and many featured actors Lou Ferrigno, Miles O'Keeffe and Sabrina Siani. Here is a list of the 1980s pepla:\n\nAdam and Eve (1983) a.k.a. Adamo ed Eva, la prima storia d'amore, contains stock footage from One Million Years B.C.
