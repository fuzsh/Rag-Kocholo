        "text": "The royal “we” unifies the nation, the land and its people, into the symbolic body of the monarch. This weekend at the University Theater in New Haven, Karin Coonrod’s Compagnia de’ Colombari is staging the most innovative version of Shakespeare’s great tragedy of monarchy that I’ve seen in a long time. See better, Lear, the play commands. But what if everywhere we look we see many things?\n\nThe production’s brilliant and generative coup de theatre – ten Kings in ten paper crowns all playing the title role – mounted to a takeover of the entire space of the theater, with actors playing Lear speaking from all three aisles, in front of the stage, and along several rows of blocked-off seats. No King spoke more than two or three lines at the start, so that when Tony Torn open-facedly importuned his daughters, “Which of you shall we say doth love us most?” (1.1), he quickly passed the next lines (“Where nature doth with merit challenge”) to another King, even before we in our seats had time to register the audacity and greed of the question. The King needed something, wanted something, but as his lines ping-ponged around the theater, as we absorbed the selfishness of the love test, we watched that royal “we,” the King as community, voicing itself into disorderly being. It made thrilling theater.\n\nOne of the consequences of pluralizing the monumental title role of the play was to slip the King out of our moral grasp. When he’s just one man, even a big star like Ian McKellen or Derek Jacobi, it hard not to blame Lear for cluelessness and cruelty. When he’s all around us and speaking in ten voices, the distributed King becomes both a part of community and trapped by collectivity, locked inside his “fixed purpose laid with iron rails,” to borrow from a maritime monomaniac who is himself modeled on King Lear. All the paper-crowned Lears in this production together produced a collective that each King’s titanic ego could not help being bound into.\n\nAs I perhaps over-enthusiastically said after the show to my friend & fellow Shakespearean Mike Shea, the opening scene in King Lear is the best scene in all of English drama – and I don’t think I’ve seen a more exciting performance of that scene than this one.\n\nThe “nothing” that the Kings and Cordelia batted back and forth at the opening seemed in this articulation to represent some kind of escape. If Cordelia could hold to her bond – “Love, and be silent” – could she avoid the rhetorical dance of hypocrisy and manipulation, in which it would be in any case impossible to match her ruthless sisters? Seldom has a trip from England to France seemed so good!\n\nAll the actors in Colombari’s cast were excellent,and they worked together with generosity and visible pleasure. I was especially appreciative of Tony Torn’s evocative mixture of Oswald and the King, not only because he and his partner, my St. John’s colleague Lee Ann Brown, joined us for dinner before the show. I’ll hear his plaintive “love us the most” whenever I think about this line. Abigail Killeen’s Goneril/Lear absorbed the brutality of her father’s wrath, in which he cursed her “organs of increase” and her future progeny, with heartbreaking silence. Jo Mei’s sharp-edged Regan/Lear digested her husband Cornwall’s part, meaning that she got to extract the “vile jelly” of Gloucester’s eyes in the latter half of the action. Julian Elijah Martinez’s crowd-pleasing Edmund had everyone ready to to take the bastard’s part. Paul Pryce’s wonderfully physical Kent/Lear brought comic and moral force – and like almost everyone I talked with after the show, I was entranced by Luka Papenfusscline’s musical Fool/Lear. Their ethereal voice made the Fool into Lear’s self-reflection and internal choral experiment, a way to think and sing through the crisis of personality that befell the King who misplaced his kingdom.\n\nThe spatial takeover, in which the actors occupied the seats and the aisles, climaxed at the play’s raging center, when the Kings walked alone into the storm, and as a chorus intonde together the great speech that I interpret as Shakespeare’s proleptic imagination of what it’s like to live inside the disorderly environment of the Anthropocene:\n\nBlow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!\n\nYou cataracts and hurricanoes, spout\n\nTill you have drench’d our steeples, drown’d the cocks!\n\nYou sulph’rous and thought-executing fires,\n\nVaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,\n\nSinge my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,\n\nStrike flat the thick rotundity o’ th’ world,\n\nCrack Nature’s moulds, all germains spill at once,\n\nThat makes ingrateful man! (3.2)\n\n(For more on the storm and the Anthropocene, come to my Ideas Panel with Tara Bradway and David Sterling Brown, on the Green Tuesday June 18 at noon!)\n\nAfter the storm, the curtain finally opened and the remainder of the play’s action took place on the stage, or, in the case of the mock-trial of Goneril and Regan, on the front apron. There was some great stuff in these later acts, including the blinding of Gloucester and the Dover Cliff meta-theater. In some ways, however, by placing all the actors back on the same horizontal plane, distant from the audience, rather than distributing voices and bodies amongst our seats, the action felt slightly removed. Even the on-stage deaths, each one removing one more Lear from the chorus, were somehow less immediate than the preceding whirligig of immersion. The death of Oswald, slain in combat by knightly Edgar as the true brother began the campaign that would lead to his defeat of his false brother Edmund, provided real pathos, thanks again to Tony Torn’s wonderfully emotive work. But when Oswald slumped down into death, I missed his contributions to the chorus of kings. Torn would get up and lend his voice to the final scene, but as Lear, not Oswald. Part of the genius of Coonrod’s gambit was to suggest that when he and all the other actors had previously voiced Lear’s lines, they did so both as an actor playing Lear and also through their other roles, in Torn’s case as Oswald, the abused child of the kingdom.\n\nI love an intermissionless fast Shakespeare, and I have no complaints about necessary cuts, even though Cornwall and Albany are both interesting figures. But two-plus a bit hours is a long time to sit rapt, and there were moments in the second half when I drifted. I wondered a bit if letting just one Lear – Tom Neils, who also played the King of France – hold center stage for so long dulled the palate just a bit. I was starting to miss the community of kings!\n\nThey all reunited for the end, whispering together the painful “howls” and “nevers” which consign Cordelia’s body, “dead as earth,” to rest. The best and most re-orienting moments in this production, which I’m excited to see two more times over its short weekend run, featured all the Kings together, either parceling out lines one to the next (1.1) or chorusing them together (5.3).\n\nSome questions remain too painful to answer. “Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,” the Kings croon at Cordelia’s lifeless form, “And thou no breath at all?” (5.3)\n\nGet to the University Theater before it closes on Sunday night!\n\nIt’s out in the world! I mean the world that this map maps –\n\nI find it hard to believe, and a little daunting, that this strange fish and passion project poetry book has now embarked on the worldsea, in a beautiful printed package from Fordham University Press.\n\nI hope lots of people will read this (reasonably priced and beautiful paperback) book, and I’m going to do a decent amount of marketing for it, as far as I know how to do that. A podcast with the New Books Network should be forthcoming soon! A reading in South Street Seaport in May! Copies at various places I’m going to talk about various things, from Portland, to Vancouver, to Bremen and Jena in Germany.\n\nToday I want to introduce the amazing, brilliant map that John Wyatt Greenlee of Surprised Eel Mapping made for the book.\n\nThe book entangles an Ahab-free version of the voyage of Melville’s whaleship with my own immersive practice as swimmer and writer along the Connecticut Shoreline. I wanted a map to show that enmeshment, but I didn’t know how. I also wanted a sea monster someplace in the image. So I reached out to John, who I knew mainly as purveyor of eel-facts on Twitter.\n\nWe went back and forth about the design. Some early versions were messy. I wanted a dotted line showing the voyage of the Pequod from Nantucket to the Sea of Japan. I also wanted all my local swimming haunts, from Whale Rock to Green Island to the Cow and Calf, a pair of tidal rocks about a mile offshore that mark the far edge of my swimming range. How to fit all those things, plus a sea monster?\n\nJohn’s two genius innovations were, first, inverting the globe, and, second, centering the Cow and Calf.\n\nThe inverted globe disorients, and reminds us of how much the convention of “north is up” organizes our view of the world. The continental shapes remain familiar, but updside-down, with Africa and Asia at the center, North America mostly off the page, and the voyage of the Pequod snaking its way through both sides.\n\nThe upper half of the map interposes my local coastline of Short Beach, including Johnson’s Beach, to which I walk my dogs every morning, my swimming haunts of Whale Rock and Green Island, plus other local landmarks within Long Island Sound. It’s my local wonderworld, and if you come visit – just a few miles east of New Haven! – I’ll be happy to take you for a swim to any of these places.\n\nThe Cow and Calf Rocks occupy the center of the map. They are a pair of rocks that pose some danger to navigation and also, at a mile off shore, represent a good long swim. A few times over the years in late summer we’ve organized a neighborhood swim race there and back, with kayak accompaniment. They are the center of the map and the edge of this world.\n\nIf you look closely across the map’s watery core, you’ll see the trace outlines of a vast fish-monster. John modelled this creature from the drawings on an early modern map that Rachel Carson used as the endpapers for the first American edition of The Sea Around Us (1951). (Carson got her images from Robert Dudley’s Dell’Arcano del Mare, an extraordinary atlas made in Florence in 1645-46 by the exiled illegitimate son of the Earl of Leicester.)\n\nSo – an inverted map of the world’s lands and seas, a local portrait of my home waters, a ghostly fish floating across the watery center, all tied together by the Cow and Calf.\n\nWhat I love most about collaboration are the moments in which someone else’s work reveals back to you something you were trying to express but could not quite work out. John’s map unlocks and visualizes one of the key features of Sailing without Ahab, that the waters we swim in and sail on contain both the local and the global, entwined together, reflecting and in tension with each other. I’m so grateful to be able to have the map in the book!\n\nWho rules the world?\n\nStories about the violent birth of the Roman Empire are always allegories of authority — how to get it, how to use it, and at what cost does it come. That’s how I read Virgil and Ovid, not to mention Shakespeare’s Roman plays. That’s what I saw last night on the Upper West Side in the hours before today’s torrential rainstorm.\n\nAt the West End Theatre, a cozy space upstairs at the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, I enjoyed a wonderfully triplicate rendition of this story. Courtesy of the brilliant experimental group Bedlam, this intense two hours without intermission mashed together Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, in which the nascent emperor gets murdered by his peers, with Shaw’s Caesar and Cleopatra, an 1898 play that I’d not seen before that portrays a philosophical and somewhat bloodless Caesar’s earlier encounter with the Egyptian Queen. The third portrayal of authority, however, was the most powerful – the Director of the theater company, who controls all the actors all the time, interrupting speeches and extracting confessions. Who rules the world, really? (I might note here that Bedlam’s Eric Tucker gets credited as having “adapted, directed, and designed” the production.)\n\nJuxtapositions were the heart of the show, and the cross-casting was brilliantly managed. Andrew Rothenberg played Caesar in both storylines as well as the Director, and he was wondrously imperious, bossy, and manipulative. He doled out the egotism of Shakespeare’s proto-emperor, who is happy to remind everyone that “always I am Caesar” (1.2.211). Rothenberg was equally strong playing the more philosophical and strategic vision of control, power, and impassivity that define Shaw’s superman. But there’s no real question that the Final Boss in the play was the Director. He pushed the excellent Rajesh Bose out of the role of Caesar to grab it for himself. (Bose shifted to the Egyptian God Ra, a semi-chorus in Shaw’s play, and acquited himself very well.) The Director bossed around the naive young Cleopatra as played by Shayvawn Webster, cross-cast as an idealistic Brutus. The Director interrupted Mackenzie Moyer as Portia in the middle of her moving speech about her love for Brutus (2.1) and decided on the spot to cut the scene. (The actors protested that it’s the only real moment for a woman character in Shakespeare’s play, which is true.) The Director required confessional moments from his actors, and then belittled them about what they revealed.\n\nI was reminded a bit of the director / casting agent / Iago figure in Keith Hamilton Cobb’s American Moor, who sat among the (mostly white and at least middle-aged) audience when I saw the show at Cherry Lane in Manhattan just before the pandemic. Power comes from positioning, and from all those structures that surround us.\n\nUnlike in Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra, which in a stroke of fortune I’m going to see on Monday night from the Red Bull Theater, Caesar and Cleopatra didn’t face each other down as competing principles of power in this play. Rather, Shaw’s Caesar educated Cleopatra in the practice of power, teaching her to out-maneuver her brother and rival Ptolemy while Caesar himself defeated his Roman rival Pompey, a mask of whose pickled head in a jar makes a lively appearance in the show, including some time on an audience member’s lap. Shakespeare’s Brutus showed his political naivete, which is exactly what Shaw’s Cleopatra may be learning to outgrow. The double casting provided an interesting take on these two characters, though it also somewhat muted the moral dimensions of Brutus’s struggle.\n\nOne of the liveliest figures of the night was Bedlam regular Labod, who played a physical and effusive Cassius as well as Cleopatra’s wonderfully-named Egyptian servant Ftatateeta. (The Director makes fun of this character’s name, of course). Labod’s intensity as Cassius somewhat overwhelmed Volino-Gyetsa’s physically smaller Brutus – but their late scene together fighting and reconciling (4.4) was nicely paced. Stephen Michael Spencer made his Bedlam debut as Mark Antony and Rufio, Caesar’s military aide in the Shaw play. He chewed the scenery into paste in the funeral oration, which was nicely set up. The play opened with Caesar’s dead body already on the floor, with the conspirators getting meta-theatrical – “How many ages hence / Shall this our lofty scene…” 3.1). Spencer’s Antony started to get warmed up in his speech, and just then the Director interrupted to shift the scene to Egypt (and the Shaw play). We finally got back to that speech almost two hours later. But it was worth the wait!\n\nUpdate: Before I forget I wanted to note the goofiest directoral move of the night, in which the case plays all of 2.2 – the back and forth on whether Caesar will or won’t go to the Forum, including a nice bit of manipulation of the big man’s ego by conspirator Decius Brutus – in over-the-top mafiosi accents, part The Godfather and part The Sopranos. Italians in the New Jersey waste management industry, Italians during the last days of the Roman Republic – the gag seems to have been irresistible. And lots of fun!\n\nMaybe I just have trouble sitting for over two hours, but I might have pulled the curtain at the end of that speech when it came around again, when the lights went out and Mark Antony in darkness intoned “MIschief, thou art afoot” (3.2). But I understand that they wanted to shoehorn in the brutal death of Cinna the Poet, and Portia’s suicide, and the fight between Brutus and Cassius in act 4. The final scene of the night returned to the meta-plot of the Director, whose actors may be just about to rebel. “Go fuck yourself,” muttered Labod, no longer in character as Cassius or Ftatateeta, on his way offstage. Everyone was outraged at his brutality and cold-bloodedness. They were ready to break into open revolt –\n\nBut then the curtain closed, and the Director’s job was done, his power secure, for another night.\n\nThe Working Group has spoken, and it seems that anyone who bought champagne to toast the Age of Anthropos may have to keep it on ice. According to today’s New York Times\n\nA committee of roughly two dozen scholars has, by a large majority, voted down a proposal to declare the start of the Anthropocene, a newly created epoch of geologic time, according to an internal announcement of the voting results seen by The New York Times.\n\nThe article clarifies that this decision was, in the words of Erle Ellis, “a narrow, technical matter for geologists,” and the vote should not be taken as a claim that humans have not disrupted the planetary ecosystem.\n\nEllis, who resigned in protest from the Anthropocene Working Group last year, advances the claim that the Anthropocene should better be understood as a geological “event” rather than a new (and presumably lasting) “epoch.” Ellis circulated an article by science report Paul Voosen in Science that proclaims, “The Anthropocene is Dead. Long Live the Anthropocene.”\n\nAn “event,” according to Ellis and others, can represent a less formal geological term. Its analogy would not be to long-last epochs such as the Pleistocene or even the current Holocene (now almos 12,000 years old, and still running) but rather the Great Oxygenation Event. That event, which happened around 2.5 billion years ago, saw cynanobacteria produce the first oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere, thus making possible all forms of life that consume or process oxygen. For aerobic life forms, the GOE created a new world. For older, anaerobic life, oxygen seems mostly to have been poisonous.\n\nOf course, the idea of the Anthropocene has long since slipped the hold of geologists, including their deliberate Working Group. I’m hardly the only lit professor who’s written books, in my case Break Up the Anthropocene (2019) with this word in the title – some of my favorites include Jeremy Davies’s The Birth of the Anthropocene (2016), Christophe Bonneuill and Jean-Baptiste Fressoz’s The Shock of the Anthropocene (2016), and Tobias Menely and Jesse Oak Taylor’s collection, Anthropocene Reading (2017).\n\nI like Ellis’s notion of a relatively sudden Event, rather than a sedimented and more stable Epoch. I also like James Scott’s notion, advanced in Against the Grain (2017), of a “thin” Anthropocene that began when early humans started modifying their environment with fire, and later with agriculture, leading to progressively “thick” Anthropocene moments, including early modern globalization in the 16th-17c, the Industrial Revolution in the 19c, and the Great Acceleration that followed WWII in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nPerhaps – is it too much to ask? – the twenty-first century may see some thinning of the Anthropocene event, as we transition from fossil fuels to other forms of energy? In which case the Event may still haunt us, but we won’t have entered the Epoch?\n\nFiasco Theater is one of my favorite local New York companies. Over the years, I’ve seen their productions of The Knight of the Burning Pestle (April 2023), Measure for Measure (2015), Twelfth Night (2017), and Two Gentlemen of Verona (2015). I missed their much-praised Cymbeline, but basically they are one of the local NYC companies that I’ll buy a ticket for whatever they play – even on a Friday night with a looming snowstorm!\n\nTheir show this winter, Pericles, isn’t everybody’s favorite Shakespeare, but it very much is mine – shipwrecks! pirates! crazy plot twists! magic! perhaps the most complex geographic itinerary (Tyre -> Antioch -> Tarsus -> Pentapolis -> more Tarsus -> Mytilene -> Ephesus) in all of Shakespeare! Even the medieval poet Gower gets a speaking part (and, in this production, a guitar). I’ve written about the heroine Marina, born during a tempest in the middle of the play, as the most aquatic and blue humanities-ish of Shakespeare’s characters.\n\nSo I was the perfect audience for Fiasco’s Pericles, which I saw at the Classic Stage Company’s home theater on East 13th St downtown. And while I did love it, as I always love the high spirits, musicality, and sheer liveliness of Fiasco’s performance style – well, a couple of things they tried didn’t seem quite to work. Perhaps because their Knight of the Burning Pestle, which I saw with students last spring, was such a triumph, I felt that a couple of things the company was trying got in their own way.\n\nA central gambit was passing the role of Pericles himself around to multiple cast members over the course of the play. The program lists Noah Brody, Paco Tolson, Devin Haqq, and Tatiana Wechsler as playing “Pericles and others.” I usually like that gambit, which I’ve encountered a few times before, above all in Dziecki Theatre’s extraordinary Makbet, which I loved so much when I saw it performed in a shipping container in 2018 that I brought them to our seminar room at St. John’s in 2019. But perhaps because Pericles shifts its scenes and its theatrical modes so often – if we’re in Antioch, it’s classical incest tragedy, in Pentapolis, a medieval tournament, Ephesus has a seedy faux-Elizabethan underworld, &c – the shifting of the actors jarred a bit. I love the performers – perhaps Tatiana Wechshler, cross-cast as the wicked Dionyza who tries to murder Marina, gave her Pericles the most interesting spin, though Devin Haqq’s final Pericles was also stately and powerful.\n\nThe other gambit, which by now I think of as a Fiasco trademark since their gloriously sea-shanty-filled Twelfth Night, which rivals Pestle as my favorites of their productions, is music. Since Marina restores her father’s identity through music in the play’s almost-climactic scene (they still have to make one last trip to Ephesus to restore her mother), the company’s emphasis on music seemed a likely fit. Perhaps I caught them on a bad night – Andy Grotelueschen, who made gloriously high-spirited runs as good king Simonides and Bolt the pandar, mentioned to the woman sitting next to me before the show started that the show is just out of previews and they are still “changing some things” – but the music felt a bit off to me. Ben Steinfeld’s guitar-troubadour Gower was fun and a bit goofy, which I think fits the old-fashioned tetrameter Shakespeare wrote for the part. But a few other songs, especially one that converted Marina’s lament on her nurse Lychordia’s grave (4.1) into something like a show tune, didn’t really fit for me. I’m very rarely a fussy professor – by all means change the script, that’s what it’s there for! – but I winced a few times.\n\nMaybe Pericles, especially compared with comic gems like Twelth Night and even the bizarre but structurally coherent Pestle, is just too wayward for the regular Fiasco treatment? Or maybe I was worried about the snowstorm, which didn’t start until after my long drive back to CT anyway, despite not thinking I was?\n\nFiasco’s Pericles is up in its cozy downtown theater through March 24! Go see it! Tell me what you think!\n\nIn distant pre-pandemic days of 2018, I dragged my family to the first Aquaman movie and was moved to blogging: “Seven Thoughts for the Seven Seas.” To my surprise, I later dilated those thoughts into a 2020 academic article, co-written with the brilliant medievalist and water-scholar James Smith, “Learning an Inclusive Blue Humanities” that used Aquaman and Moana to think about how the Indigenous traditions of Oceania are being translated into global cultures, and how a couple of white academics might ethically approach this material. I’m not a film scholar, but it was fun to write.\n\nSo of course I was fired up when it can time to pile the family into the Subaru and see Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom last night.\n\nIt wasn’t as good as the first one – sequels are hard – and I’m still confused about how the allegorical backstory works. But it was good fun, and while I don’t know that I’ll get all the way to Seven Thoughts on this one, here are a few spashes –\n\n(I’m hoping that Ryan Poll, author of 2022’s Aquaman and the War Against Oceans, will have more and better-informed things to say!)\n\nIce Falling Down as Ecocollapse\n\nOne of the repeated images director James Wan uses in the movie, starting with the credit sequence and rising to a climax in the final battle beneath the Antarctic ice shelf, is the calving of a glacial wall. Vertical spires of ice break off, fall down, and soon the entire ice-face evaporates. Ice sheet collapse is, as recent books by Elizabeth Rush (The Quickening) and Jeff Goodell (The Big Melt) about the Thwaites glacier have emphasized, among the most-feared prospects in today’s fragile Anthropocene moment. While Aquaman 2 did not dig deeply into sea level rise or glacial structures, and Aquaman himself did not – alas! – seem to have any affinity for frozen water, the gorgeous images of ice falling vertically down provided a kind of visual doomsday refrain.\n\nAtlantis and the Anthropocene\n\nThe climate politics of the film aren’t subtle – the big bad, a kind of underwater Lord of the Nazgul who had been buried deep in Atlantis’s past, threatens to emerge with an even faster-warming superfuel to break the world. Aquaman and his family, both on the human and Atlantean sides, stand for a fairly anodyne “we’ll fix the warming by all coming together” gestural eco-politics. But I do still enjoy, as I wrote about in the 2020 article, the movies’ semi-hidden subtext that presents Oceania as font of eco-wisdom. It seems to me that Atlantis might be best understood not just as a home of superhero wisdom figures, but as a collective representation (albeit in some versions a whitewashing) of the most geographically vast human community, the Indigenous peoples of Oceania, whose watery geography encompasses a vast triangle between Hawai’i, New Zealand/Aotearoa, and Easter Island/Rapa Nui. Early family scenes between Jason Mamoa’s Arthur/Aquaman, his father played by the great Maori actor Temuera Morrison, and the infant Arthur Jr., and a closing scene in which Arthur and his father dance the haka, demonstrate that the human side of the royal Atlantean family has roots in the cultures of Oceania. Despite the ghost-white spectral bodies of Patrick White as half-brother Orm and Nicole Kidman as the Queen Mother, I ended up thinking that Atlantis was basically a partly-digested fantasy of Oceania. Makes me want to read more eco-poetry by Craig Santos Perez and other Indigenous poets of Oceania!\n\nWater Flowing Up\n\nIn a movie whose eco-politics are both fully conventional (global warming is bad!) and entirely gestural (we can fix it together when Aquaman reveals his hidden undersea kingdom in a press conference in lower Manhattan!), it’s hard to locate a counter-current. But I think a few visual jokes by James Wan suggested that flowing water – as opposed to fracturing ice – represents rebirth and possibility. The two most striking early scenes of warm water flowing up feature the giggling baby Arhtur Jr. peeing up into his father’s open mouth (yuck). The baby, who will later be kidnapped by the big bad, represents a happy future of warm water flowing, which his father more or less embraces. A less-developed reprise of flowing water also appeared later when the cephalopod Topo, a minor character who I wanted to see much more of, spits water on Aquaman as they invade the desert kingdom to rescue half-brother Orm.\n\n(Really I would like an entire movie about Topo.)\n\nOrm and Eco-Humor\n\nOnce again Patrick Wilson reprises half-brother Orm, who shifts from being Arthur’s rival and main villain in the first movie to being a brotherly sidekick ripe for redemption in the sequel. Orm had a tough run in the first installment – his basic point, that surface dwellers had fouled the oceans with industry and pollution, seems unarguably right, but empathetic and half-human Arthur wants to unify the land and sea rather than, in Orm’s perhaps more elegant solution, sinking the land. In Part 2, Orm has been imprisoned by the Fish Kingdom’s desert commandos (not sure why they have desert commandos, but whatever). Arthur rescues him, and the banter between them is probably the liveliest part of the movie. To make sure we recognize the intertexual jokes, Arthur at one point calls his half-brother “Loki” and threatens to send him “back to Azkaban.” Visual quotations also show the minions of the big bad as half-Nazgul and half the undead from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Redeeming Orm entails bringing him into his brother’s jokes, and eventually feeding him an extra greasy cheeseburger.\n\nUndersea Witch King of Angmar Means What?\n\nLate in the movie, Orm has a vision of an ancient Atlantean splinter-kingdom whose energy is the source of all evil and pollution. The long-thought-dead-but-really-just-frozen King Kordax is to blame! This Underwater Sauron also churns out greenhouse gases and acidifies the ocean, so when Orm and Arthur come together to defeat him, it’s a victory for the planet too. I must say this part confused me. The movie is mostly clear, as Orm especially shows and the Black Manta plot mostly makes clear too, that the cause of global warming is modern industrial capitalism among surface dwellers – ie, it’s us, especially those of us in rich nations who spend lots of money on popcorn and Milk Duds at the movies. But since it’s not really possible to support a war of revenge against the surface by Orm as Ocean Master – the first movie toyed with this idea briefly – the plot offloads all badness onto Undersea Sauron and his shimmering green zombie-spider crew. He apparently split off from Atlantis in distant prehistory, and Black Manta’s rediscovery of his evil Trident kicks off this movie’s plot.\n\nBut what does Kordax and his ancient evil represent? Original undersea sin? The Hawaiian god of death and darkness Kaneloa, who opposes the creator god Kane? But if an evil under Antarctica lies at the root of Anthropocene warming, doesn’t that somewhat let industrial emissions off the hook? Or maybe that’s the point, since Hollywood doesn’t want to make us feel too bad?\n\nBlack Manta Who?\n\nSome of the film’s bad guy action, and also some of its moral confusion, comes from the supervillain Black Manta, a modern pirate who uses Atlantean tech to make himself an almost-match for Aquaman. But since for most of this movie Black Manta is under the spell of the Undersea Witch King, his own backstory – Aquaman left his father to die in the first movie – gets overwritten by Atlantean prehistory. It’s too bad, because Yayha Abdul-Mateen II is a powerful actor, even when he’s controlled by the big bad. Maybe his final fall into a mysterious under-glacier crevasse does not mean the end of the Manta? (Though online gossip shows no current plans for Aquaman 3…)\n\nAnyway – worth a couple hours if you like this sort of thing!"
