        "text": "(dramatic music) (gentle music) (dramatic music) (audience applauding) (gentle music) - Hail sphinx!\n\nSalutation from Julius Caesar.\n\n(chuckles) I have wandered in many lands seeking the lost regions from which my birth into this world has exiled me.\n\nI have found flocks and pastures, men and cities, but no other Caesar.\n\nNo heir native to me.\n\nNo man kindred to me.\n\nNone that can do my day's deed or think my night's thought.\n\nIn the little world yonder, sphinx, my place is as high as yours in this great desert.\n\nOnly I wander and you sit still.\n\nI conquer and you endure.\n\nI look up and I'm dazzled.\n\nI look down and I'm darkened.\n\nI look round and I'm puzzled.\n\nWhilst your eyes never turn from looking out.\n\nOut of the world to the lost region, the home from which we have strayed.\n\nsphinx, you and I strangers to the race of men are no strangers to one another.\n\nHave I not been conscious of you and of this place?\n\nSince I was born, Rome is a madman's dream.\n\nThis is my reality.\n\nThese starry lamps of yours.\n\nI have seen from afar in Gaul, in Britain, in Spain and Thessaly, signaling great secrets to some eternal sentinel below, whose post I never could find.\n\nAnd here at last, is there a sentinel.\n\nAn image of the constant and immortal part of my life.\n\nSilent, full of thought.\n\nAlone in the silver desert.\n\nSphinx.\n\nSphinx, I have climbed mountains at night to hear in the distance the stealthy footfall of the winds that chase your sands in forbidden play.\n\nOur invisible children, O sphinx, laughing in whispers.\n\nMy way hither was the way of destiny.\n\nFor I am he of whose genius you are the symbol.\n\nPart brute, part woman and part God.\n\nNothing of man in me at all.\n\nHave I read your riddle, sphinx?\n\n- [Cleopatra] Old gentleman.\n\n- Immortal gods.\n\n- [Cleopatra] Old gentleman, don't run away - Old gentleman, don't run away?\n\nThis to Julius Caesar?\n\n- [Cleopatra] Old gentleman.\n\n- Sphinx, you presume on your centuries.\n\nI'm younger than you.\n\n- Climb up here quickly or the Romans will come and eat you.\n\n- A child at its breast.\n\nA divine child.\n\n- Come up, quickly.\n\n- [Caesar] Who are you?\n\n- Cleopatra, queen of Egypt.\n\n- Queen of the gypsies, you mean.\n\n- You must not be disrespectful to me or the sphinx will let the Romans come and eat you.\n\nCome up.\n\nIt is quite cozy here.\n\n- What a dream?\n\nWhat a magnificent dream.\n\n(audience laughing) Only let me not wake.\n\n- Now, sit down.\n\nYou may have it's other paw.\n\nIt is very powerful and will protect us.\n\nI am glad you have come.\n\nI was very lonely.\n\nDid you happen to see a white cat anywhere?\n\n- Have you lost one?\n\n- Yes.\n\nThe sacred white cat.\n\nIs it not dreadful?\n\nI brought him here to sacrifice him to the sphinx, but when we got a little away from the city, a black cat called to him and he jumped out of my arms and ran away to it.\n\nDo you think the black cat can have been my great, great great grandmother?\n\n- Your great, great, great grandmother?\n\nWell, why not?\n\nNothing would surprise me on this night of nights.\n\n- I think it must've been.\n\nMy great grandmother's great grandmother was a black kitten of the sacred white cat, and the River Nile made her his seventh wife.\n\nThat is why my hair is so wavy.\n\nAnd I always want to be led to what I like, no matter whether it is the will of the gods or not.\n\nThat is because my blood is made with Nile water.\n\n- Uh-huh.\n\nBut what are you doing here, I mean, at this time of night?\n\nDo you live here?\n\n- Of course not.\n\nI am the queen.\n\nAnd I shall live in the palace of Alexandria when I have killed my brother who drove me out of it.\n\nWhen I am old enough, I shall do just what I like.\n\nI shall be able to poison the slaves and see them wriggle and pretend to Ftatateeta that she is going to be put into a fiery furnace.\n\n- Aha!\n\nBut meanwhile, why are you not at home and in bed?\n\n- Because the Romans are coming to eat us all.\n\nYou are not at home and in bed either.\n\n- Oh yes, I am.\n\nI live in a tent and I'm now in that tent, fast asleep and dreaming.\n\nYou suppose that I believe that you're real, you impossible little dream witch?\n\n(laughing) - You are a funny old gentleman.\n\nI like you.\n\n- That spoiled the dream.\n\n(audience laughing) Why don't you dream that I'm young?\n\n- I wish you were.\n\nOnly I think I should be more afraid of you.\n\nI like men, especially young men with strong round arms, but I am afraid of them.\n\nYou are old.\n\nAnd rather thin and stringy.\n\nBut you have a nice voice.\n\n- Oh, thank you.\n\n- And I like to have someone to talk to, though I think you are a little mad.\n\nIt is the moon that makes you talk to yourself in that silly way.\n\n- What?\n\nOh, you heard that, did you?\n\nNo, I was saying my prayers to the great sphinx.\n\n- But this isn't the great sphinx.\n\n- What?\n\n- This is only a dear little kitten of a sphinx.\n\nWhy, the great sphinx is so big, it has a temple between its paws.\n\nThis is my pet sphinx.\n\nTell me, do you think the Romans have any sorcerers that can take us away from the sphinx by magic?\n\n- Why, are you afraid of the Romans?\n\n- Oh, they would eat us if they caught us.\n\nThey are barbarians.\n\nTheir chief is called Julius Caesar.\n\nHis father was a tiger and his mother a burning mountain.\n\nAnd he has a nose like an elephant's trunk.\n\nThey all have long noses, and ivory tusks, and little tails, and seven arms with 100 arrows in each.\n\nAnd they live on human flesh.\n\n- Would you like me to show you a real Roman?\n\n- No!\n\nYou are frightening me.\n\n- No, no, 'tis no matter.\n\nI mean, this is only a dream.\n\n- It is not a dream.\n\nIt is not a dream.\n\nSee!\n\n(screams) - Stop that.\n\nHow dare you!\n\n- You said that you were dreaming.\n\nI only wanted to show you.\n\n(sobbing) - Oh come, don't cry.\n\nA queen mustn't cry.\n\nAm I awake?\n\nYes, I am.\n\nImpossible.\n\nMadness.\n\nMadness.\n\nBack to camp.\n\nBack to camp.\n\n- No, no, you shan't leave me.\n\nNo, no no.\n\nDon't go.\n\nI am afraid of the Romans.\n\n- Cleopatra, can you see my face well?\n\n- Yes.\n\nIt is so white in the moonlight.\n\n- Are you sure it is the moonlight that makes me look whiter than an Egyptian?\n\nDo you notice that I have a rather long nose?\n\nIt is a Roman nose, Cleopatra.\n\n(Cleopatra screams) - Bite him in two, sphinx.\n\nBite him in two.\n\nI meant to sacrifice the white cat.\n\nI did indeed.\n\n- Would you let me teach you a way to prevent Caesar from eating you?\n\n- Oh, do, do do.\n\nI will seal Ftatateeta's jewels and give them to you.\n\nI will make the river Nile water your lands twice a year.\n\n- Peace, peace, my child.\n\nCaesar never eats women.\n\n- What?\n\n- But he eats girls and cats.\n\nNow, you are a silly little girl and you are descended from the black kitten.\n\nYou are both a girl and a cat.\n\n- And will he eat me?\n\n- Yes.\n\nUnless you can make him believe that you are a woman.\n\n- We must get a sorcerer to make a woman of me.\n\nAre you a sorcerer?\n\n- Perhaps, but it will take a long time.\n\nAnd this very night, you must stand face-to-face with Caesar in the palace of your father's.\n\n- No, I daren't.\n\n- Oh, whatever dread you may feel in your soul, however terrible Caesar may be to you, you must confront him as a brave woman and a great queen.\n\nAnd you must feel no fear.\n\nIf your hand shakes or your voice quavers then night and death.\n\nBut if he thinks you worthy to rule, he will set you on the throne by his side and make you the real ruler of Egypt.\n\n- No, he will find me out.\n\nHe will find me out.\n\n- He is easily deceived by women.\n\nTheir eyes dazzle him.\n\n- Then we will cheat him.\n\n- I will put on Ftatateeta's head dress, and he will think me quite an old woman.\n\n- Well, if you do that, he will eat you in one mouthful.\n\n- But I will give him a cake with my magic opal and seven hairs of the white cat- - Oh, but you're a silly little fool.\n\nHe will eat your cake and you too.\n\n- Please, please.\n\nI will do whatever you say.\n\nI will be good.\n\nI will be your slave.\n\n(somber music) What was that?\n\n- Caesar's voice.\n\n- Let us run away.\n\nCome.\n\nOh, come.\n\n- No, no, no.\n\nYou will be safe with me until you stand on your throne to receive Caesar.\n\nNow, lead me thither.\n\n- I will.\n\nI will.\n\nOh, come, come, come.\n\nThe gods are angry.\n\nDo you feel the earth shaking?\n\n- It is the tread of Caesar's legions.\n\n- This way, quickly.\n\nAnd let us look for the white cat as we go.\n\nIt is he that turned you into a Roman.\n\n(Caesar laughs) - Incorrigible.\n\nIncorrigible.\n\n(gentle music) What place is this?\n\n- This is where I sit on my throne when I am allowed to wear my crown and robes.\n\n- Order the slave to light for lamps.\n\n- Do you think I may?\n\n- Well, of course.\n\nYou are the queen.\n\nGo on.\n\n- Light all the lamps.\n\n- Stop!\n\nWho is this you have with you?\n\nAnd how dare you order the lamps to be lighted without my permission?\n\n- Who is she?\n\n- Ftatateeta.\n\n- Chief nurse to the- - I speak to the queen.\n\nBe silent.\n\nIs this how your servants know their places?\n\nSend her away.\n\nAnd you, do as the queen has bidden.\n\nWell, go on, you are the queen.\n\nSend her away.\n\nFtatateeta, dear, you must go away, just for a little- - Oh no, you're not commanding her.\n\nYou're begging her.\n\nYou are no queen.\n\nYou shall be eaten, farewell.\n\n- No!\n\nDon't leave me.\n\n- A Roman does not stay with queens who are afraid of their slaves.\n\n- I am not afraid.\n\nIndeed.\n\nI am not afraid.\n\n- We shall see who is afraid here.\n\nCleopatra!\n\n- On your knees, woman.\n\nAm I also a child that you dare trifle with me?\n\n(Ftatateeta hissing) (Caesar chuckles) - You.\n\nCan you cut off her head?\n\nRemember yourself, mistress.\n\n- Oh, queen.\n\nForget that thy servant in the days of thy greatness.\n\n- Go!\n\nBe gone.\n\nGo away!\n\nGive me something to beat her with.\n\n- (chuckles) You scratch little kitten, do you?\n\n- I will beat somebody.\n\nI will beat him.\n\nThere.\n\n(slave screaming) There.\n\nThere.\n\nI am a real queen at last.\n\nA real, real, queen.\n\nCleopatra, the queen.\n\nOh, I love you for making me a queen.\n\n- But queens love only kings.\n\n- I will make all the men I love kings.\n\nI will make you a king.\n\nI will have many young kings with strong round arms.\n\nAnd when I am tired of them, I will whip them to death.\n\nBut you shall always be my king.\n\nMy nice, kind, wise, good old king.\n\n- Oh my wrinkles, my wrinkles in my child's heart.\n\nYou will be the most dangerous of all Caesar's conquests.\n\n- Caesar.\n\nI forgot Caesar.\n\nYou will tell him that I am a queen, will you not?\n\nA real queen.\n\n(gentle music) Listen.\n\nLet us run away and hide.\n\n- No.\n\nIf you fear Caesar, you are no true queen.\n\nAnd though you were to hide beneath a pyramid, he would go straight to it and lift it with one hand, and then... Be afraid if you dare.\n\nAha!\n\nCaesar approaches the throne of Cleopatra.\n\nTake your place.\n\n- Caesar would know that I was a queen if he saw my crown and robes, would he not?\n\n- He will know Cleopatra by her pride, her courage, her majesty and her beauty.\n\nAre you trembling?\n\n- No, I... No.\n\n- Is it sweet or bitter to be a queen, Cleopatra?\n\n- Bitter.\n\n- Cast out fear and you will conquer Caesar.\n\n- The Romans are in the courtyard.\n\n- Now, if you quail... (drums blaring) - [Soldiers] Hail Caesar!\n\n(audience laughing) (rhythmic drum music) (audience applauding) - The king of Egypt has arrived to speak.\n\n- Peace for the king's word.\n\n- Take notice of this all of you.\n\nI am the first born son of Auletes, the flute blower, who was your king?\n\nNow that my father is dead, my sister, Cleopatra, would snatch the kingdom from me and reign in my place, but...\n\nBut... - But the gods will not suffer.\n\n- Yes, the gods will not suffer... Not suffer...\n\nI forgot what the gods will not suffer.\n\n- Let Pothinus, the king's guardian speak for the king.\n\n- The king wish to say that the gods will not suffer the impiety of his sister to go unpunished.\n\n- Yes, I remember the rest of it.\n\nShe has cast a spell on the Roman Julius Caesar to make him uphold her false pretense to rule in Egypt.\n\nTake notice then that I will not suffer... That I will not suffer... What is it that I will not suffer?\n\n- The king will not suffer a foreigner to take from him the throne of our region.\n\n- Egypt for the Egyptians.\n\n- [All] Egypt for the Egyptians.\n\n- Tell, the king, Achillas, how many soldiers and horsemen follow the Roman.\n\n- [Theodotus] Let the king's general speak.\n\n- But two Roman legions, O king.\n\n3000 soldiers and scarce 1000 horsemen.\n\n(all laughing) - [Rufio] Peace, ho!\n\nCaesar approaches.\n\n- The king permits the Roman commander to enter.\n\n(Caesar chuckles) - And which is the king?\n\nThe man or the boy?\n\n- I am Pothinus, the guardian of my lord, the king.\n\n- Oh, so you are other king?\n\nDull work at your age, hey?\n\nYour servant, Pothinus, and this gentleman?\n\n- Achillas, the king's general general.\n\n- A general, hey?\n\nI'm a general myself.\n\nOnly I began too old, too old.\n\nHealth and many victories, Achillas.\n\n- As the gods allow, Caesar.\n\n- And you sir are?\n\n- Theodotus, the king's tutor.\n\n- Oh, you teach men how to be kings, Theodotus?\n\nHow very clever of you.\n\nAnd this place?\n\n- The council chamber of the chancellors of the king's treasury, Caesar.\n\n- That reminds me.\n\nI want some money.\n\n- The king's treasury is poor, Caesar.\n\n- Yes, I notice there is but one chair in it.\n\n- Bring a chair there for Caesar.\n\n- Caesar.\n\n- No, no, my boy.\n\nThis is your chair of state.\n\nYou sit down.\n\n- Sit on that, Caesar.\n\n- Now, Pothinus, to business.\n\nI am badly in want of money.\n\n- My master would say that there is a lawful debt due to Rome by Egypt, contracted by the king's deceased father to the triumvirate.\n\nAnd that it is Caesar's duty to his country to require immediate payment.\n\n- I forgot.\n\nI have not made my companions known here.\n\nPothinus, this is Britannus, my secretary.\n\nHe's an islander, from the Western end of the world.\n\nAnd this gentleman is Rufio, my comrade in arms.\n\nNow Pothinus, I want 1600 talents.\n\n- 40 million sesterces?\n\nImpossible.\n\nThere is not so much money in the king's treasury.\n\n- Oh, only 1600 talents, Pothinus.\n\nWhy do you count them in sesterces?\n\nA sesterces is only worth a loaf of bread.\n\n- And a talent is worth a race horse.\n\nI say it is impossible.\n\nWe have been at strife here because the king's sister, Cleopatra, falsely claims his throne.\n\nThe king's taxes have not been collected for a whole year.\n\n- Oh yes, they have.\n\nMy officers have been collecting them all morning.\n\n- What?\n\n- What?\n\n- You must pay, Pothinus.\n\nWhy waste words.\n\nYou're getting off cheaply enough.\n\n- Is it possible that Caesar, the conqueror of the world, has time to occupy himself with such a trifle as our taxes?\n\n- My friend, taxes are the chief business of a conqueror of the world.\n\n- Then take warning, Caesar.\n\nThis day, the treasures of the temple and the gold of the king's treasury shall be sent to the mint to be melted down for our ransom in the sight of the people.\n\nThey shall see us sitting under bare walls and drinking from wooden cups.\n\nAnd their wrath be on your head, Caesar, if you force us to this sacrilege.\n\n- Oh, fear not, Pothinus.\n\nThe people know how well wine tastes in wooden cups.\n\nBut in return for your bounty, I shall settle this dispute about the throne for you, if you will, what say you?\n\n- If I say no, will that hinder you?\n\n- No.\n\n- You say the matter has been an issue for a year, Pothinus.\n\nMay I have 10 minutes at it?\n\n- You will do your pleasure doubtless.\n\n- Good.\n\nBut first we must have Cleopatra here.\n\n- She's not in Alexandria.\n\nShe's fled into Syria.\n\n- I think not.\n\nCall Totateeta.\n\n- Ho there, Teetatota.\n\n- Who pronounces the name of Ftatateeta, the queen's chief nurse.\n\n- Nobody can pronounce it, Tota, except yourself.\n\nWhere is your mistress?\n\nWould the queen favor us with her presence for a moment?\n\n- Am I to behave like a queen?\n\n- Yes.\n\n(Ptolemy screams) - Caesar.\n\nThis is how she treats me always.\n\nIf I am king, then why is she allowed to take everything from me?\n\n- You are not to be king, you little cry baby.\n\nYou are to be eaten by the Romans.\n\n- Hey, come here my boy and stand by me.\n\n- Take your throne, I do not want it.\n\nGo this instant and sit down in your place.\n\n- Go, Ptolemy.\n\nAlways take a throne when it's offered you.\n\n- I hope you will have the good sense to follow your own advice when we get back to Rome, Caesar.\n\n(Caesar laughs) - Now, Pothinus- - Are you not going to speak- - Be quiet!\n\nOpen your mouth again before I give you leave and you shall be eaten.\n\n- I am not afraid.\n\nA queen mustn't be afraid.\n\nYou can eat my husband there if you like.\n\nHe is afraid.\n\n- Your husband?\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n- That little thing.\n\n- That little thing?\n\n- Caesar, you are a stranger here.\n\nNot conversant with our laws.\n\nThe kings and queens of Egypt may not marry except with their own Royal blood.\n\nPtolemy and Cleopatra are born king and consort, just as they are born brother and sister.\n\n- Caesar, this is not proper.\n\n- Outrage.\n\n- Pardon him, Theodotus.\n\nHe is a barbarian.\n\n(audience laughing) And thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature.\n\n- On the contrary, Caesar, it is these Egyptians who are barbarians.\n\nAnd you do wrong to encourage them.\n\nI say it is a scandal.\n\n- Well, scandal or not my friend, it opens the gate of peace.\n\nNow, hear what I propose.\n\n- Hear Caesar there!\n\n- Hear Caesar!\n\n- Ptolemy and Cleopatra shall reign jointly in Egypt.\n\n- What of the king's younger brother and Cleopatra's younger sister?\n\n- There is another little Ptolemy, Caesar.\n\nSo they tell me.\n\n- Well, the little Ptolemy can marry the other sister and we will make them both a present of Cyprus.\n\n- Cyprus is of no use to anybody.\n\n- It is no matter.\n\nYou shall have it for the sake of peace.\n\n- Caesar, be honest.\n\nThe money you demand is the price of our freedom.\n\nTake it and leave us to settle our own affairs.\n\n- Yes, yes.\n\nEgypt for the Egyptians.\n\n- Egypt for the Egyptians.\n\n- Oh, Egypt for the Egyptians.\n\nHave you forgotten that there's a Roman army of occupation left here by Aulus Gabinius, when he set up your little toy king for you?\n\n- And now under my command.\n\nI'm the Roman general here, Caesar.\n\n- And you're the Egyptian general as well, hey?\n\n- That is so, Caesar.\n\n- So you can make war on the Egyptians in the name of Rome and on the Romans, on me if necessary, in the name of Egypt?\n\n- That is so, Caesar.\n\n- And which side are you on now, if I may presume to ask, general?\n\n- On the side of the right and of the gods.\n\n- And how many men have you?\n\n- That will appear when I take the field.\n\n- Are your men Romans?\n\nIf not, it matters not how many there are.\n\nProvided they're no stronger than 50 to one.\n\n- It is useless to try to bluff us, Rufio.\n\nCaesar has been defeated before and may be defeated again.\n\nA few weeks ago, Caesar was flying for his life before Pompey.\n\nAnd a few months hence maybe flying for his life before Cato or Juba of Numdia.\n\n- And what can you do with 4,000 men?\n\n- And without money?\n\nAway with you.\n\n- Why do you allow them to talk to you like that, Caesar?\n\nAre you afraid?\n\n- Well, my dear, what they say is quite true.\n\n- But if you go away, I shall not be queen.\n\n- I shall not go away until you are queen.\n\n- Achillas, if you are not a fool, you will take this girl while she is under your hand.\n\n- Why not take Caesar as well, Achillas?\n\n- Well said, Rufio.\n\nWhy not?\n\n- Try, Achillas.\n\nGuard there.\n\n(upbeat drum music) - You are Caesar's prisoners, all of you.\n\n- No, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n(audience laughing) By no means.\n\nCaesar's guests, gentlemen.\n\n- Won't you cut their heads off?\n\n- What?\n\nCut off your brother's head?\n\n- Why not?\n\nHe would cut off mine if he got the chance.\n\nWouldn't you, Ptolemy?\n\n- I would.\n\nI will too when I grow up.\n\n- Caesar, if you attempt to detain us- - He will succeed, Egyptian.\n\nMake up your mind to that.\n\nWe hold the palace, the beach, the Eastern Harbor.\n\nThe road to Rome is open and you will travel it if Caesar chooses.\n\n- I could do no less to secure the retreat of my own soldiers, Pothinus.\n\nI am accountable for every life among them.\n\nBut you are free to go as are all here and in the palace.\n\n- What?\n\nRenegades and all?\n\n- Roman army of occupation and all.\n\nHey, Achillas.\n\n- You are turning us out of our own palace into the streets?\n\nAs you tell us with a grand air, we are free to go.\n\nIt is for you to go.\n\n- But your friends are in the streets.\n\nYou will be safer there.\n\n- This is a trick.\n\nI am the king's guardian.\n\nI refuse to stir.\n\nI stand on my right here.\n\nWhere is your right?\n\n- Rufio, scabbard Pothinus.\n\nI may not be able to keep it there if you wait too long.\n\n- And this is Roman justice.\n\n- But not Roman gratitude, I hope.\n\n- Gratitude?\n\nAm I in your debt for any service, gentlemen?\n\n- Is Caesar's life with so little account to him that he forgets that we have saved it?\n\n- My life, is that all?\n\n- Your life, your laurels, your future.\n\n- It is true.\n\nI can call a witness to prove that but for us, the Roman army of occupation led by Pompey, the greatest soldier in the world, would now have Caesar at its mercy.\n\nHo there, Lucius Septimius.\n\n- No!\n\n- Yes!\n\n- No!\n\n- Yes, I say.\n\nLet the military tribune bear witness.\n\nBear witness Lucius Septimius.\n\nCaesar came hither in pursuit of his foe.\n\nDid we shelter his foe?\n\n- As Pompey's foot touched the Egyptian shore, his head fell by the stroke of my sword.\n\n- Under the eyes of his wife and child.\n\nRemember that, Caesar.\n\nThey saw it from the ship he had just left.\n\nWe have given you a full and sweet measure of vengeance.\n\n- Vengeance?\n\n- Our first gift to you as your galley came into the roadstead, was the head of your rival for the empire of the world.\n\nBear witness, Lucius Septimius.\n\nIs it not so?\n\n- It is so.\n\nWith this hand, that slew Pompey, I placed his head at the feet of Caesar.\n\n- So would you have slain Caesar had Pompey been victorious at Pharsalia?\n\n- Woe to the vanquished, Caesar.\n\nWhen I served Pompey, I slew men as good as he only because he conquered them.\n\nHis turn came at last.\n\n- The deed was not yours, Caesar, but ours.\n\nNay, mine, for it was done under my counsel.\n\nThanks to us, you keep your reputation for clemency and have your vengeance too.\n\n- Vengeance?\n\nVengeance?\n\nOh, if I could stoop to vengeance, what would I not exact upon you as the price of this murdered man's blood?\n\nWas he not my son-in-law?\n\nMy ancient friend, for 20 years the master of great Rome, for 30 years compeller of victory?\n\nDid not I as a Roman share his glory?\n\nWas the fate that forced us to fight for the mastery of the world of our making?\n\nAm I Julius Caesar or am I a wolf that you fling to me?\n\nThe gray head of the old soldier?\n\nThe laurelled conqueror.\n\nThe mighty Roman, treacherously struck down by this callous ruffian.\n\nAnd then claim my gratitude for it.\n\nBe gone, you fill me with horror.\n\n- You have seen severed heads before, Caesar, and severed right hands too, I think.\n\nSome thousands of them in Gaul after you vanquished Vercingetorix.\n\nDid you spare him with all your clemency?\n\nWas that vengeance?\n\n- No, by the gods would that it had been vengeance, at least it's human.\n\nNo, I say, those severed right hands and the brave Vercingetorix basely strangled beneath the capital, were a wise severity, a necessary protection to the commonwealth, a duty of statesmanship.\n\nFollies and fictions 10 times bloodier than honest vengeance.\n\nWhat a fool was I then to think that men's lives should be at the mercy of such fools.\n\nLucius Septimius, pardon me.\n\nWhy should the slayer of Vercingetorix rebuke the slayer of Pompey?\n\nBut you are free to go with the rest, or stay if you will.\n\nI will find a place for you in my service.\n\n- The odds are against you, Caesar.\n\nI go.\n\n- [Rufio] That means that he is a Republican.\n\n- And what are you?\n\n- A Caesarian.\n\nLike all Caesar's soldiers.\n\n- Oh, Lucius, Caesar is no Caesarian.\n\nBut were Rome a true republic, then were Caesar the first of Republicans.\n\nBut you have made your choice.\n\nFarewell.\n\n- Farewell.\n\nCome, Achillas, whilst there is yet time.\n\n- Do you suppose he would let us go if he had our heads in his hands?\n\n- Rufio, if I take Lucius Septimius for my model, and become exactly like him, ceasing to be Caesar, will you serve me still?\n\n- Caesar, this is not good sense.\n\nYour duty to Rome demands that her enemies should be prevented from doing further mischief.\n\n- No use talking to him, Britannus.\n\nYou may save your breath to cool your porridge.\n\n(Caesar laughs) But mark this, Caesar.\n\nYou may give what orders you please, but I tell you that your next victory will be a massacre, thanks to your clemency.\n\nI, for one, will take no prisoners.\n\nI will kill my enemies in the field, then you can preach as much clemency as you please.\n\nI shall never have to fight them again.\n\n(Caesar chuckles) And now, with your leave, I shall see these gentry off the premises.\n\n- Oh, what!\n\nThey have left the boy alone.\n\nShame, shame.\n\n- Come, your majesty!\n\n- Is he turning me out of my palace?\n\n- You're welcome to stay if you wish.\n\n- Go, my boy.\n\nI'll not harm you, but you will be safer there, amongst your friends.\n\nHere, you are in the lion's mouth.\n\n- It is not the lion I fear, but the jackal.\n\n(Caesar laughing ) - Brave boy!\n\n- You think that very clever.\n\n- Britannus, attend the king.\n\nGive him in charge to that Pothinus fellow.\n\n- And this piece of goods?\n\nWhat's to be done with her?\n\nHowever, I suppose I may leave that to you.\n\n- Did you mean for me to go with the rest?\n\n- Oh, you are free to do just as you please, Cleopatra.\n\n- Then you do not care whether I stay or not?\n\n- Well, of course I had rather you stayed.\n\n- Much, much rather?\n\n- Much, much rather.\n\n- Then I consent to stay, because I am asked.\n\nBut I do not want to, mind.\n\n- That is quite understood.\n\nTotateeta!\n\nWhat?\n\n- Her name is not Totateeta, it is Ftatateeta.\n\nFtatateeta.\n\n- Tfatafeeta will forgive the erring tongue of a Roman.\n\nTota!\n\nThe queen will hold her state here in Alexandria.\n\nEngage women to attend upon her and do all that is needed.\n\n- Am I then the mistress of the queen's household?\n\n- No!\n\nI am the mistress of the queen's household.\n\nNow, go and do as you are told, or this very afternoon, I shall have you thrown into the Nile to poison the poor crocodiles.\n\n- No, no.\n\n- Yes, yes.\n\nYou are very sentimental, Caesar.\n\nBut you are clever, and if you do as I tell you, you will soon learn to govern.\n\n(mumbling) - Cleopatra, I really think I must eat you, after all.\n\n- You must not speak to me now as though I am a child.\n\n- You've been growing up since the sphinx introduced us the other night, and you think you know more than I do already.\n\n- No, that would be very silly of me.\n\nOf course I know that.\n\nAre you angry with me?\n\n- No.\n\n- Then why are you so thoughtful?\n\n- I have work to do, Cleopatra.\n\n- Work?\n\nWhat nonsense!\n\nYou must remember that you are a king now.\n\nI have made you one.\n\nKings don't work.\n\n- Oh, and who told you that, little kitten?\n\n- My father was king of Egypt, and he never worked.\n\nBut he was a great king, and cut off my sister's head because she rebelled against him and took his throne from him.\n\n- Well, and how did he get his throne back again?\n\n- I will tell you.\n\nA beautiful young man, with strong round arms, came over the desert with many horsemen, and slew my sister's husband and gave my father back his throne.\n\nI was only 12 then.\n\nOh, I wish he would come again, now that I am a queen.\n\nI would make him my husband.\n\n- Well, it might be managed, perhaps.\n\nFor it was I who sent that beautiful young man to help your father.\n\n- You know him?\n\n- I do.\n\n- Has he come with you?\n\n- No.\n\n- Oh, I wish he had.\n\nI wish he had.\n\nIf only I were a little older, so that he might not think me a mere kitten, as you do.\n\nBut perhaps that is because you are old.\n\nHe is many, many years younger than you, is he not?\n\n- Well, somewhat younger.\n\n- Would he be my husband, do you think, if I asked him?\n\n- Very likely.\n\n- But I would not like to ask him.\n\nPerhaps, you could persuade him to ask me without him knowing that I wanted him to?\n\n- Oh, my poor child!\n\n- Why do you say that as though you were sorry for me?\n\nDoes he love anyone else?\n\n- I'm afraid so.\n\n- Oh!\n\nThen I will not be his first love.\n\n- Not quite the first.\n\nHe is greatly admired by women.\n\n- I wish I could be the first.\n\nBut if he loves me, I will make him kill all the rest.\n\nTell me, is he still beautiful?\n\nDo his strong round arms still shine in the sun like marble?\n\n(Caesar mumbles) - He's in excellent condition.\n\nConsidering how much he eats and drinks.\n\n- Now, you must not say common, earthly things about him, for I love him.\n\nHe is a god.\n\n- He is a great captain of horsemen, and swifter of foot than any other Roman.\n\n- What is his real name?\n\n- His real name?\n\n- Yes.\n\nI always call him Horus, because Horus is the most beautiful of all of our gods.\n\nBut I want to know his real name.\n\n- His name is Mark Antony.\n\n- Mark Antony.\n\nMark Antony.\n\nMark Antony!\n\nOh, what a beautiful name!\n\nOh, how I love you for sending him to help my father.\n\nDid you love my father very much?\n\n- No, my child.\n\nBut then your father, as you say, never worked.\n\nI always work.\n\nNow, you must run away for a little and send my secretary to me.\n\n- No!\n\nI want to stay and hear you talk of Mark Antony.\n\n- But if I do not get to work, Pothinus and the rest of them will cut us off from the harbor, and then the way from Rome will be blocked.\n\n- No matter, I do not want you to go back to Rome.\n\n- But you want Mark Antony to come from it.\n\n- Oh!\n\n(audience laughing) Yes.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nI forgot.\n\nNow, go quickly and work, Caesar, and keep the way over the sea open for my Mark Antony.\n\n- Britannus!\n\nWhat now?\n\n- This, Caesar, and two of my comrades killed in the market place.\n\n- Ay.\n\nWhy?\n\n- There is an army come to Alexandria, calling itself the Roman army.\n\n- The Roman army of occupation, ay?\n\n- Commanded by one Achillas.\n\n- Well?\n\n- The citizens rose against us when the army entered the gates.\n\nI was with two others in the market place when the news came.\n\nAnd they set upon us.\n\nI cut my way out and here I am.\n\n- Good.\n\nI'm glad to see you alive.\n\nRufio.\n\n- Ho!\n\n- We are besieged.\n\n- What?\n\nAlready?\n\n- Now, tomorrow, what does it matter?\n\nWe shall be besieged.\n\n- [Britannus] Caesar!\n\n- Yes, I know.\n\nComrade, give the word to turn out on the beach and stand by the boats.\n\nAnd get that wound attended to.\n\nGo.\n\nRufio, we have some ships in the western harbor.\n\nBurn them.\n\n- Burn them?\n\n- Take every boat from the eastern harbor, and seize the Pharos.\n\nThat is the island with the lighthouse.\n\nLeave half our men behind to hold the beach and the quay outside the palace.\n\nThat is our way home.\n\n- Are we to give up the city?\n\n- We have not got it, Rufio.\n\nThis palace we have, and what is that building next door?\n\n- The theater.\n\n- The theater.\n\nWe should have that too.\n\nBut for the rest, Egypt for the Egyptians!\n\n- Well, you know best, I suppose.\n\nAnything else?\n\n- That is all.\n\nAre those ships burnt yet?\n\n- Be easy, I shall waste no more time.\n\n- Caesar, Pothinus demands to speak with you.\n\nIn my opinion, he needs a lesson.\n\nHis manner is most insolent.\n\n- Where is he?\n\n- He waits without.\n\n- Well, admit him.\n\nAnd Britannus, fetch me my armor, will you?\n\nWell, Pothinus?\n\n- I have brought you our ultimatum, Caesar.\n\n- Ultimatum?\n\nThe door was open.\n\nYou should have gone out through it before you declared war.\n\nYou are my prisoner now.\n\n- I, your prisoner?\n\nDo you know that you are in Alexandria, and that King Ptolemy, with an army outnumbering your little troop a hundred to one, is in possession of Alexandria?\n\n- Well, well, get out as best you can.\n\nAnd tell your friends not to kill any more Romans in the market place.\n\nOtherwise my soldiers, who do not share my celebrated clemency, will probably kill you.\n\n- Horrors unspeakable.\n\nWoe, alas, help!\n\nOh, worse than the death of 10,000 men.\n\nLoss irreparable to mankind.\n\n- What has happened, man?\n\n- The fire has spread from your ships.\n\nThe first of the Seven Wonders of the World perishes.\n\nThe Library of Alexandria is in flames.\n\n- Is that all?\n\n- All?\n\nCaesar, will you go down to posterity as a barbarous soldier, too ignorant to know the value of books?\n\n- Theodotus, I am an author myself.\n\nAnd I tell you it is better the Egyptians live their lives than dream them away with the help of books.\n\n- Caesar, once in 10 generations of men, the world gains an immortal book.\n\n- If it did not flatter mankind, the common executioner would burn it.\n\n- Without history, death would lay you beside your meanest soldier.\n\n- Oh, death will do that in any case.\n\nI ask no better grave.\n\n- What is burning there is the memory of mankind.\n\n- A shameful memory, let it burn.\n\n- Will you destroy the past?\n\n- Aye, and build the future with its ruins.\n\nNow, harken to me, Theodotus, teacher of kings.\n\nYou who valued Pompey's head no more than a shepherd values an onion, and who kneel to me now, with tears in your old eyes, to plead for a few sheepskins scrawled with errors?\n\nI cannot spare you a man or a bucket of water just now, but you may pass freely out of the palace.\n\nSo, away with you to Achillas, and borrow his legions to put out the fire.\n\n- You understand, Theodotus.\n\nI remain a prisoner.\n\n- A prisoner!\n\n- Will you stay and talk while the memory of mankind is burning?\n\n- I must go to save the library.\n\n- Follow him to the gate, Pothinus.\n\nAnd bid him urge his friends not to kill any more of my soldiers, for your sake.\n\n- My life will cost you dear if you take it, Caesar.\n\n- Already there?\n\n- [Centurion] All ready.\n\nWe wait for Caesar.\n\n- I have let Theodotus go to save the library.\n\nWe must respect literature, Rufio.\n\n- Aye!\n\nFolly on folly's head.\n\nI believe if you could bring back all the dead from Spain, Gaul and Thessaly to life, you would do it that we might have the trouble of fighting them over again.\n\n(Caesar laughs) - But my friend, every Egyptian we imprison, means imprisoning two Roman soldiers to guard him.\n\nEy?\n\n- I might have known there was some fox's trick behind your fine talking.\n\n- Is Britannus asleep?\n\nI sent him for my armor not an half hour ago.\n\nBritannicus!\n\nThou British islander.\n\n- [Britannus] Give me that.\n\n- I am going to dress you, Caesar.\n\n- Oh!\n\n- Sit down.\n\nThese Roman helmets are so becoming.\n\n(Cleopatra laughing) - What are you laughing at?\n\n- You're bald.\n\n(audience laughing) So that is why you wear the wreath, to hide it.\n\n- Peace, Egyptian.\n\nThey are the bays of the conqueror.\n\n- Peace, thou islander!\n\nYou should rub your head with strong spirits of sugar, Caesar.\n\nThat will make it grow.\n\n- Cleopatra, do you like to be reminded that you are very young?\n\n- No.\n\n- Neither do I like to be reminded that I am middle aged.\n\n(audience laughing) Now, I will give you 10 of my superfluous years.\n\nThat will make you 26 and leave me... Nevermind.\n\nIs it a bargain?\n\n- Agreed.\n\n26, mind.\n\n- 26.\n\n- Now.\n\nOh!\n\nHow nice.\n\nYou look only about 60 in it!\n\n(audience laughing) - You must not speak in this manner to Caesar.\n\n- Is it true that when Caesar caught you on that island, you were painted all over blue?\n\n- Blue is the color worn by all Britons of good standing.\n\nIn war, we stain our bodies blue, so that though our enemies may strip us of our clothes and our lives, they cannot strip us of our respectability.\n\n- Now, let me hang this on.\n\nOh!\n\nHow splendid you look.\n\nHave they made many statues of you in Rome?\n\n- Yes, many statues.\n\n- You must send for one and give it to me.\n\n- Now Caesar, have you done talking?\n\nThe moment your foot is aboard, there'll be no holding our men back.\n\nThe boats will race one another for the lighthouse.\n\n- Is this well set, Britannus.\n\nAt Pharsalia, it was as blunt as a barrel-hoop.\n\n- It will split one of the Egyptian's hairs today, Caesar.\n\nI have set it myself.\n\n- Oh, you are not really going into battle to be killed?\n\n- No, Cleopatra.\n\nNo man goes into battle to be killed.\n\n- But they do get killed.\n\nMy sister's husband was killed in battle.\n\nYou must not go.\n\nLet him go.\n\n(laughing) Oh please, please do not go.\n\nWhat will happen to me if you never come back?\n\n- Are you afraid?\n\n- No.\n\n- Go to the balcony, and see us take the Pharos.\n\nYou should learn to look on battles.\n\nThis is well.\n\nGo.\n\nCome, Rufio.\n\nLet us march.\n\n(Cleopatra screaming) - You will not be able to go!\n\n- Why?\n\nWhat now?\n\n- They are drying up the harbor with buckets.\n\nA multitude of soldiers over there.\n\nThey are dipping up all the water.\n\n- It's true, the Egyptian army, crawling over the western harborlike locusts.\n\nThis is your accursed clemency, Caesar.\n\nTheodotus has brought them.\n\n- As I meant him to, Rufio.\n\nThey have come to put out the fire.\n\nThe library will keep them busy while we seize the lighthouse, eh?\n\n- More foxing!\n\n- [Centurion] All aboard.\n\nGive way there.\n\n- Goodbye.\n\nGoodbye, dear Caesar.\n\nCome back safe.\n\nGoodbye!\n\nGoodbye!\n\n(gentle drum music) - Who goes there?\n\n- What's this?\n\nStand, who are you?\n\n- I am Apollodorus, the Sicilian.\n\nWhy, man, what are you dreaming of?\n\nSince coming through the lines beyond the theater there, I have brought my caravan past three sentinels, all so busy staring at the lighthouse that not one of them challenged me.\n\nIs this Roman discipline?\n\n- We are not here to watch the land but the sea.\n\nCaesar has just landed on the Pharos.\n\nWhat have you here?\n\nWho is this piece of Egyptian crockery?\n\n- Apollodorus, rebuke this Roman dog and bid him bridle his tongue in the presence of Ftatateeta.\n\nThe mistress of the queen's household.\n\n- My friend, this is a great lady, who stands high with Caesar.\n\n- And what is all this truck?\n\n- Carpets for the furnishing of the queen's apartments in the palace.\n\nI have picked them from the best carpets in the world, and the queen shall choose the best of my choosing.\n\n- So you are the carpet merchant?\n\n- My friend, I am a patrician.\n\n- A patrician?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- A patrician keeping a shop instead of following arms.\n\n- I do not keep a shop.\n\nMine is a temple of the arts.\n\nI'm a worshiper of beauty.\n\nMy calling is to choose beautiful things for beautiful queens.\n\nMy motto is art for art's sake.\n\n- That is not the password.\n\n- It is a universal password.\n\n- I know nothing about universal passwords.\n\nEither give me the password for the day or get back to your shop.\n\n- How if I do neither?\n\n- Then I will drive this pilum through you.\n\n- At your service, my friend.\n\n- Thrust your knife into the dog's throat, Apollodorus.\n\n- Curse on you!\n\nLet me go.\n\nHelp!\n\n- Stab the little Roman reptile.\n\nSpit him on your sword.\n\n- How now?\n\nWhat is all this?\n\n- Centurion, I am here by order of the queen to- - The queen!\n\nYes, yes.\n\nPass them in.\n\nPass all these bazaar people in to the queen, with their goods.\n\nBut mind you, let no one pass out that you have not passed in, not even the queen herself.\n\n- This old woman is dangerous.\n\n(Ftatateeta hissing) She is as strong as three men.\n\nShe wanted the merchant to stab me.\n\n- Centurion, I am not a merchant.\n\nI am a patrician and a votary of art.\n\n- Is the woman your wife?\n\n- No, no!\n\nNot that the lady is not a striking figure in her own way.\n\nBut she is not my wife.\n\n- Roman, I am Ftatateeta, the mistress of the queen's household.\n\n- Keep your hands off our men, mistress, or I will have you pitched into the harbor.\n\nTo your posts.\n\nMarch!\n\n- Ftatateeta, I have thought of something.\n\nI want a boat at once.\n\n- A boat?\n\nNo, no, you cannot.\n\nApollodorus, speak to the queen.\n\n- Beautiful queen, I am Apollodorus the Sicilian, your servant, from the bazaar.\n\nI have brought you the three most beautiful Persian carpets in the world to choose from.\n\n- I have no time for carpets today.\n\nGet me a boat.\n\n- What whim is this?\n\nYou cannot go out on the water except on the royal barge.\n\n- Royalty, Ftatateeta, lies not in the barge but in the queen.\n\nThe touch of your majesty's foot on the gunwale of the meanest boat in the harbor will make it royal.\n\nHo there, boatman!\n\nPull in to the dock.\n\n- Apollodorus, you are my perfect knight, and I shall always buy my carpets through you.\n\nCan you row, Apollodorus?\n\n- My oars shall be your majesty's wings.\n\nWhither shall I row my queen?\n\n- To the lighthouse.\n\nCome.\n\n- Stand.\n\nYou cannot pass.\n\n- How dare you?\n\nDo you know that I am the queen?\n\n- I have my orders.\n\nYou cannot pass.\n\n- I will make Caesar have you killed if you do not obey me.\n\n- He will do worse to me if I disobey my officer.\n\nStand back.\n\n- Ftatateeta, strangle him.\n\n- Keep off, there.\n\n- Apollodorus, make your slave help us.\n\n- I shall not need his help, lady.\n\nNow soldier, choose which weapon you will defend yourself with.\n\nShall it be sword against pilum, or sword against sword?\n\n- Roman against Sicilian.\n\nHo there.\n\nGuard.\n\n(grunting) - What is this?\n\nWhat now?\n\n- I could do well enough by myself if it wasn't for the old lady.\n\nJust keep her off me, that is all the help I need.\n\n- What has happened, soldier?\n\n- Centurion, he would have slain the queen.\n\n- I would, sooner than let her pass.\n\nShe wanted to take boat, and go, so she said, to the lighthouse.\n\nI stopped her, as I was ordered to, and she set this fellow on me.\n\n- Cleopatra, I am loathe to offend you.\n\nBut without Caesar's express words, we dare not let you pass beyond the Roman lines.\n\n- I am the queen.\n\nCaesar does not speak to me as you do.\n\nHave Caesar's centurions changed manner with his stallions?\n\n- I do my duty, that is enough for me.\n\n- Majesty, when a stupid man's doing something he is ashamed of, he always declares that it is his duty.\n\nHear my counsel, star of the east.\n\nUntil word comes to these soldiers from Caesar himself, you are a prisoner.\n\nLet me go to him with a message from you, and a present, and before the sun has stooped half way to the arms of the sea, I will bring you back Caesar's order of release.\n\n- Two more men to this post here, and see that no one leaves the palace except this man and his merchandise.\n\nAnd if he draws his sword again inside the lines, kill him.\n\nTo your posts.\n\nMarch.\n\n- Pearl of queens.\n\nCenturion is at hand.\n\nThe Roman soldier is incorruptible when his officer is looking.\n\nI must carry your word to Caesar.\n\n- Are these carpets very heavy?\n\n- It matters not how heavy.\n\n- And how do they put the carpets into boats?\n\nDo they throw them down?\n\n- Not into small boats, majesty.\n\nIt would sink them.\n\n- Not into that man's boat, for instance?\n\n- No.\n\nToo small.\n\n- But you can take a carpet in it to Caesar if I send one?\n\n- Assuredly.\n\n- And you promise not to let the porter drop it or throw it about?\n\n- Place the most delicate glass goblet in the palace in the heart of the roll, queen, and if it be broken, my head shall pay for it.\n\n- Good.\n\nCome, Ftatateeta.\n\nNo, Apollodorus, you must not come.\n\nI will choose one for myself.\n\n- Follow this lady.\n\n- This way, and take your shoes off before you put your feet on those stairs.\n\n- Listen, were you set here to watch me or to watch the Egyptians?\n\n- We know our duty.\n\n- Then why don't you do it?\n\nThere's something going on over there.\n\n- I don't need to be told what to do by the likes of you.\n\n- Blockhead.\n\nHo there, Centurion.\n\nHoiho!\n\n- Curse your meddling.\n\nHoiho!\n\nAlarm, alarm!\n\n- Alarm, alarm!\n\n- What now?\n\nHas the old woman attacked you again?\n\nAre you here still?\n\n- See there.\n\nThe Egyptians are moving.\n\nThey are going to recapture the Pharos.\n\nThey will attack by sea and land, by land along the causeway, by sea from the west harbor.\n\nStir yourselves, my military friends, the hunt is up.\n\n- Two extra men, pass the alarm to the south posts.\n\nOne man keep guard here.\n\nThe rest with me, quick.\n\n- You again?\n\n- Peace, Roman fellow.\n\nYou are now single-handed.\n\nApollodorus, this carpet is Cleopatra's present to Caesar.\n\nIt has rolled up in it 10 precious goblets of the thinnest Iberian crystal, and 100 eggs of the sacred blue pigeon.\n\nIn the name of the gods, Apollodorus, run no risks with that bale.\n\n- Fear not, thou venerable grotesque.\n\nI guess its great worth.\n\n- Do not sit on it!\n\nDo not sit on it.\n\nOh thou brute beast!\n\n- Be not excited, mistress.\n\nAll is well.\n\n- Farewell, Ftatateeta.\n\nI shall be at the lighthouse before the Egyptians.\n\n- May the gods speed thee and protect my nursling.\n\n(gentle music) - Well, my British islander.\n\nHave you been up to the top?\n\n- I have.\n\nI reckon it at 400 feet high.\n\n- Anybody up there?\n\n- One elderly Tyrian to work the crane, and his son.\n\nA well conducted youth of 14.\n\n- What?\n\nAn old man and a boy work that?\n\n20 men, you mean.\n\n- Two only, I assure you.\n\nThey have counterweights, and a machine with boiling water in it which I do not understand.\n\nIt is not of British design.\n\nThey use it to haul up barrels of oil and wood to burn in the brazier on the roof.\n\n- But- - Excuse me.\n\nI came down because there are messengers coming along the causeway to us.\n\nI must see what their business is.\n\n- Oh, this has been a mad expedition.\n\nWe shall be beaten.\n\nI wish I knew how our men are getting along down at the barricade.\n\n- Must I leave my food and go starving to bring you a report?\n\n- No, Rufio, no, no, no.\n\nEat, my son.\n\nEat.\n\nThe Egyptians cannot be so foolish as to storm the barricade before you are finished.\n\nThis is the first time I have ever run an avoidable risk.\n\nI should not have come to Egypt.\n\n- An hour ago you were all for victory.\n\n- Yes, I was a fool.\n\nRash, Rufio.\n\nBoyish.\n\n- Boyish?\n\nNot a bit of it.\n\nHere.\n\n- What are these for?\n\n- To eat.\n\nThat's what's the matter with you.\n\nWhen a man comes to your age, he runs down before his midday meal.\n\nEat, and then have another look at our chances.\n\n- My age, ey?\n\nOh yes, Rufio, I am an old man.\n\nWorn out now.\n\nTrue, quite true.\n\nAchillas is still in his prime and Ptolemy is a boy.\n\nOh well, every dog has his day and I've had mine, I cannot complain.\n\nThese dates are not bad, Rufio.\n\nWhat now?\n\n- Our brave Rhodian mariners have captured a treasure.\n\nThere!\n\nOur enemies are delivered into our hands.\n\n- In that bag?\n\n- Wait till you hear, Caesar.\n\nThis bag contains all the letters which have passed between Pompey's party and the army of occupation here.\n\n- Well?\n\n- Well, we shall now know who your foes are.\n\nThe name of every man who has plotted against you since you crossed the Rubicon may be in these papers, for all we know.\n\n- Put them in the fire.\n\n- Put them- - In the fire.\n\nYou expect me to waste the next three years of my life condemning men who will be my friends?\n\nWhen I have proved that my friendship more worthy than Pompey's was or Cato's is.\n\nO now, incorrigible British islander.\n\nAm I a bull dog to seek quarrels merely to show how stubborn my jaws are?\n\n- But your honor, the honor of Rome.\n\n- I do not make human sacrifices to my honor, as your Druids do.\n\nWell, since you will not burn these, at least I can drown them.\n\n- Caesar!\n\nThis is mere eccentricity.\n\nAre traitors to be allowed to go free for the sake of a paradox?\n\n- Caesar, when the islander stops preaching, call me again.\n\nI'm gonna go have a look at the boiling water machine.\n\n- O Caesar, my great master.\n\nIf I could but persuade you to regard life seriously, as men do in my country!\n\n- Do they truly do so, Britannus?\n\n- Have you not been there?\n\nHave you not seen them?\n\nWhat Briton speaks as you do in your moments of levity?\n\nWhat Briton wears clothes of many colors as you do, instead of plain blue, as all solid, well esteemed men should?\n\nThese are moral questions with us.\n\n- Well, well, one day I shall settle down and have a blue toga, perhaps.\n\n(audience laughing) Meanwhile, I must get on as best I can in my flippant Roman way.\n\n- What is this?\n\nWho are you?\n\nHow have you come here?\n\n- Calm yourself, my friend, I am not going to eat you.\n\nI have come by boat, from Alexandria, with precious gifts for Caesar.\n\n- From Alexandria!\n\n- This is Caesar, sir.\n\n- What's the matter now?\n\n- Hail, great Caesar!\n\nI am Apollodorus the Sicilian.\n\nAn artist.\n\n- An artist?\n\nWho admitted this vagabond?\n\n- Peace, man.\n\nApollodorus is a famous patrician amateur.\n\n- I crave the gentleman's pardon.\n\nI understood him to say that he was a professional.\n\n- You are welcome, Apollodorus.\n\nWhat is your business here?\n\n- First, to deliver to you a present from the queen of queens.\n\n- And who is that?\n\n- Cleopatra of Egypt?\n\n- Oh no, this is no time for playing with presents, Apollodorus.\n\nPray you, go back to the queen, and tell her that if all goes well I shall return to the palace this evening.\n\n- Caesar, I cannot return.\n\n- What?\n\n- As I approached the lighthouse, some fool threw a great leathern bag into the sea.\n\nIt broke the nose of my boat, and I had hardly time to save myself and my charge before my boat sank.\n\n- Oh, I am sorry, Apollodorus.\n\nThe fool shall be rebuked.\n\nWell, well, what have you brought me?\n\nThe queen will be hurt if I do not look at it.\n\n- Caesar, have we time to waste for this trumpery?\n\nThe queen is only a child.\n\n- Just so, that is why we must not disappoint her.\n\nWhat is the present, Apollodorus?\n\n- Caesar, it is a Persian carpet.\n\nA beauty!\n\nAnd in it are, so I am told, pigeons' eggs and crystal goblets and fragile precious things.\n\nI dare not for my head have it carried up that narrow ladder.\n\n- Well, swing it up by the crane.\n\nWe can give the eggs to the cook, drink our wine from the goblets, and the carpet can make a bed for Caesar.\n\n- The crane?\n\nCaesar, I have sworn to tender this bale of carpet as I tender my own life.\n\n- Well, let them swing you up at the same time.\n\nThen if the rope breaks, you and the pigeon eggs will perish together.\n\n(laughing) - Is Caesar serious?\n\n- His manner is frivolous because he is an Italian.\n\n(audience laughing) (audience applauding) But he means what he says.\n\n- Caesar, are you really gonna wait here for this foolishness or should we be at the barricade?\n\n- Fear not, my son Rufio.\n\nWhen the first Egyptian takes his first step along the great causeway, the alarm will sound.\n\nThen we two will reach the barricade from our end before the Egyptians reach it from their end.\n\nWe two, Rufio.\n\nI, the old man, and you, his biggest boy.\n\nBut the old man will be there first.\n\nSo peace, and give me some more dates.\n\n♪ Soho, haul away.\n\n♪ Soho The white upon the blue above is purple on the green below.\n\nEasy there, stop her.\n\nFurther round!\n\n- Lower away.\n\n- Mind the eggs.\n\n- Easy there gently.\n\nGently.\n\nHaul up.\n\n(Cleopatra gasping).\n\n- Oh, I am smothered.\n\nOh, Caesar, a man stood on me in the boat, and then a great sack of something fell upon me out of the sky.\n\nAnd then the boat sank, and then I was swooped up into the air and bumped down.\n\n(audience laughing) Aren't you glad to see me?\n\n- Yes, I'm very glad to see you.\n\nBut Rufio is very angry.\n\nAnd Britannus is shocked.\n\n(audience laughing) - You can have their heads cut off, can you not?\n\n- Well, they would not be quite so useful with their heads cut off as they are now, my sea bird.\n\n- We shall have to go away presently and cut some of your Egyptians' heads off.\n\nHow will you like being left here with the chance of being taken by that little brother of yours if we are beaten?\n\n- But you mustn't leave me alone.\n\nYou will not leave me, Caesar, will you?\n\n- What?\n\nNot when the trumpet sounds and all our lives depend on Caesar being at that barricade before the Egyptians reach it, hey?\n\n- Let them lose their lives.\n\nThey are only soldiers.\n\n- Cleopatra, when that trumpet sounds, we must take every man his life in his hand, and throw it in the face of death.\n\nAnd of my soldiers who have trusted me, there is not one whose hand I will not hold more sacred than your head.\n\nApollodorus, you must take her back to the palace.\n\n- Am I a dolphin, Caesar?\n\nTo cross the seas with young ladies on my back?\n\nMy boat is sunk.\n\nAll yours are either at the barricade or have returned to the city.\n\nI will hail one if I can, that is all I can do.\n\n- It does not matter.\n\nI will not go back.\n\nNobody cares for me.\n\nYou want me to be killed.\n\n- Oh, my poor child, your life means little here to anyone but yourself.\n\nCome, Rufio.\n\n- No!\n\nDon't leave me, Caesar.\n\n(soldiers clamoring) - Caesar, we are cut off.\n\nThe Egyptians have landed from the west harbor between us and the barricade.\n\n- It is true.\n\nWe are caught like rats in a trap.\n\n- Oh, Rufio, Rufio, my men are caught between the sea party and the shore party.\n\nI have murdered them.\n\n- Aye, that's what comes of fooling with this girl here.\n\n- Look over the parapet, Caesar.\n\n- We have looked, my friend.\n\nWe must defend ourselves here.\n\n- I have thrown the ladder into the sea.\n\nThey cannot get in without it.\n\n- Ay, and we cannot get out.\n\nHave you thought of that?\n\n- The Rhodian galleys are approaching us.\n\n- And by what road are we to walk to the galleys, pray?\n\n- By the road that leads to everywhere.\n\nThe diamond path of the sun and moon.\n\n- What are you talking about?\n\n- I will show you.\n\nDefend yourselves here until I send you a boat from that galley.\n\n- Have you wings, perhaps?\n\n- Water wings, soldier.\n\nBehold!\n\n- Bravo, bravo!\n\n(laughing) By Jupiter, I will do that too.\n\n(audience laughing) - You are mad.\n\nYou shall not.\n\n- Why not?\n\nCan I not swim as well as he?\n\n- Can an old fool dive and swim like a young one?\n\nHe is 25, you are- - Old?\n\n- Rufio, you forget yourself.\n\n- I will race you to the galley for a week's pay, father Rufio.\n\n- But me, me, me!\n\nWhat is to become of me?\n\n- Oh, I shall carry you on my back to the galley like a dolphin.\n\nRufio, when you see me rise to the surface, throw her in.\n\nI will answer for her.\n\nAnd then in after her, both of you.\n\n- No, no, no.\n\nI will be drowned.\n\n- Caesar, I am a man and a Briton, not a fish.\n\nI must have a boat.\n\nI cannot swim.\n\n- Neither can I.\n\n- Well, you two stay here alone, while I recapture the lighthouse, I will not forget you.\n\nNow, Rufio.\n\n- You've made up your mind to this foolishness?\n\n- Well, the Egyptians have made it up for me.\n\nWhat else is there to do?\n\nAnd mind how you jump.\n\nI do not wanna get your 14 stone in the small of my back as I come up.\n\nApollodorus!\n\n- Caesar.\n\n- The white upon the blue above- - [Apollodorus] Is purple on the green below.\n\n- Oh, let me see.\n\nHe shall be drowned.\n\nCaesar!\n\n- He has got her.\n\nHold the fort, Briton.\n\nCaesar will not forget you.\n\n- All safe, Rufio?\n\n- [Rufio] All safe.\n\n- The boat has reached him.\n\nThe boat has reached him.\n\nHip, hip, hurrah!\n\n(audience laughing) (gentle music) - [Soldiers] Hurrah!\n\n(audience applauding) - The queen speaks.\n\n- I want to learn how to play the harp with my own hands.\n\nCaesar loves music.\n\nCan you teach me?\n\n- Assuredly I and no one else can teach the queen.\n\nHave I not discovered the lost method of the ancient Egyptians, who could make a pyramid tremble by touching a bass string?\n\n(ladies laughing) All the other teachers are quacks.\n\nI have exposed them repeatedly.\n\n- Good!\n\nYou shall teach me.\n\nHow long will it take?\n\n- Not very long.\n\nOnly four years.\n\nYour Majesty must first become proficient in the philosophy of Pythagoras.\n\n- Has she become proficient in the philosophy of Pythagoras?\n\n- She is but a slave.\n\nShe learns as a dog learns.\n\n- Then, I shall learn as a dog learns, for she plays better than you.\n\nYou shall give me a lesson every day for a fortnight After that, each time I strike a false note, you shall be flogged.\n\nAnd if I strike so many that there is not time to flog you, you shall be thrown into the Nile to feed the crocodiles.\n\nGive the girl a gold piece and send them away.\n\n- But true art will not be thus forced.\n\n- What is this?\n\nAnswering the queen, forsooth.\n\nOut with you.\n\n(ladies laughing) - Now, can any of you amuse me?\n\nHave you any stories or any news?\n\n- Ftatateeta- - Oh, Ftatateeta, Ftatateeta.\n\nAlways Ftatateeta.\n\nSome new tale to set me against her.\n\n- No, this time Ftatateeta has been virtuous.\n\nPothinus has been trying to bribe her to let him speak with you.\n\n- You all sell audiences with me, as if I saw whom you please, and not whom I please.\n\nI should like to know how much of her gold piece that harp girl will have to give up before she leaves the palace.\n\n- We can easily find out that for you.\n\n(ladies laughing) - You laugh, but take care.\n\nTake care.\n\nI shall find out some day how to make myself served as Caesar is served.\n\n- Old hooknose.\n\n- Silence!\n\nCharmian, do not you be a silly little Egyptian fool.\n\nDo you know why I allow you all to chatter impertinently just as you please, instead of treating you as Ftatateeta would treat you if she were queen?\n\n- Because you try to imitate Caesar in everything, and he lets everybody say what they please to him.\n\n- No!\n\nBut because I asked him one day why he did so.\n\nand he said \"Let your women talk and you shall learn something from them.\"\n\n\"What can I learn from them?\"\n\nI asked.\n\n\"What they are,\" said he.\n\nAnd oh, you should have seen his eye as he said it.\n\nYou would have curled up, you shallow things.\n\n(ladies laughing) At whom are you laughing?\n\nAt me or at Caesar?\n\n- [Ladies] At Caesar.\n\n(ladies laughing) - If you were not fools, you would laugh at me, and if you were not cowards, you would not be afraid to tell me so.\n\nFtatateeta, they tell me that Pothinus has offered you a bribe to admit him to my presence.\n\n- By my father's gods- - Have I not told you not to deny things?\n\nGo take the bribe and bring in Pothinus.\n\nDo not answer me.\n\nGo.\n\n- Hey ho!\n\nI wish Caesar were back in Rome.\n\n- It will be a bad day for you all when he goes.\n\nOh, if I were not ashamed to let him see that I am as cruel at heart as my father, I would make you repent that speech.\n\nWhy do you wish him away?\n\n- He makes you so terribly serious and learned and philosophical.\n\nIt is worse than being religious at our ages.\n\n(ladies laughing) - Hold your tongues!\n\n- Well, well, we must try to live up to Caesar.\n\n- Pothinus craves the ear of the- - There, there, that will do, let him come in.\n\nWell, Pothinus, what is the latest news from your rebel friends?\n\n- I am no friend of rebellion, and a prisoner does not receive news.\n\n- You are no more a prisoner than I am, than Caesar is.\n\nThese past six months, we have been besieged in this palace by my subjects.\n\nYou are allowed to walk on the beach among the soldiers.\n\nCan I go further myself, or can Caesar?\n\n- You are but a child, Cleopatra, and do not understand these matters.\n\n- I see you do not know the latest news, Pothinus.\n\n- What is that?\n\n- That Cleopatra is no longer a child.\n\nShall I tell you how to grow much older, and much, much wiser in one day?\n\n- I should prefer to grow wiser without growing older.\n\n- Well, go up to the top of the lighthouse and throw yourself into the sea.\n\n(laughing) - She is right, Pothinus.\n\nYou will come to the shore with much conceit washed out of you.\n\nBe gone.\n\nI will speak with Pothinus alone.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n- It is not meet that the queen remain alone with- - Ftatateeta!\n\nMust I sacrifice you to your father's gods to teach you that I am the queen of Egypt, and not you?\n\n- You are like the rest of them.\n\nYou want to be what these Romans call a new woman.\n\n(audience laughing) - Cleopatra, what they tell me is true.\n\nYou are changed.\n\n- Speak with Caesar every day for six months, and you will be changed.\n\nWhen I was foolish, I did just what I liked.\n\nBut now that Caesar has made me wise, it is no use my liking or disliking, I do what must be done, and have no time to attend to myself.\n\nThat is not happiness, but it is greatness.\n\nIf Caesar were gone, I think I could govern the Egyptians.\n\nFor what Caesar is to me, I am to the fools around me.\n\n- Cleopatra, this may be the vanity of youth.\n\n- No, it is not that I am so clever, but that the others are so stupid.\n\n(audience laughing) Well now, tell me what it is you came to say?\n\n- I?\n\nNothing.\n\n- Nothing?\n\n- At least-to beg for my liberty, that is all.\n\n- For that, you would have knelt to Caesar.\n\nNo, Pothinus, you came here with some plan that depended on Cleopatra being a little nursery kitten.\n\nAnd now that Cleopatra is a queen, the plan is upset.\n\n- Is Cleopatra then indeed a queen, and no longer Caesar's prisoner and slave?\n\n- Pothinus, we are all Caesar's slaves.\n\nAll of us here in Egypt, whether we will it or no.\n\nAnd she who is wise enough to know this will reign when Caesar departs.\n\n- You harp on Caesar's departure.\n\nDoes he not love you?\n\n- Love me?\n\nPothinus, Caesar loves no one.\n\nWho are those we love?\n\nOnly those who we do not hate.\n\nAll people are strangers and enemies to us except for those we love.\n\nIt is not so with Caesar.\n\nHe has no hatred in him.\n\nHe makes friends with everyone as he does with dogs or children.\n\nHis kindness to me is a wonder.\n\nNeither father, mother, nor nurse have ever shown so much care for me.\n\n- But how can you be sure that he does not love you as men love women?\n\n- Because I cannot make him jealous.\n\nI have tried.\n\n- Perhaps I should have asked then, do you love him?\n\n- Can one love a god?\n\nBesides, I love another Roman.\n\nOne whom I saw long before Caesar.\n\nNot a god, but a man.\n\nOne who could hate and love.\n\nOne whom I could hurt and who would hurt me.\n\n- Does Caesar know this?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- And he is not angry?\n\n- He promises to send him to Egypt to please me!\n\n- I do not understand this man.\n\n- You?\n\nUnderstand Caesar?\n\nHow could you?\n\n- Your Majesty caused me to be admitted today.\n\nWhat message has the queen for me?\n\n- This.\n\nYou think that by making my brother king, you will rule in Egypt, because you are his guardian.\n\n- The queen is pleased to say so.\n\n- The queen is pleased to say this.\n\nThat Caesar will eat you up, and Achillas, and my brother, as a cat eats up mice, and he will put on this land of Egypt as a shepherd puts on his garment.\n\nAnd when he has done so, he will depart for Rome and leave Cleopatra here as his viceroy.\n\n- That he shall never do.\n\nWe have 1000 men to his 10, and we will drive him and his beggarly legions into the sea.\n\n- You rant like a common fellow.\n\nGo, then, and marshal your thousands and make haste, for Mithridates of Pergamos is at hand with reinforcements for Caesar.\n\nCaesar has kept you at bay with two legions.\n\nWe shall see what he can do with 20.\n\n- Cleopatra.\n\n- Enough.\n\nCaesar has spoiled me for talking to weak things like you.\n\n- Let me go forth from this hateful place.\n\n- What angers you?\n\n- She has sold her country to the Roman, that she may buy it back from him with her kisses.\n\nThe curse of all the gods of Egypt be upon her.\n\n- Enough of your gods.\n\nCaesar's gods are all powerful here.\n\nIt is no use you coming to Cleopatra.\n\nYou are only an Egyptian.\n\nShe will not listen to any of her own race.\n\nShe treats us all like children.\n\n- May she perish for it.\n\n- May your tongue wither for that wish!\n\nGo.\n\nSend for Lucius Septimius, the slayer of Pompey.\n\nHe is a Roman, maybe she will listen to him.\n\nGo, be gone!\n\n- I know to whom I must go now.\n\n- To whom, then?\n\n- To a greater Roman than Lucius.\n\nWhilst I live, she shall never rule.\n\nSo guide yourself accordingly.\n\n(upbeat music) (panting) - Ooh!\n\nThat was a climb.\n\nHow high have we come?\n\n- We are on the palace roof, O Beloved of Victory!\n\n- Good!\n\nThe Beloved of Victory has no more stairs to get up.\n\n- Ah, there you are, Rufio my son.\n\nWhy, Rufio!\n\nA new baldrick.\n\nAnd a new golden pommel to your sword.\n\nAnd you've had your hair cut.\n\nBut not your beard.\n\nImpossible!\n\nOh yes, perfumed by Jupiter Olympus!\n\n- Well, is it to please myself?\n\n- No, to please me my son, to celebrate my birthday.\n\n- Your birthday?\n\n- Uh-huh.\n\n- You always have a birthday.\n\nWhenever there is a pretty girl to be flattered or an ambassador to be conciliated.\n\nWe had seven of them in 10 months last year.\n\n- Yes, that's quite true, Rufio.\n\nI shall never break myself of these petty deceits.\n\n- Who is to dine with us besides Cleopatra?\n\n- Apollodorus the Sicilian.\n\n- That popinjay!\n\n- Come now, that popinjay is an amusing dog.\n\nHe tells a story, sings a song, saves us the trouble of flattering the queen.\n\nWhat does she care about old politicians, camp fed bears, Roman doers and drudgers like us?\n\nNo, Apollodorus is good company, good company.\n\nGive me a good talker.\n\nOne with enough wit and imagination to live without continually doing something.\n\n- Ay!\n\nA nice time he would have of it with you when dinner was over.\n\nHave you noticed I am before my time?\n\n- Yes, I thought there was something.\n\nWhat is it?\n\n- Can we be overheard here?\n\n- Our privacy invites eavesdropping.\n\nI can remedy that.\n\nNow everybody can see us, nobody will think of listening to us.\n\nPothinus wants to speak to you.\n\nI advise you to see him.\n\nThere is some plotting going on here among the women.\n\n- Pothinus, who is Pothinus?\n\n- The fellow with hair like squirrel's fur.\n\n- I don't know.\n\n- The little king's protector whom you kept prisoner.\n\n- Ah, has he not escaped?\n\n- No.\n\n- Why not?\n\nHow often have I told you, always let the prisoners escape?\n\nHave we not enough mouths to feed without him?\n\n- Yes!\n\nAnd if you would have a little sense and let me cut his throat, you would save his rations.\n\nAnyway, he won't escape.\n\nHe prefers to stay here and spy on us.\n\nSo what I do, if I had to deal with generals subject to fits of clemency.\n\n- And he wants to see me?\n\n- Yes!\n\nI brought him with me.\n\nHe's waiting over there under guard.\n\n- And you want me to see him?\n\n- I don't want anything.\n\nI daresay you will do as you like.\n\nDon't put it on to me.\n\n- Well, let's have him, let's have him, let's have him.\n\n- Ho there, guard!\n\nRelease your man and send him up.\n\nCome along!\n\n- Ah, you are welcome, Pothinus!\n\nWhat is the news this afternoon?\n\n- Caesar, I come to warn you of a danger, and to make you an offer.\n\n- Well, never mind the danger.\n\nWhat's the offer?\n\n- Never mind the offer.\n\nWhat's the danger?\n\n- Caesar, you think that Cleopatra is devoted to you.\n\n- My friend, I already know what I think.\n\nCome to your offer.\n\n- I will deal plainly.\n\nI know not by what strange gods you have been enabled to defend a palace and a few yards of beach against a city and an army.\n\nYou are a worker of miracles.\n\nI no longer threaten you.\n\n- Oh.\n\nvery handsome of you, indeed.\n\n- So be it, you are the master.\n\n- Spit it out, man.\n\nWhat have you to say?\n\n- I have to say that you have a traitress in your camp.\n\nCleopatra- - The queen!\n\n- You should have spat it out sooner, you fool.\n\nNow it is too late.\n\n- What is he doing here?\n\n- Oh, just going to tell me something about you.\n\nYou should hear this.\n\nProceed, Pothinus.\n\n- Caesar!\n\n- Out with it, man.\n\n- What I have to say is for your ear, not the queen's.\n\n- There are means of making you speak.\n\n- Caesar does not employ those means.\n\n- My friend, when a man has anything to tell in this world, the difficulty is not to make him tell it, but to prevent him from telling it too often.\n\nLet me celebrate my birthday by setting you free.\n\nFarewell, we shall not meet again.\n\n- Caesar, this mercy is foolish.\n\n- Will you not give me a private audience?\n\nYour life may depend on it.\n\n- [Rufio] Now off with you, you have lost your chance.\n\n- I will speak.\n\n- You see.\n\nTorture would not have wrung a word from him.\n\n(audience laughing) - Caesar, you have taught Cleopatra the art by which the Romans govern the world.\n\n- Alas!\n\nthey cannot even govern themselves.\n\nWhat then?\n\n- What then?\n\nAre you so besotted with her beauty that you do not see that she is impatient to reign in Egypt alone, and that her heart is set on your departure?\n\n- Liar!\n\n- (chuckles) Protestations!\n\nContradictions!\n\n- No.\n\nI do not deign to contradict.\n\nLet him talk.\n\n- From her own lips I have heard it.\n\nYou are to be her catspaw.\n\nYou are to tear the crown from her brother's head and set it on her own, delivering us all into her hands, delivering yourself also.\n\nAnd then Caesar can return to Rome, or depart through the gate of death, which is nearer and surer.\n\n- Well, my friend, is not all this very natural?\n\n- Natural?\n\nThen you do not resent treachery?\n\n- Resent?\n\nO thou foolish Egyptian.\n\nWhat have I to do with resentment?\n\nDo I resent the wind when it chills me, or the night when it makes me stumble in darkness?\n\nShall I resent youth when it turns from age, and ambition when it turns from servitude?\n\nTo tell me such a story as this is but to tell me that the sun will rise tomorrow.\n\n- But it is false.\n\nFalse, I swear it.\n\n- It is true, though you swore it a thousand times, and believed all you swore.\n\nCome, Rufio.\n\nWe will see Pothinus past the guard.\n\nI have a word to say to him.\n\nWe must give the queen a moment to recover herself.\n\nCome, Pothinus.\n\nAnd tell your friends, not to think that I'm opposed to a reasonable settlement.\n\n- Ftatateeta.\n\nFtatateeta!\n\n- Peace, child.\n\nBe comforted.\n\n- Can they hear us?\n\n- No, dear heart, no.\n\n- Listen to me.\n\nIf he leaves this palace alive, never see my face again.\n\n- He?\n\nPothinus- - Strike out his life as I strike his name from your lips.\n\nDash him from the walls.\n\nBreak him on the stones.\n\nKill him.\n\n- The dog shall perish.\n\n- Come soon.\n\nSoon.\n\nOh, you have come back to me, Caesar.\n\nI thought you were angry with me.\n\nWelcome, Apollodorus.\n\n- Cleopatra grows more womanly beautiful from week to week.\n\n(Cleopatra giggling) (audience laughing) - Truth, Apollodorus.\n\n- Far, far short of the truth.\n\nCleopatra tossed a pearl into the sea, Caesar fished up a diamond.\n\n- Caesar fished up a touch of rheumatism, my friend.\n\nCome, dinner, dinner!\n\n- Yes, to dinner.\n\nI have ordered such a dinner for you, Caesar!\n\n- And what are we to have?\n\n- Peacocks' brains.\n\n- Peacocks' brains, Apollodorus!\n\n- Not for me.\n\nI prefer nightingales' tongues.\n\n- Roast boar, Rufio!\n\n- Good.\n\n- What has become of my leathern cushion?\n\n- I have got new ones for you.\n\n- These cushions, Caesar, are of Maltese gauze, stuffed with rose leaves.\n\n- Rose leaves?\n\nAm I a caterpillar?\n\n- What a shame!\n\nMy new cushions!\n\n- What shall we serve to whet Caesar's appetite?\n\n- What have we got?\n\n- Sea hedgehogs, black and white sea acorns, sea nettles, beccaficoes, purple shellfish- - Any oysters?\n\n- Assuredly.\n\n- British oysters?\n\n- British oysters, Caesar.\n\n- I have been in Britain, in search of its famous pearl.\n\nThe British pearl is a fable.\n\nBut in searching for it, I found the British oyster.\n\n- All posterity will bless you for it.\n\nThe sea hedgehogs for me.\n\n- Is there nothing solid to begin with?\n\n- Fieldfares with asparagus.\n\n- Fattened fowls.\n\nHave some fattened fowls, Rufio.\n\n- Aye, that will do.\n\n- Fieldfares for me.\n\n- Caesar will deign to choose his wine?\n\nSicilian, Lesbian, Chian.\n\n- All Greek?\n\n- Who would drink Roman wine when he could get Greek?\n\n- Try the Lesbian, Caesar.\n\n- No, no, no.\n\nFetch me my barley water.\n\n- It is a waste of time giving you dinner, Caesar.\n\nMy scullions would not condescend to your diet.\n\n- Well, well, let's try the Lesbian.\n\nWhen I return to Rome, I shall make laws against these extravagances.\n\nI shall even get the laws carried out.\n\n(laughing) - Never mind.\n\nToday, you are to be like other people.\n\nIdle, luxurious and kind.\n\n- Well, I will sacrifice my comfort for this once.\n\nThere.\n\nNow, are you satisfied?\n\n- I am satisfied.\n\nAnd you no longer believe that I long for your departure for Rome?\n\n- I no longer believe in anything.\n\nMy brains are asleep.\n\nBesides, who knows whether I shall return to Rome?\n\n- How?\n\nEh, what?\n\n- What has Rome to show me that I have not already seen?\n\nOne year of Rome is like another, except that I grow older, and the crowd in the Appian Way is always the same age.\n\n- It is no different here in Egypt.\n\nThe old men, when they are tired of life, say \"We have seen everything except the source of the Nile.\"\n\n- Why not see that?\n\nCleopatra, will you come with me and track the flood to its cradle in the heart of the regions of mystery?\n\nShall we leave Rome behind us?\n\nRome, that has achieved greatness only to learn how greatness can destroy nations of men who are not great?\n\nShall I make you a new kingdom, and build you a holy city there in the great unknown?\n\n- Yes.\n\nYes, you shall.\n\n- Let us name the holy city, and consecrate it with Lesbian wine.\n\n- Cleopatra shall name it herself.\n\n- It shall be called Caesar's Gift to his Beloved.\n\n- No, no.\n\nSomething vaster than that.\n\nSomething universal, like the starry firmament.\n\n- Why not simply The Cradle of the Nile?\n\n- No, the Nile is my ancestor, and he is a god.\n\nOh!\n\nI have thought of something.\n\nThe Nile shall name it himself.\n\nLet us send for him, call upon him, and away with you all.\n\nI shall have my city named by nobody but my dear little sphinx.\n\nFor it was in its arms that Caesar found me asleep.\n\nGo.\n\nI am the priestess here.\n\n- Propose the conjuration.\n\n- You must say with me \"Send us thy voice, Father Nile.\"\n\n- [All] Send us thy voice, Father Nile.\n\n(man groaning) - What was that?\n\n- Nothing.\n\nThey are beating some slave.\n\n- [Caesar] Nothing?\n\n- A man with a knife in him, I'll swear.\n\n- Murder?\n\n- Silence.\n\nDid you hear that?\n\n- Another cry?\n\n- No, a thud.\n\nSomething fell on the beach, I think.\n\n- Something with bones in it, eh?\n\n- Apollodorus, go down to the courtyard and find out what has happened.\n\n- Your soldiers have killed somebody, perhaps.\n\nWhat does it matter?\n\n(distant clamoring) - The queen looks again on the face of her servant.\n\n- Cleopatra, what has happened?\n\n- I have been here with you all the time, Caesar.\n\nHow can I know what has happened?\n\n- Yes, that is true.\n\n- I shall know presently.\n\nNow, mistress, I shall want you.\n\n- My place is with the queen.\n\n- She has done no harm, Rufio.\n\n- [Caesar] No, no, let her stay.\n\n- Very well.\n\nMy place is here then too.\n\nYou can see for yourself what is the matter.\n\nThe city is in a pretty uproar, it seems.\n\n- Rufio, there is a time for obedience.\n\n- And there is a time for obstinacy.\n\n- Send her away.\n\n- Yes.\n\nYes.\n\nI shall do whatever you ask me, Caesar, always, because I love you.\n\nFtatateeta, go away.\n\n- The queen's word is my will.\n\nI shall stay at hand for the queen's call.\n\n- Caesar, remember, your bodyguard is also within call.\n\n- Why do you allow Rufio to treat you so?\n\nYou should teach him his place.\n\n- Teach him to be my enemy, and to hide his thoughts from me as you are now hiding yours?\n\n- Why do you say that, Caesar?\n\nIndeed, indeed, I am not hiding anything.\n\nYou are wrong to treat me like this.\n\nI am only a child, and you turn to stone because you think some one has been killed.\n\nI cannot bear it.\n\n- What has frightened you into this?\n\nWhat have you done?\n\n(gentle music) That sounds like the answer.\n\n- I have not betrayed you, Caesar, I swear it.\n\n- [Caesar] Lucius Septimius.\n\n- The town has gone mad, I think.\n\nThey're all for tearing down the palace and driving us into the sea straight away.\n\nWe laid hold of this renegade in clearing them out of the courtyard.\n\n- Release him.\n\nWhat has offended the citizens, Lucius?\n\n- What did you expect, Caesar?\n\nPothinus was a favorite of theirs.\n\n- What has happened to Pothinus?\n\nI set him free, here, not half an hour ago.\n\nDid they not pass him out?\n\n- Aye, through the gallery arch 60 feet above ground, with three inches of steel in his ribs.\n\nHe is as dead as Pompey.\n\nWe're even now, as to killing, you and I.\n\n- Assassinated!\n\nOur prisoner, our guest!\n\nRufio!\n\n- Whoever did it was a wise man and a friend of yours, but we had no hand in it.\n\nSo there's no point in frowning at me.\n\n- He was slain by the order of the queen of Egypt.\n\nI am not Julius Caesar the dreamer, who allows every slave to insult him.\n\nRufio has said I did well, now the others shall judge me too.\n\nThis Pothinus sought to make me conspire with him to betray Caesar to Achillas and Ptolemy.\n\nI refused, and he cursed me and came privily to Caesar to accuse me of his own treachery.\n\nI caught him in the act, and he insulted me.\n\nMe, the queen, to my face.\n\nCaesar would not avenge me.\n\nHe spoke him fair and set him free.\n\nWas I right to avenge myself?\n\nSpeak, Lucius.\n\n- I do not deny it, but you will get little thanks from Caesar for it.\n\n- Apollodorus, speak.\n\nWas I wrong?\n\n- I have only one word of blame, most beautiful.\n\nYou should have called upon me, your knight, and in a fair duel I should have slain the slanderer.\n\n- I shall now be judged by your very slave, Caesar.\n\nBritannus, speak.\n\nWas I wrong?\n\n- Caesar is in the wrong.\n\n- So the verdict is against me, it seems.\n\n- Listen to me, Caesar.\n\nIf one man in all of Alexandria can be found to say I did wrong, I swear to have myself crucified to the palace doors by my own slaves.\n\n- If one man in all the world can be found, now and forever, to know that you did wrong, that man will have either to conquer the world as I have, or be crucified by it.\n\nDo you hear?\n\nThese knockers at your gate are also believers in vengeance and in stabbing.\n\nYou have slain their leader.\n\nIt is right that they shall slay you.\n\nIf you doubt that, ask your counselors here.\n\nAnd in the name of that right, shall I not slay them for murdering their queen, and be slain in my turn by their countrymen as the invader of their fatherland?\n\nCan Rome do less then than slay these slayers too, to show the world how she avenges her sons and her honor?\n\nAnd so, to the end of history, murder shall breed murder, and always in the name of right and honor and peace, until the gods are tired of blood and create a race that can understand.\n\nNow, hearken to me, you who must not be insulted.\n\nLet the queen of Egypt now give her orders for vengeance, and take her measures for defense, for she has renounced Caesar.\n\nAnd you, soldiers, gentlemen, servants, honest servants as you forget that you are, applaud this assassination and say, \"Caesar is in the wrong.\"\n\nBy the gods, I am tempted to open my hand and let you all sink into the floods.\n\n- If you do, Caesar, you will perish yourself.\n\n- Will you desert us because we are a parcel of fools?\n\nI mean no harm in killing.\n\nI do it as a cat, by instinct.\n\nWe are all dogs at your heels, but we have served you faithfully.\n\n- Alas, Rufio, as dogs we are like to perish now in the streets.\n\n- (sobbing) But I do not want to die.\n\n- Oh, ignoble, ignoble!\n\nWe have flung them down their hero, murdered, and every man of them is set upon clearing out this nest of assassins, for such we are and no more.\n\nTake courage then, sharpen your sword.\n\nFor Pompey's head has fallen and Caesar's head is ripe.\n\n- Does Caesar despair?\n\n- He who has never hoped can never despair.\n\nNo, no, I look my fate in the face.\n\n- Look it in the face, then, and it will smile as it always has on Caesar.\n\n- You presume to encourage me?\n\n- I offer you my services.\n\nI will change sides if you will have me.\n\n- What?\n\nAt this point?\n\n- At this point.\n\n- Do you suppose Caesar is mad to trust you?\n\n- I do not ask him to trust me until he is victorious.\n\nI ask for my life, and for a command in Caesar's army.\n\nAnd since Caesar is a fair dealer, I will pay in advance.\n\n- Pay?\n\nHow?\n\n- With a piece of good news for you.\n\n- What news?\n\n(Caesar laughs) - What news?\n\nWhat news, did you say, Rufio?\n\nThe relief has arrived, what other news remains for us?\n\nIs that not so, Lucius?\n\nMithridates of Pergamos is on the march.\n\n- He has taken Pelusium.\n\n(all cheering) - Lucius Septimius, henceforth you are my officer.\n\nRufio, the Egyptians must have sent every soldier from the city to prevent Mithridates crossing the Nile.\n\nThere's nothing in the streets now but mob, mob!\n\n- It is so.\n\nMithridates is marching by the great road to Memphis to cross above the Delta.\n\nAchillas will fight him there.\n\n- Achillas will fight Caesar there.\n\nSee, Rufio.\n\nHere is the palace and there is the theater.\n\nNow, you take 20 men and pretend to go up this street.\n\nAnd while they are stoning you, (all laughing) out go the cohorts up this and this.\n\nAway, Britannus, tell Petronius that within the hour, half our forces must take ship for the western lake.\n\nSee to my horse and armor, for the rest, I will march round the lake and then up the Nile to meet Mithridates.\n\nAway, Lucius, give the word.\n\nAnd now Apollodorus, my artist friend, lend me your sword and your right arm for this campaign.\n\n- Aye, and my heart and my life to boot.\n\n- I accept both.\n\n- Come, this is something like business.\n\n- Is it not, my only son.\n\n(gentle music) Come, let us speak to the troops, hearten them.\n\nI to the beach, you to the courtyard.\n\n- Caesar!\n\n- Hey.\n\n- Have you forgotten me?\n\n- No, no, I'm busy now, child.\n\nBusy.\n\nWhen I return, your affairs shall be settled.\n\nFairwell.\n\nBe good.\n\nAnd patient.\n\n(somber music) - The game has been played and lost, Cleopatra.\n\nThe woman always gets the worst of it.\n\n- Go, follow your master.\n\n- A word first.\n\nTell your executioner, that if Pothinus had been properly killed, either throat, he would not have called out.\n\nYour man bungled his work.\n\nHow do you know it was a man?\n\n- It was not you.\n\nYou were with us when it happened.\n\nWas it she?\n\nWith her own hand?\n\n- Whoever it was, let my enemies beware of her.\n\nLook to it, Rufio.\n\nYou who dare make the queen of Egypt a fool before Caesar.\n\n- I will look to it, Cleopatra.\n\n- [Soldiers] Hail, Caesar!\n\nHail, Caesar!\n\n(somber music) - Ftatateeta.\n\nFtatateeta.\n\nIt is dark and I am alone.\n\nCome to me.\n\nI am alone.\n\nFtatateeta.\n\nFtatateeta.\n\n(screaming) (dramatic music) - Hello!\n\nMay I pass?\n\n- Pass Apollodorus the Sicilian there.\n\n- Is Caesar at hand?\n\n- Not yet.\n\nHe is still in the market place.\n\n- Tell us the news.\n\n- The little king Ptolemy was drowned.\n\nCaesar attacked them from three sides at once and swept them into the Nile.\n\nPtolemy's barge sank.\n\n- A marvelous man, this Caesar!\n\n(dramatic music) - Here he comes.\n\n- [Centurion] Attention there!\n\nCaesar comes.\n\n- I see my ship awaits me.\n\nThe hour of Caesar's farewell to Egypt has arrived.\n\nAnd now, Rufio, what remains to be done before I go?\n\n- You have not yet appointed a Roman governor for this province.\n\n- What say you to Mithridates of Pergamos, my reliever and rescuer?\n\n- Why, that you will need him elsewhere.\n\nHave you forgotten that you have three or four armies to conquer on your way home?\n\n- Ah, indeed!\n\nWell, what say you to yourself?\n\n- I?\n\n(chuckles) A governor.\n\nWhat are you dreaming of?\n\nDo you not know that I am but the son of a freedman?\n\n- Well, has not Caesar called you his son?\n\nPeace awhile and hear me.\n\n- Hear Caesar.\n\n- Hear the service, quality, rank and name of the Roman governor.\n\nBy service, Caesar's shield.\n\nBy quality, Caesar's friend.\n\nBy rank, a Roman soldier.\n\nAnd by name, Rufio.\n\n- [Soldiers] Rufio!\n\n- Aye, I am Caesar's shield, but of what use will I be when I am no longer on Caesar's arm?\n\nWell, no matter.\n\n- And now, where is that British islander of mine?\n\n- Here, Caesar.\n\n- Who bade you, pray, thrust yourself into the battle of the Delta, uttering the barbarous cries of your native land, while affirming yourself a match for any four of the Egyptians, to whom you applied unseemly epithets?\n\n- Caesar, I ask you to excuse the language that escaped me in the heat of the moment.\n\n- And how did you, who cannot swim, cross the canal with us when we stormed the camp?\n\n- Caesar, I clung to the tail of your horse.\n\n- These are not the deeds of a slave, Britannicus, but of a free man.\n\n- Caesar, I was born free.\n\n- [Caesar] But they call you Caesar's slave.\n\n- Only as Caesar's slave have I found real freedom.\n\n- Well said.\n\nUngrateful that I am, I was about to set you free.\n\nBut now I will not part from you for a million talents.\n\nApollodorus, I leave the art of Egypt in your charge.\n\nRemember, Rome loves art and will encourage it ungrudgingly.\n\n- I understand, Caesar.\n\nRome will produce no art itself, but it will buy up and take away whatever the other nations produce.\n\n- What, Rome produce no art?\n\nIs peace not an art?\n\nIs war not an art?\n\nIs government not an art?\n\nIs civilization not an art?\n\nAll these we give you freely in exchange for a few ornaments.\n\nYou shall have the best of the bargain.\n\nAnd now, what else have I to do before I embark?\n\nThere is something.\n\nI cannot remember.\n\nWhat can it be?\n\nOh well, it will have to remain undone, we must not waste this favorable wind.\n\n- Caesar, I am loathe to let you return to Rome without your shield.\n\nThere are too many daggers there.\n\n- It is no matter.\n\nI shall finish my life's work on my way back and then I shall have lived long enough.\n\nBesides, I have always disliked the idea of dying.\n\nI had rather be killed.\n\nFarewell.\n\nFarewell, Apollodorus, and my friends, all of you.\n\nAboard!\n\n- Has Cleopatra no part in this leave taking?\n\n- Ah!\n\nI knew there was something.\n\nRufio, how could you let me forget her?\n\nHad I gone without seeing you, I should never have forgiven myself.\n\nIs this mourning for me?\n\n- No.\n\n- Oh, that was thoughtless of me!\n\nIt is for your brother.\n\n- No.\n\n- But for who, then?\n\n- Ask the Roman governor whom you have left us.\n\n- Rufio?\n\n- Yes, Rufio.\n\nHe who is to rule here in Caesar's name, in Caesar's way, according to Caesar's boasted laws of life.\n\n- Well, he will rule as best he can, Cleopatra, and in his own way.\n\n- Not in your way, then?\n\n- What do you mean by my way?\n\n- Without punishment.\n\nWithout revenge.\n\nWithout judgment.\n\n- Aye, that is the right way, the great way, the only possible way in the end.\n\nBelieve it, Rufio, if you can.\n\n- I believe it, Caesar.\n\nYou convinced me of it long ago.\n\nBut look you.\n\nYou are sailing today for Numidia.\n\nNow tell me, if you meet a hungry lion there, you will not punish it for wanting to eat you?\n\n- No.\n\n- Nor revenge upon it the blood of those it has already eaten?\n\n- [Caesar] No.\n\n- [Rufio] Nor judge it for its guiltiness?\n\n- No.\n\n- What, then, will you do to save your life from it?\n\n- I kill it, man, without malice, just as it would kill me.\n\nBut what does this parable of the lion mean?\n\n- Why, Cleopatra had a tigress that killed men at her bidding.\n\nI thought she might bid it kill you some day.\n\nNow, had I not been Caesar's pupil, what pious things might I have done to that tigress?\n\nI might have punished it.\n\nI might have revenged Pothinus on it.\n\n- Pothinus!\n\n- I might have judged it.\n\nBut I put all these follies behind me, and without malice, only cut its throat.\n\nAnd that is why Cleopatra comes to you in mourning.\n\n- He has shed the blood of my servant, Ftatateeta.\n\nOn your head be it as upon his, Caesar, if you hold him free of it.\n\n- Well, on my head be it, then, for it was well done.\n\nRufio, if you had set yourself in the seat of the judge, and handed this woman over to some hired executioner to be slain before the people in the name of justice, never again would I have touched your hand without a shudder.\n\nBut this was natural slaying, I feel no horror at it.\n\n- No, not when a Roman kills an Egyptian.\n\nAll the world will now see how unjust and corrupt Caesar is.\n\n- Come now, do not be angry with me.\n\nI am sorry for that poor Totateeta.\n\n(both laughing) You're laughing.\n\nDoes this mean reconciliation?\n\n- No, no, no!\n\nBut it is so ridiculous to hear you call her Totateeta.\n\n- As much a child as ever, Cleopatra!\n\nHave I not made a woman of you after all?\n\n- Oh, it is you who are a great baby.\n\nYou make me seem silly because you will not behave seriously.\n\nBut you have treated me badly and I do not forgive you.\n\n- Oh, bid me farewell.\n\n- I will not.\n\n- I will send you a beautiful present from Rome.\n\n- Beauty from Rome to Egypt indeed.\n\nWhat can Rome give me that Egypt cannot give me?\n\n- That is true, Caesar.\n\nIf the present is to be really beautiful, I shall have to buy it for you in Alexandria.\n\n- You are forgetting, my friend, the treasures for which Rome is most famous.\n\nYou cannot buy them in Alexandria.\n\n- What are they, Caesar?\n\n- Her sons.\n\nForgive me, bid me farewell, and I will send you a man.\n\nRoman from head to heel and Roman of the noblest, not old and ripe for the knife, not lean in the arms and cold in the heart, not hiding a bald head nor stooped with the weight of the world on his shoulders; but fresh and brisk and strong and young, hoping in the morning, fighting in the day, reveling in the evening.\n\nWill you take such a one in exchange for Caesar?\n\n- His name?\n\nHis name?\n\n- Shall it be Mark Antony?\n\n- You are a bad hand at a bargain, mistress, if you will swap Caesar for Antony.\n\n- Now, you are satisfied?\n\n- I am satisfied.\n\nYou will not forget.\n\n- I will not forget.\n\nI do not think we shall meet again.\n\nFarewell.\n\n- [Soldiers] Hail, Caesar.\n\n- No tears, dearest queen.\n\nThey stab your servant to the heart.\n\nHe will return some day.\n\n- I hope not.\n\nBut I cannot help crying, all the same.\n\n- [Soldiers] Hail, Caesar!\n\n(dramatic music) (audience applauding) (upbeat drum music)
