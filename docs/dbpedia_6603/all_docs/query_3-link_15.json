        "text": "Some people believe cameras can steal your spirit. Watching filmed performances of live theatre, you sort of see their point. There's something about the act of recording theatre that makes even the liveliest production look flat, static and soulless. Many broadcasts of live theatre performances simply feel like watching the play on a monitor from the lobby after arriving late.\n\nDoes it have to be that bad? A North American classical repertory theatre is betting that it can find success by following in the footsteps of New York's Metropolitan Opera, which has transmitted live opera performances to cinemas in high definition to increasing demand over the past three years.\n\nThe Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada, is the first theatre to try out the model of The Met: Live in HD with director Des McAnuff's acclaimed production of Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, which stars stage veteran Christopher Plummer as Caesar. Unlike the Met, however, Stratford won't be transmitting live; they've recorded two performances and will show an edited version in cinemas across Canada in January 2009 and on television networks at a later date.\n\nWhile live performances of plays were once fairly common on the small screen, these days theatre on television usually means Andrew Lloyd Webber is casting a musical through a reality show. The Stratford Shakespeare Festival has recreated a couple of productions in studio for broadcast in the past decade, but they haven't recorded a play in front of a live audience for a Canadian network since director Richard Monette's 1993 production of Romeo and Juliet.\n\nWatching that recording now on DVD, it's easy to see why the practice fell out of popularity. The actors' thick stage makeup looks unnatural in closeup and the vocal projection needed to reach the back rows in the festival's 2,000-seat theatre comes across as stagey. Critics at the time praised actor Colm Feore for his \"vulpine charm\" and \"hearty physicality\" as Mercutio, but on the small screen his big performance just seems hammy. The problems are compounded by the Stratford Festival's signature thrust stage, designed by Tanya Moiseiwitsch for founding artistic director Tyrone Guthrie. It's impossible to capture the full scope of a crowd scene without getting a row of audience heads in the way.\n\nCaesar and Cleopatra, which closed this weekend, was performed on the same thrust stage, but changes in technology have apparently made it easier to get on film. With today's small, HD digital cameras, it is now possible to shoot more high-quality footage from more sides, without cameramen appearing in the shot. In the case of Caesar, the performances were captured from eight different angles and there was a day of additional \"pick-ups\" without an audience, so Plummer could deliver his closeups in a more filmic style.\n\nWhile I'm sceptical that anything can equal the ephemeral pleasures of being part of a live audience, there's no point being too snobby about it. There are some very compelling reasons for recording productions. In Stratford's case, there's the archival aspect, the desire to preserve a performance from a 78-year-old treasure like Plummer for future generations. There is also the festival's desire for Canadians across the country to embrace the festival as a national institution. (In a giant country such as Canada, it's difficult to have any sense of a national theatre; a Vancouverite would have to travel more than 3,000km to see Caesar and Cleopatra.)\n\nMost of all, however, putting plays on television - and presumably in cinemas, too - can reach people who have never stepped inside a theatre. That's how Richard Eyre, former artistic director of the National, was first exposed to the art form. Until the age of 16, his only experience of live theatre was through transmissions of Brian Rix's farces on television."
