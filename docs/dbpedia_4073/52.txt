James Hogue Tyler (August 11, 1846 - January 3, 1925) was a United States political figure. He was the 16th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia from 1890 to 1894, and the 43rd Governor of Virginia from 1898 to 1902. He compiled The Family of Hoge, published posthumously in 1927.[1]

Governor Tyler[2] was from an old illustrious family,[3] including pioneers and the wealthy.

Biography[]

He was born at Blenheim in Caroline County, Virginia on August 11, 1846. Two hours after his birth his mother died. His grandparents took him 300 miles by carriage to his mother's home, Hayfield, subsequently known as Belle-Hampton, in Pulaski County, Virginia. There he was raised by his maternal grandparents, General James Hoge[4] and Eleanor Haven Howe.[5] (General Hoge was the nephew of his wife's father and Eleanor Howe was the niece of her husband's mother, thus they were cousins, both grandchildren of Major Joseph Howe,[6] who was the brother (most likely) or cousin of: George Augustus Howe, 3rd Viscount Howe; Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe, 4th Viscount Howe; and Sir William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe.)

About 1862, at the age of 16, he enlisted in the Army of the Confederate States of America and served as a private until the end of the American Civil War rather than accept a commission as an officer and be separated from his friend.

On November 16, 1868, he married Sue Hammet of Montgomery County, Virginia, and the children by that marriage were Edward Hammet, James Hoge, Stockton Heth, Belle Norwood, Sue Hampton, Henry Clement, Eliza (Lily), and Eleanor.

Tyler was a devout Presbyterian. Three times he was elected to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. In 1892 he was a delegate to the Pan Presbyterian Alliance in Toronto, and in 1896 a delegate to the convention in Glasgo, Scotland, where he presided over one of the sessions.

He was a member of the boards of trustees of Hampden-Sydney College, the Union Theological Seminary & Presbyterian School of Christian Education|Union Theological Seminary and the Synodical Orphans Home at Lynchburg.

He died January 3, 1925 at Belle-Hampton. Belle-Hampton was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.[7]

The Family of Hoge[]

He spent the last years of his life compiling The Family of Hoge, a genealogy of the descendents of William Hoge[8] and Barbara Hume,[9] his great-great-great-grandparents and the American progenitors of the Hoge Family.

"About the close of the seventeenth century – 1682 – a young man named William Hoge, son of Sir James Hoge, who was a son of George Hoge, a son of Sir John Hoge, of Musselboro, Scotland, evidently in good circumstances, came to America on account of the religious persecutions under the Stuarts....

...He came to America in 1682 in the ship Caledonia to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, as a young man, and there came on the same ship a Sir James Hume from the same place in Scotland, who was the son of gentry and was well off. He was related to the Humes of Nine Wells and Lord Hume of Home, Earl of Home, and was related to David Hume, the great Historian and author. With Hume on the ship was his wife and daughter, Barbara. The man and his wife died on the voyage and Barbara was left an orphan and went with an uncle, Dr. Johnson of Perth Amboy. William Hoge afterward married Barbara in 1695.
