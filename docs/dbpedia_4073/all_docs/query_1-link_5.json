        "text": "SUMMARY\n\nThe modern office of lieutenant governor was created by the Virginia Constitution of 1851 and is not the same office of that name that existed from time to time during the colonial and early national periods when lieutenant governors occasionally functioned as acting chief executives of Virginia in the absence of the governor. The Constitution of 1851 provided for the popular election of a lieutenant governor at the same time and for the same four-year term as the governor. (From 1776 through 1851 the presiding officer of the Senate of Virginia was the Speaker, chosen from among the number of senators. Beginning in 1852, the lieutenant governor presided with the title of president of the Senate.) During the period of Reconstruction, 1865–1870, the commanding general of the military district of Virginia named the lieutenant governor. After Virginia’s reentry into the federal Union (January 1, 1870), the lieutenant governor was again popularly elected. Lieutenant governors are eligible for reelection. In case of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, an event that has not happened. Between 1934 and 1958 the terms of the commonwealth’s executive officers expired the day prior to the inauguration of their successors; thus for a twenty-four-year period the dates of term expiration and initiation do not agree. Until the General Assembly in 1956 remedied the discrepancy, with the voters’ later approval of a constitutional amendment to take effect in 1958, Virginia was without an executive administration for approximately half a day each inaugural year. Each entry includes life dates, place of residence when first elected, period of service, and political party affiliation when known.\n\nLieutenant Governors under the Commonwealth, 1852–1861\n\nShelton Farrar Leake (1812–1884), from Albemarle County, January 1, 1852–January 1, 1856, Democrat.\n\nElisha Wesley McComas (d. 1890), from Cabell County (now West Virginia), January 1, 1856–December 7, 1857, Democrat.

The state officials in office at the time of Virginia’s secession in 1861 continued to act in Richmond under the Constitution of 1851 and as one of the Confederate States of America. That government ceased to function in May 1865. The lieutenant governors were Robert Latané Montague and Samuel Price. The other, as one of the United States of America and known initially as the Restored government of Virginia, met first at Wheeling (until West Virginia became a state in 1863) and then at Alexandria, where a new constitution was written in 1864. The officials of that government moved to Richmond in June 1865 as the sole government of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
