By Joe William Trotter, Jr. (Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1990. Pp. xvi, 290. $13.95.)\n\nIn this study of black industrial working-class formation, or \"proletarianization,\" historian Joe William Trotter of Carnegie Mellon University analyzes the development of the black coal mining work force in southern West Virginia. Professor Trotter defines proletarianization as \"the process by which southern rural and semirural blacks became new industrial workers and crystallized into a new class.\"(xvii) The time period of this study, 1915-32, represents the nadir of black influence in the coalfield counties of Boone, Fayette, Kanawha, Logan, McDowell, Mercer, Mingo, Raleigh, and Wyoming when the African-American population in these counties rose to 79,007.\n\nBlack miners were recruited from the South to a labor-scarce, rural, mountainous region where they joined native whites and European immigrants in an emergent multi-ethnic, multi-racial society. A \"new class\" of blacks emerged from the intersection of their experiences as southern \"peasants\" and as \"proletarians\" in the coalfields. They might have been a \"new class,\" but Trotter finds the same persistent white racism at work in the coalfields to relegate blacks to the lowest, dirtiest, and most dangerous jobs in the mines. Black miners found their social and institutional lives even more circumscribed above ground in the coal communities by whites who were determined to restrict them to an inferior status. Trotter sees racism reaching a crescendo during World War I and the early 1920s. Two lynchings occurred during this period, and a previously fluid social system was transformed by the rising tide of racism into formal inequality for blacks in education, the law, health care, and social welfare services.\n\nProfessor Trotter is at his best when describing the broad range of African- American responses to this intensification of racism. Black miners became proficient at their jobs, moved frequently in search of higher wages and better conditions, and most importantly for Trotter, they formed bonds of racial solidarity with the black middle- and upper-classes who provided goods, services, and leadership for the black community. This interclass solidarity within the race provided the base from which blacks created their own churches, fraternal orders, political and civil rights organizations, and indeed community itself.\n\nOf course, this process was not unique to the coalfields, but as Trotter demonstrates so well, local particulars were distinctive to southern West Virginia. Unlike the dynamic economy of the industrial cities, for example, mining towns were extremely dependent on a single industry which dominated not just employment, but nearly every other aspect of life. Also, workers were highly dispersed in this rural landscape, and they were not rigidly supervised on the job during this era when miners were still paid by the ton. As a result, they were far more difficult for the union to organize, and much easier for the companies to control than was the case with urban industrial workers. Moreover, blacks faced fewer legal restrictions in West Virginia than in the South, and they were never legally disfranchised. In fact, in a few counties, particularly McDowell, blacks exerted substantial political influence. This was probably true in the state legislature too where blacks had served since the 1890s and won some significant political victories: a state anti-lynching law; a state law banning the showing of The Birth of a Nation; state-supported social welfare institutions run by and for blacks, such as industrial schools, an asylum, and poor house; and appropriations for the expansion of black schools and colleges. Blacks also joined newly created chapters of the NAACP, and a few belonged to Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association. Trotter makes a major contribution in his perceptive analysis of these developments.\n\nCoal, Class, and Color \"should help us transcend the debilitating debates over . . . the primacy of class versus race in shaping the black miners' experience,\" Trotter writes, by showing that experience within the \"multiple frameworks of class, race, and region, and by treating black miners as central actors in the larger drama.\"(267) But the evidence and interpretation presented here leads us to the conclusion that race is, in fact, transcendent in explaining the black experience in southern West Virginia, however complex the matrix of social relations.\n\nThe problem with interpreting the black miners' experience in West Virginia is its ambiguity; the bottle is partly full in the southern context, but in light of American ideals the vessel seems all too empty. Even as \"lynching sentiments\" were \"seething\" just beneath the surface, lawmakers, and even county sheriffs were actually taking measures to prevent such racial violence -- a significant point considering the role of many local officials in racial violence elsewhere in the nation. Moreover, even though blacks never constituted a major proportion of the population in West Virginia, the fact that they were able to win significant political victories begs the question of how so few could gain these concessions unless a majority of the politicians in the overwhelmingly white legislature agreed with them.\n\nAnother unresolved question is how \"proletarianization\" differs in practice from the standard approach, which emphasizes the development of black communities as parallel social structures within a segregated system, and how it improves on the oppression model. This problem is compounded by the near absence from the class-race analysis of the United Mine Workers of America, the major labor organization among this segment of the working class. The UMWA was involved in monumental organizational struggles throughout the period, and Professor Trotter recognizes that blacks played an important role in this movement, but he considers this a \"transitory alliance\" with white workers. Space permitting, this might be effectively disputed.\n\nDespite these observations, Coal, Class, and Color is an excellent study of the black coal mining community in southern West Virginia at the peak of its influence. This richly textured study shows just how complex race relations were even in this relatively remote, rural-industrial setting, and will serve as the standard work on the topic for a long time to come.\n\nRonald L.

Davis is often remembered as the 1924 Democratic nominee for president who emerged from a party fragmented and battered by a tortuous nominating convention in New York City. But that distinction, however notable, was a political diversion from Davis's true craft as the foremost corporate lawyer of his day. William H. Harbaugh's classic account of Davis's life, legal philosophy, and social thought, originally published in 1973, follows Davis's distinguished career as Solicitor General of the United States in the first Wilson administration, Ambassador to the Court of St. James following World War I, and doyen of the elite Wall Street firm of Davis, Polk, and Wardell. When he died at the age of eighty-one in 1955, Davis had argued 141 cases before the United States Supreme Court, including the losing presentation in the 1954 segregation case, his final appearance before the court.\n\nDavis was born in Clarksburg in 1873, the son of Anna and John J. Davis, one of West Virginia's leading Constitutional Unionists. The elder Davis was pro- slavery and anti-secessionist, and his pragmatic support for West Virginia statehood was tempered by an abiding hatred for the centralizing tendencies of national government. John W. Davis absorbed his father's states' rights views, if not the volatile personality, adopting at the core of his being the doctrine that personal liberty and property rights were inseparable natural rights of man. These tenets were formalized during his law school training at Washington and Lee, where Davis internalized the rigidly conservative premise that the United States Constitution and statutes were fixed in meaning, not subject to liberal judicial interpretation.(20)\n\nDr. Harbaugh's choice of Davis as the subject of a scholarly biography challenged him to write a balanced narrative about someone with whom he was philosophically at odds. Harbaugh accepted and met this challenge, producing an exhaustively documented and readable volume. Lawyer's Lawyer portrays a man whose character, integrity, and talent made him universally respected, even among his bitterest adversaries. Yet Harbaugh counterbalances Davis's gentle personal decency with the lawyer's stubborn resistance to admit possible structural injustices in American corporate capitalism, whose concentration of wealth and power assaulted the democratic Jeffersonian principles Davis held dear.\n\nDavis, described as at heart \"always a Spencerian or Social Darwinist,\"(118) uncritically accepted and defended the existing social order, at the top of which he rested. Harbaugh approves Davis's opposition to certain New Deal programs that were \"hastily and loosely framed,\" (Davis was a charter member of the reactionary Liberty League), but points out that never did Davis \"speak understandingly of the poverty, malnutrition, and despair that pervaded the nation.\" Nor did Davis ever acknowledge that the political centralization he detested was \"simply the logical response to the financial and industrial centralization he so consistently ignored.\"(342)\n\nDavis, eighty years old in 1953, did not hesitate when South Carolina Governor James F. Byrnes asked him to defend the state in Briggs v. Elliott, the South Carolina segregation case which was combined with Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Pitted against Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP, a personal admirer of Davis, Davis argued for literal interpretation of the \"separate but equal\" ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. Harbaugh concludes that Davis probably sincerely believed that federally-mandated integration of schools would irretrievably fracture race relations, but that he also \"privately defended poll taxes, never criticized the exclusion of blacks from Democratic primaries, and never commented, privately or publicly, on the nation's dual system of justice.\"(493) Davis therefore embraced the Plessy dictum that \"if one race be inferior socially to the other, the Constitution of the United States cannot put them on the same plane,\"(492) and also accepted the engineering of black social and political powerlessness by state and local practices. Davis went so far as to declare that since \"the highest authorities\" had consistently defended a state's right to maintain segregated schools, the issue should not even be open to debate in the courts.(499)\n\nIn a perceptive foreword to the 1990 reissue, Calvin Woodward suggests that Davis's anti-New Deal, pro-segregationist views have once again become not only relevant but \"appallingly popular\" in the Reagan-Bush years.(xi) Indeed, the judicial temperament of the federal courts has shifted back toward the Davis interpretation of limited power, where \"it was not for the government to compensate for the accident of birth, no matter how impoverished the cultural or economic inheritance.\"(118) The recent pronouncements of new Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas that he embraces natural law signal a resurgence of Davis's view that the state and the high court exist only to prevent monopoly, preserve order and national security, and protect liberty and property. The current leaning of the courts renders premature, then, the 1954 observation by Paul Wilson, Assistant Attorney General of Kansas, who reluctantly defended his state's segregated school system in the Brown case. John W. Davis's arguments in the segregation cases, said Wilson, displayed \"a great lawyer at the end of his life speaking, however eloquently, in support of a policy that was no longer tolerable in a free country.\"(506)\n\nJohn Hennen\n\nWest Virginia University\n\nMARY LEE SETTLE'S BEULAH QUINTET: THE PRICE OF FREEDOM. By Brian Rosenberg (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Univ. Press, 1991. Pp. xv, 141. $25.00.)\n\nApart from George Garret's Understanding Mary Lee Settle, Rosenberg's new work is the only book-length treatment of the prolific author who is published internationally, generally esteemed in critical circles, and a winner of the National Book Award. While Settle's books are often well- reviewed, her audience is not as large as she deserves, and there are occasional notes of irony in the critical reception of her books. In Rosenberg's study, Settle has found an able advocate as well as an interpreter.\n\nThe books that comprise the Beulah Quintet are analyzed in the order of their historical chronology, although they were not written in that order. Rosenberg reads each one deeply and with appreciation. The first of the series, the remarkable novel Prisons, is \"at once the marginal and the central novel.\" Whereas Settle's works often fragment time and setting in a manner reminiscent of Alain Robbe-Grillet, Prisons proceeds in a more discursive, linear way to its dramatic and moving conclusion. It is told in the first-person perspective of Johnny Church, a young Leveller during the English Civil War. Drawing upon extensive historical research, a trademark of Settle's fiction, both the style and content are consistent with a member of that radical faction and indicative of a certain class and upbringing. In Rosenberg's estimate, Settle's fictional characterization of Johnny Church, and his conscience and resolve, establish the historical context and recurring subtext of the next four books. In addition, Rosenberg finds in this first of the series an observation about the sources of American culture and politics as well. It is to the Levellers that we owe much of our notion of freedom, and it is their conflict and proclamations to which we must return in order to make sense of our own struggles.\n\nRosenberg's reading of Prisons suggests that rarely are the personal and the political so skillfully related in works of fiction, and this implicitly undermines the \"great man\" theory of history propounded by Thomas Carlyle. He concentrates on the fundamental irony of Church's fate and the historical failure of the Levellers's movement to substantiate Settle's insistence that they were a source of the modern democratic experiment. He finds everything about the style of the novel -- first-person narration, use of period speech, the suggestive imagery -- supports Settle's contention that failure can be dialectically reversed in history, the process that Jean-Paul Sartre called the game of \"loser wins.\"\n\nThe novels that follow Prisons in the Beulah Quintet are all set in the New World, principally in West Virginia, and are peopled with the descendants of Johnny Church who must in one way or another relive his struggle for freedom. O Beulah Land, actually written first, has for its protagonist Hannah, a pioneer in pre-Revolutionary America. As Hannah and her relations make a new life for themselves in the mountains of western Virginia, they develop an ironic relation to the land they tame and possess. Rosenberg emphasizes the dilemma at the center of that relation: are those who were dispossessed healed or corrupted by dispossessing others?\n\nRosenberg's themes are suggestive of Rodger Cunningham's recent study Apples on the Flood: Minority Discourse And Appalachia, a nonfiction treatment of precisely the same issues Settle has addressed through historical fiction.\n\nThe third novel, Know Nothing, is seen as stylistically similar to its preceding volume by Rosenberg, although he also characterizes it as her most accessible to a popular audience. He finds in it, nevertheless, the same political undercurrents that are elsewhere in the Beulah Quintet: \"Because the antebellum South is among the most dangerously mythologized of all historical eras, Know Nothing is the most emphatically antimythological novel in the quintet.\" The protagonist in the third novel acquiesces where his ancestors struggled, with or without success. Drowning in passivity and the decay of earlier promise, he is fodder for the Civil War. The fourth novel, The Scapegoat, won wide critical acclaim, and Rosenberg is honest enough to attribute some of the attention to the fact that it followed Settle's National Book Award for Blood Tie. Yet he also contends that The Scapegoat, set in the period of West Virginia's mine wars and featuring Mother Jones as a principal player, is more pleasing to literary critics than most historical fiction. Highbrows who did not know what to make of the preceding volumes could embrace the latest offering as a proletarian novel. Although the descendants of previous characters appear here, there is no single dominant protagonist, and Rosenberg finds its style and structure close to that of Blood Tie. He notes that the same event is told from multiple perspectives, and characterizes The Scapegoat as being \"more radically fragmented\" and carrying \"different epistemological implications.\"\n\nRosenberg makes much significance of the portrayal of Mother Jones, the first genuine historical figure given prominence since Cromwell in the first of the Beulah books. Extended flashbacks, previously used in Prisons, are matched by flash-forwards (a term Rosenberg credits to George Garrett) revealing consequences of decisions and actions and the future shift of fortunes. But the shifting of social classes and fortunes was already a theme contemporary with the mine wars, since farming had been replaced by industry.\n\nAfter a false start with Fight Night on a Sweet Saturday, Settle concluded the quintet with The Killing Ground, featuring a later Hannah, one who is contemporary with the reader. The fight here is still for freedom and whether one has the resolve to carry it through. The prison is \"Canona\" society with its hillside homes and country clubs, a theme reworked in Charley Bland. Rosenberg raises this point by noting the reappearance in The Killing Ground of characters previously found in non-Beulah novels. He contends that some readers have been confused by trying to see the novelist-narrator of this last book as Mary Lee Settle herself, rather than as a fictional construct who speaks in first person. In all fairness to Settle, this is apparently a widespread misunderstanding among modern readers, as the furor against Bret Easton Ellis for American Psycho demonstrates.\n\nThroughout Rosenberg's critical rereading of the Beulah Quintet is a consideration of what a recent biographer of George Orwell has termed \"the politics of literary reputation.\" Historical fiction has been increasingly seen in this century as a degraded genre, particularly in the United States. Critics who praise Settle's works of contemporary settings are not prepared, Rosenberg contends, to deal with her historical fiction. But if the proliferation of formula romance novels has made historical fiction suspect, he finds that there is an argument to be made that the Beulah Quintet revives a grand literary tradition, and even pushes it beyond its previous limitations. Rosenberg compares her accomplishment to Latin American writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and East Europeans like Milan Kundera. Regardless of the critics' verdict on historical fiction, he concludes: \". . . the novels that comprise the Beulah Quintet are simply too valuable to be overlooked.\"\n\nRosenberg's detailed and insightful study of this ambitious literary project is supplemented with an appendix containing an interview with Settle from 1987. It is useful in that it confirms and sometimes clarifies the interpretations the critic has advanced in the preceding pages. Yet, even more strikingly, it confirms the sympathy with Settle's sensibility that runs throughout Rosenberg's commentary. It tempts the reader to admire what she has to say as much as how well she says it.\n\nGordon Simmons\n\nTrans Allegheny Books\n\nCOAL TOWNS: LIFE, WORK, AND CULTURE IN COMPANY TOWNS OF SOUTHERN APPALACHIA, 1880-1960. By Crandall A. Shifflett (Knoxville: Univ. of Tennessee Press, 1991. Pp. xx, 259. $34.95.)\n\n\"Which side are you on?\" This seemingly innocent question has paralyzed the historiography of Appalachian bituminous coal mining for decades. The first students of coalfield history were company apologists, glorifying the enterprising operators who had carved the mighty industry from the rugged mountains. The next generation were scholars investigating coal culture, radical labor historians searching for a genuine tradition of industrial worker class-consciousness amidst the chronic turbulence of the coal industry.\n\nCoal Towns seeks to move the debate concerning the nature of the coalfields beyond partisan considerations into the realm of social history. In particular, Crandall Shifflett attempts to apply Herbert Gutman's concept of \"work culture\" and Eugene Genovese's sophisticated theoretical construct of \"paternalism\" to the history of coal communities in industrializing Appalachia. Shifflett is a professor of American history at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, whose first book analyzed \"tobacco patronage\" agricultural society in nineteenth-century Virginia.\n\nShifflett's avowed goal is \"to explore the nature of the coal-town order in all of its complexity and variety, beginning with the background culture of the white majority and moving into the social community of individual towns.\"(xviii) Rather than addressing the \"physical setting and power relationships,\"(1) Coal Towns investigates \"the interaction of structural components and cultural values,\"(175) and asserts that \"a laboring people's culture arose out of this blend of the inherited tradition and the environmental conditions of industrial labor.\"(212) \"Mine culture,\" states Shifflett, \"like agriculture, was a shared working-class culture.\"(111)\n\nIn order to reinterpret coal culture -- \"to relate work and culture\"(110) -- Shifflett chiefly utilizes three bodies of primary source materials: periodic federal government documents such as the 1922 United States Coal Commission report; scores of oral histories contained in a wide variety of repositories; and the voluminous corporate records of two \"case study\" coal companies -- Stonega in southwest Virginia, and Borderland in Mingo County, West Virginia. The first is taken to be representative of large, well-financed \"model\" company towns, the latter is an example of towns established by smaller, independently-operated companies.\n\nShifflett's vision of coal culture, heavily dependent upon oral history tapes, is strikingly different from the recent interpretations of Ron Eller, Ron Lewis, and especially David Corbin, who portrayed coal company towns as fundamentally oppressive institutions. Many labor historians \"failed to set the experience of miners within the context of workingmen's realities and the perceptions of the age.\"(116) Coal Towns asserts that \"social and cultural life in the towns . . . became a source of communal identity, mutual assistance, and solidarity.\"(xvi) Life in the five hundred or so Appalachian coalfield communities was richer, more complex, and ultimately more satisfying than recent scholarship has admitted. Shifflett's intriguing reinterpretation of mining life, however, relies less on reconfiguring the very nature of the coal towns themselves than on a major reassessment of the world that white miners and their families left behind to enter coal-town culture.\n\nShifflett sees late nineteenth-century Appalachia less as Eller's preindustrial paradise than as a society in agony, \"not a golden age of untrammeled yeomanry but a period of crisis on the land, agricultural decline, advancing tenantry, and a darkening future for the next generation.\"(10) \"If mountain life had been so idyllic,\" states the author, \"mountain families would not have left.\"(7) Pioneer Appalachians \"probably strung more beans than dulcimers.\"(8) Therefore, \"against a preindustrial backdrop of a limiting present and a dimming future, it need not be shocking to learn, for example, that many former mining-town residents were not alienated by the company-town experience.\"(7) \"The coal mines simply offered a better life.\"(24)\n\nOften allowing coal people to speak for themselves through excerpts from oral history transcripts, Shifflett deftly revises the popular and scholarly conceptions of the characteristic institutions of coalfield culture in light of the world from which the miners came. A profound labor shortage prevented overt oppression by the operators, and the continually evolving, \"dynamic\" nature of the complex communities frustrated company efforts to control workers. Shifflett takes at face value company paternalism, \"contentment sociology,\" and efforts to humanize the painful process of industrialization. In this view, the venerable company store is less an instrument of corporate oppression than a welcome commissary of goods seldom found in rural preindustrial Appalachia. The issuance of scrip is not seen as an inappropriate response to the financial realities of rural mountain existence. Poorly-attended company churches were not attempts to mold a docile labor force, but legitimate expressions of the new working-class values. Health care was efficient and affordable beyond the dreams of the inhabitants of isolated mountaineer homesteads. Leisure activities, such as community baseball clubs, while sponsored by coal company paternalism, were nonetheless valid responses to industrial culture. Shifflett's fascinating and provocative analysis of \"nonunionism\" will ruffle many a feather in labor history circles.\n\nWhile Shifflett's adroit theoretical construct allows him to navigate smoothly the perilous shoals of coalfield history by changing the terms of the debate, several factors will likely prevent Coal Towns from persuading many historians who do not share its author's view of the veracity of oral history as a reliable primary source. Although Shifflett presents a powerful thesis, too often he suggests more than he proves. Shifflett's focus on white mountaineer culture leads him to over-emphasize ethnic conflict and racial segregation. Questions of Stonega's typicality will perhaps trouble some scholars.\n\nMoreover, there are serious gaps in Shifflett's research, both primary and secondary. The landmark unpublished doctoral dissertations of Mack Gillenwater, Jerry Thomas, and Ken Sullivan are conspicuously absent from his notes, as is the pioneering \"model town\" analysis of Robert Munn, which appeared in the pages of this journal in 1979. Valuable primary source materials, such as the federal manuscript census, state mine inspection reports, the survey forms of the 1922 Coal Commission, and the UMWA Journal are also missing. More disturbing is the lack of quantified analysis, especially in light of Stonega's voluminous records: \"For each mine worker, time and attendance records, number of days worked, number of cars loaded, and mine safety records were scrupulously kept.\"(179) Simple statistical manipulations of such data might have allowed for concrete conclusions rather than assumptions based upon miners' selective memories and notoriously obtuse government reports. This is particularly surprising because Shifflett expressly identifies his study with the Annales school of historiography.\n\nThese caveats aside, Shifflett builds a powerful case by moving the debate about the nature of coal culture away from impassioned political rhetoric towards an analytical investigation of the unique and distinctive society produced by the sudden appearance of industry in a rural mountainous setting. All students of coal history therefore owe Crandall Shifflett a considerable debt of gratitude for his provocative synthesis, a work which substantially advances this debate.\n\nStuart McGehee\n\nEastern Regional Coal Archives\n\nCIVIL WAR IN CABELL COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA, 1861-1865. By Joe Geiger, Jr. (Charleston: Pictorial Histories Publishing, 1991. Pp. 148. $9.95.)\n\nThe author of this book has researched many well-known and unknown facts, diaries, manuscripts and photographs pertaining to Cabell County preceding and during the Civil War. Although Cabell borders the Ohio River and Unionist Ohio, it is surprising to learn the great division of its citizens. For example, Abraham Lincoln received only four votes in the entire county in the presidential election of 1860. Cabell County voted against secession but still supplied many men to the Confederate Army, including such units as the Border Rangers.\n\nOne of the book's most important features is the author's combining many detailed biographies with descriptions of military activities. Many of these individuals had a great effect on the course of the war in Cabell County and their legacy can still be seen and felt in the county today. Individuals, sites, and activities, such as General McClellan, Scary Creek, Cooney Rickets, Coalsmouth, General Jacob D. Cox, and Charleston, will bring to mind Civil War actions in surrounding counties and other areas of the United States and will whet the reader's appetite to know more.\n\nThere were many skirmishes, raids, and chases in and around Cabell County during the war and it is sometimes difficult to follow the sequence of events. This is not necessarily the fault of the author but simply the course of the war. The Battle of Barboursville was a short, bloody affair with few casualties, but it had a great effect on the area. The reader will enjoy the interesting account of German troops refusing to fight at Barboursville and the ensuing charges and counter-charges. The Confederate raid on Guyandotte was much more brutal and resulted in the burning of the town by Union forces. This was typical of one army's retaliation against enemy supporters. These actions are as well covered in this book as the historical records will allow. It is interesting to note that following the war, there was very little retaliation against the secessionists in Cabell and within five years they were allowed to vote and organize Confederate veterans groups, such as Camp Garnett which is in existence today.\n\nThe author, like most historians, contends that Albert Gallatin Jenkins was the most influential Cabell County resident to participate in the war. His plantation Greenbottom often aided the Confederates, but at other times the Union Army took food, horses, and cattle from the family. The homestead at Greenbottom is still standing and in good condition. It is unfortunate that the author could not elaborate on General Jenkins's activities because many of them did not occur in Cabell County and would be repeating information in Jack Dickinson's book, Jenkins of Greenbottom. Because of Jenkins's prominence, it would have been appropriate to have a close-up photograph of his grave in the Confederate plot in Huntington's Spring Hill Cemetery, his third and final distinguished resting place.\n\nThis book contains many previously unpublished photographs of battle sites, buildings, graves and individuals. Unfortunately, some are of questionable quality and captions are inadequate. For example, J. J. Mansfield's gravestone epitaph is well described in the text but the picture (40) shows only a silhouette. There is a duplicate picture of General John Hunt Oley's grave (116) but it is not identified.\n\nQuotations and reproductions of newspaper articles will be of special interest to present-day Cabell County residents, especially those whose relatives participated in the war. The chapter notes and bibliography are well done, which should be of great help to anyone wishing to find more details about incidents or individuals covered in the book. Appendices listing participants in the Union and Confederate armies will aid genealogists searching for relatives in Cabell County.\n\nThe author intended this book to focus on Civil War activities in Cabell County and he achieved this goal. The book will be most valuable to those who have connections with participants in the war or who presently live in Cabell County.\n\nNoble K. Wyatt\n\nKanawha Valley Civil War Roundtable\n\nWAR DIARIES: THE 1861 KANAWHA VALLEY CAMPAIGNS. Ed. by David L. Phillips. Rebecca L. Hill, Chief Researcher (Leesburg, VA: Gauley Mountain Press, 1991. Pp. 480. $30.00.)\n\nThe spiraling interest in all aspects of the Civil War has generated a greater search for the details of that conflict's origins, first campaigns and early players. this has led to a number of new historical works on the Kanawha Valley campaign of 1861. A knowledge of this campaign is crucial to an understanding of the war itself: a border area where the first family separations took place; the often painful choosing of sides; initial, often inept efforts at raising troops and the establishing of defenses and strategic objectives. All of these things were quite new and at time frightening to Americans. Some of the Civil War's initial armed clashes took place here and some participants later played major roles in other campaigns.\n\nTerry Lowry's 1982 Battle of Scary Creek: Military Operations in the Kanawha Valley, April-July 1861, introduced the 1861 Kanawha campaign to readers. Later works provided more insight into this subject, but the main characters remained only as names of communities, place names on maps.\n\nWar diaries opens a new world of understanding those key individuals who did so much to shape the events of West Virginia in 1861. Although William Wintz's 1989 Civil War Memoirs of Two Rebel Sisters pointed the way, this is the first full use of diaries and letters of people like Christopher and Ellen Tompkins and Jacob Cox, whom the reader is allowed to see and feel as critically important players in the real-life drama of the Civil War's opening. The hand of the editor is deft. Misspellings and grammatical errors are intentionally left intact. Phillips's insertions of descriptions of simultaneous events, of which the diarists were unaware, give greater meaning and a larger perspective to local occurrences.\n\nThe work is well organized and understandable, even for those readers who may be unfamiliar with the characters and events. There are a few typesetting errors, but no more than what is to be expected in an essentially self- published effort, and illustrations are not as professionally reproduced as might be hoped. The high level of energy reflected in the writing, thanks to skillful editing, is sustained throughout the work.\n\nThis is clearly a work that comes at just the right time for those who are interested in the critical 1861 Kanawha campaign. It is an opportunity to gain more in-depth knowledge of its key players and must reading for those interested in the mainstream of western Virginia history and politics of the early 1860s. This work will become a major resource for students of the Civil War era in West Virginia.\n\nMichael J. Pauley\n\nCulture & History\n\nANTIETAM: ESSAYS ON THE 1862 MARYLAND CAMPAIGN. Ed. by Gary W. Gallagher (Kent, OH: The Kent State Univ. Press, 1989, Pp. 130. $8.95.)\n\nAntietam: Essays on the 1862 Maryland Campaign is a book which serious students of the Civil War and the casual reader alike can enjoy. The slender size of this volume, combined with its rather plain appearance, belie the fine quality of its contents. It is not necessary for the reader to possess working knowledge of the Antietam campaign to understand this work. However, those who have previously read such books as Landscape Turned Red by Stephen W. Sears will more readily relate to and appreciate these essays.\n\nThis information-packed volume consists of a collection of essays composed by four renowned Civil War historians. The essays include \"A Season of Opportunity\" and \"The Campaign in Perspective\" by Gary Gallagher; \"Drama Between the Rivers\" by Dennis Frye; \"The Army of Northern Virginia in September 1862\" by Robert K. Krick; and \"George B. McClellan and the Maryland Campaign\" by A. Wilson Greene.\n\nEach author analyzes a specific phase of the campaign in thought-provoking detail. Dennis Frye's description of the campaign as it involved Harpers Ferry and the Confederate loss of Special Orders #191 is perhaps the most readable of the essays. Frye carefully delineates Union and Confederate maneuvers, both tactical and strategic, in explaining how the Rebels managed to escape disaster and capture Harpers Ferry and its garrison of 12,500 Federals.\n\n\"A Season of Opportunity\" explores the various reasons why Robert E. Lee, with the approval of Jefferson Davis, decided to invade Maryland. The Southerners reasoned that a successful campaign in the North might result in foreign intervention on the side of the Confederacy, as well as having several other positive effects. Conversely, the author convincingly makes the case that the real opportunity lay with the North. Had General McClellan been a more aggressive soldier and campaign strategist, he might have destroyed Lee's army, thereby ending the war.\n\nKrick's analysis of the Army of Northern Virginia in the fall of 1862 is the most penetrating of the essays. It is also the least readable, being overburdened with technical jargon. Casual readers may be perturbed by Mr. Krick's style, but he presents a superb picture of Lee's great army and its part in this pivotal campaign.\n\nA. Wilson Greene very skillfully summarizes McClellan's costly mistakes. The author points out that although the general was inept in directing his massive army, he thought he was doing splendidly and often bragged to his superiors about his many achievements. The author also persuasively argues that Ambrose Burnside, the usual \"scapegoat\" of Antietam, has been erroneously blamed for the Union Army's failure at Antietam Creek on September 17, 1862.\n\nFinally, Gary Gallagher integrates contemporary opinions on the results of Antietam within a truly excellent discussion of how the war changed after the battle. A concise but comprehensive bibliography complements this impeccable collection of essays. It is an excellent book with which to increase your knowledge of America's bloodiest day.\n\nTim McKinney\n\nCharlton Heights\n\nLEE CONSIDERED: GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE AND CIVIL WAR HISTORY. By Alan T. Nolan (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1991. Pp. 240. $19.95.)\n\nStating that Robert E. Lee's actions should be \"explored and not just accepted,\" Alan T. Nolan attempts to identify several \"fictions\" concerning Lee and the Confederacy in his latest work, Lee Considered. Among other things, Nolan argues that Lee could have prevented Virginia's secession; that Lee's men \"did not always behave civilly in the North\"; that Lee \"was aware of and embraced the preservation of slavery as a Confederate war aim\"; and that after the war \"Lee and his fellow Southerners were groping for a new method of white supremacy and exploitation of the blacks.\"\n\nCiting a wide variety of sources, including Lee's own writing on these and other topics, Nolan confidently and skillfully sets forth his thesis. His revisionist method of using these sources does, however, come into question. When citing a source that can be interpreted in several ways, Nolan always concludes that his interpretation is correct, and argues the point with varying degrees of success. While this method offers some interesting, even thought-provoking text, it is not necessarily the thread that binds good historical research. Indeed, many of the details with which Nolan deals are of relatively little importance.\n\nIn Chapter Four, entitled \"General Lee,\" Nolan argues that the \"South's true grand strategy\" was defensive, and that Lee possessed a \"fundamental misconception of the proper Southern grand strategy,\" his \"counterproductive strategy of the offensive.\" Instead of pursuing an offensive victory, Lee should have remained on the defensive and worn down Northern will. Nolan argues this point skillfully, presenting his readers with a highly credible discussion of the price the South paid for having Robert E. Lee. He further concludes, as have many other Lee historians, that Antietam was Lee's greatest mistake. This is perhaps the best chapter in Lee Considered, with one important caveat: Nolan fails to consider the overall context of General Lee's actions. The virtually unbroken string of Federal successes in the west frequently obligated Lee to assume the offensive.\n\nNolan's thesis also suffers from his attempts to reduce the causes and meaning of the war merely to slavery. Economic issues and sectional rivalry that predated the war by decades are entirely dismissed. The evidence given for the characterization of Lee as an advocate of slavery is also suspect.\n\nLee Considered is interesting and well written. It is a work calculated to provoke its readers, and it does that best of all. Seeing whether or not Nolan's conclusions survive in the \"court\" of public opinion will be almost as interesting as reading the book itself.\n\nTim McKinney\n\nCharlton Heights\n\nBATTLE TACTICS OF THE CIVIL WAR. By Paddy Griffith (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1989. Pp. 239. $25.00.)\n\nWorld War I began with the armies of most of the great powers on the offensive. Almost everyone expected a war of movement, a war that would quickly reach a decisive conclusion. The most innovative of the war plans, the German Schlieffen Plan, failed as did most of the later ambitious attacks with distant objectives. Stalemated trench warfare became the order of the day on the western front, with the offense, especially when elastic defensive tactics were employed, usually suffering greater casualties. In the minds of many military theorists and popularizers of the Great War, the cult of the offensive was obsolete strategy. New military technology, especially improved artillery and rapid-fire weapons, shifted the balance in favor of the defense. The bloody American Civil War, the first modern war should have served as a portent for the future, since it was fought with improved weapons, trench systems and railroads. Yet the European generals failed to grasp the obvious, especially the advantage that improved weapons gave the defense over the offense, with the infantry paying the price on the corpse-strewn battlefields of Europe.\n\nPaddy Griffith, a native of Liverpool and now senior lecturer in war studies at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, England, has written a fascinating book that brings the above analysis into serious question. To Griffith there are precious few \"lessons\" to be learned from this American conflict that have relevance for World War I. He views the Civil War as the last of the Napoleonic wars rather than the first modern war. Griffith has an important advantage over many Americans who write about the Civil War. First, he has a profound understanding of tactics. Second, and most importantly, he is able to write from a broad perspective. An expert on Napoleonic warfare, he has also mastered the literature on the Civil War. Frequently, American historians can be justly accused of too narrow a focus in their treatment of American subjects. They often do not have the depth of knowledge to place an American historical event in a comparative context.\n\nCentral to the author's thesis is his rejection of the widely held view that a \"genuine revolution in firepower\" occurred on the battlefields of the Civil War. In opposition to Shelby Foote of public television fame and most other Civil War historians, Griffith finds the slaughter not at all different in extent from the Napoleonic battles. There was no record bloodbath; Napoleonic conflicts were actually more lethal. Napoleon's infantry carried smoothbore muzzle-loading flintlock muskets with a battle effectiveness of fifty to sixty yards. The new Civil War rifles, especially the rifled-breech loader and muzzle-loading guns, had a much superior potential range, but potential and actual battle performance were not the same. If the small number of snipers are excluded, Griffith asserts, the effective ranges of Civil War and Napoleonic musketry were not that different. The obvious question then arises: If there was no revolution in firepower, why the emphasis on trenches and the indecisive nature of the fighting? Griffith concludes, \"as in so many other eras of military history, in fact, it transpires that human factors such as training and doctrine -- or the lack of them -- exerted a much greater underlying influence upon the outcome than did the precise specifications of the weaponry in use.\"(27) He argues that the West Point-dominated officer corps of both sides, trained to be engineers, emphasized the spade over the bayonet. Typically, an attacking force would advance to within close range of the enemy, engaging in a prolonged fire fight at a distance not unlike Napoleonic times. The difference was that the last thirty-three yards were not crossed with a rapid rush and mass shock tactics. The glint of steel would have unnerved the defender and broken his will. If a large reserve of heavy cavalry, similar to that of Napoleon, had been present to support these shock tactics, many battles would have been turned into routs by offensive-minded generals. The crux of Griffith's thesis is that the nature of warfare in 1861- 65 had not fundamentally changed since Waterloo. If Napoleon and his generals had conducted the conflict, \"the Civil War could have shown us decisive results as dazzling as anything seen in the days of Napoleon.\"(192)\n\nA non-controversial point made by the author is that artillery in the 1860s was not capable of assisting the offensive as it did during 1914-18. Artillery, not the tank or machine gun, proved to be the decisive weapon of World War I. Conversely, direct fire at long-range was inaccurate. Griffith's view that Civil War artillery was not as vulnerable to rifle fire as previously thought, however, is bound to raise an eyebrow or two.\n\nThe greatest value of this provocative study is to force Civil War enthusiasts to rethink prevailing views on the nature of the conflict. There will certainly be considerable disagreement with Griffith. Some of his generalizations don't ring true. For example, is it really correct to argue that the psychological impact of First Manassas decisively affected the conduct of the war thereafter, with the Federals having an inferiority complex? Also, his use of statistics on frontal assaults to buttress his thesis do not always inspire confidence. One is reminded of the remark, \"there are lies, damned lies, and statistics.\"\n\nBased largely on secondary sources, and written in a pleasing, informal style, Griffith's work is certain to engage the interest of both the specialist and general reader. This is definitely a work that should be added to any Civil War library.\n\nDavid Woodward\n\nMarshall University\n\nAN AMERICAN ILIAD: THE STORY OF THE CIVIL WAR. By Charles Pierce Roland (Lexington: Univ. Press of Kentucky, 1991. Pp. 288. $30.00.)\n\nFirst impressions can be very deceiving. An American Iliad appears to attempt an overview of the most important event in the history of our nation in a scant 263 pages, the equivalent of \"Cliff's Notes on the Civil War.\" The author, however, quickly dispels this assumption. Roland's method of telling the story of the Civil War is a valuable one. In a society that processes information by the \"sound-bite,\" few people will begin extensive multi-volume accounts of this war. Unfortunately, this leaves many without any knowledge of how these few years shaped a nation. An American Iliad should help fill this void.\n\nRoland describes the campaigns and tactics that would make legends of Lee, Grant and Jackson, but his account extends also to the politicians. The strong hand played by both Northern and Southern politicians determined the outcome of the conflict just as surely as the generals. The author's profiles of these leaders, both military and political, show their strengths and weaknesses. He provides an honest account that will surely lead the reader to look further into these lives. The character of Lincoln, of course, is the thread which carries throughout the book. Lincoln's greatness is seen in his dedication to preserve the Union at all costs. The author emphasizes that the Gettysburg Address was more than political rhetoric. It was the message that drove the man.\n\nPerhaps the greatest contribution of Roland's book is his skill as a writer which encourages the reader to seek more information. He does not overlook any facet of the war. Considering the length of the book, the author's thorough treatment is surprising. He presents a complete portrait of the Civil War era, but the images will lead the reader to focus on one aspect or another.\n\nThe author graphically illustrates the price paid by the South. With only two major battles occurring on northern sod, it is the South we see in flames. The vision is more than just an army destroyed, it is the end of a culture. As the conflict wears on, the inhumanity of man becomes more evident. There are heroes and glory in war, but there is also revenge. This tragedy is magnified when the conflict is brother against brother.\n\nIt is frustrating to have a library patron ask for \"a\" book on a particular subject. An American Iliad can be strongly recommended to fill this need on the Civil War. However, it would be surprising if the reader stopped with this work.\n\nJ. D. Waggoner\n\nWest Virginia Library Commission\n\nTHE EDUCATION OF BLACKS IN THE SOUTH, 1860-1935. By James D. Anderson (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1988. Pp. xvi, 366. $10.95.)\n\nFocusing on the period 1860-1935, this book examines the development of black education in the American South. It explores the \"structure, ideology, and content of black education as part and parcel of the larger political subordination of blacks.\" As Anderson argues, \"it was the social system in which blacks lived that made their educational institutions so fundamentally different from those of other Americans.\" More importantly, however, this study emphasizes the \"unique system of public and private education\" that black southerners developed for themselves.\n\nAnderson carefully situates his study within the broader context of American education. From the early nineteenth century through the early twentieth century, he shows how the history of American education was marked by two contradictory themes: training for citizenship in a democratic society versus schooling for second-class citizenship along class and particularly racial lines. These contradictory traditions, Anderson concludes, reflected the protracted struggle between \"two social systems -- slavery and peasantry on one hand, and capitalism and free labor on the other.\"\n\nIn a series of seven tightly interconnected chapters, Anderson rewrites much of the conventional historiography of black education, emphasizing the dynamic self-activity of blacks themselves. First, building upon the theoretical insights of the late labor historian Herbert Gutman, he documents the role of former slaves in shaping their own education, showing how they built upon fundamental beliefs in the value of literate culture which they developed under slavery. The first generation of free African Americans developed a grassroots literacy movement that stretched back to the antebellum period, before northern benevolent societies, the federal government, and white politicians got involved in the process of educating the freedmen and women. In short, Anderson concludes, \"such a view of postbellum southern education acknowledges the important contributions of northerners but recognizes the ex- slaves as the principal challenge to the region's long-standing resistance to free schooling.\"(6)\n\nSecond, Anderson focuses on the actual content of black education and moves beyond merely assessing the intellectual and ideological debates that marked efforts to educate former slaves. Thus, he helps to sharpen our understanding of the goals and relationships between black institutions like Hampton Institute, Tuskegee Institute, and others. Although Hampton and Tuskegee became known as trades or technical schools, for example, their main mission was the training of public school teachers: using manual labor as a requirement of teacher training rather than as a systematic effort to produce an artisan class. Despite substantial support from northern philanthropists, especially after the initiation of the Conferences of Education in the South (which began at Capon Springs, West Virginia, and continued to meet in various places through 1914), most black students attended private normal schools, secondary schools, and colleges, which pursued classical liberal education with little effort focused on trades and manual training. Moreover, these were the institutions that provided most teachers for black public school education in the South.\n\nThird, this study shows how whites responded to black education in a variety of ways, depending upon particular configurations of class backgrounds, political, and social interests. While rural white planters staunchly resisted universal public school education for blacks, white urban industrialists supported a system of universal public schooling with clearly prescribed racial and class limitations. Conversely, while northern white missionaries advocated the lifting of racial ceilings on black education, northern white industrialists hoped to limit black educational aspirations in accord with prevailing southern racist norms. Thus, by depicting a variety of white responses to black education, Anderson shows how some northerners advocated greater ceilings on black education than some southern whites.\n\nA splendid work of historical scholarship, this study documents significant changes in black education over time. Black education moved forward in the wake of the Civil War, when blacks used their expanding educational institutions to develop leadership training for citizenship in a modern democracy. Although they adopted a classical liberal curriculum (which varied little from that of New England white schools), Anderson convincingly argues that this curriculum was not an imitation of white schooling. Indeed, it was used to counteract prevailing racial stereotypes of black people.\n\nDespite remarkable strides during the Reconstruction period, black education changed significantly thereafter. As former slaves continued to struggle to implement their vision of education, they faced the emergence of what Anderson calls the Hampton-Tuskegee model of black education: emphasis on a pedagogy and ideology that sought \"a social consensus that did not challenge traditional inequalities of wealth and power.\"(33) In an exceedingly detailed analysis of the ideas of Yankee Samuel Armstrong, founder of Hampton, Anderson shows how Armstrong waged a vigorous campaign against black suffrage, and used Hampton as a model for training blacks to occupy lowly roles as unskilled farm and domestic laborers in the southern economy. Under the leadership of Armstrong's famous student Booker T. Washington, the Hampton idea also underlay the formation of Tuskegee: thus, the Hampton-Tuskegee idea.\n\nUnder the impact of World War I and the mass migration of southern blacks to the North, black education entered yet another phase. White northern philanthropists, their southern allies, and blacks themselves embarked upon what became known as the Rosenwald school building program for elementary and increasingly for high schools by the mid-1920s. Although philanthropists hoped to replicate the Hampton-Tuskegee idea in these new building efforts, Anderson shows that they were only partially successful. Indeed, their efforts fell apart at the outset of the Great Depression, which clearly revealed that whites and blacks competed for the same jobs and that the training of blacks for a secure realm of subordinate jobs was impossible. As this reality dawned on white philanthropists, they turned their efforts toward the funding of black collegiate education.\n\nBased upon a broad range of primary and secondary sources, this study represents a milestone in the historiography of black education. Nonetheless, the study casts a wide net across the southern states and thus necessarily leaves some issues inadequately explored. The changing relationship between students, teachers, administrators, and the larger black community warrants much greater attention. As teachers increased their training and differentiated themselves from the mass of their students, for example, how did this affect their relationships in and out of the classroom? Moreover, the role of gender in shaping black education merits fuller treatment. How harmonious or conflictual was the relationship between black men and women educators and how did it change over the years, especially under the impact of World War I and the Great Depression? Finally, covering a wide scope, the book offers few examples from certain locales. While the study provides data on black education in West Virginia, for instance, it is not analyzed or discussed in sufficient depth. Compared to other southern states, West Virginia developed an unusually favorable reputation for supporting black education. Company-owned towns frequently provided better educational facilities for blacks than rural farm areas, but this variant of black education is not analyzed.\n\nSuch questions notwithstanding, this is a compelling book. It not only moves the study of black education well into the twentieth century, it links it to the antebellum and emancipation periods and raises a variety of issues for scholars to ponder over the next several decades. The Education of Blacks in the South will help to chart the course of research on black education for years to come. Indeed, this book is required reading for anyone seeking historical insights into the problems and prospects of black education today.\n\nJoe W. Trotter\n\nCarnegie-Mellon University\n\nTHE GREAT MIGRATION IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: NEW DIMENSIONS OF RACE, CLASS, AND GENDER. Ed. by Joe William Trotter, Jr. (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1991. Pp. x, 160. $10.95.)\n\nThe Great Migration in Historical Perspective, a new collection of essays edited by Joe William Trotter, Jr., challenges the traditional views of black migration from the South to other parts of the United States. The essays investigate this out-migration which began as a trickle immediately after the Civil War grew to a stream in the late 1800s and became a flood during the period from World War I to the end of World War II.\n\nThe collection deals with black migration to West Virginia and other areas of the upper South, to northern industrial areas, Chicago and other parts of the mid-West and the far West. Census data, letters from those who migrated and those who remained in the South, newspaper accounts of visits to and from the South and other primary materials present a grassroots view of what motivated many blacks to leave their homes and strike out for new opportunities elsewhere. These materials provide insight into the motivation for the move and show that many of the migrants were women seeking new lives for themselves and their children. The children were often left behind until sufficient funds were saved to send for them. Most migration studies of immigrants and blacks attributed moves of this type to males who prepared the way for their families, but apparently they overlooked a large group of independent women who did the same.\n\nProfessor Trotter's essay on black coal miners is of particular interest to students of West Virginia history. He traces the movement of former farmers and farm laborers from a number of different southern states to the coal mines of West Virginia. While most of what might be called his \"macro view\" of black migration has been used in other books and articles, Trotter's \"micro view\" is a new approach. He, like the other authors in the collection, emphasizes the use of primary materials to investigate the individual's motivation for migration. By using interviews, letters and material from previously little used West Virginia Bureau of Negro Welfare and Statistics reports, he has painted a new, believable and more humane picture of black migrants to the state. Trotter's essay reiterates the theme of the volume which is contained in the subtitle New Dimensions of Race, Class and Gender. The new dimension is that the migrants -- not economic conditions, sociological and political factors and white manipulation of blacks through the use of labor agencies and recruiters -- were responsible for the decision to move from the South to other parts of the country.\n\nProfessor Trotter's historiographical essay, \"Black Migration in Historical Perspective, A Review of the Literature,\" is thorough and interesting. He identifies various schools of thought, places them in their historical context and lists major historical contributions to each. He then shows how the articles in this volume collectively address the new approach, yet to be named, to black migration. In his conclusion, he calls for more historical research to further understanding of black migration.\n\nThe Great Migration in Historical Perspective is a welcome addition to the literature in black history. Even if a new school of historical interpretation fails to develop from this and other works, the book makes a contribution to our understanding of the impact of black migration on United States industry, culture, and politics. It also adds to the growing number of works by authors who interpret history by concentrating on the common person, the participant, rather than institutions which appear to control that person. It is hoped that this book will be followed by similar works on blacks and immigrants in the near future.\n\nKenneth R.

Pp. xii, 198. $25.00.)\n\nAlmost from the very day of its ratification, scholars, jurists and others have struggled to determine the original intent of the drafters of the American Constitution and the relevance of original intent to contemporary judicial decisions. The issue is particularly sensitive and crucial in interpreting many of the constitutional amendments, especially the Fourteenth. In his study Civil Rights, the Constitution, and Congress, 1863-1869, Earl Maltz, a professor of law, jumps with vigor into the debate. Starting from the position of an originalist, one who contends \"that courts should consider themselves bound by original understanding,\" Maltz argues that the civil rights legislation of the post-Civil War era, including the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, needs to be considered as a whole. He presents a reasonable, though not original, case that moderate and conservative Republicans, bound by their nineteenth-century definition of federalism, controlled Congress. Their view of the role of federal government prevailed in congressional civil rights legislation and amendments to the Constitution.\n\nAlthough Maltz deals with most key civil rights legislation, his greatest effort is expended on an analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment. In this discussion he raises the fundamental question of whether the drafters of the amendment intended it as a vehicle to grant broad new powers to the federal government. After an involved description of voting patterns, congressional speeches and legal precedence, Maltz concludes that the dominant conservative Republicans had no such goal in mind.\n\nMuch of Maltz's overall argument hinges on what he contends were two key elements of the ideology of conservative Republicans. He asserts that these Republicans favored \"the concept of limited absolute equality.\" Here Maltz is on safe ground; surely no scholar has recently argued that the conservative Republicans supported total racial equality. His discussion of this issue, however, exposes major problems. Maltz does not ask why various Republicans adopted the views they did. Neither does he delineate the numerous differences within the Republican party. In fact, it seems fair to suggest that Maltz is either uninterested in or unaware of the divisions within the party and yet an appreciation of those divisions is critical to an understanding of congressional action. Too often Maltz seems to be analyzing these men primarily as constitutional thinkers, when in reality they were essentially politicians.\n\nThis is not to deny Maltz's second contention, that conservative Republicans were quite \"concerned about maintaining constraints on the scope of federal power generally.\" However, in pressing his case Maltz has chosen to ignore that congressmen are elected officials, responsible to the voters. The Republicans he discusses rarely forgot that central fact of their political lives. In deciding to rely almost solely on congressional debates as his sources, Maltz has denied himself the opportunity to assess the overall political environment in which Congress operated. By denying the relevance to his argument of correspondence from constituents and editorial opinion, Maltz puts himself in the position of suggesting that Congress acted in a vacuum and that congressmen's views were not subject to public opinion.\n\nCuriously, though, at times Maltz does show an appreciation that southern actions were forcing Congress to reassess earlier policies and legislation. For example, he correctly acknowledges that southern rejection of the Fourteenth Amendment forced Congress to respond, but he fails to give the reader any sense of growing northern impatience with Reconstruction that compelled Congress to develop what became military reconstruction. This is the key matter for Maltz because military reconstruction required black suffrage in the South, something that conservative Republicans had opposed for several, including constitutional, reasons only months before. Had their constitutional views changed or had events pushed them to new ground? In fairness, it should be stated that Maltz seems to be more interested in a constitutional basis for congressional action than in explaining the pressures that led Congress to adopt certain legislation.\n\nMaltz has supplied a fairly in-depth examination of the intricacies of Republican constitutional theories and how they inform the debates over the Civil War amendments. Recognizing that his main concern is to determine original intent helps to place his analysis in the proper setting. Rather than viewing the legislation as the result of a historical process, Maltz is most interested in helping judges understand the intent of the framers. That is both the study's greatest strength and its most glaring weakness.\n\nRobert Sawrey\n\nMarshall University\n\nA. PHILIP RANDOLPH: PIONEER OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. By Paula E. Pfeffer (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Univ. Press, 1990. Pp. xi, 336. $29.95.)\n\nThe overwhelming purpose of slavery in the United States was economic exploitation. The continued exploitation following the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution was predicated on a subservience intertwined with race, which permitted Americans of European descent to dominate those of African descent. A. Philip Randolph's recognition of this factor in American internal economic relationships characterized his thinking throughout a long and achievement- filled career.\n\nPaula Pfeffer's portrayal of Randolph's prominent role in the leadership of the African-American community is an essential link connecting Frederick Douglass and George Washington Carver with the radicals of the 1960s and 1970s. Randolph's early organization of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and his eventually successful fight for its recognition as a legitimate bargaining unit, provided the financial basis and organizational skills for his later career. He introduced an economic thread into a post- World War II civil rights movement which has been seen primarily as a political and social phenomenon.\n\nMigrating from north Florida to the bustle of New York City, Randolph entered the freedom movement when civil rights had probably reached their lowest depths in modern America. Capitalizing on policy changes toward labor resulting from the Depression and World War II, Randolph used his involvement in the labor movement to spur fair employment practices and integration of the armed services, which eventually provided a much broader economic foundation for African Americans. This foundation would allow room for more action. Although Randolph was committed to resolving race problems with black leadership, he had to call on wealthier white associates to continue the movement and attain, in concert with other black leaders, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nThis reliance on white associates, combined with his allegiance to the labor movement, led to a growing split in his waning years with a new radical black Left which rejected both. Young leaders of movements such as the Black Panthers were oblivious to the radicalism exhibited by Randolph in an earlier age. \"Rather we die standing on our feet fighting for our rights than to exist upon our knees begging for life,\"(300) sounds more like Huey Newton than the Shakespearean oratory of the president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.\n\nThis book has been laboriously researched and documented. The detail in the writing, although cumbersome reading at times, provides a thorough background of the events surrounding A. Philip Randolph and the economic factors in the formation of the modern civil rights movement. West Virginia historians might have hoped for a more thorough review of Randolph's involvement and interaction with John L. Lewis and the United Mine Workers of America, rather than the brief mention that the two were congenial associates. The idea that economic power is essential to political change and civil rights, if not an articulated policy in the United Mine Workers' attitude to race relations, was certainly a by-product of the early integration of the mines. An analysis of Randolph's relationship with Lewis and the United Mine Workers (which was unique within the labor movement and presaged an integrated economic response to problems of black workers in a predominantly white union) could have made an important contribution to the study of the Appalachian region and its involvement in a wider struggle for freedom.\n\nI. D. Talbott\n\nGlenville State College LAW, GENDER & INJUSTICE: A LEGAL HISTORY OF U.S. WOMEN. By Joan Hoff (New York: New York Univ. Press, 1991. Pp. 525.)\n\nJoan Hoff's new book on the legal history of American women is the fifth work in a series called \"Feminist Crosscurrents.\" She states at the outset that after two centuries the law still does not meet women's needs and that the \"only hope\" is legal change based on \"radical feminism.\" This study, then, is not just an examination of women and the law from a historical perspective, but also a personal reinterpretation.\n\nHoff argues a fundamental theory that whenever women achieve some advance in their legal status, changes in contemporary society make this new status less meaningful. Women get rights men have when those rights are no longer important. For example, equal pay for equal work laws were enacted at a time of high unemployment. This argument underlies a key theme of the book: in the battle for legal rights, women have received too little, too late.\n\nReaders will find this work largely interpretive with a heavy dose of legal philosophy from a feminist perspective. Hoff divides constitutional development for women into four separate stages, beginning with the post- Revolutionary era and concluding with the Supreme Court's 1989 Webster abortion decision. The Constitution, she argues, is a document written and defined by males and cannot be used as a basis for women's rights enforcement. Had the Equal Rights Amendment movement succeeded, the result would have brought limited improvement in women's status.\n\nFollowing a colonial era of near complete subordination for married women, women's legal status only began to improve in the mid-nineteenth century with the laws of individual states. These laws brought an end to the debilitating legal principle of coverture. But that improvement over the years has been largely \"erratic.\" Protective legislation promoted by Progressive reformers in the early twentieth century demonstrates this. Here the unintended consequence was to assign women to \"sex-segregated inferior jobs.\" The popularity of no- fault divorce in the 1970s suggested some real benefits for women. Yet Hoff cites statistics which show that no-fault reform is leading to a \"feminization of poverty.\"\n\nIn short, readers must be prepared for a pessimistic outlook on the future of women's legal status in America. The word \"injustice\" in the title itself suggests a long history of failure to provide not equality for women (because equality is always defined by men), but equity. In the 1990s, the battle lines will be drawn, Hoff says, over the issue of pornography. Whether or not one agrees with Hoff's position, this book is well worth reading. With the knowledge learned here, readers cannot help but develop a much better appreciation of the still existing legal disabilities of American women and the pressing need for further change. How that change will be accomplished is still open to debate.\n\nDonna Spindel\n\nMarshall University\n\nWOMEN, MINORITIES, AND UNIONS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. By Norma M. Riccucci (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1990. Pp. 201. $37.95.)\n\nNumerous works have documented the efforts of unions to organize workers in private companies, but few scholars have made attempts to look at the activities of unions in the public sector. Similarly, despite the fact that affirmative action has promoted equal employment opportunities for men and women, few scholars have focused on union involvement in the public sphere. Frequently, it is more difficult to win recognition of unions in public than in private companies. Norma Riccucci breaks new ground in her recent publication Women, Minorities, and Unions in the Public Sector. Riccucci documents the involvement of unions in the employment of women and minorities. She also analyzes union attitudes toward the equal employment of women and minorities in the government sector, determining their motivations for support or opposition to unionization of public workers.\n\nRiccucci addresses the legal obligations of unions, labor-management cooperation, uniformed service jobs, and comparable worth. Interspersed throughout the book, the reader will find helpful charts, which include data on women and minorities in the public sector work force, union membership, female union officers, female representation in uniformed services, and federal government employees' annual salaries by gender. Riccucci includes eighteen charts illustrating the disparity between male and female/minority employment in the public sector.\n\nWomen, Minorities, and Unions in the Public Sector dispels the assumption that unions always promote and protect the interests of all their members, whether in the public or private sphere. Riccucci recounts an incident in which the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union brought a grievance against a manufacturing company because twenty-five female cutters were paid less than their male counterparts. The union won $29,771.36 in back wages for the female employees but insisted that only 25 percent of the amount be paid to the women. The rest should be paid to the one hundred male cutters to keep them from being dissatisfied to which the company agreed. The case demonstrates the disparity in union treatment of their male and female workers. Riccucci argues that an understanding of union involvement is necessary in order to clarify the role of unions in policymaking processes involving Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and Affirmative Action (AA) regulations. She concludes that because craft and industrial unions do not always support EEO and AA measures, their role in policy-making should be limited.\n\nThe author proves that union treatment of male, female and minority workers depends upon the particular type of union. Craft unions have resisted the entry of women and minorities more so than other unions. Industrial unions have reacted to female/minority employment rather ambiguously. Riccucci argues successfully that there is no absolute policy in regard to union efforts to organize female workers. In some cases, the national union may support a particular situation regarding women, which the local union may oppose.\n\nRiccucci does not propose to answer all the questions about union support for women and minorities in the public sector. But she raises important questions surrounding the issue. Riccucci attempts to deal with a very complicated issue that has heretofore been overlooked. For that reason, there are some shortcomings. As indicated in her introduction, some chapters emphasize minority male concerns, while others focus on women. While she states in a footnote that use of the term \"women\" refers to women of all colors, she does differentiate between white and minority women in her charts.\n\nPerhaps the book would have been strengthened had Riccucci placed it within the national historical context. She discusses the decline and popularity of unions, but fails to point to national reasons for those changes. She also shows that during the last two decades female involvement in unions increased, but ignores the influence of the women's rights movement on that change.\n\nRiccucci's conclusions are based largely on 113 cases of law relating to women, minorities, and unions in the public sector, and some union records. Her secondary sources include journal articles and books on public policy, and works by Philip Foner and William Gould.\n\nJerra Jenrette\n\nWest Virginia University\n\nREPUBLICANS AND RECONSTRUCTION IN VIRGINIA, 1865-70. By Richard Lowe (Charlottesville: Univ. of Virginia Press, 1991. Pp. 261. $35.00.)\n\nRichard Lowe has strengthened our knowledge of Reconstruction through his in- depth study of the role of the Republican party in Virginia during that turbulent and controversial period. While a number of scholars have explored the history of Virginia during the era and even related the state's experiences to national events, few have contributed book-length studies on the subject. Lowe has turned a key to understanding the Reconstruction era in Virginia, and that key is the story of Republicans in the state.\n\nProfessor Lowe describes his work as post-revisionist rather than revisionist. He has elected to take a positive view of Republican efforts during the period and to accentuate the successes which Republicans had in Virginia, especially in the areas of civil rights and constitutional reform. Lowe borders upon glorification of Virginia Republicans, but cannot escape the self-promoting and divisive attitudes and political maneuvers of Virginia's Republican leaders. Republican factions ran the gamut from political carpetbaggers to moderate coalitionists. The party included black activists, interstate business leaders, and conservative Whigs. Post-revisionist thought certainly should be included in a study of Republicanism during Reconstruction. Yet, Lowe's own study reveals power struggles between such men as John C. Underwood and Francis H. Pierpont, James W. Hunnicutt and John Minor Botts, Henry H. Wells and William Mahone. These battles and many others over numerous personal and political issues contributed to the Republican downfall in Virginia in 1869 as much as lack of northern support. Neither should blame be totally focused upon conservatives in the party. Lowe points to the internal power struggles but still holds to revisionist views and blames Republican losses upon northern apathy and, to a greater degree, upon naivete and stubbornness among conservative Republicans.\n\nStill, Lowe avoids being pedantic about his conclusions. His research is thorough and his character studies, gripping. He particularly contributes original and revealing research on the social history of blacks in Virginia's Reconstruction. Black political history is somewhat lacking, but such history is often relative to available source material, and Lowe's discussion of Virginia's black Republican leaders carries the same impact as all other character sketches in the book.\n\nThe author attempts a fresh approach throughout the book. He manages this through the use of Republican perspective. However, that perspective favors liberal and radical Republicans at the expense of moderates and conservatives. Governor Francis H. Pierpont furnishes a case in point. Lowe attributes Pierpont's conciliatory and cooperative politics to a naive sense of reality and manipulation by the conservatives. Yet, students of West Virginia history know Pierpont as an astute wartime politician who realized the need for cooperation among diverse groups for the good of the Union and state. Pierpont carried his views into Reconstruction and believed that Virginia could be more quickly healed and held together through efforts toward reconciliation.\n\nLowe also tries to avoid an economic interpretation of Reconstruction. Although it holds true importance, the rather stale explanation of Reconstruction in Virginia from a railroad perspective, with William Mahone as the central figure, receives only light treatment in this book.\n\nProfessor Lowe uses a traditional, chronological organization. He introduces the work with a historiographical discussion and explanation of his choice of emphasis and moves into a background sketch of Virginia Republicanism. Such a sketch necessitates a treatment of West Virginia history, and Lowe exhibits the awkwardness that many writers do when touching upon the joint history of Virginia and West Virginia during the 1860s. Lowe uses Pierpont as the main transitional figure and, thus, tends to exaggerate his roots in the Republican party.\n\nFollowing the two introductory chapters, Lowe stresses the growing rifts between conservative and radical Republicans and prepares the reader for congressional intervention and Pierpont's ouster. He devotes a chapter to the role of blacks in the party and explains their growing influence as a prelude to a chapter on the constitutional convention of 1867 and 1868 and John C. Underwood's leadership role. Sluggishness among federal military and congressional officials in backing the radicals and the new constitution and Republican rivalries allowed a moderate Republican movement led by Franklin Stearns to supplant Governor Henry H. Wells's power in a \"Year of Drift.\" Gilbert C. Walkers's gubernatorial victory and the union of his True Republicans with the Conservative party during the election of 1869 meant the \"End of Reconstruction.\" Interestingly, Lowe seems to give more credit for political astuteness to Stearns and Walker than to Pierpont and Botts despite the moderate efforts of each.\n\nRichard Lowe concludes that the Republican party did not lose its importance after the conservative surge of 1869 and 1870. He contends that it controlled politics through coalition efforts such as the Readjuster movement. This view is in keeping with Lowe's consistent positive view of the Republicans.\n\nLowe generally offers a fair treatment of Virginia's Reconstruction politics. He gives a crafted mixture of political and social history and enlightens Virginia's Reconstruction history. In a time of renewed interest in the Civil War, Reconstruction should be correspondingly studied. Lowe has helped to remind us of this and brings the era into a fresh perspective.\n\nRandall S. Gooden\n\nWest Virginia University\n\nLINCOLN, THE SOUTH AND SLAVERY: THE POLITICAL DIMENSION. By Robert W. Johannsen (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Univ. Press, 1991. Pp. 144. $19.95.)\n\nThe complex character and political savvy of Abraham Lincoln has been meticulously examined by a host of historians for over a century. Not until Robert W Johannsen's Lincoln, the South, and Slavery however, has the political dimension of Lincoln's antislavery stance been carefully probed.\n\n>From the passage of Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 to Lincoln's election as president in 1860, Lincoln's moral convictions on the slavery issue radically changed. Motivated by political ambition, his argument against slavery evolved in the six years prior to his becoming president from a \"middle-ground\" to a more extremist position. Through a skillful presentation of the facts, the author explains how and why Lincoln came to view Stephen A. Douglas as the personification of the slaveholding South, and why Lincoln distrusted popular sovereignty, claiming the voters \"would be corrupted by self-interest and not reject slavery.\"\n\nJohannsen asserts that Lincoln was firmly against slavery and the South much earlier in the 1850s than he admitted, and that he did not vigorously oppose slavery publicly until it was politically expedient. Placing the motivation for much of Lincoln's political activity of the early 1850s on simply trying to preserve the Whig party, the author states that the \"turmoil in Kansas, the increased militancy of the Southern proslavery leadership, the utter hopelessness of Whig fortunes, the rapid rise of Republican strength, and the imminence of the 1856 election, all worked their own peculiar influences on Lincoln's state of mind.\"\n\nAs Lincoln reluctantly embraced the Republican party in 1856 his ambiguity on the slavery issue remained intact. He \"straddled the fence\" with consummate skill while defending himself against Douglas's attacks on his famous \"House Divided\" speech. Ever the astute politician, Lincoln chose carefully the time and place for his public pronouncements on the slavery issue, weighing diligently the social and political impact his statements might have. He did not believe the South would secede and the South did not believe Lincoln when he declared that the idea of \"forcing slavery into a free State, or out of a slave State, at the point of a bayonet, is nonsense.\"\n\nIn the final analysis it is the author's contention that Lincoln's callous attitude toward the South in the 1860 election, and the realization that Republicans could elect a president without the support of the South, contributed to the final bloody result. Robert W. Johannsen offers compelling evidence to support his hypothesis in Lincoln, the South, and Slavery, and it is a work which every Lincoln fan or Civil War student should read.\n\nTim McKinney\n\nCharlton Heights\n\nGENTRY AND COMMON FOLK: POLITICAL CULTURE ON A VIRGINIA FRONTIER, 1740-1789. By Albert H. Tillson, Jr. (Lexington: Univ. Press of Kentucky, 1991. Pp. 228. $30.00.)\n\nIn Gentry and Common Folk Professor Albert H. Tillson, Jr. examines the changing political values and processes in the upper, or southern, part of the Valley of Virginia during the late colonial and Revolutionary periods. Although the upper valley differed in geography, population, and economy from most of Virginia, its leaders recreated both the governmental institutions and the political culture of the east. Power was placed in the hands of an elite whose position rested in part on land ownership, family connections, and domination of public offices and church affairs.\n\nCommon folk of the upper valley appear to have been less inclined than their eastern counterparts to defer to the gentry. For instance, in 1756, as a result of bloody and widespread Indian incursions in the wake of Braddock's defeat, upper valley militia participated in the Sandy Creek expedition against the Shawnee. But despite every effort of their commander Andrew Lewis, most of them, encouraged by their captains, turned back before reaching the Indian towns. Their refusal to continue on, however, stemmed more from the hardships they encountered, including incessant rains, swollen streams, loss of horses and food supplies, and failure to sight any Indians, than from any defiant antagonism toward Lewis. In short, the independent and self-reliant frontier militia did not defer to their leaders when their own self-interests were at stake.\n\nTillson maintains that in the upper valley respect for authority eroded during the Revolutionary era and that the war fostered a new political ethos dominated by regional values, voluntarism, and republicanism. He contends that Dunmore's War diminished the involvement of upper valley elite with eastern aristocracy and that by 1775 upper valley leaders began to resist royal authority and gave active support to the patriot cause.\n\nThe Revolution also contributed to a weakening of deferential behavior among the common people of the upper valley. Perhaps resistance to British authority inevitably led to questioning authority at other levels. Militia companies, which had for some time included indocile elements, began to insist upon a voice in the choice of officers, volunteer riflemen gained favor over traditional militia organizations, and court-martial procedures were democratized.\n\nResistance to the costs of war, heavy taxes, poor public credit, conscription for the Continental Army, and troublesome conditions among the militia also undermined the deferential politics of pre-Revolutionary times. Old tensions between the upper valley elite and the common folk were heightened by activities of surveyors and land speculators, with considerable popular animosity directed toward James Patton, John Buchanan, Thomas Walker, Judge Richard Henderson, and other land barons.\n\nMeanwhile, ideas of popular sovereignty were taking firm root in the upper valley. The belief that public decisions belonged to the people led to movements for new counties and even new states, notably that of Franklin. Local governments, however, underwent but few alterations. Nevertheless, upper valley leaders increasingly accommodated themselves to the desires of their constituents and used republican ideology whenever it seemed to be to their advantage.\n\nThe most serious threat to patriot authority in the upper valley arose from the Tory movement, which began about 1780 and centered to some extent among the German and Welsh elements of the population. Resting in part on ethnic frictions, Toryism was identified with local interests and hostility toward upper valley leaders, as well as what many perceived as an alien world. Ironically, the methods used to suppress Toryism further undermined traditional political values and increased the acceptance of the new popular attitudes of the region.\n\nIn his final chapter, Tillson applies the techniques of structuralism, as developed by Claude Levi-Strauss, to John Stuart's Memoir of Indian Wars and Other Occurrences. Although he recognizes that \"several aspects of historical narratives such as Stuart's limit their susceptibility to structural analysis\"(146), Tillson asserts that \"the most significant and inclusive structured element of Stuart's text is his description of authority and order\"(147) and that it leads him to deviate from his focus on the Greenbrier region and from his strictly chronological pattern of development. As examples, he cites Stuart's attention to Andrew Lewis's performance at the Battle of Point Pleasant and details the role of Dick Pointer in the defense of Fort Donnally (which Tillson consistently spells \"Donnelly\").\n\nTillson contends that Stuart's Memoir reveals \"fundamental differences between the colonial and revolutionary periods\"(153) and that it implies a \"decline in traditional patterns of authority and order\" which contributed to \"a loss of virtue in Greenbrier society(151).\" He maintains that \"throughout the colonial period, Andrew Lewis and the Greenbrier settlers were morally superior to the Indians and to the British officials who deceived and betrayed them\"(155), but that the Revolutionary militiamen reversed these roles in the murder of Cornstalk.\n\nSome of Tillson's examples and arguments in support of his post-structuralist views are open to question. For instance, Andrew Lewis's refusal to make \"selfabasing appeals for popular support\"(150) and his cold, aloof manner may have been as much personality traits as indications of preoccupation with authority.\n\nIn order to portray Colonel John Fields's disdain for authority, Tillson gives a somewhat distorted account of the attack on Walter Kelly's settlement at Cedar Grove in 1774. In a similar vein, he fails to mention the important service of John Pryor and Philip Hammond in warning Greenbrier settlers of an attack in 1778. Hammond's role, equal to that of the slave Dick Pointer, in stemming the attack on Fort Donnally is also overlooked. Stuart's Memoir gives attention to all of these matters.\n\nHistorians have long been familiar with the sources which Tillson uses both extensively and judiciously. Noting that Jack P. Greene and others hold a contrary view that there was no \"substantial erosion of popular respect for the elite or the values that sanctioned its authority\"(2), Tillson reaches conclusions closer to those of Rhys Isaac, Norman K. Risjord, and Richard Beeman, who emphasize developing divisions between the elite and the common folk and the growing importance of issue-oriented politics. Tillson has produced a careful and stimulating study of a significant segment of the Virginia frontier during a formative half century of its history.\n\nOtis K. Rice\n\nWest Virginia Institute of Technology\n\nVIRGINIA FOLK LEGENDS. Ed. by Thomas E. Barden (Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia, 1991. Pp. xiv, 348. $14.95.) Both the general reader seeking a good haunting tale and the serious academic folklore scholar will find much of interest in Virginia Folk Legends, edited by Thomas E. Barden. This important collection of stories is extracted from the vast gathering of materials made between mid-1937 and mid-1942 by employees of the Virginia Writers' Project (VWP), a subsidiary of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). This publication, with its rich text and the editor's equally rich introductory information, creates a multifaceted study of a region's oral literature traditions. It is important to look at three aspects of this work: the content itself, the understanding of such material within its historical context as presented by the editor, and finally, its larger comparison to other works and needed efforts.\n\nThe editor has selected 150 stories from a collection of hundreds which fall easily into groups he feels \"emerged organically from the categories of the WPA collection itself.\" With the extension of the usual definition of legend, the table of contents lists stories about animals, beginnings, the Civil War and emancipation, conjure and witchcraft, ghosts, haunted houses, Indians, legendary people from the African-American files, legendary people from the Anglo-American files, murder and violence, place-names, Simon Kenton, spirit dogs, supernatural events, treasure, and unusual events. Each of these groupings begins with an excellent introduction by the editor. It is here that he makes academic reference to similar materials from the history of folklore study, discusses his particular choice of stories to represent the category from the collection itself, and attempts to interpret the meaning and role of oral folk literature within the everyday human experience from which it arises. The editor includes extensive footnoting, as well as motif indexing and informant data.\n\nThe reader will find stories that are very similar to many regions (even extending internationally and spanning the course of history), such as the forces of good versus evil and the physical appearances that each take. Animal transformation, witches, ghosts, haunted houses, and the trickster are all here. The more regional lore contains stories of Simon Kenton (the WPA collector nearly deleted these legendary stories because they did not conform to factual information about this individual). The West Virginia reader should find interest in this material, especially when reading both the stories and the historical information provided by the editor. Stories dealing with place naming are always intriguing and call to mind the West Virginia definitive study by Hamill Kenny, West Virginia Place Names: Their Origin and Meaning (1945).\n\nVirginia Folk Legends also contains several interesting accounts of mysterious treasures buried long ago and supposedly never reclaimed. Of special interest are the stories of the Swift Mines. The four stories included here about the vast silver treasures of one individual, a Mr. Swift, are exact extensions of the same lore appearing in the West Virginia collection by Lucullus Virgil McWhorter entitled The Border Settlers of Northwestern Virginia: From 1768 to 1795 (1915). The supernatural or ghostly and the preternatural or ghastly devil and witch stories (the editor considers all as supernatural) contain all the usual elements of such encounters. The helpful, revengeful, or noisy ghost in one form or another appears in all the ghostly tales. The witch tales also have a large proportion of silver bullets, animal transformations, and bewitched cows. One particular story, \"Cooking a Witch's Shoulder\" contains the same motifs found in the story \"The Black Cat Murders,\" collected and published by West Virginia folklorist Patrick W Gainer in Witches, Ghosts and Signs (1975). All the stories in Virginia Folk Legends are certainly entertaining and the editor challenges the reader to extract the \"realness and truthfulness\" of the stories.\n\nThe importance of this collection most certainly lies well beyond the interesting stories. The fact that large collections of such material were made nationwide by the WPA is highly significant. Associated with this national collecting project were John A. Lomax and Benjamin (B. A.) Botkin, who served as folklore unit directors. Much of this work later found its way into print and all readers of folklore will instantly recognize the acclaimed A Treasury of American Folklore, edited by B. A. Botkin (1954), as well as other regional collections which he edited and published. It is interesting to note that Lomax was replaced by Botkin because he was giving too much emphasis to publishing from the ongoing collections when in the long run, Botkin was the ultimate beneficiary of publications from the project. Despite the WPA folklore materials published by Lomax and Botkin, much remained stored and forgotten at university and state archives libraries. Such was the case with the Virginia collection until Mr. Barden, a graduate student, and others at the University of Virginia rediscovered the collection in the university library and began researching and editing the materials for publication.\n\nThis definitive collection of Virginia traditional oral literature, endorsed by the American Folklore Society, New Series works, is certainly important in its own right. But it also acknowledges the vast amount of boxed-up materials that likewise lie waiting in many other repositories around the country. West Virginia materials generally have been collected and published by interested individual folklorists, working without support from any official agency."
