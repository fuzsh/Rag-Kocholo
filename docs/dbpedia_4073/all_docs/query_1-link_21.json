        "text": "VIRGINIA BIOGRAPHY\n\nI  GOVERNORS OF THE STATE  1861-1915\n\n[Page 3]\n\nLetcher, John, son of William Letcher, was born at Lexington, Rockbridge county, Virginia, March 28, 1813. He took a course at Washington College, where he also studied law. He entered upon practice in Lexington, and for some time was also editor of the \"Valley Star.\" In 1850 he sat in the constitutional convention; as a Democrat he served in congress, 1852-59, and was active on the ways and means committee. He was governor from January 1, 1859, to January 1, 1864, thus holding the office at the time of secession, which policy he had previously opposed, but earnestly supported when the Federal government resorted to force; and it was at his instance that the state forces were at once placed at the disposal of the Confederate government, without waiting for a vote of the people. At the close of the war he resumed practice at Lexington, and in 1875 was elected a member of the house of delegates. In 1876, while attending upon the house, he was stricken with paralysis. He lingered eight years, and finally died at his home in Lexington, January 26, 1884.\n\n[Page 3]\n\nSmith, William, second term, January, 1864-May 9, 1865 (q. v.).\n\n[Page 3]\n\nPierpont, Francis H., born in Monongahela county,, Virginia, January 25, 1814. He graduated from Allegheny (Pennsylvania) College in 1839, then taught school in Mississippi, studied law, returned home, and entered upon practice at Fairmont, Marion county. He was a pronounced anti-slavery man, and at the Wheeling convention in 1861, called to reorganize the state government, was unanimously chosen governor, and held office under this election for a year; meanwhile he was elected by the people of West Virginia to fill an unexpired term of two years, and subsequently re-elected for the full four-year term. After the division of Virginia into two separate states in 1863 he removed the state Archives to Alexandria, convened a so-called legislature, remained there two years, and in 1864 called a convention which decreed the abolition of slavery. May 29, 1865, he removed the seat of the government to that city. On the expiration of his term as governor, he resumed practice at Fairmont; in 1870 he was elected to the West Virginia legislature; and served as collector of internal revenue under President Garfield.\n\n[Pages 3-4]\n\nWells, Henry Horatio, born in Rochester, New York, September 17, 1823; educated at Romeo (Michigan) Academy, and was a lawyer. He was a member of the Michigan legislature in 1854-56. He was colonel of the Twenty-Sixth Michigan Infantry in the civil war, serving with distinction, and was brevetted brigadier-general. In 1865 he settled in Richmond, Virginia, and engaged in law practice. In 1868 he was appointed provisional governor, under military authority, superseding Governor Pierpont; in 1869, as a Republican, he was defeated for governor by Gilbert C. Walker. He was afterward appointed United States district attorney for the eastern district of Virginia by President Grant. He resigned in 1872, and resumed the practice of his profession. In 1875 he removed to Washington City, and became United States attorney for District of Columbia. He held this post till 1879. While Wells was a military appointee, and therefore looked upon as an alien by the people of Virginia, they had a kindly regard for him because of the general friendliness of his conduct.\n\n[Page 4]\n\nWalker, Gilbert Carleton, born in Binghamton, New York, August 1, 1832; educated in various colleges, lastly Hamilton College, graduating in 1854, and winning the first prize for oratory. He subsequently studied law He became the recognized leader of the young Democracy of Tioga county, New York. He removed to Chicago, Illinois, where he became prominent at the bar. On account of his health he settled in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1864, where he was an active leader in financial and manufacturing affairs and was president of a bank. In 1869 he became candidate for governor, in opposition to the Republican nominee. Being elected, his rigid enforcement of law and order won for him the title of \"Political Savior of Virginia.\" He established a well organized free school system, enforced rigid economy in public expenditures, and secured the reorganization of the state debt and the re-establishment of the public credit. When he retired, he was unquestionably the most popular man in Virginia, and the one term principle alone prevented his re-election. He was elected to congress from the Richmond district in 1874 and again 1876. During his four years of congressional service, he was a principal member of several important committees  the Pacific railroads, revision of the laws, expenditures of the state department, and education and labor. In 1881 he located in New York City, where he secured a large law practice, in association with Gen. B. F. Tracy, and was known as a popular and effective orator. He was also a very handsome man and an excellent speaker. He died im May, 1888.\n\n[Pages 4-5]\n\nKemper, James Lawson, born in Madison county, Virginia, June 11, 1823, son of William Kemper, a descendant of John Kemper, a member of one of the twelve families from Oldenburg, Germany, seated by Gov. Spotswood upon his lands at Germanna, Virginia. He was graduated from Washington College, and became a lawyer. He was a captain of volunteers in 1847, commissioned by President Polk. He served ten years in the legislature, being speaker two years, and a number of years chairman of the military affairs committee; was president of board of visitors of Virginia Military Institute. He was made colonel of the Seventh Virginia Regiment on May 2, 1861, and was promoted brigadier-general in May, 1862. He took art in many battles, and was desperately wounded while leading his brigade in a charge at Gettysburg. After he had sufficiently recovered, he was placed in command of the local forces in and about Richmond, and so served until the close of the war, meantime being promoted to major-general. After peace was restored, he resumed law practice in Madison county. He took an active part in opposition to the Republicans, and was elected governor in 1873; while so serving, a legislative committee waited upon him to assure him of his unanimous election as United States senator if he would accept, but he declined, declaring that the state had already bestowed upon him the highest position in its power  the one he now held. He retired to his farm in Orange county, and died at Gordonsville, April 7, 1895. He married Mrs. C. Conway Cave.\n\n[Page 5]\n\nHolliday, Frederick William Mackey, born in Winchester, Virginia February 22, 1828, son of Dr. Richard J. M. Holliday, an early settler of Scotch-Irish ancestry. He graduated from Yale College in 1847, and then entered the University of Virginia, from which he was graduated in law after one session, and was selected as final orator of the Jefferson Literary Society. He was made commonwealth attorney for Frederick county, and served until the war broke out. He went with the first troops to Harper's Ferry, and on his return became captain of a company, which was assigned to the Third Regiment, of the Stonewall Brigade, and rose to the colonelcy; was in numerous engagements, losing his right arm at Cedar run (or Slaughter's Mountain), disabling him for field service. He then entered the Confederate congress, of which he continued a member until peace was restored. Resuming practice, he took first rank at the Winchester bar. He was a commissioner at the Centennial Exposition of 1876, in Philadelphia; in the same year he was a presidential elector. Without opposition, he was elected governor in 1877. His administration was principally concerned with the state debt question, and he vetoed the repudiation scheme. As governor he delivered the address of welcome at the Yorktown Centennial, under congressional appointment. After retiring from office he busied himself on his farm, and in literary pursuits. He died at Winchester, May 20, 1899.\n\n[Pages 5-6]\n\nCameron, William Evelyn, born in Petersburg, Virginia, November 29, 1842, son of Walker Anderson Cameron and Elizabeth Page (Walker) Cameron, his wife. His father was a cotton broker, descended from Sir Ewan Lochiel, the celebrated chief of clan Cameron in Scotland. Among Gov. Cameron's distinguished American progenitors were Benjamin Harrison, who settled in Virginia in 1630, and was secretary to the colony; Sir Dudley Digges, master of the rolls to King Charles I.; Col. William Byrd, of Westover (1683); and Edmund Jenings (1690), deputy governor of the colony 1706-10. The founder of the Cameron family in Virginia and North Carolina was the Rev. John Cameron (1770), graduate of Aberdeen University, an Episcopal clergyman, and rector of old Blandford Church, Petersburg, Virginia.\n\nWilliam E. Cameron's early life was spent in his native city. he was studious and ambitions. He attended various schools, among which was the classical school of Mr. Charles Campbell, of Petersburg, the historian of Virginia. His first early employment was that of a clerk on a Mississippi steamboat. In 1860, he was selected for a cadetship at West Point, and took a preparatory course in St. Louis under Capt. (afterward Major-General) John Reynolds. In 1861, he acted as drillmaster for the Missouri state troops, and was captured at Camp Jackson, but escaped the same night, and returned to Virginia. There he joined at Norfolk Company A, Twelfth Virginia Regiment, and subsequently took part in every engagement of Lee's army, except Sharpsburg, being at that time disabled by a wound received at Second Manassas which disabled him for several months. Promoted to second lieutenant in June, 1861, he was appointed regimental adjutant in May, 1862, on the brigade staff January, 1863, made inspector of Davis's Mississippi brigade, February, 1864, appointed adjutant-general of Weisiger's Virginia brigade, September, 1864, and in this capacity surrendered with Mahone's division at Appomattox in April, 1865.\n\nReturning to his native city, Capt. Cameron was local editor of a small daily paper founded by the late A M. Keiley, which was suppressed by Gen. Canby. He was then city editor of the Petersburg \"Index\" until 1866, when the Norfolk Virginian\" was founded and put under his editorial management. The following year he purchased the \"Index,\" became its editor, and continued until 1872, when he became associated with the late Baker P. Lee in editing the \"Richmond Enquirer.\" In the reconstruction times, Capt. Cameron was foremost in advocating the conservative policy which resulted in July, 1869, in the election of Gilbert C. Walker as governor, and the redemption of the state from the carpet-baggers. He became involved in a duel with the late Judge Robert W. Hughes, and was badly wounded. In 1876, he was elected mayor of Petersburg, and was twice re-elected. In 1879, he was one of those Democrats who declared in favor of a readjustment of the state debt, and did strenuous battle for his views in the \"Richmond Whig,\" and on the stump, and in 1880 was a Hancock elector on the Readjuster ticket. In the following year he was nominated for governor by the Readjuster convention, against Maj. John W. Daniel, candidate of the regular Democrats whose platform pledged the state to pay the debt as funded. Capt. Cameron was elected by a substantial majority. After his four years of gubernatorial service, he engaged in the practice of law. In 1892, he was appointed agent for the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, was later appointed a member of the Jury of Awards of liberal Arts, and still later was selected to prepare a history of that great enterprise. He remained in Chicago until 1894, when he returned to Petersburg. In 1896, he supported Palmer and Buckner against William Jennings Bryan and the proposed free-coinage of silver. In 1901, he was elected without opposition to the constitutional convention of Virginia, and in the convention, he was chairman of the committee on the executive department, and member of the committees on the judiciary and on final revision. He ranked as a polished and forceful speaker, and as a well-informed constitutional lawyer. In 1908 he removed to Norfolk, where for seven years he has been editor of the \"Norfolk Virginian.\" Among the products of his pen are a \"History of the World's Fair,\" (1892); \"The Columbian Exposition,\" (1894); and biographical sketches of Lee, Tyler, Wise, and other distinguished Virginians.\n\nOn October 2, 1868, William E. Cameron married Louisa C. Egerton, of Petersburg, Virginia. They have had three children.\n\n[Page 7]\n\nLee, Fitzhugh, born at Clermont, Fairfax county, November 19, 1835, son of Commodore Sydney Smith Lee, U. S. N., grandson of \"Light Horse Harry Lee,\" and nephew of Gen. Robert E. Lee. After receiving an academical education he was appointed to the United States military academy in 1852, graduating in 1856, and was commissioned second lieutenant of cavalry. He was in active service against the Indians, and was severely wounded. In May, 1860, he was ordered to report at the United States Military Academy as cavalry instructor, and was on this duty until the outbreak of the civil war when he resigned. Entering the Confederate service, he was commissioned first lieutenant of cavalry. For four months he was adjutant-general of Gen. Ewell's brigade. In August, 1861, he was made lieutenant-colonel of the First Virginia Cavalry, was promoted to colonel in March, 1862; to brigadier-general, July 24, 1862, and to major-general, August 3, 1863. He was with the Army of Northern Virginia in all its campaigns. He was severely wounded in the battle of Winchester, September 19, 1864, and had three horses shot under him. In March, 1865, he was given command of the cavalry corps, Army of Northern Virginia, with which, in April, he surrendered to Gen. Meade, at Farmville, Virginia, and returned home, living in retirement several years. in 1874, on invitation, he attended the Bunker Hill Centennial, and his speech on that occasion was one of the earliest efforts of leading men on either side to lay aside the asperities of the late conflict, and grow together in the old fraternal bonds. In 1886, at the Washington Centennial celebration, New York City, at the head of the Virginia troops in the parade, he received an ovation second to that accorded to no public man present. He was elected governor in 1885, serving until 1890, the constitutional provision alone preventing a re-election. In 1896 he was made consul-general at Havana, by President Cleveland. During this service he had ample opportunity to distinguish himself by his calm but firm protection of American interests, amid the ragings of the Cuban rising against the Spaniards. His life was threatened, and Americans were in constant danger. In this contingency he had full power to call war vessels from Key West, but did not resort to this method. When the government was obliged to send a war vessel, he cabled to the state department recommending delay of such action, but the Maine had already sailed and was out of reach, and that ship was destroyed by a submarine explosion soon after her arrival at Havana. Following this, the feeling against Americans in Cuba was very threatening. On March 5th Spain asked for the recall of Gen. Lee, which was refused, but on April 5th all American consuls were recalled, and Lee with many other American citizens, returned home. On the organization of troops, Gen. Lee was placed in command of the Seventh corps, and though it was not called into active service, he was designated, in the event of military movements about Havana, to command operations. Late in 1898 he was given command of the artillery forces in the district of Havana, and later of the department of Cuba. He was author of the life of his uncle, Gen. Robert E. Lee, in a \"Great Commander\" series. He died in City, April 28, 1905.\n\n[Page 8]\n\nMcKinney, Philip Watkins, was born in Buckingham county, Virginia, May 1, 1832, son of Charles McKinney. He graduated from Hampden-Sidney College, taking high rank as a speaker, and receiving the Philanthropic Society gold medal. He studied law under Judge Brockenbrough, of Lexington, and engaged in practice; the same year (1858_) he was elected to the general assembly , in which he served with distinction four terms, until the close of the war. He was a strong Union man, but went with his state when it seceded. He became captain of a company in the Fourth Cavalry Regiment, and served with it until severely sounded at Brandy Station, thereafter being on post duty at Danville. After the war he resumed practice. He was a Democratic candidate for congress, twice a presidential elector, several times commonwealth's attorney, and a delegate to the national conventions of 1884 and 1888, and was elected attorney-general in 1881. In 1889 he was elected governor, over William Mahone, and his administration was notable for its successful settlement of the state debt, on a plan of readjustment which was acceptable to the bondholders, since which time the interest has been steadily paid.\n\n[Page 8]\n\nO'Ferrall, Charles Triplett, was born near Brucetown, Frederick county, Virginia, October 21, 1840. His father was John O'Ferrall of Scotch-Irish descent, a farmer and hotel proprietor of Morgan county, Virginia, now West Virginia, who served as clerk of the county court, sheriff, and member of the legislature. He attended private schools and at fifteen began public life as deputy clerk of the circuit court of Morgan county, and on the death of his father in 1857 he was appointed by the governor to full the vacancy. In 1861 he entered the Confederate army and during the course of the war, rose to be colonel of cavalry. He was wounded several times and was once left for dead on the battlefield. After the war Col. O'Ferrall studied law at Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, which was at the time, presided over by Gen. R. E. Lee. He then began to practice law at Harrisonburg in Rockingham county. He was soon elected to the legislature and took an active part in saving the state from the \"carpet-baggers.\" In 1874, he was made by the legislature county judge of Rockingham. In 1884 he was elected to the forty-eighth congress and was re-elected to the five succeeding congresses, serving form May 5, 1884, to March 3, 1895. After this he was elected governor of the state (January 1, 1894  January 1, 1898). When his term of office came to an end, he settled in Richmond and practiced law, meeting with much success. He died September 22, 1905. As a public speaker Gov. O'Ferrall had few equals, and his \"four Years of Active Service\" is a book of much value and has been highly praised.\n\n[Pages 8-10]\n\nTyler, James Hoge, born at his father's home, \"Blenheim,\" Caroline county, Virginia, August 11, 1846, son of Hon. George Tyler and Elva (Hoge) Tyler, his wife. The father, oldest son of Henry and Lucy (Coleman) Tyler, owned the \"Blenheim\" estate and many others, and was known for his hospitality and generosity; he was a member of the Virginia legislature both before and after the civil war. His mother dying at his birth, James Hoge Tyler was brought up by his grandparents, Gen. and Mrs. James Hoge, at their home, \"Belle Hampton, in Pulaski county, Virginia. When he was ten years old, his grandmother died, and his grandfather, stricken with paralysis, made him an assistant in his business affairs. To the age of fifteen he was instructed by private tutors and by his grandfather. After the death of Gen. Hoge, in 1861, he joined his father in Caroline county, and was sent to the school of Franklin Minor in Albemarle county. When Virginia seceded, he enlisted as a private in the Confederate army, and served throughout the war with characteristic courage and fidelity. After the surrender, he returned to Pulaski county, and took up farm work, but soon became interested in public-affairs, and wrote frequently for the press urging manufacturing and mining development. In 1877 he was elected to the state senate, and proved himself a most efficient legislator. He urged the reduction of state taxes from fifty to forty cents. As a member of the commission which settled the state debt, his influence was potent in effecting a saving of interest. He was a member of the board of public buildings at Blacksburg and Marion, and the labors of that body received special commendation by the governor. He was made rector of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Virginia Polytechnic Institute), but resigned to enter upon his duties as lieutenant-governor, to which office he was elected in 1889. He was a member of the commission to examine into the disputed Virginia-Maryland boundary line, and was elected chairman of the joint committee of the two states. He gave earnest attention to the resources of the state, and in public addresses and letters to the press, he urged displays at the various fairs and expositions. In 1897, by acclamation he was made the Democratic candidate for governor, and was elected by a majority of more than 52,000 votes. During his term of office he greatly contributed to the prosperity of the state. By careful economy, the state debt was reduced by more than a million dollars, nor was this done at the expense of any public concern. Besides meeting the additional expense incident to an extra legislative session and a constitutional convention, the public school fund was increased by $21,000, and the literary fund by $68,000, while more than $800,000 remained in public treasury, and the constitutional convention further reduced the tax rate from forty to thirty cents. He recommended a labor bureau, and the conditional pardon system, and these were established; the agricultural department was placed upon a sound practical basis; and all the state institutions received liberal and sympathetic support. During his term also the Virginia-Tennessee boundary dispute was settled.\n\nIn 1892 he was a delegate to the Pan-Presbyterian Alliance at Toronto, Canada; and in 1896 went to Scotland as a representative of the Southern General Assembly at the Alliance meeting in Glasgow. He was a member of the board of trustees of Hampden-Sidney College, of the Union Theological Board, and of the board of the Synodical Orphans' Home at Lynchburg. Since retiring from the governorship he has resided at East Radford, Virginia, where he has been active in various business enterprises. He was married, in 1868, to Miss Sue Montgomery Hammet. Gov. Tyler is descended from Richard Tyler, who settled in Essex county in the latter part of the seventeenth century (q. v. I, 346). He is a very happy and popular speaker and is distinguished for his genial and affable manners.\n\n[Page 10]\n\nMontague, Andrew Jackson, born in Campbell county, Virginia, October 3, 1862, son of Judge Robert Latané Montague (q. v.). He was educated at private schools and by private tutors in Middlesex y and in early youth developed a taste for the best of English literature  historical, biographical, poetical. After a year in the grammar school of William and Mary College, Williamsburg, he entered Richmond College, at Richmond, Virginia, and in due time was graduated from several of the schools of that institution, and having achieved much distinction as an orator and debater in the literary societies. He served as a private tutor from 1882 to 1884, and displayed such ability as to give promise of a high place in the educational field, had he seen proper to engage in it permanently. In the summer of 1884 he became a law student in the University of Virginia, under Professor John B. Minor, took the regular course in the following session, and in 1885 was graduated with the B. L. degree. He then entered upon practice in Danville, Virginia, and soon took a prominent place at the bar. He took an enthusiastic interest in politics, and in the campaign of 1892 he attracted the admiring attention of Mr. Cleveland, who, on coming to the presidency in the following year, appointed him United States district attorney for the western district of Virginia. In 1897 he was elected attorney-general of the state, and therefore resigned the district attorneyship. His services in this new position, during his four year term were conspicuously creditable, and a factor in his further advancement. In 1901 he was the Democratic nominee for governor, over several distinguished competitors, and in the ensuing campaign he delivered may able speeches, and was elected by a large majority. During his four year term, he won general commendation as a most useful and progressive executive. In large measure, to him is due a deeply awakened interest in the public school system, and its substantial development. It was largely through his instrumentality that the primary plan for the nomination of United States senators was adopted. Retiring from the gubernatorial chair in 1906, Mr. Montague resumed the practice of his profession, in Richmond, and in May, of the same year, President Roosevelt selected him as one of the six delegates from the United States to the Third International Conference of American States, in Rio de Janeiro, July 21, 1906. Mr Montague is well read in sociology and political economy, and in 1905 he received from Brown University, Rhode Island, the degree of LL. D. He was married December 11, 1889, to Elizabeth Lynne Hoskins, of Middlesex county. In 1913 he succeeded John Lamb in congress from the Richmond district and is the present incumbent.\n\n[Pages 10-11]\n\nSwanson, Claude Augustus, born March 31, 1862, at Swansonville, Pittsylvania county, son of John Muse Swanson and Catherine Pritchett, his wife. His father was a highly respected merchant and manufacturer of tobacco in Pittsylvania county, who suffered a reverse and lost all his property in the panic of 1876. The subject of this sketch was put early to school and made steady progress, but the misfortune which involved his father compelled him to suspend his education at fourteen years of age and go to work on the farm, and while thus engaged he gave his spare time to his books. At the age of sixteen he taught school, and after two years had saved enough money to pay his way for two sessions at the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College at Blacksburg. He then clerked in a grocery store at Danville two years, and while so engaged, four prominent men of that city voluntarily offered to lend him sufficient money to complete his education. After much hesitation, he accepted this offer, giving his notes for the amounts advanced by them, and declining their offer of a free gift. He then went for three years to Randolph-Macon College, where he took the degree of A. B., the Sutherlin medal for oratory, and the debater's medal in the Washington Literary Society. While at this college he edited the \"Hanover and Caroline News,\" the organ of the Democratic party for those counties. In 1886 he attended the University of Virginia, and took the degree B. L., accomplishing in one year the two years course. On his return home he entered upon practice at Chatham, Pittsylvania county, and in two years was enabled to return every dollar of the money lent him by his generous benefactors. In 1882 he was nominated for congress over many competitors, was elected, and afterwards was even without opposition nominated and elected for six terms (1882-1896). In 1901 he made a vigorous campaign for the gubernatorial nomination, but was defeated in the convention at Norfolk by A. J. Montague. He engaged in the canvass, and made more speeches than any other man in the state, and thus won thousands of friends, and when, in 1905, the first trial was made of a popular primary for the nomination of governor, he easily won the coveted prize by a large vote. He served four years till February 1, 1910, and on August 1, 1910, was appointed by Gov. Mann to fill the vacancy in the United States senate occasioned by the death of John W. Daniel, and afterwards was confirmed in the office by the general assembly. His term expires March 3, 1917, but Mr. Swanson is so popular in his manner and so loyal to all the interests of the state that he will be doubtless re-elected his own successor. Mr. Swanson is a member of Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity, of the Masonic order, of the Elks, and of the Odd Fellows, and is fond of fishing, hunting and horseback riding. In religious preference he is a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church South. He married Lizzie Deane Lyons, December 11, 1894; they have no children.\n\n[Pages 11-12]\n\nMann, William Hodges, was born at Williamsburg Virginia, July 31, 1843, son of John Mann and Mary Hunter (Bowers) Mann, his wife. The first five or six years of his life, he attended school in his native place, and afterward the Brownsburg (Virginia) Academy. He was deputy clerk of Nottoway county, 1859-61, and in June of the latter year he enlisted as a private in Company E, Twelfth Regiment Virginia Volunteers, a part of Gen. Mahone s division. He acted as a scout in the operations at Petersburg, was taken prisoner in 1863 and escaped, but on account of injuries received in this line of duty, he was obliged to leave the service, and resumed his work as deputy clerk of Nottoway county. He studied law without assistance, and was admitted to the bar in 1867. In 1890 he became county judge of Nottoway county, serving until 1892, when he resigned. He was an active and effective campaign speaker, and in 1899 was a member of the Democratic State Executive committee; during the same period he was a state senator, and chairman of the committee on revison of laws of Virginia. He was the author of the \"Mann Law,\" under the operations of which were closed about eight hundred saloons in the country districts where there was no police protection; and he was also patron of the high school bill, passed in 1906, and under which some four hundred and fifty high school buildings have been erected. In 1910 he was elected governor, and his administration proved most notable, especially in giving practical effect to the temperance and public school legislation which he advocated so strenuously during his senatorial service The termination of his term of office did not mean absolute retirement, as Gov. Mann has been very active since that date in making campaign speeches and taking part in public affairs. He resides at his plantation in Nottoway county,, and is much interested in farming. He married (first) Sallie Fitzgerald, who died November 2, 1881, and (second) at Petersburg, Etta, daughter of Hon. Alexander and Anna Wilson Donnan."
