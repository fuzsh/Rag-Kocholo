        "meta_description": "The governor of Virginia is the state's head of government and commander-in-chief of the state's official national guard. The first Constitution of 1776 created the office of governor, to be elected annually by the Virginia State Legislature. The governor could serve up to three years at a time, and once out of office, could not serve again for four years. The 1830 constitution changed the thrice-renewable one-year term length to a non-renewable three-year term, and set the start date at the first day in January following an election. This constitution also prevented governors from succeeding themselves, a prohibition that exists to the present day. The 1851 Constitution increased terms to four years and made the office elected by the people, rather than the legislature. The commencement of the Governor's term was moved to the first day in February by the 1902 Constitution, and then to the Saturday after the second Wednesday in January by the 1971 and current Constitution.",

The first Constitution of 1776 created the office of governor, to be elected annually by the Virginia State Legislature. The governor could serve up to three years at a time, and once out of office, could not serve again for four years.[1] The 1830 constitution changed the thrice-renewable one-year term length to a non-renewable three-year term, and set the start date at the first day in January following an election.[2] This constitution also prevented governors from succeeding themselves, a prohibition that exists to the present day.[3] The 1851 Constitution increased terms to four years[4] and made the office elected by the people, rather than the legislature.[5] The commencement of the Governor's term was moved to the first day in February by the 1902 Constitution,[6] and then to the Saturday after the second Wednesday in January by the 1971 and current Constitution.[7]\n\nIf the office of governor is vacant due to death, impeachment and disqualification, or resignation, the lieutenant governor of Virginia becomes governor.[8] The office of lieutenant governor was created in 1851.[9] Prior to that a Council of State existed; it chose from among its members a president who would be \"lieutenant-governor\" and would act as governor when there was a vacancy in that office.[1][10] The governor and the lieutenant governor are elected at the same time but not on the same ticket. Officially, there have been 74 governors of Virginia; the acting governors are not counted."
