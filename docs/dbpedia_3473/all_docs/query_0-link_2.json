        "text": "RouteXpert Review\n\nOn day 12 we drive to Istanbul, there are several options to drive this route, mainly on the highway. We choose to drive in the north via the beautiful city of Kirklaarli, also to give travelers the chance to visit this city again, if it didn't work out on day 11.\n\nIt is only an hour's drive from Edirne to Kirklaarli, so ideal for a morning stroll through the city and visiting the various sites at less busy times. You will find especially beautiful mosques from the Ottoman era, such as the Cedit Ali Pasha Mosque, Hizirbey Mosque, Kadi Mosque, Sokollu Mehmet Pasha Mosque and Beyazit Mosque. These mosques give a nice picture of the different features of Turkish architecture.\n\nYou can also start the day with a visit to an authentic Turkish bath from 1683 in the historic Hızırbey complex, which consists of the mosque of the same name, a hammam (bathhouse) and the Arasta bazaar. The Hızırbey Mosque is located in the center of the city, is built of stone and has a minaret. In 1824 it was renovated by Yusuf Pasha van Aydost. Later, the current prayer place and garden walls of the mosque were built around it.\n\nThe hammam is built in Ottoman style and is located next to the Arasta. The hammam has two entrances: one for men and one for women. According to an inscription in the women's section, it was renovated by Hacı Hüseyin Ağa between 1683 and 1704. The outer walls of the bathhouse are built of rough sandstone. The Arasta is built in a T-shape and has gate-shaped walls. She was renovated in 1704.\n\nIn Kirklaarli you can also enjoy a traditional meal in one of the many restaurants, so ideal for a late breakfast, brunch or lunch.\n\nThe next stop is in the small town of Pınarhisar, on the main road through the center you will find several restaurants and cafes to plan lunch.\n\nThe next village we enter is Vize, here are some nice points to stop briefly to take a few pictures. You will find here, among other things, the Castle of Vize, a ruin of which only a small part of the castle structure still exists. You will find it in the center of Vize. The city walls in the south are about 3-4 m high and are made of large stone blocks. There are two bastions not perpendicular to the walls, one just behind the northwest corner of the bathhouse and the other 100 feet northwest of it, turned slightly south. The bastion has a doorway at the front and back. The door to the street was completely destroyed. Today there is a round-arched entrance to the southeast of the city walls.\n\nThe next photo stop is at the Tiyaro structure, the only known Amphitheater from the Roman period. The building was excavated over three seasons between 1995 and 1997 and represents theaters from Roman times.\n\nIn Saray it is possible to take a break, shop and have a drink in one of the cafes. From Saray we drive towards the coast to enjoy the beautiful winding roads through the beautiful green forests. You can also choose to continue on the D-020 if you want to arrive in Istanbul earlier.\n\nEnd point of this day is Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), a city in the European and Asian part of Turkey and was the capital of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIstanbul may not be the capital of Turkey, but it is the largest and most important city in Turkey! The city offers its visitors many impressive sights such as The Aya Sofya, The Sultan Ahmet Mosque (The Blue Mosque), the Basilica Cistern and the Topkapi Palace. Most sights can be found in the European part of the city, the Asian part is more relaxed and has many parks.\n\nThe Aya Sofya, or the “Hagia Sophia” in Dutch, is one of the ancient Byzantine structures that the city still boasts. The former cathedral and mosque contains both Christian and Islamic elements. The huge dome and walls are beautifully decorated with mosaics depicting Christian images.\n\nThe Sultan Ahmet Mosque (The Blue Mosque) is the most famous mosque in the world and has 6 minarets, an elegant dome, which is finished on the inside with beautiful (partly blue) tiles. This Mosque is still in use and therefore only open for visits during the prayer.\n\nYou can walk on the old city wall. From the Galata Tower you have a beautiful view over the city. Stroll through the Grand Bazaar to get a taste of the Turkish atmosphere.\n\nVisit the underground Basilica Cistern, these water basins used to ensure that fresh drinking water was always available. The cistern is an immense underground space where you can take a short walk between the columns by means of gangways. The space is attractively lit and classical music is played. Carps swim in the water. These carp were released into the water to warn in time if the water was poisoned.\n\nA must is Topkapi Palace, this palace is located in one of the oldest historical regions of Istanbul. Located on the historical peninsula of Istanbul between the Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn. The palace is one of the iconic structures that grace the skyline of Istanbul. Occupying an area of 700,000 square meters on the Eastern Roman Acropolis in Sarayburnu, Topkapi Palace was the administrative, educational and artistic center of the empire of Fatih Sultan Mehmet until the 31st Sultan Abdülmecid for about four hundred years, as well as housing of the dynasty. Although Topkapi Palace was gradually abandoned in the mid-19th century as the dynasty slowly moved to Dolmabahçe Palace, it retained its historical importance and value.\n\nIstanbul is the only city in the world where you are in Europe one moment and in Asia the next. For this you have to cross the Bosphorus, this can be done by metro through the tunnel, via one of the bridges or by ferry. The best thing is to take the ferry to the other side of the Bosphorus, so you can see the beautiful city from the water. You can spend the night in one of the many hotels in the center of the city, everything is easily accessible on foot or by public transport.\n\nThere is too much to list so consider an extra day or two in Istanbul."
