        "text": "On Christmas Eve, with perfectly clear skies, I took the ferry across the Bosphorus to Asia. My plan was to ride out of Istanbul that day, but being already late in the afternoon, and desiring to be somewhere comfortable for Christmas, I decided to stop at a Hostel. There I found a small group of English expats and their friends, and happily whiled away the evening with them sharing Christmas dinner and drinks.\n\nNothing would have persuaded me to leave that Christmas morning, so I had a short walk around Kadikoy in the sunshine, taking in the strangeness of being in a country where it wasn’t really Christmas at all, and spent the rest of the day inside, eating and drinking with my new friends.\n\nI finally set off mid morning (or was it mid afternoon) on boxing day, although the sky had taken on a more threatening hue. A lovely cycle path ran for quite a long way along the Marmara coast, but after it came to an end, and without adequate maps, I soon found myself dealing with huge highways and confusing spaghetti junctions in the dark. The roads didn’t feel particularly dangerous as the traffic was moving so slowly, but it took an extremely frustrating few hours before I found the route towards Izmit. I was still not out of the city, and the best campsite on offer was a patch of grass between two motorways.\n\nIt rained all night and I woke up in a big puddle, with a confused man who was out collecting twigs standing over my tent and pointing at the water shouting “Su!”. He took pity on me and gave me some bread and olives, and I continued on the rain-lashed highway to Izmit. This stretch of road was the worst I experienced in the whole of Turkey, whose roads thereafter I generally found to be some of the best in the world.\n\nThe one comforting thought when cycling through heavy rain without the luxury of anticipating a roof and a warm bed at the end of the day, is that it won’t last. But the weather did not improve, and by the time I reached Izmit several hours later, I had well and truly had enough. Taking shelter in a local internet cafe, in earnest I sent out some messages on the warmshowers service, and waited.\n\nLater that evening I received a reply from Merve, an English teacher in a local school, saying that I was welcome to stay with her and her husband Kagan. They didn’t seem to mind that I resembled a half-drowned animal who’d just been pulled from a river. Kagan patiently helped me arrange my dripping and mud-caked clothes and tent in the corridor of their apartment block, then when they’d said goodbye to some visiting relatives, fed me some leftover dinner.\n\nMerve suggested that instead of having to cycle via Trabzon for the Iranian visa, I leave my things at their place and take the bus there and back, thereby allowing me to take whichever route I choose across Turkey. This seemed like it would save some time and effort, so the following afternoon I embarked on the 16 hour bus journey along the Black Sea coast.\n\nTrabzon (Trebizond to Byzantine historians) is a city which can lay claim to having been at one time the last true bastion of the Roman Empire, resisting the Ottomans for several years after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. But to me, the historical significance of the place was somewhat eclipsed by the extreme anxiety I was now feeling over the Iranian visa situation. What if I was denied? Looking back now it seems rather silly. There are far worse things which could have happened, and a visa refusal at that stage would have simply meant taking a different route into Central Asia, through the Caucasus and across the Caspian Sea.\n\nBut all I could think about at the time was how disappointed I’d be if I wasn’t allowed to visit Iran, a place I’d been determined to go to since the idea of a long bicycle trip first began to take shape in my mind, several years before. It was the main reason I had obtained a New Zealand passport, knowing that British citizens were forbidden to travel there since diplomatic relations between our two countries broke down in 2011.\n\nI made my way straight to the Iranian consulate, from where I began the process of jumping through the various hoops required for an Iranian visa, namely, having photographs taken; filling out forms detailing my family history, exactly where I intended to visit in Iran and when etc.; depositing money into an account at a local bank (I think this was about 80 Euros) and then returning at a specified time in the afternoon.\n\nBut instead of being handed a visa, I was told to return the next day. Just a minor setback, I told myself, and set off in search of the cheapest hotel in Trabzon.\n\n“Your visa is being processed, come back next Monday”, said the bored looking, grumpy consular officer, before waving me out of the room like a fly. I was dismayed. There was no way I could afford to stay at the ‘Bulvar Palas Hotel’ for an entire week, so my only option was to return to Izmit. I’d travelled a thousand kilometres for a piece of paper, and would now have to make the same uncomfortable journey a further three times. The worst part of it was that I still didn’t know whether I would actually get a visa at the end of all this traipsing around.\n\nLuckily I was more than welcome at the home of my new friends in Izmit. By the end of that week I had come to regard Merve, Kagan and their Canadian friend Liz, a teacher at an international school, practically as family, and still do to this day. After bringing in the new year at a fish restaurant on a boat, and embarrassingly underestimating the strength of raki (the aniseed based national spirit of Turkey), I returned to Trabzon.\n\n“Come back at 4 o’ clock”, the same official told me. This game was starting to get a little tiresome! But when I returned this time, my documents were pulled out of the pile of paper they’d been placed in the previous week, and a shiny visa with my photograph on it printed out and pasted into my passport. I had been the only person at that sleepy consulate every time I went there, and I was certain nobody had even glanced at the information I’d painstakingly filled in.\n\nStepping out of the office, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted. I was now free to enter Iran, and didn’t have to return empty handed. I bought a ticket for the next available bus back to Izmit.\n\nWith the Iranian visa off my mind, I was now free to start thinking about the road ahead. But the road ahead was now thickly carpeted with snow, and daily blizzards made travelling anywhere by bicycle almost impossible. The blizzards were so heavy that Liz and Merve’s schools were both closed for most of the next couple of weeks, and we spent the greater part of our days in their cosy apartment with an endlessly boiling tea urn, cooking and eating vast quantities of food and entertaining guests almost nightly.\n\nWith the promise of better weather in the second half of January, and with school holidays approaching, Liz and Merve made a plan for a bike ride deep into the heart of Turkey, and suggested that I join them. There followed multiple trips to sports and camping shops to buy equipment, and many hours poring over maps under the guidance of Merve and her extensive knowledge of the country, until we had a detailed route plan with far more stopovers than anybody could fit into the available two weeks. We planned to get to Tuz Gölü, the saltiest and second largest lake in Turkey.\n\nOn the 23rd of January Merve returned from school in the afternoon, and the three of us set off from Izmit sports centre accompanied by a small group from the local cycling team. The idea of two women embarking on such a trip with a man who was not married to either of them, with the intention of camping in the wild and being at the mercy of complete strangers along the way, was very much a novelty, and our departure had generated some interest.\n\nWe rounded the easternmost bend of the Sea of Marmara and followed its southern coast, arriving at night in the town of karamürsel, where we would have the first in a series of experiences of extraordinary hospitality. As it was too late to safely ride out of town, our first thought was to enquire at the police station whether we could set up camp within their grounds.\n\nBeing too tired to look for anything else, we resigned ourselves the patch of vacant land they showed us to, strewn with stones and stinking rubbish. Before we’d finished pitching our tents we were rescued by a woman who lived nearby, and invited into her small apartment for tea and biscuits. She insisted that we camp in her garden on the comfort of the nice soft soil – an upgrade we were all grateful for. In the morning I was informed I’d slept through a minor earthquake.\n\nWe had breakfast with the kind woman and her son, before heading south to Iznik, still often referred to by its Greek name, Nicaea. It was a beautiful evening as we coasted into the ancient city through acres of olive groves, and camped in the grounds of a rowing club on the shore of Lake Iznik. We could well have been on the very spot where a unified Christian doctrine was first agreed upon under the guidance of the Roman Emperor Constantine in 325, and Christendom as we know it was born (The words crystalised by that First Council of Nicaea are still recited in churches around the world as the Nicene Creed).\n\nThe next morning we took on the first proper hills of our ride. Two stray dogs joined us half way up, and kept us company for several hours before they got bored and turned around.\n\nThe destination for that day was Inegöl, Merve and Kagan’s hometown in the province of Bursa. The reception we received and the supper that Merve and her mother and grandmother prepared when we arrived was worth the effort of the hills, and even having to ride in the darkness on poorly surfaced backroads almost all the way from Yenişehir to Inegöl.\n\nBreakfast was a veritable mountain of bread, cheese, honey, olives, jam and pastry, which was followed by an invite to Kagan’s parents’ house for breakfast number two, just in case we hadn’t had enough. The thought of eating any more was horrifying, but it seems the desire to avoid causing offence can muster great reserves of metabolic energy, because we all managed to find room for it. It was four in the afternoon by the time we felt ready to leave town.\n\nAnatolia is famous for its highly mineralised geo-thermal springs, which for centuries have supplied the hammams – traditional Turkish baths. With the temperature now noticeably cooler, and snow lying in patches along the sides of the highway, these provided a great incentive to keep powering onward, stoically refusing the occasional offers of lifts from truck drivers.\n\nThe water is often drunk for health, and on our way to Eskisehir we passed by the Kinik mineral water bottling plant, where it flows, still hot, out of a pipe installed for passers-by, and we filled our own bottles.\n\nWhen night fell we stopped at the first petrol station we came to, where the night shift worker allowed us to sleep in the restaurant, gave us free chocolate biscuits, sung to Liz, whom he had rather taken a shine to, and implored her to “take me back to Europe with you”. I don’t think he knew where Canada was.\n\nArriving in Eskisehir in the evening after a full day of cycling, we separated to go to the respective women’s and men’s hammam. I tipped an old man a few lira for the privilege of having him beat me almost to a pulp, and met Hafiz and his friends, a group of studious Afghans.\n\nIt sounded like Liz and Merve were rather bewildered by their experience. Merve covered her embarrassment by pretending not to understand Turkish, and translated to Liz all the comments that were made about them by the other women!\n\nWe stayed with Gokhan, our host from Warmshowers, and before setting off in the morning we had tea with Hafiz, who gave us an erudite tour of the Mosque complex and spoke passionately of Afghanistan.\n\nThings at this point started to get more difficult, as we headed off the main highway in search of a village we intended to reach that night. After asking several people for directions, we arrived at the wrong village, which was a dead end.\n\nBy now it was getting dark, and we were riding on churned up mud and thick snow. From the top of a hill we could see our village, on the other side of a river. A small, treacherous looking path led down the other side of the hill into some woods, and Merve was adamant that it would take us where we wanted to go. I thought it was just wishful thinking, but not having any options other than to turn back to Eskisehir, we pressed onwards.\n\nThankfully Merve’s instinct proved good, and an hour or two later we were sitting, caked in mud, in the village teahouse. The proprietor took pity on us, and invited us next door where his wife gave us some supper.\n\nThis was the first time I came across the Turkish concept of ‘Kismet’ – that it absolutely wasn’t an inconvenience or a burden for her to provide us with supper because our share of the food had already been allocated to us before anybody knew we were coming, and God had provided enough for everybody. This, I think, forms the basis of the hospitality that travellers commonly experience throughout the Muslim world.\n\nA guest room was then prepared next to the village mosque. We felt well in need of rest, despite having only travelled 24 kilometres that day, and quickly went to sleep in front of the wood stove.\n\nIn the morning we had a huge breakfast with the mosque caretaker, and the keeper of the village hammam unlocked it so that we could have a look. When we asked if we could take some of the mineral water away in our bottles, they were snatched up by the keeper’s half blind wife, who shuffled along a precarious, slippery ledge to fill them.\n\nOn the way to Kutahya we were delayed for a while as Merve fell ill, and an old lady in the nearest village had to be called for to administer her medicine. She recovered quickly, and we reached the city in the evening.\n\nThe local municipal club permitted us to camp in their grounds, but as we were setting up we received an invitation from Teren, an American teacher whom Merve had contacted earlier.\n\nWe left our bikes at Teren’s the next day, and took a detour by bus to Çavdarhisar – site of the ancient Phrygian city of Aizoni .\n\nThe city is one of the best preserved and most impressive sites of antiquity I have ever seen, and we found it almost deserted. Most of the city dates from the Roman period, and the original Roman bridge is still in use today. The incredible scale of the ruins makes an odd comparison with the rather unremarkable village that has grown up alongside them.\n\nWe spent such a long time walking around, contemplating the different archeological sites and imagining the people who would have frequented the bath house and hippodrome, that we missed the last bus and had to hitch-hike back to Kutahya.\n\nLeaving Kutahya was quite a slow and painful experience. Merve’s bike had a puncture on the ride out, and in my hurry to fix it in the freezing cold I forgot to check the tyre for debris, and it happened again a kilometre down the road.\n\nThen the wind started. It came on so strongly that Merve and Liz were forced to get off and walk their bikes, while I rode on ahead to look for a petrol station or any kind of shelter.\n\nThe petrol station was some distance away, and when we reached it we found it was inhabited by an attendant who seemed to live a hermit’s life there on his own. He was obviously grateful for company, as our request for tea was met with an invitation to stay the night.\n\nLater a taxi appeared driven by his friend, who was offering to drive us for free to the hammam at Gazligol, at least forty kilometres away. It seemed odd that someone would go to all that trouble just out of kindness to three complete strangers, but they seemed nice and we didn’t see any reason to doubt their sincerity.\n\nOn our return their was a huge takeaway meal from the local restaurant waiting for us, which neither of the men would accept any payment for. I did notice that Merve seemed to become rather uncomfortable, and made haste to get away as early as possible in the morning. It was only later that Merve explained that these two men had made increasingly lewd remarks, and had made it clear that they were in fact expecting some form of payment from the girls for their generosity.\n\nIt put a very negative spin on the whole experience, but it also instilled in me a renewed sense of respect for women who travel like this on their own, for whom this sort of thing must be a regular occurrence.\n\nThe wind raged even more fiercely than on the previous day, and Liz and Merve hitched a lift to Afyon in a truck. I made the foolhardy decision to try and ride there, and was battered mercilessly for fifteen kilometres.\n\nSeveral times I was blown into the road, and riding on the other side of the road was even worse. I managed to struggle to the next petrol station, where I tried to get on a minibus, but they were all full and had no room for a bicycle. Dejectedly I continued on, until I reached a hill and my bike ground to a halt.\n\nOne of the previous crashes had bent my derailleur hanger, and when I tried to change gear the derailleur had fed itself into my rear wheel, destroying itself (but remarkably not breaking any spokes)\n\nThere was something particularly disheartening about being alone at the side of a highway in a gale, forty kilometres from the nearest settlement, with no shelter and a broken bike, when I could have been with my friends in a cosy tea house in Afyon.\n\nMy efforts to hail trucks proved in vain, and it was nearly two hours before a wonderful couple in a small car stopped and took me the rest of the way to Afyon, with my bike sticking out of the boot and my front wheel on my lap, despite it being in the opposite direction to where they were going.\n\nMeeting Liz and Merve I was almost overwhelmed with emotion, even though we’d only been separated a few hours. On the news that evening we heard that people had been killed by collapsing buildings, and in Istanbul over a hundred vehicles had been blown into the Bosphorus.\n\nWe checked into a cheap hotel, and the following day was dedicated to seeing the city of Afyon and fixing my bike. A mechanic at the market bent my frame back into place with a wrench, and after asking around a bit we eventually found a bike shop with the right sort of derailleur.\n\nWe climbed up the hill to watch the sunset from the ramparts of Afyon Castle, before returning to a nice tea house we’d visited earlier. The owners of the tea house gave us a place to sleep in an abandoned butcher’s shop next door.\n\nThe weather was beautiful the morning we left Afyon, and there was hardly any traffic on the roads. There were mountains in the distance which we used as landmarks to spur us on, and we’d cleared just under a hundred kilometres by the end of the day.\n\nWe slept in a beautiful hammam in Akşehir, among columns which appeared to be supported by ancient Roman capitals, and were on the road again before sunrise.\n\nThe weather was beautiful the morning we left Afyon, and there was hardly any traffic on the roads.

The town was interesting as well, with a huge caravanserai complex which still functioned as a market and restaurants. In the evening we finally drank the can of beer I’d found on the road out of Izmit.\n\nThe next day we had more brilliant riding, on quiet, undulating roads which reminded Liz of Canada. We came into Dedeler in the evening, where we were met by some lovely people who gave us a room full of cushions to sleep in, and presented us with gifts of ‘Mevlana şeker’, a very sweet local confection made with rose water.\n\nWe’d finally reached our last day of cycling together, and had just a short distance to go to Tuz Gölü. We had time to stop for a while in the town of Cihanbeyli, and for Merve to get one last puncture.\n\nWe planned to just pitch our tents on the shore of the lake, but as it happened there was no public access. There was however a security guard on site, as well as a large litter of security puppies, and we were welcomed into the guard house for tea and bread.\n\nThere was an option of sleeping inside, but we’d only camped out twice on the whole trip so far, and were insistent, so put our tents up as close to the lake as we could get.\n\nWe didn’t catch our first glimpse of the magnificent, shimmering white surface of the lake until morning. It had the surreal quality of there not appearing to be any definite boundary between water and sky, and there were salty deposits all along the shoreline.\n\nAfter breakfast we were taken out in the back of a pickup truck for a tour, which was a beautiful last experience to share, before riding back to Cihanbeyli so Liz and Merve could catch their bus back to Izmit.\n\nWe said our goodbyes at the bus station, and then I was alone again, for the first time in what felt like an age.\n\nRiding my fully loaded bike again felt like a reunion with a missed friend. The first few days after leaving Sofia were lonely, but it hardly mattered as it was so liberating to be on the open road in this mountainous landscape, heading towards an unknown destination. On the second day the only two people I spoke to were a drunk old man in Pirdop and a surly village shopkeeper.\n\nAfter one long descent I heard a ‘ping’ which filled me with horror – a broken spoke, which I’d never had to deal with on my own bike. As it happened it was an easy replacement using my ‘NBT2′ tool – a small but ingenious piece of metal which does away with the need to carry a chain whip, lockring remover and large spanner on a cycle tour.\n\nThe weather in these early days was cold but not unpleasant, with light rain overnight that cleared by morning. This wasn’t to last long.\n\nAfter Gabrevo I took a turn off for Shipka, and passed through some villages where Roma horses and traps were almost the only vehicular transport. Shipka Monastery was difficult to find in the fog, but was suddenly revealed as the veil lifted; an incongruous apparition of magnificent Russian domes above a ramshackle collection of roofs.\n\nOne of the places I really wanted to see was Buzludzha – a conference hall built in 1981 by the communist government of Bulgaria. Its remote, high altitude location is due to its commemorative function, marking the spot where the first meetings of Bulgarian communists were held in secret in the late 19th Century.\n\nIt was late when I arrived at the turn off that leads to the pass, so I camped in the shadow of the mountains, and began ascending in the morning after waiting for the rain to stop. The first few switchbacks were no trouble, but as the road climbed higher the temperature dropped dramatically, and the fog became so thick that trucks and workmen ten meters ahead were invisible. Everything it touched became coated in a layer of ice, and the water in my bottles was frozen solid.\n\nAs I could see almost nothing I began to worry that I wouldn’t find it, but blind faith kept me pedalling towards the top where I eventually found some concrete steps, and out of the grey oblivion the great concrete ‘UFO’ was suddenly on top of me.\n\nThe main entrance has long been chained and bolted shut, but around the side there is a small square hole that you can climb through to gain access to the building. With the wind howling mournfully around the perimeter corridor, causing icicles to grow out at swept angles from the mosaic fragments of heroic socialist modernism, and the giant hammer and sickle’s golden radience offset by the cold light filtering through the decaying canopy of the central hall, this is truly one of the most profoundly desolate and astounding places on Earth.\n\nI exited to find my bike completely encased in ice, and embarked on the hair-raising descent, only stopping at a hotel bar half way down for a warming glass of rakia.\n\nDown in Kazanluk I was just beginning to despair of the lack of affordable accommodation when I was approached by a fellow cyclist named Todor, who offered me his flat for the evening. This act of kindness from a complete stranger was a godsend as I really did need somewhere to warm up and dry out my wet things.\n\nEverything was soaked again within half an hour the following morning, and I spent all day riding into fog and endless, miserable drizzle. A huge storm battered my campsite near Radevo, and my bike was blown over into my tent. I don’t think I slept for fear that the whole thing was going to be uprooted, leaving me exposed to the elements.\n\nOn my final night in Bulgaria I thought I was being very clever by angling the narrowest part of the tent into the wind. But I didn’t think to make sure my camp was on high ground, and woke up in the night to find myself lying in several inches of water. I had to get out and drag the tent through the mud.\n\nTurkey lay just beyond the town of Elhovo, and I cycled happily past the four kilometer queue of lorries waiting to cross the border. My passport caused some confusion on the Bulgarian side, and I had to explain that I was a British citizen but needed a stamp in my New Zealand passport, which I would be using from then on for visa purposes. On the Turkish side I was simply given a stamp and waved off, no questions asked.\n\nIn my keenness to get to Edirne before dark, I disregarded the advice a friend had given me to stick to the main road and not be tempted by the shortcut a little way after the border. For about twenty kilometers I sped through the undulating Thracian landscape on almost traffic free roads until sure enough, the path was blocked by some men in a 4×4 who refused to let me continue. At that point I realised that I couldn’t speak a single word of Turkish, but before I’d had time to think about it my bike was being loaded onto the back of a pickup truck, and from the quiet village lanes I was suddenly deposited in a chaotic Turkish city at dusk, with the call to prayer at full blast. Exciting and daunting in equal measure.\n\nMy hosts in Edirne were Engin and his brother Osman, who with their business partner Tamer run the Trakya Bisiklet shop, which sells all manner of cycle touring equipment, including the full range of Brooks saddles. They were great company and insisted that I stay with them until the rain eased off, so I took three nights to rest and do a little sightseeing.\n\nThe crowning glory of Edirne is the Selimiye mosque, believed by many to represent the pinnacle of Ottoman architecture. Its triumph is the central dome, which appears to be almost unsupported, and unlike that of the Sultanahmet (Blue) mosque in Istanbul, allows the mihrab to be viewed from anywhere in the building. Its architect, Mimar Sinan, considered it his masterpiece, and it was his desire that all who entered would feel simultaneously the majesty of God and an overall sense of peace and reflection. Looking up at the softly illuminated canopy of blue and gold caligraphic tiles, my impression was that he succeeded.\n\nThe Sun was shining on my way out of Edirne, but it wasn’t long before the rain started again. Tamer had given me a contact in Kirklareli, whom I was unable to reach, but when I came out of the internet cafe I found a note on my bicycle from Tilly and Christian, a German couple who were on a year long cycle tour of Europe. I joined them at the camping spot they’d found a few kilometers outside town, and the next day we set off together.\n\nThere was barely any let up in the weather between there and Istanbul, and each passing truck blasted us with a thousand painful needles of spray. Sometimes the wind was so strong that as Tilly pointed out, it was ‘more like fighting than cycling’.\n\nIt was made up for by the hospitality we experienced though. In Vize we were invited into a tea house where we spent several hours eating and drinking, before sleeping (or trying to – I’d probably consumed more caffeine in one afternoon than the average Englishman does in a year) at the house of Serkan, who had to go to a friend’s wedding but had a huge order of pide (a sort of Turkish pizza) sent to us.\n\nOn the second night we were allowed to sleep in a village tea house, with a wood-fired stove burning all night. They weren’t in the slightest bit concerned about whether or not these three muddy travellers were trustworthy, and even left a pile of cash on the counter.\n\nOnly on the night before we arrived in the city did we have to camp, which we did on a secluded hill we found above the suburb of Göktürk. We were kept awake all night by dogs, who stole my bread and my mug, which Christian found in the morning, fifty meters from our campsite.\n\nTilly and Christian had no map, and so having done some preliminary research I’d insisted we take the supposedly quiet D020 road instead of the D100 highway. In hindsight this was probably a mistake – since the reports I’d read had been written the volume of traffic on that road has increased massively, but only part of it has been widened, meaning that for most of the time we were dealing with close passes from lorries in both directions every few minutes.\n\nThe very worst sections of road were those that were still under construction. By the time we’d traversed these few kilometers of churned up mud we looked like we’d been engaged in trench warfare for a month, and were very grateful to find someone with a hosepipe!\n\nThere is a very simple way to avoid the dreaded highways which enter Istanbul from the west and the north, and that is to take a turn-off at Kemmerburgaz. Having done that, we were on a blissfully quiet road through a forest, with a few short, steep climbs. At the junction in Bahçeköy you turn right and pass through the aqueduct, then coast downhill all the way to the Bosphorus.\n\nRacing along the empty promenade on a rainy evening, with all the lights of the shipping and the Asian side reflected in the smooth flagstones beneath our tyres, felt like the best and most romantic possible way to be coming into Istanbul, an auspicious entry which we all savoured every moment of.\n\nAs we were leaving a bike shop we’d stopped at, a woman approached us to ask if we had a place to stay. She’d cycled to Southeast Asia via Tibet with her husband a few years ago, and they were both keen to help any bedraggled looking cyclists who turned up in their now-home city. And so it was that we spent our first two nights in Istanbul, drinking beautiful wine and exchanging bicycle touring stories in the comfortable apartment of Janneke and Marteen.\n\nAs this is supposed to be a journal about cycling, I will try to just mention here some of the highlights of the time I spent off the bike between September and November. During the first ten days in Sofia while Alexandra was still with me we stayed with some really great people, so many thanks to Mihail, Stefan, Georgi and Boyan.\n\nMy fondest memories of that period include the night time salsa and tango parties at the Soviet Army monument; a spontaneous drive to the Black Sea resort of Primorsko where we spent a couple of days and nights loafing with Ruen and Alissa, a lovely couple we’d met at the birthday party of one of Mihail’s neighbours; the festivals we were taken to by Mihail, a conoisseur of Bulgarian folk culture; spending time with Lauriane, Alexandra’s friend from university who’d flown out to visit her (perhaps the funniest person I have ever met); meeting Ileana, with whom we spent some pleasant evenings drinking beer; meeting Mitko, a fellow cyclist and traveller who showed us around and took us to some fantastic places including the flea market and the Museum of Socialist Art; ‘Ale House’, a pub serving delicious English style beer that you can pour yourself from taps mounted on the walls; and going on the Sofia green bike tour led by Georgi, an expert tour guide who ended up hosting us and whose room I rented while he was trekking across Nepal.\n\nOn the last day before Alexandra was due to return to Switzerland by bus, we parked our bikes at the foot of Vitosha Mountain and went on a hike up to the old cable car terminal. This isn’t the highest peak but the view from there was breathtaking, and we could see the whole of Sofia with the landmark of the Nevski cathedral discernable as a tiny speck of gold. On the way back we stoped at the Boyana church, a humble little building, part of which is is over a thousand years old and contains what is possibly the most impressive and complete cycle of frescoes in the orthodox world. We were told that we were too late to buy a ticket for entry, but the kind woman who was supervising visitors to the church allowed us in free of charge for a brief glimpse of this miniature wonder.\n\nAfter Alexandra left I joined Georgi and his friend Sveta in hitch hiking to the tiny village of Stara Kresna, near the Pirin mountain, where we spent a couple of days walking and bathing in the natural thermal springs there. In the next week and a half we saw a very bleak outdoor staging of Macbeth, went to the Maimunarnika with Ileana for the premier of Higher, a film about an epic snowboarding expedition in the Himalayas, attended a ‘3d mapping’ show at lake Pancarevo, and went foraging in the hills.\n\nWhen the possibility of earning some money by picking grapes in Switzerland was suggested I didn’t need much persuasion. The only cheap flight to Geneva was from Belgrade, so I bought a ticket for the overnight train from Sofia. The day before I was due to leave I lost my bank card and so had no access to any money whatsoever. I knew the journey would take well over twenty four hours and so I gathered together what I could, which was a bag of stale bread, some bananas and three boiled onions.\n\nThe conservation of these meagre rations proved easier than expected, as good fortune placed me in a compartment occupied by a gypsy family, who plied me with enough food to satisfy even the most voracious appetite.\n\nAt the border the train stopped for what seemed like hours. First the Bulgarian border police came on board entered the compartment several times to scrutinise passports and shine their torches around suspiciously. Then it was the turn of the Serb ‘Militaria’, whose approach seemed to be taken straight from the Gestapo handbook. In full-frontal glare of torch light we were questioned in turn about destination and reason for travel, and then gruffly ordered to leave the compartment and line up in the corridor. All the passports were taken away for closer inspection (except mine, which was handed back to me when they realised, with some bewilderment, that I was British) while a guard searched the compartment. After finding nothing under the seats or in the upholstery, he threw all the luggage from the overhead racks onto the floor, climbed up, and with a large screwdriver began removing panels so that he could hoist himself into the ceiling cavity. We’d just finished putting our luggage back and returned to our seats when another guard came in and made us take everything down again for more searches.\n\nAt this point I felt rather sorry for my protesting co-passengers as they were forced to open every one of their many bags of clothes, cooking equipment and potatoes, but they seemed to take the whole thing with good humour and I supposed that they were used to this sort of treatment.\n\nGlancing up and down the carriage I saw that nobody else was subjected to this indignity, but it was hardly surprising given the almost universal hatred and distrust of the Roma that I’d encountered in the Balkans, where even the students and in most other respects liberal-minded youth seem unable to shake off the prejudices of over eight hundred years. In light of the countless warnings I’d received against these poor people whom I’d found to be kind and generous, it was difficult not to feel a sense of terrible injustice.\n\nJust before dawn the train rattled into Belgrade, and once again I found myself riding the busses without a ticket (although this time without any money to hand in case of the appearance of an inspector).\n\nI got to the airport unhindered, and by early afternoon was in Geneva. From there it was necessary to hitch hike. By the time dusk was approaching I’d only had one lift and had been walking for several hours, still over forty kilometers from Lausanne. I was eventually saved from a very cold night on the shores of Lac Leman by the goodwill a passing motorist, who could not take me all the way to my destination but insisted on giving me some money for a train.\n\nFinally in Lausanne, I was met by Alexandra and we had a lovely supper with Lauriane. We spent the Sunday loafing in parks and wandering around this delightful town, and then it was time to look for work. A Monday spent riding up and down the steep lakeside slopes on a borrowed bicycle yieided nothing – the harvest was nearly finished and none of the vineyards needed any more vendageurs.\n\nSo on Tuesday I crossed the country using lifts from passers-by, one police car and a couple of trains, ending up in Malans, Alexandra’s home village in the Grisons. I spent about two weeks in this beautiful place, nestled in the Alps and close to the source of the Rhine, picking grapes in the sunshine and on down days exploring the area by bicycle and on foot.\n\nI mostly worked on the vineyard of the Boner family, who were wonderful and provided all their pickers with plenty of wine and good food during lunch stops. At the end of each day there would be more eating and drinking and I’d ride on the back of the tractor to the winery to tip all the grapes into the crusher.\n\nI was staying with Alexandra’s parents, who also own a small vineyard. The day we harvested it was like a celebration, and all their friends and family turned out to help, including Alexandra who came down from Lausanne for the weekend. On my last two days in the Grisons Alexandra came down again and we went hiking in the mountains. We took the ‘Alpibahn’ up and walked for a few hours, before making a fire and sleeping in the open, surrounded by jagged peaks and pine forests.\n\nWith the harvest finished I returned to Lausanne, where I spent another week before finally saying goodbye to Alexandra and embarking on the overland journey back to Sofia. On the way I stopped in Brno and spent a lovely few days with my friend Emily, who was travelling around Europe at the time.\n\nWe sat in cosy bars and drank lots of grog, gazed down on a small sea of sloping red tiled roofs and baroque steeples from the top of the Habsburg monarchy’s most notorious prison, and came face to face with thousands of skulls in an Ossuary that is second only to the catacoombs of Paris in scale.\n\nBrno happens to be an ancestral home of my family, and so after Emily had left I decided to do a bit of investigation. I had very little information to go on, but I visited the Jewish Cemetary, where I managed to find a grave belonging to my great grandparents, Oto (Ota) and Mimi Weiss.\n\nBack in Sofia I came to the decision that I would rather continue travelling east than try to find work there, so I made preparations for cycling during the winter, and on the 27th of November I rode out of the city.\n\nAfter a comfortable night at Jurgen and Vibeka’s we were invited to stay with Alexandra’s friend Milos and his family for the weekend. Armed with some scribbled directions, we put our lives at the mercy of Belgrade’s traffic, and very nearly lost them. By the time we realised quite how bad an idea it was to cycle on these unlit dual-carriageways at night, it was too late and there was no way to turn back. As each passing lorry further reduced my capacity for rational thought I began shouting things like “We have about a fifty per cent chance of survival!”, which didn’t help either of us.\n\nWe were both relieved to arrive at our destination intact, and agreed that we should leave the bikes in the shed and use public transport for a while. A funny thing about public transport in Belgrade is that they seem to actively discourage people from paying for it. We did try to buy bus tickets on our first morning there, but it was so complicated (tickets can only be bought in multiples of three, on the last Tuesday of the month, if it’s a waning moon etc.) that we gave up.\n\nSaturday was spent talking, eating food cooked by Milos’ mother, listening to Serbian music and doing our laundry. In the evening we ventured back into Belgrade using the city’s free bus and tram network, and insisted, despite his protests that there were plently of better things to do, that Milos take us to the beer festival (‘the biggest in Southeastern Europe’). My high expectations were based on the beer festivals of Kent and Sussex, but the only thing this had in common with those was lots of drunk people. Disappointingly there was no great variety of local and exotic beers to taste, just various bars sponsored by the big brewers and international drinks companies. Nonetheless it was enough of a good time to keep us from returning home until about eight the following morning, and we slept well into the afternoon.\n\nSunday followed a similar pattern, with Milos showing us his favourite places in Belgrade by night, and on Monday morning it was time to say goodbye to three generations of a family who’d looked after us as though we were their kin. The road into the city wasn’t nearly as bad in the light of day, and there was just time to have a look at the Cathedral of Sveti Sava (the world’s biggest Orthodox church – very impressive from the outside but currently resembling a building site within) before our arranged meeting with Jon and Faustine.\n\nThe road out of the other side of Belgrade was very busy and unpleasant, but we were on it for a mercifully short time before we found the turn off leading to a dirt path roughly following the river. We set as the day’s target Smederevo, where Milos’ sister Jelena had told us there was an old fortress. After lunch and a snooze in Pančevo the track became very rough, and as evening drew in it was necessary to keep moving to avoid being a sitting target for the mosquitos.\n\nThere was a loud crash from up ahead as Jon ploughed straight into the back of Alexandra, smashing her mudguard and rear dynamo light to bits. I wish somebody had been there to film the sidesplitting spectacle of us enveloped in a cloud of mosquitos, frantically scrabbling around for all the pieces.\n\nEventually the medieval ramparts of Smederevo penetrated the darkness, shrouded in a ghostly mist. We set up our camp within the complex and cooked supper on the old walls overlooking the Danube. I would never normally sleep so close to the centre of a town but it felt quite secure here; several people walked past during the night but no one disturbed us.\n\nIn the morning Alexandra and I planned to look for a bike shop, and would try to catch up with Jon and Faustine later. Usually Alexandra could bodge ingenious repairs (quite a frequent necessity as most of her equipment had been handed down to her by her grandfather), but this was beyond even her Swiss resourcefulness. Additionally her spokes, which we’d replaced most recently in Novi Sad, were breaking again.\n\nAt the tourist information office a man called Sacha kindly offered to take us to the bike shop. Outside the ramshackle little workshop, among the tools and old bike parts that were strewn across the pavement, sat the mechanic, known only as ‘Maestro’. He spoke no English, but Sacha stayed to translate for us. The maestro’s eyes seemed to light up with excitement as he talked, telling us that yes, he could do all the necessary repairs, but that Serb hospitality forbade him from accepting any payment for the work, and he would get very angry if we offered!\n\nWhile he tinkered we went to have breakfast, and pondered how we would thank him. With my extremely limited Serbian I’d gathered from what he’d told me, and from the various pictures and newspaper articles he’d pointed at, that he had once won a prize for drinking a kilogramme of honey in two minutes. So we bought him a big pot of the stuff, which he immediately started drinking in front of us before darting into his workshop to unearth gifts to give us, including badges, watches and an old exhibition catalogue!\n\nThis gift exchange could have gone on indefinitely, so we decided to let the Maestro have the last word. Using the art of mime I enquired of him where I could get a haircut, and was led up the road to the local barber. Miroslav and his two friends were a merry bunch and I don’t think I’ve ever been told so many jokes in one sitting. Not all of them made sense but it was a very amusing experience. At the end he flatly refused the money I offered, instead bringing out a bottle of slivovice and four glasses!\n\nWith about half of the day remaining, we thought we could easily make it to Golubac by the evening. Riding out of town, the irresistable sound of gypsy brass came drifting over the rooftops. There was something exotic and exciting about this music, and we began circling around to locate its source. On the other side of the railway tracks a raucous party was in full swing, and its revellers were beckoning at us to join them. We couldn’t refuse, and reasoned that if we just had one or two drinks with them, we would still make it to Golubac.\n\nThe band had been hired by the host to celebrate his wife’s pregnancy, although in reality it could have been anything as the Serbs love a party and will give any excuse for one. To English eyes they are fantastically unreserved, and no amount of hugging or dancing is off-limits. Toasts every few minutes were either to the prosperity of the host or to each other or to Serbia (and occasionally to the reclamation of Kosovo, one of the less savoury but deeply ingrained aspects of the Serb national psyche), and empty glasses barely hit the table before they were refilled with slivovice. Needless to say we were in no fit state to cycle anywhere by the time we left several hours later, and after stumbling around a bit in the river we camped in exactly the same spot as we had done the previous night.\n\nIn the morning we finally left Smederevo and crossed the Danube again. It was very hot and for a long time the only people we saw were shepherds. A few times the raised bank we were cycling on was blocked by huge steel pipes, forcing us down into the fields below. When we stopped for lunch Alexandra removed the stitches in my chin, making me one of the first real patients of her medical career!\n\nThis dusty path went on for what seemed like forever before we reached the port of Bačka Palanka, for the ferry across the river to Ram. From there we were on tarmac roads again, and at dusk found ourselves in the town of Veliko Gradište. We found an abandoned, half-built house (a common sight in Serbia), and slept, no need for tents.\n\nIt didn’t take long to reach Golubac the next day, where the many-tiered fortress climbs a rocky precipice. We scrambled to its highest battlements, which didn’t seem at all safe but Alexandra was determined. From the top the vista of the Iron Gates opened out before us; a gorge that winds its way southeast for over a hundred kilometers, hemmed in by the edge of the Balkan Mountains on the Serbian side and the Carpathians in Romania. Before the hydroelectric dams tamed it this was the most dangerous stretch of the Danube, and beneath its now calm waters lie the wrecks of countless merchant ships, doomed by rocks and swirling currents.\n\nThe road became more and more scenic as it climbed steadily, passing through twenty or so unlit tunnels. Some of these were almost a kilometer in length, and we were lucky to avoid sharing them with any other vehicles. Eventually a Eurovelo route marker took us onto a less travelled path, which saw us fording streams and pushing our bikes across a trail of scree.\n\nOne final big climb and we were swooping down into Doni Milanovac. We crossed the Porečka, a tributary of the Danube, and decided to end the day near the village of Golubinje, laying our sleeping mats on the porch of a disused fishing hut.\n\nIt turned out that Jon and Faustine had camped less than a kilometer ahead of us, and we caught up with them between the last of the tunnels at some point in the afternoon. A little way past the first Iron Gates dam we stopped to eat and swim, and as we sat poring over maps the question arose of which route to take to Bulgaria. Jon and Faustine were set on the more direct way, remaining on the Serbian side through Kladovo, but the hills of Romania seemed to be calling out to us from the opposite bank, and the decision was made.\n\nAs we were packing up an old lady and her granddaughters came out and brought us palačinke (pancakes filled with chocolate) and coffee; a last good experience of Serbia before we turned back towards the dam and the Romanian border.\n\nMy time in Budapest was rather chaotic and I didn’t stay in the same place for more than one night. On the first evening I’d been offered a place to sleep by a warmshowers.org member called Alexandra, but I got so completely lost trying to find her house that it was well past midnight by the time I arrived. I was very grateful that she was still awake and didn’t seem to mind my turning up at such an unsociable hour, as I really had started to think I’d have to find somewhere to pitch my tent.\n\nOn the second day when I’d finished trawling the bookshops for maps, I was drawn into the Ethnographic Museum by a temporary exhibition of bicycles and the history of Budapest’s cycling culture. The exhibition was excellent, but the rest of the museum was also very impressive, focussing on the on the rich folk traditions and customs of Hungarian peasant life. Also on display was the museum’s huge collection of ‘Miska’ jugs, charming characatured hussars which are thought by many to be the origin of the English toby jug.\n\nLater I met Anna, a bright and eloquent tour guide who talked with passion about the struggle for identity faced by Hungarians and others living in post-communist nations. From the top of the hill of Buda, with the city and the lights of many bridges shimmering in the Danube below us, and with plenty of Hungarian wine, this all took on a particular melancholic poignance.\n\nAt some point that night I fell off my bike and sustained a wound to my chin, which I did not think was particularly serious until I visited Sego and Laelia the next day and was told that it was enough of a gash to require stitching. By an almost unbelieveable stroke of luck it turned out that not only was Laelia a doctor, but that she had needles and thread and was able to do the task on the spot. It made a bit of a mess of their host’s sofa covers, which we did manage to make good with a bit of scrubbing, although it must have been a bit of a shock for poor Jani when he returned home. In spite of this, he very kindly let me spend the night at his flat, which – along with Jon and Faustine, a friendly and extremely laid back Anglo-French couple – was by now becoming rather crowded!\n\nIn the morning we waved goodbye to Jani and left Budapest, a jolly group of three French and two English cyclists. Sego and Laelia had ridden on ahead after lunch, and after some sliding around in the mud we found them at an idyllic riverside meadow where they, as well as a large group of Hungarians, had decided to camp.\n\nA little later two more cyclists appeared: Ritchie, an Englishman en route to Tokyo, and Alexandra, a Swiss student of medicine who hoped to reach Istanbul but really wasn’t in much of a hurry. The Hungarians broke the ice by offering us palinka, the lethal homemade spirit, and I don’t remember much after that except for waking up, still under its effect.\n\nSego and Laelia left early (I imagine they’d had enough of the English by that point), and Jon looked like he would need most of the day to recover, so I set off with Ritchie and Alexandra, leaving him in Faustine’s care. After a short and pleasant day’s ride we came to rest at a quiet picnic spot near the village of Ordas. It quickly became apparent that Alexandra was the most resourceful member of the group, and had built a roaring fire and begun cooking supper while Ritchie and I were fiddling about with our petrol stoves.\n\nSomewhere along the excellent traffic free paths the following day a loud pinging noise indicated that two of Alexandra’s spokes had broken. This was hardly surprising, given the amount of luggage that was piled up over her rear wheel (including an iron grill, several cooking pots, a full size track pump and as I found out several weeks later, an enormous hardback volume on medicinal plants), but the objective of the day was now to find a mechanic.\n\nBaja was not kind to us; I dislocated my shoulder helping Ritchie heave his monstrously heavy machine up a bank, and all three of the bike shops there were closed. Alexandra’s wheel would have to wait, so we continued at a careful pace along the gravel path to Mohacs, where one can choose between taking a ferry straight to Croatia on the other side of the river, or continuing a further twenty odd kilometers to Serbia.\n\nWe’d decided on the latter, and as we were setting off towards the border Sego and Laelia appeared, accompanied by a couple of other cyclists. They were taking the ferry, but donated some spare spokes before we parted ways again.\n\nWe thought it would be easy to find a place to camp along this quiet path, but were proved wrong. The woods closest to the river were swarming with mosquitoes, and there was a worrying abundance of wild boar tracks. A sighting of some of these beasts, probing the scrub with their lethal tusks, as well as a hunter on a moped, with bow and a quiver of arrows on his back, confirmed that we would not be sleeping there.\n\nWe continued to Homorud, where it seemed that most of the village came out to assist us. A man called Franz said we could put our tents up in his garden, and before long the four of us (we’d been joined by Thomas, a cyclist from Switzerland who’d defected from the French group) were invited into the house to dine with him and his wife. Heaps of food were brought out from the kitchen, and glass after glass of palinka were clinked to cries of “egészségedre!”\n\nIt’s never too early for palinka in Hungary, and we were sent off in the morning with a few hearty draughts. We soon reached the border, where I showed my passport for the first time since Dover, but this first experience of Serbia was short lived as we’d crossed into Croatia within a couple of hours. For a long time we saw no one and barely a hint of civilisation, pursued along the dusty path in the searing heat by vicious horse flies. The eventual appearence of a bar felt like a godsend as we’d all run out of water, and we met a nice German family living in Belgrade, who invited us to stay at their house.\n\nArriving in Osijek we joined thousands of Croatians swimming in the Drava and basking in the evening sunshine. Alexandra and I decided this would be a good place to stop, as the repair Ritchie had effected on her wheel hadn’t held and we’d be able to find a bike shop in the morning. Ritchie and Thomas were keen to cover more distance, so we said our goodbyes.\n\nWe were anxious about camping in this area as we’d been warned not to do so because of the danger of landmines (their locations could not be known as they were likely to have been scattered by the floods). Neither of us was prepared to try our luck, so we slept under the shelter of the war memorial, a little way out of the town centre.\n\nBy lunchtime the following day Alexandra’s wheel was once more fully spoked and running true, and we were on our way to Vukovar. The road was punctuated with the remains of bombed houses; sad reminders of the events of not so long ago. Speaking to locals in both Croatia and Serbia the fragility of the current peace is apparent. Foreign intervention had ended the war but many issues were never resolved, and the bitterness is still very close to the surface.\n\nVukovar is the city that bears the scars of battle and subsequent deprivation most conspicuously. The huge concrete water tower, badly damaged by mortars, stands as a permanent memorial, and ruins abound on every street, yet to be demolished. The darkest moment of the Yugoslav conflict occured here in 1991, when hundreds of civilians were led from the hospital to a farm outside town and murdered. In the cemetery near the site solemn rows of white crosses face a fractured metal ediface with a fire at its centre, continously burning both in memory of the dead and as a defiant assertion of hard won independence.\n\nOn the way into town we’d spied Martin, a German cycling ninja, dressed head to toe in black lycra despite the heat. There was a comical stand off as we tried to persuade him to camp with us on the beach, while he extolled the economic benefits of sharing a hotel room. We just about won him over, but it was the mosquitoes that drove him indoors. We did meet again on the road the next day, but our leisurely pace (or perhaps the Balkan folk music blaring out of my radio) must have irritated him because at the first hill he shot off like a rocket, and that was the last we saw of Martin.\n\nWe stopped at a vineyard to buy some wine, and when we emerged from the shade in which we’d been eating lunch, two cyclists on the other side of the road were being questioned by the police. I was struck with fear when they came over to us, but all they had to say was that a key had been found, and it was assumed that it belonged to one of the cycle tourists. I checked my pockets and sure enough my padlock key was missing. The officer explained that key was being held at Ilok police station, and if we carried on in the same direction they would catch us up on the road and deliver it. I remarked at how surprised I was that the police could be so caring. “But this is the Croatian police!” came his response.\n\nWe rested under the Ottoman arches of the old fortress on Ilok hill, and then cooled down in the river before crossing the bridge back into Serbia. Before arriving in Novi Sad I’d phoned ahead to Anna who runs Culture Exchange, and regularly accomodates touring cyclists. We were tired and hungry, and the thought of beer and good food and a bed kept the cranks turning through miles of pot-holed suburbs.\n\nCulture Exchange is a ‘bike kitchen’ as well as a café and social centre, hosting music and poetry events, film screenings, language and bicycle repair classes and more. Its founders have faced considerable adversity in the form of belligerent authorities and hostile media organisations, and its continued existence is a labour of love, supported by many members of the local community. I was touched by the welcome we received from Anna, Sanja and the staff, and the resolve of the Serbs and expats who have fought to keep the place open.\n\nJon and Faustine were not far behind and we decided to wait for them in Novi Sad, which was ideal as it’s a great city. We went into a church and stayed there for nearly an hour, fixed to the spot by the mysterious beauty of the Orthodox liturgy. Unlike anything in the Roman and Anglican churches, there is no rigid structure of hymns, sermons and gospel readings to passively absorb. Unrestricted by pews, worshippers come and go as they please, lighting candles and kissing the icons. The aloofness of the priest (in this instance he mostly had his back turned to the congregation) shifts the focus to the music and incense and this physical contact with the icons, allowing for a highly introspective and personal experience which it is impossible not to be moved by.\n\nOn the second afternoon came three Englishmen riding very English touring bikes from London to Hong Kong. After speaking to them for a little while we agreed that if we left soon we could reach Belgrade by nightfall. Jon and Faustine arrived but wanted to spend some time in Novi Sad, and would meet us further down the line. Saying goodbye to the Culture Exchange people wasn’t without a hint of sadness, but Belgrade was calling.\n\nThere was an interesting moment early on when we offered to help a motorist by pushing his stricken BMW to the side of the road. He thanked us, jumped out and got straight into passing car which then sped off in the opposite dirction, leaving the BMW (which had no number plates) unlocked! After that we maintained a fast pace but it was well after dark by the time we reached the capital. Belgrade is not an easy city to cycle into, and we had a tough time getting to the house of Jurgen and Vibeka, the family we’d met in Croatia. When we arrived we were a little perplexed; all the other houses on the street were national embassies and it didn’t seem possible that anyone could actually live here! But it was the right place, and they seemed quite happy to allow troupe of dirty, road-worn cyclists to occupy their dining rooom.\n\nI followed the north side of the river out of Passau, which unlike the south, remains in Germany for a number of kilometers. I have no idea at what point I crossed into Austria as there was no border marker whatsoever and I spent about half an hour wondering which country I was in. The scenery had become much more rugged though, and despite never having been to Austria I remember thinking it looked unmistakably Austrian. Eventually I came to the huge serpentine bend in the river, which I’d heard about from numerous other cyclists who were either going in the oposite direction or had had the foresight to buy the guidebooks for the Danube cycle route (almost every cyclist I met had these; I just photographed important pages from other peoples’ copies). It is quite impossible to continue on this side, being very steep and heavily forested, and the only way through is to take the little ferry across to the opposite bank, from where you can pick up the path again.\n\nI decided to wait until morning for the ferry, and stayed at the tiny farmstead of Au. It operates as a guest house and you can camp for five euros. Mine was the only tent on the camping field, but I spent a cosy evening in the lounge with the landlord, his wife and the ferryman. There was homemade wine, and I was delighted to discover ‘most’, which in this instance was a rough and very dry perry, made from small, hard pears. It was delicious, and the closest thing to Kentish cider and perry that I have tried.\n\nIt rained all night, and in the morning I woke up early so that I could walk the forest trail to the ruined fortress at the top of the hill. If I hadn’t got lost this would have taken 45 minutes instead of two hours, but it was worth it and the view was good even with the thick mist.\n\nAfter a great breakfast I asked the landlady for some most for the road, and refusing the payment I offered, she filled one of my water bottles with the stuff. Clearly I was now ready for anything the day could throw at me, and I proceeded with my bicycle to the jetty where I rang the bell for the ferry.\n\nOn the other side I joined a multitude of touring cyclists, and the rain came down in torrents. It didn’t take long to reach Linz, and before doing anything else I went into a Kaffeehaus to try the Linzer Torte, which had been recommended by and elderly man in the guest house at Au. Full of roughly chopped almonds, cherries and various other fruits, the closest thing I could compare it to was a bakewell tart. It really does seem to be a very localised dessert, as I was unable to find it anywhere else in Austria. Or perhaps I just wasn’t going to the right bakeries.\n\nI liked Linz and wanted to spend an evening there, but the one hostel was far too expensive so I decided to move on. Shortly before I left I was sheltering from the rain on the steps of the Neuer Dom, where I met a fellow from Shanghai, travelling around Europe with his wife and sister. We talked for a little while and they gave me oolong teabags and a big pile of cherries, as well as contact details in case I get to China.\n\nThe weather didn’t improve, and the prospect of setting up the tent wasn’t a very appealing one. Eventually I caught sight of a little hut on stilts, presumably intended for wildlife watchers. I had to cross a waterlogged field to reach it; it had no door or glass in the windows and the floor wasn’t spacious enough to lie fully stretched out, but it at least offered shelter so I settled there for the night. Only in the morning, shivering and with a very sore back, did I notice the wasps’ nest above my head.\n\nThroughout much of the next day I was followed by thunderstorms, which caught up with me just past Grein and continued on and off until evening. I was disappointed to find the bicycle museum at Ybbs closed by the time I arrived, so decided to camp near the town and return in the morning. Later on the rain gave way to clear skies, and I swam and watched the barges and cruise ships chug their way upriver.\n\nThe bicycle museum was small but packed with exhibits illustrating the history of cycling, and is evidently the result of a lot of research and passion for the subject. Worth stopping for, even if the free drink promised by the voucher obtained at the tourist information office turned out to be a bottle of water!\n\nThe next stop was Melk Abbey (Stift Melk), which dominates the valley from its hilltop. In the early 18th Century it was rebuilt entirely in the baroque style and so looks much more like a royal palace than a monastery; although this is fitting as it had by that time become one of the most important centres of academia in Europe, and accumulated a more extensive library than most universities.\n\nIt is difficult to get a sense of the place as a working monastery as much of the inside has been converted into a museum. But in amongst the video installations and strange coloured lighting are some wonderful exhibits, including the Melk Cross (housing a piece of wood from the crucifixion which had somehow fallen into the hands of the ruling Babenberg family); the huge altarpiece by Jörg Breu (a great example of Northern Renaissance painting) and the highlight for me, the 11th Century Swanhilde’s Portable Altar, a small object decorated with the most exquisite carvings in bone.\n\nPast Melk I entered the Wachau, where impenetrable fortresses perch on jagged peaks and preside over countless acres of vineyards. It would have been a shame to travel the Lower Austrian Weinstraße without tasting something, so I stopped at the house of Anton. F. Noibinger, a winemaking family that produces some excellent Chardonnays.\n\nBy the time I reached Krems it was dark, and with nowhere to stay I knew that I would have to keep going until I was some distance out of town. I became increasingly desparate as the industrial hinterland went on and on, to the point that when I spotted another shelter on stilts I forgot all about the discomfort of the previous night I’d spent in one. This one was luxurious in comparison though, with a door, glazed windows and even carpet on the floor!\n\nI think I’d just managed to get to sleep when I was woken up by torchlight and the sound of someone climbing the ladder. The old man who evidently owned the shelter had come to watch birds at three o’ clock in the morning, and was just as confused by the situation as I was. It was a very short eviction notice and I had to quickly gather my things together and load up the bicycle. Cycling seemed an easier option than finding a place to camp, so I headed off into the darkness, stopping to shine my light on every road sign so that I wouldn’t miss a crucial turning. I reached Vienna at eleven and went to sleep on a bench near the cathedral square.\n\nI needed a place to stay and so looked up an artist whose name I’d been given by a friend. The house that matched the address was occupied by what I thought was a Chinese restaurant, so I went in to enquire and was greeted by a Chinese woman in her underwear. The following exchange went a bit like this:\n\n“I’m looking for Mr. Weissenberger, do you know if he lives above here?”\n\n“Ah, yes!” (leading me, with beaming smile, into the next room.)\n\n“Great, thank you!”\n\n(pointing at a bed) “You want massage?”\n\nAfter my fruitless search for Mr. Weissenberger I reluctantly settled on a hostel, where I ended up staying for three nights. While in Vienna I dedicated my time to recuperation, and did not very much besides strolling around, drinking tea in cafés and sitting in Parks. I’d wanted to visit the Belvedere Palace to see the Gustave Klimt collection, but the 20 Euro entry fee seemed a little steep. The gardens were lovely though, when it wasn’t raining. Attending an opera was also out of the question as the company are on holiday throughout most of the Summer (a shame as if you are prepared to queue it is possible to get tickets for next to nothing), so I went on the guided tour of the Opera House instead.\n\nSatisfied that I was sufficiently rested, I left the city, heading east along the north shore of the Danube. Most of the route between Vienna and the Slovak border is flat and free of traffic, and very pleasant for cycling. It passes through thousands of acres of wetlands – home to many species of birds – and there is even a Roman triumphful arch somewhere, although I was unable to find it. Around four hours later the lights of Bratislava and its whitewashed castle came into view.\n\nThe train journey back to Stuttgart took all day, and about half an hour before arriving I called Luke Atkinson, an old friend of Polly’s and reputedly one of the best tattoo artists in the world. Initially we agreed to meet for breakfast the following morning, but as I wandered the streets of Stuttgart the darkening skies began to take a very threatening turn, and I was relieved when he called back and invited me to stay at his house with his wife Anja and two children Emily and Pearl. We watched Brasil reach fourth place in the World Cup, and while Stuttgart got wet I sunk into a deep abyss of sleep that only a day of sitting on a train doing absolutely nothing can induce.\n\nThroughout the country horizontal bands of black, red and gold fluttered from houses and car windows in anticipation for the next day. We watched the final and celebrated the birthday of one of Luke’s friends in a restaurant in town, where a palpable atmosphere of tension grew as every minute passed with no goal on either side. This turned to euphoria at the last second victory against Argentina; a fantastic moment to be part of and one which will be remembered by Germans for years to come.\n\nAfter saying goodbye to the family I set off and started along the river Neckar in pleasant weather. Within five minutes I was cycling in a heavy downpour, and I sheltered under a bridge for an hour with my radio for company. Predictably I forgot about the radio, and it later ceased to function as I rode through sporadic showers with it lashed to the front of the bike. Standing outside a supermarket in Göppingen in the pouring rain with a broken radio I felt quite wretched, and found myself missing the Atkinsons and the sense of joy I’d felt during my time with them. But my mood improved considerably a couple of hours later in the village of Luizhausen. The Sun was shining and my radio was working again. Small things can make a big difference to a cycle tourist.\n\nNear the villge I was pleased to find another grillplatz. The grass around these communal barbequeues is always well kept, and is great for sleeping on (see Jerome K. Jerome, Three Men on the Bummel, to get an idea of the level of care taken of the German lawn). Rising from my delicately manicured patch of green, I cooked breakfast and began on the road to Ulm. I had high expectations of the town and was not disappointed. The Minster’s gothic steeple is the tallest in the world at over 160 meters, and I tramped up the 768 steps to the top, where I would catch my first glimpse of the Danube. This was another experience I had in common with Patrick Leigh Fermor, although I wonder if he had to shoulder his way through a hoard of teenagers who were holding a screaming competition. Resisting the urge to grab the nearest one and hurl him over the parapet, I gazed down at the river which would be my companion for the next couple of thousand kilometers, glinting in the late afternoon sun and snaking its way northeast across the plain.\n\nIt is well worth having a proper look around this great church, which has much more to offer than nice views. The tympanum sculptures above the west and north doors are mesmerising, and through them I felt I had a connection with what could be called the essence of Germanness. While the Italians were obsessing over minute refinements of gesture and ever more complex arrangements of limbs and drapery and so forth, here the German tradition of woodcarving was coming out of the Schwarzwald and being petrified in the hands of masons. Far from the delicate piety of their Italian counterparts, the features of these figures are as rough as the palms of a Bavarian peasant. Tortured and contorted and devoid of any idealising classicism, they are of the soil. The impression is that they keep that spire weighted down, and that without them it would soar off into the heavens and disappear from view. But for all their individual earthiness, the whole possesses a remarkable fluidity of narrative; a sort of magic that brings each figure and each scene to life with sinuous humanity.\n\nIt was a warm evening and as I rode I was in the company most of the population of Ulm, strolling about in the parks that line the banks of the Danube. Joining it had been an important landmark for me ever since I started thinking about this journey, and I felt at ease in the knowledge that it would be impossible to get lost now that I was following the course of the second largest river in Europe. No more dead ends or busy dual-carriageways; surely this path continued all the way to the delta! But this wasn’t to be the case, as it soon became clear.\n\nJust past Günzburg there was a clearing with at least twenty parked bicycles, and lots of people seated at those collapsible wooden tables and benches which are so intrinsic to the German drinking culture (and have even started appearing in certain fashionable towns on the coast of Kent). So much has already been said on the subject of German beer that there’s little I could add, but I can’t think of many better ways to finish a day’s cycling. In Summer these establishments, which all have generic names like DONAU-RADLER-TANKSTELLE, are to be found all along the German and Austrian portion of the river, and are one of the greatest joys of cycling this route.\n\nI camped near the cyclists’ bar, and in the morning had my first bath in the river. That day I passed through several towns, each of which seemed to be dominated by a different aesthetic. Gundelfingen had a sort of teutonic renaissance air about it, which contrasted with the grand baroque centre of Dillingen. At Donauwörth I met some very nice Australians; Joe, Gail and Greg, and a Czech called Jakub, who had cycled all the way from his home country on a diet of nothing but biscuits. The Australians were on their way from Istanbul to the Atlantic coast of France, and had some good information on the route that lay ahead. I gave them my leftover Paris Metro tickets and we shared a lunch of bananas on bread, peanuts and some of Jakub’s biscuits.\n\nAt Bertoldsheim there was a choice of two paths, and ignoring the one that all the other cyclists were taking, I took the way that appeared to stay closest to the river. This was a mistake, and led to the extremely frustrating experience of being lost in dense woodland with no rideable surface and swarms of those little flies that always find their way into your eye. I must have been going around in circles for a couple of hours before I emerged into the daylight and was able to orientate myself on the road to Neuburg, after which the path rejoined the river. Although there weren’t many obvious places to camp (either too close to stagnant water or too exposed) I made do with some thick scrub just downriver of a hydroelectric dam ten kilometers on, from where I was able to scramble down the rocks for an evening bath.\n\nI think it was at a tourist information office the following day at Vohburg that I picked up a free cyclists’ map of Bavaria – which proved more useful than my 23 year old Michelin map of South Germany – although in truth this country is so well signposted that I’m sure somebody with a better sense of direction than mine could easily navigate the whole route without any maps whatsoever.\n\nLate afternoon I stopped at a radler tankstelle which was most memorable for its landlord; a cartoon Bavarian – feather-crested felt hat, waistcoat and lederhosen, ruddy complexion and wild grey moustache – doling out sausages and foaming steins of murky nectar.\n\nIf I was missing the familiarity of Kent and Sussex then the low Sun provided some comfort as it dappled the road with the shadows of climbing hops. I was at home! Just before it started getting dark I rolled into the kloster of Weltenburg. The landscape here was suddenly very different from what I was used to and much more wild, with jagged, bare cliff faces jostling for space with the conifers on either side of the river. The kloster itself seemed like a very German attempt to tame all this ruggedness, with the hope that by following its example the surrounding rocks would arrange themselves into neat rows of baroque arches and pediments. They brew here, in my opinion, one of the best beers in Germany, for the tasting of which I was joined by an affable fellow named Horst. We shared a birthday, and he thought that accompanying me on the next stage of my journey would be a marvellous way to celebrate. I slept on a patch of grass that was close to the riverbank and overshadowed by the kloster, and in the morning did some laundry on the end of a little stone jetty.\n\nHorst and his rented bicycle appeared around nine, and we were off. The plan was to ride all the way to Regensburg together, but there are some very steep climbs between Weltenburg and Kelheim, and I could tell he was getting worried about his return journey. After a picnic at Bad Abbach he turned back and I continued alone.\n\nRegensburg is a beautiful medieval city whose waterfront steps lead to a warren of cobbled streets, stone arches and jutting masonry, presided over by a pair of skeletal gothic spires. I was determined to make the most of my birthday by losing myself in this labyrinth and occasionally diving into cavernous bierkellers – which I did with some success – but by early evening I felt the draw of the road and was on my way again.\n\nA short way after Regensburg a vision in dazzling white marble appeared on the hill to my left; a colossal edifice, pedimented and supported by rows of fluted doric comumns. Walhalla! The proportions of this temple to German greatness are supposed to be identical to those of the Parthenon, but in the inner sanctum, I was told, no golden statue of Athena but hundreds of busts of such Germanic heroes as Goethe and Beethoven (I later learned that even Anglo Saxons, including Alfred the Great, are given some representation, and that they don’t begrudge Hengist and Horsa for leaving the fatherland). At this hour it wasn’t possible to enter the atrium and see them, but I was free to climb the steps and wander through the colonades, from where I watched the Sun setting over the plains of Bavaria.\n\nSuffering from the heat the next day, I scrambled over the raised riverbank a little before Deggendorf to join several families who were resting under the shade on the pebbly beach and swimming in the cool water. Bathing and swimming became one of my favourite past times during the Danube section of the ride, and was something I did up to three times a day. I’ve heard many conflicting views on the cleanliness of that river, but I never suffered any ill effects from it and can say with confidence that the water in all the sections I travelled is perfectly safe.\n\nAs I approached Passau, Sibelius and Vaughan Williams were being played on the radio. This accompaniment added to the day a hint of the epic, and excitement began to rise at the thought of being in Austria. I’d ridden less than sixty kilometers from the start of the day at Niederalteich and planned to cross the border that afternoon, but in Passau an Englishman called Steve told me about a campsite that was cheap and only for tents (none of those giant fridges on wheels), and this being such an enchanting town, I decided to stay.\n\nOne of the really magical things about Passau is that it is built on the confluence of three rivers, and if you clamber up the steps to the castle it is possible to make out three distinct hues in the water where the Danube, the Inn and the Ilz become one.\n\nThe baroque interior of the cathedral is so ornate that it is impossible to look at it for more than a few minutes without risking serious eyesight damage, and it contains the largest church organ in the world. A recital takes place every day, but I arrived too late to experience it.\n\nAt the campsite I met Jake Newbrook, an American who is travelling the length of the Danube on a stand up paddle board, and upon reaching the Black Sea will be the first person in the world to complete such a journey. From there he plans to paddle to Sicily. Cycling has its difficult moments but the thought of being at the mercy of the Black Sea in Winter gave me a renewed appreciation for the comfort and relative safety of two wheels on dry land. In the morning I packed up my tent and loaded everything onto the bike (by now an automatic routine), and then waved goodbye to the shrinking figure of Jake on his paddle board. It was time to leave Germany."
