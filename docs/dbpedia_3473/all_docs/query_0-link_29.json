For patients presenting with complaint of balance disorder, it helps doctors identify the system, where the problem originates from (ocular, inner ear and proprioception). After test result is reviewed, the patient is referred to neurology, physical medicine and rehabilitation and otolaryngology for treatment.\n\nNeurological Sciences Center\n\nOur neurological sciences unit deals with treatment of many diseases, including but not limited to migraine, headaches, vertigo, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, sleep apnea syndrome, restless leg syndrome, myasthenia gravis, Alzheimer and other dementias as well as ataxia, carpal tunnel syndrome, polyneuropathy and muscle diseases.\n\nNeurology department renders outpatient, emergency medicine and inpatient services as well as neurophysiology laboratory service.\n\nConsidering outpatient services, appropriate treatment is started following necessary examinations in patients, who present with certain complaints, such as headache, dizziness, impaired vision, and speech disorder, numbness in hands and/or feet, muscle weakness, involuntary movements, sleep disorders, impaired memory and imbalance. Patients are treated at inpatient settings for conditions that require inpatient examination and for acute diseases.\n\nEEG, EMG, VEP and SEP are performed by clinical neurophysiology specialists at neurophysiology laboratory.\n\nGastroenterology\n\nIntragastric balloon – one of the options for non-surgical treatment of obesity - can be performed with endoscopic technique under sedation upon referral by our general surgery team. This method aims to promote sense of being full earlier, as stomach gets full quicker after a balloon is inserted into stomach cavity. It is a transient method. IT is preferred for patients without any co-existing disease, such as diabetes mellitus, and above a certain body weight. Or it must be used to lose weight in obese patients after the surgery.\n\nPhysiotherapy Center\n\nNumerous specialized procedures, including Dry Needling, Neural Therapy, Manual Therapy and Therapeutic Massage, are performed at our Physiotherapy Center.\n\nEmergency Medicine\n\nThere are 8 beds, including 4 observation beds, 2 intervention beds, 1 CPR bed and 1 triage bed, in Emergency Medicine department.\n\nInternational Patient Center Office for International Patients\n\nMedicana Kadıköy Hospital delivers service not only to Kadıköy and Istanbul, but it is also a reference hospital for international patients, who may seek services from the hospital.\n\nThe office serves international patients, who travel from various countries for diagnosis and treatment services at Medicana Kadıköy Hospital, in all languages and international patients are enabled to feel at their home throughout all procedures performed at the hospital.\n\nMoreover, our hospital has contracts with hotels located close to the hospital and thus, we can support our patients, upon request, in terms of accommodation and transfers."
