I'll crush you.\" [audience laughs] \"With my hand!\"\n\n\"He's quiet as well, especially if you stalk him.\"\n\nOn Brad Pitt.\n\nAs a vulgar lounge entertainer, my business relies on ridiculous stereotypes! If these people start using deodorant, I might as well just go home!\n\nOn French people\n\nYou die alone in your house, and your cat will eat you.\n\nGet well soon, Castro. [pause] Actually, no, don't; die, you bastard!\n\nI don't like my politicians entertaining me and I don't like my entertainers politicianing [sic] me.\n\nHe's German so he's Herr Ball. Herr Ball. His movies are so bad, cats choke when they hear his name.\n\nThat's here on CBS, where the 'C' stands for 'Classy' and the 'BS' speaks for itself.\n\nI enjoy bathing, as many Europeans don't.\n\nKids: If a bear is wearing a ranger hat, it's because he ate the ranger!\n\nOn Smokey Bear\n\nOh, this isn't a talk show; it's more just filling time, really, 'til the infomercials start.\n\nYou don't say 'we're suspending the campaign'! You can't say that! We didn't sus-, you can't, it's the democratic process! We didn't suspend it for 9/11, we didn't suspend it for Pearl Harbor, we didn't suspend it for the Nazis, we didn't suspend it for the damn British! We don't do that in America! We don't! There's no suspending the campaign! Democracy first! First, first, first! First! Democracy, FIRST!\n\nin response to John McCain's suggestion to suspend the 2008 presidential campaign because of the financial crisis.[specific citation needed]\n\nI haven't had a drink in thirteen years, but occasionally I'm tempted to have one beer. The problem is that if I have that one beer, I wake up in Tijuana four days later with a tattoo and a sore ass.[specific citation needed]\n\nRelax, you're among friends now. The long hard day is over and the roly-poly funny man is before you.[specific citation needed]\n\nJust a warning: If you're a bunch of sexy teenagers at a lake where other sexy teenagers were killed 30 years ago, leave! The guy in the forest with a hockey mask... maybe doesn't play hockey.[specific citation needed]\n\n[to Rupert Grint] Look at the great city of LA stretched out in front of you, son: there's dangerous people living in that cardboard backdrop.[specific citation needed]\n\nDon't do that... By the way, this is not Oprah furniture; you jump on this, and it will be firewood... Oprah's got the real thing, this stuff...this is about as real as that [points to cityscape backdrop] right there.\n\nOn Clive Barker pretending to be Tom Cruise.[specific citation needed]\n\nClive Barker: It's an excuse to look at my groin.\n\nCraig Ferguson: I'm European - I don't need an excuse.\n\nOff-topic discussion about Clive Barker's pants.[specific citation needed]\n\nCraig Ferguson: Do you do therapy?\n\nHugh Laurie: I see a gentleman once a week.\n\nCraig Ferguson: I love it, I'm a great convert.\n\nHugh Laurie: Therapy?\n\nCraig Ferguson: No, just seeing a gentleman once a week.[specific citation needed]\n\nI'm TV's Craig Ferguson, please sit down relax and: \"take off your pants\"; \"dip your hand into a bowl of warm water and fall fast asleep\"; etc.[specific citation needed]\n\nI view my own body as a petting zoo. I am the main attraction... And the only customer.[specific citation needed]\n\n[reading an email] \"Dear Craig, … are your letters written by your writers?\" No. \"Does this make me one of your writers?\" (ponders) Yes. \"Why haven't I been paid?\" Because you're one of my writers!\n\n2009-04-03 broadcast\n\n[to camera] Excuse me for just a second. [walks off-camera, to studio audience] Shut up!\n\n2009-05-15 broadcast\n\nThe audience had collectively went \"Aw…\", expressing disappointment.\n\n[bends over] *errgh* Sorry for making that noise, but … that's what happens when you get older.

Filmed for a week of shows in Paris, France.\n\n2011-08-05 broadcast\n\n[The Secretariat horse character reveals his true identity, and it happens to be Bob Newhart.]\n\nCraig: Bob Newhart! What are you doing here?\n\nBob Newhart: Hey, Craig; it's your dream!\n\nDuring the final episode, the ending of the classic sitcom Newhart was spoofed here; Craig, in his role as Nigel Wick from The Drew Carey Show, wakes up next to Drew and discovers his entire stint as host of the Late Late Show was all a bad dream.\n\nCommonly repeated\n\n[edit]\n\n[When beginning the cold open with another person] Please state your name for the camera.[citation needed]\n\nAnother innocent victim of my pointless rage.[citation needed]\n\nI can't live by your rules, man![citation needed]\n\n[After the doorbell rings, right before Secretariat appears] Who's that at the door?![citation needed]\n\nIt's a great day for America, everybody.[citation needed]\n\nRemind you of anyone?[citation needed]\n\n[referring to himself] Where's the Scottish Conan guy?[citation needed]\n\nSounds like a party at Elton John's house.[citation needed]\n\nIt's a JOKE![citation needed]\n\n[referring to a category of people he might have upset with a joke] I'm looking forward to your letters...[citation needed]\n\n[in reference to a two-word comment from a guest] ...I used to dance under that name.\n\nIt's okay, I'm European [referring to a preceding sexually ambiguous comment].[citation needed]\n\nI Know!....[citation needed]\n\n...or is it?[citation needed]\n\n...best night of my life.[citation needed]\n\nYou know who doesn't like _____? Al-Qaeda![citation needed]\n\n[referring to a suggestive comment aimed at the audience] You too, ladies.[citation needed]\n\n[with a fist-shake] Take that, ____.[citation needed]\n\n\"By the way…\" variations\n\n[edit]\n\nBy the way, there's a place on Hollywood Boulevard where you can get a _____ for twenty bucks.[citation needed]\n\nBy the way, _____ was a name I used to dance under.[citation needed]\n\nBy the way, _____ was the name of a movie I accidentally watched in a hotel room twenty or thirty times.[citation needed]\n\n\"Welcome Back\" variations\n\n[edit]\n\nWelcome back, my cheeky wee monkeys.[citation needed]\n\nWelcome back, my filthy pigeons.[citation needed]\n\nWelcome back, my naughty monkeys.

You're fuckin' bulletproof. If you do what you absolutely believe to be right, then you're fuckin' bulletproof.\n\nBetween the Bridge and the River (2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nLove at first sight is not rare, in fact it is extremely common, it happens to some people a few times a year. The feeling of “what if” when meeting the eyes of a stranger can be love unrecognized.\n\nThey could have gotten help for this infertility but they believed that interfering with the reproductive process, even if it was faulty, was anti-God. It was against His plan. It never occurred to them that God may have provided the world with a vast array of very brainy medical types for the very reason of solving problems such as theirs. However, there is one thing that the medical profession cannot do and that is save people from being idiots.\n\nChange is the nature of God’s mind, and resistance to it is the source of great pain.\n\nThe devil is not abroad at night in the form of a cat or a wolf or any other animal. He lives eternally in the hearts of men.\n\nFraser’s mother, Janice, was actually quite a happy soul but she had to hide it because, like all pseudo-intellectuals, she thought being cheery made her look stupid, which of course she was for believing that rubbish in the first place.\n\nLike most sharks, Margaret liked to think of herself as a victim of the cruel sea.\n\nHigh school is tough on anyone, an absolute rule of the Universe being that if high school is not a buttockclenchingly awkward, emotionally difficult, and unpleasant time of your life, then the rest of it will be a crushing disappointment. Academic success is desirable, popularity (the only thing that most students really desire) is not. Those who excel socially in high school are truly damned. The homecoming queen does indeed bear the mark of the beast.\n\nBeing guilty tends to engender feelings of guilt.\n\nAlways laugh second.\n\nAllowances can always be made for your friends to disagree with you. Disagreement, vehement disagreement, is healthy. Debate is impossible without it. Evil does not question itself. Even the incorruptible are corruptible if they cannot accept the possibility of being mistaken.\n\nInfallibility is a sin in any man. All laws can be broken and are. Often. Like when a bumblebee flies or an ancient regime is toppled.\n\nLike many of her sex, Sophie was fiercely competitive with other women, working on the crackpot theory that if she could be better in some way, men would like her more, respect her. Make her happy. She never cottoned on that the men she was attracted to, the men who found her attractive, didn’t like women.\n\nThey liked variety. And fucking.\n\nThat’s the thing about terrorism – it works. Especially for the terrorists – they might not get what they want but it feels damn good trying.\n\nFor many terrorists, the means is the end.\n\nConfession is a sacred rite enhanced by allegory, exaggeration, and lies.\n\nEvil does not question itself. Only Hope questions itself.\n\nTime is only linear for engineers and referees.\n\nThe problem with suicide is that it seems so flamboyant. It’s camp. You have to be a bit of a drama queen to ever seriously consider it.\n\nAmerican on Purpose (2009)\n\n[edit]\n\nFailure is not a disgrace. It’s just a pitch that you missed, and you’d better get ready for the next one... My son and I are Americans, we prepare for glory by failing until we don’t.\n\nI did have a love for literature that overpowered my hatred of the people who taught it, and I think because I had no respect for the teachers, their attitude didn’t poison the writing that I was discovering for myself.\n\nBeing funny is a gift, and, when done well, is an art form.\n\nSober alkies are often asked: “When did you hit rock bottom?” but a more informed question might be: “How many times did you hit rock bottom?\n\nAppear tougher or cooler or funnier than you feel and there is a chance you’ll make it.\n\nThere are bound to be some lies here, but I’ve been telling them so long they’ve become truth, my truth, as close as I can get to what really happened.\n\nBetween safety and adventure I choose adventure.\n\nAmerica is, for me, an aspiration, a philosophy, a way of being, a dream.[1]\n\nCouple Thinkers (2017)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe trouble I have with astrophysics or quantum mechanics is the same problem I have with philosophy; which is: initially it is mind blowing, then it is fascinating, then it is disturbing, then it is almost uncomprehensible, then it's fascinating again, then you disappear up your own ass.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\n↑ Van Susteren, Greta (22 September 2009). \"Why Craig Ferguson Is 'American on Purpose'\".
