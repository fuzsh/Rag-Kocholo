        "text": "Former US talk show host Craig Ferguson is to return to Scottish TV for the first time in 25 years with an appearance on Still Game.\n\nThe Glasgow-born comedian presented the Late Late Show for more than a decade, becoming one of the highest paid hosts in America.\n\nFerguson said he had been sent a Still Game script by the show's creators Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill.\n\nHe called it \"hilarious\" and said he was delighted to be part of the show.\n\nThe 55-year-old, who continues to present US game shows, told the Sunday Times Scotland: \"My ambitions are more about doing stuff that's fun so my first television work in Scotland in 25 years is later this year and it's because Ford and Greg sent me a script for Still Game, and I'm going to do an episode because it's just hilarious.\"\n\n'So funny'\n\nHe added: \"I loved Chewin' The Fat and I love Still Game, so I'm delighted to be part of that.\"\n\nBefore moving to the US, Ferguson appeared in British TV shows such as One Foot In The Grave in the 1990s.\n\nHe also acted in a number of US programmes before winning the host role on the Late Late Show.\n\nHe stepped down at the end of 2014, with James Corden taking over the role."
