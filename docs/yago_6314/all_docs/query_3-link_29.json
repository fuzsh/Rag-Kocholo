        "text": "Spanning 11 days in May, the Netflix is a Joke Festival brought more than 400 comedy shows to 35-plus sites in Los Angeles. And though canceled this year, Montreal’s monthlong Just for Laughs is the largest international comedy festival in the world.\n\nColumbus may not be L.A. or Montreal, but it is the 14th largest city in the U.S. and Walker Evans said he believes its abundance of untapped talent make it prime real estate for a multiday, multivenue comedy fest of its own.\n\nEvans, co-founder of Columbus Underground with wife and business partner Anne, launched the Columbus Coffee Festival in 2018 and the popularity of that event spawned an idea for another entertainment venture.\n\n'Dukes of Funnytown': Steve Martin and Martin Short's new show headed to Mershon Auditorium on Nov. 1\n\n“The coffee festival has been growing and (is) very successful, and we’re always looking for new ideas,” Evans said. “We’ve been comedy fans for a long time. We enjoy the local scene and seeing big headliners when they’re at the Funny Bone.”\n\nNearly a year ago, he reached out to venues and event producers around town with a proposition. “What if we run a comedy festival as a whole event, but with each venue running things their own way? They were on board with that,” Evans said.\n\nWith local businesses giving him the green light, Evans focused in earnest on populating those spaces with performers he felt would draw audiences.\n\n“Back in January, I took the lead on booking headliners. I made a big list of aspirational ‘gets’ — rising-stars type of talent. The Bill Burrs, Dave Chappelles, Ali Wongs — we don’t have the budget for them,\" he said.\n\n“But we do have some who have made late-night TV appearances, Netflix specials and have been honing their craft for a while.\"\n\nAdditionally, a call for talent yielded nearly 250 applications, which meant watching nearly 250 videos and judging them. Ultimately, Evans pulled together an impressive 150-plus comics to perform over five days at the Columbus Comedy Festival, which will begin midweek and continue into the weekend.\n\nEvans doesn’t take all the credit. In addition to working with his wife to establish the festival, he said Danielle Hackworth, director of events, has been an invaluable part of “a team effort” working toward a common goal.\n\nFerguson at the Southern: Former late-night host Craig Ferguson bringing 'Pants on Fire' tour to town Nov. 1\n\n“We want to shine a spotlight on local talent and local venues. We have a lot of very funny people in Columbus who are flying under the radar. But we also want to plant a flag in the ground for national talent,” Evans said.\n\n“We want to make sure everyone has good time and keep this going for years. Columbus is a big city, a growing city. We’re worth stopping at.”\n\nIf you’re looking for laughs, the Columbus Comedy Festival is also a worthwhile destination and we’ve got your back with some details you need to know if you plan to go.\n\nWhen is the Columbus Comedy Festival?\n\nThe festival kicked off at 6 p.m. Wednesday with Toxic Waves — stand-up comedy with musical accompaniment starring Justin Golak — performing at MadLab, 227 N. Third St. Subsequent shows will run concurrently at different locations each day through Aug. 18.\n\nWhere will the shows take place?\n\nParticipating venues are Columbus Funny Bone, The Kee, The Shedd Stage and Van Fleet Theatre at the Columbus Performing Arts Center, MadLab, The Attic Comedy Club, Hashtag Comedy Club and The Nest Theatre, as well as Don’t Tell Comedy: Columbus, which will host pop-up shows at locations to be revealed once tickets are purchased. (Even the performers will be kept secret!)\n\n“Don’t Tell Comedy pop-ups started in L.A. before the pandemic and continued when people were looking for something outdoors where they could socially distance,” Evans said.\n\n“They’re one part speakeasy, one part trustfall. It’s a cool, experiential thing to do, a fun date night. It’s like the roulette version of comedy.”\n\nHow much are tickets?\n\nPrices range from $10-$30 depending on the venue. “Instead of making one really expensive weekend pass, we made it a la carte, where you can pick and choose who you want to see,” Evans said.\n\n“We’ve been selling advance tickets since May. Some shows are close to selling out, others still have lots of tickets.”\n\nComedy on the edge: Comedian Sarah Silverman to bring edgy stand-up to Mershon Auditorium on Nov. 3\n\nWho are the headliners?\n\nThe dozens of headliners are too numerous to list, so here are a few names you might recognize:\n\nJason Banks: The Columbus comedian’s social-media fame took off during the pandemic and he currently boasts more than 9 million followers on TikTok.\n\nTony Rock: In addition to shows on Netflix and Comedy Central, Rock is known for playing Uncle Ryan on “Everybody Hates Chris.” And yes, he’s Chris Rock’s little brother. (Another Rock brother, Jordan, is also in the festival lineup.)\n\nMichael Ian Black: The actor, writer and comedian has appeared on TV shows including \"The State,\" \"Viva Variety,\" \"Ed,\" \"The Jim Gaffigan Show\" and numerous others.\n\nIrene Tu: With more than 2.7 million views, Tu's \"Stand-Up Featuring\" set is the most watched reel on Comedy Central Stand-Up's Instagram page. She has performed at Netflix is a Joke and her first comedy album, \"We're Done Now,\" debuted in March at No. 1 on the iTunes comedy charts.\n\nWhat comedic styles will be represented?\n\nThe festival is heavy on stand-up comics because “generally, that’s the most popular with audiences,” Evans said, noting that even within the stand-up realm, performers have varying styles.\n\n“It’s important to have diversity in terms of age, gender, race, background, comedy style,” he said. “We have improv, stand-up, quirky little variety shows … so we can offer a little bit of everything.”\n\n“A little bit of everything” includes Columbus comic Adam Little, whose “A Lil Show” will be presented as a sketch video showcase; Chad the Bird, an opinionated avian whose monologues Evans said are “definitely R-rated;” and Hashtag Comedy Company's live podcast recording of \"Whose Life Is It, Anyway.\"\n\nAnd if you've never seen a Drunk PowerPoint presentation, what better time than during the Columbus Comedy Festival?\n\nHow were the comedians’ submitted videos judged?\n\nEvans said a team reviewed and scored each video, judging the performers on whether they had well-crafted material, their comfort onstage and of course, their overall funniness. “Some of (the videos) are really, really good — very professionally produced, very top-quality stuff,” he said.\n\nComedians’ websites and social media also helped the team determine who would be a good “get” since short comedy reels are immensely popular on the three biggest platforms — Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. “You can see the ones getting the most traction algorithmically,” Evans said.\n\n“A lot of people provided links to their website, where you can also get an idea of whether they are aiming to make a career out of this or if it’s a hobby for them.”\n\nWhere are most of the comics from?\n\n“It’s about 50-50 between Ohio and other places. We have a lot of headliners from New York or L.A., but we’ve filled their shows with local comics, so people will get a nice slice of local talent,” Evans said.\n\n“A cool thing is the Ohio connections some of (the comics) have. Fumi Abe went to high school in Hilliard and River Butcher is from Akron. So, there are a lot of Ohio ties, even if they’ve moved on to somewhere else.”\n\nLooking forward: Comedian Sal Vulcano's \"Everything's Fine Tour\" coming to Columbus in 2025\n\nWhy should I see comedians I don’t know?\n\nIn addition to possibly discovering the funniest person you’ve never heard of, you’ll be supporting local businesses and helping rising comedians build their fanbases.\n\n“Hopefully, the festival grows their audiences. The ability to share the stage with bigger names opens connections and they might get invited to opportunities in other cities,” Evans said. “It provides some networking opportunities.”\n\nWhere can I find all the info I need in one place?\n\nFor details about the Columbus Comedy Festival, including a schedule, tickets, performer bios and more, visit columbuscomedyfest.com."
