        "text": "James Corden is in; Craig Ferguson is out\n\nCorden, a Tony Award-winning British actor and writer, will take over for Ferguson as host of the CBS Late Late Show in December.\n\n\"James Corden is a rare entertainment force who combines irresistible charm, warmth and originality with a diverse range of creative instincts and performance talent,\" said CBS Entertainment chairman Nina Tassler. \"He is the ultimate multi-hyphenate - a writer, creator and performer who is loved and respected in every medium he touches, including theater, comedy, music, film and television.\n\nCorden, 36, won a 2012 Tony for the Broadway musical \"One Man, Two Govnors.\" He starred in a pair of TV series, \"Gavin and Stacy,\" and \"The Wrong Mans.\" He also starred with Keira Knightly in the film \"Begin Again\" and will appear as The Baker in the upcoming \"Into The Woods\"\n\n\"To be asked to host such a prestigious show on America's #1 network is hugely exciting,\" Corden said. \"I can't wait to get started, and will do my very best to make a show America will enjoy.\"\n\nFerguson has hosted the CBS late night talk show for the past decade. He announced his plan to retire in April. His last show will be in December."
