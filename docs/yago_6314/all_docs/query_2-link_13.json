He is also known to be a producer, screenwriter, and director.\n\nBiography[]\n\nCraig was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and emigrated to America in January 1995. He started out as a musician, playing drums and guitar for a small band called \"Dreamboys\". He is now best known as the host of The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson, as well as for his special appearances on The Drew Carey Show. After retiring from his late-night TV special, he started a comedic radio site on SiriusXM Satellite Radio called The Craig Ferguson Show where he still interviews celebrities.\n\nHis other film work includes The Big Tease, Born Romantic, Disney's Brave, The Ice House, I'll be there, and Saving Grace.\n\nFerguson also wrote his autobiography, American On Purpose: The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Patriot, as well as the novel Between the Bridge and the River. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for narrating his autobiography's audio book in both 2010 and 2011.\n\nFerguson provided the foreword to the book, The Art of How to Train Your Dragon, in which he confided that the film's storyline struck a particular chord with him since as a young man he was deathly afraid of flying, but later overcame his fear: now, not only is he not afraid to board airplanes, but he is a certified pilot.\n\nHe's also good friends with Gerard Butler who voices Stoick in the movies and shorts and acted alongside Christopher Mintz-Plasse who voices Fishlegs in the movie Kick-Ass.\n\nHis son, Liam, appears with his father in How to Train Your Dragon: Homecoming, voicing Nuffink Haddock.\n\nSelected Filmography[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2011 Winnie the Pooh Owl Feature film 2012 Brave Lord Macintosh Big Top Scooby-Doo!
