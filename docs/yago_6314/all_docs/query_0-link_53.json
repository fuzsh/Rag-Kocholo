So call today 888-655-4575.\n\nCraig Ferguson entered the world of late night comedy following a diverse and eclectic career that encompasses film, television and the stage. Since taking the helm of the Late, Late Show on January 3, 2005, the show has set all-time viewer records in the five years that it has been on the air.\n\nMost recently, Craig Ferguson was seen in the wildly successful animated feature “How to Train Your Dragon” as the Viking, ‘Gobber.’ Born in Glasgow, Scotland, Ferguson got his start in the entertainment industry as a drummer for some of the worst punk bands in the U.K., a profession he held for several years. Following his musical stint, he began tending bar in a local pub in Glasgow where he was introduced to Michael Boyd, the artistic director of The Tron Theatre in Glasgow, who persuaded Ferguson to give acting a go. After several low paying acting gigs, Ferguson discovered he had a knack for comedy and was soon the star of his own BBC television show, The Ferguson Theory.\n\nAfter several stints on the English comedy circuit, Craig Ferguson brought his act to America in 1995 to star with Betty White and Marie Osmond in the short-lived ABC comedy Maybe This Time. After the show ended, ABC decided to add the talented Scotsman to The Drew Carey Show, playing Drew Carey’s boss, Nigel Wick, from 1996-2003. Craig Ferguson has written the feature films The Big Tease and Saving Grace. In 2003, he made his directorial debut with I’ll Be There, which he also wrote and starred in. I’ll Be There went on to receive the Audience Award for Best Film at the Aspen, Dallas, and Valencia film festivals.\n\nCraig Ferguson was also named “best new director” at the Napa Valley Film Festival. Ferguson’s other film credits include, Niagra Motel, Lenny the Wonder Dog, Prendimi l’anima, Life Without Dick, Chain of Fools, Born Romantic and The Big Tease.\n\nIn April 2006, Ferguson debuted his first novel entitled Between The Bridge and The River, which made it onto the best seller list. In the novel, two childhood friends from Scotland and two illegitimate half-brothers from the deep South suffer and enjoy all manner of bizarre adventures which, it turns out, are somehow interconnected-and, even more surprisingly, meaningful. The eclectic cast of characters features Socrates, Carl Jung, and Tony Randall; while love, greed, hope, revenge, organized religion, and Hollywood also make special appearances.\n\nSince coming into his own on the “Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson” and winning his first Emmy nomination in 2006, Craig has seem to become the topic of conversation within the media and a growing trend of success in 2010. In February 2008 he succeeded in becoming a U.S. Citizen mentioning that this is his home after thirteen years and “my heart is here.” Soon after, Craig Ferguson had landed himself the biggest date of all; a date with President Bush hosting the White House Correspondence Dinner. Critics raved of his witty and comical deliverance speech to the 3,000 attendees who included political journalists, celebrities, and Washington’s power players. Last fall, Harper Collins published Ferguson’s memoir American On Purpose– a book about why and how late night funnyman, Craig Ferguson became an American. The book was listed on the New York Times bestseller list and continues to sell well to date.\n\nCraig Ferguson also serves on the board of the Lollipop Theater Network. The mission of the Lollipop Theater Network is to bring movies that are currently in theatrical release to hospitalized children facing chronic and life threatening illness nationwide.\n\nTravels from: Los Angeles, CA\n\nBook or hire funny standup comedians\n\nBook or hire funny humorists, hosts and emcees\n\nBook or hire celebrity guest speakers\n\nWe can help you book or hire any clean stand up comedians, comics or stand up comedy acts.
