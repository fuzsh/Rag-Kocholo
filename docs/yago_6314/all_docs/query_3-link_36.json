        "text": "It’s one day after the Fourth of July and even though he’s on vacation in his native Scotland, Craig Ferguson has a certain photo of a certain New Jersey governor on his mind. If the comedian was still doing “The Late, Late Show” on CBS, he says by phone, “I’m sure I’d be joking about Chris Christie on that beach.”\n\nThat was news in Scotland?\n\n“It was news everywhere,” Ferguson insists.\n\nHe doesn’t indicate what those jokes might be, though. Perhaps he’s saving them for his return to the Wellmont Theater in Montclair on Friday with his “New Deal” tour.\n\nThe funnyman, who has also distinguished himself as an actor, author and, more recently, game show host, also won’t say how new his “New Deal” show is. But as longtime fans of his 9-year stint hosting “The Late, Late Show” on CBS can attest, Ferguson has no qualms about going off-book and making things up as he goes along.\n\nIt wasn’t always thus. In 2006, when Ferguson succeeded Craig Kilborn on the show after seven years of playing Mr. Wick on “The Drew Carey Show,” he was pushed into a corner that he didn’t really care for.\n\n“I never had writers before, and when I started the show, people were writing jokes for me and putting them on cards,” he recalls. “It made me feel cheesy. I was trying to be different. I didn’t want to be one of those guys who phones it in.”\n\nEventually, Ferguson dispensed with all of that and went on his merry way, spinning monologues that went on and on. And hither and yon. And then some.\n\nTelevision: 'Jeopardy!' has tough time with Bergen County's blue laws\n\nTelevision: 'Game of Thrones' returns\n\nInside comedy: Bill Ervolino, Vince August and Bob Gonzo\n\nAs the television critic Ashley Steves once noted, “His monologues were fresh and riffed from a list of talking points, a style he adopted only a couple months into his run when he figured out the ad-libbed filler he would deliver between scripted jokes got more laughs than the jokes themselves.”\n\nFerguson doesn’t bristle at kind words — from critics, fans or anyone else, for that matter.\n\n“I always wanted to make people laugh,” he says, “to enjoy what I did. But I also wanted to take pride in what I was doing. I didn’t want to be a hack.”\n\nThe comedian’s path to anti-hackdom was a long and winding road that goes back to the 1980s, when he first moved to the United States. He did construction in Harlem. Then he worked as a bouncer in a trendy East Village bar.\n\nPrior to all that hammering and bouncing, he had been in a punk rock band in Scotland. And after his bouncer days, he pursued a comedy career, performing stand-up when he could and taking small television and movie roles, until his breakthrough on “The Drew Carey Show” and then “The Late, Late Show.”\n\nNowadays, he’s also noted for his Emmy-winning work on “Celebrity Name Game,” a job that allowed him to ad-lib to his heart’s content and show off that big Scottish accent of his, which, to American ears, sounds an awful lot like a certain 007.\n\n“I’m originally from New Jersey,” he says, with a laugh. “The Scottish accent is my gimmick.”\n\nAs for Sean Connery: Did they ever meet? Did they ever [ahem] bond?\n\n“I only met him once at a Hollywood kind of thing,” Ferguson notes, “and it was a thrill. He is kind of a god to me. I mean, he’s a big deal everywhere, but he’s really big in Scotland. I would hang around with him constantly if he’d let me.”\n\nThe comedian became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008 and enjoys talking about his early days here, and of making ends meet while pursuing his dreams of being a performer.\n\nWas he a tenacious kid?\n\n“I come from a very poor background, in a rough part of the world,” he says. “Not all of Scotland is rough, but the town I’m from was pretty ... lively. And that makes you a little different. It makes you a little needy and jumpy. Being an immigrant ... well, for me, being an immigrant in the United States means you have to work and work to get ahead. You don’t just chase the American Dream, you chase it hard.”\n\nAs a performer, he’s probably seen more of this country than most Americans, and that’s fine with him.\n\n“I’ve taken these road trips across America and whenever I had to stop to get gas or something to eat, I’d always drive five miles from the freeway. It forces you to meet people. And by that I mean real people, the people who live there, not just the transient people driving through.\n\n“People were always so friendly to me,” he continues, “and that was before I had the TV show. Maybe it was the accent, but I think Americans are very hospitable people for the most part. Very hospitable and polite.”\n\nAsked if he misses the late-night gig, Ferguson says no. “I’m glad I don’t have to do it in this environment,” he says, without pointing fingers or naming names. “Everyone is forced to hit this same note all the time and that would drive me crazy.”\n\nHe’s aware he’s liked by folks on both sides of the political aisle and says he’d like to keep it that way.\n\n“When I get up there,” he says, “I’m not afraid of attacking a politician or a policy, but I’m not telling people how to vote or how to think. That’s not my job. My job is to make people laugh.”\n\nEmail: ervolino@northjersey.com"
