        "text": "About living in the light co.\n\nWelcome to our little corner of the internet! Living in the Light started in 2019 as a passion project for myself on Facebook. I wanted a place to share my love for Jesus and my love for implementing the gospel into the beauty/influencer realm. And let me tell you, it is NO easy task. Jesus is not easily welcomed into this world. I continually fight against culture to share what I know is the truth of the Bible.\n\nAt the end of 2019 I was VERY pregnant and decided to step away from my nursing career forever to pursue Living in the Light full-time. I had no idea what would happen, but I knew if I didn’t take the leap then, I definitely wouldn’t do it after giving birth to our first child.\n\nAnd as you all know, 2020 hit HARD. We had our daughter, Lila Leovanna, on February 8th, 2020. It was snowing that day. I remember looking out of my hospital room window thinking about how beautiful and rare it was to see snow in South Carolina.\n\nMarch of 2020: the lockdown. I was anxious. Nick was anxious. We had a colicky daughter who couldn’t breastfeed and wouldn’t sleep. I felt God more than ever in this month and simultaneously was at the lowest point of my life. I was completely isolated and felt like I did NOT have a grip on motherhood.\n\nAnd in spite of all of that, God decided to to BIG things with our business. Nick left his full-time job as a manager at Starbucks in July of 2020 and we hit the ground running with establishing Living in the Light as an official LLC. Shortly after in December, we launched our very own apparel line.\n\nAnd fast-forward to present day. We are in the process of opening a physical storefront, our apparel line has far-exceeded our expectations, we are debt-free, and have been able to do things with our business that we never, EVER thought possible.\n\nI give all of the glory to the Lord. Every bit of it. Did we work hard? Yes, of course we did. I worked relentlessly for 4 years on my online business while working 12 hour night shifts before our brand was even a thought in my mind. But there is no reason other than the goodness of God for any of this to be possible during a pandemic. He has provided for us in ways that are immeasurably more than we could’ve imagined.\n\nI am so thankful we took the leap. I am so thankful for God’s provision. And we look forward to shamelessly displaying the gospel through every avenue of this brand.\n\nAnd thank you. Thank you to every single man and woman who has come alongside us and cheered us on. You will never know what it has meant to our family.\n\nxoxo,\n\nBrooke Greiner\n\nCEO"
