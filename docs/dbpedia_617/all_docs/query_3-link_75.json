        "text": "Imma go and seize the moment\n\nCause tomorrows never promised if you haven′t noticed\n\nUsed to live up in the past I was at my lowest\n\nPoint in life I had no goals and I wasn't focused\n\nNow I′m in a better place in my head\n\nI feel the peace of Jesus Christ my daily bread\n\nIs from the maker of this life I'm feeling led\n\nTo spread the truth even despite of what they said\n\nJesus ain't real\n\nThat′s a lie from the pit I renounce that\n\nImma talk bout my King till he comes back\n\nAint a spirit or a demon getting me off track\n\nIf it′s a spirit from below then I'll send it back\n\nDown to the pits of hell where they all belong\n\nAnd you can do it too just trust In God he′s very strong\n\nHe'll take away the pain and all the hurt until it′s gone\n\nThe victory was set in stone just think back to the cross\n\nWe will fly away like blue jays\n\nWe will fly away in due time\n\nBut right now we're walking by faith\n\nPick our cross up every day\n\nWe will fly away like blue jays\n\nWe will fly away in due time\n\nBut right now we′re walking by faith\n\nPick our cross up every day\n\nA lot of y'all are scared to die\n\nI used to feel the same way until I died with him\n\nLooked my old self in the mirror then I said goodbye\n\nGot baptized in the spirit now he lives within\n\nAnd thinking back to the past I don't recognize\n\nMyself in the slightest when I delighted in sin, yeah\n\nI did a 180 straight to God\n\nAway from shame away from death he really changed my mind\n\nA new creation in his kingdom now I feel alive\n\nThe one sheep that is lost I pray that you find\n\nYour Shepard′s looking for you\n\nEvery day and every night he′s really fighting for you\n\nAnd not a day goes by where he don't think about you\n\nAnd you can change your life today I know you got it in you\n\nJust love the Lord with all your heart and he will make you anew"
