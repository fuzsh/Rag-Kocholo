Sydney Morning Herald [Chenoweth] does much more . . . than simply make sense of the tangled transactions and furtive finances of his protagonists, the book’s great achievement being its ability to weave its disparate strands into a broader narrative that takes in the political and cultural spheres as well as the corporate. This is a book about the shifting sands of the power structure within Australian society. Australian Book Review Chenoweth has performed for us . . . a literary pillorying where he, happy man, gets to throw all the ordure and the rotten vegies. It is deeply cathartic and satisfying.

New York Times The book delivers an adrenaline kick roughly equivalent to the thrill of rifling through Murdoch’s PalmPilot and opening his mail. It’s all here, every murky deal, every sworn enemy, every shocking lawsuit, every clever acquisition, every cynical rationlization, every accounting trick, every family crisis. Conspiracy theorists, beware: Chenoweth could be addictive. Columbia Journalism Review Superb, comprehensive . . . Chenoweth’s book is so overpowering that it calls into question the dedication of Murdoch’s previous biographers, notably William Shawcross, whose 1992 book lacked much of the meat Chenoweth unearthed. Newsday, New York (Reviewer Jes Ledbetter, business editor of TIME Europe) Anyone interested in the power plays, Byzantine manoeuverings, personal vendettas, macho posturings, and megamedia mergers of the ‘masters of the information revolution’ will be impressed by the author’s wide-ranging knowledge and deft handling of the mysteries of high finance. Washington Times Who better than a hard-bitten Australian investigative journalist to tell the story of the Dirty Digger himself? This well-informed account of the rise and rise of Rupert Murdoch has more dramatic twists than a Jeffrey Archer novel: it is terrific stuff, with edge-of-the-seat deals, financial scandals, and colourful bit-part players ranging from Bill Gates to Tony Blair. Chenoweth not only profiles an extraordinary man, part gambler, part megalomaniac, but elucidates the key role played by the Murdochowned News Corporation in the global information revolution.

Its focus is not the activities of the Packer family. Rather, it is about the people who from time to time have managed to find a seat at the Packer table. It follows the varying fortunes of some of these dinner guests. I am deeply grateful for the assistance and friendship of Shraga Elam, whose work has had such a dramatic effect on the way offshore trading is understood in Australia; of Ali Cromie, who mixes outstanding investigative skills with a rare generosity of spirit; and Andrew Main, Colleen Ryan and Rosemarie Graffagnini at the Australian Financial Review. Deborah Light started me on this book by lending me her copy of Corporate Cannibals, which I have cunningly managed to avoid returning.

Adversity faces him on every side, even his own friends look at him askance and he must take matters into his own hands to strike out boldly in new directions. Moments, in short, when he has no other course but to book into a thoroughly expensive luxury hotel. As Trevor Kennedy flew into Heathrow airport in November 2003, he was facing one of those moments. In the early hours of Saturday morning, London is a cheerless desert for the lone wayfarer. Friendless, fatigued and forlorn, Kennedy made the best of it and headed for a friendly haven. He took himself to Piccadilly and booked into the Ritz. For just on a century, the Ritz has been a beacon for weary travellers. It offers quiet elegance, historical glamour and an uptown address. Since the renovations in the late 1990s, its superior suites have offered an even more disgraceful level of opulence and comfort. A deluxe hotel room is a wondrous thing. It offers reassurance, entertainment, refreshment and rather a lot of soft furnishings. The interior designers had done their work with such steely determination that whatever disaster, mayhem or carnage may unfold in the room, it will always be against a backdrop of good taste and a fine colour scheme.\n\nT\n\n1\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 2\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nKennedy, always one to mind his pennies, appears to have settled for a basic room, a ‘Superior Single’ in Ritz-speak—which still says a lot, even though the Ritz saves its best work for the ‘Super King’ and ‘Deluxe King’. The Ritz claims no two of its rooms are alike, which only goes to show how many different things you can do with blue, yellow, peach and pink. The details are important, because there must surely be some hint in the decor to explain the debacle that followed. As Kennedy was shown up to his room on 1 November, he was hours away from doing something desperately silly. That’s the downside of hotel rooms, which they never mention in the brochure. For all their comfort, they’re hellishly dangerous. It’s a truth about hotels that anxious mothers and head porters have known for millennia. Peril lurks among the bath towels, disaster beckons from the clothes’ cabinet. We will not speak of the bar fridge. Strange and dire things happen in hotel rooms, and the further you are from home, the more dangerous life in one can become. It’s not a physical danger. It’s just that alone in a hotel room many people feel an overpowering urge to be . . . indiscreet. They do things which the next morning they wish they hadn’t. To be fair, Kennedy had a grave disadvantage when facing personal catastrophe: he was a former media executive. Worse than that, he was a former journalist. It’s a measure of the man, though, that he had surmounted these natural disabilities to become, at sixty-one years of age, a pillar of Sydney society. Everybody liked Trevor. He had a larrikin charm and a bullish vitality, tempered with a rather inept and endearing manner when he was trying to please, which carried him over many hurdles. It was also rather comforting that Trevor was no oil painting. He had the balding head and heavy glasses that go with a caricature of a chartered accountant, which he wasn’t. Under stress he had a habit of patting down his remaining hair at the back, as if to ensure his head had not fallen off. But behind the appearance, Trevor Kennedy was smart, and he was decisive. In his forties he had run Kerry Packer’s 2\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 3\n\nIntroduction\n\nmedia and investment empire for six years. He had survived an acrimonious split from Packer in 1991, and in a town where Packer’s network often decided who succeeded and who failed, he had thereafter rebuilt his contacts and his life and made his fortune. In the course of reinventing himself, Kennedy had become the quintessential Sydney success story of the 1990s. He was everything a senior member of Sydney society’s A-list should be: a seamless combination of money, power and presence. Kennedy moved effortlessly in so many worlds. He had extensive political contacts. He sat on the board of Qantas. As chairman of Oil Search he effectively controlled most of the oil and gas resources of Papua New Guinea. When he was a hot prospect to head the ABC in 2002, even the prime minister was rooting for Trevor. Kennedy knew everyone. But as it turned out, not everyone really knew Trevor. Which is how he came to be booking into the Ritz at a godforsaken time on a Saturday morning in late 2003. Two days before, on Thursday 30 October, Kennnedy had picked up a copy of the newspaper on which he had worked more than thirty years ago, the Australian Financial Review, to find details of his Swiss bank accounts splashed across the front page. A year before, he had written to the Zurich District Attorney’s office about these accounts. Israeli journalist Shraga Elam had obtained copies of his letters, which were now plastered across the Financial Review. It was all there: his careful descriptions of how he kept no records of his Swiss bank dealings in Australia, his multiple accounts, and his horror that the information would be revealed to Australian authorities: ‘This would be catastrophic for me and totally unjust.’ The revelations continued on the Friday as the Financial Review published further damning material about secret share trading by Kennedy’s friend Rene Rivkin. The trading was the key to a corporate whodunnit called Offset Alpine—a tangled story of a printing press, a fire, an insurance payout and a 3\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 4\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nmultimillion-dollar money trail that led to Zurich. Mixed in with that was another, darker tale about the murder of a Sydney model. As a solid press phalanx gathered outside both men’s houses, Kennedy made his move. He booked a flight to London, slipped past the press cordon around his home and headed for the airport. Late on the Friday afternoon a Daily Telegraph journalist spotted him in the departure lounge at Mascot. Kennedy was on his way to Zurich . . . via London. It would add six hours of flying time to his journey, but it would ensure anonymity. He would stay Saturday night at the Ritz, then fly to Switzerland on Sunday or Monday. As passport control at Zurich does not stamp passports on internal European flights, his passport would show only that he arrived in Britain. On Monday morning he would walk the few streets from his hotel in Zurich to the offices of his Swiss lawyer, Benno Hafner, on Genferstrasse. Kennedy had left instructions with his secretary in Sydney to work out the meeting time. The first piece of bad news for Kennedy when he got to the Ritz was that Hafner couldn’t see him on Monday because he wouldn’t be there. Hafner was in Geneva and was then travelling on to Paris. Tuesday was the earliest he could meet Kennedy. Until then Kennedy had nowhere to go, and nothing to do but wait. He was tired, jetlagged and anxious, and stranded at the Ritz for three days. Back in Australia, the Financial Review had published a third instalment of the story, including copies of cheques, share-trading ledgers and bank statements from a Swiss account operated by Labor Party powerbroker Graham Richardson. The Financial Review kept referring to other names in the documents. This is the point where hotel decor becomes an issue. It’s one thing for the weary traveller to hang up his boots gratefully for the night at the local hostelry. It’s another thing when there is nowhere else to go. Kennedy had business that kept him occupied through Saturday, but then there was Saturday night, then Sunday, and all Monday. He would not fly to Zurich until Tuesday morning. There he was, stuck in a tastefully decorated 4\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 5\n\nIntroduction\n\nbox for seventy-two hours. Disoriented by jetlag. Nowhere to go, doing the little things you do in a strange hotel room: trying the television, turning off the television, checking the bar fridge, looking through the complimentary toiletries, calling room service. And all the time thinking about the crisis that had brought him here. He had made it quite clear to the Zurich DA’s office the previous year, when he was interviewed as part of an investigation into embezzlement by an executive at Bank Leumi le-Israel, that he thought it was terribly unfair he should be dragged into the affair. He had done nothing wrong. He was the victim of an embezzlement. It was Bank Leumi’s fault for not overseeing their people as they should. ‘Why do I have to be the victim of their incompetence?’ he had said. He would repeat it unhappily two weeks after the Financial Review story in 2003, when he resigned all his public directorships, including his board seats at Qantas and Oil Search, giving up nearly half a million dollars in director fees: ‘I believe I have done nothing unlawful,’ he said. The worst thing was, Kennedy had no copies of his Swiss correspondence in Australia—‘I kept absolutely no records,’ he told the DA—so he could not even be sure whether the quotes in the Financial Review were right or wrong. The Offset Alpine affair had unfolded more than eight years before, after which anyone’s memory would grow fuzzy. While no one knows what was going through Kennedy’s mind in the hotel room, it had to be a mixture of anger, indignation, and something close to panic. There is a certain inevitability in the sequence of events that followed. As he was looking and pacing, Kennedy found himself at one of the handsome Georgian writing desks that grace each room of the Ritz. They are really quite comfortable and very amenable to writing. What could be more natural than to take up the handy pen lying there, and to scribble down some rough notes on the pad of Ritz notepaper about what happened in the Offset Alpine saga, so as to get it straight in his own mind? Kennedy the journalist was 5\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 6\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\ntaking over. He grew up living with the written word. Writing is the apologetic of the modern celebrity. I exist, therefore I write and am written about. And that fierce obsession to impress his own order upon the world, to take control of the story, kept him going for a page of dot points until he ran short of inspiration and returned to brooding. At least that’s how I see it. I had been trying for weeks to puzzle out the inner psyche of Trevor John Kennedy. Along the way the Financial Review team had given him a codename. It was a pathetic attempt at secrecy, to keep the details of our investigation secret in that most public of spaces, the middle of a major newsroom. Trevor Kennedy we called Kevin—Big Kev. Rene Rivkin was Ralph. No one ever found a repeatable nickname for Graham Richardson. He was referred to as the Other Guy, or He Who Must Not Be Named. Or just Richo. Some of Kennedy’s jottings were cryptic; others hard to read. There was a name and also a telephone number. Later, Kennedy would tell the Australian Federal Court that his dominant purpose in making the notes was to ask legal advice from Hafner—a claim which the Court of Appeal rejected. Whatever the reason for writing, when Kennedy checked out of the Ritz on Tuesday 4 November he ripped the page out and took it with him. Then, like the seasoned traveller he was, he slipped the notepad with the Ritz letterhead into his bag as well. He flew to Zurich in the fever dream of international travel and wrote another page of dot points on Hotel Florhof notepaper. Those days were ‘just a blur in my mind,’ he said later. While he would remember making the notes, he had no idea when he did it. Back in Sydney, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission had launched an investigation into the Financial Review revelations. After negotiations with editor Glenn Burge, ASIC subpoenaed me under Section 19 of the ASIC Act to give sworn evidence in a private examination on Thursday 6 November. The orders required me to produce the Swiss documents obtained 6\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 7\n\nIntroduction\n\nby Shraga Elam, which were the basis of the Financial Review stories. In later conversations ASIC officers asked for home and office addresses for Rivkin, Richardson and Kennedy. It was clear the next step would be search warrants. ‘You don’t have to be Einstein to work that out,’ Justice Roger Gyles commented later in the Federal Court. Kennedy flew back into Sydney on Monday 10 November. Three days later, at 7.25 on Thursday morning, the Australian Federal Police appeared at his home. The visit would have been perfectly straightforward—as it was in other searches taking place across the city at the Rivkin and Richardson homes, their offices and Rivkin’s luxury boat, the Dajoshadita—except that Trevor and Christina Kennedy didn’t answer the door. The three Federal Police officers despatched to the house in Elamang Avenue, Kirribilli, rang the bell for ten minutes without result. In subsequent witness statements they said that eventually they concluded no one was home and called their office to arrange for a private locksmith to open the door. This meant further delays, calling in state police to supervise. The rest of the search team, who had been waiting discreetly around the corner, now emerged. For the next hour, nine Federal Police and ASIC officers milled about in front of the house while they waited for reinforcements and the locksmith. It turned out the locksmith would not be needed, for Trevor and Christina were inside. Trevor had called his law firm, Atanaskovic Hartnell. Lance Sachs, a mergers and acquisitions partner who had never met Kennedy but who happened to be free and in at work early, was despatched in a taxi to Elamang Avenue to supervise the search and advise the Kennedys of their rights. Until Sachs showed up, his clients were perfectly entitled to sit quietly and wait for their lawyer. In the meantime, the police waiting outside were not aware of the Kennedys’ presence. Across Sydney, media organisations were hearing the first whispers that a major police search operation was underway. In the following hours press cordons would form outside the homes of Rivkin, Richardson and Kennedy. By that stage they must have 7\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 8\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nbeen becoming used to it. ‘From the moment [the Financial Review story] appeared there were television cameras, photographers, journalists stalking my house, my office, my family,’ Kennedy later told ASIC officers. ‘If you haven’t been through one of these things, I wouldn’t expect you to understand, but let me tell you, it’s a hell of an experience.’ Actually, by now Rivkin, Richardson and Kennedy were no longer the main story. The rumour machine at the big end of town had moved on from the revelations about the three amigos to speculate on what other names the Financial Review was sitting on. There were two other big names to come out in Rivkin’s Zurich network. No, it was eight. Then twelve. Sixteen. Rivkin had had fifty numbered client accounts in the 1980s, including some of the biggest names in politics. The speculation made little difference to Trevor Kennedy. He had spent much of the previous two weeks in limbo: killing time in hotel rooms, airport departure lounges, lawyers’ offices and now this final indignity beside his wife in their silent house, with the police at the door. What emotions and thoughts gripped the Kennedys during this latest interlude only they knew. To an outside observer the issue is a simpler one: how had it come to this? How had one of the most powerful figures in Australian business been reduced to such a peculiar position? What did the Swiss bank documents mean, and how had so many people come to be caught up with them? This book follows the trail of events in the 1990s which led up to the awkward scene at the Kennedy home. It is about the rivers of power and influence which shape Australian society, and the people who navigate them. The Offset Alpine scandal was something more than a ruckus about some questionable share trading. This was about a way of life. A whole class of business figures was accustomed to operating in the world of nominee companies and blind trusts in the Bahamas, Liechtenstein, Hong Kong, Monaco, the British Virgin Islands, the Dutch Antilles and Switzerland as 8\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 9\n\nIntroduction\n\ndeftly as they plied Australia’s social networks. It is the side of Australian business that no one talks about. It is not necessarily illegal or improper. But it is a world of perilous secrets, a private universe divided between winners and losers: those who dine out on the rewards and those who become part of the menu. In an age of conspicuous consumption, the richest pickings were often found on the edges of orthodox deals made by the Packer family. Even a crumb from a Packer deal could hoist a minor player many rungs up the economic food chain. The feeding pattern in this secret world played out against a wider tapestry, as Australia came to terms with a new economic order at the turn of the millennium. The excesses of the 1980s had left the country’s old institutions crumbling; the new institutions that would take their place were still forming. A wider generational transfer of power among an ageing population of Australians hung in the balance. The book begins with the incident in 1990 when Kerry Packer signalled that the party was over; a landmark moment which nonetheless provided a lifeline for shipwrecked corporate survivors of the 1980s. The story then casts back further still to sketch the origins of the three amigos and how they came to play such key roles in the networks which flowed around the Packers in the rollercoaster ride of the 1990s; a voyage from the edge of disaster to resounding triumph and back again, as it all turned bad once more; and the denouement which led to the unhappy tableau at Elamang Avenue in November 2003. The stand-off outside Kennedy’s house lasted little more than an hour. Sachs showed up in a taxi at 8.30, and after some discussion the search team was allowed into the house forty-five minutes later. An hour into the search the federal agents reached the room the family called Trevor’s Den. There on the desk they found the two pages of notes that Kennedy had written in London and Zurich. The man who had told the Zurich DA ‘I keep nothing in writing’ had broken his own rule. The Ritz notepad, which could be expected to retain faint impressions of what had been 9\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 10\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nwritten on the pages torn off, was also on the desk. The agents put it all in evidence bags and took them downstairs to the property search register, which Kennedy duly signed. It would be four days later when he first claimed the notes carried legal privilege; and three months before he remembered that the two pages were written in different hotels, 700 kilometres apart. After thirteen months of court battles Kennedy’s lawyers got the blank notepad back, arguing it was not covered by the terms of the search warrant, but failed to retrieve the notes themselves. In December 2004 the Federal Court of Appeal finally gave ASIC unfettered access to the two pages of notes in which Kennedy discussed his role in the Offset Alpine affair in his own handwriting. With bullet points. They already had a copy of the computer hard drive from Kennedy’s city office, which contained 12 000 references to Rivkin and several mentions of Bank Leumi officers. Now if ASIC investigators could untangle the cryptic comments in the notes, they hoped they had a smoking gun.\n\n10\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 11\n\nONE\n\nBack in the saddle July–October 1990 t was always going to be a bad day, from the moment the white 7-series BMW pulled up at the gatehouse. Some quick conversation followed, then the boom rose. Too late. Even as the security guard picked up the phone to call ahead, the Beemer with the ‘KP’ licence plates was through and following the driveway past the cluster of production cottages and the huge studios to pull up with its nose just outside the glass reception doors. The big man swung out and strode inside, leaving the car door ajar behind him. The Australian television industry had just entered a new era. Kerry Packer was back. He was early. Eleven days before, on 19 July 1990, the shareholders in Bond Media, the nearly bankrupt company that owned the Nine Network, had approved a deal which wiped out most of the company’s capital and gave control of Nine back to Packer, three years after he had sold it to Alan Bond. But Packer wasn’t supposed to show up for another month. Or at least another week. His staff had said so. In any half-normal world Packer would still be on the polo circuit, whizzing through money in Argentina. Everyone at the Channel Nine headquarters at Willoughby was braced for the fireworks that were inevitable upon his arrival. But, please God, not yet. Not at 7.30 in the morning. The stream of\n\nI\n\n11\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 12\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nNine executives who made their appearance at more conventional times would discover there was something worse than Kerry Packer making an unannounced visit. It was to arrive at their office and find he was already there. The most obvious change in the three years since Packer had left was the foyer. Along with the glass doors, Bond Media chief Sam Chisholm appeared to have secured Australia’s entire supply of aqua-green marble. Then there was the glass-sided lift that took executives to a new top floor, which Chisholm had decorated with all the marble left over from the foyer. It was referred to as ‘The Palace’, or the ‘Green Latrine’. ‘I can’t believe all that foyer is real,’ wrote television anchor and columnist Peter Luck. ‘Do Laminex do that stuff?’ When Sam celebrated his fiftieth birthday the year before, Nine management had arranged to buy him a Harley-Davidson—then taken out part of the wall and the roof so they could drop the bike in on a cherry picker at the appropriate moment. That now looked a little extravagant. For weeks, Nine had been abuzz with talk of the cost cuts Packer was going to introduce. Packer had been overseas with the polo ponies and it was left to the managing director of Packer’s Consolidated Press Holdings group, Trevor Kennedy, to give the official line to the Sydney Morning Herald: ‘It is all just gossip and speculation. I can tell you that no decisions have been made yet . . . The last thing we need, in view of the fragile state of morale, is a story getting around that those bloody madmen from Park Street are going to come charging in creating havoc.’ That was before Monday 30 July, when Kerry Packer showed up in person, after which Kennedy’s assurances seemed a little beside the point. Packer took to the task with the same steady commitment that Alaric the Goth must have shown when the road map of Italy told him he was getting close to Rome. Packer knew a lot about television—probably more than anyone else in the country. But he held 12\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 13\n\nBack in the saddle\n\nno illusions about it. The story was told of Packer in the mid-1980s, sitting silently through a story conference for a soap opera, finally turning to tell the group as he left: ‘If it doesn’t rate, you’re all fired. If it does rate, it’s still a heap of shit.’ Packer was a natural. He was dyslexic, which meant writing had little appeal for him. But television was a whole different category. Sydney is a loud town. For three decades, the ninety-metre television broadcast tower at Willoughby had given whoever owned it the loudest voice in the city, and in Australia. Nine was the ultimate megaphone and the Packers had always been its rightful owners, apart from three bad years when Alan Bond had minded it for them. ‘How many television stations do you own, son?’ was Kerry Packer’s regular rejoinder to nosey journalists and inquisitive shareholders. In a town where everyone had their own private raison d’être, the Packer family credo was simple: We own television stations, therefore we are. You may not see us, but we’re with you, all day until the station identification screen comes up around 3 a.m. We’ll be back with you after this commercial message. Kerry Packer was never meant to be a mogul. His elder brother Clyde was the one groomed to be the heir. But Clyde quarrelled with their father, Sir Frank Packer, in 1971. Clyde had a lifestyle change and took to wearing a caftan—which on someone the size of the Packer men is a garment that can cover several smallish suburbs—before moving to California. Sir Frank died fifteen months later, in 1972, and Kerry bought his brother’s half-share in Consolidated Press for $4 million. In the two decades since then, Kerry Packer had done three big deals. In 1982, he paid $218 million to privatise Consolidated Press Holdings. Four years later, he sold part of it, the Nine Network, to Alan Bond for $1.05 billion. As Packer put it in 1990, ‘You only get an Alan Bond once in your life.’ Actually this was arguable, because the month before he had bought a coupon-inserts business in the United States called Valassis Communications on which he would make an even bigger 13\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 14\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nprofit. The return from those three deals—privatising Cons Press, selling Nine and buying Valassis—would eventually be worth $5 billion to Packer. But Packer’s real skill was not in making money. It was in holding on to it. This is why he was so unhappy with Alan Bond. Packer is a cash kind of guy, but when Bond bought the Nine Network in 1987, he slipped some funny money into the deal. Packer would get the last $220 million only in 1990, when a bunch of preference shares that Bond Media issued to him as part of the sale fell due to be paid out. Unfortunately, by the time 1990 came around, all three Australian commercial television networks were in desperate trouble after overspending on programming just as the advertising market collapsed. Bond Media was broke, and Alan Bond couldn’t pay Packer the money he owed him. If one thing distinguishes Kerry Packer’s attitude towards money, it is his ability to imitate a limpet. However much he may spend on his own private pursuits—and his personal expenses have at times ranged between $50 million and $100 million a year— when it comes to business, the philanthropy stops at the door of the Packer compound in Bellevue Hill. Yet here was Alan Bond, with all his arms and legs still attached, owing Packer $220 million. Packer is not one for bottling up his emotions. While he might have preferred a more immediate revenge upon Bond, in the end Packer settled for a deal to convert his $220 million debt into shares and options that gave him 60 per cent of Bond Media, which would be renamed Nine Network Australia. It would prove a stunning coup, but that didn’t mean the Big Fellow was happy. ‘Congratulations, gentlemen, you are now in charge of a company with no money,’ Packer growled when he welcomed a ‘pretty motley lot’ of new directors, as he described them, on to the board in November 1990. Packer was so unexcited about Nine that he sold his options to fund managers the following year. The fund managers made a $500 million profit from the options and the new shares cut Packer’s stake to 40 per cent. Even if reclaiming 14\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 15\n\nBack in the saddle\n\nthe Nine Network for a modest $220 million had been Packer’s plan all along—a line that would become part of the Packer myth—he showed every sign of wanting to have his money back as well. This set up a simple dynamic for every encounter that Packer had on that first day back at Nine on 30 July. He had lost $220 million, and every person he met at Willoughby was responsible. He wanted his money back. All of it. Preferably from each of them. The first intimation Nine’s head of current affairs, Ian Frykberg, had that the world had changed came when he turned a corner and saw Packer advancing on him. Packer poked him in the stomach and growled, ‘Hey, pudgy, why don’t you lose some weight?’ At least that was the gist. Then he was gone, sailing down the corridor as other desperate executives racked their brains for ways—any way—to cope with the stress of confronting a deeply unhappy Kerry Francis Bullmore Packer. Wonderful stories emerged of the desperate days that followed. The more excitable members of staff recalled that when Packer first appeared he was about eight metres tall. More conservative observers suggested his height was no more than 6.5 metres. In the first hours some fool of an accountant told Packer that Nine’s drinking bill was running at more than $10 000 a month. Rather than congratulating the Nine crew on their superior taste and character in refusing to drink anything cheap or that came in cardboard, Packer took draconian steps. He broke the ghastly news to the troops at a late-morning meeting: Nine would be going dry. From now on, no alcohol would be allowed on the premises. A mail boy was despatched with a trolley and two security guards to search out and remove all the booze from the fridges. In that dark hour the noble minds that fill the senior ranks of the television industry had their finest moment. Adversity brings out the best in us. The steady clinking noise of the approaching trolley triggered extraordinary undercover manoeuvres as Nine executives struggled to hide bottles in the boots of their cars. 15\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 16\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nFor the soft-hearted, sensitive types who run television networks, this was an admirable, disinterested gesture—a Hollywood-style rescue operation somewhere between The Scarlet Pimpernel and Free Willy. At least it seemed that way after the second or third bottle. Stalked by the world’s largest teetotaller, not all the booze made it to freedom. During a tour of one section at Nine, Kerry Packer is said to have stormed into a recently vacated room to find a fine bottle of white sitting alone on the table. It was probably a chardonnay, quite likely rather a good one, although no one had the chance to find out after Packer supposedly picked up the bottle and hurled it across the room towards the sink. The most brutal casualty was lunch. Henceforth, Packer ordered, one hour was the most that any executive could take to restore the tissues. Willoughby went into shock. On some outings, it could take longer than that just travelling to and from the restaurant. Nine was a culture that lunched not wisely but too well. It was Nine’s chief executive Sam Chisholm who had decreed, ‘Losers have meetings, winners have parties.’ But everyone had lunch. Chisholm himself—once described as the greatest luncher in Sydney’s history—had been a formative influence on Sydney’s restaurant scene. His patronage had helped elevate Darcy’s, Imperial Peking and Tre Scalini into the city’s hottest lunching spots, before he insisted on similar quality cuisine for the Channel Nine boardroom. ‘Sam was a social animal—he didn’t have to have a reason to lunch,’ Graham Richardson later told David Dale. ‘He spent an extraordinary amount of Kerry Packer’s money, which Kerry didn’t mind because Sam got results. You always started with Cristal [champagne that is, at $300 a bottle], and then the best whites and reds.’ From a legendary luncher like Richardson this was praise indeed. Admittedly, not everyone at Nine ventured as far as Chisholm. Media people always seem to gravitate to Chinese restaurants, maybe as a subconscious reminder of all those nights 16\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 17\n\nBack in the saddle\n\nhaving to eat takeaway food. But lavish corporate hospitality had become part of the Nine culture—and part of Sydney’s culture as well. And now Packer was raging around Willoughby like the Spirit of Anti-Lunch itself. Inevitably, Packer’s trajectory through Nine brought him up against the chief luncher. Sam Chisholm had run the Nine Network since the mid-1970s. The power he wielded in Sydney society reflected not merely his position at Nine but also his skills as a superb networker. As a raconteur he had the uncanny ability to put his finger on just the spot where someone else is ridiculous. Like his celebrated disdain in the late 1990s for the managing director of Telstra—he wasn’t really called Ziggy Switkowski, Sam would claim gravely, he was John Smith but the poor fellow was just so boring that he made up a funny name so at least he would have one interesting thing about him. The story was so Sam, so full of brio for a man whose parents christened him Hewlings. That would be the plural of Hewling. Suggesting many Hewlings, perhaps a pack of Hewlings. It’s an easy name to forget. Whoever filled in the company forms for directors for the Channel Nine group in the late 1980s put him down in company after company as Samuel Howlings Chisholm. On a slow news day in 1995, I duly reported this fact in the Australian Financial Review’s ‘Rear Window’ column. Fairfax cartoonist Rod Clement drew a picture of two wolfmen baying at the moon while holding a baby over their heads. The caption read, ‘The birth of Samuel Howlings Chisholm is celebrated in the traditional family manner’. I realised the mistake the next day and briefly considered running a correction. A further search of company records revealed that an alternative misspelling of the name was Samuel Mewlings Chisholm. Middle names. Now there’s a thing. John Atanaskovic, one of Sydney’s most respected corporate lawyers, would probably kill for a middle name like Hewlings. Instead he is saddled with Ljubomir. Television interviewer Jana Wendt has been called 17\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 18\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nmany things—the Perfumed Steamroller, the Smiling Assassin— but rarely her middle name and her mother’s favourite, Bohumila. Like Hewlings, this one also doesn’t get a lot of airplay, but it is helpful to remember that in the theme song of The Lion King, which begins ‘In the jungle / The mighty jungle / The lion sleeps tonight’, the chorus in the background is chanting, ‘Bohumila, Bohumila’. There’s a sad music in the names Ljubomir and Bohumila, a whole tragic opera waiting to be written. Four weeks after Packer appeared at Willoughby, Chisholm was gone, taking up a job offer from Rupert Murdoch to fix his troubled Sky satellite television business in Britain. Bohumila announced Sam’s departure on A Current Affair. Two days before Chisholm resigned, Packer sacked forty-seven staff. It was ‘the end of a golden era’, 60 Minutes executive producer Peter Meakin said as he packed up. ‘Kerry’s let everyone know he’s back, and good on him. We’re all back at boarding school. Now he can stop climbing the mast and doing King Kong impressions.’ Five weeks later, on 3 October, another seventy staff at Nine were retrenched, along with thirty-one from its satellite racing channel Sky Television. And then, four days after that, everything was turned upside down when Kerry Packer died on horseback during a polo game. Just past 3 p.m. on Sunday 7 October, three minutes into the first chukka at Warwick Farm racecourse, Packer clutched his chest and pitched forward on his horse. It was a classic drop-dead heart attack. A fatal arrhythmia had disrupted the timing mecanism for his heart muscles, triggering acute ventricular failure. And just like that, the most powerful man in Australia was dying. Accounts of the frenzied moments that followed had a strange, slow-motion quality. James Packer, in his position at goal defence, saw his father slump down and rode towards him. The ambulance officers on the sideline were reacting, too slowly, to the shouts for help. Kerry Packer hung there unconscious on the horse, his arms locked tight in a death grip around its neck. Three minutes 18\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 19\n\nBack in the saddle\n\nwithout oxygen and brain damage begins, so the question was how fast could the paramedics get across there and begin heart massage. The adrenalin started to surge through James Packer as he began to realise what he was facing. In those seconds, as he reached his father and tried to unlock the motionless arms and get the body down off the horse, the future hung in the balance. James Packer was not ready to step into his father’s shoes. He didn’t know it but the Packers had their own financial crisis building just over the horizon, and it would hit them in the middle of the following year, 1991. This was the turning point, this moment on the horse. Not just for the House of Packer, but for the future of Australian business, for politics, for media—indirectly for the culture itself. Everything that Packer would do in the next decade—and not just Packer, but the networks and social ecosystems that fed off the Packer money mine—was about to fall to nothing on this field. It wasn’t only Packer, it was a generation of business idols that was facing annihilation. Rupert Murdoch’s empire was in crisis. Three days earlier, News Corporation’s new finance director, David DeVoe, had told the group’s bankers in London that News could not meet its debt repayments. Robert Holmes à Court had died three weeks before. Westpac would put the Lowy family’s Ten Network into receivership within days, the Fairfax group would go into receivership a month later. The Seven Network had been in receivership for a year and its former owner, Qintex boss Christopher Skase, was already giving hints in Majorca that he was feeling a little chesty when Australian authorities raised the subject of him coming home. Larry Adler had died two years before, leaving his son Rodney to cope with his inheritance, FAI Insurances, which was arguably next to insolvent. Warren Anderson was sliding towards crisis. Laurie Connell was facing court in Western Australia over the Rothwell collapse, John Spalvins would not be able to save Adelaide Steamship, Brian Yuill was facing 19\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 20\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\ncharges over looting the Spedley group, Bruce Judge was long gone from Ariadne, while Alan Bond was fighting off the banks with the resourcefulness of a human eel. There were also the mortally wounded politicians like John Cain in Victoria and Brian Burke in Western Australia, the crippled building societies and friendly societies, and the state banks—the State Bank of Victoria, Tricontinental, and the State Bank of South Australia. And then there were the major banks . . . While he had given no outward sign, Packer had been experiencing heart problems for months. It was only a matter of time before the big attack came along. The truth is, when he descended on Channel Nine in July he was a dead man walking. But then, so was everybody else in town. Every 1980s entrepreneur in the country was struggling to survive what had become a form of economic genocide, a sort of socio-economic house-cleaning. It was the end of the generation that came to power too early.\n\nO Something profound happened to Australia in the 1970s and 1980s that changed the way we live. It began with the Vietnam War. For more than two decades, Australia’s prosperity had been guarded by an international agreement signed at Bretton Woods in England in 1946, which fixed the world’s major currencies to the gold standard. International money flows were restricted and the West enjoyed low interest rates and low inflation. But Vietnam was an expensive war for the United States. Richard Nixon financed it by printing money. That set off inflation and forced the US to devalue the greenback. That adjustment spelt the end for the Bretton Woods agreement and broke the interlocking monetary system that had guided the West since World War II. It would take decades for the full effects to work through 20\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 21\n\nBack in the saddle\n\nbut, without fixed currencies, the whole world now supped from the same soup bowl. You could no longer quarantine a local economy or arbitrarily set a currency rate—at least not for long— without triggering a flight of capital. In the new world order, interest rates could no longer be fixed. The world was on a treadmill that kept pushing the effects of economic deregulation and rationalisation through each national economy. Coupled with the oil shock of 1973, that meant a decade and a half of high inflation. The effects on Australia’s class structure were profound. Put simply, if you were rich in 1970 and did not remake your fortune in the next two decades, by 1990 you were no longer rich. Over that period, inflation rose 300 per cent. But upmarket housing prices—comparing the same eastern Sydney suburbs from Rushcutters Bay to Vaucluse across twenty years— rose by up to 1500 per cent. If you take out the effect of inflation, then in real terms the increase in property values, including renovation and rebuilding, was up to 500 per cent. It wasn’t just the top end of town that was affected, this was a society-wide change. In 1970, people didn’t talk about property prices at dinner parties. Actually it’s hard to imagine what they would have talked about because two decades later they talked of nothing else. These were tough years for the Establishment, which had controlled Australian society for so long. Old networks of influence and interlocking directorships and club memberships were heavily tied to the traditional property model. The housing booms and busts proved lethal for the state banks and the finance companies and finally for the Big Four banks, on whose boards so many Establishment figures sat. The Establishment was in retreat, which was just fine for the one group that did very well out of this reorganisation. Australia has always had a divide between the mainstream business establishment and the adventurers and wide boys. Traditionally the latter has been a marginal group associated with mining stocks and minor property bubbles in a low-inflation, 21\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 22\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nlow-interest rate environment. They were mavericks, but they were containable. Economic deregulation and asset inflation now posed an exceptional opportunity for this group. They despised the hidebound Establishment. By the early 1980s, the mavericks had the flexibility and now the credit facilities to take charge. And they did. Bond and Skase and Holmes à Court and John Elliott and Judge and Yuill and Anderson and Connell and Spalvins and Larry Adler became the central players. Part of it was an age thing. Most of them were in their forties, born in the period from 1937 to 1946, the last cohort before the Baby Boomers arrived nine months after the end of World War II. They were twenty years younger than their Establishment rivals. They didn’t just challenge the Establishment—they wanted to buy it. And then it was all over. After the 1987 Stock-market Crash, almost every entrepreneur in Australia was living on borrowed time. The crippling high interest rates and credit squeeze that Treasurer Paul Keating introduced to kill off inflation, and the deep recession it triggered, did the rest (‘It’s a slowdown we had to have, which turned into a recession’). But it wasn’t just the big fish that were caught. The 1980s boom had created an entire infrastructure, an ecosystem of minor players who fed off the action—the facilitators, the technical specialists, those who did the warehouse deals, who advised, who did the trades—the journeymen of the asset boom. They too were sinking with no patrons and no oxygen line. That was why Kerry Packer was so important. He was the last great whale. His lucky sale of Nine to Bond meant he was the only major player who was cashed up when the Crash came. As a result, for the next decade he would be the biggest mobile source of capital in Australia. With all the 1980s entrepreneurs beached high and dry, Packer was the only major player still swimming. Now he seemed to be dying.\n\nO 22\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 23\n\nBack in the saddle\n\nThe epic story of the polo field rescue was plastered over the next day’s newspapers: the resuscitation gear that was on hand, which came to be called Packer Whackers; the ambulance trip to St Vincent’s Hospital; the helicopter flight to pick up Victor Chang, Packer’s surgeon. ‘He wanted to shake my hand, though I don’t think he liked seeing me,’ Dr Chang said later. By Monday Packer was sitting up in bed, barking instructions and signing documents. Professor Bob Baxt at the Trade Practices Commission wanted a word with him about the latest round of media intrigue, concerning the future of Nine’s rivals, Seven and Ten. It was business as usual. Australia’s king of television had barely missed a beat. Packer’s recovery would have enormous repercussions in the 1990s for Australia and particularly for Sydney, a town that is run by insiders. To sift through many of the headline events of the decade—from politics to casinos, from rugby league to telecommunications, along with every conceivable arm of the media industry—is to wonder at the decisive impact that one man’s life can have on a culture. A more subtle measure may be gained by surveying the ranks of Australia’s wealthy, measuring how many fortunes were achieved, to lesser or greater effect, by proximity to Packer. A multitude of alternative futures branched out from that moment when Packer suffered his heart attack on the polo pony. And yet the question of what might have happened in the end is immaterial. The episode on the horse was merely a sideshow in the larger drama. If you are looking for a pivotal moment in 1990 which showed the nature of the decade which would follow, I think you need to look at the day Packer returned to Channel Nine. I think it’s the lunch thing. It is the moment when Packer pronounced, more clearly than any other, that the wild times of the 1980s were over and would not return. The business rules had changed for everyone, not just for the power players and wheelers and dealers. The 1990s would be a decade where the networkers, the friends, the lunch partners and the school alumni 23\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 24\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nfought a rearguard action against the economic change that was engulfing them. What that meant for the network of players who floated around the Packers may be seen best through the careers of three men—Rene Rivkin, Graham Richardson and Trevor Kennedy—who had played such key roles in forging the network, and who had been largely mute figures in 1990 in the drama surrounding Packer. They were victims of the times as much as anybody. The 1990s would prove to be a marvellous escape act. To understand just how marvellous it was, one must first consider what they were escaping from.\n\n24\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 25\n\nPART ONE\n\nThe three amigos\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\nRUTH:\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 26\n\nOne moment!

James would be mentored in the following years by a succession of Consolidated Press executives, notably Al Dunlap and Brian Powers. In the meantime, James’s education had been in the hands of Packer’s old friend, Rene Rivkin. ‘So one day I get a phone call—“I’m sending my fucking son over and I want you to lose him some fucking money on the stock market so he understands the fucking value of the fucking dollar,”’ Rene Rivkin told Andrew Denton later. It turned out that Rivkin, that old legend of the bourse, had a couple of dubious investment ideas that would prove the very thing. He had a wealth of experience to share. For more than three decades, Rene Rivkin was the best-known figure in the Australian stock market. The tributes his friends paid to him after his tragic death in May 2005 reflected a man who, by dint of sheer personality and out-of-the-box charm, had made himself an Australian legend. Rivkin had a razor wit and a brand of outrageous repartee that was awfully difficult not to like.\n\nI\n\n27\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 28\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nHowever his legacy was flawed and his darker side, which had intermittently peeped out of hiding throughout his career, did finally reveal itself. If his rise to fame had been over the top, so too was his fall. The public disgrace that marred his last two years was no doubt exacerbated by his bipolar condition, his chronic overconsumption of Prozac and brain surgery, and he had to endure huge media coverage of his weekend detention sentence and ongoing investigations by regulators. Today, for all those who regard him as a hero or victim, there are others who see him as a villain. In fact, none of these labels gives credit to the man. His was a complex character, which is not so surprising in view of the history that shaped him. Rene Rivkin had an unconventional childhood. His father, Walter, was born in Georgia in 1917, a week before the Bolshevik revolution. As civil war gripped the country, Walter’s parents joined a stream of White Russians who fled to China. They settled in Shanghai, only to find that China too was facing waves of social upheaval. Shanghai was under occupation by the Japanese when Rene was born in 1944. By this time, Walter was in his late twenties and a successful trader, married to Rachel, who was born in Japan. Their well-to-do lifestyle, which revolved around the expatriate community at the Jewish Recreational Club, provided a buffer that left Rene and his younger brother Leonard oblivious to the wider events around them. Rene was barely a toddler when the Japanese surrendered. He was almost five years old when Mao Zedong’s communist army overran Shanghai, and seven when his father finally closed down their house, dismissed their twelve servants and moved the family to Sydney. While he never talked publicly about it, the links Rivkin forged with old China hands, such as Bart and Ronald Doff, celebrity real estate agents of Sydney’s eastern suburbs who were born in 1947 in Tientsin, would last a lifetime. Walter prospered in Australia by turning his hand to property development and building flats in eastern Sydney before investing in mining 28\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 29\n\nMixing with money\n\ncompanies. But it was nothing like the style of living the family had enjoyed in China. Rene went to Sydney Boys High where he ended up sharing a desk with a young English boy called Bruce Corlett. He and Rene had been together ‘pretty much every day since then’, Corlett told journalist Ali Cromie, who taped a remarkable series of interviews with Rivkin’s friends and associates in 1998, in the days when his friends still talked publicly about him. Corlett was as unlike Rene as it was possible to be, but he would stick with Rivkin through a lifetime of violent mood swings. It was ‘a very special relationship’ according to Rodney Adler, who was close to both men for more than a decade when he ran FAI Insurances. ‘Bruce is a man of great detail, very conservative, very proper,’ Adler told Cromie. ‘He’s a very good sounding board for Rene. He has a very good stabilising effect on Rene.’ This was a fair description, Corlett conceded to Cromie. ‘I can only assume that is why we talk as often as we do.’ ‘Bruce is as straight down the line as Rene is weird, they make a fairly odd couple in that sense . . . Bruce is a starchy, Royal Sydney Golf Club character, quite unlike Rene but they are good buddies and they trust each other,’ said Chris Walker, who was hired to write Rivkin’s biography in 1998, before Rene tired of the venture. ‘Corlett reckons Rene is a great bloke, straight as a die, honest, a terrific friend. But he does say he is a difficult fellow and has burnt almost all his friends.’ Another of Rivkin’s childhood friends was Robert Whyte, whose father was a paper merchant. Corlett and Rivkin went on to study law at Sydney University, where Whyte did an economics degree. Rivkin was already outrageous. Mallesons Stephen Jaques partner Graham Bates described Rivkin arriving at law classes each morning in the 1960s and parking right outside the door of the lecture hall, ignoring the parking tickets he would receive each day. Corlett made no waves, while Whyte was regarded as one of the nerdier students on campus. It was the mid-1960s and the three 29\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 30\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nfriends were in the middle of a social revolution to which they were oblivious. Instead they were fixed on ways to make money. Rivkin had already made up his mind about the value of the law. ‘I was always disappointed my father made me do law rather than commerce, but clearly there are times when I had to bullshit my way through,’ Rivkin later told Elle McFeast. ‘The school of life has been great, making money you don’t need a commerce degree. But there are times when you sit with business management and you definitely need bullshit.’ Whyte went on to work as a merchant banker with Schroders in London. Corlett stayed with the law for two years after he and Rivkin graduated in 1967, before moving into commerce. But Rene already had the trading bug. ‘I was a fourteen-year-old kid when I received in the mail a prospectus for United Telecasters, which was Channel Ten in those days,’ Rivkin said later. ‘I asked my father whether I should send the fifty quid in, and I did and four weeks later I made 150 per cent profit. And being a kid who liked money, I thought, “What better way to make money?”’ The most salient part of this anecdote is that Rivkin at fourteen had the equivalent of about $1500 of pocket money in today’s money to spend on a share flutter. By his own account it was a much indulged childhood in which the figure of his father, Walter, loomed very large. The contrast was between the chubby and indulged child who didn’t like sport, and the athletic and tempestuous father who had once been a boxing champion in Shanghai. ‘I didn’t like my father,’ Rivkin would say later. ‘I . . . I loved him, I think, but probably because I had to, because one’s supposed to love one’s father, but I didn’t like him. I adored him for the first twenty years . . . We were absolutely inseparable until [I was] twenty, or twenty-two, and after I became successful in my own right and, therefore, he appeared to lose control over me, I think that’s where the problem arose.’ The break appears to have coincided with Rene taking articles as a clerk at a city law firm. He said later his mother was so 30\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 31\n\nMixing with money\n\nconcerned about the distances he had to walk delivering documents she would spend days circling the block in a car, ready to drive him. Once he finished his articles in 1969, he moved into work at a stockbroking office, J and J Norths. A Norths partner, Michael Hobbs, took Rivkin with him as a junior partner when he left the firm soon after to start his own broking operation. It was spectacularly bad timing. The glamour mining stock Minsec collapsed in 1970, the market dived and, after trading for two months, Hobbs and Rivkin split. Rene was left with the company. Undeterred by the crashing mineral stocks, Rivkin became the laughing stock of the market in August 1970 when at the ripe age of twenty-six he paid a record $82 000 for a seat on the Sydney Stock Exchange. Actually, it was probably Walter who paid the $82 000 as Hobbs & Partners reopened its doors as Hobbs Rivkin & Partners in September 1970, and Rivkin started plying his father’s friends for work. Rene Rivkin’s secret life began almost immediately. ‘We had almost no clients,’ Rivkin later testified in Zurich, by which he meant no clients except his father’s friends. ‘But then there was a float. We deposited the proceeds from the float at Bank Leumi in Zurich.’ By ‘we’ Rivkin meant himself, his father, a mining partner of Walter’s who was also financing Rivkin, and a fourth investor he did not name. From then on, the Rivkins were a Swiss banking family, with separate accounts for father and son. Walter Rivkin appears to have treated it merely as a tax dodge. ‘My father was a very conservative investor, the exact opposite of myself,’ Rivkin said. ‘I knew that he only had bonds in his account.’ Walter had correspondence from Bank Leumi sent to his sisterin-law, Pauline Tribe, Rene testified: ‘He believed that was an adequate security measure.’ It was in 1970 that Rene met Gayle Perkins, a twenty-year-old from Brisbane who at one point had been going out with his brother, Leonard. Rene ‘was quite different from anyone I’d ever met before,’ Gayle told Australian Story in 2004. ‘He wasn’t 31\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 32\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nattractive, but he was definitely a very intelligent, interesting person. But he felt he had to be a success to be anyone, and I knew that.’ They married two years later, and by 1979 they had four children—Damien, Jordan and twins Shannon and Dion (a fifth child, Tara, was born in 1986). But these years were overshadowed by personal tragedy. Leonard had drowned in the surf at Bali at Christmas 1978—Rene later described it to Andrew Denton as a drug overdose. ‘That death was incredibly traumatic for the family,’ Gayle told Australian Story. Rene spent the next three years crying each morning in his shower, she said. Despite the turbulence in his private life, Rene Rivkin had become a player in the economic upheavals that unfolded in Australia in the 1970s. At times he would be rich, at other times he would be like a polar explorer scrambling for dear life as the ice pack split and disintegrated beneath his feet. The fabric of power and wealth that had underwritten Australia in the 1950s and ’60s was cracking. Rivkin was young, clever and not very scrupulous. As the old networks of the Establishment began their long, withering decline, Rivkin finally found himself winning the sort of professional and social respect that he had never received through his childhood and university years. There was a whole new breed of player out there. Stephen Tsung and Andrew Lakos joined Rivkin at the new broking firm, which became just Rivkin & Partners. But the young venture did not survive the 1973 oil shock and the worldwide recession it triggered. The All Ordinaries Index dipped below 200 as property group Mainline crashed. Cambridge Credit teetered for a time on the edge of the abyss before it too fell. Rivkin & Partners closed its doors in 1974. ‘Rivkin handled it badly,’ a friend said later. ‘He had an episode of depression and wanted to leave the country.’ But he rallied and headed back to the bourse, setting up a new venture, Rivkin and Co, with Brent Potts and Willie West. This effort was far more successful. It was during this period that Rivkin’s contact book 32\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 33\n\nMixing with money\n\n(back in the days before God created the BlackBerry) became the most extensive in town. ‘There is no doubt if you mix in the right circles, vis a vis making money, not having fun, you will learn a hell of a lot,’ Rivkin observed later. ‘In the 1980s I made sure I mixed with Kerry Packer.’ Rivkin was having a fine old time. In 1979, he and Potts joined with Brian Yuill of Spedley Securities to take control of a garment company called Bisley Clothing. The future of menswear, they told shareholders, lay in ‘commodities, futures and money market broking and general investment’. Rivkin had his first brush with regulators when Bisley bought 23 per cent of Country Broadcasting Services, which made him the leading television mogul in Orange and Dubbo, with all the glamour that conjures up. However, Rivkin had not bothered to obtain the government approval he needed at that time to take such a large stake. He told the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that he had looked at the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 before buying the shares, but ‘without much comprehension’ because it was a difficult Act to follow. Justice McGregor thought it was ‘unwise (though perhaps commercially advantageous)’ for Rivkin to skip any legal advice before he bought the shares. ‘His evidence does not persuade me that he really believed Bisley’s transactions [were legal],’ McGregor ruled. Eight years later in the NSW Supreme Court, Justice Rogers would give Rivkin another reality check in a case he brought against a former employee, Tim Allen, over a $96 000 loss from a failed share placement. Rogers described Rivkin as someone who ‘paints with a broad brush’, ‘an aggressive man, insistent on his rights, and what he conceives to be his rights.’ He is ‘extremely impatient of detail and has a tendency to proceed with some lack of concern for the rights of others. This no doubt makes him a success as a stockbroker, but it also means his recollection of details is vague in the extreme.’ Rivkin had his favourite people. ‘In my day Rivkin used to have what we called his “pet monkeys”,’ Andrew Lakos told Cromie. 33\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 34\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\n‘He always had someone he favoured. These were mainly the stock exchange operators on the trading floor. He had a very close relationship with these operators because he spent his time on the trading floor and directed them on what to do. Every now and then he favoured one more than the other two.’ As Tim Allen had discovered, Rivkin could also go off people. As another Rivkin associate put it: ‘He drops people left, right and centre. He would drop them like a tonne of bricks if they came between him and his money. There were people in his office who may have made a mistake, and Rene was totally unforgiving. He thinks he could bullshit them or buy them off with money . . . You have to blame somebody, it was never his fault.’ With Bisley needing a new chief executive in 1981, Rivkin turned to Bruce Corlett to run it for him. It ended unhappily. ‘Rene is a very hard task master,’ said Lakos. ‘He was hard on Bruce, and Bruce resigned and said to Rene, “I want to be friends with you again.”’ In the early 1980s, the economy went pear-shaped again and Rivkin’s partnership with Brent Potts fell apart. Up to then, Lakos noted, ‘They were the best of buddies, they lived in each other’s pockets, their wives went shopping together, they went on picnics and boating together.’ According to Rivkin, the trigger for their falling out in mid-1983 was his refusal to include Potts’s name in the title of the firm. ‘By the time I was prepared to let him have his name in the title it was too late. Our relationship was beyond repair,’ he said in an address to students in 1997. In contrast, Rivkin told his biographer, Chris Walker, that Potts had concluded that Rene was losing his marbles. In fact, Rivkin had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a condition characterised by alternating periods of euphoria and depression. Rivkin retired to London, where life only got worse. ‘I spent six months in bed crying—not overtly—because I had just had a nervous breakdown,’ he said later. ‘Fortunately I was rescued by an old school friend of mine whom I had employed at various 34\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 35\n\nMixing with money\n\ntimes in my career, and he offered me to start a stockbroking firm with the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and that became known as Rivkin James Capel and that went on to become a very successful firm.’ Bruce Corlett, now with HSBC’s local arm, Wardleys Australia, had bailed his old school friend out. The three years from the day Rivkin James Capel opened its doors in October 1984 were the apex of Rivkin’s career as a broker. In the wild melee of takeovers launched by Alan Bond, John Elliott, Robert Holmes à Court, Larry Adler, John Spalvins, Christopher Skase, Lee Ming Tee and so many other entrepreneurs, Rivkin was a key player. He was king of the stock exchange trading floor, whether he was buying up lines of stock for raiders, or taking advantage of the special situations that takeover bids created. ‘I was playing with my money, the others were playing with the principal’s money,’ he said. He loved what he called the one-cent option, buying shares in a takeover target one cent above bid price. He was gambling that the bidder would have to raise the price. If he didn’t, he sold into the bid and lost the one cent. ‘He is a special situations man because he is part of the network,’ Andrew Lakos told Ali Cromie. ‘Rene is probably the best connected man in this country.’ Lakos, who died in early 2005, ran the back office for Rivkin James Capel. Rivkin masterminded the takeover of Castlemaine Tooheys for Alan Bond in 1986. That same year Rivkin bought half of John Singleton Advertising, which went on to run the Labor Party’s successful 1987 federal election. Rivkin was mixing socially with senior Labor figures like Graham Richardson, Laurie Brereton, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. He had also become a close friend of Kerry Packer—so close that when Rivkin moved to London in 1983, Packer secretly bought Cararra, Rivkin’s mansion on Rose Bay Avenue in Bellevue Hill, for $3 million. When Rivkin returned to Sydney six months later, Packer agreeably sold the house back to his friend for $3.3 million. 35\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 36\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nIn July 1985, Rivkin invested three quarters of a million dollars in a little oil exploration company called Oilmet NL, which became his investment vehicle. Seventeen months later, the market value of Oilmet shares had jumped from $2 million to $151 million, and Rivkin was very, very rich. ‘It’s such a wonderful feeling. A wonderful, successful feeling that you have won,’ Rivkin said of his trading successes. These were the days of ostentatious wealth. Rivkin had a huge rambling apartment in St James in London, together with a housekeeper and chauffeur. He kept a stretch Rolls Royce, one of the first off the production line in 1986, which he would park flamboyantly outside the office of his genteel British partner James Capel, much to the annoyance of Capel chief executive, Peter Quinnan. Then there was the Rivkin air wing—a $4 million Lear jet, a Cessna and a Falcon F20 corporate jet worth $3.5 million. The F20 was a neat twin-engine job that took ten passengers. He used the jets to ferry guests to his Christmas party on Hamilton Island in 1986, a two-day affair that cost $250 000; to fetch them to his forty-fifth birthday party in Sydney in 1989; and to ferry himself and friends like Robert Whyte around the country while he inflicted endless games of backgammon on them. In 1987, Australian Business magazine named Rivkin ‘Stockbroker of the Year’. His friends couldn’t say enough about his generosity and character. ‘He’s a really straight shooter, and a generous bloke both publicly and privately, he’s hugely intelligent and very entertaining and I’m proud to have him as a friend,’ Trevor Kennedy said of Rivkin in 1998. ‘No one has ever been robbed, conned or cheated by him,’ Graham Richardson said of Rivkin in 1997. ‘Charities have benefited by untold millions although no one of us will ever know by absolutely how much. He is a man of honour, intellect, generosity, humour and, above all that, knowledge.’ In September 1987, Rivkin went to hospital for surgery to remove a benign brain tumour. He was incapacitated for five 36\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 37\n\nMixing with money\n\nweeks, returning to work on 20 October just in time to see the world as he knew it fall apart in the share Crash. It was the end of the party for all the entrepreneurs, including Rivkin. His company, Oilmet, which had peaked at $1.95, now saw its share price drop to 16 cents. Before the Crash, Rivkin’s fortune had been estimated at $40–$50 million, much of it based on his now faltering Oilmet shares. But Rivkin had lost more than paper money. While he had been away, the stock exchange had switched to a computer trading system and closed the trading floor. The skills that had made Rivkin so formidable on the trading floor in the 1970s and 1980s were now redundant. ‘When [Rene] was trading on the floor, he could judge situations and players very well,’ said Adler. ‘Now it is screen trading . . . Rene’s whole occupation, as he knew it and liked it, has changed. It would depress anybody but it certainly depresses Rene.’ Even before the Crash, Rivkin’s partner in the broking business, James Capel, had been in a state of near panic about the chaos that characterised the broker’s back office, which handled the paperwork for the share trading. Close to fifty Rivkin clients were identified only by account numbers, which began at 1000 and worked up. Each had credit balances between $10 and $15 000. While there were no clues as to who the clients were, Rivkin was in the habit of withdrawing several thousand dollars in cash from some of the accounts on days when he had lunch with several highprofile Australian figures. After the Crash, Rivkin James Capel had $11 million in debt. James Capel now discovered that the broker owned more than fourteen million Oilmet shares in various nominee accounts. Rivkin claimed he had bought them for foreign clients but these clients now declined to pay for them. At the height of the boom the shares had been worth $21 million. Now they were worth a tenth of that sum. James Capel had little legal recourse. Unlike Tim Allen, Rivkin was not going to be forced to pay for the losses. Capel’s London management bit the bullet and bought Rivkin out 37\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 38\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nin December 1987 for what Lakos told Cromie was more than $12 million. That appears to have included the artwork that Rivkin had bought for the business and part of the air wing. Capel had fallen victim to Rivkin’s secret life, an alternative world that existed side by side with his public face. It had been there since he became a broker, from the day he opened his first Swiss bank account with his father in 1970. Walter, who had lived through two revolutions and a world war, took no risks and invested his money at Bank Leumi le-Israel in bonds. For Rene, a Swiss bank account offered far more than just a bolthole for money. It was the opportunity to be a masked player, to take actions that had no recourse back to himself. He could warehouse shares for other people, he could conduct insider trading without fear of detection, he could manipulate share prices and he could ignore the disclosure and takeover rules that were there to protect other investors. In short, he could do whatever he wanted. He was invisible. When the Australian Tax Office investigated Rivkin in 1981, he simply closed his old Leumi account and opened a new one called Stilton. (At the height of his art-buying phase, Rivkin was naming his accounts after painters—Withers, Signac and Streeton—before adopting a pastoral theme with accounts like Stilton and Cheshire: Swiss banking from the dairy.) With the encouragement of Otto Wolff, the private client advisor at Bank Leumi, he had used the Swiss accounts to take positions in Australian stocks—buying shares as a broker and booking them to nominee companies in the name of Bank Leumi. Rivkin’s offshore buying explained in part why Oilmet’s share price had soared so high. Oilmet’s records for the week before the Crash show that Rivkin had parked seventeen million Oilmet shares in Australian nominee companies that would later be linked to Swiss accounts. After Rivkin’s departure Rivkin James Capel appears to have been stuck with half of these. It wasn’t just Leumi. By the mid-1980s Rivkin had also linked up with Alexander Fundulus (also known as Axel), the client manager for EBC 38\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 39\n\nMixing with money\n\nZurich, a Swiss finance company associated with Bank August Roth. By the late 1980s Fundulus was coming to Australia every six months to trawl for clients. Rivkin used EBC for his racier trading. So did his estranged partner, Brent Potts, and more than a hundred other Australian business figures. It was a cottage industry bubbling below the public face of the Australian share market. It went beyond share trading. For Rivkin it was a way of life, hiding behind the names of other people, both in Australia and offshore. It could work the other way, too. Rivkin would say he owned something, like his boat, Dajoshadita, in the 1990s, but it was actually owned by a company, in this case one registered in the British Virgin Islands. Everyone knew that Rivkin owned a Falcon F20 jet, but it was actually owned by Simdock Pty Ltd, a company ostensibly owned by two Rivkin employees. A string of people who worked for him ended up nominally holding assets that in reality belonged to Rivkin. ‘Having businesses in the names of others is a good way of avoiding liability,’ a long-time Rivkin associate said. ‘You pretend it’s you but it’s not really you . . . What he does is limit his risk to the amount of equity investment. So somebody carries the can. It’s his name, his hype, a little bit of his seed money but most of the risk—the downside risk, not the upside risk—goes to someone else. Rene has always been good at taking the margin. This is just another form of it.’ In April 1988, four months after splitting with James Capel, Rivkin bought another small broking business, Bridge Son & Shepherd. But the wild days of the 1980s share boom were over. The share market would go sideways for the next six years and Rivkin’s fortunes subsided, along with those of his public company, Oilmet. By 1990, Rivkin was in serious trouble. He had bet wrongly that the Japanese share market was about to crash. Instead it kept on rising. The bet was in the form of futures contracts on the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, which were tied to the future level of the Nikkei 225 stock index in Tokyo. ‘I’ve only had one bad year 39\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 40\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nin my life and that was when I shorted the Tokyo market at 36 000 index points and I lost a lot of money because I covered at 39 500 points because I couldn’t stand the pain,’ Rivkin told an investment seminar in 1997. ‘Six to nine months later that Japanese market collapsed so really I got it right.’ Rivkin lost close to $10 million on this play. The broking business was losing money. Oilmet was next to moribund. The position was even worse in Zurich, where his accounts were millions of dollars in the red and Bank Leumi was making a margin call. And now Kerry Packer wanted Rene to help his son James lose a little money.\n\n40\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 41\n\nTHREE\n\nLeaving Albany n the early months of 1991, after duly consulting his financial advisor and mentor, Rene Rivkin, James Packer decided to put a little money into a hot prospect on the speculative end of the market . . . which meant investing several hundred thousand dollars in Rivkin’s struggling investment company, Oilmet. Rivkin, after all, was one of his father’s closest friends. Kerry Packer’s right-hand man, Trevor Kennedy, oversaw the purchase of another two million Oilmet shares by the family holding company, Consolidated Custodians. It wasn’t enough to get Rivkin out of trouble or to turn around the Oilmet share price, but it was nice to have the Packer name on the share register. The golden circle of mateship guided the House of Packer and its satellites. Kerry Packer’s world spanned the gamut of social and political circles in Australia. Packer’s name opened all doors. To understand that world, you must consider one of the men who played a major role in shaping it, the worldly wise former editor whose earlier staff remember him fondly as ‘Our Trev’. Trevor John Kennedy, two years older than Rivkin, grew up as a good Catholic boy in modest circumstances in Albany, Western Australia. Kennedy senior was a tailor, a vocation that seems to have had a terminal effect upon his son’s dress sense. Trevor\n\nI\n\n41\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 42\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nKennedy grew up with a succession of part-time jobs, including holding a professional fisherman’s licence at thirteen. As a teenager his parents sent him to St Aquinas College in Perth, where he was a classmate of Peter Smedley, who would later earn the nickname ‘Pacman’ for his acquisitive ways of running Colonial Group. Growing up poor in Albany shaped Kennedy’s life. His path from Aquinas would be marked by a determination to move as far away as he could, as quickly as he could, from the world of his childhood. The recurrent feature of that journey would be impatience. The first escape attempt failed. Kennedy worked as a cadet journalist at his local paper, then went on to join the Canberra Times, but this ended badly. By 1964, at age twenty-two, he had sworn off journalism to return home to join his father’s venture into potato farming. He lasted two years there before rescue came by way of a call from the editor of the Australian Financial Review, Max Walsh, whom Kennedy knew from his Canberra days. Walsh put him to work as a Financial Review correspondent, first in Canberra, then in London. He met a dizzying array of famous names; all of them went into the contact book, many of them as lifelong friends. ‘He has met and kept a lot of friends during his life, which says a lot about a person,’ an old acquaintance commented in 2004. ‘I can remember Keating when he was first starting out—we have a long history,’ Kennedy would say later, after he tapped the prime minister to launch Ozemail’s Internet phone service in 1995. Another former West Australian, Bob Hawke, went on a fishing trip with Kennedy in the late 1960s. In the 1980s, Kennedy would give Hawke and his wife a copy of The Journalistic Javelin, a recently published history of the Bulletin. It was inscribed with easy familiarity: ‘For Bob and Hazel, the best people to inhabit The Lodge ever. Cheers, Trevor Kennedy.’ Kennedy had married Christina Miller, the daughter of the legendary surgeon, Sir Douglas Miller, of St Vincent’s Hospital. 42\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 43\n\nLeaving Albany\n\nChristina was blue-blood Establishment, descended on her mother’s side from one of Australia’s early corporate titans, Thomas Mort. While Kennedy usually wore his Catholicism and Irish heritage lightly, it could be evoked when necessary to forge useful links, as with the somewhat pious senior Millers. After London, Kennedy became Melbourne bureau chief for the Financial Review. Then, in February 1971, Vic Carroll appointed him to edit a new Fairfax weekly, the National Times. He was twenty-eight and the high life was just beginning. A year later he was headhunted by Sir Frank Packer at Consolidated Press to edit the Bulletin. To sweeten the offer, Kennedy would tell friends later, Sir Frank made him a director of Australian Consolidated Press and slipped him some of that company’s shares—Kennedy’s first serious money. The deal was so good that a story circulated at the time, repeated with relish by Kennedy’s rivals, that Sir Frank had hired the wrong man; that he meant to hire Vic Carroll, who had been overseeing Kennedy at the National Times, but he got them mixed up. Nevertheless, Kennedy was able to tap into a new wave of interest in current affairs to lift the Bulletin’s circulation, which was languishing at 20 000 when he arrived. In this position he mentored a generation of journalists. ‘He was a journalists’ editor,’ says one of his former staff. Once ensconced at Consolidated Press, with superb timing, Kennedy turned his formidable charm on the forgotten member of the Packer clan, Sir Frank’s hapless younger son, Kerry. With his brother Clyde favoured by his father, Kerry had been left to stooge around in nowhere jobs. In 1972, aged thirty-five, he was working as an ad rep for the Women’s Weekly when Clyde quarrelled with his father and left Cons Press. Eighteen months later Sir Frank was dead. Clyde, now living in Los Angeles, sold his share of Cons Press for $4 million; this left Kerry Packer king of the company: chief controller of the Nine television stations in Melbourne and Sydney and of the country’s biggest magazine group. As Kerry 43\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 44\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\ntook his first tentative steps on the road that would make him Australia’s first billionaire, it turned out he wasn’t hapless after all. Kennedy had been supplementing Kerry’s shoestring allowance from his father with secret advances written off as expenses from the Bulletin and helping Kerry whoop it up on the town. Kennedy was in the box seat. ‘By day, Trevor was running the magazine and, by night, he was out with Kerry Packer in the nightclubs and gaming joints of Sydney,’ Carroll later told Bulletin reporter Adam Shand. With the long boozy lunches and wild nights, Kennedy’s contact list grew ever longer. When Labour Council secretary John Ducker’s former speechwriter was looking for a job, Kennedy put Bob Carr on the Bulletin payroll, where he stayed until he was elected to state parliament in 1983. Kennedy also hired an aspiring Liberal called Tony Abbott. A young Malcolm Turnbull was given part-time work while doing his law degree and then, when he returned from a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, Kennedy put him on staff as Cons Press company secretary and later legal counsel. Kennedy’s links to the emerging figures in the New South Wales Labor Right—Keating, Laurie Brereton, Leo McLeay and Graham Richardson—would shape the marriage of convenience that Kerry Packer fashioned with Labor, initially through Neville Wran and his advisor Peter Barron. Kennedy was not all conviviality and larrikinism. ‘He had another side to him,’ says a former senior Consolidated Press colleague. ‘He was obsessed with money.’ That would not surface until later. In the meantime, he had become a regular share trader, which was how he became friends with the hottest young broker in town, Rene Rivkin. In turn, this was how Rivkin and Brent Potts became Kerry Packer’s house brokers. The subsets of friends, contacts and associates forming around Kerry Packer at this time would become a network like nothing Australia had seen. The Labor Party was in the process of an historic shift of its funding base, from relying on the unions to 44\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 45\n\nLeaving Albany\n\nbankroll its election campaigns to hitting the big end of town for money. The evolving relationship with Packer would be the key to this brave new world. At the same time, Rivkin would introduce Packer to his own network. The most enduring relationship would be with Robert Whyte, who had returned to Australia in the mid-1970s to run the funds management arm of insurer QBE. He would become one of Packer’s closest friends. There was nothing extraordinary in this—politics and money have never been strangers in Sydney. What made this alliance different was that it was forged and mediated through a media organisation. Packer had come into his inheritance just as the communications revolution, which would transform economies and societies around the world, was gathering pace. In the milieu around Packer’s offices in Park Street, Labor politicians were mixing with fast money and aggressive young journalists; the new breed of young entrepreneurs, besides cementing access routes to politicians, were discovering how to manage their media profiles; and journalists were forging key relationships not just with politicians, but with stockbrokers. Eventually large swathes of senior Nine management would be taking investment advice from their dear friend Rene. As Graham Richardson found, in Rene’s world his very special clients never lost money. ‘I have never had a losing trade. Ever,’ Richardson told a Rivkin investment forum in 1997. The most interesting figures in this new grouping of politicians, journalists and the big end of town were those who navigated their way from one camp to another. Like Bob Carr, who returned to politics to become NSW Premier. Or Peter Barron who, after helping to set up Wran’s new alliance with Packer, went on to become Bob Hawke’s closest advisor before becoming a lobbyist for Packer. Barron’s closest friend, Graham Richardson, later charted a similar course from politics into the safe harbour of Consolidated Press, but in his case he made it into media as well . . . as did Richardson’s other close friend, Rene Rivkin. In July 1990, two 45\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 46\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nmonths before he ripped off his father’s Swiss bank account to stave off his creditors, and while the Australian Stock Exchange was investigating a series of suspicious share trades he was making in Stroika, Rivkin signed on as financial reporter with his friend Ray Martin on the Midday Show. As the face of respectability, he would share his thoughts on screen about the latest moves in world markets. The figure at the heart of these new alliances and friendships was, of course, Trevor Kennedy. Early on at Park Street, Kennedy’s chief challenger in the court of King Kerry was Women’s Weekly editor Ita Buttrose. That Kennedy was able to overcome the advantages that Ita’s close friendship with Packer gave her is no mean tribute to Kennedy’s schmoozing powers. Ita saw the writing on the wall and left before she was pushed, taking a job offer from Rupert Murdoch in 1986. That left only the cocky new head of Nine, the one-time floor wax salesman, Samuel Hewlings Chisholm as a rival. ‘I’m just a heartbeat away from running this place,’ Chisholm would say to Kennedy, to taunt him. For all the jostling among courtiers, there was never any doubt who was in control at Consolidated Press. Kerry Packer was a 24-hour-a-day, mercurial, shrewd and overbearing boss. His executives and editors had a yellow phone on each of their desks to communicate among themselves; when Packer wanted to speak to them he had a special ring tone, which could be heard even when they were talking to someone else. When the ‘bat phone’ emitted this much feared tone, the editor had better be there, or their PA had better know exactly how to contact them quickly, or someone would be fired. Packer could be extremely generous, but he expected instant obedience. He carried similar expectations in his encounters with merchant bankers and politicians. In 1977, when Packer was having problems finding playing grounds for the World Series Cricket—his attempt to replace the Australian Cricket Board with his own professional league—Premier Neville Wran ensured the 46\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 47\n\nLeaving Albany\n\nSydney Cricket Ground ultimately came to the party. In 1979, Rupert Murdoch and Robert Sangster won a valuable concession to run the Pools but, when the deal was finalised, Kerry Packer’s name popped up as an equal shareholder. Packer’s character and operating style became the template for Cons Press management. It could be a little like working for Genghis Khan. Not that there was anything wrong with that. As Packer said of his favourite Mongol, ‘He wasn’t very lovable but he was bloody efficient.’ Packer kept only good people in the Mongol horde. ‘You don’t survive there long term unless you are a good quality executive,’ a senior banker commented in 2004. But with the drinking and the partying it was a blustering, blokey culture—the Shouting and Screaming School of Management Theory. Glenn Barry, who was brought in from New York in 1979 to run Lotto Management Systems, remembers his chairman, Trevor Kennedy, as focused on the politics of the job rather than practical difficulties. When Barry discovered on his arrival that the company had ordered the wrong computer software, Kennedy told him, ‘That’s your fucking problem.’ When Barry tried to explain the technology, he was interrupted: ‘Who do you fucking well think you are, Buck fucking Rogers?’ At Cons Press, Kennedy preferred memos to him to be only one page in length. They would come back with a scrawled ‘yes’ or ‘no’ on them. More than one page and the memos went straight into the file unread, says one former colleague. Kennedy did not believe in paper trails, either. ‘His nickname was Trevor the Shredder, because after a board meeting there were always documents he wanted shredded,’ says Barry. When Kennedy approached Sean Howard in 1984 about buying into the computer magazine group he had built up, Howard recalls his opening lines were: ‘My name is Trevor Kennedy. I run the company that publishes the Bulletin and Women’s Weekly. You may have heard of us.’ He wasn’t afraid to use power. And he always wanted a discount, whether he was 47\n\nPacker's Lunch Text\n\n29/6/07\n\n11:11 AM\n\nPage 48\n\nPACKER’S LUNCH\n\nbuying rare books, or taking shares in a float. ‘I think you’ve dropped a zero off my allocation,’ he told one broker whom he’d called to complain about the shares he received in a tech stock float in the late 1990s. It may not have been meant that way, but for this broker the inference was that Kennedy, as chairman of several major companies and therefore in a position to direct future work away from him, was asking for his personal allocation to be increased ten times. ‘If there was a commercial gain to be made there is no doubt he would play the cards brutally,’ said a banker who worked with Kennedy. ‘He was guilty of being brutally commercial. The guy had a lot of presence.’ He took no prisoners. Greg Pynt, a former merchant banker with Deutsche, told journalist Angus Grigg of the time he surprised Kennedy with his presence in a secret meeting with Merrill Lynch bankers ahead of the Oil Search merger with Orogen Oil in Cairns in 2002. ‘What are you doing here, you little bastard?’ Kennedy said mock seriously, before grabbing the bemused Pynt in a headlock and marching him out of the terminal and across the road. ‘You’ve seen nothing,’ Kennedy told him sternly with deadpan humour, then walked off. It was through running Kerry Packer’s affairs that Kennedy got his introduction to offshore banking. Sir Frank Packer had set up the family holding company in the Bahamas back in the 1960s and the network of Packer companies in tax havens had grown considerably since then. ‘When I worked for Consolidated Press there were a lot of companies that were established in the Turks and Caicos, and Netherlands BV, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, et cetera,’ Kenn"
