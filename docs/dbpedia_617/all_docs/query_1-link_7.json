        "text": "III\n\nPolice Matters\n\n\"Welch' Neues UnerhÃ¶rtes hat der Vogt\n\nSich ausgesonnen!\"\n\n(Schiller)[a]\n\n\"I say quite bluntly,\" says Vogt, striking the gravest pose of which such a buffoon is capable, \"I say quite bluntly: Everyone who engages in political machinations with Marx and his associates will sooner or later fall into the hands of the police. For these machinations are no sooner under way than they are made known and betrayed to the secret police and hatched out by them as soon as the time appears to be ripe\" (these machinations are eggs, it would seem, and the police are the broody hens that hatch them out). \"The instigators, Marx & Co., are of course sitting in London out of reach\" (while the police are sitting on the eggs). \"I would not be at a loss to provide proofs of this assertion\" (\"Magnum Opus\", pp. 166, 167).[b]\n\nVogt is not \"at a loss\" [verlegen], Falstaff was never \"at a loss\" either. As \"mendacious\" [verlogen] as you please, but \"at a loss\"? Come, your \"proofs\" [Belege], Jack, your. \"proofs\".[c]\n\n1. CONFESSION\n\n\"Marx himself says on p. 77 of his pamphlet Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne[d], published in 1853: 'After 1849 just as before 1848, only one path was open to the proletarian partyâthat of secret association. Consequently after 1849 a whole series of clandestine proletarian societies sprang up on the Continent, were discovered by the police, condemned by the courts, broken up by the gaols and continually resuscitated by the force of circumstances.' Marx,\" Vogt declares, \"here euphemistically describes himself as 'circumstance'\" (\"Magnum Opus\", p. 167).\n\nMarx says, then, that \"the police have discovered a whole series of secret -societies since 1849\" that were restored to life by the force of circumstances. Vogt says it was Marx and not the \"circumstances\" that \"resuscitated the secret societies\". Thus Vogt has furnished proof that whenever Badinguet's police discovered Marianne[50], Marx in collusion with Pietri set it up again.\n\n\"Marx himself says.\" I shall now quote what Marx himself says in its proper context:\n\n\"With the defeat of the revolution of 1848-49 the party of the proletariat on the Continent lost use of the press, freedom of speech and the right to associate, i.e. the legal instruments of party organisation, which it had enjoyed for once during that short interval. The social status of the classes they represented enabled both the bourgeois-liberal and the petty-bourgeois democratic parties to remain united in one form or another and to assert their common interests more or less effectively despite the reaction. After 1849 just as before 1848, only one path was open to the proletarian partyâthat of secret association. Consequently after 1849 a whole series of clandestine proletarian societies sprang up on the Continent, were discovered by the police, condemned by the courts, broken up by the gaols and continually resuscitated by the force of circumstances. Some of these secret societies aimed directly at the overthrow of the existing state. This was fully justified in France.... Other secret societies aimed at organising the proletariat into a party, without concerning themselves with the existing governments. This was necessary in countries like Germany.... There is no doubt that here too the members of the proletarian party would take part once again in a revolution against the status quo, but it was no part of their task to prepare this revolution, to agitate, conspire or to plot for it.... The Communist League[51], therefore, was no conspiratorial society...\" (Revelations, etc.,[52] Boston edition, pp. 62, 63).[e]\n\nBut our merciless Land-Vogt regards even \"propaganda\" as a crime, except of course for the propaganda organised by Pietri and Laity. Our Land-Vogt will even condone \"agitation, conspiracy and plotting\", but only when its central office is in the Palais Royal[53] with Hearty Harry, Heliogabalus Plon-Plon. But \"propaganda\" among proletarians! Fie!\n\nAfter the above-quoted passage, so significantly mutilated by our Examining Magistrate Vogt, I continue in the Revelations as follows:\n\n\"It is self-evident that a secret society of this kind\" (like the Communist League) \"[...] could have had but few attractions for individuals who on the one hand concealed their personal insignificance by strutting around in the theatrical cloak of the conspirator, and on the other wished to satisfy their narrow-minded ambition on the day of the next revolution, and who wished above all to seem important at the moment, to snatch their share of the proceeds of demagogy and to find a welcome among the quacks and charlatans of democracy. Thus a group broke off from the Communist League, or if you like it was broken off, a group that demanded, if not real conspiracies, at any rate the appearance of conspiracies, and accordingly called for a direct alliance with the democratic heroes of the hour; this was the Willich-Schapper group. It was typical of them that Willich was, together with Kinkel, one of the entrepreneurs in the business of the German-American Revolutionary Loan\"[54] (pp. 63, 64).[f]\n\nAnd how does Vogt translate this passage into his \"euphemistic\" police mumbo-jumbo? Listen:\n\n\"As long as both\" (parties) \"cooperated, they worked, as Marx himself says, to create secret societies and to compromise societies and individuals on the Continent\" (p. 171).\n\nOur fat rascal forgets only to quote the page in the Revelations where Marx \"of course says this himself\".\n\n\"Egli Ã¨ bugiardo e padre di menzogna.\"[g]\n\n2. THE REVOLUTIONARY CONGRESS IN MURTEN\n\n\"Charles the Bold\", our \"bold Charles\", vulgo Karl Vogt, now delivers his account of the defeat of Murten.[55]\n\n\"Large numbers of workers and refugees were cajoled and bullied\"ânamely by Liebknechtâ\"until finally [...] it was agreed that there should be a revolutionary congress in Murten. The delegates of the branch societies were to assemble there in secret in order to confer about the final organisation of the League and the exact moment for the armed uprising. All preparations were made in absolute secrecy, the summonses were conveyed only by Liebknecht's trusted friends and correspondents. The delegates converged on Murten from all sides, on foot, by boat and by carriage, and were immediately welcomed by gendarmes, who knew in advance about the whats, the whys and the hows. The whole company that had been arrested in this manner was detained for a while in the Augustinian monastery in Fribourg and then transported to England and America. Herr Liebknecht was treated with quite exceptional consideration\" (\"Magnum Opus\", p. 168). \"Herr Liebknecht\" had taken part in Struve's putsch in September 1848, then was kept in Baden gaols until the middle of May 1849, was freed as a result of the military insurrection in Baden, served as a common soldier in the Baden People's Artillery, was incarcerated once more as a rebel in the casemates in Rastatt by Vogt's friend Brentano; having been freed again during the campaign for the Imperial Constitution he joined the division commanded by Johann Philipp Becker and finally crossed the French border with Struve, Cohnheim, Korn and Rosenblum from where they made their way to Switzerland.\n\nAt the time I knew even less about \"Herr Liebknecht\" and his Swiss \"revolutionary congresses\" than about the drinking-meetings with mine host Benz in Kessler Street in Berne where the assembled parliamentarians regaled each other with the speeches they had made in St. Paul's Church[56], counted and distributed future posts of the Empire among themselves, and helped to while away the hard night of exile by listening to the lies, farces, ribaldry and rodomontades of Charles the Bold who, not without a touch of humour, awarded himself the letters patent of \"Imperial Wine Bibber\" in honour of an old German lay.\n\nThe \"lay\" begins with these words:\n\n\"Swaz ich trinken's hÃ¢n gesÃ«hen,\n\ndaz ist gar von kinden geschÃ«hen:\n\nich hÃ¢n einen swÃ«lch gesÃ«hen,\n\ndem wil ich meisterschefte jÃ«hen.\n\n\"Den dÃ»hten becher gar entwiht,\n\nÃ«r wolde nÃ¤pf noch kophe niht.\n\nÃ«r tranc Ã»z grÃ´zen kannen.\n\nÃ«r ist vor allen mannen\n\nein vorlauf allen swÃ«lhen\n\n\"von Ã»ren und von Ã«lhen\n\nwart solcher slÃ¼nd nie niht getÃ¢n.\"[h]\n\nBut to return to the \"revolutionary congress\" in Murten. \"Revolutionary congress\"! \"Final organisation of the League\"! \"Moment for the armed uprising\"! \"Absolutely secret preparations\"! \"Very secret meeting converging from all sides on foot, by boat and by carriage\"! \"Charles the Bold\" evidently did not study my analysis of Stieber's methods in the Revelations without profit.\n\nThe facts of the matter are simply these: Liebknecht wasâearly in 1850âthe President of the Geneva Workers' Association. He proposed a union of all the hitherto unconnected German workers' associations in Switzerland. The proposal was accepted. Whereupon it was decided to send a circular to twenty-four different workers' associations, inviting them to Murten to discuss the problems of the intended organisation and of establishing a joint newspaper. The debates in the Geneva Workers' Association, the circular, the discussions of the latter in the other twenty-four workers' associationsâall this was done in public and the congress at Murten was likewise arranged in full view of the public. Had the Swiss authorities desired to ban it they could have done so four weeks before it was due to be held. But the liberal Herr Druey, who was on the look-out for a victim he could devour and thus placate the sabre-rattling Holy Alliance, preferred to have his police stage a coup de thÃ©Ã¢tre. Liebknecht, who as President of the Workers' Association had signed the document proclaiming the congress, was accorded the honour of being regarded as one of the chief ringleaders. He was separated from the other delegates, was granted free lodging in the uppermost turret of the tower in Fribourg, from where he enjoyed a fine view of the surrounding country, and he even had the privilege of walking for an hour each day upon the battlements. The only special feature of the way he was treated was the fact of solitary confinement. His repeated request to be allowed to join the other prisoners was repeatedly rejected. Vogt, however, knows full well that the police do not put their \"moutons\"[i] in solitary confinement, but place them as \"agreeable companions\" among the mass.\n\nTwo months later Liebknecht, together with a certain Gebert, was transported by the Fribourg Chief of Police to Besancon, where both he and his companion received a compulsory French passport to London, with the warning that if they deviated from the prescribed route they would be deported to Algiers. As a - result of this unexpected journey Liebknecht lost most of the personal effects he had in Geneva. Apart from this, however, Messrs. Castella, Schaller and the other members of the then Fribourg Government are to be commended for their humane treatment of Liebknecht and the other prisoners of Murten. These gentlemen were mindful of the fact that they themselves had been captive or on the run but a few years before and they openly expressed the disgust they felt at being obliged to execute the orders of the Grand Cophta Druey[57]. The captive refugees were not given the kind of treatment that the refugee \"parliamentarians\" had expected. A certain Herr H., an associate of the parliamentarians who is still in Switzerland, felt it incumbent on himself to publish a pamphlet in which he denounced the prisoners in general and Liebknecht in particular for upholding \"revolutionary\" ideas that exceeded the limits of parliamentary reason. And it seems that \"Charles the Bold\" is still inconsolable about the \"quite exceptional consideration\" accorded to Liebknecht.\n\nPlagiarism is a general characteristic of all the concoctions of our \"bold hero\", and this one is no exception. For the Swiss liberals invariably \"liberalised\" their acts of expulsion by accusing their victims of spying. After Fazy had expelled Struve he denounced him publicly as a \"Russian spy\". Likewise Druey, who accused Boichot of being a French mouchard. Tourte slandered Schily in a similar manner after he had suddenly had him arrested in the street in Geneva and sent to the tour des prisons in Berne. \"Le commissaire maire fÃ©dÃ©ral Monsieur Kern exige votre expulsion\"[j] was the reply of the high and mighty Tourte when Schily asked the reason for the brutal treatment meted out to him. Schily: \"Alors mettez-moi en prÃ©sence de Monsieur Kern\"[k]. Tourte: \"Non, nous ne voulons pas que M. le commissaire fÃ©dÃ©ral fasse la police Ã GenÃ¨ve\"[l]. The logic of this reply was altogether worthy of the letter this same Tourte, who was then Swiss Ambassador in Turin, wrote to the President of the Confederation[m] informing him that Cavour was working with might and main to prevent the cession of Savoy and Nice at a time when this cession was already a fait accompli. But it is possible that certain diplomatic railway connections were responsible for the failure of Tourte's normal discernment at the time. Scarcely was Schily locked up in the severest solitary confinement in Berne when Tourte began to \"liberalise\" his police brutality by whispering in the ears of German refugees (Dr. Fink, for example) that \"Schily had secretly been in contact with Kern and had sent him information about refugees in Geneva, etc.\" The Geneva paper IndÃ©pendant itself included among the notorious sins of the Geneva Govern ment of the day \"the systematic calumniation of the refugees, which has been raised to the level of a principle of state\". (See Appendix 1.)\n\nAt the very first representations of the German police, Swiss liberalism violated the right of asylum by driving out the so-called \"leaders\"âand this right of asylum had just been granted on condition that the remnant of the revolutionary army would refrain from fighting a last battle on Baden soil. But later, after the \"leaders'', it was the turn of the \"misguided led\". Thousands of Baden soldiers were given passports for home on false pretences and when they arrived there they were immediately welcomed by gendarmes, who knew in advance about \"the whats, the whys and the bows\". Then came the threats of the Holy Alliance and with them the police farce in Murten. But even the \"liberal\" Federal Council[58] did not venture to go as far as the \"bold Charles\", Nothing at all about \"revolutionary congress\", \"final organisation of the League\", \"exact moment for the armed uprising\". The investigation which for propriety's sake had to be started, vanished into thin air.\n\n\"Threats of war'' from abroad and \"political-propagandistic tendencies\", that was all the \"embarrassed\" Federal Council could stutter by way of excuse in its official report. (See Appendix 2.) The grand police actions of \"Swiss liberalism\" *did not cease with the \"revolutionary congress in Murten\". On January 25, 1851 my friend Wilhelm Wolff (\"Parliamentary Wolf\" as he was known among the \"Parliamentary Sheep\") wrote to me from Zurich:\n\n\"The recent measures taken by the Federal Council have reduced the number of refugees from 11,000 to 500, and the Council will not rest until the remnant has been harried out of the country too, leaving only those who possess either a considerable fortune or powerful connections.\"\n\nThe refugees who had fought for. the revolution stood in the most natural opposition to the heroes of St. Paul's Church who had talked it into the grave. The latter did not scruple to deliver their opponents into the hands of the Swiss police.\n\nVogt's loyal follower, the Ranickel monstrosity, himself wrote to Schily after the latter's arrival in London:\n\n\"Try to keep a few columns open in one of the Belgian newspapers for explanations, and do not fail to make the life of those rascally German dogs (the parliamentarians) in America miserable for having sold themselves to that goitrous diplomat (Druey).\"\n\nIt is now apparent what \"Charles the Bold\" meant when he said:\n\n\"I was labouring with all my strength to set limits to all these revolutionary antics and to provide the refugees with shelter, either on the Continent or overseas.\"[n]\n\nThe following description was to be found, long ago, in No. 257 of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung dated\n\n\"Heidelberg, March 23, 1849: Our friend Vogt, 'champion' of the Left, imperial jester of the moment, imperial Barrot of the future, the 'faithful warner' against revolutionâhe has joined forces withâsome like-minded people? By no means! But with a few reactionaries of the deepest dye ... and for what purpose? In order to convey or to deport to America all those 'characters' living in Strasbourg, Besancon and elsewhere on the German frontier.... What Cavaignac's iron rule imposes as a punishment these gentlemen would like to mete out in the name of Christian charity.... Amnesty is dead, long live deportation! And of course this was accompanied by the pia fraus[o] that the refugees had themselves expressed the desire to emigrate, etc. But now the SeeblÃ¤tter receives word from Strasbourg that these intentions to deport them have unleashed an angry storm of protest among all the refugees, etc. [...] In fact they all hope to return to Germany soon, even at the risk (as Herr Vogt touchingly remarks) of having to join some 'mad escapade'.\"[p]\n\nBut enough of \"Charles the Bold's\" revolutionary congress in Murten.\n\n3. CHERVAL\n\n\"The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible\n\nlies that this same fat rogue will tell us.\"[q]\n\nIn my Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne an entire chapter is devoted to the Cherval plot[59]. In it I show that Stieber with Cherval (a pseudonym for CrÃ¤mer) as his instrument, and Carlier, Greif and Fleury as midwives, brought the so-called Franco-German September plot in Paris into the world{*6}, with the intention of providing the prosecution with just that \"factual evidence of an indictable offence\" against the Cologne prisoners the lack of which the \"Indictment Board of Cologne\" had criticised.\n\nSo decisive were the proofs I delivered to the defence during the Cologne trial[60], so convincing the demonstration of a total lack of connection between Cherval, on the one hand, and the accused at Cologne and myself, on the other, that Stieber, who had sworn by Cherval on October 18 (1852), forswore him again on October 23, 1852 (Revelations, p. 29[r]). Driven into a corner he abandoned the attempt to link Cherval and his plot with us. Stieber was Stieber, but even Stieber was a far cry from Vogt.\n\nI think it is quite unnecessary for me to repeat here the information I gave in the Revelations about the so-called September plot. At the beginning of May 1852 Cherval returned to London, from where he had moved to Paris on business in the early summer of 1850. The Paris police let him escape from them a few months after he was sentenced in February 1852. In London he was greeted at first as a political martyr and welcomed into the German Workers' Educational Society, from which my friends and I had resigned as early as mid-September 1850[61]. But this delusion was short-lived. The truth about his deeds of heroism in Paris soon became known and during that same month, May 1852, he was publicly expelled from the Society for his infamous conduct. The accused in Cologne, who had been imprisoned early in May 1851, were still in detention awaiting trial. I realised from a notice sent from Paris by the spy Beckmann to his paper, the KÃ¶lnische Zeitung, that the Prussian police were attempting retrospectively to forge a link between Cherval, his plot and the accused in Cologne. I accordingly kept on the look-out for reports about Cherval. It so happened that in July 1852 the latter offered his services as an Orleanist agent to M. de R.[s], a former Minister during Louis Philippe's reign and a well-known eclectic philosopher. The connections which M. de R. retained in the Paris Prefecture of Police enabled him to obtain extracts from their dossier on Cherval. In the French police report Cherval was referred to as Cherval nommÃ© Frank, dont le vÃ©ritable nom est CrÃ¤mer[t]. For a long time he had worked as an agent for Prince Hatzfeldt, the Prussian Ambassador in Paris; he was the betrayer of the complot franco-allemand and was now simultaneously a spy for the French, etc. In the course of the Cologne trial I gave these reports to one of the counsel for the defence, Herr Schneider II, and empowered him to name my source if need arose. When Stieber said under oath during the session of October 18 that the Irishman Cherval, who on Stieber's own testimony had served a gaol sentence in Aachen in 1845 for forging bills of exchange, was at that moment still under arrest in Paris, I informed Schneider II by return of post that, under the pseudonym of Cherval, the Rhenish Prussian Cramer was \"still\" in London, was in daily communication with Greif, the Prussian lieutenant of police, and that, as he was a condemned Prussian criminal, the English would extradite him as soon as they received an application from the Prussian Government. To have brought him to Cologne as a witness would have overthrown the entire Stieber system.\n\nUnder pressure from Schneider II Stieber finally remembered on October 23 having heard that Cherval had fled from Paris, but he swore high and low that he had no knowledge of the present whereabouts of the Irishman or of his alliance with the Prussian police. In fact at that time Cherval was attached to Greif in London by a fixed weekly salary. The debates about the \"Cherval mystery\" at the Cologne Assizes, that had been provoked by my reports, drove Cherval from London. I heard that he had gone on a police mission to Jersey. I had long lost sight of him when by chance I came across a report from the Geneva correspondent of the Republik der Arbeiter[u], which appears in New York, stating that Cherval had turned up in Geneva in March 1853 under the name of Nugent, and that he had vanished from there once more in the summer of 1854. He visited Vogt in Geneva,. then, a few weeks after my Revelations with the compromising statements about him had been published in Basle by Schabelitz.\n\nLet us now return to the Falstaffian travesty of history.\n\nAccording to Vogt, Cherval arrived in Geneva immediately after his fictitious escape from Paris and before that he was allegedly \"sent\" by the secret Communist League from London to Paris \"a few months\" prior to the discovery of the September plot (loc. cit., p. 172). Hence while the interval between May 1852 and March 1853 thus disappears altogether, the interval between June 1850 and September 1851 shrinks to \"a few months\". What wouldn't Stieber have given for a Vogt who could have testified on oath before the Assizes at Cologne that the \"secret Communist League in London\" had sent Cherval to Paris in June 1850, and what wouldn't I have given to see Vogt sweating on the witness stand next to his Stieber! What a fine company they make: the swearing Stieber with his bird, the Greif [griffin], his Wermuth [vermouth], his Goldheimchen [golden cricket] and his Bettelvogt [beadle]. Vogt's Cherval brought with him to Geneva \"recommendations to all friends of Marx & Co., from whom Mr. Nugent soon became inseparable\" (p. 173). He \"took up his quarters with the family of a correspondent of the Allgemeine Zeitung\" and gained access to Vogt probably as the result of my recommendations (in the Revelations). Vogt employed him as a lithographer (loc. cit., pp. 173[-74]) and entered with him so to speak into a \"scientific intercourse\" as he had done earlier with Archduke John and was to do later with Plon-Plon. One day, while he was working in the \"office\" of the Imperial Regent[62], \"Nugent\" was recognised by an \"acquaintance\" as Cherval and accused of being an \"agent provocateur\". In fact Nugent was not only working for Vogt in Geneva but was also busily engaged in \"founding a clandestine society\".\n\n\"Cherval-Nugent presided, kept the minutes and corresponded with London\" (loc. cit., p. 175). He had \"taken a few not very discerning but otherwise worthy workers into his confidence\" (ibid.), however \"among the members there was also an associate of the Marx clique known to everyone as a suspect minion of the German police\" (loc. cit.).\n\n\"All the friends\" of Marx, from whom Cherval-Nugent \"became inseparable\", are now suddenly transformed into \"one associate\", and this one associate promptly dissolves again into \"the associates of Marx who had remained behind in Geneva\" (p. 176), with whom Nugent later \"continues to correspond from Paris\" and whom he magnetically \"attracts to himself\" in Paris (loc. cit.).\n\nYet another instance, then, of his favourite \"transformation\" of the buckram \"cloth\" of Kendal green !\n\nWhat Cherval-Nugent purposed with his society was the\n\n\"mass production of forged banknotes and treasury bills which when put into circulation were expected to undermine the credit of the despots and ruin their finances\" (loc. cit., p. 175).\n\nCherval, it seems, was trying to emulate the celebrated Pitt who, as is well known, set up a factory not far from London during the war against the Jacobins to produce false French assignats.\n\n\"Various stone and copper plates had already been engraved for this purpose by Nugent himself; the gullible members of the -secret league had already been selected to go to France, Switzerland and Germany with packets of these\"âstone and copper plates?ânoâ\"these counterfeit banknotes\" (the banknotes were, of course, put into packets before they were printed) (p. 175),\n\nbut Cicero-Vogt was already standing behind Cherval-Catiline with his sword drawn. A peculiar characteristic of all Falstaff s is that as well as big bellies they also have big mouths. Just look at our Gurgelgrosslinger who has already set limits to \"revolutionary antics\" in Switzerland and arranged for whole shiploads of refugees to find a livelihood overseas, look how he postures, how melodramatically he acts, how he magnifies Stieber's Paris skirmish with Cherval (see Revelations[v])! Here he lay, and thus he bore his point![w]\n\n\"The plan of the whole conspiracy\" (loc. cit., p. 176) \"had been monstrously conceived.\" \"All the workers' associations were to have Cherval's project laid at their door.\" There had already been \"some confidential inquiries from foreign embassies\", they were already on the point of \"compromising Switzerland, especially the Canton of Geneva\".\n\nBut the Land-Vogt was vigilant. He carried out his first rescue of Switzerland, an experiment he later repeated several times with steadily increasing success.\n\n\"I cannot deny,\" the weighty man exclaims, \"I cannot deny that I contributed a substantial part in frustrating these devilish plans; I cannot deny that I made use of the police of the Geneva Republic for this purpose; I regret to this day\" (disconsolate Cicero) \"that the zeal of some deluded enthusiasts served to warn the wily ringleader and enabled him to evade arrest\" [p. 177].\n\nBut at all events, Cicero-Vogt had \"frustrated\" the Catiline conspiracy, rescued Switzerland, and \"contributed\" his substantial part (wherever he carries that). According to him Cherval reappeared in Paris a few weeks later and there \"he made no attempt to hide himself, but showed himself in public like other citizens\" (loc. cit., p. 176). And we all know how public is the life of the citizens of Paris in the counterfeit Empire.\n\nWhile Cherval thus gads about in Paris \"in public\", poor[x] Vogt always has to hide in the Palais Royal under Plon-Plon's table when he visits Paris!\n\nI rather regret that after Vogt's powerful Zachariad[63] I must now give the following letter from Johann Philipp Becker. A veteran of the German emigration, active as a revolutionary from the Hambach Festival[64] to the campaign for the Imperial Constitution, in which he fought as commander of the 5th Army Division (the Berlin MilitÃ¤r-Wochenschrift, a voice that is by no means partial, testified to his military achievement), Johann Philipp Becker is too well known to require any recommendation from me. I need only say, therefore, that his letter was written to R.[y], a German businessman in London with whom I am on friendly terms, that I do not know Becker personally and that he has never been connected with me politically. Finally, I should note that I have omitted the opening section of his letter which deals with business matters as well as most of the passages referring to the \"Brimstone Gang\" and the \"Bristlers\" since we are already familiar with the material they contain. (The original of the letter is in Berlin along-with other documents connected with my suit.)\n\n\"Paris, March 20, 1860\n\n\"...I recently saw Vogt's pamphlet against Marx[z]. I found its contents very distressing, all the more so since, as I was living in Geneva at the time, I am perfectly familiar with the history of the so-called Brimstone Gang and the notorious Cherval. It is evident that the events have been totally distorted and with an utter disregard for justice have been falsely connected with the political activities of the economist Marx. I do not know Herr Marx personally, nor have I ever had any association with him whatever, but I have known Herr Vogt and his family for upwards of twenty years and am bound to him by much closer bonds of affection. I must bitterly deplore and unreservedly repudiate the frivolous and unscrupulous manner in which Vogt has entered the lists on this occasion. It is unworthy of a man to include distorted and even imaginary facts as weapons in his armoury. It is really very painful to see that Vogt unthinkingly, and apparently suicidally, destroys his congenial field of activity, compromises his position and stains his own reputation; and this would be the case even if he could be wholly acquitted of the charge of being in the pay of Napoleon. On the other hand, how gladly would I have seen him use every honest means to clear his name of such grave accusations. As it is, his behaviour hitherto in this unedifying business impels me to give you a description of the so-called Brimstone Gang and the worthy Herr Cherval so that you may judge for yourself the extent to which Marx may be held responsible for their existence and their activities.\n\n\"A word, then, about the rise and fall of the Brimstone Gang, for scarcely anyone is in a better position than I am to give you this information. During my stay in Geneva at that time I had an opportunity to observe the activities of the emigrants not only thanks to my position; but in addition, as an older man and always mindful of the general cause, I had a particular interest in closely following their every move so as to be able whenever possible to forestall and prevent the occasional foolish ventures which were so forgivable in people whom misfortune had so harassed and even reduced to despair. My 30 years' experience had taught me only too well how richly every emigration is endowed with illusions.\"\n\n(What follows has been largely anticipated in the letters of Borkheim and Schily.)\n\n\"...This company, essentially a company of idlers, was referred to jestingly and mockingly as the Brimstone Gang. It was a club which consisted, as it were, of a motley crowd brought together by chance; it had neither president nor programme, neither statute nor dogma. There is no question of its having been a secret society, or of its having had any political or other goal to pursue systematically; they merely wanted to show off and that with an openness and frankness that knew no bounds. Nor did they have any connection with Marx, who for his part could certainly have known nothing of their existence and whose socio-political views moreover diverged widely from theirs. And in addition these fellows evinced a strong urge to be independent that verged on self-conceit and it is extremely unlikely that they would have been willing to subordinate themselves to any authority either in theory or in practice. They would have laughed Vogt's paternalistic admonitions out of court, no less than they would have ridiculed Marx's policy instructions. I was in a position to obtain very precise information about everything that went on in those circles since my eldest son[ab] used to meet the Big White Chiefs every day.... In all, the whole farce of this gang, devoid of any ties[ac], scarcely outlasted the winter of 1849-50; the force of circumstances scattered our heroes to the winds.\n\n\"Who would have thought that after ten years' slumber the long-forgotten Brimstone Gang would be set alight. once more by Professor Vogt in order to ward off imagined aggressors by spreading a foul stench which was then transmitted by obliging journalists with great enthusiasm acting as it were as electromagnetic-sympathetic conductors. Even Herr von Vincke, that liberal par excellence, mentioned the Brimstone Gang in connection with the Italian question and used it as an illustration in the modest Prussian Chamber. And the otherwise blameless citizens of Breslau in their sancta simplicitas have in honour of the Brimstone Gang prepared a carnival jest and fumigated the whole city with sulphur fires as the symbol of their loyalty.\n\n\"Poor innocent Brimstone Gang! After your blessed end you had willy-nilly to turn into a veritable volcano, to become the bogy that frightens timid subjects into a wholesome respect for the police, to vulcanise all the fat-heads of the world and blacken every overheated brain down to its rootsâjust as Vogt, in my opinion, has burnt his fingers for ever.\n\n\"Now then, as for CrÃ¤mer, vulgo Cherval. This socio-political and common scoundrel came to Geneva in 1853, pretending to be an Englishman by the name of Nugent. This was in fact the surname of the woman who accompanied him, ostensibly as his wife, and who really was English. He spoke both French and English fluently and for a long time carefully avoided speaking German for he seemed to be doing everything in his power to pass for a native Englishman. Being competent in both lithography and chromolithography, he boasted of having introduced this latter art into Geneva. In society he was very adept, he knew how to make his presence felt and to show himself to advantage. He soon obtained a sufficient amount of work, drawing objects from nature and antiquity for professors of the Academy. At first he lived a retired life and later, when he did seek company it was exclusively in the circle of French and Italian refugees. At that time I founded an office de renseignements[ad] and a daily paper Le Messager du LÃ©man and I had an assistant called Stecher[ae], a refugee from Baden who had formerly been headmaster in a secondary school. He was a talented draughtsman and strove to improve his standing by studying chromolithography. He found a teacher in the Englishman Nugent. Stecher was now full of stories about this skilful, kindly and generous Englishman and about the pleasant and graceful Englishwoman. Stecher also taught singing in the Workers' Educational Association and he occasionally brought his teacher Nugent with him. It was there that I first had the pleasure of meeting him and that he condescended to speak German; he spoke it so fluently and with such a command of the Lower Rhenish dialect that I said to him: 'But you can't possibly be an Englishman!' He persisted in his assertion, however, explaining that his parents had placed him in a school in Bonn when he was very young and that he had remained there until his eighteenth year, during which time he had got used to the local dialect. Stecher, who remained enchanted by the 'nice' man almost to the last, helped to make the belief that he was an Englishman more credible. But this incident made me rather distrustful of the would-be son of Albion and I urged caution on my fellow-members in the Association. Some time later I met the Englishman in the company of some French refugees and approached just as he was boasting of his heroism during the Paris uprisings. This was the first occasion on which I learned that he was also interested in politics. This made him all the more suspect so I made fun of the 'leonine bravery' he claimed to have displayed, to give him the chance to exhibit it against me in the presence of the Frenchmen. But as he answered my biting mockery by cringing like a cur I judged him contemptible from that moment on.\n\n\"From then on he avoided me whenever he could. In the meantime, with Stecher's aid, he organised evening dances in the bosom of the German Workers' Association, enlisting additional musical talent free of charge in the shape of an Italian, a Swiss and a Frenchman. At these balls I again met the Englishman, this time as a veritable maÃ®tre de plaisir[af] and completely in his element; uproarious merriment and pleasing the ladies suited him much better than his leonine bravery. However, he was not politically active in the Workers' Association, where he did nothing but hop, skip and jump, drink and sing. In the meantime however I heard from Fritz, a goldsmith from WÃ¼rttemberg, that our 'intrepid revolutionary Englishman' had founded a League consisting of him (Fritz), another German, a few Italians and Frenchmen, making seven members in all. I implored Fritz to have nothing to do with this political tightrope-walker, at any rate as far as serious matters were concerned, and begged him both to resign from the League at once and induce his associates to do likewise. Some time later my bookseller sent me a pamphlet by Marx dealing with the communist trial in Cologne[ag] and in this Cherval was unmasked as CrÃ¤mer and sharply attacked as a scoundrel and a traitor. At once I began to suspect that Nugent might be Cherval, above all because, according to the pamphlet, he came from the Rhineland and this corresponded to his accent. Also he was alleged to be living with an Englishwoman, which was the case here too. I at once told Stecher, Fritz and others of my suspicions and circulated the pamphlet to this end. Mistrust of Nugent spread quickly; Marx's pamphlet had its effect. Soon Fritz came to me explaining that he had resigned from the 'League' and that the others would follow his example. He also revealed to me the League's secret aim. The 'Englishman' intended to destroy the credit of the nations by manufacturing government securities and using the profits that would be gained in this manner to start a European revolution, etc. At about this time a French refugee called Laya, who had formerly been a lawyer in Paris, was giving lectures on socialism. Nugent attended them and Laya, who had defended him at his trial in Paris, identified him as Cherval, and told him so. Nugent implored Laya not to betray him. I learned of it from a French emigrant friendly with Laya and I spread the news at once. Nugent had the effrontery to appear once again in the Workers' Association whereupon he was exposed as the German CrÃ¤mer and the Frenchman Cherval and was expelled. Ranickel from Bingen is said to have been his most violent assailant on this occasion. To crown it all the Genevan police began to show an interest in him because of the League, but the manufacturer of government securities had disappeared without a trace.\n\n\"In Paris he engaged in decorating porcelain and since I was in the same line of trade I met him in the course of business. But I found him the same irresponsible and incorrigible windbag as before.\n\n\"But how Vogt could have dared to connect the Genevan activities of this rogue with those of Marx and to describe him as one of his confederates or tools is utterly beyond my comprehension, especially as this was supposed to have been at the very time that he was the object of such a violent attack by Marx in the pamphlet referred to above. It was after all Marx who unmasked him and who drove him from Geneva where, according to Vogt, he was actively engaged on Marx's behalf.\n\n\"When I reflect how it was possible for a scientist like Vogt thus to go astray my mind reels. Is it not lamentable to find the praiseworthy reputation brought about by a happy coincidence of events so recklessly destroyed in such a wasteful and sterile fashion! Would it be surprising if after witnessing such deeds the whole world were to receive Vogt's scientific researches with scepticism, suspecting all the while that he might have arrived at his scientific conclusions with the same recklessness and the same lack of scruple, basing them on erroneous notions rather than on positive facts, painstakingly studied?\n\n\"If to become a statesman and a scientist nothing but ambition were required even CrÃ¤mer might become both. Unfortunately, with his Brimstone Gang and his Cherval, Vogt has degenerated into a sort of Cherval himself. And indeed there are intrinsic similarities between the two, brought about by their hankering for material comfort, for the safety of their own persons, for the joys of conviviality and for frivolous trifling with serious matters.... In anticipation of friendly news from you I send you my warmest greetings.\n\n\"Yours,\n\nJ. Ph. Becker\n\n\"P.S. Glancing once more at Vogt's pamphlet I observe to my further surprise that the 'Bristlers' too have been duly honoured. So I am adding a few words to outline their story....\n\n\"Furthermore, I also saw in the pamphlet that he claims that Nugent-Cherval-CrÃ¤mer came to Geneva on a mission for Marx[ah]. I must add therefore that he did not drop the pretence of being an Englishman up to the very last moment in Geneva and that he never gave the slightest indication that he had ever had any contact whatever with any German emigrant, which would in any case have scarcely been reconcilable with his wish to preserve his incognito. Even here and now, when the matter must have lost its former significance for him, he is reluctant to admit his German origin and steadfastly denies all earlier acquaintance with Germans.\n\n\"Hitherto I still believed that Vogt had light-mindedly allowed himself to be mystified by others, but now his actions increasingly seem to be motivated by malicious perfidy. I am less sorry for him than before and my sympathy is reserved now for his worthy and good old father[ai] who will suffer many a bitter moment because of this business.\n\n\"I will not only permit you, I actually request you to make known this information among your circle of acquaintances in the interest of truth and of the good cause.\n\n\"With warm greetings,\n\nYours,\n\nJ. Philipp B.\" (See Appendix 3.)\n\n4. THE COMMUNIST TRIAL IN COLOGNE\n\nFrom the \"office\" of the Regent of the Empire in Geneva to the Royal Prussian Court of Assizes in Cologne.\n\n\"In the Cologne trial Marx played an outstanding part.\" Undoubtedly.\n\n\"In Cologne his confederates were on trial.\"[aj] Granted.\n\nThe Cologne accused were held in detention for 1Â½ years pending the trial.\n\nThe Prussian police and the Embassy, Hinckeldey with his entire clan, postal and municipal authorities, the Ministries of the Interior and of Justiceâall made the most strenuous efforts during these 1Â½ years to give birth to a corpus delicti.\n\nHere then, in his research into my \"activities\", Vogt has at his disposal, as it were, the assistance of the Prussian state and he even had authentic material contained in my Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, Basle, 1853, a copy of which he discovered in the Geneva Workers' Association and which he borrowed and \"studied\". This time, then, young : Karl really will settle my hash. But no! For once Vogt is \"at a loss\", he just sets off a few of his home-made smoke-bombs and stink-bombs{*7} before beating a hasty retreat, stammering:\n\n\"The Cologne trial is of no particular significance for us\"[ak] (\"Magnum Opus\", p. 172).\n\nIn the Revelations I was compelled to attack Herr August Willichamong other people. Willich commenced his defence in the New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung of October 28, 1853{*8} by describing my work as \"a masterly critique of the savage procedures adopted by the central police of the German Confederation\"[al]. Jacob Schabelitz fits, the publisher of the pamphlet, wrote to me from Basle on December 11, 1852 after receiving the manuscript:\n\n\"Your exposure of the perfidy of the police is unsurpassable. You have erected a permanent monument to the present regime in Prussia.\"[am]\n\nHe added that his judgment was shared by experts, chief among these \"experts\" being a man who is at present a Genevan friend of Herr Karl Vogt.\n\nSeven years after the publication of the Revelations Herr Eichhoff of Berlin, whom I do not know at all, made the following statement in court (it is well known that Eichhoff was on trial[65], accused of having slandered Stieber):\n\n\"He had made a detailed study of the Cologne communist trial and not only adhered to his original opinion that Stieber had committed perjury but had to extend it to assert that everything Stieber said during the trial was false.... The verdict passed on the accused in Cologne was due entirely to Stieber's testimony.... Stieber's whole testimony was perjury from start to finish\" (first supplement to the Berlin Vossische Zeitung, May 9, 1860).[an]\n\nVogt himself admits:\n\n\"He\" (Marx) \"did everything in his power to provide the defence with the materials and instructions necessary for the conduct of their case....\"\n\nIt is a known fact that \"false documents, manufactured by the agents themselves\", i. e. Stieber, Fleury, etc., \"were presented to the court\" (in Cologne) \"as 'evidence' and that in general an abyss of perfidy was exposed among this police rabble that makes one shudder to contemplate\" (\"Magnum Opus\", pp. 169, 170).\n\nIf Vogt can show his hatred of the coup d'Ã©tat by making propaganda for Bonapartism, why should not I reveal \"my collusion\" with the secret police by exposing their abysmal perfidy? If the police had genuine proofs, why manufacture false ones?\n\nBut, lectures Professor Vogt,\n\n\"nevertheless the blow only fell on the members of the Marxian League in Cologne, only on the Marx party\".\n\nIndeed, Polonius! Had not the blow fallen on another party earlier on in Paris; did it not also strike another party later on in Berlin (the Ladendorf trial), and yet another in Bremen (League of the Dead)[66], etc., etc.?\n\nAs to the verdict passed on the Cologne accused I shall quote a relevant passage from my Revelations:\n\n\"The miracles performed by the police were originally necessary to conceal the completely political nature of the trial. 'The revelations you are about to witness, Gentlemen of the Jury,' said Saedt when opening for the prosecution, 'will prove to you that this trial is not a political trial.' But now\" (at the conclusion of the case) \"he emphasises its political character so that the police revelations should be forgotten. After the 1Â½-year preliminary investigation the jury needed objective evidence in order to justify itself before public opinion.\n\n\"After the five-week-long police comedy they needed 'politics pure and simple' to extricate themselves from the sheer mess. Saedt therefore did not only confine-himself to the material that had led the Indictment Board to the conclusion that 'there was no factual evidence of an indictable offence'. He went even further. He attempted to prove that the law against conspiracy does not require any indictable action, but is simply a law with a political purpose, and the category of conspiracy is therefore merely a pretext for burning political heretics in a legal way. The success of his attempt promised to be all the greater because of the decision to apply the new [Prussian] Penal Code that had been promulgated after the accused had been arrested. On the pretext that this code contained extenuating provisions the servile court was able to permit its retroactive application. But if it was simply a political trial why a preliminary investigation lasting 1Â½ years? For political reasons\" (loc. cit., pp. 71, 72).\n\n\"With the unmasking of the minute-book\" forged and planted by the Prussian police themselves \"the case had advanced to a new stage. The jury was no longer free merely to find the defendants guilty or not guilty; they must either find the defendants guiltyâor the government.\n\n\"To acquit the accused would mean condemning the government\" (loc. cit., p. 70).[ao]\n\nThat the Prussian Government of the day put a similar construction on the situation is plain from a communication that Hinckeldey sent to the Prussian Embassy in London while the Cologne trial was still in progress. In this he said that \"the whole existence of the political police depended on the outcome of the trial\". He accordingly asked for a person who could appear in court in the guise of the witness H.[ap] (who had disappeared), for which performance he would receive 1,000 talers reward. This person had actually been found when Hinckeldey's next letter arrived:\n\n\"The State Prosecutor hopes that thanks to the happy constitution of the jury it will be possible to get a verdict of guilty even without further extraordinary measures, and he\" (Hinckeldey) \"therefore asks you not to trouble yourselves further.\" (See Appendix 4.)\n\nIt was in fact the happy constitution of the jury in Cologne which inaugurated the Hinckeldey-Stieber regime in Prussia. \"A blow will be struck in Berlin if the Cologne accused are condemned\" was the view of the police rabble attached to the Prussian Embassy in London, as early as October 1852, even though the police mine (the Ladendorf conspiracy) did not explode in Berlin until the end of March 1853. (See Appendix 4.)\n\nThe liberal outcry that follows an age of reaction is all the louder the greater the cowardice displayed by liberals in putting up with the reaction for years on end without protest. Thus at the time of the Cologne trial, all my efforts to expose Stieber's system of deception in the liberal Prussian press were unavailing. The motto of the press, printed on its banner in block letters, ran: Reliability is the first duty of the citizen, and in this sign shalt thouâlive.[67]\n\n5. JOINT FESTIVAL OF THE GERMAN WORKERS'\n\nEDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN LAUSANNE\n\n(JUNE 26 AND 27, 1859)\n\nOur hero takes to his heels and with undiminished pleasure he retreats toâArcadia. We meet him again in a \"secluded corner of Switzerland\", in Lausanne, at a \"Joint Festival\" of a number of German workers' educational' associations which took place towards the end of June. Here Karl Vogt saved Switzerland for the second time. While Catiline was sitting in London, our Cicero with the gay-coloured jacket thundered in Lausanne:\n\n\"Jam, jam intelligis me acrius vigilare ad salutem, quam te ad perniciem reipublicae.\"[aq]\n\nBy happy chance there exists an authentic report on the above-mentioned \"Joint Festival\" and on the deed of valour performed during it by our \"well-rounded character\". Written by Herr G. Lommel with the collaboration of Vogt, it is entitled Das Centralfest der Deutschen Arbeiterbildungsvereine in der Westschweiz (Lausanne 1859), Geneva, 1859, Markus Vaney, rue de la Croix d'or. Let us compare the authentic report with the \"Magnum Opus\", which appeared five months later. The report contains Cicero-Vogt's speech \"delivered by himself\" and in it he begins by explaining the mystery of his presence at this gathering. He appears among the workers, he harangues them, because\n\n\"grave accusations have latterly been made against him, accusations which, if they were true, were bound utterly to destroy the confidence placed in him and completely undermine all his political activities\". \"I have come,\" he goes on, \"I have specifically come here to protest publicly against the\" (above-mentioned) \"malicious underhand dealings\" (Report, pp. 6-7).\n\nHe has been accused of Bonapartist intrigues, he has to rescue his political activities and as is his wont he defends his skin with his tongue. After indulging in empty talk for an hour and a half, he recollects Demosthenes' admonition that \"action, action and once again action is the soul of eloquence\".[ar]\n\nBut what is action? In America there is a small animal called a skunk which has only one method of defending itself at moments of extreme danger: its offensive smell. When attacked it releases a substance from certain parts of its body which, if it touches your clothes, will ensure that they have to be burnt and, if it touches your skin, will banish you for a period from all human society. The smell is so horribly offensive that when hunters see that their dogs have accidentally started a skunk they will hurriedly take to their heels in greater panic than if they had found that a wolf or a tiger was pursuing them. For powder and lead is an adequate defence against wolves and tigers, but no antidote has been found to the a posteriori of a skunk.\n\nThat is what action is, says our orator, a naturalised citizen of the \"Kingdom of Animals\"[as], and bespatters his supposed persecutors with the following skunk-like effluent:\n\n\"But I would like to warn you of one thing above all else, and that is of the machinations of a small group of depraved men whose aims and efforts are all directed towards seducing the worker away from his job, implicating him in conspiracies and communist intrigues, and finally, after living from the sweat of his brow, driving him cold-bloodedly\" (i. e. after he has finished sweating) \"to his destruction. Now once again this small group is using every possible method\" (just keep it as general as possible!) \"to ensnare the workers' associations in its toils. Whatever they may say\" (about Vogt's Bonapartist intrigues) \"you may rest assured that their true aim is to exploit the worker for their own selfish ends and finally to abandon him to his fate\" (Report, p. 18. See Appendix).\n\nThe shameless impertinence with which this \"skunk\" accuses me and my friends of \"living from the sweat of the workers' brow\", when we have always sacrificed our private interests in order to defend those of the working class, and have done this gratis, is not even original. The mouchards of the December Gang hurled similar slanders at Louis Blanc, Blanqui, Raspail, etc. And not only that, for at all times and in all places the sycophants of the ruling class have always resorted to these despicable slanders to denigrate the literary and political champions of the oppressed classes. (See Appendix 5.)\n\nAfter this action our \"well-rounded character\" is incidentally no longer able to keep a straight face. The buffoon goes on to compare his \"persecutors\" who are walking about freely, with the \"Russians taken prisoner at Zorndorf\"[at][68]. And he compares himself withâwho would have guessed it!âFrederick the Great. Falstaff-Vogt remembers that Frederick the Great ran away from the first battle at which he was present. How much greater then is he who ran away without even waiting for the battle.{*9}\n\nThus far the adventures of the Joint Festival at Lausanne according to the authentic report. And \"now just look\" (as Fischart puts it) \"at our clammy-handed, parasitically stout, slovenly cook and pot holder\"[au] and see what a fine police purÃ©e Ã la Eulenspiegel he serves up five months later for the benefit of the German philistines.\n\n\"They wanted at all costs to create complications in Switzerland; some sort of blow was to be aimed ... at the policy of neutrality. I was informed that the Joint Festival of the Workers' Educational Associations was to be used to induce the workers to follow a route which they had firmly rejected. It was hoped that the lovely Festival would provide an opportunity for forming a secret committee to enter into communication with like-minded people in Germany and take God knows what steps\" (Vogt does not know, even though he was informed). \"There were all sorts of dark rumours and mysterious talk about the active intervention of the workers in German political affairs. I at once, resolved to oppose these intrigues and to exhort the workers anew to turn a deaf ear to all proposals of this sort. At the conclusion of the speech referred to above I gave a solemn warning, etc.\" (\"Magnum Opus\", pp. 180 [-81]).\n\nCicero-Vogt has already forgotten that at the start of his speech he let slip what had brought him to the Joint Festivalânot the neutrality of Switzerland but the need to save his own skin. His speech does not contain a single word about the intended plot against Switzerland, the conspiratorial intentions at the Joint Festival, the secret committee, the active intervention of the workers in German politics or proposals of \"this\" or any other \"sort\". Not a word about all these Stieberiads. His final warning was nothing but the warning of the honest Sikes in the Old Bailey who warned the jurymen not to listen to the \"infamous\" detectives who had caught him stealing.\n\n\"The events which immediately followed,\" Falstaff-Vogt declares (\"Magnum Opus\", p. 181), \"confirmed my forebodings.\"\n\nWhat does he mean, forebodings! But Falstaff has already forgotten that a few lines before he did not have \"forebodings\", but that he had been \"informed\", informed of the plans of the conspirators, and informed in detail! And what, you vengeful angel[aw], were the events which immediately followed?\n\n\"An article in the Allgemeine Zeitung imputed tendencies to the Festival and to the life of the workers which these\" (i. e. the Festival and the life) \"did not in the least have in mind.\" (Just as Vogt had imputed tendencies to the Murten Congress and the workers' organisations in general.) \"This article and a reprint of it in the Frankfurter Journal led to a confidential inquiry from the Ambassador of a South German state in which the Festival was given the importance\"â\"imputed\" to it by the article in the Allgemeine Zeitung and the reprint in the Frankfurter Journal?âby no means!â\"which it ought to have had if the intentions of the Brimstone Gang had not been frustrated.\"[ax]\n\nOught to have had! Yes indeed!\n\nAlthough the most superficial comparison of the \"Magnum Opus\" and the authentic report on the Joint Festival is enough to clear up the mystery of Cicero-Vogt's second rescue of Switzer-land, I nevertheless wished to ascertain whether there was any factual basis, however slender, that might have given him the \"matter\" which provided him with his \"energy\"[70]. I wrote, therefore, to the editor of the authentic report, Herr G. Lommel in Geneva[ay]. Herr Lommel must have been on friendly terms with Vogt since he not only collaborated with him on the report on the Joint Festival in Lausanne but also, in a subsequent pamphlet about the Schiller and Robert Blum memorial celebrations in Geneva[az], he covered up the fiasco that Vogt had brought upon himself there. In his reply of April 13, 1860, Herr Lommel, who is personally unknown to me, wrote:\n\n\"Vogt's story that he had frustrated a dangerous conspiracy in Lausanne is the sheerest fairy-tale or lie; he only went to Lausanne because it was an opportunity to make a speech which he could afterwards print. In the speech, which lasted 1Â½ hours, he defended himself against allegations that he was in the pay of Bonaparte. I still have the manuscript in safe keeping.\"\n\nA Frenchman living in Geneva, when asked about the same Vogtian conspiracy, replied bluntly:\n\n\"Il faut connaÃ®tre cet individu\" (namely Vogt), \"surtout le faiseur, l'homme important, toujours hors de la nature et de la vÃ©ritÃ©.\"[ba]\n\nVogt himself declares on p. 99 of his so-called Studien[bb] that he \"had never laid claim to prophetic gifts\". But we know from the Old Testament that the ass could see what the prophet had missed[bc]. And so we can understand how Vogt managed to see the conspiracy which in November 1859 he had forebodings of having \"frustrated\" in June 1859.\n\n6. MISCELLANY\n\n\"If my memory does not deceive me,\" our Parliamentary Clown writes, \"the circular\" (i. e. an alleged address to the proletarians dated London 1850) \"was indeed written by a follower of Marx's known as Parliamentary Wolf, and it was allowed to fall into the hands of the Hanover police. Here too we find this same channel turning up in the history of the circular 'of the patriots to the men of Gotha'\" (\"Magnum Opus\", p. 144).\n\nA channel turns up! A prolapsus ani[bd], perhaps, you zoological jester?\n\nAs to \"Parliamentary Wolf\"âand we shall see later on why, like a bad dream, Parliamentary Wolf weighs so heavily on the memory of our Parliamentary Clownâhe published the following statement in the Berlin Volks-Zeitung, the Allgemeine Zeitung and the Hamburg Reform:\n\n\"Statement. Manchester, February 6, 1860: I see from the letter of a friend that the National-Zeitung (No. 41 of this year) has brought the following passage to the attention of the public in a leading article based on Vogt's pamphlet:\n\n\"'In 1850 another circular was dispatched from London to the proletarians in Germany, written, as Vogt believes he remembers, by Parliamentary Wolf, alias Casemate Wolf. The circular was allowed simultaneously to fall into the hands of the Hanover police.' I have seen neither the relevant issue of the National-Zeitung nor the Vogt pamphlet and would like therefore to direct my answer solely to the passage just cited:\n\n\"1. In 1850 I was living not in London but in Zurich, and I did not move to London until the summer of 1851.\n\n\"2. I have never in the whole of my life written a circular addressed either to 'proletarians' or to anyone else.\n\n\"3. As to the insinuation about the Hanover police I hereby return this shamelessly invented accusation to its author with contempt. If the remainder of Vogt's pamphlet is as full of impudent lies as the part that refers to me it is a worthy fellow to the fabrications of Chenu, de la Hodde & Co.\n\nW.Wolff\"[be]\n\nThere you are: just as Cuvier could construct the whole skeleton of an animal from a single bone, Wolff has correctly constructed Vogt's whole fabrication from a single fragmentary quotation. Karl Vogt can indeed stand beside Chenu and de la Hodde as primus inter pares.\n\nThe last \"proof\" adduced by Vogt, who is still \"by no means at a loss\", to demonstrate my entente cordiale with .the secret police in general and \"my relations with the Kreuz-Zeitung party in particular\", consists in the argument that my wife is the sister of the retired Prussian Minister Herr von Westphalen (\"Magnum Opus\", p. 194). Now how to parry the cowardly stratagem of our fat Falstaff? Perhaps the Clown will forgive my wife the cognate Prussian Minister[bf] when he learns of the agnate Scotsman[bf]who was beheaded in the market-place in Edinburgh as a rebel in the war of liberation against James II. It is well known that it is only by accident that Vogt still carries his own head around. For at the Robert Blum celebrations of the German Workers' Educational Association in Geneva (November 13, 1859) he reported\n\n\"how the Left of the Frankfurt Parliament was for a long time undecided who to send to Vienna, Blum or him. Finally, the matter was decided by lot, by drawing a piece of straw, which fell upon Blum, or rather against him\" (Die Schillerfeier zu Genf usw., Geneva, 1859, pp. 28, 29).\n\nOn October 13 Robert Blum set out from Frankfurt for Vienna. On October 23 or 24 a deputation of the extreme Left in Frankfurt arrived in Cologne on the way to the Democratic Congress in Berlin[71]. I met these gentlemen, among whom were several Members of Parliament who had close bonds with the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. These parliamentarians, of whom one was summarily shot during the campaign for the Imperial Constitution, a second died in exile, while the third still lives, whispered all sorts of strange and sinister stories in my ear about Vogt's intrigues in connection with Robert Blum's mission to Vienna.\n\nHowever,\n\nBid me not speak, bid me be silent,\n\nTo keep the secret I am bound.[bh]\n\nThe Robert Blum celebrations of November 1859 in Geneva to which we have already referred treated our \"well-rounded character\" most unkindly. On entering the premises, waddling like an obsequious Silenus at the heels of his patron, James Fazy, a worker was heard to say: There's Harry with Falstaff after him. When he told a delightful anecdote designed to present himself as the alter ego of Robert Blum, it was only with difficulty that some infuriated workers were prevented from storming the podium. And when, finally, forgetting how he had frustrated the revolution in June, he himself \"called yet again for the barricades\"[bi] (Schillerfeier, p. 29) a mocking echo repeated: \"Barricadesâshmarricades!\" Abroad, however, people know so well just what value they are to place on Vogt's revolutionary mouthings that the \"confidential inquiry from a South German Ambassador\"[bj], usually unavoidable, was unforthcoming on this occasion and no article appeared in the Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\nVogt's entire Stieberiad from the \"Brimstone Gang'' to the \"retired Minister\" reveals the sort of Mastersinger of whom Dante says:\n\nEd egli avea fatto del cul trombetta.{*10}\n\nOriginal notes\n\n{*6} I did not learn until after the Revelations were in print that de la Hodde (under the name Duprez) as well as the Prussian police agents Beckmann (then correspondent of the \"KÃ¶lnische Zeitung\") and Sommer were also involved.\n\n{*7} \"Smoke-bombs or stink-bombs are used chiefly in mine warfare. One works with an ordinary flare-charge which must however contain rather more sulphur than usual and as much feathers, horn, hair and other rubbish as the charge will take. This is put in a container and the shell fired with a fuse\" (F. C. PlÃ¼micke, Handbuch fÃ¼r die KÃ¶niglich Preussischen Artillerie-Offiziere, Erster Teil, Berlin, 1820).\n\n{*8} I replied with a pamphlet called The Knight of the Noble Consciousness, New York, 1853.\n\n{*9} Kobes I[69] relates in Jacob Venedey's pamphlet Pro domo und pro patria gegen Karl Vogt, Hanover, 1860: \"He was a witness to the fact that the Imperial Regent, Karl Vogt, was not present when we and the four other Imperial Regents forced the Government of WÃ¼rttemberg to bring the Parliament to an honourable end with sword and bayonet. It is an amusing story. The other four Imperial Regents had already entered the carriage to go to the Assembly Room, as agreed, and there together with the Rump Parliament [...] to put on a bold front\" (it is well known that the Rump Parliament had no head). [Venedey says here: die Brust bieten (literally, to present the breast). The phrase is an adaptation of the German idiomatic expression die Stirn bieten (to present the forehead) which means \"to put on a bold front\". Marx puns on Venedey's substitution of Brust (breast) for Stirn (forehead) to stress that the Rump Parliament had no head.] \"Karl Vogt slammed the carriage-door shut and called to the coachman: 'You go on ahead, the carriage is full up, I shall follow on!' But Karl Vogt only appeared [...] after all possible danger was over\" (loc. cit., pp. 23, 24).\n\n{*10} And he made a trumpet of his rear.

Its aim was to fight against the Bonapartist regime of the Second Empire.\n\n[51] The Communist League was the first German and international communist organisation of the proletariat formed under the leadership of Marx and Engels in London early in June 1847, as a result of the reorganisation of the League of the Just (a secret association of refugee workers and artisans that was set up in Paris in the 1830s and had communities in Germany, France, Switzerland and England). The programme and organisational principles of the Communist League were drawn up with the direct participation of Marx and Engels. The League's members took an active part in the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Germany in 1848-49. Although the defeat of the revolution dealt a blow to the League, in 1849-50 it was reorganised and continued its activities. In the summer of 1850 disagreements arose in the League between the supporters of Marx and Engels and the sectarian Willich-Schapper group, which tried to impose on the League its tactics of immediately unleashing a revolution without taking into account the actual situation and the practical possibilities. The discord led to a split within the League in September 1850. Because of police persecutions and arrests of League members in May 1851, the activities of the League as an organisation practically ceased in Germany. On November 17, 1852, on a motion by Marx, the League's London District announced the dissolution of the League (see Marx's letter to Engels of November 19, 1852). On February 24, 1860 Marx sent this letter to Legal Counsellor Weber (see present edition, Vol. 41).\n\nThe Communist League played an outstanding role as the first proletarian party guided by the principles of scientific communism, as a school of proletarian revolutionaries and as the historical forerunner of the International Working Men's Association.\n\n[52] See Marx's Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 445-49). This work was published as a pamphlet in Basle, Switzerland, in January 1853 (the edition used by Vogt). In the USA it was first published in instalments in the democratic Boston Neu-England-Zeitung and at the end of April 1853 it was printed in pamphlet form by the same newspaper. In Herr Vogt Marx quotes the Revelations from the Boston pamphlet.\n\n[53] The Palais Royal in Paris was the residence of JerÃ´me Bonaparte (the youngest brother of Napoleon I) and his son, Prince Joseph (nicknamed Plon-Plon).\n\n[54] The German-American Revolutionary Loan was a loan that Gottfried Kinkel and other petty-bourgeois Ã©migrÃ© leaders, tried to raise in 1851 and 1852 among German refugees and Americans of German origin with a view to immediately inciting a revolution in Germany. To win support for the loan, Kinkel toured the USA in September 1851. The project proved a total failure. In a number of their works Marx and Engels ridiculed the loan as an adventurist and harmful attempt artificially to engineer a revolution during a lull in the revolutionary movement.\n\n[55] At the battle of Murten (June 22, 1476), fought in the course of the Burgundian Wars, the troops of Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy were defeated by the Swiss.\n\n[56] In St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt am Main, the Frankfurt National Assembly met in 1848 and 1849.\n\n[57] The Grand Cophta was the name of the omnipotent and omniscient Egyptian priest who headed the nonexistent Masonic \"Egyptian Lodge\" which the famous eighteenth-century impostor \"Count\" Cagliostro (Giuseppe Balsamo) claimed to have founded.\n\n[58] The Federal Councilâthe Government of the Swiss Confederation.\n\n[59] In September 1851 arrests were made in France among members of local communities belonging to the Willich-Schapper group, which was responsible for the split in the Communist League in September 1850. The petty-bourgeois conspiratorial tactics of the group, ignoring realities and aiming at an immediate uprising, enabled the French and Prussian police, with the help of the agent-provocateur Cherval, who headed one of the group's local communities in Paris, to fabricate the case of the so-called Franco-German plot. Cherval was both an agent of the Prussian envoy in Paris and a French spy. In February 1852 the accused were sentenced on a charge of plotting a coup d'Ã©tat. With the connivance of the French and Prussian police Cherval was allowed to escape from prison. The attempts of the Prussian police to incriminate the Communist League led by Marx and Engels failed. Konrad Schramm, a League, member, arrested in Paris in September 1851, was soon released owing to lack of evidence. Nevertheless, the Prussian Police Superintendent Stieber, one of the organisers of the Cologne Communist trial in 1852, repeated the false police accusations. Marx exposed Stieber's perjury in his Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (see the chapter \"The Cherval Plot\", present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 407-19).\n\nOn his arrival in London in May 1852 Cherval was admitted to the German Workers' Educational Society led by Schapper but was soon expelled because of his role of provocateur in the so-called Franco-German plot.\n\n[60] The Cologne trial (October 4-November 12, 1852) was organised and stage-managed by the Prussian Government. The defendants were members of the Communist League arrested in the spring of 1851 on charges of \"treasonable plotting\". The forged documents and false evidence presented by the police authorities were not only designed to secure the conviction of the defendants but also to compromise their London comrades and the proletarian organisation as a whole. Seven of the defendants were sentenced to imprisonment in a fortress for terms ranging from three to six years. The dishonest tactics resorted to by the Prussian police state in fighting the international working-class movement were exposed by Engels in his article \"The Late Trial in Cologne\" and, in greater detail, by Marx in his pamphlet Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (see present edition, Vol. 11).\n\n[61] The German Workers' Educational Society in London was founded in February 1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other members of the League of the Just (an organisation of German craftsmen and workers, and also of emigrant workers of other nationalities). After the reorganisation of the League of the Just in the summer of 1847 and the founding of the Communist League, the latter's local communities played the leading role in the Society. During various periods of its activity, the Society had branches in working-class districts in London. In 1847 and 1849-50, Marx and Engels took an active part in the Society's work, but on September 17, 1850, Marx, Engels and a number of their followers withdrew because the Willich-Schapper sectarian and adventurist faction had temporarily increased its influence in the Society, causing a split in the Communist League (see present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 483, 632). In the late 1850s, Marx and Engels resumed their work in the Educational Society, which was active up to 1918, when it was closed down by the British Government.\n\n[62] Karl Vogt was one of the five members of the Imperial Regency.\n\nThe Regency of the Empire was formed in Stuttgart on June 6, 1849 by what remained of the Frankfurt National Assembly. The Regency consisted of five deputies representing the Left faction (moderate democrats), including Karl Vogt. Their attempts to ensure by parliamentary means the implementation of the Constitution drawn up by the Frankfurt Assembly and rejected by the German princes ended in total failure.\n\nThe Frankfurt Parliament or the German National Assembly, opened in Frankfurt am Main on May 18, 1848. It was convened to unify the country and draw up a Constitution. The liberal deputies, who were in the majority, turned the Assembly into a mere debating club. At the decisive moments of the revolution, the liberal majority condoned the counter-revolutionary forces. In spring 1849, the liberals left the Assembly after the Prussian and other governments had rejected the Imperial Constitution' that it had drawn up. What remained of the Assembly (the Rump) moved to Stuttgart and was dispersed by the Wï¿½rttemberg forces on June 18.\n\n[63] An allusion to the denunciatory prophecies of Zacharias, one of the twelve minor prophets of the Old Testament.\n\n[64] The Hambach Festival was a political demonstration held by members of the liberal and radical bourgeoisie at the castle of Hambach (in the Bavarian Palatinate) on May 27, 1832 to urge the unification of Germany, constitutional reforms and the transformation of Germany into a federal republic.\n\n[65] The German socialist Eichhoff was Berlin correspondent of the weekly Hermann. In September and October 1859 he anonymously published in it a series of articles headed \"Stieber\" in which he exposed the part played by Wilhelm Stieber, chief of the Prussian political police, in organising the government-inspired trial of members of the Communist League in Cologne in 1852. Stieber sued Eichhoff for libel. In May 1860 a Berlin court sentenced Eichhoff to 14 months imprisonment (see Marx's letters to Engels of January 31, 1860 and to Freiligrath of February 29, 1860, present edition, Vol. 41).\n\n[66] The Ladendorf trialâthe trial of Ladendorf, Gercke, Falkenthal, Levy and several other persons arrested in 1853 on the basis of a denunciation by police agent Hentze, a former member of the Communist League. The trial was held in Berlin in 1854. On trumped-up charges of plotting, the defendants were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment (from three to five years).\n\nThe League of the Dead was a secret conspiratorial organisation in Bremen in the 1840s and early 1850s. It was uncovered by the police in 1852.\n\n[67] Here Marx paraphrases two expressions: \"Tranquillity is the first duty of the citizen\", a dictum coined by the Prussian minister Schulenburg-Kehnert in his address to the population of Berlin of October 17, 1806, following the defeat at Jena (Le Moniteur universel, No. 304, October 31, 1806, \"Prusse\", Berlin, du 18 octobre), and \"In hoc signo vinces\" (\"By this sign thou shalt conquer\"). Legend has it that on the eve of a battle against his rival Maxentius in 312, the Roman Emperor Constantine (274-337) saw in the sky the sign of the Cross and over it the words \"In hoc signo vinces\". The Church associates this legend with Constantine's \"conversion\" from the persecution of Christianity to its protection.\n\n[68] At the battle of Zorndorf, fought in the course of the Seven Years' War on August 14 (25), 1758, the Prussian army, commanded by Frederick II, clashed with the Russian forces. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The outcome of the battle was inconclusive.\n\n[69] Kobes I was the nickname of Jacob Venedey, who was born in Cologne. In the Cologne dialect, Kobes stands for Jacob. Venedey owed the nickname to Heinrich Heine, who in a satirical poem headed \"Kobes I\" ridiculed him as a model philistine.\n\n[70] An ironic allusion to the book Kraft und Stoff (Energy and Matter) (1855) by the German physiologist Ludwig BÃ¼chner, a vulgar materialist like Vogt.\n\n[71] This refers to the Second Democratic Congress of representatives of democratic and workers' organisations from various German towns which was held in Berlin from October 26 to 30, 1848.\n\nHerr Vogt\n\nIV\n\nTechow's Letter\n\nWhat else does our \"well-rounded character\" pull out of that\n\n\"tristo sacco Che merda fa di quel, che si trangugia.\" (Dante){*11}\n\nA letter from Techow dated London, August 26, 1850:\n\n\"I cannot characterise these activities better\" (i. e. of the \"Brimstone Gang\") \"than by imparting to you the contents of a letter from a man whom all who have ever known him will acknowledge as a man of honour, a letter which I may permit myself to publish because it\"[a] (the man of honour or the letter?) \"was expressly intended for communication\" (to whom?) \"and the considerations\" (whose?) \"which earlier militated against publication no longer obtain\" (\"Magnum Opus\", p. 141).\n\nTechow arrived in London from Switzerland at the end of August 1850. His letter is addressed to Schimmelpfennig, formerly a lieutenant in the Prussian army, who lived in Berne at the time. Schimmelpfennig was supposed to \"communicate the letter to our friends\", i. e. the members of the Centralisation[72], a secret society now extinct for nearly a decade, set up by German refugees in Switzerland with a rather mixed membership and a strong leavening of parliamentarians. Techow was a member of the society, but Vogt and his friends were not. How then did Vogt come into possession of Techow's letter and who authorised him to publish it?\n\nTechow himself wrote to me on the subject from Australia on April 17, 1860:\n\n\"At any rate, I have never had occasion to give Herr Karl Vogt any authorisation in connection with this matter.\"\n\nOf the \"friends\" of Techow to whom the letter was to be communicated only two are still living in Switzerland. Both may speak for themselves:\n\nE.[b] to Schily, April 29, 1860, Upper Engadine, Grisons Canton:\n\n\"When Vogt's pamphlet Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung appeared, containing a letter from Techow to his friends in Switzerland dated August 26, 1850[c], we, the friends of Techow still living in Switzerland, resolved to write to Vogt to express our disapproval of his unauthorised publication of the letter. Techow's letter had been addressed to Schimmelpfennig in Berne and the intention was to distribute copies of it among friends.... I am glad that we were not mistaken in our belief that none of Techow's friends, none of those who had a right to see the letter of August 26, had used it after the manner of the man who has by accident come into possession of it. On January 22 a letter was dispatched to Vogt protesting against the unauthorised publication of Techow's letter, forbidding any further misuse of it and demanding the return of the letter. On January 27 Vogt replied: 'Techow's letter was intended to be shown to his friends; the friend who had it in his possession had handed it over with the express wish that it should be published ... and he would only return the letter to the man from whom he had received it.'\"\n\nB.[d] to Schily, Zurich, May 1, 1860[73]:\n\n\"The letter to Vogt was written by me after I had discussed the matter with E.... R.[e] was not among the 'friends' for whom Techow's letter was intended. From the contents of the letter, however, it was perfectly clear to Vogt that it had been addressed to me among others, but he took good care not to ask me for permission to publish it.\"\n\nThe solution to the riddle is contained in a passage from Schily's letter quoted earlier and which I have saved up for this moment. He writes:\n\n\"I must say something here about Ranickel because it is through him that Techow's letter must have fallen into Vogt's hands, a point in your letter which I had almost overlooked. This letter was written by Techow to friends he had lived with in Zurich: Schimmelpfennig, B. and E. As their friend and Techow's, I was also able to read it later on. When I was brutally and summarily expelled from Switzerland (without any previous order of expulsion having been made I was simply arrested in the street in Geneva and immediately transported from there), I was not permitted to go back to my lodgings to arrange my affairs. From the prison in Berne I wrote to a reliable man in Geneva, a master shoemaker called Thum, asking him to find one or other of my friends who might be still in Geneva (for I did not know whether the same fate had not befallen any of them), who could pack up my belongings and send the most valuable of them to me in Berne, putting the remainder into safe keeping for the time being. I wanted that person to sort out my papers taking particular care to ensure that nothing should be forwarded to me which could not survive the transit through France. Thum did as I asked him and Techow's letter remained behind. My belongings included a number of papers relating to a rebellion of the parliamentarians against the Geneva local committee for the distribution of money for the refugees (the committee consisted of three Geneva citizens, among them Thum, and two refugees, Becker and myself). Ranickel was familiar with these as he had taken the side of the committee against the parliamentarians. For this reason I had asked Thum as the treasurer and archivist of the committee to take out those papers with Ranickel's help. It may now be the case that, having a legitimate reason for being present while my papers were being sorted, Ranickel somehow got his hands on Techow's letter. Perhaps it was given him by one of the sorters. I do not by any means dispute the transfer of the letter into his possession, as distinct from the transfer of property rights from me to him. On the contrary, I claim the latter quite explicitly. I soon wrote to Ranickel from London asking him to send me the letter. However, he did not do so and his culpa manifesta[g] dates from that time. At the beginning it was probably only levis[h] but it then mounted, depending on the extent of his complicity in the unauthorised publication of the letter, to magna or maxima culpa[i] or even to dolus[j]. I do not doubt for a single moment that his publication of the letter was unauthorised and that none of the addressees had given their permission, but I shall nevertheless write to E. for confirmation of this. Nor can it be doubted that Ranickel assisted in the publication, given his notorious intimacy with Vogt. And even though I do not wish in the least to criticise that intimacy, I cannot refrain from pointing out the contrast with their earlier relationship. For Ranickel had not only been one of the greatest enemies of the parliamentarians in general; he had also uttered the most blood-curdling threats in regard to the Imperial Regent in particular. 'I'll strangle the fellow,' he would shout, 'even if I have to go to Berne to do it', and we had to forcibly restrain him from carrying out his regicidal intention. But now that the scales seem to have fallen from his eyes, and Saul has turned into Paul[k]. I am very curious to see how he will worm his way out of another obligation: that of becoming the avenger of Europe. I have fought a hard struggle, he would say in the days when he was hesitating between Europe and America, but now it is at an end. I shall remain andâ avenge myself!! Let Byzantium tremble.\"[l]\n\nThus far Schily's letter.\n\nRanickel, then, unearthed[m] Techow's letter among the papers left behind by Schily. Notwithstanding Schily's request for it from London, he retained it. The letter misappropriated in this way was handed by \"friend\" Ranickel to \"friend\" Vogt, and \"friend\" Vogt, with his characteristic delicacy of conscience, declared himself authorised to publish the letter since Vogt and Ranickel are \"friends\". Anyone, therefore, who writes a letter to be \"communicated\" to \"friends\", necessarily writes for the benefit of \"friends\" Vogt and Ranickelâarcades ambo.[n]\n\nI must apologise if this peculiar sort of jurisprudence leads me back to long-past and half-forgotten events. But Ranickel has started it and I must follow.\n\nThe \"Communist League\" was founded in Paris in 1836, originally under another name[o]. The organisation that gradually evolved was as follows: a certain number of members formed a \"community\", the different communities in the same town constituted a \"district\" [Kreis] and a varying number of districts. were joined together into \"leading districts\" [leitende Kreise]. At the head of the whole stood the \"Central Authority\" which was elected at a congress consisting of deputies from all the districts, but which had the right to add to its own numbers and, in emergencies, to nominate its successor on a provisional basis. The Central Authority was based first in Paris, and then, from 1840 to the beginning of 1848, in London. The chairmen of the communities and districts and the Central Authority itself were elected. This democratic constitution, utterly unsuitable for conspiratorial secret societies, was not incompatible, to say the least, with the tasks facing a propaganda association. The activities of the \"League\" consisted first of all in founding public German workers' educational associations, and the majority . of the associations of this sort, which still exist in Switzerland, England, Belgium and the United States, were founded either directly by the \"League\" or else by people who had at one time belonged to it. The constitution of these workers' associations is accordingly the same everywhere. One day per week was devoted to discussion, another to social activities (singing, recitations, etc.). Libraries were set up everywhere, and where possible classes in elementary education were started for the instruction of the workers. The \"League\" standing behind the public educational associations, and guiding them, found them both the most convenient forum for public propaganda and also a reservoir whose most useful members could replenish and swell its own ranks. In view of the itinerant life of German artisans it was only on rare occasions that the Central Authority had to send special emissaries.\n\nAs far as the secret doctrine of the \"League\" is concerned, it underwent all the transformations of French and English socialism and communism, as well as their German versions (e. g. Weitling's fantasies). After 1839, as is made clear in the Bluntschli report[p], the religious question came to play the most important role alongside the social problem. The various phases undergone by German philosophy from 1839 to 1846 were followed with the most lively interest in these workers' societies. The secret form of the society goes back to its Paris origins. The chief purpose of the Leagueâpropaganda among workers in Germanyâdictated the retention of this form in later years. During my first stay in Paris[q] I established personal contact with the leaders of the \"League\" living there as well as with the leaders of the majority of the secret French workers' associations, without however becoming a member of any of them. In Brussels, where Guizot's expulsion order had sent me, I, together with Engels, W. Wolff and others, founded the German Workers' Educational Society[74], which is still in existence. At the same time we published a series of pamphlets[r], partly printed, partly lithographed, in which we mercilessly criticised the hotchpotch of Franco-English socialism or communism and German philosophy, which formed the secret doctrine of the \"League\" at that time. In its place we proposed the scientific study of the economic structure of bourgeois society as the only tenable theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we argued in popular form that it was not a matter of putting some utopian system into effect, but of conscious participation in the historical process revolutionising society before our very eyes. In consequence of these activities the London Central Authority entered into correspondence with us and at the end of 1846 they sent one of their members, a watchmaker called Joseph Moll, who later fell as a soldier of the revolution on the field of battle in Baden[s], to Brussels to invite us to join the \"League\". Moll allayed our doubts and objections by revealing that the Central Authority intended to convoke a Congress of the League in London where the critical views we had expressed would be laid down in an open manifesto as the doctrine of the League. He argued, however,. that if backward and refractory elements were to be overcome, our participation in person was indispensable, but that this could only be arranged if we became members of the \"League\". Accordingly, we joined it. The Congress, at which members from Switzerland, France, Belgium, Germany and England were represented, took place[t], and after heated debate over several weeks it adopted the Manifesto of the Communist Party[u] written by Engels and myself, which appeared in print at the beginning of 1848 and was later translated into English, French, Danish and Italian. On the outbreak of the February revolution the London Central Authority entrusted me with the leadership of the \"League\". During the revolutionary period in Germany, its activities died down of themselves, since more effective avenues existed now for the realisation of its ends. When, in the late summer of 1849, I arrived in London after being expelled from France for a second time, I found that the Central Authority had been reconstructed from the ruins and that the links with the reconstituted districts of the League in Germany had been re-established. Willich arrived in London a few months later and was admitted to the Central Authority at my suggestion. He had been recommended to me by Engels, who acted as his adjutant in the campaign for the Imperial Constitution. To round off the history of the League I would only remark that there was a split in the Central Authority on September 15, 1850[v]. Its majority, including Engels and myself, transferred the seat of the Central Authority to Cologne, which had long been the \"leading district\" for Central and Southern Germany and which, after London, was the most important centre of intellectual activity.\n\nWe resigned from the London Workers' Educational Society at the same time. The minority on the Central Authority, however, including Willich and Schapper, set up a separate League[75] which maintained relations with the Workers' Educational Society and also resumed contact with Switzerland and France, which had been interrupted since 1848. On November 12, 1852 the accused in the Cologne communist trial were condemned. A few days later, at my suggestion, the League was declared dissolved[w]. I included a document, relating to the dissolution, dated November 1852, in the dossier on my action against the National-Zeitung. The reason given there for the dissolution of the League is that with the arrests in Germany, i.e. from as early as the spring of 1851, all contact with the Continent had in any case ceased to exist and that moreover circumstances were no longer favourable for a propaganda society of this sort. A few months later, at the beginning of 1853, the Willich-Schapper separate League also died a natural death.\n\nThe issues of principle which underlay the split mentioned above are set out in my Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial[x], which contains an extract from the minutes of the meeting of the Central Authority of September 15, 1850. The immediate practical cause of the split was Willich's efforts to involve the \"League\" in the revolutionary escapades of the German democratic emigration. The disagreem"
