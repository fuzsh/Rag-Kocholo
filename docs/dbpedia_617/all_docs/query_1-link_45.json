The commander of 116th Panzer, Siegfried von Waldenburg, later regarded the reverse suffered in and around Hotton as the turning point for his division during the battle. He observed after the war, ‘Our own casualties for the battle of Hotton were heavy; several of our tanks were lost through enemy artillery, others were damaged. Gradually the troops came to realise that what was to have been the deciding blow must have failed, or that victory could not be won; with that, morale and then efficiency began to suffer.’ For a fuller account of the battle, see: http://www.batarden.be/site/en/histoire-de-la-roche-dans-la-bataille-des-ardennes.html\n\n6.

This was a conscious move by the Reichswehr in the aftermath of the revolutions of 1918–20 throughout Germany to make sure that middle- and lower-class revolutionaries did not enter the ranks of the German officer class, particularly the infantry and cavalry. Hence the disproportionate number of officers bearing the titles of ‘von’, ‘Ritter’(knight), ‘Freiherr’ (baron), and ‘Graf’ (count). Logically, aristocrats tended to be better-educated and thus proficient in the many examinations needed for promotion and entry into the General Staff. Nevertheless there were fewer nobles than in the pre-1918 Kaiser’s army. Men from humbler backgrounds gravitated towards Nazi organisations where background was not a barrier to advancement, though there were many nobles in both the Luftwaffe and SS.\n\n8. Heinz Linge, With Hitler to the End (Frontline, 2009), p. 164.\n\n9. The idea, apparently, was Göring’s. On 2 August 1944 in East Prussia, he proposed that as ‘an outward token of gratitude for Hitler’s miraculous escape on 20 July the entire Wehrmacht (army, navy and air force) should adopt the Hitler salute forthwith’. It was signed into law the same day. Göring had learned the key link man in the conspiracy, shuttling between the main players, was Luftwaffe Lieutenant-Colonel Caesar von Hofacker, a cousin to Stauffenberg. Perhaps Göring’s offer to change the salute was to deflect any stain from his service. David Irving, Hitler’s War (Hodder & Stoughton, 1977), p. 677.\n\n10.

A 60,000-acre site, the Maybach bunker complexes were constructed in 1934–5, with subterranean communication links to the military commands in central Berlin. Fast-moving Soviet forces occupied the virtually intact Zossen bunker facilities on 20 April 1945. When a telephone suddenly rang, one of the Russian soldiers answered it. The caller was a senior German officer asking what was happening. ‘Ivan is here,’ the soldier replied in Russian. The two Maybach bunkers were destroyed in 1946, but the communications centre, code-named Zeppelin, remains, being used by the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War. It was manned for more than three decades, abandoned only when Russian troops pulled out in 1994, and is now open to the public as a museum.\n\n2. The best modern account is Oberst Karl-Heinz Frieser, The Blitzkrieg Legend: The 1940 Campaign in the West (Naval Institute Press, 2005). Consequently historians now view blitzkrieg as the consequence of victory in May 1940, rather than its cause.\n\n3. The controversial David Irving has written that ‘Percy Schramm was himself a mediocre historian, and the published volume of the Kriegstagebuch des Oberkommandos der Wehrmacht for 1942–3, written by his colleague Helmuth Greiner, is largely faked. I obtained Greiner’s real diary and handwritten notes and private letters from his widow and you can see from them the post-war fakery that went into the published edition.’ Irving’s admonition is an undeserved insult to the highly distinguished Schramm. While not disputing that the OKW Kriegstagebuch, from which I quote throughout this book, was pieced together after the war, and occasionally embellished, there is no indication it was a fake. Rather, because the original was burned in 1945, it is a reconstruction from the surviving fragments and the memories of Schramm and Greiner, and stands as a perfectly legitimate historical document. As an Official Historian of UK and NATO military operations in Bosnia and Iraq, I have experienced similar moments where speeches, conversations and documents have had to be reconstructed in the absence of the originals, lost or destroyed.

General der Infanterie Hans Krebs (1898–1945) served in the 78th Infantry Regiment from September 1914 to July 1919, and held staff positions from 1929. Krebs, who spoke fluent Russian, became an assistant to the military attaché in Moscow, 1933–4. His subsequent career was that of chief of staff of various formations, rising to Generalmajor when Chief of Staff of Model’s Ninth Army in February 1942. In March 1943, he was made Chief of Staff of Army Group Centre and promoted to Generalleutnant, for which he received a Knight’s Cross, and followed his old boss to Army Group ‘B’ from September 1944 until February 1945 when he was appointed Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff. In succession to Heinz Guderian, on 1 April 1945, Krebs was appointed last Chief of the Army General Staff (OKH) and remained in the Führerbunker below the Reich Chancellery during Hitler’s final moments. With the Russians yards away, he and General Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide in the early morning hours of 2 May 1945.\n\n21. Speer, Inside the Third Reich, p. 395.\n\n22.

The earlier V-1 (doodlebug) flying bomb attack on Britain started during the night of 13–14 June 1944; a total of 10,500 missiles would be launched; 3,957 were destroyed by anti-aircraft defences and fighters, but 3,531 reached England and 2,353 fell on London. The death toll from this last blitz was 6,184 killed and 17,981 seriously injured. Of the 1,115 V-2 rockets launched against England, 517 fell on London, killing 2,754 people and injuring 6,523. The last V-1 was destroyed over Sittingbourne in Kent on 27 March 1945. Two days later the last V-2 fell on Orpington in Kent.\n\n10. Speer, Inside the Third Reich, op. cit., pp. 409–10.\n\n11.

In series 2, Episode 12 (Killing Hitler) of the Unsolved History TV documentary series, first aired in February 2004, Hitler’s conference room and the heavy map table it contained were rebuilt several times to the exact same dimensions. A briefcase left under the table, which held a like amount of explosive of the same destructive power, was similarly detonated and the results recorded, measured and analysed. They prove, to my satisfaction, that Hitler’s life was saved on 20 July 1944 only by an adjutant casually moving the briefcase to the far side of a thick table leg. Two identical rooms and tables were built and destroyed in these experiments, with the briefcase on different sides of the table leg, near to a mannequin of Hitler and away from him. The briefcase bomb nearest Hitler would undoubtedly have killed him. The one furthest from him had the destructive force of the blast contained and deflected by the table leg, mimicking what happened on the day. Stauffenberg’s bomb, unluckily, was an incredibly near-miss.\n\n22. Courtesy of Professor Theodore Hesburgh, President of the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. The communication of a vision is a vital aspect of leadership. John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Margaret Thatcher and Barack Obama are all examples of political leaders with a vision. Their vision does not necessarily have to be popular, but a vision brings a far-sighted strategic sense of direction and purpose, which is often preferable to the short-term, tactical leader who is reactive.\n\n23. Unlike many of the early Nazis who were descended from Bavarian, southern German or Austrian Catholic families, the Bormann brothers were born into a devout Lutheran family. Albert Bormann (1902–89) was to become an arch-rival of his more famous elder brother, Martin (1900–1945). Both were early Party members, Martin being a great friend of Rudolf Hess and joining the Party in 1927, Albert shortly after. By October 1931, Albert had joined the Kanzlei des Führers (Hitler’s Chancellery, not a state institution, but Hitler’s personal office), responsible for the Nazi Party administration. In 1938, Albert became Chief of the Persönliche Angelegenheiten des Führers (Personal Affairs of the Führer) office, not under the jurisdiction of his brother, and handled much of Hitler’s routine correspondence. Martin meanwhile became personal secretary to Hess, and when in May 1941 Hess fled to Britain, Martin Bormann immediately succeeded him as head of the Party Chancellery, and built his power as a master of political intrigue. Both brothers worked in the Führerhauptquartier, but remained distant. Traudl Junge, Hitler’s last secretary, worked for Albert before moving on to Hitler. Albert is much less well known than his sibling because he consciously avoided the limelight, and seems to have been genuinely liked by most of Hitler’s inner circle. He remained in the Führerbunker in Berlin until ordered to fly out on 20 April 1945, hence he managed to survive, unlike Martin (despite numerous claims to the contrary), whose remains were found by construction workers in West Berlin in December 1972. Martin Bormann had been tried in absentia at Nuremberg in October 1946 and sentenced to death for his participation in crimes against humanity. This put an end to much speculation that Martin Bormann had somehow escaped in the confusion of the Russian capture of Berlin and reached South America. Albert Bormann, by contrast, was merely sentenced by a Munich de-nazification court to six months of hard labour and released in October 1949. Refusing to write his memoirs, Albert Bormann died in 1989.\n\n24. Transcript of 1973 Thames Television interview with Albert Speer, Reel 4, Imperial War Museum sound archive.\n\n25. Edwin P.

Hugo Gutmann (1880–1962) was a Nuremberger by birth and member of the German Jewish population which numbered about 500,000 in 1914, of whom 100,000 served in the Kaiser’s forces during the First World War and 12,000 lost their lives. (Anne Frank’s father and uncle were also officers in the WWI German army.) During the 1920s, Gutmann owned and ran an office furniture shop in Nuremberg, and during the Third Reich era was protected from arrest and continued to receive a war pension, as a result of the influence of both SS personnel who knew his history, anti-Nazi elements in the German Police, and probably Hitler himself. In 1939, Gutmann and his family escaped to Belgium, migrating to the USA the following year; he settled in the city of St Louis, Missouri, where he changed his name to Henry G. Grant and went back into the furniture trade, dying in 1962.\n\n5. Williams, Corporal Hitler and the Great War, op. cit., p. 191; Werner Maser, Hitler, (Allen Lane, 1973) op. cit., pp. 92–3.\n\n6.

The exchange is from a thinly veiled story called Der Augenzeuge (The Eyewitness), written in 1938 by the Czech novelist Ernst Weiss, to whom Forster passed the medical notes of Hitler’s remarkable case in the 1930s. In Weiss’s novel, the patient, known simply as A.H., was ‘a corporal of the Bavarian regiment, an orderly in the regimental staff’, who had been ‘gassed by a grenade’ fired by the English on his last patrol, and suffered symptoms so that his ‘eyes had burned like glowing coals’ and, ‘being emotionally disturbed’, had been sent to a special clinic, known simply as ‘P’. David Lewis’s book The Man Who Invented Hitler is a compelling thesis that this is the true story of what happened to Adolf Hitler in October–November 1918, and to my mind it rings true. The details surrounding the case were only revealed in 1943 to US agents by one of Edmund Forster’s fellow doctors, and the novel published without acclaim or notice in 1963, long after the deaths of Forster and Weiss. Forster’s life was in danger after revealing this knowledge, and he committed suicide as the Germans marched into Paris (where he was living in exile) in June 1940.\n\n11.

Churchill, The Gathering Storm (Cassell, 1948), p. 41.\n\n14. Churchill was fascinated by willpower and wrote about T. E. Lawrence (‘of Arabia’) in similar terms in his mini-biography of the latter in Great Contemporaries (Thornton Butterworth, 1937, revised 1939). Full of unrepentant admiration for this enigmatic figure, Churchill wrote ‘Solitary, austere, inexorable, he moved upon a plane apart from and above our common lot … he reigned over those with whom he came in contact. They felt themselves in the presence of an extraordinary being. They felt that his latent reserves of force and willpower were beyond measurement.’ He might have been a German writing about Hitler in the 1930s. Coming from Churchill, this underlines his understanding of the importance of willpower, whose admiration and exercise of it were very much hallmarks of his own long and distinguished life.

While Speer’s memoirs provide fascinating insights into the workings of the Third Reich, they are also problematic in relation to the Holocaust, about which he claimed he knew very little. In 1995, Gitta Sereny’s book Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth (Macmillan) challenged Speer’s version of events, claiming that his omissions and denials of knowledge were based on efforts to avoid execution at Nuremberg and that some of his later writings actually contradicted his court testimony. Sereny’s understanding of Speer as a crafty and intelligent witness who spent his remaining years trying to justify his actions both to himself and the public ring true. Thus his memoirs need to be read with a cautionary warning and may be only partly reliable.\n\n9. H. R. Trevor-Roper, Hitler’s Table Talk, 1941–1944 (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1953), p. 279.\n\n10.

These overall figures hide the fact that Panzer IV production declined from 334 in June 1944 to only 207 in December. Panther tank production never reached its expected peak of 600 units per month and declined from a high of 400 in July to 308 in December.\n\n13. Charles B. MacDonald, The Siegfried Line Campaign.

Heinz Günther Guderian (1914–2004) was Inspector of Panzer Troops in the Bundeswehr, the position his father had held in the Third Reich. He retained his position as Operations Officer of 116th Panzer Division from May 1942 until the end of the War. Retiring in 1974 – I met him when serving in Germany in 1980 – he wrote the divisional history of his unit, From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in WWII.\n\n16. ‘Balck has strong claims to be regarded as our finest field commander,’ wrote Major-General Friedrich-Wilhelm von Mellenthin. General Hermann Balck (1897–1982) came from a military family. His great-grandfather served in the King’s German Legion under the Duke of Wellington; his grandfather was an officer in the British Army’s Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. His father, William Balck, was a Generalleutnant in the German army and a Knight of the Order Pour le Mérite; Hermann Balck was nominated for the Pour le Mérite in October 1918, but the war ended before his citation could be processed. In the Second World War, he received the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds, ending in command of the Sixth Army. Sadly, his autobiography, Ordnung im Chaos: Erinnerungen, 1893–1948, has yet to appear in English. See David T. Zabecki, ‘The Greatest German General No One Ever Heard Of’, article in World War II magazine (April/May 2008).\n\n17. Georg Grossjohan, Five Years, Four Fronts (Aegis, 1999), pp. 202–203.\n\n18.

Churchill’s memoirs state that in his 20 January 1943 cable to the War Cabinet in London the matter was discussed: ‘We propose to draw up a statement of the work of the conference for communication to the Press at the proper time. I should be glad to know what the War Cabinet would think of our including in this statement a declaration of the firm intention of the United States and the British Empire to continue the war relentlessly until we have brought about the “unconditional surrender” of Germany and Japan. The omission of Italy would be to encourage a break-up there. The President liked this idea, and it would stimulate our friends in every country.’ The War Cabinet responded the same day, stating that they did not think Italy should be excluded. Churchill seems to have believed that the matter would be further discussed but both he and Roosevelt became very occupied while dealing with General de Gaulle. His memoirs continued, ‘It seems probable that as I did not like applying unconditional surrender to Italy I did not raise the point again with the President, and we had certainly both agreed to the communiqué we had settled with our advisers. There is no mention in it of “unconditional surrender”. It was submitted to the War Cabinet, who approved it in this form’ (pp. 614–15). So the matter had been under discussion but it had not been part of the joint communique that the two leaders agreed in advance.\n\n24.

Under SHAEF, Allied staff branches were organised as follows: G[eneral staff branch] 1 = Personnel matters; G-2 = Intelligence; G-3 = Planning and Operations; G-4 = Supply issues; G-5 = Civil Affairs; G-6 = Publicity and Psychological Warfare Division, which was later split into two, unnumbered staff divisions, Psychological Warfare and Public Relations. Each usually had a US head and British deputy or vice versa. The British system of General Staff appointments put operations, training and intelligence under the ‘G’[eneral Staff] branch, while personnel and supply were part of the ‘A’[djutant General’s] and ‘Q’[uartermaster General’s] staff. The German equivalents were I-a (chief of staff or chief G-3 operations); I-b (chief G-4 supply and movement); I-c (chief G-2 intelligence); I-d (chief G-3 training); II-a (G-1 personnel – officers); II-c (G-1 Personnel – other ranks).\n\n6.

The Sturmgeschütz (StuG) assault gun was Germany’s most common AFV of the Second World War. Built on the chassis of the Panzer III tank, but without a turret, it was initially intended as a mobile, armoured light gun for infantry support. Gradually the StuG was employed as a tank destroyer and eventually used to replace tanks in armoured formations. They weighed twenty-four tons, carried a crew of four and a 75mm gun; more than 11,500 were built, plus an additional 1,000 modelled on the Panzer IV chassis. Collectively, they destroyed more enemy tanks than panzers, and by 1944 Sturmgeschützunits claimed to have knocked out 20,000 tanks. They were far more cost-effective than tanks and, because of their low silhouette, StuGs were easy to camouflage and harder to hit than a conventional tank. However, their lack of a traversable turret gave them a severe disadvantage in an offensive, so they were better suited to defensive scenarios. The Hetzer (‘Baiter’), of which nearly 3,000 were manufactured, was smaller, built on to the Czech Pz 38(t) chassis, weighing in at fifteen tons, also carrying a crew of four with a 75mm gun. It was one of the most common of late-war German AFVs, and popular with crews on account of its mechanical reliability and the fact that its small size made it easy to hide. Many nations used StuGs and Hetzers for decades after the war, a tribute to their practicality and durability.\n\n22.

April 1945 found him promoted to Training Company commander, overseeing sixteen- and seventeen-year-old recruits, when he was captured.\n\n4. Josef ‘Sepp’ Dietrich, who was born in that decade of years (1885–95) that furnished most senior commanders of the Second World War – in his case, in 1892, making him fifty-two at the Battle of the Bulge. Born into the poorest of backgrounds, he volunteered in 1914 for the Bavarian artillery and served in some of the same battles as Hitler, who was a Bavarian infantryman. In February 1918 he was assigned to a tank unit, seeing action as gunner in a unit of captured British tanks, winning an Iron Cross and promotion to sergeant-major. A pre-war drifter, he returned home a decorated hero with an ability to lead and command, which was Hitler’s story too. Although he first came across his future Führer in 1921, it was not until 1928 that Dietrich actually joined the NSDAP (Party Member 89,015) and the Schutzstaffel. His SS number was 1,177 of an organisation that eventually numbered thirty-eight divisions and 950,000 men, and had been founded in 1921 as bruisers and brawlers to protect Hitler’s person at his first political meetings.\n\nHitler immediately took to his chief bodyguard, whom he considered rough but straight as a die, with a proven war record and sense of humour that cheered even the darkest moments of the nascent Nazi Party. On Hitler’s election as Chancellor in January 1933, Dietrich was tasked to create the SS Watch-Battalion-Berlin (Stabswache Berlin), a display unit to guard the Reich Chancellery, which later became the SS-Leibstandarte (Life Guard) Adolf Hitler, with a strength of nearly 1,000. Dietrich’s lack of education showed when he took the Leibstandarte to Poland in September 1939 – then a brigadier, Dietrich’s prior military experience was as an NCO, twenty-one years earlier. Fortunately, his 1a (chief of staff) was an ex-regular army colonel and Kriegsakademie graduate, Willi Bittrich, who provided the brains, while Dietrich rose to the role of leader. The regiment was one of the few fully motorised units in the German army and participated in the campaigns against Poland and France, where it performed adequately, rather than brilliantly.\n\nBy the end of 1940, the Waffen-SS (or fighting-SS) was confirmed as a regular unit of the German military, with Dietrich at its head in the rank of General der Waffen-SS. The Leibstandarte was further expanded and in April–May 1941 invaded Yugoslavia and Greece, where it shone in combat. In 1941, Dietrich’s regiment was expanded into a division of 13,000 officers and men and arrived in Russia. During the 1941–2 winter campaign Dietrich himself suffered severe frostbite, indicating that he was not tucked up safe and warm in his HQ, and won admiration for getting to know many of the men under his command by name. Hitler personally followed Dietrich’s achievements in Russia on his situation map, the Leibstandarte’s movements indicated by a flag annotated ‘Sepp’. In 1942 Dietrich’s command was again in Russia with some of the first Tiger tanks, and a divisional strength of 21,000 – significantly more than army divisions and surely a mark of favouritism. Hitler awarded him Diamonds to his Knight’s Cross for his outstanding leadership in Normandy and promoted him to Oberstgrüppenführer, a rank below Himmler, assessing him as ‘unique … a man who is simultaneously cunning, energetic and brutal. Under his swashbuckling appearance, Dietrich is a serious, conscientious, scrupulous character. And what care he takes of his troops!’ As a reaction to 20 July, and in what was widely interpreted throughout Germany as a reward for the wider loyalty of the Waffen-SS, Hitler entrusted him with the Sixth Panzer Army. On hearing this, the ever-loyal Krämer, knowing his old boss would need help in his new assignment, resigned his own command of the 12th SS-Hitlerjugend Division to accompany ‘Sepp’ into battle yet again as his chief of staff.\n\n5. Close to Rommel, Dietrich had just waved the latter off from his own HQ on 17 July 1944 when Rommel’s staff car was attacked by Allied fighters in Normandy. Rommel’s alleged parting words to Dietrich were, ‘Something has to happen! The war in the West has to be ended!’ To which Dietrich was supposed to have responded, ‘You, Herr Generalfeldmarschall, are my commander-in-chief, and I shall obey only you, whatever the order!’ This is frequently interpreted as Rommel sounding out Dietrich’s likely response to a change of leadership (i.e. Hitler’s assassination, which was attempted on 20 July). Dietrich’s ambivalence reflected his growing (and widely known) disillusionment with Hitler’s command style, and a refusal to countenance retreat from Normandy – if true, an abrupt change of heart for Hitler’s loyal henchman of sixteen years.\n\n6. Dietrich surrendered to Patton’s men on 8 May 1945. After the war, he was found guilty of complicity in the massacre of American soldiers near Malmedy, though his responsibility for the deed was never proven. Sentenced to life for contradicting ‘the customs and ethics of war’, several anti-Nazi former colleagues, among them Guderian and Speidel, testified on his behalf and the sentence was commuted to twenty-five years. Released in October 1955, he was later sentenced by a German court for murder during the June 1934 massacre of the SA leadership. He enjoyed seven years of liberty before dying of a heart attack in April 1966, aged seventy-tree – an unlikely end for a soldier who, at several moments, should have met death on the battlefield. Despite a bloody reputation, his biographer Charles Messenger argues convincingly that Dietrich was not an ideologically committed Nazi, just a rather good leader of men, who was never afraid to roll up his sleeves and muck in. In his last years he helped found the Hilfsorganisation auf Gegenseitigkeit der Waffen SS (Waffen-SS Self Help Organisation) or HIAG, which lobbied successfully for Waffen-SS soldiers to be paid a war pension like their Wehrmacht colleagues. At what was probably the last big gathering of the Waffen-SS, 7,000 wartime comrades, as well as former adversaries, came to his funeral, where Wilhelm Bittrich, his first chief of staff, gave the address.\n\n7.

Illustrative of the morale-boosting information about the war contained in US newspapers (but forbidden in the United Kingdom), on 23 March 1945, the Le Mars [Plymouth County, Iowa] Semi-Weekly Sentinel repeated a US Fourth Division Order of the Day, which read, ‘Over four months ago after advancing through the Ardennes, the Fourth Infantry Division broke through the Siegfried Line and occupied the Schnee Eifel. Relieved by another division, the Fourth moved north and attacked through the Huertgen Forest, moved south again and successfully defended the city of Luxembourg against the German counter-offensive in December, attacked across the Sure and Our Rivers and advanced against continuous opposition until it was again opposite the Schnee Eifel. In spite of almost incredible weather conditions and the long period of continuous contact with the enemy, the division then recaptured the Siegfried Line defenses on the Schnee Eifel and captured the fortified town of Brandscheid which had heretofore successfully withstood all attacks made against it. The 70th Tank Battalion contributed aggressive and invaluable support throughout this entire operation.’ The Le Mars Sentinel went on to report, ‘The 70th Tank Battalion is commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Henry E. Davidson Jr, of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. Company ‘A’, which supports the 8th Infantry, is led by Captain Gordon A. Brodie of Le Mars. Capt. Francis E. Songer commands Company ‘B’ in support of the 12th Infantry, and First Lieutenant Preston E. Yoeman of Crystal Lake, Illinois, commands Company ‘C’ in support of the 22nd Infantry.

Reporting for duty six weeks later, Slovik informed his company commander that he was ‘too scared’ to serve in a rifle company and asked to be reassigned to a rear area unit, adding he would run away if he were assigned to a rifle unit. As the 109th had been hard hit in Normandy and were heading for the Hürtgen and needed every spare man, he was sent to a rifle platoon. Slovik wrote a series of notes to his superiors, stating his intention to run away if sent into combat, and refused to withdraw them. Slovik was buried in the Oise-Aisne American Cemetery, alongside ninety-six other American soldiers executed for crimes such as murder and rape, an unhappy reminder of another problem the US Army was experiencing as well as fighting the Germans.\n\n3.
