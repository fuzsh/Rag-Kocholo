Some characters are known to millions of people, such as Anna Karenina or Lara Croft, Ulysses or James Bond, Mickey Mouse or R2-D2. The aim of this volume is to present a survey of the varieties of international and interdisciplinary research on characters in fictional worlds in different media. That such a survey does not exist to date is perhaps due to the gaps between the disciplines, but perhaps also to the apparent normality and ubiquity of characters: We encounter them every day, and they are so familiar a phenomenon that they do not seem to require closer inspection. Yet another reason could be that once they are subject to closer scrutiny, characters prove to be highly complex objects in a number of ways. They remind one of real persons, but at the same time they seem to consist of mediated signs only. They are ›there‹ but they do not appear to exist in reality – we do not meet them on the streets, after all. They do exert an influence on us, but we cannot interact with them directly. They are incredibly versatile, they change over time and appear in different forms in different media. The introduction to Ronald B. DeWaal’s Sherlock Holmes bibliography gives an impression of this: This bibliography is a comprehensive record of the appearances in books, periodicals and newspapers of the Sacred Writings or Canonical tales (fifty-six short stories and four novels), the Apocrypha and the manuscripts written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle between 1886 and 1927, together with the translations of these tales into sixty-three languages, plus Braille and shorthand, the writings about the Writings or higher criticism, writings about Sherlockians and their societies, memorials and memorabilia, games, puzzles and quizzes, phonograph records, audio and video tapes, compact discs, laser discs, ballets, films, musicals, operettas, oratorios, plays, radio and television programs, parodies and pastiches, children’s books, cartoons, comics, and a multitude\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\n4\n\nof other items – from advertisements to wine – that have accumulated throughout the world on the two most famous characters in literature.1\n\nTerminology already posits a problem for a general or comparative approach that wants to examine (maybe even equally ›famous‹) characters across those media: We have to subsume readers, hearers, viewers, users, and players under the heading of ›recipients‹, and books, paintings, radio plays, films, video games, etc. under the heading of ›texts‹.2 (Coming from literature and moving image studies, the authors of this introduction are aware of their limited disciplinary perspectives in trying to give a general survey of the field.) Moreover, in any media, characters confront those who are concerned with them – creators, audiences, critics and commentators – with numerous questions. These questions can be clustered into three groups concerning the analysis and interpretation of characters. 1. In the production phase of a media product, authors, filmmakers and other media producers are mainly confronted with the question of how characters can be crafted in a way that allows them to evoke certain thoughts, feelings and lasting effects in the target audience. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had to invent Holmes in the first place, screenwriters had to adapt him, casting agents had to cast an actor for the role, etc. 2. The interpretation of a work of fiction confronts critics and scholars with the question of how characters can be understood, interpreted and experienced, and by which stylistic devices they are shaped. 3. Studies in the fields of cultural theory and sociology consider characters as signs of empirical production and reception processes embedded in their socio-cultural contexts in different historical periods and (sub-)cultures. The master sleuth Holmes, for instance, has been read in connection with the socio-cultural developments of a modern, industrialised society. Each of these three fields of inquiry – production, interpretation and cultural analysis – has prompted scholars to find answers and develop _____________ 1 2\n\nDe Waal: Holmes (Jul. 21st, 2008). When we use the term ›text‹ in this introduction, we include literature, everyday language, film – and, indeed, all other utterances in which characters may occur. Following Mosbach: Bildermenschen – Menschenbilder, p. 73, we might define text to mean ›complex, coherent utterances based on signs, which are contained in a media format, and, in their totality, communicative and culturally coded‹ (German original: ›komplexe, aber formal begrenzte, kohärente und [als Ganze] kommunikative, kulturell kodierte Zeichenäußerungen‹; on film as text, see montage/av: Film als Text, and Hickethier: Film- und Fernsehanalyse, pp. 23–25.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n5\n\ntheories. For the first two thousand years of the debate, the first set of questions was tackled mainly by practitioners – dramatists and directors, artists and media producers – with a view to practical concerns. It was only in the 19th century that a more theoretical, descriptive and systematic analysis of characters was developed in various disciplines of scholarship, such as literary studies, theatre studies, and later in film and media studies, communication studies, the history of art, philosophy and psychology. Each of these disciplines has produced diverse rival theories on which we can only cast a passing glance in this introduction (for a more detailed survey of the research, see the contribution by Henriette Heidbrink in this volume). Simplifying matters for the purposes of clarity, we can point to four dominant paradigms that reach across disciplines but have different tenets, emphases and methods. 1. Hermeneutic approaches view characters dominantly as representations of human beings and emphasise the necessity of taking into consideration the specific historical and cultural background of the characters and their creators. 2. Psychoanalytic approaches concentrate on the psyche of both characters and recipients. They aim at explaining the inner life of characters, as well as the reactions of viewers, users, and readers with the help of psycho-dynamic models of personality (e.g., those developed by Freud and Lacan). 3. Structuralist and semiotic approaches in contrast highlight the very difference between characters and human beings, focussing on the construction of characters and the role of the (linguistic, visual, auditive or audio-visual) text. They frequently regard characters themselves as sets of signifiers and textual structures. 4. Cognitive theories, which have been established since the 1980s, centre on modelling in detail the cognitive and affective operations of information processing. In these approaches, characters are regarded as text-based constructs of the human mind, whose analysis requires both models of understanding text and models of the human psyche. The rivalry between these approaches in various disciplines and regions has contributed to the fragmentation of character theory and the coexistence of viewpoints. The interdisciplinary and international survey we envisage with this volume may help to remedy the situation. Most contributors to this book have done extensive research in the field, and are thus able to present their own established approaches and theoretical results. We are hoping that this will facilitate a dialogue between different positions. The essays are roughly clustered into five groups: (1) general topics (the research on characters, their ontology, and their relation to\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\n6\n\nnarrative plots); (2) characters and characterisation in different media (prose fiction, drama, poetry, feature films, pop clips, comics, the internet);3 (3) recipients’ cognitive and affective responses to characters (from understanding to empathy and aesthetic evaluation); (4) relations of characters to identity and culture (stereotyping, gender); and finally, (5) characters that cross the borders of single texts or media. Clearly, this clustering is far from being comprehensive. It is only giving a first orientation and is not supposed to draw rigid lines. Many essays deal with several topics and could have been located in a different group as well. This introduction is intended to help to situate the contributions in a more general context. We hope that our footnotes and references serve as links for the readers, pointing to essays that deal in more detail with topics we can only briefly mention here. Keeping our considerations on a rather abstract level and leaving out extensive examples and historical case studies, we start with some fundamentals: the definition and ontology of characters, their relations to real people and to the media they are represented in. We then turn to action and character constellations as two important contexts of individual characters in fictional worlds. On that basis, we examine somewhat more specifically how characters are reidentified and characterised in different media. From a more global perspective, characters can then be associated with recurring types and media genres, as well as with certain functions they fulfill and meanings they convey. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts on how recipients respond to characters and what kinds of lasting effects characters may have. 2 Definition and Ontology of Character How we define character is relevant not only with regard to theoretical questions, but also in quite practical terms, for the definition influences how we analyse characters: If we regard Sherlock Holmes as a person-like being, we are likely to focus on his personality traits; if we see him as a sign, we will concentrate on the textual structures of his presentation; if we think of him as a mental construct, the psychological processes of his recipients will move centre stage, and so on. Each of these approaches, and some others, have been explicated in detail, and we can only gesture _____________ 3\n\nUnfortunately, we did not succeed in including further important art forms and media like painting or TV.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n7\n\ntowards them here.4 Little explanation can be found in the etymology of the term, and the languages differ to boot. The English term ›character‹ goes back to Greek charaktér, ›a stamping tool‹, meaning, in a figural sense, the stamp of personality, that which is unique to a human being.5 The French and Italian terms – personnage and personaggio, respectively – point to Latin persona, i.e. the mask through which the sound of the voice of an actor is heard. The German Figur in turn has its roots in the Latin figura, and suggests a form that contrasts with a background. In spite of the differences, in all of these languages characters are most frequently defined as fictive persons6 or fictional analoga to human beings.7 Such definitions are in accordance with the intuition that we resort to knowledge about real people when we try to understand fictional characters. Definitions of this type, however, are not entirely unproblematic: they are too vague as far as the ontological status of fictive beings is concerned, they are restricted to anthropomorphous characters and exclude, e.g., animal characters, aliens, monsters and robots. This raises two questions. First, there is the basic question of the ontology of characters: What kind of object are they? Second, there is the question of their specificity: What is the difference between them and other objects of the same kind? The ontology of characters has been discussed most widely in philosophy and in literary scholarship.8 One position, according to which characters are regarded as component parts of fictional worlds, has been particularly prominent in this context. Fictional worlds are in turn explained in the scholarly discourses of fictional worlds theories and the philosophical possible worlds theories.9 Within this framework, a fictional world is conceived of as a system of non-real but possible states, or as a constellation, created by the text, of objects, individuals, space, time, _____________ 4 5 6 7 8\n\n9\n\nFor more detailed discussions of the definition and ontology of characters, see Eder: Fiktionstheorie; Jannidis: Figur, chap. 5 and 6; as well as the references in the subsequent footnotes. See the entry in the Oxford English Dictionary. E.g. Wilpert: Figur, p. 298. E.g. Smith: Characters, p. 17. For introductions to the debate in the discourse of philosophy, see Proudfoot: Fictional Entities; Howell: Fiction; Lamarque: Fictional Entities. The discussion in literary theory can be found in Rimmon-Kenan: Narrative Fiction, pp. 31–34, Margolin: Individuals and Margolin: Characters.

What is more, the scholarly discourse on characters is much older and more varied than that on fictional worlds. Therefore, it makes sense to start from the perspective of character proper. There are four major positions on the ontological status of characters, and they are highly controversial: 1. Semiotic theories consider characters to be signs or structures of fictional texts.12 2. Cognitive approaches assume that characters are representations of imaginary beings in the minds of the audience.13 3. Some philosophers believe that characters are abstract objects beyond material reality.14 4. Other philosophers contend that characters do not exist at all.15 As we mentioned above, each of these positions has its own far-reaching implications for the analysis of characters. Each definition thus entails a particular perspective and a particular method. This is not the place to deal with the pros and cons of the various positions in detail, not least because the authors of this introduction are not unanimous in their theoretical stance: Ralf Schneider conceives of _____________ 10 See, e.g., Doležel: Heterocosmica,pp. 16–23; Ryan: Narrative, p. 91. 11 For a survey of philosophical positions on the ontology of possible worlds, see Melia: Possible Worlds. 12 Branigan: Point of View, p. 12 (›surface feature of discourse‹); Wulff: Charakter, p. 1 [French ed.: 32]; see also Jannidis’ criticism of (post-) structuralist varieties of this position (Figur, chap. 5). 13 For psychological approaches in literary theory, see Grabes: Personen; Schneider: Grundriß; Culpeper: Characterization; Gerrig / Allbritton: Construction, and the cricitism in Jannidis: Figur, pp. 177–184. No comparably detailed version of this theory has been put forward in the area of film studies, but it is implied in many approaches, such as Bordwell: Cognition; Ohler: Filmpsychologie; Grodal: Film Genres, or Persson: Understanding Cinema. 14 See Thomasson: Fictional Characters, and Reicher: Metaphysik; see also Howell: Fiction, and Lamarque: Fictional Entities. 15 Künne: Abstrakte Gegenstände, pp. 291–322; Currie: Characters; see also Proudfoot: Fictional Entities; Howell: Fiction; Lamarque: Fictional Entities.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n9\n\ncharacters as mental constructs, as in position 2 above, whereas Fotis Jannidis and Jens Eder stand for different versions of position 3, maintaining that characters are abstract objects; another variety of this thesis can be found in Maria Reicher’s contribution to this volume.16 Despite such differences, we share a number of convictions. The philosophic-semantic view that characters do not exist is jeopardised by the fact that it requires extremely complicated logical re-formulations of quite straightforward utterances about characters: every sentence about a character would have to be translated into a sentence about the text – we would not be talking about Sherlock Holmes at all, but about the books and films in which he appears. Some hold the view that characters are signs, mere words or a paradigm of traits described by words. A wellknown example of this approach is Roland Barthes’s S/Z (1970) in which one of the codes, ›voices‹, substitutes for person, understood as the web of semes attached to a proper name. In this view, a character is not to be taken for anything like a person, yet on closer examination these semes correspond to traditional character traits. Moreover, the reduction of characters to words poses many practical problems in literary and media criticism. In addition to that, every aspect of meaning of the term ›sign‹ leads to counterintuitive consequences when applied to characters: characters simply cannot be reduced to signifiants or signifiés or relations between them, because each of these aspects would imply that one character is always restricted to the one text to which it belongs, as part of the overall set of signs. It is, however, a well-known fact that characters can appear in a number of texts, as the example of Holmes and Watson clearly shows. Given this situation, the series of essays by Uri Margolin, by combining elements of structuralism, reception theory and the theory of fictional worlds, proved to be a breakthrough. For Margolin, characters are first and foremost elements of the constructed narrative world: ›character‹, he claims, ›is a general semiotic element, independent of any particular verbal expression and ontologically different from it‹.17 If, in a similar vein, we consider characters to be elements of fictional worlds, which exist either as subjective mental entities or as inter-subjective communicative constructs, the question is what differentiates them from the other elements of the text. To what extent is Sherlock Holmes different from his pipe, the Thames or a lifelike Sherlock Holmes wax figure? This _____________ 16 See Schneider: Grundriß and Literary Character; Jannidis: Figur, chap. 5; Eder: Fiktionstheorie; Reicher (in this volume). 17 Margolin: Characterisation, p. 7.\n\n10\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\nquestion has been addressed by referring to some closely connected criteria that a character fulfills, including being animate, having an intentional mind (in the phenomenological sense), being able to act, being humanlike and having person status.18 Some of these criteria, however, prove to be too broad or too narrow: the criterion of being animate would on the one hand include the earthworm in the possession of an angler that Holmes identifies as a clue as a character; on the other hand, it would exclude inanimate characters, such as robots. Anthropomorphism and person status would exclude many well-known characters such as Lassie or the extraterrestrial plant Audrey II (The Little Shop of Horrors). In contrast to these criteria, the ability to act and to have an inner life (of whatever quality) appear to be more plausible. In addition to that, an element of the text is more likely to be regarded as a character if it is a particular, recognisable entity, not an indistinct part of a mass (of beings). At the prototypical core of the concept of character, then, is a recognisable fictional being, to which the ability to think and act is ascribed. Individual characters can deviate from this prototype in a variety of ways and to various degrees. Models in advertisements, for instance, can be hard to identify (criterion of recognisability); a character can be a reference to historical persons, such as Napoleon in historical novels and feature films (criterion of fictionality); some cannot use their bodies to act, such as the invalid Johnny in Johnny Got His Gun (criterion of being able to act); others are even dead from the beginning of the story, such as Harry in Hitchcock’s The Trouble with Harry (criterion of being animate). In addition to that, Uri Margolin has pointed out that not all characters exist within the main level of the fictional world at all. He reminds us that characters can have various modes of existence: they can be factual, counterfactual, hypothetical, conditional, or purely subjective.19 At the end of the mind game movie Fight Club, for instance, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) turns out to be the hallucinated alter ego of the nameless narrator-protagonist (Edward Norton), who suffers from a split personality syndrome. Cases like this highlight the relevance of some further questions: What is the relationship between characters and real persons?\n\n_____________ 18 Eder: Fiktionstheorie, pp. 55–59. 19 Margolin: Characters, p. 375.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n11\n\n3 Characters and People If we conceive of characters as beings in fictional worlds, to which the audience ascribes intentionality or action, we must ask what precisely the difference between characters and real persons is. The differences concern especially the textual construction and fictional representation of characters, their ontological incompleteness, and, in connection with that, the difference between the audience’s knowledge about characters on the one hand and about persons on the other.20 Obviously, the reception of characters is quite different from the direct encounter with real persons: Readers, listeners, or viewers focus on media texts, activate media knowledge and communication rules, they cannot interact with the represented persons but can think about their meaning, as well as about causes and effects, and they can shift their attention from the level of what is represented (Sherlock Holmes) to the level of presentation (the words of the book, the actor’s performance). The symbolism and the communicative mediation of characters mark fundamental differences to the observation of persons in reality. In addition to that, the texts that construct characters are fictional. Real persons can of course also be represented in (non-fictional) texts, such as biographies or the news, but they do not owe their existence to these texts. This consideration is connected with the ontological incompleteness of characters. Objects in the real world have certain properties. If such objects are mentioned in a non-fictional text, all persons involved in the communication process will assume that even those properties of the object which the text does not name and specify explicitly are still accessible in principle. This is even true in circumstances where there is a lack of sources, so that the evidence cannot be provided. If, for instance, the colour of Napoleon’s hair had not been mentioned in any of the contemporary texts about him, we would still assume that his hair was of a certain colour, and that this colour could still be found out, through the discovery of hitherto unknown sources, an exhumation, etc. The situation appears to be entirely different in the case of characters in fictional worlds. If the medium that constitutes them provides no information on a certain property, this property is simply lacking in the fictional world – there is a gap, as it were, in that world. The recipient has _____________ 20 The term ›knowledge‹ is used in a wide sense here, including also erroneous beliefs, pre-conscious dispositions, procedural or implicit knowledge, kinds of embodied cognition, etc. The incompleteness of fictional characters has been discussed extensively in analytical philosophy; see Eaton: Character; Crittenden: Fictional Characters; Lamarque: How to Create.\n\n12\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\nno opportunity to fill this gap in a way that would allow him to consider it an item of reliable knowledge. We simply cannot know how many children Lady Macbeth had, or if Sherlock Holmes has a birthmark on his back – to mention two cases in point which have been discussed extensively. There is, of course, nothing that would stop the recipient from contributing such pieces of knowledge, and each individual reading, viewing, etc. is likely to differ from all other readings with regard to the unmentioned details the recipient imagines in the process, but on the level of the fictional universe the text creates, the information will remain unavailable. Things get more complicated because the above formulation that ›the medium which constitutes a character provides information‹ is admittedly vague. In the most straightforward case, the colour of a character’s hair is simply mentioned explicitly (in the language-based media genres) or shown (in the visual media genres). The case is less clear if a text presents this piece of information implicitly rather than explicitly (see below for a further discussion of this distinction). A character may, for instance, be presented as a typical Frisian, or a typical Italian from the south of Italy – in both cases, information on the colour of the hair is implied. The question here is to what extent the perception of persons feeds into – or ought to feed into – the perception of characters. As has become clear, knowledge that comes from outside the text plays a crucial role in many cases when a character’s behaviour is to be understood adequately. Therefore, if we want to understand the text, film, etc. in its historical context, we need to find out about the psychological and anthropological knowledge that was available to the author and her or his contemporaries. This process, however, is quite different from the way we approach persons, for in a historically adequate interpretation it only makes sense to fill in information that would have been available in the context of the text’s original production and reception. If we read, for instance, a historical report about the symptoms of an unknown disease, we may of course say that according to today’s knowledge, it is likely that this or that particular disease is meant; in the case of a fictional text, this procedure would be anachronistic and meaningless: If the disease is unknown in the fictional world and its context, the lack of information cannot be remedied. Whether or not one wants to admit such potentially anachronistic readings depends to some degree on the theoretical background one chooses: On the one hand, it has been an established practice, e.g. in psychoanalytical interpretations, to find prove of the symptoms described by psychoanalysis in texts that precede the development of the discipline itself by a few hundred years (consider, for instance, Freud’s famous analysis of the Oedipus myth in Shakespeare’s Hamlet); on the other hand,\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n13\n\nin the context of Foucault’s discourse theory it makes sense to regard the moment in which a phenomenon – say, an illness – is first described as the one in which the discourse brings forth the phenomenon in social reality, so that an a posteriori interpretation of a phenomenon of a previous epoch raises a number of epistemological and ideological questions. What is more, we not only make use of our knowledge about persons in understanding characters, but also our knowledge about character types, genres and the protagonists they typically feature, and the rules of specific fictional worlds: The utterance ›I want to see the sun‹ can be understood adequately in rather different ways, depending on whether it comes from a human being or a vampire. Does this mean that characters are indefinitely changeable concepts which can only be understood in the context of particular contemporary knowledge about persons and characters? The answer is that in principle they are, but in spite of all this flexibility there seems to be a core set of properties, a common denominator that all presentations of characters share. This prototypical core or ›base type‹ – or basic structure of mental character models – is constituted by only very few and rather general properties, which seem to be anthropological givens of the perception of human (and humanlike) beings: In contrast to objects, characters have mental states, such as perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and aims. Accordingly, characters have both an outer appearance and an inner state of the psyche that is not visible from the outside. This definition of the base type is supported by recent research on person perception in early childhood.21 Assumptions about stable features or traits appear to be essential for most characters, too, so that it makes sense to include this aspect in the definition of the basic type as well. Other approaches also include the sociality of characters as a fundamental component beside corporeality and inner states.22 The relationship between a character and its environment may presuppose body and mind, but further particular qualities emerge from social interaction, e.g., social roles. In all three areas of the general structure of characters – corporeality, psyche, and sociality – the features that characters are ascribed can be either stable (static) or changeable (dynamic). Even if this base type may be the same across cultures, it can only provide a very general framework. How this frame is filled will depend to a major extent, and perhaps entirely, on the respective cultural context, _____________ 21 On the base type, see Jannidis: Figur, pp. 185–195, with further references to the relevant research; cf. also Tomasello et al.: Understanding. 22 Eder: Figur, pp. 173–185.\n\n14\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\nwhich is subject to historical change. The constitution of characters from textual information and cultural knowledge is based on character schemata. This concept refers to expectations of regular connections that exist between two or more pieces of information. Such expectations direct the inferences of the audience: If one piece of information is given in the text, the schema allows the reader or viewer to fill in the second bit. Such schemata include such everyday items of knowledge as the fact that the consumption of alcohol will lead to intoxication. The sources of such processes of inferencing consist of, on the one hand, knowledge about the actual world, especially the social world.23 On the other hand, there is media knowledge and narrative knowledge about fictional worlds in general, and about the rules of the narrated world in particular.24 Social knowledge includes person schemata; images of human nature; social categories; prototypes and stereotypes; knowledge of patterns of social interaction; groups and roles; folk psychology and sociology; the dynamics of social cognition; attribution and the interpretation of behaviour (e.g., the so-called fundamental attribution error); the knowledge of prototypical persons and last, but not least, the self-image of the reader/viewer/user. Media knowledge, on the other hand, includes an awareness of a text’s communication processes and fictionality; an awareness that is guided by the rules and aims of communication as well as media-specific knowledge of genres, modes of narrative, character types, dramaturgical functions, aesthetic conventions, star images, contexts of production, intertextual references, and individual popular characters (e.g., Sherlock Holmes as a pattern of later detectives). The entirety of the character schemata formulated by, or implied in, a text, constitutes its ›text-internal anthropology‹.25 Of central importance in this context are traditional configurations such as the book-keeper, the melancholic, the extrovert, the beau, the vamp, etc. Such character types can emerge from a variety of sources: the knowledge of the specific kind of narrated world, the knowledge about fictional worlds in general, and _____________ 23 On accounts of social perception or social cognition, see for instance Zebrowitz: Social Perception; Lavine / Borgida / Rudman: Social Cognition. 24 On the interaction between different kinds of social and media knowledge, see Ohler: Filmpsychologie; Eder: Figur, pp. 162–248. 25 Titzmann: Psychoanalytisches Wissen, p. 184. Titzmann correctly points out that terms like ›psychology‹ and ›anthropology‹ ought not to be taken literally, because neither should we project the concepts formulated by the specialist disciplines back onto the text and its context, nor should we overestimate the coherence of such bits of knowledge.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n15\n\nthe knowledge about the actual world, including the habitus of social groups. We will say more on such character types below. In view of the abundance of knowledge about people and characters in every society, it seems unlikely that there should still be gaps left in the fictional world. Even information missing from the text could be filled in from these knowledge stores. We should not forget, however, that fictional worlds are not autonomous worlds; rather, they emerge from processes of communication with their own particular rhetorical structure. Some aspects of the presentation of characters may be part of aesthetic structures that reach beyond the characters. Most importantly, characters themselves can be signs in a number of ways: they can be instances of exemplary behaviour, they can be symbols or in other ways representative of feelings, attitudes, problems and the like. In addition to that, characters are an important part of the emotional structure of literary texts, films, etc. They influence the feelings, moods and emotions of the audience to a considerable degree (see the remarks on ›Functions and Effects of Characters‹ in this introduction). In accordance with the complexity of the rhetorical structures, the reader or viewer may of course consider the number of Lady Macbeth’s children. Many of the questions of this kind, however, will look irrelevant, for the aesthetic structure sketched here will determine the quality and quantity of the import of contemporary knowledge. The differences between characters and real persons come to the fore if we systematically consider the ways we understand and talk about them. Theories of reception stress the fact that we understand characters on several levels:26 Viewers, readers, listeners or users do not only grasp a character’s corporeality, mind, and sociality in the (fictional) world. They are building on those processes to understand the character’s meanings as sign or symbol, and to reflect on the character’s connections to its creators, textual structures, ludic functions, etc. The latter processes diverge from the social perception of real persons, and it would be unusual (to say the least) to think about human beings in those ways. Moreover, and in accordance with the different levels of reception, the readers’ or viewers’ meta-fictional discourse about characters (e.g., talking about them after leaving the cinema) contains sentences of different logico-semantical structure:27 While the statement ›Holmes is a detective‹ stays safely in the boundaries of the fictional world and might also be _____________ 26 E.g., Persson: Understanding Cinema. 27 Künne: Abstrakte Gegenstände, pp. 295–296, and Currie: Characters, are proposing different logical transcriptions of such sentences.\n\n16\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\nuttered by another character, sentences like ›Holmes stands for human reason‹, ›Holmes was invented by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle‹, or ›Holmes is more perceptive than any other fictional or real detectives‹ transcend the fictional world in different ways, connecting it with reality. But again, we usually do not talk about real persons in those ways. Several theories have given accounts of that. Phelan has proposed the description of characters as participating in a mimetic sphere (due to the character’s traits), a thematic sphere (as a representative of an idea or of a class of people), and a synthetic sphere (the material out of which the character is made).28 In a similar way, but starting from a triangulation of several theories, Eder distinguishes between analysing characters (a) as artifacts (how are they represented, and what are their textual structures?); (b) as fictional beings (what features do they possess in the fictional world?); (c) as symbols (what do they stand for?); and (d) as symptoms (why are they the way they are, and what are their effects?).29 According to that distinction, we perceive real persons as inhabitants of a world (the actual one), but we do not perceive them as artifacts, symbols or symptoms. This also indicates a crucial difference between emotional reactions to characters and to real humans: We not only emotionally react to characters as fictional beings, but also react to their (brilliant or clumsy) representation, to the (often controversial) meanings they impart, to the intentions of their makers (e.g., propagandistic ones), or to the supposed effects they may have (e.g., on minors). Those kinds of reactions in turn may influence the feelings we have for the fictional being (see the section on ›Recipients’ Reactions and Relations to Characters‹ in this volume).30 Distinguishing between different aspects of analysing characters might also be helpful in understanding their media specificity, intertextuality, and transmediality. It seems plausible that characters which are represented in different media (like Holmes) may – or even have to – retain their core properties as fictional beings and symbols (e.g., in many film adaptations, Holmes is still a detective standing for human reason), while their metafictional properties as artifacts and symptoms usually change (in film, for instance, Holmes is represented by images of actors). The next section elaborates on such questions. _____________ 28 Phelan: Reading. 29 Eder: Figur. 30 For a reformulation and elaboration of this model in terms of semantics and pragmatics see Uri Margolin’s contribution to this volume. Margolin has been one of the first to argue for considering characters’ different aspects as non-actual individuals in fictional worlds, as thematic elements, as topical entities of discourse, and as artificial constructs.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n17\n\n4 Trans-medial and Media Specific Aspects of Character The section on defining character (above) has shown that characters are entities in fictional worlds which are brought forth through signs, but are not identical with those signs. Most characters in modern societies are not created in face-to-face narrations, but with the help of media, such as books, comics, theatre, film, TV, the radio, or computer games. The way they are created is therefore subject to the conditions of the respective media – an aspect systematically dealt with in a forthcoming anthology by Rainer Leschke and Henriette Heidbrink.31 Some aspects of characters and their presentation are the same across the media, while others are media specific. In what follows, we will first deal with the media specific aspects and then turn to the trans-medial ones. If we want to understand the relationship between characters and the media, we need to define the contested term ›media‹ first. Following Siegfried J. Schmidt, ›medium‹ can be seen as a compound term which comprises four components: (1) instruments of semiotic communication, such as natural languages and images; (2) media technologies used by the producer and the recipient, such as print or television technology; (3) the institutionalisation of the media-technological dispositives, for instance by publishing houses, TV stations, cinemas, etc; and (4) the individual media products, such as books, newspapers or TV spots.32 Schmidt refers to the systemic constellation of these factors as a ›medium‹, while other authors apply the term to the individual components. In any case, the function of media is to transmit, with the help of signs, certain experiences of a perceptual, cognitive, emotional and bodily kind.33 Schmidt’s definition of the term ›media‹ points to fundamental factors that contribute to the media specific forms of the production and reception of characters: media sign systems, technologies and institutions. The options for the production of character implied in this can be further differentiated with the help of Marie-Laure Ryan’s narratological categories, which can be applied to characters in different media.34 First, _____________ 31 Heidbrink / Leschke: Formen. 32 The original quotation reads: »(1) semiotische Kommunikationsinstrumente [z.B. natürliche Sprachen oder Bilder], (2) die jeweilige Medientechnologie auf Produzentenwie auf Rezipientenseite [z.B. Druck- oder Fernsehtechnologien], (3) die sozialsystemische Institutionalisierung der medientechnischen Dispositive [etwa durch Verlage, Fernsehsender, Kinos etc.] sowie (4) die jeweiligen Medienangebote wie z.B. Bücher, Zeitschriften oder Fernsehspots« Schmidt: Medienkulturwissenschaft, pp. 351–369. 33 Cf. also Vogel: Medien, p. 292. 34 Ryan: Media, pp. 282–292.\n\n18\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\nthe media can be differentiated according to their spatio-temporal extension: the radio play creates characters in a specified time slot, but without positing a particular space; photo-novellas in contrast are spatially specific, but not temporally (you can look at the characters as long as you wish); other media, including the cinema or the theatre, develop characters over a specific time and space. Second, certain kinetic properties of media and their characters are connected with the spatio-temporal ones: characters in paintings are static; characters in computer games are dynamic. The third aspect refers to the semiotic code of character representation, and the sense of the recipients affected: On the one hand, there is language as a »code which speaks to the mind through the conventional meaning of its signs«, while on the other there are some »sensory modes of expression, such as sounds and pictures, which convey meaning without relying on a fixed semantic content«.35 Because of this, characters develop varying degrees of sensory presence or distance, concreteness or abstraction. Fourth, if several codes and sensory channels are combined, they are related to each other in varying states of priority – music, for instance is more significant in the creation of character in the opera than in drama in general. The fifth differentiation deals with the technological support and materiality of signs: television allows for live broadcasts of theatre figures, while cinema does not. Finally, the cultural role and methods of production/distribution is, according to Ryan, a pragmatic differentiation: Individual media fulfil a range of functions within the system of the media, and they follow rather practical conventions: The production of a feature film is more expensive than, say, the production of a novel, and the economic considerations this entails frequently influence the creation of characters. These differentiations can be illustrated briefly using the example of Guy Ritchie’s action movie Sherlock Holmes (2009). The cinematic representation of Holmes deviates from that of Doyles’ narratives in a number of ways: In the film, Holmes is not represented by printed words but by moving images and sound, which gives him a sensory specificity that at the same time diminishes the range of individual imaginations by the recipients. The film employs specific visual and auditory strategies of characterisation, including the acting of Robert Downey Jr., the dynamic montage and the urging music. Close-ups invite the study of Holmes’ facial expression, while long shots place him in his London surroundings. Holmes’ actions are slotted into a precise temporal dramaturgy, and despite the ironical mode of narration, the impression that the character is _____________ 35 Ibid., p. 291.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n19\n\nmediated through a narrator recedes into the background. This actionoriented version of Holmes, which emphasises the bodily rather than the mental capacities of the sleuth, owes much to economic constraints. However, some similarities to the literary or dramatic representations of Holmes do remain: as in novels and short stories, Holmes in the movie is characterised through various, changing perspectives, times and places; as in theatre performances, he is represented by an actor and addresses the senses of the spectators in a finite temporal sequence. In none of these media, however, the audience is in control of the character or interact with him – ludic elements that are characteristic of computer games. In view of such basic differences the question arises to what extent we may still speak of the same character here. It is frequently the case that characters are distributed via numerous texts, media and cultures over time.36 But is the character the same in all of these cases? Is the hero of Ritchie’s action movie identical with Doyle’s Holmes? Or did Doyle himself perhaps create different Holmes characters in his various stories?37 Characters can be presented across the media, and in principle, any character can appear in any medium. Their appearances in various media products may differ according to their qualities as artifact, symbol or symptom (i.e., their crafted-ness, their meaning, and their references to reality), but it will still be the same character as long as the core features of the fictional being remain the same. There are, however, kinds of characters or character types that are specific to one medium and therefore difficult to transfer. Computer game characters such as Pacman who fulfil a predominantly ludic function and possess only few traits would appear fairly uninteresting in other media – who would want to read a novel about Pacman? In contrast to this, characters like Holmes are present in various media; they are at the centre of transmedial storytelling.38 This is not only the case with media adaptations of individual _____________ 36 See Werner Wunderlich’s contribution to this volume, in which he demonstrates this with the example of Cenerentola, providing ample material. 37 The contributions by Brian Richardson and Maria Reicher to this volume deal with questions of trans-textual and trans-medial identity of characters. According to Richardson, truly trans-textual characters are legitimised through the author of the original character, and they are congruent with it in terms of traits. Reicher offers an explanation for this kind of continuity of traits, differentiating between two ways of approaching the character: when experts interpret a character, they refer to a ›maximal character‹, possessing a multitude of detailed traits; normal recipients, in contrast, tend to speak about ›sub-maximal‹ characters with fewer differentiated traits. A reference to the diegetic core elements of a character in the sense of a ›sub-maximal character‹ will suffice to establish trans-textual identity. 38 Jenkins: Culture.\n\n20\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\nworks, as e.g. literary adaptations, but even more so with the protagonists of the major entertainment franchises (including James Bond, Lara Croft, Harry Potter, or the characters from the Lord of the Rings), and even characters from advertisements (Ronald McDonald) or the personae created by successful comedians (Sacha Baron Cohen’s Borat). Such transmedial characters occur in a dense network of stories, games and other entertainment products, giving them coherence, and in many cases also their name. They can be found in the media cultures of many countries and exist, beyond the original fictional world, in marketing, merchandising, fan fiction, news reports and recipients’ conversations. The trans-medial presence of characters reaches its peak when characters are not even created through one original text in one medium, but amalgamated from sources in various media. Henry Jenkins, in his discussion of ›synergistic storytelling‹ emphasises that certain dispositions in the characters ›The Kid‹ and Niobe in The Matrix Reloaded can only be understood if the corresponding short films and computer games from the context of the film are known.39 We are only able to hint at the complex questions connected with the media specificity, intertextuality and trans-mediality of characters – serious scholarly investigation of them has only just begun. 5 Character and Action For a long time, theories of prose fiction, theatre and film have played character and action off against each other, and they have tended to give the preference to action. One of the oldest theoretical statements on character reflects on the relation of character and action in this way: »for tragedy is not a representation of men but of a piece of action […]. Moreover, you could not have a tragedy without action, but you can have one without character-study«.40 What Aristotle said in relation to tragedy became the origin of a school of thought which claims that in order to understand a character in a fictional world, one need only analyse its role in the action.41 The most common labels for character in use since Greek antiquity refer in fact to the role, or function, of a character in the action of a narrative: ›Protagonist‹ refers to the main character of a narrative or a play, and ›antagonist‹ to its main opponent. In modern literary theory, the _____________ 39 Jenkins: Culture, pp. 103–110. 40 Aristotle: Poetics, 1450a. 41 Pfister: Drama, p. 220.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n21\n\napproach that reduced characters to mere functions in the action was put on a new foundation, especially in the plot theories of structuralism and in actant models.42 In a ground-breaking corpus study of the Russian folktale, Vladimir Propp43 analysed a hundred Russian fairy tales, constructing a sequence of 31 functions which he attributed to seven areas of action or types of character: opponent; donor; helper; princess and her father; dispatcher; hero; false hero. Greimas44 generalised this approach with his actant model in which all narrative characters are regarded as expressions of an underlying narrative grammar composed of six actants ordered into pairs: the hero (also sujet) and his search for an object; the sender and the receiver; the hero’s helper and the opponent. Each actant is not necessarily realised in one single character, since one character may perform more than one role, and one role may be distributed among several characters. Schank’s concept of story skeletons also starts from the idea that stories have an underlying structure, but in his model there are many such structures and therefore many different roles for actors, e.g. the story of a divorce using the story skeleton ›betrayal‹ with the two actors: the betrayer and the betrayed.45 The models presented here stand in contrast to a number of approaches in drama theory and in practical film theory.46 The changing number of potential positions that characters can have surrounding the core constellation of protagonist and antagonist indicates that such models are to some extent contingent, except for the core itself. If we wish to explicate which of them lends itself best to the analysis of functional roles, their theoretical foundations and their practical applicability would have to come under close scrutiny and be compared accordingly. Whether one takes as one’s starting point the syntax of the language (see Greimas), analogies to mental problem solving processes (as do the developers of Dramatica), or Jung’s theory of archetypes – none of the theoretical bases is in itself unproblematic. In spite of the differences between the models, they all contain similar core functions. This suggests that these at least can be found in typical and wide-spread types of narration. The claim that the action of a narrative is more important than the characters must, in any case, remain ambiguous as long as it remains _____________ 42 43 44 45 46\n\nChatman: Story, pp. 108ff.; Koch: Menschendarstellung.

The term action can refer, in order of increasing specificity, to the following items: 1. The entire set of events in a story, including events which are not set in motion by characters but by chance, nature, etc. Included in this definition are also events in which characters are neither involved as agents nor affected in any other way, e.g., a sunrise that only the audience watches. 2. The overall activities of the characters, including the consequences of these activities. This definition also includes the mental processes in the minds of characters. Many modernist novels, with their focus on the inner life of characters, present little action in terms of physical activity and changes of situation, but much action in terms of the characters’ psychological processes. Virginia Woolf summed up this tendency of the modernist novel to ›turn within‹ in her programmatic plea for a representation of the ›truth‹ of human existence beyond surface action, and even beyond the seeming logic of a plot: »Let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall, let us trace the pattern, however disconnected and incoherent in appearance, which each sight or incident scores upon the consciousness«.47 3. Only the intentional behaviour of the characters, their speech and action. Some media genres favour narratives that focus on such behaviour, either because they profit from the spectacular, such as the adventure story, the war movie and a good number of computer games; or because the very intentionality is the point of the narrative, as is the case in the mystery, crime and detective story – the ›whodunit‹ usually includes the question why someone committed a crime. 4. Only the physical activities of characters, excluding their speech acts. Although there will be few examples of fictional worlds in which characters move and do things without ever speaking, some media genres heavily rely on action as a means of characterisation and narration, as can be seen in the suggestion of many screenwriting manuals to tell the story by action rather than by dialogue. The action of a story in the sense of item 1 may not be constituted exclusively by characters’ actions in the sense of items 2 to 4, but in most cases, such actions will account for the major part of the story: Stories are always stories of and about someone, and they narrate the activities of anthropomorphous characters as a rule.48 Character, in contrast, can in _____________ 47 Woolf: Common, p. 190. 48 See Eder: Dramaturgie, pp. 78–82.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n23\n\nprinciple be presented without any action, as is the case in portraits, descriptions or sculptures. Even in the temporal media, such as film, some minor characters are characterised not by action but, for example, by a physiognomy that hints at the features of personality. At least in some media and some phases in the narration of fictional worlds, then, characters can be independent of action (in every sense), which is not true the other way round. There are also features of characters that are independent of action, and action-oriented approaches tend to overlook these aspects. They fail to capture the audience’s understanding and experiencing of the fictional world, which is frequently focused on the characters. It is particularly in the cinema that a character has »a palpable autonomy that seems to make action subordinate to his/her prior existence«,49 and a similar statement can of course be made for theatre. Features of characters that are independent of action may influence not only the audience’s empathy, but also determine the thematic focus of a text, as well as its ethics and rhetoric. Therefore, if the action-oriented perspective is not complemented by one that focuses on character, central aspects of fictional worlds are overlooked. With reference to the dramaturgical functions of characters in the plot, we can differentiate between two approaches. The traditional approaches have tended to employ a genre- and period-specific vocabulary for action roles. Examples that come to mind are the allegorical stock characters of the morality play (everyman, vice, folly, etc.), confidant and intriguer in traditional drama, the libertine and the fop in English Restoration comedy, or villain, sidekick, and henchman in the popular media of the 20th century. Other approaches have looked at characters’ functions in more generalised ways. In an influential work, Campbell, for instance, described what he called the ›monomyth‹, using a term coined by James Joyce. A monomyth is an abstraction of numerous mythological and religious stories marking the stages of the hero’s way: separation/departure; the trials and victories of initiation; return and reintegration into society.50 According to Campbell, who bases his argument on Freud’s and especially on Jung’s version of psychoanalysis, the monomyth is universal and can be found in stories, myths, and legends all over the world. The tradition of universalist approaches has continued until today. For instance, Vogler has applied Campbell’s approach to the structure of Hollywood films and has been influential in the screen trade.51 From a _____________ 49 Bordwell: Cognition, pp. 183–198. 50 Campbell: Hero, p. 36 51 See Vogler: Journey.\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\n24\n\nmore theoretically founded perspective, Patrick Colm Hogan argues that identifiable universal patterns of story-telling and emplotment are generated by a restricted set of human emotions across time and space.52 Although many of the approaches to plot have focused on the action rather than the characters, as we have seen, there are at least some approaches in the bewildering diversity of plot theories,53 which have emphasised the connections rather than the distinction between character and action. E.M. Forster coined the wide-spread definition of plot as the causal and logical connections which exist between the actions of the characters in a story, and which underlie the temporal sequence in which the story is presented. In this vein, we may look at the ›and‹ in ›character and action‹ as signifying a connection rather than a separation. The logic of the story then automatically implies the logic of the character’s intentions and hopes as to future events. Consequently, in order to understand the story, the reader or viewer needs to understand the wishes, plans and motivations of the characters. Among the approaches to plot that pay attention to the wish-world of the characters and the mental projection of potential, non-actual actions by the audience are those put forward by Bremond54 and the more elaborated formulation in terms of possible worlds theory by Ryan.55 Furthermore, Palmer expands the perspective to include the ›social mind in action‹.56 The ›motivation‹ of characters constitutes the interface between characters and action. The term motivation usually refers to a part of the psyche, the inner life and personality traits: the entirety of psychical processes that initiate, maintain and regulate behaviour. This definition includes aims, wishes, feelings and drives.57 We explain the actions of characters by ascribing them such motivations, and we expect certain actions once we know their motivations. This is why motivation tends to be the motor and the centre of a story, transmits its theme and presents a significant influence on emotional reactions. It is important both for narrating characters and for interpreting them. Thus, even a rather formulaic narrative that has traditionally been analysed in terms of characters’ plot functions requires at least one character’s motivation in order to set the action in motion. Consider, for instance, heroic epics _____________ 52 53 54 55 56 57\n\nHogan: Mind; see also Hogan’s contribution to this volume. Dannenberg: Plot. Bremond: Logic, pp. 387–411. See Ryan: Worlds. Palmer: Minds; see also his contribution in this volume. On the psychological definition of 'motivation', see the relevant sections in Gerrig / Zimbardo: Psychology, chap. 11.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n25\n\ncentering around a quest plot, which can be found in Western narratives from Beowulf to The Lord of the Rings. If the aim of saving the community from an external or internal threat were not an important element in the value system of the hero, he would never venture out to face the dangers; there is either the fear of disturbances to the community (and, conversely, the wish to keep disturbances away); also, he must hope for some reward for his deeds, whether the acknowledgement of the community, the love of a lady, or riches. Values, aims, wishes, hopes and fears therefore propel the action of the hero, and they invite a psychological reading of the character at the same time. Most modern narratives deal with problems that motivate the characters’ actions. The plotting of mainstream films, for instance, follows the aims of their protagonists, who are involved in exciting problem-solving processes.58 Motivation is a precondition also in other forms of narration: Episodic narratives deal with the momentary problems of several characters; character studies focus on unconscious needs of persons on a quest, and even characters who do not even try to fulfill their wishes produce actions on a small scale to which we ascribe motivation. Even when surreal narratives and films, such as Un chien andalou, prevent us from reconstructing motivations, they generate their potential to provoke from the fact that apparently we cannot help but look for motivations. Motivations in many cases are the core of the personality of fictional beings, particularly in their interaction with other characters, so that the basic motivations of characters are a major element of their evaluation and interpretation. Once we turn to understanding narratives on the basis of characters' motivations, it is helpful to differentiate between various kinds and aspects of motivation. Concepts from psychology, philosophy, drama theory and theories of fictional worlds can contribute to a more refined definition of motivation.59 Motivations differ according to whether they are localised in the person itself or in its environment, whether they are egotistic or altruistic, whether the person is aware of and willing or able to reflect on them, how stable and influential they are, and whether they are consistent or contradictory. To take an example: Is a murder that Holmes investigates explained by a momentary impulse, the personality of the murderer, the external situation or determined by previous events? Is it a planned homicide by a hired killer or an act of madness? Did the doer pursue the plan for a long time? Did he kill for his own advantage or because he wanted to protect others?

Motivation is, finally, an important factor in the constellation of characters, which places individual characters in a network of relationships. 6 Character Constellations Characters do not tend to appear on their own in narratives. In most cases they are part of a constellation of at least two, and frequently many more, characters. This constellation puts all the characters of a fictional world in relation to each other. The traditional classifications of characters that go back to antiquity are already based on the notion that characters are related to each other: The term ›protagonist‹, derived from the term for the first player in the classical Greek tragedy, classifies a character in terms of his function in the action, as does the opposite term, ›antagonist‹. Other terms point in the same direction: minor character, opponent, parallel or foil character – all view characters as in some way related to other characters. An average 19th century English novel presents some two dozens of interrelated characters, a novel by Charles Dickens easily goes up to fifty or more, and in films like Ghandi or a TV series like Six Feet Under, these systems of relationships comprise up to several hundred speaking parts. A character constellation is, however, more than the mere sum of all the characters. Its structure is determined by all relationships between the characters: relations of importance, correspondences and contrasts of properties and functions, interaction and communication, conflict and agreement, mutual seeing and listening to, wishes and desires, power and value systems, narration and being narrated, perspective and participation.60 This is why the character constellation of a text is an abstraction. One way of reconstructing it is by looking at the changing configurations in the scenes (scenes in drama, chapters or sequences in novels, sequences or shots in film, etc.) in which certain characters are present at the same time. The dynamics of the character relationships can be approached via the succession of scenic configurations. The configuration profile of a theatre performance, a film or an episode highlights, for instance, which _____________ 60 On character constellations see Platz-Waury: Figurenkonstellation, pp. 591f.; Pfister: Drama; Tröhler: Hierarchien, pp. 20–27.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n27\n\ncharacters appear, and when and how many times they do, with which other characters they appear together and with which they don’t. Having said that, there are of course numerous examples in which the quantitative analysis of only the configuration misses the point of the text. Who would doubt, for instance, that the love relationship in Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet is the central interest of the play? They appear together on the stage, however, in only four of the scenes, and some of these encounters are rather short. Another example is Graham Swift’s novel Last Orders (1996), in which four elderly friends go on a journey together in order to bring the ashes of their deceased friend, Jack Dodds, to the sea and disperse them there, according to his will. During the journey, the individual memories produce a kaleidoscopic view of Jack and his various relationships to each of the four friends plus a large number of other characters. The character constellation of this novel thus includes a range of configurations that are ›only‹ remembered, in addition to the ones that occur in the main story time. What is more important in these cases is the qualitative analysis of the relationships and the properties of the characters. To some extent, then, character constellations can be mental constructs invited by the text but not necessarily projected there by the configurations. Such qualitative aspects as slight contrasts between two (or more characters), whether they have scenic appearances together or not, are particularly usful for highlighting the individuality of each of them and pointing to the thematic focus of the text.61 The concept of the character constellation is an important tool for the analysis and interpretation of media products and works of art. It has proved particularly useful in the analysis of novels, TV series or transmedial narrative universes that contain complex social networks. With the help of constellation analysis, various kinds of relationships can be investigated, including their social relationships (conflicts and bonds), their values and norms (moral and otherwise), their diegetic and aesthetic similarities and differences (parallel and foil characters), the hierarchies of relevance (main vs. minor characters), and their dramaturgical and thematic functions.62 The analysis of those aspects is closely connected to questions of ideology, politics, and understanding texts as indicators of collective dispositions, problems, wishes and fears in a certain time and culture.63 _____________ 61 In their contribution in this volume Emmott / Sanford / Alexander distinguish between principal characters and scenario-dependent characters. 62 Eder: Figur, pp. 464–520. 63 For instance, Margrit Tröhler connects the proliferation of multi-protagonist films in recent years with increased cultural skepticism about heroes and a greater willingkess\n\n28\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\n7 Identifying Characters Some media texts and works of art such as paintings, sculptures or one-act plays display characters in a temporally continuous, unified or even static representation. In most narratives however, characters are presented in separate sequences interrupted by parts in which they do not appear. The question is how a character is recognised in each of the sequences, and how the individual representations are related to each other. This point is even more acute if these representations occur in different media formats or texts: if, for instance, a drawing of Holmes illustrates a novel, or if we identify Holmes across several novels or serial instalments.64 The fact that in real life humans ascribe a spatio-temporal continuity to bodies and assume that persons continue to exist even if they cannot be seen or heard anymore, is a precondition for this ability to identify characters. Fictional worlds constructed in the media can rely on our willingness to keep the characters existent if they are not shown or mentioned. For this to happen, each individual medium needs to establish the link between the initial presentation of a character and the subsequent occurrences. Obviously, the way characters are presented differs across various forms of media. In purely language-based texts nothing acquires an existence of its own if it is not explicitly mentioned. The link between one presentation of a character and the next will differ according to the technique of mentioning. Usually, the link is established by a stable referent, whether in the form of a name (Holmes) or a repeated description (›my friend‹ – as Sherlock Holmes is sometimes called by the narrator Watson). The mention or presentation of objects, especially articles of clothing, can have the same effect of supporting the identity of the character referred to. Scenes play a major role in the process of identity construction within individual media texts. Literary and audiovisual narratives can, following Catherine Emmott, be understood as sequences of scenes or situational frames, of which only one is active at a particular point in the narration.65 Scenes integrate spatio-temporal aspects with events and information _____________ to consider multiple perspectives on complex modern worlds. See Tröhler: Welten; also her contribution to this book. 64 See Maria Elisabeth Reicher’s contribution on the ontology of characters and Brian Richardson's chapter on transtextual characters in this volume. 65 See Emmott: Comprehension, and the contribution by Catherine Emmott, Anthony J. Sanford and Marc Alexander in this volume; cf. also the reformulation of this approach in Jannidis: Figur, pp. 109–149, which contains a more detailed discussion of the various aspects of identifying characters.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n29\n\nabout the characters. Links to previous character representations in scenes follow special rules; in a scene in which two female and one male character are present, the personal pronoun ›he‹ will suffice to refer to one of the characters unequivocally. Identifying characters with the help of (anaphoric) references in language-based texts can be described systematically as follows. References to characters can be direct or indirect. Direct references include the use of names, definitive descriptions (e.g., ›the boy‹, ›the visitor‹) and personal pronouns.66 Indirect references can be made by the presentation of direct character speech without any introductory fomulae, the description of actions that do not refer to any one character directly (›a hand grabbed‹) or the use of the passive voice (›the window was opened‹). The first reference to a character can be termed the ›introduction‹; if reference to the character is made in a subsequent frame, we speak of ›identification‹.67 We can differentiate between normal, false, impeded, and deferred identifications. A ›false identification‹ occurs when a previously mentioned character is identified but it turns out later that some other character was in fact being referred to. An ›impeded identification‹ does not refer unequivocally to any specific character, and a clear reference to the character or characters is never given in the text, while in the case of ›deferred identification‹ the recipient is ultimately able to establish the identity of an equivocally presented character. Deferred identification can further be broken down into an overt form in which the recipient knows that he is kept in the dark and a covert form in which he does not.68 In purely auditory media like the radio play, voice, typical sounds or musical leitmotifs are added to the above list of linguistic linking devices. In purely visual media, such as comics or the silent movie, identification is usually (i.e., except for intertitles or captions) established by the similarity or identity of the visual appearance of a character, which is created through the bodies, and especially the faces, presented by the actor, or the drawing or animation.69 In silent movies, characters are three-dimensional entities, many of whose outer attributes (looks, beauty, dress, age, gender) are immediately apparent, while other features such as names, traits, social position and relationships only emerge in the course of the film, if at all. Sound film and other audiovisual media (video games, internet clips) combine stills, moving images, spoken and written language, sound and _____________ 66 Margolin: Literary Narrative, p. 374. 67 In film studies, Murray Smith uses the term ›re-identification‹ to distinguish it from ›identification with‹ characters. See Smith: Characters, pp. 110–116. 68 Jannidis: Figur, chap. 4 and 6, based on Emmott: Comprehension. 69 Smith: Characters, pp. 110–141 on the re-identification of characters in film.\n\n30\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\nmusic, and can therefore also combine different techniques of identification. Rick Blaine in Casablanca, for instance, is first introduced by linguistic means, for his name appears on the lettering on his café, and other characters talk about him. This will arouse the audience’s curiosity and make them expect his first appearance, which happens, however, only ten minutes after the film has started. The combination of language and image is established in this scene by having Rick write his name on a cheque and by having the camera pan on the upper part of his body after a cut. As in the case of Rick Blaine, the identification of characters in film, and also in music videos, is frequently predetermined by additional contextual cues. This not only concerns the text itself, but also certain para-texts. All cues which are apt to activate social and narrative knowledge in certain communicative contexts (pre-release information, advertising, paratexts, etc.) play a role in identifying characters, and they can also contribute to characterisation (see the following section).70 When characters are represented by actors or pop stars who have had appearances in other media products, a complex network of identifications emerges.71 Characters in film can even be re-identified when they are presented by different actors with entirely different looks, as is the case in Todd Solondz’ Palindrome.72 The narrative context is of great importance for establishing continuity here. A character that has been introduced by the text and identified by a recipient is attributed properties in the course of the reception. This is the area of characterisation, which we will discuss in the next section. 8 Characterisation Until recently, characterisation was understood to mean the ascription of mainly psychological or social traits to a character by the text.73 In fact, however, texts ascribe all manner of properties to characters, including physiological and locative ones. Thus, the term ›characterisation‹ can refer to different phenomena, not all of which are distinguished from each other clearly enough in common usage. In many cases, the term is used when a person is ascribed a certain number of stable properties. These _____________ 70 Eder: Figur, pp. 326–254. 71 On characters and stars in the music video, see the contribution by Christian Huck, Jens Kiefer and Carsten Schinko in this volume. 72 See the contribution of Johannes Riis in this volume for a discussion of this phenomenon. 73 E.g. Chatman: Story.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n31\n\nproperties tend to be character traits, as for example in ›he was shy and anxious‹. Many languages have a rich stock of words for such character traits at their disposal.74 This dimension of the term ›characterisation‹ includes statements about the outer appearance of a character. These can be rather unspecific – ›his beauty attracted men and women alike‹ – and perhaps in some way related to character traits, but they can also refer to certain specific physical markers, such as a high forehead. Whether such remarks are decoded to refer to character traits depends on the cultural contexts: In the 19th century, the popular pseudo-sciences of physiognomy and phrenology provided a code system for creating and understanding literary character via the descriptions of the shape of the head, nose, chin, mouth, etc.75 In a broader sense, the term characterisation is frequently used to refer to information about habitual actions, the circumstances of a person and his or her social relationships: e.g., ›he lived a very secluded life‹, ›his flat was furnished in a plain style‹, ›the family doctor was his only friend‹. Such pieces of information tend to be indirect characterisations: they invite the recipient to look for a character trait that motivates the action, the circumstances or the relationships. Usually, however, more information comes in to play, for one piece of information may also hint at other motivations: A shy person may be homeless and ashamed, and somebody may be living a secluded life because they suffer from paranoia. The broadest definition of characterisation includes all information associated with a character in a text. In addition to the usages already listed, this includes information about time, place, actions, and events connected to the character. In many cases, this is contingent information that does not hint at stable character traits. Part of this information can of course be understood to contribute to the narrative identity of the character – comparable to other operations of identity construction. It even makes sense to use this broadest sense of characterisation, simply because it is not easy to decide where to draw the line between information that is characterising and information that is not, and because the question arises whether we would not have to regard all information as contributing to narrative identity. The word ›character‹ in ›characterisation‹ puts the emphasis on a specific mental entity that is imagined as stable (e.g., ›he is a difficult person‹). In this sense, only statements about _____________ 74 Allport and Odbert found nearly 18.000 English words for character traits, and since then there has been considerable further research on that topic. Cf. John: Taxonomy, pp. 66–100. 75 For example, Lavater’s physiognomy was very successful and influential; Graham: Lavaters’ Essays.\n\n32\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\ncharacter traits ought to count as characterisations. Having said that, there is the danger that one particular conception of character/personality, which may be culturally specific, forms the basis of all characterisations. Therefore, even if we would argue for a very broad definition of characterisation, we have to acknowledge that the usage of the term in the second sense is more common, both in everyday language and in literary scholarship. In any case, whoever uses the term in whatever sense ought to be aware of the implications. Characterisation (in the wide sense) can then be defined as the process of connecting information with a figure in a text so as to provide a character in the fictional world with a certain property, or properties, concerning body, mind, behaviour, or relations to the (social) environment. From the perspective of reception, this distribution of information about a character corresponds to processes of understanding the character: Textual cues or signs activate inferences based on different kinds of knowledge about reality as well as about media and communication.76 In the language-based media, characterisation works by directly and verbally ascribing to characters certain traits which are not visible from the outside, particularly psychological traits. Indirect characterisation also ascribes traits directly in words, or it reports actions which may hint at invisible states and properties. This includes all manners of activity, from habitual movements to the description of actions a character performs in his or her working life, down to the report of habitual movements or gait. In addition to that, when characters are focalizers, their mind style, i.e. habits of reasoning and of formulating thoughts in the mind, may hint at traits. Literary scholarship has introduced the differentiation of modes of characterization, some of which are media-specific, while others are not. As early as the 19th century, literary critics spoke of the difference between direct and indirect characterisation. Scherer,77 for instance, differentiates between direct presentation, which involves the explicit naming of the traits (»Ich zähle die Eigenschaften auf, die jemand besitzt«) on the one hand, and indirect presentation, in which the traits, and the entire personality of a character or a person need to be guessed from words, opinions and actions, on the other (»bei welcher man aus Worten, Gesinnungen, Thaten gewisse Eigenschaften und so den ganzen Charakter errathen lässt«). He argues that writers in his day prefer the _____________ 76 Cf. also Jannidis chap. 6; Schneider: Grundriß, pp. 80–90; Eder: Figur: pp. 69–107; 168–232; 326–372. 77 Scherer: Poetik, pp. 156–157.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n33\n\nindirect mode to the direct one, which is used in historiography, and sometimes in the novel. The indirect mode, according to Scherer, is both more skilled (»kunstvoll«) and closer to life, because this is the way we infer personality traits of other human beings. This technique of having the audience guess (»die Technik des Errathenlassens«) relies on the activity of the audience (»Selbstthätigkeit des Publicums«), whose interest can be increased by precisely this strategy.78 To conceptualize direct and indirect characterization as a binary opposition, however, is less convincing than meets the eye. All of the above characterisation strategies in both the language-based and the visual and audiovisual media may appear more or less direct to the recipients, and in many cases it is all but impossible to define which is the case: If a character in a novel is described as ›plain‹, it will to some extent depend on the specific cultural and social milieu of the character – and the reader’s knowledge of its conventions – whether this verbal ascription is directly understood to refer to a certain disposition or not. In a similar vein, can the close-up of a care-worn face in a film still be called ›indirect‹? So it is probably more accurate to view direct vs. indirect as a continuum; characterisation can then be described as more or less direct. Another important differentiation is that between alterocharacterisation and self-characterisation, for information about characters can be provided by agencies other than the character (the narrator, for instance, or other characters in the same fictional world), or the character may ascribe properties to him- or herself. Other characters may pass on perfectly reliable information about the character in question, and there is no reason to assume that each and every altero-characterisation is entirely wrong simply because characters’ perspectives happen to be naturally restricted by subjectivity. The other characters, however, may also pursue their own aims and motivations in the social interaction when they make a characterising statement. Such statements can therefore reveal their own value systems, so that every explicit altero-characterisation can also be read as an indirect self-characterisation of the utterer. Moreover, characterisation is not always reliable. Some textually explicit ascriptions of properties to a character may turn out to be invalid, as when this information comes from an unreliable narrator or fellow-character. Explicit ascriptions may also turn out to be hypothetical or purely subjective. The crucial issue in the process of characterisation is thus what information, especially of a psychological nature, a recipient is able to _____________ 78 Ibid., pp. 156f.\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\n34\n\nassociate with any character as a member of the fictional world and where this information comes from. There are at least three sources of such information: (a) textually explicit ascription of properties to a character, whether in altero-characterisation or in self-characterisation; (b) inferences that can be drawn from textual cues (e.g. ›she smiled nervously‹); (c) inferences based on information which is not associated with the character by the text itself but through reference to historically and culturally variable real-world conventions (e.g. when the appearance of a room reveals something about the person living there or the weather expresses the feelings of the protagonist).79 Most inferences can be understood in terms of abductions. Abduction is a more heuristic form of reasoning than deduction and induction.80 Abductive reasoning infers the case from the result and the rule: (1) Socrates is mortal. -- (2) All humans are mortal. -- (3) Socrates is human. Such reasoning is not obligatory; if ›Socrates‹ is the name of a dog, (1) and (2) are still valid, but (3) is false. The inference is therefore based mostly on likelihood and it is part of a heuristic which produces well-founded assumptions rather than certified knowledge in the best case. The question in each case is whether the right rule was used for the phenomenon, i.e., the observed result. If we understand inferences in terms of abductions, the fundamental role of character models and of the character encyclopedia as rules becomes obvious: (1) is given in the text, but (2) is usually only presupposed by it and has to be supplied. Characterisation can therefore be re-conceptualised as a process to which both the text and the recipient contribute (see below). Another key issue concerns the limits and underlying rules of such inferences when they are applied to fictional beings. Ryan, noting that recipients tend to assume that a fictional world resembles the real world unless explicitly stated otherwise, adopts the philosopher David Lewis’s ›principle of minimal departure‹.81 In a thorough criticism of this and similar hypotheses, Walton points out that this would make an infinite number of inferences possible, and he comes to the conclusion: There is no particular reason why anyone’s beliefs about the real world should come into play. As far as implications are concerned, simple conventions to the effect that whenever such and such is fictional, so and so is as well, serve nicely […]. 82\n\n_____________ 79 For a systematic description of such inferences employed in characterisation, cf. Margolin: Characterization. 80 Keller: Theory, chap. 9, based on Peirce. 81 Ryan: Fiction. 82 Walton: Mimesis, p. 166.\n\nCharacters in Fictional Worlds: An Introduction\n\n35\n\nThis approach, in turn, increases the number of conventions without necessity and without providing any convincing argument as to how recipients go about accessing these conventions, apart from drawing on their real-world knowledge, despite the fact that many conventions apply only to fictional worlds. Even so, this does not invalidate Walton’s criticism, which can probably be refuted only by including another element: the fact that characters are constitutive of fictional worlds which are not self-contained, but communicated. Recipients’ assumptions about what is relevant in the process of communication determine the scope and validity of inferences.83 Conan Doyle’s readers may of course infer that Holmes’ chin is stubbly when he does not shave; that his bodily functions are comparable to those of Watson, and, indeed, the reader; that he wears underwear under his characteristic garments – but both agents in the communication process, Doyle and his readers, appear to follow a tacit understanding that these points are unlikely to be what the story is about. The presentation of characters is a dynamic process, as is the construction of characters in the recipient’s mind. Schneider,84 building on concepts developed by Gerrig & Allbritton,85 has proposed a model for describing the psychological or cognitive dynamics that come into play here, based on the ›top-down‹ and ›bottom-up‹ processes observed during empirical studies on reading comprehension. The processing of information in the top-down mode involves the activation of a knowledge structure, such as a schema or a category, stored in long-term memory; this structure is initially triggered by a piece of textual information and will then guide the further processing as long as possible. Bottom-up information processing, in contrast, involves the successive accumulation of textual information in working memory, where it is kept accessible until it can be connected with prior knowledge or turned into a category or schema itself. In understanding a character in a fictional world, the recipient builds a mental model of the character into which all characterising information is integrated. Depending on the quality and quantity of the information on the character presented in the text on the one hand, and the availability of knowledge structures of the recipient on the other, the mental model construction can proceed in either of two ways: A topdown process occurs in the application of a category to a character, by slotting the information given in the text into this category, while a bottom-up process results from the successive integration of information _____________ 83 See Sperber / Wilson: Relevance. 84 Schneider: Grundriß; Schneider: Theory. 85 Gerrig / Allbritton: Construction.\n\n36\n\nJens Eder / Fotis Jannidis / Ralf Schneider\n\non a character, which will lead to an individualised representation. At the beginning of a character presentation, textual cues may trigger various types of categorisation: social types (›the teacher‹, ›the widow‹); literary or media types (the hero in a Bildungsroman); text-specific types (characters that do not change throughout the story and are introduced in a way that evokes precisely that expectation). The mind, following a principle of parsimony, will tend to slot as many characters into such categories as possible. Successful top-down processing, however, depends on the availability of knowledge structures, and the varieties of types just mentioned involve different types of knowledge that feed into the processing: social knowledge and categories from folk psychology; literary or media knowledge, especially narrative knowledge (of genres with their typical character constellations, character types, actants, and characters’ narrative functions, etc.).86 While producers of characters can use categorisation cues for efficient characterisation, on the side of the recipient the categorised mental model is felt to be complete at a fairly early stage. In contrast to the top-down processing that takes place in these forms of categorisation, bottom-up processing occurs when the recipient is unable to integrate the given information into an existing category, resulting in a personalised mental model of the character. This is frequently reached by producers of characters through the distribution of characterising i"
