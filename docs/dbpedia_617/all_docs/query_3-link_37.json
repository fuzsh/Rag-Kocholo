        "text": "The stunning home of former NSW Premier Nick Greiner and his ex-wife Kathryn has opened its doors to buyers after the couple announced the end of their marriage.\n\nThe five-bedroom property in Centennial Park, Sydney, which is immaculately presented throughout and boasts a beautiful outdoor swimming pool, will go under the hammer on October 27 with a guide price of around $6 million.\n\nThe home, which is spread across three floors, sits in a prime location and it is understood the house has attracted a few offers in the last few months which were deemed unacceptable to both parties.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nThe house sits on a plot of 822 square metres and the couple purchased the house in 2002 for $4 million from car dealer Paul Warren who moved down the road, reports Property Observer.\n\nThe former NSW premier and his wife, who was the former Liberal-aligned City of Sydney councillor, publicly ended their marriage in October last year after 43 years of marriage.\n\nThe couple issued a statement saying that they had been leading increasingly separate lives.\n\nThe statement at the time said: 'Nick and Kathryn Greiner have agreed to separate. After a great deal of thought they have decided to lead individual lives.'\n\n'The decision is mutual and amicable. They remain good friends and are completely devoted to their family. They will not be making any further comment.'\n\nThe breakdown of the couple's marriage followed a tough time for Budapest-born businessman Mr Greiner, who was the 37th Premier of NSW, after he stepped down from being the chairman of Barry O'Farrell's government advisory body Infrastructure NSW in July last year.\n\nThe couple also split in 1966 when the businessman and politician admitted to having an affair but they later got back together.\n\nMr and Mrs Greiner have two children together, Justin and Kara, and they told at the time how they reconnected for the sake of their children."
