Hundreds of area school students, staff, and group home residents came for the free youth and adult parties. During the youth parties attendees enjoyed swimming, the wall climb, arts and crafts, games, and other activities. Everyone enjoyed holiday treats, met with Santa, and received a holiday gift. Thank you to everyone who attended this year’s events. A special thank you to “Dixie Notes Plus” for their wonderful performance during the adult party and to all the donors of the gifts that were handed out. The camp also appreciates all the volunteers who helped wrap the gifts. “…because we’re more alike than we are different.” <strong>Camp</strong> <strong>Courageous</strong> is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization run on donations serving individuals of all ages with disabilities.
