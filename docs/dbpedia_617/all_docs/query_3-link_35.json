I will make a few remarks then\n\nNick will follow me and then we'll be available for\n\nquestions and I think there's some experts available here to\n\ngo into any particular details that you might want to\n\naddress. Today the Commonwealth and NSW Governments reached agreement\n\non the South East forest issue. That agreement was reached\n\non the basis of a thorough scientific study of the\n\nbiological values of the South East forests.\n\nHowever, we didn't just rest alone on that. There was\n\nfurther consultation between my Ministers and Nick Greiner's\n\nMinisters and there was a drawing upon the advice of\n\nrelevant Commonwealth and NSW agencies. In our case the\n\nAustralian Heritage Commission and in the case of NSW the\n\nNSW National Parks and Wildlife Service.\n\nOut of all that we have agreed to reserve a somewhat larger\n\narea than came out of the joint scientific study. Nearly\n\nof each of the main National Estate areas will be\n\nprotected. Those areas are Tantawangalo, Coolangubra and\n\nYowaka. With the remaining area, one of them, that's\n\nTantawangali to be determined after a five year hydrological\n\nstudy. In total the amount of additional resources that\n\nhave been withdrawn will be about ll That gives you the\n\nemphasis within the agreement of our concern, our mutual\n\nconcern for environmental conservation issues.\n\nIt's important to understand that as a result of the\n\nagreement it: will ensure that the region will continue to\n\nhave a viable sawmilling industry. I want to point out that\n\nthrough the industry restructuring proposals that\n\nAlan Griffiths will be pursuing with his NSW counterpart,\n\nMr West, and with the industry itself will be encouraging\n\nthe use of the forest residue in value-added processing\n\nrather than its export as woodchips.\n\nIn summary, I believe it's fair to say that the agreement\n\nthat we've reached between us means much greater protection\n\nfor the South East forests than existed before. It means a\n\nviable sawlog industry and it means an encouragement of\n\nvalue-adding.\n\nI am glad that through a long and somewhat tortuous and\n\ncomplex process, Nick, that we've been able to reach this\n\nposition. GREINER: Thank you. Could I just add the NSW Government\n\nbelieves that: this is an important agreement. These things\n\ntend to be seen as wins and losses and no doubt some of you\n\nwill be succumbing to the temptation to try and ascribe wins\n\nand losses to people and positions. The truth is this is\n\nabout as close as you can get to a win-win resolution of a\n\nland use conflict.\n\nAll of the ma~ jor natural heritage values of the area are\n\nbeing, on any reasonable assessment, satisfactorily\n\npreserved. There will-be, as the Prime Minister said,\n\nguarantees of a continuing viable sawmilling industry in the\n\narea. It's my Government's concern to ensure that the job security\n\nand the industry security is maintained and indeed the\n\ndeclaration, the dedication of the National Parks won't be\n\ntaking place until such time as we're satisfied that the\n\ndetails of that are in place.\n\nSo the essence of what we have tried to do in co-operation\n\nwith the Commonwealth is to reach a win-win situation. We\n\nthink that has happened. I think any fairminded assessment\n\nof the outcome would suggest that the preservation of the\n\nmain environmental values, not only for this generation but\n\nfuture generations has been achieved. And equally that for\n\nthe first time, for the first time ever the industry in\n\nSouth Eastern NSW will have a longterm future which will\n\nenable people to make investment decisions, enable jobs to\n\nbe secure and families and towns to have some sort of\n\ncertainty rather than the sort of uncertainty that they've\n\nbeen bedevilled with for the last decade or more.\n\nI think that's really as much as I would like to say other\n\nthan that I -think it has been a good model of cooperation.\n\nIt is important that these sorts of decisions don't become\n\nparty political footballs because they're not susceptible to\n\nbeing very effectively handled if they become party\n\npolitical footballs. I think this has been a good exercise\n\nin cooperation between, if you like, the environmental\n\ndepartments and the resource departments and indeed between\n\nthe two Governments that happen to be of opposite political\n\npersuasion. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister the Conservation Foundation says\n\nthat this won't resolve the conflict in the forests, that\n\nthe situation, well the decision's unacceptable. What do\n\nyou think it's going to take for the conservation societies\n\nto be made happy?\n\nPM: I think when you're talking about the conservation\n\nmovement in this country, Peter, that you've got to\n\nunderstand that it's a very varied movement. I believe that\n\nthere is much the conservation movement, if they study the\n\ndecisions that have been taken, and the fact that we've\n\nextended even beyond the scientific study the degree of\n\nprotection something like, as I say, 60% of each of the\n\nmain National Estate areas any objective judgement would\n\nsay that both my Government and the Government of NSW have\n\nbeen conscious, as we ought to be, of our environmental\n\nobligations to this and future generations. It's also the\n\ncase, Peter, that I think there are some parts of the\n\nenvironmental movement who will never be satisfied unless\n\nthey get 100% of their ambit claims. Now in one sense it\n\nwould be very satisfying to feel, I guess, it would feel the\n\nsame to be able to sit back with a warm glow and say well\n\nyes nothing's going to be touched. But the glow wouldn't\n\nlast for too long because this country has got to have\n\ngrowth, economic growth, if it's going to satisfy the\n\naspirations of its population. We've also got external\n\naccount problems and the dimensions of those are pretty\n\nlarge including in our nett import position of forest\n\nproducts. So in these days no government has the luxury\n\nwhether it's the level of the federal government or the\n\nlevel of the state government, no government has the luxury\n\nof Just being able to have one criterion in the decisions\n\nyou make about these sorts of issues. You'll never be able\n\nto persuade everyone that you've got the balance absolutely\n\nright. But in the case of my Government, and Nick of course\n\ncan speak for his own, but in the case of my Government I'm\n\nproud to look back over the 7h years on our environmental\n\nrecord of the rainforests in Daintree, in Tasmania, our\n\ndecisions in. regard to Kakadu and so on. We've got an\n\nenvironmental record, I think, second to none around the\n\nworld but on. this issue it was a tough one but all I can say\n\nto the environmental movement, we have tried to go as far as\n\nwe can in discharging the obligation we feel we have in\n\nregard to the environment.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister the statement mentions a\n\ncontribution. to the total annual trade deficit of the timber\n\nproducts area. What do you think is an acceptable level for\n\nthat figure? And are you aiming for the elimination of that\n\ndeficit in that area?\n\nPM: I don't know about the elimination of it, Glen. I\n\nhaven't got and I don't think anyone has got a specific\n\npercentage figure. But I think the real answer to your\n\nquestion is just a brief elaboration of what I said in\n\nanswer to Peter. That is that what we'Ire trying to do, and\n\nwe'll try and do it in cooperation with the states, to get\n\nacceptable guidelines within which we will see an increase\n\nin the value-added process of our forestry industries in\n\nthis country,. I think we are going to be able to reach that\n\nposition where we will be able to make significant in-roads\n\non to those figures. But I haven't got a percentage figure\n\nin my mind.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister there's the perception in the\n\nenvironmentaLl movement that had Graham Richardson retained\n\nthe portfolio then the outcome from their point of view\n\nwould have been much better.\n\nPM: That's very unfair. I had cause in an interview I did\n\non the weekend to address a similar sort of point. There is\n\nno doubt that: Graham Richardson was an outstanding Minister\n\nfor the environment and he was able to get very significant\n\nruns on the board not just for Graham Richardson and not\n\njust for the Government but I think for the future of this\n\ncountry. He is to be congratulated for what he did there.\n\nIt was inevitable that whoever followed in Graham's\n\nfootsteps is going to have a very difficult job. For two\n\nreasons, one, he was by his whole background a very high\n\nprofile personality and Minister from his whole experience\n\nand background. Secondly, because there were decisions with\n\nwhich he was associated. Now I think it's totally unfair to\n\nRos Kelly to say that Graham Richardson or anyone else would\n\nhave done better from the environmental point of view. I\n\ndon't think there is any evidence for that. She was\n\nassiduous both in our Cabinet, and as you can attest Nick,\n\nin the discussions with the NSW Ministers, she was assiduous\n\nin pursuing hier concerns. I think the comparison is unfair,\n\ninvidious and quite unjust to Ros Kelly.\n\nGREINER: Could I just add something relevant to that point.\n\nThe option of a significantly more green outcome is simply\n\nnot an option. It's nonsense to suggest it was. My\n\nGovernment cl. early would not have been part of it. We have\n\nfor 5 or 6 years believed that this was a case where in a\n\nsense you could have your environmental cake and your\n\neconomic cake at the same time. We had clear cut\n\ncommitments that we weren't about to dishonour to the\n\nmaintenance or indeed the creation of a viable industry. So\n\nthere were only two options available in this. There was\n\nthe sort of outcome which has been reached or a continuing\n\nbrawl almost coop by coop. Anything else simply wasn't\n\navailable as an outcome. So it was either a matter of\n\nreaching a resolution, which as I say a fairminded person\n\nwould say was a very fair dinkum attempt to reach a longterm\n\noutcome or settle down for another X years of having fights\n\nin each little bit of forest as it went. So it ought to be\n\nclear that the notion of a \" win\" in the sense of\n\npreservation of all the old-growth forest was never on. I\n\nthink without being unfair to Mr Toyne and other leaders\n\nwho've spoken to me as they have to the Prime Minister about\n\nthis, the responsible leadership of the conservation\n\nmovement never imagined that it was going to get 100%\n\npreservation of old-growth in the South East forests. Nor\n\nto be fair to) the South East Forest Alliance who perhaps are\n\nless responsible. So it just ought to be in context of the\n\nprevious question to the Prime Minister. The notion of a\n\nmuch greener outcome simply wasn't available as a finite or\n\na permanent resolution.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Bob Carr the State Labor leader\n\ndo you think you'll be able to persuade them to support your\n\nposition?\n\nPM: There comes times, as Nick will be able to say from his\n\npoint of view, where you can't always get an identity of\n\nview between the Federal Party and the State Party. You've\n\nexperienced that, Nick, on some issues. I don't want to go\n\nto them. But they'll be clear in people's minds. It's\n\nunfair to go back to them. There are occasions when from\n\nthe perspective of the Federal Party you've got to say well\n\nthis is what we believe is the right outcome. If your State\n\ncounterparts don't share that view well that's unfortunate.\n\nOf course I haven't gone in this with a view to try and\n\ncreate a problem for Mr Carr. I would simply make the same\n\npoint there that I did in regard to Peter's question. I\n\nthink any fair analysis of what's been done should lead to\n\nthe conclusion that both Governments have attempted\n\nresponsibly to take into account their obligations both in\n\nregard to economic development and environmental\n\nresponsibility. JOURNALIST: Will you be holding talks with him on that\n\nsubject PM: I'm sure he'll want to talk with me and I'm more than\n\nhappy to talk with him.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how are you going to handle the East\n\nGippsland dispute and does today's agreement provide some\n\nmodel for settlement down there?\n\nPM: Well the discussions are now to go on in regard to East\n\nGippsland and I don't want to pre-empt those discussions. I\n\nguess they'll be difficult. It may be that there are some\n\nelements of what we've been able to do here that will\n\nprovide guidance, if not a model there. There is a sense in\n\nwhich, as I think you appreciate from the question, that if\n\nyou're looking at the whole resource and environmental\n\nresponsibilities, there is a connection between the South\n\nEast forests and East Gippsland.\n\nJOURNALIST: How much will the industry restructuring\n\npackage cost and how will the cost be split between the two\n\nGovernments? PM: Well the first question is to be answered by saying we\n\ndon't know. The decision that we made today authorises our\n\nMinister, Mr Griffiths, to continue discussions with NSW and\n\nI think in the spirit that's been shown in the discussions\n\nso far between the two Governments that we'll be able to\n\nresolve this in a way which is mutually acceptable.\n\nGREINER: If I can just add to that, Paul. One of the\n\noutcomes of this decision if it's followed through to its\n\nfinality as I imagine it will be is that the private\n\nsector will for the first time in living memory feel free to\n\ninvest in, as the Prime Minister said at the end of his\n\nintroductory remarks, in value-added in that South East\n\narea. In terms of the question that was asked before, I\n\nmean I would see NSW and Victorian forests as part of a\n\nSouth East Australian regional forest area. I mean it's\n\n6.\n\npart of the matter the Prime Minister and I are going to\n\ndiscuss privately after this conference. I mean it is a\n\nnonsense to have a NSW forest industry and a Victorian\n\nforest industry that happens to be on the other side of a\n\nline on the map. It is clearly part of a which doesn't\n\nmean that the outcomes have got to be identical in resolving\n\nthe conflict: but of course it's one region. I think the\n\npoint in terms of restructuring is that there is not a huge\n\nGovernment expense appropriate because what the decision\n\nmeans in terms of resource availability and security means\n\nthat the private sector will be in a position and I'm sure\n\nwill in fact invest in the industry itself. So it's not a\n\nmatter of trying to sort of save the industry, it in fact\n\ngives it the opportunity to develop in a value-added way,\n\nwhich to be fair to the conservationists is what many of\n\nthem argue which is that we ought to get more bang for our\n\nbuck in termis of our natural resources.\n\nJOURNALIST: But have you got a compensation figure? The\n\nindustry were talking about compensation Is there\n\nanything that comes out of this decision\n\nGREINER: I think the Prime Minister's answered that. There\n\nwill be further discussions between the Resource Ministers.\n\nI would not expect the Government compensation to be\n\nsignificant. I think it's in fact an opportunity for the\n\nindustry. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Wilderness Society has already\n\ncondemned this as irresponsible and short sighted. How\n\nconcerned are you about both a threatened withdrawal of\n\ntheir political support and their threatened withdrawal from\n\nthe sustainable development process?\n\nPM: Well two separate questions there. On the question of\n\npolitical support, I will be prepared whenever we go to the\n\nnext election I'm talking federal here, Nick, not state\n\nbut at the next federal election I will be more than happy\n\nto have my record tested against the record of my federal\n\npolitical opponents as well as the policy positions of my\n\nGovernment compared to those of my federal political\n\nopponents. The people in Australia and in the electorate\n\nwho have environmental considerations as their major\n\ncriterion as to how there determinative vote should fall\n\nwill have a clear choice, I believe. And I repeat on that\n\npoint that the record of my Government in 7h years, I think,\n\nis second to none. Now in regard to the second part of your\n\nquestion, I very much hope that the relevant environmental\n\nand conservation organisations will continue to play a role\n\nin the sustainable development program and the Resource\n\nAssessment Commission programs because for two reasons I say\n\nthat. Firstly, that the processes will be the better if\n\nthere is an input to them from all points of view. And\n\nsecondly, fro0m their point of view they are going to\n\nmaximise their chance to have an impact on subsequent\n\ndecision making processes if they have been part of what\n\nleads up to the decision.\n\nJOURNALIST: But just on that point, Mr Hawke, you've both\n\nexpressed today in the extent of the cooperation of cross-\n\nGovernments and also between parties, do you think therefore\n\nthat the environment debate is changing in a way where the\n\ndifferences between the major parties are in fact\n\ndiminishing? PM: Well it's impossible from this particular episode if\n\nI can describe our processes I think it's impossible to\n\ntranslate that into a federal level. I don't know what\n\nposition the federal parties, Federal Liberal Party and\n\nNational Part~ y will take. I mean I've been dealing with a\n\nState Liberal Premier and that's for the future to tell. I\n\nwould say this point more generally, Paul, make this point\n\nmore generally, however, that I think it is the case that\n\nthe relatively easy decisions none of them have been easy\n\nbut the reJlatively easy decisions have been already taken\n\nand now that we've got the Daintree, going back we've got\n\nthe Franklin,. the Daintree, Tasmanian forests, Kakadu, those\n\ndecisions behind us. It's going to become more difficult I\n\nthink to get the balance between environmental and economic\n\nconsiderations right now. That's why precisely I've\n\nattempted over the last couple of years to get in place\n\nprocesses like the Resource Assessment Commission, like the\n\nsustainable development groups, so that we can by attempting\n\nto attract a range of interests the developers, if I can\n\nput that broadly, environmentalists and the States if we\n\ncan get these processes going with input from all concerned\n\nthen conceptually while the decisions are going to be\n\nsomewhat harder, we will have got processes in place which\n\nshould mean a minimisation of political differences because\n\nI would hope that if the processes that I've established\n\nwith my colleagues work then at the end of them people are\n\ngoing to be able to say, well look, there's a very, very\n\nfair process, a very fair opportunity for people to have\n\ntheir input and then the recommendations for decisions that\n\ncome out of -that, it seems to me should be more broadly\n\nacceptable. I hope that's true.\n\nJOURNALIST: Well just on that point though, if in fact it's\n\ngoing to be more of a process of dialogue, compromise\n\nwould you expect the conservation movement to reassess then\n\nand stop seeking the product of 100% solutions, which it's\n\nbeen interested in to this stage?\n\nPM: To be fair I don't know, I think there was something\n\nthat Nick said would also support this. To be fair to the\n\nenvironment it's not inhabited by total 100% zealots, if I\n\ncan say that, who are all of them against development. I\n\nmean it's a varied movement.\n\nJOURNALIST: Well would you want to see some reassessment on\n\nthe part of the conservation movement then towards this sort\n\nof process you're talking about?\n\nPM: Well I would want to I would hope, Paul, that they\n\nwill fully involve themselves in the processes. To this\n\npoint they are in the RAC processes, they are, I think,\n\ngoing to commit themselves although not all of them but\n\nI think a significant part of them are going to commit\n\nthemselves to the sustainable development processes. I\n\nwould hope they all would for the reason I said before.\n\nThey're not going to help their own case, it seems to me, if\n\nthey refuse to participate in those processes.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you've stressed the importance of\n\nvalue added exports, do you foresee the phasing down of\n\nexports of raw woodchips and what implications, if any,\n\nwould that have for the operations of Harris Daishowa?\n\nPM: There's nothing new about what I say here. We have\n\nmade it clear and in fact it's part of the lease\n\narrangements with Harris Daishowa that we require them to\n\nput forward proposals for further value-added operations in\n\nthis country. What you've got to remember about this area\n\nthat we're talking about is that we're not making these\n\ndecisions for the woodchippers. Woodchipping is a residual\n\nof the sawlogging industry. There will be some attempt by\n\nthose who are not too interested in facts to say that what\n\nHawke and Greiner have done is to just open up the forest to\n\nbe cut down for woodchips to be sent away to Japan.\n\nWoodchipping is a residual to the sawlogging industry and in\n\nregard to woodchipping in general and Harris Daishowa in\n\nparticular, we will, as I've said in my opening statement,\n\nbe pressing for further value-adding by those who are in\n\nthat industry.\n\nJOURNALIST: Does that include the new pulp and paper\n\nmill that's been this decision?\n\nPM: Well the question about the large new pulp and paper\n\nmill is something that is for the future. Obviously it's\n\nnot going to be unrelated to the discussions in regard to\n\nEast Gippsland. Because as I've said and as Nick has\n\nagreed, if you're going to be looking at this whole issue\n\nand this whole industry, the line on the map is very\n\nartificial. JOURNALIST: Would you support..\n\nPM: I support the processes of investigating projects which\n\nwill take account of our economic requirements and our\n\nenvironmental responsibilities. We have established the\n\nprocesses for trying to get guidelines for such mills, which\n\nis indicative of the fact that we conceptually see that\n\nthere's a pl. ace for them.\n\nJOURNALIST: structures in place to resolve these sorts\n\nof conflicts Was it not possible to wait until RAC\n\nreported on forests\n\nPM: We made it quite clear at the establishment of RAC and\n\nmay I say a] lso of the establishment of the sustainable\n\ndevelopment processes that that would not involve a\n\nmoratorium on decisions that had to be taken. That was\n\nunderstood I believe by everyone at the time that these\n\nprocesses wer: e established.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just on another matter. Did\n\nyou on September 13 either deliberately or inadvertently\n\nmislead the House in regard to the monies going to the\n\nVictorian Sporting\n\nPM: I've never attempted deliberately, I've never in my\n\nlife attempted deliberately to mislead anyone, whether it's\n\nthe House or elsewhere. However, as a result of the\n\nstatement I dlid make there was certainly some confusion. I\n\nacknowledge that and I will take the first opportunity,\n\nwhich will be tomorrow in the House, to clarify that\n\nposition. JOURNALIST: Can we get your reaction to the ANZ job\n\nstatistics today Prime Minister?\n\nPM: I'll just briefly say that they are further evidence of\n\nthe fact that our intention of slowing down the economy,\n\nwhich was necessary, is occurring. We will continue to\n\nmonitor what's happening with a view to ensuring that we\n\nhave an outcome which is going to be consistent with our\n\nrequirements for growth and meeting the challenges of the\n\nexternal account and inflation.\n\nJOURNALIST: Would you support an inquiry into the newspaper\n\nindustry?\n\nPM: I didn't get terribly carried away about that before.\n\nIt seems to be getting people are attempting to get some\n\nmore legs on that because there has been a collapsing of\n\nfour publications into two. I don't think the collapsing of\n\nfour publications into two has made any intrinsic difference\n\nto the situation that's been in existence for some time now.\n\nI don't see that of itself as creating any new reason for\n\nsuch an inquiLry.\n\nJOURNALIST: On the previous question Mr Hawke, do you\n\naccept that you inadvertently misled the House over those\n\nPM: There was some inadvertent, on my part there was an\n\ninadvertent mnis-stating of the position. But I stated the\n\ncorrect position and an incorrect position. I of course\n\nwould never iLntend to do that. I think you know now\n\nMichelle, from 7h years I haven't got a reputation, and\n\ndeservedly haven't got a reputation for misleading the\n\nHouse. It is something I would never\n\nJOURNALIST: Can you just clarify how\n\nPM: I will clarify it to the House tomorrow. It will be\n\nthe first opportunity I will have had because I went off to\n\nJapan in the next week and I wasn't in the House. But I'll\n\ntake the first\n\nJOURNALIST: Can you sort it out now for us.\n\nPM: I think it's appropriate that as it occurred in the\n\nHouse I will do it then.\n\nJOURNALIST: Will you apologise to Senator Walsh?\n\nPM: Will I what?\n\nJOURNALIST: Do you feel you have anything to apologise to\n\nSenator Walsh for?\n\nPM: I have -very little to apologise to Senator Walsh for.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the part of the rural sector, if I\n\ncan, both wool growers and wheat growers are desperate to\n\nget a reduction in interest rates for their survival. Are\n\nthey likely -to get that?\n\nPM: I think I can answer that in this way. I said to the\n\nAustralian people, as did Paul, during last year when we had\n\nto tighten monetary policy, I said that we would, as\n\ncircumstances permitted, lower interest rates. We have at\n\nthe official level done that on several occasions already\n\nthis year by four percentage points. So clearly our\n\ncommitment i~ s to have a lowered interest rate regime but\n\nonly at a time where in the interests of the people that you\n\nare talking about as well as the interests of the people as\n\na whole such a lowering will be consistent with overall\n\ncommunity objectives. I mean you just can't say in running\n\nan economy like this, oh, interest rates are causing a\n\nproblem therefore we'll chop them in the belief that in\n\ndoing that you wouldn't create another series of problems\n\nwhich could ' be even more overwhelming. We will reduce\n\ninterest rates as to do so is consistent with our overall\n\neconomic responsibilities.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you have said that there won't be an\n\ninquiry into newspapers in Australia but do you see any need\n\nto fine tune your media policies, especially in relation to\n\nforeign ownership of TV and newspapers?\n\nPM: No, I would've made decisions about that recently. I\n\ndon't feel any compulsion about that.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the present political crisis in the\n\nUnited States, could you tell us what sort of impact you\n\nexpect that to have on the Australian economy. Is it likely\n\nto PM: We hope it's a very short-term one. I would believe\n\nfrom afar that the Administration and the Congress will sort\n\nthis one out. It's going to be a bit messy for a while by\n\nthe look of it. It's going to cause some pain.
