        "text": "SYDNEY: Former NSW premier Nick\n\nGreiner and Sydney mayoral candidate\n\nKathryn Greiner yesterday announced\n\ntheir plans for a trial separation.\n\n\"Nick and Kathryn Greiner announce\n\nthat after long and careful consideration,\n\nNick has chosen to leave the marriage and\n\nthere will be a trial separation,\" a state\n\nment issued by the Greiners' representa-\n\ntive, Ken Hooper, said.\n\n\"Both Nick and Kathryn recognise the\n\nimpact the decision will have on their\n\nchildren, family and friends and would ask\n\nat this time that the media respect their\n\nprivacy,\" the statement continued.\n\nMr Hooper, a long-time adviser and\n\nfriend to the Greiners, said the separation\n\nwas unfortunate.\n\nActing as a spokesman for Mrs Greiner,\n\nMr Hooper said \"although Kathryn is dev-\n\nastated by Nick's decision to start a new\n\nlife, she respects his right to that decision.\n\n\"Her primary concern is of course for\n\nher children but, with their support and\n\nunderstanding, she will continue with her\n\ngoal to be Sydney's next lord mayor.\"\n\nMr Greiner and Kathryn Callaghan,\n\ndaughter of former Commonwealth Bank\n\ning Corporation managing director Sir\n\nBede Callaghan, married in 1970. They\n\nhave two children, Justin, 22, and Kara, 20.\n\nMrs Greiner is now launching a concert\n\ned effort to win office as Sydney's lord\n\nmayor in a high-profile campaign.\n\nMr Greiner resigned as premier on June\n\n24, 1992 over the so-called Metherell affair,\n\nwhen former Cabinet minister Terry Meth-\n\nerell was given a government job.\n\nThe Independent Commission Against\n\nCorruption, established by Mr Greiner,\n\ndeemed his actions in the affair to be cor-\n\nrupt but he was later cleared of any wrong\n\ndoing by the Supreme Court.\n\nLate last year he was chairman of four\n\ncompanies, deputy chairman of a fifth and\n\ndirector of nine other organisations includ-\n\ning SOCOG, Coles Myer, QBE Insurance\n\nand Defiance Mills."
