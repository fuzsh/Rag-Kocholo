Unlike traditional books of this type, however, it takes an expanded view of the term literary. One cause of this expansion is the new way of talking about and teaching literature that has emerged since the late 1960s under the general heading of “theory.” Theory often deals with subjects that seem at best only peripherally related to what we think of as literature, but some of its insights have provided us with new tools to understand the processes of reading, writing, interpreting, and (alas, to a relatively insignificant extent) enjoying literature. This book provides discussions of the major terms begotten by theory, always with the goal of relating them to literary study. Another form of expansion is reflected in the title word thematic. This is the first book of literary terms to include within it discussions of major literary themes, such as death, love, and time, and also of themes that have a particular significance for our age, such as AIDS, alienation, and anti-Semitism. Still another expansion of “literature” is its extension to include film, television, and other forms of popular culture, thus the appearance of terms such as macguffin, sitcom, and rap. These updatings and innovations, however, should not obscure the fact that most of the entries in this book have been in existence for centuries, some of them— those relating to Aristotle—as old as 2,500 years. Like other living things, the literary tradition continues to evolve and expand, enriching the lives of all those lucky enough to come to know it. To that end, this book offers itself as a modest guide. The subtitle of this new edition might well be labeled, “From Academic Discourse to Zines” since these are the first and last new entries in the book. However, while these two appropriately suggest the ever expanding range of what constitutes “literary” terms, they also indicate the somewhat shifting, deceptive nature of these terms. At first glance, academic discourse appears to be a rusty relic of an ivory-towered past, while zines seems to embody the essence of a computergenerated future. But as the entries themselves indicate, academic discourse has recently become a hotly “contested site,” while the zines phenomenon is more than v\n\nPREFACE\n\n75 years old. This is a sobering reminder, as another new entry, liberal/conservative imagination, demonstrates in the political sphere, that the old trickster time never tires of keeping us off balance. Time also offers a convenient device to categorize the thematic entries new to this edition, which include traditional, rooted-in-thepast entries such as individualism, skepticism, Odysseus/Ulysses; timely presentoriented themes such as nuclear war, terrorism and prison literature, and those subjects that slip through the chronological cracks, like alcohol, baseball, and vampirism. Among new entries that bespeak the future are those dedicated to the various ethnic American literatures, many of which are just beginning to find their voices, but which, we can safely assume, will grow in importance and recognition as our country continues the great experiment of seeking renewal through immigration. My thanks to Gail Quinn for typing this manuscript under combat conditions and Deirdre Quinn for pitching in at a critical point. Thanks again to Karl Malkoff, this time for offering his slow-witted friend a crash course in Computers 101. Continued thanks to Jeff Soloway of Facts On File for his patience, encouragement, and sound advice. Thanks also to Liam and Adam Kirby, Caitlin, Kieran and Declan, Maya, and Shannon Quinn for being the grandest of grandchildren. Finally, a special debt to Barbara Gleason, whose patience, tact, and support kept the ship afloat even after it had sprung a few leaks.\n\nvi\n\nååå\n\na\n\nå\n\nAbbey Theatre The Dublin home of the Irish National Theatre Company,\n\nwhere some of the most celebrated plays of the 20th century first appeared. On its opening night, December 26, 1904, the Abbey presented four short plays: William Butler Yeats’s Cathleen Ni Houlihan and On Baile’s Strand, Lady Augusta Gregory’s Spreading the News, and John Millington Synge’s In the Shadow of the Glen. This premiere set a standard that the company was to maintain for the next two decades. The company presented Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World (greeted by rioters protesting the play as “a libel of the Irish character”) in 1907 and his powerful tragedy Deirdre of the Sorrows in 1910. The twenties saw the presentation of Sean O’Casey’s great tragicomic achievements: The Shadow of a Gunman (1923), Juno and the Paycock (1924), and The Plough and the Stars (1926), the latter causing another riot at the theater. Although never matching the great achievements of its early years, the Abbey, which burned down in 1951 and reopened in 1966, continues to produce plays and players of unusually high quality, maintaining its status as one of the premier theaters in Europe. Hugh Hunt’s The Abbey: Ireland’s National Theatre, 1904–1978 (1979) offers a historical overview of the Abbey’s productions, politics and personalities. Adrian Frazier’s Behind the Scenes (1990) is a witty and provocative reading of the Abbey’s early years viewed from the perspective of NEW HISTORICISM. Absolute, the\n\nIn philosophy, the principle of fundamental reality that underlines and sustains the various forms it assumes in the world. Although the idea of an unconditioned Absolute is as old as Plato, the term is associated with 19thcentury German idealist philosophy, most notably in the work of G. W. F. Hegel. Hegel maintained “the Absolute is spirit; this is the highest definition of the absolute.” For Hegel, the role of great art—for example, Greek tragedy—was to provide the average person with an approach to the Absolute that was more accessible than philosophy. 1\n\nABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge adopted this principle in developing his theory of literature, a theory in which NATURE appears as the Absolute. Coleridge’s conception assumed a dominant place in 19th-century literary theory. Among reactions in the early years of the 20th century to Coleridge’s ROMANTICISM, the movement known as the NEW HUMANISM, led by the scholars Irving Babbitt and Paul Elmer More, called for a rejection of transcendental, idealist terms, of which the Coleridgean Absolute was a major example. Jacques Derrida, the principal exponent of DECONSTRUCTION, criticized Western thought for operating on the basis of LOGOCENTRISM, the belief that there exists an Absolute, a “logos” that transcends the limitations of language. The scholar Robert Calasso used the term absolute literature to describe writings that reveal a search for an absolute. (See also GODS.) Paul Elmer More’s The Demon of the Absolute (1928) constitutes a strong indictment of the Absolute; Robert Harland’s Superstructuralism (1987) provides a thoughtful analysis of Derrida’s argument. Robert Calasso’s study is Literature and the Gods (2001). abstract expressionism See ACTION PAINTING. absurd Ridiculous or unreasonable, a definition that has been extended to characterize human life. In the 20th-century philosophy of EXISTENTIALISM, the French writer Albert Camus employed the term to describe the futility of human existence, which he compared to the story of Sisyphus, the figure in Greek mythology condemned for eternity to push a stone to the top of a mountain only to have it roll back down again. In the wake of two world wars, the principle of absurdity found fertile soil in the imaginations of modern writers. An early example is the fiction of Franz Kafka, peopled with guilt-ridden, alienated, grotesquely comic characters. In the 1950s a group of playwrights created a new form of drama, which the critic Martin Esslin named “the theatre of the absurd,” to describe plays that abandoned traditional construction and conventional dialogue. These plays were notable for their illogical structure and the irrational behavior of their characters. Chief among the absurdist playwrights was Samuel Beckett, whose Waiting for Godot (1953) and Endgame (1957) had a revolutionary impact on modern drama. In Waiting for Godot, two tramps wait for Godot, who sends a message every day that he will meet them tomorrow. They pass the time engaging in comic stage business, trying to remember where they are and how they got there—as one character puts it, “Anything to give us the illusion we exist.” The second act repeats the first with slight variations; Godot never arrives, and the two tramps continue to wait. 2\n\nACADEMIC DISCOURSE\n\nOther “absurdists” include Eugene Ionesco (Rhinoceros, 1960) and Arthur Adamov (Ping Pong, 1955) in France, Harold Pinter (The Caretaker, 1959) in England, and Edward Albee (The American Dream, 1961) in the United States. In FICTION, two of the best known novels of the 1950s and ’60s, Joseph Heller’s Catch-22 (1961) and Gunther Grass’s The Tin Drum (1959), captured the absurdist theme and style. Albert Camus’s The Myth of Sisyphus (1955) is an extended treatment of the absurd applied to human existence. Martin Esslin’s The Theatre of the Absurd (1961) is a landmark study of its subject; its third edition (1980) includes the author’s reservations about the popularization of the term. academic discourse A general term for the written language used by college and university faculty members. Some academics hold that the term should be plural, reflecting the range and variety of linguistic conventions that separate, for example, writing in psychology from that in art history. But despite wide differences in vocabulary and style, there are some agreed-upon features common to most academic prose, notably professional terminology (see JARGON) and rather strict criteria in determining the proof of an argument. In other words, academic discourse traditionally tends to subordinate rhetoric to logic, maintaining the appeal to reason as the highest standard of discursive language use. Occasionally that standard is questioned or challenged by the scholars themselves. One example concerns the Shakespearean scholar Stephen Greenblatt, an exemplary practitioner of academic discourse in the books and articles he has written in connection with NEW HISTORICISM. In 2004, Greenblatt published a popular biography of Shakespeare (Will in the World), in which he speculates about his subject, not only rather loosely by academic standards, but substantially contradicting the thrust of his earlier works on Shakespeare’s plays, producing a generally negative reaction among his academic peers. On the other hand, nonacademic reviewers and general readers have responded very positively to the biography, applauding the author for having “liberated Shakespeare from the professors and returning him to the people.” The controversy illustrates the differences generated by different discourses, and the perils of attempting a crossover from one to the other. In COMPOSITION STUDIES, academic discourse serves as a reminder of the gap between the expectations of the traditional college teacher and the student. The latter, particularly in a BASIC WRITING course, frequently feels overwhelmed by the attempt to mimic or imitate academic discourse in a writing assignment. The effort to sound “academic” usually results in a greater failure than had the student used his/her own “voice.” One consequence has been a growing pedagogical interest in the WRITING ACROSS THE CURRICULUM movement in an attempt to 3\n\nACADEMIC FICTION\n\nintroduce beginning writers to the forms and conventions of the major academic disciplines. Marjorie Garber looks at the pros and cons of academic discourse in her Academic Instincts (2001). academic fiction See CAMPUS NOVEL. Académie française Powerful French academy founded in 1635 by Cardinal\n\nRichelieu, chief minister during King Louis XIII’s reign, and still a force in contemporary French culture. The Académie continues to exercise its authority, overseeing and attempting to control developments in the language. Its most recent efforts, a measure of its linguistic conservatism, have been directed against the employment of loan words from other languages. The group also bestows various awards and prizes for distinguished literary achievements. The Académie consists of 40 members, all prominent intellectuals and formerly all-male until 1980, when the novelist Marguerite Yourcenar was elected its first female member. Academy An olive grove near Athens where Plato and his followers established a school (called the Academy) for the study of philosophy. Academy or academe are general terms for the university or the academic community. The name is alluded to in a line from the Roman poet Ovid, “And pursue truth in the groves of academe,” which serves as the ironic epigraph to Mary McCarthy’s satiric CAMPUS NOVEL The Groves of Academe (1952). Academy Awards Annual awards given by the American Academy of Motion\n\nPicture Arts and Sciences. The symbol of the award is an “Oscar” (the origin of the name is disputed), a gold-plated statuette of a sword-bearing knight standing on rolls of film. The awards cover 23 categories of filmmaking, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Foreign Language Film, four acting awards (Best Leading Actor and Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Actress), two writing awards (Best Original Screenplay, Best Adaptation), two music awards (Best Song, Best Original Score), two short films awards (Best Animated Film, Best Live), two documentaries (Best Feature, Best Short Subject), and awards for art direction, cinematography, costume, design, editing, sound, sound effects, visual effects, and makeup. The awards ceremony, usually occurring in March of the year following the films’ original showing, is the world’s most widely viewed television event. Though almost always seen in retrospect as disappointing and overly long, the ceremony 4\n\nACTION\n\nnever fails to attract a large audience, lured by its potpourri of glamour, humor, and suspense. Despite their popularity, the awards have been frequently criticized for the voters’ tendency to select personal favorites and blockbuster films rather than making quality judgments. The blockbuster preference is presumably related to the belief that the success of such films is always “good for the industry.” Critics cite as evidence the fact that the two winners of the largest number of awards— 11 each—were for two epical films, Ben-Hur (1959) and Titanic (2001). Emanuel Levy’s Oscar Fever (2001) offers a serious, intelligent history of the awards. accent A regular recurring stress in a line of verse. In poetry written in English, the order and number of accented syllables determine the METER of a line or an entire poem. For example, if the order of stress is an unaccented syllable followed by an accented one, the two syllables constitute an iambic FOOT. A line containing five such feet is in iambic pentameter, as in this line from Alexander Pope: ‚ ˘ ‚ ˘ ‚ ˘ ‚ ˘ ‚ ˘ proper The study of mankind is man. acrostic A poem in which the first letter in each line spells out a word. A well-known example is the notoriously sentimental MOTHER acrostic. The form’s low repute as a literary device is reflected in John Dryden’s satiric poem “MacFlecknoe” (1682), in which he advises his hapless adversary to:\n\nLeave writing plays, and choose for thy command Some peaceful province in Acrostic land. There thou mayest wings display and altars raise, And torture one poor word ten thousand ways. act The major division of a DRAMA. The ELIZABETHAN five-act structure\n\nderives from the Roman playwright Seneca. Modern drama allows for considerable variation in the number of acts within a play, although the majority of contemporary plays are written in two acts. Many plays have adapted the EPIC THEATER structure of Bertolt Brecht, which substitutes a series of episodes, or self-contained incidents, for the act structure. action The sequence of events in a novel or play. Aristotle’s definition of tragedy\n\nas “an imitation of an action” underscores his contention that action rather than character is the central element in a tragic play. What he seems to emphasize is not simply what the characters do but also what underlies their specific acts. The tragic 5\n\nACTION PAINTING\n\naction, for example, appears to be a threefold movement, characterized by the critic Kenneth Burke as the “purpose, passion and perception” of the tragic protagonist: the tragic hero begins with a specific purpose, undergoes a trial by suffering (passion), and emerges with a fuller, although tragic, sense of his own identity (perception).The idea of speech as a form of action is a major principle of SPEECH ACT THEORY. Kenneth Burke analyzes the tragic rhythm of action in his A Grammar of Motives (1945). action painting A term coined by the critic Harold Rosenberg to describe a central principle of the Abstract Expressionist art movement that developed in the 1940s and ’50s. The goal of action painting was to capture the act of creating the painting: the painting itself was to be seen simply as the representation of the act of producing it. Jackson Pollock’s technique of dripping paint as he walked over his canvas is a prime example of action painting. Such painting is “expressionist” in that it is an expression of the artist in action. It is “abstract” in that it represents not a picture of the world but something that comes into existence in the act of making it. The emphasis in action painting is not on the eye but on the hand. The movement of the line within the painting involves its viewers, inviting them to become part of the process of creation. The principle of action painting was incorporated into the work of the NEW YORK SCHOOL of poetry. One member of the school, Frank O’Hara, a museum curator and friend of many abstract expressionist painters, described the appeal of the new art movement: “Poetry was declining/Painting advancing/We were complaining/it was ’50.” The influence of action painting on the New York School is evident in O’Hara’s attempt to present directly the poet in the process of composing. Harold Rosenberg’s essays are collected in his Act and the Actor (1970). Jerome Klinkowitz has studied the impact of action painting on subsequent artistic, literary, and critical movements in Rosenberg/Barthes/Hassan (1988). actor-manager The designation for a leading actor who is also the manager of\n\na theater or repertory troupe. In the French theater the tradition was established by Molière, who in addition to acting and managing his troupe, was also its chief playwright. In the English and American theater, the tradition of the actor who also served as director and producer was dominant from the end of the 17th century to the beginning of the 20th. Among the most celebrated actor-managers were David Garrick in the 18th century, Henry Irving and, in America, Edwin Booth in the 19th. Among fictional actor-managers, the genial Mr. Crummles, in Charles Dickens’s Nicholas Nickleby (1839) is memorable. 6\n\nADULTERY\n\nA moving homage to the actor-manager tradition is captured in the play, and later film, The Dresser (1981), which skillfully depicts the relationship of the actor-manager and his dresser as paralleling that of King Lear and his Fool. Actors’ Studio See METHOD ACTING. adage See PROVERB. adaptation The employment of material in one medium or genre for use in\n\nanother as, for example, when a novel is made into a film. Many of Shakespeare’s plays are adaptations of prose narratives, and those plays have become in turn the SOURCE of countless novels, poems, films, operas, and ballets. Adaptation is one form of the practice contemporary theorists refer to as INTERTEXTUALITY. adultery One of the major themes in the history of literature, a recurrent\n\nfeature of TRAGEDY, COMEDY, ROMANCE, and the NOVEL. Marriage and the family have constituted the linchpin of the social order, guaranteeing society’s survival and continuity. In this context adultery may have served a dual and contradictory role: both as threat to society and as safety valve, an outlet for the oppressive features of marriage. The literature of adultery reflects this ambivalence from the beginning. In Homer’s Iliad, the adulterous relation of Paris and Helen is the catastrophic cause of the Trojan War, while the New Testament account of the woman taken in adultery, with Jesus’ injunction that punishment of the woman belongs only to “he who is without sin,” underscores the ubiquity of the sin along with the need for compassion. Medieval romances, such as those surrounding the ARTHURIAN LEGEND or the story of Tristan and Iseult, often emphasize the destructive nature of adulterous passion. In medieval and Renaissance comedy, particularly FARCE, the emphasis frequently falls on cuckoldry, usually with the suggestion of adultery as a form of justified revenge; Machiavelli’s Mandragola (1518) is a representative example. Shakespeare offers a distinctive variation on the tradition, focusing on imagined cuckoldry, a theme that forms the basis not only of such farces as The Merry Wives of Windsor and romances like The Winter’s Tale but also, most memorably, the tragic action of Othello. According to the critic Tony Tanner, adultery was a particularly fertile theme for the 19th-century novel, providing the opportunity to explore the instability of marriage at the historical moment when marriage was beginning to be seen in conflict with the desire for individual freedom. Undoubtedly this development was also intensely connected to the changing definitions of the nature and roles of women. In novels such as Flaubert’s Madame Bovary (1856–57), Tolstoy’s Anna 7\n\nADVENTURE STORY\n\nKarenina (1875–77) and Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter (1850), the centrality of the woman and the complexity of her role anticipate this shift in mood. Although the heroines of all three of these novels commit adultery and are punished as social outcasts, they also achieve an authentic sense of self from the adulterous experience and the suffering that follows it. Among 20th-century novelists, John Updike is noted for his concentration on the theme. Updike’s approach is distinguished by his representation of adultery as a spiritual transgression instead of a social threat. In focusing on this spiritual or religious dimension, he follows his progenitor, Nathaniel Hawthorne. The Scarlet Letter, in fact, forms the basis of three novels by Updike (A Month of Sundays, 1975; Roger’s Version, 1986; and S, 1988) in which the perspectives of the three main characters of the Hawthorne novel (Arthur Dimmesdale, Roger Chillingworth, and Hester Prynne) are recreated in contemporary terms. The influence of the “myth of adultery” is traced in Denis de Rougemont’s Love in the WesternWorld (1940). Tony Tanner’s Adultery in the Novel (1979) examines the theme in key 19th-century European novels. Donald Greiner’s Adultery in the American Novel (1985) looks at the uses of the theme in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, and John Updike. adventure story A type of fiction that usually includes suspense, excitement,\n\nphysical danger, travel to exotic settings, and an intrepid hero/heroine. In many of these respects, the adventure story is kin to the ROMANCE, but the adventure story relies on a series of exciting episodes unified by the theme of a search for a lost person, place, or object. The prototype of the form is Homer’s Odyssey, in which the hero faces a series of threatening situations as he attempts to voyage home. The adventure story is one of the staples of CHILDREN’S LITERATURE, such as Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island (1883). In film, the form is a key element of the SERIAL. advertising Although the history of advertising dates back to classical times, it\n\ndid not emerge as a powerful force in society until the industrial age in the 19th century. Literature and advertising share a common purpose, to have its audiences engage in the WILLING SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. However, where literary work asks you merely to accept the temporary illusion that its characters are real and its events really happening, the advertisement asks you to carry its illusion into the real world by buying its product or electing its candidate. In Advertising Fictions (1988), Jennifer Wickes looks at the relationship of advertising and literature through the lenses of three writers, Charles Dickens, Henry James, and James Joyce, whose novels, she suggests, represent three stages 8\n\nAESTHETICISM\n\nin the interaction of advertising and literature: advertising’s borrowing from literature, its emergence as a perceived threat, and its ultimate triumph. She begins with a seminal example, a jingle written on a bottle of shoe polish , made by the Warren factory in London, as “one of the first examples of an individually packaged product with a textual accompaniment.” When Charles Dickens was forced to work as a child, he was employed at Warren’s, pasting those labels on bottles. As a young man, Dickens later wrote advertising copy for Warren’s. Thus, at an early age he became conscious of advertising’s power, assigning it a significant role in his novels and employing it in their sales campaigns. In The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), for example, the shop, which deals with relics of a dead past, is itself a relic, symbolized by the fact that it has no sign advertising itself. Little Nell, the novel’s heroine, moves from the shop to become a model, used to advertise Mrs. Jarley’s waxworks museum. The author’s attitude toward advertising is evident in the name he gives the advertising copywriter, Slum. But Dickens’s own reliance on advertising is evident in his use of it in his financially successful reading tours in which the texts of his novels become the advertisements for his readings. To illustrate the second phase when advertising emerges as a formidable threat to literature, Wickes sees Henry James as an author sensitive to the impending “usurpation and displacement of literature that loomed on the horizon.” A specific example of that threat is the figure in James’s The Ambassadors (1903) of Chad Newsome, whose idyll in Europe must end. He is being called back to America to assume a critical role in the family business by becoming the head of the advertising department. Chad readily abandons his lover for the lure of advertising, which he describes as “an art. . . and infinite like all the arts. . . in the hands, naturally, of a master.” The third stage of interaction, Wickes maintains, finds a reversal of the earlier relationship. Now literature borrows the language of advertising in the vocabulary and thought of one of the 20th century’s most celebrated characters, Leopold Bloom, the central figure of James Joyce’s Ulysses (1922). Bloom is an advertising canvasser, soliciting ads for local newspapers. In the process, he has absorbed the language and slogans of advertising, of which, as his INTERIOR MONOLOGUE reveals, he is a walking repository. As a result, according to Wickes, the novel “performs a tango with advertising and is set to its music.” Wickes’s point is a striking one, but for many readers, the notion that the language of advertising dominates the rich linguistic tapestry that is Ulysses would seem to be overstating the case. Closer to the truth is her general proposition: Advertising’s rise to power has been accompanied by a comparable decline in the influence of literature. aestheticism In French and English literature, a 19th-century movement\n\nthat maintained art need serve no moral or ethical purpose (see ART FOR ART’S 9\n\nAESTHETICS\n\nSAKE). In the preface to his novel Mademoiselle de Maupin (1838), the French poet and novelist Thèophile Gautier proclaimed the only purpose of art was to be beautiful. The French SYMBOLIST poets attempted to translate that principle into practice. In England the major texts of the aesthetic movement were Swinburne’s Poems and Ballads (1866) and Walter Pater’s Studies in the History of the Renaissance (1873), which concludes with the famous invitation to “burn with a hard gemlike flame” in the “desire for beauty, the love of art for its own sake.” The bestknown advocate of aestheticism was Oscar Wilde, who at the end of his life lamented in De Profundis (1905), “I treated art as the supreme reality and life as a mere mode of fiction.” FORMALISM represents a modified, less extreme form of aestheticism.\n\nR. V. Johnson’s Aestheticism (1969) is an accessible treatment of the movement. aesthetics A branch of philosophy that explores the theory of the beautiful and the nature of art. As a separate field of study, it did not begin until the mid-18th century, but the questions it deals with date back at least to Plato and Aristotle. Among these questions are those relating to art as imitation, or MIMESIS, to the function of the artist in society, and to the impact of art on its audience. The term aesthetic distance refers either to the artist’s or the audience’s relation to the art object. A satirical novelist such as Evelyn Waugh, for example, appears to be more removed from his characters and their fate than a romantic novelist such as Sir Walter Scott. NEW CRITICISM emphasized the need for a certain detachment in order to understand without being swept away by the tide of emotion. A similar principle is implicit in Bertolt Brecht’s ALIENATION EFFECT and in the concept of DEFAMILIARIZATION.\n\naffective fallacy A term in NEW CRITICISM used to describe the error, from a\n\nNew Critical perspective, of analyzing a work of literature in terms of its impact upon a reader. The critics William Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley coined the term to call attention to the distinction between the text of a work and “its results in the mind of its audience.” For Wimsatt and Beardsley, any attempt to locate the meaning of a work within the mind of the reader “ends in impressionism and relativism.” A corollary fallacy, according to the same authors, the so-called INTENTIONAL FALLACY, lies in any attempt to see the meaning of a work as residing in the intention of the AUTHOR. For the New Critics, true meaning resided in “the text itself,” the language of the poem or story. 10\n\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN LITERATURE\n\nOne of the principal developments of a more recent critical school, READER RESPONSE CRITICISM, in the words of Jane Tompkins, “defines itself in direct opposition to the New Critical dictum issued by Wimsatt and Beardsley.” “The Affective Fallacy” is included in Wimsatt’s The Verbal Icon (1954); Jane Tompkins’s critique is featured in her critical anthology Reader Response Criticism (1980). African-American literature Long overlooked, the rich tradition of oral and written African-American literature had its beginnings in the songs, spirituals, and folktales of slaves working in the fields. By the late 18th century, a few slaves and former slaves, given the opportunity to read and write (an opportunity denied by law in many Southern states), published poetry. Notable among these were Jupiter Hammon and Phillis Wheatley, both slaves whose poems reflect a strong religious tone. In the early years of the 19th century a number of slaves, aided and encouraged by abolitionists, published autobiographical accounts of their experiences as slaves. These SLAVE NARRATIVES played a significant role in the anti-slavery movement that preceded the Civil War. In 1859, Harriet Wilson’s Our Nig; or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black was the first novel by an AfricanAmerican writer to be published in the United States. In the years following the Civil War, African-American literature began to reflect the frustrations and fears of a people who in large part continued to suffer from widespread discrimination and segregation. The poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar and the prose of Charles Chesnutt touch upon these themes, as do autobiographical works such as Booker T. Washington’s Up from Slavery (1901) and James Weldon Johnson’s novel The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (1912). In the 1920s, the vast migration from the rural South to the urban North in the years leading up to and following World War I resulted in the HARLEM RENAISSANCE, the term for the period of outstanding literary activity centered in the Harlem section of New York City. During this period, Harlem served as a magnet for talented young black artists, writers, and musicians. Among the most memorable are the poets Langston Hughes (The Weary Blues, 1926), and Countee Cullen (The Black Christ, 1929), and the novelists Jean Toomer (Cane, 1923), Claude McKay (Home to Harlem, 1928), Arna Bontemps (God Sends Sunday, 1931), and Zora Neale Hurston (Their Eyes Were Watching God, 1937). Another distinguishing feature of these writers was their incorporation of the rhythms and themes of blues and JAZZ. In the period preceding the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, AfricanAmerican literature was dominated by three novelists: Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, and James Baldwin. Wright’s Native Son (1940), Ellison’s The Invisible Man (1952), and Baldwin’s Go Tell It on the Mountain (1953) matched passion 11\n\nAGE OF JOHNSON\n\nwith eloquence and literary skill in their depictions of the African-American experience. In the wake of the Civil Rights movement a new generation of writers emerged, establishing in unequivocal fashion the centrality of the African-American experience in the consciousness of all Americans. In the hands of writers such as Maya Angelou (I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, 1969), Ishmael Reed (Mumbo Jumbo, 1972), Alice Walker (The Color Purple, 1982), the playwright August Wilson (Fences, 1987), and the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison (Beloved, 1987), African-American literature has moved out of the ghetto onto the national stage. The Norton Anthology of African American Literature, edited by William L. Andrews et al., and The Oxford Companion to African American Literature, edited by Henry Louis Gates and Nellie Y. McKay (both 1997), provide comprehensive introductions to the African-American literary tradition. Age of Johnson In English literary history, the second half of the 18th cen-\n\ntury, a period dominated by the poet, critic, editor, and lexicographer Dr. Samuel Johnson. Traditionally regarded as a merely transitional phase in the movement from NEOCLASSICISM to ROMANTICISM, the age now commands more respect for a unique literary character of its own. The critic Northrop Frye has argued that a more accurate title for the period would be the Age of Sensibility, to emphasize that the poetry of Robert Burns, Thomas Gray, William Cowper, and William Blake offered a form of literature rooted in feeling and, in the case of Blake, the sense of the poet as a visionary. The poetry of the period also represents the movement toward nature and the power of the human mind when in contact with nature. The great nonfiction prose works of the era were Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776–87) and Boswell’s Life of Johnson (1791). In drama the comedy of manners (see COMEDY) flourished in the hands of Richard Brinsley Sheridan (The School for Scandal, 1777) and Oliver Goldsmith (She Stoops to Conquer, 1773). The development of the NOVEL, begun earlier in the century, was enriched by Tobias Smollett’s Humphrey Clinker (1771) and Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy (1760–67), one of the great comic novels in English. The age also saw the production of two works that have been extremely influential in the development of modern RHETORIC, George Campbell’s The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1776) and Hugh Blair’s Lectures on Rhetoric (1783). James Sambrook’s The Eighteenth Century: The Intellectual and Cultural Context of English Literature, 1700–1789 (1986) provides an invaluable introduction to the ideas and attitudes of the era. Northrop Frye’s appeal for an “age of sensibility” is contained in his Fables of Identity (1963). 12\n\nAGING\n\naging The literature of aging and old age differs from nonliterary accounts of\n\nthe process in its emphasis on individual experience, describing what it is like for a particular person at a particular point in time. As a result, taken as a whole, it is filled with contradictions and paradoxes, which see age, on the one hand, as the culmination of a rich and rewarding life, and on the other, as deterioration and dependence. The dichotomy is well represented by two figures in Homer’s The Iliad: Nestor, the aged Greek general, is renowned for his eloquence, wisdom, and sense of justice, all acquired in the experience of his long life. In contrast, Anchises, as a young man celebrated for his beauty, the lover of Aphrodite, now is weak, blind, having to be carried from the burning walls of Troy by his son, the Trojan hero Aeneas. Between the heroic (Nestor) and the pathetic (Anchises) views of age stands the tragic. And that is embodied with unparalleled power in Shakespeare’s portrait of King Lear. As the play opens, Lear is every inch the king, an imperious old man habituated to a lifetime of power, now demanding protestations of love from his three daughters. Thwarted by his youngest daughter, Cordelia, who refuses to play a hypocritical game, he unleashes his pent-up fury in rash, angry words—invoking the gods in his denunciation of her candor. When he discovers the true nature of his other daughters, he begins to lose his identity. “Who is it who can tell me who I am?” That is a question he must answer for himself as he undergoes the painful lessons of one who “has ever but slenderly known himself.” In the process he becomes a “poor, naked wretch,” who achieves insight in madness. But his suffering and the wisdom derived from it are finally eclipsed by the unanswerable question he poses to the dead body of Cordelia. “Why should a horse, a dog, a rat have life and thou no life at all?” He dies having learned what it means to be human, having paid an awful price in the process. At the polar opposite of the view of age in King Lear is Robert Browning’s depiction in Rabbi Ben Ezra: Grow old along with me The best is yet to be The Rabbi urges us to use the limitations, the aches and pains of age, as spurs to participate in life, but always in the recognition that there is a divinity that shapes our ends. In the 20th century the religious coda is less in evidence as we are enjoined to experience life fiercely, in Dylan Thomas’s words, to “not go gently into that good night.” A memorable representative of this conviction is Zorba in Nikos Kasantzakis’s Zorba the Greek (1946; tr. 1952), whose passionate commitment to life leaves him open to all experience, including death. 13\n\nAGITPROP\n\nA less romantic view of age—one closer to contemporary experience—is meticulously portrayed in the last two volumes of John Updike’s Rabbit tetralogy, Rabbit is Back (1981) and Rabbit at Rest (1990), while the depiction of the protagonist of Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead (2004), a Protestant minister of a small congregation in Iowa, now in his seventies, suggests the continuing value of religious belief in imbuing the life of an aged person with a sense of the beauty of existence. Barbara Frey Waxman’s From the Hearth to the Open Road (1990) is an interesting feminist study of aging in contemporary literature. agitprop The use of literature to promote a political or ideological goal. The term—a fusion of agitation and propaganda—derives from the early years of the Soviet regime in Russia. The Soviets instituted a policy of agitation and propaganda to encourage popular participation in the goals of the Communist government. Using songs, films, and plays, agitprop agents brought the party line to towns and villages throughout the Soviet Union. In the 1920s and ’30s, forms of agitprop spread throughout Europe and the United States. A celebrated American example of the form is Clifford Odets’s Waiting for Lefty (1935), a passionate prolabor union drama focusing on a taxi drivers’ strike. agon A Greek word for struggle or conflict. In classical drama, it denotes the portion of the play, both in tragedy and comedy, in which two characters, each one supported by members of the CHORUS, engage in heated debate. The agon was a feature of both comedy and tragedy. The term is generally used in contemporary criticism as a synonym for a competitive struggle, particularly in the criticism of Harold Bloom, who depicts literary history in terms of the conflict between a “strong” poet and a significant predecessor whom the strong poet feels he must, in the reenactment of an Oedipal struggle, displace. Harold Bloom’s Agon: Towards a Theory of Revisionism (1982) is a collection of essays employing his theory. AIDS In the relatively brief period since its outbreak in the early 1980s, AIDS\n\n(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has resulted in the production of a large body of literature. Most of this work has formed the central theme of contemporary GAY LITERATURE. As the disease achieves the dimension of a worldwide epidemic, however, a small but increasing proportion of AIDS literature is being written by nongays. 14\n\nALAZON\n\nMuch of the early AIDS literature was angry, direct, and combative, striving to overcome the hostility, superstition, and fear that greeted the disease. While more recent literature has retained this angry tone, it has been tempered by infusions of comedy and the themes of love, compassion, and remembrance. Among the early accounts of the disease was Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City, originally serialized in the San Francisco Chronicle, published in book form in 1984, and later dramatized on public television, and Larry Kramer’s play The Normal Heart (1985), the first play to bring AIDS to the attention of the general public. The outstanding chronicler of the disease in fiction is Paul Monette, who died of AIDS in 1995. Monette’s memoirs Borrowed Time (1988) and Becoming a Man (1992), and his novels Afterlife (1990) and Halfway Home (1991), affirm the strengths of homosexual love in the face of death. Monette is also the author of a moving collection of poems celebrating the life of his deceased lover, Love Alone: Eighteen Elegies for Rog (1988). In drama, the AIDS crisis forms the center of the most acclaimed American play in many years, Tony Kushner’s Angels in America (1989), a two-part drama that touches on a broad range of themes with AIDS playing a central role. Outstanding among nonfiction accounts of the disease is Randy Shilts’s And the Band Played On (1987). Among the nongay literature of AIDS, a notable example is Alice Hoffman’s At Risk (1988), the account of an eleven-year-old girl’s contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. In film, the epidemic has been captured in Longtime Companion (1990) and Philadelphia (1993). In the latter film 53 AIDS-infected people were employed in bit parts; by the end of 1994, 43 of them had died, a gruesome reminder of the close connection between fiction and fact. AIDS: The Literary Response, edited by Emmanuel Nelson (1992), is a collection of critical essays examining the literature of the crisis from a variety of perspectives. Confronting AIDS Through Literature, edited by Judith Laurence Pastore (1993), provides a variety of views on using literature as a means of understanding the disease and its ramifications. alazon A Greek term meaning impostor.The alazon is a stock figure in COMEDY,\n\nfrequently taking the form of the miles gloriosus (the BRAGGART WARRIOR) or the learned bore (“the pedant”). He sometimes figures in the comic plot as one of the suitors of the heroine and is frequently set up in contrast to his opposite, the EIRON. Modern versions of the alazon figure include the figures of the professor in Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya (1899) and Captain Boyle in Sean O’Casey’s Juno and the Paycock (1924). 15\n\nALCOHOL\n\nalcohol A prominent feature in DRAMA, alcohol is a constitutive aspect of its very foundation. In his Poetics, Aristotle asserts that drama emerges from hymns in praise of Dionysus, the god of wine. (See APOLLONIAN/DIONYSIAN). Drinking and drunkenness plays a central role both in comedy, from Rabelais’ Gargantua (1534) to W.C. Fields, and in tragedy, from Euripides’ Bacchae (c. 405 b.c.) to Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940). In addition to his portrayal of collective drunkenness as one aspect of the occult powers accorded to followers of Dionysus, Euripides depicts the peril of individual drunkenness in his Alcestis (438 b.c.), in which Heracles’ inebriated state almost leads to catastrophe. The reverse side of the warning about the evils of alcohol forms the climax of Rabelais’ Gargantua and Pontagruel (1532–64), in which the pilgrimage to the Oracle of the Holy Bottle leads to the oracular message, “Drink.” Shakespeare’s notable drinkers, Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night and Falstaff in his three plays, also celebrate the state of inebriation. More realistically, the Drunken Porter in Macbeth sees drink as playing an equivocal role in one area: “Lechery, Sir, it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance.” Another notable imbiber is Sidney Carton, in Charles Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities (1859), who before sacrificing his life to save another declares, “It is a far, far better thing I do than anything I have ever done.” But despite its long lineage, alcohol does not “come of age” until the 20th century, when writers begin to examine the major role it plays in the lives of their characters. This is particularly true of modern American literature, where an astonishingly high number of the best writers have been outright alcoholics or extremely heavy drinkers. One reason for this phenomenon, it has been suggested, was Prohibition, which turned drinking into a defiant, rebellious act. Whatever the reason, the names of writers who came of age during the Prohibition years and became addicted include F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Sinclair Lewis, John Steinbeck, John Cheever, Norman Mailer, Ring Lardner, Dashiell Hammet, Thomas Wolfe, Malcolm Lowry, the playwrights Eugene O’Neill and Tennessee Williams, the poets Hart Crane, Theodore Roethke, James Dickey, John Berryman, and Robert Lowell. Many of these writers engaged the subject of alcoholism in their writing. Among the finest explorations of the experience is Malcolm Lowry’s Under the Volcano (1947), which records the disintegration of an alcoholic British consul in Mexico. The hallucinatory visions and voices he experiences are interwoven throughout the novel, suggesting analogies between the alcoholic’s disintegration and that of Europe on the brink of World War II. 16\n\nALIENATION\n\nAnother powerful and illuminating account of the alcoholic experience written by one who knew it at firsthand, is Eugene O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh (1939, pub. 1946), in which reformed drinker Hickey forces the alcoholic habitues of Harry’s Bar to recognize their pathetic self-deceptions as “pipe dreams.” But at the play’s conclusion he confesses that he himself has killed his faithful wife and is going to turn himself in. When he leaves, the drinkers fall back into their selfdeceptive illusions. Notable novels written by writers who were not themselves problem drinkers are Graham Greene’s study of an alcoholic priest hunted by an anticlerical government in 1930s Mexico, The Power and the Glory (1940), and Saul Bellow’s The Victim (1947), in which the alcoholic Albee uses drink to achieve an abandonment, a loss of self that he thinks of as heroic, while his counterpart Levenson overcomes his fear of failure, which for him has been embodied in the person of Albee. Two films dealing with alcoholism are Billy Wilder’s The Lost Weekend (1947) based on a novel by Charles Jackson, and Mike Figgis’s Leaving Las Vegas (1995). Thomas B. Gilmore’s Equivocal Spirits: Alcohol and Drinking in Twentieth-Century Literature (1987) is an excellent account of the ways in which “literature may confirm, intensify, dramatize, extend, and occasionally even challenge” scientific studies of alcoholism. alexandrine In PROSODY a line of six iambic feet (12 syllables). The standard\n\nline in traditional French verse, it is rarely used in English. A notable exception: Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene, which consists of nine-line stanzas, the first eight in iambic pentameter, with the ninth line an alexandrine. alienation The sense of estrangement from society or the self, identified in philosophy, the social sciences, and literature as a central feature of modern life. This pervasive use of the term derives from the 19th-century German philosophers G. W. F. Hegel and Karl Marx. For Hegel, alienation is the inevitable condition arising from the gap between human consciousness and the natural world, between the inner world and the outer world. Marx adapted the term to describe the condition of workers in industrialized, capitalist society, deprived of the satisfaction of experiencing their work as a meaningful expression of themselves. Reduced to viewing the fruits of their labor as objects and commodities, modern workers, according to Marx, experience alienation not only within themselves but also among one another because of the competitive ethos of capitalism. In the 20th century, social thinkers such as C. Wright Mills (White Collar: The American Middle Classes, 1951) and Herbert Marcuse (One Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society, 1964), and psychologists such as Eric Fromm (The Sane Society, 1965) developed these terms further. 17\n\nALIENATION EFFECT\n\nThe Marxist sense of the term, however, has played a relatively minor role in literary history. As represented in literature, alienation tends to come closer to the Hegelian definition with its emphasis on the disparity between the self and the world, consciousness and the objects of consciousness. In its literary form, alienation emerges as a major theme with the birth of ROMANTICISM. Even here, however, it invokes an earlier time, for the icon of alienation in the Romantic period is doubtless Shakespeare’s Hamlet.The introspective prince, alienated from his world and the role of avenger thrust upon him, is also alienated from himself, and acutely conscious of his condition. It is this painful self-consciousness that characterizes much of modern poetry, from the English Romantics and French Symbolists to T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land (1920) and the CONFESSIONAL POETRY of Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath. Central to much of this poetry is not only a repudiation of modern culture but also an agonized self-estrangement that has come to serve as the signature of the modern artist. In fiction, the alienated figures of 19th- and 20th-century literature— Dostoyevsky’s Underground Man (Notes from Underground, 1864), Melville’s Bartleby (Bartleby the Scrivener, 1850), Tolstoy’s Ivan Ilych (The Death of Ivan Ilych, 1886), Kafka’s Joseph K. (The Trial, 1925), Ellison’s Invisible Man (1952), Salinger’s Holden Caulfield (The Catcher in the Rye, 1951), and Camus’s The Stranger (1942)— are only a few of the many figures haunted by the shallowness and hypocrisy of modern life. But on another level, these works point to a more profound malaise: the sense that human existence lacks any coherence or purpose, that life is finally ABSURD. The close association of this mood with the EXISTENTIALISM of Sartre and Camus is not accidental. In the wake of World War II, the alienation theme had merged with the larger current of existentialist thought and feeling. In drama the alienated figure emerges in the tortured characters of Henrik Ibsen, the richly ironic tragicomic figures of Anton Chekhov, the haunted family of Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey Into Night (1940), the film personae of James Dean, Jean-Paul Belmondo, and the young Marlon Brando, and, perhaps most explicitly, in the formulation from Sartre’s No Exit (1945), “Hell is other people.” See MODERNISM. For a major study of literary alienation, see Erich Heller’s The Disinherited Mind (1952). For a discussion of the existentialist connection see William Barrett’s Irrational Man: A Study in Existentialist Philosophy (1958). The collection Man Alone: Alienation in Modern Society (1962), edited by Eric and Mary Josephson, is an anthology of classic writings on the subject. alienation effect A term coined by the German dramatist Bertolt Brecht to\n\ndescribe a desired detachment on the part of both actors and audience to pre18\n\nALLEGORY\n\nvent them from becoming emotionally involved in the action of the play. From Brecht’s perspective the practice of being swept away in complete identification with the characters produces a reaction that is highly emotional but insufficiently critical and reflective. As a result, Brecht employed such features as placards, music, and personal asides designed to remind the audience that they are watching a play. His aim, part of his commitment to MARXIST CRITICISM, was for the audience to examine the social and economic causes that lay beyond the actions and conditions in his plays. Ironically, playwrights in the West have adopted these techniques while they were rejected in countries under Communist control. See EPIC THEATER.\n\nMartin Esslin’s Brecht: The Man and His Work (1960) offers an excellent survey of Brecht’s achievement as a dramatist. allegory A type of NARRATIVE in which the surface story reflects at least one\n\nother meaning. Traditional allegory frequently employs PERSONIFICATION, the use of human characters to represent abstract ideas. Medieval MORALITY PLAYS were allegories in which abstractions such as Mankind, Good Deeds, Penance, and Death appeared as characters. Another type of allegory uses the surface story to refer to historical or political events and persons. Jonathan Swift’s Tale of a Tub (1704), for example, provides a satirical allegory of the REFORMATION. In his Anatomy of Criticism (1957), Northrop Frye distinguishes between a continuous allegory, such as The Faerie Queene (1590–96), which maintains the allegorical meaning throughout the narrative, and intermittent allegory, such as in The Scarlet Letter (1850), where it “may be picked up and dropped at pleasure.” By the 19th century, allegorical technique had begun to fall from favor. Symbolism, another method of representing an alternative meaning, became the preferred form. Symbolism and allegory sometimes overlap, but there is an important distinction between the two. A symbol bears a natural relation to the events of the story: the whale in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick (1851) is both a whale and a mysterious force. In allegory, the surface story is often an arbitrary excuse for the secondary meaning. As a result, in the age of MODERNISM symbolism came to be preferred to the seemingly antiquated technique of allegory. More recently allegory has made a comeback, in theory if not in practice: DECONSTRUCTION argues that the arbitrary quality of allegory is an accurate reflection of the character of language itself. That is, deconstructionists see the idea of a “natural” relation between a word and the object to which it refers as a comforting illusion. For them, the reality is closer to that depicted in allegory. 19\n\nALLITERATION\n\nAn additional use of the term is as the second of the FOUR LEVELS OF MEANING in medieval exegeses of biblical and literary texts.\n\nNorthrop Frye discusses allegory in his Anatomy of Criticism (1957). C. S. Lewis’s The Allegory of Love (1936) provides a clear discussion of the traditional sense of the term. Paul DeMan’s Allegories of Reading (1979) reflects the deconstructionist sense. alliteration The repetition of stressed initial sounds in a group of words that are\n\nclosely connected to one another. A common feature of traditional poetry and, to a lesser extent, of prose, alliteration is a distinctive feature of OLD ENGLISH poetry, as in this line from Beowulf: “From a friendless foundling, feeble and wretched.” Alliteration also plays an important role in MIDDLE ENGLISH literature, as in this line from Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: “The battlements broken down and burnt to brands and ashes.” Modern poets use it sparingly, or in a mocking, ironic context. Christopher Ricks’s Allusion to the Poets (2002) is a stimulating treatment of the subject. alternative history See COUNTERFACTUAL FICTION. allusion A reference within a literary text to some person, place, or event out-\n\nside the text. Allusions that refer to events more or less contemporary with the text are called topical allusions. Those referring to specific people are personal allusions. An example of a topical allusion is the reference of the drunken porter in Macbeth to “an equivocator . . . who committed treason enough for God’s sake . . .” This is a reference to Father Henry Garnet, a Jesuit priest who justified equivocation (a form of lying) during his trial for treason in connection with the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. An example of personal allusion is William Butler Yeats’s reference to “golden thighed Pythagoras” in his poem “Among School Children.” Other uses of an allusion might be to summarize an important idea (as in the concluding line from King Kong: “It was Beauty killed the Beast”), or to point to an ironic contrast between contemporary life and a heroic past (as in James Joyce’s classical parallels in Ulysses [1922], in which the heroic deeds in the Odyssey are implicitly contrasted to the banal details of everyday life in modern Dublin). In film, homage is the term for one director’s allusion to another’s work. ambiguity In ordinary usage the term refers to a lack of clarity in a situation or\n\nin an expression. In language use it is generally regarded as an error or flaw. This view of the term was dominant until the publication of William Empson’s Seven Types of Ambiguity (1930), a work that had a powerful impact on the development of NEW CRITICISM and of subsequent literary theory (see INDETERMINACY). 20\n\nAMERICAN RENAISSANCE\n\nEmpson used the term to describe a literary technique in which a word or phrase conveys two or more different meanings. He defined ambiguity as “any verbal nuance, however slight, which gives room for alternative reactions to the same piece of language.” Included among the “seven types” is the traditional meaning of the term, but the chief interest of the book lies in examples of the ways in which ambiguity can enhance the experience of poetry. An example of Empson’s analysis is his discussion of a line from Shakespeare’s Sonnet 73. In the poem the speaker compares his advancing age to a tree in early winter and the boughs of that tree to “Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.” The reference here is to the abandoned Catholic monasteries where choir boys once sang. Here is Empson’s analysis: The comparison is sound because ruined monastery choirs are places to sing, because they involve sitting in a row, because they are made of wood, . . . because they are now abandoned by all but the grey walls coloured like the skies of winter, because the cold and narcissistic charm suggested by the choir boys suits well with Shakespeare’s feeling for the object of the Sonnets [the young gentleman to whom the sonnets are addressed], and for various sociological and historical reasons (the Protestant destruction of monasteries, fear of puritanism) . . . and many more relating the simile to its place in the Sonnet, must all combine to give the line its beauty, and there is a sort of ambiguity in not knowing which of them to hold most clearly in mind. Seven Types of Ambiguity represents the first sustained analysis of the phenomenon of multiple meaning, or PLURISIGNATION. Empson’s considerable contribution to 20th-century criticism is discussed in Christopher Norris’s William Empson and the Philosophy of Literary Criticism (1978). American renaissance A term for a period of American literature that saw a remarkable outburst of creativity in American letters. The American critic F. O. Matthiessen first employed the term to describe the major works of Emerson (Essays, 1841, Poems, 1847); Thoreau (Walden, 1854); Hawthorne (The Scarlet Letter, 1850); Melville (Moby Dick, 1851), and Whitman (Leaves of Grass, 1855). Now the term is used to describe the entire American literary output in the 30 years preceding the Civil War. Critical to the development of literature and thought in the period was the movement known as TRANSCENDENTALISM, a rich mixture of Romantic ideas and American individualism. In addition to the outstanding figures listed above, the period also boasted four poets, venerated in their own time and even today looked upon as important 21\n\nANAGNORISIS\n\nfigures in the development of American poetry: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (The Song of Hiawatha, 1855), Oliver Wendell Holmes (“The Wonderful One Hoss Shay,” 1858), John Greenleaf Whittier (Voices of Freedom, 1846), and James Russell Lowell (The Biglow Papers, 1848). Unlike these poets, Edgar Allan Poe was almost completely neglected in his time, yet he made the greater impact on literary history. Poe’s poetry and criticism proved to be an important influence on the French SYMBOLIST poets, and his fiction helped to create two unique genres, the DETECTIVE STORY and HORROR FICTION. Other important developments in the period were the publication of SLAVE NARRATIVES and of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s fictional indictment of slavery Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852). F. O. Matthiessen’s study, generally considered a seminal work of American literary criticism, is The American Renaissance: Art and Experience in the Age of Emerson and Whitman (1941). Writing from a feminist perspective, Charlene Avallone has challenged Matthiessen’s exclusion of women writers in “What American Renaissance? The Gendered Genealogy of a Critical Discourse” in PMLA (October 1997), 1102–20. In Beneath the American Renaissance (1980), David Reynolds maintains that the major authors were heavily indebted to the popular culture of the period. anagnorisis In DRAMA, a term describing the moment of discovery or recogni-\n\ntion by the protagonist. In TRAGEDY such a moment frequently accompanies the PERIPETEIA, the reversal or downturn of his fortune, as in Oedipus’s discovery of his true identity in Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex. In COMEDY, the recognition leads to the happy ending, a connection parodied at the conclusion of Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), where Jack, who has been pretending that his name was Ernest, discovers that Ernest really is his name. anagogical See FOUR LEVELS OF MEANING. analogy A comparison based upon a similarity between two things. As a figure\n\nof speech, analogy functions as an extended SIMILE or METAPHOR. As a mode of thought, it refers to the process of reasoning from parallel examples, for example, the common Renaissance belief that the four HUMORS in a person’s body—blood, phlegm, choler, and bile—are analogous to the four elements in nature: earth, air, fire, and water. anapest A metrical FOOT containing two unaccented syllables followed by an\n\naccented syllable, as in this line from William Cowper: ‚ ˘ ˘ ‚ ˘ ˘ ‚ ˘ ˘ ‚ ˘ a˘ turf With on my breast, and a stone on my head 22\n\nANARCHISM\n\nanaphora In RHETORIC, a figure of speech in which a word or words are repeated, usually at the beginning of successive sentences or lines of verse. William Blake’s “London” provides an example:\n\nIn every cry of every man In every infant’s cry of fear In every vice, in every ban The mind-forg’d manacles I hear. anarchism Political creed advocating the elimination of governmental authority in favor of the voluntary association of individuals or groups. This sense of the term originated in the mid-1800s, first coined by the French political philosopher Pierre Proudhon. Earlier the term had been used, as it is still used today, to characterize groups who promote social chaos by TERRORISM or other violent means. In fact, anarchism has assumed a variety of forms that include nonviolent, pacifist groups as well as the more aggressive forms that involved anarchist communism and anarchosyndicalism, the alliance of anarchism and the trade union movement in France. Among literary figures associated with anarchism, the outstanding figure is Leo Tolstoy, who advocated a Christian-based form of nonviolent resistance to the state. As for the more aggressive terrorist form of anarchism, the best-known writer to examine it is Joseph Conrad. In two penetrating, powerful novels, The Secret Agent (1907) and particularly Under Western Eyes (1911), he explores the impenetrable conflict of revolutionary violence and authoritarian despotism. Conrad’s repudiation of anarchism is based on a profound belief in a natural order, always threatened, in his eyes, by the anarchist impulse. According to the critic David Kadlec, the common association of anarchism with leftist movements has led to the failure to see the important impact of anarchist principles, on literary MODERNISM and American PRAGMATISM. Kadlec maintains that, despite their political differences, anarchists and pragmatists were as one in rejecting the notion of “foundations,” the idea of a bedrock, underlying truth that supports social existence, creating an atmosphere on both sides of the Atlantic that had a powerful impact on modern writers. Ezra Pound and James Joyce , for example, saw in the anarchist rejection of “first principles” a political and philosophical context for the radical new poetic and narrative forms that distinguish their work. In America, on the other hand, the links between anarchism and creative writers were the philosophical pragmatists William James and John Dewey, who shared a common bond with “anarchism of the good kind.” The poets Marianne Moore and William Carlos Williams, for example, struggled against the debasement of language, which they saw as the inevitable social result of an outmoded economic system, causing them to “make it new” in Pound’s phrase, to 23\n\nANATOMY\n\nbreak with traditional poetic forms. Kadlec also invokes the figure of Zora Neale Hurston, whose training as a cultural anthropologist enabled her to see through the artificial categories of “race.” As Janie Crawford, the heroine of Hurston’s novel Their Eyes Are Watching God, puts it, “We’re uh mingled people,” thus pointing to the cultural, not “natural,” basis of racial identity. George Woodcock’s Anarchism (1962) is a clear and objective analysis. David Kadlec’s Mosaic Modernism: Anarchism, Pragmatism, Culture (2000) details the case for the alignment of anarchism and pragmatism and their employment by certain modern artists. anatomy In literature, the thorough analysis of a significant subject involv-\n\ning the division of the subject into its constituent parts. Writers in the English Renaissance adapted the medical sense of the term in order to probe a particular subject. For example, Robert Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) constitutes an exhaustive analysis of the melancholic HUMOR. In his Anatomy of Criticism (1957), Northrop Frye defines the term as “a form of fiction . . . characterized by a great variety of subject matter and a strong interest in ideas.” androgyny The combination of male and female characteristics. The word\n\nitself combines the Greek words for male (andros) and female (gynous). The literary tradition rests on the myth, recorded in Plato, of an ancient unified being of whom male and female are displaced halves seeking in sexual contact a long lost union. In its literary adaptation, androgyny assumes a number of forms. One is the motif of boy-girl twins. Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, Dickens’s unfinished novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870), Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher” (1838), and John Barth’s The Sot-Weed Factor (1974) employ opposite-sex twins as embodiments of androgynous ideals. Another form is the motif of a woman disguised as a man (in Shakespeare’s comedies), or man disguised as a woman (Thomas Branson’s Charley’s Aunt, 1892; Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot, 1959). Still another is the androgynous hero: Leopold Bloom in James Joyce’s Ulysses (1922), Orlando in Virginia Woolf’s Orlando (1928), and the hero/heroine of Gore Vidal’s Myra Breckinridge (1968). These novels and others exemplify what the critic Carolyn Heilbrun calls “the androgynous ideal,” based not upon the polarization of men and women, but on their integration. FEMINIST CRITICISM has created a new sensitivity about the presence of androgyny in less obvious forms, for example in that most unlikely of places, the life of Ernest Hemingway. The critic Mark Spilka has argued that Hemingway’s strenu24\n\nANGLO NORMAN\n\nously masculine exploits, such as bullfighting and big game hunting, were efforts to repress an attraction to androgyny deeply rooted in the writer’s childhood. Carolyn Heilbrun’s Toward a Recognition of Androgyny (1973) traces the theme from Greek myth to modern literature. For the question of Hemingway’s androgyny see Mark Spilka’s Hemingway’s Quarrel with Androgyny (1990). Anglo-Irish literature In the most general sense, literature written in English, rather than Gaelic, by Irish authors. In its narrower and more common sense, literature written largely by Irish Protestants loyal to the English throne during the “Protestant Ascendancy” in Ireland, the period from the late 17th century until the end of English rule in 1921. During that period many of the most distinguished authors in English literature were born in Ireland, a fact that appears to have little influence on the work of George Farquahr, Richard Steele, Laurence Sterne, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Oliver Goldsmith, Oscar Wilde, and George Bernard Shaw. With the exception of Shaw, all appeared to identify themselves as Englishmen. Others, such as Edmund Burke and Jonathan Swift, while not identifying themselves as Irish, passionately denounced the oppressive features of English rule. Still others, such as the novelist Maria Edgeworth, the poet James Clarence Mangan, and the song composer Thomas Moore, drew upon Irish culture and themes to define their work. By the late 19th century a new group of Anglo Irish had arisen, impatient with England’s refusal to grant Home Rule and defining themselves as Irish. Chief among these figures was William Butler Yeats, who returned to Celtic mythology as the inspirational source of his poetry. Yeats in turn influenced Lady Augusta Gregory, John Millington Synge, Sean O’Casey, and a host of talented writers who wrote for the ABBEY THEATRE. Their work spearheaded what came to be known as the IRISH RENAISSANCE. The establishment of the Irish republic in 1921 marked the end of “Anglo Irish” as a meaningful term, even in the six counties that constitute the Unionist state of Ulster (Northern Ireland). Distinguished Ulster poets such as John Montague, Seamus Heaney, and Derek Mahon identify themselves as Irish. Denis Donoghue’s We Irish (1986) discusses the term’s “identity problem.” Anglo Norman In English literature, the period following the Norman invasion of England in 1066 until the middle of the 14th century. Most of the literature of the period was either in Latin or in the Norman dialect of French. Among important works were Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia Regum Britanniae (History 25\n\nANGLO SAXON\n\nof the Kings of England, c. 1135), part legend, part history, an important source of material relating to King Arthur, and the Ancrene Riwle (Rule for Anchoresses, c. 1200) for young women preparing to enter the cloister. Another religious genre popular in the period involved the recounting of mystical experiences. Major mystical authors include Richard Rolle (Meditations on the Passion, c. 1340) and Dame Julian(a) of Norwich (Revelations of Divine Love). Dame Julian(a) recorded the mystical experiences she underwent while suffering from a severe illness. By the middle of the 14th century, the language we know as MIDDLE ENGLISH had evolved sufficiently to serve as a vehicle for the first great English poet, Geoffrey Chaucer. Richard Wilson’s Early Middle English Literature (revised edition, 1968) surveys the literature from 1066 to 1300, and D. M. Stenton’s English Society in the Early Middle Ages (1952) depicts the social background. Anglo Saxon See OLD ENGLISH. angry young men A term applied to a group of English writers, whose novels\n\nand plays in the 1950s featured protagonists who responded with articulate rage to the malaise that engulfed postwar England. The best known example of the work these writers produced is the angry working-class hero of John Osborne’s drama Look Back in Anger (1956). In fiction, the term has been applied to Kingsly Amis’s Lucky Jim (1953), John Braine’s Room at the Top (1957), and Allan Sillitoe’s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1958) and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1959). Kenneth Allsop’s The Angry Decade (1958) is an incisive account of the period. angst A German word meaning “dread,” used by the 19th-century theologian\n\nSøren Kierkegaard to describe the combination of guilt and fear that accompanies the loss of religious faith. This sense of the word is alluded to in the last name of the protagonist of John Updike’s Rabbit tetralogy—Angstrom. See EXISTENTIALISM. Kierkegaard’s analysis forms the core of his The Concept of Dread (1844). animated films Films in which thousands of cartoon drawings, each slightly\n\ndifferent from the next, are photographed by a special camera to give the illusion of movement. In the formative years of animation these films required 26\n\nANTHROPOLOGY\n\nthe labor of hundreds of illustrators. Today the work is done largely with a computer. Since the 1930s, animated films have been dominated by one name, Walt Disney, the creator of cartoon characters, such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, and full length animated classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940), and Fantasia (1940) that achieved worldwide fame. Long after his death the company that bears his name continues to produce successful animated films, including the innovative Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), in which cartoon and human characters appear to be interacting with one another. anonymous discourse The French theorist Michel Foucault’s term, used to\n\nassert the idea that a verbal utterance does not indicate a “thinking, knowing, speaking subject” but a totality, “which reflects not an individual’s intention, that is to say, meaning. In other words we speak a language whose definitions have been imposed upon us.” What Foucault is suggesting is that in the way we think and talk about a given topic, we have internalized a range of discourses that are, like the power they serve, anonymous. Foucault’s analysis appears in his Archaeology of Knowledge (1972). antagonist The chief opponent of the main character in a play or novel. The\n\nmain character, whether HERO or VILLAIN, is called the PROTAGONIST. Thus the antagonist in Hamlet is the villainous King Claudius, while the antagonist in Macbeth is the righteous Macduff. anthology A collection of essays, poems, or plays usually sharing a similar sub-\n\nject, period of time, or place of origin. Among the most important anthologies in English literature is Thomas Percy’s Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765), which created a popular taste for traditional English and Scottish ballads. Important anthologies in the history of American culture are the six Eclectic Readers (1836–57), compiled by William Holmes McGuffey. These “McGuffey Readers” were enormously successful school textbooks (over 100 million copies sold in the 19th century). They included excerpts from the major English writers, chosen to communicate moral lessons to their readers. anthropology The study of human societies from physical, cultural, and\n\nsocial perspectives. Anthropology and literary studies have increasingly overlapped in the 20th century. Anthropology and literature first united in the early years of the century when a group of classical scholars at Cambridge University 27\n\nANTICLIMAX\n\n(see CAMBRIDGE RITUALISTS) employed James Frazier’s anthropological study The Golden Bough (1890–1915) to argue that classical myth, literature, and religion had their origins in primitive rituals (see MYTH CRITICISM). Frazier’s study took on added significance when T. S. Eliot cited it as a source of The Waste Land (1922). The second great influence of anthropology on literary study has been STRUCTURALISM, specifically the work of the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. Lévi-Strauss’s study of primitive society, in which he noted the universal tendency to classify and order according to some principle—for example, the contrast between raw and cooked (The Raw and the Cooked, 1964)—provided one of the key elements of structuralism for literary critics, the notion of BINARY OPPOSITION as basic to human thought. Central to the contemporary relation of literature and anthropology is the current view of ETHNOGRAPHY, or anthropological description. In the world of cultural anthropologists such as Clifford Geertz, ethnographers have become increasingly aware of the extent to which the conventions of narrative shape and alter their descriptions, or that their descriptions tell a story. Furthermore, some ethnographers, in striving for what Geertz terms “thick descriptions,” have called for a greater reliance on literary techniques in order to convey the actual experiences of the societies they study. In turn, Geertz’s own ethnographies have served as models for practitioners of NEW HISTORICISM. James Clifford’s The Predicament of Culture (1988) looks at the relation of ethnography and art. anticlimax In fiction or drama, a falling off in intensity and interest following a serious high point. The term has a pejorative connotation when used to indicate a flaw in a narrative or play, unless a writer is employing it for a humorous effect. An apparent anticlimax can be, on closer examination, a brilliant enhancement of the scene. An example is the Drunken Porter scene following the murder of Duncan in Macbeth, which begins with an inebriated gatekeeper responding to a loud knocking on the gate to admit the noblemen Macduff and Lennox to the castle. On the surface the scene’s comic tone seems inappropriate at such a solemn moment, but, as analyzed by Thomas De Quincey in his famous essay “On the Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth” (1823), the scene manages to intensify the tragic tone by suggesting that the murder has transformed Macbeth’s castle into hell, while at the same time suggesting a kind of redemption with the entrance of Macduff. anti-hero The principal character in a play or novel who exhibits qualities the\n\nopposite of those usually regarded as “heroic.” The anti-hero may be cowardly, 28\n\nANTI-SEMITISM\n\nweak, inept, or simply unlucky. Here is the description of the anti-hero of E. Annie Proulx’s The Shipping News (1993): . . . failure to speak clearly; failure to sit up straight; failure to get up in the morning; failure in attitude; failure in ambition and ability; indeed in everything. His own failure. Although occasionally present in earlier literature, the anti-hero has proven to be a staple of modern literature, much of which is written, in Northrop Frye’s phrase, in the “ironic mode.” Frye describes the ironic mode as one in which “the characters exhibit a power of action inferior to the one assumed to be normal by the reader or audience.” (See HERO; IRONY.) The modern prototype (he even uses the term anti-hero to describe himself) is the anonymous, first-person narrator of Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Notes from Underground (1864). Locked in his room, the underground man records his rage and humiliation as he rails against the prevailing belief in human reason and scientific progress. His progeny have been many. As the critic Victor Brombert points out, “Nineteenth and twentieth century literature is . . . crowded with weak, ineffectual, pale, humiliated, self-doubting, inept, occasionally abject characters . . .” Notable recent examples include the narrator of Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man (1952) and Jean-Baptiste Clamence, the “judge–penitent,” confessing his sins in Albert Camus’s The Fall (1954). The anti-heroic strain also adapts itself well to comedy with its inherent impulse to debunk the pretensions to greatness that heroism implies. Here Shakespeare sets the tone in Falstaff’s “catechism” on honor from Henry IV Part 1, where the old knight asserts that “honor” is a mere word that he’ll have none of. In the 20th century, the anti-heroic comic figure finds two perfect proponents in Jaroslav Hasek’s The Good Soldier Schweik (trans. 1930) and in Joseph Heller’s Catch-22 (1961). Both Schweik and Yossarian, Heller’s antihero, attack the heroic ideal at its heart, the field of military valor. Similarly, the weak, neurotic, bespectacled figure embodied by Woody Allen in his films always implies a critique of the pretentious, beautiful people with whom he associates. Victor Brombert’s In Praise of Anti-Heroes (1999) eloquently discourses on the relation of the anti-hero to the spirit of our time. Northrop Frye’s account of low mimetic and ironic modes is developed in his Anatomy of Criticism (1957). anti-Semitism In literature, the representation of Jews in terms of certain\n\nnegative stereotypes. In Western culture, anti-Jewish prejudice, although present in a few classical writers, is primarily rooted in the New Testament. The Gospels 29\n\nANTI-SEMITISM\n\nin fact introduce the figures who were to become the basis of enduring individual Jewish stereotypes: Herod, the slaughterer of children; and Judas, the betrayer (for a price) of Christ. But a far more potent stereotype, the depiction of the Jews as a race of “Christ-killers,” produced a legacy that has distorted, as few events have, the history of the West. Particularly ironic is that, like Jesus himself, the authors of the Gospels were Jews. By the late middle ages, these biblical descriptions had developed into literary stereotypes. The image of Jews as child murderers constitutes the main action of “The Prioress’s Tale” in The Canterbury Tales (1380–1400); the association of Jewish behavior with both treason and avarice surfaces in the MORALITY PLAYS, and the representation of Jews as responsible for the crucifixion is a recurring feature of MYSTERY PLAYS. Medieval Europe also gave birth to anti-Semitic legends such as the story of the wandering Jew. In English Renaissance drama, two plays by its two greatest dramatists helped to perpetuate the myth of the Jew as arch-villain. Christopher Marlowe’s The Jew of Malta (1590) catered to a current of anti-Semitism, but the other play, Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice (1595), has given birth to a host of controversial and conflicting interpretations in print, on stage, and in society as a whole. On the one hand, Shylock, the play’s fierce, Christian-hating moneylender, is a stereotypical villain who launched a thousand anti-Semitic progeny; on the other, he is one of Shakespeare’s greatest dramatic achievements whose “Hath not a Jew eyes” speech echoes through time as a searing denunciation of anti-Semitism. He is, in the critic Harold Bloom’s words, “a permanently equivocal trouble to all of us.” In the 18th century anti-Semitism appears regularly in the writings of Voltaire, whose celebrated commitment to tolerance apparently did not include Jews and Catholics. The 19th-century novel maintained the “villain Jew” stereotype in the characters of Fagin in Oliver Twist (1837–39) and Svengali in George Du Maurier’s Trilby (1894). Much more subtle are the references to rich and greedy Jewish bankers in the novels of Honoré de Balzac and Henry James. The attempt to represent a pro-Semitic point of view is evident in Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe (1820) and George Eliot’s Daniel Deronda (1876), but the Jewish characters in these novels, while positive, are equally stereotypical. No one, it seemed, could get it right until June 16, 1904, the fictional date when Leopold Bloom left his house to walk the streets of Dublin in James Joyce’s Ulysses (1922). Bloom is not defined by his Jewishness; it is merely one facet of his unique, memorable, complex character. Twentieth-century writers charged with harboring anti-Semitic attitudes include the poet Ezra Pound and the French novelist Louis-Ferdinand Céline,\n\n30\n\nANTI-STRATFORDIAN THEORIES\n\nboth of whom were active supporters of Fascist regimes and were outspoken in their denunciation of Jews. A name recently added to this list is that of Paul De Man, one of the leading exponents of DECONSTRUCTION. The long tradition of “polite” anti-Semitism in France has been examined recently by the critic Jeffrey Mehlman, who has argued that this attitude is reflected in the lives and writings of four prominent 20th-century literary figures: the novelist André Gide, the playwright Jean Giraudoux, and the prominent critical theorists Maurice Blanchot and Jacques Lacan. Mehlman makes it clear that most of the evidence for these attitudes derives from the writings of these men before the Nazis transformed social snobbery into an unimagined horror—that is, before anyone was aware of the extremes to which anti-Semitism might be put. Nevertheless, Mehlman suggests that those attitudes contributed to an atmosphere that made possible the HOLOCAUST. Edgar Rosenberg’s From Shylock to Svengali (1960) traces the history of anti-Semitism in English literature. Jeffrey Mehlman’s study is Legacies of Anti-Semitism in France (1983). The question of Paul De Man’s wartime writings is debated in the journal Critical Inquiry v. 15 (summer, 1989). anti-Stratfordian theories A general term for the belief that someone other than William Shakespeare wrote the plays attributed to him. The chief candidates for the authorship of the plays have been Sir Francis Bacon, the 17th-century essayist and philosopher; the dramatist Christopher Marlowe; and Edward de Vere, 17th earl of Oxford. Bacon’s candidacy was advanced as early as 1769 and was supported in the 19th century by Mark Twain among others. The supporters of Marlowe are not deterred by the fact that Marlowe was murdered in 1593, a year in which Shakespeare was just beginning his career; they have argued that Marlowe’s death was staged and that he continued to live abroad, conveying the plays to Shakespeare’s company through an intermediary. The most popular recent candidate has been the earl of Oxford, whose claim, like Marlowe’s, is considerably undermined by Oxford’s death in 1604; many of Shakespeare’s greatest plays were written after that date. The assumption shared by most anti-Stratfordians is that Shakespeare, a commoner with only a grammar school education, could not have written these great plays, a position that exhibits a touching faith in the virtues of the aristocracy. Frank Wadsworth’s The Poacher from Stratford (1958) offers a comprehensive account of the controversy.\n\n31\n\nANTISTROPHE\n\nantistrophe In classical Greek drama, a response by a section of the CHORUS to a previous strophe (a stanza of verse). Both strophe and antistrophe were written in the same METER. aphaeresis See SYNCOPE. aphorism A brief, elegant statement of a principle or opinion, such as “God\n\nis in the details.” An aphorism is similar to an EPIGRAM, differing only in the epigram’s emphasis on WIT. apocalypse Literally, the last book of the BIBLE, the Book of Revelation accord-\n\ning to John. The more general sense, reflected in the adjective apocalyptic, is a type of literature that is prophetic or focused on the end of the world. Among English poets associated with the apocalyptic strain, the outstanding figures are William Blake, many of whose works—including his Milton (1801) and Jerusalem (1804)—are apocalyptic visions, and William Butler Yeats, whose “The Second Coming” is among the most celebrated poems of the 20th century. The creation of the atomic bomb in 1945 has moved the apocalyptic form closer to realism. (See SCIENCE FICTION; NUCLEAR WAR. See also “LEFT BEHIND” NOVELS.) Frank Kermode’s The Sense of an Ending (1967) is a study of apocalyptic fiction. apocope See SYNCOPE. apocrypha Works of the Old and New Testament not admitted to the CANON\n\nby the Catholic Church, or works rejected by Jews or Protestants for doubtful validity. In literature, the term is applied to works whose authorship is questionable. An example of an apocryphal play is Edward III, a history play that many scholars believe was written partly by Shakespeare. Apollonian/Dionysian Contrasting terms coined by the 19th-century German\n\nphilosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. For Nietzsche, the Apollonian (after the god Apollo) stands for order, rationality, and moral behavior, while the Dionysian (after Dionysus, the god of wine) represents the spontaneous, irrational, and amoral spirit of life. Nietzsche employs these terms in his The Birth of Tragedy (1872), in which he argues that Greek tragedy is essentially Dionysian, rooted in powerful and primitive emotions, and that the Apollonian element is a later accretion. This position directly contradicted the prevailing view of Nietzsche’s time, but has been confirmed by later studies. 32\n\nAPPEARANCE/REALITY\n\naporia The Greek word for complexity, used in classical philosophy to describe a debate in which the arguments on each side are equally valid. In DECONSTRUCTION the term describes the impasse, the inner contradiction that, according to deconstructionist critics, lies at the heart of any TEXT, thus rendering its meaning always indeterminate. The “answer” to the question “Which comes first, the chicken or the egg?” is an example of an aporia. apostrophe A figure of speech in which a speaker turns from the audience to\n\naddress an absent person or abstract idea. It differs from a soliloquy in that the speaker of an apostrophe need not be alone on the stage. An example occurs in the second act of Hamlet, when the Prince turns from a conversation with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to declare: What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god: the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals—and yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? The apostrophe also figures prominently in lyric poetry, as in William Blake’s “Tyger”: Tyger, tyger, burning bright In the forest of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry? appearance/reality A recurring theme in literature, the distinction between\n\nwhat appears to be and what is has taken on a wide variety of forms. Its classical statement occurs in the Myth of the Cave in Plato’s Republic: Plato’s parable pictures people chained in a cave and facing a wall. They can see only shadows cast by objects in the light of a fire within the cave. Most people remain within the cave, but a few venture outside where they finally look up to see the sun, the true source of light. This movement from appearance to reality is based on a philosophy of idealism, the belief that ultimate reality resides in ideas, not in matter. Plato’s views exerted a strong influence in the literature of the RENAISSANCE; in Shakespeare’s tragedies, for example, appearance is the outer “clothing” that disguises the inner reality. In the first act of Hamlet, the prince’s mother rebukes him for continuing to wear black in mourning for his father: “Why seems it so particular with thee?” Hamlet casts his reply in terms of inner reality versus outer show: 33\n\nAPRON STAGE\n\nSeems, madam? Nay it is. I know not “seems.” ’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black. . . . These indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passes show These but the trappings and the suits of woe. In later periods the alternative view—that the sum of appearances is reality— begins to emerge in such works as the philosophy of Benedict de Spinoza and the poetry of William Wordsworth, who locates the principle of reality in the experience of nature. Other Romantic poets, notably Samuel Taylor Coleridge, adhere to the principle that the imagination shapes and defines reality. In the 20th century, the doctrine of PHENOMENOLOGY asks that the question of “the real” be bracketed (set aside) in order to provide a precise description of experience. One extreme reaction to this concept is the view of the ABSURD which, in the words of John Yolton, is the “denial of reality to the only reality left, the reality of lived human experience.” See also “AS IF” FICTIONS. John Yolton’s “Appearance and Reality” in The Dictionary of the History of Ideas (1968), edited by Philip Wiener, is an admirable summary of the terms. apron stage A stage that is thrust out into the audience on three sides, creating\n\ncloser contact than is the case with a PROSCENIUM stage. The apron stage was a common feature of Elizabethan theaters, such as Shakespeare’s GLOBE THEATRE. Arab-American literature The first wave of Arab-American immigration,\n\nlargely Christians from Syria and Lebanon, began in the 1880s and continued into the 1920s. The second wave, about half of them Muslims, arrived after World War II and continues to the present day. An early and important force in Arab-American literature is Ameen Rihani, a Lebanese-born scholar and diplomat, whose The Book of Khalid (1911), a novel written in free verse records the struggles and triumphs in the immigrant experience.The most important early work of Arab-American literature is Kahil Gibran’s world-famous The Prophet (1923), a meditative prose poem, extolling love as the central fact of the human condition. In America alone, this book, which has been translated into 13 languages, has sold over more than 4 million copies. Some later Arab-American writers include the talented William Peter Blatty, author of The Exorcist, and Vance Bourjaily, but neither chose to examine the ethnic experience in their work. The major breakthrough occurred with 34\n\nARISTOTELIAN CRITICISM\n\nthe publication of Grape Leaves (1982) an anthology of Arab-American poetry, which included work by three outstandingly talented poets, Samuel Hazo, D. H. Melhem, and Etel Adnan. Recent notable novelists include Naomi Shihab Nye. Equally talented is Diana Abu-Jabere; Arabian Jazz (1994), a work whose feminist perspective casts a cold eye on male dominance in both Arab and American societies, but her main character represents the best of both worlds, a Palestinian refugee who loves jazz. Evelyn Shakir’s “Arab-American Literature” surveys the subject in New Immigrant Literatures in the United States (1996), ed. Alpana Sharma Knippling. Arcadia An idealized PASTORAL setting. Arcadia is a mountainous region in Greece, celebrated as a rustic setting in classical and Renaissance literature. Sir Philip Sidney’s Arcadia (1587, 1590) is an elaborate, pastoral prose-romance that exerted a strong influence on English Renaissance literature. archetypal criticism See MYTH CRITICISM. archive A place for storing documents or records. In literary studies, the cor-\n\nrespondence, manuscripts, and personal papers of important writers are stored in major libraries. One example is the T. S. Eliot archive at Princeton University, which has been sealed until 2020. The Eliot archive forms the background to Martha Cooley’s novel The Archivist (1998). The term takes on new meaning in the work of the theorist Michel Foucault, who uses archive to denote the accumulated body of definitions that dominates a particular field of knowledge. For Foucault, the word AUTHOR, with its connotations of an autonomous, creative individual (“the genius”), is an example of the archival nature of language in literary studies. Michel Foucault’s treatment of the archive is developed in his Archaeology of Knowledge (1972). argument In RHETORIC, the line of reasoning designed to demonstrate the\n\ntruth or falsity of a particular position; in literature, a brief summary of the plot or subject matter of a narrative or play, such as the Argument preceding Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798). Aristotelian criticism A type of criticism deriving from Aristotle’s Poetics, probably the most influential analysis of literature ever recorded. Aristotle defined literature as imitation (MIMESIS); gave an account of the origins, development, and 35\n\nARMENIAN-AMERICAN LITERATURE\n\nstructure of drama; distinguished between comedy and tragedy; and introduced the concept of CATHARSIS and the UNITIES. Aristotelian critical principles inform much of the thinking of the CHICAGO SCHOOL of modern criticism. Armenian-American literature Until the 11th century, Armenia was an\n\nindependent nation in western Asia. From that time, Armenia was continuously colonized by Ottoman Turks, who ceded part of the country to Russia in the late 19th century. Divided between two warring empires (Russian and Ottoman) during World War I, Turkish Armenians were subject to genocidal massacres, the worst of which occurred in 1915. In the wake of the genocide, the Armenian diaspora brought 100,000 immigrants to the United States. Since then, the number of immigrants swelled to the point that there are now 750,000 Armenian Americans. The ghost that haunts Armenian-American literature is the “ethnic inheritance of genocide,” in which 1 million Armenians were killed by Turkish rulers between 1890 and 1915. The best known of these works is Michael Arlen’s Passage to Ararat (1975), which recounts the author’s attempts to fix the identity of his father (who disguised his Armenian roots) and therefore of himself. Winner of the National Book Award, Passage to Ararat describes Arlen’s trip to the genocide memorial in present-day Armenia and an imagined dialogue with his dead father, with whom he makes his peace. The most celebrated of Armenian-American authors, is the playwright and novelist William Saroyan. Saroyan writes extensively on non-Armenian subjects, but he frequently returned to his ethnic roots, notably in his novel Rock Wagra"
