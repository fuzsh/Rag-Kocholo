She has hundreds of inventions and holds over 120 patents. She is the president and founder of For Your Ease Only, Inc.\n\nLife\n\n[edit]\n\nGreiner grew up in the Near North Side, Chicago.[2] She majored in communications at Loyola University Chicago and worked for The Chicago Tribune while in college.[3] She was an aspiring playwright and sold jewelry on the side.[4] She is married to Dan Greiner.[3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nGreiner is the president and founder of For Your Ease Only, which launched in 1996.[4][2] The same year, she created and patented a plastic earring organizer; J.C. Penney picked up the product before the holiday season, allowing her to pay off her $300,000 loan in 18 months.[1][5] In addition to jewelry storage, she has patented consumer products in categories such as cosmetic organization, travel, electronics, and household items. Greiner has invented hundreds of products and holds 120 patents.[1]\n\nAfter her success with J.C. Penney, Greiner expanded her company, with her products appearing on Home Shopping Network[1] and in the retail store Bed Bath & Beyond.[6] In 2000,[4] she began hosting a show on QVC, \"Clever & Unique Creations by Lori Greiner\".[7] Her many appearances on the network led to her nickname, \"The Queen of QVC\".[1][8]\n\nIn 2012, Greiner joined the U.S. TV series Shark Tank.[8] In 2014, her investment in Scrub Daddy, a company that produces a texture-changing household sponge, was regarded as one of the biggest successes in Shark Tank history.[9][10] Greiner's other early Shark Tank investments include Bantam Bagels (which was fully acquired by T. Marzetti Company in 2018),[11] Squatty Potty,[12] ReadeRest,[8][12] Paint Brush Cover,[12] Hold Your Haunches,[12] Drop Stop,[12] FiberFix,[12] Simply Fit Board,[1] Sleep Styler,[9] and Screenmend.[12] The companies she has invested in have collectively made over $400 million.[13]\n\nGreiner's book, Invent it, Sell it, Bank it! – Make Your Million Dollar Idea into a Reality, was published in March 2014.[2][3]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
