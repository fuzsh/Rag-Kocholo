        "text": "Nick counsels a diverse group of clients, including national and international companies, government entities, and private developers, investors, and lenders in all stages of commercial real estate acquisitions, sales, and financing transactions. He also works with landlords and tenants in the negotiation of a wide range of commercial leases, including office, retail, warehouse, and industrial leasing, and represents clients in the negotiation of redevelopment and financial agreements with respect to redevelopment projects. Outside of his commercial real estate practice, Nick assists clients with corporate transactions, permitting and licensing, and business entity formations.\n\nClients appreciate Nick’s drive to close transactions in a timely and efficient way, while handling all of the unique and often complex issues that arise along the way. He works with clients to fully understand their priorities and concerns so he can provide a plan of action based on their particular goals and needs. Clients welcome Nick’s clear and frequent communication and his ability to explain complicated issues in an easily digestible manner, helping them make better business decisions. Nick prides himself on his ability to meaningfully develop relationships with clients by persistently striving to be a trustworthy advisor and impactful team player through responsiveness, diligence, and a practical approach to solving complex problems.\n\nEarlier in his career, Nick served as a Deputy Attorney General in the Division of Law of the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General, where he represented state agencies and independent authorities in a broad scope of transactions, including the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Department of Property Management and Construction, and the Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority. He also advised on compliance and regulatory matters, including compliance with a broad range of governing statutes and regulations, public procurement laws and policies, and land use and zoning regulations. He also served as counsel to numerous state boards and commissions, including the State House Commission, State Leasing and Space Utilization Committee, and the real estate committees for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and the Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority. These representations allowed Nick to gain critical transactional and governance experience, which has played a significant role in the way that he approaches the representation of firm clients today."
