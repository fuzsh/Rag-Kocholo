According to electronic-mail service providers and a half- dozen information systems sites, mail volume — particular¬ ly messages with large attach¬ ments — was up 10% to 15% on average during the 15-day strike, which ended last week.

But they also are spending big to shore up missing features. TCP/IP-based Internet mes¬ saging systems will let compa¬ nies run thousands of users per server. Client/server systems such as Lotus Notes typically support several hundred users per server. Software costs are generally lower, and companies can mix and match Internet mail clients and servers with ease. But there are trade-offs.

But is there any evidence it is true? Not even the Fed’s statisti¬ cians can back it up with hard numbers. In a recent poll of 200 CEOs and chief financial officers at the top 10% publicly held com¬ panies in the U.S., IT ranked third behind productivity and Federal Reserve policies as the key enablers behind the econo¬ my’s recent growth, according to a survey conducted by Inves¬ tor’s Business Daily in New York and Technometrica Institute of Policy & Politics in Emerson, N.J. Moreover, executives rank technological advancements as the top reason why the economy won’t overheat in the near-term. “We do not know, nor do I suspect can anyone know, whether current developments are part of a once- or twice-in-a- century phenomenon that will carry productivity trends ... to a new higher track,” Greenspan told Congress last month. More important, Greenspan admitted it is time for the Fed to create a way to measure the economy by assessing IT’s im¬ pact on productivity. MEASUREMENT TOOLS Some economists say the mea¬ surement tools to gauge that im¬ pact have been available for years. The problem, they say, is that the Fed hasn’t gotten around to applying them. Experts such as John W. Ken¬ drick, a retired professor at George Washington University, devised ways to measure the im¬ pact of technology and research and development on productivi¬ ty years ago, said John Mueller, vice president and chief econo¬ mist at Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon, Inc., an investment re¬ search firm in Arlington, Va. Donald Allen, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said there is a correla¬ tion between technology-sawy industries such as telecom¬ munications and their increase in productivity. Part of the problem is that in today’s services-led economy, it is difficult to measure the \"real” output of services such as con¬ sulting. “If you’re looking at the productivity impact that IT has had on manufacturing, there’s a strong correlation,” Allen said. For sendee-based industries, “it’s not as easily measurable,” he added. SOFT GAINS The greatest benefits from IT in¬ vestments aren’t found in tradi¬ tional areas such as cost savings and reduced head count, but in “intangible” areas such as quali¬ ty improvements, timeliness ® COMPUTERWORLD For these and other related links, point your browser at www.computerworld.com/ links/cjyo&2^ITprodlinks.html — Productivity without Profit? http://ccs.mit.edu/ CCSWP190.html »- Workshop on Information Systems and Economics http://130.207.5y.82/wise/ wisegyhp.htm and better service, said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Manage¬ ment in Cambridge, Mass. In a recent study of 800 For¬ tune 1,000 companies, Bryn¬ jolfsson and his colleagues found that companies with above-average investments in IT experience higher productivity growth. He estimated that IT has added 0.5% to productivity growth in the economy in tire 1990s, or roughly $40 billion in aggregate output per year. But contrarians insist IT still hasn’t made an appreciable im¬ pact on productivity. During the past 20 years of the so-called Information Age, “computers have taken over a great many processes in busi¬ ness, but productivity has not increased,” said Kirkpatrick Sale, a Cold Spring, N.Y., author of Rebels Against the Future: Les¬ sons for the Computer .Age. That’s because “there’s so much money being spent to teach people how to use, adapt and upgrade technologies that ultimately [the investments in technology] are not productive,’ Sale said. □ NEWS GATEWAY™ E-Series PCs !

High-speed air travel allows diseases to spread; antibiotics breed drug-resistant bacteria; computers spark a surge in repetitive stress injuries. E-mail and automated response sys¬ tems, we’re finding, can have revenge ef¬ fects of their own. Computerworld last week launched a daily E-mail news ser¬ vice. We had tested the daylights out of our E-mail server, or so we thought. But the launch didn’t go quite as we expected. Thousands of E-mails went to people who weren’t supposed to receive them. And many people who wanted to sub¬ scribe to the service couldn’t. Late in the week, our server choked, and we had to shut down for a few days to fix it. That is just one of many mass-mail horror stories. Recently, a colleague from another publication wrote about the disaster that occurred when he invoked his Tomorrow's spam- E-mail autoresponder while away on vacation. The autoresponder got locked mer may be you. in a deadly embrace with another E-mail server and generated more than 100,000 messages in a week. The inadvertent spam attack shut down a mail server and sparked a legal threat from the recipient. Last winter, my community was plagued by mysterious tele¬ phone calls that woke hundreds of residents in the middle of the night and then hung up. After covering the story for several days in its pages, a local newspaper sheepishly admitted that the culprit was its own telemarketing autodialer gone askew. To the victims of our incorrigible E-mail server, you have my sincere apologies and promise that things will be fixed this week. In the meantime, send me your own horror stories of misfired E-mail.

But a new wave of more complex, feature- packed browsers will bring some training and support issues that information systems departments haven’t had to confront seri¬ ously, users said. “I had assumed, like everybody else, that the browser was going to be relatively simple,” said David Schaefer, an assistant vice president in the information ser¬ vices division at Com¬ merce Bancshares, Inc. in Kansas City, Mo. Then Schaefer start¬ ed getting reports from his support staff that the company will have to start training users on how to operate browsers. “We can’t keep up with the train¬ ing issue now,” he said. For example, Microsoft Corp.’s Internet Explorer 4.0 Web browser, which ships at the end of September, will give users a whole new navigation experience. Integrated with the Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems, Internet Explorer 4.0 lets users view files on their lo¬ cal hard drives the same way they view Web pages. But some companies said that may be too drastic a change for their users to digest. For example, with Microsoft’s new “shell integration,” a user who goes into Network Neigh¬ borhood or My Computer and expects to find a window instead gets a browser interface with a Hypertext Markup Language page, tool bar, favorites and space to type a uniform resource locator, which launches directly to the Internet. Fearing end-user confusion, Schaefer said he will recom¬ mend that his company disable the feature. “There’s no clear lines anymore of demarcation between your desktop, the net¬ work and the world,” he said. At Wheat Butcher First Sing¬ er, a nationwide financial ser¬ vices firm in Richmond, Va., Web administrator Pamela Ed¬ wards is concerned about some¬ thing as seemingly innocuous as the switch to single, rather than double, clicks. She said functions that previ¬ ously required a single click, such as marking a series of files to copy, now require hovering the mouse over them and de¬ pressing the shift key instead of clicking. Chris Carper, Microsoft’s product manager for Internet Explorer, said the new features are based on customer feedback and usability testing. He said users can disable any feature they don’t want. And that is exactly what Ed¬ wards plans to do with many of the fancy new features to avoid the “significant expense” to train users. Fred Ghahramani, technical services manager at First Data, Inc.’s Card Services Group in Omaha, said he never found a pressing need to train users with the early, more “intuitive” browsers. Now that the Internet Explorer 4.0 browser is more complex, he knows he should, but he doesn’t have the man¬ power to train the 1,200 users under his watch. But Ghahramani plans an innovative, cost-effective solution. He said he will run remote classrooms at the users’ desktops through the NetShow streaming video/audio feature. Internet Explorer isn’t the only browser that is creating more training issues, IS managers said. Companies face the same issues if they choose to use Net¬ scape Communication Corp.’s full Communi¬ cator groupware and / or its new Netcaster push component, which creates a user in¬ terface replete with channels for automati¬ cally delivering content to end users. “You have a feature-laden product out there from both companies, so it’s going to re¬ quire more end-user training no matter what,” said Paul Blei- meyer, a senior systems admin¬ istrator at the Rochester, Minn.- based Mayo Foundation, which deploys both browsers. “Other¬ wise, your help desk pays the price.” □ This month in Computerworld Intranets: telecom, entertainment and insurance.

Oracle is upgrading its World Wide Web-enabled Developer/ 2000 development tool with features aimed at keeping thin- client throughput from being throttled by network traffic. Included will be the ability to download more processing from application servers to cli¬ ent boxes. That would require more memory at the desktop, making clients not so thin. But several early users of De- veloper/2000 for the Web said leaning more heavily on clients could keep data- intensive appli¬ cations from bogging down. With the initial server-centric Web release of Developer/2000, “performance is not as stellar as one would like,” said an enter¬ prise architect at a major insur¬ ance company in the Northeast who asked not to be identified. TOOL TIME AT ORACLE • Product Key features Availability Developer/2000 2.0 Improved user interface, initial object support Fourth quarter Designer/2000 2.0 New version of database modeler with 0racle8 object support Beta testing starts this week Object Database Designer “The Web is just not the fastest environment in the world.” SIMPLER TO USE Developers said the promised additions to Developer/2000 could free up customers to download different amounts of application logic to individual browser users. And no code would have to be rewritten. Developer/2000, which has been Oracle’s workhorse tool for building two-tier database appli¬ cations, got Web support in the spring. But users have to send requests to a server in order to do virtually all processing. HP to unveil migration plans to 64-bit computing By Jaikumar Vijayan with most of its major prod¬ uct announcements for the year already under its belt, Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard Co. will use this week’s HP World show in Chicago to ham¬ mer home its message of an “Extended Enterprise” and its “Pervasive Solutions” frame¬ work to take users there. Extended Enterprise refers to HP’s long-term strategy to build an Internet-enabled enter¬ prise that links a company’s em¬ ployees, customers, business partners and suppliers via the World Wide Web. The Pervasive Solutions framework is the tech¬ nology to get them there. BIG SHIFTS Over the next few years, the strategy will result in some fair¬ ly significant technology shifts for HP users. That includes a move to 64-bit Unix this fall and a transition from PA-RISC ar¬ chitectures to the IA-64 chip technology being jointly devel¬ oped with Intel Corp. HP has said users can choose New tool for building 0racle8 database objects Steve Ehrlich, senior director of tools product marketing at Oracle in Redwood Shores, Calif., said support for combin- ln beta this fall ing multiple processing re¬ quests into a single network transmission is targeted for a fourth-quarter release. The ability to download pieces of server-based applications to clients should follow in the first half of next year, Ehrlich said. More memory would be needed at the desktop, “but it still wouldn’t be a traditional fat cli¬ ent in any sense,” he said. Larger downloads might in¬ crease application start-up time, said Scott Fabian, graphical ap¬ plication development manager at Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp. in Burlington, N.J. “But performance after that is potentially going to be better, and we have a lot of users who are in applications all day long.” □ © Oracle’s object tool plans are still murky.

Meanwhile, the company will continue to support existing platforms for as long as needed. “HP will want to make very clear to users what the migra¬ tion will look like and what to expect” when moving to these technologies, said Jean Bozman, an analyst at International Data Corp. in Mountain View, Calif. Details expected at the show include HP’s plans to set up re¬ gional transition centers to edu¬ cate users about the new tech¬ nologies and its efforts with independent software vendors to port and develop new applica¬ tions around the emerging tech¬ nologies. The company also is expected to disclose early details on the IA-64 chip architecture, includ¬ ing a better indication of when products based on the technol¬ ogy will be available. “There’s been a lot of interest in these topics in our user groups for some time,” said Jeff Odom, chairman of Interex, the user group that organized the show. □ Train in vain ?

The optical “cross connect” will be used on a fiber ring in Dallas to test live voice, video and data applications. The use of an optical cross- connect system is “a very big step forward for the optical net¬ work,” said John Ryan, a princi¬ pal at Ryan Hankin Kent, Inc., a consultancy in South San Francisco, Calif. “With a tidal wave of available bandwidth coming, it’s impor¬ tant for enterprise users that bandwidth be reliable. Large corporate customers are making sure carriers have fast and pre¬ dictable recovery,” Ryan said. QUICKER RESTORATION With an optical cross connect, MCI, based in Washington, can restore network traffic in the event of a cable break much quicker than with electronic cross connects. AT&T Corp. in Basking Ridge, N.J., said it is studying optical cross connects. Sprint Corp. in Kansas City, Mo., is testing optical cross con¬ nects in Burlingame, Calif., for different purposes than re¬ storing breaks in its network, a spokesman said. Sprint already can restore a network break within 60 msec over 60% of its domestic net¬ work using a four-fiber, bidirec tional line-switched system. That percentage will reach 100% by mid-1998, the spokes¬ man said.D Computerworld August 25, 1997 (www.computerworld.com) ontinental Airlines charts innovative network course ► Finally profitable, airline bankrolls its first ca mp us p roj ect By Bob Wallace “you can’t be thinking about a multimillion-dollar network when you don’t have money to pay your bills.” That’s how Bob Edwards at Continental Airlines explained the situation he faced as his company went bankrupt in 1983 and 1990, finally clawing its way back toward profitability in a fiercely competitive market. TRYING TO SURVIVE Crushing financial burdens such as expensive loans and sky- high leases on planes left the company fighting for survival, with little capital to invest in cor¬ porate projects such as information sys¬ tems. As a result, the airline didn’t have ob¬ vious information technology tools, such as a corporate data network. That forced most employ¬ ees to use telephones or “sneakernet” to communicate with employees in the same four-building complex. Senior managers posted memos to employees on bulle¬ tin boards. The result was very slow movement of potentially competitive data. But in 1995, after Continental returned to profitability, Ed¬ wards, director of advanced technology and industry appli¬ cations, starting thinking net¬ work again. He needed $7 mil¬ lion to build the Houston-based firm a campus network.

The airline al¬ ready used 3Com equipment. After Continental ex- '§ plained its predica¬ ment, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based network supplier agreed to pro¬ vide a “transition” net¬ work of much-needed internetworking equip¬ ment and support to help Continental get the robust network it would buy from 3Com. “Networking costs would’ve been 20% to 25% higher without the \"Communications was the primary challenge.

Along the way, Edwards used refurbished equipment where there was an immediate need. “We had to save money wherev- Tough decisions Continental Airlines network ar¬ chitect Bob Edwards is credited by one employee as willing to make tough decisions in the middle of wide-sweeping proj¬ ects. “We had some Novell LANs but were rolling out Windows 95 at the desktop — and Office 97 — so Bob decided to go with Microsoft’s [network operating system] in place of Novell’s,” said Bob Hogoboom, a onetime Continental mechanic who is now a systems analyst. “That threw a wrench in the rollout because it required a different er we could,” he said. After selling the board of di¬ rectors on the need for a high- tech communications system, ■N, •• ..nti'\" ,1 funds were approved for the post-loaner network. “Communications was the primary challenge,” Edwards said. “But we also wanted to make sure we had a common in¬ frastructure that would provide access to everything our workers needed.” Continental began building its network about 17 months ago, linking every desktop in the four-building complex. It should be completed by year’s end. Airports and reservation centers are also part of Conti¬ nental’s networking vision of the future. The company chose to use 3Com shared Token Ring hubs and switching, which will fun¬ nel LAN traffic onto a Fiber Dis¬ tributed Data Interface (FDDI) backbone. Soon the firm will deploy To¬ ken Ring switching to the desk¬ top, which hasn’t been done widely because the technology was late in blooming. “The network will let us flexi¬ bly segment users for quick ac¬ cess to servers and mainframes,” Edwards said. TOKEN RING HUBS The largest building in the network alone uses 41 AT&T Corp. and 1 Compaq Computer Corp. servers. Token Ring hubs are used at five nationwide reser¬ vation centers and in 8SPOB 10 airports, which are linked to Houston via a frame relay wide-area network. Users can use the network to commu¬ nicate with Continen¬ tal’s IBM and Amdahl Corp. mainframes in Charlotte, N.C. The airline quickly deployed campuswide Microsoft Corp.’s Ex¬ change electronic mail and Mi¬ crosoft’s Schedule Plus work¬ group scheduling and task management applications on the network. It also uses the LAN to automatically download booking and scheduling data nightly at 100M bit/sec. from its host computers to its revenue management system. “What once took several hours now takes 10 minutes,” Edwards said. “The chances of errors [occurring] during 10 minutes is far smaller. And we can transfer this data in the mid¬ dle of the day instead of catch¬ ing up the next day.” □ skill set, but it definitely helped us to standard¬ ize on one vendor.” “When we receive mandated changes that need to be implement¬ ed in short time periods and require participation from people at multiple levels, work¬ groups shorten the time needed to comply,” Hogoboom said. “Just having the communica¬ tions capability was a tremen¬ dous leap forward for us.” But the work doesn’t stop there for Edwards, who is contin¬ ually looking at ways to save money without compromising quality. Edwards is looking into Edwards is continually looking for ways to save money without compromising network computers as a way to reduce desktop costs and shops for deals that save Conti¬ nental money on hubs. “We need to bring the cost of desk¬ tops computers down,” he said. When asked how he man¬ ages to keep saving money on networking gear, Edwards said, “We negotiate hard and cut some deals.” — Bob Wallace Switches to protect Bay users By Bob Wallace BAY NETWORKS, INC. USerS soon will be able to protect their desktop-to-data center LAN ca¬ bling scheme using new mod¬ ules for the vendor’s high-end System 5000 data center switch. In the early 1990s, countless users connected PCs to main¬ frame applications by wiring them directly to data center switches rather than through in¬ termediary hubs as is common now. But those direct connections provide only 10M bit/sec. of bandwidth. Moving to higher- bandwidth Ethernet links could require replacing data center switches with switches that can support 10M/100M bit/sec. links. “Users’ choices were simple: rip out all their wiring and reca¬ ble the facility or throw out the data center switch that can’t sup¬ port the higher speeds,” said Tom Nolle, president of CIMI Corp., a consulting and research firm in Voorhees, N.J. OTHER OPTION But information systems man¬ agers at firms that use Bay’s Sys¬ tem 5000 data center switch — about 35,000 of which have shipped — can dodge that choice by using System 5000 Autosense Ethernet/ Fast Ether¬ net modules. The modules, which will debut next week, let PCs connect to the 5000 at ei¬ ther 10M or 100M bit/sec. with¬ out making changes at either end. One module has 24 ports that can run at 10M or 100M bit/sec. A second module has 20 ports for twisted-pair connections and two 100M bit/sec. ports for fi¬ ber. Bay also will ship an Ether¬ net/Fast Ethernet Network Man¬ agement Module that lets users manage 10M bit/sec. Ethernet and 100M bit/sec. Fast Ethernet segments. One of the Bay modules costs $200 per port. A competing 10M/100M bit/sec. data center switch module from Cisco Sys¬ tems, Inc. costs $800 per port. □ Bay joins others in giving users network access to mainframe data.

While computer snafus have been hidden inside companies for years, putting applications up on the World Wide Web makes them intensely public. A major credit-reporting agency discovered that recently when 200 credit reports were elec¬ tronically sent to the wrong cus¬ tomers. “The sense of urgency to get on the World Wide Web is very high,” said William H. Murray, an information systems security consultant to Deloitte & Touche in Wilton, Conn. “But this is an area where it’s incredibly easy to make grotesque errors.” MAD RUSH Officials at Experian, Inc. in Al¬ len, Texas, said the company’s Web site worked fine in its first few days, when the service was unpublicized and volume was light. But after news reports about the site appeared, an unexpect¬ ed flood of more than 2,000 requests over ii hours triggered a soft¬ ware glitch that mis¬ directed the credit data, said Martin Abrams, vice president of information policy. The site has been shut down until the bugs can be fixed. “It’s hard in the cur¬ rent Internet environ¬ ment to understand what the demands are going to be,” Abrams said. While Experian is¬ sues millions of credit reports annually to businesses and indi¬ viduals, the company believed Internet requests initially would be small because it hadn’t even promoted the service on its own home page, let alone outside the firm. “They didn’t plan for suc¬ cess,” Murray said. Experian, which was formed by the merger of CCN Group and TRW Information Systems & Services last year, launched its Web service after receiving more than 20,000 electronic- mail requests for online access to credit reports, Abrams said. A great deal of security was put on the site, he said, includ¬ ing the ability to encrypt data as it crossed the Internet and a fire¬ wall to protect the core database. Customers needed two credit- card account numbers and a Social Security number to ac¬ cess their data; and the resulting reports didn’t contain complete account numbers so as to make it difficult for data to be used to commit fraud. Many privacy advocates are concerned about posting financial data on the Inter¬ net, even if misdirection er¬ rors are fixed. Experian likely will offer consum¬ ers a way to ask that their credit reports be kept off . the Web, Abrams said. Experts disagree about whether current technol¬ ogy lets consumers safely access sensitive financial data on the Web. Many say the information, if encrypted, is generally pro¬ tected from eavesdroppers as it crosses the Internet. But proving that consumers are who they claim to be when requesting personalized reports is more dicey. ADAMS Enterprise management stays elusive By Patrick Dryden Washington take charge of vital business processes to lower costs, serve users and keep the company competitive. That was the mes¬ sage delivered repeatedly to at¬ tendees at last week’s Enterprise Management Summit confer¬ ence here. But that’s easier said than done, according to many IS managers who attended the conference. “The ends are clear, but not the means,” said John McCon¬ nell, head of McConnell Con¬ sulting, Inc. in Boulder, Colo. Vendors, just like the groups within an informa¬ tion systems orga¬ nization, still focus on managing just one piece of an enterprise instead of working together to deliver an appli¬ cation and ensure its performance, McConnell said. Enterprise man¬ agement remains largely uncertain, almost like build¬ ing the Transconti¬ nental Railway, McConnell said. “You hope it works, but right now it doesn’t appear these tracks will meet,” he said. Anyone tackling integrated management must overcome “big problems in all three areas — technology, processes and people — or else your project is doomed,” said Aaron Cheng, operations manager at Ontario Hydro in Toronto. MULTIPLE PROBLEMS Struggles for Cheng have so far included extending mainframe disciplines to the distributed en¬ vironment; writing custom soft¬ ware to integrate key tools and automate tasks; merging six support groups into one center; and arbitrating staff reductions with un¬ ions for 17 months. Those struggles, begun in February 1994, aren’t over, but they are paying off. Cheng said the utility slashed help desk response time from eight hours to one hour and cut problem resolution from 16 hours to eight. Operating costs plunged about $1 million per year. IS can handle 350% more management tasks with only 30% more cost. At First USA Bank in Wil¬ mington, Del., the sessions on setting service levels and man¬ aging applications got old quick¬ ly for Steve Pirollo, a systems administrator at the company. “We know that’s important, but we’re still faced with prob¬ lems making it happen,” he said. Pirollo took the “common sense approach” by setting his TME 10 enterprise manage¬ ment console to warn which user service is in trouble instead of merely displaying which server is down, for example. But Pirollo said he can’t find experts to help with the complex new software from Tivoli Sys¬ tems, Inc. And he must over¬ come familiar roadblocks, such as getting others to buy in to IS management goals. Juggling expertise also is a challenge at Duke Energy Co. in Charlotte, N.C., said senior net¬ work analyst Paul Edmunds. “We’re trying to combine all the management pieces to sup¬ port business objectives, but it’s tough to pull together disparate groups and to take on this project with a shrinking staff,” Edmunds said. Besides having to deal with such recurring operational problems, IS must try to find and apply tools that can cover all levels of complex client/server environments, said Eric Roy, a “User authentication is still a huge obstacle,” said Peter Neu¬ mann, principal scientist at SRI International, Inc. in Menlo Park, Calif., and moderator of the Internet Risks Forum news- group. PRIVACY ISSUES A Social Security Administra¬ tion Web service that let tax¬ payers check earnings histories and estimated future benefits sparked a furor over concerns about improper access to private financial information. User names and passwords given to customers off-line may be enough security for online banking and stock trading, where transactions are limited. But delays in setting up off¬ line passwords make them im¬ practical for onetime informa¬ tion requests where the whole point is to offer instant access to data. “Until public certificate sys¬ tems are widely used, the Web is not suitable for those kinds of applications,” said Philip Card¬ en, a managing consultant at The Registry, Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.D network analyst at Quebec Tele¬ phone in Rimouski, Quebec. “No product yet can give us a view of application performance all the way from end to end,” Roy said. □ Service sooner or later Vendors at the Enterprise Management Summit conference prom¬ ised several ways to help IS managers deliver quality service to end users. ►Tivoli Systems, Inc. pledged to evolve its TME io enterprise management framework to Java, but no timetable or partner support was offered. The goal is to let operators control any part of the multivendor network, system and application mix from any location. ► Computer Associates International, Inc. last month launched a Java-based interface to its Unicenter TNG. That’s part of a deal CA announced last week that bundles part of its enterprise man¬ agement suite with the new Enterprise 450 workgroup server from Sun Microsystems, Inc. ► Microsoft Corp. previewed a variety of management capabilities that will be built in to future versions of its operating system software. The company’s goal is to lower the cost of maintaining distributed systems by enabling such tasks as performance monitoring across an intranet without a central management platform. ►New York-based Micromuse, Inc. introduced a service-level management option linking its NetCool event-correlation tool with the OpenView network manager from Hewlett-Packard Co. ►Concord Communications, Inc. in Marlboro, Mass., this week will release versions of its Network Health performance report- ingtools that run on Windows NT. ►Also this week, International Network Services in Sunnyvale, Calif., will boost its EnterprisePro performance management ser¬ vice to monitor bigger networks and project trends for a year. ►The Distributed Computing Infrastructure group at Deloitte & Touche next month plans to introduce a consulting service to help users implement Tivoli’s TMEio. — Patrick Dryden Juggling manage¬ ment expertise with shrinking staff is a challenge 50,000 Concurrent Users. 16 Million Messages per Day.

That is, don’t trust walls; don’t trust locks; don’t trust people. The credit-information company that used to be called TRW knows that rule very well. Good thing, too. Because when the company — which now calls itself Experian — decided to let consumers see their credit reports on the Internet, a healthy dollop of paranoia is all that kept a security failure from be¬ coming a catastrophe. SWAMPED SITE Experian quietly launched the service on Wednesday, Aug. 13. By Friday morning, the Washington Post discovered it and ran a story. Within hours the site (www. experian.com) was overwhelmed with nearly 2,000 requests — far more than the company expected or the Web-based credit-report application was designed to handle (see story page 6). Worse still, that unscheduled stress test turned up a bug: When the system failed, it showed each consumer’s credit report to a different consumer. The credit report of a man in San Jose, Calif., went to a wine consultant in Napa. The wine consultant’s credit history went to a grocery store manager in Plymouth, Security rule No. 2: If you've got a security breach, try not to make a reporter one of the victims. Mass. His financial dope went to a re¬ porter in New York City, whose credit in¬ formation ended up in the hands of a management consultant in Columbia, Md. Second rule of security: If you’ve got a security breach, try not to make a report¬ er one of the victims. By Friday afternoon Experian had pulled the plug, but the story of its security failure was already on its way to newspapers across the country. The irony is that none of Experian’ s se¬ curity systems failed. And Experian had piled on the securi¬ ty. There were firewalls to keep out hack¬ ers and crackers. Encryption to protect the credit information on its way across the Internet. Extra verification to prevent \"identity thieves” from ordering some¬ one else’s credit report. It all worked, too. So far as Experian can tell, every one of the more than 200 credit reports that were sent electronical¬ ly was properly authorized and securely transmitted. They just went to the wrong people. So how did the foul-up happen? The company is still doing its postmortem, which includes contacting all those customers to find out who got which credit report. But it looks like with the big surge in requests — much bigger than Experian had tested for — the re¬ ports queued up for delivery in the wrong order. It was a weird interaction between sub¬ systems, the kind of subtle bug that has to be shaken out of lots of new systems. Except that, in the past, it was Experian employees — the system’s users — who would have first spotted the mismatched information. With the Web-based appli¬ cation, the bug-spotting users were wine consultants and grocery store managers and newspaper reporters — Experian’s Internet customers. That’s embarrassing. But it probably would have been much, much worse ex¬ cept for one thing: Even with all that se¬ curity in place, Experian still didn’t trust the system. The company monitored the site, not just for performance but just to make sure nothing unusual happened. After all, even with heavy testing and heavier security, a little paranoia never hurt anybody. And when request volumes skyrocket¬ ed on Friday morning, Experian spotted the misdirected reports and shut down the sendee after only 213 reports were de¬ livered. Not 20,000. Not even 2,000. And what might have been a confiden¬ tiality catastrophe was contained to a small-scale screw-up for Experian — and an object lesson for every I S shop that wants to put applications on the Internet: No matter how good your technology is, don’t trust it. Because on the Web — just like everywhere else — only the (slightly) paranoid survive. □ Hayes is Computerworld’s staff columnist. His Internet address isfrank_ hayes@ cw.com. BT/MCI deal still on MCI Communications Corp. and British Telecommuni¬ cations PLC on Friday said they will go ahead with the merger to create Concert PLC, but BT is paying 20% less than the companies announced late last year. The reduction brings BT’s purchase price to between $16 billion and $17 billion — down from nearly $21 billion, BT officials said. The adjustment came after MCI an¬ nounced it would lose $800 million this year as a result of its foray into local U.S. telephone markets. Cray wins dumping claim The U.S. Department of Commerce wants Japanese supercomputer makers Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. to pay huge tariffs on future supercomputer sales because they dumped low-priced systems in the U.S. and harmed competitor Cray Research, Inc. Cray was bought by Silicon Graphics, Inc. in Mountain View, Calif. The tariffs could range from 1.5 to 4.5 times the list price of their supercomputers. The International Trade Commission will make a final decision on the tar¬ iffs in October. McAfee denies Symantec claim McAfee Associates, Inc. disputed a claim by antivirus rival Symantec Corp. that McAfee had stolen code for its VirusScan software. McAfee said that allegedly cop¬ ied code found by a Symantec contractor was actually fewer than 100 lines and was part of a version of VirusScan that never shipped. Symantec responded that McAfee has acknowledged copying code. McAfee said a former Symantec employee “inadvertently” brought Symantec code to McAfee, but it was erased and wasn’t used. Symantec called that potential de¬ struction of evidence.

Novell runs into red ink Novell, Inc. last week reported a third-quarter loss of $121.7 million, compared with earnings of $58.8 million for the same period last year. The loss includes a $55 million restructuring charge. Revenue plummeted from $365.1 million to $90.1 million. CEO Eric Schmidt said the revenue drop was a onetime phenomenon caused by Novell’s decision to reduce its backlog of products sitting in the distribution channel.

The FTC criticized an Australian com¬ pany, Intemic Software, for registering Internet domain names at its www. intemic.com site. InterNIC, a separate en¬ terprise run by a company called Net¬ work Solutions, Inc. has authority from the National Science Foundation to regis¬ ter domain names as well as to keep track of them and resolve conflicts. It uses www.intemic.net. Some companies are increasingly concerned that imposters, com¬ petitors or malicious hackers could set up sites with URLs similar to those of legitimate businesses. Using a “virtually identical” domain name and providing “nearly identical do¬ main registration services ... is likely to create a false impression that the site is owned and operated [by] Network Solu¬ tions,” the FTC concluded. Other businesses can serve as brokers to take domain registration requests, but the Australian company was charging $250 vs. the $100 InterNIC registration fee. Flerndon, Va.-based Network Solu¬ tions accused the intemic.com site of not paying for the registration requests of more than half the 2,000 orders it has re¬ ceived. “In our view, Intemic Software is . . . offering the same service at more than twice the price,” said David M. Graves, Network Solutions’ Internet business manager, in a letter to the FTC. “Network Solutions has received numerous com¬ plaints from users of the Internet and registrants of domain names [about www.intemic.com].” This is the second time the FTC has dealt with the thorny issue of similar and potentially misleading uniform resource locators (URL). The FTC previously criti¬ cized a pornographic site at www. nasa.com, concerned that children seek¬ ing photos from the popular NASA Mars mission might try the .com site instead of NASA’s actual URL at uww.raisa.gov. The nasa.com site was shut down after complaints. \"What will be interesting to see is what kind of jurisdiction they will be able to come up with” in the InterNIC dis¬ pute, said Marcelo Halpern, an associate at the Gordon & Glickson law firm in Chicago. The NASA case was more straightforward because a law protecting the use of the NASA name had been vio¬ lated. The FTC said it has notified the Aus¬ tralian Competition and Consumer Com¬ mission about the intemic.com site, and it is investigating. Some companies are increasingly concerned that impostors, competitors or malicious hackers could set up sites with URLs similar to those of legitimate businesses. This would be an easy way to siphon off unsuspecting customers, offend them or misdirect orders. Worry mount¬ ed with plans to increase available URLs by adding registries such as .firm and .store to the existing top-level domain names. The internic.com site includes dis¬ claimers that it isn’t affiliated with Inter¬ NIC and Network Solutions, but the FTC said those weren’t sufficient. □ Take Out the Gues. with...

But some analysts have expressed skepticism, noting the vast array of hard¬ ware and software that must be brought in line by multiple parties before true compliance can be achieved. For more than a year, the two com¬ panies have issued a combined 200,000 post-1999 credit cards to employees to test and ensure that credit-card readers are year 2000-compliant. Test results show that at least 98% of the merchants that use credit cards are compliant; 99.9% compliance is expect¬ ed by year’s end. One analyst is skeptical of claims from Visa International, Inc. in San Mateo, Calif., and MasterCard International, Inc. in Purchase, N.Y., that most — if not all — point-of-sale (POS) systems will be year 2000-ready by the end of the year. That’s a heady goal, because 3.6 mil¬ lion merchants in the U.S. work with Visa and/or MasterCard, said George Kivel, an analyst at The Tower Group, a financial services and technology consul¬ tancy in Newton, Mass. Most shops lease their POS equipment from member banks that will be respon¬ sible for resolving hardware and software programming issues with third-party vendors, Kivel said. “Visa might be claiming that they’ve certified all their [member] banks and de¬ vices, but I don’t believe that’s possible,” he said. “There are too many devices out there for that to be done” in time. THREE-YEAR PROJECT MasterCard and Visa said they have worked with member banks and third- party vendors since 1994 on the issue and have spent three years replacing POS systems and upgrading software. In fact, Visa earlier this year imposed deadlines and threatened fines if mem¬ ber banks and merchants didn’t solve their year 2000 problems by April 30. “I can’t say there won’t be isolated inci¬ dences, but overall we don’t think con¬ sumers will be inconvenienced,” said Visa spokesman Greg Jones. Both card companies will advise banks to roll out the post-1999 cards slowly and continue testing to ensure that no problems arise. Member banks such as New York- based The Chase Manhattan Bank Corp. worked with Visa and MasterCard to hammer out POS and automated teller machine acceptance for post-1999 dated cards. But there’s still “a myriad” of credit-card-related applications and pro¬ cesses that Chase has to smooth out in order to support its 17,000 customer ac¬ counts, said Joseph LaRocco, senior vice president of Chase Cardmember Ser¬ vices in Hicksville, N.Y. Chase will issue credit cards with expi¬ ration dates beyond 1999 beginning in October. For example, Chase, the nation’s big¬ gest bank, outsources credit-card authori¬ zation services and other transaction pro¬ cesses to First Data Resources in Omaha. LaRocco said Chase and First Data expect to make their interdependent systems year 2000-ready by the end of 1998. That will leave 1999 open for testing. “This is above and beyond what Visa and MasterCard are doing” for credit- card acceptance, LaRocco said. American Express Co. in New York is still working with merchants on the issue and hasn’t issued cards with expiration dates beyond 1999, a spokeswoman said. She wouldn’t say when American Ex¬ press and its partners will reach full com¬ pliance. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Corp.’s Discover Card is working on compliance and will start issuing year 2000 cards by year’s end, said a Discover spokeswoman who declined to give further details. □ ELEPHANT RIDING A Bruise missile.

Last week, IBM rolled out its long-awaited 600 series, called the AS/400E. The “E” stands for electronic commerce, to highlight the AS/400’s capabili¬ ties in that area to new users. Running on the new RISC- based Apache PowerPC chip, the AS/400E will scale up to 12 processors [CW, Jan. 20], pro¬ vide new high-availability fea¬ tures for critical applications [CW, June 16], bundle OS/400 Version 4, Re¬ lease 1 and pre¬ load major appli¬ cation suites in some custom systems. “IBM is moving in the right direction,” said Eli Sinyak, di¬ rector of branch operations at American General Finance Corp., an AS/400 shop in Ev¬ ansville, Ind. \"We are in the planning stages to move from our old CISC machines to the new RISC technology.” More important for many ex¬ isting users, though, is IBM’s plan to optimize certain AS/ 400E systems to run preloaded application suites from J. D. Ed- SB1-2310 ♦Includes OS/400 Version 4, Release 1 wards & Co. in Denver, Systems Software Associates, Inc. in Chi¬ cago and SAP AG. In fact, that alone may keep some existing users from actually moving off the platform. “If they had not done this, we might have moved” to either a Unix or Windows NT client/ server platform, said Al Sussman, vice president of information technology at Rol- lerblade, Inc. in Minnetonka, Minn. The in-line skate maker runs a suite of J. D. Edwards applica¬ tions on the AS/400 but wanted to move from the old host-based approach to J. D. Edwards’ up¬ dated, client/server method. \"To hear that they are helping us to coexist with older pro¬ grams, that makes sense,” Suss¬ man said. \"We are more wedded to J. D. Edwards software than the AS/400, but I would have been disappointed to move away from it.” A new integrated firewall and Internet user access control will bolster existing World Wide Web server capabilities on the AS/400. FUTURE ENDEAVORS But most of the electronic- commerce technology will come early next year, when IBM plans to deliver a Java Virtual Machine native to OS/400 and a native version of Lotus Development Corp.’s Domino Internet group- ware system. So it remains to be seen whether many users running Unix and Windows NT servers will decide to switch to the AS/400. “It is not sexy, exciting technology,” Sussman said. “But what they do works really well.” □ IBM to show off SAP R/3 preinstalled on AS/400. Page 55 By Patrick Dryden platinum Technology, Inc. previewed its entry in the inte¬ grated enterprise management wars at its user conference last week in New Orleans. Platinum plans to bundle nine newly integrated tools into a suite called Provision, focused on multiplatform database and systems management. The core package, due in Oc¬ tober, will be aggressively priced and will double in size by year’s end, said officials at Platinum in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill. “This built-in integration of strong point products is a good way to move up to compete with the enterprise management framework leaders,” said Herb VanHook, an analyst at Meta Group, Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. ONE STEP AT A TIME Provision offers the benefits of tool integration incrementally, VanHook said, so users don’t need underlying software such as Unicenter TNG from Com¬ puter Associates International, Inc., OpenView from Hewlett- Packard Co. or TME 10 from Tivoli Systems, Inc. A CA spokesman discounted the Platinum effort. “They are too late to the enterprise man¬ agement game to make any dif¬ ference,” said Reuven Battat, se¬ nior vice president at CA in Islandia, N.Y. Platinum’s promised integra¬ tion capability — free with up¬ grades for individual tools — mostly benefits those who al¬ ready run some of the compa¬ ny’s 140 products, users and an¬ alysts said. The enhanced tools can ex¬ change events and alerts through built-in messaging and a common user interface. That means managers can easily chain together tasks per¬ formed by specific tools. “Most shops rely on selected point tools even though it makes more sense to tie them together. However, I prefer to have integration built in than to deal with unknowns like a framework and other vendor pieces,” said Platinum user John Randle, operations support manager at Yellow Services, Inc. in Overland Park, Kan. Randle’s group currently runs two Platinum tools to schedule jobs and exchange files among mainframe and distributed systems. Database administrators run other Platinum tools to main¬ tain the trucking firm’s business transactions. Integration means that, for the first time, “my operators could see a database problem during the night shift and the [database administrators] can have access to our scheduling,” Randle said. □ ELECTRONIC COMMERCE Internet mail savings CONTINUED FROM COVER 1 _ Costs: Internet mail vs. client/server mail Cost element (per user) Internet messaging Client/server messaging Annual administration $38.46 $67.57 End-user training $100 $400 Annual directory $9.00 $9.50 maintenance $11.90 $52.08 Texas Instruments, Inc. in Plano, Texas, has slashed its maintenance costs by moving 27,000 users to Internet mail over 14 months, said Evan Mill¬ er, project manager at TI. But the company had to bulk up on programmers to write manage¬ ment utilities, which weren’t in¬ cluded with the Internet mail software it purchased. In spite of the additional pro¬ gramming staff, Miller estimat¬ ed that TI is spending between one-ninth and one-fourth of what it would cost to run a pro¬ prietary mail network. “Messag¬ ing costs for a company our size could easily run $10 million a year, and we’re not spending anywhere near that,” he said. TI uses Internet mail clients from Banyan Systems, Inc., Net¬ scape Communications Corp. and Qualcomm, Inc. It uses servers from Sun Microsystems, Inc. and Software.com, Inc. Meanwhile, traditional elec¬ tronic mail such as Lotus Devel¬ opment Corp.’s Notes, Micro¬ soft Corp.’s Exchange and Novell, Inc.’s GroupWise are quickly gaining IP hooks. But Miller said those offer¬ ings still have some proprietary baggage not found in products that were built to run on I P. Wright Medical Technology, Inc., an Arlington, Tenn.-based manufacturer of artificial joints, is moving about 400 users from Lotus’ Cc:Mail to Sun’s Internet Mail Server. According to Robert Massey, engineering systems adminis¬ trator, Wright will be able to Fixed server costs Source: Creative Networks, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif. move from two Cc:Mail servers to one Sun server. And the Inter¬ net mail system will give users closer ties to the company’s 75 employees who use Unix-based Internet mail. Plus, workers will be able to easily download their mail remotely. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Cre¬ ative Networks, Inc. estimated that companies can save be¬ tween $367 and $406 per user in the first year by using a mes¬ saging system based on TCP/IP. But Brad Harding, an analyst at Ferris Research, Inc. in San Francisco, said the Internet mail picture may be somewhat de¬ ceiving. “There are big holes in functionality with Internet mail,” he said. For example, most Internet mail servers lack built-in moni¬ toring tools that detect lost mes¬ sages or heavy traffic spikes, he said. As a result, companies must either live with fewer fea¬ tures or invest in customizing the system to better meet their needs. TI had to shore up its messag¬ ing system with management tools and software to link the new system to the company’s legacy mainframe system. There was also a lot of unfore¬ seen integration work that need¬ ed to be done, Miller said. Mail systems based on the In¬ ternet’s Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) also are seen as less secure than systems that run on proprietary networks (see related story, page cover 1). For that reason, some sites have maintained an X.400 link to business partners and moved daily mail traffic to SMTP. Down the road, the widespread adoption of encryption technol¬ ogy such as Secure Multipur¬ pose Internet Extensions should make Internet mail more bullet¬ proof, users said. □ © Micro Focus 1 997.

At its core, CorelCentral will have a universal in-basket, workflow, personal information management, push technology and a browser-like interface. Much of the technology devel¬ oped for the Java- based Office will be used in it, Skillen said. The Java -based up¬ grade to CorelCentral is planned for release next summer. Corel is banking on three main products to break into the enterprise: WordPerfect Suite, CorelCentral and a prod¬ uct code-named Remagen that will let multiple users access copies of WordPerfect or Micro¬ soft Corp.’s Office from a server through a Java-enabled browser. Microsoft is using a similar strategy by licensing WinFrame from Citrix Systems, Inc. to let multiple users access copies of applications running on Win¬ dows NT Server [CW, May 19]. FIRST OUT OF THE GATE Corel was one of the first ven¬ dors outside of Sun Microsys¬ tems, Inc. to embrace Java. The company released a beta version of the Office suite in April. That gave hope to Java proponents, but the suite was panned for be¬ ing too slow and rife with bugs. Ultimately, analysts said, Corel’s gumption to run with Java before the market matured has left the company standing alone in an empty field. Micro¬ soft has been rumored to be de¬ veloping a version of Office writ¬ ten in Java but has never confirmed the reports. Jeffrey Tarter, an analyst and editor of the computer trends newsletter “Softletter” in Water- town, Mass., said Corel simply missed the mark. “I think this was a case of shoot first and then aim,” he said. “It’s not clear why anyone would want a Java version of Office.” Some users agreed that they simply weren’t asking for a Java- based Office. “We’re big WordPerfect us¬ ers,” said one assistant MIS manager at a West Coast law firm with more than 3,500 WordPerfect Suite seats. “We love the product.” But she said her company never understood where Corel was trying to go with its Java version. Analysts said Corel’s short¬ comings on a Java Office shouldn’t reflect badly on Java. With its latest move to go head-to-head with Microsoft and Citrix, Corel is stepping into rough waters, said Greg Blatnik, an analyst at Zona Research, Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. “Corel has a tough challenge. They’re up against Microsoft, they’re looking for new territo¬ ry,” Blatnik said. “And jumping up to an area that Citrix pretty much owns is maybe not going to give them an easy road either. Maybe they need to scratch their heads a little more about where the opportunities exist.” □ Staff writer Patrick Thibodeau contributed to this story. APPLICATION SUITES • Sapphire user conference SAP tries to beef up R/3 manageability By Randy Weston sap ag and its partners will be working overtime at this year’s Sapphire user group conference to shed R/3’s reputation as an out-of-control monster that’s difficult to manage. The German software giant and a slew of third-party ven¬ dors and consulting firms will promote new functionality for R/3 that is intended to expand the enterprise planning pack¬ age’s reach. SAP also will promote en¬ hancements to Business Engi¬ neer, a tool used to configure R/3 to a company’s needs. The enhancements are intended to ease installations. “SAP wants to get embedded in tlie DNA of the enterprise,” said Bruce Richardson, an ana¬ lyst at Advanced Manufacturing Research, Inc. in Boston. “They want to increase the number of R/3 users, increase the number of applications and get into more industries. SAP wants to be at all ends of the supply web.” THIRD-PARTY EFFORTS SAP won’t be alone in its efforts as 10,000 of its customers de¬ scend on Orlando, Fla., this week. Third-party vendors and implementation firms, includ¬ ing the major consulting firms, will be on hand to promote their R/3-optimized products and in¬ stallation practices. Richardson and other ana¬ lysts agree R/3 is getting easier to install, mainly because of new tools from SAP and third par¬ ties. Also, many consultants have several years of experience with the product, which speeds up the learning curve. But the analysts also warned that R/3 is still a giant and get¬ ting bigger all the time. “It’s still nothing that you take out of a box and go right to work,” Richardson said. “It never will be at that point. It’s gone from a migraine to a headache. Just because it is easi¬ er to install doesn’t mean users have to be any less smart about how to go about putting it in or using it.” R/3 STILL NOT EASY Robert Rubin, vice president of information systems at Elf Auto- chem North America, Inc. in Philadelphia, agreed that R/3 is easier to manage but said it still requires lots of work. The $2 bil¬ lion chemical company is wrap¬ ping up its R/3 installation and focusing on building links to other company software sys¬ tems, such as health, environ¬ ment and safety. “It’s easier today than it was two years ago to link to R/3, but it is not easy by any stretch of the imagination,” Rubin said. “Today, we are trying to de¬ cide the best way of doing it. We have a pilot facility that we are using to investigate the logical progression to share informa¬ tion between systems,” he said.D Announcements set for Sapphire this week include: | Demonstrations and further details of Internet commerce systems | Details about new supply-chain management functions to come with R/3 4.0 g Details about an integrated data warehouse for R/3 | SAP's product configurator built into R/3 | Integration of Business Engineer R/3 configuration system with software from IntelliCorp I Details from IBM on network computers that run R/3, and the delivery of R/3 preinstalled on AS/400 machines g Seosrate announcements from IBM’s consulting arm and KPMG Peat Marwick on new programs to preconfigure R/3 for specific industries Win 98 interface may trip users, beta testers say By April Jacobs many windows 98 beta test¬ ers said they are pleased with improvements in boot time and remote management features, but some said average users may have difficulty finding their way around the operating sys¬ tem’s browser-like interface. Key changes to Windows 98, which is due in the first quarter of next year from Microsoft Corp., include better remote and configuration management that lets network administrators service a user’s machine with¬ out going out to the desktop. It will also feature tight inte¬ gration with Microsoft’s brows¬ er, Internet Explorer, letting us¬ ers toggle between the Internet and desktop functions without changing interfaces. NEEDS SOME WORK Beta tester Dave Adams Saltz, a consultant at Genesis Partners, Inc., a computer consultancy in Waltham, Mass., said those changes will make users more productive and cut support costs for businesses. But he said Mi¬ crosoft still must make the user interface more intuitive. According to Saltz, Windows 98 is far better than Windows 95 with respect to support is¬ sues because it won’t force sys¬ tems administrators to make changes and fixes at a user’s desktop — which can be a seri¬ ous issue as the number of us¬ ers in a company grows. “The common driver model, which allows developers to write a single driver for Windows 98 and Windows NT, is a huge ben¬ efit in terms of saving time and reducing support costs because there will be fewer compatibility issues,” he said. “Users can also open up multiple applications and have the system stay stable,” Saltz said. Microsoft spokewoman Sta¬ cey Breyfogle and analysts inter¬ viewed for this story said users with older hardware and legacy 16-bit software can make an eas¬ ier transition from Windows 3.1 to Windows 98 than if they go directly to Windows NT 4.0 Workstation. This is because Windows NT Workstation re¬ quires more memory and pro¬ cessing power. And while some beta testers found the new browser-like in¬ terface a little difficult to handle — they were worried it may re¬ quire more training time than Windows 95 did — others found it easy to use. Frank Isaacs, a software devel¬ oper at ExaSystems, Inc. in Ra¬ leigh, N.C., said he doesn’t think training will be an issue. “End users don’t want to have to think about going to several different places to find informa¬ tion. With Windows 98, they don’t have to,” he said. He noted that messaging and Internet newsgroups, as well as files, can be accessed from a single inter¬ face. □ IRBA ©1997 Forte Software, Inc.

Computerworld A ugust 2 5, 1 997 (www.computerworld.com) Oaiwa finds plenty to recommend Java CONTINUED FROM COVER 1 _ Java performance may not be the greatest right now, but Dai- wa is willing to be patient be¬ cause the company thinks its de¬ velopers will be able to write applications faster with the in¬ creasingly popular object-orient¬ ed programming language. “It’s much cheaper for me to spend $2,500 on a hot-shot PC that’ll run Java applications quicker than spend $50,000 to $100,000 for an extra program¬ mer to write code,” said Jeffry Borror, director of IT at Daiwa Securities America. But that may not be the case for companies in other indus¬ tries, one analyst warned. “The beauty about trading systems and financial systems that’s unique is the payback comes very quickly,” said Mike Kenne¬ dy, an analyst at Meta Group, Inc. in Burlingame, Calif. “These are applications that have very high dollar volume as¬ sociated with each transaction, and the need to be able to change your business processes quickly is of paramount impor¬ tance. But not every business is willing to pay the same costs for their business applications,” Kennedy said. THE JAVA ROUTE Daiwa is nearing rollout of two Java applications: a trade pro¬ cessing system that routes busi¬ ness transactions to different processing locations in “air traf¬ fic controller” fashion, and a trading system for the compa¬ ny’s Japanese equities desk. Java’s cross-platform nature is important because pieces of the application run on different ma¬ chines and operating systems, Borror said. For example, with the “air traffic controller” application, trades are entered on custom¬ ers’ PCs that typically run Win¬ dows 95. That information must be routed across the network to a Unix database server for trade validation and processing. For record-keeping purposes, the transaction must be forwarded to the company’s back-office mainframe operation in Wal¬ tham, Mass. With the Japanese equities ap¬ plication, the company is elimi¬ nating several manual steps of data entry and reentry on a vari¬ ety of machines. “As these manual steps are automated with the Java applica¬ tion, the speed and accuracy of the trade-entry process increase, freeing the traders to trade,” Borror said. He said he realizes Java isn’t perfect. With the early version, he had to endure a lack of fea¬ tures and development tools. Performance still lags behind C++, although improvements to just-in-time compilers and vir¬ tual machines are helping. “To be frank, I’m not sure it'll ever run as fast as C++,” Borror said. “But I’ll pay a reasonable performance penalty — 20% to 25%, or even 50% — to get the cross-platform capabilities and the cleanliness of the object model.” Since the 1980s, Wall Street has loved the Unix operating system and the C++ program¬ ming language because of the application power they provide, Borror said. As rivals fill out lines, Toshiba share drops By Kim Girard and Wylie Wong rankings in the portable PC market are shifting as users take advantage of perked-up product lines and cranked-up competition. Although Toshiba Corp. still ranks as the top notebook ven¬ dor, rivals IBM and Compaq Computer Corp. are quickly Analysts say the race among the top three portable PC vendors will tighten during the last half of this year. closing in, according to prelimi¬ nary market estimates by Inter¬ national Data Corp. (I DC) in Framingham, Mass. Toshiba’s numbers fell this quarter, to 17.8% of the market, because the company pumped too many computers into the channel during the first quarter that they couldn’t sell, said Ken Dulaney, an analyst at Gartner Group, Inc. in San Jose, Calif. “Any time someone’s suc¬ cessful, they tend to become too arrogant, push on the accelera¬ tor, let off and it blows up in their face,” Dulaney said. Toshiba has lost 5.9% of the market over the past year. But the company isn’t expected to move from its top spot any time soon. During that time, IBM’s market share has grown from 12.9% to 14%. Compaq is third with 11.2%, up 3.9% from last year’s second quarter. “A year ago, a lot of the bigger players like IBM and Compaq didn’t really have full, competi¬ tive available product lines,” said analyst Bruce Stephen, at I DC. They do now, especially in the midrange market, he said. TIGHT RACE Stephen said he expects the race among the top three to tighten during the last half of this year. Dell Computer Corp., in fifth place, has come on strong be¬ cause of lower prices, Stephen said. Dell’s market share has ris¬ en to 5.4%, up 1.3% from last year’s second quarter. Users are getting more com¬ fortable with buying direct from Dell, Dulaney said, comparing the company’s popularity with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which of¬ fers products close to wholesale. Dell user Pam Bowers, pro¬ curement and contracting man¬ ager at Trigon Insurance Corp. in Richmond, Va., said Trigon stayed with laptops from Dell because it has no trouble with delivery times or shortages. \"We were an IBM shop seven years ago, and we couldn’t get desktops or laptops,” said Bow¬ ers, whose company uses about 200 Dell portables. Despite the growing influ¬ ence of Dell’s and Gateway 2000, Inc.’s direct marketing strategy and aggressive pricing, Jim Sniveley, systems consul¬ tant at Sun Oil Co. in Philadel¬ phia, said Sun Oil is sticking with Compaq as a main portable provider because of the com¬ pany’s top-tier reputation. “I don’t think we have any reason to change at this point,” Sniveley said. \"The feeling is [that] with total cost of owner¬ ship, we’re probably better off doing what we’re doing” by buy¬ ing from a top-tier vendor through a reseller instead of di¬ rect from a vendor such as Dell, he said. □ Daiwa grew dissatisfied with C++ because it is difficult to write well and complicated to maintain. - Jeffry Borror, Daiwa Securities But he said he was growing dissatisfied with C++ because it is difficult to write well and even more complicated to maintain. Java retains the best features of C++, such as the C syntax and basic object model, and elimi¬ nates the worst features, such as pointers and manual memory management, Borror said. “If you do object-oriented de¬ velopment correctly, you have a much better chance of achieving the reuse of code we’ve been looking for in 20 years of pro¬ gramming,” Borror said. “In particular, what I like is the Java- Beans model, which makes it very easy to develop and reuse software components.” Borror compared it to being able to buy the light switches, sinks and door for a house instead of building them from scratch. “I want Home Depot,” he said. That is important for a securities firm such as Daiwa, where time often means money. “The pressure is particularly intense here because we’re un¬ der great deadlines,” he said. “Our markets move very quick¬ ly. If we can’t deliver things and put things out very quickly, the business opportunity is gone.” “Traders are dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars regularly. So if you can do some¬ thing faster or more accurately than the competition, there’s millions of dollars that can be made,” he said. □ ©Computerized stock option trades boost Amex. Page 39.

Features of SCO’s SVR5 Unix kernel technology • Clustering support • Built-in high-availability device failover • Support for up to 64G bytes of main memory and up to IT-byte file systems • Java-based administration • Java Virtual Machine and Java Development Kit The products are designed to give Intel Corp. systems users who are concerned about NT’s scalability and reliability an alternative in the midrange commercial server space. For example, UnixWare with SVR5 technology will have built-in high-avail¬ ability and clustering, support for 64-bit file systems and 64-bit libraries, support for up to 64G bytes of main memory, up to iT-byte file and file systems and 512 logical disks. It also will support Java-based adminis¬ tration tools and give users the ability to access and manage Unix and Windows applications via the World Wide Web. “Features like expanded memory and greater data capacity are certainly the kind of things SCO will need if they want to position themselves as an enterprise player,” said Bob Celmer, a technical fel¬ low at AutoZone, Inc., an automobile parts retailer and SCO user in Memphis. To break in, SCO needs strong hard¬ ware partners that have enterprise experi¬ ence and are willing to pitch SCO Unix¬ Ware for large applications and database environments, said Tony lams, an ana¬ lyst at D. H. Brown and Associates in Port Chester, N.Y. And that support may be increasingly hard to come by for SCO in the coming months, analysts said. Most of SCO’s re¬ cent sales have come from low-end small-office systems sold by companies that have licensed UnixWare, including Compaq Computer Corp., Data General Corp., Unisys Corp., Siemens Nixdorf In- formationssysteme AG and NCR Corp. But some of those vendors also license basic Unix kernel technology from SCO for use in their own versions of Unix for much higher-end servers. SCO has been trying to move such vendors to a common UnixWare operat¬ ing system capable of spanning the Unix market from high end to low end. But many of those licensees, including DG, Unisys and NCR, are focusing in¬ creasingly on Windows NT for midrange systems. And Sun Microsystems, Inc. is working hard to draw them in to the Sol¬ aris camp at the high end. For example, Sun recently licensed Solaris on NCR’s WorldMark line of scalable Intel servers. Sun is reportedly courting other SCO vendors, including Sequent Computer Systems, Inc., to get them to run Solaris on their Intel boxes. □ Invest in a CD that pays you back immediately .
