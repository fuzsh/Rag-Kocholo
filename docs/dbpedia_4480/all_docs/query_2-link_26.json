        "text": "How Does NetSuite Pricing Work? Follow These 5 Steps\n\nWhile we can't give you one definitive price, we can let you know about all of the major decisions and business needs that affect the total cost of NetSuite.\n\nHere are the five main steps used to determine the price of NetSuite for your business.\n\n1. NetSuite Licensing Costs\n\nThe first step to determining the price of NetSuite is figuring out which NetSuite edition your business needs.\n\nThis portion of NetSuite pricing isn't necessarily your decision—it's based on your company's size and the number of NetSuite user licenses you need.\n\nNetSuite Edition Pricing\n\nNetSuite editions are based on the size of your company and how many user licenses you need.\n\nNetSuite Starter/Limited Editions - NetSuite Limited Edition is available for up to 10 user licenses. It's best for small businesses with one legal entity and up to 50 employees.\n\nNetSuite Standard/Mid-Market Editions - NetSuite Mid-Market includes user licenses for 11-1,000 employees. It's best for businesses with two or more legal entities.\n\nNetSuite Premium Edition - Unlimited licenses\n\nNetSuite Enterprise Editions - NetSuite Enterprise Edition is for large companies with multiple legal entities that need over 1,000 NetSuite user licenses.\n\nNetSuite Service Tiers\n\nOn top of your NetSuite Edition, you're also required to fall into a designated NetSuite Service Tier. This aspect of NetSuite is based on managing business productivity. Each Service Tier has a maximum number of users, file storage, and monthly transaction lines.\n\nService Tier Users File Storage (GB) Monthly Transaction Lines Standard 100 100 200,000 Premium 1,000 1,000 2,000,000 Enterprise 2,000 2,000 10,000,000 Ultimate 4,000 4,000 50,000,000\n\nWant to find out the price of the NetSuite service tier that you need? Find out here!\n\nHere's What Each NetSuite Edition Includes\n\nAll three NetSuite editions automatically come with NetSuite's CRM and ERP. Here are the functionalities you'll have out of the box.\n\nNetSuite CRM\n\nMarketing automation - Drive your marketing campaigns using email marketing, campaign management, and lead nurturing.\n\nSales Force automation - Empower your sales team through lead management, opportunity tracking, and sales forecasting.\n\nReporting and analytics with real-time data - Access comprehensive reporting for data-driven decision-making.\n\nUpsell, quote, and order management - Streamline your quote-to-cash process encompassing quote creation, order fulfillment, and revenue recognition.\n\nSales forecasting and quota management - Gain insights into future sales performance with accurate and real-time sales forecasting capabilities.\n\nPartner relationship management - Collaborate with partners via partner portals, lead sharing, and joint forecasting.\n\nLearn more about NetSuite's CRM capabilities and how they can help you manage NetSuite Contract Renewals leads throughout the entire sales funnel.\n\nHere’s a look at a customer record and dashboard in NetSuite.\n\nNetSuite ERP\n\nFinancial management - Gain complete control over financials, including general ledger, accounts payable and receivable, fixed assets, and financial reporting.\n\nGlobal business management - Manage your international operations and expand into global markets with tools for compliance, currency management, and cross-border logistics.\n\nInventory management - Keep track of inventory levels, stock movements, and stockouts with features for real-time updates and optimization.\n\nOrder management - Streamline your order-to-cash process, covering order capture, fulfillment, and invoicing.\n\nSupply chain management - Improve supply chain efficiency with demand planning, inventory, and vendor management.\n\nWarehouse management - Enhance warehouse operations with bin management, pick-pack-ship, and real-time inventory tracking.\n\nAccounting - Handle your financial transactions, journal entries, and reconciliation easily, ensuring accurate records and compliance with accounting standards.\n\nRead more about NetSuite's ERP functionalities, including everything from fixed asset management to real-time warehouse operation visibility.\n\nHow Much Does NetSuite Cost Per User?\n\nNetSuite’s cost includes a monthly user fee, but that’s just the beginning. You’ll also need to consider the base platform cost, license duration, add-on modules, and any customizations. The actual cost per user varies for each business and isn’t simply the user fee multiplied by the number of users.\n\nTo calculate the true price per user, you’d need to add up all the costs and divide by the total number of users.\n\nFind out how much NetSuite costs per user here.\n\nNetSuite User Licensing\n\nThere are also a couple of different types of user licenses within NetSuite, so it's important to know exactly what type of access each employee at your company needs.\n\nThe NetSuite Edition levels are based on the number of full user licenses required.\n\nFull User License - A full user license is required for any employee who needs access to NetSuite on a regular basis. NetSuite has pre-configured access settings called roles, including standard roles such as an accountant, sales rep, or administrator, and custom roles. Any employee with these roles will require a full user license.\n\nEmployee Center License - These users are limited to performing only a few actions. These actions include tracking project time, viewing or entering PTO, and adjusting expense reports.\n\nDoes NetSuite Have \"Read-Only Access\"?\n\nNetSuite doesn't provide \"read-only\" access.\n\nTo be able to view and export data, you'll need a full user license. Luckily, all data can be exported into Excel, so if you just need one or two reports, you can have someone with a full user license export it for you as needed. Or, you could also have them set up an automated email alert that sends you an email with an Excel file attached on a periodic basis.\n\nEXPERT ADVICE\n\nWe advise against having multiple users share the same user license. While multiple users can share one NetSuite user license, you won't be able to pinpoint who made each change. If you want the ability to know exactly which employee is making changes within NetSuite, they will each need their own user license. Plus, if a second user tries to log in with the same credentials as someone who is already using NetSuite, the first user will be booted out of the system.\n\n2. NetSuite Module Pricing\n\nRegardless of the NetSuite edition you have, you'll start out with NetSuite's ERP and CRM modules.\n\nFor some businesses, this is all they need (if that's the case for you, you can skip ahead to step 3!). However, other businesses will require additional NetSuite modules to achieve the functionalities and workflows needed to run their business.\n\nNetSuite offers a set of pre-built modules that can be easily added to your software. If you aren't quite sure whether or not you need modules during your NetSuite implementation phase, we can help you determine that.\n\nNetsuite modules are generally sold within a Suite of bundled modules – these bundles are called editions. For example, you could purchase the SuiteSuccess Manufacturing Premium Edition, which includes the core ERP, CRM, and six additional NetSuite modules.\n\nThe price of NetSuite modules depends on the NetSuite edition your business has. Just like most NetSuite features, there's not one single price generalized across the entire platform.\n\nNetSuite's eCommerce component is called SuiteCommerce. If you run an eCommerce business and are looking to onboard NetSuite, we highly recommend looking into SuiteCommerce.\n\nNetSuite eCommerce Pricing\n\nThe price for SuiteCommerce varies depending on how many users you need, the level of SuiteCommerce you're going to purchase, and how many transactions you have on a monthly basis.\n\nNetSuite offers two levels of SuiteCommerce:\n\nSite Builder - Site Builder is the lightest, earliest, and least flexible level of SuiteCommerce. It debuted in 2004 as NetSuite's foray into eCommerce management began, so it's really more of a legacy option. However, if you're a small business that doesn't need any customizations or fancy features, this could be a contender.\n\nSuiteCommerce - While this is the lowest level of SuiteCommerce, it's still a full-scale eCommerce solution. It includes true SaaS upgrades (without a version lock), supports global eCommerce websites, and provides robust business insights. It's integrated with NetSuite's CRM, ERP, and inventory management system.\n\nSuiteCommerce Advanced - The benefits of SuiteCommerce Advanced are mainly that you can customize every single aspect of your storefront. This level is probably only necessary if you're an enterprise-level eCommerce business that requires a wide product catalog and shopping customizations.\n\nIf you use a third-party eCommerce software, such as Shopify, you'll need to integrate it with NetSuite to realize the full scale of combined data. Using SuiteCommerce will make everything much easier! There's no need for integrations or additional work to connect the two programs – it's all seamless.\n\nEXPERT ADVICE\n\nNetSuite modules can be added on at any time, whenever the business need arises. If you'd like to see how NetSuite's functionality works out of the box before adding modules, that's perfectly fine! Your NetSuite implementation partner will be able to let you know what's best for your needs.\n\nIndustry-Specific NetSuite Modules\n\nThe list below contains all of the industry-specific NetSuite modules available. This includes financial management, inventory management, order management, eCommerce, professional services automation, and supply chain management. If your business requires any of those functionalities, you'll need to purchase a NetSuite module for it.\n\nWhen you choose an industry-specific module, you'll receive all of the core functionalities within that industry.\n\nNetSuite Financial Management Modules\n\nNetSuite's financial management modules provide extensive accounting and financial capabilities, giving you real-time insights into your company's financial performance.\n\nFinancial management modules include:\n\nNetSuite Advanced Financials\n\nNetSuite SuiteBilling\n\nNetSuite Revenue Management\n\nNetSuite Planning & Budgeting\n\nNetSuite Multi-Book Accounting\n\nNetSuite OneWorld\n\nNetSuite Dunning Letters\n\nNetSuite Fixed Assets Management\n\nNetSuite Electronic Bank Payments\n\nNetSuite Contract Renewals\n\nHere’s a glimpse at NetSuite’s financial dashboard:\n\nNetSuite Inventory and Order Management Modules\n\nNetSuite's inventory and order management modules can automate the ordering process from start to finish, helping you provide an amazing customer experience.\n\nInventory and order management modules include:\n\nNetSuite Advanced Inventory Management\n\nNetSuite Advanced Order Management\n\nGrid Order Management\n\nNetSuite Commerce Modules\n\nIf you're a retail business, NetSuite's commerce modules can be a game changer, whether you're an eCommerce business or are looking to optimize your omnichannel retail experience.\n\nNetSuite's commerce modules include:\n\nNetSuite SuiteCommerce\n\nNetSuite SuiteCommerce Advanced\n\nNetSuite SuiteCommerce InStore\n\nNetSuite SuiteCommerce MyAccount\n\nNetSuite Professional Services Automation (PSA) Modules\n\nNetSuite comes with a basic PSA functionality, which helps project-based companies optimize employee resources, billable hours, and profitability. However, NetSuite offers additional PSA modules if you're in need of a more robust solution.\n\nHere’s an example of a project record:\n\nNetSuite's PSA modules include:\n\nNetSuite SuiteProjects\n\nNetSuite Project Management\n\nNetSuite OpenAir\n\nNetSuite Supply Chain Modules\n\nMaximize resources and cut costs with NetSuite's supply chain modules. These tools are invaluable for running a smooth operation and consistently improving profit margins.\n\nNetSuite's supply chain modules include:\n\nNetSuite Procurement\n\nNetSuite Warehouse Management System\n\nNetSuite Demand Planning\n\nNetSuite Quality Management\n\nNetSuite Work in Process (WIP) and Routings\n\nNetSuite Work Orders and Assemblies\n\nNetSuite Advanced Manufacturing\n\nEXPERT ADVICE\n\nOne of our favorite things about NetSuite is its ability to service each and every industry. Some other industries NetSuite is great for include food and beverage, software, and even mining.\n\nA-La-Carte NetSuite Modules\n\nEach bullet point listed for the industries above can also be licensed a la carte, depending on your needs.\n\nFor example, if you don't need every single functionality of the NetSuite Warehouse Management System but you still want Advanced Manufacturing capabilities, you can only license that one module!\n\nFind out the price of NetSuite modules for your perfect setup here!\n\n3. The Cost of NetSuite Implementation\n\nFor standard implementations that don't require extensive customizations, data migration, or integrations, the general rule of thumb is that NetSuite implementation costs around 2-3x the annual NetSuite license fee.\n\nDepending on who you ask, the total price of NetSuite implementation can range from $10,000-$100,000+.\n\nWhy such a large price range? Because NetSuite implementation looks different for everyone.\n\nThe main cost drivers of NetSuite implementation are:\n\nThe scope of the discovery and research phase\n\nCustomizations needed\n\nDevelopment work\n\nIntegrations needed\n\nTraining to get staff up and running in NetSuite\n\nHere's how each phase of NetSuite implementation can affect the total cost.\n\nImplementation Phase Hours Total Price Discovery & Research 50-150 $7,500-37,500 Setup & Deployment 100-300 $15,000-75,000 Customizations Varies $0-10,000 Integrations Varies $0-10,000 setup fee, $0-$5,000 annually\n\nDiscovery & Research\n\nA successful NetSuite implementation requires a thorough discovery and research phase.\n\nThe cost of the discovery and research phase is usually based on an hourly consulting fee. This portion of the project can take anywhere from 50-150 hours, with most NetSuite Solution Providers charging anywhere from $150-$250 per hour. This means the price range just for the research and discovery phase of implementation is anywhere from $7,500-$37,500+.\n\nDuring this portion of your NetSuite implementation, the team you're working with will conduct a full-scale analysis of business needs. This allows them to know exactly what's needed for your NetSuite implementation.\n\nThis implementation phase includes:\n\nAnalysis of current business software and workflows\n\nDeep dive into business processes\n\nWhich business processes need to be carried over\n\nGaps in workflows that should be addressed\n\nAny additional NetSuite functions you'll need\n\nCustom development work needed\n\nA detailed blueprint for NetSuite implementation\n\nSetup & Deployment\n\nThe setup and deployment phase is the most time-consuming portion of the project. It usually takes about 60% or more of the total implementation time. You can expect it to take about 2-3x longer than the discovery and research phase.\n\nDuring this phase of NetSuite implementation, your NetSuite setup will be configured, built, and customized as needed. You'll also complete full user acceptance testing, ensuring everything you need to run your business works flawlessly.\n\nThe total cost and hours involved with setup and deployment depend on the scope of your implementation: if you don't need any customizations or integrations and everything works as planned, it'll go much quicker.\n\nThe Cost of NetSuite Customizations & Custom Development\n\nIf the advanced NetSuite modules mentioned above just won't cut it for you, your NetSuite implementation will likely require custom development work.\n\nThe cost of NetSuite customizations varies depending on what you need. You might not need to pay for any customizations, so this wouldn't affect your budget. On the other hand, your NetSuite implementation could require upwards of $10,000 of customizations.\n\nHow Do I Know if I Need NetSuite Customizations?\n\nThe main drivers for NetSuite customizations are:\n\nAutomation - While NetSuite is capable of automating certain tasks with existing functionalities, certain automation workflows require custom development work.\n\nIndustry-specific functionalities - NetSuite provides a common base platform with room for industry-specific needs. However, this isn't always enough – NetSuite isn't fine-tuned for every industry. Depending on the industry you're in, you might need customizations for a flawless NetSuite implementation.\n\nReporting & dashboards - Many NetSuite customers need custom reports and dashboards configured. This is the case when the reporting requires calculations or data to be saved within the system, which isn't available with NetSuite's regular setup.\n\nIntegrations with other systems - If your NetSuite implementation requires integrating with other platforms, you'll need some custom development work.\n\nThere are virtually endless ways to configure NetSuite for your business. NetSuite can be custom-developed for your exact needs, such as automating workflows and pushing NetSuite's capabilities beyond its general functions.\n\nThere are two main types of NetSuite customizations:\n\nSuiteFlow (Workflows) - This is best for non-technical users or companies that don't have an in-house development team capable of building NetSuite customizations. It's also helpful if you're trying to save money on your NetSuite implementation because you won't have to pay for custom development work. Instead of requiring code, it's a point-and-click solution.\n\nSuiteScript - SuiteScript is NetSuite's platform that allows complete customization and automation of business processes. It's built on JavaScript and requires experienced developers to build out and customize it to your needs.\n\nYour NetSuite integration partner will help you determine what types of customizations may be needed for your business.\n\nEXPERT ADVICE\n\nSome third-party providers build their own NetSuite bundles to help make certain business processes easier. These pre-built NetSuite bundles can be more affordable than paying developers to code the functionalities you need. For example, at SCS Cloud, we've created a suite of NetSuite bundles that help with everything from billing and payment automation to consolidating invoices.\n\nThe Cost of NetSuite Connectors & Integrations\n\nWhile NetSuite is a world-class ERP system, your business might also still utilize other software for certain business functions. This is where NetSuite integrations and connectors come into play.\n\nYou will want to make sure all of your business data from other platforms is integrated into NetSuite. That way, there's one central source of data you can report on, analyze, and use to make strategic business decisions.\n\nNetSuite Integrations\n\nIf your business utilizes other software in addition to NetSuite, you'll need to purchase a NetSuite integration to keep data flowing through both platforms.\n\nJust like with every other step in the NetSuite pricing process, the cost of NetSuite integration varies.\n\nIndividual integrations can cost anywhere from $2,500-$5,000+ annually. There's also usually a one-time implementation fee ranging from $1,500-$10,000+ depending on the amount of development work needed.\n\nLuckily, NetSuite can easily integrate with many other programs. If an integration doesn't already exist, you can hire developers to set one up!\n\nFor example, you might need to integrate NetSuite with data from:\n\nSalesforce\n\nShopify\n\nAmazon\n\nShipStation\n\nHubspot\n\nAnd more!\n\nUnless your business is staffed with developers who fully understand API connections and NetSuite's coding language, SuiteScript, it's best to choose a third party to help with your NetSuite integration.\n\nMany NetSuite solution providers have pre-built NetSuite integrations that are quick and easy to set up. If you need to connect NetSuite with any other platform, you should allow some room in your budget for this step.\n\nEXPERT ADVICE\n\nChoosing a NetSuite partner with pre-built integrations can speed up the implementation process. At SCS Cloud, we've created our own set of NetSuite integrations called SuperSync. These can be set up in minutes, so you can easily integrate data from platforms including Amazon, Salesforce, and Shopify. This helps you save money on pricey custom development fees.\n\nNetSuite Connectors\n\nNetSuite connectors are less involved (and more affordable) than NetSuite integrations. This is because they don't require any custom coding and can usually be set up with the click of a button!\n\nNetSuite connectors are great for enhancing inventory management, order management, and accounting. They centralize eCommerce data and point-of-sale systems so everything is housed within NetSuite.\n\nThe cost of NetSuite connectors can range from a few hundred dollars per month to a few thousand dollars per month. Also, an initial setup fee may apply.\n\nNetSuite provides connectors for:\n\nAmazon\n\nWooCommerce\n\nAmazon\n\neBay\n\nWalmart\n\nAmazon Fulfillment\n\nShipStation\n\nShopify POS\n\nAnd more!\n\nIn addition to NetSuite's connectors, third-party service providers can also build their own connectors.\n\nFind out the price of NetSuite customizations here.\n\n4. Determine Where You'll be Purchasing NetSuite From\n\nThere are a few different purchasing options for NetSuite. You can either go through a licensed solution provider or purchase directly from NetSuite.\n\nPURCHASING NETSUITE THROUGH A LICENSED PROVIDER\n\nOne option is going through a licensed NetSuite Solution Provider.\n\nIf your business has a lot of complex processes or you want to be able to customize your NetSuite implementation process and internal dashboards, it’s best to choose a service provider that offers implementation services, development resources, and extensive training and support.\n\nA licensed NetSuite provider will provide more time, effort, and attention versus what you would get purchasing directly from NetSuite.\n\nPlus, they have more flexibility with what they can do for your personalized implementation. As another added bonus, they might already have their own pre-built integrations and custom bundles, so you don't have to wait for (or pay for) custom development work.\n\nSchedule a FREE NetSuite consultation with our NetSuite-certified team to learn how to get started today.\n\nPURCHASING DIRECTLY FROM NETSUITE\n\nYou also have the option of purchasing directly through NetSuite.\n\nThis is best for smaller companies that don’t have complex business processes and don’t use a lot of different software.\n\nNetSuite does offer its own out-of-the-box integration options, but they only support certain software.\n\nMake sure you understand all of your NetSuite integration options, including all the software your company uses and each business process you need to integrate into NetSuite before deciding to purchase directly through NetSuite.\n\nEXPERT ADVICE\n\nChoose a third-party NetSuite Partner if you have complex business processes, need customizations, or require additional integrations. They can help you build a custom plan and provide extensive support as needed.\n\n5. ONGOING TECHNICAL SUPPORT & TRAINING NEEDED\n\nDepending on where you purchase NetSuite, ongoing training and technical support may or may not be included in the implementation price.\n\nNetSuite training and support could cost anywhere from $2k-$15k+ depending on how many employees need to be trained, how in-depth the training will be, and the duration of the training.\n\nEXPERT ADVICE\n\nHere at SCS Cloud, we provide full training during the implementation process. If you aren’t going to purchase ongoing support, make sure you have in-house development resources to install updates or add things to NetSuite as needed.\n\nTips to Save Money on NetSuite\n\nUtilize SuiteAnswers as Much as Possible\n\nOngoing NetSuite support doesn't come for free. Your two main options are using your licensed service provider at whatever their hourly rate is or paying for one of the three service levels of NetSuite's SuiteSupport.\n\nBefore paying for support, try using SuiteAnswers. SuiteAnswers is a free self-service support site within NetSuite that contains answers to countless common questions, training videos, support articles, and best practice documents. Check out our guide on how to use SuiteAnswers to get started.\n\nAsk Your Service Provider if They Offer Financing\n\nIf you don't have the working capital to pay for NetSuite in full when you sign the contract, ask your provider if they offer financing.\n\nWorking with a monthly payment can be a lot more manageable than finding the cash to pay for three to five years of NetSuite at one time.\n\nEXPERT ADVICE\n\nOracle (the company that owns NetSuite) offers a program called Oracle financing. This allows you to set up fixed monthly payments instead of paying for NetSuite upfront. If you're interested, we can provide more details about Oracle financing. .\n\nPurchase a Longer NetSuite License\n\nWe aren't just saying this because we think NetSuite is an amazing product. The longer you license NetSuite in your contract, the more money you'll save.\n\nIf you only sign on for a 12-month contract, your service provider might raise your rates when you want to re-sign a year later. This leads us to our next point…\n\nNegotiate Maximum Annual Price Increases\n\nIn most cases, it's possible to negotiate a discount for NetSuite licensing. However, your NetSuite service provider might not always honor that same discount when it comes time to re-sign.\n\nFor example, let's say you sign a one-year contract with a 40% discount rate off of NetSuite's list pricing. Once that year ends and it's time to renew your contract, they may only offer you a 30% discount. This might not seem like a lot, but if your business isn't growing quickly enough to handle added expenses, these steep price increases can start to add up.\n\nTo safeguard your business against large NetSuite pricing increases, we recommend negotiating a maximum annual price increase rate, such as 5%. This means your NetSuite provider can't raise your price by more than 5% annually.\n\nKnow How Much Storage Space You Need (and When You'll Need More)\n\nNetSuite charges for different levels of service tiers based on how many gigabytes of data your business needs.\n\nNetSuite's service tiers offer the following business data limits:\n\nStandard: 100GB\n\nPremium: 1,000GB\n\nEnterprise: 2,000GB\n\nUltimate: 4,000GB\n\nThere are also limits on the number of daily and monthly commerce transactions for each service tier to be aware of.\n\nIf you're expecting business data or transactions to increase for any reason, you should budget accordingly.\n\nCONSIDER NETSUITE SUITESUCCESS IF YOU'RE A SMALL BUSINESS\n\nNetSuite launched SuiteSuccess to make NetSuite implementation easier (and more affordable) for smaller businesses. Its goal is to get NetSuite live for your business within 100 days.\n\nSuiteSuccess comes with pre-defined roles, dedicated process flows and key performance indicators (KPIs), turnkey setup, and a wide range of prebuilt reports and dashboards based on industry best practices.\n\nSeveral popular SuiteSuccess packages include:\n\nFinancials First\n\nManufacturing\n\nWholesale Distribution\n\nRetail\n\nProfessional Services\n\nSoftware\n\nFood & Beverage\n\nApparel, Footwear, and Accessories\n\nIt’s important to note that if your business needs any customizations, integrations, or detailed training, SuiteSuccess probably isn't the best option.

From standard NetSuite configurations to advanced customization, our team’s expertise will ensure you’re guided through to a successful launch.\n\nFind out how much NetSuite will cost for your business today!\n\nGET A FREE CONSULTATION\n\nNetSuite Pricing FAQ\n\nHow Much Does NetSuite Usually Cost?\n\nThe true cost of NetSuite depends on many different factors. This includes the cost of the license you're using, the number of licensed users, any add-on modules, and customizations needed.\n\nIS NETSUITE WORTH THE INVESTMENT?\n\nDeciding if NetSuite is worth it depends on your business goals and budget. While it offers benefits like improved visibility and streamlined processes, consider factors like ROI and long-term gains. Analyze your existing systems and pain points to see if NetSuite can save you money and make things more efficient.\n\nCAN I GET NETSUITE FOR FREE OR AT A LOW COST TO TRY IT OUT?\n\nAlthough NetSuite doesn’t have a free version, there’s a free trial to explore the software. This trial lets businesses try it out and see if it fits their need. If you want to start small, there are also low-cost options available for certain modules. These options can help you see what NetSuite can do and decide if you want to use it more extensively.\n\nIs NetSuite affordable?\n\nNetSuite is most affordable for midsize to enterprise-level companies. Considering its nearly endless functionalities, it can replace a lot of other more expensive (and less efficient) software programs.\n\nNetSuite is less affordable for smaller businesses. While there is a small business option for NetSuite, a smaller business might not have the cash on hand to get started. If that's the case for you, we recommend looking into NetSuite's SuiteSuccess, which was designed to help small businesses implement NetSuite!\n\nIs NetSuite Expensive?\n\nNetSuite isn’t the lowest-price ERP software on the market, but its price depends on what you need from it.\n\nThe cost of NetSuite scales depending on the size of your business, the number of user licenses required, and any customizations and integrations you need.\n\nNetSuite is an incredibly robust cloud software solution that's capable of nearly any business process with the right customizations and training. If you need software that can scale with your headcount, across multiple legal entities, and throughout different countries, NetSuite is the best choice.\n\nHow Much is NetSuite per month?\n\nThere isn’t a set cost for the monthly price of NetSuite.\n\nWhile there is a monthly NetSuite user fee, the true cost is usually higher than that. You would need to combine the costs of the suite you're using and any additional modules or integrations. Then, divide that by the total number of users to determine how much NetSuite costs your business per user per month.\n\nHow Much is a NetSuite Sandbox?\n\nThe price of NetSuite Sandbox is 10% of the total of your NetSuite modules and users.\n\nHow Long is a NetSuite Subscription?\n\nThe length of a NetSuite subscription depends on the terms you choose.\n\nYou could choose anywhere from a one-year license to a five-year license, depending on your budget at the time.\n\nIf you're looking to save the most money, it's best to choose a longer term.
