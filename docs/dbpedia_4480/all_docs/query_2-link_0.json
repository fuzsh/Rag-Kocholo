        "text": "NetSuite provides a standard role for customers. The Customer Center role lets customers view their estimates, orders, invoices, and payments. You can customize this role to adjust the level of permission for certain tasks in the center. For example, if you do not want customers to make payments from the Customer Center, you can set the level for Customer Payments to None instead of Edit.\n\nFor more information about giving access to customers, see the following:\n\nEnable the Customer Access Feature\n\nProvide Access to Individual Customers\n\nUse CSV Import to Provide Access to Multiple Customers\n\nSet the Customer Center Sales Order Form\n\nWhen customer access has been enabled, roles can be assigned to customer users individually or by CVS import to give access to multiple customers."
