We've successfully combined our traditional business approach with cutting-edge technology.\"\n\n“If we had it to do over again, we would have retained Net at Work right from the start. They really allow us to unleash the power of NetSuite and put it to work for us.”\n\n“Solving challenges like those Sonic was facing is what they live for. So, we didn’t bother with an ERP consulting company to help us analyze ERP applications. Instead, we brought in Net at Work.”\n\n“Without Net at Work I don’t think we’d have been able to get the full value out of NetSuite. The publisher might understand the software, but Net at Work understands our business.”\n\n“We had a clear vision of what we wanted NetSuite to do for us. Net at Work listened to us, understood that vision, and then set out a plan to help us achieve it.”\n\n“Net at Work has the real-world business experience in the manufacturing sector that worked to our advantage. It’s not enough to be a product expert, you have to have industry expertise and the time, resources, and commitment to understand how the customer’s business operates. Net at Work brought that to our project.”"
