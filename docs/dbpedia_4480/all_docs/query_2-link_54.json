        "text": "Inline Editing Custom Fields within Saved Searches\n\nIssue:\n\nA customer reported not being able to inline edit a custom field on a saved search for sales orders, while the same field was able to be inline edited on a search for purchase orders.\n\nResolution:\n\nThe field was hidden on multiple custom forms that are in use for sales orders. Inline editing requires the field to be accessible on the transaction form. Showing the field on all sales order forms made it inline editable again.\n\nPulling Up Payment Methods on an Invoice Saved Search\n\nIssue:\n\nWhen trying to display Payment Method on an Invoice Saved Search, it always returns blank. The amounts are pulled in properly, but the payment method stays blank.\n\nResolution:\n\nWhen searching payments, the payment method only appears on mainline results and the applied to transaction (i.e. the invoice) only appears on the detail line results.\n\nInternal ID vs. ID?\n\nIssue:\n\nIs there a difference between .internalid and .id when fetching IDs from a multi-select field in a Saved Search?\n\nResolution:\n\nYes, there is!\n\nThe behavior of how they return the results is different. When using the form “parentFieldId.internalid” in the “Result” section of the saved search, the results of the saved search will create a new result line for each internal id.\n\nWhen using the form “parentFieldId.id” in the “Result” section of the saved search, the results of the saved search will create only one line for that multi-select field where the different ids are usually separated with a “,”.\n\nUse those according to your use case and always validate that you are getting the desired output for your needs. In my use case, it is easier to separate the string of IDs than to deal with multiple lines that have all the same values except for the IDs in the multi-select.\n\nFor context, this was discovered on a multi-select custom field on a custom record for both Zone and Location.\n\nCan’t See All Saved Searches\n\nIssue:\n\nWhen looking at a list of saved searches in NetSuite (logged in as administrator), how can I see all the saved searches including the private ones? A private saved search is one that has no audience. It is therefore only visible to its owner.\n\nResolution:\n\nWhen looking at a list of saved searches, ensure that the Show All Private Searches filter is displayed. Select the YES option. Selecting ALL will not work.\n\nSearching for Opportunities\n\nIssue:\n\nWhen trying to create a saved search on opportunities to get the number of hours on a specific item (Consulting), there is an issue finding the Mainline filter in the list of fields.\n\nResolution:\n\nUse the transaction search, with filter type = Opportunity.\n\nModifying Saved Search Filters\n\nIssue:\n\nA client requested that we build them a saved search that searches on a custom record type and that can filter one of its fields. This field is attached to a custom list populated by 3 values (Yes, No, In progress). The client would like to remove the native -None- option from the 'available filter' in the saved search.\n\nResolution:\n\nCurrently, NetSuite does not allow modifications to options displayed in an available filter when that filter is filtering on a type field. If the filter was filtering on a type field, -None- would not appear.\n\nFilters usually display all the values that are available for the field. So in the example above, that would mean some records have Agent Approval values as \"Yes\", some have \"No\", some have \"In Progress\" and some are empty. A workaround could be to locate the records with no \"Agent Approval\" and fix them to have one of the valid values.\n\nReturning US State Abbreviations\n\nIssue:\n\nA client has a custom list/record field using US states and requires the 2-character state abbreviation (i.e. State Short Name) be returned in a saved search, but NetSuite will only return the state long name.\n\nResolution:\n\nThe following formula will convert the long names to short names:\n\nCASE {Custom Field ID} WHEN 'Alabama' THEN 'AL' WHEN 'Alaska' THEN 'AK' WHEN 'Arizona' THEN 'AZ' WHEN 'Arkansas' THEN 'AR' WHEN 'California' THEN 'CA' WHEN 'Canal Zone' THEN 'CZ' WHEN 'Colorado' THEN 'CO' WHEN 'Connecticut' THEN 'CT' WHEN 'Delaware' THEN 'DE' WHEN 'District of Columbia' THEN 'DC' WHEN 'Florida' THEN 'FL' WHEN 'Georgia' THEN 'GA' WHEN 'Guam' THEN 'GU' WHEN 'Hawaii' THEN 'HI' WHEN 'Idaho' THEN 'ID' WHEN 'Illinois' THEN 'IL' WHEN 'Indiana' THEN 'IN' WHEN 'Iowa' THEN 'IA' WHEN 'Kansas' THEN 'KS' WHEN 'Kentucky' THEN 'KY' WHEN 'Louisiana' THEN 'LA' WHEN 'Maine' THEN 'ME' WHEN 'Maryland' THEN 'MD' WHEN 'Massachusetts' THEN 'MA' WHEN 'Michigan' THEN 'MI' WHEN 'Minnesota' THEN 'MN' WHEN 'Mississippi' THEN 'MS' WHEN 'Missouri' THEN 'MO' WHEN 'Montana' THEN 'MT' WHEN 'Nebraska' THEN 'NE' WHEN 'Nevada' THEN 'NV' WHEN 'New Hampshire' THEN 'NH' WHEN 'New Jersey' THEN 'NJ' WHEN 'New Mexico' THEN 'NM' WHEN 'New York' THEN 'NY' WHEN 'North Carolina' THEN 'NC' WHEN 'North Dakota' THEN 'ND' WHEN 'Ohio' THEN 'OH' WHEN 'Oklahoma' THEN 'OK' WHEN 'Oregon' THEN 'OR' WHEN 'Pennsylvania' THEN 'PA' WHEN 'Puerto Rico' THEN 'PR' WHEN 'Rhode Island' THEN 'RI' WHEN 'South Carolina' THEN 'SC' WHEN 'South Dakota' THEN 'SD' WHEN 'Tennessee' THEN 'TN' WHEN 'Texas' THEN 'TX' WHEN 'Utah' THEN 'UT' WHEN 'Vermont' THEN 'VT' WHEN 'Virgin Islands' THEN 'VI' WHEN 'Virginia' THEN 'VA' WHEN 'Washington' THEN 'WA' WHEN 'West Virginia' THEN 'WV' WHEN 'Wisconsin' THEN 'WI' WHEN 'Wyoming' THEN 'WY' ELSE NULL END\n\nSpecifying Filter Formulas\n\nIssue:\n\nFormulas are selectable in the dropdown of fields to apply in the available filters, but there is nowhere to specify what the formula is.\n\nResolution:\n\nIn the Criteria tab, the first formula that is the same type as the one specified in the Available Filters will be the formula leveraged on the Available Filter. The specified Criteria will appear as the default value on the Available Filter and can be modified to re-run a new query.\n\nThe same applies to the sort criteria in a saved search (results tab of saved search): the first formula of a type can be used to sort in ascending/descending order.\n\nLanguage Errors Within Saved Searches\n\nIssue:\n\nA client noticed saved searches would show different results depending on the language of the user, even when using the same role. We could replicate the issue (switching the environment to English and to French, running the same search but getting different results).\n\nResolution:\n\nWhen using case statements (i.e., formula with a CASE WHEN), criteria are language-specific.\n\nAs an example, if the search condition looks for an account type called 'Income' in a French environment, it will likely find no results (as the French equivalent is 'Bénéfice'). The same goes with the field 'transaction type' and likely any other field type for which list values can be translated.\n\nHere's a way to avoid this issue:\n\nThis is the formula in English only: CASE WHEN {accounttype} = 'Cost of Goods Sold' THEN {amount} ELSE 0 END This is the alternate version of the formula which will be supported in both languages: CASE WHEN {accounttype} = 'Cost of Goods Sold' OR {accounttype} = 'Coût des marchandises vendues' THEN {amount} ELSE 0 END\n\nBulk Emailing in NetSuite\n\nIssue:\n\nThe client requested to send a one-time bulk email to a list of over 700 customers.\n\nResolution:\n\nThis can be accomplished using a one-time scheduled workflow, provided there is a saved search of the customers who should receive the email.\n\nThe workflow should be a scheduled workflow with the \"Repeat\" checkbox unchecked and the saved search of entities (customers, vendors, contacts, or partners) to be emailed set as the saved search condition.\n\nThe only action required is an email sent from the required contact (who must be created as an employee) to the email on the entity record. An email template can be used or a message written by the client can be copied and pasted into the message field."
