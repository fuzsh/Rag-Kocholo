        "text": "To set up users with access to your NetSuite account, you must have the Administrator role to set up records for them, either employee, vendor, partner, or customer records, depending upon the type of users. To add a user, you need to set up a record for that user and on that record, explicitly indicate that access to NetSuite should be provided\n\nOn each record, you need to provide an email address, which serves as the user ID. Each record has an Access subtab, where you can enable the Give Access option and assign roles. For users to have access to NetSuite, they must also have a password. Users with the Administrator role can send an access notification email that includes a link that lets users create their own passwords.\n\nFor links to instructions for adding NetSuite users, see the topics in Manage Different Types of Users.\n\nIf you assign an additional role to a user who is currently logged in to NetSuite, that user will need to log out and log back in to NetSuite to see the newly assigned role. The same is true if you add permissions to an existing role while a user is currently logged in to NetSuite. The user needs to log out and log back in to exercise the new permissions.\n\nTo review users' roles, go to Setup > Users/Roles > Manage Users. The Manage Users page lists all users by name, with their email addresses and roles.\n\nFor more information, see Viewing Your NetSuite Users List.\n\nThe Login Audit Trail\n\nThe Login Audit Trail is a specialized search that returns a list of account login and logout activity, that can be filtered by date, user, role, or IP address. This search helps keep track of account users, when they have logged in or logged out, and from where. Search results indicate whether each login or logout attempt was successful. This search is available at Setup > Users/Roles > View Login Audit Trail.\n\nNote:\n\nIn some cases, users' login to NetSuite is ended when they have not explicitly logged out of NetSuite. For example, this situation occurs when a user's NetSuite session times out. If the logout is not explicit, the system does not create a logout entry in the Login Audit Trail.\n\nFor more information, see Login Audit Trail Overview.\n\nManage Different Types of Users\n\nSee the following topics for information about setting up and maintaining access for different types of NetSuite users.\n\nEmployee Users\n\nVendor Users\n\nPartner Users\n\nCustomer Users"
