It outlines the possible differences between the self-study recordings and your updated Course Guide.\n\nThe course demonstrations and exercises were validated against current functionality, in the current‐ NetSuite release version, to ensure that they were not “broken”. This Course Guide has been updated accordingly. All exercises have been moved to the end of their respective modules.\n\nHighlighted features and functionality Administrators No Longer Required to Provide Initial Passwords for New Users:\n\n\n\nProvides options between manually creating a password, at the time of adding a new user, or providing user with a URL.\n\nChanges to the Role Record\n\n   \n\nSubsidiaries Restrictions Restrictions Subtab in Role Record Advanced Employee Restrictions Authentication section in a custom or new role\n\nChanges to the Subsidiaries page\n\n\n\nSubsidiary Settings Manager\n\nChanges to the Currency Record\n\n\n\nCurrency Precision\n\nBefore You Begin\n\n1\n\nERP: Fundamentals | Course Guide\n\nAdministrators No Longer Required to Provide Initial Passwords for New Users This may not be in the self‐study recording for the Roles Overview module. \n\nAdministrators no longer must provide an initial password to new users; standard NetSuite user access email templates now contain a synthetic field that triggers the generation of a temporary URL with a verification code that is included in the email sent to new users for accessing NetSuite. o\n\n\n\nNew users can click the URL in the notification email and create their own NetSuite passwords.\n\nThere is also a new company setting on the General Preferences page.

These changes make it cleared on how to assign subsidiary restrictions to roles. These changes are in the new Subsidiary Restrictions Section.\n\n\n\nRestrictions Subtab in Role Record ‐ The Restrictions subtab is used to set department, class and location restrictions; this was previously above all the subtabs.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Employee Restrictions functionality gives administrators more flexibility and control over what employee information certain roles can access in NetSuite\n\n\n\nAuthentication Section in Custom and New Role may be used for additional role definition and access security measures.\n\n2\n\nBefore You Begin\n\nERP: Fundamentals | Course Guide\n\nChanges to the Subsidiaries page This may not be in the self‐study recording for the Finance and Accounting Setup module. \n\n\n\nSubsidiary Settings Manager is used to manage features and define additional settings for one or more subsidiaries.
