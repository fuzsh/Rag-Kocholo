On the customer record make sure that the email is populated.\n\n“Give access” should be marked and also mark “send new access qualification email” so that NetSuite will send them the URL to set up their NetSuite password.\n\nUnder role, select the Customer Center we can select the standard one or the customized one. Then save.\n\nAfter saving your record NetSuite administrator roles have the ability to use the “Log in as customer” link to provide an overview of what the customer center looks like.\n\nLet’s click this link. So, this is what your customers will see on the NetSuite account. The links available here are based on the permission set on the role.\n\nThey’ll be able to view all their transactions and even look at the details of their sales orders and other transactions.\n\nCustomers can also update the information using this “edit your profile” link.\n\nWhere they can enter the address information their shipping information and even save credit card details on which this will be encrypted after save.\n\nAll information entered here will be reflected under NetSuite customer record.\n\nLet’s check the order creation.
