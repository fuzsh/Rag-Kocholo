        "text": "Oracle NetSuite Features\n\nOracle NetSuite goes beyond essential accounting software features. If you plan to use NetSuite as part of a larger ERP solution, you can integrate your accounting processes with other functions, such as inventory management, for a complete view of your business’s income and expenses. Here is an overview of the most important features we uncovered when testing NetSuite’s accounting solution.\n\nFinancial Process and Operations Management\n\nWe were impressed with how NetSuite helps businesses design and implement financial processes with its accounting software. This solution can connect accounting functions seamlessly with management systems. Managers have real-time access to their financial data, allowing them to create reports or address delays.\n\nThe accounting software’s general ledger allows organizations to input and monitor all financial data in a customizable ledger. Users can report functionality, enhance audit trails and create support for new management through the general ledger.\n\nFurthermore, we like how NetSuite’s accounts payable and receivable features integrate all financial data into an easy-to-use system that functions automatically. There are also management programs for taxes, fixed assets, cash and payments. [Read related article: What Are Assets in Accounting and Business?]\n\nBilling\n\nNetSuite’s billing features are more robust than those of many competitors we reviewed. For example, NetSuite can streamline your billing infrastructure if you have multiple clients, vendors or partners. The platform gives you control and flexibility over your billing process through a centralized framework that includes transactions, subscriptions and projects – everything goes directly to the billing engine. The billing function also allows you to create and manage subscriptions and recurring billing.\n\nOne new billing feature we especially liked during our testing is the ability to upload vendor bills. The software scans the document and extracts the data, eliminating the need to manually input bill details.\n\nNetSuite allows you to upload vendor bills, so you don’t have to input bill details manually. Source: NetSuite\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWe appreciate that NetSuite helps you comply with accounting standards to report financial results promptly. The revenue recognition services let you swiftly schedule, calculate and report revenue on financial statements. [Learn how revenue differs from income.]\n\nFinancial Planning and Reporting\n\nBig data analysis informs NetSuite’s financial planning and reporting capabilities. We found it valuable that NetSuite can help with budget planning via its built-in planning and budgeting functions. One particularly cool aspect is that NetSuite can use your business’s data to forecast revenue and what-if scenarios and produce budgets. The system can also take your current data in future projections and generate reports.\n\nGlobal Account Management and Consolidation\n\nWe like that NetSuite can help if you’re expanding your business globally. Running your business internationally or introducing your products and services into an international market can present accounting challenges. Through NetSuite’s financial engine, you can manage your business’s finances across your organization regardless of where operations take place. We noticed that the software comes with multiple language interfaces that can help you bridge communication or language gaps.\n\nNetSuite also offers a multicurrency management system that supports more than 190 currencies. The software calculates the exchange rate automatically for real-time conversion. It also provides various payment options to resolve international transactions seamlessly.\n\nTipBottom line\n\nWhen expanding your company internationally, be aware of international etiquette so you can conduct business respectfully and efficiently.\n\nOracle NetSuite streamlines many business processes, from A/P and A/R to inventory management. Source: Oracle NetSuite\n\nGovernance, Risk and Compliance\n\nWe were impressed that NetSuite helps organizations set up and monitor their systems to comply with regulations and meet HR compliance challenges. You can change systems as your company scales. Additionally, it’s audit ready, so any financial issues can easily be viewed and investigated. NetSuite complies with key regulatory requirements, such as ASC 606, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and SOX.\n\nThe software can also transform your governance, risk and compliance (GRC) program in real time by establishing a sustainable risk management and compliance process. This feature can save businesses money in the long run, as it can predict significant issues.\n\nIntegrations\n\nAs an ERP platform, Oracle NetSuite offers seamless integration with all NetSuite modules – such as accounting, inventory management, customer relationship management (CRM) and human capital management – available on the platform. NetSuite also integrates with many leading third-party business software products and offers open APIs for new custom integrations.\n\nMost recently, NetSuite added several new features for Amazon and Shopify users. Shopify payments now reconcile with NetSuite, eliminating the need for manual reconciliation. NetSuite users can also purchase shipping labels directly from Amazon, which we think greatly simplifies the fulfillment process.\n\nWe were impressed that a dedicated implementation team is available (albeit for an additional fee) to integrate NetSuite with your other business software. These experts can also develop additional integrations and project management planning.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nOracle NetSuite CRM is part of the larger NetSuite business ecosystem. It's an integrated customer relationship management solution with ERP capabilities. Learn more by reading our in-depth Oracle NetSuite CRM review.\n\nWarehouse Management\n\nNot every accounting software competitor we reviewed has warehouse management features, so we were impressed by NetSuite’s offerings. Its warehouse management and fulfillment module is a unique feature that helps businesses control inbound logistics, outbound logistics and other aspects of inventory management. Using NetSuite, businesses can generate and send purchase orders to their suppliers. They can also send high-priority tickets to an “expedite” list for faster processing.\n\nThe outbound logistics feature tracks goods leaving the warehouse and ships directly to stores or consumers. This tool includes a “pick, pack and ship” feature, which informs warehouse and distribution employees that a product is ready for transport. As an item moves through the warehouse, NetSuite updates its records to reflect the accurate number of items remaining in your inventory.\n\nFYIDid you know\n\n\"Supply chain distribution\" and \"logistics\" mean two different things, although the terms are often used interchangeably. Logistics is the process of planning how products will get to their destinations, whereas distribution is the actual process of getting them there.\n\nInventory Tracking\n\nLogistics tools depend on accurate inventory management, which incorporates barcoding, batch tracking and serial tracking to determine where items are located in a warehouse. We were especially impressed by how seamlessly NetSuite handles inventory tracking. When employees scan a received product into the storage facility, they move it from the loading dock to the appropriate lot, aisle and bin. Once placed, an item is scanned again, and NetSuite updates its records automatically with the item’s location and the date and time it was scanned.\n\nInventory Auditing\n\nWe were equally impressed by NetSuite’s inventory auditing features. Once an item is stored in the warehouse, NetSuite regularly alerts staff to perform “cycle counts,” or inventory audits. These audits reconcile the actual stock quantity in storage with the records maintained by the program’s inventory-tracking tool. The auditing features are also designed to streamline inventory audits by cataloging products based on their value, quantity and specific characteristics, such as color, size, material and type.\n\nOrder Management\n\nThe order management tool helps warehouses ensure an adequate quantity of each item is always on hand without over-ordering and ending up with dead stock – products that cannot be sold promptly. We love how NetSuite automatically analyzes historical sales and logistics data to determine optimal reordering points for each product, replenishing stock to an optimal threshold when it runs low. We also like that the system accounts for lead times identified through the inbound logistics tools, factoring in how long it takes suppliers to fulfill new orders and adjusting the minimum quantity accordingly.\n\nWe especially like some of the new improvements to NetSuite Ship Central. You can use the Ship Central module to discover optimal shipping rates, create international shipping and return labels, and execute sophisticated weight cost calculations using your company’s average values and carton weights.\n\nMultiple-Location Management\n\nWe also appreciated NetSuite’s multilocation management tool, which we found helpful for warehouse management and tracking warehouse KPIs. Through lot tracking, bin tracking and serial tracking, you can monitor the flow of goods across your entire business in real time. NetSuite adjusts optimal stock levels automatically to support demand across all your locations.\n\nWith NetSuite’s dashboards, you can access a massive amount of real-time data on your business. Source: Oracle NetSuite\n\nMobile App\n\nNetSuite offers a mobile app for Apple and Android smartphones, allowing you to take your business on the go. Features include the ability to create and customize records, track expenses and time, manage your calendar, and approve sales orders and expense reports. However, the NetSuite app scores only a 2 out of 5 on Google Play and a 2.3 out of 5 on Apple’s App Store. These numbers are lower than other accounting software apps we reviewed, which makes this a weak point for NetSuite."
