NetSuite Connector\n\nNetSuite Connector enables you to automate data transfer between your NetSuite account and other business systems, such as ecommerce storefronts, POS systems, online marketplaces, and Third-party logistics (3PL) providers.\n\nEach connection between NetSuite and the ecommerce platform is facilitated by a specific connector. These connectors facilitate the import and export of transaction and item-related data between NetSuite and providers.\n\n2. NetSuite SuiteApps\n\nSuiteApps are apps created to extend NetSuite's capabilities for your industry and business. Most of these applications run entirely on NetSuite servers, which host the same database as your NetSuite data.\n\nSome SuiteApps are integrations with other SaaS systems used by other NetSuite customers. You can find a list of available SuiteApps at the SuiteCloud Developer Network (SDN) or create your own using the SuiteScript programming language.\n\n3. Dell Boomi\n\nAccording to Gartner, iPaaS, or Integration platform as a service, is defined as:\n\n\"A suite of cloud services enabling development, execution, and governance of integration flows connecting any combination of on-premises and cloud-based processes, services, applications and data within individual or across multiple organizations.\"\n\niPaaS companies can manage your NetSuite integrations for you. (You might also hear them called \"integration apps.\") Dell Boomi is one of the best iPaaS integrations to use.\n\nBoomi is an excellent connector tool if you want to establish integrations using NetSuite as your primary platform. Boomi lets you quickly and easily integrate data from multiple applications and systems so you’ll always have an accurate view of your business in real-time. Boomi API Management provides a secure way to share business data with external third parties while controlling their access levels.\n\nSource\n\nKey Dell Boomi integration platform benefits and capabilities include:\n\nScalability to handle large volumes of data\n\nRobust error-handling capabilities\n\nReusable integration templates\n\nAbility to extend NetSuite’s functionality and capabilities\n\nSingle point of control for managing NetSuite integrations\n\nEasy integration with popular third-party applications\n\n4. Celigo\n\nAnother popular iPaaS integration is Celigo. Celigo first began with a single connector for the NetSuite platform back in 2010. Since then, they have specialized in connecting to NetSuite, and now offer dozens of different connectors and templates. In 2016, they released Integrator.io, which is their very own dedicated integration platform.\n\nThe Celigo platform is offered as a fully managed service and is designed to work seamlessly with NetSuite and your other tools.

You're also able to create customization packages that you can distribute to others who may find them useful.\n\n6. RESTlets\n\nNetSuite's RESTlets enable you to construct custom web services from your NetSuite account that utilize SuiteScript. Instead of the common SOAP-based APIs known as SuiteTalk, RESTlets use JSON payloads, making them ideal for specific requests like quick inventory lookups or balance queries.\n\nFor developers who know how to use SuiteScript, RESTlets are easier to adopt than SOAP-based web services and support more behaviors and integrations.\n\n7. SOAP & REST web services\n\nSOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) web services allow businesses to communicate with each other using a standardized XML messaging system. This makes it possible for authorized parties to send or receive requests over the internet, regardless of location or platform.\n\nWith SOAP web services, you can incorporate your organization's existing business functions into NetSuite with web services. SOAP web services can be called upon in real-time to carry out operations such as retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.\n\nNetSuite's REST web services provide more capabilities than SuiteTalk by extending its reach to include a REST-based interface.\n\nWith REST web services, you can utilize CRUD operations to streamline business processes by updating, deleting, and creating NetSuite records. You can also use the API definition to record metadata and execute NetSuite queries on records.\n\nOther NetSuite integration partners\n\nHere are some other popular NetSuite integration partners.\n\nEcommerce integrations\n\nAdobe Commerce\n\nBigCommerce\n\nWalmart\n\nPoint-of-sale systems\n\nSquare\n\nVend\n\nShopify POS\n\nConnect POS\n\nLightspeed\n\nBoulevard\n\nAppetize\n\nOnline marketplaces\n\nEtsy\n\neBay\n\nADP\n\nThird-party logistics\n\nDHL\n\nUSPS\n\nFedEx\n\nTNT\n\nNetSuite integration FAQs\n\nHave a quick question about NetSuite integrations?

For example, it takes less than two weeks to fully integrate NetSuite and Cube.\n\nCreated by a former CFO, Cube’s cloud-based software helps FP&A teams work anywhere — we integrate natively with both Excel and Google Sheets — so that they can plan, analyze, and collaborate with the ultimate speed and confidence. Cube is the first spreadsheet-native financial planning and analysis platform that empowers teams to drive better planning and performance without changing how they work.\n\nIn addition to Excel, Google Sheets, and NetSuite, Cube integrates with various accounting, finance, HR, ATS, operations, sales & marketing, and business intelligence software tools. This means most companies (like Masterworks and SmugMug) use Cube for nearly all of their company's financial operations.\n\nSmugMug’s finance team no longer has to double-check and reconcile numbers when they pull actuals. They know the numbers are loaded and accurate because Cube is a database.\n\n\"I tend to go to Cube before I go to NetSuite to pull numbers,\" SmugMug’s CFO Stephanie McVey states. And when she does pull numbers from Cube, Stephanie can fetch them directly into her working spreadsheet with Cube's add-on. She doesn't need to copy and paste data anymore, one of the many benefits of a flawless NetSuite integration.\n\nDoes NetSuite have API integrations?\n\nYes, NetSuite has a XML-based API for custom built connections. SuiteScript is NetSuite's server-side API that enables developers to build custom business applications. You can use SuiteScript to extend NetSuite and customize, search for, and process your NetSuite data based on predefined events. It also provides a powerful set of capabilities that you can use to build business applications.\n\nSuiteScript includes Suitlets which let you build a custom interface hosted within the NetSuite framework. Suitelets allow for custom HTML, Flash, or NetSuite-based front-end development and can also serve as the back-end for external HTML interfaces, providing flexibility in developing application extensions to NetSuite.\n\nHow much do NetSuite integrations cost?\n\nThe cost for a NetSuite integration varies depending on the complexity of your integration and the method of implementation.\n\nIf you’re conducting a one-way integration or using one of NetSuite’s prebuilt connections, like Cube, the cost should be included in your platform subscription. If you’re customizing an integration yourself or hiring a team to handle your integrations, integrations can range between $100 and $4,000 and up.\n\nConclusion: The bottom line on the best NetSuite integrations\n\nNetSuite is a powerful software that can help manage your finances, operations, and more–especially when you take advantage of its breadth of integration options.\n\nIf you're looking to step up your FP&A game, Cube offers an FP&A-integrated solution with NetSuite. Cube is a cloud-based solution that allows finance teams to work from anywhere—and with any accounting solution. Cube connects with NetSuite and can import, clean, and organize your data so you can work with it directly in Excel or Google Sheets."
