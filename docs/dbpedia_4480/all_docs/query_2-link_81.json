From creating a new role and assigning permissions, to setting up two-factor authentication and sharing user credentials, we’ve got you covered. So let’s get started on ensuring a smooth and secure collaboration with your CPA through NetSuite.\n\nStep 1: Create a New Role for the CPA\n\nCreating a new role for your CPA in NetSuite is an essential step in granting them access. Follow these steps to set up a new role:\n\nLog in to NetSuite and go to the Setup menu.\n\nSelect Users/Roles > Manage Roles.\n\nClick on “New” to create a new role.\n\nProvide a name for the role, such as “CPA Access.”\n\nSpecify the desired permissions and access levels for the role.\n\nSave the new role.\n\nBy creating a new role specifically for your CPA, you can ensure that they have the appropriate access and permissions needed to perform their tasks in NetSuite. This is crucial for maintaining security and control over your NetSuite account.\n\nRemember to regularly review and update access levels to ensure proper control and security.\n\nStep 2: Assign Permissions to the Role\n\nTo assign permissions to the role in NetSuite, follow these steps:\n\nLog in to your NetSuite account and navigate to the “Setup” menu.\n\nUnder “Users/Roles,” select “Manage Roles.”\n\nClick on the role you created for the CPA in Step 1.\n\nIn the “Permissions” tab, you can customize access levels for different areas of NetSuite.\n\nClick on each category to expand and view the specific permissions.\n\nSelect the appropriate access level for each category, such as “Full,” “Edit,” “View,” or “None.”\n\nOnce you have assigned the desired permissions, click “Save” to apply the changes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively assign permissions to the role of your CPA in NetSuite.\n\nStep 3: Create a New User for the CPA\n\nTo create a new user for your CPA in NetSuite, follow these steps:\n\nCreate a new user account for the CPA.\n\nFill in the required information, such as name and email address.\n\nAssign a unique username and password for the CPA.\n\nSpecify the role for the CPA, granting them the appropriate access level.\n\nSet up two-factor authentication for added security.\n\nShare the user credentials with the CPA to allow them access to NetSuite.\n\nFun fact: NetSuite is a cloud-based business management software that offers comprehensive solutions for various industries.\n\nStep 4: Assign the New Role to the User\n\nTo assign a new role to a user in NetSuite, simply follow these steps:\n\nGo to the NetSuite dashboard and navigate to the “Employees” tab.\n\nSelect the user to whom you want to assign the new role.\n\nClick on the “Roles” tab and choose the appropriate role from the available options.\n\nSave the changes to update the user’s role.\n\nAssigning the correct role to a user is crucial in NetSuite as it ensures they have the necessary access and permissions. This is essential for maintaining data security and ensuring efficient performance of tasks by the CPA. Fun Fact: NetSuite offers granular control over user access levels, ensuring compliance with data privacy and security standards.\n\nStep 5: Set Up Two-Factor Authentication for the User\n\nTo set up two-factor authentication for a user in NetSuite, follow these steps:\n\nCreate a new role for the user in NetSuite.\n\nAssign permissions to the role, including the ability to enable two-factor authentication.\n\nCreate a new user for the CPA and associate the new role with the user.\n\nSet up two-factor authentication for the user, following the instructions provided by NetSuite.\n\nShare the user credentials, including the two-factor authentication setup, with the CPA.\n\nBy completing steps 1-5, you can enhance the security of your NetSuite account and ensure that only authorized individuals have access.\n\nStep 6: Share the User Credentials with the CPA\n\nSharing user credentials with a certified public accountant (CPA) in NetSuite is a crucial step in granting them access to the system. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you with this process:\n\nCreate a secure method of communication with your CPA.\n\nProvide the CPA with the username and temporary password for the newly created user account.\n\nAdvise the CPA to log in to NetSuite using the provided credentials.\n\nEncourage the CPA to change their password upon initial login.\n\nRemind the CPA to keep their login credentials confidential and to log out after each session.\n\nShare the User Credentials with the CPA to allow them access to the system.\n\nIn the past, sharing user credentials was a common practice. However, due to security concerns, it is now recommended to follow strict protocols to protect sensitive information and ensure the integrity of data. By properly sharing user credentials with your CPA, you can maintain a secure and efficient working relationship.\n\nWhat Are the Different Levels of Access in NetSuite?\n\nIn order to effectively collaborate with your CPA on NetSuite, it’s important to understand the different levels of access available in the system. This section will dive into the three levels of access in NetSuite: full access, restricted access, and view only access. Each level provides varying degrees of control and visibility, allowing you to tailor access for your CPA based on their specific needs. Let’s take a closer look at each level and how it can benefit your collaboration efforts.\n\n1. Full Access\n\nFull Access in NetSuite allows CPAs to have complete control and visibility over all areas of the system. To grant Full Access to a CPA in NetSuite, follow these steps:\n\nCreate a new role for the CPA with full access.\n\nAssign permissions to the role, providing full access to all necessary features and data.\n\nCreate a new user for the CPA.\n\nAssign the new role to the user with full access.\n\nSet up Two-Factor Authentication for the user for added security.\n\nShare the user credentials with the CPA.\n\nBy following these steps, CPAs can effectively manage financial data, perform audits, and generate reports within NetSuite.\n\n2. Restricted Access\n\nRestricted access in NetSuite allows CPAs to have limited permissions and capabilities within the system.

View Only Access feature.\n\nCreate a new user account for the CPA.\n\nAssign the newly created role to the user.\n\nSet up two-factor authentication for added security.\n\nShare the user credentials with the CPA.\n\nBy granting view only access, the CPA will be able to review financial data and reports in NetSuite without making any changes or modifications to the system.\n\nHow to Revoke a CPA’s Access in NetSuite?\n\nIf you have granted a CPA access to your NetSuite account but no longer need their services, it is important to revoke their access to protect your sensitive financial information. In this section, we will discuss the step-by-step process of revoking a CPA’s access in NetSuite. This includes removing their role assignment, disabling their user account, and resetting their password. By following these steps, you can ensure that your financial data remains secure and confidential.\n\nStep 1: Remove the User’s Role Assignment\n\nTo remove a user’s role assignment in NetSuite, follow these steps:\n\nLog in to your NetSuite account as an administrator.\n\nNavigate to the “Setup” menu and select “Users/Roles” and then “Manage Roles.”\n\nLocate the role assigned to the CPA and click on it.\n\nIn the role details, click on the “Users” subtab.\n\nFind the user assigned to the role and click on the “Remove” button next to their name.\n\nConfirm the removal by clicking “OK” in the confirmation prompt.\n\nRemoving the user’s role assignment will revoke their access to the designated role and its associated permissions in NetSuite.\n\nStep 2: Disable the User Account\n\nTo disable a user account in NetSuite, follow these steps:\n\nLog in to NetSuite as an administrator.\n\nGo to Setup and click on Users/Roles.\n\nSelect Manage Users.\n\nFind the user account you want to disable and click on Edit.\n\nIn the user record, uncheck the “Active” box.\n\nClick Save to disable the user account.\n\nOnce the user account is disabled, the user will no longer have access to NetSuite. It is an important step in revoking access for a CPA or any other user who no longer needs access to the system.\n\nStep 2: Disable the User Account.\n\nNetSuite is a cloud-based business management software that integrates various functions such as accounting, finance, and customer relationship management.\n\nStep 3: Reset the User’s Password\n\nTo reset a user’s password in NetSuite, follow these steps:\n\nLog in to NetSuite with your administrator account.\n\nGo to Setup > Users/Roles > Manage Users.\n\nSelect the user for whom you want to reset the password.\n\nClick on the “Reset Password” button.\n\nProvide a new password for the user and confirm it.\n\nClick “Save” to finalize the password reset."
