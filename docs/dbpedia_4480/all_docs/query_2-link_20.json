        "text": "The ability to effectively monitor performance and streamline business processes requires seamless data integration across all levels of an organization. This means an ERP solution like NetSuite is often the answer. A recent study revealed that 68% of end-users adopt NetSuite for its ability to simplify business processes; while integrating customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning tools into a single, cloud-based system.\n\nAlthough NetSuite’s ERP and CRM solutions are comprehensive, users are often forced to look for integration solutions to meet growing business needs. A NetSuite integration platform helps to customize your cloud-based interface and optimize back-office functions based on your unique requirements.\n\nSince the ERP market is expected to reach $49.5 billion by 2025, competition for NetSuite integrations will only grow. In this article, we’ll look at what defines a NetSuite integration, the best NetSuite integrations on the market, and how to choose one that works best for your business.\n\nA Quick Overview of Netsuite\n\nAcquired by Oracle in 2016, NetSuite is one of the leading integrated cloud software suites for enterprise resource planning (ERP). It’s designed to help a business track financials, manage inventory, host e-commerce stores, and maintain customer relationship management (CRM) systems.\n\nNetSuite CRM and NetSuite ERP are the two software packages offered by NetSuite. These packages include a variety of NetSuite modules (a.k.a. NetSuite connectors) that can assist a business with any type of task, including use cases like:\n\nAccounts payable and accounts receivable\n\nGeneral ledger and journal entries\n\nMulti-currency and multi-language options\n\nProcessing credit cards, ACH, and EFT\n\nBank management and reconciliations\n\nBasic inventory and project management\n\nPurchasing and invoice approval (Workflow Manager)\n\nEmployee center\n\nOrder management\n\nUnderstanding NetSuite Integration\n\nA NetSuite integration is the practice of connecting a NetSuite deployment with other databases, systems, apps, and endpoints. A custom integration allows for NetSuite data to flow continuously between the NetSuite platform and other software in your environment. This can happen in one direction, or both ways.\n\nFor example, when new data enters NetSuite, it will automatically be made available to other systems, depending on your controls. There is no need to manually transfer data. That’s how smooth the integration process can be.\n\nNetSuite integrations allow a company to choose the best-in-class solutions in every situation. You don’t have to get rid of your favorite HR software or legacy CRM. Rather than sacrificing efficiency and accountability, NetSuite allows you to bring your best tools with you.\n\nIntegrations are incredibly useful for organizations that want to streamline the customer experience, organize backend processes, improve authentication of data, and utilize applications across teams.\n\nOptions for NetSuite Integration\n\nNetSuite integration can be approached in a few different ways:\n\nNative Integration\n\nNetSuite has pre-built integrations that connect with popular ERP apps like Google, Oracle, and Salesforce\n\nCoded Integration\n\nHand-coded integrations are more customized than native integrations. These require regular maintenance from your services partner and are typically sold to IT teams.\n\nNetSuite Integration Platforms\n\nPerhaps the most popular method is to use a tool that is already built to connect with the NetSuite environment. These configurable, third-party platforms help companies get the most out of NetSuite and are the key to maximizing the system’s value.\n\nNetSuite works with custom CRMs and multiple CRM/MAP instances. NetSuite integration platforms typically have a native integration with a no-code customization option. These are highly configurable, packaged solutions that can reduce requirements for technical resources, speed up integrations, and facilitate focused financial management.\n\nThere are also standard connections that minimize the need for extra customization. Pre-built workflows instantly automate data synchronization between objects and integrated processes, so there’s no longer a need for manual data entry, data exports, or costly delays.\n\nPerks of Integrating with NetSuite\n\nWhen your enterprise software and legacy systems work together, everyone wins. Some of the benefits of NetSuite integration can include:\n\nImproved Communication – Integrations make it easier to open up the lines of communication between a company and its vendors, partners, and customers. For example, NetSuite integrations help e-commerce companies get much-needed information faster like product shipments, catalog prices, and order statuses. You can also set restocking and inventory tasks to autopilot.\n\nGreater Accuracy – Rather than manually copying data over, everything is automatically transferred. Customer data is kept intact, reducing errors and helping your brand save money.\n\nFaster Workflow – By immediately sharing data between the two systems, and the rest of your IT ecosystem, it becomes easier to automate and speed up your workflow.\n\nSmoother Processes – NetSuite integrations provide an end-to-end view of your business processes. For example, a company can track an order from the time it was placed, all the way through the supply chain, until it’s in the hands of the customer.\n\nSmarter Decision-making – Integrations help to enhance important decisions by pooling your data sources and aggregating the information into a single spot. This helps to better understand the health of your business in real-time and make more informed decisions as you go.\n\nHow to Set Up Netsuite Integration\n\nTo get started with NetSuite integration, you’ll probably need to create a NetSuite account first. In the Setup tab, click on Integration > Web Services Preferences in the dropdown. If you aren’t sure and need help, a NetSuite administrator can set up a user account and grant access to the right permissions.\n\nNetSuite integration may require the use of one or more NetSuite technologies, such as:\n\nSuiteTalk Web Services\n\nSuiteCloud\n\nSuiteScript\n\nSuiteTalk is a web services tool for integrating with NetSuite through third-party systems. Coding can be used in any programming language, with benefits including real-time data integration, built-in support for ERP, CRM, and e-commerce products. It also includes advanced security and error-handling functions.\n\nOf course, not every business has the time or in-house staff to proficiently use SuiteTalk or SuiteScript. In this case, companies select a prebuilt connector or NetSuite integration platform that can get you up and running fast.\n\n#2) AvidXchange\n\nAvidXchange is an accounts payable and payment processing platform that provides customers with access to a network of over 700,000+ vendors across different industries.\n\nThe invoice management platform boasts over 220 integrations and automates the entire invoice-to-pay-to-reconciliation process. E-payment, custom workflows, and B2B billing are just a few of the features you can expect when implementing AvidXchange.\n\n#3) Stampli\n\nStampli is a provider of AP automation software as a NetSuite integration. The solution includes a collaboration hub, invoice capture, coding, internal controls, dashboards, and more. The end-to-end platform gives a business full control over corporate spending from payments to cards, to invoicing.\n\nStampli offers advanced AI capabilities that help a business simplify GL coding, identify duplicate invoices, and automate the approval process. The solution supports both PO and non-PO purchases, is easy to set up, and has a short learning curve.\n\n#4) Pairsoft.com\n\nPairSoft.com is one of the best NetSuite integrations for 3-way invoice creation, intelligent OCR technology, and a detailed audit trail. The platform helps a business store documents in a secure and centralized repository, assisting over 2,000 accounting and procurement departments around the world.\n\nThe PairSoft solution has a proven track record of helping companies of any size implement dynamic AP solutions that save a brand both time and money. The aggregated procure-to-pay solution has smart document recognition capabilities to automate indexing and relieve staff from monotonous data entry.\n\n#5) Docupeak\n\nDocuPeak is a premier robotic process automation (RPA) platform tool for NetSuite, from start to end. The platform directly integrates with NetSuite and eliminates the need for manual data entry. DocuPeak streamlines approval workflows and increases document visibility.\n\nThe DocuPeak program is designed for creating electronic workflows and provides a seamless experience from on-premise activities to the cloud. Break away from tedious processes in NetSuite and allow DocuPeak to become your secure, financial data repository.\n\nHow to Choose the Best Integration for Your Business\n\nOnce you have a few NetSuite integration options to mull over, now is the time to start accounting for and making a list of all of your third-party apps, legacy systems, and current software.\n\nAsk every team member to list what they use to make sure you don’t miss anything. Identify critical business processes and tools that must be worked around. This will prove a good starting point for what you decide to buy in terms of NetSuite integrations.\n\nYou need a pre-defined process for each workflow to determine exactly what you want to integrate into NetSuite. Consider all of these factors:\n\nUser-friendly integration system\n\nTop 3-5 business needs\n\nPick a scalable integration system\n\nSelect a versatile and future-proof solution\n\nGo for something that promises security\n\nChoose something you can afford\n\nThe finance team at PrinterLogic researched multiple accounts payable NetSuite integrations before they found Tipalti’s global payables solution. It was the key to organizing their broken payments process. As Jocelyn Olsen, Senior Staff Accountant put it:\n\n“We’re growing every month, so it’s very convenient for me to not have to worry about our bills. I enter them, I know that they get synced to NetSuite, and I don’t have to think about anything else. Tipalti was able to save me 15 to 20 hours a month.”\n\nConclusion\n\nAccording to a recent study, ERP implementation has led to business process improvement for 95% of businesses. However, you need to have the right integrations to keep the train moving. When done correctly, NetSuite integrations have many different advantages. However, just like any other enterprise project, it comes with some challenges.\n\nIf you lack the technical expertise, consider a mature, feature-rich data integration tool to assist with the process. Plan integration projects well in advance, especially when implementing a new platform. When formulating a data integration strategy, consider both the cost of the products, as well as the implementation costs."
