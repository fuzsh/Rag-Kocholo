        "text": "What is NetSuite, and why should it matter to your business? Simply put, it is a powerful tool that can help you manage and execute critical operations across multiple departments and functions. But, if you arenât familiar with NetSuite, its relevance and business value may not be immediately apparent.\n\nThatâs why we brought our SaaS experts together to dive into the nitty-gritty of what NetSuite is, how it works, and who stands to benefit most from this software.\n\nWhat is NetSuite?\n\nOracle NetSuite is a cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) software platform. It helps manage critical business operations, including:\n\nFinancials.Â\n\nInventory management.Â\n\nHuman resources (HR).Â\n\nE-commerce.Â\n\nCustomer interactions.Â\n\nNetSuite is widely used across organizations of various sizes and industries due to its scalability, flexibility, and ability to streamline and support key business processes. In fact, Netsuite is currently the top-purchased ERP tool on the Vendr Buying Platform, with 10x more purchases than competitors such as Workday and Certinia. Vendr data also shows that Netsuite was the 8th most renewed SaaS product in 2023.\n\nERP vs. CRM: how they're different\n\nERP and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools are both software systems that help businesses manage different aspects of their operations.\n\nERP systems typically cover finance-related business functions like HR, supply chain management, and manufacturing, to name a few. ERP systems are therefore used across a wide range of industries, including healthcare and manufacturing, and are often managed by teams involved in finance, production, and procurement.Â Â\n\nIn contrast, CRM systems specialize in managing customer information and augmenting sales and marketing efforts to boost satisfaction and profitability. CRMs often include lead and contact management features, marketing automation, and other features critical for marketing and sales teams. CRMs will also integrate with your tech stack to support omnichannel customer communication and campaign management.\n\nNeSuite vs. other popular business solutions\n\nBelow we break down how Netsuite compares to other top business solutions like Salesforce, Quickbooks, and Oracle ERP Cloud. We've also put together a complete guide to the top Netsuite competitors, check it our for more info.\n\nNetSuite vs. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce is a CRM platform that provides a management system for customer interactions, sales processes, and marketing campaigns.\n\nNetSuite, on the other hand, is a cloud ERP software that offers a comprehensive suite of business applications beyond CRM. It provides a single place to support and manage core functions of a company's operations, including financial management, inventory management, procurement, e-commerce, and project management.\n\nNetSuite vs. Oracle ERP Cloud\n\nNetSuite and Oracle ERP Cloud are both software solution providers aimed at streamlining business processes, but they cater to different market segments and offer distinct approaches. Oracle, a multinational technology company, acquired NetSuite in 2015, which means they are the parent company for both of these tools.Â\n\nOracle ERP Cloud typically caters to larger enterprises with highly complex requirements and significant IT resources and capabilities. Meanwhile, NetSuite focuses on simpler, more manageable ERP implementation for small- to mid-sized companies.\n\nNetSuite vs. QuickBooks\n\nNetSuite and QuickBooks are both widely used as accounting software solutions, but they cater to different business needs and sizes. QuickBooks, developed by Intuit, is primarily designed for small businesses or startups with very little complexity, accounting knowledge, and often minimal resources to dedicate toward accounting.\n\nNetSuite is a comprehensive cloud-based ERP platform designed to support the needs of growing businesses, mid-sized companies, and subsidiaries of larger enterprises. It provides scalability, customization options, and advanced functionalities that cater to businesses with more complex operations and scalability requirements.\n\nWe put together a comprehensive guide comparing Netsuite and Quickbooks, check it out for a more detailed breakdown.\n\nNetSuite plans (and how Vendr can help you save)\n\nNetSuite offers various plans tailored to different business needs and sizes, including:Â Â\n\nSuiteSuccess.Â\n\nStandard Edition.Â\n\nMid-Market Edition.Â\n\nEnterprise Edition.Â\n\nOneWorld.Â\n\nNot sure what plan is right for your organization?
