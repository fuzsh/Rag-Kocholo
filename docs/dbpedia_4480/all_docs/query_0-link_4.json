        "text": "By Pam Fulmer\n\n​Oracle America, Inc. (“Oracle”) has moved to dismiss in response to a class action lawsuit complaint involving its SuiteSuccess ERP solution filed in the Northern District of Ohio. The Complaint, filed by Realscape Group LLC d/b/a Realogic Solutions against Oracle America, Inc., alleges that Oracle defrauded small to medium-sized businesses by selling them NetSuite software under false pretenses. Oracle purportedly marketed the software as an \"off the shelf\" solution requiring minimal implementation, but in reality, the software was not functional without extensive customization. Oracle is accused of misleading businesses into financing agreements, then selling these contracts to third parties while failing to ensure the software's functionality, which effectively relieved Oracle of its obligation to perform while guaranteeing that customers must continue to pay for deficient or non-existent work. The lawsuit seeks to certify a class of businesses with under 1,000 employees who purchased NetSuite software in the past four years and paid for implementation services but did not receive fully functioning software.\n\nOverview of Oracle's Motion to Dismiss\n\nOracle's motion to dismiss hinges on several key arguments, each targeting different aspects of Realogic's claims:\n\n1. Mandatory Forum-Selection Clause: Oracle argues that Realogic's case should be dismissed or transferred to the Northern District of California based on the forum-selection clause in their contract.\n\n2. Failure to Provide Notice and Opportunity to Cure: Oracle claims Realogic did not provide the required written notice of breach and a chance for Oracle to cure those breaches before filing the lawsuit.\n\n3. Integration Clause and Lack of Specific Delivery Date: Oracle points to the contract's integration clause and the absence of any specified date for software delivery, countering Realogic's breach of contract claims.\n\n4. Limited, Exclusive Warranty: Oracle asserts that the contract's limited, exclusive warranty precludes the breach of warranty claims.\n\n5. Economic Loss Doctrine: Oracle argues that claims for unjust enrichment, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation cannot stand because they are rooted in contractual obligations and are barred by the economic loss doctrine.\n\n6. Declaratory Relief: Oracle states that Realogic’s claim for declaratory relief is not an independent cause of action and should be dismissed.\n\nAnalysis of Contract-Based Arguments\n\n1. Forum-Selection Clause\n\nOracle's Argument: Oracle asserts that the contract mandates any legal disputes be resolved in California courts, thus the case should be dismissed or transferred from Ohio to California.\n\nPotential Weakness:\n\n• Enforceability Under Fraud Allegations: Courts may not enforce forum-selection clauses if the plaintiff can demonstrate that the clause itself stemmed from fraud or overreaching. Realogic could argue that the entire agreement, including the forum-selection clause, was induced by fraudulent misrepresentations by Oracle. Oracle relies on its Subscription Services Agreement (“SSA”), which is found in a grayed-out hyperlink on the Estimate Form, which Oracle claims is the governing agreement. The hyperlink appears to be intentionally designed to be inconspicuous and is not set off in a different color or highlighted in any way. Clicking on the link does not take the reader directly to the agreement. Instead, the reader is forced to search around on the Oracle website for the relevant agreement. Most Oracle SuiteSuccess customers who we have spoken with do not even know that the SSA exists. A court could find that such a contract procured by fraud and under these circumstances should not be enforceable.\n\n2. Failure to Provide Notice and Opportunity to Cure\n\nOracle's Argument: Oracle argues that Realogic did not follow the contractual obligation to provide notice of the breach and an opportunity to cure the issue before filing the lawsuit. As discussed above, most Oracle customers are unaware of the notice provision of the SSA because they are unaware of the very existence of the SSA. As a result, they fail to give notice of breach pursuant to this provision. Instead, if Oracle is unable to deliver the promised solution, Oracle customers typically request that the contract be “cancelled”. Usually Oracle, without citing to the termination for cause provision of the SSA, then tells the customer that they cannot cancel. The entire practice is very deceptive.\n\nPotential Weakness:\n\n• The Contract was Fraudulently Induced: As discussed above, Realogic may argue that the contract was fraudulently induced and the contract should be void. But as currently pled, the Complaint does not have a fraud in the inducement claim. Realogic’s time for responding to the Complaint has not run. It will be interesting to see if Realogic amends to assert a fraud in the inducement claim.\n\n• Unilateral Mistake: Oracle customers are mistaken about a material fact, and Oracle knew or should have known of the mistake and took advantage of it. The material fact being that Oracle knows that most customers are unaware of the SSA, and the requirements for providing notice of breach or notice of deficient work under the warranty provisions. They exploit the customer’s mistake and lack of knowledge to game the relationship.\n\n• Unconscionability: The customers that Oracle appears to target for its SuiteSuccess solution are usually unsophisticated small mom & pop owned businesses. Indeed, many businesses are owned by a husband-and-wife team. The companies do not have legal departments. They are more like consumers, and have no chance against a large, sophisticated entity like Oracle.\n\n• Ambiguity in Notice Requirements: Realogic may argue that the notice and cure provisions were not clear or were otherwise impractical given the circumstances of the alleged breaches. They might also argue that immediate legal action was necessary due to the extent of the alleged fraud and resulting damages.\n\n3. Integration Clause and Lack of Specific Delivery Date\n\nOracle's Argument: Oracle claims the contract's integration clause invalidates any prior oral agreements, and the contract did not specify a delivery date for the software.\n\nPotential Weakness:\n\n• Reliance on Prior Representations: Realogic could argue that they relied on Oracle’s verbal promises regarding the delivery date and that these promises were material to their decision to enter into the contract. This could invoke the concept of promissory estoppel, where a party is prevented from going back on a promise even if a formal contract were not signed concerning that promise.\n\n• Fraud in the Inducement: Under California law, an argument can be made that an integration clause does not preclude evidence of oral misrepresentations that induced a contract. This is because the law allows for claims of fraud in the inducement of a contract, even when an integration clause is present. We are not sure what the law is in Ohio, but this will be an interesting issue to watch if the case stays in Ohio and is not transferred to California, and the Court declines to apply California law. One issue with these SuiteSuccess cases is always the time to go live. Typically, the parties discuss the time to go live in pre-contract execution discussions because this is material to most SuiteSuccess customers and induces them into going with the Oracle solution, rather than that of a competitor. Although this is a major topic of conversation, and Oracle sales provides dates for go live, when Oracle tenders the contract it has no “go live” date specified. Oracle SuiteSuccess customers should request in writing that the contract specify a go live date, and if Oracle declines to provide one, perhaps the customer should take a pass. Also, the customer should require that Oracle provide a copy of the complete contract upfront so that the customer has a chance to meaningfully review it, and not allow Oracle to dump it on the customer at the last moment and then claim that discounts will go away unless it is immediately signed. Finally, require that Oracle provide a PDF copy of all agreements contained in the hyperlinks well before contract execution, and this includes the SSA. Then review the contracts carefully, preferably with legal counsel.\n\n4. Limited, Exclusive Warranty\n\nOracle's Argument: The contract contains a limited, exclusive warranty which precludes Realogic's claims for breach of warranty.\n\nPotential Weakness:\n\n• Unconscionability of Warranty Terms: Realogic might challenge the limited warranty as unconscionable if it leaves them and other customers without a meaningful remedy for Oracle’s failure to deliver the promised software functionality. Courts sometimes refuse to enforce warranty limitations that are found unfair or that significantly deprive one party of the contract's benefits. In its warranty provision, Oracle includes a sentence that says essentially that Oracle is not responsible for ensuring that the services meet the customer’s requirements or expectations. So essentially Oracle is not responsible if the solution does not work. A court could find this unconscionable.\n\n5. Economic Loss Doctrine\n\nOracle's Argument: Oracle contends that claims for unjust enrichment, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation are invalid because they do not exist independently of the contract, and are barred by the economic loss doctrine.\n\nPotential Weakness:\n\n• Exceptions to Economic Loss Doctrine: Realogic could argue that the economic loss doctrine does not apply if Oracle's actions amounted to fraud in the inducement or intentional misrepresentation, which are exceptions to the doctrine under California law. Furthermore, they might claim that the unjust enrichment claim is based on benefits conferred on Oracle beyond the scope of the contract. However, a fraud in the inducement claim would need to be added.\n\n6. Declaratory Relief\n\nOracle's Argument: Oracle argues that declaratory relief is not an independent claim, and depends on the other claims to be asserted. Oracle also argues that the Plaintiff’s allegations in the claim for declaratory relief are inconsistent with the breach of contract and breach of warranty claim so that those claims should be disregarded for declaratory relief. For the fraud-based claims and unjust enrichment, Oracle has moved to dismiss those claims and asks that the declaratory relief claim be dismissed should the Court dismiss those claims.\n\nPotential Weakness:\n\n• Relevance of Declaratory Judgment: Realogic may assert that while declaratory relief is not an independent cause of action, it is a necessary remedy to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the contractual obligations and to prevent further damage to Oracle customers from Oracle’s alleged breaches and related tortious conduct.\n\n• Declaratory Relief re Financing Agreement and Related OCC Assignments: A key issue raised in the Complaint involves the Oracle Credit Corporation (“OCC”) financing agreements and the enforceability of the assignments to third party financing institutions such as Banc of America Leasing, Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, Dext Capital and others. Essentially, Oracle offers to finance the costs of the solution and the implementation to sweeten the deal and induce the contracts. Then shortly after contract execution and usually before the implementation has had time to completely go off the rails, OCC assigns the financing agreement to a third party. Oracle’s clever financing contract scheme allows it to assign the financing agreement to a third party without the consent of the borrower. But the OCC contract also provides if Oracle can’t deliver the promised solution, the Oracle customer cannot interpose defenses that it may have against Oracle to cut off the payment obligations to the third parties. And litigious third parties such as Banc of America Leasing are hitting these SuiteSuccess customers with collection lawsuits, mainly in California state court in San Mateo County. So, it is a real weapon that Oracle and the financial institutions are welding against small and medium size Oracle customers. Importantly, Oracle seems to bring in the same cast of characters as the assignee banks. We believe that these banks have knowledge that many of the implementations fail and that is why the customer quits paying. So they do not appear to be bona fide assignees that come to the table without knowledge of the Oracle scheme. We hope that this issue gets litigated.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe will be watching with interest to see what the plaintiff does here. Will they amend and include a fraud in the inducement claim? Or will they oppose the motion on the merits? We will know shortly. Check back here for updates. The case is Realscape Group, LLC. v. Oracle America, Inc., Case Number 1:24-cv-00558 CEF, venued in the Northern District of Ohio.\n\n​\n\nTactical Law advises Oracle customers who have disputes with Oracle arising out of ERP related cloud and other Oracle contracts, including litigation and counseling arising out of OCC’s assignment of financing agreements to third parties and related collection actions.\n\nBy Pam Fulmer\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn an era where digital transformation dictates the pace of business evolution, software has become the backbone of enterprise operations. This surge in software dependency, coupled with a complex web of licensing agreements, has set the stage for an inevitable increase in software audits by enterprise software publishers. This blog post delves into the reasons behind this trend, its implications for businesses, and strategies to navigate the future landscape of software compliance.\n\nThe Rising Tide of Software Audits\n\nWhy Software Audits Are on the Rise\n\n1. Complex Licensing Agreements: As software solutions become more sophisticated, so do their licensing agreements. Enterprises often find themselves entangled in the complexities of these contracts, inadvertently breaching terms due to misunderstanding or oversight. This is especially true due to the extensive use of hyperlinks in enterprise software related agreements. Publishers such as Oracle, Microsoft and Quest extensively use hyperlinks to serve up key agreements. Before signing a license agreement, a prudent company should review and bring down PDF copies of these hyperlinked agreements and save them in one file. In addition, it is important to consider pushing back on language that would allow the publisher to unilaterally amend such agreements.\n\n2. Cloud Migration: The shift towards cloud computing adds another layer of complexity to software licensing. The dynamic nature of cloud environments, with scalable resources, makes it challenging for businesses to maintain compliance. And if a publisher conducts an audit and claims non-compliance, even if the audit findings lack merit the customer must deal with the threat of the publisher cutting off access to the cloud for non-payment.\n\n3. Revenue Recovery: For software publishers, audits are a significant revenue source. In the post-pandemic economy, as publishers seek ways to recover lost revenue, audits present a lucrative opportunity to enforce licensing agreements and identify non-compliance. We see this each day in our legal practice. In addition to formal audits, software publishers such as Oracle are notorious for their “soft audits”. In fact, companies in the United States are getting hit each day with Oracle’s soft audits of Java. We have previously blogged on these predatory audit tactics engaged in by Oracle. Our phone is ringing off the hook with companies who have innocently provided information to Oracle due to a soft audit, only to be hit by a demand for payment of hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. And these demands have only been exacerbated by Oracle’s move to a “Total Employee” model, and Oracle’s expansive definition of who is included in the definition of “Employee”. We have also blogged on this issue previously.\n\n4. Technological Advancements: The development of sophisticated tools and technologies has made it easier for publishers to monitor and enforce compliance remotely, increasing the frequency of audits. In fact, Oracle has included in its Java software the ability of the software to call home to Oracle. Oracle has been known to use this trail to contact companies and conduct a soft audit of Java.\n\nImplications for Businesses\n\n1. Financial Risk: Non-compliance can result in hefty fines and the need to purchase additional licenses, significantly impacting a company's financial health.\n\n2. Operational Disruption: The audit process can be time-consuming and disruptive, diverting resources from core business activities.\n\n3. Reputational Damage: Being found non-compliant can tarnish a company's reputation, affecting customer trust and future partnerships.\n\nNavigating the Future Landscape\n\nPreparing for the Inevitable\n\n1. Understanding Licensing Agreements: It's crucial for businesses to thoroughly understand their software licensing agreements. This may involve seeking legal advice to navigate the complexities of these contracts, including thoroughly reviewing all hyperlinks.\n\n2. Implementing Software Asset Management (SAM) Tools: SAM tools can help businesses monitor software usage and compliance in real-time, providing insights to manage licenses effectively and avoid non-compliance.\n\n3. Regular Audits and Compliance Checks: Conducting regular internal audits and compliance checks can help businesses identify and address potential issues before they escalate into major non-compliance findings during an external audit.\n\n4. Hiring Experienced Software Audit Defense Counsel: Software licensing agreements are complex and attorneys who have dealt with the various intricacies of the agreements and have successfully pushed back on audit findings need to be retained early to assist the company in best positioning itself to successfully weather the inevitable audit.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe landscape of software licensing and audits is becoming increasingly complex, with audits by enterprise software publishers set to rise. This trend poses significant challenges for businesses in terms of financial risk, operational disruption, and reputational damage. However, by understanding the intricacies of licensing agreements, leveraging technology, and implementing robust software asset management practices, businesses can navigate this challenging landscape. The key to thriving in this new era lies in preparation, proactive management, and a strategic approach to software compliance.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs we move forward, the importance of software compliance cannot be overstated. The rise in software audits is a reflection of the changing digital landscape and the increasing value placed on intellectual property. For businesses, the path to compliance is not just a legal necessity but a strategic advantage that can safeguard financial health, operational integrity, and brand reputation in the long run. By embracing the challenges and opportunities presented by this trend, enterprises can position themselves for success in the digital age.\n\nBy Pam Fulmer\n\n​\n\nWe at Tactical Law see signs that Oracle may be getting even more aggressive with its soft audits of Java, and we believe that 2024 may usher in more formal audits of Java as Oracle seeks to push customers into the total employee licensing metric that it announced in early 2023. As many commentators have noted, this metric can exponentially increase the licensing fees for those companies using Java. For example, Mr. Nitish Tyagi, co-author of the new Gartner research note in an article published in The Register, said, \"For large organizations, we expect the increase to be two to five times, depending on the number of employees an organization has. Please remember, Oracle defines employees as part-time, full-time, temporary, agents, contractors as in whosoever supports internal business operations has to be licensed as per the new Java Universal SE Subscription model.” The same article went on to say that “Gartner has also estimated that by 2026, one in five organizations using Java applications will be audited by Oracle, leading to ‘unbudgeted noncompliance fees.’ By the same year, more than 30 percent of organizations using Java applications won't be compliant with their Oracle contracts.” Our phones are certainly ringing off the hook from Java users who have been contacted by Oracle with large licensing demands and claims of monumental non-compliance gaps. Oracle uses its VMware argument, which we have blogged on previously, to try to inflate the alleged non-compliance gap. Therefore, you need to be very careful to only give them relevant details concerning your use of VMware, and not your entire environment if it is not relevant to the licensing obligation.\n\nThere may be a potential legal argument, however, that could cause a court to find this definition and any contract in which it is incorporated as invalid for being indefinite. This is because buried in the licensing definition itself may be a defect that could potentially be exploited against Oracle. Oracle’s definition of “employee” is breathtakingly broad: Employee “is defined as (i) all of Your full-time, part-time, temporary employees, and (ii) all of the full-time employees, part-time employees and temporary employees of Your agents, contractors, outsourcers, and consultants that support Your internal business operations. The quantity of the licenses required is determined by the number of Employees and not just the actual number of employees that use the Programs.” In trying to sweep in every possible contractor or consultant into its definition, Oracle may have created a problem for itself; an argument could be made that the contract is indefinite. For example, there could be litigation over what constitutes a contractor, outsourcer, or consultant in this context and what does it mean that they support a company’s “internal business operations”? Would a company need to count contract meal preparation services that provide the meals for the company cafeteria? Are these folks supporting a company’s internal business operations by feeding the employees so they can stay on campus and be even more productive? And, do you need to count every employee or contractor of the catering company, or only the ones that are on the corporate campus serving up the food? What about the grounds keepers that are mowing the lawn on the company grounds or pruning the trees on the corporate campus? Would these contract employees be included and are they supporting the company’s internal business operations? It is not very clear. I don’t anticipate that Oracle will get too into the weeds of these details when they license the Java initially. But what about three years into the Java subscription when the company is under audit, and Oracle might be able to use a large non-compliance gap to extract a new Java subscription? Would Oracle then take the position that the company had failed to disclose all of the contractors, outsourcers, etc., and needs to pay to cover a huge non-compliance gap? Would Oracle actually do this? I’ll let those of you out there who have experienced an Oracle software audit opine on the answer to that question.\n\nMost Oracle license agreements are governed by California law unless the parties agreed otherwise. California law requires that a contract must be reasonably definite in its terms to be enforceable. If a contract is so uncertain and indefinite that the intention of the parties in material particulars cannot be ascertained, the contract is void and unenforceable. A court will enforce a contract with an indefinite provision if the provision is not a material or essential term. The definition of “Employee” would seem to be very material to the contract. If the essential terms are so uncertain that there is no basis for deciding whether the agreement has been kept or broken, there is no contract. A contract may be rendered void where the indefiniteness is “so extreme as not to present anything upon which the contract may operate in a definite manner.” Whether a contract term is sufficiently definite to be enforceable is a question of law for the court.\n\nWe are looking into these and other legal issues involving Java licensing. If you have a dispute with Oracle involving Java, we may be able to help.\n\nBy Pam Fulmer\n\nReaders of this blog know that our firm is engaged every day in advising governmental entities and companies of all sizes how to successfully defend against aggressive enterprise software audits where software publishers often seek to unfairly inflate their audit findings by conducting predatory audits. Unfortunately, these audits are only on the rise, as enterprise software companies seek to maximize revenue, by often taking baseless legal positions not grounded in the contract, or even surreptitiously trying to switch out the old contract for a newer, more favorable one without proper notice. We advise our clients to stand firmly against capitulating to such tactics, because by giving in rather than fighting back, companies only find themselves victimized again a few years down the road. Rather than buying peace by making a large software purchase, many of the most notorious of these predatory software publishers will only view the company as an easy target in a future audit and strike again.\n\nA recent lawsuit filed in Utah state court against Quest Software, Inc. (“Quest”), an enterprise software company that we have dealt with often and that is notorious for conducting predatory audits, illustrates the point. On September 18, 2023, HealthEquity, Inc. (“HealthEquity”), a business services company designated by the IRS as a health savings trustee for health savings accounts for individuals and businesses, filed a complaint against Quest seeking various declaratory relief and asserting a claim against Quest for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In its lawsuit, HealthEquity tells the story of its recently acquired subsidiary, WageWorks which underwent a Quest audit in 2019. The Complaint alleges that WageWorks recognized that it did not have ideal controls in place to monitor usage of the Quest software. So rather than defend the audit aggressively, WageWorks made a large license purchase and in subsequent discussions with Quest asked for Quest’s advice as to what controls to put in place to ensure future compliance. The Complaint alleges that WageWorks and later HEI followed that advice and created a tracking system for Toad software access and “complied with those instructions to tightly control the number of employees who could access the Toad software products.” The Complaint goes on to allege that:\n\n“This level of control was accomplished with the use of assigned serial keys provided to WageWorks by Quest for each seat license it purchased. Despite doing as Quest instructed just a few years prior, HealthEquity was being told in 2023 that licenses were required for every employee who could potentially access any server or individual device on which the software products were installed, regardless of whether those individuals could, or did, actually access and utilize the Toad software itself. This was contradictory to the direction previously provided by Quest, and contrary to the governing contractual terms.” Comp. ¶ 9.\n\nCompanies that have suffered through a Quest audit will recognize this argument immediately. Quest, and other companies such as Oracle when making its VMware argument, appear to be executing on strategies to attempt to charge companies a licensing fee even when the software is not being used. According to the Complaint:\n\n“HealthEquity soon discovered that Quest’s audit processes were intentionally designed to include numerous individuals in its audit numbers who should not have been included as requiring licenses under the terms of the parties’ agreements. Specifically, HealthEquity’s audit report included any users who could access the servers on which the software was installed, rather than the users who could actually access and utilize the software products themselves. This over-inclusion resulted in the grossly inflated numbers in Quest’s “Reconciliation Summary.”” Compl ¶35.\n\nUpon information and belief, Quest’s audit practices and interpretation of contract terms to its customers have been intentionally designed for the bad faith purpose of over-estimating the extent of the customer’s deployment and license requirements. This provides the basis for Quest to make an inflated demand for payment of over-deployment fees contrary to the terms of the parties’ agreements. Quest then leverages these inflated audit results to push its customers to purchase additional licenses and extend the terms of their licensing relationship with Quest for an additional period of years.” Compl. ¶36.\n\nHealthEquity then alleges that although the Quest software contains tools that can confirm that no usage occurred, Quest ignores these tools because it prefers to use the inflated amounts as leverage to obtain the highest settlement possible.\n\nIn the case of Quest, this strategy is helped along by the fact that almost every year Quest changes the language of its standard licensing agreement, known as the Software Transaction Agreement (“STA”). These changes make the agreement more favorable to Quest and seek to take away rights from its licensees. In addition, Quest customers with older license agreements such as the one at issue in this lawsuit, govern the perpetual licenses purchased and contain clauses that say that no amendment to the agreement can occur without a writing signed by both parties. Nonetheless, and in contravention of its older agreements, Quest takes the position that by downloading updated versions of the software the customer is agreeing to the acceptance of the more recent STA, such as the 2018 STA promoted by Quest in this lawsuit. Compl. ¶39. This is problematic as later versions of the STA change key terms such as the choice of law and dispute resolution clauses. They also include language that allows Quest to charge the current list price for alleged over usage rather than the formerly negotiated price, and also includes penalties such as back maintenance & support and interest.\n\nBased on these and other contradictions in the various agreements, HealthEquity has sought declaratory relief. This is a good thing as it would be really helpful to have a court weigh in and hopefully put an end to some of these predatory tactics. In addition to the declaratory relief, HealthEquity has asserted a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In that regard, the Complaint has the following to say:\n\n“Quest violated this covenant by, among other things, providing instruction to HealthEquity as to how its license requirement would be calculated, how its compliance with license entitlement could be controlled, and the effects of installing Toad software products on a shared server in its environment. Quest then later asserted HealthEquity had violated its license agreements and was out of compliance with its license entitlement despite the fact that HealthEquity had closely followed Quest’s former guidance and tightly controlled access to the software products in its environment.\n\nQuest has harmed HealthEquity by intentionally, and with bad faith, using a so-called audit to wrongly accuse HealthEquity of software over-deployment in an attempt to coerce HealthEquity into paying significant sums of money to Quest to which Quest is not entitled. Quest’s bad faith and unfair dealing have forced HealthEquity to expend significant sums of money to defend against Quest’s illegitimate audit claims.\n\nDemonstrating its bad faith and unfair dealing, upon information and belief, Quest, as a matter of company policy and business strategy uses its audit group primarily to drive significant additional and undeserved revenue for Quest, not to ensure customer license compliance. Quest has executed this wrongful policy and strategy against HealthEquity.\n\nQuest did not comply with its obligation to act in good faith and to deal fairly with HealthEquity, and to act consistently with HealthEquity’s justified expectations arising from the parties’ agreements and prior dealings.\n\nQuest has failed to deal fairly and honestly with HealthEquity and has intentionally or purposefully destroyed and injured HealthEquity’s right to receive the fruits of its license purchases. For example, Quest’s actions, as alleged herein, have injured HealthEquity’s right to use its licenses within the terms of the parties’ agreements for the agreed upon purchase price.” Compl. ¶¶ 90-94.\n\nIn our view, the fact that this case needed to be filed shows how badly some enterprise software companies have run amuck with their audit abuses and unfair trade practices, and hiding the ball concerning various contractual provisions in undisclosed and hidden agreements. They are literally turning the entire law of contract on its head. Once upon a time, two companies would sit down at arm’s length and negotiate a deal and then they would document the deal in a writing. During the negotiation process risk would be accessed and allocated through price and other contractual means. Everything was above board, and the parties were rational actors knowing what they were getting in their bargained for exchange. That is the entire theory on which contract law is based. Our entire commercial system rests on this foundation. However, recently some enterprise software companies are turning this entire regimen on its head. Apparently, Quest tries to replace legacy agreements by surreptitiously slipping in new agreements with maintenance & support updates. Updates that are often performed by low-level employees who have no idea that Quest or another software company is going to claim that the agreement accompanying the maintenance & support update is the new governing agreement. Agreements that never reach the legal department and that the lawyers working for the company don’t even know exist until it is presented in the audit as a basis for a multi-million-dollar non-compliance claim. There is no fair notice here. Switching out choice of law, venue, audit clauses at will without sitting down and even notifying true decision-makers at the company that if they update their software they are agreeing to an entire new contract is not the way that contract law is supposed to work. Courts should put a stop to it and not let these abuses continue. We hope that HealthEquity wins its case.\n\nTactical Law will continue to monitor the progress of the lawsuit and provide updates periodically. The case is HealthEquity Inc. v. Quest Software Inc., Case Number 230906993 venued in the Salt Lake District, State of Utah."
