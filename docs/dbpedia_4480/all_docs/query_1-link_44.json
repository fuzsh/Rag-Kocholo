Get in touch with our team today!\n\nNetSuite's licensing cost begins with the concept of a “suite\". The type of suite you will need to license is formulated by the type of features you may want to deploy and the size of your organization.\n\nFor instance, in terms of the capacity required to be used within NetSuite; NetSuite categorizes these into three “levels” of Suites. These suites are NetSuite Limited/Starter Edition, NetSuite Mid-Market/Standard Edition, and NetSuite Enterprise/Premium Edition.\n\nAs your company expands, you simply acclimate your NetSuite subscription to meet your requirements; the transition is flawless. With NetSuite licensing, you never have to get anxious about a system migration once you've outperformed your current edition; you can simply just modify your licensing model.\n\nNetSuite - Business Value Assessment\n\nThe GSI Business Value Assessment (BVA) service helps C-level and IT executives conduct a strategic review of their business needs to ensure their NetSuite Solution is being fully utilized and not hindering their growth. The Business Value Assessment service is based on GSI’s extensive NetSuite knowledge across various industries and projects, such as implementations, upgrades, migrations, and services for organizations of all sizes and across numerous industry segments. It entails an initial consultation that analyzes a company’s current business situation; market, geographic, online and mobile growth plans; and a comprehensive review of their current software infrastructure and IT road map.\n\nThe GSI team then conducts a business analysis review, matching up the company’s business needs with capabilities and actual usage of their current software. Finally, GSI delivers a customized assessment that matches business growth and opportunity costs against the economics of their current software, the cost of a potential upgrade and/or the wisdom of complementing their system with a third-party software solution.\n\nFuture-Proof Your Business with GSI\n\nReady to Transform Your Business with NetSuite?\n\nDon't wait to improve your business operations.
