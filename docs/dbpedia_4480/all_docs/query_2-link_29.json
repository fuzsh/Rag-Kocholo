        "text": "We were awarded Partner of the Year in 2022 by NetSuite, meaning we are recognised by NetSuite due to our knowledge and expertise in using the software. It places us in a perfect position to support teams in streamlining their operations using bespoke cloud business software.\n\nWe can help you establish exactly which software solution will bring you the most benefit. Whether you need a completely new implementation, or a health check and optimisation of your existing NetSuite set-up, we will make sure your business gets exactly what it needs without waste or missing vital functions.\n\nNetSuite software is often a large investment. This makes it vital that you make the most of it, ensuring every team member who can benefit from it, does benefit.\n\nWe can offer tailored training across your entire team, to make sure they all know how to use your NetSuite software. We’ll show them the functionality that relates directly to their role, so they understand all the ways they can use it to improve their productivity.\n\nWe can look at your current NetSuite offering to ensure it is delivering the best possible Return on Investment (ROI).\n\nWe can highlight any functionality you are missing out on, and anything you are paying for unnecessarily. We do this based on the specific needs of your business to ensure our suggestions are always relevant and helpful.\n\nUsed effectively, NetSuite can streamline your operations, simplify processes and significantly boost growth. Yet many businesses fail to realise the full potential that NetSuite offers. This might be because teams don’t know how to use the software fully, or even because they are unaware of just how many helpful functions it has.\n\nOur NetSuite support services give you access to over 20 years of specialised knowledge and experience. We can guide you through integration and implementation to minimise disruption during the process. We can also offer training for your team and ongoing consultation to ensure you see the full benefits of your software."
