        "text": "In today’s increasingly competitive business landscape, it’s essential to ensure that whichever NetSuite solutions you plan to implement are not only the right fit for your unique company needs but are also built with sustainability and scalability to help you succeed.\n\nOftentimes, it can be beneficial (and more effective) to turn to a skilled NetSuite consultant for implementation guidance in order to save time and money while bolstering company growth.\n\nEverything you need to know about NetSuite Consultants:\n\nWhat is NetSuite?\n\nWhat does a NetSuite consultant do?\n\nWhen should you hire a NetSuite consultant?\n\nHow can a NetSuite consultant help your business?\n\nTypes of projects NetSuite consultants work on, with examples\n\nWhat is NetSuite?\n\nNetSuite is a cloud-based software that provides companies with better manage and understanding of financial and operational processes and functions. With proprietary tools for automating processes, gathering timely and accurate data, and more, NetSuite is instrumental in saving time, providing insight into company on goings from a single interface, and helping users foresee potential issues before they arise.\n\nWhat applications does NetSuite include?\n\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\n\nCustomer Resource Management (CRM)\n\nE-commerce\n\nInventory\n\nAccounting\n\nWhat does a NetSuite consultant do?\n\nA NetSuite consultant begins by assessing your company, processes and team to identify which NetSuite solutions are the best fit for your needs. Next, they outline operations that are easily transferrable to NetSuite, analyze them for potential risk, and provide a roadmap of your proposed NetSuite adoption strategy.\n\nAfter adoption takes place, a consultant will work with you and your team to consistently monitor, manage, and optimize your deployment on an ongoing basis, also providing hands-on training and recommendations for additional supporting technologies.\n\nOther skills of NetSuite consultants include:\n\nManaging, developing, evaluating, integrating, and optimizing software\n\nBusiness process re-engineering\n\nDeveloping and implementing system design strategies\n\nConducting infrastructure design and data migration\n\nWorking with client databases and managing client on goings\n\nProviding technical and functional support\n\nWhen should you hire a NetSuite consultant?\n\nIf you’re new to NetSuite, hiring a consultant from the get-go is vital to your success. Rather than potentially being misinformed and having to make decisions on the fly, you’ll receive access to a true industry expert who has conducted successful NetSuite implementations for clients in similar situations.\n\nIf you’re already up and running on NetSuite, hiring a consultant can be particularly beneficial for improving your current configuration and associated business processes.\n\nIt can also be helpful if you’re experiencing a period of rapid business change, such as extreme growth, M&A activities, or preparing to go public.\n\nHow can a NetSuite consultant help your business?\n\nConsolidates your accounting, planning, procurement, projects, and analytics endeavors under one platform\n\nSaves you time and money while making the most of your implementation, as many NetSuite consultants can negotiate a lower service price due to their exclusive standing with NetSuite\n\nAllows you to utilize powerful and intuitive tools and methodologies to enable end-to-end business transformations\n\nGives you better access to and acquisition of important company data, analytics reports, and customer insights\n\nProvides a boost in your team’s productivity as processes are streamlined and performance is measured, fostering more company-wide alignment\n\nGives you access to hands-on training and post-deployment support to save time and reduce costs while allowing you to make the most of your implementation\n\nTypes of projects NetSuite consultants work on, with examples:\n\nThe types of projects a NetSuite consultant works on can take many shapes, from automating business processes and analyzing company data to providing hands-on trainings to employees and working with clients and their related databases.\n\nLet’s take a look into one of the Bridgepoint Consulting team’s previous experiences as an example of the type of projects NetSuite consultants are often tasked with. For a more detailed look, please head to our NetSuite implementation case study.\n\nA high-growth SaaS company once came to Bridgepoint to help them prepare for an upcoming acquisition by a leading private equity firm. As part of the acquisition, our client was informed they had to migrate away from QuickBooks to NetSuite — and do so within just 3 months.\n\nOur NetSuite consultants began by conducting the necessary research to best understand our client’s priorities and develop sustainable strategies, eventually deciding to implement ancillary and merchant services within NetSuite alongside billing solutions to help them successfully meet their launch date.\n\nThis provided the client with transparent reporting, consolidated financials to present to the PE firm, and an easier acquisition process — all thanks to a successful NetSuite implementation.\n\nWhatever your company needs or situation looks like, NetSuite consultants bring a structured approach to identifying opportunities and outlining a roadmap for bringing these discoveries to life."
