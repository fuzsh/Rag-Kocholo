ERPs offer a single solution to manage most if not all business departments and processes.\n\nWhat makes ERP unique over using multiple software applications?\n\nIf you use multiple software applications to run your business, you may be missing out on opportunities to streamline your operations. An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system allows you to manage large amounts of data in a centralized solution, which makes analysis and gathering insights from the data easier and more efficient. With an ERP system, you receive full integration and communication across all departments in real-time avoiding missing information and saving time on manual consolidation of data.\n\nHow do I know I need an ERP system?\n\nYou are using multiple software systems or applications\n\nYou cannot access financial information about your business easily\n\nYou have too many manual and time-consuming processes\n\nYou are struggling to meet customer’s ever-changing demands\n\nYour IT processes are extremely complicated\n\nYour business is scaling quickly and current systems can’t adapt\n\nYou spend too much money on IT support services\n\nYou are looking at a future liquidity event such as capital raise, acquisition, or IPO\n\nHow To pick the right ERP?\n\nIf you’re starting the process of evaluating a new ERP system, we first recommend you review our recent blog post “12 Tips for Choosing the Right ERP Software”. Still need help deciding? Here are 3 free resources to help guide your journey:\n\nhttps://scalenorth.com/netsuite-vs-intacct-best-erp-software-guide/\n\nhttps://scalenorth.com/netsuite-brings-world-class-it-infrastructure-to-smes/\n\nhttps://scalenorth.com/microsoft-dynamics-vs-netsuite/\n\nWhat are the most important things to look for when choosing an ERP?\n\nScalability and Flexibility\n\nAn ERP system should be flexible enough to scale with a business’s needs.

NetSuite offers mobile and tablet capabilities, which along with its cloud architecture, means it can be accessed anytime from anywhere in the world.\n\nAnalytics\n\nBusiness intelligence is key to strategic success. An ERP system with built-in analytics capabilities can help you track KPIs and make more strategic and timely decisions. Plus, data will need to be accurate and available in real-time. NetSuite allows you to quickly consolidate cross-departmental data, updated in real-time, for improved visibility and analysis making it a key favorite amongst even the most data focused customers.\n\nModularity\n\nTop ERP systems like NetSuite are built from modules that can be connected together to form a seamless whole.
