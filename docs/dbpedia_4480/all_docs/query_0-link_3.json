Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Transcosmos shall be considered an Authorized Reseller under this Agreement.\n\n(b) NetSuite KK shall select third parties as Authorized Resellers that are best able to market and Sell the Localized Product in all potential markets for such Localized Product, including software companies, wholesale and distribution companies, service companies, advertising companies, agricultural businesses, manufacturers, non-profit organizations, and retailers, sufficient to maximize the Sales potential for the Localized Product in the Territory with respect to each such market segment.

For clarity, in any circumstance where NetSuite KK Sells Localized Product through an Authorized Reseller, both NetSuite KK and the Authorized Reseller shall be responsible for performing the obligations of NetSuite KK under this Agreement related to such Sales (including support obligations), and NetSuite KK shall be responsible under this Agreement for any failure of the Authorized Reseller to do so.\n\n3.5 No Conflicts. NetSuite KK represents and warrants to NetSuite that, as of the Effective Date, neither NetSuite KK nor any of its Affiliates markets, promotes, or distributes any products or services that provide substitute functionality for or that otherwise compete with the Localized Product (\"Competing Products\"), such as without limitation any products or services that provide customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning functionality. NetSuite KK shall notify NetSuite in writing at least (60) sixty days prior to NetSuite KK, its Affiliate or any Authorized Reseller doing so (including prior to appointing or using any new Authorized Reseller that does so).\n\n3.6 Support.\n\n(a) Subject to any obligations of NetSuite to provide second level support as set forth in Exhibit 3.6 of this Agreement, NetSuite KK shall be solely responsible for (i) and NetSuite shall have no obligation to honor, any representations or warranties provided by NetSuite KK or an Authorized Reseller with respect to the Localized Product, and (ii) providing support and maintenance to Customers and Authorized Resellers. All Sales and support personnel of NetSuite KK shall be reasonably trained and competent in the use of the Localized Product (and the advantages and benefits of the Localized Product over competing solutions), and NetSuite KK shall provide technical support promptly to all Customers and Authorized Resellers. Without limiting the foregoing, Sales and support personnel of NetSuite KK and, if requested by NetSuite, of Authorized Resellers, shall attend training offered by NetSuite, and NetSuite KK shall dedicate personnel to activities under this Agreement as agreed by the Parties. Support responsibilities of NetSuite shall be solely second level support as set forth in Exhibit 3.6, and NetSuite KK shall cooperate fully with NetSuite in connection with any support furnished by NetSuite.\n\n(b) NetSuite KK shall ensure that Customers contact NetSuite KK, or its Authorized Reseller, and not NetSuite, for support, provided that nothing shall preclude NetSuite and its designees from contacting Customers directly, including to discuss the Localized Product and any problems or issues experienced by the Customers, to address or diagnose any Customer issues or concerns, and to otherwise provide support to Customers. Without limiting the foregoing, if NetSuite KK or its Authorized Reseller fails to perform its support obligations under this Agreement, NetSuite shall have the right to provide support directly to Customers and Authorized Resellers and to charge NetSuite KK in the amount of NetSuite's then current fees that it charges for comparable support. NetSuite KK shall notify NetSuite promptly in the event that NetSuite KK or any of its Authorized Resellers receives any complaint, or other communication of concerns or issues, regarding the Localized Product or the use of the Localized Product and shall provide a copy or reasonable description of the complaint or communication to NetSuite with such notice.\n\n-5-\n\n(c) Support by NetSuite KK shall include: receipt of calls; problem and question intake; customer site visits for any reason; problem identification and diagnosis; efforts to create repeatable demonstrations of any issues; determining which problems require referral to NetSuite for in-depth analysis; distributing as appropriate new Documentation made available by NetSuite; and taking any other actions appropriate to resolve all Customer problems.\n\n4.

Such meetings may be attended (either in person or by teleconference) by mutually agreed personnel of both Parties and are for information purposes only and not binding upon either Party.\n\n4.2 NetSuite KK's Marketing and Sale. NetSuite KK shall use best commercial efforts to market, promote and Sell the Localized Product in the Territory. Such efforts shall include NetSuite KK and Authorized Resellers making regular Sales calls to Customers, participating in trade shows to market and demonstrate the Localized Product, prompt follow up of leads (including those identified by NetSuite), reporting customer responses and feedback to NetSuite, advising NetSuite regarding advertising and Sales promotions, informing NetSuite of customer requests and needs related to the Localized Product, informing NetSuite regarding Competing Products that are available in the Territory, and taking such other actions as NetSuite may advise will be helpful to maximize and facilitate the marketing and Sales of Localized Product in the Territory. NetSuite KK shall keep NetSuite fully informed regarding the activities of NetSuite KK and its Authorized Resellers with respect to Localized Product in the Territory, including progress against Marketing Plans.\n\n4.3 Marketing Materials; Localization.\n\n(a) NetSuite shall be solely responsible, and shall use reasonable efforts, to Localize the Product for the Territory. NetSuite KK shall cooperate as reasonably requested by NetSuite. Except for any Localization of Documentation to be performed by NetSuite as specified by NetSuite, NetSuite KK shall Localize all Documentation for the Territory in a manner acceptable to NetSuite. NetSuite KK shall obtain NetSuite's written approval before using any Sales or promotional material, or advertisements or training material, with respect to the Localized Product that have not been provided by NetSuite, including all Localized Documentation.\n\n(b) Subject to Section 4.3(a), NetSuite hereby authorizes NetSuite KK to reproduce the Localized Documentation and to distribute the Localized User Documentation to Customers, directly and through Authorized Resellers, as necessary to market and promote the Localized Product in the Territory and enable Customers to use the Localized Product. NetSuite KK agrees that no modifications or derivatives of the Documentation or Product, or of the Localized Documentation or Localized Product, shall be created without NetSuite's prior written consent.\n\n-6-\n\n4.4 Marketing Plans. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of each calendar year during the term, NetSuite KK shall provide NetSuite with reasonably detailed written plans for marketing and Sales activities for the Localized Product in the Territory for such calendar year. Each Marketing Plan shall be designed to fulfill NetSuite KK's responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and compliance with the Marketing Plans, NetSuite KK shall have full control and authority of its commercialization of Localized Product in the Territory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NetSuite shall have the right to suspend application of this Section 4.4 by providing written notice of such suspension for any specified calendar year. No suspension shall apply for more than one calendar year, unless expressly indicated to the contrary, and no such suspension shall be considered a waiver of this Section 4.4 for any other period.\n\n4.5 Marketing Assistance. Throughout the term of this Agreement, NetSuite shall provide NetSuite KK with mutually agreed marketing assistance, such as supplying NetSuite KK with English-language Sales materials and training materials as agreed by the Parties.\n\n4.6 Trademarks.\n\n(a) Display. All promotional materials for Localized Product shall display the NetSuite Trademarks and NetSuite KK Trademarks in a manner approved by NetSuite in writing. Without limiting the foregoing, if any NetSuite Trademark is to be used in conjunction with another trademark or trade name, then the NetSuite Trademark shall be presented equally legibly and equally prominently, but nevertheless separated from the other so that each appears to be a mark in its own right, distinct from the other mark. Except for the NetSuite Trademarks, and the NetSuite KK Trademarks, no trademarks, trade names, or logos shall be used to market or Sell the Localized Product without NetSuite's prior written consent. None of NetSuite KK, its Affiliates or any Authorized Reseller shall engage in any deceptive, misleading, illegal, unfair, or unethical marketing or practices related to the Localized Product or the NetSuite Trademarks.\n\n(b) License. NetSuite hereby grants to NetSuite KK a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty free license to use the NetSuite Trademarks for the term of this Agreement (i) to market and promote the Localized Product in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) as part of the NetSuite KK Trademarks to market and promote NetSuite KK's business and the Localized Products. All ownership and goodwill from the use of the NetSuite Trademarks, including as part of the NetSuite KK Trademarks, shall vest in and inure solely to the benefit of NetSuite. Any ownership interest obtained by NetSuite KK with respect thereto, and the associated goodwill, is hereby assigned and shall be assigned by NetSuite KK to NetSuite.\n\n(c) Recordation. NetSuite has the right to provide and record in the Territory a separate trademark license for NetSuite KK for the NetSuite Trademarks. NetSuite KK shall cooperate in the preparation and execution of such document. Upon termination of the trademark license set forth in this Section 4.6, NetSuite KK shall cooperate in the cancellation of any trademark licenses that have been recorded. All domain names through which the Localized Product are provided shall be registered in the name of NetSuite or its Affiliate or other designee. NetSuite KK shall not register any NetSuite mark or any other mark confusingly similar to any NetSuite mark.\n\n-7-\n\n(d) Trademark Infringement. NetSuite KK shall notify NetSuite promptly upon learning of any actual, alleged, or threatened infringement of a NetSuite Trademark or of any unfair trade practices, trade dress imitation, passing off of counterfeit goods, or similar offenses.\n\n(e) Approval of Representations. All representations of NetSuite Trademarks that NetSuite KK intends to use shall first be submitted to NetSuite for approval of design, color, and other details or shall be exact copies of those used by NetSuite and shall in all events comply with the usage guidelines established by NetSuite from time to time. NetSuite has the right to change its marks by providing ninety (90) days prior written notice, and an updated Exhibit 1.12 (if appropriate) to NetSuite KK. From and after the end of such ninety (90) day period, as so designated in NetSuite's notice, any mark that is to be deleted shall cease to be a NetSuite Trademark, and any mark that is to be added shall thereafter be considered a NetSuite Trademark, for purposes of this Agreement. NetSuite KK shall have the right to change NetSuite KK Trademarks only as mutually agreed by the Parties in writing.\n\n(f) Quality Control. Notwithstanding the license in Section 4.6(b), NetSuite KK shall not use the NetSuite Trademarks, including as part of the NetSuite KK Trademarks, with respect to any products or services, other than the Localized Product under this Agreement, unless NetSuite KK has obtained NetSuite's prior written approval and the Parties have agreed in writing on the terms and conditions under which NetSuite will monitor the quality of such products and services.\n\n4.7 Joint Press Release. The Parties shall issue only mutually acceptable press releases (\"Joint Press Release\"). All press releases shall be subject to the review and approval by each Party prior to release, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Throughout the term of this Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate in public relations activities, including with regard to the launch of the fully Localized Product.\n\n5. USE OF PRODUCT; REPORTING\n\n5.1 Administrators. Each of NetSuite and NetSuite KK will appoint an administrator who will serve as the primary point of contact with the other Party with regard to access to and use of the Localized Product, including with regard to desired provisioning of Customer accounts by NetSuite as more fully described in Exhibit 5.2. Each administrator may be changed by providing written notice of the change to the other Party. Product Orders.\n\n(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, NetSuite KK shall issue written Localized Product orders to NetSuite requesting that NetSuite provision the desired Customer accounts for Localized Product as more fully described in Exhibit 5.2. The form of Localized Product orders shall be as mutually agreed by the Parties, but shall at minimum include the information specified in Exhibit 5.2. NetSuite KK shall not issue an order for any Localized Product account sold through an Authorized Reseller unless NetSuite KK has received prepayment from the authorized reseller as described in Sections 6.2. No Localized Product order shall be considered accepted by NetSuite, except to the extent that NetSuite has provisioned the Customer account in the manner described in Exhibit 5.2. NetSuite has the right to update Exhibit 5.2 from time to time in its discretion by providing an updated Exhibit 5.2 to NetSuite KK.\n\n-8-\n\n(b) ANY TERMS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY LOCALIZED PRODUCT ORDER OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT GIVEN OR RECEIVED WHICH ARE ADDITIONAL TO OR INCONSISTENT WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL HAVE NO EFFECT AND SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED. FOR CLARITY, THE PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE EITHER PARTY FROM MAKING ANY CHANGES TO ITS POLICIES, REQUIREMENTS AND THE EXHIBITS AS EXPRESSLY CONTEMPLATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n5.3 Product Use Terms; Privacy Policy.\n\n(a) All access to and use of the Localized Product, including by NetSuite KK and its Authorized Resellers and the employees and contractors of any Customers, shall be subject to terms and conditions that are as protective of NetSuite and the Localized Product as the Product Use Terms and NetSuite's then current privacy policy, as updated by NetSuite from time to time. NetSuite KK shall require each Customer to agree, prior to any access or use by the Customer, to such terms and conditions and to the most recent version of NetSuite's privacy policy. The foregoing is not intended to limit NetSuite KK's agreement with the Customer to the Product Use Terms, and is not intended to require NetSuite KK to use the express Product Use Terms in Exhibit 1.17, provided that no agreement with a Customer shall be less protective of NetSuite and the Localized Products than the Product Use Terms or this Agreement, and NetSuite KK shall obtain NetSuite's advance written consent to the agreement that NetSuite KK uses with Customers. NetSuite KK shall obtain agreement by the Customer in the form of the Customer's signature or an equivalent indication by the Customer that binds the Customer to such a contract with NetSuite KK. For clarity, all contracts for access to and use of the Localized Product shall be between NetSuite KK or its Authorized Reseller, and the applicable Customer, and NetSuite's obligations shall be limited to its obligations to NetSuite KK under this Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including any terms and conditions, or click through agreement, on NetSuite's web site).\n\n(b) NetSuite has the right to modify and otherwise update the Product Use Terms by providing to NetSuite KK an updated Exhibit 1.17 reflecting the changes (which may include delivery by email), and has the right to update its privacy policy by posting an updated privacy policy on its web site. NetSuite KK shall require that each Customer, including existing Customers, agree to the updated Product Use Terms and privacy policy as a condition to continued access to and use of the Localized Product.\n\n(c) NetSuite KK shall use best commercial efforts to ensure that Customers comply with the Product Use Terms and shall notify NetSuite promptly upon becoming aware of any failure to comply, provide NetSuite with all information within its knowledge regarding such circumstance, and shall assist and cooperate with NetSuite as reasonably requested for purposes of remedying any such failure. NetSuite KK shall not Sell or otherwise make the Localized Product available to any party that has failed to comply with the Product Use Terms, unless approved by NetSuite in writing. NetSuite shall have the right to terminate all Customer accounts in accordance with the then current Product Use Terms and this Agreement, and NetSuite KK agrees that it will not make any inconsistent or conflicting commitment. NetSuite KK shall make NetSuite a third party beneficiary of, with the power to enforce against each Customer (including Authorized Resellers), all Product Use Terms for the Localized Product.\n\n-9-\n\n(d) No username or password shall be used, except in accordance with the Product Use Terms by, and for the benefit of, the Customer for which it is issued. All Customers shall be responsible for all use under their account, including the unauthorized use of any user name or password, and NetSuite KK shall notify NetSuite immediately if it becomes aware of any unauthorized use of any account, username or password.\n\n(e) NetSuite KK's and its Authorized Resellers' right to use the Localized Product includes the right to demonstrate the Localized Product to Customers in the Territory as necessary to perform its marketing obligations under this Agreement. With respect to all use by NetSuite KK, the Product Use Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement and shall be enforceable against NetSuite KK under this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.\n\n(f) NetSuite KK shall communicate to all Customers, either directly or through its Authorized Resellers, all Customer alerts and communications that NetSuite determines, in its sole discretion, need to be communicated to Customers.\n\n5.4 Customer Information. NetSuite KK shall provide, and hereby grants, to NetSuite sufficient rights and licenses with respect to all information, data, works, and other subject matter that is transmitted through or using, submitted to, received from, or otherwise provided to or by NetSuite, as a result of the use or operation of the Localized Product.\n\n5.5 Localized Product Changes. NetSuite has the right, from time to time in its sole discretion, without incurring any liability to NetSuite KK, its Authorized Resellers, or any Customers, with respect to any previously placed or accepted order, or any Customer agreement, to modify the design of, specifications for, or operation of, any Localized Product and to suspend and terminate the availability of any Localized Product. NetSuite will provide an updated Exhibit 1.16 to NetSuite KK reflecting any changes.\n\n6. Payments.\n\n6.1 Localized Product Payments to NetSuite. NetSuite KK shall make calendar quarterly payments to NetSuite, each of which shall equal a total of thirty percent (30%) of the Net Revenues received by NetSuite KK and its Affiliates (other than NetSuite) from Authorized Resellers and Customers during such calendar quarter. The reduction of the Pre-Pay Balance of any Authorized Reseller shall be considered \"receipt of payment\" for purposes of the foregoing. If NetSuite KK does not receive any payment from a Customer or Authorized Reseller within thirty (30) days after NetSuite has issued the username for the particular Customer, then NetSuite KK shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Agreement, on the last day of such thirty (30) day period, the amounts that the Customer or Authorized Reseller is to pay to NetSuite KK. Such amounts shall be deemed included in Net Revenues as of such date, and NetSuite KK shall make payment to NetSuite in accordance with this Section 6.1 above as if NetSuite KK had received such payment on such date. The quarterly payments under this Section 6.1 will be made within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter in which the amounts are received by NetSuite KK, as described above.\n\n6.2 Minimum Pre-Payments by Authorized Resellers. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of each calendar month (\"C1\"), NetSuite KK shall collect from each Authorized Reseller an amount sufficient to ensure that NetSuite KK's Pre-Pay Balance for that\n\n-10-\n\nAuthorized Reseller, after reduction for fees payable for Localized Product that the Authorized Reseller reasonably anticipates will be ordered in such calendar month C1, is no less than the Pre-Pay Minimum.\n\n6.3 Payment Statements. Within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter, NetSuite KK shall render to NetSuite a statement of account documenting the number of subscriptions to the Localized Product sold by NetSuite KK and Affiliates to Customers (including through Authorized Resellers) during such calendar quarter and NetSuite's and its Affiliates Net Revenue's for such calendar quarter. Such statement shall also set forth the Pre-Pay Balance for each Authorized Reseller as of the end of such calendar quarter.\n\n6.4 Hosting Fees. In addition to the fees set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, NetSuite KK shall pay fees to NetSuite for hosting and operating the Localized Product, as initially agreed by NetSuite and NetSuite KK and updated from time to time in accordance with this Agreement. Such hosting and operation by NetSuite will include using reasonable commercial efforts in establishing, maintaining, and operating servers and cache sites, and backup procedures, for efficient delivery of the Localized Product to Customers in the Territory. Such fees are non-refundable and non-creditable and shall become due and payable as agreed, or if not agreed, within thirty (30) days after NetSuite's invoice. NetSuite shall have the right to update such fees from time to time based upon changes in costs.\n\n6.5 Support Fees. The fees for the support and maintenance by NetSuite that is described in Exhibit 3.5 shall be as initially agreed by NetSuite and NetSuite KK from time to time in accordance with this Agreement.

If, outside of any scheduled maintenance and upgrades, NetSuite determines that the Localized Product has not been available at least 99.5% of the time during a calendar month, and to the extent that NetSuite KK has provided a credit or refund to the Customer for such calendar month as a result of the Customer's written request and the Localized Product down time, then NetSuite will provide a credit to NetSuite KK of the Localized Product price paid by NetSuite KK to NetSuite under Section 6.1 for such Customer if NetSuite KK requests such a credit for the particular Customer no later than fifteen (15) business days after the end of such calendar month. The amount of any credit shall not exceed a one month portion of the fee for Localized Product use under Section 6.1. NetSuite shall not be required to provide any credit unless the Customer was actually adversely affected by the down time. No credits will be provided for the amounts paid for any maintenance or support or hosting.\n\n6.7 Payment Terms. Unless expressly indicated to the contrary, all amounts set forth in this Agreement, or any Exhibit, are in US dollars, and all payments shall be made to NetSuite in U.S. dollars by bank wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by NetSuite.\n\n6.8 Currency Conversion. If any Net Revenues are received by NetSuite KK in Japanese Yen, then for purposes of calculating payments under this Agreement, such amounts shall be converted to US Dollars using the average of the buying and selling exchange rate for conversion between Japanese Yen and U.S. Dollars, for each business day of the applicable payment period, as quoted for current transactions reported by the Chase Manhattan Bank, averaged over such payment period.\n\n-11-\n\n6.9 Taxes and Government Charges. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of NetSuite KK hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, charges or withholdings imposed by any governmental authority (\"Taxes\"); provided, however, that if NetSuite KK shall be required to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 6.9) NetSuite receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made. NetSuite KK shall deliver to NetSuite the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such governmental authority evidencing payment of any such Taxes. If NetSuite is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty with respect to payments under this Agreement, then NetSuite, upon the written request of NetSuite KK, shall deliver to NetSuite KK such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by NetSuite KK as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.\n\n6.10 Sole Remuneration. NetSuite KK's sole remuneration for performing its responsibilities under this Agreement shall be the payments it receives from its Customers and Authorized Resellers, less the amounts payable to NetSuite under this Agreement.

All such records shall be made available for inspection throughout such three (3) year period by an independent third party auditor selected by NetSuite for the purpose of verifying compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Such inspections may be made no more than once each calendar year during the normal business hours of NetSuite KK upon ten (10) business days advance notice, provided that if a non-compliance is identified by an audit, then an additional audit may be conducted during such calendar year. NetSuite shall bear the costs and expenses of inspections conducted under this Section 6.11, unless a non-compliance is established, whereupon all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the audit will be paid by NetSuite KK.\n\n7. Ownership; Proprietary Rights.\n\n7.1 Ownership. NetSuite shall exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to all inventions, works of authorship, methods, documents, and other technology, data, information and subject matter generated, conceived, created or invented by or under authority of NetSuite or its Affiliates, whether solely or jointly with NetSuite or its Affiliates, and all other improvements,\n\n-12-\n\nupdates, enhancements, modifications, and derivatives of the Products and Documentation that are conceived or created, in connection with this Agreement, any Authorized Reseller agreement, or the Localized Product, including the Localized Documentation and Localized Product and all patents, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights concerning any of the foregoing in all countries of the world, including all applications and registrations for intellectual property (collectively the \"Work Product\"). With respect to any Work Product invented or created in whole or in part by NetSuite KK or its Affiliates or Approved Resellers, NetSuite KK and its Affiliates hereby assign, and shall assign, all right, title and interest in and to such Work Product to NetSuite. NetSuite KK and its Affiliates shall, without demanding any further consideration therefor, cooperate with NetSuite and provide all assistance requested by NetSuite that is reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to carry out and make effective the foregoing, including, without limitation, executing and filing assignments, applications, registrations, powers of attorney and other appropriate documents (including confirmatory assignments), providing appropriate consents and/or authorizations, and joining in any administrative or judicial action relating to the filing, prosecution or maintenance of any Work Product.\n\n7.2 License. NetSuite KK acknowledges that NetSuite desires not to receive in connection with this Agreement any information or technology related to its products, services, or business unless the information and technology can be used in any products and services, in NetSuite's discretion. Accordingly, prior to disclosing any information, know-how, Confidential Information, trade secrets, or other technology to NetSuite in which NetSuite KK, its Affiliate, or licensor, claims a proprietary interest that is not to be assigned to NetSuite under this Agreement, NetSuite KK shall provide a proposal to NetSuite in writing regarding the use and other exploitation of such subject matter by NetSuite. Following receipt of such proposal, NetSuite and such party shall confer concerning the proposal and agree in writing upon the terms, if any, under which such information, know-how, Confidential Information, trade secrets, or other technology may be used. Except as agreed in writing prior to disclosure of the information, know-how, Confidential Information, trade secrets, or other technology to NetSuite, NetSuite has the non-exclusive, perpetual, non-terminable, paid-up, royalty free, worldwide right and license, with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses, to incorporate all such information, know-how, Confidential Information, trade secrets, and other technology into products and services and to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, reproduce, distribute, transmit, publicly display and perform, and otherwise exploit such products, services and derivatives thereof.\n\n7.3 Proprietary Markings. Neither Party shall remove any trademark, trade name, copyright notice, patent marking, confidentiality, or other proprietary rights notice or marking from any materials provided to it by the other Party in connection with this Agreement.\n\n7.4 Right of First Refusal. In the event that NetSuite KK desires to engage in any transaction with a party headquartered outside the Territory (the \"Transaction\"), NetSuite KK shall notify NetSuite thereof in writing, describing in reasonable detail in such notice the potential Transaction. NetSuite KK hereby grants to NetSuite a right of first refusal to enter into an agreement with NetSuite KK for the Transactions. Accordingly, if NetSuite notifies NetSuite KK within sixty (60) days after receiving NetSuite KK's notice that NetSuite would like to negotiate an agreement between NetSuite and NetSuite KK to set forth terms and conditions to govern such Transaction between the Parties, the Parties shall negotiate diligently and in good faith to enter into a mutually acceptable agreement. If the Parties have failed to reach agreement for such Transaction,\n\n-13-\n\nthen NetSuite KK agrees that it will not enter into any agreement with another Party that is more favorable to such other Party than the terms and conditions previously offered by NetSuite KK to NetSuite unless NetSuite KK first offers such terms and conditions to NetSuite.\n\n7.5 No Other Rights. All right, title and interest in and to the Product and Localized Product are reserved to NetSuite, and no license is granted to NetSuite KK with respect to the Localized Product or Product under this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no rights are granted to NetSuite KK with respect to Documentation, and nothing shall be construed to prevent or limit NetSuite's direct and indirect marketing, distribution and Sale of any products or services in the Territory, including to Customers and through Authorized Resellers and other resellers.

In addition, each Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately by written notice upon the commencement of a petition, proceeding or case seeking the other Party's bankruptcy, or any insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or readjustment of its debts, or seeking the appointment of a receiver, trustee or the like of itself or its assets, or otherwise seeking relief from its creditors and, in the case of an involuntary petition, proceeding or case, such petition, proceeding or case continues undismissed for, or an order approving or ordering any of the foregoing is entered and is not stayed within, sixty (60) calendar days.\n\n8.5 Return of Property.

The acceptance of any order from or the provision of any Localized Product after the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not be construed as a renewal or extension of this Agreement nor as a waiver of termination of this Agreement.

Except to the extent that NetSuite is required to indemnify NetSuite KK under Section 11.1, NetSuite KK shall indemnify and hold harmless each of NetSuite and its Affiliates, and the directors, officers, employees, customers, licensors, and contractors of NetSuite and such Affiliates, and the successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (the \"NetSuite Indemnitees\"), from and against any and all liabilities, damages, settlements, claims, actions, suits, proceedings, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation) incurred by any NetSuite Indemnitee based upon a claim of a non-Affiliate third party to the extent resulting from: (a) a breach by NetSuite KK of any of its representations or warranties in this Agreement; (b) the negligence, or illegal or willful misconduct, of NetSuite KK, its Authorized Resellers, or any Customers in connection with this Agreement or any Localized Product; (c) any failure to support Customers or Authorized Resellers (other than as a result of a failure of NetSuite to perform its support obligations under this Agreement); (d) any representations, warranties, or covenants made with respect to the Localized Product, beyond the Product Use Terms or beyond the representations and warranties made by NetSuite directly to its other customers; (e) any information, data, or other subject matter transmitted or received by Customers using the Localized Product or otherwise delivered or transmitted to or by NetSuite as a result of the use or operation of the Localized Product; or (f) otherwise arising out of the marketing, promotion, commercialization or use of the Localized Product pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n11.3 Procedure. A Party that intends to claim indemnification under this Article 11 (the \"Indemnitee\") shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Indemnitor\") in writing of any claim, in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification, and the Indemnitor shall have sole control of the defense and settlement thereof. The indemnity arrangement in this Article 11 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any action with respect to a claim, if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably. The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the commencement of any action with respect to a Claim, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Article 11 but the omission so to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to any Indemnitee other than under this Article 11. The Indemnitee under this Article 11 shall cooperate fully with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any action with respect to a claim covered by this indemnification, at the Indemnitor's expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that the Indemnitor has performed its obligations in accordance with this Article 11, the Indemnitor shall not be responsible for any costs or expenses incurred without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor.\n\n12.

The failure of either Party to enforce or to exercise, at any time or for any period of time, any right or remedy arising pursuant to or under this Agreement does not constitute, and shall not be construed as, a waiver of such right or remedy and shall in no way affect that Party's right to enforce or exercise it at a later time, provided that such right or remedy is not time-barred or otherwise precluded by law or by a writing expressly waiving such right or remedy and signed by that Party seeking to assert such right or remedy.\n\n14.14 Exhibits.

Activation; Localized Product Provider; Use Terms.\n\n(a) Localized Product Provider. End User acknowledges and agrees that the Localized Product is being provided by NetSuite, Inc. or its affiliate (individually and collectively, \"NetSuite\"), as an application service provider, to NetSuite KK and that NetSuite KK (and not NetSuite) is selling the Localized Product to End User. Accordingly, NetSuite KK, and not NetSuite, shall be solely responsible to End User for the Localized Products, the Web Site and the operation and use thereof, notwithstanding any NetSuite branding on the Web Site. End User shall contact NetSuite KK, and not NetSuite, with respect to the Localized Product and Web Site, including to obtain any related support or assistance, report any problems, or the like.\n\n(b) Activation. To activate End User's access to and use of the Localized Product and the Web Site, End User must read and agree to these Product Use Terms, including all disclaimers and limitations of liability, and limitations on access to and use of the Localized Product and the Web Site. The Product Use Terms shall govern all access to and use of the Localized Product and Web Site. No activation shall be effective, however, until the account is actually provisioned by NetSuite as described in Exhibit 5.2 of the Agreement, and NetSuite KK has the right to terminate this Agreement should NetSuite not agree to provision the account. All information provided by End User to activate an account shall be accurate and complete.\n\n(c) Netsuite; Third Party Beneficiary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, including any terms or conditions and privacy policy posted on the Web Site, NetSuite shall have no obligation, responsibility or liability to End User arising out of or related to the Localized Product, Web Site, or the operation or use thereof, or any ancillary products or services provided by NetSuite KK. In particular, the only obligations and responsibility to End User regarding the Localized Products and Web Site shall be those by NetSuite KK as expressly set forth in these Product Use Terms. END USER AGREES THAT IT, AND ITS AFFILIATES AND USERS, SHALL NOT\n\nASSERT OR BRING ANY CLAIM OR ACTION AGAINST NETSUITE OR ITS AFFILIATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOCALIZED PRODUCT, THE WEB SITE, OR THE PERFORMANCE OR USE THEREOF, WHETHER BASED UPON THESE PRODUCT USE TERMS OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING FOR ANY FAILURE OF THE LOCALIZED PRODUCTS AND INCLUDING BASED UPON ANY ANCILLARY OR RELATED LOCALIZED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NetSuite is and shall be a third party beneficiary of, with the power to enforce, these Product Use Terms (including without limitation any disclaimers and limitations of liability) against the End User. No terms or conditions in these Product Use Terms shall limit any remedies available to NetSuite.\n\n(d) Changes to Product Use Terms. These Product Use Terms may be updated at any time by providing an updated copy of the Product Use Terms to End User, which delivery may be by email or through the Web Site. Continued access to and use of the Localized Product and Web Site shall be subject to End User's agreement to any such updated Product Use Terms. If End User does not agree to the updated Product Use Terms, End User shall notify NetSuite KK and shall not access or use the Localized Product or Web Site further. For clarity, while updated Product Use Terms may be posted on the Web Site, any indication of agreement by the End User on the Web Site to such Product Use Terms shall form a contract between End User and NetSuite KK only. No contractual relationship shall be formed between NetSuite and End User, whether or not the terms and conditions purport to be an agreement with NetSuite.\n\n2. Internal Use Only. All access to and use of the Localized Product and Web Site shall be solely for the End User's own internal business operations and not for the benefit or business of any other party. Without limiting the foregoing, End User shall not license, rent, sell, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, display, host, outsource, disclose, link to, mirror, frame, provide a service bureau using, or otherwise commercially exploit or make available to any party (other than End User's authorized employees) the Localized Product, Web Site or output from, or use or benefit of, the Localized Product.\n\n3. Other Use Restrictions. End User (and all users under its account) shall use the Localized Product and Web Site solely in the manner described in the Documentation, as the Documentation is updated from time to time.\n\n(a) End User shall not (and shall not allow any third party to) copy, modify, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, disassemble or decompile the Localized Product, Web Site, or any part thereof, or otherwise attempt to discover or obtain any source code or other code in human perceivable form.\n\n(b) End User shall comply with all applicable local, state, federal, national, international and foreign laws, treaties, regulations, conventions, and standards of each applicable jurisdiction and community in connection with the use of the Localized Product and Web Site, including those related to privacy, electronic communications and anti-spam legislation. Neither the Localized Product nor Web Site shall be accessed or used in a manner that is, or that aids or assists any purpose or activity that is, illegal; invades or infringes the privacy or other rights or expectations of any person; that may be considered offensive, abusive, inappropriate, threatening, harassing, libelous, slanderous, defamatory, intrusive, surreptitious, obscene or inconsistent with community\n\n-2-\n\nstandards; or that may otherwise damage NetSuite KK or its service providers' business, services, reputation, or good will. NetSuite has the right to delete any Customer Data that violates this Section 3(b).\n\n(c) End User shall access and use the Localized Product and Web Site only through the graphical user interfaces that are expressly provided on the Web Site and described in the Documentation.\n\n(d) End User shall not upload, store, post, reproduce, submit, distribute or transmit any information, software or other material or subject matter that is protected by copyright, trade secrets, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right (including rights of publicity and privacy) without first obtaining the authorization of the owner of such rights, including any rights necessary for NetSuite KK and its service providers to provide, and End User to use, the Localized Products and Web Site with respect to such subject matter.\n\n(e) End User shall not indicate or imply that any communications or transmissions using the Localized Products or Web Site are endorsed by NetSuite KK or its service providers.\n\n4. User Names and Passwords. User names and passwords shall be used only for the benefit of End User. Contractors shall not use the Localized Product for their own benefit. End User shall be responsible for all use in violation of these Product Use Terms through its account or using any of its user names and passwords.\n\n5. Related Equipment and Software. End User shall provide and obtain all equipment, software, and accounts, including communications infrastructure, necessary to establish a connection to the Internet, and will further obtain access to the Internet and pay any service fees associated with such access, if any; will agree to use software produced by other third parties, including, but not limited to, \"browser\" software that supports a data security protocol compatible with the protocol used by NetSuite. Unless notified otherwise by NetSuite KK or its service provider, End User agrees to use software that supports the Secure Socket Layer protocol or other protocols accepted by NetSuite and to follow logon procedures for Localized Product that support such protocols.\n\n6. Rights of NetSuite KK and its Providers. End User hereby grants, and shall grant, to NetSuite KK and NetSuite the non-exclusive right and license to copy, record, transmit, maintain, store, display, view, print, adapt, and otherwise use all Customer Data to the extent necessary to provide and operate the Localized Product and Web Site for the benefit of End User (including disclosure and distribution of Customer Data as specified by End User and to NetSuite's contractors and service providers). Without limiting the foregoing, End User agrees that NetSuite, and its contractors and service providers, are authorized to intercept and store communications and transmissions and Customer Data, and that changes to such communications and transmission may occur in order to conform and adapt the Customer Data to the technical requirements of connection networks or devices used in or by the Localized Product or Web Site. NetSuite KK and its services providers do not provide or obtain, or purport to provide or obtain, any such rights.\n\n-3-\n\n7. Localized Product Changes; Discontinuance. NetSuite KK and its service providers have the right, from time to time in their sole discretion, without incurring any liability to End User (except for credits or refunds that NetSuite KK may be required to pay as expressly set forth in these Product Use Terms) to modify the design of, specifications for, or operation of, or suspend or termiante the availability of, the Localized Product and Web Site. Without limiting the foregoing, NetSuite KK and its service providers shall have no obligation to continue the availability of the Localized Product or the Web Site. NETSUITE KK AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH MODIFICATION, SUSPENSION, OR TERMINATION.\n\n8. Ancillary Products and Services. NETSUITE SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OTHER THAN THE LOCALIZED PRODUCT PROVIDED BY NETSUITE AS AN APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDER ON THE WEB SITE.\n\n9. Security. End User understands that all communications, transmissions, and submissions to, through, and from the Localized Product and Web Site are transmitted through networks, equipment and facilities that are not owned or controlled by NetSuite KK and its service providers and that such communications, transmissions, and submissions may be accessed or intercepted by unauthorized parties. NetSuite intends to take such measures as it considers reasonably appropriate for purposes of maintaining the security of only its own facilities used to provide the Localized Products and Web Site. Provided that Netsuite takes such measures, NETSUITE SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSMISSIONS, OR SUBMISSTIONS WHICH ARE ALTERED, INTERCEPTED, ACCESSED OR STORED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OR ANY OTHER BREACHES OF SECURITY. None of NetSuite KK and its services providers shall be required to authenticate the identity of any user. End User shall notify NetSuite KK immediately of any unauthorized use of the Web Site or Localized Product; loss or theft of any user name or password; or any other security failure of which End user is aware.\n\n10. Localized Product Interruptions. The Localized Product (including use of the Web Site) may become unavailable and inaccessible at any time without notice, both for reasons controlled by NetSuite KK and its services providers and for reasons not controlled or determined by NetSuite KK or its service providers. In the event of planned unavailability, NetSuite KK will attempt in good faith to provide End User with at least seven (7) days notice of the unavailability. Planned outages may also be announced by email and on the Web Site. Subject to the foregoing, NETSUITE KK AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY AS A RESULT OF ANY UNAVAILABILITY OF, INACCESSABILITY TO, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE LOCALIZED PRODUCT OR WEB SITE, WHETHER OR NOT THE UNAVAILABILITY, INACCESSIBILITY, OR INABILITY TO USE, IS WITHIN THEIR CONTROL, EXCEPT FOR CREDITS OR REFUNDS PROVIDED BY NETSUITE KK UNDER THESE PRODUCT USE TERMS AND NETSUITE KK SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE PRODUCT USE TERMS.\n\n11. Data. PROVIDED THAT NETSUITE HAS TAKEN REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS TO BACKUP DATA, NETSUITE SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR\n\n-4-\n\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA OR INFORMATION. IF NETSUITE FAILS TO TAKE SUCH PRECAUTIONS, NETSUITE's TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF DATA SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AVERAGE ANNUAL AMOUNTS PAID TO NETSUITE BY NETSUITE KK FOR THE STORAGE OF END USER's DATA USING THE LOCALIZED PRODUCT.\n\n12. Links. The Localized Product may provide, or third parties may provide through the Localized Product, links to other Internet sites or resources. Because NetSuite has no control over such sites and resources, End User acknowledges and agrees that NetSuite shall not be held responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such other sites or resources.\n\n13. Privacy Policy. All access to and use of the Localized Product and Web Site shall be subject to NetSuite's privacy policy posted on its Web Site, as updated by NetSuite from time to time. NetSuite has the right to update its privacy policy without notice by posting an updated privacy policy on its Web Site. End User's continued access and use of the Web Site shall constitute agreement to any updated privacy policy.\n\n14. Intellectual Property.\n\n(a) Suggestions. End User acknowledges that NetSuite does not wish to receive any information or technology related to the Localized Product or the Web Site unless the information and technology can be used in any products and services, in NetSuite's discretion. Accordingly, except as otherwise agreed by NetSuite in writing prior to disclosure of the information or technology to NetSuite, NetSuite has the non-exclusive, perpetual, non-terminable, paid-up, royalty free, worldwide right and license, with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses, to incorporate all such information and technology into products and services and to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, reproduce, distribute, transmit, publicly display and perform, and otherwise exploit such products, services and derivatives thereof.\n\n(b) Trademarks. NetSuite, the NetSuite logo, NetCRM, NetERP, NetFlex, the NetCRM logo, and other NetSuite trademarks, trade names, service marks and logos are marks of NetSuite (the \"NetSuite Marks\"), and End User shall not use or display the NetSuite Marks or any marks or logos confusingly similar thereto.\n\n(c) Proprietary Rights Notices. End User shall not (and shall not allow any third party to) remove, alter or obscure any patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights notices (including restricted rights notices) of NetSuite on the Localized Product or\n\n(c) No Rights or Licenses. No rights or licenses are granted to End User in these Product Use Terms. All rights, title, and interest in and to all technology and intellectual property concerning the Localized Product and the Web Site are and shall be solely owned by NetSuite.\n\n-5-\n\n15. No Warranties. EXCEPT FOR ANY SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS OF NETSUITE KK, ALL LOCALIZED PRODUCTS AND THE WEB SITE ARE PROVIDED \"AS-IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND NETSUITE KK AND NETSUITE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, STATUTORY, IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NETSUITE DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE LOCALIZED PRODUCT, OR THE WEB SITE OR FACILITIES USED TO PROVIDE THE LOCALIZED PRODUCT OR WEB SITE, WILL BE ERROR FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.

NETSUITE SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY SUCH SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION, subject to any refunds or credits that NetSuite KK may be required to pay as set forth in these Product Use Terms.\n\n(d) NetSuite has the right to delete all Customer Data thirty (30) days after any termination or expiration of the End User's account; provided that if End User did not have thirty (30) days notice of the termination or expiration, and if NetSuite has been paid all undisputed amounts due to NetSuite, NetSuite will give End User with access to its account during such thirty (30) day period in accordance with the use terms described above as necessary to provide the End User with an opportunity to retrieve lawful Customer Data.\n\n(e) In the event of any termination or expiration of these Product Use Terms, Sections 1, 7, 8, 9 (the disclaimer of liability only), 10 (last sentence only), 11, 12, 14, 15(c) (last sentence only), 15(d), 15(e), 16, 17 and 18 of these Product Use Terms shall survive.\n\n16.
