If you don't have a service account, you must create a service account. For more information, see Creating a service account.\n\nEnable the following services:\n\nsecretmanager.googleapis.com (Secret Manager API)\n\nconnectors.googleapis.com (Connectors API)\n\nTo understand how to enable services, see Enabling services.\n\nIf these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them when configuring the connector.\n\nConfigure the connector\n\nConfiguring the connector requires you to create a connection to your data source (backend system). A connection is specific to a data source. It means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection for each data source. To create a connection, do the following steps:\n\nIn the Cloud console, go to the Integration Connectors > Connections page and then select or create a Google Cloud project.\n\nGo to the Connections page\n\nClick + Create new to open the Create Connection page.\n\nIn the Location section, choose the location for the connection.\n\nRegion: Select a location from the drop-down list.\n\nSupported regions for connectors include:\n\nFor the list of all the supported regions, see Locations.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIn the Connection Details section, complete the following:\n\nConnector: Select Netsuite from the drop down list of available Connectors.\n\nConnector version: Select the Connector version from the drop down list of available versions.\n\nIn the Connection Name field, enter a name for the Connection instance.\n\nConnection names must meet the following criteria:\n\nConnection names can use letters, numbers, or hyphens.\n\nLetters must be lower-case.\n\nConnection names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.\n\nConnection names cannot exceed 63 characters.\n\nOptionally, enter a Description for the connection instance.\n\nService Account: Select a service account that has the required roles.\n\nOptionally, configure the Connection node settings:\n\nMinimum number of nodes: Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.\n\nMaximum number of nodes: Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.\n\nA node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions. More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely, fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions. To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see Pricing for connection nodes. If you don't enter any values, by default the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.\n\nAccount Id: The company account your username is associated with on NetSuite.\n\nAggregate Column Mode: Indicating how aggregate columns should be treated.\n\nApplication Id: As of version 2020.1, requests to NetSuite require an application ID.\n\nCustom Field Permissions: A comma separated list of custom field permissions. Gives more control than IncludeCustomFieldColumns .\n\nInclude Child Tables: A boolean indicating if child tables should be displayed.\n\nInclude Custom Field Columns: A boolean indicating if you would like to include custom field columns.\n\nInclude Custom List Tables: A boolean indicating if you would like to use tables based on custom lists.\n\nInclude Custom Record Tables: A boolean indicating if you would like to use tables based on custom record types.\n\nInclude Reference Columns: A comma separated list representing the columns to include when retrieving data from a field representing a record reference.\n\nMaximum Concurrent Sessions: The maximum number of concurrent sessions available for use in the connection.\n\nNet Suite Date Format: The preferred date format set in NetSuite UI.\n\nNet Suite Long Date Format: The preferred long date format set in NetSuite UI.\n\nNetsuite Metadata Folder: A path to a directory to download metadata files from NetSuite.

You can select any of the following values:\n\nSuiteTalk - For SOAP based connectivity.\n\nSuiteSQL - For REST based connectivity.\n\nUse Async Services: A boolean indicating if you would like to use asynchronous services when inserting, updating, and deleting.\n\nUse Internal Names For Customizations: A boolean indicating if you would like to use internal names for customizations.\n\nUse Upserts: A boolean indicating if you would like to perform an upsert when an insert operation is used.\n\nUser Timezone Offset: Your user timezone offset as defined in your NetSuite preferences under Home --> Preferences --> Time Zone. Ex: EST.\n\nRow Scan Depth: The number of rows to scan when dynamically determining columns for the table.\n\nUse proxy: Select this checkbox to configure a proxy server for the connection and configure the following values:\n\nProxy Auth Scheme: Select the authentication type to authenticate with the proxy server. The following authentication types are supported:\n\nBasic: Basic HTTP authentication.\n\nDigest: Digest HTTP authentication.\n\nProxy User: A user name to be used to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\nProxy Password: The Secret manager secret of the user's password.\n\nProxy SSL Type: The SSL type to use when connecting to the proxy server. The following authentication types are supported:\n\nAuto: Default setting. If the URL is an HTTPS URL, then the Tunnel option is used. If the URL is an HTTP URL, then the NEVER option is used.\n\nAlways: The connection is always SSL enabled.\n\nNever: The connection is not SSL enabled.\n\nTunnel: The connection is through a tunneling proxy. The proxy server opens a connection to the remote host and traffic flows back and forth through the proxy.\n\nIn the Proxy Server section, enter details of the proxy server.\n\nClick + Add destination.\n\nSelect a Destination Type.\n\nHost address: Specify the hostname or IP address of the destination.\n\nIf you want to establish a private connection to your backend system, do the following:\n\nCreate a PSC service attachment.\n\nCreate an endpoint attachment and then enter the details of the endpoint attachment in the Host address field.\n\nOptionally, click + Add label to add a label to the Connection in the form of a key/value pair.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIn the Destinations section, enter details of the remote host (backend system) you want to connect to.\n\nDestination Type: You can specify the destination details either as a host address or a service attachment. Select any of the following destination types:\n\nHost address: If you want to specify the hostname or IP address of the destination.\n\nService attachment: If you want to specify the private endpoint for your internal IP addresses. The service attachment, lets you hide your internal IP addresses from the external network. You can create a service attachment in Google Cloud, by using the Private Service Connect feature. For information on configuring a Private Service Connect, see Publish managed services.\n\nBased on your selection of destination type, enter the host address or the service attachment name.\n\nTo enter additional destinations, click +Add destination.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIn the Authentication section, enter the authentication details.\n\nSelect an Authentication type and enter the relevant details.\n\nThe following authentication types are supported by the Netsuite connection:\n\nUsername and password\n\nToken Based Authentication\n\nOAuth 2.0 Auth Code Grant\n\nTo understand how to configure these authentication types, see Configure authentication.\n\nClick Next.\n\nReview: Review your connection and authentication details.\n\nClick Create.\n\nConfigure authentication\n\nEnter the details based on the authentication you want to use.\n\nUsername and password\n\nUsername and password authentication. This is valid only for Netsuite version 2020.2 or older.\n\nUsername: Username for connector\n\nPassword: Secret Manager Secret containing the password associated with the connector.\n\nToken Based Authentication\n\nToken Based Authentication for Netsuite. This can be used for both SuiteTalk and SuiteQL schemes.\n\nOAuth Client Id: the Consumer Key displayed when the application was created.\n\nOAuth Client Secret: Secret Manager Secret containing the consumer secret displayed when the application was created.\n\nOAuth Access Token: the Token Id when the access token was created.\n\nOAuth Access Token Secret: Secret Manager Secret containing the token secret when the access token was created.\n\nOAuth 2.0 - Authorization code\n\nAuthorization of connection is done with a web-based user login flow. This is valid only for the SuiteQL scheme.\n\nClient ID: The client ID used for requesting access tokens.\n\nScopes: A comma-separated list of the required scopes.\n\nClient secret: The client secret used for requesting access tokens.\n\nFor the Authorization code authentication type, after creating the connection, you should perform a few additional steps for configuring authentication. For more information, see Additional steps after connection creation.\n\nAdditional steps after connection creation\n\nIf you selected OAuth 2.0 - Authorization code for authentication, you must do the following additional steps after creating the connection:\n\nIn the Connections page, locate the newly created connection.\n\nNotice that the Status for the new connector will be Authorization required.\n\nClick Authorization required.\n\nThis shows the Edit authorization pane.\n\nCopy the Redirect URI value to your external application.\n\nVerify the authorization details.\n\nClick Authorize.\n\nIf the authorization is successful, the connection status will be set to Active in the Connections page.\n\nRe-authorization for Authorization code\n\nIf you are using Authorization code authentication type and have made any cofiguration changes in your backend NetSuite application, you must re-authorize your NetSuite connection. To re-authorize a connection, perform the following steps:\n\nClick on the required connection in the Connections page.\n\nThis opens the connection details page.\n\nClick Edit to edit the connection details.\n\nVerify the OAuth 2.0 - Authorization code details in the Authentication section.\n\nIf required, make the necessary changes.\n\nClick Save. This takes you to the connection details page.\n\nClick Edit authorization in the Authentication section. This shows the Authorize pane.\n\nClick Authorize.\n\nIf the authorization is successful, the connection status will be set to Active in the Connections page.\n\nEntities, operations, and actions\n\nAll the Integration Connectors provide a layer of abstraction for the objects of the connected application. You can access an application's objects only through this abstraction. The abstraction is exposed to you as entities, operations, and actions.\n\nEntity: An entity can be thought of as an object, or a collection of properties, in the connected application or service. The definition of an entity differs from a connector to a connector. For example, in a database connector, tables are the entities, in a file server connector, folders are the entities, and in a messaging system connector, queues are the entities.\n\nHowever, it is possible that a connector doesn't support or have any entities, in which case the Entities list will be empty.\n\nOperation: An operation is the activity that you can perform on an entity. You can perform any of the following operations on an entity:\n\nList\n\nGet\n\nCreate\n\nUpdate\n\nDelete\n\nSelecting an entity from the available list, generates a list of operations available for the entity. For a detailed description of the operations, see the Connectors task's entity operations. However, if a connector doesn't support any of the entity operations, such unsupported operations aren't listed in the Operations list.\n\nAction: An action is a first class function that is made available to the integration through the connector interface. An action lets you make changes to an entity or entities, and vary from connector to connector. Normally, an action will have some input parameters, and an output parameter. However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support any action, in which case the Actions list will be empty.\n\nSystem limitations\n\nThe Netsuite connector can process 1 transaction per second, per node, and throttles any transactions beyond this limit. By default, Integration Connectors allocates 2 nodes (for better availability) for a connection.\n\nFor information on the limits applicable to Integration Connectors, see Limits.\n\nEntity operation examples\n\nThis section shows how to perform some of the entity operations in this connector.\n\nWhen you perform an insert operation in NetSuite, if all the necessary fields and data are not specified, the API to which the entity is aligned rejects the request. This results in an exception. The exception might vary based on the entity used in the insert operation. You must provide the NetSuite line items in the query to successfully insert data. You can specify the line item through the ItemListAggregate field that is available in all parent tables. The following is the format for the ItemListAggregate field:\n\n\"`<ItemList>`\\n\" + \" <Row>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Item_InternalId>656</ItemList_Item_InternalId>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Item_Name>Iphone 15Pro</ItemList_Item_Name>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Line>1</ItemList_Line>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Description>Canon PowerShot Camera Test</ItemList_Description>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Amount>8500.0</ItemList_Amount>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Quantity>17.0</ItemList_Quantity>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Price_InternalId>1</ItemList_Price_InternalId>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Price_Name>List Price</ItemList_Price_Name>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Rate>500.00</ItemList_Rate>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Location_InternalId>1</ItemList_Location_InternalId>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Location_Name>02: NewYork</ItemList_Location_Name>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_TaxCode_InternalId>-7</ItemList_TaxCode_InternalId>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_TaxCode_Name>-Not Taxable-</ItemList_TaxCode_Name>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_ShipGroup>1</ItemList_ShipGroup>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_ItemIsFulfilled>false</ItemList_ItemIsFulfilled>\\n\" + \" <CustomFieldListAggregate>\\n\" + \" <CustomField InternalId=\\\"4779\\\" Type=\\\"platformCore:StringCustomFieldRef\\\" ScriptId=\\\"custcol121\\\">\\n\" + \" <Value>1</Value>\\n\" + \" </CustomField>\\n\" + \" </CustomFieldListAggregate>\\n\" + \" </Row>\\n\" + \" <Row>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Item_InternalId>656</ItemList_Item_InternalId>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Item_Name>Iphone 15Pro</ItemList_Item_Name>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Line>4</ItemList_Line>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Description>Canon PowerShot Camera Test</ItemList_Description>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Amount>8500.0</ItemList_Amount>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Quantity>17.0</ItemList_Quantity>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Price_InternalId>1</ItemList_Price_InternalId>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Price_Name>List Price</ItemList_Price_Name>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Rate>500.00</ItemList_Rate>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Location_InternalId>2</ItemList_Location_InternalId>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_Location_Name>01: California</ItemList_Location_Name>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_TaxCode_InternalId>-7</ItemList_TaxCode_InternalId>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_TaxCode_Name>-Not Taxable-</ItemList_TaxCode_Name>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_ShipGroup>1</ItemList_ShipGroup>\\n\" + \" <ItemList_ItemIsFulfilled>false</ItemList_ItemIsFulfilled>\\n\" + \" <CustomFieldListAggregate>\\n\" + \" <CustomField InternalId=\\\"4776\\\" Type=\\\"platformCore:StringCustomFieldRef\\\" ScriptId=\\\"custcol121\\\">\\n\" + \" <Value>4</Value>\\n\" + \" </CustomField>\\n\" + \" </CustomFieldListAggregate>\\n\" + \" </Row>\\n\" + \"`</ItemList>`;\"\n\nExample - List all the credit memos\n\nThis example lists all the credit memos in the CreditMemo entity.\n\nIn the Configure connector task dialog, click Entities.\n\nSelect CreditMemo from the Entity list.\n\nSelect the List operation, and then click Done.\n\nOptionally, in Task Input section of the Connectors task, you can filter your result set by specifying a filter clause.
