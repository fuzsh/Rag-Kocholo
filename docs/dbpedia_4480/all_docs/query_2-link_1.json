        "text": "NetSuite is the world's leading integrated cloud business software suite, providing a complete enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution for businesses of all sizes. This all-in-one business management platform helps organizations streamline processes, gain real-time visibility, and make data-driven decisions. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore what makes NetSuite the go-to ERP software and why it could be the key to unlocking your business's full potential.\n\nWhat is NetSuite ERP?\n\nNetSuite ERP is an all-in-one cloud business management solution that helps organizations manage their financials, operations, and customer relationships in a single, integrated system. By consolidating key business processes into one platform, NetSuite eliminates data silos and provides real-time visibility across the entire organization.\n\nThe NetSuite ERP system manages core business processes, including accounting, inventory management, order management, and customer relationship management (CRM). With NetSuite, businesses can access their ERP system from anywhere, at any time, using any device with an internet connection.\n\nA Brief History of Oracle NetSuite\n\nNetLedger, the original name for NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg, which at the time offered web-hosted accounting management software. It’s widely recognized in the industry that NetSuite was the very first cloud computing software company, even pre-dating Salesforce.com by about one month.\n\nFast forward to July 2002, Zach Nelson joined NetSuite to become the CEO and lead the company from around $1 million an annual revenues to a billion-dollar run rate right up until the acquisition by Oracle in July 2016.\n\nBoth Evan Goldberg and Zach Nelson had previously worked for Larry Ellison (Oracle co-founder and CTO), prior to forming and leading NetSuite. In fact, Larry Ellison was one of the original main investors in NetSuite to the tune of $125 million back in 1998.\n\nSince the Oracle acquisition in July of 2016, NetSuite has intentionally continued to operate as a separate Global Business Unit (GBU) with the majority of the original management team intact.\n\nHow NetSuite Got Here\n\nNetSuite’s core product offering has primarily been the result of organic growth. However, there has been quite a few notable acquisitions over the last 10 years in ecommerce, retail, manufacturing, and professional service automation.\n\nNetSuite's Notable Acquisitions\n\n2008: OpenAir – Professional Service Automation (PSA)\n\n2009: QuickArrow – Professional Service Automation (PSA)\n\n2013: Retail Anywhere – Point of Sale (POS)\n\n2013: TribeHR – Human Capital Management (HCM)\n\n2013: LightCMS – Content Management Software (CMS)\n\n2014: Venda – Ecommerce Software\n\n2014: eBizNET solutions – Advanced Warehouse Management\n\n2015: Bronto Software – Marketing Automation Software\n\n2015: Monexa – Subscription Billing Software\n\nHow Does NetSuite Software Work?\n\nNetSuite is a cloud-based software solution, which means that all data and software applications are hosted on remote servers (in Oracle data centers) and accessed via the internet. This eliminates the need for businesses to install and maintain the software and its back-end infrastructure, reducing IT costs and complexity.\n\nUsers can access the NetSuite ERP system through a web browser or mobile app, allowing them to work from anywhere with an internet connection. NetSuite also integrates with other business software applications, such as e-commerce platforms and marketing automation tools, creating a seamless end-to-end solution.\n\nWhat Are the Key Features of NetSuite?\n\nNetSuite offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to streamline business processes and drive growth.
