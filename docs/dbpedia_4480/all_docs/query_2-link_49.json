NetSuite Add-on Modules\n\nNetSuite modules are functions or industry-specific business process configurations. These add-on modules can be licensed through ala carte (pick and choose) or through industry-based bundles (e.g. NetSuite for Manufacturing, NetSuite for Retail, NetSuite for SaaS, NetSuite for Wholesale Distribution, etc.).\n\nThe NetSuite module pricing varies depending on your NetSuite license’s edition.\n\nHere’s a full list of NetSuite modules:\n\nA. NetSuite Customer Relationship Management Module\n\nNetSuite CRM\n\nNetSuite Contract Renewals\n\nNetSuite Incentive Compensation\n\nB. NetSuite Financial Management Modules\n\nNetSuite Advanced Financials\n\nNetSuite SuiteBilling\n\nNetSuite Revenue Management\n\nNetSuite Planning & Budgeting\n\nNetSuite Multi-Book Accounting\n\nNetSuite OneWorld\n\nNetSuite Dunning Letters\n\nNetSuite Fixed Assets Management\n\nNetSuite Electronic Bank Payments\n\nNetSuite Professional Services Automation Modules\n\nNetSuite SuiteProjects\n\nNetSuite Project Management\n\nNetSuite OpenAir\n\nNetSuite Commerce Modules\n\nNetSuite SuiteCommerce\n\nNetSuite SuiteCommerce Advanced\n\nNetSuite SuiteCommerce InStore\n\nNetSuite SuiteCommerce MyAccount\n\nNetSuite Connector\n\nNetSuite Supply Chain Modules\n\nNetSuite Procurement\n\nNetSuite Warehouse Management System (WMS)\n\nNetSuite Demand Planning\n\nNetSuite Quality Management\n\nNetSuite Work in Process (WIP) and Routings\n\nNetSuite Work Orders and Assemblies\n\nNetSuite Advanced Manufacturing\n\nNetSuite Inventory and Order Management Modules\n\nNetSuite Advanced Inventory Management\n\nNetSuite Advanced Order Management\n\nGrid Order Management\n\nNetSuite Human Resources Modules\n\nNetSuite Payroll\n\nNetSuite SuitePeople HR\n\nNetSuite SuitePeople Performance Management\n\nLearn more about NetSuite modules\n\nIII. Professional Services Costs\n\nThe cost of your NetSuite implementation will be based on the number of modules you need to implement, the level of customization required, and the amount of data that needs to be migrated or processed.\n\nA. Discovery: Requirement Analysis and Advisory Cost (Optional)\n\nWhen you are implementing NetSuite, you may also need to consider the cost of discovery and analysis services. This is a cost-effective way to get started with NetSuite and determine if it is the right solution for your business. With discovery and analysis services, you can:\n\nGet a detailed overview of how NetSuite can be configured to meet your specific business needs\n\nDetermine the level of customization and integration required\n\nEstimate the effort required for data migration\n\nAssess the training needs of your team\n\nDevelop a roadmap for implementation\n\nThe cost of discovery and analysis services will vary depending on the size and complexity of your business.\n\nIt takes a week or two to conduct a thorough evaluation of your business requirements and specifications to determine if NetSuite is the best fit solution for supporting and addressing the gaps in your organization.\n\nB. Professional Services Cost of Implementation\n\nThere are two approaches to NetSuite implementation:\n\nThe traditional Full-fledged Implementation through a service provider; and\n\nThe Guided Implementation, where your team performs the implementation while a NetSuite expert provides the installation roadmap.\n\nThe traditional full-fledged Implementation is best suited for businesses with more complicated requirements. This lasts around four and a half months, with the NetSuite expert in charge of all necessary activities from system setup to user training and testing, as well as past data migration.\n\nA guided implementation is for companies with simpler business requirements and a limited budget. This is held through a fixed engagement for 3 months with a fixed 160 hours of guidance/ consultation.\n\nC. Professional Services Cost of Customization including Data Migration\n\nIn most cases, clients don’t get everything they desire out of the box. This is because companies have unique customer requirements and business processes that’s why it is better to have NetSuite customized. Customization costs depend on the complexity of the required functionality and labor hours for coding, testing, and deployment. Rates can go up to $200 per hour for both midsized practice consultants and established NetSuite services providers.\n\nThe cost of data migration varies depending on the complexity, volume, and quality of data. The types of data being migrated, such as financials, customer relationships, inventory, and order histories can vary greatly in complexity. Complex data structures require more work to migrate accurately. On the other hand, the amount of data to be transferred directly influences the duration and intensity of the migration process. Larger volumes of data take more time and resources to migrate. Moreover, the condition of the existing data affects migration costs. Clean, well-maintained data is faster and easier to transfer compared to data that requires significant cleansing or deduplication.\n\nThis cost is usually listed under the customization and integration costing tables. The professional services fee for data migration ranges from $2,500 – $10,000 for small to midsize businesses, up to $50,000 or more for larger enterprises.\n\nD. Professional Services Cost of Integration\n\nSome businesses want NetSuite to connect/communicate with other systems operated by its clients and suppliers after it’s installed. NetSuite will have to be linked with its 3PL/Third Party Logistics partner for the fulfillment and delivery of various sales orders, as an example. The cost of integration depends on the complexity of the required functionality and labor hours required for the integration coding, testing, and deployment. The rates can go up to $200 for both midsized practice consultants and bigger/ global tech companies.\n\nE. Internal Staff Hours Cost\n\nAnother factor is the cost of your internal resources (accounting and finance team) involvement throughout the different phases of the project from the start until completion.\n\nF. Post Go-Live Support Cost\n\nAs your company adapts to and gets used to using NetSuite for your finance, accounting, and other operational activities, your team will need support in addressing errors or sudden interruptions. However, the support requirements will then be relatively low compared with implementation. More hours are expected to be spent for support for the first 6-12 months after implementation or post-go-live.\n\nCheck our NetSuite: Total Cost of Ownership blog for a more detailed discussion about NetSuite’s TCO or Total Cost of Ownership.\n\nG. Training Cost\n\nThis will ensure that your staff are equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to use NetSuite effectively. Excelym’s strategy is to focus on improving the expertise of your frontline or key team members. As their expertise grows, they can assist in configuring and designing solutions, train fellow users, and champion NetSuite within your company. We view training as a mutual learning experience. Through our collaboration, we gain insights from your business operations and processes, enabling us to customize a set of functions or features that align perfectly with your requirements.\n\nIV. How to buy a NetSuite License\n\nA. Create your package\n\nA consultant will help you identify the suitable NetSuite product according to your business requirements. This includes the product edition, the necessary advanced add-on modules, and the number of named users.\n\nB. Set your contract length\n\nNetSuite’s starting/minimum subscription plan is only one year but is typically bought, as popularly considered ideal for most companies, at a five-year license plan. This is because discounts increase and financing options become available the longer the contract duration.\n\nC. Sign your service license agreement and complete your payment\n\nHaving agreed on the cost estimate for your initial NetSuite product package and contract length, the next step is to sign your service license agreement. Soon after signing your service license agreement, your NetSuite account will be provisioned and thus commences the process for the implementation.\n\nD. Be ready to implement\n\nThe last, and considerably, the most critical stage is to implement NetSuite and there are many ways to do it. You can choose to have a full-service NetSuite implementation, either directly through Oracle NetSuite or from a third-party vendor or NetSuite Solutions Provider, or do Self-Implementation and be assisted by a NetSuite advisor/ implementor. Most go for a NetSuite Solutions Provider, like Excelym, as it offers better project management and other value-added services.\n\nE. Take advantage of financing options"
