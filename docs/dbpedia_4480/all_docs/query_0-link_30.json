Developers and analysts said the new environment — known by the code name Boston — could save a huge amount of ap- plication development time. It also could reduce the level of language training developers must undergo and increase component reuse in corporate applications. Today, developers often use three or more languages and tools, each with its own environ- ment, to build a single complex application. That means a developer must know several languages or work within a team. Microsoft is expected to un- veil the environment at its De- veloper Days conference March 19. according to several sources close to the company. Microsoft declined to comment further. But developers had plenty to say. \"It would be awesome.

Just when you thought it was safe to start pounding that keyboard, repetitive stress injury (RSI) has bared its teeth again. This time IS folks should pay attention. A federal jury in Brooklyn, N.Y., last week awarded damages — $5.3 million against Digital — to a user who suf- fered carpal tunnel syndrome allegedly from using a keyboard. Granted, another RSI case against IBM went the opposite way the very same week (see story, page 4), but the prece- dent of that substantial damages award is chilling for the computer industry. Until now, RSI claims have failed to ex- act a penny of court-ordered damages, despite more than a decade of debate. IS professionals should worry about this because RSI is a serious issue. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says 41,000 people lost work time as a result of carpal tunnel syndrome in 1993, the most recent year for which there are records. That's a small fraction of the people who would probably claim RSI if T , . . they could win damages. The pain is so Two members of Computerworld's . . 70-person editorial staff have lost aQOniZing ttiat they work time in the past year as a result of RSI. I know of two other computer WOLlldn t Want tO type journalists who have similar prob- lems. One loses a month out of near- ly every year to undergo surgery just so he can keep working. Those who don't suffer from RSI may dismiss those who do as whiners. But talk to a carpal tunnel syndrome victim, and you will hear a different story. Their fingers sometimes curl so badly as to render typing impossible. And even if they could type, the pain is so agonizing and unrelenting that they wouldn't want to. Such people are good candidates to sue any- one who can be deemed responsible for their condition, in- cluding their employers. So take RSI seriously. Warning labels, a half-day class, may- be a few hundred dollars' worth of equipment for high-risk em- ployees is a pittance compared with your legal exposure. If em- ployees develop these injuries, it shouldn't be because you failed to do your job. Paul CIIHn, Editor Internet: paui gillm@cw.com FIFTH WAVE BY RICH T L N N A N T Outlook bleak for NASA's Macs as safety concerns are rejected By Lisa Picarillc ' ISW'T \"WAT OUR WS> rWSTER? TW££ PEOPLE MMS FIND A CREATIVE WAY TO INTERFACE:' MACINTOSH users at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC), who have been on a yearlong mission to save their Macintosh- es from being jettisoned, may soon be launching Windows 95 from their desktops. After a monthlong investiga- tion. NASA's Office of Space Flight Safely and Mission As- sessment last week rejected ar- guments from users of Apple Computer. I lie 's Macintosh thai switching to PCs would compro- mise flight safety. COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS NASA Deputy Chief Informa- tion Officer Don Andreotta said the ruling opens the door for |SC to purchase additional PCs — provided that they comply willi current regulations and that necessary cost/benefit anal- yses are performed. )SC already lias more than 7,500 PCs. But Carl Franklin )r.. a NASA contractor, said he disagrees with the ruling and claims there are still potential safety prob- lems associated with forcing us- ers off the Macintoshes. \"Curve-fitting an orbit is not the same as getting your [elec- tronic mail]. Taking people thai deal with trajectories and forc- ing them to use the same com- puters that are used by the ad- ministrative staff is ridiculous. If we screw up. someone could die,\" Franklin said. Macintosh users also argue that space flight safety would he compromised because several Macintosh-only databases, in- cluding one containing 10 mil- lion records on the histories of space shuttle parts, won't run on the PC. These databases are key if there are malfunctions. However, there are still some issues to be resolved before JSC CIO |ohn Carman can proceed with the move lo Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95. JSC's Mac- intosh users won a small victory last month when the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) re- leased a report charging that Carman's move to use Windows 95 as the standard desktop plat- form wasn't cost-effective and didn't take users' requirements into consideration |CW, Nov. 18]. The OIG report also added that \"prudent technical and management judgment was not exer- cised.\" In addition, the OIG deter- mined that Carman's de- cision to move to a single platform was out of line with NASA's information technology policies that support the use of both Macintoshes and PCs. \"Basically.we endorse heterogeneous environment policies,\" Andreotta said. However, the OIG has 110 en- forcement authority, and Macin- losh users will have lo wait until this week for NASA CIO Ron West's plan of action, which ad- dresses the four recommenda- tions outlined in last month's OIG report. A follow-up report is due March 7. 1997. PCs TAKE OFF Hardware at NASA's 13 facilities Macintoshes 25,000 Unix servers 10,000 II West determines that Gar- man's decision to move to a sin- gle Wintel platform didn't in- clude all necessary cost/benefit analyses. Macintosh users would be safe for a while. However, one NASA watcher claimed that ifJSC officials want to move to Windows, they can make it happen, in spite of the user uprising. \"Politics inside of NASA are vastly more fierce llian outside Space shuttle launch Political battles within NASA may determine the future of the space agency's computing of NASA.\" said Keith Cowing, president of Reston Communi- cations, which publishes \"NASA RIF Watch.\" an online newsletter in Reston. Va. \"Civil servants can use passive resis- tance. But this issue conies down to being personality- driven, and if someone [in charge) wants to make it hap- pen, it will.\" Some JSC insiders, who asked not to be named, allege that in some cases, require- ments are being rewritten as \"desiremenls\" to enable prod- ucts that don't fulfill require- ments to still be purchased. SHORTSIGHTED Franklin claims JSC is being shortsighted by f actoring in only lowest purchase price. \"They are picking less- efficient tools, so users are caught in a box here. They want users to work faster, better, cheaper but they are giving them worse tools. I'm a taxpay- er, so I have no problems with a PC if it will save money. They may be saving money on the ac- tual acquisition of PCs, but over time the support and mainte- nance costs are higher,\" Frank- lin said. Come visit our Web site ^Computerworld •COOL STUFF.

Eric Kimminau, an engineer at a Silicon Valley computer manu- facturing firm, said he couldn't send electronic mail to any- one he knew who uses America Online, Inc. He suspects, from the infor- mation included in his returned messages, that he was a victim of an America Online filter set up to prevent so-called spam- mers, people who blanket users with unsolicited junk messages. Kimminau isn't alone. Many business and home users be- lieve their mail is being unjustly blocked by online service filters, based on the inappropriate be- havior of a few. In the meantime, the spam- ming problem is nowhere near solved. \"A lot of nonspammers, in- cluding me, have been blocked by individuals because of the reputation [of an Internet ser- vice provider],\" said Catherine Hampton, webmaster at Varian Associates, a medical equip- ment manufacturer in Palo Alto, Calif. Hampton said her E-mail has been blocked by users who con- sider her Internet service pro- vider, Best.com, to be a com- pany that tolerates spamming. Kimminau, whose service provider is Coast to Coast Telecommunications, said he has since tried to figure out what happened, writing many E-mails to America Online that were answered with form letters. \"I'm definitely not a spam- mer,\" Kimminau said. \"I know what spamming is, and I know the kinds of problems it causes for [Internet service providers] and AOL and CompuServe. ... I would just like to know it's not MAKING THE BLOCK America Online offers two tools with the following fuctions to block out junk mail | Lets members create lists of sites from which they don't want mail □ Enables users to receive E-mail only from those on a specified list; all others will be blocked going to happen again.\" An America Online spokes- man didn't address Kimminau's case but said those accused of sending mass unsolicited mail always receive an E-mail warn- ing from the company. To combat the problem, America Online recently began to offer PreferredMail, a service that lets customers selectively filter E-mail by using a list of accused spammers. \"We're being very careful about [whom is placed on the list],\" said Andrew Craziani, a spokesman at America Online in Dulles, Va. \"We're basing this on member complaints.\" There are two ways to prevent junk E-mail delivery. Mail from certain sites or individuals can be filtered by the client, or America Online can filter mail from suspected spammers at the source. Although there's a chance that some customers are filtered unjustly, there are usually two sides to a spamming story, said Bob Metcalfe, vice president of technology at International Data Group, Inc. But tackling the spam prob- lem with filters alone isn't the answer, he said. \"Postage for ev- ery E-mail sent would solve the problem.\" he said. \"One of the problems with things being free is it's grossly overused.\" Hampton said it would be a better idea to charge a quarter per unsolicited E-mail and not penalize legitimate users. An informal online group that Hampton runs from her World Wide Web site discusses how to curb illegitimate com- mercial use of the Internet with- out limiting freedom. \"AOL is not the problem. They're one large company deal- ing with a humongous prob- lem,\" Hampton said. Trade pact could boost computer sales By Patrick Thibodeau COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP. pays more than $100 million in worldwide tariffs each year. Digital Equipment Corp. paid more than $30 million in tariffs last year. But both companies, along with thousands of other U.S. in- formation technology firms, should eventually be free of cus- toms tariffs. That's because the International Trade Agreement (ITA) was approved Friday. Twenty-eight countries have signed it. and six others have pledged to do so. Ending tariffs on high-tech- nology and telecommunications products will reduce equipment prices in overseas markets and spur sales, several computer in- dustry representatives said. The agreement \"translates in- to making it easier for custom- ers to buy our products,\" said Thomas Ehrgood, international trade counsel at Digital. The U.S., the European Un- ion, Canada. Japan and most of the members of the Asian-Pacif- ic Economic Cooperation forum support the agreement. The American Electronics Association (AEA) says the U.S. exports about $80 billion in IT products to countries covered by the agreement. Foreign cus- tomers paid about $5 billion in tariffs. \"All this is good news in terms of additional jobs,\" said George Sollman, head of the AEA and chairman and CEO of Centigram Communications Corp. in San Jose, Calif. Soli- man's company, which makes communications servers and applications, will benefit from the treaty, he said, although the effects will be gradual. The agreement will phase out tariffs in four steps between July 1, 1997, and Jan. 1, 2000, in al- most every high-tech area: com- puters, printers, fax machines, most electronic office equip- ment, semiconductors, soft- ware, telecommunications and hundreds of other products. The agreement may keep manufacturers from locating plants in countries with high tariffs to escape those export costs. \"It'll enable companies to manufacture more from where they are located because the trade barriers abroad will be lower,\" said Robbins Pancake, international trade manager at Hewlett-Packard Co. About two years ago, joe Love's job was outsourced. And he couldn't be happier. \"I get the feeling . . . that I am contributing to the bottom line of my company,\" says Love, a Dallas-area information systems pro- fessional who now works at an outsourcing firm. \"I've gone from being part of a cost center to someone who actually generates revenue.\" Like many outsourced IS professionals who continue to do the same work at their former employer, Love was suspicious at first and anxious about the motives of his new employer. But he and oth- ers have found that outsourced IS professionals can have more fun. For more, turn to Managing, page 95. Tools ease NetWare tasks By Patrick Dryden netware server administra- tors can get help automating most file-system management chores across tens or hundreds of systems when two vendors update their tools this week. Version 2.0 releases of Task- Master from Avanti Technology, Inc. in Austin, Texas, and Snap- In AutoAttendant NETWORK MtNtfiFMENT from Snap-In Softools, Inc. in Tucson, Ariz., boost their ability to schedule and execute the con- sole commands required to maintain servers that run No- vell, Inc. NetWare 3.x and 4.x. That frees administrators from having to manually manage files, accounts and NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) pro- grams on individual servers. \"Great. We're trying to find tools to help us do more with fewer people,\" said Johnny Oli- vas, a network administrator at the information technology cen- ter of Phillips Petroleum Co. in Houston. Avanti's TaskMaster can do the following: ■ Examine, prune, back up and distribute files. ■ Unload NLMs to free memory and reload them when needed. ■ Close files, clear idle connec- tions and shut down processes to enable complete backups. ■ Do database maintenance dur- ing off-hours. It costs S450 per server. Snap-In's AutoAttendant inte- grates with Novell's NWAdmin tool to do the following: ■Copy, update and distribute files. ■ Designate one server as a reference for replication to the others. ■ Compare source and target files before completing an update. ■ Synchronize tasks among servers and track schedules to verify task completion or find problems. AutoAttendant 2.0 costs from $99 for one server to $20 per server in a 500-server license.

Stock Ticker -'3» 100 Conflicting rulings on carpal tunnel By Mindy Blodgett and Robert Scheier two recent legal decisions re- flect the continuing confusion over workplace ergonomics, re- petitive stress injuries and who is ultimately responsible. In a first-of-its-kind decision, a federal jury in New York last week ordered Digital Equip- ment Corp. in Maynard, Mass., to pay $5.3 million to a former executive secretary who claimed she developed serious carpal tunnel syndrome while using a Digital keyboard. Yet just a couple of days later, IBM won a similar case filed by a 911 operator who suffered hand and wrist injuries after us- ing the company's keyboards. The 911 operator sued IBM for $11 million in damages for allegedly failing to warn users of the injury potential, but the New York State Supreme Court ruled against the operator. APPEAL PLANNED Digital officials said the compa- ny plans to appeal the decision, while IBM hailed the judgment in its case. There is currently no scientif- ic evidence that links keyboards to repetitive stress injuries. But users said regardless of who is at fault, they hope vendors will work harder to introduce better designs. \"I think the vendors should definitely be doing more in this area,\" said Ron Hawkins, direc- tor of information technology at \"Sometimes I wonder if . . . repetitive stress injuries are the asbestos workplace controversy of the Information Age.\" - Ron Hawkins, Millipore Millipore Corp. in Bedford, Mass. \"More and more, as we find ourselves glued to an infor- mation appliance, repetitive stress injuries are an issue.\" Hawkins said he wants to see keyboards made more sensitive to touch and computers with more sophisticated voice recog- nition. But he acknowledged the confusion about the issue. \"Sometimes I wonder if peo- ple are just moaning about stuff or if repetitive stress injuries are the asbestos workplace contro- versy of the Information Age,\" Hawkins said. In the absence of vendor ac- tion, users are seeking their own remedies. \"A lot of our initiatives have revolved around eliminating consistent keyboard use.\" said Frank Armijo, manager of business development at Lock- heed Martin Services Co. in Richland, Wash. \"We are very heavily safety conscious, so it's something our safety man- ager has been talking about for several years.\" Lockheed's Frank Armijo: The company has worked to- ward eliminating consistent keyboard use For example. Lockheed re- placed a word processing group that spent all day keying in time cards, he said. In its place, the company has an automated time information system in which workers input their own time card information. In the IBM case, the finding in the company's favor \"sup- ports our position that there is no causal link between keyboard use and repetitive stress,\" said Fred McNeese, an IBM spokesman. He said that al- though IBM \"follows the scientific studies\" on ergonomics, it doesn't plan to start issuing warnings with its keyboards, as Compaq Computer Corp. does. Marvin Dainoff. a professor of ergonomics and a consultant at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, said he hopes the Digital judgment would prompt ven- dors to focus on the issue and fuel further research into ergo- nomics. \"While science hasn't proved a link between keyboards and carpal tunnel syndrome yet, sci- ence hasn't disproved it either,\" Dainoff said.

Information systems staffers at nonprofit organizations aren't only planning larger and more wide-ranging projects, but they are also working with limited Profitable tips Nonprofit IS managers have the following re- sponsibilities on top of their typical IS duties: -»Know everything about their organizations' goals and be able to communicate that to outside groups. -»Have a clear technology plan and detail what each new com- puter system will do for the staff because the nonprofit of- ten depends on donations. ->Plan far in advance because they can't count on delivery of donated systems on a timely basis. ■» Learn to integrate all sorts of systems they receive as donations. budget and resources. For example, the Atlanta chapter of the American Red Cross has created a data ware- house that runs on a RISC- based AS/400 system. The data- base helped the chapter reduce administrative costs from 24% to 9% of its budget and gives the Red Cross information that lets them contact the right people at the right time when disaster strikes. \"All disasters are run on com- puter now,\" said Dee Kellogg, chief information officer at the Atlanta chapter. Groups such as the Red Cross use computers out of necessity because nonprofits deal with funding cutbacks, diminishing government support and more competition for donations than ever. And publicity about fund- raising scams makes charities rely on computer technology so they can document how they spend money, according to offi- cials at the National Charities Information Bureau. But the skills IS must use to make technology dreams a reali- ty at nonprofits could transfer well to the business world (see chart). \"We have to be able to talk about what our mission is and how the donated item will help us provide better service,\" Kel- logg said. \"I believe so much in the Red Cross. My passion comes through.\" IS dedication is key. \"The drive to deliver on the promise of technology takes on heightened importance for us,\" said Doug Barker, CIO at the Nature Conservancy in Arling- ton, Va. \"If we give our users better ways to pull in all sorts of information and link the data to [geographic information sys- tem] tools, it really matters.\" Barker has begun a drive to work with technology firms to get the best products available. He says one advantage for the Nature Conservancy is that high-tech companies often sup- port conservation issues. For example, Microsoft Corp. is donating its Office productivi- ty suite to Nature Conservancy offices nationwide. CREATIVE SOLUTIONS Another way to get help is to work out a creative donation deal. Barker worked out an agree- ment with Learning Tree Inter- national, Inc. so Nature Conser- vancy workers receive donated training on a space available basis. Thus the group gets much-needed training while fill- ing up Learning Tree's classes. Training is a huge focus for inq edqe just because it will take me that much lonqer to qet it done as a nonprofit. nonprofit groups because users are often uncomfortable with using computers. For example, Kellogg made sure PCs were installed at Red Cross offices to give users a more intuitive way to access and enter data in to the AS/400, without having to navigate end- less text-based menus. Major plans, such as the Na- ture Conservancy's computer technology push or the National Easter Seals Society's linking of its nearly 500 World Wide Web pages, can often take a long time to implement because of the de- lays in looking for equipment donations. As a result, these groups may find themselves getting a very - dee kellogg, can red c ross, HTtlanta early start with new technol- ogies. \"Now that Web technology is affordable, we are like kids in a candy store,\" said Roger Well- man, CIO at Easter Seals in San Jose, Calif. Examples include B'nai B'rith International in Washington, which used a neural network to improve its donation renewal rate; and Easter Seals, which is testing hardware that lets para- plegic and quadriplegic users control a computer with little or no body movement. \"Sometimes I will jump out on the bleeding edge just be- cause it will take me that much longer to get it done as a non- profit,\" Kellogg said.

Cop Oracle7 Parallel Server: Almost 3 Times Faster than IBM DB2/Parallel Edition The TPC-D is the industry standard benchmark for measuring query performance on large complex databases. On the fastest hardware that IBM makes, the RS/6000 SP, running against an identical 300 GB data warehouse, Oracle7 Parallel Server's TPC-D performance was almost twice as fast with almost three times the throughput as IBM's own DB2/Parallel Edition. What's even more amazing, Oracle delivered this performance at nearly one-third the price.

Last February, Kmart Corp. was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, placing strategic technology projects on hold and watching helplessly as valuable information systems executives bolted for the exits [CW, Feb. 5]. Since then, new management has helped the discount retailer turn two consecutive profitable quarters by selling $1 billion in equity and cutting costs. And in response to lagging sales, the Troy, Mich.-based company's IS group is spear- heading several ambitious tech- nology projects to improve the merchandising mix, draw more customers and pump up reve- nue (see chart). Leading the charge is Donald E. Norman, a 28-year retail sys- tems veteran who was hired last December. He became se- nior vice president and chief in- formation officer when CIO Virginia Rago left a year ago. Stocking up Kmart this year has launched a series of information technology projects designed to help the dis- count retailer cut costs, improve its product mix and draw custom- ers to its stores. They include the following: -» Implemented an in-house- developed retail stock ledger that is expected to help Kmart more effectively calculate gross profits and other ac- counting functions. The three- tiered client/server system will be implemented at the end of January. -♦Upgraded to its IBM Inventory Forecasting and Replenishment Modules system and tweaked the system to shorten its re- plenishment cycle by a full day. There are plans to shorten re- plenishment to 24 to AS hours by the middle of next year. -♦Rolled out a client/server allo- cation system in October that was designed to place the right inventory in the right stores. Available for hard-line items now and soft goods in February. Norman has assembled an all-star team of industry execu- tives such as Judith Rusch, the former director of IS at The Dis- ney Store; David Guzman, for- mer chief technology officer at Federated Department Stores, Inc.; and Mike Blair, former vice president of operations at Feder- ated's Sabre Group. Thanks to a three-tiered client/server allocation system it introduced in October in time for the holiday sales crunch, Kmart's buyers can identify and distribute the right merchandise mix more effectively to its 2,161 stores. \"Clearly, if you've got the product in stock, then you can help the customer come back,\" Norman said. FAST MERCHANDISE Kmart has also improved the speed and accuracy of its inven- tory management systems. Nor- man said some of Kmart's mer- chandise can now be replaced in 18 to 20 hours, compared with the 36 to 48 hours it used to take. In June, Kmart began replac- ing all of its IBM Cobol and CICS-based financial systems with a suite of client/server sys- tems from Walker Interactive Systems in San Francisco. The new systems, which are being installed on a mix of I BM main- frames and Microsoft Corp. Windows NT systems, are ex- pected to help Kmart close its books just two to four days after the end of each quarter. Norman declined to say how long it now takes the company to close its books. Kmart has no plans to mi- grate its Kmart Information Network II systems in its stores from Unix to Windows NT be- cause the Unix systems \"still have plenty of horsepower left in them,\" Norman said. Kmart has managed to launch all these IS projects after \"beau- coup\" dollars were slashed from its 1996 IS budget, he said. \"We have cut $500 million out of our expense overhead at Kmart, and a good chunk of that came from IS,\" Norman said. Analysts esti- mate Kmart's 1996 IS budget is $375 million. Analysts say Kmart is on the right track but still has some distance to close between itself, with 1995 revenue of S34.4 bit- lion, and $100 billion Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Kmart's merchan- dise mix \"is much better, due to improved merchandising sys- tems,\" said Robert Berger, prin- cipal at Berger Advanced Man- agement Services, a Hillsboro, Calif-based retail management consultant. But Wal-Mart \"is on the fore- front of inventory management and supplier relations. They're In his first year as Kmart CIO, Donald E. Norman has assembled an all-star team of industry executives and initiated projects aimed at improving the retailer's merchandising mix and boosting revenue fort was designed to improve forecasting by sharing customer and product information be- tween suppliers and retailers over the Internet. Wal-Mart \"is very serious about this in- vestment, and that sends a mes- sage to the rest of the industry,\" Stiely said. Norman, for one, is listening. \"We're not where we want to be. but we're succeeding,\" he said. very good at opening their ven- dors to make the whole supply chain more efficient,\" said Jeff Stiely, an analyst at Kurt Salmon Associates, an Atlanta-based re- tail and consumer products con- sultancy. Stiely pointed to Wal-Mart's yearlong Collaborative Forecast- ing and Replenishment pilot with Warner-Lambert Co. and several technology firms. The ef- MCI offers faster frame relay By Kim Girard MCI COMMUNICATIONS Corp. is boosting its frame-relay speeds and offering a managed frame-relay access device (FRAD) to help IBM SNA users track their service. High-speed frame-relay that ranges from 3M to 12M bit/sec. is available from MCI's 500 net- work-access points nationwide, MCI announced last week. Those speeds will provide an alternative to Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) for net- work managers seeking higher bandwidth to high-traffic sites. Pricing ranges from $2,268 per month for a 3.072M bit/sec. port speed to $5,268 for a 12.289M bit/sec. port speed. Access to the service is pro- vided by the local telephone company, which uses inverse multiplexing of multiple Ti cir- cuits to provide one circuit that can offer up to 12M bit/sec. speeds. Although 70% to 75% of all circuits to remote sites are 56K to 64K bit/sec. a large number of companies still require a higher speed link to headquar- ters, said Tom Jenkins, an ana- lyst at TeleChoice, Inc. in Vero- na, N.J. \"For companies that have a headquarter site and are using multiple Ti connections, this is a cost-effective solution,\" he said. \"It will save them some- where between 25% and 50%.\" Framatome Technologies, Inc. in Lynchburg, Va., saved $1.2 million last year by convert- ing from leased lines to frame relay, said Terry Hutchens, net- work engineering manager at the engineering services provid- WHO NEEDS ATM?

He said the company expects to save an- other 20% by using single fast frame-relay connections to cus- tomer sites instead of multiple Ti lines. \"The thing we like about it is we don't have to change our equipment to ATM or [Switched Multimegabit Data Services] to get higher speeds,\" he said. Hutchens said the company runs four lines at 3M bit/sec. to customer sites, rias tested the service at 12M bit/sec. and is \"very satisfied.\" Although MFS Communica- tions Co. and LDDS Worldcom. Inc. offer high-speed frame re- lay, their services are limited. Sprint Corp. is expected to add fast frame relay to its service of- ferings next year. On the managed FRAD side, MCI's SNA customers can now purchase, lease or rent Sync Re- search products from MCI. A managed FRAD provides a sin- gle point of contact so custom- ers don't have to manage equip- ment from multiple vendors. As part of MCI's WAN Managed services, Sync will maintain the FRAD equipment.

Unlike previous versions of Explorer, Active Desktop will be able to run as the Windows desktop, replacing the usual interface in Windows 95 and Win- dows NT. The agree- ment adds mo- mentum to a medium that was already be- coming popu- lar over the In- ternet: \"push- oriented\" or \"broadcast\" technology. The idea is simple but powerful: In- stead of wait- ing for users to go to World Wide Web pages on the Internet or an intranet, in- formation systems managers can build pages that push the information from servers to users' desktops. \"It's like a form of multimedia E-mail,\" said Larry Lozon, senior vice president and director of General Motors Corp.'s Cyberworks business unit in Detroit, which is exploring Internet- based marketing and advertising. \"It's immediate. Until now, you had to wait for a user to go back to a Web site for new information. This allows you to send di- rectly to him.\" Cyberworks has been testing a push- oriented tool kit from BackWeb Technol- ogies in San Jose, Calif., since September. The Microsoft/PointCast alliance fol- lows a deal from Netscape Communica- tions Corp. last month to incorporate Castanet push-oriented software from Marimba, Inc. into its upcoming desktop software. Constellation. Marimba is a company in Palo Alto, Calif, that was founded by the inventors of Java. WHAT'S IN STORE Right now, the main application for push technology is delivering news and adver- tising via the Internet. Developers also talk about building intranet applications to push corporate information down to users' desktops. But those applications are just a sliver of the functionality possible with push- oriented technology, according to For- rester Research, Inc. a consultancy in Cambridge, Mass. In the long term, the technology can be used to push programs as well as text, images and animation down to users' desktops, said Forrester analyst John Robb. It is a way to achieve true client/ server computing on the desktop, allow- ing IS managers and software companies to develop applications that distribute themselves so that some processing oc- curs on the server and some on the cli- ent, he said.

Microsoft announced the im- mediate availability of Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0, which includes Microsoft's Java Virtual Machine. \"When you're talking about running across different server platforms, then Java is good. But if you're using NT, all of your other code is reusable anyway.\" - Chuck Toussieng, principal, Alpha Information Systems Not to be outdone by its own technology. Sun's JavaSoft divi- sion said its Java Web Server will be available in the first quarter next year and will include sup- port for Sun's Java Servlet appli- cation programming interface (API). PROS AND CONS Users are divided between the advantages each server offers: the freedom to use any scripting language on Microsoft's server and the ability to run Java pro- grams on any operating system. Early adopters of the Java Web Server, code-named Jeeves, wel- comed the ability to write serv- lets. Servlets are server-side Java applications that will run with Jeeves on any platform that sup- ports the Java Virtual Machine. But Microsoft users said they are more likely to use the Micro- soft server's new Active Server Pages for building back-end applications. An Active Server Page tells the server to build a page that contains specific infor- mation requested by a client. \"When you're talking about running across different server platforms, then Java is good,\" said Chuck Toussieng, a princi- pal at Alpha Information Sys- tems, an Internet service provid- er in Temecula, Calif. \"But if you're using [Windows] NT, all of your other code is reusable anyway.\" Toussieng developed an appli- cation for BankAmerica Corp. in San Diego that provides in- surance policy quotes to cus- tomers via the Web. He first wrote the application in Microsoft's Visual Basic and compiled it to run on Unix. Since then, he has migrated the code to Windows NT, then to Microsoft's Internet Server API and finally to Microsoft's VBScript, he said. After he installed the beta ver- sion of Microsoft's IIS 3.0, Tous- sieng embedded the VBScript application in an Active Server Page, which delivers a custom- ized insurance quote based on data provided by the user. \"We've found that, at least for the programmers we have, you can bring someone up to speed on Visual Basic faster than on Java,\" Toussieng said. THE VISUAL BASIC CHOICE Visual Basic's ease of use is one of the most compelling reasons for businesses to develop Inter- net applications in the language, said Clay Ryder, an analyst at Zona Research, Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. \"There's a much larger base of (Visual Basic] developers out there than Java developers,\" he said. \"Getting everyone trained on Java is very costly.\" But developing server-side Java applications brings savings to companies that build lots of client-side Java applets. Ryder added. \"I can develop my dient- side code using the same tools that I use to develop my server code.\" he said. Java applications written to Sun's Java Servlet API will run on any operating system when used with Jeeves, which is writ- ten in Java and will also run any- where. Sun officials said. \"[Jeeves) allows me to design code for [a Common Gateway Interface] or business processes across all platforms,\" said Chris Phillips, senior systems admin- istrator at Canlink Interactive Technologies Ltd. in Kingston, Ontario. Phillips said he has re- used his servlets on clients' ma- chines, all running different op- erating systems.

Livelink Intranet Suite 7 lets end users create a home page for their projects by clicking a button that builds links to a threaded discussion page, a doc- ument management library, a workflow diagram and a search engine. Project managers can add users, set permissions and administer the site through a World Wide Web browser. \"It's really taking very sophis- ticated workflow and pushing dowTi a lot of the logic to the us- er,\" said Ian Campbell, an ana- lyst at International Data Corp. Livelink relieves information systems staffers from having to administer each workgroup's in- tranet site and lets IS control the network. Campbell said. Scott Chate, collaboration and document management group leader at TransCanada Pipe- Lines Ltd. in Calgary, Alberta, said his company plans to mi- grate from the proprietary ver- sion of Livelink to the intranet version to give more users ac- cess to the system. \"We're looking at the new in- tranet version to provide some additional capabilities of cross- platform compatibility and to in- crease our ability to include oth- er parties through the concept of an extranet,\" Chate said. Chate said managers at his company realized the power of an intranet when they used a threaded discussion board to prepare for a meeting of far- flung executives.

The emergence of Wintel as an enterprise-capable platform and performance gains from in- expensive commodity compo- nents are putting pressure on Unix and proprietary server ven- dors to shift business models. And that could prompt ven- dors to force painful platform migrations on users in the next few years, according to a report released recently by Gartner Group, Inc. TURNABOUT \"Traditional IS in the data cen- ter did not have to worry about long-term investment protec- tion or architectural disrup- tions. But all that is about to change very quickly,\" said George Weiss, vice president of SERVER ISSUES In the next five years, these will be the top five considerations for choosing a server: I Performance and scalability I High availability I Software availability and vendor enthusiasm I Level of integration required I Architectural longevity Source: Gartner Group. Inc.. Stamford. Conn. distributed computing plat- forms at Gartner in Stamford. Conn. In fact, corporations should plan for no more than three to four years of architec- tural continuity in server plat- forms, Weiss said. \"Vendors in large part are re- sponding to what they feel is the marketing push from other companies,\" said Brian Cuttler. a systems manager at the State University of Albany in New York. \"They don't want to be per- ceived as being in the market with yesterday's software run- ning on yesterday's hardware,\" Cuttler said. NT FOCUS The Gartner report comes at a time when nearly all the major Unix and proprietary server ven- dors are focusing product, de- velopment and marketing mus- cle on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT. This rapid shift to an NT- centric strategy could lead to the placement of inadequate re- sources on existing platforms, the abrupt dumping of current product streams and confusing integration strategies, according to analysts. Other vendor ac- tions that analysts said could trip users include the following: ■ Migration and application availability issues caused by the move to 64-bit architectures and mainframe-dass servers by some Unix vendors. ■Attempts to meld Unix and In- tel Corp. architectures such as the joint Hewlett-Packard Co. and Intel Merced chip. ■ Vendor attempts to push new and commercially untested Intel-based enterprise servers with technologies such as Non- Uniform Memory Access, sym- metrical multiprocessing and clustering. \"We are at a point in time where the Wintel architecture is increasingly being viewed as a viable alternative\" for enterprise applications by users and ven- dors, said james Greene, an analyst at Summit Strategies. Inc. in Boston. As a result, it is crucial for corporations that plan server migrations to ensure that their vendors offer secure bridges to move applications among plat- forms. SCALABILITY It is also important to ensure that servers have the scalability to handle mixed and increasing workloads, ac- cording to the Gartner report (see chart at left). Such issues \"are a long-term concern for us,\" said Gary Spen- cer, an informa- tion systems di- rector at Black & Decker Corp. in Memphis. \"But we don't see them as be- ing an imminent problem for us right now,\" Spencer said. Black & Decker runs most of its large applications on HP's Unix servers. Spencer said those servers should run for at least another three years or so. Therefore, any server migra- tion issues that are likely to arise won't happen before then, he said. Typically, vendors \"don't want to be perceived as being in the market with yesterday's software running on yesterday's hardware.\" - Brian Cuttler, State University of Albany Analysts: Software costs sap sysplex savings ► Mainframe hardware clustering savings may not be enough By Tim Ouellette as big iron users tie their mainframes together with new clustering technology, vendors are starting to make sure their software can take advantage of the extra processing capability. Mainframe clustering, called parallel sysplex. promises to cut back on user hard- ware costs by al- lowing incremen- tal upgrades of processing power. The clusters use newer CMOS, or air-cooled, main- frames that take up less space and have lower maintenance and energy costs than traditional water-cooled systems. But users must watch soft- ware costs because of the need to upgrade certain pieces of soft- ware to meet clustering require- ments. And in some cases, software licensing fees are higher as more vendors move to Ml PS- based pricing. \"I call it the CMOS tax,\" said Mike Egan, an analyst at Meta Group, Inc. in Stamford, Conn. For high-end users, the in- creases — especially in third- party mainframe software pric- ing — A typical parallel sysplex installation consists of three or tour mainframes and totals about 1,200 MIPS of processing power, according to Annex Research. could wipe out IBM-based hard- ware savings, he said. USER INTEREST Even with the soft- ware cost issues, analysts said there is a steady build-up of user interest and installation suc- cess with parallel ^^^^^ sysplex (see chart). User sites such as Mellon Bank Co. and Edmonton Tele- phone & Telegraph claim in- creased capacity and lower costs. But some users are taking a wait-and-see approach. To make the software transi- tion to parallel sysplex as smooth as possible, vendors have announced the following plans: ■ Neon Systems, Inc. in Sugar Land, Texas, in january will ship Affinities Server for CICSplex. The software lets CICS transac- tion applications work in a par- allel sysplex without any repro- gramming. ■ Hogan Systems, Inc. in Dallas next fall will release a version of its financial transaction software that was specifically designed for parallel sysplex environ- ments. ■ Hitachi Data Systems Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif, last week an- nounced an MVS-based soft- ware auditing service that prom- ises to cut licensing costs by identifying unused MVS soft- ware licenses across a network. Though not targeted at main- frame clusters, the Hitachi ser- vice could help users negotiate more favorable software licens- ing deals before moving to par- allel sysplex. Egan said he rec- ommends such an approach to avoid increased MlPS-based pricing. Nine major software vendors, including Computer Associates er, according to Annex Research in Phoenix. Applications have to be updat- ed for parallel sysplex because most packages aren't geared for multiple processors.

In the meantime, rivals such as Oracle Corp. and Informix Software, Inc. \"have done a real- ly good job of exploiting Sy- base's difficulties,\" he said. The arts organization is 'It doesn't look real good to your CEO and other executives when you don't meet your com- mitments,\" he said. Despite such misgivings, the utility still gave Sybase a chance to compete against Oracle and other vendors for an integrated database/application software purchase this fall. \"But they didn't really express an interest, while Oracle was banging our doors down,\" Jen- sen said. Robert Epstein, executive vice president at Sybase, acknowl- edged in an interview this month that the company isn't \"get- ting growth from the SQL Server business primarily be- cause we've spent all of our time focused on the installed base as opposed to finding new customers.\" CHANGES IN THE WINGS It could take another 18 months for Sybase to rid itself of the im- age fallout resulting from the SQL Server 10 problems and three straight quarters of losses this year, Epstein said.

Other products on the hori- zon include a Web applica- tion server code-named Jaguar, middleware that links Java app- lets to multiple databases and Unix versions of the SQL Server bundle. But the strategy is taking a long time to gel, leaving Sy- base \"kind of a no-show\" in new markets such as the Web, said Stan Dolberg, an ana- lyst at Forrester Research, Inc. in Cambridge.

Page 55 Vendors' PowerPC strategies rest with fate of Mac OS upgrade POWER AHEAD What's ahead for the PowerPC Platform Apple will announce Mac OS strategy Apple's System 7.6 for CHRP ships First wave of CHRP machines ships PowerPC-based Java Virtual Machines due By Lisa Picarille ANALYSIS RUNNING WINDOWS NT On PowerPC chips was expected to be the savior of the PowerPC platform. But now it is unclear whether PowerPC backers IBM and Motorola, Inc. will even continue to offer that option. An estimated 4.2 million PowerPC-based desktops will ship this year, according to International Data Corp. The uncertainty may clear up — for both users and vendors — when Apple Computer, Inc. un- veils its Macintosh operating system strategy Jan. 7. The PowerPC Platform, for- merly known as the Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP), was supposed to sup- port multiple operating sys- tems, including Apple's Mac OS, Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT, Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s Solaris and 1 BM s A1X. Because Apple leads the PowerPC charge — with 90% of PowerPC system sales — it seems that PowerPC part- ners IBM and Motorola are stuck on hold until Apple re- veals its plan. The lack of a mass-market op- erating system has delayed de- livery of CHRP systems until the middle of next year. They were originally due the middle of this year. The delay cost Apple one of its biggest users. Lockheed Mar- tin Missiles & Space stalled a move to Windows for more than a year because it was wait- ing for CHRP. But this month the Sunny- vale, Calif, aerospace giant — with more than 9.500 Macin- toshes — decided to phase out the Macintosh. \"Lockheed would not be stan- dardizing on NT if Apple had come out with CHRP two years ago when they first pre- dicted it would be out.\" said Mike Bailey, a systems analyst at Lockheed. \"CHRP would have taken the market by storm back then. But now NT on the PC has thou- sands of applications, and NT on the PowerPC has virtually none. That makes NT on CHRP irrelevant and not mainstream,\" Bailey said. To date, Apple has failed to deliver a Mac OS version that runs on CHRP, although it is ex- pected to ship a PowerPC ver- sion of System 7.6 in March. Beyond that release, most users and industry watchers bet Apple will buy or license Be, Inc.'s BeOS operating system and meld it with parts of Apple's stalled Mac OS project, code- named Copland. A REAL CHOICE The result would be Apple's next-generation Mac OS for the PowerPC, which could be a powerful alternative to Windows NT on both the Intel and Power- PC platforms. Because IBM and Motorola are shipping PowerPC ma- chines running NT, Apple's po- tential support of the BeOS could throw a monkey wrench into their NT plans. IBM has found that sales of its AlX-based PowerPC RS/ 6000 products make up 90% of its workstation sales. But the low demand for NT on I BM workstations — coupled with Apple's potential move to the BeOS — may force IBM to halt its support for NT on PowerPC, IBM sources said. \"IBM is in a quandary,\" said Jim Garden, an analyst at Tech- nology Business Research in Hampton, N.H. \"It's very unclear what will happen to NT on PowerPC. If Apple puts all its force behind Be, then IBM will have to join in,\" Garden said. Because Motorola is the main PowerPC chip maker and sells most of those chips to Apple, it has little to lose no matter what Apple decides. But if Apple goes with the BeOS, the Motorola Computer Group's sales of NT PowerPC computers could decline, ob- servers noted.

To get a distrib- uted, single development environment would save huge amounts of time and money.\" Obrey estimated that he could save 30% to 40% of his application-building time by using one integrated environ- ment. \"Four-wheel drives are better in the woods, and race cars are better in the streets. No one tool is good at every- thing,\" he said. LESS TO LEARN Dan Budimir, a senior software engineer at AlliedSignal Aerospace in Columbia, Md., said having an integrated environ- ment would mean less training — and fewer training expenditures — for his developers. \"A consistent user in- terface is a great advantage,\" Budimir said. \"It's like asking my employees to learn [just] Spanish compared to asking \"A consistent user interface is a great advantage.\" - Dan Budimir, AlliedSignal Aerospace them to learn Hindi, Spanish, French and Latin.\" Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans said the environment will have a common look and feel for many aspects of the development process, including class libraries and graphical development tools. Developers, for instance, would use a common graphical tool to build ap- plications. When they move on to lan- guage-specific tasks, such as writing a complex routine in algorithms, they could then use the language of their choice, whether it is Visual Basic, C++ or Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s Java. Without an integrated environment, developers have to work with a specific tool for the graphics creation and then write the code in another language. MORE CONTROL David Kelly, an analyst at Hurwitz Group, Inc. in Newton, Mass., said if Microsoft can make this work, developers could have better control over their projects. \"If all the code is unified with com- mon libraries and graphics components, it's easier to leverage it across projects and increase [software component] re- use,\" he said. David Lingren, director of advanced development at DunsGate. a subsidiary of The Dun & Bradstreet Corp. in New York, said Microsoft has been head- ing in this direction by increasingly tai- loring development tools to mirror one another. \"They have been moving, in a number of releases, to try to bring the integrated development environment into a com- mon look and feel,\" Lingren said. \"It's a consistent way of looking at source code, of browsing through OLE objects, a con- sistent code editor.\" Microsoft's Internet Studio, released in October, came close to this by offering an integrated environment in which to write World Wide Web applications. The new environment, however, wouldn't be limited to the Internet. Developers said the benefits are more than saving time and money. \"It's about flow. It's creativity,\" said Pat Tormey, an engineer and owner of Four- square Solutions, a development compa- ny in Derry, N.H. \"You have to get your programming done when the juices are flowing.

Adaptec, Inc. in Milpitas, Calif., also is working on a variation of the same em- bedded technology. But Mylex in Fre- mont, Calif, seems to be the leader in the market for RAID controllers, said analyst Jim Porter, president of Disk/Trend, Inc. in Mountain View, Calif. Storage control devices currently are sold as add-in boards to nearly all server manufacturers and integrators. \"It's probably a very good competitive move, since Adaptec has been moving in the same direction,\" said Phil Devin, a chief analyst at Dataquest in San Jose, Calif.

Mylex officials and analysts said. The Mylex announcement shows that RAID technology for backup of data is pervasive and should become more so with embedded RAID devices, analysts said. \"There was zero RAID in 1990, but in six years, 70% to 75% of servers on enter- prise system networks have RAID capa- bility. The trend is continuing upward so that we'll approach 95% by the end of the century,\" Porter said. It is partly because of RAID's domi- nance that Mylex developed the embed- ded controllers, company officials said. Having embedded controllers in PC serv- ers could be a strong motivation to cost- cutting manufacturers, Porter said. But Devin said manufacturers might not adopt the Mylex technology unless it pro- vides \"really great cost savings.\" The Mylex products will be available early next year, but Porter said the em- bedded products might not be in servers for a year or two. Mylex plans to include a next-generation add-in controller board, the DAC960PG. that can be used for all server levels. It will cost up to $1,350 for a three-channel configuration. The DAC960PC would be used in entry-level to midrange servers. It will cost $950. The other embedded control- ler, called Rome, would be used for mid- range and some enterprise servers and will cost roughly half the price of the DAC960PG, company officials said.

DX500 uses a SQL database to track user names and associated information and can return entries from large directo- ries in just a few seconds, users who have developed enterprise directories around the software said. In contrast to the SQL approach, most X.500 offerings use a flat-file system that can get bogged down when it is loaded with names. \"We did some benchmarking [of X.500 directories], and [DX500] came out on top,\" said Max Montanaro, man- ager for electronic commerce services at Optus Communication Ltd., a telecom- munications company in Sydney, Austra- lia. Optus is tracking about 20,000 en- tries in a directory that is the basis of an electronic commerce service aimed at businesses. SCALABILITY ISSUES Montanaro said the telecommunications firm's benchmarks show that DX500 will scale to support up to millions of entries. Directory scalability is becoming more important as information systems shops seek to build directories over the Internet that include listings from trading part- ners and other sources. \"[Datacraft] has focused on a key issue surrounding X.500 — performance.\" said Nina Bums, president of Creative Networks, Inc., a consultancy in Palo Alto, Calif. Building an X.500 directory on top of a SQL database makes sense. Burns said. Besides improving performance, the DX500 product could address another key issue with X.500 directories, users said. Typically, it is difficult to modify the format of directory entries once the direc- tory is built. Montanaro said. But because it is based on SQL. DX500 is flexible in this regard, he said. The DX500 directory is available now and costs $24,000 per server. RECRUIT TOP IT.

In what analysts have de- scribed as the largest outsourc- ing deal to date, Andersen Con- sulting and Computer Sciences Corp. (CSQ will split the io- year. $4 billion job. When Du Pont earlier this year announced plans to explore IS outsourcing. Chief Informa- tion Officer Cinda A. Hallman said the company regarded its IS operations as best-of-breed and wanted any vendors it selected to deliver more than just information technology ser- vices. Du Pont wants a return on IT equity, said Christian Meyers, an analyst at G2 Research, Inc. in Mountain View, Calif. Hallman said the deal is ex- pected to reduce Du Pont's IS costs by between 5% and 10% — considerably less than the cost savings of between 15% and 20% typically generated in mega-outsourcing deals. That is largely because Hallman was able to reduce IS expenses by 40% in the past three years. \"We expect to achieve a much higher degree of variability\" on IS costs, said Hallman, who went to great lengths to avoid the word \"outsourcing.\" Hallman said she hopes the alliance with CSC and Andersen will let Du Pont cut its IT costs and pump those savings into new businesses where it contin- ues to diversify, such as those in the Pacific Rim. \"We're all the way to having a hosiery store in China. That's much different\" than our past approach of making only the raw materials, Hallman said. STAFF MIGRATIONS Under the deal, which will take effect in the second quarter of next year, Du Pont will transfer 2,600 of its 4,200 IS employees to CSC. The El Segundo, Calif, systems integrator, which has acquired Du Pont's 13 data cen- ters under the agreement, will migrate the chemical and ener- gy giant's 30 business units to SAP America, Inc. R/3 business software. Another 500 IS staffers will be offered positions with Ander- sen, which will develop chemi- cal and energy applications for Du Pont. About 1,100 IS professionals will remain at Du Pont to man- age the relationships with CSC and Andersen and develop core applications, such as process monitoring, research and devel- opment, and selected business programs. The Du Pont deal is unique in that the Wilmington, Del. -based company will assert strong managerial control over all IT decisions carried out by the ven- dors. \"It appears that Andersen and CSC will remain suppliers, cooperators and competitors for new business\" under the Du Pont agreement, said George Logemann, an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston. About $400 million of Du Pont's $690 million IS budget will go to CSC and Andersen. The rest will be used to pay its remaining staff and support the application development it is re- taining. Over the length of the agree- ment, $550 million will go to Andersen and $3.45 billion to CSC. Security experts warn of Christmas Day hack attacks By Patrick Thibodeau the san diego Super Com- puter Center (SDSC) isn't ex- pecting a jolly man bearing gifts to come down the chimney on Christmas Eve. Instead, the agency antici- pates an increase in \"doorknob twisting\" — attempts to achieve what hack- er Kevin Mitnick did on Dec. 25 two years ago. Mitnick allegedly broke in to computer security researcher Tsutomo Shimumo- ra's computers at the SDCS. The SDSC monitors its comput- ers 24 hours a day. but Shimumora's computers weren't part of the SDSC securi- ty system. Computer networks and Worldwide Web sites may be at greater risk of attack from hackers during long holiday periods. TRYING OUT THE GIFTS This year's break-in attempts will begin in earnest at roughly the same time hackers are prob- ably bringing their new Christ- mas gifts on-line. \"We definitely see increases on the holiday, beginning on Christmas day at about 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,\" said Thomas Hutton, network and security architect for the super- nurses say about a full moon: fighting experience. runs an information security computer center. \"They will tell you for sure that \"People who tend to break in firm in Springfield, Va.
