        "text": "Whenever we get a Net New Implementation, we are often asked, “How do we set up a new user on NetSuite?” Let me show you a couple of ways and some troubleshooting tips for adding a new employee/user. Note: NetSuite users can also include vendors, partners, and customers.\n\nAdding a New Employee/User\n\nBe sure to be logged in as the Administrator.\n\nIn order to give someone access to NetSuite, you will need to begin by creating an employee record. Go to Lists > Employees > Employees > New.\n\nEnter the NAME and the EMAIL address. (The email will be the user login)\n\nEnter the SUBSIDIARY if there are multiple.\n\nNote: You may fill in other fields on the employee/user record as preferred, but this is all that is needed when giving someone access to NetSuite.\n\nClick the Access subtab.\n\nCheck GIVE ACCESS box\n\nThere are 2 options in how you can setup the password:\n\nCheck SEND NOTIFICATION EMAIL box – an auto generated email will be sent to setup password OR\n\nCheck MANUALLY ASSIGN OR CHANGE PASSWORD Box, assign a password of your choice, and Check REQUIRE PASSWORD CHANGE ON NEXT LOGIN. Then, send them the following:\n\nUse this link: https://system.netsuite.com/pages/customerlogin.jsp?country=US\n\nEmail Login and Password\n\nNote: You will be required to change your password upon next login.\n\nSelect the Role that you need to assign and click Add. Note: You can select multiple roles under this user without affecting the number of licenses you have.\n\nWhen you have finished entering all the information, click Save.\n\nTroubleshooting Tips\n\nDidn’t receive the autogenerated email? Check your Spam folder.\n\nWant to ensure you get the password set up in the first try? Select option B and have user change their password.\n\nMake sure all the necessary boxes are checked.\n\nBonus Tip: Want to make sure you are not giving out more access than your allotted number of NetSuite licenses?\n\nGo to Setup > Company > View Billing Information (scroll all the way down)\n\nYou’ll see Full Licensed Users** look at the difference of CURRENT PROVISIONED QTY and CURRENT USED QTY and you’ll have your number of available users.\n\nNow you’re equipped to add a new user, employee, vendor, partner, or customer.
