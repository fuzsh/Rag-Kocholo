        "text": "In 2024, it is more important than ever that organisations streamline their operations and maximise their profit margins. No single business change can do this more than implementing an ERP system.\n\nAs an organisation who has helped hundreds of companies implement NetSuite, we understand exactly what goes into pricing a NetSuite implementation. There's no \"quick price\" that we can give, because the number is very much dependent on your business requirements. However, we will give you the exact step by step process that should be used to calculate how much your NetSuite license and implementation will cost.\n\nBut if you'd like to skip the reading and find out how much NetSuite will cost for your specific business requirements, fill in our pricing calculator below!\n\nStep 1: Choosing your Implementation Partner\n\nThe very first step in your ERP journey is choosing which providerwill help you in your implementation journey. The main way in which organisations implement NetSuite is through:\n\n1. NetSuite's Sales and Services Team, or\n\n2. Through a reseller, otherwise known as a NetSuite Solution Provider.\n\nAs such, the pricing will vary, and there are pros and cons to each channel.\n\nNetSuite Sales and Service Team\n\nSome companies choose to work directly with NetSuite's sales and service team, comprised of sales reps who specialise in specific industries. You will have an initial consultation with a sales rep, followed by a demo of the system, and then you may finish off with a competitive intelligence rep who will sell you on the pro's of NetSuite and cons of other solutions.\n\nIt's important to bear in mind that although each rep will have good knowledge of the system, their main priority is to sell the software. They often don't have much experience using or implementing NetSuite, meaning they may sell you modules or integrations that aren't actually necessary for your business.\n\nNetSuite Solution Provider\n\nA NetSuite solution provider offers customised consulting services from a diverse team of specialists. These people have direct experience of implementing ERP solutions into organisations across various industries. They provide deep insights about which edition you need, how best to implement the system, and they customise your solution to fit your needs. They are programmers, management consultants, technology and integration experts, and end users, so they know the system inside and out. Solution providers are also not bound to Oracle's implementation procedures, so they can be much more flexible with what they charge, often making it a cheaper option.\n\nStep 2: Choosing a Suite\n\nOnce you have decided on NetSuite for your ERP solution, you must determine which suite of apps will work best for you. In order to do this, we first need to focus on the size of your organisation and what functionality you will need. The main questions we would ask you is how many entities do you have, and how many users do you need, as this forms the basis of which suite you would need.\n\nLegacy NetSuite Editions\n\nThere are two different classifications of NetSuite, and they are referred to as \"NetSuite editions\". The first is classified as NetSuite's legacy edition. These have been offered since NetSuite was created, and they include:\n\n- Starter Edition - This is for companies that do not require more than 10 full users (we will go on to discuss users a bit later), are only managing one legal entity, and don't have over 50 employees. This edition is therefore more suitable for small businesses.\n\n- Mid-Market Edition - This is for companies that require more than 10 full users and are managing two or more legal entities. This edition is therefore suitable for small to medium size businesses.\n\n- Enterprise Edition - This is for companies that require more than 1000 full users and are managing two or more legal entities, and therefore is more suitable for very large and established organisations.\n\nEach of these editions come with the below out of the box functionality (NetSuite ERP and CRM), and would then be tailored to fit the needs of the organisation.\n\nNetSuite ERP Standard Features:\n\nGeneral Ledger\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts Payable\n\nAcceptance of Credit Cards, ACH, EFT\n\nBank Management & Reconciliations\n\nMulti-Currency & Multi-Language\n\nItem & (basic) Inventory Management\n\nProject Management (basic capabilities - see SRP below for more capabilities)\n\nOrder Management\n\nPurchasing\n\nEmployee Center (Time & Expense Management)\n\nNetSuite CRM Standard Features:\n\nMarketing Automation\n\nSales Force Automation (SFA)\n\nCase Management\n\nPartner Relationship Management\n\nSuiteSucess\n\nThe second suite of apps available is \"SuiteSuccess\". NetSuite released SuiteSuccess in 2017, with the aim to bring together 20 years of learning and create a unified industry best practise solution.\n\nSuiteSuccess was produced to solve industry problems that once prevented companies from scaling and growing, and now enables a much more streamlined implementation process. Oracle claim go-live can be achieved in 100 days, which can be possible, however it is very much determined by the organisation and their specific needs.\n\nBased on your industry, SuiteSuccess offers a selection of processes and functionality that gives each implementation a starter point for success (pardon the pun!). This includes things like predefined function roles, relevant dashboards, flexible chart of accounts, item management, KPIs reporting and more.\n\nThen, based on your companies specific needs, you will select a range of further modules that will give you full functionality, and enable you to run your business efficiently and effectively (keep reading to find out about additional modules).\n\nLike the legacy version, SuiteSuccess also offers different levels, which is again, mostly based on number of users. These include:\n\n- Starter - For companies with less than 10 users and up to 50 employees.\n\n- Standard - For companies that require ERP only (no CRM) functions, for more than 10 users and two or more legal entities.\n\n- Premium - For companies requiring full ERP AND CRM capabilities, for more than 10 users and two or more legal entities.\n\nEach level is based off the same foundational technology and is hosted within Oracle's multi-tenant secure data centres.\n\nSo, how do I pick between Legacy or SuiteSuccess?\n\nThe suite you choose very much depends on the size of your business. If you are a small company, with only simple financial needs and don't have ambition to expand beyond one entity any time soon, then the legacy option may be a better and cheaper fit.\n\nWhereas if you are a larger company that requires multiple entities and customisations, then SuiteSuccess would be a better fit.\n\nPro Tip: Who you choose as your implementation partner can become very important. SuiteSuccess has better functionality and is more expensive than the legacy options, so naturally Oracle want as many organisations to choose it as possible. This means if you chose NetSuite's Sales and Services Team as your implementation partner, they often won't mention the legacy options, and this could mean you lose out on some significant savings. For most companies SuiteSuccess is probably the best option, but for some, the legacy option may be better.\n\nNetSuite solution providers like Threadgold Consulting will always be looking out for your best interests, and will always advise the right subscription for your company, regardless of price. We understand that the many different options can become a bit confusing, so we will work with you to ensure you understand the differences and chose the best fit for you.\n\nService Tiers\n\nThere is one final thing to consider when pricing your license. As a company grows, a number of metrics will grow with them, mainly the number of users, transaction volumes and data storage. This naturally puts more pressure on Oracle's data servers, and as such they have created several service tiers, with increasing costs with each tier. The tiers and their limits are as follows:\n\nA SuiteCloud Plus license enables more seamless data flow, increasing the number of channels that data can flow into and within NetSuite. SuiteCloud Plus enables organisations to increase throughout by increasing concurrency, and allows advanced customisations and integrations. A sandbox account is essentially a test account that allows organisations to make additional customisations that will not impact their day-to-day operations.\n\nThe good news is despite these additional costs, customers who have upgraded to the next tier have reported more capacity at scheduled downtimes, greater transaction throughput and faster processing, and all agree that upgrading service tiers was a positive investment for their organisation.\n\nWant to find out more? Check out our comprehensive guide to NetSuite Service Tiers!\n\nStep 3: User Licenses\n\nIn the SaaS world, there are generally two ways to determine cost. A concurrent licensing model, or a named user model. NetSuite opts for a name user model, and therefore your price is heavily reliant on the number of employees that need to use the system. However, there are a range of different user licenses that you can opt for, and ways to make the total cost slightly cheaper.\n\nFull User License\n\nEach individual who transacts with the system frequently will require their own unique license. It might be tempting to only buy one license and share it between people, but people won't be able to use the account at the same time, and it will make it almost impossible to track who has made changes.\n\nIndividual full licenses enable full functionality of the system, and ensures comprehensive audibility. Each full license costs $120 per month (this varies slightly depending on your currency), however you aren't limited to the number you purchase at initial implementation, you can start with fewer licenses and add them on as you go.\n\nWithin each full license, NetSuite offers a range of different role types which give you various degrees of access. For example, Sales Managers will have slightly more functionality of the CRM module, and the CFO will have more access to the finance modules. The roles are fully customisable so you can alter them to fit your organisation.\n\nEmployee Self-Service License\n\nNetSuite also offers limited function licenses called an \"Employee Self-Service\" license. Typically, these licenses are for people that need limited access to the system, and only allow employees to enter PTO requests, manage expense reports and log time against projects.\n\nThese limited use licenses can be purchased in packs of 5 for the same price as one full license ($120 per year), making it a very cost-effective option. And fear not, if people without a full license need access to data and reports, NetSuite can generate reports to non license users via Excel, CSV or a third-party format.\n\nVendor and Customer License\n\nFinally, NetSuite offers licenses for vendors and customers. Vendor access enables partners to search, view and print purchase orders that you create with them. This level of self-service improves the relationship with vendors, and is completely free, meaning it can scale with your business.\n\nCustomer access enables them to update their contact information, change their subscription preferences, submit support issues and even process payments if you configure your system to support this. This can create a better user/customer experience and improve reviews of your organisation. Again, this is totally free and scalable.\n\nStep 4: Choosing the right Advanced Modules for your business\n\nThe base NetSuite package offers a robust collection of integrated apps that serve many businesses. However, in order to serve the many different types of companies that run on NetSuite, Oracle created \"Advanced Modules\" that further extend the system's functionality.\n\nWhen adding Advanced Modules, you can select them \"a-la-carte\" one at a time, or bundle them together in an industry-specific suite. For example, the Manufacturing Suite includes extra modules and features to handle all the tasks that go along with the manufacturing process, such as warehouse management and advanced procurement.\n\nNetSuite module pricing varies by complexity and industry, but they range from approximately $599 per month to $1699 per month. You can add them on at any time, but only remove them at the time of your software renewal. Some of the advanced module bundles available include:\n\nInventory & Manufacturing Management Modules (WMS & WRP)\n\nDemand Planning\n\nAdvanced Inventory\n\nAdvanced Procurement\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing WIP and Routing\n\nWork Orders and Assemblies\n\nWarehouse Management (WMS)\n\nFinancial Management Modules\n\nOracle NetSuite Planning and Budgeting Cloud Service (PBCS)\n\nFixed Assets\n\nOneWorld\n\nSuiteBilling\n\nMulti-book Accounting\n\nAdvanced Financials\n\nAdvanced Revenue Management\n\nHuman Capital Management (HCM)\n\nSuitePeople\n\nPremier Payroll Service\n\nServices Resource Planning Modules (SRP)\n\nOpenAir\n\nJob Costing\n\nResource Allocation\n\nProject Management\n\nE-Commerce and Retail Management Modules (POS)\n\nSuiteCommerce Standard\n\nSuiteCommerce Advanced\n\nSuiteCommerce InStore\n\nAdvanced Order Management\n\nYou can easily see why it gets confusing with so many suites, modules, service tiers, and industry-specific options. This is why Threadgold Consulting are dedicated to working with you to help you understand and create the perfect system for your business. We can offer a full breakdown of NetSuite's price list, so get in touch now if you'd like to see how much each individual module costs.\n\nStep 5: Calculating your implementation costs\n\nWhen deciding to move your business to NetSuite cloud ERP, keep in mind the cost of licensing is not the only expense you will incur. You must also pay for the implementation, which is essentially the costs from your partner for the work they will do in setting up your business on the system.\n\nThe cost of this piece will vary based on your company's size, your complexity, and the partner you choose to work with. Working with a company that has extensive experience within your industry will make the process easier and, therefore, less expensive.\n\nThere are generally 3 phases that make up a successful NetSuite Implementation. These include:\n\n- Project Kick-Off and Discovery - The first phase mainly involves project requirements gathering. Your partner will work with you and your stakeholders to discuss project scope, timeline and expectations. An engaged and thorough project discovery is essential for ensuring a smooth transition and preventing any unanticipated costs in the future.\n\n- Data Migration and System Customisation - The second phase involves migrating your data to your new system, integrating any third-party apps, and configuring any specific customisations that you require, such as specific workflows or custom reporting (like manufacturing analytics tools). This phase can often be time consuming, as some customisations can be extensive and need a lot of testing. As such, you should allocate a specific portion of your budget to this phase.\n\n- User Training and Testing - This phase is where your partner will train your employees to use their new system. This is used to identify if things are working properly, and is often where slight niggles are highlighted and fixed.\n\nAs there are so many factors that contribute to the pricing of implementations, you can expect to pay anywhere from $10,000 to $250,000. Partners will also generally offer you either a fixed fee contract, or a time and materials contract.\n\nFor a more detailed view of each step, check out our comprehensive guide to NetSuite implementations.\n\nStep 6: Integrating third-party apps\n\nOracle has always aimed for NetSuite to be the most extensive and easily integrated ERP on the market. They understand that businesses have multiple different needs that can't always be accomplished with one system, and as such Oracle have tried to make it as quick and easy as possible to integrate third-party apps into your NetSuite solution. We will now discuss these different ways and explain how they impact your pricing.\n\nSuiteScript\n\nSuiteScript is the main way in which third-party apps can be integrated into NetSuite. NetSuite used to have to rely on integration platforms (explained below) to carry out integrations, however now it is easier and cheaper than ever to connect your third-party apps.\n\nSuiteScript is built on Java Script and allows you to customise, search for and process your third-party data. It is compatible with an array of CRM software, social media networks or e-commerce platforms, and it can also integrate other web 2.0 tools such as blogs and instant messaging. Threadgold Consulting have produced our very own WhatsApp Integration, that will allow your sales team to manage all their instant messaging needs right from NetSuite!\n\nSuiteScript is available with your license at no extra cost. The only costs associated with integrating third-party apps is the time that your implementation partner will charge you for carrying out the work. The amount that you pay will largely depend on the number of third-party apps that you use and the complexity of these apps. For integrations, you can expect to pay anywhere from $0-$10,000, so be sure to consider this within your budget.\n\nIntegration Platform (iPaaS)\n\nAs mentioned previously, before SuiteScript, NetSuite used to have to rely on third party integration platforms to perform app integrations. However, this is still an option if you would prefer to use a solution that is an expert in integrations.\n\nIt does come at a higher price point, and this can range from $500 to $5000 per month, again depending on the number and complexity of app integrations. Big players in this field include Celigo and Dell Boomi. Check out our blog post for more info on NetSuite integrations.\n\nStep 7: Post Go-Live Support\n\nLast but certainly not least, you need to factor in post go-live support costs. Although your implementation partner will have trained your employees to use the system, there will always be extra issues and queries that pop up along the way. In order to ensure you are not wasting precious time and money by figuring things out for yourself, it is important to have a robust support contract in place.\n\nNetSuite offer technical support for free with each license, but the service is very limited. Companies who want 24/7 support will have to upgrade to a premium support contract, which is based on a proportion of your license value, and can get quite pricey for the service you receive.\n\nOne of the better ways to access a support contract is by using your implementation provider, or if you went with NetSuite direct, you can reach out to any partner and they would be more than happy to help. There are two main ways in which partners price their support contracts, and these are by fixed fee and time and materials.\n\nFixed Fee\n\nThis involves paying a fixed fee each month for a certain quantity of hours. Using their extensive experience, your partner will calculate how many hours per month they predict you will need based on:\n\n- Your industry\n\n- Your business size\n\n- The level of implementation across departments\n\nFor example, a small business with 5 users, and only implementing NetSuite financials, will need much fewer hours than a business with 100 users who have implemented across all departments (financials, sales, procurement, inventory management etc). As a rough guide, partners will charge anywhere from $150-$250 per hour, and tend to set a minimum of 5 hours per month.\n\nThis means at the very minimum you will be spending $750 per month on support, and hours are often on a use it or lose it basis. Most partners will set an initial period for the contract, after which the amount of hours can be adjusted once you have a better idea of how many you are going to need.\n\nTime and materials\n\nThe other slightly less common option is to go with a time and materials contract. This means you pay only for the hours that you use. The reason this isn't such a popular option is that it doesn't guarantee you consistent resource. With a fixed fee contract, solution providers know exactly how much minimum resource they need to allocate, and will therefore have capacity allocated within their team to respond in a timely manner. With T&M contracts, your partner won't have preallocated resource, meaning it could take longer for your query to be answered, and won't necessarily be with the person who is familiar with your business.\n\nExtra Tip\n\nAs mentioned earlier, NetSuite Solution providers have much more freedom to create a support contract that fits your business. But to extend upon this, we would encourage you to go with a small to medium sized provider for your support contract. Large solution providers often have very process driven and inflexible support systems in place.\n\nThis means your query will often go into a waiting list, and will be assigned to a random consultant who is next available. This could mean that 1. you have to wait days for them to even pick up your query, and 2. they may not be very familiar with your system, so will take longer to solve the query. Both of these combine to make the process more time confusing and frustrating for you.\n\nChoosing a more boutique partner like Threadgold Consulting means that they will have much more flexible systems in place and quicker response times. They will often assign the same consultants who worked on your implementation the entire way through, meaning they are very familiar with your system. More familiarity and quicker response times combine to make the process a lot easier. This is something you should really consider when choosing your support partner, as you will likely be working with them for a very long time.\n\nNetSuite License Money Savings Tips\n\nWith the economy and cost of living crisis as it is, we understand that companies need to save every penny they can. One of the main features that Oracle provides to save money is the opportunity to finance your license cost. The standard is to pay a year upfront, but they offer the chance to split the cost and pay monthly, with 0% interest.\n\nIn addition to this, here are some more money saving tips that we have picked up through our extensive experience of NetSuite licensing and implementations.\n\nWorking with a NetSuite Solution Provider\n\nNow you might think this is biased because we are one, but working with a NetSuite Solution Provider will truly bring you savings in a number of ways. Firstly, they are aware of the downsides of NetSuite licensing, and will help you get the best deal possible from Oracle.\n\nFor example, it is extremely hard to negotiate against license increases at contract renewal. Oracle know you have spent a lot of time and money on implementation, and they know switching providers isn't a great option. As such, they will often increase fees quite substantially, and this is based on your initial license cost. Therefore getting it right the first time is crucial, and NetSuite's Sales and Services team will want that initial cost to be as high as possible, whereas solution providers will do everything they can to get a good price for you.\n\nNetSuite Solution Providers also have much more flexibility when it comes to implementation costs, and can give you discounts which would be much harder to approve within the NetSuite Sales and Services team.\n\nLong Term Contracts\n\nOne of our other top tips for saving money is to try and negotiate a longer term contract. Oracle offer contracts from as short as 12 months, to as long as 5 years. By agreeing a longer term contract, you know exactly how much you will be paying each year for the specific length of time, and can budget/plan accordingly. You also won't have to deal with frequent price increases that occur once a contract ends, so it is a much safer option to go for.\n\nThe right timing\n\nOracle are held to strict sales targets, and these often get reviewed monthly and quarterly. As such, if you're going to buy a NetSuite license, the best time to do so is at the end of a month or quarter. You will also get the greatest wins by purchasing your license at the end of their financial year in April, as Oracle tend to give out large discounts so that they can hit their targets.\n\nBuy now, add later\n\nA common misconception is that you need to decide how many modules and users you need right from the start. This simply isn't the case. You can always add modules on, but once you've purchased them, you have to wait until your contract ends to remove them.\n\nTherefore, we'd very much advise that you start off by purchasing the base package to get your organisation running on NetSuite, and then you can add on modules and users as you go. This is an effective way to save money upfront, and spread the costs out over time.\n\nBreaking down your implementation costs\n\nPartners will often give you a bulk estimate for your NetSuite implementation cost. This is quite hard to see whether you are getting value for money, so we'd advise that you ask your partner to break down what each phase is going to cost, and what you will get out of it. You may find that you can make some savings from speeding certain phases up and cutting corners (only where appropriate).\n\nHow does NetSuite pricing compare to alternatives?\n\nThere are many other ERP systems on the market, such as Microsoft Dynamics, SAP Business One, Info CloudSuite and Epicor to name a few. If you were to compare ERP systems simply on price, NetSuite will generally always come out on top. It is a premium ERP system, and the pricing can scare some organisations away. However it is important to understand what you are getting with NetSuite, in comparison with other ERPs.\n\nTrue Cloud ERP\n\nFirstly, NetSuite is a true cloud ERP. It was developed on the cloud, for the cloud, and therefore is the most comprehensive and functional ERP system on the market. This means that every customer accesses the exact same system, and you won't have to pay for any hardware or expensive maintenance of on-premise solutions.\n\nIt also means that the system is always evolving and being improved upon, as it is much easier to roll out an update. If you chose a cheaper on-premise system, then future updates will probably require new hardware, going back to your solution provider and paying for more hefty re-implementations.\n\nModular functionality that supports business growth\n\nSimilarly, NetSuite's modular and plug-and-play functionality means that it is much easier and quicker to add new elements to your system. As your business grows, the system will scale with you. Certain ERP's like Sage Intaact may be cheaper and a better option for a smaller business, but soon enough you will outgrow it and have to implement yet another ERP. Features like NetSuite OneWorld make it much easier to add on entities, and expand your revenue potential. So although you may be paying more upfront, you will be saving money in the future from the system's scalability.\n\nDon't believe us? Then listen to this great review from Bruce Capagli, Chief Operations Officer of Precision Disposables; “I have 15 plus years of experience in all the major ERP platforms, including SAP, and I’ve been through six major implementations. NetSuite was by far the best.\"\n\nCheaper and quicker implementation\n\nFinally, although other ERP's may appear cheaper to start with, they are not as simple to implement. It takes a lot of time and experienced developers to migrate and integrate your business, often making the implementation double or triple that of a NetSuite implementation. This can often cancel out the cheaper license cost, so if that's the case, why not go for the system that has much better functionality and scalability? If you'd like a more in depth analysis of the different ERP's on the market, check out our competitor blog where we delve into what makes each ERP unique and how they compare to NetSuite.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow much does NetSuite cost per month?\n\nThe price per month of your Netsuite license varies significantly based on your company needs, and can be anywhere from $1000 to $100,000 per month. It's also important to note that NetSuite generally charge at the start of the financial year for the full year ahead. There are options to pay monthly on Oracle Finance, but these are subject to credit checks. Check out our pricing calculator to get an early indication of your Netsuite costs.\n\nHow much does NetSuite cost to implement?\n\nNetSuite can cost anywhere from $10,000-$250,000 to implement, again depending on your business and system needs.\n\nIs NetSuite suitable for small businesses?\n\nYes, NetSuite is very much suitable to small businesses, due to the fact you can tailor your chosen modules and users to fit your organisation. You can start off with the minimum required, and then increase modules and users as you expand.\n\nIs there a free version of NetSuite?\n\nNo there is not a free version of NetSuite, however there is a 14 day free trial that you can use to get to know the system and decide whether you like it. Threadgold Consulting can offer this free trial, so do get in touch if you'd like to try NetSuite!\n\nIs NetSuite better than Quickbooks?\n\nYes, NetSuite is better due to the fact it's a comprehensive ERP system offering accounting, CRM, project management, supply chain management, E-Commerce and more. Quickbooks is simply an accounting software, and provides much less functionality. Even certain accounting features can become tricky as your business grows, such as financial consolidation, so we would advise to invest in NetSuite if you are a small to medium sized business that is looking to expand. However, if you are a small one person business looking purely for accounting functionality and is not planning on expanding any time soon, Quickbooks may be a better and more affordable option.\n\nSave Big on NetSuite With Threadgold"
