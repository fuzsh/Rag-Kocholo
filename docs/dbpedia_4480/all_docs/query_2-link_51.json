        "text": "Other available subtabs are:\n\nAddress – Here you can enter the employees home or office address, you are also able to mark it as their default shipping address.\n\nHuman Resources – Under this subtab, you’ll have fields such as social security number and birthday that are optional. By default, job information and expense and purchasing information can be found in this section. Under Expense and Purchasing, expense and purchasing approver and limits can be set. While not mandatory, this section is important to fill out for any employees who will be creating purchase orders or entering expenses. Under the human resources subtab, you will also find information such as emergency contacts, education, marital status, gender, and ethnicity.\n\nSystem Information – Here you can view any changes made to the employee record. You will also have the Inactive checkbox. Instead of deleting an employee, you are able to inactivate the employee record.\n\nAccess – This access tab is what enables an employee to access NetSuite.\n\nSend New User Access Notification Email – Mark this checkbox to initiate an automated email to the employee about their access to NetSuite. The standard NetSuite email includes a link for the user to set up their password. You have the option to assign the user password manually below if you choose not to have the user set up their password independently.\n\nManually Assign or Change Password – When this box is checked, you’ll be able to manually assign a user with a password. This is typically checked if you choose not to check the send new access notification email. In this case, you are responsible for creating the password, communicating it to the user, and providing instructions on when and how to log in. The best practice for security is to avoid transmitting the password via email.\n\nRequire Password Change On Next Login – When checked, the user will be prompted to change their password upon their next login. The user will not be able to access NetSuite until they have changed their password. Here you can also see the password criteria required.\n\nRoles – Here under the access tab, you set the user’s role from the drop down. This role will dictate everything the user can do within the system. In order for the user to access NetSuite, they must be assigned a role. To assign, select a role from the dropdown and hit “Add”. Users can be assigned multiple roles, to do so, repeat these steps. – Add in a suite note that it is best practice to assign custom roles and no standard roles from NetSuite other than administrator as standard roles may not fit your business practice/ permissions."
