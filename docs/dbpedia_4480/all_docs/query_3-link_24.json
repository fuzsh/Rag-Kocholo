        "text": "NetSuite CRM (customer relationship management) and NetSuite ERP (enterprise resource planning) are the two standard software packages that are offered by NetSuite. These packages include a wide range of features that are beneficial for nearly any company.\n\nFor example, NetSuite ERP has all of the following features:\n\nAccounts Payable\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nGeneral Ledger\n\nMulti-Currency and Multi-Language\n\nItem and Basic Inventory Management\n\nProject Management\n\nBank Management & Reconciliations\n\nPurchasing\n\nEmployee Center\n\nAcceptance of Credit Cards, ACH, and EFT\n\nOrder Management\n\nNetSuite CRM includes the following features in its modules:\n\nSales Force Automation / Opportunity Management\n\nContract Renewals\n\nNetSuite CPQ (configure, price, quote)\n\nMarketing Automation\n\nPartner Relationship Management\n\nCustomer Service Management/Case Management\n\nHowever, while NetSuite ERP and NetSuite CRM are very useful, every company has unique needs and these two packages are often not enough by themselves to satisfy every need that companies have. For this reason, NetSuite offers modules that contain software to help businesses with functions beyond what these standard offerings for customer relationship and enterprise resource management can help with.\n\nThe Complete List of NetSuite Modules\n\nSome NetSuite modules are included with the NetSuite platform. Others are add-on NetSuite ERP modules that, if selected, handle your unique business processes at an additional cost.

Want to learn more?\n\nGetting Access to NetSuite Modules\n\nIf your company is interested in getting access to one or a number of different modules offered by NetSuite, then you can license Oracle NetSuite modules on an individual basis, or as a bundle. You can also license an “Industry suite” of modules as a business management system. An industry suite of modules is a set of modules that are commonly used in a specific industry. These modules are designed to meet the unique software needs of companies that are members of a specific industry.\n\nMany companies choose to license industry suites because they are very convenient and are usually quite well-suited to the specific requirements that the company has. The costs for each industry suite and for each module vary depending on edition type and functionality. With one exception for OneWorld, your company can license modules at any period during the duration of your NetSuite subscription period.\n\nHow to Remove Modules\n\nIf you license specific modules from NetSuite, you may find that you only need to use them temporarily. However, unlike adding NetSuite modules, you can only remove them during the contract renewal period. So, if you license 8 modules during your subscription period, you will be forced to pay for these modules for the duration of your contract period. Once the period ends, you can remove them from your plan.\n\nHowever, because modules can only be removed at the contract renewal period, you should be careful not to license more modules than you need. Otherwise, you will end up wasting money. So, choose your modules carefully before you move forward with licensing them.\n\nSelecting the Right Modules\n\nTo get the most out of your NetSuite package, it is very important that you select the right modules to include in your plan. There are several steps to selecting the right modules from a NetSuite module list.\n\nFirst, you need to consider your industry. Depending on your industry, there is a good chance that NetSuite already has an industry suite that is perfect for your company. So, for example, if your company is a software company, then you should see if the NetSuite software industry suite will be ideal for you. If your company is in healthcare, then you should look at the NetSuite healthcare industry suite, etc. Because the industry suites are specifically designed for companies in a given industry, there is a very good chance the industry suite for your industry will meet all of your company’s needs.\n\nAfter you have looked at the industry suites, you should determine if they will meet your requirements fully, or if you will need additional modules. If you need additional modules, then you should first consider the areas of your business where you need software assistance. Then, you should look at all of the additional modules that are available to find the ones that meet your missing requirements. You can use the master list above for reference.\n\nFinally, after you have done these things, the last thing that you need to consider is cost. Keep in mind that if you only need a specific module temporarily, then the cost will be less than it would if you needed it for the full duration of the subscription period. Do not go over budget because, as mentioned above, once you license a module, you will be charged for that module for the rest of the subscription period.\n\nOnce you have the complete list of NetSuite modules that you will need, you can place your order and enjoy their many benefits.\n\nThird-Party Add-on Modules with NetSuite Integration\n\nIn addition to considering NetSuite modules, expand your NetSuite software options to include third-party Oracle NetSuite integrations, including, NetSuite’s SuiteApp of the Year, award-winning AP automation for NetSuite from Tipalti.\n\nYour business can choose the best AP automation software and finance add-ons for NetSuite from a third-party provider.\n\nTipalti AP Automation NetSuite Integration\n\nTipalti AP automation is a real-time, cloud-based NetSuite solution with seamless integration.

Whether you choose to go with an industry suite or with a custom module package that you design yourself, the important thing is to make sure that you are getting software that will cover all of your essential business functions and help improve your bottom line.\n\nWith any NetSuite software package, the goal is always to streamline your business and to make your company run more efficiently.
