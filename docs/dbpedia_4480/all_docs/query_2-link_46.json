        "text": "NetSuite ERP is a massive software with an overwhelming amount of features. But companies using NetSuite don’t have to use all the possible features. Depending on the NetSuite package your company has purchased, you likely don’t even have access to all those features. However, even if you do have access to a particular feature, you still need to turn it on for your account. NetSuite administrators can turn on any feature that their company has access to on the NetSuite Enable Features page.\n\nNetSuite Enable Features Overview\n\nHow do you access the NetSuite Enable Features page? When logged in as the NetSuite administrator for your company, navigate to Setup > Company > Enable Features. When you get to this page, you’ll notice that Enable Features has ten subtabs—Company, Accounting, Tax, Transactions, Items & Inventory, Employees, CRM, Analytics, Web Presence, and SuiteCloud. These categories provide a logical breakdown of the various NetSuite features. They help administrators easily locate features they may need to turn on, making enabling those features relatively simple.\n\nNetSuite Enable Features Users\n\nWho needs to know what is available on each of the Enable Features subtabs? As we mentioned, NetSuite administrators certainly need to be familiar with Enable Features! But there are two other key groups of people who would want this information.\n\nFirst, NetSuite consultants should be confident with all the features NetSuite provides. This is because consultants need to provide their clients with accurate information about the features their companies would find beneficial. The second group of individuals who need to be familiar with the features in NetSuite is anyone aspiring to take the SuiteFoundation certification. A section of the SuiteFoundation exam includes questions about the function of some features. So whether you’re a NetSuite administrator, NetSuite consultant, or an aspiring SuiteFoundation-certified individual, you need to have a good grasp of these features.\n\nOne way to learn these features is simply to click through all the tabs in Enable Features and read the field help details on each feature. But reviewing these features is much easier said than done! There are over two hundred specific features. So in this article, we’ll just hit some of the key features under each of the subtabs to give you a broad overview. Generally, the name of each feature is self-explanatory. But if you do come across a feature mentioned here that doesn’t make sense to you just from the name, be sure to look it up in its respective section in Enable Features so you can learn more about it there.\n\nNetSuite Enable Features Subtabs\n\nLet’s dive into the ten subtabs in Enable Features, starting with the Company subtab.\n\nCompany\n\nThe company subtab includes a variety of features that apply to the company in general. For example, it includes three ways to track activity—by departments, by locations, and by classes. It also includes features that relate to specific projects. Two key features in this section are Projects, which tracks projects for customers, and Project Management, which tracks projects for the company apart from what is going on with the customer records. The ERP General section includes features like Multiple Units of Measure, Use Deletion Reason, and Multi-Subsidiary Customer. If your company has international subsidiaries, then the International section—with the features Multi-Language, Multiple Currencies, Currency Exchange Rate Integration, and Worldwide Support for Phone Number Formatting—provides important functions for keeping the information in your subsidiaries unified. The Data Management section, with features like Inline Editing, File Cabinet, and Duplicate Detection & Merge, enables you to update and organize data efficiently.\n\nAccounting\n\nNext up, we have the Accounting subtab, which includes three sections: Basic Features, Advanced Features, and Multi-Book Accounting. The Basic Features are arguably the most important, and most companies will have all of them enabled. The first of the accounting features is simply called “Accounting.” This feature would be a good place to start if you plan on doing any accounting in your NetSuite account! This section also includes features like Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable, as well as Accounting Periods and GL Audit Numbering. The Advanced Features delve into more involved aspects of accounting.\n\nTax\n\nThe Tax section has only two features: Advanced Taxes and EU One Stop Shop. Advanced Taxes tracks taxes in your company and makes use of tax schedules. The EU One Stop Shop, as NetSuite describes it, is needed for EU B2B distance sales.\n\nTransactions\n\nThe Transactions subtab, with nearly forty different features listed, has the most features of any subtab. The five sections under Transactions are Basic Features, Sales, Shipping & Receiving, Billing, and Payment Processing. Most of the Basic Features include “create and track” functions for key types of transactions. For example, the Sales Orders feature creates and tracks customer sales orders, the Purchase Orders feature creates and tracks purchase orders, and the Requisitions feature creates and tracks requisitions. Sales includes things like Multiple Prices (supporting multiple prices for a single item), Gross Profit (tracking the gross profit on items), and Promotion Codes (enabling customers to use coupons). Some key features in the other three sections include things like Advanced Shipping, Shipping Label Integration, Advanced Receiving, Advanced Billing, Credit Card Payments, and Electronic Funds Transfer.\n\nItems & Inventory\n\nItems & Inventory (as the name suggests) has only two sections: Items and Inventory. One of the key features is Inventory; if you plan for NetSuite to track your inventory at all, you’ll want to enable this one! This feature includes anything in your inventory, whether those items are finished goods or parts. Some other key features include Inventory Count, Demand Planning, Available to Promise, Lot Tracking, and Multi-Location Inventory.\n\nEmployees\n\nThe Employees subtab includes a variety of features that help to organize employee information. This tab is divided into four sections: Payroll, Time & Expenses, Commissions, and Permissions. The largest of these sections is Time & Expenses. Some of the key features in this section are Expense Reports, Approval Routing, Purchase Requests, Time Tracking, Weekly Time Sheets, and Time Tracking for CRM. Some key features in the other sections include Paycheck Journal, Employee Commissions, and Global Permissions.\n\nCRM\n\nNext up is the CRM subtab. This tab has five sections: Basic Features, Sales, Support, Marketing, and Partners. The Basic Features section has the feature Customer Relationship Management, which enables you to manage everything related to customers, from your calendar and contacts to events and tasks. This feature is perhaps the most important of all the CRM features! Other Basic Features include Sales Force Automation, Customer Support and Service, and Marketing Automation. The Sales section includes features that cover every aspect of the sales process, from Opportunities and Lead Conversion to Advanced Forecasting. The Support section includes customer service types of features, like Email Case Capture (converting emails directly into cases) and Knowledge Base (building FAQs), while the Marketing section supports all your marketing endeavors through features like Online Forms, Mail Merge, Capture Email Replies, and Sales Campaigns. Finally, the Partners section contains key features like Partner Relationship Management, Partner Commissions/Royalties, and Multi-Partner Management.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe Analytics subtab, though it has only a few features compared to most of the other subtabs, is invaluable for providing visibility on the information gathered by many of the features under other subtabs. For example, the KPI Scorecards feature enables you to place customized KPI scorecards on your dashboard. Another helpful feature is the SuiteAnalytics Workbook which, as NetSuite describes it, “enables you to query, explore, and visualize your NetSuite data.”\n\nWeb Presence\n\nThe Web Presence subtab has only three sections: Web Site, Publishing, and Access. The Web Site section includes a wide variety of features that help to manage and organize information that comes through a company’s website. The most basic of these features is simply called Website. If you use NetSuite and have a website—you probably want to turn on this feature! This section also includes two Site Builder features: one for a website and the other for a webstore. Other helpful features include things like Advanced Site Customization, Advanced Web Search, Descriptive URLs, and Customizable Checkout Subdomains. The Publishing section contains features like Host HTML Files and Intranet, while the Access section allows you to give different groups access to specific records or pages in your NetSuite instance that would be relevant for them. Some of the features in this section are Customer Access, Vendor Access, and Partner Access.\n\nSuiteCloud\n\nThe final subtab under Enable Features is SuiteCloud. The sections under this subtab were all specially developed by NetSuite for NetSuite. These include SuiteBuilder, SuiteScript, SuiteFlow, SuiteGL, SuiteBundler, SuiteTalk, and SuiteCloud Development Framework. These features are all integral to how NetSuite functions.\n\nNetSuite Enable Features Complexities\n\nBefore we step away from Enable Features in NetSuite, it’s helpful to understand some complexities that these features have. For many of these features, administrators can toggle them on and off depending on their company’s fluctuating needs. But some of these features are not so easily turned on or off, for a handful of different reasons. First, some features are “prerequisites” for other features. In other words, you may not have the freedom to turn a certain feature on without first turning on the one or two other features that help to support it. Second, some features require additional steps in order to be used. Third, some features have multiple steps you would need to take in order to disable them. And finally, some features cannot be disabled at all once you have turned on and used them in NetSuite.\n\nFeatures that Require Other Features\n\nThe following chart breaks down the various prerequisites. If you are interested in learning more about what each of these features does, check out the Field Help in NetSuite on each feature or search the features in SuiteAnswers. In the chart, “parent” features are the ones that are needed to support other features, while the features that they support are the “child” features."
