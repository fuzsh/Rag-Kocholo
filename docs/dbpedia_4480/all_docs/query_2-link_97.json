        "text": "Oracle NetSuite CRM Features\n\nThere are numerous CRM features to consider when choosing the right platform for your business. As part of the larger Oracle NetSuite platform, NetSuite CRM goes beyond essential features to offer significantly more functionality than many CRMs we reviewed.\n\nERP Functionality\n\nOracle NetSuite’s ERP functionality impressed us. Sales management doesn’t end once you’ve successfully converted leads to customers, which is why it’s so valuable that Oracle NetSuite CRM works in perfect harmony with the vendor’s ERP product. This connection allows businesses to follow the entire customer life cycle, manage financial information, process orders, track inventory and optimize supply chains. Not all CRMs offer this level of visibility on the whole customer journey.\n\nWe especially recommend this CRM for e-commerce businesses that need visibility into purchasing processes and detailed customer information without integrating external tools.\n\nTipBottom line\n\nThe NetSuite ERP is used in more than 200 countries and supports 27 languages and 190 currencies – a bonus if your business plans to expand internationally.\n\nSupport tickets include all the information necessary to address and resolve customer issues. Source: Oracle NetSuite\n\nSales Forecasting\n\nWe were pleased to see the depth of NetSuite CRM’s sales-forecasting tools, which give teams the best chance of success in a competitive environment.\n\nCalculated forecasts examine customer data to determine close probabilities, weighted and projected opportunity amounts, and quotes using data in the sales pipeline. You can use “mood ring” forecasts for general predictions that aren’t tied to a particular quote or opportunity and compare multiple forecasts to gauge the overall accuracy of predictions.\n\nTipBottom line\n\nFor another CRM with an advanced sales forecasting tool, see our review of HubSpot CRM.\n\nOracle NetSuite provides sales forecasting using pipeline data. Source: Oracle NetSuite\n\nConfigure, Price, Quote Functionality\n\nMany CRM platforms are adding CPQ functionality. (Read our Freshworks CRM review to see how this vendor incorporates CPQ features.) We were very impressed by NetSuite CRM’s CPQ execution and found it superb.\n\nPricing products and services with various customization options is challenging. We like that NetSuite CRM’s CPQ provides a guided selling feature that helps sales teams understand customers’ needs; the system then recommends the right products or services for them. This clever feature reduces the risk of poor product recommendations, increasing the chances of a sale.\n\nWe also like that reps benefit from real-time pricing. NetSuite monitors all the costs that go into a quote, including shipping, labor and materials. The quote changes automatically if a cost changes. The system can also cope with different pricing strategies, including volume discounts, promotional discounts and regional pricing differences.\n\nWe appreciate how the system handles contracts, subscriptions and renewals with its profit-based intelligent deal-management feature.\n\nThe Oracle NetSuite CPQ module helps reduce the risk of poor product recommendations, increasing the chances of a sale. Source: Oracle NetSuite\n\nUpsell Recommendations\n\nWe were pleased to see that NetSuite CRM includes a built-in upsell manager. It analyzes buying patterns and other CRM metrics to suggest upselling and cross-selling opportunities, recommended items or categories. The system can also:\n\nCreate segmented lists of customers who meet specific criteria\n\nGlean potential opportunities from existing customer records and transactions\n\nCreate task records\n\nSchedule phone calls for teams or individual reps\n\nCommission Management\n\nWe really like Oracle NetSuite’s incentive program-management tools. You can measure your sales reps’ performance in various ways, such as by quotas, quantity sold, total sales, profitability or custom criteria. Use data analytics to forecast commission earnings, split commissions between agents and process payments – all without leaving the CRM environment.\n\nWe appreciate how the system manages payments to third parties like partners, resellers and vendors. For larger companies – where a high proportion of revenues come from these sources – the commission-management function can streamline a complicated process. With the correct configuration, you may even be able to launch a self-billing program.\n\nPartner Relationship Management Program\n\nNetSuite’s partner relationship management (PRM) program is another unique feature we liked.\n\nMany larger companies offer marketing and promotional funds to third parties. NetSuite’s PRM program can manage marketing initiatives, lead management, sales forecasting and order processing when a strategic partner is involved. On joint advertising campaigns, the system allows all parties to see the same conversion data, providing important information that can improve returns from future joint campaigns.\n\nFor greater transparency, you can give your partners PRM logins to track lead progress.\n\nThis business transparency increases trust and reduces the workload on team members tasked with giving partners frequent lead updates.\n\nThe PRM module works with all third-party partnerships. However, NetSuite has particular experience in providing solutions for manufacturing, software, services, advertising, media, publishing, nonprofit and wholesale distribution firms.\n\nMobile App\n\nWe were pleased to see that NetSuite offers mobile apps for iOS and Android to help field reps and remote workers enjoy many of the same productivity and employee collaboration features as on-site desktop users.\n\nDashboard synchronization provides real-time visibility of contact records, KPIs, lead-scoring scorecards and other vital data to help your agents execute sales strategies. They can check calendar reminders, log calls and send quotes while on the go.\n\nUnlike other CRMs we reviewed, the NetSuite CRM mobile app also allows employees to submit timesheets and track receipts to log expenses when they occur. Users can also access a mobile browser version of the desktop app for additional functionality.\n\nOracle NetSuite’s mobile apps help sales reps track their expenses. Source: Oracle NetSuite\n\nReporting and Analytics\n\nWe found Oracle NetSuite CRM’s reporting and analytics features to be on par with those of its competitors. The platform monitors various metrics across sales, marketing and customer support teams, such as call volume, call resolution times, customer buying trends, acquisition costs and subscription renewals. Various customizable CRM reports offer insight and analysis on important sales efforts and KPIs like lead-to-close times, lead generation patterns, website visitor activity and customer satisfaction. You can also zoom in on individual, team or territory performance and review predictive versus actual data for sales pipeline and sales funnel stages and quota fulfillment.\n\nE-Commerce Customer Portal\n\nWe were impressed by NetSuite’s personalized web portal, which provides 24/7 access to customers’ order histories and lets you check order status and place new orders. Customers can also visit your self-service knowledge-management system to resolve issues or open a support ticket. They’ll automatically receive confirmation of the service request and a case number.\n\nWe appreciate how Oracle has created separate customer portal versions for B2B and B2C e-commerce businesses. Both benefit from single-view customizability and connections; however, the B2C offering features social network integration, and the B2B version includes quoting and billing processes."
