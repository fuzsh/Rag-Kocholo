This integration allows PagerDuty Workflow Automation to look up, create and edit customer and account information inside Netsuite.\n\nIntegrations can only be set up by Admin users and are enabled per team.

This requires configuration from an admin within Netsuite.\n\nOnce you have the consumer Realm, secret, and other fields, fill out the secure Netsuite Credential Submission form. Weâll contact you once the integration is ready to use.\n\nThis data is used to authenticate a secure connection between Netsuite and PagerDuty Workflow Automation. This is a standard authentication method between modern applications.\n\nHow to create the consumer Realm\n\nGet your NetSuite account ID.\n\nGo to Setup > Integration > Web Services Preferences.\n\nThe Account ID is the consumer Realm.\n\nHow to create the consumer Key and Secret\n\nEnable token-based authentication\n\nGo to Setup > Company > Enable Features.\n\nIn the sub-navigation menu, select SuiteCloud and scroll down to Manage Authentication.\n\nEnable token-based authentication, agree to the terms of service, and select save.\n\nCreate a new role\n\nGo to Setup > Users/Roles > Manage Roles > New.\n\nView the Permissions section at the bottom of the page.
