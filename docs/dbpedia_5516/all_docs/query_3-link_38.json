        "text": "MEMORANDUM\n\nThe issues in this diversity case are (1) whether Figueroa's claims of battery, clergy malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence are barred by the Hawaii statute of limitations, and (2) whether Figueroa's defamation claim fails because the alleged defamatory statements were privileged and the speaker did not speak with malice.\n\nThe district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court's jurisdiction was based upon 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332. We have jurisdiction over Figueroa's timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291.\n\nWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo. T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 629 (9th Cir. 1987). Essentially, we affirm for the reasons expressed in the order of the district court.\n\nFigueroa's claim was not filed until 1991, although the alleged sexual abuse ended in 1982. To survive Hawaii's two-year statute of limitations, Haw.Rev.Stat. ยง 657-7, Figueroa urges application of the discovery rule, under which a cause of action does not accrue until the party \"discovers or should have discovered the negligent act, the damage, and the causal connection between\" the two. See Yamaguchi v. Queen's Medical Ctr., 648 P.2d 689, 693-94 (Hawaii 1982); see also Carvalho v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 794 F.2d 454, 456 (9th Cir. 1986) (construing Hawaii law and applying discovery rule to Haw.Rev.Stat. ยง 657-7 in asbestosis claim).\n\nHawaii case law indicates that Hawaii would extend the discovery rule to cases of sexual abuse. However, Figueroa's February 27, 1986, letter to the archbishop detailing his accusations against the defendants and the harm caused to him evidences the discovery that marks the commencement date for the statute of limitations. Figueroa's subsequent affidavit does not establish otherwise.\n\nThe district court properly held that Figueroa's non-defamation claims were barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nFigueroa claims that Ferrario defamed him and exceeded the scope of his qualified privilege to respond to the accusations in order to protect his reputation. Figueroa concedes that the privilege extended to denial of the allegations, but that Ferrario exceeded the scope of the privilege by excessive publication that Figueroa's accusations were untrue. The bishop's denials of the accusations were within the scope of the qualified privilege. The bishop published his denials on a scale comparable to the plaintiff's accusations. No material issue of fact existed on this issue."
