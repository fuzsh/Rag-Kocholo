        "text": "King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma\n\nImages: Hawai'i State Archives, call # PP-97-8-011 and PP-96-4-009\n\nIn 1862, following a request from King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma to the Church of England, the first Anglican bishop and priests arrived to establish the Diocese of Honolulu.\n\n\"I may mention a very interesting fact, in connection with the subject, that your Majesty is the first independent sovereign who has invited an English Church Establishment into his dominions.\"\n\nManley Hopkins to King Kamehameha IV, 9 March 1860, Box 1, Folder 3, MS 127 Manley Hopkins Letters to Kamehameha IV 1858 - 1862, Bishop Museum Archives.\n\nFor more about King Kamehameha IV click here.\n\nFor more about Queen Emma click here.\n\nAppointed the first Bishop for the missionary district of Honolulu in December 1861, Thomas Nettleship Staley arrived in October 1862 sent by the English Church in response to requests from King Kamehameha IV to establish a mission in his kingdom. He formed the Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church (later the Anglican Church of Hawai'i).\n\nIn 1863, Bishop Staley, Archdeacon George Mason, and Rev. Edmund Ibbotson, with the patronage of the King and Queen, established St. Alban's College ('Iolani School).\n\nTimeline:\n\nOctober through December 1862, missionaries arrived, founded the church in the islands, and prepared to open the school.\n\n10/11/1862 - Bishop Thomas N. Staley, Archdeacon George Mason, Rev. Edmund Ibbotson arrive. Rev. William R. Scott arrives soon after.\n\n10/12/1862 - First service in the Hawaiian Kingdom\n\n10/25/1862 - Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church charter accepted at the courthouse\n\n11/08/1862 - Notice in the Polynesian newspaper that a \"Collegiate Grammar School for Young Gentlemen\" would be opening soon.\n\n11/09/2024 - First Hawaiian language service.\n\n12/14/1862 - First service in Lahaina, Maui\n\n12/27/1862 - Polynesian newspaper announcement that school will start January 12, 1863 at the Parsonage House, Kukui Street (behind the temporary cathedral; temporary; Mason residence; beginning of St. Alban's College). \"The Warden will receive a limited number of boarders.\"\n\nSummer 1863 - Rev. Scott establishes an English day school for boys in Lahaina, Maui\n\nBishop Thomas Nettleship Staley\n\n(Bishop of Honolulu 1861- 1870)\n\nAppointed first Bishop for the missionary district of Honolulu in December 1861. Staley arrived in October 1862, sent by the English Church in response to requests from King Kamehameha IV to establish a mission in his kingdom. He formed the Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church (later the Anglican Church of Hawai'i).\n\nIn 1863, Bishop Staley, Archdeacon George Mason, and Rev. Edmund Ibbotson, with the patronage of the King and Queen, established St. Alban's College ('Iolani School).\n\nFor more about Bishop Staley click here.\n\nMany changes have taken place in the long history of the school; including name changes:\n\nSt. Alban's College\n\nLahainalalo or Luaehu College (in Lahaina)\n\nIolani College (also known as Bishop's College School)\n\n'Iolani School\n\nConflicting Information\n\nIn materials reviewed, ‘Iolani as the school name has been attributed to both Queen Emma and King Kamehameha V.\n\nPrimary source documentation has yet to be explored in order to make the determination.\n\nKamehameha V is mentioned as naming the school in the\n\nHawaiian Church Chronicle, August 1930, page 3:\n\n\"On an official visit to the school, Kamehameha V gave it the name of Iolani.\"\n\nand the issue of conflicting information is shown when reprinting memories of early student James H. Boyd in the\n\nHawaiian Church Chronicle, December 1930, page 12:\n\n\"Very soon, however, Mr. Mason leased the Booth premises in Pauoa, and the school was transferred to that place. A new building was immediately put up and duly inaugurated, Queen Emma giving it the name of Iolani School.\n\n(Note- The late Pierre Jones told Bishop Restarick that Kamehameha V gave Iolani its name.)\"\n\nThe mentioned Pierre Jones is a past head of school, school year 1873/74 - 1887/88.\n\nSource: Andrews, Lorrin.

He played a crucial role in establishing the school and was the first Warden.\n\nThe 1862 newspaper article announcing opening of registration states that\n\n\"The Warden will receive a limited number of boarders.\n\nThe School will be conducted for the present at the Parsonage House.\"\n\nThe Parsonage House was the home of Mr. and Mrs. Mason. He also conducted early work at the Lahaina location and then returned to O‘ahu with the students to merge the two in March 1868.\n\nFor more about Rev. Mason click here.\n\nThis list, compiled from our sources in the Archives, is not definitive or all-inclusive; much of the early information is unavailable or unclear. Titles were used inconsistently and sometimes interchangeably.
