        "text": "Despite interest in the Church of England since Kamehameha I's (Pai'ea) interactions with Captain George Vancouver (1792 - 1794), there was still no presence of that church in the Hawaiian Kingdom when King Kamehameha IV (Alexander Liholiho 'Iolani) ascended the throne in 1855.\n\nInstead, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) began their presence and influence in the islands in 1820 through Congregationalist and Presbyterian missionaries. Although other religious denominations also came to have a presence in the Kingdom, American Congregationalists exerted primary influence over local religion and politics.\n\nKing Kamehameha IV, having traveled to England and the United States, preferred the customs and teachings of the English Church as did his wife Queen Emma (Emma Kalanikaumakaʻamano Kaleleonālani Naʻea Rooke). Upon being blessed with child, and desiring young Prince Albert Edward Kauikeaouli Leiopapa a Kamehameha to be educated in the ways on the Church of England, the King and Queen requested that a mission be sent to their Kingdom.\n\nIn response to the request, Thomas Nettleship Staley was appointed the first Bishop of Honolulu.\n\nFirst, then, as regards the native population. We shall have to remind them of those Divine truths, which have been hitherto sadly overlooked in the system of Christianity familiar to them; that by His Incarnation the Son of God has made Himself one with them, entered into all their sufferings, temptations, and joys; that in Him all manly, all tender graces combine; that the more they grow into His image, the purer, the braver, the truer, the more loving will they become; that religion was never designed to make their innocent pleasures the less; that it is compatible with the free indulgence in all manly and athletic exercises, being not designed to crush their natural instincts, nor to form, as unhappily all admit it has hitherto done, a sort of crust around and external to their daily life, but rather to work with those instincts and hallow that daily life...\"\n\nBishop Thomas Nettleship Staley. \"The Waiting Isles,\" July 1862, Westminster Abbey, London, England.\n\nBishop Staley together with Archdeacon George Mason and Rev. Edmund Ibbotson, and their families, arrived in October 1862. They were greatly enthused by the Hawaiian Language translation of the Book of Common Prayer which King Kamehameha IV completed himself. In fact, they had utilized the time in voyage to study the language; also, soon after arrival, they began taking Hawaiian language lessons and offering Hawaiian language service.\n\n\"And we come in all love and good will to those who have been labouring [sic] here before us. However much we may conscientiously differ from them, we desire not to ignore the work which they have done to the best of their ability, nor withhold from them the credit they deserve. In turn we claim the same consideration and forbearance. There is the more need to ask this because in many important points our Church differs from the sects professing Protestant Christianity no less than from the Roman Church. And consequently there will be parts in her worship and teaching, which will seem strange to those who are only familiar with the former. At the Reformation she avoided the two extremes of a slavish adhesion to the existing order on the one hand, and of irreverence for Catholic antiquity and practice on the other.\"\n\n\"Surely Christianity is not all sourness, all taboo! God would have us use thankfully and in moderation all the gifts He has given us, not abstain from them altogether. This is true self restraint, this real temperance.\"\n\nBishop Thomas Nettleship Staley, \"Inaugural Sermon,\" October 1862, Honolulu, Hawai'i.\n\nAlexander Liholiho 'Iolani ascended the throne as King Kamehameha IV in 1855 and reigned until his death on November 30th, 1863. He and his wife, Queen Emma, preferred the religious teachings of the Church of England.\n\nWhen they had a child, Prince Albert, they desired him to be educated with those teachings as foundation. After several requests, the first Anglican bishop and priests arrived to establish a mission of the Church of England in October 1862.\n\n\"I may mention a very interesting fact, in connection with the subject, that your Majesty is the first independent sovereign who has invited an English Church Establishment into his dominions.\"\n\nManley Hopkins to King Kamehameha IV, 9 March 1860, Box 1, Folder 3, MS 127 Manley Hopkins Letters to Kamehameha IV 1858 - 1862, Bishop Museum Archives.\n\nUnfortunately, the four-year-old Prince Albert fell ill and died before the clergymen arrived, sending a nation into mourning.\n\nIn 1863, Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley and Archdeacon George Mason, with the patronage of King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma, began St. Alban's College. This is the beginning of what would become 'Iolani School. More about the history of 'Iolani School can be found at School History.\n\nOctober through December 1862, missionaries arrived, founded the church in the islands, and prepared to open the school.\n\n10/11/1862 - Bishop Thomas N. Staley, Archdeacon George Mason, Rev. Edmund Ibbotson arrive. Rev. William R. Scott arrives soon after.\n\n10/12/1862 - First service in the Hawaiian Kingdom\n\n10/25/1862 - Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church charter accepted at the courthouse\n\n11/08/1862 - Notice in the Polynesian newspaper that a \"Collegiate Grammar School for Young Gentlemen\" would be opening soon.\n\n11/09/2024 - First Hawaiian language service.\n\n12/14/1862 - First service in Lahaina, Maui\n\n12/27/1862 - Polynesian newspaper announcement that school will start January 12, 1863 at the Parsonage House, Kukui Street (behind the temporary cathedral; temporary; Mason residence; beginning of St. Alban's College). \"The Warden will receive a limited number of boarders.\"\n\nSummer 1863 - Rev. Scott establishes an English day school for boys in Lahaina, Maui"
