        "text": "The “Vestry” is a term in Anglicanism for the group in the local parish which, together with the Rector (the head pastor, which at All Saints is myself) is charged with the “secular” affairs of the church: everything from the stewardship of our resources to our insurances, all financial matters, governance questions, fiduciary concerns, safeguarding policies, vacation days, bylaws, canonical conformity, etc.… you get the idea.\n\nRead more\n\nIn film or television we often caricature “wisdom” by associating it with mystics, wizards; with wisened old crones who trace pentagrams with their fingers pointed to the stars, or scholars hovering over their libraries while beakers of glowing liquid boil in the background. And while I love most of the stories that contain these figures, these depictions do not quite capture the biblical idea. For “wisdom” or “a discerning heart” means more than mere fact-gathering, or esoteric knowledge —though it may appear like that at some moments.\n\nRead more\n\nSunday 7/14/24\n\nI depart Olivet Baptist Church during the chanting of the Creed (what a way to go out! I’m putting that in my notes for a good death: I’d like the Creed to be chanted over me as I lay dying) and head to the airport….\n\nRead more\n\nThere is, first, a kind of naivete —a not knowing innocence. Looking back on moments of naivete we often lend to them a happiness they did not actually possess, charged with nostalgia and sentimentality: “oh those were the good ole days when things were good” we say. And when we say this we imply a moment when things stopped being happy. The “when things were good” is followed by a “before [insert event] happened.”\n\nRead more\n\nI’ve been reflecting on a question posed to me late on Saturday evening by a member of the cast, the gist of which was whether I had been prepared for the overwhelming sinfulness of Vegas —the word used in the question was “sexiness.” I couldn’t help laughing, kindly I hope, at the question. I knew what he meant but had trouble articulating my answer. For I wanted to answer with a question that ran something like, “What sexiness?”\n\nRead more\n\nThursday morning started with a bilingual eucharist led by the Rt. Rev. Tito Zavala, an Anglican bishop in Chile (and, as a fun fact, his son spent a season at CtF a few years back). It was English/Spanish. I could not stop thinking and praying for our own Kassandra Dempsey’s story and my wife’s history in the Dominican.\n\nRead more\n\nDcn. Chris encouraged me to send two “missives” out to the parish during my travel this week. But first, we must inquire, “What is this ‘missive’ of which Dcn. Chris speaks?” Good question. It’s a fancy term for an official report or communication. Want a living example of a missive? Good news, I just wrote one –to you! Keep reading…\n\nRead more\n\nThere’s gonna be a new archbishop of the ACNA? How does that happen? Can they re-elect the current one? Who elects? Who’s eligible? Is this like the selection of the pope?\n\nAll good questions. This is a quick orientation —far more like a sketch made on a napkin in crayon than a detailed account in clean typeset.\n\nRead more\n\nThis summer we’re preaching through the Psalter. At the outset of the series, I sent our preaching team a brief set of notes laying-out some general rules for how to preach the Psalms.\n\nThe problem is this, ours is not a widely poetically literate culture. Poetry has become, in the past century, so abstract and so experimental that it has left us with very little in the way of ability to follow things like rhythm, meter, poetic structure, etc. The irony is that these are not at all hard or complex things to follow —they are actually very simply and, as Dana Gioia once reminded us, we are designed by God to follow them (the same way that bees are designed to follow ‘dance patterns’ to follow the trail to nectar). We ‘get’ poetry when it comes to us in the form of hip-hop, rap, or country music, but we get all clammy and confused when the Bible speaks in a poetic form.\n\nRead more\n\nOur dear brother James Mueller preached this past Sunday on our value of “mission.” His sermon concludes our series in which we have been preaching through our 5 key values. You can read all of them here.\n\nWhat I’d like to do now is to offer a few notes, expanding and exploring points brought-up by James on this theme:\n\nRead more"
