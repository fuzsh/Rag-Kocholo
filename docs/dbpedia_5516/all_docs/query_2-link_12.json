        "text": "Home\n\n>\n\nDiocesan Offices\n\n>\n\nSafe Environment - Child and Youth Protection\n\n>\n\nReporting Abuse\n\n>\n\nReporting Abuse\n\nStep 1 - Contacting Public Authorities\n\nIf an allegation involves a violation of Hawaii criminal law such as abuse of a minor (in any form whether or not sexual), the police or Hawaii Department of Human Services/Child Welfare Services are to be contacted immediately in accordance with the law of the State of Hawaii (H.R.S. ยง 350 - 1.3).\n\nPhone Numbers (subject to change):\n\nFrom Oahu, call (808) 832-5300\n\nFrom a Neighbor Island or Out of State, call 1-800-380-3088\n\n(OR) call 911\n\nProvide the following information:\n\nName of minor\n\nPresent location of minor\n\nNature and extent of the perceived injury\n\nAny other information, including that which led the individual to suspect child abuse, requested by the child welfare agency\n\nAfter the verbal report is made, a Child Welfare Service employee or police officer will usually be dispatched to the site.\n\nFollow-Up:\n\nFollowing the telephone report, a written report (CONFIDENTIAL Mandated Reporter Checklist for Suspected Abuse and Neglect) must also be filed in accordance with regulations of the Hawaii State Department of Human Services/Child Welfare Service. The Mandated Reporter Checklist and accompanying Mandated Reporter Guide are available for download on the State of Hawaii Department of Human Services website at https://humanservices.hawaii.gov/ssd/home/child-welfare-services.\n\nA copy of the report should not be made a part of any minor's record. However, a notation in the cumulative record indicating \"CWS report filed\" (with date) would be appropriate. One (1) copy of the report may be kept in a confidential file or log by the administration, but not in the minor's folder.\n\nFollow-up with the family is the responsibility of the Child Welfare Service.\n\nStep 2 - Reporting to the Bishop\n\nAfter public authorities have been contacted, all allegations of sexual misconduct involving minors, including but not limited to suspected abuse involving any individual working or volunteering on behalf of the diocese, must promptly be reported to the parish pastor/administrator and/or school principal, and to the Office of the Bishop.\n\nIf parish pastors/administrators, school principals or other supervisors first receive the allegation, they shall promptly forward the matter to the Office of the Bishop for handling, including such evaluation and investigation as the Office of the Bishop deems appropriate. Such reports are in addition to and not in place of mandated reporting to appropriate public officials.\n\nContact the Office of the Bishop at (808) 585-3356 or bishop@rcchawaii.org.\n\nNOTE: Responsibility for notifying public authorities when the allegation involves a violation of Hawaii criminal law is that of the individual making the initial complaint. If the person making the initial complaint fails to contact the public authorities, then the parish pastor/administrator, school principal or supervisor who first learns of the allegation must do so. If that person fails to contact public authorities, then the Office of the Bishop will do so. It is the role of the public authorities to assess the credibility of allegations received. All allegations should be reported to them for handling.\n\nCATHOLIC BISHOP ABUSE REPORTING SERVICE"
