        "text": "The Hawaii Catholic schools office, which supervises three dozen Roman Catholic private schools in the state, has just approved a new contract that says teachers can be fired if they engage in homosexual activity or marry someone of the same sex. The contract goes on to list a wide array of actions and behaviors that would justify termination.\n\nAmong the other acts that could justify firing, according to the contract, are abortion, in vitro fertilization or “unmarried cohabitation.”\n\n“The school expressly reserves the right to terminate the employment of any Teacher, who by word or example, denies the teachings or authority of the Church, or whose personal life or conduct is, based on Catholic teaching, immoral,” says a portion of the contract that was obtained by Civil Beat.\n\nThe contract, which is called the “Standard Teacher Employment Agreement,” is for full- and part-time teachers who must sign every year they work.\n\nThe contract explicitly says that “homosexual activity” and “same sex unions” are not permitted.\n\nThe contract is slated to go into effect for the 2014-15 school year.\n\nSchools have not yet distributed the contracts to teachers, but the documents will apply to all teachers working in parochial schools operated by the Diocese of Honolulu, which covers the entire state. A few private Catholic schools are not parochial schools.\n\nMichael Rockers, the superintendent of all Hawaii Roman Catholic schools, said the written provision is new but that the expectations outlined in it are not.\n\nRockers said Catholic schools are “ministries” where administrators have “the right and responsibility to … support our teachers in their ministerial responsibilities as defined by Catholic doctrine.”\n\nThe superintendent explained that teachers “don’t have a final say in what the contract’s exact wording is.”\n\nHe said the ultimate goal is to provide positive role models for students and that if a teacher’s homosexuality were made public it would negatively affect the children.\n\n“We want to be authentic about what our moral teaching is,” he said. “We’re trying to be pastoral about this and centered on what’s best for the students.”\n\nRockers said the written provision was not a response to last year’s legalization of same-sex marriage in Hawaii.\n\nThe Legislature legalized same-sex marriage in Hawaii in a special session last November following weeks of heated testimony and passionate debates that exposed how divided the state was on the issue.\n\nUPDATE\n\nThe Hawaii ACLU noted that Catholic schools would lose their freedom to enforce elements of the new contract if they are even partly supported by taxpayer dollars.\n\n“If a religious school is truly private and accepts no public funds, then the school may establish hiring and admission protocols consistent with its faith. Private religious institutions may exclude anyone they wish,” said Vanessa Chong, the ACLU’s executive director in Hawaii.\n\n“However, if a school accepts any government funds at all, then state and federal non-discrimination protections would apply.”\n\nThe issue of Catholic discrimination against homosexuals flared last year in the run-up to the special session on gay marriage at the Legislature.\n\nHonolulu Bishop Larry Silva, who has been vocal in his opposition to homosexuality, disseminated a three-page letter to Catholics last year that condoned discrimination against gays who wanted to marry. One of his arguments against gay marriage is that it leads to youth suicides.\n\nCivil Beat looked into that claim in a Fact Check and found it to be false.\n\nPatrick Downes, spokesman for the Diocese of Honolulu, declined to comment on Thursday afternoon. He explained that he wasn’t even aware of the contract’s provision.\n\nCatholic schools that aren’t subject to the contract include St. Louis and Sacred Hearts in Honolulu."
