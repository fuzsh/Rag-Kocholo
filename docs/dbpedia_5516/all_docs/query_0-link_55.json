This document discusses the structure and hierarchy of the Catholic Church. It explains that a diocese is a district under the supervision of a bishop, who oversees parishes. An archdiocese is overseen by an archbishop and has authority over other bishops and dioceses. It also describes apostolic vicariates, which are missionary territories not yet established as dioceses, and are led by a vicar apostolic. Finally, it briefly discusses the roles of the Pope, nuncios, and chaplains within the Catholic Church system.",
