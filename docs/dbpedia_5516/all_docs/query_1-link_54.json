        "text": "The Book of Common Prayer (Hawaiian)\n\nFor the authorized translations of the Eucharistic Prayers and supporting material into ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi, click HERE.\n\n(Note: The translated Holy Eucharist is from the Book of Common Prayer 1979.)\n\nHawaiian is a Polynesian language closely related to Tahitian, Maori, etc., and is, as the name implies, spoken primarily in the U. S. state of Hawaii. It is an official language of Hawaii, and, according to the US Census, is today spoken by over 25,000 people.\n\nAnglican presence in the Hawaiian Islands essentially started in 1861, when King Kamehameha IV invited the Church of England to send missionaries. Accordingly, Thomas Staley was consecrated bishop in London and sent to Honolulu in 1862. Prior to this, the islands did have a long missionary presence, primarily from American Congregationalists and French Catholics, and most of the native Hawaiians had been converted to Christianity. The King himself had been educated by Congregationalist missionaries, but, after a trip to Britain, became more enamored of the Anglican Church. It may be assumed that missionary activity by the three nations (Britain, France and the U. S.) was often closely tied to attempts to gain political influence in the country. The Anglican Church in Hawaii remained under control of the Church of England until the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands by the United States in 1898. The Church was then transferred to the jurisdiction of the U. S. Episcopal Church in 1902, and has remained so ever since."
