It falls under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Honolulu and its bishop; it is staffed by the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.\n\nFounded in 1854, it was the third parish church established in the fledgling Hawaii Catholic Church, which was beginning to grow after a period of persecution in the 1830s. Today, it is a modern beacon in Waikiki with its striking neo-Gothic architecture and its dramatic stained glass.\n\nThe parish campus is the home of the Damien and Marianne of Molokai Heritage Museum which houses several relics of Saint Damien of Molokai and related historical artifacts. A 20-minute video is shown about Father Damien and his work with Kalaupapa leprosy settlement. The museum is in front of the Church in the ABC Building on the second floor. No admission fee, free-will offerings appreciated. Opening Hours: Monday-Thursday 9:00 am – 3:00 pm; Friday 9:00 am- 12 noon; Saturday 9:00 am- 12 noon, 4:00 pm-7:00 pm; Sunday 7:00 am- 12 noon; Closed all holidays.\n\nThe current clerics of the parish include Father Lane K. Akiona, SS.CC., pastor, and Rev. Benny Kosasih ss.cc, parochial vicar.\n\nSources: (visit link) and (visit link)\n\nType of Church: ChurchStatus of Building: Actively in use for worshipDate of organization: 01/01/1854Date of building construction: 08/16/1962Dominant Architectural Style: Neo-Gothic architectureAssociated Shrines, Art, etc.: Dramatic stained glass, Damien Museum which houses several relics of Saint Damien of Molokai and related historical artifactsDiocese: Diocese of HonoluluAddress/Location:\n\n130 Ohua Ave,\n\nHonolulu, HI, US\n\n96815Relvant Web Site: [Web Link]Archdiocese: Not listed\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nTo log a visit to this waymark, you must post at least one original photo of the site, give the date and a brief description of your visit.\n\nSearch for...\n\nGeocaching.com Google Map\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nMapQuest\n\nBing Maps\n\nNearest Waymarks\n\nNearest Roman Catholic Churches\n\nNearest Geocaches\n\nCreate a scavenger hunt using this waymark as the center point"
