        "text": "This compilation is a companion to the Cardinal Newman Society’s analysis, Faith and Morals Language in Catholic School Teacher Employment Documents: Best Practices Brief. It provides additional source material for the reader to consider when researching and reviewing faith and morals clauses in diocesan employment documents for Catholic school teachers.\n\nDiocesan policies and statements regarding teachers were collected in the second quarter of 2015 primarily from documents publicly available on the Internet, and in some cases by direct contact with a diocese. This compilation reflects materials from more than 125 dioceses. If a diocese is not included in this sample, it does not necessarily mean that the diocese does not address faith and moral issues in its employment documents, but only reflects our inability to obtain such documents. An additional thirty-four dioceses, not represented in this compilation, have faith and morals statements referenced in their “Safe Environment” policies. As these are relatively generic statements clarifying that employees and volunteers must reflect Catholic teaching and morality in their work and in their interactions with others, only a few examples of this type are presented. Those dioceses that are not fully represented in this compilation, have revised the cited documents, or have created new documents are invited to share their corrections, updates, or additions by contacting ddonohue@newmansociety.org.\n\nThe following excerpts have been taken from longer documents and formatted for consistency. Because referenced documents are likely to change over time, direct contact with a diocese is the only way to ensure up-to-date accuracy.\n\nThe Cardinal Newman Society’s researchers are currently using this collection in forthcoming research on this topic. The hope is that by making this raw, compiled data readily available to Church officials, it might prove helpful for them as they evaluate their own practices. This document is not presented as legal advice. Catholic school leaders are encouraged to speak with each other and with their attorneys about their approaches to critical employment issues. As a corollary to this piece, the Newman Society has published a comprehensive overview of the Magisterium’s expectations of its Catholic teachers, The Call to Teach: Expectations for Catholic Educators in Magisterial Teaching.\n\nThe sections herein mirror the section dividers for the companion piece, Faith and Morals Language in Catholic School Teacher Employment Documents: Best Practices Brief, as follows:\n\nPre-Application and Application Statements\n\nStand-Alone Faith and Morality Documents\n\nBishops’ Statements Incorporated into Employment Agreements\n\nMorality Statements\n\nWitness Statements\n\nBelief Statements/Oaths\n\nContract and Handbook Language\n\nGeneric Morals Clause Language: Positive and Negative\n\nSpecific Language within Employment Documents\n\nAddendums\n\nHandbook-based policies\n\nDescription of Teachers as “Ministers” and Ministry Clauses\n\nSafe Environment Documents\n\nPre-Application and Application Statements\n\nDiocese of Arlington Application Attestation The Catholic Diocese of Arlington, an equal opportunity employer, does not—because of race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, age, sex, martial status, national origin, physical or mental disability or handicap, or veteran status—fail or refuse to hire qualified applicants. The Diocese reserves the right, however, to determine whether and under what circumstances priority should be given to Catholics for certain employment positions. In addition, for Catholic employees, conformance with religious tenets of the Catholic faith is a condition of employment, and all employees are prohibited from performing, teaching, or advocating any practices or doctrines which are inconsistent with religious tenets of the Catholic faith.\n\nDiocese of Evansville Teacher Application\n\nPlease read carefully: The Catholic Diocese of Evansville is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate or deny services on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age. Because of their participation in teaching the religious precepts of the Catholic Church and duty to serve as role models for their students, teachers in the schools of the Catholic Diocese of Evansville are required to maintain a lifestyle, including marital status, in harmony with the teachings of the faith of the Catholic Church. For example, if an applicant for a teaching position is living in a marriage that is not recognized as valid according to the law of the Church, that applicant will not be hired before the prior marriage has been declare null or dissolved so that the present marriage can be validated in accord with Church law. These provisions also apply to one’s present spouse. If a teacher already employed by the Diocese attempts a marriage or enters a lifestyle that cannot be recognized as valid according to Church law, he or she will be terminated. Teachers are expected by their actions to be a Catholic example to students including demonstrating their faith as practicing Catholic (which includes regular Catholic Church attendance). Catholic teachers, who renounce by their word or acts the teachings of the Catholic Church (including, for example, becoming a member of another church) will be subject to termination for cause or non-renewal of contract for the next school year. The requirement that a teacher’s marital status be in harmony with the teaching and faith of the Church applies to non-Catholic as well as Catholic. The Church recognizes a first marriage of two persons who are not Catholic and the presumption of validity applies to the first marriage until the contrary is proven. The prior valid bond is a natural law impediment and would render a subsequent marriage invalid according to the law of the Catholic Church.\n\nDiocese of Ogdensburg Application Attestation\n\nI recognize that this position involves ministry in the Roman Catholic Church and requires me to proclaim the Gospel and the authentic teaching of the Roman Catholic Church. This ministry and proclamation requires my own faithful witness to the Gospel and teachings of the Church. In particular, I understand and accept that by my own example and lifestyle I must be faithful to the Church’s teachings. Accordingly, I promise to fulfill the functions of the position faithfully according to the manner determined by law, Diocesan policy or by the Bishop and to model my own life according to the Gospel and teachings of the Church. Specifically, I uphold and will continue to affirm the Church’s teaching that God’s gift of sexuality is sacred and finds its proper context within the Sacrament of Marriage, as defined by Gospel and the Roman Catholic Church as being a union between one man and one woman.\n\nDiocese of Orange Teacher Application\n\nEvery Catholic School teacher or principal is expected to be a strong faith witness and a teacher of the Catholic tradition. It is expected that they conduct themselves in a manner that reflects a strong commitment to the mission of Jesus Christ and to the Diocese of Orange. It is required that every teacher or principal obtains and maintains certification as a catechist through the Institute for Pastoral Ministry sponsored by the Diocese. If certification is not been obtained prior to employment, it must be completed within three years.\n\nDiocese of Sacramento\n\nEmployment/Ministry in the Church Pre-Application Statement\n\n“Go out to the whole world and proclaim the Good News to all creation.”\n\n(Mark 16:15)\n\nMission Statement of the Diocese of Sacramento\n\nWe, the People of God of the Catholic Diocese of Sacramento, guided by the Holy Spirit, are called by Christ to proclaim the Good News of the Kingdom of God through prayer, praise and sacraments and to witness the Gospel values of love, justice, forgiveness and service to all.\n\nAll Christ’s faithful, by virtue of their baptism, are called by God to contribute to the sanctification and transformation of the world. They do this by fulfilling their own particular duties in the spirit of the Gospel and Christian discipleship. Working in the Church is a path of Christian discipleship to be encouraged. Those who work for the Church continue the mission and ministry of Christ. Their service is unique and necessary for the life and growth of the Church. This has been our tradition from the beginning, as echoed in the words of St. Paul who worked with and relied on other men and women in the work of spreading the Gospel. St. Paul was known to acknowledge and thank them, at times calling them, “my co-workers in Christ Jesus” (Romans 16:3-16).\n\nThe Church needs the services of dedicated lay persons who have a clear knowledge and proper understanding of the teachings of the Church and a firm adherence to those teachings, and whose words and deeds are in conformity with the Gospel. All who seek employment or ministry in the Church are expected to continue their formation and their willingness to learn and grow and to deepen their desire to serve the Lord with excellence and generosity. Those employed by the Church in our Catholic schools, parishes and institutions, as coworkers in the vineyard of the Lord, are rightly expected to be practicing Catholics whose faith is an essential part of their daily lives and who participate fully in the communal worship and life of the Church.\n\nWe recognize that persons who are non-Catholic Christians are also called by the Lord to stand before the world as a witness to his life and resurrection. We, therefore, welcome collaboration with such persons of good faith who share our Catholic vision on important social, moral and ethical issues. It is important for anyone interested in collaborating with us in our work and ministry to have an understanding of the Catholic Church and her teachings.\n\nOur Catholic religious beliefs provide the basic framework for our moral, ethical and social teachings. It is important for anyone interested in collaborating with us in our work and ministry to have an understanding of these teachings.\n\nThe Catholic Church has a special commitment to the poor, the oppressed, and the immigrant. We are committed to promoting a “Culture of Life” from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death. We believe in the inherent dignity of the human person, created in the image and likeness of God, and possessing basic rights endowed by God, including the right to life, the right to religious liberty, and the right to be treated justly with dignity and respect. We believe human sexuality and human procreation are gifts from God to be shared through the risen Christ only by those joined in marriage, an institution that is itself instituted by Almighty God. We believe that all persons are called by God to live chaste lives by virtue of their own dignity and according to their state of life. We believe in the rights of workers to just working conditions, just wages and benefits, as well as the right to organize and join unions or other associations. We oppose all forms of oppression and exploitation, including racism, sexism, pornography, sexual abuse and harassment, and unlawful discrimination.\n\nAs a community of believers, we embrace as a matter of faith, the teachings, policies and beliefs of the Magisterium of the Catholic Church, as defined in the Deposit of Faith. We, therefore, reject anything which is contrary to that teaching, including:\n\nAbortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, artificial contraception, voluntary sterilization, and the unnecessary use of capital punishment;\n\nPornography and obscenity, adultery, cohabiting in sexual relationships of any nature outside of marriage, homosexual activity, the notion of “gay marriage,” and the adoption or placement of children in anything other than a traditional family setting;\n\nSecularism, the paring back of religious freedom rights, or the restriction of religious liberty and liberty of conscience, anti-Catholicism, or anti-Catholic biases;\n\nThe abuse of alcohol or the use of illegal narcotics or other controlled substances; and\n\nViolence or the use of force to resolve social, political or religious problems.\n\nMust the Church’s employees share the Church’s vision and witness the Catholic faith in their life and work?\n\nYes. Every member of the Church must stand before the world as a witness to the life and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. This is particularly important for those person who work and minister in the name of the Church. In our daily affairs and our work, we, as faithful disciples of the risen Christ, must be guided by a Christian conscience, since even in secular business there is no human activity that can be withdrawn from God’s dominion.\n\nThe Diocese, in its role as an employer, expects all employees to be persons, who by word and deed, support and advocate the positions of the Catholic Church. We understand that employment by the Roman Catholic Church is not for everyone, because there are people of good faith who disagree with our teachings and views.\n\nThose unable to authentically witness the Catholic faith by their lives may wish to reflect and seek pastoral guidance before applying for employment or ministry in the Church.\n\nDoes the obligation to share the Church’s vision also pertain to employees who are not Catholic?\n\nYes. As Catholics, we believe that our Faith is universal — that’s what the word “Catholic” means. Thus, even if a person is not Catholic he or she remains called by the Lord to stand before the world as a witness to Christ’s life and resurrection. Persons whose lives do not witness the teachings of the Catholic faith by virtue of their own objections or disbelief, or are unable to witness the Catholic faith by virtue of their lifestyle choices or public conduct, do not meet the basic criteria to work or minister in the name of the Church.\n\nAfter you have carefully reflected on what is contained in this Pre-Application Statement, we invite you to complete the Acknowledgement and Applicant Questionnaire, if you are interested in seeking employment with the Diocese of Sacramento.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nBy signing below, I hereby acknowledge that I have received and read the foregoing Pre-Application Statement of the Diocese of Sacramento. After reading and reflecting upon the teachings and beliefs of the Catholic Church, and the manner in which those matters impact lay employees of the Diocese, I wish to apply for employment with the Diocese, with a full understanding of the religious nature of the Diocese as an employer. I understand the Diocese’s expectations that if my application for lay employment results in my being hired, I will be subject to standards of conduct that incorporate the teachings and beliefs of the Catholic Church as set forth in the Pre-Application Statement, and that these performance expectations will be a material condition of my employment.\n\nDiocese of San Diego\n\nPre-Application Statement Toward Employment in the Church\n\nThe Church needs the service of dedicated lay persons who have a clear knowledge and proper understanding of the teachings of the Church with a firm adherence to those teachings, and whose words and deeds are in conformity with the Gospel.

Lennon\n\nDear Administrators and Teachers,\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that Catholic schools are more than just places of learning, but in fact serve the primary purpose of developing each student as a whole person based on the model of Christ, who is God made flesh and humanity perfected. The Second Vatican Council’s Declaration on Christian Education, Gravissimum Educationis, said as much when it stated:\n\n“The Church is bound as a mother to give to these children of hers an education by which their whole life can be imbued with the spirit of Christ and at the same time do all she can to promote for all peoples the complete perfection of the human person, the good of earthly society and the building of a world that is more human.” Gravissimum Educationis, Section 3.\n\nThis teaching is reflected in numerous Church documents as well as the Code of Canon Law, which states in Canon 794 Sec. 1 that, “The Church has in a special way the duty and the right of educating, for it has a divine mission of helping all to arrive at the fullness of Christian life.” Saint John Paul II gave witness to this core belief regarding the nature and purpose of Catholic schools in his 1979 message to the National Catholic Education Association of the United States, wherein he wrote: “Catholic education is above all a question of communicating Christ, of helping to form Christ in the lives of others.”\n\nAs such, it is clear that the effectiveness of a Catholic school in fulfilling its mission is not simply dependent upon the quality of the religious curriculum utilized or the religious instruction or catechesis that occurs there. Instead, a Catholic school succeeds in its mission only if every aspect of the school is inspired and guided by the Gospel and only if instruction across the entire spectrum of studies is authentically Catholic. As Archbishop J. Michael Miller, C.S.B., then Secretary for the Holy See’s Congregation for Catholic Education, rightly observed in his 2005 keynote address on the subject of the Holy See’s teachings on Catholic schools at a conference at the Catholic University of America:\n\n“The Gospel of Christ and his very person are, therefore, to inspire and guide the Catholic school in its every dimension: its philosophy of education, its curriculum, community of life, its selection of teachers, and even its physical environment.”\n\nLikewise, the Church has long recognized the uniquely important and true ministry of teachers and administrators in fulfilling this mission. Gravissimum Educationis addressed this notion specifically when it stated:\n\n“But let teachers recognize that the Catholic school depends upon them almost entirely for the accomplishment of its goals and programs. They should therefore be very carefully prepared so that both in secular and religious knowledge they are equipped with suitable qualification and also with a pedagogical skill that is in keeping with the findings of the contemporary world. Intimately linked in charity to one another and to their students and endowed with an apostolic spirit, may teachers by their life as much as by their instruction bear witness to Christ, the unique Teacher… The work of these teachers, this sacred synod declares, is in the real sense of the word an apostolate most suited to and necessary for our times and at once a true service offered to society.” Gravissimum Educationis, Section 8 [emphasis added].\n\nFurthermore, the example set by teachers and administrators through their actions and their lives is considered by the Church to be even more important than what they say. As stated by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education:\n\n“The more completely an educator can give concrete witness to the model of the ideal person that is being presented to the students, the more this ideal will be believed and imitated. For it will then be seen as something reasonable and worthy of being lived, something concrete and realizable. It is in this context that the faith witness of the lay teacher becomes especially important. Students should see in their teachers the Christian attitude and behavior that is often so conspicuously absent from the secular atmosphere in which they live.” Lay Catholics in Schools, Witnesses to Faith, Section 32.\n\nConsequently, each and every teacher and administrator in a Catholic school, whether they teach religion as a subject or not, is called by the Church to model Jesus Christ, the perfect teacher, and to bear witness to the Gospel “through their lives as much as by their instructions” (Gravissimum Educationis, Section 8). It is for this reason that Canon 803 Section 2 of the Code of Canon Law requires that, “Formation and education in a Catholic school must be based on the principles of Catholic doctrine, and the teachers must be outstanding in true doctrine and uprightness of life.”\n\nAs a teacher or administrator in a Catholic school, you are engaging a beautiful and uniquely important vocation and ministry of Christ’s Church. You are instrumental in the development of each and every student as a whole and authentically Catholic person. Indeed, it is primarily through you that the school is able to cultivate the love of Christ and kindle the light of Christ in the hearts of its students. As such, it is a great honor and privilege to play such a special and important role in the life of the Church through your ministry. It is also a significant responsibility. Please know that you have my blessings, my prayers, and my gratitude for the important work you do in building up the Body of Christ.\n\nDiocese of Santa Rosa (Excerpts from 15-page employment document)\n\nCode of Ethics for the Teacher in a Catholic School\n\nPREAMBLE\n\n“GO TEACH!” With these words, Christ sent His first disciples on mission. Since the beginning of Christianity, Catholic education has been one of the most important ways in which the mission of the Church is carried out. This education manifests a foundational anthropology, a basics sense of the human being, namely (that) all persons are created in the image and likeness of God, are fallen in view of original sin, and are redeemed by Jesus Christ. To understand, to teach and to model this anthropology are particular requirements of those entrusted with the Church’s educational mission. Thus, in large part the success of Catholic education depends upon the professional competence, quality, and above all, the commitment of the teacher to Christ.\n\nThe Code of Ethics for the Teacher in a Catholic School is a description of a person who is growing in various dimensions of experience. The Code specifies the attitude and the practice of the teacher in relation to the Church, the student, the parent, the community, and the profession. In relationship to the Church in particular, the teacher is not called to an unrealistic perfection but rather to continual growth in understanding and in appreciation for the Church in all Her dimensions. Here, what is meant by ‘continual growth’ also includes ongoing spiritual conversion (i.e., a more complete turning toward God) in one’s soul. This kind of conversion can include a humble acceptance of the standing offer of God’s mercy, which acceptance always moves a person deeper into the heart of the Church. In any case, conversion is like ‘professional development’. That is, just as every teacher recognizes a responsibility to grow so as to keep abreast of developments in the profession, so too the teacher in a Catholic school recognizes a responsibility to grow in efficacy regarding the Church. In sum, whether personally or professionally, the Code of Ethics for the Teacher in a Catholic School represents a guide by which to live, a goal toward which to strive and a promise of lasting success.\n\nThe Diocese of Santa Rosa recognizes and claims its Catholic Elementary and High Schools as educational institutes established to promote and foster the teachings and values of the Catholic Church. The Diocese recognizes that these Institutions have an integral and significant role in the positive presentation of the Catholic faith to the hearts of their students and to our society. The primary purpose of our Schools, without minimizing others, is evangelization. Catholic Schools, in the course of their educational efforts, provide an essentially ecclesiastical ministry. “The duty and right of educating belongs in a unique way to the Church which has been divinely entrusted with the mission to assist men and women so that they can arrive at the fullness of the Christian life” (Canon 794, § 1).\n\nPreamble by +Robert F. Vasa, Bishop of Santa Rosa\n\nPrinciple I: Commitment to the Church\n\nPresidents, principals and teachers are employed, either directly or indirectly, by the Catholic Church for the express purpose of assisting “men and women so that they can arrive at the fullness of the Christian life”. Thus, in addition to specific employee duties, they also share in the mission of the Church and therefore have the responsibility of fostering-through their positions and in the lived reality of their lives—the values, principles, doctrines and teachings of the institutional Catholic Church or, at least, of never publicly contradicting them. In fulfilling our obligation to the Church, we are called to:\n\nRecognize that we are part of the overall educational ministry of the Catholic Church even when some of the persons instructed are not adherents of the Catholic faith.\n\nRecognize that as human beings, we are called by God to a life of holiness. We recognize that, without diminishing our freedom, this call orients us to heed God in our thoughts, words and deeds. We further recognize that this call is all the more compelling for us since, in our lives and vocations as teacher/administrators in a Catholic school, we have been entrusted with the task of helping students “arrive at the fullness of the Christian life” (Canon 794, § 1).\n\nRecognize that we must be models of “exemplary life both personally and professionally” (cf. employment contract). Thus, whether we are at school or outside of school, our public behavior is to be in conformity with Church teaching as expounded in The Catechism of the Catholic Church.\n\nRecognize our duty, to the best of our ability, to know “Church Teaching” (cf. contract) and, if Catholic, to believe in accord with what the Catholic Church holds and professes.\n\nRecognize that we have a responsibility to continue to seek a fuller understanding of the Faith that the Catholic Church professes. Accordingly, we are to take advantage of opportunities offered by the Diocese or Parish to foster Faith, to properly form conscience and to deepen understanding of the Church’s teaching.\n\nRecognize that, in its entirety, The Catechism of the Catholic Church constitutes the source and standard according to which all the ethical matters stated or implied in this Commitment and in the contract are understood and adjudicated.\n\nMorality Statements\n\nDioceses of Billings, Great Falls and Helena\n\nCatholic Moral Standards\n\nfor All Catholic School Employees and Volunteers\n\nA signature is required below to acknowledge that the Catholic school employee (teacher, support staff, coach, etc.), or volunteer has read and understands the Catholic Moral Standards as an essential expectation to his/her position with the Catholic school.\n\nAs a Catholic school employee or volunteer, I understand …\n\n_____ that I will not engage in any conduct or lifestyle, whether in my personal or public life, that would be at variance with or contrary to the moral and religious teachings of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n______ that I will not engage in any conduct or lifestyle, whether in my personal or public life, that would be at variance with or contrary to the moral and religious standards as described in Catholic school polices, Diocesan policies, or my employment contract\n\nPlease Note: These standards have been and will continue to be printed in the Catholic Schools’ personnel handbooks, as well as on the teacher’s contract.\n\nI understand the terms of the Catholic Moral Standards and recognize that any personal conduct or lifestyle (public or private) that violates the Catholic moral standards may result in personnel discipline up to and including dismissal from employment.\n\nI also understand that if I have any questions regarding the Catholic Moral Standards, I will submit them to the school administration, in writing and the school administration will provide a response in a timely manner.\n\nDiocese of Columbus\n\nAdherence to Catholic Church Teachings\n\nAll school personnel who serve in Catholic schools shall be examples of Catholic moral behavior and professionalism. As explained by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops:\n\nThe integration of religious truth and values with the rest of life is brought about in the Catholic school not only by its unique curriculum but, more important, by the presence of teachers [personnel] who express an integrated approach to learning and living in their private and professional lives.\n\nAll school personnel, regardless of their religious affiliation, are therefore required to abide by the moral values advanced by the teachings of Christ, the tenets of the Catholic Church, and the policies and regulations of the Diocesan Department for Education, the Diocese and the employing school. School personnel may be disciplined or terminated for violations of these standards, or any conduct which is contrary to, or rejects or offends the teachings, doctrines, or principles of the Catholic Church. While there may be others not mentioned below, examples of conduct that may result in termination of employment include:\n\nPublic support of activities or beliefs contrary to Catholic Church teaching;\n\nPublic statements disparaging or causing contempt against religion in general or the Catholic Church in particular;\n\nEntry into a marriage which is not recognized by the Catholic Church;\n\nHaving an abortion or publically supporting abortion rights;\n\nSexual relations (same or opposite sex) outside the institution of marriage as recognized by the Catholic Church;\n\nPursuing or publically supporting in vitro fertilization.\n\nDiocesan Department for Education policies and regulations are available online at www.cdeducation.org/Policies. The teachings of the Catholic Church can be found in The Catechism of the Catholic Church which is online at www.vatican.va/archive/Eng0015/_INDEX.\n\nWitness Statements\n\nDioceses of Arlington, Peoria, and Providence and Archdiocese of St. Louis\n\nWitness Statement for Those Who Serve in Catholic Education\n\nThe mission of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit is the mission of the Catholic Church, to reveal God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to all people and to teach them about the fullness of His love. “Indeed the primordial mission of the Church is to proclaim God and to be His witness before the world” (GDC). Catholic education shares in a special way in the Church’s mission by proclaiming and witnessing Jesus Christ and His teachings.\n\nCatholic education, which includes education, formation, and transformation, exists in order to evangelize. Two important elements that make up the process of evangelization are proclamation and witness. It is essential, therefore, that those who serve in Catholic education proclaim Jesus Christ, His life and ministry, present the Catholic faith in its fullness and be Christ’s witness to the world.\n\nInitially those being evangelized will be attracted to and listen to those who are good witnesses. “The Good News proclaimed by the witness of life sooner or later has to be proclaimed by the word of life” (Evangelii Nutiandi).

Catholic education is an expression of the mission entrusted by Jesus to the Church He Founded.’ (To Teach as Jesus Did, 6.7).\n\nPre-Eminence of Catholic Schools: ‘The Catholic school strives to relate all human culture to the news of salvation, so that the life of faith will illumine the knowledge which students gain of the world, of life and of humanity. (National Directory for Catechesis, 232).\n\nEducator in the Catholic School: ‘Beautiful indeed and of great importance is the vocation of all those who undertake the task of education in Catholic schools. This vocation demands special qualities of mind and heart, very careful preparations, and continuing readiness to renew and to adapt..’ (Declaration on Christian Education, 4).\n\nThe Catholic school fulfills an authentic ministry. Therefore, to work in this apostolate means rendering a unique, challenging and invaluable work for the Church. The nobility of the position to which teachers in the Catholic school…respond requires that they communicate the message of Christ not only in their teaching and their participation in the sacramental life of the Church but also in every expression of their behavior. In truth and in fact, herein lies the difference between a school whose education is penetrated by the Christian spirit and one in which religious in an academic subject like any other. ‘By their witness and their behavior teachers are the first importance to impart a distinctive character to Catholic schools.’ (The Catholic School, 78).\n\nIt follows then, that the teacher in Catholic education must be a person of prayer, one who frequently reflects on the scriptures, and whose Christ-like living testifies to deep faith, and who is a practicing Catholic who understands and accepts the teaching of the Catholic Church and the moral demands of the Gospel and who can contribute to the achievement of the school’s Catholic Identity and apostolic goals. (National Catechetical Directory, 207, 231).\n\nEssentially, the Catholic school educator is one:\n\nCalled to proclaim, to live, to celebrate the message of Christ in His Gospel.\n\nChosen to create, to enter into and to build community that is at the heart of Christian education\n\nCommitted to the growth, development, and well-being of one’s educational family in the form of serve and love.\n\nThis individual truly witnesses to and fully shares in the mission of Christ and His Church in bringing about the Kingdom of God.\n\nBelief Statements/Oaths\n\nDiocese of Phoenix\n\nProfession of Faith\n\n(For newly hired Catholics in schools, catechetical or youth leadership positions)\n\nI, N., with firm faith believe and profess each and every thing that is contained in the symbol of faith, namely:\n\nI believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.\n\nWith firm faith I also believe everything contained in God’s word, written or handed down in tradition and proposed by the Church, whether by way of solemn judgment or through the ordinary and universal magisterium, as divinely revealed and calling for faith.\n\nI also firmly accept and hold each and every thing that is proposed definitively by the Church regarding teaching on faith and morals.\n\nMoreover, I shall always teach in the accord with the Official Magisterium of the Church as it is proclaimed by the Pope and the College of Bishops.\n\nProfession of Faith\n\n(For newly hired Non-Catholics in schools)\n\nI accept and hold each and every thing that is proposed definitively by the Catholic Church regarding teaching on faith and morals.\n\nI shall always teach in accord with the official teachings of the Church as it is proclaimed by the Pope and the College of Bishops.\n\nIII.

The Teacher-Minister further understands and acknowledges that it is the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church that teachers in a Catholic school are truly and in a very real sense engaged in a special ministry, or apostolate, of the Roman Catholic Church and that such teachers should bear witness to Christ in their lives as much as in their classroom instruction. For this reason, Canon 803 of the Code of Canon Law requires that teachers of a Catholic school must be “outstanding in true doctrine and uprightness of life.” As such, the Teacher-Minister agrees to act, speak, and live at all times in a manner consistent with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church as expressed by the Magisterium of the Church including, without limitation, as found in the Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church, which is available online at http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM and which is incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.
