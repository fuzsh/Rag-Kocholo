        "text": "Project Canterbury A Refutation of the Charge of Apostacy made by the Bishop of Honolulu\n\nAgainst the Rector of Honolulu and the Trustees of St. Clement's Chapel, Honolulu By John Usborne Honolulu: no publisher, 1901. ST. CLEMENT'S CHAPEL AND THE RECTORY, HONOLULU--FROM THE ENTRANCE GATES. This property was a wilderness eighteen months ago, only having come into the possession\n\nof the Trustees of St. Clement's Chapel in October, 1899. TO ALL Members of the Anglican Communion WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.\n\nThe Bishop of Honolulu has caused to issue two-official documents dated 27th February and March 4th, 1901, copies of which are herein contained.\n\nIn these letters I am advertised as a Schismatic, and as having founded a new Sect styled \"The Episcopal Church at Large.\"\n\nBy this action the Bishop has placed me in a most serious position, and one in which it is impossible to effectually defend myself, inasmuch as it is unknown to me where these letters have been circulated, and such official documents, issued by a Bishop of the Church, would naturally be regarded as reliable and conclusive.\n\nUnder these circumstances but one course is open to me, that of making a public denial of the Bishop's accusation, which I now do.\n\nTo all Members of the Anglican Communion to whom these Presents may come.\n\nGreeting.\n\nBe it known to you by these Presents, that the Reverend John Usborne, formally of the City of Toronto, admitted to the order of Priesthood by the Lord Bishop of Toronto, in the year of our Lord, 1889, and appointed in the year 1897 to a position of dignity and trust in the Anglican Church in Hawaii, (the said Church being an offshoot of the Church of England planted in the Hawaiian Islands, in full communion with the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, and with all the: daughter Churches of the Church of England 'throughout; the world) has freely, voluntary, and by his own act [3/4] separated himself from the communion of the Anglican Church aforesaid, having made himself the founder of a new sect under the name and style of \"The Episcopal Church at Large,\" according to the tenor of a deed of Conveyance recorded in the Registry of Conveyances of the Territory of Hawaii, Liber 173, folio 140, dated October 1, 1897, whereby a certain piece of land was conveyed to \"Thos. R. Walker,\" Esq., Tom May, Esq. and Rev. John Usborne, all of said Honolulu, as Trustees in trust for the use and benefit of THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH AT LARGE to have and to hold as Trustees of the Episcopal Church, their heirs, successors in trust, and assigns forever,\" and for three years has persistently rejected every opportunity offered him of bringing the church built under the trust aforesaid together with himself and his congregation into union with the Anglican Church in Hawaii.\n\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of February, in the year of our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and one.\n\nALFRED WILLIS, Bishop of Honolulu.\n\nI certify that the above declaration was this day duly recorded in the Registry of the Diocese of Honolulu, dated the 4th day of March, 1901.\n\nThe Church Defence and Extension Association of Hawaii.\n\nTo all to whom these Presents may come, Greeting.\n\nBe it known to you by these Presents, that Whereas there was published in the Churchman. Vol. 83, No. 5, dated February 2, 1901, a letter on the \"Church in Hawaii,\" signed, \"Geo. S. Harris, President, for the Church Defence and Extension Association of Hawaii, Honolulu, H. I., January 2nd, 1901,\" intended to make it appear and be believed in the United States that the Rev. A. C. A. Hall, D. D., Bishop of Vermont, had been [4/5] misinformed and was generally in error in the statements concerning the Anglican Church in Hawaii published over his signature in a previous issue (that of Dec. 1) of the same journal.\n\nThe position and standing of the said Association is as follows:\n\n1. The said Church Defence and Extension Association has no recognition from the Bishop, Synod, or any of the Parochial Clergy of the Diocese of Honolulu.\n\n2. The said Church Defence and Extension Association was incorporated on March 10, 1899, through the. instrumentality of one John Usborne, Clerk, late of Toronto, Canada, who had previously, in 1897, separated himself from the Anglican Church in Hawaii, in which he had been given a position of dignity and trust, and become the founder of a schism holding property under the name and style of \"The Episcopal Church at Large,\" and it was for the Defence and Extension of this schismatical body, and not of the Church, that the so-called Church Defence and Extension Association was brought into existence.\n\n3. Whilst any one reading the preample of the Charter of Incorporation of the said Association would be led to believe that it was promoted by American Churchmen, it being stated, that \"it is deemed by the members of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Hawaiian Islands to be expedient, that such an Association should be formed,\"\n\n(1) Six out of seven of the Charter members are British, one only being an American, and\n\n(2) There is no such body in existence as \"The Protestant Episcopal Church of the Hawaiian Islands.\"\n\n4. Persons unbaptized and persons who do not hold the Faith of the Church are eligible for membership in the Association, provided they are \"adherents or attendants of the Church, and accept and agree with the object of the Association.\"\n\nTo which four characteristics of the Society, calling itself the \"Church Defence and Extension Association of Hawaii,\" nothing more need be added to enable you to determine the value to attach to the communication published in the CHURCHMAN, of February 2nd, 1901.\n\n[6] In witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hand this fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord, 1901.\n\nALFRED WILLIS,\n\nBishop of Honolulu.\n\nVINCENT H. KITCAT,\n\nVice-Dean and Clerical Secretary of the Diocesan Synod.\n\nEDMUND STILES, Registrar.\n\nIn the first place, I call upon Almighty God to witness that I have never, in thought, word or deed, either separated myself from the communion of the Anglican Church in Hawaii, or that I have founded any new sect, or contemplated any such step. On the contrary I have lawfully officiated daily in St. Clement's Chapel, Honolulu, as a priest of the Anglican Church in Hawaii and as Rector of Honolulu, and have celebrated the Holy Communion weekly for the past three years, except during my absence at the General Convention in 1898.\n\nI have used only the authorized Prayer Books and forms of prayer, English and American, and the services at St. Clement's Chapel have been, and are, the same as those in other orthodox churches.\n\nThe Bishop Doane Manuals of Christian Doctrine are taught in my Sunday School.\n\nI solemnly affirm that his Lordship has no ground whatever for making any such statements, and that in these letters I, and all other people, hear for the first time that I have separated myself from the Church, or have founded any new sect, or that any such sect exists. That this name \"Episcopal Church at Large\" is now applied to St. Clement's for the first time, and that by the Bishop, and that St. Clement's always has been, and is now regarded by its Trustees, Congregation, and the public of Honolulu as a Chapel of the Anglican Church in Hawaii. A priest's asseverations of loyalty to his Church in the face of such an accusation from his Bishop, would be of [6/7] no value if unsupported by proof. I am therefore compelled to make public what documentary evidence I possess, although I had hoped this to remain strictly private.\n\nIf my later letters to the Bishop should be looked upon as intemperate, I would say they were written under strong mental pressure. The Bishop is very little my senior, (he is sixty-four years of age) and I came to this Diocese with the clear understanding that I should have the privilege of speaking plainly should occasion require it.\n\nThe one trouble in connection with St. Clement's has been the determination of the Bishop to control the property itself, which the Trustees, in the interests of the Church, have thought it better he should not do.\n\nTo enable you to arrive at a just conclusion, it is necessary that a short history should be given of facts that have led up to this climax.\n\nIn ordinary justice, I ask you to read it.\n\nI am, yours truly,\n\nJOHN USBORNE.\n\nHonolulu, May, 1901.\n\nThe Rev. John Usborne was the Rector of St. Clement's Church in the City of Toronto, where he was very happily established.\n\nHe had visited Honolulu in 1892, where he had found the Church in a very disturbed state.\n\nA few years later, from conscientious motives, he was led to offer himself for the work in this Diocese. This involved a great personal sacrifice, but yielding to the dictates of conscience, he wrote thus to the Bishop of Honolulu in November, 1896:\n\n\"You will now see my object in writing to you. It is not to ask you to appoint me to the Cathedral, it is simply to offer you fully and freely my services and to tell you that if you desire it, I am ready and glad to cast in my lot with yours in the work of the Church in Hawaii, and to devote my whole energy to helping you to restore a [7/8] state of things more acceptable to the Lord.\" * * *\n\n\"But a perfect confidence must exist between us. If the Bishop and the Rector have not perfect confidence in each other, you cannot expect the people to have faith in either.\" * * * *\n\n\"About stipend, do not let this influence you, if it is necessary I could do without stipend for six or eight months.\" * * *\n\n\"But do not ask me to go if you do not mean to trust me; with a sheet of paper between us, our influence would be impaired.\"\n\n''I may say I place my life in your hands.\" In December the Bishop of Honolulu replied in the kindest terms, and warmly inviting him to go to his Diocese, but frankly telling him that he did not see any immediate prospect of stipend. He said:\n\n\"That your offer should have arrived at this particular moment is the more remarkable, because I was just beginning to give up hope of being able to attend the Lambeth conference next July.\" * * *\n\n\"This sense may make them more disposed in a little while to see the necessity of reunion on the basis of a stipend being found for a Rector, to which post it is understood you should be appointed.\" etc., etc.\n\nOn receiving this letter Mr. Usborne resigned his parish in Toronto and prepared to leave with his family for Honolulu, where, he very naturally supposed, he would be appointed Rector, since that post was vacant.\n\nOn arriving in Honolulu the Bishop conferred upon him the title of Vice-Dean of the Cathedral.\n\nIn reading the Cathedral Constitution, Mr. Usborne observed the following clauses;\n\n\"'Until the endowment of the several dignities, Vice-Dean, precentor, chancelor, treasurer, and missioner, any of the canons may be anointed by the Bishop from year to year to perform the duties proper to Vice-Dean, precentor, chancelor, treasurer, and missioner, but in such cases the names are not \"titles of dignity\" but used to distinguish the persons discharging such functions.\"\n\n\"Until the Vice-Dean is endowed, one of the canons may be appointed Vice-Dean annually, at the January meeting of the Chapter.\"\n\n[9] Since the office of Vice-Dean was stated to be an annual appointment and conferred no parochial authority, it was useless to Mr. Usborne as a parish priest. He thereupon applied to the Bishop for institution to his expected post as Rector, which only could give him necessary authority in the disquieted state of the parish. The Bishop then instituted him Rector in the following document:\n\nALFRED, by Divine permission, Lord Bishop of Honolulu.\n\nTo my well beloved in Christ, John Usborne, Clerk. Greeting:\n\nBy virtue of the authority committed to me, I admit you to the Rectory or Incumbency of the Parish of Honolulu, in the Hawaiian Islands, to which you are presented by the Lord Bishop of Honolulu, the true and undoubted patron thereof. And I do, truly and canonically, institute you to the said Rectory or Incumbency, and invest you with all and singular the rights, members and appurtenances thereunto belonging (you having first before me subscribed the articles and taken the oaths which are in this case by law required to be subscribed and taken, and made the Declaration required to be made.)\n\nAnd I do, by these presents. Commit unto you the Cure and Government of the Souls of the inhabitants, Members of the Church of England, within the limit of the said Rectory or Incumbency of the Parish of Honolulu, saving always to the said Lord Bishop and his successors, Bishops of Honolulu, the Episcopal Rights.\n\nGiven under our seal this fifth day of April, in the year of our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and Ninety-seven, and of our Consecration the Twenty-sixth.\n\n(Episcopal Seal.) (Signed)\n\nALFRED HONOLULU.\n\n[10] ALFRED, by Divine permission,\n\nLord Bishop of Honolulu.\n\nTo all Rectors and Clerks, whomsoever, wheresoever resident throughout the Diocese of Honolulu in the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nGreeting:\n\nWhereas by the virtue of the authority committed to me, I have admitted John Usborne, Clerk, to the Rectory of the Parish of Honolulu in the said Hawaiian Islands, to which he was presented by the Lord Bishop of Honolulu, the true and undoubted patron thereof and have duly and canonically instituted him in and to the said Rectory and invested him with all and singular the rights, members and appurtenances thereunto belonging: you are therefore hereby desired jointly and severally to induct, and cause the said Clerk, or his lawful Proctor, in his name and for him, to be inducted into the real, actual and corporal possession of the said Rectory of the Parish of Honolulu and of all and singular the rights, members and appurtenances thereunto belonging, and to defend him so inducted: and what you shall do in the premises, you or whosoever of you that shall execute this present Mandate, are duly to certify to the said Lord Bishop, his Suffragan or Vicar General, or General Commissary, or other competent judge or person on his behalf, when required so to do.\n\nGiven under our Seal this sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and Ninety-seven, and of our Consecration the Twenty-sixth.\n\n(Episcopal Seal.) (Signed) ALFRED HONOLULU.\n\nThis document was endorsed as follows: \"On the ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and Ninety-seven, the within named Rev. John Usborne, was duly inducted [10/11] into the real, actual and corporal possession of the within mentioned Rectory, and of all and singular the rights, members, and appurtenances thereunto belonging, in obedience to the within Mandate.\n\nBy me,\n\n(Signed) VINCENT H. KITCAT.\n\nIn presence of S. MEHEULA.\n\nTo establish Mr. Usborne's right to his Rectory at this date, is very important, since it is by virtue of being Rector of Honolulu, that he has officiated in St. Clement's Chapel during the past three years, and on which, he bases his claim to the right to do so.\n\nTo show then, that on his induction, he irrevocably became the Rector of Honolulu. The following is copied from \"Cripps Law relating to the Church and Clergy. Sixth Edition.\"\n\nThis is a standard work on English ecclesiastical law:\n\n\"Induction is, therefore, the investiture of the temporal part of the benefice, and when a Clerk is thus presented, instituted and inducted into a Rectory, he is then, and not before, in full and complete possession, and is called in law persona impersonata, parson imparsonee, for as by institution or collation the spiritual cares of the parish and cure of souls is committed to him, so by induction are committed to him the temporalities of the Church and actual possession of the Church,\" \"by induction he acquires jus in re, or complete and full right, and he has now the real possession of the church, with all the rights, profits, and appurtenances thereto belonging.\"\n\nSuch an appointment, as most people know, is an appointment for life.\n\nWithin ten days after Mr. Usborne's arrival in Honolulu, the Bishop left for England by way of Australia, having appointed Mr. Usborne his Commissary during his absence.\n\n[12] A month later, on May 13th, the Bishop wrote from Australia in reply to a letter from Mr. Usborne asking him to put in writing the promise he had made, that in event of the union of the two congregations which worshipped in the Cathedral, they should have the privilege of disbursing the funds they themselves subscribed, their offertories, and so forth. The Bishop replied thus:\n\n\"But although I am thus estopped from complying with your request, there is no curtailment of the liberty which members of a reunited congregation will enjoy to organize a new parish and build a new Church in Honolulu whenever they may desire and have the means of doing so.\n\n\"The time is not far distant when we ought to have a Church in Palama and another in the Punahou direction. Whenever a sufficient number of people may be able to start such a new organization there is nothing in the Constitution to hinder their doing so. Whilst as Bishop I would not give my consent beforehand to consecrate another Church for the English-speaking race within a mile of the Cathedral, beyond that distance I would be prepared to do so; its erection and support being both satisfactorily guaranteed.\"\n\nOn the strength of this letter, was not the Bishop's Commissary justified, and had he not reason to suppose that the Bishop would approve his action, in building a Mission Chapel in the Punahou suburb, two miles from the Cathedral?\n\nThe latter half of this extract Mr. Usborne read shortly afterwards, in a sermon he preached on Church extension, in order to show that the Bishop was in favour of extending' the Church in the suburban parts of the City, which the people would not credit. He did not consider the former part necessary to his point, nor that it conditioned in any way the Bishop's desire for Church extension as expressed in the latter half of the letter. Therefore he did not read the former part, but which, the Bishop contends, qualified his consent given in the latter part.\n\nHe then publicly charged Mr. Usborne in his Diocesan Magazine with dishonourable duplicity, and [12/13] intentionally deceiving his people in the building of this Chapel.\n\nThe City of Honolulu was five miles across, and this letter very naturally led him to suppose that the Bishop would be pleased if one or two missions were built during his absence, especially since there were three priests besides the Bishop officiating in the Cathedral.\n\nMr. Usborne therefore in replying to his letter to England on 21st July, said:\n\n\"With regard to the extension of the Church in the Punahou district I am quite with you. The town is growing up very fast in the neighborhood of the College which is nearly two miles from the Cathedral, and even the Central Union people have no place of worship there. I have called on a good many people there and find them much in favour of a Church in that locality, and if I can collect the necessary funds, I shall secure a proper site near the College.\"\n\nAgain, on the 21st of August, he wrote the Bishop thus:\n\n\"I have two very nice sites offered for a small Church at Punahou, 2 1/2 miles from the Cathedral, and I am collecting for a building. I think one to hold 60 or 70 persons will be large enough. There are a great many people around there without any Church privileges.\"\n\nHe wrote the Bishop again on the 4th of September: \"I have some $1,600 promised for the Punahou Church; I think $2,000 will be enough. This will put up a neat building to hold 75 persons, and there are non-church-goers enough in that immediate section to fill it, and a good number of children for a school. I hope to have it open for Christmas.\"'\n\nOn the 23d of September, he wrote to the Bishop again: \"I have bought a grand lot at Punahou, corner of Makiki and Wilder avenue, and shall start to work next week building.\"\n\nIn acknowledging these various letters the Bishop made no allusion to the Mission, which Mr. Usborne could only attribute to lack of interest, but on the 5th of October the Bishop wrote thus:\n\n[14] \"With regard to the scheme you have on hand for a Church at Punahou, I do not feel that I have yet sufficient data before me to express any opinion at present, either of approval or disapproval. There is not time before my return for me to obtain an answer to several questions that must be answered before I can finally give my sanction. You will see from our Statutes that there are several preliminaries to be carefully observed.''\n\nWhen this letter reached Honolulu, the money had been collected, the contract was signed and the building well advanced. Mr. Usborne was naturally a good deal surprised at the tone of this letter, since the Bishop had definitely stated in his previous letter, that \"Whenever a sufficient number of people may be able to start such a new organization there is nothing in the Constitution to hinder their doing so,\" but it was too late to stop the work.\n\nAt this time the Annexation of these Islands was uncertain, although it was expected; therefore it was thought expedient by the donors, that the deed of the lot which had been purchased for this Chapel, should be drawn, not in trust for the \"Anglican Church in Hawaii,\" but for the \"Episcopal Church at large,\" which name was selected as an appropriate one, that would apply equally to whichever branch of the Church was finally established here.\n\nIt was for this reason and this reason only, that this name was selected, and it did not occur to those who chose it that it would ever be questioned.\n\nThe words \"at large\" were interlined in the deed, and appear only once. They were added after the deed was drawn, and not written in conspicuous characters as the Bishop's document would lead one to suppose.\n\nThe most liberal subscribers to this Mission requested that the property should be vested in a trust other than the \"Board of Trustees of the Anglican Church.\" Mr. Usborne, being a comparative stranger, did not, at the time, quite realize the force of their reasons.\n\nThey wished this because they had reason to know that any Church property the Bishop controlled, he controlled so effectually, that neither the clergymen or the laity [14/15] were permitted a voice in its management except by the sanction of the Bishop.\n\nThe Bishop and the \"Board of Trustees\" are referred to throughout this paper as convertible terms, since the Bishop controls that Board.\n\nThree Trustees were selected, two being members of the Board of Trustees of the Anglican Church, the most influential and wealthy men in the Church, the Rector being the third. This trust was formed in all good faith, it seemed to them to be perfectly legitimate, safe and in proper form, and in strict obedience to the canons of the Diocese, and Mr. Usborne as the Bishop's Commissary approved it.\n\nThe Bishop returned in December.\n\nShortly afterwards he requested that this property be transferred to the Board of Trustees of the Anglican Church. Mr. Usborne gave his consent to this at once, provided the Board of Trustees assumed, with the property, the liability of the unpaid purchase money $3,000.00 for which amount the Trustees had given their joint promissory note, but the Bishop refused to assume this liability and the Trustees refused to transfer the property unless their note was released.\n\nThe matter than seemed to drop, but in February, the following letter was largely circulated:\n\nTHE BISHOP OF HONOLULU.\n\nTo All Members of the Anglican Church in the Parish of Saint Andrew, Honolulu.\n\nHonolulu, February 7, 1898.\n\nMy Dear Friends:\n\nThe utterances delivered from the pulpit of St. Andrew's Cathedral by Canon Usborne yesterday morning, with reference to a certain building recently erected in the direction of Punahou, oblige me to break the silence I have observed since my return from England in regard to that edifice, and explain to all members of the Anglican Church, in Honolulu, why that building is not, and [15/16] cannot be, under present conditions, recognized by the Bishop as having any connection with the Anglican Church in this city.\n\nI have been told that, when the erection of this building, as a Mission Church, was first mooted, it was generally believed that the project had the full sanction of the Bishop, and that a letter purporting to express that approval was read from the Cathedral pulpit. Let me tell you that at the date when a certain letter of mine was read from the pulpit, all that I had written in any way bearing upon the subject, that I have any recollection of, was a general remark that the time was approaching when we ought to have Mission Churches in the outlying parts of the city. On receiving in London information from Canon Usborne that the erection of a church near Punahou was contemplated, I replied to the effect, that no particulars respecting the proposed Church having been furnished, I was not in a position to express either approval or disapproval of the project; but I pointed out that there were certain conditions that must be carefully complied with in any undertaking of that nature. If he was ignorant of those conditions, it was his duty to have made himself acquainted with them before proceeding further.\n\nOn arriving here in the middle of December, and learning that a building was already erected, I explained to Canon Usborne that no Bishop could accept it under its present conditions, and furnished him with a copy of the ecclesiastical law governing the consecration of churches (English).\n\nFull opportunity was thus afforded for an effort to be made to rectify the error which had been made, and for placing the edifice in such relation to the Cathedral, that it might at least be possible, other conditions being- satisfied, for the Bishop to accept it as a Mission Church. Meanwhile I have kept silence, thus giving time for steps in that direction to be taken. Nothing, however, has been done, and, in place of this, you were compelled to listen, on Septuagesima Sunday, to an appeal for your sympathy with a proceeding, which has not yet been put on such a basis that any member of the Church can consistently support it.\n\n[17] It being necessary that every one should fully understand the situation, and know the reason why the building in question cannot yet receive Episcopal recognition, I will proceed to point out the conditions that must be satisfied in the erection of Mission Churches here in Honolulu.\n\nIt should first be clearly understood that the Incumbent of a Parish Church, whether he be styled Rector, Vicar or Perpetual Curate, has no authority to exercise his public ministry in any building other than the Parish Church without the license of the Bishop. That is a general law.\n\nHere in Honolulu the Rector is also Vice-Dean of the Cathedral, and, as such, has solemnly accepted a Cathedral constitution, which subjects all mission churches that may be built to the control of the Chapter, of which, he is a member. That is a position that Canon Usborne voluntarily accepted, and subject to which he holds his present appointment in the Cathedral. Up to the present, however, the Chapter has received no information of what is being done at Punahou.\n\nMission Churches, as distinguished from churches of newly formed parishes, do not become separate financial centres. The offerings and contributions of those attending the services in such churches are paid to the common treasury of the Parish Church, out of which the running expenses of the services are defrayed. It is necessary for this principle to be observed to safe-guard the rights of the Parish Church. A Church that becomes a new financial centre is not a Mission Church.\n\nBefore the Bishop can consecrate any building for a Church, he requires a guarantee that the site is made Church property forever. The conveyance of the land to the Trustees of the Anglican Church in Hawaii, a corporation authorized by law to hold property for the purposes of the Anglican Church, gives that guarantee. So long as the site is private property there is no such guarantee, and the Bishop cannot accept it.\n\nThese are the leading principles to be observed in establishing Mission Churches. Any building erected in disregard of those principles, whatever its external appearance, is merely a private house, which cannot be used [17/18] for public worship. The mind of the Church of England is particularly clear on this point, it being laid down in the 71st Canon:\n\n\"No minister shall preach or administer the Holy Communion in any private house, except it be in times of necessity, when any being either so impotent as he cannot go to the church, or very dangerously sick, are desirous to be partakers of the Sacrament, upon pain of suspension for the first offence, and ex-communication for the second.\"\n\nIt will now be clear to every one, without going into further detail, why the Bishop cannot, under present conditions, give any recognition to the building at Punahou; and it will also be plain, if there are persons in that locality really in need of a church, by what steps the building that has been put up can be placed on such a footing that it can be accepted for a Mission Church, believe me,\n\nFaithfully your servant and Bishop,\n\nALFRED HONOLULU.\n\nThe sermon referred to above was of a very ordinary character showing that with increase of population there should be an increase of church accommodation, that he thought a city of 30,000, five miles in diameter should have more than one church. It may be remarked that the Bishop was not present and did not hear this sermon.\n\nMr. Usborne, in a pamphlet, entitled \"Two Letters\" stated the plain facts of the case, and protested against the Bishop's action as unreasonable, since he had intimated a desire for Church extension, he had tacitly permitted the Chapel to be built, and he might have had the control lie desired, of the property, had he relieved the Trustees of personal liability, and especially, as at the time, three priests and the Bishop officiated in St. Andrew's Cathedral Church.\n\nIn deference to the Bishop's wishes the Chapel was not opened, nor would it ever have been opened without the Bishop's consent had not Mr. Usborne been subsequently unlawfully deprived of his Parish Church by the Bishop, when, as Rector of the Parish, without a church, he felt justified in using this Chapel.\n\n[19] With regard to the above letter.\n\nIt was expected that the Bishop would license this Chapel, should this step be necessary and it was not intended to be opened without.\n\nThe heading of the subscription list proclaimed that the Chapel to be built should be nothing more than a Mission.\n\nIt was never intended to be a financial centre, and could not be, its being situated in too poor a section of the town.\n\nIt was not intended to be consecrated, being little more than a temporary building.\n\nThe Chapter, which is composed of the Bishop's Chaplain, knew all about this Chapel, as did the Bishop also.\n\nThere is not one valid reason given in this letter to show insincerity on Mr. Usborne's or the Trustees' part, or why the Bishop should not have accepted this Chapel as a Mission of the Cathedral.\n\nThere were many people in this suburb who seldom or never went to church owing to distance (over two miles, and in a tropical country) and children without a Sunday-School.\n\nMr. Usborne had offered his services gratuitously to the Bishop for eight months, but a year had now passed without mention being made of a stipend, which meantime had became a matter of importance to him.\n\nThe Bishop, as Dean, claimed all the receipts of the Church: his Chaplain, the organist and all expenses of the Church were paid but the Rector received nothing, and there appeared no prospect of his receiving any stipend.\n\nIt had been ascertained by Mr. Usborne that the Dean and Chapter of St. Andrew's Cathedral had never been legalized by Government incorporation, which authority is necessary to the existence of such a corporation. The Cathedral Constitution proclaims that its Dean and Chapter is, like other such bodies, a ''Body Corporate,\" but such a body cannot exist without Government authorization, and therefore, the Bishop was not legally Dean, and had not the right as such, to deprive the Rector of his stipend which should be paid from the receipts of the Parish Church. Mr. Usborne therefore caused a notice [19/20] to be served on the Church Wardens, forbidding their disbursing these receipts until it should be learned to whom they belonged.\n\nA few days later, Mr. Usborne became aware of the fact, that in England, the law required every Rector to \"read himself in.\"\n\nAlthough this was not the law in the Anglican Church in Hawaii, and the Bishop had never spoken of it, the relations between the Bishop and Mr. Usborne being strained, the latter felt anxious not to give the Bishop an opportunity or an excuse for a reprimand, he therefore wrote his Lordship thus:\n\nHonolulu, 15th March, 1898.\n\nTHE RIGHT REVEREND THE BISHOP OF HONOLULU,\n\nMy Dear Lord Bishop:\n\nOn reading up Ecclesiastical Law lately I have become aware that it is necessary in England, for a Rector to go through the form of publicly reading the Thirty-nine Articles and assenting to the same.\n\nThis, of course, I am quite ready and willing to do.\n\nAlthough you have not spoken of it, I should feel obliged by your appointing a day when I may do this, as I wish to conform, in every respect, to the requirements of the law; and if you would kindly instruct your Secretary to send me a blank form of certificate, I should be obliged.\n\nI am, yours faithfully,\n\nJOHN USBORNE.\n\nThe Bishop replied as follows:\n\nHonolulu. 19 March 1898.\n\nMy Dear Sir:--I have to acknowledge the receipt of a pamphlet from you entitled ''Two Letters,\" from which [20/21] it appears that you regard my appointment of you to a Canonry in the Cathedral, and my making you Vice-Dean, to be null and void and of no effect.\n\nI have also to acknowledge your letter of the 15th March, 1898, in which you inform me that a step, necessary to render valid and effectual your institution as Rector of St. Andrew's has never been taken.\n\nSince you maintain, in your opinion, you have no official position in my Cathedral Church, and you admit you are no lawful Rector of any Parish Church, I must decline for the present to invite you or to give you my permission to take any part in the services of the said Church, whether the same be regarded as a Cathedral or Parish Church, without which permission you are, at the present moment, according to your own statements, without authority to officiate or perform any ministerial act in this city or Diocese.\n\nThe questions you have raised are under consideration and as soon as they have been fully and carefully examined, the conclusions arrived at shall be communicated to you.\n\nI am, yours very faithfully,\n\n(Signed) ALFRED HONOLULU.\n\nThe Bishop would appear to be mistaken here. Mr. Usborne did not inform the Bishop that \"reading in\" was a necessary step in this diocese, and the Bishop certainly could not lawfully require him to do anything that was not required by the Statutes and Canons of the Diocese, and \"reading in\" is not.\n\nMoreover, \"reading in\" is not necessary to render valid the institution of a Rector anywhere; his induction, as before shown, gives him full and complete possession of his Parish Church.\n\nThe law of England states that a Clergyman, when he has been inducted, becomes a complete incumbent, and that he has then full possession of the temporalities, as well as the Spiritualities, of his benefice--but it requires further, that, although he is now in full possession, he [21/22] shall, at some time, publicly, in the hearing of the people, declare his belief in the doctrines of the Church as laid down in the Thirty-nine Articles. Thus--\n\n\"Every person instituted or collated to any benefice with cure of souls shall, on the first Lord's day, or on such other Lord's day as the Bishop may appoint and allow, publicly and openly in the presence of the congregation there assembled read the Thirty-nine Articles of religion, and immediately after reading make the declaration of assent.\" \"And if any person so instituted or collated wilfully fails to comply with this provision, he shall absolutely forfeit his benefice. The making this declaration as now required, constitutes what has heretofore been termed \"reading in,\" and if omitted at the proper time the only question which would arise would seem to be whether the omission was wilful.\" (Cripps.)\n\nIt is the Bishop's duty to appoint a day for such \"reading in\" when requested by the Rector.\n\nAs the law provides \"that lapse shall not occur because the Church remain void through the Bishop's own default, and he thereby is a \"disturber\" so a Rector, who is willing and ready to \"read in,\" is blameless, and the nonfulfillment of this requisite, through the Bishop's default in not appointing a day when requested, does not in any way impair his Rectorial rights.\n\nHowever, Mr. Usborne, perhaps not wisely, accepted this suspension, and joined the congregation in the body of the Church.\n\nThere was no one to whom to appeal. Yet he refrained from opening the Chapel.\n\nWithout any notice a little later, on Thursday in Holy Week. 1898, the following document was handed to Mr. Usborne. There had been no citation, no charge made, or form of trial, although the Constitution of the Anglican Church in Hawaii provides that\n\n\"For the determinations of questions relating to the due fulfillment of the Sacred Ministry in its several functions of administration of the word and Sacraments, and of Spiritual discipline, the Bishop shall summon the Clergy of the Diocese to a synod, to be called the Sacred Synod.\"\n\nKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that John Usborne who was admitted to the Holy Order of Deacons by the Bishop of Toronto in the year of our Lord, 1887, and in the same year was ordained to the Priesthood by the same Bishop, was licensed by us the Bishop of Honolulu to officiate in the Diocese of Honolulu for six months in the year, 1892, and therefore could not be ignorant of this, that the Hawaiian Islands lie outside the limits of the British Empire, and of the United States of America, and also that the Anglican Church in Hawaii is a Missionary offshoot of the Mother Church of England dependent for its support on the freewill offerings of the faithful, and a grant from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel having no glebes, tithes, or endowments for the support of its Clergy.\n\nAnd that he the said John Usborne, having this full knowledge of the situation as aforesaid, did on or about December, 1896, freely and voluntarily, without any previous communication from us, offer his services to us the Bishop of Honolulu, expressing desire to labour for the advancement of the Gospel in the City of Honolulu, within our diocese and jurisdiction:\n\nAnd that we, the said Bishop, fully confiding in the integrity, fidelity, and good morals of the said John Usborne did accent his offer, and to show our appreciation of his willingness to serve our Cathedral Church without stipend for a period, did signify, to him in writing that we purposed to promulgate a Cathedral constitution and under that constitution install him a Canon of our Cathedral with the office of Vice-Dean, but of making him Rector wrote not a word:\n\nIn pursuance of which purpose on our part, we, the said Bishop, did on the 5th day of April, 1897, promulge a Cathedral constitution, and duly and canonically install the said John Usborne a Canon of our Cathedral Church, he first making declarations as follows:\n\n\"I will be faithful to this Church of Honolulu, and to the Bishop and chapter of the same Church; I will observe and keep all the statutes, regulations, ordinances, rules, and customs of the same * * * * the rights of this Cathedral Church I will defend nor will I give any assistance, advice, or encouragement to any person or persons whatsoever who shall or will endeavor to violate or [23/24] infringe the same,\" and after his installation promising obedience to the Bishop as Dean of the said church:\n\nAnd on the same 5th day of April, 1897 in order to commit to the said John Usborne cure of souls and parochial administration in the City of Honolulu, although this was no part of any previous agreement, we, the said Bishop did at his urgent request give him the title and style of Rector, instituting him Rector of the Parish Church of St. Andrew, such institution having no power to make him a \"corporation sole,\" all freehold rights in the property of the Anglican Church in the Islands, being vested in the \"Trustees of the Anglican Church in Hawaii\" and should any action at law arise touching the property of the Church, the person to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded is the said Board of Trustees in its corporate capacity; the mandate for the induction of the said John Usborne as Rector as aforesaid being issued by us on April 7th 1897.\n\nAnd further fully confiding in the integrity and fidelity of the said John Usborne, we, the said Bishop, did on the 8th day of April, 1807. commission him to be our Commissary during our absence from the Diocese to attend the Lambeth Conference:\n\nBe it further known that on or about the 12th day of March, 1898, a Pamphlet was circulated in the city of Honolulu by the said John Usborne, a copy of which was sent us through the mail entitled Two Letters re the Anglican Church in Hawaii, signed \"your Rector, John Usborne\" and dated February 22nd, 1898, in this pamphlet he denies (p. 13) the validity of the Cathedral Constitution promulgated by the Bishop, and claims that all appointments under the said Constitution are null and void, and of no effect, and that, if valid, the said constitution took from him all his Rectorial rights, stating as follows:\n\n(a) On page 13, that the Cathedral constitution given and accepted on April 5th \"took from me all my Rectorial rights,\" which did not then exist, for the mandate for his induction was not issued till April 7th, and as will hereafter appear he has not read himself in:\n\n(b) Again on page 13--\"as a matter of fact, if I may judge from various Ecclesiastical legal lights, there is [24/25] no St. Andrew's Dean and Chapter at all and no Constitution :\"\n\n(c) And again on page 20--\"in my opinion our Dean and Chapter is not a legal body, and in fact does not exist. There is no Dean and there is no Chapter, and St. Andrew's is the Parish Church and no more:\"\n\nIn which belief he states on page 17, that he has \"laid before his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury the question of the legality of our Cathedral organization and Constitution,\" a step on the part of the said John Usborne, of which we had no previous information till we read above statement:\n\nBe it further known that instead of waiting for any reply from his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, the said John Usborne has proceeded to act as if his own opinion were already established, as if there were no Cathedral constitution, no Dean and Chapter, and as if the actual possession of St. Andrew's Church were vested in himself as Rector, together with a lien on all money contributed for the support of the said Church either at the Offertory, or by means of subscriptions, and caused to issue on March nth the following injunction to the Wardens of our Cathedral Church:\n\nCECIL BROWN. Attorney-at-law.\n\n(COPY.)\n\nHonolulu, H. I., March 11, 1898.\n\nED. STILES, ESQ.,\n\nH. SMITH, ESQ., Church Wardens:\n\nAs Attorney for the Rev. John Usborne, who claims that the Dean and Chapter of St. Andrew's Cathedral is not a lawfully constituted body, and therefore has no control over the affairs of said Church, and that, therefore, he, as Rector of said Church, it being the Parish Church, is entitled to the full control thereof.\n\nI now notify you, and each of you, to hold all monies now in hand, or that you, or either of you, may hereafter [25/26] receive on account of said Church through offertories, subscriptions, or in any other manner, and under no consideration whatever to pay over to any person or persons-or disburse any portion of said monies now held or to be hereafter received as aforesaid, until such time as it has been decided by the proper authorities in England who is entitled to receive the same.\n\nAnd I further notify you that upon failure to comply with the foregoing, you, and each of you, will be held personally responsible for all such monies now in or hereafter coming into your possession or under your control, as such Church Wardens as aforesaid.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCECIL BROWN.\n\nBy which injunction the said John Usborne first releases himself from all obligation to observe the Cathedral Constitution and defend the rights of the Cathedral, and, secondly, endeavours to set in motion a civil process-which, if carried out, could have no other effect than to cause the Divine Service to cease in our Cathedral Church to the dishonour of God, and the scandal and offense of all Christian people: for no authority in England or elsewhere, out of the Diocese, having any jurisdiction in the premises, no salaries and no expenses of Divine Service could henceforth be paid:\n\nThe said injunction, moreover, being in open and direct defiance of the laws of the Church, which enact in the Rubric after the order for the Holy Communion, that \"the money given at the Offertory shall be disposed of to such pious and charitable uses as the Minister and Church Wardens shall think fit, wherein if they disagree it shall be disposed of as the Ordinary shall appoint.\" Which rubric estops any questions regarding the money given at the Offertory from being carried out of the Diocese, or into any court of law in the Diocese; the decision of the Ordinary is to be final, and the Ordinary in this case is the Bishop.\n\nBE IT KNOWN FURTHER, that after causing the injunction aforesaid to issue on the 11th day of March, [26/27] 1898 he, the said John Usborne, wrote to us on the 15th day of March, 1898, as follows: \"On reading up Ecclesiastical law lately, I have become aware that it is necessary in England for a Rector to go through the form of publicly reading the 39 Articles and assenting to the same * * * * * I should feel obliged by your appointing a day when I may do this;'' by which words he admits that on the 11th day of March, 1898, when he caused the injunction aforesaid to issue in his name as Rector, he was no lawful Rector at all, he not having \"read himself in,\" a qualification as necessary for the validity of his appointment as Rector in this Diocese as it is in England.\n\nNow, therefore, by reason of the premises aforesaid, and for divers other reasons, We, Alfred, by Divine permission, Bishop of Honolulu, do, by these Presents, by virtue of our Episcopal authority, pronounce and declare as follows: That our institution of the said John Usborne as Rector of St. Andrews' Parish Church, is now and ever has been without qualification, that said appointment is null and void and of no effect; and, further, that by releasing himself from all obligation to observe and keep the statutes of the Cathedral, which he bound himself to observe and keep at his installation as Canon, and by setting himself to violate and infringe the rights of our Cathedral Church as if it were no Cathedral, and there were no Cathedral Constitution, he has annulled all claim to continue to hold the Canonical Stall to which we duly installed him with the office of Vice-Dean, and we now declare that the said Canonical Stall is vacant, and that all instruments whatsoever given under our hand and seal giving the said John Usborne our authority and license to have cure of souls, minister or officiate, whether as Canon, Vice-Dean or Rector, or in any other manner whatsoever within our Diocese and jurisdiction, are null and void and of no effect.\n\nGiven under our hand and seal in the Chapter-house of our Cathedral Church, in presence of our Chapter, on the thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, and of our Consecration the twenty-seventh.\n\nALFRED HONOLULU. (Seal.)\n\n[28] This is to Certify that the within notification, was this day duly recorded in the Hawaiian Diocesan Registry in Honolulu, H. I., March 31, 1898.\n\nP. JONES, Registrar.\n\nThis is a very long document, but if it be carefully read it will be found to contain not one valid charge against Mr. Usborne.\n\nThere being no tribunal to which to appeal, three courses were now open to Mr. Usborne.\n\n1st. To leave the Diocese disgraced, although innocent of the violation of a single canon.\n\n2nd. To invoke the law and continue to officiate in the Cathedral in defiance of the Bishop.\n\n3rd. To open St. Clement's Chapel, and as Rector use it as his Parish Church until relief could be found.\n\nHe chose the last and on Easter morning, 1898, opened St. Clement's Chapel with the Holy Communion, and with a good congregation. And there he has regularly officiated since, except during the absence referred to.\n\nSt. Clement's is a handsome property of 1 1-3 acre in a part of the town recently become very popular as a residential suburb. On it stands the Chapel, which is small, seating about one hundred persons and a commodious Rectory, built last year. Its total value is about $20,000.\n\nIn March 1899, the Bishop wrote to the Revs. E. A. Renouf, D. D., and E. J. H. Van Deerlin, who were both in Honolulu at the time, as follows:\n\n\"I gladly accept the offer of your kindly offices to put before them (the Trustees of St. Clement's Chapel) the situation as it stands today.\n\n\"By Hawaiian law, no property is regarded as belonging to the Anglican Church, but such as is in the hands of the Incorporated Board of Trustees.\n\n\"What is really required is its (St. Clement's) transfer to the Incorporated Board of Trustees.\n\n\"As soon as the present obstacles are removed I shall be able and ready to license Mr. Usborne to St. Clement's Church and assign a District to it subject of [28/29] course, to the final ratification of boundaries by the Synod.\"\n\nAn attempt was made to meet the Bishop's views, but was futile.\n\nIt would seem strange that if Mr. Usborne had separated himself from the Anglican Church and founded a new sect in 1897, as the Bishop states, that the Bishop should, in this letter of date 9th March, 1899, have offered to acknowledge, and receive him into his Diocese, as a priest in good standing and license him to a Church.\n\nIt is also strange that the Bishop should have allowed Mr. Usborne to officiate in the Cathedral, up to March 1898, at which date Mr. Usborne was suspended, if Mr. Usborne had seceded from the Church the previous year.\n\nIt would appear by the following letter that the Bishop must have recognized Mr. Usborne as a priest of the Anglican Church as late as March 1899.\n\nHonolulu, March 11, 1899.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Usborne.\n\nAll the Clergy of the Anglican Church in the city being invited to take part in the State Funeral tomorrow, a place is arranged for you in the procession and on the platform at Kawaiahao Church.\n\nYou should be at St. Andrew's Cathedral, vested, by 1:30 p. m. Violet Stoles will be worn.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n(Signed) ALFRED HONOLULU.\n\nBut as late as 9th March, 1900, it seems the Bishop would have received Mr. Usborne into his Diocese as a priest in good standing and assigned him to a Church as expressed in his letter below of that date.\n\nThese successive offers of the Bishop to acknowledge and accept Mr. Usborne as a priest of the Anglican [29/30] Church in good standing, render it quite unintelligible, how he could at the same time, have regarded Mr. Usborne as a Schismatic and the founder of a new sect in 1897.\n\nThe following correspondence is given to show that the Trustees of St. Clement's Chapel and its congregation have always and do now, regard themselves as loyal churchmen of the Anglican Church of Hawaii, and have always desired the Bishop to view them as staunch supporters of their Church and lawfully administered Episcopal authority.\n\nHonolulu, March 9, 1900.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Usborne.\n\nI do not know whether you really wish to bring your church and congregation into harmony with our Diocesan system, but hoping that to be the case, and seeing that the question of the demise of the property was originally the principal factor in placeing you in your present position, which is not less injurious to yourself than it is to the whole Church, I write this to point out that under certain safeguards I now find it possible to concede a point for which you contended.\n\nYour contention was that it is nowhere laid down that Church property must be conveyed to the Incorporated Trustees; to which my reply has been that only in the hands of the Board of Trustees is there perfect security that a Church will be subject to the Constitution and Statutes of the Diocese. As yet we have no statute providing for the Incorporation of Parishes, and until we have arrived at that point, I still hold it to be ordinarily the duty of the Bishop to refuse to recognize any edifice as a Church of the Diocese, unless the site is held by the Incorporated Trustees. In this particular case, however, I am willing to strain a point, if thereby your congregation can be brought into harmony with our Diocesan system. And if you and your co-trustees are unable for any reason to transfer the property to the Trustees of the Anglican Church in Hawaii, and desire to create a [30/31] separate trust, I am ready to consent to such a course, provided there be inserted in your Trust Deed a clause similar to one found in the Trust Deed of every Parish in California that the property \"shall be forever held under the Ecclesiastical authority of the Bishop of Honolulu and of his successors in Office, and subject to the Constitution of the Anglican Church in Hawaii, and to all Statutes and Regulations now in force or that shall be hereafter enacted,\" a certified copy of the said Trust Deed being deposited in the Diocesan Registry. If this receives your consent, and the consent of your co-Trustees, the difficulty in the way of my accepting the church you have built will be removed, the territorial limits of the district for which it will be the Church will be laid down in the deed of Consecration, you will be appointed thereto, and St. Clement's will be entitled to representation in Diocesan Synod.\n\nIn making this proposal I am doing all that can be done on my part to bring about peace and harmony in the Diocese, and I trust that it will meet with your cordial acceptance, and that of your co-Trustees.\n\nRequesting an early reply,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n(Signed.) ALFRED HONOLULU.\n\nP. S.--I send a copy of this to Mr. T. R. Walker.\n\nA. H.\n\nIt will be recognized at once that since there was no canon regulating the vesting of property, its temporal control could not affect the spiritual position of either incumbent or congregation.\n\nMoreover, the Bishop makes no allusion to Mr. Usborne's being reinstated Rector of Honolulu.\n\nThe fact of the Bishop's holding certain views as to a bishop's duty and which were unknown to other people, in no wise made such views law, unless defined by canon. ''Cripps\" says: \"The oath of canonical obedience does not [31/32] mean that the clergymen will obey all commands of the bishop against which there is no law, but that he will obey all such commands as the bishop by law is authorized to impose.\"\n\nThe incorporation in the trust deed of the clause suggested by the Bishop, would have made St. Clement's Chapel Anglican Church property forever. And his Lordship would probably have passed at the first Synod, a statute that would have the effect of placing this property in his own possession.\n\nHonolulu, April 18th, 1900.\n\nMy Dear Bishop.\n\nI beg now to make further acknowledgement of the receipt of your letter of March 9th, on the subject of your correspondence with the Rev. John Usborne respecting the Trust of the property held by him with Mr. May and myself. I have assumed your permission to confer fully in the matter with Mr. May as my co-trustee, and I now write in expression of his opinion alike with my own.\n\nIt is to our mind quite certain that, when the idea assumed practical shape with us of endeavouring to establish a mission-chapel in the Punahou District, Mr. Usborne and we hoped that the proposed extension of work would be in the form of a branch and off-shoot of the church of which he had been appointed Rector.\n\nIt is equally certain that no considerable response met this effort without an accompanying condition that such property as might be acquired for the purpose should be vested, as to ownership, in a trust separate from that of the Diocesan Trustees, although having the same general objects as those of the latter body. We therefore considered it our loyal duty, in the interests of the whole Church, to accept this separate trust. Had we refused, or even postponed, acceptance of such an opportunity as was then offered, we do not think that it would soon again have occurred.\n\n[33] Although we have not questioned in any way the Ecclesiastical authority of the Bishop of the Diocese, we do not see that we can, in good faith towards the donors who have placed us in trust, submit the property to the eventual control of a synodical body the members of which I think are in many instances not well acquainted with the circumstances of our case and with the earnest desire for the welfare of the whole Church in Hawaii which has led to the establishment of our trust; and we are aware that some of the said donors would be strongly opposed to our taking this course under all the circumstances alluded to.\n\nWe are therefore compelled to say that we do not deem it to be to the interests of the Church that the present status of St. Clement's should be changed on the lines suggested in your letter of March 9th.\n\nI remain, my dear Bishop,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) THOMAS RAIN WALKER.\n\nThe Right Rev.\n\nThe Bishop of Honolulu,\n\nHonolulu, April 26th, 1900.\n\nMy Dear Lord Bishop.\n\nIn acknowledging your letter of 9th March, I stated that I should lay it before my co-trustees for consideration. This I have done and I have delayed writing further until they had written you. I think it is much better and more straight forward to state very plainly, why we as Trustees of St. Clement's property must refuse to comply with your suggestion. Your Lordship's record of nearly thirty years shows conclusively that disaster, discord and failure have followed every work you have controlled in this city and forbids our reposing in you that confidence we could wish, we therefore dare not [33/34] trust to your care a fuller control of this property than the law requires. In the face of devoted work on my own part and that of a considerable number of faithful people, you have continuously striven for two years to crush this Chapel and its work, merely because you could not get control of the property, while there exists no canon or law requiring that either you or your Board of Trustees should control it. After due consideration we are convinced that if we were to carry out your wishes disaster would soon follow and our work be lost. Your Lordship must be aware of the fact that church people in this city will neither work for, or interest themselves in, any matter controlled by yourself.\n\nYou suggest as a consideration for our acceptance of your suggestion, the appointment of myself as Rector of a new Parish of St. Clement's. As I am already Rector of the whole Parish this could not be done; but even so, if you saw fit to go through the form of depriving me of my rights in my Parish Church of St. Andrew, without cause or trial, you would very possibly repeat that action in St. Clement's, for your Lordship recognizes no law further than suits jour purpose, and there is no method to compel you to do so, or appeal.\n\nWhen you ask that \"Episcopal authority\" in St. Clement's be secured to the Bishop of the Diocese, may I enquire what jurisdiction you wish to exercise more than you do now?\n\nWe do now, and always have granted and yielded you true and lawful obedience as Bishop, and all the rights and privileges due any Anglican Bishop, by a Rector or a Church. We heartily invite you to visit us although you will not acknowledge us. If your Lordship will, show us where we have acted unlawfully or even unwisely we will gladly make amends. Our Chapel is healthy, well conducted, active and aggressive, its guilds and classes are vigorous, its services hearty and well attended, the truth is preached and the Sacraments lawfully administered and harmony reigns supreme, I think I may say for the first time almost in the history of the Church in Honolulu since your Lordship's advent. What more would you have? We wish above all things for the Bishop's presence, the Episcopal blessing and for [34/35] confirmation. What have we done that my people should be refused Confirmation? St. Clement's was built with your knowledge, you were duly notified of every step that was taken and by your persistent silence you gave your consent. It was built by your own Commissary and the Rector of the Parish, who had a perfect right to build it even without your knowledge, and to vest it as they thought fit. Every canon of your Diocese such as they are, was complied with. It is served by the lawful Rector of the Parish. It was built for, and intended to be a Mission of St. Andrew's Cathedral, but this intention you yourself frustrated by refusing to have it so. You made no objection to this Chapel whatever until after it was completed, then you demanded the title Deeds to be transferred to yourself or your Board of Trustees, which is the same thing since you control that Board. I acquiesced at once, providing of course, that your Trustees assume the liability of the unpaid purchase money, resting on the property, which was secured by the personal promissory note of my co-trustees and myself. This you refused to assume, which was utterly unreasonable. Then to force us to relinquish our trust you refused to acknowledge the Chapel, you malign myself through your Diocesan Magazine and attempt to deprive me of my benefice, thinking, no doubt, that I would leave the Diocese as other Clergy have under equally distressing circumstances.\n\nEAST END OF ST. CLEMENTS CHAPEL. NORTH END--THE VESTRIES.\n\nYour whole action in this matter, my Lord, would be pronounced by any judge as an unjustifiable and relentless persecution.\n\nI was unlawfully restrained from officiating in my Parish Church of St. Andrew, which I accepted rather than augment the standing scandal in the Church b^ enforcing my rights by course of law or otherwise, and as the lawful Rector of this Parish, I opened St. Clement's Chapel (which I heretofore had refrained from doing in deference to your wishes) and used it as my Parish Church for the time being, which I hold I was justified in doing. For this you publish us as being schismatics, and refuse my people Confirmation and Holy Communion; yet you offer to receive myself and St. Clement's into good standing in your Diocese provided the Deeds [35/36] are transferred to your Trustees, which would make it appear that our schism really consists in our refusing to oblige your Lordship in a matter of real estate.\n\nHave we torn away from the Church or left it, or have we been ejected? A schism is a rent in the Church, but it appears to me that he who makes the rent is the schismatic.\n\nWith regard to your claim that this property would be more safely secured to the Church, vested in your Trustees than in the present Trustees, we do not agree with you. Your charter provides that your Trustees may rent or sell any Church property held by them, at will. Why then would it be safer in their hands? We are very much more interested in this property than the}- are. Had there been any canon providing that all Church property must be, or even should be vested in them, St. Clement's would have been so vested, but there is not, and in vesting this property outside the Board of Trustees we only followed your own example when you vested the Barns bequest in yourself, instead of the Board of Trustees.\n\nYou don't truly seek Episcopal authority in St. Clement's for that has never been denied you. You seek the authority of the Rector, the Church Wardens and the Vestry, and this you can only obtain and exercise, whether lawfully or unlawfully, by controlling the property itself, either by holding the Deeds or by the insertion in the Deed of such a clause as you propose, placing the property under the \"Episcopal authority\" of the Bishop, while there is no canon to define the meaning of the words \"Episcopal authority'\" and you unaided will be judge and interpreter; but past experience shows us that your interpretation of \"Episcopal authority\" is absolute authority, autocratic authority in everything, from the appointing of the Sexton to the summary dismissal of the Rector, at will.\n\nSuch action on the part of our Trustees as you suggest, would mean a clashing of powers in St. Clement's at once and the ultimate dissolution and ruin of our Church. St. Clement's is now a much stronger congregation than your own Cathedral congregation, numerically, financially, in its work, school, organization and importance.\n\nRECTORY FROM THE TENNIS COURT INTERIOR\n\n[37] We must firmly decline to destroy this promising work. We are quite willing to accord you as Bishop all lawful obedience and jurisdiction, as indeed we always have done but my co-trustees and myself are of the firm opinion that the trust deeds must remain as they are. You cannot compare this Diocese with California. An American Bishop must answer to his peers for his wrong doing, you are answerable to no one. This makes all the difference.\n\nMy Lord, I should not venture to write to you with this freedom had I not stipulated with you before I came here or took office in your Diocese, that I might do so. Somewhat fearing difference of opinion with you you will remember my stipulation that should occasion arise, the great gulf between the Bishop and the Priest must be abolished and I should have the privilege of addressing you as a brother, which I now do. It is my last wish to say anything offensive or that would unnecessarily hurt your feelings, but I feel that you have done myself, my people and the Church an irreparable wrong and it is better you should know how we view it.\n\nWe are in no sense contumacious. We accord every reverence to your Holy Office. We are a law abiding and loyal congregation to the Church, and although you seem to wish to draw us into the general Church quarrel, we are in no way responsible or mixed up with it; that stands much as it did fifteen or twenty years ago. St. Clement's is really the only peaceful piece of Church work that has been done in Honolulu during your Episcopate. My dear Bishop, you must not expect men to follow you blindly, whether right or wrong, because you are the Bishop; they will not submit to sink their manhood or their conscience to gratify your love of power. Forgive me if I remind you that during the three years that I have been here, you have had no less than five head masters in your school. Three from England, one from Australia and your own Chaplain. Of these one has died, and three have resigned under most painful circumstances, and it has been much the same with your Clergy. It is not encouraging to men who want to do their work faithfully. Never was there a fairer field, nor [37/38] do I think there ever was more unhappiness or wretchedness in the Church, or a more complete failure.\n\nBelieve me my dear Bishop, Respectfully yours,\n\n(Signed) JOHN USBORNE.\n\nP. S.--I may say that I have not yet shown this letter to either of my co-Trustees. This letter was not answered.\n\nHonolulu, May 7th, 1900.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Walker.\n\nIn your letter of April 18th, the receipt of which I have already acknowledged, you have given the definite reply of the Trustees of the Church in the Punahou district, styled St. Clement's to my letter of March 9th.\n\nAfter more than a month's consideration you have decided you cannot accept the Constitution of the Anglican Church in Hawaii, and so bring this church and congregation into harmony with the branch of the Anglican Church in these Islands.\n\nAll doubt as to Mr. Usborne's position and the position of the church at Punahou is now dispelled. It is made plain by your letter that from the very first inception of a plan for erecting a church in the Punahou district the Rev. Mr. Usborne has been engaged in making a schism in the Anglican Church in Hawaii. Your testimony is conclusive that the idea of a church being built in the Punahou district as a mission church of the Cathedral was abandoned long before the church was commenced, contributions being accepted on the condition that the property should not be held under the same trust as the Cathedral, nor be subject to the Diocesan Synod; and this at a date when Mr. Usborne was not [38/39] only regarded as Rector of St. Andrew's, but, as my Commissary, was my representative on the governing body of the Anglican Church.\n\nFor here you must permit me to point out that if the conditions imposed on you by the donors be fully stated in the third paragraph of your letter, and it was desired that the trust to be created should have \"the same general objects\" as those of the Diocesan Trustees, no objection could possibly have arisen to the insertion in the Trust Deed of the clause proposed in my letter of March 9th.\n\nBut when in the next paragraph you state that it would be a breach of faith with the donors for the property to be subject to the control of the Diocesan Synod, you make it plain that the Trust created has not the same general objects as those of the Diocesan Trustees, the general objects of their Trust lying within, and being coextensive with the limits of the Constitution represented by the Diocesan Synod while the objects of your Trust lie outside those limits.\n\nFurther, your statement that you have not questioned in any way the ecclesiastical authority of the Bishop is not in accordance with the facts of the case. For two years the Trustees of the church called St. Clement's have-usurped episcopal authority. It is by their authority and no other that for a period of two years Mr. Usborne has conducted public worship and administered the Sacraments in a building not licensed by the Bishop, and has appointed lay readers to officiate in his absence. By so doing they have erected altar against altar in the Cathedral Parish of St. Andrew's. Nor would this be otherwise, if the Rev. Mr. Usborne's claim to be Rector of St.. Andrew's could be maintained, for no clergyman whatever his status may be can erect a church and proceed to officiate and administer the Sacraments therein without the license of the Bishop. To do so is to usurp the ecclesiastical authority of the Diocese, and this is what the Trustees of St. Clement's, have done.\n\nNotwithstanding this schismatic attitude of the Rev. Mr. Usborne and his cotrustees, I have continued to entertain the hope that ignorance of Church principles might be pleaded on their behalf, and that they were not [39/40] chargeable with an overt act of schism.\n\nYour letter dispels this hope. You furnish on your own testimony and that of Mr. May direct evidence that the intentions, with which the church at Punahou was erected, was that it should be not only independent of the Diocesan Trustees, but separate also from the Constitution of the Anglican Church in Hawaii, of which the Diocesan Synod is the Representative Governing body, under which members of the Anglican Church in these Islands are united by voluntary compact as a branch of the Anglican Church.\n\nSo recently as November of last year a protest was made by the Rev. Mr. Usborne and yourself that the meeting of the Diocesan Synod could not be constitutionally held because St. Clement's was unrepresented, and Mr. Usborne was not invited. Though unable to regard the protest, the Synod passed a resolution looking to the removal of your present disabilities. But you refused to confer with the Standing Committee as such.\n\nAnd now it is explained that you cannot acknowledge the authority of the Synod without breaking faith with the contributors of funds by which the church in question was built.\n\nThis position is an impossible one to maintain. No one can claim the right of representation in a governing body and at the same time repudiate its authority. In this country the Anglican Communion is a purely voluntary association, governing itself by means of the Diocesan Synod. No one is obliged to belong to it. But every one claiming membership, and every organization claiming' union with it, is bound to acknowledge the authority of its governing body.\n\nMy letter opened to you a way by which you could place the organization of St. Clement's in union with the Anglican Church in Hawaii. You reply that the church you have built cannot be placed under the control of the Diocesan Synod. This is final. Neither the Bishop nor the Synod can do more than they have done to bring your organization into union with the Church. Of course it is open to you and Mr. Usborne to recede from this position. Otherwise nothing remains but for me to issue a declaration to the whole Anglican Communion of the [40/41] position now definitely taken by the Rev. Mr. Usborne and his co-Trustees.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n(Signed) ALFRED HONOLULU.\n\nT. R. WALKER, ESQ.\n\nThe reader must judge as to the soundness of the arguments in this letter, in answer to that of Mr. Walker.\n\nThe Trustees and Representatives of St. Clement's did confer with the so-called Standing Committee, with a view of meeting the Bishop's wishes, but their \"sine qua non\" was that the Rector of Honolulu be reinstated, which was refused.\n\nHonolulu, 11th June, 1900.\n\nMy Dear Bishop:\n\nWith your permission, I will once more refer to your letter of the 9th of March last. On receiving and reading this letter, I laid it aside to answer later, when I wished to do so I found I had mislaid it and therefore had to reply to it from memory. Having now found it and seeing one or two points I had not touched upon, I beg to be allowed to do so now.\n\nYou say \"the demise of the property was originally the principal factor in placing you in your present position.\"\n\nIn your document placing me in my present position, under date 31st of March, 1898, you tell me it is because I disagree with you as to the legality of your Dean and Chapter organization, and because I had failed to \"read in.\"\n\nIf I owe my \"present position,\" which you recognize as being as injurious to myself as it is to the Church, to [41/42] the vesting of property as you say I do, then you have placed me in that position for monetary reasons and not for any ecclesiastical offense, which is unlawful.\n\nYou say with regard to the vesting of Church property \"only in the hands of the Board of Trustees is there perfect security that a Church will be subject to the Constitution and Statutes of the Diocese.\"'\n\nThis security, you hold, is in the Board of Trustees controlling the Church, but the property in question which you have demanded to be transferred to the Board of Trustees, had no Church upon it. It was but a vacant lot, occupied by a Portuguese under a long lease.\n\nWe had purchased it as a Church site, but had not built upon it, nor could we get possession for two years. On your own showing there could have been no necessity for the Board of Trustees to hold this property until, at least there was a Church building upon if, yet you say that our failure to transfer this property was the initial cause of my being placed in my present position. We only moved the Chapel on to this lot last November, more than a year and a half after you had attempted to deprive me of my Rectory, and you did not ask for the transfer of the lot on which the Chapel actually stood, it being leased but which only could have been of any use to the Trustees, had they the power you claim for them, or had there been occasion to use it.\n\nFor myself, I fail to see how the Board of Trustees can in any way affect the observance of the Constitution of either Priests or people or how it can compel obedience of, or give any security that the Constitution will be observed by any Church. If it does, it should not do so. Your own Cathedral of St. Andrew is not held in trust by the Board of Trustees, why should it be more necessary for St. Clement's? If the Board of Trustees have any title to the Cathedral property, which is very questionable, it is held by it in fee simple, not in trust for any Church.\n\nWith regard to your letter to Mr. Walker, under date 7th May, I will take the liberty of referring to it, since my actions seem to enter largely into it. Mr. Walker will no doubt reply to it himself.\n\n[43] In the third clause you make some rash assertions. You say \"it is made plain by your letter that from the very first inception of a plan for erecting a Church in the Punahou district, the Rev. Mr. Usborne has been engaged in making a schism in the Anglican Church in Hawaii.\" This, Bishop, is a statement not borne out by facts, nor is any such thing ''made plain\" nor yet hinted at, in Mr. Walker's letter. Only yourself could draw testimony from Mr. Walker's letter that the idea of the Chapel being a Mission Chapel was ever abandoned.\n\nI certainly did sanction the vesting of our property in a Trust other than the Board of Trustees, in which I was quite justified, firstly because it made no difference, or should have made no difference whatever in whom it was vested, providing the Trustees were honourable and responsible men and communicants, and secondly because there would have been no St. Clement's or property either, were it to be in the hands of the Board of Trustees. I did not see a vestage of reason why it should not be so vested. Your twenty-five years struggle in this Diocese must have taught you, my Lord, that the people will have nothing to do with any thing controlled by yourself. It is useless to beat about the bush. You know the truth as well as I. The Synod controls the Hoard of Trustees, and you control the Synod, therefore the Board of Trustees as well as the Synod, is your creature, and what they hold, you hold, by this means you exercise powers you have no right to exercise, unlawful, unjust, and oppressive powers, and the people, if they must submit because there is no recourse, will not aid you. Bishop, you would not have dared to have acted with me as you have, had there been a court in this world before which you could have been brought. You have no right to hold property for any such purpose as you say, it can mean but one thing--that it gives you civil authority to close the Church or sell property if the Clergyman is offensive to you, or it suits your purpose. If coercive authority over the Clergy or people has not been conferred on you by England, you have no right to seek it by other methods, but you are determined to control. Again, you say that contributions were received [43/44] towards this Chapel \"on condition that the property should not be subject to the Diocesan Synod.\" This is not in accordance with facts. I solicited all subscriptions for this Chapel. The word \"Synod\" was never once used either by or to me, during my canvass. Mr. Walker makes use of the words \"Synodical body,\" which you, with characteristic ease, transform into Diocesan Synod. It is the Board of Trustees appointed by the Synod, which is the \"Synodical body\" which we refuse to allow to control St. Clement's property, the Diocesan Synod could not, as it is not an incorporated body. In any case, Mr. Walker does not say that the Church shall not be subject to it, but that we could not submit the property to its control, a very different thing.\n\nMy Lord, your charges of my being engaged in making a. schism from the beginning, of the abandonment of the mission in favour of an independent Chapel, of the repudiating of the authority of the Synod, and that, while I was Rector of St. Andrew's and your Commissary, thereby implying a gross breach of faith on my part, are without foundation and unworthy of comment. If you would not let your hatred of myself blind your reason, you would see that such a course would have been much against my own interests, for why should I, the Rector of St. Andrew's and the whole city of Honolulu, and your Commissary too, enter into the unenviable piece of work of building a little independent Chapel, out of town, in which to officiate and thereby cut myself off from my own Church, when as a Mission, it would be equally under my control as Rector? It appears to me to be unreasonable on the face of it.\n\nReferring to the sixth clause of your letter, it cannot be said by any stretch of imagination that I officiate in St. Clement's by the authority of my cotrustees \"and no other.\" I officiate there, Bishop on your own authority, and no other, by virtue of your own institution of myself as Rector of this Parish, and the power does not exist to change that, until I deserve it, which you know. You say, in any case, the Chapel requires to be licensed by the Bishop before the Rector can officiate therein. By what canon or statute, can you say this? We have no canon or statute requiring a license in such a case. Even so, a [44/45] Bishop must show some reason for refusing to license a Chapel he has permitted the people to build. You have driven me either to officiate here, or to make an unseemly disturbance in my Parish Church by ignoring your unlawful action and proceeding with my work, rather than do this I have retired to my Chapel to await developments. You could not have expected me to leave my Parish on such a cause, or give up my work.\n\nWith regard to that portion of your letter in which you deny that the general objects of this trust were the same as those of the Board of Trustees, or we could have no objection to the insertion in the Trust Deed of the clause you propose. The objects were the same when the trust was created, but since then Hawaii has become a part of the United States, and we could not insert, as you wish, any clause in the Trust Deed promising allegiance to the Episcopal authority of the Anglican Church forever, when we hope in the very near future, to extend that allegiance to the Church in America.\n\nAs to the last clause, you say that unless we as Trustees recede from the position taken by us, \"nothing remains but for me to issue a declaration to the whole Anglican Communion of the definite position now taken by the Rev. Mr. Usborne and his cotrustees,\" which to my mind savours very much of blackmail, because were we ever so guilty, there would be no occasion for such publicity being given to a wretched scandal in the Church-However, my Lord, you must do as you think best in this matter, we, as Trustees, cannot recede, our position is one that any right minded men would have taken and we feel it is to be for the ultimate good of the Church.\n\nI repeat, we accord to you in St. Clement's all Episcopal jurisdiction. We are all loyal to the Episcopate and to the Church and we stand by and obey the Constitution, the Canons and the Statutes of the Diocese, no church can be asked or expected to do more.\n\nBefore closing this letter, I must protest against your attempt to drag St. Clement's before the public, as a schismatic Church. The contention is preposterous. As a Bishop, you cannot be right in attempting to destroy the legitimate work of any church in your Diocese [45/46] because of the existence of a difference of opinion in temporal matters.\n\nI am,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Signed) JOHN USBORNE.\n\nTHE RT. REV.\n\nTHE BISHOP OF HONOLULU.\n\nThis letter was not answered.\n\nMy Dear Lord Bishop:\n\nHonolulu, 20th August, 1900.\n\nYou have made two propositions to the Trustees of St. Clement's Chapel at different times, with a view of bringing St. Clement's Chapel into line with your Diocesan system, and have stated that if either were accepted you would consent to acknowledge St. Clement's as a lawful Chapel of the Diocese.\n\nAs I have already explained, both these propositions have been of such a character that my cotrustees and myself did not deem it to be in the interests of the Church to accept either.\n\nHowever, although having to decline these offers, we do not wish you to understand that we are not quite as anxious as you can be that this Chapel should be regarded by you as a legitimate Chapel of the Diocese, and that we are not willing to do all in our power to bring it within the Diocesan system, on proper lines and have it under Episcopal jurisdiction. This has always been our great wish, but with safety to the Chapel and its work.\n\nYou have stated that before you could accept this Chapel you required a \"guarantee that the Church is made Church property forever,\" or, in lieu of this, you have consented to acknowledge the Chapel, held in its present trust, on there being inserted in the Trust Deed [46/47] the following clause--that the property \"shall be forever held under the ecclesiastical authority of the Bishop of Honolulu and of his successors in office, and subject to the Constitution of the Anglican Church in Hawaii, and to all statutes and regulations now in force or that shall be hereafter enacted.\"\n\nI think I am correct in saying that my cotrustees fully agree with me in that since we have been unable to accept your propositions, it is but right that we should show our willingness and our desire to overcome the difficulties you have raised, as far as possible, and with that end in view I beg to submit for your consideration a proposal, which I think will meet all your requirements.\n\nI am prepared to do either of two things.\n\n1st. To transfer St. Clement's property, as it stands, to the Presiding Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the U. S. A. to be held by him in trust for the Anglican Church in Hawaii, under its present Constitution, statutes and canons, until such time as the American Church takes charge of the Church in this country, after which date it shall be held for the American Church, or\n\n2nd. To incorporate in our present Trust Deed a clause such as you propose, slightly modified, viz.: That the \"property shall be forever held under the lawful Episcopal authority of the Bishop of this Diocese and of his successors in office, and subject to the Constitution, the statutes and regulations of the Anglican Church in Hawaii, now in force in this Diocese, until such time as the American Church takes charge of the Church in this country, after which date it shall be subject to the Constitution of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the U. S. A.\"\n\nThe Episcopal authority to be exercised shall be limited to that exercised by Bishops of the Church in their Dioceses in England and America.\n\nIn either way, this Chapel, its property and its obedience will be secured to the Church, which I understand you to say is all you require. For my own part, I do not consider it will be at all safer than it is now.\n\nIn return, you will recognize and license St. Clement's [47/48] Chapel as a lawful mission Chapel of St. Andrew's Cathedral Church, which shall be in charge of the Rector of Honolulu.\n\nYou will officially withdraw and annul all documents issued and all actions taken, of a disciplinary character, against the Rev. John Usborne.\n\nThere shall be some disinterested person, to whom all differences of opinion shall be referred, whose decision shall be final. I suggest that the Bishop of New York be asked to act as arbitrator.\n\nEither of these courses will place St. Clement's precisely in the position its promoters intended and expected it to occupy when it was built.\n\nIn your letter to Dr. Renouf and Mr. Van Deerlin on this subject, under date 9th March, 1899, you say \"The lines we have to follow are laid down in the Charter and Constitution of the Anglican Church in Hawaii.\"\n\nOn examining these documents you will see that the carrying out of either of these suggestions would be perfectly in accord with the provisions of both.\n\nYou have said in the same letter, that \"By Hawaiian law no property is regarded as belonging to the Anglican Church, but such as is in the hands of the Incorporated Board of Trustees.\"\n\nI would say that Hawaiian law recognizes any lawful deed when duly registered. The law is no respecter of persons. Any sane adult can lawfully hold any property in trust for any lawful institution, always providing there is no law forbidding it, which there is not in this case.\n\nTrusting that one or other of these conditions will meet your Lordship's favour and that you recognize the fact that we are prepared to do anything we can to further the solving of this most unhappy difficulty, always providing it can be done on just and fair lines and with the furtherance of the interests of the Church in Hawaii.\n\nI would ask you to favour me with an early reply, on receipt of which, if favourable, I shall lay the whole [48/49] matter before my co-trustees. If it is otherwise, I shall let the matter drop.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJOHN USBORNE.\n\nRT. REV.\n\nTHE BISHOP OF HONOLULU.\n\nHonolulu, August 27, 1900.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Usborne:\n\nAfter your rejection of the offer that I made you on March 9th, I am unable to recognize in your communication of August 20th, any readiness on your part to do anything to bring yourself into our Diocesan System, unless you can be admitted on terms dictated by yourself.\n\nYour letter professes to lay before me a proposal for bringing St. Clement's under Episcopal supervision, but on examination it is found to present nothing to which a reply can be formulated. For, in the first place not having been concurred in by the other Trustees of the property, it is not yet in tangible shape to be presented; and, secondly, it is so hedged about with impossible conditions, that, though concurred in by the Trustees, the path to its consideration is closed.\n\nIn my letter of March 9th, I went as far as it was possible for me to go in making the way easy for you to come into our Diocesan organization. That was refused, and it now becomes clear from the communication before me that you are not prepared to acknowledge the ecclesiastical authority of the Diocese, unless it is subject to an external authority vested in some one nominated by [49/50] yourself, so that I am reluctantly compelled to leave you where you are.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nALFRED HONOLULU.\n\nREV. JOHN USBORNE.\n\nHonolulu, 3rd September, 1900.\n\nMy Dear Bishop:\n\nYour letter of 27th August was duly received. Since you have decided that St. Clement's Chapel cannot be admitted into your Diocesan system, we, as Trustees, can do nothing but bow to your decision. The responsibility rests on you.\n\nAt the same time, I, as Rector of Honolulu, must officially notify you that St. Clement's Chapel is now and always has been held subject to your Episcopal authority, and every right and privilege extended by the Churches in either America or England to their respective Bishops, St. Clement's Chapel fully and freely extends to yourself as Bishop. It yields you, as Bishop, true and canonical obedience, it recognizes the lawful authority of the Diocesan Synod, the Board of Trustees, the Constitution of the Anglican Church in Hawaii, its canons and its statutes, and holds itself subject to these as provided by law. If there is ought else a Church should do, it is the desire of St. Clement's to observe the same. If your Lordship refuses to exercise jurisdiction therein, you alone are responsible.\n\nI have no desire whatever to dictate the terms on which St. Clement's shall be admitted into your organization, nor yet to nominate any candidate to exercise external authority, I wished merely to make some suggestion which might possibly meet your views. If you object to the Bishop of New York being asked to act as arbitrator, or the Presiding Bishop, as Trustee, I think we should be satisfied with any American Bishop.\n\n[51] With regard to my proposition not having been concurred in by my co-trustees, you are aware they are very busy men and cannot be approached on Church matters during office hours. They are advanced in years and their evenings of rest are important to them. They are now weary of conflict with you of twenty-five years standing, and have come to St. Clement's only to find peace and rest from Church turmoil, therefore, until it is necessary I prefer not to trouble them. They have confidence in my doing what is right and best, I know their views and it is not probable that there will be any difference of opinion amongst us.\n\nHad we inserted in the Deed the clause you desired, St. Clement's would have become Anglican Church property that could not have been alienated or diverted from the Anglican Church so long as you remained in the diocese and claimed it as Anglican Bishop. The amending of the Charter will arrange for the transfer of the rest of the property, but we, as Trustees, would have been bound to hold St. Clement's to your order.\n\nIt would appear that you not only do not want St. Clement's in your Diocesan System, but that you will not have it on any terms, unless it is so tied up to the Anglican Church, that you can hold it against all comers during your pleasure.\n\nOur asseverations of loyalty seem to go for nothing. You find something in every letter we write you, to make it clear that we are rebels. You seem bound to make us sinners although we have not sinned.\n\nYou punish us, by refusing the Holy Communion and Confirmation to a whole congregation, and proclaim us schismatics, not for anything we have done, but for what you refuse to do. Of all things we want a Bishop's supervision, we want his jurisdiction lawfully exercised, and we want his recognition of St. Clement's and his sympathy and his help, but these things you refuse to grant, and then you denounce us as contumacious. It is a repetition of your action in the matter of my \"reading in.\" You refused to permit me to \"read in,\" then you suspended me for not having done so.\n\n[52] The conviction is forced upon me that you permitted me, under most sacred words, to resign my Church in Toronto, to break up my home, my family and my life, that I might come out here, at great pecuniary loss, without remuneration, to take your duty in Honolulu while you attended the Lambeth Conference, deliberately intending, on your return, to make my life here so unbearable that it would be impossible for me to stay; or, at any cost, to dispose of my services.\n\nYour own Chaplain almost acknowledged as much to me when on one occasion I intimated to him my fears--he said \"your offer was too tempting to refuse.\"\n\nYou could not possibly have required two priests to assist you in the Cathedral to minister to a congregation of less than a dozen persons over and above the schools, when there was neither work or stipend for one, much less two, and no possible prospect of either. You did not want the two congregations united, except on impossible terms, which you knew the people would never accept.\n\nIt is quite clear why you tried to evade instituting me Rector and why you assured me so warmly that the Office of Vice-Dean was all that was necessary, and would give me all parochial authority I needed. While at the same time you knew that your Cathedral Constitution provided that the Office of Vice-Dean should be an annual appointment, so that at the end of twelve months you could discover that there was not sufficient work in Honolulu to warrant my remaining here, and I should not have had a single claim upon the Diocese.\n\nYour actions, almost from the time you returned to Honolulu, nearly three years ago, have formed one continuous, unreasonable and otherwise unaccountable persecution. I have not done one wrong deed of any kind, I have not even laid myself open to an excuse for a reprimand, as you well know. Had I been a profligate, you could not have taken stronger measures, and all in direct defiance of, and opposition to, the terms of England's Commission to you, and of the law of the Church in any land.\n\n[53] Bishop, I do not wish to continue this correspondence; we are much too far apart in our views of right and wrong. You say you are reluctantly compelled to leave me where I am. I am quite sure what you say is true, but until I have reason to change my mind, I shall proceed with my work at St. Clement's, which although unacknowledged by yourself, is and ever will be, I trust, loyal to the great Church and to the Episcopate.\n\nI am,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Signed) JOHN USBORNE.\n\nRT. REV.\n\nTHE BISHOP OF HONOLULU.\n\nHonolulu, March 28th. 1901.\n\nTHE RIGHT REV.\n\nTHE BISHOP OF HONOLULU.\n\nMy Lord:\n\nYour two letters of date 4th March, 1901, addressed \"To all Members of the Anglican Communion to whom these Presents may come,\" and \"To all to whom these presents may come,\" have been received.\n\nLest you should have been misinformed, and have taken the step you have in ignorance of the actual facts and of the real intentions and wishes of the Trustees of St. Clement's chapel, we think it but right to state definitely what the position of St. Clement's chapel is and what the Trustees desire.\n\nThe St. Clement's property was lawfully vested in trust for the ''Episcopal Church at large\" (which name, in the deed, is not written in capital or conspicuous letters, as your Lordship's quotation from the deed would [53/54] infer): this was done in perfect good faith and the property was intended to be held only for the use of either one or other branch of the Church, the Anglican or the American.
