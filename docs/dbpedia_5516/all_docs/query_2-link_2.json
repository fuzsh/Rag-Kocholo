The office for the Diocese of Honolulu is interchangeable with that of Vice President in the corporate world. Although the office was first included in the 1983 Code of Canon Law, the concept is much older.\n\nThe difference between \"vice president\" and \"moderator of the curia\" is that the moderator of the curia is bound with the bishop to the general principle \"that diocesan structures should always be at the service of the \"good of souls\" and that administrative demands should not take precedence over the care of persons.\n\nVery Reverend Monsignor Gary L. Secor, Vicar General, appointed\n\nModerator of the Curia\n\nIn a letter dated December 6, 2011, Bishop Larry Silva appointed Reverend Monsignor Secor as Moderator of the Curia while continuing to serve as our Vicar General."
