All decisions are to be made solely on the basis of a desire to promote the best interests of the institution and those it serves, and to avoid conflicts of interests or the appearance of conflicts of interests.\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST:A conflict of interest involves a situation in which a covered person has a significant financial or personal consideration that may compromise, or have the appearance of compromising their duty/responsibility to the organization. Only material conflicts of interest are covered under this policy. A conflict of interest is material if an ordinary person would or could reasonably be perceived as taking it into account in making a decision.

However, the potential impact of a conflict must be weighed against the useful and advantageous service that the member could provide to the University. Conflicts should be managed so as to ensure that unavoidable conflicts do not interfere with the integrity of the member’s duties in the performance of University obligations. Potential conflicts should be disclosed to ensure that such conflicts are properly reviewed and resolved.\n\nDISCLOSURE: The policy of Chaminade University requires that in the event the Covered Person must consider any transaction for the institution which also involves 1) a covered person or a related other (which shall be, for purposes of this policy, be a spouse, parent, siblings, children, grandparents and significant other, or member of his or her household or a hanai relationship) or 2) an organization with which a Covered Person is affiliated, such individual at the first knowledge of the transaction, shall disclose fully the precise nature of the interest or involvement.\n\nDisclosure is further required of Covered Persons concerning all relationships and business affiliations that reasonably could give rise to a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest involving the institution. This disclosure shall be updated at least annually or at the time of any event causing a change in a significant relationship, e.g. changes in affiliation/s. For the purpose of this policy, affiliation is understood to prevail if the Covered Person or a related other:\n\nIs an officer, director, trustee, partner, employee or agent of such organization; or\n\nIs either the actual or beneficial owner of more than 5 percent of the voting stock or control interest of such an organization, or where it involves more than 10 percent of an individual’s wealth; or\n\nHas any other direct or indirect dealing with such organization or other entity or individual from which he or she knowingly is materially benefited.\n\nAll disclosures required under this policy must be directed in writing to the Chair of the Board (for members of the Board of Chaminade University, and each non-regent committee or subcommittee member and President) or President (for members of the Hui Haku Senior Leadership Council, and members of the Provost Cabinet) who shall be responsible for the administration of this policy. Matters under this policy shall be reported to the responsible party (Chair of the Board or President for appropriate action. Information disclosed under this policy shall be held in confidence except when the best interest of the institution would be served by disclosing the information to the Board in executive session.\n\nRESTRAINT ON PARTICIPATION/RECUSAL: Covered Persons who have declared or been found to have a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest in any matter before the administration or the Board or its committees shall recuse themselves from participating in consideration of the proposed transaction, unless for special reasons the Board or administration requests information or interpretation from the person or persons involved. The Chair or appropriate official may also ask the person or persons involved to excuse themselves from the room at the time of vote or decision.\n\nIf there appears to be a direct violation of the conflict of interest policy and it has not been addressed through the existing channels, the President, or Chairperson of the Board (as appropriate) may make a determination or convene the Executive Committee to deliberate on the matter.\n\nAny Covered Person who is uncertain about a possible conflict of interest in any matter, should request the Board Chair, committee Chair, or President as appropriate, to determine whether a possible conflict exists. If need be, the Board shall resolve the question by majority vote if time permits. If unable to address the matter timely, the Covered Person should treat the matter in the same fashion as if it were a possible conflict and therefore, as noted above, refrain from participating in the consideration of the proposed transaction. When appropriate, the question of potential conflict should be referred to University counsel for an opinion prior to determination.\n\nRECORDS: Meeting Minutes or other appropriate notation shall reflect any recusals based on a conflict of interest (a direct conflict or the appearance of a conflict) and that the individual did not participate in the consideration of or vote on the matter.\n\nReviewed by PLC 10/13/09\n\nApproved by PLC 12/16/09\n\nAdopted by the Board of Regents\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nAMENDMENT OF BYLAWS\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nAMENDMENT OF BYLAWS\n\nAmendment.
