On Maui, Hawaii's Catholic Diocese has removed a priest from his parish. The priest is accused of sexually abusing a child more than twenty years ago.

The diocese in Downtown Honolulu has jurisdiction over all Catholic churches in Hawaii. It was here that the decision to remove Father Joseph Bukoski III was made.

For the last few years Bukoski served as the pastor at Maria Lanakila Church in Lahaina. In April he was accused of sexually abusing a child more than 20 years ago when he served the church in Honolulu.

Last week the church decided to relieve him of his duties. At this time Father Bukoski does not face any criminal charges.
