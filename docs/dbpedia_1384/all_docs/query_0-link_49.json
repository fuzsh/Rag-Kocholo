        "text": "[FONT=&quot]20 September[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 4 of 5\n\nin 1994 - Jule Styne/Julius Kerwin Stein dies at age 88. Vibrant English-born American composer and theatrical producer; was born at London, England, Dec. 31, 1905. Styne reversed the usual pattern for popular composers of his time: Starting his career as a full-time songwriter relatively late, in his mid-thirties, he wrote successfully for the screen, then turned to a lengthier and even more successful stay in the theater. In Hollywood he collaborated frequently with Sammy Cahn and occasionally with Frank Loesser, producing such popular movie songs of the 1940s and 1950s as &#8220;I&#8217;ve Heard That Song Before,\" \"I'll Walk Alone,\" and the Academy Award-winning \"Three Coins in the Fountain.\" On Broadway, working with Cahn, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Stephen Sondheim, and Bob Merrill, among others, he wrote the music for 16 musicals between 1947 and 1993, including Funny ...., Gypsy, and Bells Are Ringing. His shows featured such standards as \"Diamonds Are a ....'s Best Friend,\" \"Everything's Coming Up Roses,\" and \"People.\" He was particularly adept at writing for particular performers, such as stars like Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Ethel Merman, and Barbra Streisand.\n\nStyne's parents were Russian immigrants Isadore and Anna Kertman Stein; in England his father ran a butter-and-egg store, and when the family moved to Chicago in 1912, he became an egg inspector. Styne began piano lessons at six and became a prodigy. At nine he was studying with Esther Harris of the Chicago College of Music, and at nine he performed as soloist with the Chicago, Detroit, and St. Louis symphony orchestras. By his early teens, however, he had turned to popular music and begun to play in local bands. He first tried writing music at 16, and in January 1927 he enjoyed a national hit with \"Sunday,\" recorded by Cliff Edwards among others. (Music and lyrics were credited to Styne, who actually wrote the music, Ned Miller, who wrote the lyrics, Chester Conn, who polished the lyrics, and Benny Krueger, who led the band in which Styne was playing at the time and arranged for the song to be published.) He married Ethel Pauline Rubenstein in September 1927; they had two sons, and Styne later collaborated with the older one, Stanley. The couple divorced in 1952.\n\nStyne organized his own band in the spring of 1932, at which time he was forced to change the spelling of his last name to avoid a conflict with Dr. Julius Stein, head of MCA, his booking agency. In 1934 he moved to N.Y., where he became a vocal coach. Singer Harry Richman hired him as accompanist and conductor in 1936, and in 1937 he went to work at 20th Century-Fox in Hollywood as a vocal coach to such stars as Alice Faye and Shirley Temple. Soon he began contributing occasional songs to films, starting with Kentucky Moonshine, released in May 1938.In 1940 he was hired as a songwriter by Republic Pictures, a low-budget studio concerned largely with turning out B movies, mostly Westerns. He quickly amassed numerous film credits. His first movie song to attract attention was \"Who Am I?\" (lyrics by Walter Bullock) from Hit Parade of 1941, released in December 1940 and nominated for an Academy Award. Styne's music was featured in more than two dozen Republic films released in 1941. Though he did not enjoy any hits from this hastily written material, the period was notable for his first collaborations with Frank Loesser. He moved to the more prestigious Paramount studio, where Loesser worked, and they wrote two songs that became Top Ten hits before being used in the July 1942 release Sweater ....: \"I Said No!\" recorded by Alvino Rey and His Orchestra, and \"I Don't Want to Walk without You\" recorded by Harry James and His Orch. Among Styne's Republic films of the year was Sleepytime Gal,which featured \"I Don't Want Anybody at All (If I Can't Have You)\" (lyrics by Herb Magidson). The song belatedly became a minor hit for Charlie Barnet and His Orchestra in December 1944.\n\nAlso in 1942, Styne met and began to collaborate with Sammy Cahn. Their first film together was the December 1942 Republic release Youth on Parade, which featured \"I've Heard That Song Before.\" In a recording by Harry James, the song became a million-seller and the biggest hit of 1943; it was Styne's second to be nominated for an Academy Award. His third was \"A Change of Heart\" (lyrics by Harold Adamson), included in Hit Parade of 1943, which Republic released in April 1943.\n\nStyne and Cahn had an independently published Top Ten hit in January 1944 when Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters took the war-themed \"Victory Polka\" into the Top Ten. Their next hit also reflected war sentiment. &#8220;I&#8217;ll Walk Alone\" was featured in the all-star film Follow the Boys,released in April; Dinah Shore, who sang it, recorded it for a #1 hit, and it brought Styne his fourth Oscar nomination.\n\nStyne and Cahn inaugurated their songwriting relationship with Frank Sinatra by writing the songs for his July 1944 film Step Lively, but they spent much of the year working on their first stage musical, Gladto SeeYou (Philadelphia, Nov. 13, 1944), which closed during tryouts. (In June 1945, Jimmy Dorsey and His Orch. had a Top Ten hit with \"Can't You Read between the Lines?\" from the score.) They returned to film with the Kay Kyser vehicle Carolina Blues,released in December 1944, which generated two hits: \"There Goes That Song Again,\" taken into the Top Ten by Russ Morgan and His Orch., and \"Poor Little Rhode Island,\" recorded by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians and later adopted as R.I.'s state song.\n\nStyne and Cahn led off 1945 with the independently published \"Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week),\" which Frank Sinatra made into a Top Ten hit. Their next film was Tonight and EveryNight, starring Rita Hayworth, which was released in March and featured the Oscar-nominated \"Anywhere.\" Anchors Aweigh, starring Sinatra and Gene Kelly, came out in July and was one of the top grossing films of the year; its Styne/Cahn score included the hit \"What Makes the Sunset?\" recorded by Sinatra, and \"I Fall in Love Too Easily,\" which gave the songwriters a second Academy Award nomination for 1945. In November the independent song \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" went to #1 for Harry James; Bing Crosby, backed by Les Paul, also topped the charts with it.\n\nIn 1946,Styne and Cahn were the primary songwriters for four films, but all their hits for the year came with independent songs. \"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\" topped the charts for Vaughn Monroe and His Orchestra in January and went on to become a standard of the holiday season; \"Five Minutes More\" was a #1 hit for Frank Sinatra in September; and Sinatra took \"The Things We Did Last Summer\" into the Top Ten in December.\n\nStyne and Cahn wrote the songs Sinatra sang in It Happened in Brooklyn, released in March 1947. Sinatra had a Top Ten hit with \"I Believe\" and a chart entry with \"Time after Time.\" The songwriters then turned to their second stage show, High Button Shoes, which became the longest-running musical of the 1947-48 season, playing 727 performances.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Styne and Cahn signed a three-picture deal at Warner Bros. and wrote the songs for the June 1948 film Romance on the High Seas, the movie debut of Doris Day, who had a Top Ten hit with \"It's Magic,\" Styne's seventh Oscar-nominated song. Eddy Howard also had a minor hit with \"Put 'Em in a Box, Tie 'Em with a Ribbon (And Throw 'Em in the Deep Blue Sea)\" from the film. Two Guys from Texas, released in August, featured \"Ev'ry Day I Love You (Just a Little Bit More),\" a minor hit for Vaughn Monroe. It's a Great Feeling, released in August 1949, brought Styne another Academy Award nomination for its title song. From this point on Styne worked primarily in the Broadway theater, though he still did occasional film work. Sammy Cahn stayed in Hollywood, and Styne teamed with Leo Robin for his next musical, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, starring Carol Channing, which opened in the fall of 1949 for a run of 740 performances. He produced the cast album, which reached the Top Ten and featured \"Diamonds Are a ....'s Best Friend.\" Styne turned to theatrical production with the unsuccessful musical Make a Wish (N.Y., April 18, 1951), with songs by Hugh Martin; he continued to produce stage works through the 1960s, scoring successes with a revival of Pal Joey (N.Y.,Jan. 3, 1952) and Mr. Wonderful (N.Y., March 22, 1956), starring Sammy Davis Jr. His next stage effort as a composer was the revue Two on the Aisle (1951), his first collaboration with Betty Comden and Adolph Green, which ran 279 performances.\n\nThe release of the Jane Froman film biography With a Song in My Heart in April 1952 led to a revival of \"I'll Walk Alone,\" which Froman sang in the movie and recorded for a chart hit, though the most successful rendition was Don Cornell's Top Ten version. Styne's next musical, Hazel Flagg (1953), based on the film Nothing Sacred and with lyrics by Bob Hilliard, had an unprofitable run of 190 performances, but Eddie Fisher had a chart hit with \"How Do You Speak to an Angel?\" The show was adapted into the 1954 film Living It Up, starring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. The film version of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, meanwhile, was released in July 1953 and was among the most successful movies of the year; starring Marilyn Monroe, it retained only three songs from the stage version, but the soundtrack album was a Top Ten hit.\n\nStyne reunited with Sammy Cahn to write the title song for the May 1954 film Three Coins in the Fountain. Frank Sinatra sang the song on the soundtrack, but the Four Aces had the biggest hit with it, topping the charts and selling a million copies; on his ninth try, Styne finally won an Oscar with it. He had another filmrelated hit in October, when Don, .... 'n Jimmy scored with \"That's What I Like,\" which he and Bob Hilliard had written for Living It Up. That same month he and Comden and Green had half a dozen songs, among them \"Never Never Land,\" in a new musical version of Peter Pan (N.Y., Oct. 20, 1954), starring Mary Martin, which had begun with a score by Mark \"Moose\" Charlap and Carolyn Leigh. Though the show had only a modest initial run on Broadway, it had a successful television broadcast and is revived frequently. Styne's next full-fledged musical score, again with Comden and Green, was for Bells Are Ringing (1956). By the time the curtain opened for the first of the Tony nominated show's 924 performances in November, Tony Bennett had scored a chart entry with \"Just in Time\"; Doris Day followed in December with \"The Party's Over.\" The cast album also reached the charts. Styne next worked with Comden and Green on the backstage musical Say, Darling (1958), which ran 332 performances and included \"Dance Only with Me,\" a Top 40 hit for Perry Como.\n\nStyne was brought into Gypsy (1959), a musical based on the autobiography of stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, after its star, Ethel Merman, objected to having Stephen Sondheim, then an untested composer, do the music. Sondheim, who had previously written lyrics for Leonard Bernstein's music in West SideStory,was retained as lyricist. The result was the most critically acclaimed work of Styne's career: the show ran 702 performances and earned a Tony nomination; the cast album stayed in the charts more than two years and tied for the Grammy Award for Best Cast Album; and the score included \"Small World,\" a Top 40 hit for Johnny Mathis and a Grammy nominee for song of the year, \"Everything's Coming Up Roses,\" and \"Let Me Entertain You.\" Styne and Comden and Green wrote two new songs for the film version of Bells Are Ringing,released in June 1960; the resulting LP earned a Grammy nomination for Best Soundtrack Album. Styne next collaborated with George David Weiss on songs for the N.Y. amusement park Freedomland; Johnny Horton had a chart entry with one of them, \"Johnny Freedom,\" in July. Styne's next stage musical, again with Comden and Green, was Do Re Mi, a satiric look at the music business. The songwriters demonstrated their expertise on the subject by achieving a chart entry from the score with \"Make Someone Happy,\" recorded by Perry Como, just as the show was opening in December 1960. Do Re Mi ran 400 performances and earned a Tony nomination for best musical; the cast LP charted for five months and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Cast Album; \"Make Someone Happy\" was nominated for a Song of the Year Grammy.\n\nStyne and Comden and Green followed a year later with Subways Are for Sleeping. It was a failure, with a run of 205 performances, although the cast album spent a couple of months in the charts. Styne married British model Margaret Ann Bissett Brown on June 4,1962; the couple had two children. A film version of Gypsy was released in November and the soundtrack album became a Top Ten hit. Styne had a rare independent chart entry in November 1963 with the civil rights anthem \"Now!\" (lyrics by Comden and Green), recorded by Lena Home.\n\nFunny ...., a musical based on the life of singer/ comedienne Fanny Brice, for which Styne collaborated with Bob Merrill, had a long gestation period, but when it finally opened in 1964 with Barbra Streisand in the lead role, it became the composer's most successful show, running 1,348 performances and earning Tony nominations for Best Musical and Best Score. The cast album hit the Top Ten, went gold, stayed in the charts a year, and won the Grammy Award for Best Cast Recording. Streisand reached the Top Ten with her recording of \"People,\" which earned a Song of the year Grammy nomination. She also charted with an unused title song for the musical.\n\nIn May, Styne's first original movie musical in nine years, What a Way to Go!, was released. With lyrics and screenplay by Comden and Green and starring Shirley Macl.aine, it was among the year's most successful films. The same month, Styne and Comden and Green had another stage musical on Broadway, Fade In-Fade Out, starring Carol Burnett; Styne also coproduced. It ran 271 performances and the cast album made the charts. In the fall Styne took on the job of director for the Sammy Fain/Alan and Marilyn Bergman musical Something More! (N.Y., Nov. 10, 1964), also writing several songs with the Bergmans, but the show was a flop. Styne and Merrill's television musical, The Dangerous Christmas of LittleRedRidingHood starring Liza Minnelli, was broadcast during the 1965 holiday season. Chris Montez had a Top 40 revival of \"Time after Time\" in the fall of 1966, and the Styne/Comden and Green television musical I'm Getting Married starring Anne Bancroft was broadcast in March 1967.\n\nStyne's next stage musical followed in April, when he and Comden and Green mounted Hallelujah, Baby! starring Leslie Uggams. It ran 293 performances and won Tony Awards for Best Musical and Best Score; the cast album earned a Grammy nomination for Best Show Recording. Styne and Bob Merrill wrote a new song called \"Funny ....\" for the 1968 movie version of their stage show. When it was released in September it became the highest grossing film of the year, with a million-selling soundtrack LP; the song earned Styne his tenth Academy Award nomination. The Tymes revived \"People\" for a Top 40 hit, and Diana Ross and the Supremes recorded an entire album of Funny .... songs. Styne worked on several musicals in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the only successful one being 1972's Sugar, written with Bob Merrill and based on the film Some LikeIt Hot. It ran 505 performances and earned a Tony nomination for Best Musical and a Grammy nomination for Best Cast Album.\n\nStyne's subsequent successes came with revivals and remakes. Lorelei, a new version of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, starring Carol Channing and with some new songs written with Comden and Green, toured the U.S. in 1973 and ran on Broadway for 320 performances in 1974.A revival of Gypsystarring Angela Lansbury ran in London in 1973 and moved to N.Y.in 1974. (There was another Broadway revival starring Tyne Daly in 1990, and a TV version with Bette Midler in 1993.) Also in 1974,Sammy Cahn performed on Broadway in his own revue, Words and Music, using many Styne-Cahn compositions. Styne himself performed a nightclub act in 1977. Barry Manilow revived \"I Don't Want to Walk without You\" for a Top 40 hit in 1980.\n\nStyne taught at N.Y.U.in the 1980s and accompanied Michael Feinstein in the recording of the singer's Jule Styne Songbook album in 1991. He also worked on several musicals, notably Bar Mitzvah Boy with Don Black, which had a short run in London in 1978 and was produced Off-Broadway as Songfor a Saturday in 1987, and, with Bob Merrill, The Red Shoes, which made it to Broadway for five performances in 1993. He died of heart failure in 1994.\n\n20 September\n\npage 4 of 5[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]20 September[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 5 of 5\n\nin 1994 - The Dave Matthews Band released 'Under the Table and Dreaming', the album featured their first commercial hits 'What Would You Say,' 'Satellite,' and 'Ants Marching.'

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Paul Weston (born Paul Wetstein, March 12, 1912) was an American pianist, arranger, composer, and conductor who worked in music and television from the 1930s to the 1970s, pioneering mood music and becoming known as \"the Father of Mood Music\". His compositions include popular music songs such as \"I Should Care\", \"Day by Day\", and \"Shrimp Boats\". He also wrote classical pieces, including \"Crescent City Suite\" and religious music, authoring several hymns and masses.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born Paul Wetstein in Springfield, Massachusetts, Weston had a keen interest in music from an early age and learned to play the piano. He was educated at Springfield High School, then attended Dartmouth College and Columbia University.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At Dartmouth he formed his own band and toured with the college band. He joined Columbia's dance band, The Blue Lions, but was temporarily unable to perform following a rail accident, and he did some arrangements while he recovered. Weston sold his first musical arrangements to Joe Haymes in 1934. After Haymes requested more material, Weston's music was heard by Rudy Vallee, who offered him work on his radio show. Weston met Tommy Dorsey through Haymes and in 1936 became a member of Dorsey's orchestra. Weston persuaded Dorsey to hire The Pied Pipers after hearing them in 1938, and the group toured with the bandleader.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After leaving Dorsey in 1940, Weston worked with Dinah Shore and moved to Hollywood after being offered work in films. In California he met Johnny Mercer, who invited him to write for his new label, Capitol Records. Weston became music director at Capitol, where he worked with Jo Stafford and developed the mood music genre. Stafford moved with him to Columbia Records in 1950, and the couple were married in 1952.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Weston worked extensively in television from the 1950s to the 1970s. He helped start the Grammy Awards, which were first presented in 1959. He was honored with a Grammy Trustees Award in 1971 and spent three years as music director of Disney on Parade.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Weston and Stafford developed a comedy routine in which they assumed the guise of a bad lounge act named Jonathan and Darlene Edwards. Their first album was released in 1957. In 1960, their album Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. Weston's work in music is honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Weston was born Paul Wetstein in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Paul Wetstein, a teacher, and Anna \"Annie\" Grady. The family moved to Pittsfield when Weston was two, and he spent his formative years in the town. His parents were both interested in music, and when Paul Sr taught at a private .....' school, he was allowed to bring the school's gramophone home over the Christmas holidays. Weston remembered hearing \"Whispering Hope\" on it as a child.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At age eight, he started piano lessons. He was an economics major at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where he graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1933. During his college days, Weston had his own band called \"the Green Serenaders\"; this allowed him to pay his own college tuition. Weston also learned how to play the clarinet so he could travel with the college band. He went to graduate school at Columbia University and was active in the Blue Lions, Columbia's dance band. In January 1934, Weston was seriously injured in a train accident. While trying to catch a train, Weston grabbed a door handle as the train sped off. He was able to hold on to the handle and was dragged two and one half miles before losing his grip. Unable to be active in a band, he started doing music arranging as a way to keep some involvement with music while convalescing. When he returned to New York in the fall of 1934, he made his first sale of his work to Joe Haymes. Haymes liked Weston's work enough to ask him to do more arrangements for his band. His medley of Anything Goes songs was heard by Rudy Vallee, who contacted him and offered Weston a job as an arranger for his Fleischmann's Hour on radio. Weston was also doing arranging for Phil Harris.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He met Tommy Dorsey through his work with Joe Haymes. Following the Dorsey Brothers split in 1935, Tommy had yet to form an orchestra; he used the Joe Haymes Orchestra for his first engagement as a solo conductor. Weston joined Dorsey as chief arranger in 1936, holding the position until 1940. He became Dinah Shore's arranger/conductor and worked freelance for the Bob Crosby Orchestra. Weston also worked with Fibber McGee and Molly and Paul Whiteman. When Bob Crosby's band was hired for his brother Bing's film, Holiday Inn, this took him to Hollywood and into film work. He changed his name from Wetstein to Weston after his arrival in California. Weston was asked to do more work for Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and also for Betty Hutton. Subsequent films as musical director include Belle of the Yukon (1944) and Road To Utopia (1945).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Weston met Johnny Mercer while working for Paramount in 1942; Mercer, who was preparing to start Capitol Records, wanted Weston to write for his new company. Paul wrote, arranged and directed Mercer's \"Strip Polka\"-the first arrangement written for the new label on April 6, 1942. On August first of that year, the 1942–44 musicians' strike began. No union musicians could record for any record company, but were able to play for live engagements and radio shows; the issue which prompted the strike was regarding record companies paying royalties to musicians. Many record companies had \"stockpiled\" recordings of their stars prior to the strike, planning to release them over a period of time. While the older, more established record labels were able to do this, the newly formed Capitol had no opportunity to do likewise. The strike brought the new company to a standstill until Johnny Mercer began his radio show, Johnny Mercer's Music Shop, in June 1943. The radio show was meant to be a venue for Capitol's talent during the Musicians' Strike. Mercer and Capitol recording artist Jo Stafford hosted the program, with Weston and his orchestra providing the music for it. Stafford and Weston had first met in 1938, when he was working as an arranger for Tommy Dorsey; Weston was responsible for getting Stafford's group, the Pied Pipers, an audition with Dorsey for his radio show. The recording ban was lifted for Capitol in October 1943 after an agreement was reached between the Musicians' Union and the record company; Weston was then able to return to the recording studio. In 1944, he became the company's music director. When appointed, Weston was the youngest musical director for any major record company.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Besides his work at Capitol, Weston did conducting for many radio shows during this time. He worked with Duffy's Tavern, the radio shows of Joan Davis, and Your Hit Parade. Jo Stafford, who became a regular host of the Chesterfield Supper Club in 1945, returned to California permanently in November 1946. Stafford later hosted the show from Hollywood, with Weston and his orchestra. It was around this time that Weston had a new idea for recorded music that would be similar to the soundtrack of a movie. It could be an enhancement to living but subtle enough not to stifle conversation. His album Music For Dreaming was the beginning of the \"Mood Music\" genre. In 1950, he left Capitol for a similar position at Columbia Records;[20] Jo Stafford also signed with Columbia at the same time. He remained active in radio, with his own The Paul Weston Show, and also in acting roles on Dear John with Irene Rich, Valiant ...., and Cavalcade of America.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Paul Weston and Jo Stafford were married on February 26, 1952; the couple had two children, Tim (born 1952), and Amy (born 1956). Both returned to Capitol in 1961, leaving the company for Dot Records in late 1965.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1957 Weston was named musical director for NBC-TV, a position he held for five years, a founding member and the first president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and half of a recording duo that the whole country was talking about. Paul and Jo did a skit at their parties where he would play the role of a simply horrible lounge pianist and she would vocalize in off-key melodies to the tunes he tried to play.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He went public with his portion of the act at a Columbia Records convention, where it was an instant hit; the couple agreed to do some recordings, calling themselves Jonathan and Darlene Edwards. George Avakian, a Columbia Records executive, chose the name of Jonathan Edwards for Weston's act in honor of the Calvinist preacher of the same name. Weston was concerned he might not be able to fill an album with the performances of Jonathan Edwards, so he asked Stafford to help. She became Darlene Edwards, the off-key singer. It was not immediately known to the public who had really made the records; there was much speculation as to what two famous people might be behind the music, before a 1957 Time article revealed their true identities.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1958, the fictional couple appeared on Jack Benny's Shower of Stars, and, in 1960, on The Garry Moore Show. The couple won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album of 1960 for their work as the imaginary pair. While Weston was the conductor for The Danny Kaye Show, his perpetual houseguest, Jonathan Edwards, made an appearance on the program without his singing wife, Darlene. The vocal for I Love a Piano was provided by Kaye as the pair started the television show on March 25, 1964.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]They continued to release Jonathan and Darlene albums for several years, and, in 1979, released a cover of The Bee Gees' \"Stayin' Alive\", backed with \"I Am Woman\". As Jonathan and Darlene Edwards, the couple released a \"sing along\" album which Mitch Miller believed put an end to his television show and sing-along records. Their last release, Darlene Remembers Duke, Jonathan Plays Fats, was issued in 1982.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The original idea of honoring those in the recording industry came from the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce in 1957. Their plan was to propose bronze sidewalk markers to be placed on Hollywood Boulevard (the beginning of the current Hollywood Walk of Fame). The Chamber approached local top recording company executives with the idea, asking for help with a list of those who deserved the honor. Weston was one of the men named to this committee by the Chamber. The committee executives decided all those who had sold a million records or a quarter million record albums during their careers would be candidates for the bronze star markers. As they continued their research, the men on the committee realized that many very important people in the recording industry would not qualify for this type of recognition. This realization prompted the founding of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, whose purpose was to create an award for recording artists. It became known as the Grammy, and the first awards were given in 1959. Paul Weston's dedication to music and recording was recognized with a Trustees' Award Grammy in 1971.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Weston had a long career as a musical director for television, including The Danny Kaye Show, The Jonathan Winters Show, The Jim Nabors Show and for The Bob Newhart Show, a 1961 variety show. He was also the conductor and arranger for his wife's CBS television show from 1954–55, The Jo Stafford Show. Although he did not provide the names of the programs, Weston once said conductors on live television shows, \"should also receive a stuntman's check!\" In 1959, Weston worked with Art Carney and Bil Baird's marionettes for an ABC television children's special, Art Carney Meets Peter and the Wolf, and was nominated for his musical contributions to the show.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Weston arranged Ella Fitzgerald's album Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Irving Berlin Songbook (1957), devoted to the music of Irving Berlin. Among songs he composed are \"I Should Care\" and \"Day by Day\", both of which were collaborations with Sammy Cahn and Axel Stordahl and were big hits for Frank Sinatra. He co-wrote \"Shrimp Boats\", published in 1951, which was popularized by Jo Stafford.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]One of Weston's songs made the tiny town of Hana on the island of Maui a household word. While on a visit to the area, Weston needed to shop for gifts for his two children. He found himself at the Hasegawa General Store, about which he wrote \"The Hasegawa General Store\", based on his experiences there, which was recorded by Arthur Godfrey, Jim Nabors, and others.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Weston also wrote classical and religious music: one of his two symphonic suites, Crescent City Suite, has enjoyed many performances, in the \"Crescent City\", New Orleans, and elsewhere. It was composed in 1956 and performed in New Orleans at the Municipal Auditorium in 1957 with Weston conducting. There was enough interest in the composition for a version for school bands to be made available in 1959; a symphonic version was also issued. He was the author of many hymns and two Masses which were published by the Gregorian Institute of America. He founded Corinthian Records in the late 1970s, a company which started as a religious music label, but which later became the distributor for the couple's secular albums. His intention was to get the masters of both his and Stafford's recordings for later reproduction on compact disk. He spent three years as the musical director of Disney on Parade.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The couple retired from performing in the 1970s. Active for many years in charities helping the developmentally disabled, the Westons gave more of their time to these groups after their retirement. The AbilityFirst work center in Woodland Hills, California is named in Paul Weston's memory. Weston died on September 20, 1996, in Santa Monica, California, aged 84. He is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. In 2006, his widow, Jo Stafford donated her husband's library and her own to the University of Arizona.

Nick's passion and voice combined with the band to make them different from most ska bands and gave L80 the \"against the rest\" attitude. The band toured extensively and he recorded on albums 17 Reasons and Killing Katie, before leaving to form a new band, Knowledge and immediately began playing shows and recording. Because of the many problems he exhibited from childhood, his life included a number of psychiatric hospitalizations for drug abuse and for treatment of bipolar disorder (suicide).\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1997 - Pearl Jam's 'Jeremy' video was cited as one of the reasons American teenager Barry Loukaitis had snapped into a violent rage that left three people dead.

Her early credits include the 1949 western \"Across the Rio Grande,\" in which she played a saloon singer, and three films in which she appeared with the comedy team of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She made her Broadway debut in the 1953 revue \"John Murray Anderson's Almanac\" in a cast that also featured Hermione Gingold, Billy De Wolfe and Harry Belafonte. Determined to make an impression as a vocalist, Ms. Bergen overexerted herself, injured her throat and had to leave the show and undergo surgery.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She was less than thrilled with the quality of the movies she was offered as a contract player in Hollywood, although there were a few exceptions, including \"Cape Fear\" and \"The Caretakers\" (1963), in which she convincingly played an inmate in a mental institution ruled by a dictatorial nurse played by Joan Crawford. She also had roles in several light comedies, including \"Move Over, Darling\" (1963), with Doris Day and James Garner, and \"Kisses for My President\" (1964), in which she starred as the nation's first female president.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ms. Bergen made a number of popular recordings, beginning with \"Little .... Blue\" in 1955, and was a familiar presence on television. She was on \"To Tell the Truth\" from 1956 to 1961, and she hosted her own variety series on NBC in the 1957-58 season. Her performance in the title role of \"The Helen Morgan Story,\" a 1957 episode of the anthology series \"Playhouse 90,\" won her an Emmy for \"best single performance.\" She was also prominently featured in a long-running advertising campaign for Pepsi-Cola.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the mid-1960s, she began selling a line of Polly Bergen Cosmetics, which she eventually sold to Fabergé. She followed that with Polly Bergen Jewelry and Polly Bergen Shoes. She soon became a successful entrepreneur as well as the author of three advice books: \"Fashion and Charm\" (1960), \"Polly's Principles\" (1974) and \"I'd Love to, but What Will I Wear?\" (1977). She was also an advocate for women, especially on the subject of reproductive rights.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ms. Bergen's three marriages ended in divorce. Her third husband, Jeffrey K. Endervelt, was an investor in companies who turned to her whenever he needed money, which proved to be often. By the time she and Mr. Endervelt were married, Ms. Bergen's own ventures had made her a millionaire. Over the course of their marriage, however, her fortune vanished, with the stock market collapse of 1987 serving as the final blow. The couple divorced in 1990, and Ms. Bergen, awash in debt, began to claw her way back to financial stability.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She returned to television and appeared in a number of dramas and mini-series, including \"The Winds of War\" (1983) and a sequel, \"War and Remembrance\" (1988), which reunited her with Mr. Mitchum. Her performances in those mini-series as the unfaithful and alcoholic wife of a serviceman earned her Emmy nominations.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ms. Bergen's infrequent movie credits in the 1990s included \"Cry-Baby,\" John Waters's madcap portrait of delinquent high school students in the 1950s, in which she played a snooty society matron.

She was in her early teens when her family moved to Los Angeles, and she soon began singing on the radio and in nightclubs.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Those performances brought her to the attention of executives at Paramount Pictures, who signed her to a contract. She made her movie debut as a cantina singer in \"Across the Rio Grande\" (1949), whose credits listed her as Polly Burgin. In her next film, \"At War With the Army\" (1950), the first of the three she made with Martin and Lewis (the others were \"The Stooge\" and \"That's My Boy\"), she became Polly Bergen. After Paramount, she was signed by MGM, but soon walked away from her contract because of dissatisfaction with her roles.

He studied economics in Berlin, obtaining a diploma of engineering in 1933. From 1934 to 1952 he lived in Israel, where he studied harpsichord with Pelleg and composition with Ben-Haim; in 1952 he went to the U.S. to study with Landowska (harpsichord), Hindemith (composition), and Sachs (music history); completed his studies at the University of Zurich (Ph.D., 1957, with the dissertation Die Entwicklung der Musiktheorie in England nach der Zeit von Jean-Philippe Rameau; publ. in Strasbourg, 1957-60; 2nd ed., rev. and aug., Baden-Baden, 1971). He was an asst. lecturer there (from 1961), and also a visiting professor at the University of Iowa (1970) and at Ind. University (1971-72). He wrote a number of valuable articles on Baroque composers for various music journals, and ed. F. P. Rameau: Complete Theoretical Writings (Rome, 1967-72). He also published Albert Schweitzer und die Musik (Wiesbaden, 1975) and served as editor of his writings. – Died at Zurich, Feb. 27, 1979.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1912 - György Sándor, admired Hungarian-born American pianist and teacher, cousin of Arpad Sandor, is born at Budapest. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music in Budapest with Bartok (piano) and Kodaly (composition). After making his debut in Budapest (1930), he toured in Europe before settling in the U.S. (1939); became a naturalized American citizen (1943). After World War II, he played in major music centers of the world. He also taught at Southern Methodist University in Dallas (1956-61); then was director of graduate studies in piano at the University of Mich, in Ann Arbor (1961-81); subsequently taught at the Juilliard School in N.Y.

One of the great songwriters in country music, who helped usher in the modern era of country songwriting, Theron Eugene Daffan was also one of the best-selling bandleaders of the 1940s. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Uninterested in a music career until he fell in love with HAWAIIAN MUSIC at age twenty, Daffan quickly began learning the steel guitar. By the following year he was not only teaching guitar but also leading his Blue Islanders on Houston radio. His introduction to country music came via the Blue Ridge Playboys, a fledgling local western swing band that included fiddler LEON SELPH and guitarist FLOYD TILLMAN, in 1934. Daffan joined the group until sidelined by ill health. In 1936 he teamed with vocalist JERRY IRBY and made his recording debut the following year with SHELLY LEE ALLEY, recording his first composition, \"I'm Still in Love with You.\" Soon he joined the popular BAR X COWBOYS, but concentrated on songwriting in hopes of getting his own recording contract. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Daffan's big break came when CLIFF BRUNER recorded a number of his songs at his 1939 DECCA sessions, including the seminal trucker's song, \"Truck Driver's Blues,\" which sold more than 100,000 copies. The song led to a COLUMBIA recording contract for Daffan, who began recording in 1940, though he remained with the Bar X Cowboys until mid-1941. Daffan's band, the Texans, featured the lead guitar of Buddy Buller and the accordion of Harry Sorensen and Freddy Courtney. His emphasis on these instruments proved distinctive and influential. Daffan immediately produced major hits \"Worried Mind\" and \"I'm a Fool to Care.\" He was already one of Columbia's top acts when he followed these with the classic two-sided million seller \"Born to Lose,\" backed with \"No Letter Today,\" recorded in Hollywood in 1942. The songs established Daffan as a major star, and he worked the competitive West Coast dance circuit from 1944 to 1946. Although he returned to Texas after that, the hits kept coming, from \"Heading Down the Wrong Highway\" to \"I've Got Five Dollars and It's Saturday Night.\" By the early fifties, his career was in eclipse, and he returned to Houston and disbanded the Texans. In 1955 Daffan started his own label, Daffan Records, which he revived intermittently until 1971, but his main source of income became new hit versions of his classic songs, such as Joe Barry's 1961 revival of \"I'm a Fool to Care,\" and especially Ray Charles's early sixties covers of \"Born to Lose,\" \"No Letter Today,\" and \"Worried Mind.\" [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Died October 6, 1996[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1913 - Janet Bleyer (JANET ERTEL) is born. The bass vocalist for the all-...., barbershop group, The Chordettes, Janet Ertel was asked to join them by her college friend, Jinny Osborn. Formed in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, in 1946, the group blossomed under the musical guidance and financial assistance of Osborn's father (a former barbershop singer). An immediate success, The Chordettes toured heavily in the late Forties. While taking college classes, Ertel was replaced on road dates by Nancy Overton. The Chordettes garnered national exposure as regulars on Arthur Godrey's popular radio and television programmes. In 1950, Godrey aided the group in landing a recording contract with Columbia. But fired by Godrey in 1953, The Chordettes were replaced on the programme by The McGuire Sisters. Signing with Cadence Records in 1954 (the label launched by Godrey's former bandleader and Ertel's fiancee, Archie Bleyer), The Chordettes moved away from their traditional sound, scoring several pop hits including 'Mr. Sandman' and 'Lollipop'. In 1955, Ertel married Bleyer. The Chordettes appeared on the first episode of the national version of .... Clark's American Bandstand in 1957. After the Chordettes disbanded in the early Sixties, Ertel and her husband moved to Freeport, and then back to Sheboygan in 1986. Ertel last sang with The Chordettes at a barbershop music convention in 1984. She died in Black River, Wisconsin. Archie Bleyer died shortly after on March 20, 1989, of Parkinson's disease at the age of 80. (Cancer). - Died November 22, 1988.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1913 - Vincent H(arris) Duckles, American musicologist, is born at Boston. He began his training at the University of Calif., Berkeley (A.B., 1936). After studies at Columbia University (M.A. in music education, 1937; Ed.D., 1941), he pursued training once more at the University of Calif., Berkeley (B.L.S., 1949; Ph.D., 1953, with the dissertation John Gamble's Commonplace Book). He also held Fulbright senior research scholarships at the University of Cambridge (1950-51) and at the University of Gottingen (1957-58), and a grant-in-aid from the American Council of Learned Societies for research in Europe (1964-65). He was a music librarian (1949-57), assoc. professor (1957-60), and professor (1960-81) at the University of Calif., Berkeley. In 1982 he was made an honorary member of the American Musicological Society. He specialized in 17th-century English song literature, music bibliography, and the history of musical scholarship. He published the valuable and enduring source Music Reference and Research Materials: An Annotated Bibliography (N.Y., 1964; 5th ed., rev., 1997 by 1. Reed). – Died at Berkeley, Calif., July 1, 1985.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1914 - Arkie the Arkansas Woodchopper, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]dance caller, fiddler, and guitarist, is[/FONT][FONT=&quot]born Luther William Ossenbrik, near Knob Noster, Missouri. Arkie performed as a boy guitarist/fiddler/dance caller. In 1928 he made his debut on Kansas City radio, and a year later joined the prestigious [/FONT][FONT=&quot]National Barn Dance [/FONT][FONT=&quot]program broadcast out of Chicago on WLS. One of the longest-running stars of the program, Arkie continued on air with them until the original show was canceled in 1960, then for a further decade on a revived version of the show. His colorful name and handle—\"Country boy from the Ozarks\"—was given to him by WLS staff—even though he was not from the Ozark region at all. He made a few country-novelty recordings in the 1930s and 1940s, but was best loved for his on-air monologues about country life. In 1940 he published a book of SQUARE DANCE calls, and a year later he recorded an album of 78s with calls and music. This helped spur further interest in square dancing among city dwellers, as did Arkie's tours as a caller. After 1970, when the second incarnation of the [/FONT][FONT=&quot]National Barn Dance [/FONT][FONT=&quot]went off the air, Arkie retired from active performing. He died on June 23, 1981. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1914 - Slam Stewart/Leroy Elliot Stewart (US jazz bassist with all the icons 40s- 80's) is born at Englewood, N.J. He began playing violin during childhood, switched to bass and worked with local bands (including stint with Sonny Marshall), then studied at Boston Conservatory of Music. While in Boston he heard Ray Perry on violin singing and bowing in unison; later, Stewart began successfully experimenting with the idea of singing an octave above his bowed bass work. He worked with Peanuts Holland Band in Buffalo (1936-37), then moved to N.Y., met Slim Gaillard, and formed a duo (\"Slim and Slam\"). They continued to perform together until Gaillard was drafted into the army in 1942.\n\nAfter their initial success on radio station WNEW, the duo recorded the big-selling \"Flat Foot Floogie.\" Stewart appeared in the 1943 film Stormy Weather, then worked mainly with Art Tatum (1943-44), with whom he would work on occasion through the early 1950s. Stewart joined Benny Goodman in February 1945, and for the next nine months did several brief interludes with Goodman. During the 1950s, he worked with the Roy Eldridge Quartet (1953) and pianist Beryl Booker (1955-57), as well as leading his own small groups. Stewart was reunited with Slim Gaillard at Great South Bay Jazz Festival in summer 1958.\n\nIn the late 1950s and 1960s, he worked mainly as accompanist for vocalist-pianist Rose Murphy (including a European tour). During the mid-1960s he temporarily quit playing because of illness. He returned to performing in late 1968, then settled in Binghamton, N.Y., where he taught at the State Univ. during the 1970s. He toured Europe with Milt Buckner and Jo Jones (April 1971), and worked often with Benny Goodman (1973-75). During 1978 he appeared frequently on television on the Today show, often in company with guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli.\n\nStewart remained active through the mid-1980s, touring Europe and also appearing in the U.S. with Illinois Jacquet. Stewart was noted for his unique sound created by singing in a high voice while he soloed with a bow; he was also one of the most melodic and skillful bassists of his generation and one of the few who took melodic solos before Jimmy Blanton. – Died at Binghamton, N.Y., Dec. 10, 1987.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1914 - Judge Bob Burton [/FONT][FONT=&quot]is born at New York, New York. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Judge Robert J. \"Bob\" Burton, a visionary BMI executive, was an early and potent voice on behalf of Nashville and country music. He was instrumental in formulating a key system of tracking performances of music that encompassed the many rural and small urban radio stations programming country.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Previously these stations had not been included in any surveys on which royalty payments were based. Close to many country artists, songwriters, and publishers, Burton was one of the founders of the COUNTRY Music ASSOCIATION and a member of its first board of directors. He played a major role in raising money for building the COUNTRY Music HALL OF FAME. His belief in the importance and future of country music was further evidenced by the part he played in opening a BMI office in Nashville in 1958, years before most other major New York and Los Angeles companies did so. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Raised in Larchmont, New York, Burton was educated in Larchmont public schools and at the Chateau de Beurs, a private school in France. He graduated from Columbia University in 1935, Columbia Law School in 1937, and joined BMI in January 1941. In the foreground as BMI grew, Burton advanced rapidly and became the organization's president in 1964. Unfortunately, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Billboards [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Country Man of the Year for 1964 didn't live long enough to witness the full impact of what he had done for Nashville and country music—indeed, for all forms of popular music—as he died in March 29, 1965 in a hotel fire in Vancouver.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1920 - Robert Wangermee, distinguished Belgian musicologist, is born at Lodelinsart. He received training in music from J. Absil, and pursued musicological studies at the Free University of Brussels (Ph.D., 1946, with the dissertation Le Gout musical en France au XIXe siecle); then was on its faculty as a lecturer (1948-62), reader (1962-65), and professor (from 1975). He also was active with the Belgian Radio and Television (from 1946), serving as its director of music (1953-60) and as director-general of its French-language broadcasts (1960-84).\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1921 - Chico Hamilton (US jazz drummer; Count Basie/Lester Young/Lena Horne etc) is born at Los Angeles, Calif. A former clarinet player, Hamilton played drums in high school in L.A., along with fellow students Dexter Gordon, Charles Mingus, Ernie Royal, and Buddy Collette. He subsequently worked with Floyd Ray, Lionel Hampton, and Slim Gaillard, then spent four years in the army, where he studied (among other things) drums with Jo Jones. Brief encounters with Lester Young, Jimmy Mundy, and Count Basie led to his first long gig, a seven-year stint with Lena Home, during which he toured often.\n\nHe also worked in the early 1950s with Gerry Mulligan before forming his own quintet in 1955. The self- styled chamber-jazz unit used flute, clarinet, and cello. It had an intimate sound and elements of \"cool\" and symphonic music. The group achieved great popularity through their recordings and appearances in festival films, including the famous movie Jazz on a Summer Day. Hamilton has been among the best at spotting and debuting new talent. The list of major names who started with him includes Buddy Collette, Jim Hall, Paul Hom, Eric Dolphy, Ron Carter, Charles Lloyd, Gabor Szabo, John Abercrombie, and Arthur Blythe. In 1960 he was a boxing sparring partner for Miles Davis. In the mid-1960s, he formed a production company to write advertising jingles and soundtracks, but continued to work in jazz. He has taught at the New School since 1987. In 1989, he reunited his 1950s-era quintet for a European tour and recording. Through the 1990s, he continues to lead his own groups on record and on the road.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n21 September\n\npage 1 of 3[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]21 September[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\nPage 2 of 3\n\nin 1921 - Sir Jimmy Young (UK singer, BBC radio DJ, interviewer) is born.\n\nin 1926 - Noor Jehan/Allah Wasai (Pakistani singer, actress) is born.\n\nin 1929 - Shafi Hadi a.k.a. Curtis Porter (US jazz saxophonist; Griffin Brothers/freelance) is born.\n\nin 1931 - Voki Kostic (Serbian composer, cookery author) is born at Belgrade. He studied in his native city; adopted a sophisticated style of utilitarian music. His Karakteri for Clarinet, Piano, and 18 Percussion Instruments (1958) had numerous performances in Yugoslavia. He also wrote a Divertimento for Wind Quintet; Suite for Bassoon and Piano; Ciganska pri-ca (Gypsy Tale) for Men's Chorus and Chamber Orch., to Gypsy texts (1964).\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1932 - Don Preston (of Mothers of Invention) is born in Flint, Michigan.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1934 - Leonard Cohen, Canadian poet/ singer /songwriter of dark-themed songs, is born at Montreal, Canada. Cohen studied English literature at McGill and Columbia Univs. and published his first book of poetry, Let Us Compare Mythologies, in 1956. During the 1960s, he published a number of books of poetry as well as two novels, The Favorite Game (1963) and Beautiful Losers (1966). The latter became standard college literary fare and sold more than 300,000 copies.\n\nTaught the classics of music as a child, Leonard Cohen began playing guitar at age 13 and singing at 15, performing with a barn-dance group called the Buckskin Boys during his late teens. His first popular acclaim came when Judy Collins recorded one of his most romantic compositions, \"Suzanne,\" for her 1966 In My Life album. Cohen launched his performing career through appearances at the Newport Folk Festival and N.Y&#8217;s Central Park (with Collins) in 1967. Signed to Columbia Records by John Hammond, Leonard Cohen's debut album included \"Suzanne&#8221; the alienated \"Stranger Song&#8221; the sorrowful \"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye&#8221; and the compassionate \"Sisters of Mercy.\"\n\nThe latter three songs had appeared on Collins's Wildflower album. In 1969 Cohen successfully toured North America and Europe and issued Songs from a Room, recorded in Nashville. It contained \"The Story of Isaac,\" \"Tonight Will Be Fine,\" and the oft-recorded classic \"Bird on a Wire.\" Retiring from public performance at the end of 1970, he released Songs of Love and Hate the following year. It contained \"Famous Blue Raincoat,\" \"Joan of Arc,\" \"Dress Rehearsal Rag,\" \"Diamonds in the Mine,\" and \"Love Calls You by Your Name.\" He also provided the songs for the soundtrack to the 1971 Robert Altman film McCabe and Mrs. Miller.\n\nIn 1972 Leonard Cohen published another volume of poetry, The Energy of Slaves, and toured the U.S. and Europe with Jennifer Warnes as one of his backup singers. New Skin for the Old Ceremony, with \"There is a War\" and \"Chelsea Hotel,\" was issued in 1974 and Cohen toured again in 1975. He collaborated with songwriter-producer Phil Spector for the controversial Death of a ......' Man in 1977 and recorded Recent Songs for Columbia in 1979. In 1985 he toured again in support of Various Positions, but Columbia did not issue the album, instead leasing it to the small Passport label. The album was quickly deleted, despite the inclusion of \"The Broken Hallelujah,\" \"Dance Me to the End of Love,\" and \"Heart with No Companion.\"\n\nIn 1986 longtime associate Jennifer Warnes recorded an entire album of Leonard Cohen songs, Famous Blue Raincoat, which became a commercial success and revived interest in his career. Already a well-respected figure in Europe, Cohen's 1988 I'm Your Man sold spectacularly there and further reawakened interest in his songs in North America. Hailed as a masterpiece, the album contained a number of haunting, compelling songs such as \"First We Take Manhattan,\" \"Ain't No Cure for Love,\" and \"Take This Waltz.\" The less impressive follow-up, The Future, included \"Democracy,\" \"Light as a Breeze,\" and \"Waiting for a Miracle.\" The 1993 book Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs assembled Cohen's poems, prose, and lyrics.\n\nContemporary alternative artists such as R.E.M., Nick Cave, and the Pixies paid tribute to Leonard Cohen with 1991's I'm Your Fan, while 1995's Tower of Song tribute featured mainstream artists such as Elton John, Willie Nelson, and Billy Joel. Cohen's son Adam moved to the U.S. from Europe in 1992 and began concentrating on his music in N.Y. the following year. In 1998, he made his recording debut on Columbia Records and conducted his first national tour.\n\nCohen was one of the most powerful song poets to emerge in the 1960s. Despite the limited musical effectiveness of his gruff monotonic voice and sparse musical settings, his poetics more than compensate for any musical shortcomings. His lyrics, legitimately described as brooding and gloomy, even depressing, ultimately succeed through the underlying intensity of their humanity. One of the first artists to bring a spiritual and poetic sensibility to rock music, Cohen became an acclaimed musical figure in Europe, where he was sometimes compared to Jacques Brel. In the U.S., he endured years as a cult figure.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1935 - Gabor Otvos, Hungarian-born German conductor, is born at Budapest.
