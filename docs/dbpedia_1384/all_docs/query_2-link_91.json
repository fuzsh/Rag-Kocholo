        "text": "Last September I was fortunate enough to spend a month in Augsburg, and caught FCA grind out a 1-0 victory against the devils of German football, RB Leipzig, and fall to an unlucky 2-1 defeat to Dortmund (complete with farcical VAR penalty). Here’s a quick run through Saturday’s visitors.\n\nHistory\n\nAugsburg have spent the majority of their existence in the second and third tiers of German football ‘ even slipping down to the fourth tier in 2000. This does seem to have sparked something of a turnaround in their fortunes. Having sorted out their finances, Augsburg returned to the 2. Bundesliga in 2006 (for the first time in 23 years) before going one better in 2011, gaining promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in their history. They’re now preparing for their eighth successive season in the top flight. Not that this has been straightforward. The club have finished in the bottom half in five of the last seven seasons, creating brown trousers across Swabia in 2012-13 before embarking on their own great escape. Winning just 9 points in the entire first half of the season they somehow clawed their way back to clinch safety with a last day victory. Incredibly, two seasons laterthey secured 5th place and European football. Those with a keen memory of all things English football may rememberwatching them fall to a 1-0 aggregate defeat at Liverpool. The visit to Liverpool still seems to be talked about fondly in Augsburg, so here’s hoping a good number will be tempted across for this visit to the UK.\n\nIn terms of club legends, you’re sure to put yourself in the good books with visiting fans by talking up your admiration of Helmut Haller. Born in Augsburg, Haller followed his early career at the club then known as BC Augsburg with ten seasons in Serie A, winning titles with Bologna in 63-64 and Juventus in 71-72 and 72-73. Haller returned to Augsburg in 1973 becoming something of a local hero, even refusing to take a salary to play for the club, instead accepting 5% of his transfer fee. His return to Augsburg prompted 90,000 fans to attend their match against 1860 Munich at the Olympic Stadium ‘ a record attendance for a second tier match.\n\nAugsburg Now\n\nWhilst Augsburg are the biggest team Swabia, they are dwarfed in Bavaria by the pesky presence of Bayern Munich a short train ride away. Therefore, whilst Augsburg itself is not much smaller than Newcastle, it does feel smaller. It isn’t the regional hub that we have here. That said, their extended stay in the Bundesliga has brought a positivity to both city and club. The atmosphere on a match day, in a one-club city much like our own, had a feeling that will be familiar. Colours on display all around the town, with the even the trams adorned with FCA flags for the occasion. Their average home attendance of 28,000 has them at the smaller end of the Bundesliga, but they certainly manage to create a rowdy and vocal atmosphere in the 30,000 seater WWK Arena.\n\nThe kind of support will be familiar to anyone who has taken in some German football ‘ drums, flags, and capos leading non-stop chants from start to finish. In the ground this is all centred on the Block M Ultras, a standing section with all of the energy that this brings. You’ll be amazed to know that in this standing section (and others in Germany) at no point did I fear for my safety. You’ll be even further astonished to hear that the experience of standing in dedicated standing sections is much better, and a lot less lethal when celebrating, than standing in seated areas in the UK. Who’d have thought?\n\nIn terms of away following, they take a vocal following domestically, with drums, flags and capos all involved away as well as at home. During their previous visit to the UK, for that Europa League match against Liverpool, they created quite the atmosphere with fans marching through the city before the match. We can’t expect that for a friendly, but here’s hoping they bring enough for a lively atmosphere in both ground and city. They didn’t bring many to a visit to the Smoggies last year, but then why would you?\n\nKey Players\n\nGotze and Khedira. Well, Felix Gotze and Rani Khedira. Felix, the younger brother of Mario, is a 20 year old centre back just signed from Bayern, so the jury is out there. Rani Khedira, Sami’s brother, has clear quality that is shown rarely. The attacking threat comes from Michael Gregoritsch (last season’s top scorer with 13) and the creativity of Alfred Finnbogason (yet to feature following the world cup). Sergio Cordova is a quick winger that looks exciting but providesvery little. In the games I witnessed they defended impressively, with Hinteregger and Gooweleeuw forming a solid partnership at centre back. It will be interesting to see if the aforementioned Gotze gets much game time in front of these two. The loss of goalkeeper Marwin Hitz to Dortmund may shake that defence. The most exciting player by a country mile was Philipp Max, an attacking left-back with the ability to provide fantastic deliveries into the box, as well as seeming defensively sound. I’d take him at Newcastle in an instant. Look out for counter attacks instigated by him.\n\nThey’ve added very little to the squad this summer. Andre Hahn has returned from the relegated Hamburg but comes with a scoring record that gives suggests there isn’t much to fear. Fredrik Jensen, a twenty year old Finnish winger from Twente, is an interesting prospect. Those two signings at ‘3m each, alongside free signings of Gotze and Julian Schieber, suggest that the club continues to work on a tight budget. Schieber won’t feature, having picked up an injury in a pre-season victory over Wurzburger Kickers.\n\nIt’s hard to draw much from their friendlies so far, with a hefty selection of young players getting a run out. A 2-1 victory against the Smoggies (yes they played them again this year – Hahn and Baier with the goals) and a 2-0 victory over Wurzburger Kickers (goals from Schmid and Schieber) werefollowed by a 2-1 defeat to Gladbach, with FCAs goal coming from Cordova. Instinctively, we should have the beating of this side.\n\nAs for the coming season? I imagine the Augsburg faithful will be hoping for a Europa League push, but content with the safety of mid table again. Much the same as us, but perhaps for vastly different reasons.\n\nDavid Farell-Banks"
