        "text": "Harry Kane netted once more as Bayern Munich held on for a 3-2 victory in the Bavaria derby at FC Augsburg.\n\nThe hosts began the better side but once Bayern went in front through Aleksandar Pavlovic's first goal for the club, they took command and were value for the second moments before the interval from Alphonso Davies' fierce low drive from 25 yards.\n\nSeven minutes into the second half, Ermedin Demirovic rose highest to head home a cross from on-loan Fulham man Kevin Mbabu, but Kane's close-range effort just after the hour mark seemed to have settled to match.\n\nFootball\n\nTottenham Hotspur 2-3 Bayern Munich - As it happened\n\n7 hours ago\n\nTwo penalties in the closing moments gave Augsburg the chance to get something out of the game, the first saved by Manuel Neuer from substitute Sven Michel and then a successful kick from Demirovic.\n\nThe win means Bayern keep in touch with Bayer Leverkusen at the summit of the Bundesliga, while Augsburg stay in mid-table.\n\nTalking Point - You have to feel for Coman\n\nJudging by the despair as he lay on the turf, and the way he was carried off the ground, it may be that Kingsley Coman will miss, at best, a decent amount of the remaining 2023/24 campaign.\n\nHe has a cupboard full of silverware but too often at the business end of the season has been sat watching as Bayern Munich and France competed for the top prizes in the sport.\n\nHe has twice been a runner-up in major international tournaments, as a youngster in the 2016 European Championship and the 2022 World Cup, where he missed a penalty in the shoot-out. But he was not part of France's 2018 World Cup success due to a mid-season ankle ligament injury which he could not quite recover from in time to find a place in Didier Deschamps' squad and may be in jeopardy for this summer's Euros.\n\nIt might seem peculiar to feel for a player who won a Serie A title at Juventus, the Bundesliga eight straight times and a UEFA Champions League, but his career has perhaps will probably not quite reach its peak due to injuries which have prevented him making 30 league appearances in any season of his career.\n\nHe is still 27, but those injuries must add miles to his footballing odometer.\n\nPlayer of the Match - Jamal Musiala (Bayern Munich)\n\nHe is still a month away from his 21st birthday but there is no disputing his importance to the Bayern side - and it showed. Although Leroy Sane has outshone him this season, Musiala remains the man Bayern want with the ball in and around the penalty area, where his quick feet bemuse opponents and create openings for his team-mates. This dual threat is the reason Bayern may be able to handle a Coman absence.\n\nPlayer Ratings\n\nAugsburg: Dahmen 6; Mbabu 6, Gouweleeuw 6, Uduokhai 6, Iago 6; Jensen 6, Rexhbecaj 7, Jakic 6, Vargas 6; Tietz 6, Demirovic 7.\n\nMatch Highlights\n\n12' BALL IN BAYERN NET! The linesman has ruled it out. But we will check. It was a fantastic half-volley from Rexhbecaj. I think it is onside....ah, he was just a fraction off from Demirovic's head down.\n\n23' GOAL FOR BAYERN! Pavlovic scores his first goal for Bayern. You would not know it though, he spun and finished from inside the six-yard box like Gerd Muller.\n\n45+5' GOAL FOR BAYERN! And it was a fantastic one from Davies. He dashed between the lines to take a pass from Goretzka and he drilled a low shot with his right foot inside the post from 25 yards.\n\n52' GOAL FOR AUGSBURG! Mbabu with a fine cross from the right flank and Demirovic had the most desire to get to the ball and headed into the corner past Neuer.\n\n58' KANE HAS THE BALL IN THE NET! He is given offside but vigorously complains about the decision. Musiala tried to find the English striker in the box and it will depend if he or Jakic, trying to make a clearance, pushed the ball to Kane.\n\n61' GOAL IS GIVEN! Kane's two-match goalless strike is over! 23 Bundesliga goals for the England skipper\n\n82' OFF THE POST! Great work from Sane to put the substitute through on goal but attempting to curl an effort just inside the near post her shoots against the post.\n\n86' VAR WILL LOOK AT THAT... Neuer took a wild swinging punch at that ball but connected with Uduokhai in front of the ball. It looks like a penalty. PENALTY FOR AUGSBURG! After consulting the sideline screen the referee points to the spot.\n\n89' GOOD SAVE FROM NEUER! Michel struck the ball across his body towards the corner but the 'keeper parries the ball away to safety.\n\n90+3' PENALTY FOR AUGSBURG! Muller brings down Demirovic in the area. And the big striker will take the kick.\n\n90+4' GOAL FOR AUGSBURG! Demirovic makes no mistake sending Neuer the wrong way from 12 yards out.\n\nKey Stat\n\n- - -\n\nTNT Sports presents the premium live sports rights previously carried by BT Sport including the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Conference League, Gallagher Premiership Rugby, Investec Champions Cup, EPCR Challenge Cup, MotoGP, Cricket, UFC, Boxing, NBA and WWE.
