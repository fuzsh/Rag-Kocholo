        "text": "A jewel of U.S. soccer and the franchise player of FC Dallas is reportedly heading overseas.\n\nEl Paso native Ricardo Pepi, 18, is expected to make a permanent move to FC Augsburg in the German Bundesliga, according to Fabrizio Romano of CBS Sports and Sky Sports.\n\nRomano reports that the striker and U.S. Men’s National Team star will draw a record-breaking MLS club fee of $20 million plus add ons. Pepi’s transfer may be complete by Sunday, pending a physical.\n\nPepi had expressed interest in playing for a European club for some time, but FC Dallas president Dan Hunt as recently as December shared his belief that the Texas soccer phenom would remain in Frisco for the 2022 MLS season.\n\n“Definitively, I expect Ricardo to be back next season with us,” Hunt told Al Día’s Abraham Nudelstejer.\n\nHunt continued:\n\n“Ricardo needs to play and keep scoring goals. The U.S. National Team head coach, Gregg Berhalter, has said he will keep calling Ricardo. The U.S. National Team has been very successful with Ricardo Pepi on the field.\n\n“By playing next season in Dallas, Ricardo can help us win a championship, he can help the national team qualify for the Qatar World Cup and then play in that World Cup.\n\n“Berhalter and other head coaches around the world have shown that if players aren’t participating in their clubs, they’ll be excluded from their respective national teams.\n\n“Ricardo’s future is incredible and shining, but I think the best Ricardo can do for his career is continue his process. He’s still very young.”\n\nPepi signed a five-year extension with FC Dallas in July. He finished the MLS season with 13 goals and added three goals in six appearances with the USMNT in international play.\n\nThis story will be updated when more information becomes available.\n\nRelated:How Ricardo Pepi went from FC Dallas teenage sensation to MLS All-Star\n\nRelated:Ricardo Pepi has sights set on Europe, but FC Dallas president Dan Hunt expects him back in 2022"
