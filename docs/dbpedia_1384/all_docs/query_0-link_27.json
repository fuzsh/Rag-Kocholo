        "text": "Adrian Ortega Conversion Testimony\n\nGod be praised. After more than 18 years of rebellion against God, against my Holy Mother and the Church, my Lord went in search of my lost soul.\n\nMy first marriage was carried out in court and the Catholic Church, and after 2 years I had abandoned it. What happened was very painful and incomprehensible for me, because the foundation that should have been built was not based on my understanding of ‚ÄúThe Love of God‚Äù. Due to my civil divorce, I learned of the annulment process of the Sacrament of Marriage. My first thought was, ‚ÄúThe church is useless. How could the church DIVORCE what has been united by God?‚Äù and I thought this without considering the role that I had played. I had ended this relationship, and I had also entered it with my own ideas about marriage, without emotional maturity, and without financial responsibility. I just wanted to be with the person that I thought I ‚Äúloved‚Äù. This led me to resentment with the church and with God. I made the decision that my intellect would be capable of making me understand that the processes of the church were absurd and that other religions and ideologies had some truth to them. That was how my war against God began. I began reading all different types of books following what people had once told me, ‚ÄúRead different types of books and your mind will comprehend their contents.‚Äù That is how I came to new age literature and secret societies that cultivated knowledge for one‚Äôs own growth. Now I know that God allowed my heart to toughen into a shielded organ that nothing and no one could hurt. However, my most harmful relationship ever had begun, my alcoholism was uncontrollable, and my anger was unstoppable. Nevertheless, my appearance was that of a normal, centered, educated, cultured, and ambitious person that could accomplish anything by simply thinking about it and being mentally focused. I had a lot of downfalls, but I thought, ‚ÄúI can reinvent myself.‚Äù My relations to the mundane were growing and I eventually reached complete rebellion without even kneeling for the Sacred Eucharist. The mercy of God, however, is greater than that.\n\nI almost lost my life several times due to my lack of responsibility with alcohol and my lifestyle. One day I started to have a really high fever that did not go away. After a week I went to my doctor and was diagnosed with Typhoid which infected my liver and gave me hepatitis. Since my liver was not working I was not able to take any medication. I could only to hope to get better through rest and candy. One day, the pain from my liver was so strong that I was afraid I would die. My mother wanted to call the ambulance, but I told her not to. At that moment I looked in the dresser drawers of my bedroom and saw a figurine that belonged to my grandfather. It was a statue of San Antonio of Padua with baby Jesus in his arms. At that moment I looked up and said: ‚ÄúSaint Anthony since you are closer to God, tell him to give me more time so that I can see my daughter and change my life.‚Äù Like a miracle, the next day I started to get better which led to my recovery. Once I was better, I immigrated to the United States and began a new life. My ideals had not changed much, I remarried, God blessed me with two sons, however, I did not have the intention of reconciling with Him.\n\nI believed that I did not need anything. I had a job, a house, a family, but there was a tremendous emptiness in my life that not even money or my home could fill. I continued drinking but at a different rate due to my liver damage. Once, on a good day, I tried to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù a family member. I lied to them so that they would come with me to retreat. Of course, according to me, it was he who needed it, not me; and that is how I went through the most profound experience of my life because God had a surprise for me. He was in search of his prodigal son. After going through the experience of this retreat, my hunger for the Eucharist was so great that it motivated me to reconcile through the sacrament of confession. The following week, I heard the announcement for another retreat through the Catholic Church and that is where I went through another indescribable experience. The Holy Spirit receives me with its sublime warmth and takes away my fear of speaking openly about Jesus, my Lord and Savior. I began to research the process of annulment knowing that I could not continue living the way I was. My conscience had been awakened inside me making me look for things of God which led me to look on the internet about the lives of Saints: Padre Pio, San Juan Bosco, Madre Teresa de Calcutta, San Antonio de Padua and more. That is how I came to see a very peculiar film that caught my attention. At first, I had to check various sources to verify the authenticity of what I saw and heard. So I checked web links from the Vatican to see if they corresponded. The film was about a person named Vassula Ryden, who said that she had been receiving messages from God since 1986. The messages are translated into dozens of languages, so I began reading them in Spanish and personalizing them with my name as Vassula had mentioned. My body began to tremble during the reading.\n\nI had begun the marriage annulment process by now. At times my mind was hesitant with doubts, but God filled me with peace. I also had the support of the group with which I lived my first spiritual experience, who helped me to balance my feelings and emotions. The annulment process came to its final stage. The nun who was managing my case contacted me to see if I still wanted to testify my case in the church. For a moment I felt a spiritual power to change the course of the verdict. I told the nun that I would like to testify, and in that moment, she mentioned that we would have to speak with the judge so that I could be assigned a day, and that the process would be further delayed. The case was already ready to be examined. My Mother Santa Maria has nourished me through the rosary to obey my Church. I advised the nun that I trusted in the decision of the judge without my testimony.\n\nAt that moment I remembered one of the messages to Vassula that follows:\n\nYahweh Is With You\n\nDecember 23, 1990\n\nO Father,\n\nlike thirsty land I yearn for You.\n\nRest me for a while on Your Knees now and console me.\n\nLet me feel enveloped by Your Consoling Heart.\n\nI need Your warmth.\n\nrepose your head on My Heart, rest and feel consoled‚Ä¶ your Abba is caring for you; your Abba is happy to have you near Him; repose your head on My Heart, My child, and listen to the Desires of My Heart: My Heart is still seeking, longing, pleading for the rest of My children‚Äôs love; ‚Ä¶\n\n(A few seconds‚Äô pause.)\n\nchild? 1 what would you give to console your Abba?\n\nO Lord, anything you want. My love, my will, my heart and my soul.\n\nand what more?\n\nMy life, as an atonement to Your Desires.\n\ndescend then from My Knees and go and bear witness in My Name; go and tell the nations of My Great Love; remind them that My Promise is very near to its accomplishment and that My Return is imminent; the New Jerusalem2 is at hand; I am going to renew My Church and My people;\n\nso My child, descend from My Knees and go out into the world for My Sake ‚Ä¶ and make My Love known to the world; let the world realize how I love My children; as it is, you have not sought Me, it is I who found you and have chosen you to go out to the world before My Great Day; it is I who formed you and although you were aloof to Me, I have chosen you and revealed My Holy Face to you; so when you have accomplished all the work I have commissioned you for, My child, I shall take you up to Me and you may then rest on My Knees;\n\nI shall, in the meantime while you are in the world, protect you from your oppressors; I want you for your part to look up in Heaven constantly for Me and talk to Me; ‚ÄùYahweh is with you‚Äù, have always these words engraved on your mind and on your heart, for I-Am-With-You; now let your heart treasure all that I have told you and remember: offer Me prayers to reach Me like incense, for the conversion of souls and the revival of My Church;\n\n1 Suddenly the Father‚Äôs Head turned and looked at me.\n\n2 Church.\n\nSoon after, I spoke with the sister and asked her if I could send an email with my final testimony. She told me I could and after several attempts she told me that she was unable to receive emails. So, in my own thoughts I told God, ‚ÄúI tried.‚Äù A couple minutes after I had hung up the phone with the sister, she called me and told me I could send it by fax. My heart was filled with joy.\n\nThis was my final testimony in English which I had to write with my cousin‚Äôs assistance in the translation:\n\nDear Sister Clare,\n\nThe following Message explains my conversion. I was fighting against God, but now He brought me back. I did not understand the process of annulment and therefore did not accept it, even though I knew about it 20 years ago. My resentments against God and the Church were so big that I created my own God, became a Free Mason, read up on occultism and so on. Please read this Message. God explained everything to me. I am hungry for the Eucharist\n\nGod Bless you.\n\nYou Were Wrestling With Me\n\nDecember 22, 1990\n\nMy Jesus?\n\nI am;\n\nI treat you very gently so that you, as My flower, grow; I want you strong and believe Me I shall make it possible; you shall be strong, daughter(Son), since you carry My Word; in front of you, I Am, to break all barriers that come up while you are witnessing; I am the Most High, and I tell you, daughter(son), that I shall see to it that no power from beneath stops you from proclaiming My Message;\n\nI have taken you out of the land of Egypt to respond to Me in a foreign land and witness to a people not your own; so although your behaviour was appalling and your senses blemished, unabling you to see the Light, Mercy1 and Compassion was seized by your astounding misery, guilt and wretchedness and came to your rescue;\n\nno-o Vassula (Adrian), you have not deserved any of My Gifts; why, I had servants in My Hand who honoured Me, never uttering but My Name in holiness, who blessed Me without cease, who praised the Holy Trinity wholeheartedly; but yet My Heart, an Abyss of Love, cried out for you; you had accumulated sorrow upon sorrow in My Heart, treason upon treason; you were wrestling with Me, puny little creature ‚Ä¶ but I knew that your heart is not a divided heart and that once I conquer your heart, it would become entirely Mine; an object of your era, you were wrestling with Me, but I have thrown you down in the wrestle and dragged you in the dust and into the desert where I left you there, all alone;\n\nI had provided you with a guardian angel, since the beginning of your existence, to guard you, console you and guide you, but My Wisdom ordered your guardian angel to leave you and to let you face the desert on your own; I said: ‚Äùyou are to live in spite of your nakedness!‚Äù 2 because no man is able to survive alone; 3 Satan would have taken over completely and would have killed you; My order was given to him too; I forbade him to touch you then; in your terror, you remembered Me and looked up, in Heaven, searching desperately for Me; your laments and your supplications suddenly broke the deathly stillness surrounding you and your terrified cries pierced through the heavens reaching the Holy Trinity‚Äôs Ears ‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄùMy child!‚Äù the Father‚Äôs Voice, full of joy, resounded through all Heaven;\n\n‚ÄùAh‚Ä¶I shall now make her penetrate My Wounds4 and let her(him) eat My Body and drink My Blood; I shall espouse her(him) to Me and she(he) will be Mine for eternity; I shall show her(him) the Love I have for her(him) and her(his) lips from thereon shall thirst for Me and her(his) heart shall be My Headrest; she(he) shall eagerly submit daily to My Righteousness; I shall make her(him) an altar of My Love and of My Passion; I, and I only, shall be her(his) only Love and Passion; and I shall send her(him) with My Message to the ends of the world to conquer an irreligious people, and to a people who are not even her(his) own; and voluntarily she(he) will carry My Cross of Peace and Love taking the road to Calvary;‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùAnd I, the Holy Spirit, shall descend upon her(him) to reveal to her(him) the Truth and the depths of Us;5 I shall remind the world, through her(him), that the greatest of all the gifts is: LOVE;‚Äù\n\n‚Äùlet Us6 then celebrate! let all Heaven celebrate!‚Äù\n\n‚Ä¶ I have taken you by the hand and formed you to become a living sign of My Great Love; ‚Äì a witness of My Sacred Heart, and of the renewal of My Church;\n\n(The Father, then the Son, then the Holy Spirit spoke.)\n\nI am the Resurrection;\n\n1 Mercy and Compassion = The Lord.\n\n2 I became ‚Äùnaked‚Äù as soon as my guardian angel and all Heaven had turned their back to me.\n\n3 Abandoned by Heaven.\n\n4 The Son then spoke.\n\n5 The Holy Trinity.\n\n6 The Holy Trinity spoke.\n\n7 From purgatory.\n\nThe annulment process concluded, and my previous union was declared annulled, since there were irregular situations called vices and defects.\n\nGod transformed my life through a personal relationship with him, expressed in a deeper sacramental life in the Holy Catholic Church. On July 11, 2014, after 11 years of civil union, God gave me the grace of the sacrament of marriage with my wife Barbara and blessed my two children on the same day with the Sacrament of Reconciliation and First Communion. My daughter from the first civil union has given me two grandchildren and the Lord has healed the wounds between us.\n\nCurrently, my wife and I are celebrating 5 years as catechists at St. Nicholas Parish in Aurora, as well as giving testimony for the Glory of God on Channel 36 in Chicago, through a program called ‚ÄùThe Harvest of Faith.‚Äù In giving my life over to God, I formally renounced Freemasonry in a written letter of resignation and gave testimony of the truth of Jesus Christ our Savior before the members of the Masonic Lodge to which I belonged in the past.\n\nThe Fire of the Holy Spirit impels me to bring more souls to God by sharing the Holy Gospel. At the same time, I work to expose the falsehood of Freemasonry‚Äôs doctrine, which the True Life in God messages illuminated for me by revealing the purposes and objectives of these false and dangerous teachings.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAdrian Ortega\n\nUnity According to the Second Vatican Council and Vassula Ryd√©n\n\nFr. Kaszowski has taught dogmatic theology at the Archdiocesan Seminary of Katowice, Poland for the past 20 years.\n\nVassula Ryden, the author of True Life in God, is called the apostle of unity. In effect her mission to unify the Church of Christ, torn by schisms, appears as her principal task, the most clearly delineated in the messages.\n\nHowever, a short time ago, Vassula Ryden was reproached for allegedly proclaiming a false ecumenism that is rejected by the Catholic Church. For this reason, it is worthwhile to compare her teachings with those of the Second Vatican Council, because the latter lays out the doctrine on unity which must be accepted by all Catholics.\n\nI. WHERE IS THE TRUE CHURCH TO BE FOUND?\n\nThe Second Vatican, Council, which sought to accelerate the process of the unifying the Church, first of all had to resolve a problem which is at once important and difficult. That is, how to define the relationship between the One Church founded by Jesus Christ and the many churches which exist today.\n\nThe Church of Christ and the many churches\n\nIn order to respond to this difficult question, the Council avails itself of the notion of the Church of Christ which subsists in the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant Churches. Thus, the Council explains:\n\n‚ÄùThis Church, constituted and organized as a society in the present world, subsists in the Catholic Church, which was governed by the successor of Peter and by the bishops in communion with him. Nevertheless, many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside its visible confines. Since these are gifts belonging to the Church of Christ, they are forces impelling towards Catholic unity.‚Äù (Lumen Gentium, 8)\n\nThis affirmation constitutes a basis for the conciliar doctrine on unity and ecumenism. An example will make this more clear: suppose that in each country there are several libraries, some large and some small. In comparing them, we could say that certain books are found in all of them, and other books only in the largest library.\n\nThe Catholic Church and other churches\n\nWe might also say, in line with the Second Vatican Council, that the Catholic Church might be equated to the largest library; the Orthodox Church as being a bit smaller, and the other churches as still smaller libraries.\n\nSimilarly the churches, as is the case with the libraries, are not equal because they do not always possess all the means of salvation given by Christ. Nonetheless, the members of all religions are equal in that they are all persons created by God. It is somewhat similar with the libraries: although in the smallest, one can find precious books, but the libraries themselves are not equal by reason of the quantity of volumes that each possesses. Nonetheless, the people who borrow the books from the libraries are all equal from the standpoint of their human dignity.\n\nThus the Council expresses, on the one hand, its conviction that the Church of Christ subsists in its fullness in the Catholic Church. On the other hand, the Council perceives and appreciates the numerous elements of sanctification and truth which belong uniquely to the Church of Christ but are, nonetheless, found in the non-Catholic churches.\n\nWhat comes from Christ and the Holy Spirit sanctifies and saves\n\nThe Council declares that all the elements of sanctification and of truth, including those found outside the Catholic Church insofar as they come from Christ and the Holy Spirit, lead to sanctification and to salvation. In fact, the decree Unitatis redintegratio 3 explains: ‚ÄùMoreover some, even very many, of the most significant elements and endowments which together go to build up and give life to the Church itself, can exist outside the visible boundaries of the Catholic Church: the written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope and charity, along with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as visible elements. All of these, which come from Christ and lead back to Him, belong by right to the One Church of Christ.\n\n‚ÄùThe brethren divided from us also carry out many liturgical actions of the Christian religion. In ways that vary according to the condition of each church or community, these liturgical actions most certainly can truly engender a life of grace and, one must say, can aptly give access to the communion of salvation.‚Äù\n\nOne might explain the Conciliar teaching thus: in the small libraries many books are missing. Nonetheless, those found there can be well utilized: they can be borrowed and read profitably.\n\nGood elements but also distortions\n\nThe Council doctrine cited above is very optimistic because it recognizes elements of the one unique Church of Christ in all churches and ecclesiastical communities. Unfortunately, there remains another side of the problem of which the Council is well aware. Certain means of salvation are missing to varying degrees in non-Catholic churches, such as ordination and the sacrament of penance; their veneration of the Virgin Mary and the saints is fragmented; and all the non-Catholic churches have rejected the very precious gift offered by Christ to His Church to protect their unity and faith and the truth: the ministry of the Bishop of Rome.\n\nCiting once again the example of the libraries, one could say that certain churches are like libraries that have been damaged by fire that has not completely destroyed them but has burned completely, or at least partially, many books. It is necessary, thus, to replace the ruined books because it does no good to loan them out: they are unreadable.\n\nThe Conciliar doctrine on the Church of Christ which subsists in the churches shows the road toward true ecumenism and indicates several practical steps noted in Unitatis redintegratio, 5-12. Let us examine them and compare them with what is brought out in the messages transmitted by Mrs. Vassula Ryden.\n\nII. THE ROAD TOWARD CHURCH UNITY\n\nThe Council and the True Life in God messages show us a unity which can be brought about by conversion, love, and a humility that respects the dignity and the equality of the other. It is a unity created by all the good which comes from Christ and the Holy Spirit. It is based on truth that is respected and never rejected.\n\nUnity by sincere conversion\n\n‚ÄùThere can be no ecumenism worthy of the name without interior conversion,‚Äù declares Unitatis redintegratio, 7. Indeed, unity must be authentic; it cannot be reduced to a signature on an agreement- to a declaration which touches neither the heart nor the spirit.\n\nUnity must, therefore, originate first of all in the hearts of men turned with love and esteem toward each brother and sister in Christ. For this reason, the Council speaks firstly of spiritual ecumenism which comes about through a change of mentality by conversion, holiness of life and by prayer. ‚ÄùThis change of heart and holiness of life, along with public and private prayer for the unity of Christians, should be regarded as the soul of the whole ecumenical movement and merits the name, ‚Äôspiritual ecumenism‚Äù‚Äô (Unitatis redintegratio, 8). This spiritual ecumenism is thus produced in the heart. It manifests itself in love, respect for the other person and in profound and sincere conversion.\n\nThe message of Jesus given through Vassula also speaks to us of a ‚Äùspiritual‚Äù ecumenism which begins in the heart of man. Here are some examples:\n\nSeptember 23, 1991:\n\n‚ÄùThe Kingdom of God is love, peace, unity and faith in the heart. It is the Lord‚Äôs Church united in one inside your heart‚Ä¶. I implore My children to unite in heart and voice and rebuild My Son‚Äôs primitive Church in their heart. I am saying My Son‚Äôs primitive Church, since that Church was constructed on love, simplicity, humility and faith. I do not mean for you to reconstruct a new edifice, I mean for you to reconstruct an edifice inside your heart. I mean for you to knock down the old bricks inside your heart-bricks of disuruon, intolerance, unfaithfulness, unforgiveness, lack of love, and to reconstruct My Son‚Äôs Church by reconciling. You need intense poverty of the spirit and an overflow of wealth of generosity‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nOctober 13,1991:\n\n‚ÄùThe real Christian is the one who is inwardly a Christian, and the real unity is and will be in the heart. Unity will not be of the letter but of the spirit.‚Äù\n\nOctober 14, 1992:\n\n‚ÄùUnity will be in your heart‚Ä¶and not by signed treaty.‚Äù\n\nLove and humility create unity\n\nLack of love, pride and rigidity cause division. In contrast, complete love, gentleness and humility lead the Church and humanity toward perfect unity. Vatican Council II reminds us by emphasizing the importance of humility. ‚ÄùWe should therefore pray to the Holy Spirit for the grace to be genuinely self-denying, humble, gentle in the service of others and to have an attitude of brotherly generosity toward them.‚Äù (Unitatis redintegratio 7).\n\nThe singular importance of humility for unity of the Church is enhanced also in messages of True Life in God which could be considered the perfect commentary on the conciliar decrees.\n\n‚ÄùHumility with love is the key to unity: Love and Humility will be the other key for Unity. Take those keys and use them, use them My beloved and be one, be One Holy People.‚Äù (T.L.I.G., August 9, 1989).\n\nHumility rejects pride and rigidity born of excessive ambition. It bends man to become the servant of those around him. It is thus that unity must be built:\n\n‚ÄùNot until you understand that you will have to bend, will you be able to unite.‚Äù (T.L.I.G., September 23, 1991).\n\n‚ÄùBlessed are those who do not differentiate themselves under My Holy Name, but show their unity through their humility and love. They shall be called Pillars and Foundation of God‚Äôs sanctuary.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., April 14, 1991; cf. August 4, 1991).\n\n‚ÄùSo long as you do not reconcile in humility with each other and love one another as I love you, your separation will remain.‚Äù (March 27, 1992)\n\n‚Äù‚Ä¶I am one, yet each one of them made a Christ of their own. I am the Head of My Body, yet all I see are their heads, not Mine. Tell them to lower their heads and the will see Mine, tell them to lower themselves so that I may be able to lift them to Me.‚Äù (T.L.I.G., October 7, 1991)\n\nRecognize the equality and dignity of all\n\nAlthough born into different religions, all men belong to God who created the soul of each one consciously, directly and with love. ‚ÄùAll men are endowed with a rational soul and are created in God‚Äôs image; they have the same nature and origin. Being redeemed by Christ, they enjoy the same divine calling and destiny; there is here a basic equality between all men and it must be given ever greater recognition.‚Äù (Gaudium et spes 29.1)\n\nUnless one recognizes this equality, it is impossible to construct an authentic unity of the Church. Thus therefore, in each Protestant, Orthodox and Catholic it is necessary to see first of all their human dignity: of the creature who comes from God and who belongs to Him. This fundamental truth one finds in the messages of Christ written by Mrs. Vassula Ryden:\n\n‚ÄùOrthodox! Catholics! Protestants! You all belong to Me! You are all One in My Eyes! I do not make any distinction‚Ä¶‚Äù(T.L.I.G., October 27, 1987)\n\n‚ÄùTell Me, are you not all alike, made by My Own hands?‚Ä¶ Who has not been made according to the likeness of My Image?‚Ä¶ Many of them talk of unity and brotherhood but their words are fallacious, void.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., November 25, 1991)\n\nWe are ‚Äôone‚Äô in the eyes of God who loves equally the people of all religions, and this is why we must respect them also if we are to have a unified church.\n\nThere is yet another reason for the equality of all Christians emphasized by the Council; that is baptism. ‚ÄùBaptism, therefore, constitutes the sacramental bond of unity existing among all through it are reborn.‚Äù (Unitatis redintegratio, 22).\n\nThanks to baptism, communities-Catholic as well as non-Catholic-constitute the real Mystical Body of Christ; that is to say, the Church of Christ. For this reason, in the message given through Vassula, Jesus declares to us on the subject of Christian communities:\n\n‚ÄùAll are the same in My Eyes‚Äù(October 27,1987).\n\nFrom the expression ‚Äùthe same‚Äù one could understand that they are the same mystical body of Christ which is torn and divided by people and is still often deprived of the necessary means given by Christ for Its development.\n\nThe context of the writings of Vassula indicates that certain communities or denominations are ‚Äùthe same‚Äù and ‚Äùalike‚Äù in that they are part of the mystical body of Christ. But they have splintered throughout history, often thereby becoming impoverished in rejecting part of the truth and certain means of salvation given by Christ to His Church. They are like the libraries which, while still remaining libraries, allow a part of their books to be destroyed.\n\nAppreciate and share the gifts of God\n\nThe Council recalls ‚Äùmoreover, some, even very many of the most significant elements and endowments which together go to build up and to give life to the Church itself, can exist outside the visible boundaries of the Catholic Church‚Ä¶‚Äù (Unitatis redintegratio, 3). Since the elements of the truth, of endowments coming from Christ and the Holy Spirit build up and give life to the Church, they must be shared. The dogmatic constitution (Lumen Gentium, 15) mentions certain of the values present in non-Catholic churches: veneration of Holy Scripture; religious zeal; faith and love for Almighty God the Father and for Christ, the Son of God, our Saviour; the grace of baptism; prayer, the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit; and witnessing to the point of shedding one‚Äôs blood. Paragraph 15 of Unitatis redintegratio enumerates values which can be found in the Eastern Churches: the true sacraments, above all the Eucharist, the veneration of Mary, Ever Virgin, and of the saints; the riches of spiritual traditions which are expressed above all by the monastic life, the liturgical patrimony, etc.\n\nThe Council not only points to the workings of the Holy Spirit which operates in the sister Churches but, furthermore, counsels Catholics to draw profit from them. ‚ÄùTherefore, it is earnestly recommended that Catholics avail themselves more often of the spiritual riches of the Eastern Fathers which lift up the whole man to the contemplation of divine mysteries (Unitatis redintegratio 15)\n\nThus, according to Vatican II, it is very useful for the unity of the Church to recognize and to share all of whatever comes from Christ and the Holy Spirit within or from outside the Catholic Church. However, it is necessary to share only the works of God, because those which have been deformed by man are no longer capable of personal enrichment.\n\nOne finds the same path to unity ‚Äì by mutual enrichment and sharing ‚Äì in the True Life in God message. Jesus says:\n\n‚ÄùUnity, My Child, is to give to each other your riches.‚Äù (T.L.I.G., April 13, 1991)\n\nBy His messages, Jesus reveals to Vassula, an Orthodox, the riches found in the Catholic Church. He counsels her to accept these riches and to profit from them.\n\nIndeed, Jesus asks her to practice that which is not to be found in her Orthodox Church: the Way of the Cross (for example, T.L.I.G., May 29, 1987), the Rosary (for example, T.L.I.G., December 28, 1987); veneration of His Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of His Mother (for example, T.L.I.G., January 25, 1988).\n\nJesus desires that through Vassula‚Äôs example, all Christians will profit from the spiritual benefits found in the Catholic Church. For instance, meditating on the Way of the Cross as a source of grace for everyone.\n\n‚Äù‚Ä¶You are to transmit and show how to do the Stations of My Cross (the way it pleases your Lord) to all those who bear witness for me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùAll Christians, Lord ? ‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùYes, to all those who love Me. I the Lord do not want any divisions in My Church.‚Äù(T. L. L G., March 19, 1988)\n\nIn the same way the Rosary can spiritually enrich every Christian. That is why Jesus says to Vassula:\n\n‚Äù‚Ä¶for my sake, Vassula, will you learn the Rosary? Hail My Mother at all times-will you do this for Me, Vassula?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùLord I have never been taught.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùDo I not know this Vassula, this is why I come to teach you and all those who never heard the Rosary.‚Äù\n\nYes Lord, I am willing to learn, Lord-help me learn.\n\n‚ÄùThis is what I desire to hear from all of you who do not know; the same words: ‚ÄùYes Lord, I am willing to learn, help me learn.‚Äù(December 28, 1987)\n\nIn teaching Vassula the devotion to His Sacred Heart, Jesus wants to fill her-and also all who will follow her example-with graces, with joy and with peace: ‚Äù‚Ä¶come and abide in My Sacred Heart, where in its depths you will find peace and will feel My ardent Love I have for all of you. You will be able to tell them of My love for them. (January 24, 1987)\n\nJesus is anxious that pastors, in the communities for which they are responsible, not reject any means which could help to better comprehend His incomprehensible love; and since that is not always the case, He gives notice that:\n\n‚ÄùMy Church I will clean; I will sweep away all those that obstruct the way to divine love and‚Ä¶My Sacred Heart.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., December 2, 1987)\n\n‚Äù‚Ä¶it is Love speaking to a hostile world; it is Love knocking on every locked door; it is Love calling from the other side of the wall separating us, built up by My enemies; it is Love pleading as a beggar for a return of Love‚Ä¶a smile‚Ä¶a regret‚Ä¶a sigh. It is I, the Sacred Heart. I come once more to revive this dying flame in your heart into a consuming fire of tenderness and love. I descend to outpour lavishly all the treasures of My Heart on you humanity and give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death‚Ä¶.Ah, creation! What will I not do for you?‚Äù(T.L.I.G., September 12, 1990)\n\nThe messages received by Vassula bring out not only the forms of prayer and devotions known in the Catholic Church, but above all the truths of the faith forgotten or else rejected by non-Catholics and, unfortunately, by many Catholics of our day.\n\nAmong the truths rejected are those of the primacy and infallibility of the Pope. This is why in the message of March 18, 1991, the Blessed Virgin Mary reminds all Catholics and non-Catholics that it is necessary to be in union with and cooperate with the Bishop of Rome: ‚ÄùEvery priest has been given the grace by God to act and represent My Son, and so I pray for those who are not yet submitting humbly to the Vicar of the Church to submit and be willing. Jesus is faithful and true. (T.L.I.G., March 18, 1991)\n\nThe message of True Life in God recalls at several junctures the necessity to unify the Church around the Pope. This is one of the major themes of the writings (for example: T.L.I.G., December 12, 1987; May 5, 1988; May 16, 1988; June 3, 1988; June 4, 1988; June 21, 1988; November 8, 1988; December 3, 1988; February 9, 1989; March 17, I993, etc.)\n\nThe messages given to Vassula recall not only the role of the Bishop of Rome but also other truths and traditions forgotten not only by non-Catholic churches but also by many Catholics today. These lost values are above all:\n\n‚Äì faith in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist (for example: T.L.I.G., June 3, 1989; April 13, 1991);\n\n‚Äì faith in the Perpetual Eucharistic Sacrifice of Christ (for example: T.L.I.G., January 30, 1989; October 22, 1990; May 2, 1991; June 2, 1991; June 6,1991; July 16, 1991; November 25, 1991; April 19, 1992; May 27, 1993; June 1, 1993; December 13, 1993; December 20, 1993; December 22, 1993; August 23, 1994; October 14, 1994; October 24, 1994);\n\n‚Äì the value of frequent sacramental confession (for example: February 15, 1987; November 3, 1990; March 20, 1991);\n\n‚Äì veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary (for example: December 12, 1987; December 22, 1987) and of the saints (for example: September 27, 1987);\n\n‚Äì the efficacy of using images and statues representing God and the saints (for example: October 26, 1987; August 6, 1988)\n\nThus, the messages received by Vassula encourage her to accept not only some precious prayers and devotions but again, all the doctrine entrusted to the Catholic Church, including the primacy of the Pope.\n\nHowever, Jesus does not oblige Vassula to break with uniquely Orthodox liturgy and prayers. On the contrary, He asks her to make known to other Christians that which is most precious in her Orthodox Church. As an example, Jesus asks Vassula teach the non-Orthodox the Orthodox Rosary called the ‚ÄùPrayer of Jesus‚Äù:\n\n‚ÄùAsk Me every day, ‚ÄôLord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, the sinner‚Äô. Daughter, teach your brothers this prayer‚Ä¶‚Äù(T.L.I.G., January 18, 1990)\n\nThus, the unity proclaimed by True Life in God is to appreciate all the existing inspirations of the Holy Spirit in the churches and to share these values for mutual enrichment.\n\nThis concept of unity is identical to that of Vatican II. The conciliar decree on ecumenism, (Unitatis redintegratio, 16) says that unity of the Church does not require renouncing the diversity of liturgies, prayers, customs and dress. ‚ÄùTo remove all shadow of doubt, then, this Holy Synod solemnly declares that the Churches of the East, while keeping in mind the necessary unity of the whole Church, have the power to govern themselves according to their own disciplines, since these are better suited to the character of their faithful and better adapted to foster the good of souls.‚Äù (Unitatis redintegratio, 16).\n\nFurthermore, the Council emphasizes that a certain diversity created by the Holy Spirit constitutes a richness for the Church: ‚Äùfar from being an obstacle to the Church‚Äôs unity, such diversity of customs and observances only adds to her beauty and contributes greatly to carrying out her mission.‚Äù (Unitatis redintegratio, 16).\n\nNever reject any truth, but accept it completely\n\nWhile calling for respect of all Christian churches and the works of the Holy Spirit found in them, the Council does not ignore the differences which divide these communities. It is above all a matter of different interpretations of the revealed truth. Indeed, in speaking of the Protestant churches, the document Unitatis redintegratio declares:\n\n‚ÄùWe are indeed aware that there exist considerable differences from the doctrine of the Catholic Church even concerning Christ‚Äôs Word of God made flesh and the work of redemption, and thus, concerning the mystery and ministry of the Church and the role of Mary in the work of salvation.‚Äù (Unitatis redintegratio, 20).\n\nOne cannot unite the Church by distancing it from the Truth of Christ, but on the contrary, by drawing closer to it. In the domain of truth no concession is admissible: it must be loved and sought after as the Council reminds us:\n\n‚ÄùFurthermore, in ecumenical dialogue, Catholic theologians standing fast by the teaching of the Church yet searching together with separated brethren into the divine mysteries should do so with love for the truth, with charity, and with humility.‚Äù (Unitatis redintegratio, 11).\n\nThus, unity of the Church is built on the acceptance of the entire truth given by God. This is a thesis of the Council and, at the same time, of the message of True Life in God which can be considered as an urgent appeal to the faithful to follow the truth-a call that is addressed as much to non-Catholics as to present-day Catholics.\n\n‚ÄùAlways defend to death the truth‚Äù says Jesus, not only to Vassula, but to each of His disciples (T.L.I.G., September 23, 1991).\n\nIn these messages there is nothing of the false ecumenism which would seek to unite Christians by rejecting a part of the truth because it displeases one church; for example, the unique role of Mary in the work of redemption, or that of the Pope in the Church. One could compare a false ecumenism to an absurd situation in which libraries wanting to become completely alike would destroy their most precious books of which the other libraries had been deprived or else it would send copies of the books which have been totally destroyed and charred by the fire in order to ‚Äùenrich‚Äù the other libraries. Hence, false ecumenism proposes unity by the exchange of that which is least good and precious in the Church, for example a lack of respect for the Blessed Virgin. It is ready to sacrifice truth and even the commandments of God in order to overcome differences between the churches. This is inadmissable: one cannot transmit to others errors and distortions that arose during centuries of human meanness.\n\nThere is not a trace of this false ecumenism in the writings of Vassula which call for an acceptance of the whole truth without rejecting any part of it. As an example of this attitude, one could cite a stern dialogue of Jesus with Vassula on the subject of Protestants who reject the royal dignity of the Blessed Virgin and the ministry of the Pope.\n\n‚ÄùMy God, the Protestants will be shocked!‚Äù says Vassula.\n\nJesus answers: ‚ÄùVassula, I have been waiting years for them to change, now leave Me free to write down My desires. (‚Ä¶) listen, can one hear Me only when it is convenient for him, then shut his ears when what I say does not suit him?(‚Ä¶) I have come to unite you all. Would any disciple of Mine deny My appeal?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùNo, not if they are sincere, Lord.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùBy this statement you gave Me hangs all that there is to say; ‚Äôif they are sincere‚Äô then they will listen. I come to shine on you all and enlighten you to be able to unite you, but to My great sorrow there will be those who would prefer darkness to the light because their deeds are evil. They would refuse to come under My Light for fear of exposing their deeds, but My devoted ones and those that sincerely acknowledge My Works and follow Me will come under My Light exposing without fear their deeds, because they will show that what they do is done in Me, their God. I have said that if you make My Word your home, you will indeed be my disciples; you will learn the Truth and the Truth will make you free.‚Äù(December 23, 1987).\n\nThis dialogue makes clear that unity of the Church will not be realized by rejection of the truth nor by ‚Äùdiplomacy‚Äù which avoids speaking of differences, but rather by a sincere openness to all the truth of the Gospel. The whole truth must be accepted for perfect unity of the Church, not only that of the Holy Trinity of Christ Our Saviour, but also that of His Real Presence in the Eucharist, His Perpetual Sacrifice; of the special role confided to the Blessed Virgin Mary by God; of the primacy and infallibility of the Pope; of frequent personal confession, etc.\n\nThus, unity of the Church requires acceptance of the whole truth by all: if a Catholic or a non-Catholic rejects it, it is a betrayal. Errors, rationalism and moral relativism must be rejected to the same degree by all believers in Christ.\n\nAccept the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist\n\nThe Council teaches that ecumenical efforts must culminate in full Eucharistic communion. ‚ÄùThe results will be that, little by little, as the obstacles to perfect ecclesiastical communion are overcome, all Christians will be gathered, in a common celebration of the Eucharist, into the unity of the one and only church‚Ä¶ (Unitatis redintegratio, 4).\n\nUnfortunately, there are certain obstacles at present impeding the way toward a perfect community of all Christians around one Eucharistic table. Among these obstacles is the false doctrine which denies the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist and which rejects His Perpetual Sacrifice. These obstacles must be overcome by prayer and ecumenical dialogue.\n\nThe message transmitted by Vassula also shows the importance of the Eucharist. It is paramount for unity to recognize the Real Presence in the Eucharist of He who wishes us to unite around Him.\n\n‚ÄùMy Sacred Heart is calling you all to come to Me in holiness. Lean on Me and I shall guide you to My tabernacle, where I am waiting for you day and night. I am offering Myself every day. Come, come and receive Me in holiness and in purity; do not offend Me. Be pure and holy when you receive Me; recollect yourselves and recognize My Living Presence in the little white host, let Me feel your holiness and purity.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., June 3, 1989; cf. April 13, 1991; October 14, 1991).\n\nBelieve in the Eucharistic Sacrifice\n\nAnother truth which must be accepted by all Christians is that during the Eucharistic celebration Christ‚Äôs unique sacrifice on Calvary is brought into the present. Unfortunately, this truth -heretofore always taught by the Catholic Church ‚Äì is denied not only by some non-Catholic churches, but also by certain Catholic theologians.\n\nFor this reason, Jesus reminds us in the message of November 25, 1991: ‚ÄùThe greatness of My Church exceeded everything and every living creature because the Eucharist made the life of My Church. If My Church today lacks brightness it is because many of My Churches have abolished My Perpetual Sacrifice.‚Äù\n\nFull unity of the Church will be realized the day when all peoples gather around Jesus really present in the Eucharist and around His unique salvific sacrifice:\n\n‚Äùthe nations shall then speak one language and all of them shall worship Me around One Single Tabernacle, this One of the Sacrificial Lamb, this One of the Perpetual Sacrifice that My enemies are trying to abolish and replace by their disastrous abomination.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., May 2, 1991) (Daniel 11:31)\n\nThe disastrous abomination is at once the work of Satan and of men who allow themselves to be led by him. This abomination is among other things the lack of faith in Christ really present in the Eucharist and in His Perpetual Sacrifice which saves generations of every epoch. The disastrous abomination is again the absence of the spiritual sacrifice in the temple of our hearts. There the filial attitude of obedience to the will of God-which constitutes the essential element of every spiritual offering-is more and more replaced by rebellion, disobedience and unbelief. Thus it is nothing less than a disastrous abomination when the Eucharist is put off to the side in our lives and the sacrificial attitude dies in the temples of the hearts of men.\n\n‚ÄùThe disastrous abomination is the spirit of Rebellion that claims to be My equal. It is the spirit of evil that enthroned itself in My sanctuary taking the place of My Perpetual Sacrifice, turning your generation Godless. It is the spirit of rationalism and naturalism that led most of you into atheism, this is the spirit that makes you believe you are selfsufficient and that you can achieve everything by your own efforts and by your own strength. This disastrous abomination turned you into a waterless country of drought, a desert. My Perpetual Sacrifice you have abolished from within you because you have lost your faith generation.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., June 6, 1991)\n\nRecognize the special role of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the work of salvation\n\nFidelity to the truth-so important for the perfect unity of the church-requires recognition of the singular role confided to the Blessed Virgin by God himself in salvation history.\n\nThe decree Unitatis redintegratio of Vatican II declares with joy that in the Eastern Churches the Blessed Virgin is venerated; that she is ‚Äùpaid high tribute, in beautiful hymns of praise‚Äù (15). In speaking of Protestants, the Council declares the divergence between them and the Catholic Church regarding the role of the Holy Virgin in the work of salvation (cf. Unitatis redintegratio, 20).\n\nCertainly, perfect unity in love and in truth demands the recognition of all the salvific duties confided by God in His love to Mary and all the special graces that She has received. All believers must also unite in veneration of the Blessed Virgin.\n\nThis necessity is very strongly emphasized in the message given to Vassula. Indeed Jesus insists: ‚ÄùMy Mother‚Äôs Immaculate Heart is united to Mine. I desire from each one of you the devotion Her Immaculate Heart deserves. You see, daughter, how our Divine Hearts are covered by thorns from men who only show Us ingratitude, sacrilege, lack of love-it is the whole of their sins. Vassula, I who am the Word, love and respect Her. I desire you to approach My Mother and honour her as I honour her. I desire that every knee bend, honouring her, I desire you to pray the Rosary and Hail your Holy Mother. I want you to repair your sins; asking her to teach you.‚Äù(January 25, 1988)\n\nJesus who loves and respects his mother Himself gives the example to all believers-not only to Catholics-of how to love and respect her. In the name of truth one cannot diminish the grandeur of the one chosen by the Heavenly Father Himself who entrusted to Her without the slightest hesitation His well-beloved Son. He knew She would not disappoint Him. And indeed it was so.\n\nRemain in unity with the Pope\n\nTrue Life in God reminds us that perfect unity of the Church can only be realized around the Pope. This truth is repeated courageously at many points throughout the writings of Vassula. With courage because the primacy and the infallibility of the Bishop of Rome is among those truths which have very little popularity, not only among Orthodox and Protestant, but lately also among many Catholics, even theologians, who dispute it.\n\nJesus therefore says in some of His messages: ‚ÄùPurify yourselves, repent. Obey the Vicar of My Church, John Paul II, who never fails you, but whom you push aside and ignore. All you who are still scoffing at Him are weighing ever so heavily on My Sacred Heart‚Ä¶‚Äù(T.L.I.G., June 1, 1989)\n\n‚ÄùI come to unite My Church; I come to remind you to whom I, the Lord, have given the Authority and the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., May 23, 1988; cf. March 19, 1988; February 9, 1989)\n\nPurify yourself often in the Sacrament of Reconciliation\n\nThe Council reminds us that divisions in the Church were often due to the errors of men on both sides (Unitatis redintegratio, 3). Again today, lack of love and pride divide the Church, or at least slow down the process of unity. For this reason, all Christians must be always conscious of their sins and not those of others. This is why the Council reminds us: ‚ÄùThe testimony of St. John the Evangelist can also be applied to sins against unity: ‚Äôif we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us‚Äô (1 John 1:10). Thus, in humble prayer we beg pardon of God and of our separated brethren, just as we forgive them that offend us.‚Äù (Unitatis redintegratio, 7)\n\nConsequently, if one wishes to unite the Church, purification by sincere repentance and sacramental confession is necessary. Unfortunately, the sacrament of penance is not accepted, not only by Protestants, but in our day by many Catholics. Less and less advantage is taken of this sacrament by which Jesus frees us from our sins, purifies and unites us with the Father and the Church. It is only through this sacrament that unity of the Church is to be realized.\n\nThe messages transmitted by Vassula remind us of this sacrament so forgotten and neglected and of the necessity for frequent individual confession.\n\nJesus says: ‚ÄùI have given you confessors; when My beloved ones you are confessing to him, you are only confessing to Me-it is to Me you are confessing‚Äù(T.L.I.G., September 29, 1988).\n\n‚ÄùBe constant in your confessions little children; to be able to come and receive Me in the Holy Eucharist as often as you can. Fast on bread and water two days a week to make reparations and sacrifice.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., August 2, 1991)\n\n‚ÄùWhen you come to me make sure before how you will receive Me. Examine yourselves, recollect yourselves. Honour Me fully by repenting and often confessing.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., September 29, 1988)\n\n‚ÄùAlas for him who offends Me by refusing confession and absolution and comes to receive My Son guilty! Repent! Repent for your sins!‚Äù(T.L.I.G., March 20, 1991)\n\nA sincere dialogue\n\nThus-according to Vatican Council II and True Life in God-unity of the Church can be realized through profound change of heart by men who begin to love sincerely. Another requirement of authentic unity is absolute fidelity to the truth, even to that which is no longer popular. One can achieve unity in following the path of love of God, of men, and of truth.\n\nThis love is indispensable when one engages in the ecumenical dialogue which according to Vatican II is very important for unity. Besides conversion, love, humility, mutual respect and communal prayer, this dialogue can be considered the most important means toward unity. Its goal is better mutual awareness and rediscovery of what Christ is really transmitting to His Church. (cf. Unitatis redintegratio, 4)\n\nThis dialogue leads toward unity but on condition that it is sincere, profound and with an increasingly ardent and authentic desire for unity. Otherwise, it will degenerate into endless discussions, polemics, quarrels or polite conversation without meaningful results. The messages through Vassula warn against such a fruitless dialogue. Jesus says:\n\n‚ÄùI am weary of hearing their noble language; perhaps it is suitable and eloquent for them, but to Me it sounds like a stroke on a gong because it is empty with emptiness. I have come to talk to them-first out of concern, then out of pity; but no one yet to this day has lowered his voice to hear My Voice. Alas for you who say you are at My service yet prevent My Kingdom from finding unity and stability!‚Äù(T.L.I.G., December 21, 1992)\n\n‚ÄùGo from country to country and tell those who speak of unity yet never cease to think the contrary and continue to live the contrary that their division has separated My Heart from theirs.‚Äù(October 7, 1991)\n\nA common date of Easter\n\nFor different reasons it is still not possible for all Christians to celebrate the Eucharist together. This is why the Council advises us to unify at every level where it is possible: in action and above all, in common prayer. For all Christians to celebrate on the same day the Mystery of the death and resurrection of Christ would be an important sign of unity. Unfortunately, until now, Catholics and Orthodox have not established a common date for Easter.\n\nThe Council strongly desires unity in the celebration of the Paschal Mystery. The Conciliar decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum expresses this desire: ‚ÄùUntil all Christians agree, as is hoped, on one day for the celebration of Easter by all, in the meantime as a means of fostering unity among Christians who live in the same area or country, it is left to the patriarchs or to the supreme ecclesiastical authorities of the place to consult all parties involved and so come to unanimous agreement to celebrate the feast of Easter on the same Sunday.‚Äù (20) In the True Life in God messages an accord between Orthodox and Catholics on a common date of Easter appears to be a very important thing. Indeed, Jesus complains:\n\n‚ÄùWill I, brother, one more season go through the pain I have been going through year after year? Or will you give Me rest this time? Am I going to drink one more season the cup of your division? Or will you rest My Body and unify for My Sake the Feast of Easter? In unifying the date of Easter, you will alleviate My pain, brother, and you will rejoice in Me and I in you, and I will have the sight of many restored.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., October 14, 1991)\n\nUnifying the date of Easter would express good will and a sincere desire for unity because there are no doctrinal reasons which impede celebrating at the same time the death and the resurrection of our Lord. On the contrary, from a theological point of view, it is the simplest thing and but, alas, up to the present has not succeeded! It is probably for this reason that the plea of Jesus is so dramatic:\n\n‚ÄùAm I, Father, to drink one more season of the cup of their division or will they at least unify the Feast of Easter, alleviating part of My pain and sorrow?‚Äù(T.L.I.G., October 25, 1991)\n\n‚ÄùWhen will they all pass a decree by unanimous vote to celebrate the Feast of Easter all on one date?‚Äù(December 21, 1992)\n\n‚Äù‚Ä¶pray for the urufication of the dates of Easter.‚Äù(April 8, 1993)\n\nUnity will survive\n\nThe Council, fully cognizant of the difficulties attached to ecumenism, fully believes in the future unity of the Church which will, however, be the work of the Holy Trinity. ‚ÄùIt therefore places its hope entirely in the prayer of Christ for the Church, in the love of the Father for us, and in the power of the Holy Spirit.‚Äù (Unitatis redintegratio, 24) One finds this same hope also in the writings of Mrs. Ryden: we must journey toward imminent uruon by our conversion, love, humility and prayer, but it will be achieved by Christ and the Holy Spirit.\n\n‚ÄùMy beloved ones, the day is near when every vision will come true, every vision will soon be fulfilled and in your own lifetime, too. So open your hearts and try to understand why My Spirit of Grace is poured on this generation so generously. The Day is drawing near, when all generations shall be one, under one Shepherd, around one Holy Tabernacle and I, the Lord, shall be unique for them. So pray My beloved ones, pray for this unity which I, the Lord, am in full preparation for.‚Äù(T.L.I.G., June 19, 1989)\n\n‚ÄùLet Me tell you once more that My Body I will glorify and unite.‚Äù(October 18, 1987)\n\nThe vision of the three bars also shows that unity will be accomplished by the power from on high. Thus, Jesus says to Vassula:\n\n‚ÄùDraw three iron bars with a head on the top. These represent the Roman Catholics, the Orthodox and the Protestants. I want them to bend and unite but these iron bars are still very stiff and cannot bend on their own, so I shall have to come to them with My fire and with the power of My flame upon them they shall turn soft to bend and mold into one solid iron bar, and My Glory will fill the whole earth.‚Äù (T.L.I.G., October 26, 1989) ‚ÄùThis is how My Spirit will unite every single one of you in the end and everyone will believe it was the Father who sent Me, everyone will recognize Me as the sacrificial lamb.‚Äù(May 30, 1993)\n\nIII. CONCLUSIONS\n\nAnalysis of Vatican II documents and of the writings of Vassula Ryden imposes the following conclusion: there is a perfect concordance between the two in their teaching on unity. However, the difference in style and in the ideas used exclude any hypothesis that Vassula took advantage of the documents of the Second Vatican Council. This concordance can only be explained, therefore, by its coming from the same Person who influenced the Fathers of the Council and Vassula Ryden. One could say that we see the same principal Author of the Conciliar documents and of the writings of Vassula.\n\nThe teaching on the unity of the Church which emerges from the writings of Mrs. Ryden is identical to that of Vatican II. Hence, those who impute to her a ‚Äùpan-Christiari‚Äô unity thereby prove that they are not at all familiar with her writings.\n\nThere is also a moral aspect to the accusations against the teachings of Mrs. Ryden. Anyone who accuses her of a doctrine on uruty that is contrary to the teaching of the Church is telling a lie and spreading calumny. Consequently, if one wishes to be faithful to Christ-he must do justice and rectify the wrong done not only to her, but also to the work of unity so much desired by Jesus and by Vatican II.\n\n‚ÄùThis Sacred Council firmly hopes that the initiatives of the sons of the Catholic Church, joined with those of the separated brethren, will go forward, without obstructing the ways of divine providence, and without pre-judging the future inspirations of the Holy Spirit.‚Äù (Unitatis redintegratio, 24) This desire of the Council at the same time sounds a warning to those who through their thoughtlessness and imprudent zeal cause harm to the progress toward unity (cf. Unitatis redintegratio, 24).\n\nThe author of this article, Father Doctor Michael Kaszowski, received his doctorate from the Catholic University of Louvain and has taught dogmatic theology at the Archdiocesan Seminary of Katowice, Poland for the past 20 years. He has written several books of a pastoral nature, including works on deepening the faith among children and youth. As the editor of the Polish edition of True Life in God, he knows the messages in depth. He is an firmly orthodox theologian of stature who has consistently affirmed that there is no trace of error found in the writings of Vassula. He has expressed this conclusion in two prefaces and in a defense of Vassula which appear in the Polish edition. An article he wrote on private revelations is reprinted in volume 8 of the original handwriting edition of True Life in God.\n\nTestimonies from Clergy & Religious\n\nI have no dramatic testimony to offer for Vassula, but I would like to say that reading her messages puts me in a spirit of prayer. I find myself quite convinced that Jesus is indeed speaking through them. To that, I would like to add that, as a professional theologian, I have always been watching to see if these messages diverge in any way from the teaching of the Church. Never have I found any doctrinal error in them. That is very impressive. For a lay person, with no theological training, without even any serious catechetical instruction, to write so many volumes about some of the profoundest spiritual matters, and never make a mis-step, is an extraordinary achievement. It is a powerful confirmation that it is indeed the Lord himself who is the source of these writings. I am aware that she has been accused of doctrinal error by high authorities in the Church. After careful reflection on this matter, I am convinced that the so-called ‚Äùerrors‚Äù reduce simply to the fact that she fails to use the language of professional theologians when seeking to express the divine mysteries. I don‚Äôt think she can be blamed for this, as the Scriptural authors did the same.\n\n(Fr. Edward D. O‚ÄôConnor, CSC Department of Theology, University of Notre Dame, December 1999)\n\nIn reading the books of the divine messages, and knowing the author, Mrs Vassula Ryden, a daughter of the Greek Orthodox Church, I was very impressed in finding there, according to my firm conviction, an absolute fidelity to all the revealed truths as taught and expounded by the Catholic Church‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Therefore I unite myself to those Catholic bishops and theologians who defend the authenticity and sincere truthfulness of Vassula Ryden, one of the greatest mystics and seers of our times.\n\n(Frane Franic, Archbishop Emeritus of Split and Makarska, November 1995)\n\n(Vassula) travels the world evangelizing for Christian unity; obedience to the Pope; veneration of the Eucharist; devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus; and especially, a Gospel morality of life; as well as for deep religious conversion of the world. Vassula Ryden has met with the Pope, with cardinals and with bishops around the world. This is a matter of private revelation and we allow her to speak because what she says conforms to Gospel truth.\n\n(Cardinal Franjo Kuharic, Archbishop of Zagreb, February 1995)\n\nThe testimony is convincing, joyful and stimulating. Everywhere in her writings we feel the Breath of Love ‚Ä¶ The Holy Spirit is everywhere at work, giving profusely ‚Ä¶ every day Vassula‚Äôs testimony is taken more seriously and is more fully accepted. This simultaneously facilitates and accelerates the final judgement of the entire Church, which judgement will, without doubt, consider the many fruits of Vassula‚Äôs message.\n\n(Fr Lludevit Rupcic, OFM)\n\nIt can be said that Vassula Ryden is in ‚Äùmoral security‚Äù under the spiritual counselling of Fr. Michael O‚ÄôCarroll. His obvious competence should suffice to dispel the doubts of those who blindly and violently attack Vassula Ryden and her writings. Furthermore, she has the support of Fr.Rene Laurentin ‚Ä¶ For my part, having studied ascetical and mystical theology both in theory and in practice over more than fifty years, I do not hesitate to stand alongside these two ‚Äùexperts‚Äù and with the many priests who know Vassula Ryden and her writings very well ‚Ä¶ We must cease calling our fear `prudence‚Äô and our skepticism `wisdom‚Äô.\n\n(Rev O. M., C.S.C.)\n\nIt is a hieratic writing, in other words, a sacred writing ‚Ä¶ clothed in such a majestic solemnity ‚Ä¶ the writing itself inspires a great peace ‚Ä¶ radiating light and serenity. Truly this writing is beautiful and can only be good!\n\n(Rev. C. C., OFM)\n\nI feel that the evidence in favour of Vassula is very strong, and so I would urge especially those who have come to realize that Vassula may in fact be a prophet for our times to pray, fast, and reflect; in any event, to avoid spreading rumours or engaging in any attacks. With each passing day this matter will become clearer and clearer.\n\n(Fr. ‚ÄùX‚Äù, PIME)\n\nThe message in these volumes is powerful indeed. It has touched me and others deeply.\n\n(Brother E.C., New Mexico)\n\nI have been blessed to read these books. They have helped me tremendously in my spiritual life, and they have also helped many more and have brought them closer to God. Tears of repentance are many ‚Ä¶ it is not something really new, but based on scripture.\n\n(Sister I.B., Chicago)\n\nThere is a growing response to these messages here in Hong Kong.\n\n(Father F.E., Hong Kong)\n\nI have actually met Vassula in Manchester, England when I began reading her revelations and I have read and meditated all the volumes up to number 5 ‚Ä¶ I would very much like to continue to immerse myself in the Lord‚Äôs words to us. I‚Äôm totally convinced of the authenticity of these words. They have helped me immensely in my own spiritual journey. I‚Äôm passing on this revelation to people I know will be open to it ‚Ä¶ I would like to write to her personally if only to encourage her.\n\n(Father M.M., Bolivia)\n\nPeople are so hungry here for the True Life in God books that I am giving them away faster than I can keep track of them. I haven‚Äôt yet succeeded in keeping one for myself.\n\n(Sister T.R., Ukiah, California)\n\nI am hoping to convert a few fellow-priests with these books.\n\n(Rev. B.C., Toronto)\n\nFather Michael O‚ÄôCarroll, who is presently her spiritual director is adequately qualified and competent in the area of ascetical and mystical theology ‚Ä¶ the testimony of Father O‚ÄôCarroll should inspire great reassurance.\n\n(Father O.M. Canada)\n\nI managed to get our parish priest, a priest visitor and my priest confessor interested in Vassula‚Äôs life ‚Ä¶ they were happy and I was very happy ‚Ä¶ What I long to hear now is Vassula‚Äôs talks on the Holy Spirit. [I prayed] ‚ÄùOh God, if it is possible, in Your Almighty Power, cause Vassula to visit India.‚Äù\n\n(Sister A.T., India)\n\nQuelle joie! J‚Äôai re√ßu trois volumes √©crits par Vassula Ryden.

M.K. religieuse)\n\nVassula‚Äôs messages I find challenging and I have made a decision to listen very carefully and weigh all that she says, for it would be terrible to live at a time when the Lord spoke and not to have heard him. ‚Ä¶ My advice to one reading these messages is that if they are read with only a passing curiosity they will be meaningless and become like ashes. However by allowing the Holy Spirit to speak to the reader, rereading the passages several times and place oneself as the recipient of the message, the passages will become more of a passing curiosity and their purpose revealed. These messages are for laymen, through a layman given by God.\n\n(Fr. D. H., York, UK,)\n\nJ‚Äôai d√©j√† lu le premier tome de la Vraie Vie en Dieu.

Inicialmente deixei-me levar pela simplicidade e profundidade b√≠blica desta espiritualidade que eu n√£o conhecia. Pouco a pouco descobri um caminho de ora√ß√£o id√™ntico ao de Santa Terezinha do Menino Jesus, que volta o cora√ß√£o √† intimidade efetiva com o Eterno Deus. Vassula √© mais um modelo que me ajudou a ter mais carinho com a vida de ora√ß√£o e valorizar a busca de Deus, ou melhor, as formas corretas e variadas com que o ser humano pode se relacionar com Deus. Conheci a Vassula e a espiritualidade foi o incentivo √† fidelidade, √† vida de ora√ß√£o mais constante.\n\n(Pe. N. M., Brazil, 1991)\n\nJ‚Äôai le coeur rempli de joie d‚Äô√©crire √† la personne qui me redonne le go√ªt de la pri√®re et j‚Äôy consacre un peu plus de mon temps ; ma fa√ßon d‚Äôaller √† J√©sus est plus respectueuse. Je vous √©coute dire le Chapelet car nous avons des vid√©ocassettes et votre fa√ßon de le prier est une m√©ditation.\n\n(Soeur T. P., Quebec, Canada, June 1992)\n\nOn te conna√Æt comme ‚Äòune grande amie‚Äô pour avoir √©cout√©, voire m√™me savour√© le contenu de ces belles cassettes que nous pr√™tons √† d‚Äôautres. Merci pour ces messages pleins du Sacr√© Coeur et d‚ÄôEsprit Saint. Merci √† toi, pour cette fid√©lit√© √† les transmettre √† notre pauvre monde en d√©sarroi qui ne sait pas o√π se trouvent les vraies valeurs. Nous prions beaucoup pour toi afin que tu passes √† travers les difficult√©s inh√©rentes √† cette Mission re√ßue. Que le Seigneur soit avec toi, pour Sa Gloire.\n\n(Soeur G. R., s.c.c.m., Quebec, Canada, June 1992)\n\nFirst let me tell you (Vassula) that we believe totally in the Sacred Heart‚Äôs messages to you and have been praying for you since we read them. We especially felt sorry for you that few priests and religious supported you. Thus we wanted to write to you expressing our support of messages which we know are from the Sacred Heart.\n\n(Brother J-J, USA, July, 1992)\n\nJe Lui rends gr√¢ces aussi d‚Äôavoir entendu √† travers vous et vos livres Sa voix‚Ä¶ entendu en moi, avec une telle puissance ‚ÄòMoi Dieu, Je t‚Äôaime‚Äô.\n\n(P√®re R√©ginald Tardif, September 1992)\n\nVassula is one of the most balanced and transparent seers that I know. I would even be tempted to say that she is, in a most satisfying way, more normal, more balanced than most others.\n\n(Fr. Rene Laurentin, France, 1993)\n\nIn March 1993 during my yearly retreats, as I was reading messages of Jesus, something wonderful happened to my spirit as I was filled with supernatural phenomenon penetrated my whole soul with love to my God and Saviour. I couldn‚Äôt hold back my tears, it‚Äôs something like falling in love with God, asking forgiveness and purification for passed sins. The messages of Jesus are now for me a regular part of my daily spiritual reading, reading them its like falling into spiritual coma. I have no doubt that these messages are of supernatural origin and that powerful wonderful revivement I received during my yearly retreats, Jesus be blessed and loved from all of us for His graces.\n\n(Fr. V. W. P., OSBM, Canada, May, 1993)\n\nPr√™tre depuis bient√¥t dix ans, je suis actuellement cur√©, responsable de cinq petites paroisses rurales. J‚Äôai entendu parl√© de vous, il y a quelques mois. A l‚Äô√©poque, je n‚Äôai pas attach√© d‚Äôimportance √† ce que l‚Äôon me disait jusqu‚Äôau jour o√π j‚Äôai pu lire les cahiers 62 et suivants. Je fus boulevers√© par les messages que J√©sus, notre Bien-Aim√©, nous transmet par votre interm√©diaire. Par la pens√©e, par la pri√®re, je vous suis tr√®s uni. B√©ni soit J√©sus de vous avoir mise sur notre route. Que Notre Bien-Aim√© vous b√©nisse et vous prot√®ge.\n\n(Abb√© A. B., France, October 1993)\n\nJe suis une passionn√©e des messages de J√©sus √† Vassula. Je crois m√™me pouvoir affirmer que j‚Äôai √©t√© convertie par ces messages. Je poss√®de, j‚Äôai lu et m√©dit√© les quatre volumes de la Vraie Vie en Dieu et les quatre suppl√©ments parus √† ce jour, ainsi que le petit livre Pri√®res de J√©sus et Vassula extraites de ces ouvrages. En outre, je recopie les cassettes que l‚Äôon me pr√™te pour les faire √©couter autour de moi et, quand cela m‚Äôest possible, je vais avec quelques soeurs voir des vid√©o-cassettes chez des voisins. Moi qui vivais tr√®s superficiellement, moi plus que peu fid√®le √† ma vocation, j‚Äôai vu se lever une grande lumi√®re et QUELQU‚ÄôUN m‚Äôa tendu la main. Je revis et ma joie est profonde, indescriptible. Mes sup√©rieures et mes consoeurs s‚Äô√©tonnent : elles ne me reconnaissent plus. Comme je voudrais que Vassula le sache pour l‚Äôencourager √† continuer vaillamment l‚Äôoeuvre que J√©sus fait avec elle, par elle et en elle ! Je crois que des milliers et des milliers de personnes retrouvent et retrouveront encore le Seigneur √† cause de l‚ÄôAmour qu‚ÄôIl a pour elle (et pour nous : c‚Äôest ce qu‚Äôelle nous montre) et √† cause de sa merveilleuse r√©ponse au Seigneur, qui est un exemple et une force. Par deux fois, en regardant et √©coutant une vid√©o-cassette, j‚Äôai vu le visage de J√©sus et de Marie √† la place de celui de Vassula. J‚Äô√©tais boulevers√©e.\n\n(Soeur M-C. P., Switzerland, January1994)\n\nSceptiques, malgr√© tout, comme eux, nous sommes all√©s vous (Vassula) entendre √† Laval. Sceptiques, mais le coeur ouvert. Et J√©sus nous a combl√©s. Vous n‚Äôy √™tes pour rien, vous le savez, mais d√®s le d√©but de la conf√©rence, j‚Äô√©tais saisie par votre visage et ne comprenais pas. J‚Äôavais, devant moi, une femme √©lanc√©e mais don le visage √©tait √©trangement masculin et le temps passant, je remarquais que ce visage masculin, que je connais mais ne pouvais identifier vraiment, s‚Äôaffirmait surtout quand vous parliez au nom de JESUS. C‚Äôest alors que mon ami, pr√™tre non romain, me poussa du coude : ‚ÄôMais, ne voyez-vous pas le visage de J√©sus?‚Äô Exactement ‚Äôla Sainte Face de J√©sus‚Äô. Je sortais alors cette Sainte Face de mon document, c‚Äô√©tait cela ! et, jusqu‚Äô√† la fin de la conf√©rence nous avons vu et entendu J√©sus. A la fin, le P√®re O‚ÄôCarroll a fait allusion √† ce ph√©nom√®ne d√©j√† arriv√© ailleurs, c‚Äô√©tait pour nous une confirmation. Nous √©coutions autour de nous ce qui se disait, mais, apparemment, seul notre petit groupe a re√ßu cette gr√¢ce, deux pr√™tres, un jeune couple et moi-m√™me.\n\n(Sr. J. L., France, June 1994)\n\nSince I met you (Vassula) I have experienced a genuine closeness to Jesus and you every day.\n\n(Fr. J. B., USA, November, 1994)\n\nVassula is for me a good friend, who tells me about the Love of God for all mankind. The messages are a hidden manna Jesus has reserved for our times of wilderness and iniquity. It is a powerful manna! And I am always hungry to re-read it. I pray that many, many others open their hearts to these beautiful Words from God.\n\n(Sr. J, Holland, 1996)\n\nThe messages contained in True Life in God are unique, extraordinary and very special. They reveal to us the most exalted treasures in the Sacred Heart of Jesus hidden in the past and reserved in a special way for our time. They are the most important private revelations ever made.\n\n(Fr. Robert Hughes, SM, San Jose, California, USA, January 1996)\n\nI must say that I believe in Vassula Ryden as an authentic Visionary. I have had no physical healings but am sure that through her beautiful Messages from Jesus, both merciful ad pertinent, that my love for Jesus and the Eternal Father has been enhanced and has become a stronger and more vital part of me.\n\n(Sr. M. R. N, USA, January, 1996)\n\nI had personal love for Jesus but after reading Vassula;s books (messages of God) I come to know Jesus better and my love for Jesus grew deeper ‚Äì These messages went to deep into my heart ‚Äì Two or three, in fact 4 people told me their life also has changed.\n\n(Sr. St. J., India, February, 1996)\n\nAbout five minutes after the beginning of the tape and during Vassula‚Äôs talk on the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I saw blood form in the hair at the top of the right side of her head, soaking the hair. The blood ran down from the top of her head to her ear, down her cheek, right down to under her chin, soaking both under the chin and neck. I could see this quite plainly. Then as I saw Vassula begin to gesticulate with her hands, she turned the palms of her hands towards me and I saw both palms covered with blood which ran down all of her fingers to her finger tips. I saw this every time she turned her palms towards me. ‚Ä¶ The video lasted an hour. The vision lasted right until the very end of the tape until she had finished speaking ‚Äì about 55 minutes. I was amazed at what I was seeing and lost in awe and wonderment ‚Äì but very much at peace. I don‚Äôt know why I was chosen to witness The Passion revealed to me through this chosen instrument Vassula, whom I reverence and respect; even after 24 hours I am still lost in awe and wonderment. I feel, through this vision, Christ is revealing to me the sufferings Vassula is going through at the present time.\n\n(Brother M. A., Ireland, November 1996)\n\nShe (Vassula) was totally in touch with her audience in focusing on the first essential steps: establishing a warm basic intimacy with God ‚Äì Father, Son & Holy Spirit. It was sensitive, concrete, warm and emminently practical. ‚Ä¶ The great sign of the success of her talk was the fact that, except for a few cripples and very elderly, all stayed for the blessing. That was a great sign that should not go unnoticed. Not only that ‚Äì the owner of the theatre, the management, the technicians, the service people ‚Äì ALL came and listened to the talk and lined up for the blessing. I wish you could have heard their remarks!\n\n(Fr B., USA, December, 1996)\n\nQue le Seigneur soit votre Tout. Merci pour votre fid√©lit√©, votre exemple. J‚Äôai eu la joie de participer √† la r√©union de Lausanne le 18 d√©cembre 1997. Quelle surprise, en montant sur le podium pour la b√©n√©diction, de sentir un tr√®s fort parfum d‚Äôencens. Que le Saint Esprit vous couvre de son ombre et vous donne la gr√¢ce de vous conduire au P√®re.\n\n(Soeur V. B, Switzerland, 1997)\n\nWhat happened is not for me; it is to testify that what Vassula is saying is true. What I have just experienced, proves it to me. I have never had experiences like this, this is the first time. In fact, I never pray out loud and today before the Healing Service I said a prayer out loud. I felt that I had to say it. There was a power in me, which made me pray out loud to thank Vassula for being here. I have prayed to be able to see Jesus and my prayer was answered, I saw Him in Vassula. As she was blessing me I kissed her hand because I saw Jesus in her. She repeated several times: ‚Äùit‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs true.‚Äù\n\n(Nun, Holy Land, 1997)\n\nI started to read True Life in God, published by Obor at the end of 1995. When I read the book, I felt Jesus spoke to me directly. I became enthusiastic and read it till finished in a very short time. And I felt that my faith strengthened. So when Vassula was planning to come to Jakarta giving her testimony, I tried to get the ticket for myself and for some others straight-away. When I heard her words, I felt like reading True Life in God once again. And when I saw her appearance, my impression was: that lady is simple, honest and humble. Her simplicity can be seen from the way she dressed. Her honesty can be observed from her testimony that she was a nothing before Jesus came to her. Her humility can be observed from her style of conversation that she never boasts about her ability. Because of all this, I was very certain about the words that Vassula has been telling us cannot be from the evil spirit.\n\n(Fr. I., Indonesia, March 1997)\n\nI am indissolubly tied to believing in Vassula. I am tied to the evidence that she cannot be the author of all those wonderful messages, for I believe that there really is Jesus, God and Mary in she who writes, making themselves known and heard. This continuous dialogue occurring in her is real. I am sure of this. I have the evidence because I have been reading and meditating Vassula‚Äôs books for years.\n\n(Father Guido Sommavilla SJ, Milan, April 1997)\n\nToute notre communaut√© religieuse vous reste profond√©ment reconnaissante de votre passage √† notre maison de Marseille et de ce que vous nous avez transmis. Bien souvent, nous nous unissons √† votre pri√®re et nous prions pour votre mission dans l‚ÄôEglise.\n\n(Soeurs de Notre Dame des Neiges, France, October 1997)\n\nCe que Vassula dit sur la pri√®re continuelle demand√©e par J√©sus est merveilleux et nous montre qu‚Äôelle est √† un niveau mystique tr√®s √©lev√©. Vassula nous pousse √† l‚Äôintimit√© avec Dieu et √† la r√©unification de tous les chr√©tiens dans l‚Äôunit√© d‚Äôune seule Eglise, sous l‚Äôautorit√© du Pape de Rome. Il faut rester fid√®les √† l‚ÄôEglise, charg√©e par le Christ de diriger les fid√®les, mais aussi fid√®les √† la Volont√© de Dieu qui, pour nous, s‚Äôexprime √† l‚Äô√©vidence par l‚Äôinterm√©diaire du proph√®te qu‚ÄôIl nous envoie maintenant et qui s‚Äôappelle Vassula.\n\n(P√®re J. R., France, February 1998)\n\nI have also been asked to say why I support the messages of True Life in God. If somebody had told me about Vassula before I myself had heard her or had read the messages, I would probably have been uninterested, supposing it was another silly sect. I would not have said it was impossible with prophesies, revelations or messages like these, but I never had met anything like it. But since I for the first time heard Vassula in Rome in march 1995 I have been convinced that it is all true.\n\n(Reverend Sverker Tr√¥net, Sweden, May 1998)\n\nPr√©sent √† la r√©union de pri√®re de Vassula tenue √† Lyon le 17 octobre 1998, j‚Äôeus √† la fin de la conf√©rence la gr√¢ce particuli√®re d‚Äô√™tre appel√© par elle pour la seconder dans sa longue pri√®re sur les personnes pr√©sentes √† la conf√©rence qui se pr√©sent√®rent en foule pour la lui demander. J‚Äô√©tais √† ses c√¥t√©s pour b√©nir pendant qu‚Äôelle priait intens√©ment, gravement et en silence sur chaque personne. Or √† deux reprises me tournant vers Vassula, je devais constater la modification totale de son visage dont les traits s‚Äô√©taient non seulement masculinis√©s mais tels qu‚Äôils apparaissaient √† ce moment pr√©cis pr√©sentaient une ressemblance frappante avec ceux du visage du Christ restitu√© par l‚Äô√©laboration de la NASA √† partir du Saint Suaire. Le ‚Äùph√©nom√®ne‚Äù dura quelques secondes √† chaque fois. D√®s qu‚Äôil cessait, les traits du visage redevenaient ceux de Vassula. Tr√®s proche de Vassula, puisque √† ses c√¥t√©s pour devoir prier avec elle sur les personnes pr√©sentes, je n‚Äôai pas pu √™tre tromp√© par une quelconque illusion d‚Äôoptique ou erreur de vision. D‚Äôautre part, je n‚Äôai recherch√© d‚Äôaucune mani√®re √† ‚Äùvoir‚Äù ni m√™me imagin√© qu‚Äôun tel fait pouvait survenir √† ce moment pr√©cis et en ma pr√©sence. J‚Äôatteste donc en conscience avoir √©t√© t√©moin direct et oculaire de cette transformation du visage de Vassula qui m‚Äôest apparu √† deux reprises avec les traits propres de celui de J√©sus, un visage de lumi√®re, au regard br√ªlant d‚Äôamour, empreint de douleur et de grande fatigue, comme s‚Äôil √©tait en sueur.\n\n(P√®re R.-M. M., Toulon, France, November 1998)\n\nSoy una Carmelita Descalza espa√±ola y estos escritos me han ayudado mucho. El primer fruto fue hacerme experimentar el Se√±or cu√°nto me ama, con una alegr√≠a tan profunda, que las cosas no me afectan m√°s que exteriormente. Tambi√©n en mi vida de oraci√≥n me han ayudado: desde entonces me he sentido estimulada a hacer m√°s ratos de oraci√≥n que los que marcan nuestras Reglas. Desde que conoc√≠ estos mensajes, todo me parece poco para el Se√±or. Y todo esto con una gran alegr√≠a y paz interiores, que me ayudan mucho a mejorar la convivencia con las Hermanas. Ahora me sucede que cuando pasa la oraci√≥n personal y tomo el m√©todo dado por Vassula para las reuniones, se me pasa el tiempo sin distracciones, lo que no es as√≠ cuando no sigo este esquema. Para m√≠ los otros cristianos eran ‚Äùhermanos separados‚Äù por los que hab√≠a que rezar, aunque sin mucha esperanza. Ahora son hermanos muy queridos. La divisi√≥n del Cuerpo de Cristo me duele mucho m√°s profundamente.\n\n(H. M. D. del C. de Jes√∫s, Carmelitas Descalzas, Spain 1999)\n\nJe porte tout dans la pri√®re quotidienne et l‚ÄôEucharistie ‚Äì je suis un pr√™tre en retraite -. Toute ma reconnaissance pour cette oeuvre (la Vraie Vie en Dieu) tellement importante qui √©mane du Coeur de J√©sus. Malgr√© toutes les oppositions ‚Äùles fid√®les resteront fid√®les‚Äù et se multiplieront. Je prie avec vous tous. Lou√© soit J√©sus-Christ !\n\n(P√®re R. D., France, February 1999)\n\nJe suis une carm√©lite d√©chauss√©e espagnole et ces √©crits [la Vraie Vie en Dieu} m‚Äôont beaucoup aid√©e dans ma vie de pri√®re. Depuis que je connais ces messages, tout me para√Æt peu pour le Seigneur. J‚Äô√©prouve une grande joie et une grande paix int√©rieures qui m‚Äôaident beaucoup √† am√©liorer ma vie en communaut√©. Un autre th√®me sur lequel j‚Äôai √©t√© √©clair√©e en lisant ces messages est l‚Äô≈ìcum√©nisme: la division du Corps du Christ me blesse beaucoup plus profond√©ment; j‚Äôai compris que par l‚Äôhumilit√©, en reconnaissant nos propres fautes et en demandant pardon, et par l‚Äôamour, signe distinctif des chr√©tiens, nous obtiendrons l‚Äôunit√© de Son √âglise.\n\n(Sr D., cd, Spain, August 1999)\n\nMy daily conversion is being assisted by Jesus‚Äô messages given us through Vassula. These messages are not the only means Jesus is using but they do play a major role in guiding my life toward Him. I am especially helped by living my day with Jesus and Mary using ‚ÄôWe, Us‚Äô to remember that I am always in the presence of the Holy.\n\n(H. S. B., OSB, Mexico, September 1999)\n\nAbout this time I heard of Vassula and became slightly acquainted with ‚ÄùThe Messages‚Äù. Easter ‚Äô96 I wet to hear her speak in Limerick and realised that ‚Äùthe Pearl of great price‚Äù was within reach. Thereafter things happened very rapidly. In October‚Äô96 Vassula came to speak at ‚ÄùThe Point‚Äù in Dublin. At that time we had the privilege of having her stay for a few days here in our Convent in Rathmines. The impact she made on me was tremendous. I felt awed by the fact that we were in the presence of a very special favourite of the Lord‚Äôs. Through the good offices of Frank Reynolds on November 24, ‚Äô96 we had a prayer meeting in Rathmines at which Sula and a companion from Rhodos were present. The events of that day changed my life. True Life in God became the focus of all my energies. The sins and failings of my earlier life had always been a burden of guilt that kept me looking back at me instead of into the loving face of my beloved Abba.\n\n(Sr. N. D., Dublin, Ireland, September 1999)\n\nI was introduced to True Life in God in November of 1997. I can only BEGIN to speak of the difference it has made in my life. How I pray, who I pray to, what I pray for, what brings me joy, what grieves my heart, what gives me life, how I spend my time, what I talk about, how I relate with others, all this has changed since TLIG. I am a cradle Catholic and a Benedictine Sister. Brought up in a faith filled family, I was privileged to have a relationship with God from a tender age. Still, it seems by comparison, that I never knew the Triune God before. I have fallen in love with the Thrice Holy and this has changed my life. I have a greater love and deeper appreciation for Scriptures, the Sacraments (especially the Eucharist and Confession), my faith, Mary, the church and my vocation.\n\n(Sr. J. H., OSB, USA, September 1999)\n\nI am a cradle Catholic and a Benedictine Sister. I was privileged to have a relationship with God from a tender age. Still, it seems by comparison, that I never knew the Triune God before. I have fallen in love with The Trice-Holy, and this has changed my life. I have a greater love and deeper appreciation for Scriptures, the Sacraments (especially the Eucharist and confession). My faith, Mary, the church and my vocation. I have always experienced the mercy and compassion of God in ways I never experienced them before-in me, effecting my own healing; and through me, into the lives of others. My knowledge and understanding of life and faith has deepened. I pray for Vassula, grateful for allowing herself to be used in such an incredible way.\n\n(Sr. S.J.H., USA, September 1999)\n\nIn my mind and heart there was no question that Jesus was speaking to me through Vassula. Then I became as a sponge reading everything the Lord put before me. I experienced tremendous sorrow for my sins and cried for weeks. I sometimes still experience that. I had such a longing for God and a fear of sin that I actually wanted to die then to be with God. . . . . I can‚Äôt even begin to tell you the kindness and goodness of Our Lord and Our Lady to me! I would be forever writing. Suffice it to say They continue to lead me. Worldly things mean nothing to me anymore.\n\n(Sr. M. A. of Jesus (novice), Fort Wayne, USA, September, 1999)\n\nI have been a Carmelite contemplative nun for over 28 years. It is important, I feel, for me to say at the outset of this that from when I was 18 years I have tried to give myself totally to God ‚Äì never to refuse Him anything. However, as a result of becoming acquainted with Vassula I have experienced a radical conversion. As I began to read Jesus words to Vassula (and particularly after she prayed over me) I became aware to my amazement that my heart was quite hardened to God. Without my knowing it, a spirit of the world and rationalism under the guise of an ‚Äùincarnational spirituality‚Äù had crept into my soul. Reading, allowing the words of Jesus through Vassula sink into my heart has helped me ‚Ä¶ to ‚Äùconvert‚Äù my ‚Äùwhole‚Äù being ‚Äì especially my heart with all the hitherto dormant fires of its God given passion over to True Life in God.\n\n(Sr. T. A. McC., Santa Clara, USA, September 1999)\n\nI believe that the messages of TLG are almost self-validating, for I cannot imagine how they could have been written except under the control of the Spirit. The aspects of the messages which strike me most are the sense of intimacy with Jesus and the Father which they convey, the help they supply in learning to trust them, and the sense of how God works step by step in the souls of Vassula, myself, and others. I have a doctorate in physics, have spent a great deal of time studying theology, and have had a fair amount of experience in giving spritual direction. I would like to confirm Fr. Edward O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs opinion expressed in his response to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Although isolated snippets from TLG could be understood in a negative way, the general context of the work makes it clear that TLG is not only free of error but is a profound, brilliant, and loving exposition of the gospel.\n\n(Fr. R. J. P., S.J., USA, September 1999)\n\nAbout a year ago I started to read TLIG thanks to a member of my community. My life in general had been very dry for years. This included attitudinal problems with the Vatican and Church leadership in general and a weak stance on abortion. Changes began immediately within me after reading TLIG. First I began praying the rosary everyday and the more I read, the more conscious I became of God, our Blessed Mother and the angels in my daily life. The messages also clarified for me what the call to pray, pray, pray meant and have been given the grace during conscious moments day and night to invoke God more than I ever had in the past.\n\n(S. R. V., OSB, USA, September 1999)\n\nIt is now nearly three years I am in touch with the TLIG news which has brought about a remarkable change in my attitude towards my relationship with Jesus and Mary. It is an attitude of utter simplicity after knowing the mind of Jesus and His expectations of us humans, especially from those who have dedicated themselves by religious vows to strive after perfect love, which I picked up from the conversations between Jesus and Vassula. I have implicit faith in the authenticity of the messages that come to us through Vassula Ryden. The spiritual enlightenment that I have received is that spiritual the journey towards religious perfection isn‚Äôt as complicated as I formerly thought, but it is so very simple. Praying constantly means being aware of the living presence of Jesus at our side when we are busy at our work and not necessarily to be on our knees in our Chapel as I formerly understood. The T.L.I.G. books taught me that Jesus is so easily pleased and He is simply longing for our constant love and thought of Him. This has been a gradual process but is a new light with conviction.\n\n(Sr. A., India, October 1999)\n\nSou sacerdote, procurei sempre viver meu sacerd√≥cio com dignidade, amor e obedi√™ncia a Igreja. N√£o andei a procura de revela√ß√µes, vis√µes. Por fruto do acaso me deparei com os livros de ‚ÄôA Verdadeira Vida em Deus‚Äô, fui tentado a l√™-los, foi a melhor experi√™ncia que tive em toda a minha vida como sacerdote. Sempre que vou celebrar a Eucaristia, antes, por alguns minutos, leio alguma mensagem de Jesus contida naqueles livros. Percebo claramente a for√ßa interior e a intimidade de Jesus em toda a celebra√ß√£o, de uma maneira muito especial no poder da palavra, pois minhas prega√ß√µes se tornam mais convincentes, mais cheias de f√©, tocando mais os cora√ß√µes dos ouvintes. A ‚ÄôA Verdadeira Vida em Deus‚Äô tem sido vida em meu sacerd√≥cio.\n\n(Pe. J. C., Brazil, October 1999)\n\nToday I am enrolled in the Permanent Diaconate program within the Archdiocese of Boston, seeking to further serve The Lord, to work in His vineyard at a greater depth than ever before in my life. In many ways this is the direct result of Vassula‚Äôs visit to Boston when as part of my work on her visit I came to know the Director of Spirituality for the Archdiocese and drew closer to the PD program. TLIG has opened the door, shown me the way to becoming more deeply enveloped within His Sacred Heart. While many influences in my life have helped me to arrive here, primarily my wife with her love, it was TLIG that was the catalyst which helped move me to take these recent steps in my continuing journey to better serve the Lord.\n\n(F. C., USA, October 1999)\n\nVassula prend le relais de saint Jean, de sainte Gertrude, de sainte Marguerite-Marie et elle devient un livre o√π J√©sus √©crit son hymne d‚Äôamour. La Vraie Vie en Dieu m‚Äôapprend le regard que J√©sus jette sur notre monde refroidi dont ¬´les ossements sont dess√©ch√©s¬ª. Elle m‚Äô√©claire sur son dessein de le ressusciter en lui pr√©sentant son C≈ìur, ab√Æme d‚Äôamour et de mis√©ricorde. Elle est aussi une lumi√®re sur la vie mystique, la vie d‚Äôunion √† Dieu. J‚Äôai sentique Dieu nous attire dans les profondeurs de la vie int√©rieure. Cette ≈ìuvre intensifie ma relation avec le Saint-Esprit. Elle annonce le ¬´bapt√™me de feu¬ª que vit l‚Äô√âglise et qu‚Äôelle vivra de plus en plus. L‚ÄôEsprit Cr√©ateur est √† l‚Äô≈ìuvre avec Marie pour pr√©parer des colonnes dans cette √âglise chancelante √† nos yeux.

Ethier, s.a.a., Canada, October 1999)\n\nLe cercle des gens est attir√©s vers le bien est de plus en plus grand, gr√¢ce aux livres de Vassula‚Ä¶ Ce qui est vraiment grand et a une grande valeur doit traverser des √©preuves douloureuses et parfois rencontrer d‚Äôimmenses difficult√©s. Ayons confiance que J√©sus vaincra cette fois-ci √©galement. Je remercie toujours Dieu le P√®re qu‚Äôil y ait des gens simples ouvrant leurs coeurs aux exigences de J√©sus‚Ä¶\n\n(Sr. I, Poland, October 1999)\n\nLes √©crits ‚ÄûLa Vraie Vie en Vie‚Äù m‚Äôont attir√©, mais pendant un certain temps j‚Äôai abandonn√© cette lecture. Alors Dieu a voulu que je me trouve dans un √©tat de crise spirituelle. J‚Äôai re√ßu une lumi√®re int√©rieure : retourner aux √©crits de Vassula. D‚Äôun coup, les paroles de J√©sus ‚Äì qu‚Äôelle note ‚Äì sont devenues pour moi une source de lumi√®re et d‚Äôesp√©rance. Tout d‚Äôabord, je ne les lisais pas syst√©matiquement, pour enfin revenir et commencer par le d√©but. Quel changement! Les difficult√©s ont disparu et les paroles de J√©sus m‚Äôont √©merveill√©‚Ä¶ J‚Äôy retrouve maintenant une nourriture dont j‚Äôavais tant besoin et aussi un renforcement. Gr√¢ce √† ‚ÄûLa Vraie Vie en Vie‚Äù un bien se fait √† l‚Äôint√©rieur de mon √¢me, un bien dont j‚Äôavais dout√©.\n\n(Fr. P.J., Poland, October 1999)\n\nTous ceux qui lisent ces livres ‚Äì les plus beaux livres -, commencent une nouvelle vie, re√ßoivent le don de la joie int√©rieure et la connaissance du Dieu de Bont√© et de Mis√©ricorde. C‚Äôest vraiment pour notre temps contemporain ‚Äì le temps de la froideur au niveau de la foi ‚Äì le Feu de l‚ÄôAmour Divin qui fait revivre les coeurs humains si froids. Je remercie la Mis√©ricorde Divine pour l‚Äôaide salvatrice qu‚ÄôElle nous donne pour approfondir notre foi en la Mis√©ricorde de Dieu, en l‚ÄôAmour de Dieu envers l‚Äôhomme‚Ä¶ Pendant la lecture de ce livre, l‚Äô√¢me se repose‚Ä¶ Si on lit tous les volumes, puis le livret de pri√®res, la lumi√®re de Dieu resplendit et √©claire l‚Äôhomme. Alors, dans le coeur, s‚Äôallume l‚Äôamour et la reconnaissance √† Dieu Trois Fois Saint pour Sa Mis√©ricorde pour nous, Ses enfants ‚Äì p√©cheurs.\n\n(Sr. M. K., Poland, October 1999)\n\nNous sommes tellement heureux que les livres de Vassula se trouvent dans notre communaut√© ! Ils nous aident √† vivre plus profond√©ment la Bont√© sans mesures, l‚ÄôAmour et Mis√©ricorde que Notre Seigneur J√©sus Christ a pour chaque √¢me‚Ä¶ Ils nous aident √† conna√Ætre plus profond√©ment l‚ÄôAmour sans limites que J√©sus ressent pour nous les hommes, Sa douleur et Sa pr√©occupation pour que ‚Äùtous soient un‚Äù. J‚Äôai compris combien Il d√©sire notre amour r√©ciproque et notre union avec Lui par les sacrifices, la p√©nitence, la souffrance pour sauver les √¢mes et le monde‚Ä¶\n\n(Sr. M., Poland, October 1999)\n\nLes √©crits ‚Äùa Vraie Vie en Vie‚Äù constituent comme une ‚Äùsomme mystique‚Äù. Les √©l√©ments caract√©ristiques : simplicit√© √©vang√©lique, accessibilit√© et lisibilit√© pour les √¢mes ‚Äùsimples‚Äù. Ces paroles peuvent sembler une exag√©ration, mais pour moi c‚Äôest la vraie "
