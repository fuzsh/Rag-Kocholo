        "text": "This will be a first for the holiday resort and the province. The Bundesliga outfit is expected to be in South Africa from 18 July to feature in the inaugural Mpumalanga Premier’s International Cup. Hosted by TS Galaxy, the event will also include Mbabane Swallows from neighbouring Eswatini as well Yanga FC from Tanzania. Sukazi says he is looking forward to the tournament.\n\nREAD:Real Sociedad start pre-season with no new signings\n\n''They will land on the 18th and on the 19th we will host a reception for them and on the 20th that is the match day. On the 21st, they will be launching their 2024/25 season kit at Kruger National Park, who would have thought that a professional football club, not even us - we have never launched our kit at Kruger, you can imagine the kind of exposure it will give to Kruger and the province,'' said Sukazi.\n\nSukazi says preparations are well underway for the tournament, which has taken a lot of work to put together. The first delegation from Germany is expected on 17 July and will be welcomed by Mandla Ndlovu, the Premier of Mpumalanga.\n\n''The preparations for the tournament are coming up very well to be honest, FC Augsburg first delegation will land here on the 17, that will be 11 people and the entire team will land on the 18th to welcoming party and they will meet the Premier and the MEC for sports,'' added Sukazi.\n\nWith the confirmation of Yanga FC and Mbabane Swallows coming on board, the TS Galaxy supremo says he is delighted it speaks to the vision of the Mpumalanga Premier’s International Cup.\n\n''We have always conceptualised the event as an international tournament. It took us a bit of time because it was not easy to add in different clubs, but eventually we now have Yanga FC who are the Tanzanian champions and Mbabane Swallow who are also preparing for their CAF campaign - these are incredible clubs and they fit the criteria,'' concluded Sukazi.\n\nSukazi adds that this will be perfect exposure for all involved in the tournament as the games will not only be on SABC Sport but abroad as well.\n\nThe matches will be broadcast live on SABC Sport, but Sukazi has also called on the fans to come in numbers to support the games as it is not always that a Bundesliga team comes to play on these shores.\n\nThe first instalment of the tournament will see FC Augsburg take on Yanga FC at 3pm, while TS Galaxy will face Mbabane Swallows at 8pm on Saturday 20 July. The following weekend (Saturday, 27 July) TS Galaxy will host FC Augsburg at 3pm. All the matches will be played at the Mbombela Stadium and will be broadcast live on SABC 1, S3, SABC Sport and SABC radio stations."
