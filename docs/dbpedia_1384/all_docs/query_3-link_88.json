        "text": "–Wenzel begins duties immediately after 10-year stint at Georgia Tech-\n\nATLANTA (March 2, 2016) — The WNBA’s Atlanta Dream has named Theresa Wenzel as Team President, effective immediately, it was announced on Wednesday.\n\n“Theresa brings great experience and energy to the Dream, which is a great complement to the current momentum of the franchise,” Atlanta Dream co-owners Mary Brock and Kelly Loeffler said. “We are excited about the 2016 season tipping off in May and sharing the Dream’s exciting brand of basketball with our dedicated fans.”\n\nWenzel, a 21-year sports-industry veteran, spent the previous 10 years as a top athletic administrator at Georgia Tech, joining the Yellow Jackets in 2005 before being elevated to the position of Senior Women’s Administrator in 2006. She was honored as the 2011 Administrator of the Year by the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA).\n\n“Theresa has been a tireless advocate for women’s sports, and particularly women’s basketball, for her entire career – as a player, as a coach and as an administrator,” WBCA Executive Director Danielle M. Donehew said. “She was honored as the 2011 WBCA’s Administrator of the Year for her support of the association and the sport, both at Georgia Tech and in the ACC. We look forward to working with her in her new role as she leads the Atlanta Dream.”\n\nDuring her tenure at Georgia Tech, which began in 2005, Wenzel oversaw the women’s basketball, golf, softball, men’s and women’s swimming, men’s and women’s tennis, men’s and women’s track and field and volleyball programs. Under her supervision, the Yellow Jackets women’s tennis team captured the 2007 NCAA National Championship.\n\n“Theresa Wenzel is a great leader and motivator,” Georgia Tech women’s basketball head coach MaChelle Joseph said. “She is a mentor that brings out the best in those around her. The Atlanta Dream has made a terrific hire. Theresa’s work ethic and commitment to inspiring and supporting those around her will be felt throughout the Dream organization.”\n\nShe was also the athletic department’s non-academic liaison to the Office of Student Affairs while at Tech and was a member of numerous committees including the Georgia Tech Women’s Resource Center Advisory Board, the Title IX Compliance Committee, the GTAA Compliance and Equity Committee, the ACC Women’s Basketball Committee, ACC Softball Committee and the ACC Women’s Tennis Committee.\n\n“I’m excited about working with the new leadership that Theresa brings to take the Atlanta Dream to the next level both on and off the court,” said Dream head coach Michael Cooper. “We have a lot of strengths to build on and this only adds to our focus on success as a team.”\n\nPrior to arriving in Atlanta, Wenzel served as the Assistant Athletic Director before being promoted to Associate AD for Business Operations at Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y. She also handled the head coaching duties for the Saints women’s golf team until her departure in 2005, guiding Siena to five consecutive Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) titles (2001-05).\n\nIn addition, she served as Siena’s intramural director and assistant facilities director for one year.\n\nWenzel began her career in college athletics at Canisius College where she held the position of assistant women’s basketball coach for three seasons (1994-97).\n\nA basketball letterwinner at Marquette University, Wenzel earned her bachelor’s degree in business administration before later earning a master’s degree in sport administration from Canisius College.\n\nThe Dream open the 2016 regular season on the road at San Antonio and Indiana (May 14/20) before returning to Philips Arena for the home opener on Sunday, May 22 vs. the Chicago Sky in a 3 p.m. ET tip.\n\nAtlanta Dream season tickets are available now by logging for more information on at Atlanta Dream Membership Central or clicking HERE to buy directly via Ticketmaster.\n\nThe three-time Eastern Conference Champion Atlanta Dream is entering its ninth season in the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA)."
