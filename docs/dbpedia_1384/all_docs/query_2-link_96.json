        "text": "FC Augsburg and Mizuno have come out of nowhere to complete what is arguably one of the kits sets of the 24/25 season, rounded off by this, their new third shirt. Dubbed the “Roman kit”, design inspiration comes from the founding of the city during the Roman Empire under Emperor Augustus and it adopts the slogan “Augusta Vindelicum” – the Roman name for the city of Augsburg.\n\nThe Bordeaux-coloured jersey features intricate embossing across the front, combining ancient Roman motifs that can still be seen in Augsburg today together with elements of the club’s badge. The logos of FCA, Mizuno and the club’s sponsors are gold, along with gold cuffs on the sleeves and on the collar. The club’s founding year 1907 is featured in Roman numerals on the neck, along with FC Augsburg lettering printed on the back.\n\nThe shirt’s reveal comes just ahead of the 8 August, which is a special date for the club: Not only does the city celebrate the Hohe Friedensfest on this day, but FC Augsburg was also founded on 8 August 1907 under the name FC Alemannia.\n\n“The Roman kit is without doubt the centrepiece of this season’s collection and really crowns a great kit line-up,” explained FCA CEO Michael Ströll. “The noble-looking combination of Bordeaux and gold gives the shirt elegance and exclusivity that is sure to shine both on and off the pitch. It symbolises the connection between FC Augsburg and the history of the city of Augsburg and will no doubt be a big hit with both players and fans.”"
