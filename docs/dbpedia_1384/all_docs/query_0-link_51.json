H e began his musical training with Klaus, the local organist, then, following theological studies at the University of Halle (1785-86), he studied with Naumann in Dresden. In 1792 he was made chamber composer to the Prussian court in Berlin, which position made it possible for him to complete his musical training in Italy (1793-95). In 1795 he returned to the Prussian court as Kapellmeister, but he also made tours as a concert artist. In spite of his bouts with alcohol, he remained a favorite at the Prussian court. His most successful score was the Singspiel Fanchon das Leiermiidchen. - Died at Berlin, June 8, 1814.\n\nin 1766 - John Wall Calcott composer is born.\n\nin 1827 - Alexei Nikolaievich Titov, Russian violinist and composer, (brother of Sergei Nikolaievich Titov and father of Nikolai Alexeievich Titov), dies at St. Petersburg age 58. He served in the cavalry, reaching the rank of major general at his retirement. He was an amateur violinist, and wrote operas in the traditional Italian style; of these, the following were produced in St. Petersburg: Andromeda and Perseus (1802); The Judgment of Solomon (1803); Nurzadakh (Iune 7, 1807); The Wedding of Filatka (April 25, 1808); Errant Moment (july 10, 1812); Emmerich Tekkely (Dec. 13, 1812); Intrigue in the Basket (May 12, 1817); Valor of the People of Kiev, or These Are the Russians (May 12, 1817); The Feast of the Mogul (Sept. 15, 1823); also The Brewer, or The Hidden Ghost of Evil (Moscow, 1788).Aballet-pantomime, LeNouveau Werther, was first given in St. Petersburg, on Jan. 30, 1799. - Born at St. Petersburg, June 24, 1769.\n\nin 1834 - Franjo Zaver Kuhac composer is born.\n\nin 1850 - Arthor Goring Thomas composer is born.\n\nin 1851 - Wenzel Sedlak composer, dies at 75.\n\nin 1867 - Vicente Ripolles composer is born.\n\nin 1867 - Ivan VasilievichErshov, celebrated Russian tenor, is born at Maly Nesvetai, near Novocherkassk. He studied voice in Moscow with Alexandrova-Kochetova and in St. Petersburg with Gabel and Palecek. In 1893 he made his operatic debut at the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg as Faust, which became one of his most popular roles; then went to Italy and took voice lessons with Rossi in Milan; appeared in Turin as Don Jose in Carmen. He returned to Russia in 1894 and joined the Kharkov Opera; in 1895 he became a member of the Maryinsky Opera Theater in St. Petersburg, and served with it until 1929. He achieved fabulous success as the greatest performer of the tenor roles in the Russian repertoire, and he also was regarded by music critics and audiences as the finest interpreter of the Wagnerian operas; he sang Siegfried, Tannhauser, Lohengrin, and Tristan with extraordinary lyric and dramatic penetration; as an opera tenor in his time, he had no rivals on the Russian stage. In 1929, at the age of 62, he sang Verdi's Otello; he also appeared in oratorio and solo recitals. From 1916 to 1941 he taught voice at the Petrograd (Leningrad) Conservatory. At the beginning of the siege of Leningrad in 1941, Ershov was evacuated with the entire personnel of the Conservatory to Tashkent in Central Asia, where he died shortly afterward. – Died at Tashkent, Nov. 21, 1943.\n\nin 1869 - Arthur Hinton, English composer, is born at Beckenham. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where he subsequently taught violin. He then went to Munich for further study with Rheinberger. He composed a Symphony which he conducted at one of the concerts of the Munich Conservatory. He traveled in Italy, returning to London in 1896, where his 2nd Symphony was performed in 1903. He married the pianist Katharine Goodson, who gave many performances of his piano works, including a concerto. He wrote the children's operettas The Disagreeable Princess and St. Elizabeth's Rose as well as a number of songs. - Died at Rottingdean, Aug. 11, 1941.\n\nin 1873 - Daniel Gregory Mason, eminent American composer and educator, grandson of Lowell Mason and nephew of William Mason, is born at Brookline, Mass. A scion of a famous family of American musicians, his father, Henry Mason, was a co-founder of the piano manufacturing firm Mason & Hamlin. He entered Harvard University, where he studied with J.K. Paine (B.A., 1895); after graduation, he continued his studies with Arthur Whiting (piano), Goetschius (theory), and Chadwick (orchestration). Still feeling the necessity for improvement of his technique as a composer, he went to Paris, where he took courses with d'Indy (1913). In 1905 he became a member of the faculty of Columbia University in N.Y.; in 1929, was appointed MacDowell Professor of Music; he was chairman of the music department until 1940, and continued to teach there until 1942, when he retired. As a teacher, Mason developed a high degree of technical ability in his students; as a composer, he represented a conservative trend in American music; while an adherent to the idea of an American national style, his conception was racially and regionally narrow, accepting only the music of Anglo-Saxon New England and the \"old South\"; he was an outspoken opponent of the \"corrupting\" and \"foreign\" influences of 20th-century Afro-American and Jewish-American music. His ideals were the German masters of the Romantic school; but there is an admixture of impressionistic colors in his orchestration; his harmonies are full and opulent, his melodic writing expressive and songful. The lack of strong individuality, however, has resulted in the virtual disappearance of his music from the active repertoire. - Died at Greenwich, Conn., Dec. 4, 1953.\n\nin 1882 - Bela Albrecht Pal Keler composer, dies at 62.\n\nin 1889 - Gustav Mahler's Symphony No 1 was premiered in Budapest with Mahler himself conducting.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI_S-ZgGsRQ\"]R. Kubelik Conducts Mahler Symphony No.1, \"Titan\" (1/6) - YouTube[/ame][/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1894 - Anton Grigorievich Rubinstein, renowned Russian pianist, conductor, composer, and pedagogue, brother of Nikolai (Grigorievich) Rubinstein, dies at Peterhof, near St. Petersburg.\n\nHe was of a family of Jewish merchants who became baptized in Berdichev in July 1831. His mother gave him his first lessons in piano; the family moved to Moscow, where his father opened a small pencil factory. A well-known Moscow piano teacher, Alexandre Villoing, was entrusted with Rubinstein's musical education, and was in fact his only piano teacher. In 1839 Villoing took him to Paris, where Rubinstein played before Chopin and Liszt. He remained there until 1841, then made a concert tour in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, England, Norway, and Sweden, returning to Russia in 1843. Since Anton's brother Nikolai evinced a talent for composition, the brothers were taken in 1844 to Berlin, where, on Meyerbeer's recommendation, Anton studied composition with Dehn.\n\nHe subsequently made a tour through Hungary with the flutist Heindl. He returned to Russia in 1848 and settled in St. Petersburg. There he enjoyed the enlightened patronage of the Grand Duchess Helen, and wrote 3 Russian operas: Dmitri Donskoy (1852), The Siberian Hunters (1853), and Thomas the Fool (1853).\n\nIn 1854, with the assistance of the Grand Duchess, Rubinstein undertook another tour in western Europe. He found publishers in Berlin, and gave concerts of his own works in London and Paris, exciting admiration as both composer and pianist; on his return in 1858, he was appointed court pianist and conductor of the court concerts. He assumed the direction of the Russian Musical Society in 1859, and in 1862 founded the Imperial Conservatory in St. Petersburg, remaining its director until 1867.\n\nFor 20 years thereafter he held no official position; from 1867 until 1870 he gave concerts in Europe, winning fame as a pianist second only to Liszt. During the season of 1872-73, he made a triumphant American tour, playing in 215 concerts, for which he was paid lavishly; appeared as a soloist and jointly with the violinist Wieniawski. He produced a sensation by playing without the score, a novel procedure at the time.\n\nReturning to Europe, he elaborated a cycle of historical concerts, in programs ranging from Bach to Chopin; he usually devoted the last concert of a cycle to Russian composers. In 1887 he resumed the directorship of the St. Petersburg Conservatory, resigning again in 1891, when he went to Dresden. He returned to Russia the year of his death.\n\nIn 1890 he established the Rubinstein Prize, an international competition open to young men between 20 and 26 years of age. Two prizes of 5,000 francs each were offered, 1 for composition, the other for piano. Quinquennial competitions were held in St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, and Paris. Rubinstein's role in Russian musical culture was of the greatest importance. He introduced European methods into education, and established high standards of artistic performance.\n\nHe was the first Russian musician who was equally prominent as composer and interpreter. According to contemporary reports, his playing possessed extraordinary power (his octave passages were famous) and insight, revealed particularly in his performance of Beethoven's sonatas. His renown as a composer was scarcely less. His Ocean Symphony was one of the most frequently performed orchestral works in Europe and America; his piano concertos were part of the standard repertoire; his pieces for Piano Solo, Melody in F, Romance, and Kamennoi Ostrow, became perennial favorites. After his death, his orchestral works all but vanished from concert programs, as did his operas, with the exception of The Demon, which is still performed in Russia. His Piano Concerto No. 4, in D minor, is occasionally heard.\n\nMany of Rubinstein's contemporaries felt he bore a striking resemblance to Ludwig van Beethoven. Ignaz Moscheles, who had known Beethoven intimately, wrote, \"Rubinstein's features and short, irrepressible hair remind me of Beethoven.\" Liszt referred to Rubinstein as \"Van II.\" Rubinstein was even rumored to be the illegitimate son of Beethoven. Rubinstein neither confirmed nor denied this rumor. Neither did he remind anyone that he was born more than two years after Beethoven had died. - Born at Vykhvatinetz, Podolia, Nov. 28, 1829.\n\nin 1896 - Mykhaylo Verikivsky composer is born.\n\nin 1897 - Margaret Sutherland composer is born.\n\nin 1899 - Juan Vicente Lecuna composer is born.\n\nin 1901 - Opera \"Gris'lidis\" is produced (Paris).\n\nin 1908 - Pasquale Amato, remarkable Italian baritone makes his Metropolitan Opera debut in N.Y. as Germont, and quickly established himself as one of its principal members, remaining on its roster until 1918 and returning there from 1919 to 1921, excelling in all the major Italian roles as well as several French and German.\n\nin 1911 - Gustav Mahler's Das Lied Von Der Erde was premiered in Munich with Bruno Walter conducting.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtV7TSRLs5Y\"]Gustav Mahler: 'Das Lied von der Erde' conducted by Walter, sung by Ferrier. 6th mvmt (part 1) - YouTube[/ame][/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1917 - Max Georg Baumann composer is born.\n\nin 1917 - Pam Henningen [Cornelia CP Ingenegeren] Indonesian/Dutch dancer is born.\n\nin 1917 - Ram Gopal Indies English dancer (Blue Peter, Purple Plain) is born.\n\nin 1918 - Tibor Freso, Slovak conductor and composer, is born at Spissky. He studied composition with A. Moyzes and conducting with J. Vincourek at the Bratislava Conservatory, graduating in 1938; then studied with Pizzetti at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome (1939-42). Returning to Czechoslovakia, he served as conductor of the Slovak National Theater in Bratislava (1942-49) and the Kosice Opera (1949-52). In 1953 he was appointed chief opera conductor of the Slovak National Opera. - Died at Bratislava, July 7, 1987.\n\nin 1919 - John McCarthy composer is born.\n\nin 1920 - Armin Schibler composer is born.\n\nin 1925 - June [Shirley L] Christy US, jazz singer (Tampico) is born.\n\nin 1927 – (Karl) Wilhelm (Eugen) Stenhammar, (eminent Swedish pianist, conductor, and composer, son of Per Ulrik Stenhammar, dies at Stockholm. He began to play the piano and to compose in childhood. After attending Richard Andersson's music school, he studied theory with Joseph Dente and organ with Heintze and Lagergren (1888-89); passed the organists' examination privately (1890), and later pursued theory lessons with Emil Sjorgren and Andreas Hallen; completed his piano training with Heinrich Barth in Berlin (1892-93). He subsequently toured as a pianist, appearing as a soloist and frequently with the Aulin Quartet. His first large work for Solo Voices, Chorus, and Orchestra, I rosengdrd (In a Rose Garden; 1888-89; after K.A. Melin's collection of fairy tales, Prinsessan och svennen), was performed in Stockholm on Feb. 16, 1892, attracting considerable attention; his love for the theater prompted him to compose 2 music dramas, Gildet pa Solhaug (1892-93) and Tirfing (1897-98), neither of which was successful; he did, however, compose much outstanding incidental music. He made his conducting debut with a performance of his overture Excelsior! in 1897. After serving as artistic director of the Philharmonic Society (1897-1900), the Royal Theater (1 season), and the New Philharmonic Society (1904-6) in Stockholm, he went to Goteborg as artistic director of the Orchestra Society; during his tenure (1906-22), he elevated the musical life of the city; then returned to Stockholm, where he again took charge of the Royal Theater (1924-25) before ill health compelled him to retire. Stenhammar's early compositions reflect his preoccupation with the Romantic movement; the influence of Wagner and Liszt is quite perceptible, but he later developed an individual style based on his detailed study of Classical forms. His ability to absorb and transmute authentic folk melodies is a notable characteristic of many of his works. Among his most outstanding scores are the second Symphony, the second Piano Concerto, the Serenade for Orchestra, several of his string quartets, his choral pieces, and a number of his songs. - Born at Stockholm, Feb. 7, 1871.\n\nin 1932 - John Barnes Chance composer is born.\n\nin 1937 - Ruth Laredo (n'e Meckler) Detroit, Mich, concert pianist is born.\n\nin 1937 - René Kollo (German tenor) is born.\n\nin 1939 - Marie Joseph Leon Desire Paque composer, dies at 72.\n\nin 1939 - Richard Remick \"....\" Smothers (US comic, singer, composer; The Smother Brothers) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmhW9gVUWVA&feature=related\"]Smothers Brothers- Michael Row Your Boat Ashore - YouTube[/ame][/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1941 - Gary Michael Kan, outstanding American double bass player, is born at Los Angeles.

Indeed, the only time his music was heard at the Proms was in 1958, when Sir John Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra performed his first symphony.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Although he studied at the Royal Manchester College of Music with Richard Hall – whose students included Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle – only once did Butterworth humour his teacher with a 12-tone work: a trio for oboe, clarinet and bassoon. Instead, works such as The Path Across the Moors, describing a walk with his dog, The Quiet Tarn (Malham) and A Dales Suite indicate where his affinities lay.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]There were other influences in his 100-plus works: a post-war spell in Germany led to an organ partita based on German church music; The Owl and the Pussycat (1978) emphasised his love of animals; and Sinfonia Borealis was inspired by the northern lights. The music of Sibelius also cast a long spell over Butterworth's work. He was a prolific composer for brass bands, but was regarded with suspicion after voicing his doubts about their preoccupation with competitions in \"A Cloth Cap Joke?\", an article published in 1970.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Arthur Eckersley Butterworth was born at New Moston, Manchester, on August 4 1923, the son of an electrical engineer. He was no relation to George Butterworth, the composer of A Shropshire Lad, although confusion often arose; the cover of one CD bears a sticker reading \"Where George Butterworth appears, please read as Arthur Butterworth\". [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Arthur was a choir boy, attended the Hallé's concerts and learnt trombone, cornet and trumpet. He played with local bands before joining the prestigious Besses o' th' Barn band in 1939. At North Manchester Grammar School he had a supportive music teacher, but his family gradually became less enthusiastic about a musical career, even removing their piano. His father arranged for him to join a solicitor's when he left school.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1942 he enlisted with the Royal Engineers, training near Lossiemouth, where he was inspired by the remoteness, and serving in North Africa. After demobilisation in 1947 he joined the Royal Manchester College of Music. He also took lessons privately with Vaughan Williams, who encouraged him to develop his own voice, regardless of the prevailing fashion. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Disillusioned with college, Butterworth left early to join the Scottish National Orchestra as a trumpeter, occasionally helping as a rehearsal conductor. He returned to Manchester in 1955, joining Barbirolli at the Hallé, where he stayed until 1962. He then taught brass in West Yorkshire schools until securing a post at Huddersfield School of Music, but found lecturing frustrating; he resigned in 1980.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]However, he retained his connection with the area, serving as director of the Huddersfield Philharmonic Society (1964-93) and the Settle Orchestra, which he helped to establish in 1967. Despite his views on brass bands, Butterworth was guest conductor of the National Youth Brass Band from 1975 to 1984. He returned to conduct the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in 2008, which was now belatedly championing his music. The following year the sixth of his seven symphonies was premiered in St Petersburg.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Butterworth, who was appointed MBE in 1995, served as chairman of his local RSPCA. His house near Skipton was named Pohjola, a name from Finnish folklore used by Sibelius.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1957 he had dedicated his first symphony to his wife, Diana, whom he had married in 1952. After her death last year he wrote Elegy for Diana, which was premiered in March. \"It now seems fitting that I pay this farewell tribute to her at the end of our long life together,\" he told the Westmorland Gazette. They had two daughters.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2015 – Richard Owen, American composer and United States federal judge in the Southern District of New York, dies at age 92.

His parentage remains a matter of dispute, since documentary evidence is lacking. His father may have been Henry Purcell (d. Westminster, Aug. 11, 1664), a singer, who was named a \"singingman\" and Master of the Choristers at Westminster Abbey (1661) and a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal (1661), where he became a musician-in-ordinary for the lutes and voices (1662).\n\nIt is possible that his father was Thomas Purcell (d. Westminster, July 31,1682), a singer and composer, who most likely was the brother of the elder Henry Purcell; Thomas became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal (1661), where he was admitted to the private music for lutes, viols, and voices (1662); with Pelham Humfrey, he served as composer for the violins (from 1672); that same year he was made marshal of the Corp. of Music and a musician-in-ordinary in the King's Private Musick. Whatever the case, the young Henry Purcell became a chorister of the Chapel Royal under Cooke and Humfrey (1669), and also received instruction from Blow; when his voice broke (1673), he was appointed Assistant Keeper of the Instruments; was named composer-in-ordinary for the violins (1677).\n\nHe became Blow's successor as organist of Westminster Abbey (1679) and one of the 3 organists of the Chapel Royal (1682); was named organ maker and keeper of the king's instruments (1683). His first printed work was a song in Playford's Choice Ayres (vol. I, 1675); vol. II (1679) contains other songs and an elegy on the death of Matthew Locke. In 1680 he publ. one of his finest instrumental works, the Fantasias for Strings; in that same year he began writing odes and welcome songs; although their texts are almost invariably stupid or bombastic, he succeeded in clothing them in some of his finest music; his incidental music for the stage also dates from that year. He wrote the anthem My Heart is Inditing for the coronation of King James II (1685). With Dido and Aeneas (1689) he produced the first great English opera.\n\nIn the remaining years of his life he devoted much time to composition for the theater; he also wrote some outstanding sacred music. Purcell lies in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey, and his burial tablet well expresses contemporary estimation of his worth: \"Here lyes Henry Purcell, Esq.; who left this life, and is gone to that blessed place where only his harmony can be exceeded/' His church music shows him to be an original melodist, and a master of form, harmony, and all contrapuntal devices; his music for the stage is equally rich in invention, dramatic instinct, and power of characterization; his chamber works surpass those of his predecessors and contemporaries. A complete edition of Purcell's works was issued by the Purcell Society (London, 1878-1965; 2nd ed., rev., 1974-81). - Born at London, 1659.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8Vkq5xKkHQ\"]Henry Purcell: Dido and Aeneas (Excerpts 1) - YouTube[/ame][/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1710 - Barnardo Pasquini composer, dies at 72.\n\nin 1742 - Alessandro Felici composer is born.\n\nin 1797 - Pietro Pompeo Sales (de Sala), esteemed Italian composer, dies at Hanau.

Concurrently with his teaching activities, he began to give organ recitals, and soon became known as one of the greatest virtuosos on the instrument; he also played on the 'Kunstharmonium,' for which he wrote many original compositions. His real name, Karg, sounded unattractive to his audiences (it means 'coffin'), and he changed it to Karg-Elert. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]As a composer he developed a brilliant style, inspired by the music of the Baroque, but he embellished this austere and ornamental idiom with Impressionistic devices; the result was an ingratiating type of music with an aura of originality.

At the age of four Hawkins began to study the piano, at seven the cello, and at nine the saxophone. He studied music at Washburn College in Topeka, Kans. (where he's not found in the records but may have gone part-time), and in Chicago. At 16 he was playing professionally in and around Kansas City.\n\nIn the summer of 1921, he was signed by Mamie Smith to join her Jazz Hounds and began recording with her that year. He toured extensively with Smith until early in 1923, when he left her to remain in N.Y. Hawkins gigged with various bands and also did freelance recordings with Fletcher Henderson. He was part of a group of freelance musicians who chose Henderson to front them for an audition in 1923, and landed a gig. Hawkins was a regular member of Henderson's Orchestra from 1924 until early 1934, occasionally doubling on bass sax and very occasionally soloing on clarinet.\n\nHis early solos were rugged and sometimes used slap- tonguing; in later years, he disowned these early attempts. However, by 1929, he had a smoother sound and a flowing use of double-time as on the medium-slow \"One Hour.\" In 1932 he was experimenting with free rhythms in a string of solos with Henderson such as on \"Honeysuckle Rose\" and \"New King Porter Stomp.\" Though Hawkins was not generally known as a composer, in 1933 Henderson recorded his whole-tone essay \"..... Notions.\" By the end of that year he had developed a rhythmically more straightforward, harmonically complex style and had met Lester Young and other tenor challengers at a legendary Kansas City jam session in December.\n\nAt an invitation from Jack Hylton of England, he left Henderson to tour Europe as a soloist. He arrived in England in March 1934 and remained abroad until July 1939, working all across Europe accompanied by various local bands and also other expatriates including Benny Carter. Hawkins returned to N.Y. in July 1939 and formed his own big band for club work by November. Hawkins recorded \"Body and Soul\" that month (the band only provides the closing chord), a Top 20 hit at the time and an enduring jazz classic.\n\nThe big band was active until February 1941, then reverted to a small band that worked through 1943. Unlike many of his generation, he had no problem with bop; he led what is often called the first bop session, a medium-sized band with Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach, in February 1944. He recorded and toured in 1944 with Thelonious Monk, whom he would continue to champion. Hawkins led his own sextet in Calif. with Howard McGhee for most of 1945, including an appearance in the film The Crimson Canary. Perhaps during that year, or a few years later (many sources says 1949), he recorded the first unaccompanied saxophone solos: \"Hawk Variation\" and the astonishing \"Picasso,\" which appears to be very loosely based on an out of tempo treatment of the chords to a standard (\"Body and Soul\" or \"Prisoner of Love\") but more importantly retains the feeling of free improvisation.\n\nIt was said to have required 11 takes but the others appear to be lost. (He did other solo saxophone pieces in the 1950s, inspiring Sonny Rollins to do the same.) In 1946, Hawkins took part in first national Jazz at the Philharmonic tour. He used as sidepersons young musicians Miles Davis, Fats Navarro, J. J. Johnson, and Hank Jones; this group made the first recordings of Monk's tunes \"Well You Needn't\" and \"I Mean You.\" Hawkins returned to Europe in May 1948 for appearances at Paris Jazz Festival, and again visited Europe in late 1949-50. During the 1950s he did extensive touring with Norman Granz's J.A.T.P, including several trips to Europe.\n\nHe also co- led a successful quintet with Roy Eldridge and toured American Service Bases in Europe with Illinois Jacquet's Band (autumn 1954). Through the 1950s, Hawkins made prolific freelance recordings; he was featured at all major jazz festivals in the U.S. and appeared on major television shows and films devoted to jazz. During the early- to mid-1960s, Hawkins continued to work N.Y. clubs leading his own small groups. In 1962, he recorded with Duke Ellington. During the last years of his life he toured Britain as a soloist in November 1967. Hawkins continued to work regularly until a few weeks before his death, and appeared with Roy Eldridge on a Chicago television show early in 1969.\n\nHawkins's harmonic detail, full tone, and wide vibrato became the standard for tenor saxophone. Some credited him with being the first great jazz performer on the instrument, although Hawkins himself granted this honor to earlier musicians. Nonetheless, he was considered the unchallenged leader on the instrument until the advent of Lester Young in the late 1930s. (Hawkins pointedly omitted Young when discussing saxophonists, perhaps his way of dealing with the perceived competition.) During the late 1940s, Hawkins initiated a second career, championing younger musicians and adapting to the changing musical landscape from swing to bop. He remained a vibrant player into his later years, outliving his rival. - Died at N.Y., May 19, 1969.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q7J4PgrRsY\"]Coleman Hawkins - Body & Soul - YouTube[/ame][/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1905 - David Moule-Evans composer is born.\n\nin 1907 - Gaetano Braga composer, dies at 78.\n\nin 1907 - Samuel \"Buck\" Ram (US songwriter, manager of The Platters) is born.\n\nin 1912 - Eleanor Powell Springfield Mass, actress/tap dancer (Bdwy Melody) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1914 - Luca Botta, dramatic tenor, made his Metropolitan Opera House debut as Rodolfo in La Boheme.[/FONT][FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1920 - William James Robjohn composer, dies at 77.\n\nin 1920 - Caryl Florio composer, dies at 77.\n\nin 1921 - Geza Anda Hungarian/Swiss pianist (Mozart/Bartok) is born.\n\nin 1925 - Sal Sergio) Salvador, jazz guitarist, is born at Monson, Mass.

He played with local groups in Springfield, Mass., then moved to N.Y. in 1949; on the recommendation of his friend Mundell Lowe, he got a job at Radio City Music Hall in 1951. Salvador then worked at NBC studios and toured with Terry Gibbs, Eddie Bert, and the Dardanelles. He returned to N.Y, formed a quartet with Lowe, and became a studio musician for Columbia, backing up Tony Bennett, Julie London, Rosemary Clooney, and Marlene Dietrich.\n\nHe played with Stan Kenton (summer 1952- December 1953), led a quartet with Eddie Costa (1954), and played at the Newport Jazz festival (1958), a performance that was captured in the film, Jazz on a Summer's Day. He formed the group Colors in Sound, then moved to the West Coast, where he played occasionally in duets with guitarist Alan Hanlon during the 1970s.

He wrote numerous piano compositions of transcendental difficulty, yet entirely pianistic in style; also arranged works by Weber, Brahms, and Johann Strauss. Particularly remarkable are his 53 studies on Chopin's Etudes, combining Chopin's themes in ingenious counterpoint; among his original works, the most interesting are Triakontameron (30 pieces; 1920; No. 11 is the well known Alt Wien), and Java Suite (12 pieces).
