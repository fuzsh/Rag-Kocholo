        "text": "Ricardo Pepi looks set to bet on himself this summer.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time he's done that, looking back. It was just last year that the young forward wagered that he was ready for a leap to the Bundesliga and a move to one of the division's worst teams - one desperate for a new star.\n\nBoth he, and Augsburg, lost that bet.\n\nIt was, in a word, catastrophic. Pepi never got going in Germany, effectively costing himself a World Cup spot, and Augsburg were stuck with a €18 million (£15m/$20m) signing they had no clue what to do with. Both sides swung big, both sides missed.\n\nNow, less than a year later, they find themselves on opposing sides of another crossroad. On one side, Pepi, whose spell in the Netherlands has him feeling ready for a new challenge; on the other, Augsburg, who feel they've been disrespected and have no desire to let him leave.\n\nWhat happens next will set the tone for the rest of Pepi's career. He's still just 20, but this move, this next big move, will likely be the difference between success or failure at Europe's top levels.\n\nAnd Pepi is ready to push all of his chips into the middle of the table yet again, but will Augsburg be willing to let it happen? We'll find out."
