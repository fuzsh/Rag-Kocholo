The 18-year-old forward is one of the brightest talents in the country, and he’s now moving to a club where his career can progress some more.\n\nPepi was close to a move to Wolfsburg FC but the move never happened as FC Augsburg pounced on the opportunity to sign him. Pepi and his agent are flying to Munich as he becomes one of the first signings of this years January transfer window.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe money FC Augsburg are paying to FC Dallas for Pepi’s signature\n\nAccording to football journalist Fabrizio Romano, Augsburg paid a club-record fee for Ricardo Pepi worth $20m plus a few add-ons. The German club is looking to save itself from relegation as the club are sitting in 15th place in the Bundesliga, just one point away from the relegation zone.\n\nPepi will have the huge responsibility to perform and score a few goals for the club now that they have broken their record to sign him. The previous most expensive player that FC Augsburg signed was Martin Hinteregger for a fee of $11.55m. Pepi’s fee is almost double that amount.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRicardo Pepi and his stats for FC Dallas and the USMNT\n\nFC Augsburg saw something special in Pepi, and they were convinced to break the bank for an 18-year-old who has never played in Europe. So, what was so special about this American? It’s his playing style, which also directly translates into goals.\n\nPepi has scored 16 goals for FC Dallas in 59 appearances along with 4 assists. Dallas was trying to slowly get him accumulated to the top level of the game and hence he played as a substitute most of the time. Nevertheless, his goal return is highly impressive.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nHe has also played 7 games for the USMNT and scored three goals. It’ll be interesting to see where his career goes from here but the youngster has a bright future ahead."
