        "text": "Augsburg are a German football club who feature in the German Bundesliga. Having spent the majority of their history in the lower divisions, they successfully reached the German top-flight for the first time following the conclusion of the 2010-11 campaign. Augsburg, also known as Fuggerstadter, have a rivalry with 1860 Munich which was born out of matches played in the 1970s between the pair. Historically, their most famous and celebrated players are Michael Thurk, Hans Jorg, Georg Beichle, Daniel Baier, Tobias Werner, and Paul Verhaegh. Jos Luhukay was the head coach when they were promoted to the Bundesliga for the first time. Their home since 2009 has been the Augsburg Arena which has a capacity of nearly 32,000 spectators."
