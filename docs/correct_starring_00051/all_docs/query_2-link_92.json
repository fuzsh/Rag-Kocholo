        "text": "A parade of stars is making sure that the 50th anniversary of George Harrison‘s solo album All Things Must Pass isn’t passed over without a special tribute. A selection of more than 40 bold-faced names appears in a new music video for the album’s track “My Sweet Lord.”\n\nDirected by Lance Bangs, and executive produced by Dhani Harrison and David Zonshine, the video stars Fred Armisen and Vanessa Bayer as metaphysical special agents who are tasked by the head of a clandestine agency, played by Mark Hamill, to “search for that which can’t be seen.” As they set off on the journey, dozens of agents team up to look high and low for what may have been right in front of them all along. The clip also features Harrison’s wife, Olivia, and son, Dhani, who appear opposite actress Aimee Mullins and actor Rupert Friend.\n\nIt’s not the first notice the album has received recently. The 50th-anniversary uber-deluxe edition received a nomination for best boxed or special limited edition package for the upcoming Grammy Awards, set for Jan. 31."
