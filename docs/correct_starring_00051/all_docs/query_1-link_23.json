        "text": "A Hard Day's Night Official Trailer (2014) The Beatles, Musical HD\n\nA Hard Day’s Night was released in 1964 to critical acclaim, receiving two Academy Award-nominations after its release. The film showcased a fictionalised version of The Beatles dealing with their staggering fame. On top of working with the irritating press, fighting back their fans and working up to a prestigious TV performance, they were given scenes which showed their humour and personalities. The BAFTA-nominated director explained years later how he found working with each of the band members and touched upon the quality of their acting.\n\nGeorge Harrison, in particular, was the “best” actor out of the band, Lester said.\n\nWhile talking at the BFI in 2014 the director revealed: “George, I think, was the most effective actor all the way through.\n\n“He attempted less, but he always hit it right in the centre, and I always knew what I was going to get with George.”\n\nGeorge had quite a few solo scenes throughout the film, including some quick instances with press interviews and conversations about buying new “grotty” clothes from a fashion brand.\n\nREAD MORE: George Harrison’s heart-wrenching song about split with wife Boyd\n\nGeorge wasn’t the only member of the band to receive solo scenes in their film debut.\n\nRingo Starr and John Lennon also had some moments to themselves in the movie, exploring their fictional characters.\n\nPaul McCartney was the only member of the band who didn’t have any solo scenes in the final movie.\n\nAlthough he did shoot a solo scene it was axed from the movie. The Beatles Bible claims Lester thought it “lacked pace”.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They thought The Beatles were going to be a spent force by the end of the summer.\n\n“Before we started shooting The Beatles went and did The Ed Sullivan Show in the States and the world changed.”\n\nLester continued: “So when it came to making the film, we were already in profit from pre-orders of the album soundtrack. No one had ever heard of such a thing.”\n\nHe also utilised some fans and their reactions within the movie.\n\nSpeaking about using Beatles fanatics during filming, he said: “I wasn’t ever going up to the children and asking them to scream, or for some to shout for John and others to shout for Ringo.\n\n“I didn’t do anything, I just let them all behave as they would.”\n\nSOURCE"
