        "text": "Concert for George, the film shot at a 2002 concert honoring the late George Harrison, will screen in theaters around the world for its 20th anniversary on November 29. The film and its soundtrack have been remastered in Dolby Atmos, and a new introduction by Olivia and Dhani Harrison will precede screenings. Find the list of participating theaters, which span most U.S. states as well as Europe and the rest of North and South America, here.\n\nStaged on the first anniversary of the Beatles guitarist’s death, the concert was organized by Eric Clapton and Olivia Harrison. It took place at London’s Royal Albert Hall and featured Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Ravi and Anoushka Shankar, Jools Holland, Jeff Lynne, members of Monty Python, and more. The film is being released by Abramorama, in association with Craft Recordings. The Dolby Atmos remaster of the live album is also streaming from today.\n\nIn a press release, Olivia Harrison said, “A long time ago, imagining his ideal gig, George had said, ‘I could do something like that someday... [it’s] the perfect idea... I mean if I had a ‘special’ I would like to have a few people who mean something to me.’” She continued:\n\nAnd he was right, he was so prescient and so right. It went from the sublime Ravi & Anoushka Shankar Orchestra to the ludicrous Monty Python. The most deep moving songs written by George, whose meanings were potentised by his absence, played with heart and soul by a core group of friends. It is a joy to be able to relive that incredible evening again, on a big screen, 20 years on.\n\nDhani Harrison added: “20 years ago, I stood on stage beside my father’s dearest friends and celebrated his life and music. It was one of the most beautiful things we could’ve done on that day to mark his passing. There was a lot of love involved in that show, which has been preserved in this Concert for George film. I hope you dig it.”"
