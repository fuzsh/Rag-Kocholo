        "text": "You know that Sam Mendes is directing four movies about the Beatles.\n\nJeff Sneider of The InSneider is reporting that Harris Dickinson (John Lennon), Paul Mescal (Paul McCartney), Barry Keoghan (Ringo Starr), and Charlie Rowe (George Harrison) are going to portray the Fab Four. These films are set to be interconnected stories, one from each band member’s point of view.\n\nThe movies will open in 2027, not sure in what order or simultaneously. Titles of each films: Maybe a song from each Beatle. Ringo’s could be “Act Naturally.” George would be “Here Comes the Sun.” John -“In My Life.” Paul — “The Long and Winding Road.”\n\nMendes has total use of all the music, archives, etc. So there will new soundtracks. Presumably, the music will be overseen by Giles Martin, of the “fifth Beatle,” George Martin.\n\nRead Jeff Sneider’s Insneider newsletter. He’s got great scoops!\n\nRoger Friedmanhttps://www.showbiz411.com\n\nRoger Friedman began his Showbiz411 column in April 2009 after 10 years with Fox News, where he created the Fox411 column.
