At the time of writing, these rumours have not been confirmed nor denied by Sony, which will be distributing Mendes’ films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, in an exclusive interview with NME to promote House Of The Dragon season two, Frankel has revealed that he auditioned for the role of Harrison, but didn’t land the part. Watch it in full above\n\n“I read to play George,” he said. “I had an audition. But I just think I look a little Latino. I just don’t think I could, but I would love to play George.”\n\nHe added that he never got to read the finished script, explaining that it was a “transcribed audition”.\n\nRecommended\n\nFellow House Of The Dragon star Matt Smith, who was also part of the interview with NME, then jokingly suggested that his co-star could play Ricky Martin, before singing a rendition of ‘Livin’ La Vida Loca’.\n\nThe upcoming biopics mark the first time Apple Corps Ltd. and The Beatles – Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, along with the families of John Lennon and George Harrison – have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.\n\nThe films are set to have a global release in 2027, with the band saying in a statement: “The dating cadence of the films, the details of which will be shared closer to release, will be innovative and groundbreaking”.\n\nAdvertisement"
