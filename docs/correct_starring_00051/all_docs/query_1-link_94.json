DCP. Approx. 208 min.\n\nREVIEW\n“This is a more objective, less personal documentary than Scorsese usually makes. Considering its length, there isn't much concert footage, and it focuses on archival interviews with George, news footage, and an impressive selection of talking heads.”\n– Roger Ebert\n\n“For any fan of the Beatles, or anyone interested in pop history, there is something of interest in every minute; particularly some stunning still photos of Harrison and the band in the early 60s….Scorsese's film suggests that alone in the Beatles, and perhaps alone in pop's premier league, Harrison was an authentic spiritual figure. For Harrison fans, this is a treat.”\n– Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian",
