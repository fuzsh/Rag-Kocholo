        "text": "On November 29, 2002, one year after his passing, Olivia Harrison and Eric Clapton organized a performance tribute to celebrate the life and music of George Harrison. Held at London’s Royal Albert Hall, the momentous evening featured George’s songs, and music he loved, performed by artists including Eric Clapton, Joe Brown, Dhani Harrison, Jools Holland, Jeff Lynne, Paul McCartney, Monty Python, Tom Petty, Billy Preston, Ravi & Anoushka Shankar, Ringo Starr and more.\n\nA unique opportunity to own a piece of the historic event, by way of a cutting from the original hand-painted on-stage tapestry used as the backdrop at the Royal Albert Hall on November 29, 2002. Limited to 1,000 pieces worldwide, the cuttings are available as part of the Digital Box Set, which is housed in a gold-colored, fabric-wrapped box with a die-cut mandala window to display the unique stage fabric (which is mounted on an individually numbered card, suitable for framing). The Deluxe Box Set includes a note from Olivia Harrison, explaining the story behind the tapestry."
