        "text": "George Harrison would have been “very happy” that relationships between Beatles’ members are cast in a more positive light by a new documentary, his son has said.\n\nThe film aims to provide an honest insight into the relationship between the men and their creative process during the January 1969 recording sessions.\n\nDhani Harrison said his father had always been “bummed out” that this part of the world-famous rock band’s history was associated with negativity.\n\nThe documentary, to be released later this month and directed by Peter Jackson, is made entirely from never-before seen footage.\n\nMr Harrison and his partner, musician Mereki Beach, joined a host of famous faces at its premiere in Leicester Square, including Noel Gallagher, Martin Freeman and former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney himself.\n\nMr Harrison, who was involved in the creation of the documentary, said Jackson had “really delivered”.\n\n“(My father) was always bummed out that this was portrayed in bad light and they were always a bit sad about it and that’s why Peter has been given such a big crack at it,” he told the PA news agency.\n\n“He’s really delivered.\n\n“Sure, there were arguments, but what you’re going to see is way more of just a band squabbling, and it’s nice.\n\n“(The documentary) creates a new dynamic, and anyone who gets to see the whole thing will see that the behaviour changes and they really come together.\n\n“He’d be very happy to see what Peter came out with.”\n\nGeorge Harrison, who was the Beatles’ lead guitarist, died of cancer in 2001.\n\nMr Harrison’s son also admitted his own fashion sense was “not quite up to the level” of his father’s in the film.\n\n“He did have very cool outfits, I’m not quite up to his level of outfit. There were some pretty bizarre shirts,” he said.\n\n“At one point he puts a bow tie just around his neck without a shirt.\n\n“(His fashion sense) was pretty awesome, balls to the wall – I don’t fit in his suits, I’m too fat.”\n\nRingo Starr’s son, Zak Starkey, who also attended the red-carpet event, said the band remained “unbeatable”.\n\n“It’s going to be great – I haven’t seen (the film) yet,” he said.\n\n“Remember, my dad was the greatest rock and roll drummer in the world. The music is great and it always will be great.”\n\nMr Starkey said he had not yet spoken about the documentary to his father but would do so when he had seen it.\n\nFellow musicians called the band’s influence “absolute”.\n\nFormer Oasis lead guitarist Noel Gallagher said: “They influenced everybody who influenced everybody else, who influenced everybody that came and went.\n\n“Their influence is absolute.\n\n“I don’t know a single guy playing the guitar or writing songs that wouldn’t cite the Beatles as an influence.\n\n“And if he doesn’t, he’s undoubtedly going to be s**t.”"
