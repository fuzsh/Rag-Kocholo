        "text": "2011 film directed by Martin Scorsese\n\nThis article is about the film. For the album, see Living in the Material World.\n\nGeorge Harrison: Living in the Material WorldDirected byMartin ScorseseProduced by\n\nOlivia Harrison\n\nMartin Scorsese\n\nNigel Sinclair\n\nCinematographyEdited byDavid Tedeschi\n\nProduction\n\ncompanies\n\nDistributed byHBO\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n208 minutes[2][3]CountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBox office$367,734[4]\n\nGeorge Harrison: Living in the Material World is a 2011 documentary film co-produced and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the life of musician George Harrison, former member of the Beatles. The film's release was coordinated with both a companion book and an album of Harrison's demo recordings. The film earned Emmy Awards for Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming and Outstanding Nonfiction Special.\n\nThe film offers a biographical perspective on the life of musician George Harrison, from his early life in Liverpool, the Beatlemania phenomenon, his travels to India, the influence of Krishna Consciousness movement in his music, and his relevance and importance as a member of the Beatles. It consists of previously unseen footage alongside a wide range of interviews, including Olivia and Dhani Harrison.\n\nAfter Harrison's death in 2001, various production companies approached his widow Olivia about producing a film about her late husband's life. She declined because he had wanted to tell his own life story through his video archive. Upon meeting Scorsese, she gave her blessings and signed on to the film project as a producer.\n\nAccording to Scorsese, he was attracted to the project because \"That subject matter has never left me...The more you're in the material world, the more there is a tendency for a search for serenity and a need to not be distracted by physical elements that are around you. His music is very important to me, so I was interested in the journey that he took as an artist. The film is an exploration. We don't know. We're just feeling our way through.\"[5]\n\nThroughout 2008 and 2009, Scorsese alternated working between Shutter Island and the documentary. Scorsese, his editor David Tedeschi, and a small army of researchers spent five years assembling interviews, music, film clips, photos, and memorabilia.[6]\n\n==Studio== {{Plainlist|\n\nGrove Street Pictures\n\nSpitfire Pictures\n\nSikelia Productions\n\nGrove Street Productions\n\nHBO\n\nThe documentary premièred at the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology in Liverpool on 2 October 2011.[7] It was shown on HBO in two parts on 5 and 6 October 2011 in the United States and Canada[8][9] and as a two-part Arena special on BBC Two on 12 and 13 November 2011 in the United Kingdom.[10] It was first theatrically released in Australia on 20 October 2011.[2]\n\nSee also: Early Takes: Volume 1\n\nAll songs written by George Harrison, except where noted.[11]\n\n\"My Sweet Lord\" (Demo) – 3:33\n\n\"Run of the Mill\" (Demo) – 1:56\n\n\"I'd Have You Anytime\" (Early Take) (George Harrison, Bob Dylan) – 3:06\n\n\"Mama, You've Been on My Mind\" (Demo) (Bob Dylan) – 3:04\n\n\"Let It Be Me\" (Demo) (Gilbert Bécaud, Mann Curtis, Pierre Delanoë) – 2:56\n\n\"Woman Don't You Cry for Me\" (Early Take) – 2:44\n\n\"Awaiting on You All\" (Early Take) – 2:40\n\n\"Behind That Locked Door\" (Demo) – 3:29\n\n\"All Things Must Pass\" (Demo) – 4:38\n\n\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\" (Demo) – 2:23\n\nOlivia Harrison authored the book George Harrison: Living in the Material World published by Abrams in 2011.[12][13] The book was edited by Mark Holborn and contains a foreword by Scorsese and an introduction by author and literary critic Paul Theroux.[14]\n\nGeorge Harrison: Living in the Material World grossed $0 in the United States and Canada,[2] and a worldwide total of $367,734.[4]\n\nThe film holds an 86% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 37 professional reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.
