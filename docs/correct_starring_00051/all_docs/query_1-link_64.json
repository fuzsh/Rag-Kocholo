        "text": "And in this hour of darkness, The Beatles movie Let It Be is returning to screens.\n\nThe movie that was first released amid the swirl of the band’s breakup in 1970 will launch May 8 on Disney+ and has unveiled a trailer. Once viewed through a darker lens, the film now is brought to light through its restoration and in the context of revelations brought forth in Peter Jackson’s multiple Emmy-winning docuseries, The Beatles: Get Back, which was a smash hit three years ago.\n\nLet it Be contains footage not in the epic Get Back docuseries, bringing viewers into the studio and onto Apple Corps’ London rooftop in January 1969 as The Beatles, joined by Billy Preston, write and record their Grammy-winning album, which came as they were tearing one another apart and toward the end of the band’s incredible career.\n\nRELATED:\n\nLet it Be, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, stars John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, with a special appearance by Preston. The film was produced by Neil Aspinall, with The Beatles acting as executive producers. The director of photography was Anthony B. Richmond."
