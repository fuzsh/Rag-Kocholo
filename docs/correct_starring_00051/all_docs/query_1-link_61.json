        "text": "George Harrison’s songs may not have equaled the prodigious output and popularity of bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney, but he sure did write some gems, including “Here Comes the Sun” and “Something.” He was known as the “quiet Beatle,” but by all accounts, Harrison was playful, introspective, curious and a seeker of enlightenment.\n\nAll this is on display at the “Concert for George” that took place in London’s Albert Hall exactly one year after Harrison’s death from cancer at age 58 on Nov. 29, 2001. Film of that all-star tribute concert, directed by David Leland and shot by veteran cinematographer Chris Menges, has been digitally remastered. “Concert for George” arrives in theaters, including the Jane Pickens Theater, for one night only on Nov. 29.\n\nThe spirit of Harrison is everywhere, starting with the presence of his wife, Olivia, who co-organized the concert with Eric Clapton, and she co-produced the film with George’s son, guitarist Dhani Harrison.\n\nWith his dark hair and white tunic, Dhani not only looks just like his father, but interacts with fellow musicians onstage with the same sweet, self-effacing grace. Clapton, Harrison’s longtime friend and collaborator, serves as music director and master of ceremonies.\n\nThe event is notable for reuniting the two surviving Beatles, McCartney and Ringo Starr, who perform to thunderous ovations. In a joyful moment, the crowd joins Starr in singing ”Photograph,” the 1973 hit he wrote with Harrison.\n\nIn keeping with the magnanimous spirit of the concert, the former Beatles are just part of the collection of Harrison’s bandmates, friends and colleagues, united in their expressions of joy to counter their loss.\n\nBritish performer Joe Brown, of BBC and West End stage fame, may not be a household name in the United States, but he was a close friend of Harrison’s and nearly steals the show. The crowd roars when he launches into the legendary opening bars of “Here Comes the Sun,” then delivers a sublime rendition of Harrison’s classic tune. Brown also closes the concert, playing the ukulele, one of Harrison’s pet instruments, as he sings “I’ll See You in My Dreams.”\n\nMcCartney also strums the ukulele for a playful opening to “Something,” arguably Harrison’s most beloved composition. The full band, including Clapton and Dhani Harrison, join McCartney for a moving rendition. There’s also a powerful version of “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” featuring Clapton on guitar, McCartney on piano and Starr on drums.\n\nOf course, Harrison had a long career post-Beatles. In the late 1980s, along with Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan, he was part of the supergroup, the Traveling Wilburys. While Dylan is absent from “Concert for George,” Lynne co-produced the event and performs several numbers, including “Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth).”\n\nPetty and the Heartbreakers have fun with Harrison’s acerbic “Taxman,” from the Beatles’ seminal album, “Revolver.” Petty is among the scattered interviewees who talk about their connection to Harrison, although these are mostly generic clips that don’t add much to the overall film.\n\nThe music is what matters. Other highlights include Beatles collaborator Billy Preston’s powerhouse performance of Harrison’s 1970 hit “My Sweet Lord.” The concert pays homage to Harrison’s passion for Indian music with his friend and mentor, Ravi Shankar, speaking about him, and Shankar’s daughter, Anoushka, playing a riveting sitar solo. It’s especially poignant to watch the concert now, since Preston, Petty and Shankar have all died in the intervening 20 years.\n\nAnother unexpected highlight is when members of the Monty Python troupe, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Python contributor Neil Innes take the stage for a comic bit. Michael Palin, actor Tom Hanks and the Fred Tomlinson Singers then appear in costume with the Pythons for a comic performance of “The Lumberjack Song.”\n\nThe silliness might seem out of place until Gilliam reveals how much Harrison loved Monty Python and considered the group’s madcap spirit to be the direct descendant of the early Beatles.\n\n“Concert for George” is a touching tribute to Harrison as an artist and human being, and a welcome celebration of music and camaraderie."
