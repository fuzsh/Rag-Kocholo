The film also includes the band's last public performance together.\n\nThe film was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg and along with the band, it stars the singer/songwriter Billy Preston, who joined The Beatles to write and record their iconic album and song.\n\nNow that the film has been lovingly restored, by Peter Jackson's Park Road Post Production, fans can enjoy the film like it's never been seen before. The restoration used the original 16mm negative, and the technology used in the director's The Beatles: Get Back series released in 2021.\n\nHow to watch the film Let It Be\n\nYou can watch Let It Be on Disney+ now.\n\nHow to get Disney+\n\nYou can sign up for Disney+ for only £4.99 per month, with adverts. 18+.
