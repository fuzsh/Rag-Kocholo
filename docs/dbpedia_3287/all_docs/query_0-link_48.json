        "text": "Ultimate Spider-Man is quite possibly the most anticipated comic of the last ten years, and for good reason. Jonathan Hickman has worked his magic with the X-Men, and now he’s rebooting the Ultimate Universe and focusing on Spider-Man. Spider-Man is possibly the most popular modern character of our time, and he’s getting a fresh new start in Ultimate Spider-Man #1, where Peter Parker is in his late 30s, doesn’t have powers, and is happily married to Mary Jane with two healthy kids. It’s the dream scenario for Peter Parker…until he realizes what his life has been missing all along.\n\nRunning 40 pages, Ultimate Spider-Man feels robust in its opening salvo. To curb expectations, I’ll spoil the fact that he’s not fighting supervillains or even wearing a costume of any kind for most of the issue. No, instead, this is an opening salvo to get readers acclimated to a Peter Parker who is slightly different due to circumstances influenced by The Maker in this universe.\n\nAs we saw in the preview, he’s happily married, and his two kids are the apple of his eye. It’s everything after the preview where things come into focus, especially the Daily Bugle. We’ve already seen he works there, and his relationship with J. Jonah Jameson is compelling. It feels natural, especially if you’ve liked what Chip Zdarsky did over the last few years, while adding a different sprinkle of fathering. There are other slight changes, and yet Peter seems himself for the most part. One of the biggest reasons you’ll want to read this is to see how the little changes and lack of being a hero have augmented the character and, quite possibly, the world.\n\nWhat many will gravitate towards, especially if you’re in your 30s or 40s, is that Peter has a feeling that something isn’t quite right. He was meant to do something else. He’s not sure what it is, but for anyone going through a midlife crisis, they can likely relate. The reader knows what’s missing, but Peter doesn’t even by the end of this issue.\n\nThere are also larger implications you’ll be pondering, although Hickman doesn’t get into that very much. We know the world has been strongly steered away from heroes and their influence, but just how dark are these times? As for his issue, it seems the world is fairly similar to ours, and is that the point being made, or just a byproduct? There’s also the question about who Peter is and how becoming a superhero later in life will change him. They may not be touched upon, but they are incredibly strong aspects to hang this series on.\n\nThere are familiar characters that pop up, including a superhero who also fights crime in New York, as well as a major villain. If you’re a fan of the Daily Bugle, you will love this book. It’s primarily centered around the newspaper and Peter being a journalist. There’s even a known villain who has ties to its organization.\n\nThis issue is mostly a character piece, though there is some action. Marco Checchetto is a master at character acting on a highly detailed, realistic level. Peter still seems young, but his unkempt beard and slightly tired eyes help convey he’s older and has lived a whole life. Meanwhile, Mary Jane also seems young but more put together. Adding to the realism is backgrounds, which Checchetto excels at. The city looks super realistic, and his perspective is on point when a violent act occurs.\n\nFrom a storytelling perspective, Checchetto is very good at picking the right angle and expression to hammer home the importance of dialogue. Readers will hone in on a few key moments, and the great framing meets the expectations.\n\nIf there’s anything wrong with this issue, it’s that the kids don’t get much time on the page. As of this issue, we can infer they are loved and likely talented, but we know very little about them. There’s also a lack of action, but it’s pretty clear that’s now what this book is about, at least not at the start.\n\nWarning. Stop reading if you’d like to avoid spoilers!\n\nThe biggest change is something many anticipated, but it works quite well. As of this issue, we know Aunt May is dead, but that leaves Uncle Ben still in the picture. His role in Peter’s life is interesting, and since he’s a character we’ve barely gotten to know over Spider-Man’s decades-long existence, there’s a lot of open ground Hickman can cover. It’s through his dynamic with Jameson that’s particularly intriguing, as they both work at the Daily Bugle.\n\nHickman also gives us a key scene between Mary Jane and Peter. Hickman is aware fans will be on edge about how these two are doing, and he plays up a possible breakup. This adds tension, although if you haven’t been reading Spider-Man in a while, you might miss that aspect. No, their relationship is strong and as wholesome as ever.\n\nThis issue is also directly connected to where the universe is going, so you won’t want to miss it even if you’re not a Spider-Man fan. It involves Tony Stark and it’s quite compelling what we learn. This world has so emphatically been augmented by The Maker and a group of villains that even the craziest conspiracy theorists are probably right. It’s a world where heroes should have existed, but now they’re all likely returning to their powers two decades later. Whether they’re too late remains to be seen, but it’s interesting how this universe may shift due to the delay."
