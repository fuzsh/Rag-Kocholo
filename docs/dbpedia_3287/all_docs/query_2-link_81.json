        "text": "No surprise here, but Marvel is all in on Doctor Doom. The villain is Marvel Comics’s new Sorcerer Supreme after the end of Blood Hunt. And starting in 2025, they’ll be kicking off “One World Under Doom,” a mysterious new event. Also, there’s that whole “Robert Downey Jr. as Doom” thing. And now, he’s straight up murdering your favorite heroes in a series of variant covers.\n\nPer Marvel, there are 21 total variant covers rolling out weekly from the publisher — 11 of which have been revealed below. They include Doom beating the Avengers, chopping up Deadpool, strangling Miles Morales, and the less asked about what’s going on with Spider-Gwen the better.\n\nYou can check them all out below, including the full list of variants coming in October.
