        "text": "Silver Surfer was getting a second season, but there was a Marvel lawsuit/bankruptcy issue that caused it to get canned.\n\nA Captain America series that was also in development at the time suffered the same fate, which is too bad because the Captain America show looked awesome.\n\nWhat sucks is that when Marvel started making new shows again we were forced to suffer through Avengers United They Stand and Spider-man Unlimited. Its like this is what we were waiting for? Neither show lasted a full season, they were awful and not to the standard of storytelling of the previous shows that had come before.\n\nI think if you go to Marvel Animation Age, you can read a really good interview with John Semper about working on the 90's Spider-man series, and that Avi Arad while I guess he did a good job in getting the deals made was a terrible at the creative process and screwed a lot of things up.\n\nOkay, everyone complains about the Spider-Man TAS cliffhanger, and, quite frankly, I don't see why. The ending was extremely satisfying, and the search for MJ is more of a sidenote as far as I'm concerned. It wasn't a suspenseful cliffhanger which leaves you begging for more - it was an interesting one which leaves you guessing at what could have happened. And, in all honesty, if they did have a sixth season, it would've been pretty lousy.... It would have suffered from corniness and an overly simplified plot.\n\nNow Spider-Man Unlimited - that leaves you wanting more! It's just all like, \"Everybody's going to die!!!! To Be Continued!!!!\", and then, it's not continued....\n\nNow, I'm pretty sure that they even started production of a part two and scripts for some of the rest of Season 2 (though I can't say I know 100%), but I don't think they've ever released anything. They are evil!!!\n\nOkay, everyone complains about the Spider-Man TAS cliffhanger, and, quite frankly, I don't see why.

When I saw the last episode I believe I was around 10. So I had spent some time invested in the show. For it to end on a cliffhanger really didn't sit well with me and as I got older the resentment kind of just stuck. When you're that young I guess we expect things to be told to us 100%. Now that Im almost 22, I don't really feel that bad about it..but I still don't think it was a good end and thats partly due to me still holding those initial feelings...just deep down.\n\nNow Spider-Man Unlimited - that leaves you wanting more!

Although I thought that the cliffhanger, those last 3 minutes, were probably the best thing that show ever did. But when you have a show that fails to connect on any level a cliffhanger loses all purpose.\n\nI'm not sure if they did work on a second season due to Marvel's financial situation. They might have waited to see the numbers when this show premiered and maybe done some pre-production( this is all speculation ) however when the show tanked in the ratings they scrapped it completely.\n\nHere's my theory on that based on my own reaction to the finale of the 90s Spider man.

Either they should've done it in the first place or just resolved it. Something about that cliffhanger still feels tacked on.\n\nI disagree with you entirely and believe your opinions may be biased, but to each his own....\n\nI don't see how my opinions are biased as I wasn't really comparing it to anything or showing any signs of bias. On its own merits and when compared to nothing else its a terrible show to me and many others. But everything has at least one fan.\n\nAnd why's that?\n\nWWII = intense violence, the kind that can't be shown in great detail on a Saturday morning cartoon. JL got away with it with 3 episodes and most shows use flashbacks as well like X Men Evolution. But even those shows probably pushed the amount of violence that can be shown when depicting WWII. But a whole season is what they wanted and that just cannot happen..I'm actually surprised who ever was developing the show actually thought that would be even doable.\n\nMaybe it was for the best. Spider-Man Unlimited didn't exactly have any great plots to begin with. In fac the juciess thing that was going to happen was\n\nThe redheaded chick was going to find out that the High Evolutionary was her uncle.\n\nWow. That sure would've been a huge shock at the end of season one... not.\n\nPeter didn't really care what happened on Counter-Earth. All he wanted was to get Jameson and bolt. Even when he agreed to help out, it still felt like he was just doing it to humor Jameson long enough until A) They won or B) Jameson got tired of fighting and want to leave. I also didn't like how villains from Earth were remade into new villains on Counter-Earth i.e. - Green Goblin and Kraven. I though the series was continued from Spider-Man TAS not it's own continuity.\n\nBarely, It comes off sort like they had forgotten the whole MJ thing and just added it in at the last minute of the episode.
