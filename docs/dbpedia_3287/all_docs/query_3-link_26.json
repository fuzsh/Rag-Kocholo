        "text": "Marvel’s Spider-Man: Hostile Takeover\n\nPeter Parker is caught in a complicated web. Working in a cutting-edge laboratory, he's a young scientist who's trying to make a difference. Yet he's constantly burdened by the responsibilities of his second career as the crime-fighting...SPIDER-MAN.\n\nWilson Fisk—the so-called Kingpin of Crime—has returned to New York, establishing himself publicly as an altruistic entrepreneur and philanthropist. Spider-Man knows better, but he can't uncover Fisk's scheme that, if executed, will make the crime lord \"too big to fail.\"\n\nWhen a new threat—a deadly doppelganger with Spider-Man's suit and abilities—wreaks havoc in the streets, can the real wall-crawler prove his innocence? With the clock ticking and lives on the line, can Spider-Man stop the brutal rampage of the Blood Spider? Will Spider-Man fall to his fears and foes, or will he rise and be greater?\n\nSetting the stage for Marvel's Spider-Man, this story is not to be passed over! Pick up this exciting prequel in bookstores today!\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales – Wings of Fury\n\nAre you itching for another prequel story before diving back into the Marvel’s Spider-Man games? Check out the Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales prequel novel, Wings of Fury!\n\nMiles Morales has a lot going on, what with moving to a new neighborhood, dealing with the loss of his father, and the whole gaining super-powers thing. After a misunderstanding with the law, Miles questions what it means to be a hero when people are ready to believe the worst in you. Tempted by the power and freedom of his new abilities, Miles must decide what kind of Spider-Man he wants to be.\n\nWhen Vulture starts wreaking havoc across the city with his new accomplice Starling, Miles can't just sit back and watch. Teamed up with Peter Parker, the two Spider-Men must stop the winged duo before they can unleash experimental tech across the whole city. With lives at risk, can Miles step up and be a hero?\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man 2 Prequel Comic\n\nFor Free Comic Book Day 2023, Marvel and insomniac Games released a prequel comic to give you a look at what Peter, Miles, and MJ have been up to after the events of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.\n\nWhen the story opens, MJ and Peter are back from Symkaria, and MJ has just finished her first book, “Perilous: A Journey Into War-Torn Symkaria.” But unfortunately, sales aren’t going well, and she’s been forced to go on J. Jonah Jameson’s “Just The Facts” podcast to try and drum up support for her book. As their ideologies clash and the interview starts to go south, the Spider-Men literally crash the interview while fighting The Tarantula (a familiar face from SPIDERGEDDON #0). Miles and Peter wrap up the Tarantula, which also wraps up MJ’s disastrous interview.\n\nAs the story continues, we see several worlds colliding in the lives of Miles, Peter, and MJ. Miles, a student at Brooklyn Visions Academy, sees all of his friends solidifying their plans for college—but he is feeling left out. He’s been so focused on other things; he hasn’t had time to think about the future. There are plenty of directions he could go but trying to pick the ‘right’ one is overwhelming and paralyzing.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter is back in Queens, living in the house he grew up in. But he’s drowning in bills. May had mortgaged the house to keep F.E.A.S.T. running during the events of Marvel’s Spider-Man, and now Peter is left with the responsibility of finding a new job in order to make the payments. MJ would make a perfect housemate to help with the mortgage, but she needs to stay in the city for her job as an associate editor at the Daily Bugle. At least that’s what she tells Peter. There is unspoken tension between them, as both struggle to take the next step in their relationship.\n\nOn top of all that, there’s a new gang in town, and they appear to be using…magic? Our heroes work together to track down and confront members of this gang, using their super powers to uncover the gang’s leader: The Hood! This new Super Villain appears to have supernatural abilities that defy mere webs and fists. While Miles, Peter, and MJ attempt to balance their responsibilities to the city, and each other, they keep coming back to one of the main themes of this action-packed issue: is magic real?\n\nMake sure to head to your local comic book shop and see if they’ve got a copy!
