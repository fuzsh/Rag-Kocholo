        "text": "Spider-Man has had several small and big screen adaptations over the years, and this one remains one of the best. Welcome to WatchMojo.com and today we’ll be counting down our picks for the Top 10 Spider-Man: The Animated Series Episodes.\n\nFor this list, we are looking at the best story arcs from the series. As such, some entries may include multiple episodes that cover one major storyline.\n\n#10: “Morbius / “Enter the Punisher”/ “Duel of the Hunters”\n\nThis story arc features Peter Parker sprouting four extra arms, appearances by the Punisher, Michael Morbius, and Kraven the Hunter, and the infamous Man-Spider. Believing that Spider-Man is a criminal, the Punisher attempts to capture him. At the same time, Spidey is searching for a cure to fix his mutation, only for it to accelerate and turn him into the deadly Man-Spider. Featuring several awesome fight scenes and a great cliffhanger where we are left wondering how Peter is going to survive, this is definitely a standout in the overall series.\n\n#9: “The Return of Hydro-Man” Parts 1 & 2\n\nAs the main love interest of Peter Parker aka Spider-Man, Mary Jane Watson is in severe danger several times throughout the series, such as when a bomb thrown by the Green Goblin causes her to fall off George Washington Bridge in “Turning Point.” It’s this two-parter that makes our list, however, as it teases us with a glimpse of a potentially powerful Mary Jane, only to rip our hearts out with one of the most emotional scenes in the series as she turns to vapor in Spider-Man’s arms. It’s impressive how an animated show with a limited runtime can generate so much tension and emotion.\n\n#8: “Night of the Lizard”\n\nWe go all the way back to the pilot for the next entry on our list. This episode does a fantastic job establishing the characters of both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, and also introduces us to one of his greatest villains, the Lizard. The main storyline, featuring the Lizard attempting to turn everyone in the city into reptiles, is strong enough, but this show also introduces Eddie Brock and subtly initiates the rivalry between him and Spider-Man. While this may seem like a minor detail, it does a great job setting up a future episode on this list.\n\n#7: “Blade, the Vampire Hunter” / “The Immortal Vampire”\n\nOne of the best parts of the MCU is seeing all our favorite Marvel heroes interacting with each other across various films. “Spider-Man: The Animated Series” did this way back in the 90s, however, as numerous Marvel heroes and villains were featured on the show, including Blade. After some initial hostilities between the pair, Spidey and Blade team up to track down the vampire Morbius. These two episodes do an equally impressive job showing the hardships Peter faces, as his Aunt is kidnapped and he neglects Mary Jane, sending her into the arms of Harry Osborn. One of the best things this show does is humanize Peter, as clearly evident here.\n\n#6: “The Insidious Six” / “Battle of the Insidious Six”\n\nWhat better way to start the second season than by having Spidey face six of his toughest enemies teamed up together while losing his powers at the same time? The Insidious Six consists of Doc Ock, Chameleon, Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio, and Scorpion, and they actually capture and unmask the web-slinger at one point. Peter is forced to prove that there is more to Spider-Man than just the wall-crawling and web-shooting, and he does so through his wit and indomitable spirit, which is what makes him so endearing to comic book fans.\n\n#5: “The Mutant Agenda” / “Mutants Revenge”\n\nAnother crossover with famous Marvel heroes, this episode sees Spider-Man teaming up with the X-Men, and in particular, Wolverine; after some initial hostilities of course. It almost becomes a buddy comedy with two complete opposites working together to rescue Beast. Considering “X-Men” was a terrific cartoon as well, it’s no surprise that this episode was a smash hit. This episode also features the Hobgoblin as a villain, who is voiced by Mark Hamill, which alone makes the episode worth watching.\n\n#4: “Secret Wars” Parts 1, 2, & 3\n\nThis is every comic book fan’s dream - a huge lineup of famous heroes against famous villains. Spider-Man is transported to another dimension by Madame Web for an experiment - to see whether good or evil is stronger. Starting for the villains include Doctor Octopus, Dr. Doom, the Lizard, the Red Skull, and Alistair Smythe. Spidey responds by bringing in the Fantastic Four, Captain America, Iron Man, and Storm. While the events in this episode don’t have any lasting effects per se, it’s pretty cool to see an all-star lineup of heroes and villains square off against each other.\n\n#3: “Venom Returns”/ “Carnage”\n\nJust when you think Venom had been defeated for good, he returns with a vengeance. This two-part storyline also introduces us to Cletus Kasady, who eventually becomes Carnage. Carnage and Venom quickly team-up and easily overcome Spider-Man and War Machine, only for Venom to turn on Carnage. The second episode sees an awesome trio of Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Venom attempting to track down and destroy Carnage. Considering how powerful of a villain he is, it’s rather refreshing to see Venom, and more specifically Eddie Brock, get a redemptive storyline.\n\n#2: “Spider Wars” Parts 1 & 2\n\nFollowing the “Secret Wars” storyline, Madame Web again sends Spidey into another dimension. This time, New York City has been overrun by Spider-Carnage, the Green Goblin, and the Hobgoblin. This story arc is the perfect conclusion to the series, as Spidey is forced to use everything he has learned to overcome true evil and self-doubt. He teaches the audience a valuable lesson about being true to yourself and standing up for what’s right. It also features an awesome cameo by Stan Lee and the promise of a reunion with Mary Jane.\n\nBefore we unveil our number one pick, here are a few honorable mentions:\n\n“Framed”/ “The Man Without Fear”\n\n“Tablet of Time” / “Ravages of Time”\n\n“The Hobgoblin” Parts 1 & 2\n\n#1: “The Alien Costume” Parts 1, 2, & 3\n\nThis story arc had been building from the very first episode of the series, as we mentioned earlier. It features Spider-Man and his new black costume, having to overcome the alien symbiote that wreaking havoc on his own psyche. It also brings in Venom, one of the most iconic villains in all of Marvel. We see how powerful the symbiote is and how much it impacts both Peter and Eddie Brock. It is also very faithful to the comics, impressing even the most die-hard comic book fans. All in all, this remains one of the best adaptations of Venom to date."
