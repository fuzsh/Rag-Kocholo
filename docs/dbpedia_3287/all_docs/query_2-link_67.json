        "text": "Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse has yet to confirm its release date, but we do know that work is continuing on the eagerly-awaited movie.\n\nThe threequel was set to swing into cinemas in March 2024, but was taken off the Sony release schedule in July 2023.\n\nAfter a promising update in late March 2024 from Brian Tyree Henry, his co-star Karan Soni – who voices Pavitr Prabhakar, aka Spider-Man India – told in August 2024 that recording starts \"in a few months\".\n\n\"That movie is deep in production. It's animation, so it's different and takes a long time. We'll see when it's ready and when it ends up coming out, but I'm really excited,\" he added.\n\nTalking to Digital Spy in August 2023, Miller and fellow writer/producer Phil Lord gave an update on Beyond the Spider-Verse's release, saying it will be released \"when it is ready\".\n\nIt means we don't know when to expect the threequel, but at least Across the Spider-Verse is now available to buy digitally and also available to watch on Netflix US and Sky Cinema in the UK, so you could just endlessly rewatch that as we wait.\n\nFor now, the answers to the shocking ending of the sequel will have to wait. While we wait, here's everything you need to know about Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.\n\nBeyond the Spider-Verse potential release date: Will Beyond the Spider-Verse release in 2025?\n\nAs mentioned above, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse still doesn't have an official release date, as of August 2024.\n\nHow long could it be delayed? Well, it's now all-but confirmed that we won't see it in cinemas this year. Hopefully it could arrive in 2025, but we don't know exactly when.\n\nSony has an untitled Spider-Man movie scheduled for June 27, 2025, but it's currently earmarked for a live-action movie in association with Marvel Studios. It's probably too soon for Spider-Man 4, so that doesn't rule out a pivot to Beyond the Spider-Verse.\n\nThe threequel is bringing back the same creative team – directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K Thompson, and writers Lord, Miller and David Callaham.\n\nIf you need some new Spider-Verse content, then Sony released The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story on YouTube in March 2024.\n\nIt's a short movie set in the Spider-Verse world that sees Miles Morales experience a panic attack and learn that asking for help is as heroic as anything. Sure, it's not Beyond the Spider-Verse, but it's something.\n\nBeyond the Spider-Verse cast: Who's coming back for Beyond the Spider-Verse?\n\nThe cast for Beyond the Spider-Verse has yet to be confirmed, but we can make some solid guesses about who will be back.\n\nShameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld will return as Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, respectively. They'll likely be joined by Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara (Spider-Man 2099), Issa Rae as Jessica Drew (Spider-Woman) and Daniel Kaluuya as Hobie Brown (Spider-Punk).\n\nOther returns will include Jason Schwartzman as The Spot, Jake Johnson as Peter B Parker, Karan Soni as Pavitr Prabhakar (Spider-Man India) and, of course, Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Vélez as Miles' parents Jefferson Davis and Rio Morales.\n\nHowever, Johnson revealed in January 2024 that he's not sure if he is back for the next movie: \"I love Peter B Parker. I will say this: I would be so sad if I got a call that Peter B Parker is not returning to the Spider-Verse, because I feel really attached to that character.\"\n\nWe're about to head into some Across the Spider-Verse spoilers, so look away now if you haven't seen the movie.\n\nThe end of Across the Spider-Verse sees Gwen pull together her group of Spider-Men from across the multiverse, including Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham and Peni Parker from the first movie.\n\nHopefully, that means Nicolas Cage, John Mulaney and Kimiko Glenn will reprise their Spidey roles for the next movie.\n\nWe were already introduced to a lot more Spider-People in the sequel, including Andy Samberg's Ben Reilly (Scarlet Spider) and Amandla Stenberg's Margo Kess (Spider-Byte), but apparently, there's still more to come.\n\nFunnily enough, a plastic variant of Spider-Man was almost featured in the movie. Director Dos Santos told Empire: \"One of the Toy-Biz Spider-Man toys was going to show up and he was going to have a giant kid's hand that would go off-screen and hold him.\" The team ended up scrapping the idea to keep Miles' story \"cool, emotionally\".\n\nImagination has no limits in this saga. \"Believe it or not. You thought that you've seen every Spider-Person that you could imagine, but not every Spider-Person we can imagine,\" Lord teased to Collider.\n\nBring it on.\n\nBeyond the Spider-Verse plot: Will Beyond the Spider-Verse be the last one?\n\nRight now, we don't have an official plot synopsis for Beyond the Spider-Verse, but Across the Spider-Verse's ending sets up the next movie brilliantly.\n\nMiles is stuck in Earth-42 and at the mercy of that universe's Miles Morales, who is the Prowler. In that universe, his mother is going out with his Uncle Aaron and his father is dead.\n\nThat universe is one without a Spider-Man, as the spider that bit our Miles was transported to his universe (Earth-1610) by The Spot.\n\nLuckily, help might be on the way for Miles because, as mentioned above, Gwen now has her own Spidey team to go and rescue him – once they work out where he is.\n\nMiles needs to get back to his own universe, as The Spot is planning to kill his father when he becomes police captain. It's set to be a \"canon event\" in his timeline that Miles wants to stop, but Miguel wants to see it happen to protect the Spider-Verse.\n\nWe can expect Miles, Gwen and Co. versus Miguel, Jessica and the rest of the Spider Society to form the basis of Beyond the Spider-Verse with Miles trying to save his father. It's a battle that might even go to places we've never seen before.\n\n\"It means a lot of things, but it also means we see a sort of map representation of the known Spider-Verse, but there are things that can exist outside of that web of life and destiny, if you will,\" Miller told Collider of the title's meaning.\n\nLike the sequel introduced a different version of Miles, the threequel is set to feature at least one other version of Gwen Stacy. \"I would say that, yes. It's on the page. I think that... these things evolve as they go,\" Miller told the podcast.\n\nHe also teased that we might see the death of Gwen Stacy storyline from the comics play out with one of these versions: \"I'm not gonna say anything… But it is sort of plot-integral, I would say.\"\n\nBrian Tyree Henry has also been teasing the emotions of the new movie: \"Get your hankies ready, it's gonna go there.\"\n\nIn February 2024, Shameik Moore teased what we can expect from the new movie: \"You can expect Miles and Gwen. You can expect everything you're expecting [from] the continuation from the second one.\n\n\"You can expect to see The Spot. You can expect some action-packed energy and some dilemmas and problems to solve.\"\n\nPrepare yourself, though, as Beyond the Spider-Verse is almost definitely the end of Miles' story for now. It was referred to as \"the last of the Spider-Verse movies\" in an interview with Deadline in May 2024.\n\nBeyond the Spider-Verse trailer: Any Beyond the Spider-Verse footage yet?\n\nSadly, not yet, and with the delays, a Beyond the Spider-Verse trailer is even further away than it already was.\n\nWe got the first teaser for Across the Spider-Verse in December 2021 when it was due out in October 2022, and then the first trailer in December 2022 ahead of its June 2023 release."
