        "text": "EPISODE 01: World's Apart - Part 1:\n\nComics yellow box (I love those things): \"Solaris One launch site: Present Day, 2100 Hours...\" on a helicopter with a bit of shoddy animation for 3 seconds, then the animation moves smoothly to reveal a shuttle ready for launch.\n\nColonel John Jameson (the first we see of him in animation after his role in season 1 of the John Semper series) is ready to make a public speech, he's in suit.\n\nJohn Jameson: \"Six months ago, -through use of an advanced warp drive engine- the unmanned probe; Alita projected itself to the far side of the sun. There... Alita discovered an exact duplicate of our Earth, the Counter-Earth. Then as you know, Alita sent this troubling footage of its own demise. Due to Alita's destruction, many have questioned the wisdom of a manned trip to Counter-Earth. But this act of aggression demands an investigation\" (I'm not going to talk about the politics of it all, let's just know that this announced trip was a waste of money and a risk of a life)\n\nIn the crowd we hear someone proud of his son, you don't need to guess this is J. Jonah Jameson, and in this case both father and son are hot heads who rush to judgement.\n\nPeter Parker is standing beside his boss taking pictures.\n\n\"My boy is a hero. That boy is presidential temper.\" (must still avoid talking politics)\n\nJohn Jameson exits stage left, and spider-sense (yellow lights with some lines filling the screen, and frames turn blue sometimes, first sign this is not connected to the other Spider-Man cartoon of the decade), Parker goes away in turn.\n\nJonah is looking around to see where the lad went, and it looks like he mixed in with the crowd pretty fast to go invisible on him.\n\nPeter hides behind some wooden boxes to change into costume, and bits of the intro of the other cartoon plays (for some artistic reason, motivation to keep going with this show I suppose), and the spider-sense tingles again.\n\nSpider-Man sees two guys who look like builders in this area run toward the shuttle, doesn't seem much wrong besides \"What's up with those guys?\", until Spider-Man can see the two from a far distance to notice they are the symbiote parent and progeny (Venom and Carnage) as they transform and change colors, turning to clay and melting. (That change is visible give away from that distance, so I'll give it a pass, but the two symbiotes not being behind the portal from season 3 is another proof this show is disconnected, not to mention that two enemies who never liked each other since day one are allies out of the blue. That's a total of three things to tell this show is not connected to the other one)\n\nI guess Spider-Man can sense Carnage, so I guess I should give this a pass for the progeny symbiote not inheriting the ability to hide itself from the Spider-Sense.\n\nThe two symbiotes latch onto the shuttle's left solid rocket booster and climb up pretty fast. Spider-Man moves to climb the ship to pull the two off, and there is not angle above the back spider on his shirt (could work as another giveaway against the theory that this is connected to the show before it).\n\nAnd the intro plays, with brief glimpses of the origin of Spidey, and then a spoiler look on what we will see for most of the show.\n\nShuttle ignites, and goes up. (the noise doesn't scare the symbiotes off or hurt them while they're on the external surface of the shuttle, this is a poor thing to do, especially since you know their presence in the show will be nothing more than a waste of time and ink). Spider-Man moves up and successfully swings to latch onto the launching shuttle on time while it is still in range, and now Jonah Jameson has binoculars after not having any in the previous shot to celebrate watching the launch, and be annoyed by the interference of the webhead.\n\nSpider-Man swings and sticks, but he's not strong enough to not be pushed back by the force, yet he manages to stick again to save himself from being scorched by the rocket blast flames.\n\nCarnage goes to greet Spider-Man, Spider-Man sends a web ball to him to punch it away, and Venom grabs him from behinds. Melting away moves are new. Carnage talks about a synoptic that will never be properly explained, and confused Spider-Man raises his legs to pull Venom off the neck and toss them to Carnage (the other cartoon version can't move like this to attack for some reason), and Spider-Man fights them like he's still on the ground, not being pushed off the rocket by the force, air resistance, and gravity like he was before Carnage came to him.\n\nThe two merge, hide, and sneak behind him to hit him off the shuttle (what happened to Spider-Sense identifying Carnage?), and then they climb up like jello to reach the hatch, Venom decided to take full form to break the hatch for some reason after establishing they can pass through small creaks, and forgets that he probably cause oxygen to escape and let air run out of the ship fast. The orbiter splits and marches on.\n\nConcerned Spider-Man is falling, he forms a parachute and is upset that he couldn't save the poor astronaut.\n\nVenom sneaks into the cockpit and attacks John Jameson (no pilot, you can't reach your goal. Symbiotes didn't think it through), and Jonah Jameson on the ground is worried like he has a psychic link or something, there is not direct feed to the public in that area to notice in that crowd that gathered to witness the launch, and the shuttle entered the wormhole with no troubles.\n\nSpider-Man is landing close to the crowd, people are confused, Jonah blames him for sabotaging the shuttle (again, why?), and the military security on the base understandably run toward our hero and want to ask him questions after pointing their guns on him and telling him to surrender, he shoves them with his parachute and runs away to change back into Peter Parker.\n\nSpider-Man is upset that something goes wrong and everyone blames him (NOBODY HAD A WAY OF KNOWING. Except for watch room, they surely got the message of panic from the cockpit), and he compares the symbiotic duo to Vlad the Impaler.\n\nSix Minutes in and already this has enough troubles to drop the score down to a 6 out of 10. I wonder how long this trouble in quality will stick.\n\nAnother comic narration yellow box \"New York City: One Week Later\"\n\nSpider-Man is swinging high, the shot moves to a pinata doll suspended from a light-pole and pedestrians hit it with eggs. Spider-Man sees a car on a tree and pick it up to have an amusing shot of the angry cat grabbing Spider-Man's hand and biting it, he lands next to a lady that shoves him with pepper spray and pedestrians surround him, he jumps to a wall and goes away.\n\nCut to Jameson on TV offering 10 million dollars for any information on the identity of Spider-Man, or capturing him. The crowd walks away and Peter Parker is sulking.\n\n@UltimateWebhead This is a part you should enjoy analyzing and tearing apart:\n\nAs he's walking sad, an explosion happens out of the blue to a building, and it's on fire. There is a woman running on the roof she reached so fast soon as the explosion happened.\n\nOh well, immediate saving lives is more important than personal problems. He face trouble, but he saves her.\n\nFiremen (please don't bring any controversy here, or drag this word into one) reach the scene pretty fast, they water the fire only to push Spider-Man away by water and ignoring the flames that probably hold more people in danger, prioritizing risking the lives of many people in favor of stopping one person accused of murder of one person (Jonah had no reason to believe one happened, almost nobody had that). Fire crew are brilliant, YAH?\n\n\"You probably caused this fire\" says one fireman, while the crew continue ignoring the burning building they should prioritize, and a wall collapses almost falling on the man, Spider-Man pushes him out of harm way to be covered by the debris himself.\n\nThe fireman thinks his life was saved from Spider-Man by the collapsing building, ignoring the \"look out\" the poor victim of rushed judgement yelled at him. The fireman shows Spider-Man's torn mask the camera crew on the scene after the fire is doused by the collapsed building.\n\nFour hours later, Peter is at MJ's apartment door, a warm hug. He sleeps sitting on her couch and she's by his side, a TV news report wakes her up to the \"End of the troubled career of Spider-Man\", she sighs of relief and hopes so.\n\nPeter wakes up, he hears words on the news about his controversial masked life. He tells MJ he should probably live his own life, MJ encourages him to do that, to do good without wearing a mask.\n\nMJ goes to a room, Peter walks to the balcony, \"Maybe the fire did end Spider-Man last night\", and he hears the name John Jameson on the news, a message from the astronaut telling that there are dangerous creatures on Counter-Earth, their Earth might be next.\n\nNarration yellow box: \"Solaris Launch Center: Six Months Later\"\n\nAnnouncer: \"Solaris 2 rescue mission is ready for lift-off. T-Minus 2 hours and counting\"\n\nJonah Jameson pulled some strings and allowed Peter to walk into the facility, Peter sneaks somewhere to discretely put on the nano tech suit he discretely borrowed from Reed Richards (he stole it? Or secretly was handed the thing by Reed himself)..\n\nSpider-Man climbs to enter the shuttle, Nick Fury (him being alive is a secret in the other show, not really here). Simple gestures and not much exposition the other show is known for, and Fury allows Spider-Man to pilot the shuttle \"If anyone can do it, you can\" without any help (he can barely drive a car in comics, minus a few moments of exception, and we're expect him to be able to pilot a shuttle here? Something that in its own needs its own college degree? Get out of town).\n\nSpider-Man convinces the world he will go by announcing on the radio that he will fly the thing to clear his name, and uncovers his mouth to say his Peter Parker lines (No Peter NO. You don't want to have to cut a deal with Mephisto), not expecting people to tell the similarity between the voice of Peter and Spider-Man.\n\nHe flies up with no suits, no awareness of the atmosphere, probably hardly knows the directions he need to fly to without spending too much oil after the gas tanker is split, and he reaches the wormhole to be welcomed by a tractor beam real fast after he exits...\n\nHe tries to slow the descent of the ship, the heat of entry exhausts him, and the ship is held by four flying robots to slow its descent without crashing into buildings, but mostly crash lands on a roof.\n\nSpider-Man exists, he's summoned to go to the planets lord and conqueror, but he webs two of the four welcoming robots to kick them off roof, and punches a third one to swing away.\n\nSpidey swinging away saying \"Your friendly interplanetary Spider-Man\" attracts attention of four riders like the four horsemen, one of them commands the robots to halt from chasing Spider-Man cause he might be a bestial, and they chase him.\n\nA long chase happens, we get to see Spider-Man's suit in stealth action (and this mode heating up the suit), we get introduced to the four riders as beastials known as the Knights of Wundagore; Lord Tiger, Ursa, Lady Vermin, and Sir Ram. This city has flying cars, an upper fancy level for beastials and the low level slums for humans.\n\nSpider-Man is eventually captured and is taken to a lab to be spliced, and we get to see the face of this planets ruler known as the High Evolutionary.\n\n..................................................\n\nNot the best of starts, but it's not as bad as the first six minutes made me believe.\n\n3.5/5\n\nEPISODE 02: World's Apart - Part 2:\n\nComics yellow box: \"Present Time: Sir Ram's Lab...\"\n\nSpider-Man is tied to splicing chair, Ram has his buzz saw ready. High Evolutionary wants to examine him (cause in this world, he has no hand in turning the daughter of his friend to Spider-Woman)\n\nSpider-Man: \"Can we talk over tea and crumpets?\"\n\nHi E: \"Most perceptive Spider-Man, I am indeed not a native of this Earth\"\n\nHe's some guy who left Earth to get away from war, greed, and famine to find more of the same on this planet. All that pisses him off.\n\nOld man looks at the camera, he plans, it took him decades to do what he does while still not further aged, and he made animals he kidnapped anthropomorphic to serve him (this sentence has a lot of issues, they all do with this man's logic) to make this world better.\n\nBeastials accepted the experiments they suffered, the world is built stronger, a Zootopia before Zootopia, (even creatures with gills can breathe fine with a pair of lungs?) but instead of herbivores (plant eaters) bullying predators (ominvores and carnivores), they shun humans. One xenophobia replacing another.\n\nHi. E: \"You are different without me doing that, I did not torture you to make you this way, you are an abomination. Cut him Ram.\"\n\nRam: \"I'll cut you, that will prove you noble\"\n\nTiger: \"His actions were noble\"\n\nSpider-Man (inner monologue): \"These guys are nuts\" (and he breaks out of his shackles. The ULTIMATE proof this is not a continuation of the other show where Spider-Man can't even unlock a chain covering him (but he broke the jacket in the Mutant Agenda), this guy is much stronger)\n\nSpider-Man grabs the buzzsaw, pushes Ram away, punches the Vermin aside, breaks his foot shackles by punching them, jumps out of this place completely smashing the lab door, evades shots with ease, punches a heavy door bending it with one punch, tosses it with ease at three flying robots outside the complex pushing them away quite some distance before the blow up to save the three humans here to release him from captivity. (this guy is much stronger than TAS Spider-Man, their should be no denying now that these two worlds are no related)\n\nExplosives set and blown, they escape via flying pick car, the Knights of Wundagore are after them. Intro.\n\nKnights of Wundagor are accompanied by robots, they chase our gang as they're heading to their basement hideout. A robot is shot and flying behind, a truck driven by an ape man sees it coming front, he doesn't steer the wheel, and it hits the right side of the truck as it's heading forward on the aerial lane with no tracks.\n\nSpider-Man mid chase: \"When can I meet the Wizard and go back to Kansas?\"\n\nBromly: \"You did. Mr High Evolutionary\" (so they have the Wizard of Oz in that Earth too, Captain America can understand that reference too. Don't worry about him knowing the meeting with the Evolutionary Wizard, it will be explained later)\n\nSo High Evolutionary came here more than 5 decades ago (when he first released his mutates), him not aging further must be a result of him doing what Dr. Genus from Onepunch Man did to restore his youth and make his beasts.\n\nSome robots are broken, a wall has fallen, three knights are holding, and Lady Vermin is pursuing.\n\nThe pick up is on the ground, rebels walk and go underground, the Vermin is sliding, a call is going, their plan succeeding.\n\nLord Tiger wants in, his boss tells him be still, a new team will go in.\n\nInside the lair, Spider-Man is impressed, guns are trained on him, John Jameson order the spy to prove himself in their secret hideout. Brilliant plan there Johnny and co.\n\nIn a warehouse on a river, Venom and Carnage scare two security guards, they trap him inside the warehouse after the guards entered thinking they meet smugglers, Carnage takes two symbiote tadpoles to place them in their necks so they can be still, this is the start of the synoptic that took too long to happen or start being explained. So maybe they want to start their own Web of Shadows here.\n\nHigh Evolutionary ordered these two to capture Spider-Man (I want to know what happened after they reached Counter-Earth, like all the details), and they want to betray their new ruler.\n\nJohn: \"Let's see you really are Spider-Man, dodge this bullet\"\n\nSpider-Man dodges, and: \"You're a jerk, just like your father\"\n\nJohn: \"Who takes your photos?\" (he told you how annoying your dad is, and this is not enough to make sure? What does High Evolutionary know about you?)\n\nSpider-Man: \"Peter Parker\"\n\nJohn: \"Welcome. I had to make sure\"\n\nMindless Synoptic forces are the new High Evolutionary special team, entering from the roof of a secret base with secret doors the Knights only found one of.\n\nA fight between rebels and synopticoids, Lady Vermin is in the fight, she jumps Jameson to be pulled off by Spider-Man, and jumps the latter and gives him a kiss.\n\nVenom and Carnage are in the lair now, they join the battle against rebels, Spider-Man activates the sonics in his new suit and all symbiotes are flushed out of the lair, including the things with the synopticoids (I made up that useless name just now), hosts are unconscious and caged.\n\nJohn Jameson wants to kill their captive, Spider-Man talks him out of it by saying \"The true threats know this lair and they got away, these beastials are innocent\". John agrees, Bromly's wants to kill them anyway, but he holds back after receiving an order against that.\n\nOn a roof, John, Spidey, and girl rebellion talk about tags and Spidey not having one, so he can't be traced. A fight against oppression needs to happen while John is here so he can't go back, and besides, both ships are out of their reach cause one burned and the other is out of commission.\n\nKaren gave Spider-Man a duffel with clothes that fit him so he can move inconspicuously and see things up close to know why they want him in, he takes it and swings away.\n\nYellow Box: \"Two Days Later: The Basement...\" (I thought that was the name of the rebels lair)\n\nA robot man passes by as children play ball, a vehicle hits it and it malfunctions, considered a child a threat, almost shot it with laser. Peter passed by and saved the kid, broke the robot, burnt his hands. The kid's mom is a doctor, she offered to treat his wounds and give him an empty room rent free for two weeks.\n\n..................................................\n\nA reasonably fine follow up to the inferior first part.\n\n4.5/5\n\nI had some comments on it, but they're not all that negative, more jokes and nitpicks than complaints and criticism.\n\nEPISODE 03: Where Evil Nests:\n\n\"The Basement...\"\n\nA guy is crouching and asleep, he is awakened by some noise and a sewer lid (manhole cover) being removed fast and aggressively. He looks through steam to see green tentacles moving, the sight scares him, tentacles grab him. His cape is loose, and he goes underground, taken by force.\n\nIt's been more than two weeks since the end of episode 2, Naoko is annoyed that Peter still can't afford her rent (isn't this the story of his life?), he shows her an offer in the Daily Byte for a reward for pictures of Spider-Man, her response is chances of him showing up are like the lottery, you're nuts if you ever expect to hit the jackpot (I quoted Spider-Man from the other show, I like this quote).\n\nShane sees this fight, he's not pleased. Little man runs away, and his mother goes for him. Parker doesn't like being this moocher, and he likes the idea of two people going out alone in the middle of the night in such dangerous place even less, he follows.\n\nThe doctor is walking down the streets, using her tracking device to find her son, green tentacles are following her. Something is following, the green slime moving under rain draining holes, the doctor calls her boy and a manhole cover is lifted up, poo gas follows, green tentacles go up and grab the doctor.\n\nThe boy is a witness, his mom is struggling. Shane is scared, his mom is resisting, she tells him to leave, and comes across Peter.\n\nAnd tell him about his mother being kidnapped so we can see the intro.\n\nBack in her apartment, Peter tells Shane to stay and lock all doors as he tries to find his mom. Turn around the corner and he switches to Spidey, swings up high to talk about slime, then swings until he reaches a lightpole to mention green slime.\n\nSpider-Sense is ringing, pumpkin bomb is swinging. A new Goblin is here to take down the spider, believing him connected to the symbiotes.\n\n(And the two characters are voiced by the same guy, can you tell which character is who when you listen to their lines without context?)\n\nThe Goblin chases Spider-Man, he wants to get him, the spider insignia made him believe Spidey is connected to the symbiotes (been over two weeks since Spidey came, almost seven months since the first shuttle came through, not hard to believe the Goblin knows about those, and them being elusive) and he attacks Spider-Man until he gasses him and Spidey plays possum to get to him. The two come to an agreement once 6 robot men come to enforce the law against vigilantism.\n\nCut back to Shane. A long time has passed for this little man, and he didn't give Peter the tracer to find her (lucky for Pete, with the Goblin on his back), and decides to go out to find his mom.\n\nIn the labyrinth of the sewers, it seems like dragging for long and over exposure to poo gas took their toll in exhausting the doctor, she did have enough strength left to grab on a metal pipe and climb up, but the green tentacles won't leave this be, it follows her and breaks the metal pipes after she climbed up, and she ran until she bumped into a synopticoid rhino that grabbed and carried her.\n\nBack to the Goblin and the Spider, they did not start fighting off-screen while we checked on the doc for one scene, Goblin admits he was wrong about Spider-Man, Spider-Man still doesn't trust him. They fight the robots, Spider-Man jumps on and punches one pushing it a distance behind, and grabs it to toss it at three of its (walking, though they can fly ) pals (the other show Spidey is not strong enough to do this).\n\nGoblin did none of the fighting against the robots, he just tagged along with Spider-Man as he did, and they reached a cage fence when Spider-Man webbed up a shield for both him and the Goblin to hide behind (I think the green guy ran out of bombs tossing them at Spider-Man).\n\nSpider-Man hears a kid calling his mom, looks behind to see Shane is that kid. The Goblin is worried about the boy and almost gets in range of fire, Spider-Man pulls the ally he's reluctant to be with and warns him \"He'll be flash fried. An idea sparks in the Goblin's head.\n\nShane looks at the manhole cover, three machine men behind him, he climbs down the stares.\n\nGoblin tosses a skull shaped bomb on their assailants and warns his reluctant ally to cover his eyes, the bomb goes off and burns their optic censors, robots blast blindly away.\n\nGoblin: \"We're safe now\"\n\nAll the blindly shot laser breaks walls of the alley down on the robots and the two humans get out of the way.\n\nSpider-Man: \"Interesting definition of safe\"\n\nGoblin: \"Where's Shane?\"\n\nSpidey: \"He went down the sewers\"\n\n*By the manhole cover\n\nGoblin: \"Then that's where I'll go\"\n\nSpider-Man: \"Not alone you won't. I still trust you as far as I can throw you one handed Goblin\" (I still have no idea how they measure tossing with trust)\n\nDown the sewers they walk, the green slime tentacles follow, Spider-Sense notifies and Goblin picks Spidey up and flies. That makes Spider-Man reconsider not trusting his new ally.\n\nTentacles reach up and high, and grab the Goblin of his foot, Gobby tosses Spidey away, into another hole they're not going up through.\n\nItsy bitsy Spidey, went down the sewer drain.\n\n\"Deep Beneath the City...\"\n\nSynoptic is upgraded after last episode, looks like a smaller version of face huggers that grabs the chest and does the Starro thing of mind control instead of it going under the skin.\n\nDoctor Jones is famous, at least that's what Venom said. They're underground in what looks like a beehive... mine... merger. Doctor Jones thought these tunnels were destroyed, Carnage wanted people to believe that while they secretly build their new world order away from the control of the High Evolutionary, or any other party.\n\nSymbiotes first arrived on this Earth when dinosaurs were still roaming, they took control since then for millions of years, until the meteor that killed the dinosaurs (no ice age pun, and before we were told dinosaurs are birds now), and the yellow symbiote lobsters merged together to form a hive mind... waiting for two symbiotes normally against each other... from an alternate Earth... to come and liberate them... (this makes any sense to you? No? Me neither.)\n\nThe doctor is about to become a part of the family, that's not cool.\n\nLet's cut back to the kid in the sewers who found an unconscious Spider-Man who had no reason to be unconscious when tossed into the tunnel by the Goblin, and learns the story of Spider-Man being friends with Peter Parker.\n\nThe Goblin took his pants off to finally release himself of the green mucus symbiote, and his normal legs are green.\n\nDoctor N is not about to be part of the family, Spider-Man shoots the thing crawling up her chest with a dart, Venom and Carnage head up to attack him, and he swings away. The two approach him again and he activates his suit's sonics... and green mucus symbiote is too much, sonics are overworked and they deactivate, slime attacks.\n\nSpider-Man picks the Goblin family (oops, spoiler) and moves high to place them on a safety net, Shane's father comes in with a pumpkin bomb to help Spidey, and then he gets his wife and son away as he flies. Spidey has a plan.\n\nHostages not infected by synoptic are freed, the rest may not be as lucky. Spider-Man breaks the two looooong support columns of this place as the two maniacs climb it up, and he jumps away, leaping on debris.\n\nGoblin comes back and takes the spider out.\n\nGoblin is talking to his family, Naoko tells the Goblin to send a message to Spider-Man about rent. She and her son walk home, and the Goblin got away.\n\nSpidey is taking selfies for the money reward, his new boss treats him like Jonah Jameson, episode ends.\n\n..................................................\n\nThings were going really good until the prehistoric symbiote thing got in the way. It drops the quality down to fairly good.\n\n4/5, and I'm feeling a bit generous.\n\nEPISODE 04: Deadly Choices:\n\nOne of the rebels is bandages with hair, a jacket, and goggles. He showed his ability to split to bandages when synopticoids and Lady Vermin invaded their lair in episode 2.\n\nThis episode focuses on him, a guy named Git Hoskins.\n\n10 years ago, a bunch of human kids in the streets were garnishing a Christmas tree, one of them was in charge of placing the star on top of it, and wind blew that paper piece away until it landed in an alley around a corner (after a straight line?). Git saw Sir Ram and gave him candy, the humanoid did not care so he tossed the sugary thing away and took the kid with him.\n\nCut to the present, Git is chased by his abductor and a bunch of robot men on the street for stealing a mutagen called Z-99 (if you watched Spider-Man & His Amazing Friends as many times as I did you'll find this name familiar, and one of the episode writers is the writer of the episode this reminds me of).\n\nPeter Parker is told by his boss the pictures he's getting of Spider-Man are not enough, he needs to get more than Spider-Man swinging, something up close, up personal, like his girlfriend. The boss is told to look out his window for us to see it 4 floors above the basement level (and it was much higher last episode). Parker goes out to take pictures of the event, and he goes there as Spider-Man.\n\nSpidey runs out of webs, Git saves him from one robot and hide the canister in his belly, he runs away chased by lasers from the Knights of Wundagore (minus Lord Tiger), the trio halt their important chase to have a \"friendly\" chat with Spidey.\n\nGit stole a mutagen that can be airborne and contagious Knights of Wundagor leave this pleasantry behind to continue their hunt, and a spider-tracer is attached to one of their flying jetskis. Spidey heads home for more web fluid.\n\nNaoko got a call from her husband talking, expressing his disapproval of having another man as a tenant, she's not pleased and shots the phone.\n\nDoor bell rings, Jameson is here, Peter helps her place him on a bed and gets away from allowing Jameson to see him, he doesn't want to explain why he's here.\n\nPeter in his room switches suits, inserts a spare cartridge in a fancy way, and leaves out the window.\n\nSpidey meets with rebels Karen and Bromly, the canister contains explosives triggered as soon as they leave the lab, there are two hours from now before it triggers, and they were supposed to be meeting Git in the spot Spidey came across them to hear this stuff.\n\nSpidey suggested working with the enemy, Bromly is shocked.\n\nLater above Grid Seven, Spider-Man and a bunch of rebels meet the Knights of Wundagore sans Lord Tiger, the knights fire, rebels get away to fire back as they're being chased, Spider-Man webs the guns in the knights flying jet skis and it is now laser proof (oookaaaayyyyy).\n\nCease fire, all listen. Deal is done, begrudgingly.\n\nThey all go to the secret meeting site, rat lady can now smell out of the blue.\n\nArgument... agreement... a second secret meeting place revealed.\n\nGit has a flashback, human kids are so cruel in this world, they see a peer walking all bandaged up and they toss him with stones.\n\nHow does a genetic mutation turn one to bandages? Kid turns to bandages and move through a small hole as kids chase him to the alley to shove him with more stones.\n\nThey reach the second meeting place, Git thinks his pals are traitors.\n\nBombs away, get away.\n\nUrsa grabs, Git slides.\n\nSpidey got the canister and Gits swings to get it back.\n\nBlow up a building.\n\nOthers dodge debris.\n\nCars are now wreckage.\n\nThey're ripe for the picking.\n\nSpidey goes after Git while the rest remove the rubble, bandage man climbs up a fire escape to be chased and webbed, Spidey picks the canister...\n\nSome stuff happen, it ends with Git changing heart for not wanting to poison the city and hands the bomb for Ram to deactivate.\n\nSpidey photos himself getting a kiss from rat lady. The money earned from these pictures is reasons to invite Naoko and Shane to Jimmy's diner. Silhouette of unmasked Green Goblin is upset and breaks a wall with his fist, ending the episode.\n\n..................................................\n\n4/5\n\nMinus the first episode, this show is having a pretty good streak thus far, there is still some goofiness in storytelling like the knights staying still while Spider-Man talks earlier, but it's fine. I guess you should expect some quality when one of the writers of Batman the Animated Series is more heavily involved in writing and production.\n\nOh wait, I think I forgot mentioning Carnage stealing the canister from the lab knowing exactly where to break, what spot to break, and what angle to break through to inconspicuously steal this necessary ingredient in... that thing he's cooking in an underground swamp."
