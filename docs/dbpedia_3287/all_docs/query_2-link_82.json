        "text": "SDCC served as the stage for Marvel Comics to reveal the next wave of stories and upcoming series. During the Next Big Thing Panel, Editor-in-Chief C.B. Cebulski, along with a roster of Marvel creators, unveiled an array of new titles, teased future storylines, and premiered trailers for upcoming series. Among the highlights were the announcements of “ONE WORLD UNDER DOOM,” “VENOM WAR,” and “WOLVERINE: REVENGE.”\n\nNew Series Announcements\n\nOne of the most exciting revelations among fans in the panel was the return of the “WEST COAST AVENGERS.” This November, writer Gerry Duggan and artist Danny Kim will bring back this iconic team with a superstar lineup, including a seemingly redeemed Ultron. As Iron Man and War Machine assemble a new team of Avengers, doubts linger among members like Spider-Woman and Firestar about Ultron’s true intentions. Can the once-notorious villain truly walk the path of redemption?\n\nIn December, Marvel will release “ULTIMATE UNIVERSE: ONE YEAR IN,” a special one-shot finale marking the end of the first year of the new Ultimate line. Written by Deniz Camp, this oversized issue will set the stage for the second year, introducing Ultimate versions of major Marvel characters and chronicling the heroes’ struggle against the Maker’s villainous council.\n\nSpooky and Fun Adventures\n\nMarvel Unlimited subscribers have even more to look forward to with the launch of two new Infinity Comics. “BEASTLY BUDDIES,” a spooky series debuting in October, stars Elsa Bloodstone, Man-Thing, Werewolf by Night, and other horror favorites. Written by Steve Foxe with art by Armand Bodnar, the series promises a comedic twist on Marvel’s darker characters as they navigate modern-day challenges.\n\nFans of the adorable yet fierce can dive into “DOGPOOL,” now available on Marvel Unlimited. Created by Mackenzie Cadenhead with art by Enid Balám, this series introduces Dogpool, Catpool, and Mousepool, adding a playful and chaotic twist to the Marvel Universe.\n\nSpider-Man’s New Challenges\n\nNovember will also mark the beginning of “8 DEATHS OF SPIDER-MAN,” a bold new saga in “AMAZING SPIDER-MAN” by Joe Kelly and Ed McGuinness. In a world where Doctor Doom has become the Sorcerer Supreme, Spider-Man faces a daunting task. Equipped with a new magic-powered suit and eight extra lives, Spider-Man must save the world from an evil god and his scions—a challenge that even eight lives might not be enough to overcome.\n\nAlso Check Out: Absolute Batman Preview With Nick Dragotta and Scott Snyder – SDCC 2024: The Comic Source\n\nAs always, Marvel’s announcements at San Diego Comic-Con have left fans buzzing with anticipation. With new series, exciting storylines, and innovative concepts, the Marvel Universe continues to evolve and captivate audiences.
