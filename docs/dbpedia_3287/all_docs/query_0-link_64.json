Hijacking a space shuttle to help up John Jameson against Venom and Carnage, Spider-Man ends up stuck on Counter-Earth, an Earth like planet in the same orbit on other side of the sun. There he finds a high tech society where humanoid animals, the beastials, rule under the leadership of the High Evolutionary, while humans are seen as second class citizens.\r\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough, Venom and Carnage are about, having their minds set on golbal domintation through the help of  the Synoptic - a hivemind producing spores that turn people into it's mindless slaves.\r\n\r\nCanceled/Ended\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that this series ended on a cliffhanger and no more episodes have been put into production. There were six episodes that were produced for the second season, but were never aired. \r\n\r\nDestiny Unleashed\r\n\r\nThis saga was never completed, nor will it ever be. It is seen in the episode guide as Destiny Unleashed (1) because it was planned to finish it before it was canceled. \r\n\r\n\r\nDVD/ VHS Release\r\n\r\nThere are currently no plans for a DVD release.",
