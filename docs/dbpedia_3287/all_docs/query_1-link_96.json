After \"borrowing\" a suit made of nano-machines, Spider-Man goes to Counter-Earth to rescue Jameson and clear his name.\n\nUpon getting to Counter-Earth, Spider-Man discovers that the High Evolutionary has made himself at home and created Beast Men that run the planet and normal humans are treated like second class citizens. Along the way, he discovers that John Jameson is alive and well, leading a rebellion against the High Evolutionary; that Venom and Carnage came to the planet with the intend to conquer it; and that the planet does have some vastly different versions of his old foes.\n\nGenerally, the series isn't held in high regards compared to other Spider-Man series as it viewed as putting Spider-Man in a situation that's un-Spider-Man-like, like putting him on another world. However, it has gained a cult following due to the same reasons, and it is currently being shown on Disney XD.\n\nWas released on DVD in UK in 2010.\n\nTropes used in Spider-Man Unlimited include:"
