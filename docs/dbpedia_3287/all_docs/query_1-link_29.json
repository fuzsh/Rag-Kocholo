        "text": "It's such a cool art style on this show. I loved the new suit and intro. Rino Romano is an awesome Spider-Man. I could never really get into the Counter Earth plot though. Not for an entire series. I've seen the same thing happen with comic book series that I've been into before but for some reason whenever the High Evolutionary and the Knights of Wundagore come around, my interests drops like a lead balloon. I did like some of the side characters and some of the new takes on old villains but as a whole, the show wasn't my cup of tea.\n\nI think the overall timing was bad for me too. Fox Kids had a lineup that was collectively doing nothing for me at the time, and I think that also helped to color my view of some of the series of the time negatively.\n\nI definitely would have loved getting a Spider-Man 2099 show...\n\nAt the time, I never had the chance to really read up much on the comic series but it did intrigue me. At first I thought that's what the show was going to be based on probably up until I watched the first couple of episodes and realized it was something much different. It would have been insane if a 2099 series and Batman Beyond were airing concurrently.\n\nSent from my SM-G975U using Tapatalk\n\nIt's such a cool art style on this show.

The show had a big case of trying to have its cake and eat it too, with both putting Spider-Man in a very atypical situation for the character and still doing all the classic \"Peter trying to have a normal life, while being Spider-Man\" stuff, but that just didn't work or make any narrative sense when the premise is \"Spider-Man stuck on an alien planet, trying to overthrow its evil dictator.\" They really should have embraced their wacky sci-fi plot and fully committed to it.\n\nThe other major blow to the show was how the above-mentioned premise just screams for a serilialized story, but the show went with episodic \"villain/conflict of the week\" formula. The show had 13 episodes and the story only moves forward in the pilot and finale.\n\nBut, even if both of these fundamental flaws didn't exist, the show might have been too out there for Spider-Man no matter what. It could have been better show on its own right, but the fanbase might have still rejected it."
