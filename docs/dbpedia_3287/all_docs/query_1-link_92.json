        "text": "Talk to any of your friends with Netflix Instant Streaming and they will give you 3-4 movies and a couple of TV shows they have burned through and will say “You just HAVE to watch it it’s great!” And if you are like me, you know a good group of people who you value their opinion, and when they tell you you must watch House of Cards, you do it without asking questions.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a bunch of garbage shows or movies that can easily clutter your homepage and distract you from getting to what you want to, or “MUST!”, watch. And there aren’t enough people telling you what is worth watching. Here’s a suggestion of what you can avoid wasting your time with.\n\nSpider-Man Unlimited\n\nAiring all 13 episodes, Netflix brings us the first and only season of Spider-Man Unlimited. Running from 1999-2000, Spider-Man Unlimited opens with astronaut John Jameson headed to another planet scientists have discovered called Counter-Earth. Joining his ship, however, are Spider-Man’s enemies Venom and Carnage, who have jumped on and are plotting to take over Counter Earth, all while Spider-Man is being blamed for communication being cutoff between Earth and Jameson. When an emergency broadcast from Jameson comes back to earth, our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man commandeers a second space ship to go bring back Jameson and clear his name. Bringing along a new, more-advanced suit, Peter Parker must go to a strange world and come back safely, while leaving behind Aunt May and MJ.\n\nWhy you Should Avoid It\n\n1) Lack of an Ending\n\nGetting axed by the network because it couldn’t put up numbers on level with Pokémon and the newly released Digimon, it aired later with all 13 episodes, the last episode ending on a giant cliffhanger. Which is never resolved…\n\nMany scripts were written for a second season to follow-up this edition of the web-slinger, but none were ever made and so, we are left with an ending that could piss off enough kids to bring them back for a following season. If you are looking to deeply invest your time in this, don’t expect a return of satisfaction.\n\n2) Spidey’s New Suit\n\nAmidst his dash to outer-space, Spider-Man talks about his new suit, which just happens to be able to counteract the symbiotes, Venom and Carnage. Also, Spidey adds GPS tracking chips and a few other gadgets to his arsenal that he can fire against his enemies. While the suit looks like a cool re-imagining of our famed wall-crawler, I don’t think I’m ready to accept the fact he just happens to have this suit on hand and doesn’t use it until now. Why wouldn’t he utilize a suit that can make him invisible and other things ON EARTH?\n\nBut this plot point of the series only stems from the show’s lack of rights to use the original suit because of the Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man movie coming out in 2002. The suit wasn’t the only thing, however, that was limited by the film…\n\n3) The Enemies\n\nAlso, because of the film, Spider-Man was forced to face villains that weren’t from around the block. Despite the Green Goblin and the Vulture showing up (who look the exact same aside of color), they are actually heroes in this Counter-Earth, helping the human race. Spider-Man’s biggest enemies include the High Evolutionary (the man who created Counter Earth), the Knights of Wundagore (animal-like humans from the beastial race, second in command to the HE), the line up of robots made by those in power, and of course Venom and Carnage.\n\nVenom and Carnage are on their own mission throughout the entire process and rarely interfere with the web-slinger and the group of rebel humans he is involved with. In this series, they also have the ability to liquify as though they don’t have human hosts. As for the High Evolutionary, we don’t really see him in person for some time, let alone see his powers used or at work. In most episodes, it is just Spider-man versus the beasital Knights of Wundagore and their robot police force. All of which is lackluster…\n\nSummary\n\nIf you are looking to be nostalgic at all, instead of wasting your time with this half-hearted mess, watch Spider-Man: The Animated Series which originally aired 1994-1998 and was leaps and bounds better of a show in terms of story and characters. After muscling through all 13 episodes of this faint childhood memory, this is definitely something not worthy of your attention, even if you enjoyed it as a child.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Did you watch this as a kid and think otherwise? Or do you agree this is something better left to your past? Let me know in the comments section below!"
