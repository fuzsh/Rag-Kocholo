        "text": "The Definitive X-Men Reading Order (that’s also easy to follow!)\n\nI’ve been an X-Men fan for over 30 years, but I’ve never found a perfect reading order for X-Men comic books – so I decided to build one myself!\n\nI examined every X-Men title, issue, and major appearance published in their first 50 years and organized them into a single X-Men reading order.\n\nMy approach is a little different than other guides. I’ve tried to examine the X-Men’s entire history one story at a time – so you can read without switching comics mid-story. I don’t think inserting single issues between one another or even switching mid-issue makes for an ideal reading experience.\n\nThis X-Men reading order takes advantage of the breaks in stories created by Marvel’s collected editions wherever possible and was built by referencing release dates, chronology guides, and Marvel’s own Official Indexes.\n\nThe result? An easy-to-follow guide that threads all X-Men titles together like one massive crossover.\n\nIs a comprehensive X-Men reading order more than you were looking for? For a trade reading order guide to any single X-Men title, like Uncanny X-Men or Wolverine, head to the Crushing Comics – Guide to Marvel Comics!\n\nOr, try Instant X-Pert, which only include stories that were the highlights of the first 50 years of X-Men comics leading up to Avengers vs. X-Men.\n\nHow does the X-Men reading order work?\n\nClick one of the Eras below based on the period you’re interested in or the dates your comics were originally released.\n\nIf you’re not sure where to start, each X-Men reading order era begins with a list of all the ongoing series released in that time period. Each era breaks down the primary X-Men narrative (usually contained in Uncanny X-Men) into digestible chunks divided by major storylines like “The Dark Phoenix Saga” and “Avengers vs. X-Men.”\n\nI am constantly updating these eras with notes from my own re-reading as well as improvements from commenters and patrons!\n\nPatreons make this page possible! Every month, Patrons of Crushing Krisis help to fund its hosting, helper applications, video production, and more! Every dollar contributed by Patrons goes directly to helping sustain and grow this site.\n\nThe Eras of X-Men\n\nEra #0: Before X-Men\n\nStories occurring prior or parallel to X-Men #1 in September 1963 – as well as “Origins” and “Before the X-Men” types of series.\n\nEra #1: Original X-Men\n\nStories from X-Men #1 in September 1963 through (but not including) Giant-Size X-Men #1 in May 1975\n\nEra #2: Second Genesis\n\nGiant-Size X-Men #1 in May 1975 to Uncanny X-Men #140 in December 1981\n\nEra #3: New Mutants\n\nUncanny X-Men #141 in January 1981 to Uncanny X-Men #198 in October 1985\n\nEra #4: X-Factor\n\nUncanny X-Men #199 in November 1985 to Uncanny X-Men #243 in April 1989\n\nEra #5: X-Tinction\n\nUncanny X-Men #244 in May 1989 to Uncanny X-Men #280 in September 1981\n\nEra #6: Fatal Attractions\n\nUncanny X-Men #281 & X-Men, Vol. 2 #1 in October 1991 to Uncanny X-Men #307 in December 1993\n\nEra #7: Onslaught\n\nUncanny X-Men #308 in January 1994 to Uncanny X-Men #337 in October 1996.\n\nEra #8: Reassembled\n\nUncanny X-Men #338 in November 1996 to Uncanny X-Men #365 February 1999.\n\nEra #9: Revolution\n\nUncanny X-Men #362 in December 1998 to Uncanny X-Men #393 in June 2001.\n\nEra #10: New X-Men\n\nUncanny X-Men #394 and New X-Men #114 in July 2001 to Uncanny X-Men #443 in June 2004.\n\nEra #11: The New Age\n\nUncanny X-Men #444 in July 2004 to Uncanny X-Men #465 in December 2005.
