We were eventuallty told that fox had cancelled this show in 2001 due to poor viewership and because of the popular shows like Pokemon and Digimon overshadowing this show, don't get me wrong, there were many good animated spiderman shows that were BETTER than this, but we spiderman fans really do crave an ending.\n\n*Apparenty, according to my friend, season 2 had a script completed.\n\nSo support us and let's reach DISNEY!!\n\n*In Australia, Foxtel channel, Disney XD - 705, correct me if im wrong with the channel number, Spider-Man unlimited is airing episodes sometimes MEANING that Disney has the rights to this show.\n\n- Jack and Junior"
