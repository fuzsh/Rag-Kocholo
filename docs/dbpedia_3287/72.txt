Thirteen episodes doesn't quite scream "unlimited", but it's still a pretty cool title. Developed by Avi Arad and Will Meugniot, and directed by Patrick Archibald, Spider-Man Unlimited in the short-run animated series by Saban Entertainment, featuring the Marvel comic book character Spider-Man. Luke and Nathan revisit this single season series that ran from 1999 to 2001 which had the challenge of following on from the 1994 Spider-Man series. Spider-Man travels to Counter-Earth to rescue a Terran shuttle crew trapped there and discovers a tyrannical and warped version of his world.
