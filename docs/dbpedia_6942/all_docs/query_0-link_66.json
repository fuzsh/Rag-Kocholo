        "text": "The Frankish emerged as part of the Germanic tribes who dominated the former Roman province of Gaul after the decline of Roman power in Gaul.\n\nBy the 8th century, Frankish King Charlemagne had conquered territories spanning modern-day Germany, France, and Italy among others.\n\nCharlemagne was crowned Emperor and with him, the Holy Roman Empire began.\n\nAlthough the Empire nearly disintegrated in the 9th century, it was effectively re-consolidated in the 10th century under Otto I.\n\nHoly Roman Empire | High Medieval Period\n\nFrom the days of Charlemagne, Papacy had played an important role in granting legitimacy to Holy Roman Emperors.\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages, this resulted in a contest between the Emperors and the Papacy, culminating in King Henry IV’s tussle with the Papacy which resulted in his surrender to Papal authority.\n\nDuring the same period, German princes of different territories also emerged as major power brokers in the affairs of the Empire, leading to the establishment of their votes in affairs as important as the election of the King.\n\nReformation Period\n\nThe Reformation period in the 15th century came with major changes to the political dynamics of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIt was during the reign of Charles V in the first half of the 15th century that the Spanish territories were consolidated under a single crown for the first time.\n\nIt also marked a rift between the Kings of Germany and Spain. Germany was further distanced from Spain by the launch of the Protestant movement by Martin Luther in 1517.\n\nA major part of the German territories in the north and the east soon embraced Protestantism while those in the south and west remained Catholic.\n\nPolitical Structure of the Empire\n\nThe political structure of the Holy Roman Empire was unique in that although it had an Emperor during most of its history, it was highly decentralised and comprised of a vast number of individual political entities.\n\nAlthough the supreme power was vested in the Emperor, the individual political entities were effectively ruled by different princes, dukes, counts, bishops, and abbots.\n\nCalled princes, some of these individual rulers in time came to be powerful enough to have a say in important matters of the Empire and even in the election of the Emperor.\n\nElection of the Emperor\n\nThe most powerful dukes and bishops were involved in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor. By the 14th century, this process had been formalised and the power of election was limited to the hands of seven princes.\n\nThese included the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the King of Bohemia, the archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, and Trier, the Duke of Saxony, and the Margrave of Brandenburg.\n\nBy the 17th century, the Duke of Bavaria was added to this list. Any new Emperor needed the vote of all these German princes in order to secure his seat on the throne and this was usually done through offers of lands and money to these electors.\n\nEven after his election by the princes, the new King or Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope to finally establish himself as the ruler of the Empire.\n\nThe Imperial Diet\n\nThe Imperial Diet made most of the important legislative decisions for the Empire. It was a sort of assembly divided into three classes.\n\nThe Council of Electors was the most powerful class of the Diet, comprising of the elector princes who voted for the King. The Council of Princes comprised the other princes of different territories throughout the Empire.\n\nThe Council of Imperial Cities was the least powerful class and was the last to be added to the Diet, formally recognised only in the 17th century. The Imperial Cities had little say in the most vital decisions of the Empire.\n\nThe Decline of the Empire\n\nAfter the 15th century Reformation, the Empire saw its German territories largely accept the Protestant faith which put them at odds with the rest of the Catholic territories of the Empire.\n\nAfter failing to suppress Protestantism, the imperial power in the Empire continued to erode until the Thirty Years’ War in the early 17th century. These wars, involving most of Europe, led to the complete independence of many of the Empire’s territories.\n\nThe Fall of the Empire\n\nAlthough the Empire had grown immensely weak following the Thirty Years’ War, it was still able to defeat the Ottomans in the decisive Battle of Vienna.\n\nHowever, the Empire was left intact mostly in name alone and mostly comprised of individual territories and a small area directly under the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThe decisive end came with a military defeat of the Empire at the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806.\n\nHoly Roman Empire Summary\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was a major political entity established at the beginning of the Middle Ages and spanning many areas of Central Europe. The foundations of the Empire were laid by the Germanic tribes of the Roman province of Gaul.\n\nLed by the Frankish rulers, the tribes forged a Frankish Empire which soon gave way to the Holy Roman Empire under Otto I in the 10th century.\n\nThe Empire became one of the most powerful in Europe with the sanction of the Pope and a huge number of territories under its control.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of the Empire was its decentralised political structure, with the individual princes of different regions having significant say in the election of the Emperor and in other matters of the Empire.\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the decline of the Empire began and it finally came to an end in the early 19th century."
