        "text": "Tom Holland welcomes a definitive study of the amorphous state that lasted a thousand years\n\nIn 929, one of Alfred the Great’s numerous granddaughters travelled to Saxony. Edith was the half-sister of Æthelstan who, only two years previously, had won for himself the rule of all the English-speaking peoples of Britain, and thereby attracted the admiration of the most eligible bachelor in Christendom: Otto.\n\nFearless, charismatic and intimidatingly hairy, Otto was as peerless a warrior as he was formidable an overlord, heir to a vast agglomeration of territories that stretched from Frisia to Bavaria. After becoming king in 936, he won a victory over a vast invading force of Hungarians so decisive that his troops, standing on the battlefield amid the tangle of corpses and banners, hailed him “emperor”. Sure enough, within seven years he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope in Rome. It was, for any Christian king, the ultimate promotion.\n\nThe union of Edith and Otto brought together two realms destined for very different things. The history of England, the kingdom founded by Æthelstan, is familiar. A unitary state since the 10th century, its borders have effectively been unchanged since the 11th. The story of the nation can be told without the historian having to expend vast amounts of energy attempting to define what England is.\n\nIt was “neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire,” Voltaire quipped. His joke hints at the immense challenge faced by anyone attempting to write its history. Although the Holy Roman Empire was the womb from which Germany, Austria and Switzerland all emerged, it was itself never anything approximating a nation state. Instead, amorphous, multilingual and lacking a permanent capital, its identity was, in Wilson’s words, “always multiple and multilayered, reflecting its imperial extent over many peoples and places”.\n\nEven its dates are disputed. Although Otto was the first in a continuous succession of emperors, the great Frankish king Charlemagne had been similarly crowned in Rome as heir to the Caesars back in 800. Otto’s claim to the title of emperor was upheld partly on account of his prestige, partly because he ruled the eastern half of Charlemagne’s former dominions and very largely because the imperial title had been going begging since the capture and blinding in 905 of the previous man to hold it, Louis III.\n\nAn additional difficulty in tracing the empire’s evolution is the degree to which, ever since its dissolution, successive generations of scholars and ideologues have looked to its history to explain the character of modern Germany, rather than to understand it in its own terms. “All these claims work by projecting later developments deep into the past,” Wilson warns. A simple story to tell it is not.\n\nRather than a single chronological account of his subject’s history, then, Wilson opts to retell it from a variety of thematic perspectives. An account of the empire’s relationship with the papacy – sometimes mutually supportive, but more often tempestuous – broadens into an analysis of just how “holy” and “Roman” it actually was. A study of the bewildering array of identities within its shifting frontiers is then followed by a magisterial survey of how, from Charlemagne to Francis II, emperors went about keeping the show on the road.\n\nThe empire boasted Europe’s first postal network; its first daily paper began its print-run in 1655, 67 years before Britain’s; by 1800, it had 45 universities, compared with France’s 22 and England’s two. Even in its final centuries, when the assumptions that had governed its creation appeared increasingly anachronistic, it continued to command widespread loyalty. “Where outside the Empire can one find such freedom as is customary within it?” demanded one enthusiast in the late 17th century. In 1806, when it was finally dissolved under pressure from Napoleon, the artist Caspar David Friedrich was so upset by the news that he took to his bed.\n\nWilson’s great achievement is that he enables us to understand why. “It was the Empire’s inclusive diversity that made it distinctive and enabled its numerous inhabitants to identify with it.” As vast and capacious as the empire it describes, his book is as definitive a study of its subject as one could hope to read. Nevertheless, his approach does have drawbacks as well as advantages.\n\nEven the most vivid personalities in the history of the empire are rendered pallid by Wilson’s refusal to indulge readers with narrative. The meteor blaze of Frederick II, the 13th-century emperor damned by the Pope as the Antichrist and eulogised by admirers as “the Wonder of the World”, who visited Jerusalem and surrounded himself with Muslim guards, who spoke six languages and wrote the first treatise on falconry, only illuminates the book sporadically; the career of Charles V, whose reign witnessed the outbreak of the Reformation, and who ruled a broader array of territories than any Holy Roman emperor either before or after him, is almost impossible to piece together from Wilson’s pages.\n\nAs a result, those who find it a struggle to distinguish their Salians from their Staufers may well find it hard to follow what is often a complex and confusing story. “Bertha married the Byzantine emperor Manuel I in 1146, taking the Greek name Irene,” Wilson informs us at one point. “Henry VI’s brother, Philip of Swabia, married another Irene, daughter of the Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelus, a year before he became German king in 1198.”\n\nThe book is full of sentences like these. The odd flash of colour aside – the corpse of an emperor left perched on a stool for three days, the bishop who tidied up a woman’s garden by dragging her around on her bottom until all the weeds had been cleared – Wilson’s style is determinedly monochrome. This does not, of course, make his book any the less valuable as a study of a key, but often neglected, aspect of European history; but it does make it quite a slog. At 942 pages, The Holy Roman Empire deserves to be hailed as a magnum opus. Not merely exhaustive, it is also not a little exhausting."
