        "text": "Its name, however is rather misleading: the French philosopher Voltaire once decried the realm as “neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire”.\n\nListen | Peter Wilson describes the 1000-year history of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nSo why did it have that name?\n\nIt was not until 1254 that the title of Holy Roman Empire was applied, but the origins of the name date back to AD 800, more than 300 years after the western half of the Roman Empire had collapsed.\n\nMore like this\n\nThe Pope at that time, Leo III, was forced to flee Rome and, in desperation, he turned for help to Charlemagne, the powerful King of the Franks, who then ruled what is now roughly France and Germany. Charlemagne came to Leo’s aid.\n\nIn AD 800, the grateful Pope crowned him as Roman Emperor as a gift.\n\nThe 8 bloodiest Roman emperors in history\n\n10 key Roman dates you need to know\n\nAncient Rome – 6 burning questions\n\nHow did the Empire develop after that?\n\nAfter Charlemagne’s death in AD 814, his squabbling heirs broke up the Empire and the title of Roman Emperor became fairly meaningless for over a century.\n\nIt was revived by Otto I, King of the Eastern Franks (who ruled an area approximately equating to modern-day Germany), who had himself been crowned by Pope John XII in AD 962.\n\nAs with Charlemagne, Otto was crowned as a reward for having helped Pope John deal with his enemies in Italy.\n\nFrom that point, the Empire was chiefly centred on Germany, though it retained lands in Italy and elsewhere in central Europe.\n\nWhat relationship did these latter Roman Emperors have with the Popes?\n\nThe Empire, having been created and reinforced by the papacy at times of trouble, enjoyed a complex and frequently difficult relationship with the bishops of Rome.\n\nThe years after Otto’s reign were a high point for the Empire – at that time the most powerful in Europe – and a low one for the papacy.\n\nA series of Roman Emperors took their title seriously and sought to dominate the Popes, even deposing those they didn’t approve of.\n\nBy the mid 11-th century, however, the papacy was recovering and gaining power.\n\nIn 1075, a lengthy battle for dominance between the Popes and Emperors, known as the Investiture Conflict, began.\n\nWhen did the pope rule England?\n\nInvention or adaptation: what did the Romans really do for us?\n\nIn bed with the Romans: a brief history of sex in Ancient Rome\n\nThe death in 1250 of Emperor Frederick II, following a failed campaign in Italy, marked the final defeat of the Empire in this clash.\n\nFrom then on, the link between the Popes and Emperors was largely broken.\n\nThough the Empire kept its title, it was greatly weakened, particularly as it took 23 years to settle the decision of who should succeed Frederick – the most extraordinary, intelligent and ambitious of the Emperors.\n\nNo longer seeking European domination, the Empire settled into a loose confederation of mainly German states, with the Emperor often marginalised.\n\nHow did the Empire come to an end?\n\nIt was the French ruler Napoleon Bonaparte who oversaw the events that brought about the end of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHaving declared himself heir to Charlemagne, Bonaparte aimed to add German lands to his growing empire.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, the last Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II, disbanded his realm in 1806.\n\nHow was the Empire able to survive for so long?\n\nThis may perhaps be because it didn’t have much power as a single, authoritative domain.\n\nIt eventually came to comprise hundreds of territories, each of which enjoyed plenty of autonomy.\n\nFor the rulers of many of these lands, the Empire offered a welcome alternative to a dominant or even tyrannical central power.\n\nMoreover, until the 19th century, concepts of nationalism were far less prevalent that they would go on to become, so there was little drive to unify the various German territories into one nation state.\n\nWhat killed Napoleon Bonaparte?\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte: facts about his life, death and career\n\nCharlemagne: medieval empire builder\n\nWhat was the legacy of the Holy Roman Empire?\n\nWhen the German territories were unified as one country in 1871, it became known as the Reich (‘empire’ or ‘realm’). From 1933 to 1945, the Nazis sought to continue the Empire’s legacy by presiding over the Third Reich, which Adolf Hitler claimed would last 1,000 years.\n\nMore recently, the idea of the later Holy Roman Empire has been reflected in the European union where, once again, a group of disparate countries has been brought together under a loose umbrella."
