        "text": "One cannot visit Vienna without being awed and appalled by the Hapsburg dynasty, which had its main residences in this city. The legacy and shadow of the Hapsburgs still looms large over Vienna. Hapsburg or Habsburg?\n\nThis modest medieval fortress in Switzerland, built between 1020 and 1030, is the ancestral home of the Hapsburgs, who through strategic marriages ruled parts of Europe for an amazing 900 years. The Hapsburgs moved their home base to Vienna, and continuously held the title of Holy Roman Emperor for 302 years, from 1438 to 1740. The House of Hapsburg produced emperors and monarchs of Bohemia, England (King Consort), France (Queen Consort), Germany, Hungary, Russia, Croatia, Mexico, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities.\n\nTo achieve this, inter-marriage was the norm. A family motto was “the best spouse for an Hapsburg is another Hapsburg.” Marriages between first cousins, or between uncle and niece, were commonplace.\n\nBut eventually, inbreeding caught up with them. A study of 3,000 family members over 16 generations by the University of Santiago de Compostela suggested that inbreeding directly led to their extinction. The gene pool eventually became so small that the last of the Spanish line, Charles II, who was severely disabled from birth, perhaps by genetic disorders, possessed a genome comparable to that of a child born to a brother and sister, as did his father.\n\nIn The Habsburgs: Dynasty, Culture and Politics (2014), author Paula Sutter Fichtner notes:\n\n“On 28 June 1914, in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Habsburg-Lorraine-Este was shot dead. Known as the moment that sparked off the First World War, this incident also initiated another, lesser-known story: the beginning of the end of Hapsburg rule, which came four years later.”\n\nThe dynasty survived through a “dazzling mix of cultural propaganda, public performances and cunning political manoeuvring.”\n\nHapsburg Family Coat of Arms.\n\nWhat interesting characters!\n\nMaria Theresa\n\nCharles VI, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nCharles I\n\nHabsburg Family Portraits\n\nHabsburg History Website\n\nJohn Green of Crash Course discusses the Holy Roman Empire “by teaching you about Charles V (1661-1700). Charles Hapsburg was the holy Roman Emperor, but he was also the King of Spain. And the King of Germany. And the King of Italy and the Lord of the Netherlands and Count Palatine of Burgundy. In short, Charles was runnin’ thangs in much of the world during his reign. Charles ruled a lot of countries, and he was also known for encouraging intellectual discourse and he even spoke out against slavery, in a limited way. So why did he consider himself a failure, and why did he break up the Empire when he abdicated in 1556?\n\n“Mainly because the Holy Roman Empire didn’t work very well. It was huge, and it didn’t have any means of directly raising taxes. Plus, it was a pretty crazy time in Europe anyway, and Charles found himself in charge of the Catholic-Church-Endorsed Empire in the time of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. John will teach you a bit about how Charles put the Empire together, and how it fell apart, and even talk a bit about the Diet of Worms. This episode was written by Neal Schulz.” Transcript.\n\nCharles V was a contemporary of two of Europe’s most notable proto-nationalistic leaders: England’s Henry VIII and France’s Francis I of France.\n\n“Under Charles the template for the colonization of the Americas and the Christianization and treatment of it’s indigenous people was laid down, and Charles gave his seal of approval to the Jesuit order, to convert Asia. He underwrote the first mission settlements to California and began the process of turning the islands known as the Philippines into Asia’s largest Spanish speaking country. But he wasn’t just a conqueror, Charles also hosted the Valladolid Debates, the first discussions of universal human rights, and he actively sought to end slavery for many, although not for all, and he didn’t really succeed in ending it for anyone.”\n\nDespite its grandiose ambitions, the Holy Roman Empire was a failed state. “Charles V managed to totally bankrupt his realm….the Holy Roman Empire was doomed to fail, largely because it lacked the nationalism that powered the rising nation states like France and England….Over it’s 1004 year history the Holy Roman Empire never had the means of levying direct taxes, or directly raising an army from it’s territory, which nearly always included was are today eastern France, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, the Italian peninsula, and Czechoslovakia, and at times stretched to The Netherlands and Belgium, Hungary, Croatia, Poland, and western Ukraine.”\n\nOrigins\n\nThe H.R.E. began in 800 C.E. It “was a marriage between the Germanic warlord Charlemagne and the only sort of war lord-y Popes in Rome. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, western Christendom was basically a flock of rural warriors who reveled in trials by combat, Christian conversion through combat, and just generally combat. And Charlemagne shrewdly recognized that the churches mainly literate hierarchy and command of tradition were his best possible instruments for governing his battle-loving feudal lords. So Charlemagne and Pope Leo III struck a deal: Leo would bestow upon Charlemagne the authority and tradition of the Caesars while Charlemagne acknowledged the Church’s spiritual superiority over his secular power. And the name for this agreement reflected the terms of the deal: Holy, because the church wanted top billing, Roman, to give Charlemagne maximum prestige among his feudal subjects, and Empire because they wanted it to be an empire.”\n\nThis 10-minute video “covers the turmoil in the Frankish Kingdom which led to the rise of Charles Martel who famously defeated the invading forces of the Umayyad Caliphate at the Battle of Tours. His reign and that of his son, Pippin III, who appointed himself as king are briefly covered before the reign of Charlemagne is examined in detail. Charlemagne is without a doubt one of the most famous European monarchs and the Renaissance of Learning, his conquests and famously, his being crowned as Roman Emperor by Leo III are only a few of his achievements. His reign lasted for 47 years and after his grandsons divided the empire, the remnants became the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire.”\n\nRecommended books by History Matters\n\nChris Wickham – The Inheritance of Rome: A History of Europe from 400 to 1000. – “Seriously one of the best works on the period known as the Dark Ages, it covers everything from the collapse of the Western Roman Emperor to the nomads in Eastern Europe in an easily consumable format. An amazing book.”"
