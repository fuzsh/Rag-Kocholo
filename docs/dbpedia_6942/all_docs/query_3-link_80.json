        "text": "Following the decisive June 1942 Battle of Midway, the Joint Chiefs of Staff set the direction for U.S. strategy in the Pacific War. Their intent was to end Japan's threat to the American line of communication in the South Pacific, which resulted in the first U.S. offensive campaign in that theater. This campaign consisted of several stages intended to reduce the Japanese stronghold at Rabaul on New Britain Island and thus establish Allied control of the Bismarck Archipelago. Which of the tasks described below was not part of that campaign's stages? a. An Allied drive directly across the Pacific from Hawaii toward the Philippines. b. Seizure of base sites in the southern Solomons by forces from the South Pacific Area. c. An advance up the ladder of the Solomons by South Pacific forces, while Southwest Pacific forces moved up the north coast of New Guinea as far as Lae and Salamaua. d. A convergence on Rabaul and a clearance of the rest of the Bismarck Archipelago by forces of the two theaters, including outflanking the Japanese naval base at Truk in the Carolines and opening up the route for an assault to retake the Philippines.\n\nJacob Riis, a muckraker photographer, produced a photo essay called How the Other Half Lives: Studies Among the Tenements of New York, which led to -greater visibility of living conditions of the poor and led to housing reforms addressing space, cleanliness, and safety. -an increase in the number of sweatshops in the Lower East Side of Manhattan as textile factories discovered a new source of cheap labor in the form of immigrants. -one of the first immigration laws in the United States, which starting in 1906 reduced the number of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe permitted to enter the country to just a few thousand per year."
