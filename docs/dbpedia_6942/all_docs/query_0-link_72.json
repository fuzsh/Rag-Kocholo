It was officially founded in the year 962 when Otto I, also known as Otto the Great, was crowned Emperor by Pope John XII. The Holy Roman Empire was not a continuation of the ancient Roman Empire but rather a conglomeration of territories, principalities, and states, many of which were located in what is now modern-day Germany. It was characterized by a loose and often tumultuous relationship between the Holy Roman Emperor and various regional rulers, including kings, dukes, and bishops. The empire played a significant role in medieval European politics, religion, and culture, but it ultimately dissolved in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nBelow are maps showing the different phases of this state’s existence.\n\nNominally the states of the Holy Roman Empire in the XIII century were sovereign states under the protection of an elected emperor, but in reality, the Emperor’s power over the states was not guaranteed. States behaved like fully autonomous entities: had their army, taxes, tolls, rules, etc.\n\nAfter the death of the old Emperor, the usually 7-9 Electors would choose an Emperor for life who would rule the Empire. The Emperor was the highest in the feudal ranking system of everyone within the Empire, whose greatest task was to protect the Holy Roman Empire from external aggression and to protect the individual member state’s independence.\n\nHoly Roman Empire during the reign of the Hohenstaufen Emperors (1138 – 1254)\n\nThe Hohenstaufen Emperors played a significant role in the prosperity of the Holy Roman Empire during their reign. One of the most notable Hohenstaufen rulers was Frederick I, also known as Frederick Barbarossa. He sought to centralize imperial authority and restore the empire’s strength after a period of fragmentation. His efforts included legal reforms, the strengthening of imperial finances, and attempts to establish a more efficient administrative system.\n\nUnder Frederick Barbarossa’s leadership, the empire experienced relative stability and economic growth. He also aimed to secure the imperial borders and maintain peace within the realm. Additionally, his reign saw the beginnings of the legal system known as the “Landfrieden” or “peace of the land,” which sought to reduce internal conflicts and ensure the safety of trade routes.\n\nAlthough the Hohenstaufen Emperors made efforts to strengthen the Holy Roman Empire, they also faced significant challenges, including conflicts with the Papacy, which led to the Investiture Controversy and the struggle for control over ecclesiastical appointments. These conflicts had both political and religious dimensions and influenced the course of the empire’s history.\n\nPolitical map of the Holy Roman Empire in (1359)\n\nIn 1359, the Holy Roman Empire, led by Emperor Charles IV, was a vast and diverse realm consisting of numerous states, principalities, and territories across central Europe. Charles IV, a member of the House of Luxembourg, sought to strengthen the imperial authority and maintain stability within the empire during his rule.\n\nThe empire faced challenges such as ongoing conflicts with various regional powers, including the Papacy, as well as internal tensions among the noble and ecclesiastical elites. Charles IV implemented legal reforms and issued the Golden Bull of 1356, which standardized the election of future emperors and solidified the role of the seven prince-electors in the imperial succession.\n\nDespite these efforts, the Holy Roman Empire remained a loosely connected entity with a complex web of political allegiances and rivalries. The late 14th century marked a period of transition and transformation for the empire, with ongoing shifts in power dynamics and territorial boundaries that would continue to evolve in the centuries to come.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire after the Peace of Westphalia (1648)\n\nAfter the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, the Holy Roman Empire underwent significant changes. The Peace of Westphalia marked the end of the Thirty Years’ War, a devastating conflict that involved many European powers. The Holy Roman Empire was recognized as a collection of semi-autonomous states with significant internal sovereignty. The Peace of Westphalia affirmed the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, allowing each ruler within the Holy Roman Empire to determine the religion of their own state. This recognition of religious pluralism and increased autonomy laid the groundwork for the decentralized political structure that characterized the Holy Roman Empire in the subsequent years until its dissolution in 1806.\n\nThe map of Europe below created by Reddit user Shevek shows the Holy Roman Empire in 1648.\n\nThe level of control that the Emperor could exert influence over the individual member nations differed a lot, some were named Free Cities who were allowed the more legal rights to rule themselves notwithstanding their tiny size, and some pontificated more under the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church and some were primitive feudal states nominally under the personal rule of the Emperor, but would in effect just pay little more than lip service to their rule. The Emperor himself was also at times or some matters, in theory, subject to an assembly of delegates of the member nations, but how much power the assembly itself had, how much power individual members had in the assembly, what the assembly could consider, where and when those assemblies were called all varied considerably over the Holy Roman Empire’s roughly 1000 year-long existence. In short, the Holy Roman Empire was a mess. The animated maps below illustrate how the territory of the Holy Roman Empire changed over time.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire: Every Year\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire reached its maximum territorial extent during the reign of Emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain) in the 16th century. At its height, during the early 16th century, the empire included a vast expanse of territory across Central Europe, including modern-day Germany, Austria, the Low Countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg), Switzerland, parts of Italy, Czechia, and various other smaller regions.\n\nThis period of territorial expansion and influence was primarily driven by the personal unions of Charles V, who inherited numerous titles and territories.\n\nA simplified map of the territorial evolution of the Holy Roman Empire (962 – 1806) is presented below.\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia in 1648 marked a turning point in the history of the Holy Roman Empire, as it recognized the sovereignty and autonomy of many individual states within the empire. As a result, the empire gradually declined in influence and unity, and its territorial extent diminished over time.\n\nTo learn more about the Holy Roman Empire, read:"
