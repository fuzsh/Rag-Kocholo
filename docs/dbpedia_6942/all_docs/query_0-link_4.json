        "text": "This agglomeration which was called and which still calls itself the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire.1\n\nSo, what was this bizarre institution that dominated Western political and religious life throughout the Middle Ages through to the early modern era? Let's dive into the Holy Roman Empire and examine this significant political force in European history.\n\nHoly Roman Empire\n\nA collection of dozens (increasing to hundreds) of principalities ruled by various monarchs, princes, and dukes in Western Europe. Some areas were also ruled directly by the Holy Roman Emperor himself.\n\nFormation of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nThe formation of the Holy Roman Empire was a messy, stop-start process that took place from the 700s to the 1200s. Before we look at the events and figures who created the Holy Roman Empire, it is essential to take a moment to appreciate the conditions that allowed such an institution to develop.\n\nLong-term preconditions\n\nThree critical long-term preconditions formed the basis for the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe idea of the universal Roman Empire\n\nThe Roman Empire had been such a powerful political force that, naturally, the idea of the Roman Empire persisted in the West long after the Empire had disintegrated.\n\nThe idea of a 'Christian' Empire\n\nThis idea was born when Constantine I adopted Christianity as the Roman Empire's official religion in 312. The Church saw the Empire as the vehicle to spread the faith to the rest of the world.\n\nWhen Islam started spreading in the late 600s, the idea of a Christian Empire in the West resurfaced as a potent way to combat this new religious power.\n\nConflict between the papacy and the Byzantine Empire\n\nThe papacy became enraged at two actions taken by the Byzantine Empire in the 700s and 800s:\n\nThe Byzantine Isaurian dynasty led an iconoclastic set of reforms, including edicts against the veneration of images in churches between 726 and 729. The papacy saw these as heretical acts.\n\nIn 797, Byzantine Emperor Constantine IV was blinded and imprisoned by his mother, Irene, who declared herself Empress. The papacy believed that women could not be the head of the Christian empire, so they started looking for an alternative male candidate to crown.\n\nThe Papacy\n\nThe office of the Pope in Rome. The Pope during this time was seen as the head of the Church. Today, the Pope continues to be the head of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIconoclasm\n\nActs taken against religious images and symbols.\n\nVeneration\n\nActs of extreme reverence towards something or someone.\n\nHeretical\n\nBelieving something or acting in a manner contrary to official Church doctrine.\n\nCharlemagne\n\nThe papacy decided on Charlemagne, King of the Franks, as the best candidate for them to crown as male Roman Emperor of Christendom. On Christmas Day in the year 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as 'Augustus and Emperor'.\n\n(Un)Holy Pope?\n\nA significant incentive for Leo III to crown Charlemagne was not actually anything to do with the Byzantine Empire and Irene. Leo had been attacked by nobles in Italy who were hostile to him, and he sought a new protector. He found Charlemagne to be the perfect political figure to restore his fortunes.\n\nThe strange thing about this coronation was that Charlemagne's title as Emperor meant nothing without recognition from the Byzantine Empire. Charlemagne remained the ruler of the Franks and Lombards only.\n\nHowever, the coronation achieved a lasting political split between East and West. In 812, the Byzantine Empire recognised Charlemagne as an emperor.\n\nCharlemagne's Dynasty\n\nAfter Charlemagne's death, neither his son nor grandson were crowned Emperor by the Pope. However, the Frankish lands soon erupted in civil war. Therefore, Charlemagne's great-grandson, Louis II, decided that one way to bolster his power was to be crowned by the Pope in 850. From then on, Charlemagne's descendants were crowned Emperor by the papacy until the line ran out in 888.\n\nHowever, the title 'Emperor' remained nothing but a name during this period. It was merely a lasting reminder of the close links between Charlemagne's dynasty and the papacy.\n\nOtto and the Formation of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nOtto I became king of the German lands in 936. He elevated church ministers to positions of importance in his government. Furthermore, he married the widowed queen of Italy, taking over Italy as a vassal state of his lands.\n\nIn 961, Otto returned to Italy when the Italian vassal king tried to gain independence. Early in 962, Otto was crowned Emperor by Pope John XII. One of the most effective outcomes of this action was the geographical implication of an emperor who held political territory of Italy, in particular Rome. This laid the groundwork for a new 'Roman' Empire.\n\nOtto's Dynasty\n\nOtto's son, Otto II, made an innovation. Instead of having himself crowned just 'Emperor', he was crowned 'Roman Emperor'. Marrying a Byzantine princess, the heir to the 'Eastern' half of the old Roman Empire, strengthened Otto's claim to the title.\n\nThe links between the papacy and Otto's line were strengthened when Otto III made his cousin, Gregory V, Pope in 996. Otto III also created a new political system when he conquered Slavic lands. He ruled over a family of kingdoms, over which he exercised a sort of presidency centred on himself as Roman Emperor and the papacy. This was the origin of the Holy Roman Empire in its political form - a collection of kingdoms centered on the Emperor and Pope.\n\nConrad II\n\nOtto's line ran out in 1024 when Henry II died. This sparked a debate about who should become king and Roman Emperor in his place. A group of dukes and nobles got together and decided to elect Conrad II as their new king and Emperor. Thus, Conrad II became the first Salian king to be Roman Emperor.\n\nHowever, Conrad II went one step further. He decided that as Roman Emperor, he naturally ruled over a Roman Empire. Therefore, this is the first time we see the term Roman Empire used in the West. However, it would not be until 1254 that the full title 'Holy Roman Empire' was used. It was the lasting name for the political institution that Conrad II ruled over.\n\nThe group of dukes and nobles who elected Conrad II developed into an institution called the College of Electors. From the 13th century onwards, the Electors elected the next monarch to become the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nImperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nThe octagonal imperial crown of the Holy Roman Empire was probably used right from the 10th century down to 1806, when the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved.\n\nThe crown itself was made of eight gold plates and was highly ornate, with 144 pearls and precious stones studded all over it. It also had four plates showing images from the Bible.\n\nRise and Fall of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire underwent various cycles of strength and weakness from its formation to its dissolution in 1806.\n\nInvestiture Controversy (1076-1122)\n\nOne of the weaker periods of the Holy Roman Empire was the Investiture Controversy between 1076 and 1122. The conflict kicked off because of the slow rise of the power of the secular Holy Roman Emperor over the papacy.\n\nIn 1076, Pope Gregory VII decided enough was enough. He decreed that only the Pope could use the Holy Roman Empire's insignia and that the Pope could legally depose Holy Roman Emperors. Effectively, this was the papacy launching a challenge to the sacred authority of the Holy Roman Emperor. The result was a series of conflicts that shook the empire until 1122. The outcome was the slow demise of the power of the Holy Roman Emperor from the 12th century until 1806.\n\nIronically, the name Holy Roman Empire began as a result of this controversy when Emperor Frederick I decided to include the term 'Holy' to bolster his sacred authority due to the challenge of the papacy.\n\nEarly Modern Resurgence\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was a critical player in the late medieval and early modern periods. In 1495, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III introduced several reforms at the Diet of Worms. These included the development of a new legal institution (the Reichskammergericht), a new Imperial tax, and the creation of a central Imperial government (the Reichsreiment).\n\nMaximilian I\n\nA golden era for the Holy Roman Empire occurred during the reign of Maximilian. He oversaw many of the reforms outlined above. The new Imperial bodies that he helped to create enabled him not merely to oversee the Holy Roman Empire but to rule it.\n\nProtestant Reformation and Decline: 1517-1806\n\nA steady decline characterised the last two centuries of the Holy Roman Empire. This was precipitated by the Protestant Reformation, which divided Europe into Protestant regions (mainly in the north and west of Europe) and Catholic regions (mainly in the south and east).\n\nThe expansion of Protestantism destabilized the authority of the Holy Roman Empire. Religious strife helped usher in the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) which decimated the Empire, especially when the Empire's rivals, France and Sweden, seized large portions of the Empire's territory.\n\nAlternative Perspective:\n\nHistorian Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger argues that decline occurred even earlier than the Protestant Reformation. She writes:\n\nFor the proponents of the idea of the great medieval empire, however, the Holy Roman Empire's decline was already well under way by 1500, a process that gained further momentum after the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648.2\n\nThe death knell for the Holy Roman Empire sounded at the French Revolution's beginning. In 1806, Napoleon won a military victory over Francis I of Austria, the last Holy Roman Emperor. The result was the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nArmy of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire created its army in 1422 to abolish the Hussite rebellion in Bohemia and Slovakia. Essentially, when the Holy Roman Empire decided that it wanted to go to war as an entire entity, the various kingdoms within the Empire mustered local forces. These forces then joined together into one army for a specific purpose.\n\nTherefore, the army of the Holy Roman Empire had two defining characteristics:\n\nIt was not a permanent standing army but mustered at various points for specific wars and rebellions.\n\nIts loyalties lay more to its local kingdoms than to the central idea of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nSome of the wars that the army of the Holy Roman Empire fought included:\n\nThe Long War (1593-1606)\n\nThe Nine Years War (1688-1697)\n\nThe War of Spanish Succession (1701-1714)\n\nThe Legacy of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nThe renowned nineteenth-century German historian Leopold von Ranke held a dismal view of the Holy Roman Empire. He saw the failure to centralise the Empire as an example of a failed nation-state.3 His opinion reflects his time - when nation-states were ascendant in Europe - and so it was easy to see the Holy Roman Empire as feeble in comparison.\n\nContemporary historian Peter Wilson challenges Ranke's approach. He argues that we should see the Holy Roman Empire as:\n\n[lying] at the heart of the European experience [...] and general development.4\n\nHe sees the Holy Roman Empire as a success story. This powerful political body shaped a continent and lasted for a millennium. He draws parallels between the Holy Roman Empire and the European Union, stating that,\n\nThe Empire never demanded the absolute, exclusive loyalty expected by later nationalists. This reduced its ability to mobilise resources and command active support, but it also allowed heterogeneous communities to coexist, each identifying its own distinctiveness as safeguarded by belonging to a common home.5\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire - Key takeaways\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was a loose political body comprising many European kingdoms and principalities. It centred on the papacy and the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThe formation of the Holy Roman Empire was complex, evolving from 800 when the Pope crowned Charlemagne emperor to 1254 when the term Holy Roman Empire was used for the first time.\n\nThe Empire was a powerful force in the late medieval and early modern periods. Still, it started declining in power from 1500 onwards. It dissolved as a result of the French Revolution in 1806.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire never had a permanent standing army, reflecting its decentralised character.\n\nAlthough nineteenth-century historians tended to see the Holy Roman Empire as a failed nation-state, modern historians tend to see it as a triumph of decentralised continental stability, which shaped Europe as we know it today.\n\nReferences\n\nBarbara Stollberg-Rilinger, The Holy Roman Empire: A Short History, (2021), pp. 12.\n\nIbid., pp. 4.\n\nPeter H.
