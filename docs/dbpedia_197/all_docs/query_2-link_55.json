        "text": "this chapter offers a survey of the principal types of grave markers and tombs in the late Classical and hellenistic periods. Some, such as grave reliefs, columns, and statues, are carried over from the archaic and Classical periods, though there was a ban on luxurious grave markers in athens and attica from circa 480 to circa 430, and after 317 bce. peribolos tombs in athens and cist tombs in Macedonia first appear in the fith century. painted chamber tombs were known in anatolia in the archaic period (Mellink 1998). the fourth century introduces a great range of chamber tombs, including the spectacular underground Macedonian tombs with wall‐paintings, which begin after alexander the Great's conquest of asia, and temple tombs on huge pedestals with vast amounts of sculptural decoration sponsored by the local dynasts of the western satrapies of the persian empire, such as the Mausoleum at halikarnassos, which was designed by the famous architect pytheos. Grave Markers Reliefs Marble grave reliefs are the most common type of grave markers in the late Classical and hellenistic periods. they were normally set up in funerary precincts that lined the roads outside the city gates. Large quantities of reliefs from athens and attica of the fourth century survive. they were banned by an anti‐luxury decree imposed by Demetrios of phaleron in 317 bce and reappeared as late as the reign of augustus in the first century. they consist of relief slabs set in architectural frames, which were often topped by pediments. the names of the deceased and other members of their family are usually inscribed on the architrave. the scale of stelai ranges from modest to colossal, becoming larger and more elaborate as the fourth century progressed. Low relief stelai also tend to develop into high relief towards the end of the fourth century. their quality varies from fine art works to second‐rate products. the famous fourth‐century sculptor praxiteles was credited with a sculptured grave monument of a soldier leading his horse that was erected in the athenian Kerameikos (paus. 1.2.3). It is not clear, however, if this was a stele or a free‐standing sculpture.\n\nBy the term ›modern Athens‹ we describe the time framework beginning from the determination of the city as a capital of the newly-established Greek state, after its liberation. To be more specific, since 1834. It is the time period when Athens composes its modern history, free from the Turkish yoke, however strongly influenced by its occupation that lasted for centuries, while, at the same time, its history originates from the ancient times. The effort to discover, interpret and re-establish this past, defines its new identity, at a production and creation level, as well as in terms of choices. The term »modern« also not only refers to the construction time of the burial monuments but also to their instructive and historical role that still exists at present. Through the examples that are presented, we attempt to substantiate the influence of ancient Greek art, whether it originates directly from the ancient monuments, or whether it has been introduced to our country through classicism. We also refer to the way it influenced the western artists that worked in Athens, as well as the Greek creators. In the first case, in our opinion, the devotion to classicism is obvious; therefore, any influence or intention of imitation of Greek antiquity originates from there. There are also cases in which, under special conditions, certain architectural or sculptural patterns of antiquity have been reproduced. Greek marble carvers and other artists, on the other hand, were creating burial art, as it had been introduced to them by their neo classicist masters or by their collaborators. However, they maintained to develop burial types within the framework of a plastic art with a neohellenic character.\n\nTitle: “A sensorial approach to symbols and allusions in funerary art: extravagant grief, emotional display or/and monumentalization of cultural identities”. ABSTRACT Cemetery art and the extraordinary legacy of funerary monuments, from ancient Egypt to modern town planners’ schemes, is art, in the truest sense of the word. Although the subjects, symbols and allusions of funerary art have suffered a somehow curious neglect at the hands of writers, funerary monuments are among the most potent architectural monuments, bearing witness to our uneasy acknowledgement of mortality and our strong desire to remember those who have died. From bizarre ancient necropolises to architecturally stunning contemplative spaces, the continued remembrance of the dead, whether his life after death was viewed either as a dismal world fraught with peril and darkness, or very much like earthly existence, was not simply a personal concern, but rather a very important civic and religious duty dictated according to the concept of “eusebia” which, though frequently translated into English as “piety”, was much closer to social obligation. Burials were therefore conducted with ritual ceremonies and the inclusion of personal property and a vast variety of symbols, the understanding of which might help us gauge and unravel quintessential elements of the deceased and at the same time stimulate remembrance among the livings. A wide-ranging approach to the study of cemetery art led me to consider a pattern of allusions that emerges when funerary monuments are seen as a cohesive group. Sometimes these allusions are explicit, though at other times they are less obvious, only emerging through contextual reading. Death and architecture reveal many hidden wonders and beauties throughout the world. Emphasis will be also given to Herodes Atticus who has always displayed his disapproval towards the lack of feeling of the Stoics. The transformation of his Villa in southern Peloponnese into a mausoleum, as a result of his propensity for extravagant grief, confirmed the commonly held view that some kind of conscious existence is in store for the soul after death and that the dead and the living can affect one another mutually. Human life is not just an interlude of being between nothingness and nothingness.\n\nAthenian cemeteries can bring a lot of evidence concerning conflict. At first, there are cemeteries in Athens which have a direct involvement in conflict, namely the Commonwealth War Cemetery and the German War Cemetery. Besides, the Third Cemetery of Athens contains several monuments concerning conflict, not only a Memorial of unknown soldiers in the military part, but also Memorials of common citizens, victims of the World War II; the Jewish section contains Memorials and individual tombs, too. There are also monuments of symbolic sense, as the \" Mother of the Occupation \" at the First Cemetery, devoted to the victims of the Great Famine in occupied Athens during World War II. The paper deals with these monuments and examines whether their interpretation has helped to achieve reconciliation."
