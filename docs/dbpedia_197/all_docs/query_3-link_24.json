This chapter draws on a large body of literary evidence to show that hoplites conceived of themselves as inferior and vulnerable to cavalry, and to explain how their fear of this warrior type shaped warfare at a tactical and strategic level. Effective cavalry was not an innovation of the fourth century; it was central to Greek warfare throughout the Classical period, and the hoplite body’s need for countermeasures left marks on Greek military practice that are clear from the earliest historical accounts. While much work has been done on Greek horsemen in recent years, the strategic and tactical impact of this troop type continues to be underestimated. This chapter therefore focuses not only on the ways in which cavalry influenced warfare, but also on the reasons why it may appear less important than it was. Contemporary sources sometimes require interpretation, but they cannot be blamed for the distortion. They show beyond doubt that, far from an underdeveloped and insignificant element of warfare, cavalry was crucial to survival in most forms of action, which is reflected in the consistent policy of Greek states to raise as many of them as their socio-economic systems could sustain. Horsemen were not just the uppermost layer of society, but also the dominant force in the military thinking of the Greeks.",
