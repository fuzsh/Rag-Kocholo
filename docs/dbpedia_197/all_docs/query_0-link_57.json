        "text": "Excavations in the middle of the 20th century brought to light two collections of remarkable documents relating to the Athenian cavalry. The first, uncovered in 1965 from a well in the courtyard of the Dipylon Gate, included 574 lead tablets dated to the middle of the third century BCE. Excavations in 1971 in the Royal Stoa, within the intersection of the Panathenaic Way and the Agora West Road, unearthed within another well with a further 111 lead tablets, almost identical in nature to those found previously, dating to the mid-fourth and third centuries BCE. Known more simply as the Kerameikos and Agora tablets, these offer us the best insight into the value of Athenian cavalry horses over the fourth and third centuries. Scholarship has yet to offer any view other than that these tablets were part of a sort of government insurance scheme with the tablets recording the amount which the state was willing to insure the cavalryman's charger for if it was lost in battle. This scheme is a fascinating phenomenon in its own right, demonstrating how the Athenian state seems to have understood and accepted its responsibility for the risk that it was asking cavalrymen to take with their valuable animals in war. It is also, perhaps, noteworthy that no similar state insurance scheme seemed to exist for infantry, while the systems for naval vessels functioned vastly differently.\n\nOur understanding of this insurance scheme is complicated, however, by the way in which modern scholarship has sought to elide it with the separate ‘establishment loan’ given to cavalrymen at the start of their careers, the κατάστασις (hereafter, katastasis). But beyond the fact that they both seem to relate to state funding of the cavalry, there is no solid evidence for a connection between these tablets/insurance scheme and the katastasis.Footnote 2 Indeed, as I will argue, they should be kept separate, as two very different forms of government support: the insurance scheme, recorded on the lead tablets, represented the (variable) state imposed value of a cavalryman's charger, conversely the katastasis was given as a (uniform) establishment loan to every cavalryman to use as he wished. This hypothesis has its merit in ancient evidence, but, as will be seen, it is not without its own difficulties.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe insurance scheme and katastasis make the most sense and align best with our evidence when they are treated as two separate entities. We only run into difficulty when trying to connect the lead tablets of the Agora/Kerameikos, detailing the insurance of Athenian war horses, to the katastasis loan. It seems most plausible that the lead tablets reflect the relative, and therefore evidently differing, prices of cavalry chargers as they were valued through the timēsis process. Much like car insurance today, these amounts were no doubt influenced by many factors, and values were kept by the state in case they were needed in the event a cavalry charger was lost in battle. Similarly, the katastasis or ‘establishment loan’ as described to us in the sources, was simply that: a loan, of a static amount, likely created to encourage Athenian citizens to risk their wealth on the battlefield in ways a hoplite did not. It is in attempting to bring these two things together, in trying to see the lead tablets as a reflection of a horse-based katastasis rather than an establishment loan, that we become tangled. In attempting to do this, we find it near impossible to reconcile many issues as this work has outlined.\n\nIf we are to accept these two measures as separate, they also highlight the support the government, and therefore the dēmos, had for a well-equipped citizen cavalry. The cost to the state could indeed be very high, particularly if the cavalry faced high casualties and the insurance scheme was called upon. This, in itself, reflects the need for modern scholarship to reassess its traditional view of the position Athenian cavalry held within their dēmos. Whilst one would be unwise to argue that the cavalryman and hoplite were equal in their ability to earn κλέος or ‘fame’ in the classical Athenian world, one could perhaps at least see the gap between the two closing. Indeed the ‘hoplite ethos’ in Athens, and their presentation of the hoplite as the hero of the polis in the polis-period, is an accepted reality. However, this does not mean the cavalry was therefore at odds with this model. The cavalryman need not be a despised aristocrat or ignorant, wealthy youth. If this were true, surely the dēmos would not have thrown such support behind them."
