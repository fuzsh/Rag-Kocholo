My reason nevertheless to do so at some length is that I believe the arguments of previous scholars have not been pushed as far as they might. Our sources make clear that pursuit was not just common, but actively desired; that the point of pitched battle was not to score a moral victory, but to create an oppor- tunity for slaughter. Inevitably, the Classical Greeks gave thought to how they could make the most of such opportunities. In what follows, I will argue that the pursuit of a fleeing enemy was the very thing the Greeks hoped to achieve when they went into battle, and that various tactical decisions were made in order to maximise the chance of successful pursuit while reducing the risk that the hoplite militia might meet with catastrophic defeat. 40 Dayton 2005, 73–76; Schwartz 2009, 214–215; Echeverría 2011, 72–73; Van Wees 2011, 71–76. Note, however, that the point was not adopted by Wheeler, in what should be regarded as the most authoritative current standard work on ancient warfare (2007c, 212).\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 195 Even in light of the evidence cited above, such a conclusion may still be considered unwarranted. It could be argued that the abundance of examples demonstrates no more than that the chase was a sadly common reality, and that the Greeks would have regarded it at best as a necessary evil. Yet the sources suggest something different. Xenophon describes the sense of purpose felt by the Spartans when the Argives at the Long Walls of Corinth broke into a panic and fled: οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὐκ ἠπόρουν τίνα ἀποκτείνοιεν: ἔδωκε γὰρ τότε γε ὁ θεὸς αὐτοῖς ἔργον οἷον οὐδ᾽ ηὔξαντό ποτ᾽ ἄν. τὸ γὰρ ἐγχειρισθῆναι αὐτοῖς πολεμίων πλῆθος πεφοβημένον, ἐκπεπληγμένον, τὰ γυμνὰ παρέχον, ἐπὶ τὸ μάχεσθαι οὐδένα τρεπόμενον, εἰς δὲ τὸ ἀπόλλυσθαι πάντας πάντα ὑπηρετοῦντας, πῶς οὐκ ἄν τις θεῖον ἡγήσαιτο; The Lakedaimonians had no shortage of people to kill; for then the god granted them an achievement beyond their wildest prayers. To have a crowd of enemies delivered into their hands, terrified, panic-stricken, showing their unshielded sides, none of them caring to put up a fight, but doing everything they could to aid in their own destruction—how could anyone not see it as a divine gift? xen. Hell. 4.4.12 Far from a moral outrage, Xenophon describes the chase as a glorious oppor- tunity that was eagerly embraced. Here, the Spartans had a chance to engage in the sort of brutal display of military superiority that Van Wees has called ‘conspicuous destruction’.41 Such behaviour was both morally and strategically prudent.42 The pursuit allowed the victors to wipe out an enemy army rather than just breaking its will to fight—to exact due vengeance and to kill without fear of being killed. Once tactics and combat had broken the enemy, pitched battle turned into the gleeful and systematic destruction of the enemy’s abil- ity to carry on the war. Elsewhere, Xenophon makes this point even more clear: αἱ μὲν γὰρ πόλεις δήπου ὅταν κρατήσωσι μάχῃ τῶν ἐναντίων, οὐ ῥᾴδιον εἰπεῖν ὅσην μὲν ἡδονὴν ἔχουσιν ἐν τῷ τρέψασθαι τοὺς πολεμίους, ὅσην δ᾽ ἐν τῷ διώ- κειν, ὅσην δ᾽ ἐν τῷ ἀποκτείνειν τοὺς πολεμίους, ὡς δὲ γαυροῦνται ἐπὶ τῷ ἔργῳ, 41 Van Wees 2004, 240; 2010, 250–256; 2011, 105–106. 42 Schwartz 2009, 214; Van Wees 2011, 74–76.\n\n196 chapter 6 ὡς δὲ δόξαν λαμπρὰν ἀναλαμβάνουσιν, ὡς δ᾽ εὐφραίνονται τὴν πόλιν νομίζον- τες ηὐξηκέναι. ἕκαστος δέ τις προσποιεῖται καὶ τῆς βουλῆς μετεσχηκέναι καὶ πλείστους ἀπεκτονέναι … For when cities defeat their opponents in battle, words fail to express the joy they feel in the turning of the enemy, in the pursuit, in the killing of the enemy—such pride they feel in the work! Such shining glory they gain, such happiness at the thought of having enhanced their city! Everyone claims that they had a share in the plan, that they killed the most … xen. Hieron 2.15–16 This killing spree, he makes Hieron say, is one of the ‘pleasures’ (ἡδέα) of being at war. The fact that pursuit was a practically universal feature of Greek battle shows that Xenophon was not pushing a dissident opinion here. The attitude he describes no doubt resonated as much with the Spartans at the Long Walls of Corinth as it did with any other victorious Greek force. Part of this attitude, of course, was the necessary release of warriors who had faced mortal danger but now saw their enemies on the run; the former threat was rendered help- less, and, as Echeverría put it, ‘fear and fatigue turned into an enthusiastic explosion of joy’.43 Yet the focus on the achievement of slaughter in the pas- sages cited above shows that this release was not the whole story. A second significant motivation was the strategic opportunity presented by the enemy’s moment of vulnerability. The pursuit gave the victors a chance to do real dam- age to an opponent’s military reputation and resources. Battles where the chase was prevented tended to have a relatively low body count: at Solygeia, where Corinthian reinforcements compelled the victorious Athenians to flee, the defeated lost just two hundred and twelve men (Thuc. 4.44.6), and at Syracuse, with cavalry covering their retreat, the Syracusan dead numbered only two hundred and sixty (6.71.1).44 By contrast, a long pursuit frequently pushed the death toll into the thousands on the losing side.45 These numbers explain the 43 Echeverría 2011, 72; see also Sabin 2000, 15 (‘their gnawing tension and fear now released and converted into an orgy of blood lust’); Dayton 2005, 76; Rawlings 2007, 97–98; Schwartz 2009, 214. 44 Krentz (1985a, 18–19) further noted the low losses on both sides at Koroneia (given only in Diod. 14.84.2). However, in this early work, he still followed the Prussian model on the matter of pursuit, denying its frequent occurrence (20). 45 For instance at Delion (Thuc. 4.101.2) and at the Nemea (Xen. Hell. 4.3.1; Diod. 14.83.2). At Spartolos (Thuc. 2.79.7), the Athenians lost over 20 % of their force ‘and all the generals’.\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 197 anger of the Argives during the overture to First Mantineia, when they realised that their generals had allowed the retreating Spartans to escape ‘with no one pursuing them’ (οὐδεὶς ἐπιδιώκει, Thuc. 5.56.5). They also explain Xenophon’s remark that when Epameinondas fell at Second Mantineia, ‘those who were left were unable to use the victory properly’ (οἱ λοιποὶ οὐδὲ τῇ νίκῃ ὀρθῶς ἔτι ἐδυνάσθησαν χρήσασθαι, Xen. Hell. 7.5.25). ‘Using the victory’ meant chasing and killing at will. Rout without pursuit was lamented as a missed opportu- nity. The need for release and the desire to exploit the enemy’s helplessness could go hand in hand. Hoplites are sometimes said to have pursued their enemies over a considerable distance,46 suggesting they may have done a lot of damage. At Marathon, they chased the Persians all the way back to the beach, allegedly killing them in their thousands and even burning seven of their ships (Hdt. 6.113–115, 117.1). The Spartans seem to have inflicted some of their most famous bloodbaths—at the Nemea and the Long Walls of Corinth—with the very forces that fought the initial clash. Given the chance, hoplites could wipe out their enemies in the process of venting their frustration. Yet such results were the exception. As many scholars have pointed out, hoplites may have desired to wreak havoc among their fleeing enemies, but they were poorly suited to the task. Their equipment weighed them down, and they would have been too exhausted from the charge and the fight itself to pursue their opponents effectively.47 In addition, defeated troops could throw away their shields, while the victors had to hold on to them; the resulting chase would have been a lot like the futile attempts of unsupported hoplites to chase off attacking psiloi. It is worth pointing out that the Spartans at the Nemea caught their enemies by surprise when they thought the battle was already over; the fight was between a fresh and disciplined Spartan phalanx and a series of confused and tired masses of heavy infantry. At the Long Walls of Corinth, the enemies of the Spartans were panicking and had no means of escape. Only in such conditions could hoplites do their own killing. If the enemy could scatter at will, heavy infantry had little hope of inflicting serious losses. Indeed, hoplites who pursued too far and lost their cohesion became just as vulnerable as their targets. In the aftermath of the battle of Plataia, the Megari- ans and Phleiasians ran up in disorder to join the pursuit of the fleeing Persians; 46 For instance at Potidaia (Thuc. 1.62.6), at First Mantineia (Thuc. 5.72.3), and at Abydos in 409 (Xen. Hell. 1.2.16). 47 Droysen 1889, 93–94; Grundy 1911, 267–268; Adcock 1957, 7; Anderson 1970, 149; Spence 1993, 157–159; Sabin 2000, 5; Rawlings 2007, 97; Wheeler 2007c, 212.\n\n198 chapter 6 a detachment of Theban cavalry saw its chance, charged them, and killed six hundred men (Hdt. 9.69.2).48 During one of the battles outside the walls of Syracuse, the victorious Athenian logades were routed mid-pursuit by a cavalry counterattack (Thuc. 6.101.4–5). The Himeraians, at first successful in their bat- tle with the Carthaginians in 409, lost their cohesion during the pursuit and lost three thousand men to an enemy counterattack (Diod. 13.60.6–7). At Haliar- tos, rallying Spartans turned on their pursuers in the hills, leaving more than two hundred dead (Xen. Hell. 3.5.20; Plut. Lys. 28.6). The enthusiastic pursuit of routed Mantineians by the mercenaries of Polytropos in 370 ended in his death when the Mantineians regrouped and counterattacked (Xen. Hell. 6.5.13–14). Fighting for their homes against Epameinondas in 362, some Spartans ‘pursued further than they should’ (ἐδίωξαν πορρωτέρω τοῦ καιροῦ, Xen. Hell. 7.5.13); the Thebans swiftly cut them down.49 Little could be done to prevent such reverses. Tactical control of pursuing troops seems to have been all but impossible; battles such as Delion, First Mantineia and the Nemea show that victorious contingents usually proved unable to respond to the changing situation on the battlefield.50 Spread out and unguided, they became liable to panic and fragmentation. Pausanias is proba- bly right to claim that the Spartan reluctance to pursue over great distances was ultimately rooted in their fear of being caught in such a state.51 As noted above, the Syracusans broke off their pursuit of the Carthaginians at Akragas in 406 because they feared that the enemy might appear with reinforcements (Diod. 13.87.2); the Thebans limited their pursuit of the defeated Spartans at Tegyra for the same reason (Plut. Pel. 17.4). However, the inevtiable downside of such nec- essary caution was the loss of an opportunity for slaughter. At Kounaxa we see the principle in action: the pursuing Greeks shouted to each other not to run out and break formation, and as a result their pursuit was wholly ineffective 48 Grundy (1901, 507) suggested that the men from the Greek centre were not in fact joining the pursuit of an already beaten enemy, but rushing forward to support the Athenians in their ongoing fight against the Medising Greeks; for this theory, see also Burn 1970, 537; Green 1970, 267–268; Nyland 1992, 84. 49 Wheeler (1991, 149) has noted the number of commanders who were wounded or killed as they led the pursuit of their defeated enemies. 50 Thuc. 4.96.5, 5.73.3; Xen. Hell. 4.2.22; see Lazenby 1989, 70–71; Anderson 1970, 148–149; Ehrhardt 1994, 1–2; Van Wees 2004, 191. The battles of Marathon (Hdt. 6.113.2) and Kynoske- phalai (Plut. Pel. 32.3) are unique in that they apparently involved pursuing troops being reined in and redirected. 51 Krentz 2002, 30; Dayton 2005, 71–73; Echeverría 2011, 73; Van Wees 2011, 71–72; Toalster 2011, 50, 52; Sheldon 2012, 109.\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 199 (Xen. An. 1.8.19). It was only at the initial collapse and ‘turn’ that the hoplites had a real chance to kill large numbers of the enemy; to continue beyond that point was neither effective nor safe. The Greeks, therefore, used other troops. As we have seen, when the phalanx became a homogenous formation and took on the role of the ‘chest and cuirass’ of the army, light infantry and horsemen became crucial in screening the heavy infantry and protecting it against their opposing numbers in the enemy force. This explains the emergence of increasingly organised units of such troops from the early fifth century onwards. Yet this shift in army organisation also meant that, for the first time, relative speed became a decisive factor in the tactical roles of different types of troops. Hoplites, while superior in close combat, were slow and vulnerable both on the march and on the run. As a result, the chase became yet another aspect of battle in which more mobile troops proved to be of tremendous tactical value.52 Light-armed infantry had no trouble overtaking hoplites in flight. If the advance of the phalanxes had forced the psiloi to withdraw to the flanks and rear of the army, we may assume they now rushed forward again to fall upon the routed enemy.53 Thucydides tells us how well suited they were for this: οἱ δὲ Αἰτωλοὶ ἐσακοντίζοντες πολλοὺς μὲν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ τροπῇ κατὰ πόδας αἱροῦντες ἄνθρωποι ποδώκεις καὶ ψιλοὶ διέφθειρον … The swift-footed and light-armed Aitolians used their javelins against many of the men they overtook in the turning, and destroyed them … thuc. 3.98.2 In one notable case, the losses inflicted by pursuing psiloi were so high that Thucydides refused to record them, claiming he would not be believed if he did.54 The missiles of these troops were especially useful against a cornered enemy, as at the battle near Megara mentioned above; in addition, of course, light troops could simply outrun fleeing hoplites and cut them down with any weapon they had to hand. They appear at times to have done so with reckless abandon. The peltasts and hamippoi of the Thebans at Second Mantineia 52 Hanson (1989, 184) presents this as a rare opportunity for light troops and cavalry to prove their worth to ‘their betters’, the hoplites. 53 The process is never described, but light troops often explicitly take part in the pursuit: see for example Thuc. 1.106, 5.10.10; Xen. An. 4.8.18; Hell. 5.3.6; Plut. Tim. 28.5; note also Lippelt 1910, 59. 54 Thuc. 3.113.7; at 3.112.6 he specifies that this was because they were psiloi fighting hoplites.\n\n200 chapter 6 ended up far ahead of the rest of their army, where they were caught and destroyed by enemy forces that turned out not to be fleeing after all (Xen. Hell. 7.5.25). Yet the real killers, again, were the horsemen. Their speed and manoeuvrabil- ity made them the perfect troops for pursuit. During campaigns, cavalry could compel unsupported hoplite armies to huddle together in fear of being picked off; during the chase, they could ride down an already scattered phalanx with impunity. Ancient authors frequently single them out for their particular lethal- ity: Βοιωτοὶ δὲ ἐφεπόμενοι ἔκτεινον, καὶ μάλιστα οἱ ἱππῆς οἵ τε αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ Λοκροὶ βεβοηθηκότες ἄρτι τῆς τροπῆς γιγνομένης: The Boiotians hunted and killed them, the cavalry most of all, which included them and the Lokrians, who had come to help at the exact time of the turning. thuc. 4.96.855 ἐπεὶ μέντοι ἡγεῖτο ὁ Ἀρχίδαμος, ὀλίγοι μὲν τῶν πολεμίων δεξάμενοι εἰς δόρυ αὐτοὺς ἀπέθανον: οἱ δ᾽ ἄλλοι φεύγοντες ἔπιπτον, πολλοὶ μὲν ὑπὸ ἱππέων, πολλοὶ δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν Κελτῶν. And when Archidamos led on, only a few of the enemy awaited the spears and were killed; the others were cut down as they fled, many by the horsemen and many by the Celts. xen. Hell. 7.1.3156 … οἵ τε ἱππεῖς προσελάσαντες ὅλην ἐτρέψαντο τὴν φάλαγγα καὶ διώξαντες ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐνέπλησαν νεκρῶν τὴν χώραν, πλέον ἢ τρισχιλίους καταβαλόντες. … and the cavalry, charging up, turned the entire phalanx, and pursued them a long way, filling the country with corpses, cutting down more than three thousand of them. plut. Pel. 32.757 55 See also Thuc. 2.79.6, 6.68.3. 56 See also Xen. Hell. 5.3.6, 5.4.54, 7.2.14. 57 See also Plut. Tim. 31.2–4.\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 201 The division of labour is clear. While the hoplites may have done the initial damage, the horsemen had the range and stamina to take the pursuit as far as it could go. In addition, they had the advantage of being fast enough to catch up with fleeing enemy light troops, and even with other cavalry—a unique ability that often made them the most celebrated participants of a successful chase.58 Xenophon notes that effective pursuit is all but impossible without horsemen: … καὶ δὴ τρεπόμενοι ποίους ἢ ἱππέας ἢ τοξότας ἢ πελταστὰς ἄνευ ἵππων ὄντες δυναίμεθ᾽ ἂν φεύγοντας ἢ λαβεῖν ἢ κατακανεῖν; τίνες δ᾽ ἂν φοβοῖντο ἡμᾶς προσιόντες κακοῦν ἢ τοξόται ἢ ἀκοντισταὶ ἢ ἱππεῖς, εὖ εἰδότες ὅτι οὐδεὶς αὐτοῖς κίνδυνος ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν κακόν τι παθεῖν μᾶλλον ἢ ὑπὸ τῶν πεφυκότων δένδρων; … and when we have turned them, how could we, without horses, catch or kill fleeing horsemen or archers or peltasts? And what archers or javelin throwers or horsemen would be afraid to come up and harm us, knowing full well that they are in no more danger of being harmed by us than by those trees growing over there? xen. Kyr. 4.3.5 Cavalry ensured that the chase was more than a clumsy and risky release of stress for embattled hoplites. They could turn the enemy’s rout into the destruction of his army. Their frequent appearance in this stage of battle confirms the impression we get from Xenophon that the pursuit was a central aspect of Greek tactical thought. If the Greeks regarded the chase as no more than the regrettable result of victorious hoplites’ stress-induced bloodlust, it would be difficult to explain why they would allow additional forces to take part in it. Light troops and cavalry rarely had a share in the ‘turning’ when two phalanxes faced off, so why would they have a role to play in the chase? Indeed, why do we hear of them being specifically sent into action only at this point (Hell. Oxy. 11.5)? And why would the Greeks praise them specifically and repeatedly for their effectiveness in this role? 58 Xen. An. 3.4.4–5, 6.5.28; Hell. 4.3.6–8, 5.3.2. Note, however, the battle of Sardis according to Hell. Oxy. 11.6. The value of this account is disputed (see Wylie 1992a), but regardless of its veracity it makes the plausible suggestion that lightly equipped horse archers would be able to escape mounted pursuers in much the same way that psiloi would be able to outrun hoplites in the chase.\n\n202 chapter 6 The answer must be that the slaughter of the enemy was the desired out- come of battle. The pursuit may have been primarily a matter of inflicting righteous punishment, but this ostentatious display of vengeful power had obvious military advantages. It was more than a mere symbolic act. Conspicu- ous destruction worked by discouraging enemy action in the future, but also by crushing any remaining potential for such action in the present.59 The deliber- ate use of light troops and cavalry in the pursuit demonstrates that this strategic aspect of the chase—its potential to cripple the enemy war effort and deter further aggression—was of primary importance in Greek thinking about the purpose of battle. There were only two ways to survive the onslaught. The first was, quite simply, to stay calm and keep one’s head, ‘for generally those who behave this way in war will not be touched’ (Pl. Sym. 221b). Several sources recount the story of Sokrates’ heroic behaviour during the Athenian flight at Delion: with his calm demeanour and confident stride he kept all pursuers at bay, saving both his own life and the lives of those around him (Pl. Laches 181b; Sym. 220e–221c; Plut. Mor. 581d–e). Indeed, troops chasing fleeing enemies are likely to have focused on opportune targets, and units that retreated in some semblance of order seem to have suffered far less than those that collapsed completely.60 This fact probably explains Xenophon’s belief that the Spartan ideal of fighting to the death actually saved lives (Kyr. 3.3.45; Lak. Pol. 9.1–2). Yet in the absence of officers to enforce unit discipline, keeping order required an almost superhuman effort of self-control on the part of individual hoplites. The ancients’ admiration for Sokrates shows how exceptional his behaviour was. Flight was primarily a matter of instinctive self-preservation, and to most men this would have meant getting as far away from the enemy as possible before anyone got a chance to strike them down. The second countermeasure was more reliable: using horsemen as a cover- ing force.61 Such troops could make pursuers think twice about rushing after their enemies and exposing themselves to counterattack. Their presence could save entire armies: 59 Van Wees 2011, 74–76. 60 At Megara in 409, the Athenians are explicitly said to have left the retreating Spartans alone, and to have gone after the men of Megara who were fleeing in disorder (Hell. Oxy. 1.1). Diodoros (13.65.2), however, claims this was only because the Athenians wanted revenge for the recent recapture of Nisaia. 61 Spence 1993, 159–162; Van Wees 2004, 196; Rawlings 2007, 97–98.\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 203 καὶ ἐπὶ πολὺ μὲν οὐκ ἐδίωξαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι (οἱ γὰρ ἱππῆς τῶν Συρακοσίων πολλοὶ ὄντες καὶ ἀήσσητοι εἶργον, καὶ ἐσβαλόντες ἐς τοὺς ὁπλίτας αὐτῶν, εἴ τινας προδιώκοντας ἴδοιεν, ἀνέστελλον) … The Athenians did not pursue far, for the Syracusan cavalry were many and undefeated, and they hemmed them in, attacking and pushing back any of the hoplites they saw pursuing ahead of the rest … thuc. 6.70.3 At First Mantineia, the Athenian contingent nearly ended up surrounded and destroyed, but their cavalry ensured that they got away safely (Thuc. 5.73.1). At Orchomenos in 370, when Polytropos fell and his troops scattered, ‘very many of the fleeing men would have been killed’, if allied Phleiasian cavalry had not appeared in the nick of time to save them (Xen. Hell. 6.5.14). By contrast, when Dionysios withdrew the horsemen supporting his unruly mercenary infantry at Syracuse in 396, their removal was intended as a death sentence; the Carthaginians obliged him by wiping out the infantry to a man (Diod. 14.72.2– 3). Cavalry, then, had a dual role in the final phase of battle that made their presence critically important even if they had played no part in the fighting up to that point. No one expresses their importance more clearly than Xenophon, when he has Klearchos address the Ten Thousand after Kounaxa: οὐ μὲν δὴ ἂν μάχεσθαί γε δέῃ, ἱππεῖς εἰσιν ἡμῖν ξύμμαχοι, τῶν δὲ πολεμίων ἱππεῖς εἰσιν οἱ πλεῖστοι καὶ πλείστου ἄξιοι: ὥστε νικῶντες μὲν τίνα ἂν ἀποκτεί- ναιμεν; ἡττωμένων δὲ οὐδένα οἷόν τε σωθῆναι. And if we need to fight, we have no horsemen to help us, while the enemy’s horsemen are very many and very skilled. So, if we win, whom could we kill? And if we lose, not one of us can be saved. xen. An. 2.4.6 The focus here is entirely on the role of cavalry in the chase. The enemy has horsemen and the Greeks do not; therefore, for the Greeks, winning battles is pointless, and losing is fatal. Conversely, if the enemy are defeated, they will safely escape; if they win, their victory will be total. The examples cited throughout this section show that these are no empty words. Xenophon later repeats the same point in a summation of the hopelessness of the plight of the Ten Thousand (An. 3.1.2), and then shows how it was confirmed in practice: the mercenaries failed to ward off a constant barrage of missiles because Persian\n\n204 chapter 6 horsemen made it impossible for them to stray too far from the phalanx (3.3.8– 10). Without cavalry to support them, they were harried relentlessly by their more nimble enemies. It was not until they raised their own unit of cavalry that they were able to strike back against the Persians harassing them (3.3.20, 3.4.4–5).62 When the Ten Thousand encountered a Persian army in Bithynia, the truth of Klearchos’ words was demonstrated again. During the battle, the advance of the veteran phalanx swiftly routed the enemy, but the Greek cavalry corps was too small to be everywhere at once. On the right wing, where they were stationed, they ‘killed as many as they could’, but on the left wing the unsupported Greek peltasts achieved nothing in the chase because they knew enemy cavalry was waiting for them (Xen. An. 6.5.27–29). The looming threat of a cavalry counterattack meant that the Greek left wing had not really won the battle at all; they could not risk abandoning their formation in order to destroy the enemy. The hoplites and light troops stationed there finally decided that they had no choice but to charge the Persian and Bithynian cavalry in the desperate hope of driving them off. When they attacked, however, to their surprise, the enemy promptly fled—‘as if they were being chased by horsemen’ (ὥσπερ ὑπὸ ἱππέων διωκόμενοι, Xen. An. 6.5.31).63 Klearchos’ speech tells us much about the prominence of cavalry in Greek warfare. However, it tells us even more about the importance of the chase in Greek conceptions of battle. Apparently only an army with troops fit for pursuit could hope to win a victory that would actually count. In principle, cavalry is not essential to this aim; as long as neither side had any horsemen, light infantry could play the same role.64 The crucial point is that the relative speed 62 At another point in the narrative (An. 3.2.18–19) Xenophon appears to dismiss the Persian horse as useless, but his speech—like Brasidas’ comments on Illyrian light-armed troops, discussed in Chapter 4 above—was clearly no more than misleading rhetoric meant to restore the confidence of the troops. Like the words of Brasidas, it only confirms that the troop type being mocked really was perceived as a threat. For this interpretation see Worley 1994, 124; Lendle 1995, 160; Sidnell 2006, 23; Crowley 2012, 101. 63 This remark seems to have puzzled the Loeb translator, who added a confused note about terrain types. In fact Xenophon’s meaning seems perfectly clear: the Persians, who knew their escape would be difficult due to the presence of a gorge to their rear, surprised the Greeks by fleeing as if they were in genuine danger of being caught—which they were not, because the Greeks had no horsemen on that wing. 64 Note for example the successful joint action of peltasts and hoplites to rescue ravaging light troops at Pygela in 409 (Xen. Hell. 1.2.2–3). The main weakness of psiloi was that they were themselves just as vulnerable to cavalry counterattack as hoplites; the faster the troop\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 205 of different unit types became a defining feature of tactical thought specifically because it indicated the chances of successful pursuit. An enemy who was routed but not pursued could simply regroup and fight another day. By the same token, armies without adequate units to cover their retreat could fully expect to be wiped out if the enemy ever put them to flight. Both the greatest chance for collective glory and the greatest danger of annihilation appeared after the clash of the hoplite lines. The events of the Sicilian Expedition illustrate the point: the Athenians won a string of nominal victories outside the walls of Syracuse, but the Syracusan cavalry made it impossible for them to chase and destroy the enemy army. As a result, the battles they won were not decisive, and they could not win the war.65 This was precisely the situation Klearchos feared as commander of the Ten Thousand: one in which hard fighting brought no results, and victory meant nothing. If there could be no chase, the battle itself might as well not have been fought in the first place. If this interpretation is correct, it may explain the phenomenon—men- tioned in Chapter 4 above—of units of light troops and cavalry disappearing from ancient battle accounts after their presence in the order of battle has been noted. If the pursuit was the crucial phase of battle, and each army would need fast troops for that phase regardless of whether the clash of the phalanxes fell out in their favour or not, it would make sense to hold such troops back from the initial engagement, even if they could potentially play a major role in it. Rather than risk the horsemen in a charge from which they might not return, it would have seemed prudent to hold them back until the moment when their intervention would make the greatest difference. In defeat, they could save the army; in victory, they could win the war. If the Greeks therefore did not always integrate such troops in their battle plans, it was not because they intended to limit their battles to a hoplite charge; it was because horses and light troops had far more important things to do than simply fight. The breaking and ‘turning’ of the enemy was only the opening phase of battle. Far from being reprehensible to the Greeks, the pursuit was a defining feature of their way of war. type, the greater its advantage. This must be why Xenophon focuses on horsemen in this context. 65 Thuc. 6.70.3, 6.71.2, 6.101.5, 7.5.3, 7.6.2–3, 7.11.2–4.\n\n206 chapter 6 Last Rites The final death toll, however, was not the way to determine who had won. The actual custom is somewhat puzzling in light of the shrewd ruthlessness that seems to characterise Classical Greek military practice in general. The example of Solygeia illustrates the point. At this amphibious battle, the victorious Athe- nians had to abandon the battlefield when enemy reinforcements arrived; they could not recover all the bodies of their own fallen before their hurried with- drawal to their ships. Two bodies remained on the shore, and the Athenians were forced to request a truce to collect them. This request meant that, despite their victory, they had been defeated (Thuc. 4.44.2–6). How do we explain this paradox? Could this, at last, be evidence of tacit rules shaping the Greek way of war? During the Classical period, the Greeks followed up practically every engage- ment with two acts: the victors set up a trophy, and the defeated requested a truce to recover their dead. First attested in the second quarter of the fifth cen- tury,66 these fixed elements of battle formally ended the fighting and made its outcome official. Those who set up a trophy had won, while those who had to ask for a truce to collect the fallen had lost. The origin of these practices is unknown, but the fact that Thucydides and Xenophon faithfully report them in formulaic sentences at the end of nearly every battle account plainly demon- strates their importance.67 Numerous scholars have discussed them in detail,68 and recent years have seen outstanding studies of the trophy in particular69— but, again, the evidence seems to allow for new interpretations that make more sense of these apparently agonal customs within the context of a brutal, unre- strained way of war. The truce, always requested by a herald from the losing side, allowed the defeated army to collect and bury its dead. The request by its very nature implied that the bodies could not be recovered by force. As such, it amounted 66 Krentz 2002, 32–34; Trundle 2013, 126–128; Lissarrague 2014, 59. Regarding the origin of truces to recover the dead, Krentz cites no evidence; the first historical instance is in fact the battle of Potidaia in 432 (Thuc. 1.63.3). 67 Rawlings 2007, 97, 192. It has been argued (Nevin 2008, 115; Hau 2013) that the Greek historians were pointedly selective in their accounts of what happened in the aftermath of battle. However, the ubiquity of trophies and truces speaks against the notion that these authors were in any sense hesitant to report them. 68 The standard modern overviews, with sources and bibliography, are Pritchett 1974, 246– 275 (on trophies) and Pritchett 1985, 246–249 (on truces). 69 Rabe 2008; Bettalli 2009; Trundle 2013; Lissarrague 2014.\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 207 to a formal admission of defeat.70 The decision to ask for a truce was therefore a momentous one; beaten troops whose spirits were still high would sometimes demand a second battle over the dead, unwilling to admit that they had lost. Some Spartans apparently raised this possibility at Leuktra (Xen. Hell. 6.4.14), and the Spartan king Pausanias was in fact condemned to death partly for his failure to fight for the fallen at Haliartos in 395 (Xen. Hell. 3.5.25; Plut. Lys. 29.1–2).71 Even if a second battle was not an option, the Greeks sometimes attempted to take their dead back rather than ask for them. After a cavalry skirmish outside Athens in 431, both sides recovered their dead without a truce (Thuc. 2.22.2). When Agesilaos heard of the massacre at Lechaion, he rushed to the scene to seize the bodies, and was dismayed to find that they had already been recovered under truce (Xen. Hell. 4.5.7–8). Yet no actual example of a battle over the bodies is known. As a rule, Classical Greek battles ended when the victors granted the truce. The trophy (τρόπαιον), meanwhile, consisted of little more than a suit of armour nailed to a post.72 In land battles, it was set up at the site of the ‘turning’—indeed, its name is derived from this word (τροπή).73 If battles had several focal points, sometimes the victors set up more than one trophy.74 Once it had been built, the trophy was apparently considered inviolable; even if the losing side regained control of the battlefield, they were expected to leave it intact. We do not know why this was the case. It has been suggested that trophies may have been dedicated to one deity or another as a thank- offering, which implies that their destruction would have been seen as an act of sacrilege. Clear evidence, however, is lacking.75 All we know is that trophies were left to stand on former battlefields for a long time as markers of one side’s victory and the other’s defeat. Late sources tell us that, as a compromise, the victors were supposed to construct the trophy out of perishable materials, so that it would eventually decay and fall apart.76 However, we do not know if this 70 Diod. 15.87.3–4; Plut. Nik. 6.5–6; Anderson 1970, 3–4; Pritchett 1985, 246–249; Rabe 2008, 9. 71 Westlake 1985, 130–131. 72 Pritchett 1974, 264–269, lists all known attestations. 73 Trundle 2013, 126; Lissarrague 2014, 57. 74 Thuc. 5.3.4 (two), 7.24.1 (three), 7.45.1 (two); Xen. Hell. 1.2.10 (two). 75 For the theory, see especially Ducrey 1985, 274. Pritchett accepted that trophies were inviolable (1974, 258–259), but noted that their religious meaning remained unclear and contested (247–249). Lissarrague (2014, 58) rejects a religious connection altogether. 76 Diod. 13.24.5–6; Cic. Inv. 2.69–70; Plut. Mor. 273c–d.\n\n208 chapter 6 rule actually applied in Classical Greece, or whether it is yet another example of Hellenistic and Roman authors idealising the past. Indeed, none of the conventions surrounding trophies was written in stone, and the sources show these markers being met with a range of disrespectful responses. Plutarch tells us that Epameinondas openly laughed at the trophy set up by Chabrias after the latter’s light troops killed a few reckless Thebans outside the walls of Corinth (Mor. 193e–f). Some of the beaten Spartans at Leuktra urged their comrades to prevent the Thebans setting up the marker for their victory (Xen. Hell. 6.4.14). King Agis is said to have called on the Athenians to sally and fight for possession of a trophy they had themselves set up outside their walls; his unchallenged taunts and possession of the field effectively nullified the Athenian victory (Diod. 13.73.1). Worse could happen if the outcome of a battle was seen as an insult. Xenophon regarded it as a sign of Agesilaos’ remarkable self-control that he did not destroy the trophy his enemies had set up at Lechaion to mark the massacre of the Spartans at the hands of Iphikrates’ peltasts (Hell. 4.5.10). The clear implication is that a lesser man would have thrown it down. This could actually happen if those who had set up a trophy were no longer able to protect it: the Milesians destroyed an Athenian trophy in 412 after the Athenian fleet left their land (Thuc. 8.24.1). Finally, if the outcome of a battle was disputed, both sides might set up a trophy (Thuc. 4.97.2–101.1; Xen. Hell. 3.5.24). In such cases, the markers signified the opposite of what they were supposed to—a continuing conflict rather than a victory.77 Truces were sometimes treated with similar cynicism. The Thebans repeat- edly tried to use the enemy dead as strategic bargaining chips,78 and Epamei- nondas is said to have used the truce as an opportunity to humiliate the Spar- tans at Leuktra by making them gather their bodies last, so that all their allies and enemies could see how many of them had died (Paus. 9.13.11–12). In two cases—although both reported only by later sources—the victors despised their defeated enemies so much that they refused to grant the truce at all.79 Nevertheless, both truce and trophy have long been regarded as genuinely agonal aspects of warfare, prescribing the correct behaviour of the Greeks. The truce was a self-imposed limitation of the brutal violence of Archaic warfare, showing a newfound respect for the dead. The trophy, meanwhile, was an 77 Thuc. 1.105.6, 4.134, 7.54; Xen. Hell. 7.5.26; Diod. 15.87.2. 78 Van Wees 2004, 136–137; Nevin 2008. 79 Namely, Lysander at Aigospotamoi in 405 (Paus. 9.32.9; this is neither confirmed nor contradicted by Xenophon) and the Lokrians after a skirmish with Philomelos in 355 (Diod. 16.25.2–3).\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 209 expression of the victor’s final possession of the battlefield; it represented one of the ways in which land warfare was formalised and restricted in space and time once the clash of phalanxes had become the typical way to fight a battle.80 The trophy was an inviolable assertion of both the end of the fighting and its winner. Neither could be called into question. Trophies therefore served as the great symbolic prize of a form of warfare in which control of the battlefield had become an end in itself. As such, trophies carried immense prestige; ancient authors used them as a shorthand for victory, conquest and glory.81 Their symbolic value provides the reason for the Greeks’ wrangling over who could rightly set them up and when.82 This interpretation, however, is incomplete. The features of the new form of battle may explain the date of the first trophies, their name, and their typical location on the battlefield,83 but they do not explain why they appeared. Why did the Classical Greeks consider it necessary to confirm the outcome of battles with a marker? Why would the possession of a field full of dead men matter to them? Why was there a need for any kind of formal custom here, when the distinction between victors and defeated was usually obvious either way? A possible explanation lies in the stretch of time between the ‘turning’ and the construction of the turning-point marker. While it may be naïve to take at face value the conventional grouping of trophy and truce as the final scene of many battle accounts, it is nevertheless clear that the trophy was not set up ‘as soon as the enemy had fled’.84 Whenever the sources give us any indication of the moment at which the trophy was set up, it is revealed that a significant amount of time had passed since the enemy was routed. Sometimes the victorious army had to march a long way back to the place where the rout had begun: 80 Garlan 1972, 40; Lonis 1979, 138; Vaughn 1991, 48; Sage 1996, 100; Ober 1999, 56; Lendon 2005, 42; Trundle 2013, 131–132; Lissarrague 2014, 58. 81 Note for example the boast that Isokrates put in Archidamos’ mouth, that the Spar- tans ‘filled Europe and Asia with trophies’ (6.54), Demosthenes’ allusion of the glory of Chabrias by reference to his trophies (20.83), and Plutarch’s story that Perikles’ friends measured his achievements by the number of trophies he set up (Per. 38.3). 82 Pritchett 1974, 273–275; 1985, 246, 248; Van Wees 2004, 137–138; Christ 2006, 110, 112–113. 83 Krentz (2002, 34) and Van Wees (2004, 183) have taken trophies as evidence for the rise of phalanx battle; in the fluid battles of earlier times, there was no single decisive ‘turning’ to be marked. 84 Jackson 1991, 239; this misconception is apparently shared by Bettalli (2009, 363) and Lissarrague (2014, 59, 61).\n\n210 chapter 6 … οἱ ἡττώμενοι τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἔφευγον πρὸς τὰ τείχη: ἔπειτα δ᾽ εἰρξάντων Κορινθίων πάλιν κατεσκήνησαν εἰς τὸ ἀρχαῖον στρατόπεδον. Λακεδαιμόνιοι δ᾽ αὖ ἐπαναχωρήσαντες, ἔνθα τὸ πρῶτον τοῖς πολεμίοις συνέμειξαν, ἐστήσαντο τροπαῖον. … the defeated first fled to the city wall; but when the Corinthians shut them out, they went back to their old camp. The Lakedaimonians, return- ing to the place where they first engaged the enemy, set up a trophy. xen. Hell. 4.2.2385 τούτου δὲ γενομένου οἱ Κορίνθιοι τοὺς νεκροὺς πρὸς τὸ τεῖχος ἑλκύσαντες καὶ ὑποσπόνδους ἀποδόντες τροπαῖον ἔστησαν. After this the Corinthians dragged the bodies to the wall, and, when they had given them back under a truce, they set up a trophy. xen. Hell. 7.1.1986 In some cases, the trophy was not set up until the following day, or even later.87 Despite its direct connection to the fighting effort of the hoplite body, the turning-point marker was not an instant celebration of a job well done. What was the victorious army doing in the intervening period? Obviously the use of captured armour for the trophy implies that the bodies of the enemy dead were being stripped. But this does not explain the passages above, which involve a considerable delay and a march back to the site where the turning-point marker was to be built. In fact, the previous section has made the activities of the victors abundantly clear, and Thucydides helps us connect the dots: καὶ ἡ ἄλλη στρατιὰ ἀναχωρήσασα μετὰ τοῦ Κλεαρίδου ἐκ τῆς διώξεως νεκρούς τε ἐσκύλευσε καὶ τροπαῖον ἔστησεν. The rest of the army, returning with Klearidas from the pursuit, stripped the dead and set up a trophy. thuc. 5.10.12 85 For similar scenes, see Xen. An. 6.5.31–32; Hell. 7.4.25. 86 This episode involved dragging the bodies over seven hundred meters to the city wall, and then going back over a hundred meters out from the wall to set up the trophy. 87 See for example Thuc. 1.105.6; 3.109.2; 8.24.1; Xen. Hell. 4.3.21; Plut. Tim. 29.2.\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 211 … ἐπακολουθήσαντες δὲ ἁθρόοι ὅσον ἀσφαλῶς εἶχε πάλιν ἐπανεχώρουν καὶ τροπαῖον ἵστασαν. [The Athenians] bunched together and pursued them as far as they safely could, and then turned back and set up a trophy. thuc. 6.70.3 Whatever the moral value of trophies, the pursuit was an overriding priority. If it was possible to chase the fleeing enemy, the trophy was never set up first. This order of business makes perfect sense if we accept that the pursuit was the intended result of Greek battles—but it should also make us rethink the concept of the trophy. What we effectively see in many surviving battle accounts is a victorious army going through all the possible stages of battle, including a pursuit carried on as long as daylight allowed, and only then setting up a trophy. No one stayed behind to do this while the others chased the fleeing enemy, even if the looting of enemy corpses had presumably already begun. The building of the trophy was invariably the last thing that happened. As long as the enemy had been decisively beaten, it did not matter if the construction of the turning-point marker had to wait until morning. The winners could build it at their leisure, and even make a show of it, as Agesilaos did at Koroneia, forming up his men with garlands on their heads as flute-players played (Xen. Hell. 4.3.21). What, then, did a trophy stand for? It clearly did not symbolise the end of the violence of battle; there are no grounds for the modern view that it represented a supposed Greek habit of limiting battles to the clash of the hoplites. In fact, its construction only after the end of the chase suggests the opposite—that it was meant to celebrate the final phase of battle most of all. Thucydides makes this very explicit: μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο Συρακόσιοι μὲν τῆς τε ναυμαχίας τροπαῖον ἔστησαν καὶ τῆς ἄνω τῆς πρὸς τῷ τείχει ἀπολήψεως τῶν ὁπλιτῶν, ὅθεν καὶ τοὺς ἵππους ἔλαβον, Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ ἧς τε οἱ Τυρσηνοὶ τροπῆς ἐποιήσαντο τῶν πεζῶν ἐς τὴν λίμνην καὶ ἧς αὐτοὶ τῷ ἄλλῳ στρατοπέδῳ. After this the Syracusans set up a trophy for the naval battle and for the hoplites they had cut off at the wall, where they captured the horses; and the Athenians set up a trophy for the infantry the Tyrrhenians drove into the marsh, and for their own pursuit with the rest of the army. thuc. 7.54\n\n212 chapter 6 This passage allows us to reconsider the meaning of trophies entirely. It describes in plain terms how these markers were built to memorialise mass killing. They are directly connected to each group of enemy warriors killed. In other words, they did not mark the successful completion of battle, but the successful completion of slaughter. The reference to the ‘turning’ in their name does not refer to the end of the fighting, but to the end of the enemy’s resistance and the beginning of unimpeded killing. Rabe has argued that the trophy was set up at the exact point where the losing side showed its inferiority, and the winners’ superiority was made clear.88 I would take this one step further: the turning-point marker not only established the superiority of the victors, but also celebrated their exploitation of this fact. The trophy, dressed up in arms that were stripped from the enemy dead, was an offering of the fruits of their brutal work. It symbolises the fact that the purpose of Greek battle, and the aim of Greek tactical thought, was not to rout the enemy, but to destroy him. This interpretation makes it easy to explain conflicts over the right to set up a trophy. If neither side felt they had been defeated to the extent that a trophy proclaimed, it would seem natural to challenge the enemy’s claim to have achieved such an outcome. An enemy trophy was a statement of power, a celebration of unrestrained bloodshed; its implied humiliation would inevitably serve as an occasional source for further conflict. The Spartans at Leuktra thought of interrupting the construction of the Theban trophy because their army still outnumbered the Theban force, and they did not agree that the losses they had sustained had been decisive (Xen. Hell. 6.4.14). In battles where both sides set up rival trophies, it was because both sides believed they should commemorate the losses they inflicted; for the Corinthians in 460, it apparently did not matter that twelve days had passed before they could safely march out to do so (Thuc. 1.105.6). In most cases, however, the defeated were made to acknowledge the victors’ status by force. The massacre itself, as conspicuous destruction, was meant to achieve this aim. If it could not, the victors possessed a great alternative in the form of the enemy dead. These bodies, as several scholars have pointed out, had to be recovered.89 Citizen warriors attached immense value to the proper treatment of every last one of their fallen peers; moreover, as Onasander makes clear, no troops would fight reliably without the assurance that, if they fell, their remains would be handled correctly (Strat. 36.1–2). We have seen how Nikias was willing to give up his claim to victory at Solygeia—his claim to have 88 Rabe 2008, 8. 89 Vaughn 1991, 39–40; Van Wees 2004, 138; Krentz 2007, 175; Rawlings 2007, 98–99, 193–194.\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 213 slaughtered the enemy with impunity—in order to recover the two bodies that remained on the beach (Thuc. 4.44.5–6; Plut. Nik. 5–6). The Athenian generals who won the battle of Arginousai were famously condemned to death because they failed to collect all of the dead (Xen. Hell. 1.7.4–34; Diod. 13.100.1–4, 13.101, 15.35.1). Their duty to the fallen meant that those who had lost control of the battlefield had no choice but to ask for a truce to retrieve the dead, and thereby accept the outcome of the battle and the construction of a monument to their suffering. Inevitably, the power this moral imperative gave to those who possessed the dead soon made that possession an end in itself. Tactical thought was promptly applied to the question how the enemy dead could best be secured. In the aftermath of First Mantineia, the Spartans formed up their army in front of the enemy dead (Thuc. 5.74.2); at Koroneia they moved the dead within their lines (Xen. Ag. 2.15).90 At Corinth in 369, as we have seen, Corinthian light troops dragged the bodies all the way to the cover of the city wall. In each case they were pointedly taken out of the enemy’s reach, forcing the losing side to request their return. In this way a defeated enemy could be compelled to recognise his loss and face humiliation.91 This recognition could serve as a neat substitute for the sort of undeniable victory that resulted from extensive massacre of the enemy—especially in cases like First Mantineia and Koroneia, where the pursuit was short and apparently fruitless.92 The truce was therefore not a limitation to Greek behaviour out of respect for the fallen, but a deliberate use of the dead as leverage in order to obtain the enemy’s formal admission of defeat. The phenomenon mentioned above of Thebans adding further demands before returning the enemy dead is really only a logical extension of this principle. The fact that the truce was normally granted shows only that, when it was requested, the enemy dead had served their purpose, and nothing further could be gained from holding on to them. In short, the truce—always requested by the defeated, never offered by the winners—was not a generous concession to the tacit rules of war, but a contrived display of power meant only to confirm the status of the victor and further humiliate the losing side. The trophy and truce, then, formed an interlocking set of customs meant primarily to broadcast the victors’ successful massacre of the enemy. None of 90 This detail does not occur in the parallel account of Xen. Hell. 4.3.21. 91 Pritchett 1974, 260–262. 92 At First Mantineia, Thucydides (5.73.1 and 4) tells us as much; at Koroneia it can be sur- mised from the surprisingly low death toll on the losing side (just six hundred according to Diod. 14.84.2; see Krentz 1985a, 18–19).\n\n214 chapter 6 this seems agonal or restrictive in the slightest. However, the Greeks appear to have been trapped in this abusive system due to their overriding moral obligation to take care of their own dead. Tellingly, no Classical Greek military treatise says anything about the rituals at the end of battle. While Aineias the Tactician, for example, is happy to discuss ways in which religious festivals could be used as an opportunity for a coup or a surprise attack (4.8, 17), and Xenophon reports several times how the Argives ‘pleaded the sacred months’ in order to escape Spartan ravaging (Xen. Hell. 4.7.2–3, 5.1.29),93 there is not a hint of the notion that post-battle truces could be used to one’s advantage in similar ways. The silence of military thinkers on this subject strongly suggests that here, for once, a restriction on military action was actually widely acknowledged and respected. If Onasander is right that the proper treatment of the dead was essential to maintaining troop morale, it follows that lost bodies simply had to be recovered, and no plan to take advantage of the enemy’s preoccupation with their own dead could be contemplated. Thucydides was outraged by the Theban refusal to return the bodies of the Athenians killed at Delion—even if he was equally incensed by the Athenian occupation and fortification of sacred ground during the same campaign.94 Only if they were considered guilty of some terrible crime, such as imperial cruelty or temple-robbing, could men be refused their right to a proper burial. ∵ In the decisive moment of battle, the hoplites’ amateurism caught up with them: untrained, uncontrollable and liable to panic, they could not be a dependable backbone for armies in battle, even if they were more suited for this task than any other troop type the Greeks were familiar with. The Greeks applied all their ingenuity to this problem, but the egalitarian values of the hoplite militia are likely to have been an obstacle to various improvements, which consequently only mercenary armies could make. With little scope for substantial change, militia commanders did everything in their power to keep the hoplites in the fight until the enemy’s morale could be critically weakened, whether by careful deployment, attrition, or the intervention of other troops. When the enemy broke, Greek armies revealed their true face. They were not proponents of fairness, fighting short and sharp battles for limited gain, 93 For further examples see Goodman/Holladay 1986, 153–154; Krentz 2002, 26 n. 14. 94 Thuc. 4.97–100; for Thucydides’ (partly selfish) motives in highlighting the episode, see Nevin 2008, 101–105, 111–115.\n\n‘no shortage of people to kill’: the rout and its aftermath 215 but butchers, seeking to do maximum damage to the enemy in his moment of weakness. This was their purpose when going into battle, and this was what they confirmed by setting up a trophy at the end. Even in victory, their preferred treatment of the enemy was to destroy their capacity to resist, and then to force them, in a humiliating ritual, to acknowledge that they had lost.\n\nConclusion The Context of Tactical Thought A great deal of scholarship has appeared in recent decades to challenge the old notion that the Greek way of war was agonal, rule-bound, circumscribed by cultural conventions that restricted its form and scale. Neither the view itself nor its socio-political underpinnings now remain uncontroversial. Yet the revisionists have rarely discussed tactics in detail, and there has been no synthesis of recent scholarship applied specifically to its famous peculiarities. The present work has tried to fill that gap. Radical reinterpretations of the structures and values that shaped Greek warfare invite a new analysis of its tactical principles, and I have tried to build such an analysis from the ground up. How do we characterise the tactical thought and practice of the Classical Greeks? What ideals and what realities shaped their approaches to battle? The context of tactical thought is an essential element of the answer. The specific problems to which tactical thinking is applied are set by military reality—and at the beginning of the Classical period that reality had been recently and drastically altered by developments in the political and economic organisation of Greek city-states.1 While mass levies of infantry were already a feature of warfare in the Archaic period, it was not until the very end of the sixth century that large hoplite armies first appeared on the scene. From this time on, the hoplite body purged other troop types from its lines and began to develop an increasingly regular formation. Cavalry, specialist light troops, and the hoplite phalanx itself were therefore relatively new and unfamiliar features of warfare at the time of the Persian Wars. The shape of battle had changed beyond recognition. For the first time, citizen levies were organised around a substantial core of heavy infantry that collectively engaged the enemy in close combat. City-states now relied on these hoplites to win their battles, as they had done in spectacular fashion when the Persians invaded Greece. Nothing could therefore be more fundamental to Greek tactical thought than the fact that the hoplite militia was completely untrained. Throughout the Classical period, they remained ignorant of formation drill; they were not subdivided into manageable tactical units, so that even their lowest-ranking officers led groups of several hundred men. They appear to have known how to form up in ranks and files in preparation for battle, but they could not 1 For the essential account see Van Wees 2013, 236–244. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2018 | doi: 10.1163/9789004355576_009\n\nconclusion 217 move without breaking formation, and never learned to manoeuvre as one. No official programmes existed for the practice of weapon proficiency either, so that hoplites knew little more about using their equipment than what they were willing to learn by themselves—and their enthusiasm for such private instruction was low. The rich may have treasured athletic training, but it was of doubtful value in war unless it followed very particular guidelines; meanwhile, specifically military training was ridiculed as a pointless exertion that only encouraged arrogance and false expectations. Most Greek citizens learned how to fight from their sparse experience alone. Their states counted on generals to win battles with armies made up of amateurs who improvised all aspects of war. In this environment, Sparta was the embodiment of the proverb that in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. The military abilities of the Spar- tans are easily overstated; like other Greeks, they fielded a militia army led by amateur officers, whose methods were informal and unregulated, and whose obedience was not guaranteed. They appear to have disdained weapons train- ing, focusing their exercise programme exclusively on fitness and endurance; they only drilled their men in a few basic formation evolutions once they were already on campaign. Nevertheless, they derived an enormous advantage from the fact that they bothered to organise and train their men at all. Their ruth- less upbringing made Spartans willing to accept military authority where it was needed; they were used to following orders issued by their detailed offi- cer hierarchy, and they recognised the value of measured collective action in battle. Subjects and allies who fought at their side were required to follow suit. The result was an army that, unlike any other Greek force, could march in step, obey the commands of the general in battle, and manoeuvre en masse. Their training made Spartan-led forces capable of a few simple but essential feats of tactical prowess that only the most experienced and dedicated Greek armies ever learned to match. With these forces, the Spartans caused a dangerous imbalance in the Greek tactical system. The writings of Thucydides, Xenophon and Plato show that oth- ers were very aware of this imbalance; they described precisely what made the Spartans so effective, and Xenophon in particular went out of his way to adver- tise Spartan methods to his audience. Both Xenophon and Plato envisioned an ideal world in which the militias of other states would adopt a similar sys- tem of training and discipline. This training effort would correct the imbalance, reduce the uncertainty of battle, and give ambitious city-states an edge in their ongoing wars against other Greeks. Yet the efforts of these tactically minded authors were in vain. The hoplites of the Greek world chose to believe that, for the rare occasions when they were called upon to fight a pitched battle, valour and strength would suffice. They\n\n218 conclusion saw greater value in the courage to charge the enemy lines than in the skill to do well when they got there. They consequently rejected the hard work of drill, laughed at those who trained for battle, and attacked generals who tried to impose discipline either in court or in person. Only the most persistent and inspiring commanders had any hope of convincing their men to commit to basic military training. A few states eventually raised small standing units of hoplites, but we do not know what instruction they received. It was not until the very end of the Classical period that a mandatory training programme was finally introduced at Athens. As a result, all Greek tactical thought outside Sparta arose from a context of self-imposed, ideologically reinforced amateurism. The average hoplite mili- tia preferred to remain a cumbersome mass of warriors—yet this mass, the people in arms, had to be preserved at all costs. Modern scholars have often characterised Greek armies as collections of highly trained and effective heavy infantry led by generals whose notion of tactics was primitive, and whose role consisted of nothing more than leading the hoplite charge. The opposite seems closer to the truth. Generals whose understanding of tactics may have been comprehensive were forced nevertheless to adopt the crudest of approaches to battle and to risk their own lives in frontal assaults because their men were incapable of anything more sophisticated than that. Greek tactics, in short, were necessarily limited. Commanders and tactical theorists faced severe structural problems of organisation, skill and discipline, and they could rely on little more than their own ingenuity to tackle them. This is reflected in the battle accounts we find in the sources. We should bear this context in mind whenever we find tactical elements that appear at first sight to be primitive or restricted. A New Model of Hoplite Battle In the second half of the nineteenth century, the Prussians drew up a template of phalanx battle intended to sum up the tactical forms of major engagements from the beginning of the Classical period down to the time of Epameinondas. What they created was a simplified narrative of Greek tactical developments— a straightforward progression from primitivism to Alexander—which served their conceptual and didactic purposes. Yet the template stuck. For decades it was repeated and refined in all major works on the subject, and to this day there are those who insist that all hoplite battles essentially took the same form. Two armies met at a prearranged time on a specially selected patch of flat land; both lined up all their hoplites in monolithic formations, eight ranks deep, with their\n\nconclusion 219 best troops on the right. In the advance, both armies drew to the right, so that each right wing ended up surrounding and routing the enemy’s left. The two victorious right wings proceeded to either face off for a decisive second clash, or to go home, content with their partial victories. There was no pursuit. Light infantry and cavalry were deliberately excluded from these battles. They were fair, open, ‘short and sharp’ engagements of hoplite phalanxes, by which whole wars were decided in an afternoon. This model has little to recommend it. While each point can be supported with some examples, to claim that any of them were standard practice is to disregard the bulk of the evidence. One of the structural problems of much modern scholarship on Greek warfare has been its tendency to build its theo- ries and assumptions on this set of unjustifiable generalisations. But is it pos- sible to update the model? Can we create a new, more accurate template that describes the usual features of Greek battle in similar detail? If our aim is to draw the various units and their movements in neat coloured blocks and arrows on a tactical map, the answer is no. The deployments and formation depths used by the Greeks are too varied, and our detailed exam- ples too few, to allow for any schematic rendering of a ‘normal’ engagement between Classical armies. We may know enough about a handful of major bat- tles to sketch diagrams of the combatants’ dispositions and manoeuvres, but the result would only testify to their diversity; in most cases, we simply do not have all the data we need. Even Hanson, the most passionate defender of the view that Greek warfare was bound by strict rules and conventions, has con- ceded that in this sense ‘there is no typical hoplite battle’.2 Yet this is not the only possible approach to the question. We should not be tempted, like the Prussians, to make Greek warfare conform to the terms and visualisations of the contemporary military academy. There are other, more abstract ways in which the Classical Greek approach to battle clearly did follow certain patterns. These patterns are already visible in Herodotos’ description of the Persian Wars, and they remain consistent all through the works of Thucydides and Xenophon. They resulted from the context of amateur warfare described above, and from the efforts of commanders and tactical thinkers to work effectively within that context. The following summary of these patterns constitutes what I believe to be the closest we can get to a new model of hoplite battle. First, Greek armies intending to fight a battle would do everything in their power to ensure that the odds were stacked in their favour. To fight fairly 2 Hanson 2013, 267.\n\n220 conclusion was to court disaster; if the decision came down to sheer force of arms and will, all would depend on the untrained hoplite levy, and victory could not be guaranteed. Fair fights in the open were therefore avoided wherever pos- sible. Armies sought to face the enemy on favourable ground, with superior numbers, and with supporting forces coming up from behind. Catching the enemy off guard was known to be particularly effective, and so battles were begun without warning, sometimes from a hidden position, and ideally when the enemy was entirely unprepared. Alternatively, cunning generals would try to compel their enemies to rush into a fight at place and time of their choos- ing. Most pitched battles involved some manipulation of their time and place to the greater advantage of either side. If many of them still ended up being fought on plains, with both sides having time to deploy, it was only because armies would normally refuse to engage an enemy whose advantage was clear; sometimes the odds had to be levelled to some extent if a battle was to take place at all. In such cases, a second priority took over: safeguarding the hoplite phalanx. The phalanx formed the backbone of most armies in battle, but it lacked training, organisation and discipline; it was vulnerable to missiles, liable to panic, and easy prey if it fell into disorder. Moreover, when hoplites marched into the plain, they were out of their comfort zone. In open ground, horsemen had the advantage over all other troop types. Only the tight cohesion of a hoplite formation gave it any chance at all against mounted attack. If the battle was to hinge on them, the hoplites needed protection. The best option was to draw up the heavy infantry in a single line from one protective terrain feature to another. Plains narrowed by hills, rivers, marshes or walls were favoured positions. If such deployment was impossible, the hoplites could rely on the other detachments of their army. Phalanxes practically never went into battle unsupported; most armies contained sizeable contingents of light troops, often including some smaller units of specialist peltasts or archers, and many would bring their own cavalry to the fight. It is a commonplace of modern scholarship that the Greek historians looked down on such troops and neglected to mention their contributions, but in fact they report on their actions and strengths repeatedly and in detail. Light infantry, the bane of unsupported hoplites, could serve as a protective screen or cover the flanks of the phalanx. Horsemen were invaluable as a guard against their counterparts in the enemy army, and frequently played a decisive role, whether on the march or in battle. Once the integrity of the line and the flanks of the phalanx were secured, the next priority was to come up with a plan to defeat the enemy. This point may\n\nconclusion 221 seem entirely obvious, but it is important to emphasise that Greek comman- ders appear to have assessed each upcoming battle according to its particular circumstances and challenges. Militia armies did not have the training to per- form even the most basic manoeuvres in battle, so most plans consisted of little more than drawing up the troops in a certain order and depth and sending them forward—yet even here, the Greeks made deliberate choices each time, rather than relying on a restrictive traditional template. The plans they came up with may be grouped into two basic forms. The first, perhaps the older of the two, was to outflank the enemy with the naturally extended right wing of the phalanx and roll up his line. This plan generally involved the commander placing himself and his leading contingent on the right wing, where they would obtain the glory of victory. The second plan was to engage the enemy’s best troops head-on, in the hope of breaking them and forcing the collapse of the enemy army. Such a plan required the general and his most reliable troops to take up a position opposite the enemy’s main contingent, wherever that contingent happened to be. As a result, some of the earliest battles of which we have a detailed description already show armies being led from the left wing or from the centre. The question of honour in the deployment of contingents in a phalanx appears to have depended entirely on which plan was chosen; whichever unit would get to claim a greater share in the victory would consider its position one of honour. At some point during the fifth century, it was discovered that a deeper for- mation yielded more reliable results in either scenario. Depth usually formed an effective remedy to the skittishness of the hoplite levy; at the same time, a formation that appeared unlikely to break under pressure would have a great psychological impact on its opponents. Coupled with the need to protect the flanks of the phalanx, this discovery resulted in one of the defining dilemmas of Greek tactical thought—the search for the perfect balance between width and depth. Throughout the Classical period, the problem remained unresolved, and no standard depth was ever declared. There were other ways, however, in which generals tried to respond to the basic scenarios sketched here. Commanders were handicapped by the fact that they had almost no control over the large and semi-autonomous contingents of their line, and that the militia was not trained to respond to changing orders even if those orders could somehow be passed down. However, smaller units could be directly controlled, and carefully coordinated groups of a few hundred infantry or cavalry could have a disproportionate impact in battle. Generals therefore did what they could to anticipate the enemy’s tactical plans, and to use ever more professional and capable detachments of elite troops to sabotage those plans. From the Persian Wars onward, we see skirmishes and\n\n222 conclusion battles being decided by the timely arrival or well-directed charge of picked hoplite units and horsemen. Forces trained by Spartans were the only ones capable of manoeuvres on a larger scale. As long as the chain of command remained intact, this ability gave them a great advantage in battle against less organised hoplite militias. Yet we should not be tempted to overstate Spartan exceptionalism in terms of tactical thought; for the most part, Spartan armies followed the same patterns in battle as the forces of other Greek city-states. Spartans, too, sought to engage in a favourable place at a favourable time; they too relied on terrain features and support troops to safeguard their phalanx; they too picked one or the other of the two basic plans that determined the shape of hoplite battle. The main difference was that their phalanx was much better prepared to play its part. As long as the vulnerability of the hoplite body compelled all sides to manipulate the battle so that nothing could interfere with its advance, Spartan- led armies had a structural advantage over all their opponents. Several battles were decided by the ability of Spartan levies to respond to the circumstances of battle with sweeping manoeuvres carried out by thousands of men at once. More often, though, the decisive element was not their tactics, but the terrifying sight of their approach. Hoplite levies—untrained, poorly organised and led by brave example—behaved unpredictably in battle; the hoplites’ awareness of their dependence on each other made them unlikely to stand their ground if they noticed any part of their line giving way. Phalanx battle therefore hinged on morale. Many Greeks thought fighting skill so secondary to courage that they did not find it worth cultivating at all—but these Greeks were wrong, because a display of Spartan discipline and tactical skill could quickly deflate the courage of the average hoplite. In this way the Spartans warped the typical course of Greek battle to such an extent that they regularly won without having to strike a single blow. Once the enemy had been put to flight, however—and despite Thucydides’ claim to the contrary—the Spartans seem to have fallen once again into the same pattern followed by other Greeks: the ruthless pursuit and slaughter of their defeated enemies. Of all the elements of battle, this one comes closest to being a general rule. It was so universally and enthusiastically carried out that we should regard it as the tacit goal of every pitched battle. The Greeks seem to have wanted nothing more than to take advantage of the enemy’s moment of helplessness and inflict maximal damage at minimal risk. First, the embat- tled hoplites vented their frustration on anyone they could catch. Then, light infantry and horsemen—at times held back for this very purpose—chased the scattered enemy as far as they could, killing at will. Only the arrival of reinforce- ments, the proximity of friendly city walls, or the fall of night could save them.\n\nconclusion 223 When the massacre was over, the victors set up a trophy to celebrate the achievement. This monument marked the point at which the danger dissipated and the unopposed killing began—the point at which tactics had achieved their intention and the victors could reap their reward. The defeated, mean- while, were put in a difficult position by the pressing need to recover the bodies of the fallen from ground they no longer possessed. This universal obligation was exploited by the victors, who sometimes forcibly took control of the dead in order to use them as a guarantee that the enemy would acknowledge their claim to victory. Far from a generous and gentlemanly act of respect for the dead, the granting of the truce was therefore only a way to obtain formal and symbolic confirmation of what tactics and slaughter had achieved. These were the typical features of pitched battle during the Classical period. Taken together, they add up to a reasonably comprehensive new model of the principles that shaped such engagements. Where their focus overlaps, the contrast with the old model is striking. Not only does the Prussian model appear clearly and consistently inaccurate, but on a number of points our sources actually suggest the exact opposite of its claims. Instead of prearranging battles, the Greeks often struck when it was least expected. Instead of fighting on open plains, they tried to bait their enemies into attacking a strong position, or at least tried to find ground that would cover their flanks and their retreat. Light troops and cavalry, far from being irrelevant to hoplite battle, actually shaped and defined it by their complete superiority over hoplites in any but the most carefully restricted conditions; our modern impression of a way of war dominated by hoplites is largely the result of Greek tactical skill at securing these conditions for their hoplites’ sake. Moreover, in the aftermath of battle, heavy infantry could neither exploit a victory nor survive a defeat without the support of horsemen and missile troops. Finally, the pursuit, which the Prussians claimed had no place in the wars of the Greeks, appears to have been the greatest hope and desire of all Greek armies that resolved to fight a battle. Still, few of the elements of this new model are so singular in nature or so consistently attested that they could allow us to fill in the gaps of less detailed battle accounts with as much confidence as scholars using the Prussian model have often done. The conscious or unconscious use of the Prussian template as a prescriptive model has been the cause of much distortion in modern scholarship on Greek warfare. We have seen how this distortion has affected the historiography of the battle of Leuktra: scholars continue to presuppose groundbreaking innovations that appear to be little more than a self-inflicted mirage. The greatest flaw of the old model, then, is not its set of individual clauses, but its widely repeated claim to universality. If the summary of typical\n\n224 conclusion features presented here tells us anything, it is that the temptation to search for unwritten rules, rigid traditions and moments of revolutionary change should be firmly resisted. The viability of the new model therefore rests on the extent to which it accommodates different options. The only way to do justice to Greek tactical thought and practice is by acknowledging that Greek armies and their com- manders, though they operated within a broadly similar set of parameters, approached each battle as a unique problem. They assessed the capabilities of their enemies’ forces and their own, and acted accordingly. Variables such as terrain, the relative numbers of opposing armies, the identity of contingents present, the availability of missile troops and cavalry, and the extent of the enemy’s alertness meant that battles could take radically different forms. The goal, however, was always the same: to do massive damage to the enemy at the smallest possible cost in friendly lives. This point is crucial. If we ask ourselves to what extent Greek warring methods were defined by restrictive ideals, the answer offered by this model is clear: at no point until the formal end of battle did the Greeks allow their behaviour to be dictated by unwritten rules. Unfair advantages were actively sought; surprise attacks were common; deployments were chosen purely for practical reasons; commanders explored a range of tactical expedients in their constant attempts to outwit the enemy. Routing the opposing army was not the aim of battle, but the means to an end. That end was slaughter. From the choice of the moment of battle to the use of mobile reserves, the aim of all tactical decisions was to remove the enemy’s ability to fight back, and then to kill him. Fairness and deliberate limitations had no place in this kind of fight. Greek tactical thought was driven by pragmatism; the Greeks fought to win, and their ideal was to use their limited means with the greatest possible courage and ingenuity to achieve this. The Greek Way of War What does this analysis of tactics tell us about Greek warfare as a whole? For one thing, it shows the inaccuracy of the common developmental model in which a restrained and traditional form of fighting suddenly escalated into ruthless and bitter warfare during the drawn-out Peloponnesian War. With a few controversial exceptions,3 fairness was not a guiding principle of Greek 3 I am referring here to such things as the treaty banning missiles during the Lelantine War, which may or may not be historical (see especially Wheeler 1987), and the Battle of the\n\nconclusion 225 warfare in any period. The few general claims to the contrary that we find in the sources are patently rhetorical and false. Instead, from the first appearance of hoplite-heavy militia armies around the time of the Persian Wars, we see Greeks using such armies to win battles by any available means. By the early years of the Peloponnesian War, the common battle plans that resulted from this approach were already well enough understood that they could be anticipated and countered.4 The Classical period saw some modest steps toward profes- sionalisation, for example in the creation of standing units of epilektoi, and a few tactical innovations, like the cascading charge—but the Greeks ended the period with broadly the same military realities and tactical toolbox that they had at the beginning. What we see instead is city-states coming to grips with the new tactical sys- tem that emerged at the end of the Archaic period. Large hoplite armies had great potential, but they also posed new challenges of organisation and control, and their many weaknesses meant that a whole new approach to campaign and battle had to be constructed around them. The typical features of hoplite bat- tle gradually crystallised as the Greeks got into the habit. At the same time, however, they tried all expedients they could think of to exploit the vulnerabil- ities of the new system, and to perfect its elements to increase the chances of a successful outcome in battle. Some elements, such as the amateurism of the hoplite levy, could not be changed; they remained constant factors in Greek tactical thought and practice until the end of the Classical period. Other ele- ments, such as the need for cavalry and a dependable hoplite elite, resulted in the increasingly structural and often state-supported formation of specialist troops from either the citizen body or the mercenary market. Tactical needs were recognised, talked about, and responded to. Throughout the Classical period the Greeks got better at fighting the kind of battle the rise of homoge- nous unit types and combined arms warfare had dictated. The bigger picture, then, is one of Greek city-states lumbering into organ- ised warfare. They did not all do so at the same pace or by the same route; in some ways, Sparta was ahead of the rest for most of the fifth and fourth cen- turies. Still, generally speaking, the tendency was not towards a breakdown of traditional rules, but towards an increase of means to achieve the same destructive goals as before. As the Greeks learned to wield their large hoplite Champions, discussed in Chapter 3. The unifying theme seems to be that these attempts to impose restraint were limited in scope, unique, and (in the case of proposals to do battle with even numbers) spectacularly unsuccessful. 4 As Lee (2013, 144) put it, ‘the military systems that fought the Peloponnesian War were forged in the decades that preceded it’.\n\n226 conclusion levies—forming them up in phalanxes, supporting them with organised units of light troops and cavalry, and exploring the possibilities of reserves, manoeu- vre and training—they were increasingly forced to recognise that an effective army needed a strong command structure with a general who knew what he was doing, and a strong financial structure that could supply the army’s needs. Such realisations will have fuelled developments in state organisation and state control, which would in turn have influenced warring methods. An analysis of campaigns and wars in a wider sense is beyond the scope of this study. However, my conclusions on Greek tactics and tactical thought suggest what we might expect to find there—and the sources at first sight seem to support these suggestions. First, the vulnerability of the phalanx in open ground implies that pitched battle, far from being the only proper way to resolve conflicts, would have been seen as a gamble that a sensible commander would try his best to avoid. It was the least controllable type of engagement, and with the greatest potential for disaster. Greek awareness of the terrible risk involved is beautifully illustrated by Alkibiades’ boast that he ‘made the Lakedaimonians stake all they had on a single day’s fighting at Mantineia’ (Thuc. 6.16.6), and by the outrage of the Athenians, who, after the battle at Megara in 409, accused their generals of ‘playing dice with the city at stake’ (Hell. Oxy. 1.2). We should not be surprised, therefore, that pitched battles were rare. Campaigns described by Classical authors more commonly involved rav- aging, skirmishing with light troops and cavalry, ambushes, attacks on camps and exposed settlements, and other forms of warfare usually referred to as ‘irregular’. Second, if it is right that victory in battle was considered largely pointless if a massacre did not ensue, it should follow that pitched battles could not decide wars unless very severe losses were inflicted. Without a significant death toll, defeat in battle would only serve to enrage the losing side even more. Indeed, cases of single battles resolving entire conflicts are few and far between; more often than not, city-states defeated in the field would nevertheless let the war drag on. This observation in turn suggests that the goal of war was not to obtain a symbolic admission of inferiority in battle, but to devastate the enemy’s land and manpower to such an extent that they would submit to any demands. The aim of all military developments is therefore likely to have been to enhance the city-state’s ability to do massive violence in order to win its wars—whether through increased spending on standing forces and mercenaries, fortification of its borders, improvement of its siege techniques, or, in Athens’ case, through a two-year state-funded programme of military training for all citizens. All this casts serious doubt on the belief that hoplite battle was the defining feature of Greek warfare, and that this made the Greeks the founders of a\n\nconclusion 227 ‘Western way of war’, as Hanson famously argued in his 1989 bestseller. As we have seen, the development of Classical Greek tactical thought catered to their particular military realities and practices, the latter of which were not born out of lofty ideals but out of the pragmatic exploration of a newly emerging tactical system. In other words, their tactics are tied inextricably to their historical context. This context prescribed the avoidance of open battle, the exploitation of unfair advantage, and the infliction of crippling losses by any means. All of these features directly contradict Hanson’s ideal. In terms of combined arms warfare and the management of large armies, the Greeks clearly lagged behind the Persians, who might more plausibly be identified as the founders of a military tradition that privileged the deployment of maximum force in decisive pitched battle.5 The military treatises of the Classical period certainly fit within this bigger picture. They do not represent the bitter lessons of a new age of warfare—a fourth-century free-for-all in which sophisticated forms of fighting had become necessary instruments to ensure the survival of city-states. Rather, they reflect a military thought that answered precisely to the realities of war from the early years of the fifth century onward. The advice of military writers does not conflict with military practice, but confirms it; their treatises offer, not a bleak vision of a new age, but a constructive effort to spread ideas that had already proven their effectiveness. The pragmatic focus of Greek tactical thought suggests that it may have been demand for such treatises that caused them to appear.6 After all, these works served their military context—one in which victory had to be won with imperfect means, and any way to increase the chances of victory was worthy of consideration. In this sense, they were both the product and the symbol of a defining feature of the warfare of the time—the brutal pragmatism that was Greek tactics’ one and only rule. 5 Cawkwell 2005, 103–105; Konijnendijk 2012, 7–11. 6 Whitehead 1990, 36, 39–42.\n\nWorks Cited chgrw i = Sabin, P./H. van Wees/M.
