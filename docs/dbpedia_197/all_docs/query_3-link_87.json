        "text": "In Athenian honorific decrees of the 5th century, grants of proxenia appear formulaically together with the recognition of the honorands’ euergesiai. In IG I³ 125, however, despite the record of two lavish benefactions, Epikerdes from Kyrene is never proclaimed a proxenos. This aberration has been explained as Epikerdes’ unwillingness to become an Athenian proxenos, or him being one already, or some other Kyrenean holding the honor. This paper argues not only that our records contradict these three hypotheses, but also that the enigmatic case of IG I³ 125 allows for a reevaluation of the parameters governing grants of proxenia. Specifically, after an examination of all proxenic decrees where the honorands' citizenship is preserved, it appears that Athens, as the center of an empire, recognized the services of non-Athenians, but reserved proxenic honors only for citizens of political entities that would promote its imperial ambitions.\n\nThe purpose of my contribution is to delineate the distinctive features of the Athenian elites’ identity in the Late Antiquity and to investigate the possible connections between this elite and the monumental townscape. The literary and epigraphic documents show the existence of an oligarchy of families, that is at the guide of Athens in the 3rd and in the 4th AD. The distinctive features of this elite are the cult of the classical past and of the classical culture, the paganism, the ownership of political and religious offices in Athens and the euergetism towards the city. The importance of these values in the elite’s identity makes to me very plausible that its members were also responsible for the maintenance of the traditional representative monuments of the polis on the Athenian Agora. In fact, when the literary sources suggest a crisis of this aristocracy in the first half of the 5th century, these monuments are abandoned and replaced by new buildings. The citycentre seems to be now in the hands of another ruling class, that shows no interest in the preservation of the ancient monuments and has apparently different values. The Christian power has now reached Athens.\n\nAncient Greece, coinage, growth, limits, Solon, Xenophon In this essay I look for glimpses of growth ideology in Classical Athens, a society in the throes of monetisation. I ask whether the Ancient Greeks knew, in any meaningful sense, the growth paradigm-by which I mean the proposition that economic growth is good, imperative, essentially limitless, and the indispensable remedy for an array of social ills. The sources from which I prepare the argument commence in the Archaic period with Hesiod, and move on to Solon, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Xenophon and Aristotle. Through textual analysis I explore changing attitudes to wealth and accumulation in a society experiencing the expansion and diffusion of all-purpose money and coinage. Forming the core of the essay is a discussion of Xenophon's belief that silver mining opened a path to the infinite expansion of wealth. In this sense of money's limitlessness do we see a premonition of what in modernity became the growth paradigm? Perhaps. However, the economies of Classical Greece were not seedbeds of growth ideology. Xenophon's silver was intended for the polis, and not for continual reinvestment in capital accumulation.\n\nSilver mining helped transform Athens from a quiet backwater ca. 600 BCE to a dominant regional and naval power a little over a century later, but despite having large argentiferous ore deposits and being an early minter, she did not initially use much native silver for her coinage. In this paper I identify technical and geopolitical factors which explain this. I also explore the related and controversial questions of the extent to which the Athenian State benefited from the massive exploitation of the Laurion deposits, and the nexus between silver mining, monetisation of the economy, and political development."
