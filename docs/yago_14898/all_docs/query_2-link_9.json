        "text": "In 1817, in a small, stuffy legal office of a solicitor by the name of Derville, six law clerks confront a strange figure: an uncouth old man in a worn cloak, who has for the fifth time sought to gain entry to the space of the law. The immature clerks inform him that the solicitor only works during the night and suggest that he return at one in the morning. Once again the claimant leaves with his case unresolved. Curious of his identity, the clerks begin to argue amongst themselves: perhaps he is an old janitor, perhaps a nobleman or a brewer. One of them thinks the stranger looks as if he had just been exhumed. To settle the question, they open the window and shout that he should return. Once he has mounted the stairs yet again, the following exchange takes place:\n\n\"Sir,\" said Boucard, would you be so kind as to state your name so the director can know whether . . .\n\n\"Chabert.\"\n\n\"Do you mean the colonel who died at Eylau?\" asked Huré who, having said nothing so far, was anxious to join the general mocking.\n\n\"The very same,\" the man replied with a curious simplicity [avec une simplicité antique]. And left.\n\n(Balzac 1974: 311)\n\nThis odd encounter opens Honoré de Balzac's short novel Le Colonel Chabert. It puts on display an intricate dialectic of recognition and nonrecognition between the representatives of the law and the figurehead of Napoleon's Grande Armée. Seeking recognition by the law, Chabert is repeatedly rebuffed and fails to gain entrance to the legal institution, while the eventual recognition of his name by the clerk is immediately deemed an absurdity. The war is over, the Empire has ended, and Colonel Chabert is dead. And yet, there he is, seemingly exhumed from the soil and resurrected from the dead. As Chabert returns to civil society from the battlefield of Eylau, he appears as a memory of the Empire and a sign that the war is not over, that it continues to haunt the institutions of the civil order, and that it has now returned to stake its claims. With its play [End Page 83] of recognition and non-recognition, Balzac's story probes the relation between warfare and civil society. He asks whether warfare might serve as a schema or a prism for understanding the functioning of legal institutions and of social relations. When the figure of war appears on the doorstep of the law a process is set in motion that tests whether the foundation of civil society is one of legitimacy, order, and universality, or whether it is rather a matter of force, chance, tactics, and strategy."
