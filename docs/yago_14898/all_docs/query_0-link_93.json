        "text": "The Candidate (Michael Ritchie, 1972)\n\n6pm, FilmFour\n\nRitchie and his scriptwriter Jeremy Larner were 60s political campaigners, and this account of the education of an idealist has the authenticity of direct experience. Robert Redford, Ritchie's skiing champ in Downhill Racer, is the Kennedy-style candidate, an honest lawyer hoping to do good, happily unaware of the deals his campaign manager and team are making on his behalf. An intelligent, absorbing picture of inevitable compromise.\n\nLe Colonel Chabert (Yves Angelo, 1994)\n\n8pm, Sky Cinema 1\n\nRather sombre but involving historical drama based on a Balzac story. It stars a restrained Gérard Depardieu as the heroic Chabert who returns from the Napoleonic wars after wandering amnesiac for years. His wife, Fanny Ardant, has remarried, and Chabert's estate now belongs to ambitious Count Ferraud (André Dussollier).\n\nHeat (Michael Mann, 1995)\n\n9.30pm, Sky Movies 2\n\nMann's masterly gangster movie uses the familiar tale of cop chasing cunning criminal to set up a deadly contest between two of the screen's most charismatic performers: Al Pacino's driven detective cat-and-mousing with hood Robert De Niro in the coffee shop is riveting, as both recognise that they are two of a kind. The acting throughout is beefy and authentic, the action - a crackling city street shoot-out, the final confrontation at the airport - is superbly staged, and it's full of a melancholic air of tragedy.\n\nDark Blue World (Jan Sverák, 2001)\n\n10pm, Sky Cinema 1\n\nThe Czech director Sverák, who made the Oscar-winning last-days-of-communism comedy Kolya, pays tribute to his countrymen who fought in the RAF during the second world war. Ondrej Vetchy and his young pal Krystof Hádek are the heroic pilots who both fall for local girl Tara Fitzgerald: but this does the aerial duels rather more effectively than the ground-level romance.\n\n48 Hrs (Walter Hill, 1982)\n\n10pm, FilmFour\n\nA frenetic, funny tale of a mismatched duo: bad-tempered, gravel-throated cop Nick Nolte, and, making an inspired debut, Eddie Murphy as a fast-mouthed con on 48 hours' leave from the slammer. They are hunting an exceptionally nasty pair of villains through the deadly streets of San Francisco, but spend as much time cursing and thumping each other as the bad guys.\n\nPH\n\nSport\n\nLive Football\n\n7pm, Sky Sports 1"
