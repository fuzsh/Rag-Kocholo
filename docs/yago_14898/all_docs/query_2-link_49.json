        "text": "Festival guests, who personally present their works to audiences, have always contributed to shaping the special character of the Viennale. At this year’s festival we were once again able to welcome many important and exciting personalities of world cinema.\n\nA total of 129 directors and actors were present at the Viennale 2008. Among those who came to present their works and attend public talks and other festival events were: Khavn, Aysun Bademsoy, Jean-Claude Rousseau, Jacques Doillon, Arnaud Desplechin, Christian Petzold, Kelly Reichardt, Luc Dardenne, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Joseph Strick and Murray Lerner.\n\nWell-known musicians such as Garth Hudson and Vic Chesnutt were guests of the Viennale as well as the actresses Isabelle Huppert, Jeanne Balibar, Amira Casar and Arta Dobroshi.\n\nThe filmmakers John Gianvito and Miguel Gomes, to whom the Viennale dedicated a special program each, also\n\naccepted our invitation to come to Vienna for this occasion.\n\nMIGUEL GOMES\n\nBorn in 1972, in Lisbon, Portugal. Studied Cinema at Escola Superior de Teatro e Cinema (ESTC). Worked as a film critic in the Portuguese press and published several articles related to the theory of Cinema. In 2004 he shoots [/i]A Cara que Mereces[/i], his first feature length film.

After leaving school, Schroeter enrolled at the University of Mannheim to study Psychology, but completed only three semesters. After abandoning his university studies, Schroeter worked intermittently as a freelance journalist before enrolling at the Film and Television School in Munich where he remained for only a few weeks. In late 1967, after having begun to make short experimental 8mm films. In 1978, Schroeter moved into the realm of the 35mm feature film with Regno di Napoli. Schroeter begins to develop much more complex narrative techniques and strategies and tends to move away from the largely episodic structures. As a result, distribution of his films becomes much more viable and his films begin to reach a much wider audience. The first of these, Regno di Napoli is constructed as a family chronicle and is played out in and around a poor neighbourhood in the southern Italian city of Naples between the years of 1943 and 1972. For the first time in his filmmaking career, Schroeter adopts a chronological narrative structure, more easily digestible by a wider audience, but without ever abandoning his very idiosyncratic artistic vision.\n\nSeldom has the festival had more prominent and exciting personalities of world cinema as guests than at the V’07. A total of 130 directors, actors and other film guests came to the festival to present their works and attend public talks and other festival events.\n\nAmong them were:\n\nJANE FONDA\n\nBorn as in December 1937 in New York as daughter of Henry Fonda and Frances Seymour Fonda.

In 1972 she was awarded an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as the prostitute Bree Daniels in Klute. Fonda always lets influence her artistic work by her political and social engagement, for example in works such as THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY?, THE CHINA SYNDROME or in the repatriate drama COMMING HOME, for which she was awarded her second Academy Award. In the eighties also starts her dedication to sports and wellness. By the mid-eighties the actress finally takes back from film business.

After studying physics and crystallography at Cambridge University he won a scholarship to the Slade School of Art as a painter. Instead of painting, he chose the medium of film.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1969 Whitehead made five movies, beginning with the documentary that effectively launched his film career: Wholly Communion, about an historic counter-cultural event in the Royal Albert Hall on June 11, 1965 where an audience of 7,000 witnessed the first meeting of American and English Beat poets.\n\nIt was on the basis of this film that Whitehead was approached by the manager of the Rolling Stones to film the group on tour in Dublin and Belfast. Charlie is my Darling was the outcome. And it was the subsequent promo films he made for the Stones that mark the real birth of the \"music video\".\n\nIn the late 1970s Whitehead gave up film-making. He took up falconry. He has also written several works of fiction.\n\nFilms (selection): The Perception of Life (1964), Charly Is My Darling: The Rolling Stones on Tour (1965), Tonite Let’s All Make in London (1967), The Fall (1969), Fire In the Water (1977).\n\nAll in all, 95 film guests visited the VIENNALE 2005 who attended their films' screenings and were available for Q&A to the festival audience.

As a miniskirted Chelsea girl, Jane embraced the pop excitement of \"Swinging London\". Following in her mother's footsteps, she made her acting debut at seventeen. With nineteen she married composer John Barry, author of the James Bond 007 theme. After a first movie experience in Richard Lester's “The Knack”, she was hired by Michelangelo Antonioni who was shooting “Blow Up”, which later received the Palme d'Or Award at the Cannes international film festival. Her brief scene, where she appeared naked, created controversy and was the talk of London.\n\nAfter the failure of marrying too young and the birth of her daughter Kate in 1967, she decided to move to France. Recruited by French filmmaker Pierre Grimblat to star in his movie “Slogan”, she met and subsequently fell in love with her costar Serge Gainsbourg, a popular singer and musician. A fashionable couple on the Paris scene, they made the headlines in 1969 with a artfully disturbing song, “Je t'aime moi non plus”.\n\nIn 1981, she left Gainsbourg to live with the French director Jacques Doillon.\n\nJane Birkin's film career includes almost 100 films by directors like Bertrand Tavernier, Agnès Varda, and Jacques Rivette, playing besides collegues like Romy Schneider, Geraldine Chaplin, Dirk Bogarde, and Peter Ustinov.\n\nDANNY GLOVER\n\nDanny Glover attended the screening of Lars van Trier's new film \"Manderlay\" in which he plays a side role.\n\nGlover was born on July 22 1946 in San Francisco.

He had his first appearance in Don Siegel's Escape from Alcatraz (1979) with Clint Eastwood. In the following years he appeared in a number of less outstanding TV-productions, and also a few movies. His filmography of that time contains Spielberg's The Colour Purple (1985), Peter Weir's Witness (1984), and Lawrence Kasdan's western Silverado (1985). With the big box office hit Leathal Weapon by Richard Donner, Glover reached star status in 1987. Further films (selection): Beloved (Jonathan Demme, 1998), Freedom Song (Phil Alden Robinson, 2000), The Royal Tennenbaums (Wes Anderson, 2001), and Saw (James Wan, 2004).\n\nSTANLEY KWAN\n\nStanley Kwan presented his film Changhen ge (China/Hongkong 2005) und Yuen ling-yuk (Hongkong 1991/2005).\n\nHe was born in Hong Kong in 1957. Studied Mass Communications Science at Hong Kong’s Baptist College, before working in various positions in television. An assistant director from the early 1980s, he made his directing debut with Women in 1985. His third movie, Rouge, won him international reputation in 1988. Further films (selection): Red Rose, White Rose (1995), Yang +/– Yin: Gender in Chinese Cinema (1996, VIENNALE 96), Still Love You After All (1997).\n\nGERARD MALANGA\n\nThe Viennale screened a number of Malanga's film works in connection to the Andy Warhol Retrospective as well as presented a selection of his photographic portraits in an exhibition.\n\nGerard Malanga, poet, photographer, filmmaker, was born in 1943 and raised in the Bronx, New York, the only child of Italian immigrant parents. He is the author of a dozen books of poetry spanning a nearly 40-year period. He was a major influence on many of the paintings and films in Andy Warhol’s studio, known as the Factory. The \"New York Times\" called him \"Warhol’s most important associate\". Besides starring in several Warhol films, he and Andy Warhol collaborated on the nearly 500 individual 3-minute Screen Tests which resulted in a selection for a book of the same name, published by Kulchur Press in 1967. In 1969, he and Warhol founded \"Inter/VIEW\" magazine.\n\nPEDRO COSTA\n\nThe Viennale 2005 dedicated a Special Program to the Portuguese filmmaker.\n\nPedro Costa was born in Lisbon in 1959 He studied film directing and editing at the Lisbon Film School and first worked as assistant director for various Portuguese film productions. At the age of 30, he shot his first feature film, O sangue (1990), a dark family history. With his current cinematic work of three feature films and two documentaries, he ranks among the most radical and obstinate filmmakers of his generation.\n\nThe VIENNALE proudly welcomed 78 film makers and actors presenting their screenings followed by a Q&A. Among them were:\n\nLAUREN BACALL\n\nFollowing the advice of his wife, who had seen Bacall’s photo on the cover of the “Harper’s Bazar”, Howard Hawks casts her for To Have and Have Not. Bacall and her co-star Humphrey Bogart fall in love at this occasion and get married in 1945 - a dream couple attracting crowds of cinema-goers. After Confidential Agent, Bacall and Bogart play in The Big Sleep, Dark Passage and Key Largo. In 1953, she appears in her first successful comedy, How to Marry a Millionaire with Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable. Yet, she also convincingly performs in the melodramas The Cobweb by Vincente Minelli and Written On the Wind by Douglas Sirk. In January 1957, shortly after the shooting to Designing Woman has been completed, Humphrey Bogart dies.\n\nAfter a big Broadway-Carreer and a break of several years she plays in Barbra Streisand’s The Mirror Has Two Faces in 1996, bringing her the Golden Globe for best supporting actress. However sporadically, she is continuously seen on screen, for instance in Robert Altman’s Prêt-à-Porter or last in Lars von Trier’s Dogville and Jonathan Glazer’s Birth.\n\nOLIVIER ASSAYAS\n\nDespite their autonomy, Assayas’ films follow the Nouvelle Vague tradition. Instead of gearing themselves to Hollywood, the films relate to the French father generation and Asian cinema. Searching for a common denominator of Assayas’ films, one might come up with terms like sincerity or implacability. His figures’ problems carrying the burden of the author’s self-exploration are basically always existential. HANNELORE ELSNER\n\nIn the Seventies Hannelore Elsner became the main protagonist in German author films. In the Eighties, after the birth of her son, she acted in many popular TV series.
