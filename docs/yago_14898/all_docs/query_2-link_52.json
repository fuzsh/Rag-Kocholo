I accept with proud to be called simplistic, idealistic, or romantic – but I believe that love, family, marital good relations, children, and their interaction with society are the most important topics for films. Anyhow, I have tears in my times every time that I watch the last scenes of It's a Wonderful Life, and I have watched them at least 30 times, as I used to conclude my courses in business ethics with this film, proving at least in an ideal world, that you can be a family man, an ethical businessman, a pilar of your town's society, altogether as I have tried to be all my life. I am maybe poorer in Milton Friedman's neoliberal terms, but I do feel and so is my family that we are, as George Bailey in this film, the richest people in town!\n\nJ - Jailhouse Rock (1957) – US, The Jazz Singer (1927) - US, Jean de Florette (1986) - France, I was moved to tears by this film based on Pagnol's novel and its sequel Manon every time that I showed it to my students in business ethics courses, when we see that ethics does not prevail in business and in life and that the Cesars and Ugolins, played materfully by Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil, win them all – having respect and money although not always happiness, while the idealists as Jean de Florette – Gerard Depardieu, lose everything, at least before the sequel Manon. I have often the impression that all the world is a stage and all the men and women merely players, and God if he exists receive us all the Cesars, Ugolins, Jean de Florette and Manon, at the end of our show on earth congratulating us for our performances regardless if we acted the role of the villain or the saint. That is why secular ethicists are to be praised especially if they know that most of the time they lose and are not even rewarded in \"paradise\".

If I have to chose one film about business ethics it is undoubtedly L'Argent – as it comprises all the facets of ethics and corruption in business.

France, Les enfants du siecle/Children of the Century (1999) – France, I have seen many films on the wonderful love story of George Sand and Alfred de Musset and I have read their correspondence, and it still interests me every time, Les Faux-monnayeurs/The Counterfeiters (2010) – France, Les grandes familles/The Possessors (1958) – France, I have a profound disrespect to most of the \"grandes familles\", \"royal houses\", aristocrats, tycoons, politicians, proving once more the truth of the Hebrew saying: what is the difference between a mountain/Har and a minister/important people/Sar – the mountain seems small when you see it in the distance and huge when you see it close, with the minister/the tycoon/the aristocrat/politician/who's who – it is the opposite…, Les invasions barbares/The Barbarian Invasions (2003) – Canada, Les liaisons dangereuses (1959) – France, I may be fair in my conduct in business, with friends, with my wife and family, but it does not mean that I don't enjoy reading the most unfair conduct as in this wonderful book and film, watching gangster films as The Godfather, and films about greater than life crooks as L'Argent, Les Marchands de Gloire (1998) – France, Les Miserables (1998-UK), (2012-UK), (2002-France), (1935-US), (1934-France), (1982-France), (1958-France), I have seen many films on this book and I have enjoyed most of them, as I have enjoyed the novel, and all Hugo's masterpieces, Les parapluies de Cherbourg/The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) – France, Les 400 coups/The 400 Blows (1959) - France, I enjoy most films of the French Nouvelle Vague and this is one of their first movies, Les sorcieres de Salem/The Crucible (1957) - France, very few people have seen this film which is a masterpiece, far better than all the other adaptations of Miller's play to the screen, and to think that the French succeeded to depict the atmosphere of Salem in the US three hundred years ago just proves that a good film is really cosmopolitan, Les trois mousquetaires/The Three Musketeers (1921-US), (1948-US), (1961-France), (1973-UK), this immortal book was one of the best books that I have read when I was a child -
