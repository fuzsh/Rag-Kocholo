        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIn Paris, in February 1817, three years after the fall of the Empire, the lawyer Derville receives a visit from a shabbily dressed old man. He claims to be Colonel Chabert, believed dead at the Battle of Eylau in 1807. He had contributed to the victory by leading a famous cavalry charge against the Russians.\n\nThe old man tells how, waking in a mass grave surrounded by corpses, he survived his wounds.\n\nHe has returned ten years later and wishes to claim his title, to assert his rights and to live again with his wife. She, during his absence, has married Count Ferraud.\n\nShe refuses to recognise her first husband. Derville agrees to help the colonel by proposing a financial settlement with his ex-wife. She refuses and tries to manipulate her ex-husband. Chabert is not deceived, and disgusted by the corruption of men, he sinks into madness and misanthropy, putting an end to the divorce that he had wanted so much.\n\nRejected by his wife, and condemned for vagrancy, Colonel Chabert will finish his life in poverty in an asylum.\n\nCast\n\nGérard Depardieu : Hyacinthe Chabert\n\nFabrice Luchini : Maître Derville\n\nFanny Ardant : Countess Ferraud\n\nAndré Dussollier : Count Ferraud\n\nDaniel Prévost : Boucard\n\nOlivier Saladin : Huré\n\nMaxime Leroux : Godeschal\n\nÉric Elmosnino : Maître Desroches\n\nGuillaume Romain : Simonin\n\nPatrick Bordier : Boutin\n\nClaude Rich : Chamblin\n\nJean Cosmos : Costaz\n\nJacky Nercessian : Delbecq\n\nAlbert Delpy : Maître Roguin\n\nRomane Bohringer : Sophie\n\nValérie Bettencourt : Julie\n\nJulie Depardieu : A maid\n\nProduction\n\nDirection : Yves Angelo, assisted by Frédéric Blum\n\nScript : Yves Angelo, Jean Cosmos and Véronique Lagrange, from the novel by Honoré de Balzac\n\nProduction : Jean-Louis Livi and Bernard Marescot\n\nMusic : Régis Pasquier\n\nPhotography : Bernard Lutic\n\nEditing : Thierry Derocles\n\nScenery : Bernard Vézat (certain interior scenes filmed at Château de Bizy in Vernon, Eure)\n\nCostumes : Franca Squarciapino\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nCairo Film Festival (Egypt)\n\nWon: Golden Pyramid (Yves Angelo)\n\nCésar Awards (France)\n\nNominated: Best Actor – Leading Role (Gérard Depardieu)\n\nNominated: Best Actor – Supporting Role (Fabrice Luchini)\n\nNominated: Best Cinematography (Bernard Lutic)\n\nNominated: Best Costume Design (Franca Squarciapino)\n\nNominated: Best First Work (Yves Angelo)\n\nNominated: Best Production Design (Bernard Vézat)"
