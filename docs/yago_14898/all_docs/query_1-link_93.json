        "text": "\"GERMINAL,\" Claude Berri's epic, reverential screen version of the classic Emile Zola novel about striking coal miners, is as brutally honest as a $30 million movie can be. The poverty seen here is not pretty, but neither is it without a certain bleak appeal. Muted gray-brown tableaux are eloquent in their composition. A comely female miner wears off-the-shoulder rags and mines topless when the temperature gets high. Circumstances force this same miner to bathe in a kitchen washtub as her father and brothers devour their meager dinner. Naturally, being concerned with oppression and survival, the men are too busy to notice.\n\nWho says romance is a matter of love songs and long strolls in the moonlight? Surely \"Germinal,\" which opens today at the Paris Theater, is one of the most desperately romantic films ever made. It harks back fervently to the simpler world that was roused to outrage by the vividness of Zola's social realism. In that world, the rich are parasites, the poor are ennobled by their suffering and the solution is distant but within view. The film yearns passionately for such clarity, to the point where the black and white polarities of its politics are not compromised by subtler shadings.\n\nThough he spent little more than a week observing striking miners in northeastern France, Zola was able to transform his thousand pages of notes into an 1884 novel (the 13th of 20 in his Rougon-Macquart series) that came as a revelation to his readers. At that time, the truth about the exploitation of miners was not widely known. Shaped into the wrenching story of one family's struggle for survival and set against the broad canvas of the miners' uprising, that truth became as shocking as the idea that workers of the world might unite.\n\nThe journalistic impact of \"Germinal\" is theoretically unchanged, since Mr. Berri's film will be seen by plenty of viewers who have never been down a mine shaft. (\"Germinal\" is among France's all-time top 10 box-office hits.) But the hardships that Mr. Berri has rendered so faithfully now seem as artificial, in their way, as the Broadway musical version of \"Les Miserables.\" It's difficult for a film to pretend that real characters speak in the language of placards (\"We're hungry and tired of being poor!\" \"Why is the price of justice so high?\"). It's no easier to believe that Gerard Depardieu, despite another astonishingly honest and unaffected performance, could be a miner fighting off the threat of starvation.\n\nUnlike Mr. Berri's \"Jean de Florette\" or \"Manon of the Springs\" (or even Bernardo Bertolucci's \"1900,\" another handsome epic with a sternly polemical bent), \"Germinal\" does not allow its actors much room for nuance. The characters in this Gallic \"Grapes of Wrath\" are powerful but paper-thin. Mr. Depardieu appears as Maheu, the salt-of-the-earth father of a large brood and a foreman at Le Voreux mine, which itself is so important it is almost a living character. Miou-Miou gives a fiery performance as his valiant wife, Maheude, who has much reason to grieve during the latter part of the story.\n\nThe third principal in the miners' village (which is controlled by the mining company, like everything else about the workers' lives) is Etienne Lantier, the character linking \"Germinal\" to Zola's other novels in this series. As played by Renaud, a French singer and activist with the intensity of a firebrand graduate student, Lantier crystallizes the story's quiet fury. Arriving at Le Voreux in need of a job, he first observes the horrifying particulars of the miners' existence. (The film re-creates these details with impressive fidelity, from the miners' fear of firedamp to the cart horse that is lowered down the mine shaft.) Later, Lantier is central to the rebellion alongside Maheu, who becomes its unlikely leader.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
