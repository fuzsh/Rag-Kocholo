        "text": "GOOD OR BAD - FILM REVIEWS FROM AROUND THE WORLD\n\nI took my kids to see Bridge to Terabithia the other day, it's directed or produced by the same people who brought The Chronicles of Narnia to the big screen...anyway, it's starts off very well, very pure and uplifting, then suddenly out of the blue the most awful thing happens ( I won't tell you what just in case you were planning to go to see it, although I definitely wouldn't recommend taking small or sensitive children along with you!) And that's it, it just ends...unbelievable, I had to take my children out for a pizza afterwards to cheer them up\n\nI would like to strongly recommend a film that I saw last night. It is\n\ncalled \"Water\" directed by Deepa Mehta.\n\nIt is story of the fate of widowed women in 1938 India, so on the\n\nsurface it is film about social reform and the plight of the\n\nunder-privileged. But. of course, it is also a film about hope and\n\nascent and being the beautiful lotus in the polluted water.\n\nThe film speaks about the fact that real change and ascent is often\n\nsomething gifted to the next generation and not for oneself. This may\n\nnot be the case now with Self Realization, but still the point is\n\nselfless struggle is for the benefit of others.\n\n\"Water\" was at first filmed in India, but the production was disrupted\n\nand closed down by Hindu fundamentalist, no doubt angered by the film's\n\nquestioning of the dictates of the established order, that widowed\n\nwomen are untouchables and less than whole.\n\nEventually the film was remounted and shot in Sri Lanka. It was filmed\n\nsimultaneously in both English and Hindi, resulting in two movies, but\n\nit was the Hindi that has been released. (Both are available on DVD.)\n\nIn appearance, this is an Indian film. It even includes about five or\n\nsix songs in the Indian fashion, but not sung by the actors. (The songs\n\nare composed by A.R. Rahman of \"Lagaan\" fame.)\n\nBut this is not an Indian film. It is Canadian! And I would even dare\n\nto say that it is the best Canadian film ever made â€“ deep, subtle and\n\nquiet and a beautiful thing to be remembered. It is directed by an\n\nIndian-born filmmaker who has made her career in Toronto (often with\n\ncontroversial and questionable films), but now has risen to produce\n\nsomething really great.\n\nMy other feeling in watching this movie was, \"Why aren't Indians making\n\nfilms like this? Why does it take the Canadian government (through\n\nTelefilm Canada) to finance this film (twice)?\"\n\nThis film is certainly not Bollywood, it is in the rich tradition of\n\nSatyajit Ray, the great Bengali filmmaker and student of Rabindranath\n\nTagore.\n\nIn the last scene we see Gandhi speaking, \"I used to think that God is\n\nTruth,\" he says. \"Now I know Truth is God.\" To stand up for Truth is to\n\nbe that fragrant lotus in the dirty water.\n\nThe film has done well in Canada, but is certainly not in the\n\nmainstream of awareness, and is now being distributed theatrically in\n\nthe US and other countries. You can probably watch the trailer on the\n\ninternet. Try:\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/water/\n\nRICHARD - CANADA\n\nElizabethtown - 7 Not a bad film until Susan Sarandon gets on the stage and really makes you cringe\n\nBambi Two - 8 - At last Disney has made a reasonable follow up to a classic; a sweet story cleverly set in the period between the death of Bambi's mother and the sprouting of his antlers.\n\nTHE CAYMAN - Don't know if this film has been released outside of Italy but if you want to know what half of the coutry thinks of Berlusconi this might give you an idea - 8 boring for kids\n\nSERENITY - Telepathic girl escapes from evil federation and helps rebels fighting cannibalistic berserkers; sounds a bit like Star Wars but it's quite original sci-fi - 8\n\nTHE CURSE OF THE WERERABBIT - Wallace and Gromit strike again, brilliant, as usual, though not quite up to the standard of WRONG TROUSERS - Lots of hidden gags - 8\n\nPAYCHECK - GREAT SCI-FI THRILLER FROM THE PEN OF PHILIP K DICK (BLADERUNNER) 8\n\n(SLIPSTREAM) - Unlikely scientist (Sam from LOTR) invents a time machine that can take you back ten minutes - lots of swearing but interesting idea - 8\n\nTHE ISLAND - Very interesting sci-fi story about clonation - 8\n\n((CRASH)) Definitely NOT for children. Very interseting film that explores racism amongst a group of apparently unconnected people in the US. Some ingenious twists - 9\n\nLAVA GIRL AND SHARK BOY - 8 Sort of Spy Kids meets Wizard of Oz type film, very enjoyable good for kids up to about 13\n\nHOWLS MOVING CASTLE - Very different Japanese cartoon. Long, quite complicated but a great story - 9\n\nPRIDE AND PREJUDICE 7 Oh dear, find it hard to say anything good about this film, the BBC adaptation with Colin Firth was infinitely better as was Lawrence Olivier's masterpeice\n\nHITCH HIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY - Difficult film to make but not a bad job. If you like whacky humour this is right up your street - 8\n\nNARNIA - You could find quite a few things to criticize but for me it was , quite simply, magical 10\n\nHARRY POTTER 4 - An excellent job from one of the weaker books, roared with laughter in some parts! A bit heavy towards the end - 9\n\nELLA ENCHANTED - MONTY PYTHON MEETS SHREK TYPE ADVENTURE - BRILLIANT 9/10\n\nGAIA - ANOTHER NICE ONE FOR THE KIDS, A BIT DIFFERENT BUT GOOD FUN\n\nBATMAN BEGINS - MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED, ORIGINAL STORY 8 or 9\n\n(VERONICA GUERIN) - TRUE STORY OF AN IRISH JOURNALIST WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE DUBLIN DRUG BARONS, VERY MOVING - 9\n\nWILLY WONKA - I WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS FILM, JOHNNY DEPP IS MARVELLOUS BUT ITS VERY SIMILAR TO THE GENE WILDER VERSION AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE B MOVIE LEVEL 7/10\n\nOLIVER TWIST - SAY WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT POLANSKI, BUT HE HAS REALLY WORKED HARD HERE - THE RESULT IS VISUALLY EXCELLENT 9/10\n\n(SEVEN SWORDS) - UNDHARMIC, BORING AND MUCH TOO LONG 3/10\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN - where a woman mourns her dead son only to be told that she never had a child....................Interesting film - 8\n\nSHAOLIN SOCCER Mixture of kung fu and Chinese humour Simple plot, very entertaining for the family 9\n\nTHE REVENGE OF THE SITH - Last of the Star Wars series. Very interesting for those who can remember the other five, rather dark for younger viewers 7\n\nBRIDE AND PREJUDICE - Jane Austen goes to Bollywood! If you can bear the dancing you'll love it - 8\n\nNATIONAL TREASURE - Disney, not too bad but fairly ungripping - 7\n\nFINDING NEVERLAND - Thought it would be boring but loved it! - 9\n\nHELL BOY - Don't let the title put you off, okay it's a little devil to begin with, but he grows up on the side of the goodies, actually it's rather a sweet film, maybe a bit scarey for under 12s and a bit gothic but has a lot of heart\n\n(INTERSTATE 60) - Weird 'on the road' film, definitely not for kids but very different and intriguing.\n\nSHALL WE DANCE' - Much better than I expected, Richard Gere is taught to dance by Jennifer Lopez!\n\nHONEY - Bit similar to save the last dance but more dharmic, good fun\n\n(Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind )- One of those impossible to remember titles. The stories is not so dharmic but rather intriguing. Jim Carey's girlfriend has all memories of him removed from her mind, so he decides to do the same but..............\n\nNICHOLAS NICKLEBY - Lovely adaptation of the Dickens classic, some weaker actors but hugely enjoyable.\n\nPOLAR EXPRESS - Bit experimental but, for me, it worked, particularly liked the representation of Father Christmas, a bit alien/deity like instead of the usual kindly old man.\n\n(HEAD OF STATE) Lots of bad language but the film has heart,it's about the attempt to elect a black president in the US.\n\n(NOEL) - Not the sentimental Christmas film you might expect, has some quite weird moments, not for kids, will make you cry.\n\nSHREK 2 EXCELLENT! EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST - 9.\n\nSPIDERMAN 2 - BIT SLOW TO START WITH BUT GOT GOING LATER VERY GOOD - 8\n\nFAHRENHEIT 9 11 - Interesting documentary, very boring cinema! -\n\nKING ARTHUR, QUITE GOOD FUN, SHAME THEY HAD TO PUT THE INEVITABLE 'LOVE' SCENE - 7 .\n\nI ROBOT - EXCELLENT, WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A BIT MORE STREET FIGHTING BUT OTHERWISE VERY ENJOYABLE - 8\n\nTHE DAY AFTER TOMORROW-VISUALLY EXCELLENT, CHILLING STORY!\n\nTHE WHALE RIDER - SUPRISINGLY GOOD!\n\nHAUNTED MANSION - GOOD FUN\n\nMASTER AND COMMANDER - SUPERB FILM, EXCELLENT ATTENTION TO DETAIL\n\nKANGAROO JACK - SILLY AND SUPERFICIAL GOOD FUN!.\n\nTHE MIGRATORY PEOPLE 8 BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHY, LET DOWN BY COMMENTARY.\n\n(THE MAGDALENES) - HEAVY ANTI-CATHOLIC IRISH FILM, WORTH SEEING\n\nELF: 8 Starts out looking really naff but improves later on. Not really for over tens (unless you're 45!)\n\n(XXX) APART FROM A FEW SCENES IT WOULD BE A GREAT FILM\n\nSNOWDOGS - 10 Brilliant family fun\n\nPIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 9 LOOKS A BIT WEIRD BUT ACTUALLY IT'S GREAT FUN FOR ALL THE FAMILY\n\nTHE CORE 8 Enjoyable adventure film with no love scenes\n\n(DAREDEVIL) 5 Violent, Gothic, with one love scene, unnecessarily dark, finishes badly\n\nCHANGING LANES - Very Interesting film about the Agnya!\n\nCLOCKSTOPPERS 8 ENJOYABLE AND HARMLESS TEEN S.F.\n\nBALLISTIC - BORING AND PREDICTABLE\n\nSNATCH - REALLY GROSS, FULL OF SWEARING AND VIOLENCE AND QUITE FUNNY\n\nSPY KIDS 3 DISAPPOINTING AFTER THE FIRST TWO FILMS, 3D GLASSES IRRITATING\n\nLuther - is produced partly by the Lutheran church but is quite an interesting drama and very critical of the Vatican (starring Joseph Fiennes)\n\nCrash (Collision) - An episode film in the style of Magnolia or Grand Canyon (that both are excellent too), written and directed by the writer of Million Dollar Baby, Paul Haggis (very nice man), is definitely an adult movie and tells about different characters in Los Angeles, tackling the subject of racism and our difficulty to deal with others in a subtle, not black-and-white way.\n\nFor young yogis, there is some fun to be had with more clever teenage dramas, notably Saved - a very quirky comedy of believers in a Christian high school (but adult themes so not for youngsters) as well as Mean Girls, Pretty Persuasion and Brick that all tell stories of high-school aged kids but are more artistic movies than mainstream. Mean Girls is still a comedy at heart, it has a girl come from home-schooling in Africa and cope with the social dilemmas of high school, Pretty Persuasion is more of a study into the mind of a ruthless teenager who decides to sue a teacher for sexual harassment and Brick is a look at the criminal underworld of high school, discovered by a boy who seeks the truth about the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend.\n\nI went recently to the Deauville festival and saw some new movies, also did interviews with the actors and directors.\n\nElisabethtown, Cameron Crowes new film, is a celebration of life and all its bitter-sweet coincidences. It's not a great drama as such but there is a lot of joy and innocence in it. It tells the story of a guy who basically gave the last 8 years of his life developing a sports shoe and at the beginning of the movie he is fired and gets to know that the shoe is gonna flop monumentally - as he is about to commit suicide he learns that his father has died while visiting family in Kentucky and he has to go and get the body. But it is not a sad or somber movie at all, and for instance Kirsten Dunsts performance as the air hostess who brings back his joie de vivre is very engaging.\n\nCinderella Man - a tad predictable but high-quality drama about a boxer during US great depression - it is based on a true story and has lots of good family and honor values.\n\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang is a silly, yet quite entertaining black comedy by Shane Black, some good performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer but all in all doesn't have anything very deep to say.\n\nBroken Flowers - Jim Jarmushs latest film has Bill Murray, an aging don juan called Don Johnston visiting his old girl friends and searching for clues of a son he may or may not have. It is slow, never actually answers the question of whether he is a father, but is very in the moment and the statement in the end is really - The past is gone, the future does not exist, so the present moment is all we've got\n\nAn Unfinished Life - Lasse Hallstrafams latest movie is set in the American countryside where Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman lead a routine existence as a farmer and his old farm hand who's been recently mauled by a roaming bear. Into their life appear his daughter-in-law and a grand daughter he never knew of, but he is not ready to welcome them because he thinks the accident that killed his son was her fault. It is a slow movie, full of silence but carries of course a good message of forgiveness and redemption.\n\nSerenity - the creator of the TV series Buffy the Vampyre Slayer and Angel has made his first feature film about a crew of a spaceship in the future, when mankind has spread to many planets that are controlled by a powerful Alliance. Sounds like Star Wars and is surprisingly good, with nice characters and a lot of warm heart despite the futuristic setting. The story is quite intriguing too and the film has many sahaj messages as well as some scenes that might be disturbing for the youngest for some violence.\n\nBorn into Brothels - a documentary about children who are born to prostitutes in India, but the real story is how they are empowered by a photography course that lets them document their surroundings and opens their world in many ways. It's very nice to watch for all those that have been in India and it is sweet how the film makers really care for the kids and go the extra mile to organize things for them, like a trip to the ocean that they've never seen or have them transfer to boarding schools so they can study without the social stigma of their environment.\n\nThe Ballad of Jack and Rose - poetic but strange drama about a hippie father who raised up his daughter, Rose, in an eco-commune that's now empty, and how he has to let other people into their isolated world and what is the price of that. Definitely not for young yogis, has a disturbing atmosphere and mood but could be interesting for artsy-movie lovers for the themes, metaphors and general ambiance.\n\nRoosa\n\nWith love from Finland\n\nHi, I was recently surprised when seeing two of the 'Barbie' films, with my children. I was drawn to each film, and stuck around until the end. They really were not what I expected. I expected the films to push the Barbie franchise, encouraging little girls to diet and wear bikinis etc The films I have seen - Barbie Swan Lake and - Barbie -The Nutcracker - were such a relief from the relentlessly loud and adult humour of Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks animated movies. The Barbie collection of films moves at a gentle pace, with nicely drawn computer animation. Just right for younger children - 7 and younger -which is a market hollywood seems to have completely forgotten these past few years. I would personally give these films a score of 9.\n\nLove -Jason Mulryan - Johannesburg - South Africa.\n\nWINDTALKERS -\n\na film about the unbroken navaho code using the\n\namerican navaho indian language as code in WWII - with\n\nNicholas Cage starring. was an interesting film based\n\non what actually happened in WWII. a number of\n\nnavaho's who enlisted and were very patriotically\n\namerican too in spite of racial predudice, and a lot\n\nof action scenes in an asian location fighting the\n\njapanese. a few scenes showing various interactions\n\nbetween the navahos and white americans. probably some\n\nmore understanding existing in some soldiers than\n\nwould in reality. but racialism shown a little bit.\n\nlots of deaths in war and losses of companions and\n\nshowing how brave these guys were. the japanese\n\ncouldnt understand the orders of the USA army as they\n\ncould not break the navaho code and this gave the\n\nyanks the advantage. obviously not enough because they\n\nthink dropped the a bomb (in reality not the film) far\n\ntoo violent for kids. but an interesting take on the\n\nwar theme\n\nSUM OF ALL FEARS-\n\nterrorists get a nuclear device and detonate it in USA\n\n- different type of terrorist than we have in reality\n\nand very different response than would be needed in\n\nreality and back to the age old theme, a newie to the\n\ninner circle of usa government saves the day by\n\nrevealing the truth. acting excellent except the\n\nchoice of actor as president is annoying somehow for\n\nwimpishness and lack of character depth. but he was\n\nnot on much and the rest of the acting was excellent\n\nmorgan freeman is good as head of intelligence agency.\n\nagain unsuitable for family\n\nSIGNS-\n\nwith Mel Gibson. interesting take on the\n\ncrop circles. lots of scary type atmosphere which\n\nlittle ones afraid of dark might find exceedinly\n\nspooky. if you like to go and see whatever sci fi\n\nhowever good or bad its ok. Mel Gibson always acts\n\nwell, there are funny moments in it as when the\n\nchildren take steps to defend themselves from aliens\n\n(wont reveal that), its well made but the story is a\n\nre-hashed variation on an old theme - bad aliens come\n\n- no one knows whats happening - man survives by a\n\nfluke - so theres not much depth although the acting\n\nand interpersonal relations are enjoyable watching\n\nBRYCE - SWITZERLAND\n\nANACONDA- rating of R14. Lasts 85 minutes. My rating: 0\n\nIt's not really one I would recommend to anyone. It has absolutely no story - just these people on a boat up an Amazonian river scared to death of being the next victims of a giant snake. Since that's a bit weak on it's own, they also have to contend with a crazy obsessed snake hunter intent on capturing the beast alive even if he has to kill a few of them himself to do it. Not stuff to inspire noble sentiments in any part of it, as you can imagine; they remain at a fairly base level. There are a number of intimations of sex that don't develop past more than about a quarter of a minute, but on the whole it is certainly not for younger children. I wouldn't recommend it even for older children.\n\nWAKING NED DIVINE: very funny. a quirky Irish comedy about a lotto win. nice change from hollywood humour. light funny and unexpected.\n\nTHE INSIDER: If you have not seen it, its a good exposee on the rife corruption of big business, based on true story, in this case the tobacco industry. Well acted - long film. not action - needs attention-not for chatting with a group of friends, or you miss the plot. It shows the lengths the tobacco industry goes to, in order to discredit its opponents. Something to add to havanas.\n\nCiao Rosy De-Corrado\n\nRecently I saw - Monsoon Wedding - The first part shows the components of a rich modern Indian family full of vices and with little virtue, although it improves inthe second half as a lot of hidden truths come to the surface. VOTE : 6\n\nJANE - ITALY\n\nOceans Eleven 5 After the first impressions of Las Vegas the film is clean for Yogis. Enjoyed the actors but not the film.\n\nNICK - ITALY\n\nThe Man who knew too little\n\nBill Murray. v.funny - good storyline.\n\nBrother Sun, Sister Moon.\n\nZefirellis masterful tale of St Francis of Assisi\n\nAI\n\nI recently saw the film AI As expected of a sci-fi flick, there were alot of impressive special effects and technical wizardry.What was totally unexpected as I came away from it was that this film was actually a metaphor for the search for self-realisation and its finalfulfillment in meeting the Mother.In the film, David, the mechanical boy was desperately searching for theBlue Fairy who he believed would turn him into a 'real' boy so that he would be accepted by his adoptive mother. After going through many trials and tribulations, he finally finds the Blue Fairy, if only in the form of an effigy. David nevertheless prays fervently at the feet of this statue and as the world freezes over he is in this position of supplication for 2000 years. When David is finally revived from the state of deep freeze by some super-beings of the future, he is granted his wish to be with his mother. And in the closing scene, David the 'mecha' boy finds his complete satisfaction and peace in the company of his mother.\n\nHighly recommended for yogis.\n\nSahaji from MALAYSIA\n\nA movie that my family have enjoyed many times is THE SECRET OF ROHAN INISH.\n\nIt is a delightful movie about a fishing community in Ireland, set in the 1920s or 30s. The little girl in it plays her part beautifully, and her character is instrumental in finding her baby brother who has gone missing, believed washed out to see. It also tells the tale of mythical creatures called selkies who change between human and seal forms. Lovely scenery, and a slice of life when the world moved more slowly.\n\n9 out of 10.\n\nSharon Nangle from Australia\n\nI have only one film that always comes to mind when I think of the best cinema experience I have ever had and that is a film by Wim Wembers called Wings of Desire. It is a black and white German film about an angel who falls to earth and falls in love, actually City of Angels is Hollywoods version of Wenders original film. It was shot in Berlin and is incredibly beautiful visually.The poetry of the language used often brings tears of joy, even though it is subtitled in English it has the same effect as the words of William Shakespeare. In the film we see the world through the eyes of the angels which are without judgement and full of love an compassion for this beautiful yet suffering world. Through them we feel the rain on our face for the first time, we drink coffee and we feel the heartbreak of the separation from the divine. For me the rating would be 9.5 out of 10\n\nHe also made a sequel called Faraway So Close which is about the friend of the original angel who also falls to earth when the child whose guardian angel he is falls of a balcony and the only way to save him is to fly down and catch him and in doing so give up his own immortality. Very deep, very subtle Not quite as good as Wings of Desire but still wonderful.\n\nICON production (Mel Gibson's production company).\n\nHe made a version of Anna Karenina that was shot inside Russia around 1995. It is a wonderful version because unlike many versions it pays quite a bit of attention to the parallel plot of the relationship between the characters Levin and Kitty. Tolstoy created Levin as an autobiographical character so as a realised soul he has a deeper perception of reality and through his honesty and introspection realises a stable and happy marriage based on love and respect at the end of the film whereas Anna is destroyed by her immorality. Score: 8\n\nThen of course there is Shakespeare.Kenneth Brannagh's version of Hamlet (4hrs) is wonderful and inspiring. One of the advantages of being a native English speaker has to be experiencing this incredible poetry first hand!. Score 8\n\nwith love Anna Chicos Australia\n\nThe Great Dictator by Charlie Chaplin An anti-Nazi-satire which makes you laugh and cry. A true masterpiece. In fact it is so funny that Film historians now believe that Hitler saw The Great Dictator on two occasions before he banned it\n\nAll the best, Gita\n\ndear all\n\nThe latest film we have seen here is - The road home - which we all liked very much; it's a Chinese story, very simple, pure and beautiful pictures, the producer makes a film with very few things but really it's not boring for one minute. A nice Chinese story which teaches us about their culture.\n\nrate 9"
