        "text": "There Will Be Blood\n\n15, Disney, 2 discs, £19.99\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson's ragingly intense There Will Be Blood, dazzlingly unlike his last offering, the brilliant, spiky Punch Drunk Love (2002), is the most ambitious film of the year, an experimental historical epic with mythic overtones. Violent as it is, it's drenched less in gore than in another fluid, the oil - what topic could be timelier? - that his capitalist anti-hero Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) rips, by drilling and dynamiting, from the California hinterlands.\n\nDay-Lewis deserves his Oscar; he too is taking risks here in his terrifying, ferociously unlikeable performance as a loveless man driven to scorched-earth destruction of everything around him by competitive fury and hatred (\"There are times when I look at people and see nothing worth liking\"). The uncanny wicked-patriarch voice he adopts aptly recalls John Huston's in Chinatown (the Californian epic of another vital liquid: water). His moody, unpredictable presence picks up from Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York.\n\nBut this grand conception of the foundational drives and dysfunctions of America offers a superbly detailed, poetic, off-kilter vision of the oil business (and the church business) that's quite unique. It demands to be seen at least once. Philip Horne\n\nGérard Depardieu: Screen Icons (Le Colonel Chabert; Mon Père ce héros; Buffet Froid; Tous les matins du monde)\n\n15, Optimum, 4 discs, £32.50\n\nAn officially dead Frenchman startled doctors recently by reviving on the slab. Returning from the dead seems a French habit - see Orphée, Les Diaboliques, The Return of Martin Guerre - and another Depardieu film, Yves Angelo's Le Colonel Chabert of 1994, based on Balzac.\n\nThis melancholy, beautiful, unsettling fable, set in 1817, has Depardieu as a shabby, spectral-seeming figure claiming to be the titular colonel, who died after the Napoleonic battle of Eylau in 1807. Revived, \"Chabert\" has come back to claim his due.\n\nUnfortunately, his widow, Fanny Ardant, remarried with two children, denies all knowledge of him. He therefore starts to haunt the law-office of the charismatic hot-shot lawyer Derville (Fabrice Luchini) - who subsidises his efforts, because if he's a conman he's \"the finest actor of our epoch\".\n\nIt's a moving, delicate and subtle fable, directed by the cinematographer of Tous les matins du monde (1991), the lovely period biopic of lutenist Martin Marais. The anarchic energy of Blier's Buffet Froid (1979) and the frothy Oedipal holiday fun of Mon Père ce héros (1991) make up this delightfully varied set. PH\n\nDiary of the Dead\n\n18, Optimum, 2 discs, £17.99\n\n\"The mainstream had just vanished, with all its power, wealth and money. Now it was just us - bloggers, hackers, kids.\" George A Romero's low-budget Diary of the Dead returns to his roots as an independent maverick (see 1968's Night of the Living Dead), and this fresh, intelligent fiction imagines the zombie plague starting right now. In this enjoyable (though apocalyptic) post-Blair Witch video-diary quasi-documentary on the end of life and death as we know them, the wit and wisdom of Romero run rings round the recent Cloverfield, which tried the same trick and cost 12 times as much to make.\n\nDiary targets the betrayal of duty - triviality, dumbing-down, or outright mendacity - by the US media. By contrast, Romero, through his \"undead\" metaphor, is \"trying to tell you the truth\" in this cheap-and-cheerless jeremiad, spry and venturesome stuff for a 68-year-old. PH\n\nThe Sex Pistols: There'll Always Be An England\n\nFremantle Home Entertainment, £15.99\n\nFor those who missed them at the Isle of Wight festival last month, here is proof that the ongoing Sex Pistols reunion is a good thing. Julien Temple's concert film from the band's five-night stint at the Brixton Academy last November is as exciting and celebratory as were the gigs themselves.\n\nPlaying indoors for once, the original quartet were clearly out to prove their mettle. Given their lack of proficiency back in 1976-77, these were quite probably the best ever live renditions of Anarchy in the UK et al.\n\nThough John Lydon and his heroic guitarist, Steve Jones, both look somewhat overfed, the power of their brilliant, irreverent repertoire, finally done musical justice, blasts triumphantly from the screen.\n\nThe reason for Jones's paunch can be found in the bonus feature, Pistols Psychogeography of London, where he lustily revisits his favourite pie and mash shop in Shepherd's Bush. Lydon, meanwhile, rants from the top deck of a tourist bus about the capital's declining standards.\n\nThe whole piece is hilarious, but also critical of corporate landscaping, and patriotic for a British paradise lost. Andrew Perry\n\nRambo\n\n18, Sony, £24.99\n\nJohn Rambo has used the 20 years since we left him in Thailand well. He has found time to reflect on what it all means, undergoing a Buddhist education and achieving a Zen wisdom.\n\nNo, not really: he catches snakes for a living, forges machetes in his spare time and says things like \"Killin's as easy as breathin'\" while gently sweating and staring into the middle distance.\n\nBut no one hoping for anything different is likely to seek out this film, and those wanting more of the same will probably be satisfied. The explosions are huge, the baddies are evil and Sylvester Stallone gets to mow down half the Burmese army with a massive machine gun. Blood, guts and limbs squelch all over the place for an hour and a half.\n\nBut the plot - Rambo reluctantly transports Christian aid workers into Burma, they get kidnapped, Rambo has to rescue them - could fit on a postage stamp, and the script is so excruciating that it would be better if none of the characters said anything at all. (Particularly criminal are the mockney exchanges between the band of Anglo-American special forces, which have to be heard to be believed.) Pointless. Jon Swaine"
