The <strong>guide</strong> looks at the historical background of the film, the issues around adapting Balzac’s original text for film, the themes and critical approaches to adaptations in general and this film in particular.

Where we have made reference to Balzac’s text, we have given page references from the <strong>Le</strong> Livre de Poche edition (1994). THE FILM ‘<strong>Le</strong> <strong>Colonel</strong> <strong>Chabert</strong>’, a film directed by Yves Angelo with the participation of Claude Rich, is based on a short story (nouvelle) written by Honore de Balzac in 1832.
