When he regains his health and memory, he goes back to Paris, where his “widow”, Anne has married the Count Ferraud and is financing his rise to power using Chabert’s money. Chabert hires a lawyer to help him get back his money and his honour.” – IMDB\n\nFrance, 1994, Yves Angelo. Drama/History/Romance, 1hr 50mins (PG)\n\nPresented as the Chiltern Film Club"
