SEATTLE, WA (CNN) — Friday marks the 30th anniversary of the death of Kurt Cobain the lead singer of Nirvana, a hallmark band of the Seattle grunge scene in the 1990′s.

He was found dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, but Seattle Police and the King County Medical Examiner’s Office determined that he took his own life on April 5th of that same year at the young age of 27.

Cobain founded the band Nirvana with Krist Novoselic in Cobain’s hometown Aberdeen, Washington, which is located across the Puget Sound from Seattle.

Thirty years have passed and the influence of Nirvana on rock music has only grown. Novoselic, the band’s bassist, has become an outspoken political activist, and drummer Dave Grohl moved on to form the Foo Fighters and has had notable rolls in many movies.
