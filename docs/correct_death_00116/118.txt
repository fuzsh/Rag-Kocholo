Today, April 5, is the 20th anniversary of Kurt Cobain's death, give or take 24 hours. Since his body wasn't actually found until the Friday morning of April 8, 1994, the coroner couldn't pinpoint his exact time of death, but it's generally accepted as being April 5, 1994, although the world wouldn't learn the news until April 8.

In a weird act of symmetry, Alice in Chains vocalist Layne Staley also died on an April 5...overdosing on heroin on April 5, 2002. Another parallel is that Layne's body wasn't discovered until later...TWO WEEKS LATER!

Cobain famously wrote Neil Young's lyrics "It's better to burn out than to fade away" in his suicide note.

You could say Kurt chose the former while Layne did the latter. I read an interesting article from a Michigan site that examines this point. Thought I would share it with you and ask your thoughts.
