Located in the upscale Denny-Blaine district of Seattle, Kurt and Courtney purchased this house for $1.130 million in January of 1994.

On April 8, 1994, Kurt Cobain was found dead by an electrician at this location in a room over the garage called "the greenhouse." It was estimated that his death occurred on April 5, 1994.

The are a number of conspiracy theories, but the death certificate concluded his death was a suicide.

The garage and "greenhouse" were bulldozed in 1996, and the home was sold by Courtney Love in 1997.
