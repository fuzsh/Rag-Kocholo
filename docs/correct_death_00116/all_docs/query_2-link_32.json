        "text": "574\n\n“Creativity is the most important aspect of being human. You don’t necessarily learn it in school. You’re born with it. Either you choose to foster it, or you lose it. When people say, ‘ I went to a so-and-so university, ‘ I laugh and think, ‘That’s where you learned to be a robot.’ Robots will replace you, and even robots can be replaced.“\n\n– Kurt Cobain\n\nDISCLAIMER: THIS IS A SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF KURT COBAIN’S LIFE AND DEATH BASED ON A CONVERSATION WITH HIS SPIRIT.\n\nI didn’t mean to start a conversation with Kurt Cobain. I was listening to Lana Del Ray’s new album Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd? when a voice started talking to me.\n\nI asked who it was, and it said “Kurt Cobain.” I have strict boundaries on who I let come through. Usually, I only communicate with family and friends of loved ones or people I know. But in this case, a Pandora’s box of information came flooding through to prove it to me. This is when I know the spirit is legit.\n\nDiscernment is essential for people with psychic abilities. When a spirit wants to communicate, make sure you are talking to who they say they are. When you ask who the spirit is and it’s something dark or trickster, it will evaporate. I never channel in that I never ask to speak with spirits. I just let people knock, perform an ID check, and then let them in.\n\nWith Kurt, it was a very long, deep, two-week journey into his life, death and experience of the afterlife. While he was with me, bizarre stuff was happening:\n\nI was craving American Spirit cigarettes that I hadn’t smoked in over 20 years (and he also smoked).\n\nI wanted to buy a guitar and keyboard and learn to play music (something I haven’t done since I was a teenager).\n\nHe sent massive kangaroos jumping into my yard and then laughed about it.\n\nHe turned on fans, messed with electronics, and even changed my son’s Kindle pages.\n\nI had the scariest dreams about his ex-wife.\n\nI went for a walk and, within one hour, saw three people with Nirvana shirts in my tiny little town in Australia.\n\nI spent two weeks with his spirit; each day, he gave me more and more information, building trust like any other relationship, testing me to see how I would react to what he showed me. He was very sweet, funny and kind. This is what I learned.\n\nLEGACY\n\nHe does not want his legacy to be a heroin addict who committed suicide.\n\nHe is upset that people believe this about him and deeply regrets that this influenced his behavior. Also, to all fans, DO NOT DO ANY DRUGS; they destroy your life, and most importantly, please do not take your own life.\n\nHe did not kill himself. He was murdered, but his choices contributed to his death. He takes full responsibility.\n\nHe wants people to remember him for what he created: music, art and a role model for authenticity and the acceptance of others.\n\nTo Kurt, the most powerful and impactful ways of living are civil disobedience, creativity and authenticity. Being true to yourself and your art and saying no to things you do not believe in will set you free and create the best possible.\n\nHe said this is what “evil” wants to stop – creativity, authenticity and any/all civil disobedience, as it has the most impact and can rapidly transform the world.\n\nHe was way ahead of his time.\n\nHe was brilliant and intuitive.\n\nHe had immense creative power and did not realize his power until he became a global celebrity.\n\nHe does not consider his music grunge; it was a combination of pop and punk and his own unique sound. He is proud of its timelessness.\n\nHe was dedicated to art and to creating what came through him authentically.\n\nHe wanted to pivot constantly and take lots of risks.\n\nHe wanted to evolve and change, learn and experiment constantly.\n\nBefore he died, he planned to shed the persona he had created, embark on a new creative journey, and make softer music that could connect people differently. He wanted to create a whole new genre.\n\nHe could not be controlled—he would always create whatever flowed through him. Right before he died, he was going in a completely opposite direction from Nirvana.\n\nHe was deeply spiritual but did not publicly show this side of himself until Unplugged.\n\nHe constantly questioned the meaning of existence – why are we here, who are we, what is creation?\n\nHe was incredibly psychic but did not understand this about himself while alive.\n\nIf you read his lyrics, because he was channelling, they may sound suicidal, but what he was unconsciously writing about is how he died, not how he was planning to kill himself.\n\nMUSIC\n\nIn Utereo is not about suicide—it is about being trapped artistically in a band/genre, on a record label, touring, by the media as a celebrity and about his toxic relationship with his wife. It is about feeling imprisoned by his own life and his own creation.\n\nThrough Nirvana, which was formed to create freedom, he subconsciously created his own prison.\n\nHe wanted to get out of his marriage, band, record contract, and touring schedule and shed his grunge persona.\n\nHe was in the process, but people conspired to have him murdered, and the scene was staged as a suicide.\n\nHe says creativity is our superpower. He helps artists and musicians on the other side develop art and stay safe.\n\nHe said evil individuals run the music and entertainment industry. They feed on artists like vampires. They are soulless and only see people as products. He said he is not the only musician who has been murdered. The media is used against us as a weapon.\n\nHe unconsciously channeled John Lennon and used him as inspiration for many things.\n\nThe spirit of John Lennon was assisting him. There was a profound connection and understanding between them both.\n\nHe said John Lennon’s son, Sean, and his daughter linked. He wants Francis to work with him in some way.\n\nPHYSICAL & MENTAL STATE\n\nHe said his stomach pains were a sign that he was going in the wrong direction, but he did not know or realise this. It was also the repressed pain from his childhood.\n\nHe is devasted that his fans have committed suicide in the wake of his death and wants them all to know that he did not kill himself and although he did use heroin, it was used as a method to control him, and it provided an escape from the pressure and confinement from his band and celebrity status. He regrets using it.\n\nHe had a very abusive childhood. He was deeply wounded. His music allowed him to express his anger, sadness and sometimes apathy towards people and life.\n\nHis marriage was a trauma bond. His wife was very much like his mother, critical, abusive, and controlling and both his wife and mother (when he was a kid) put drugs into him without knowing (his food, drinks, etc).\n\nHe was acting erratic in his final weeks because he was trying to extract himself from a trauma bond, which is like coming out of an addiction. He loved and hated his wife and was very confused. His childhood trauma was coming up for him to process, but he didn’t know this at the time. It was very overwhelming. He needed genuine help.\n\nHe felt he had no support or anyone to help him get out. He felt all alone. He wishes he had a mentor or someone he could have turned to who understood what he was experiencing.\n\nOver the two years after Nevermind came out, his identity changed rapidly. He went from a single guy playing in a little-known band to a global celebrity, a spokesperson for a generation, a husband, a father and the guy who had to lead a band to make another great record. It was a lot of pressure and difficult to cope with. He acted erratic and used drugs to cope.\n\nHe said that everything his ex-wife said was the opposite of the truth.\n\nHIS DAUGHTER\n\nHe loves his daughter very much, although he was scared she was not his baby at first because his wife became pregnant very quickly. He married her because he felt it was the right thing to do.\n\nShe was a terrible mother. He is sad that he did not do more to keep his daughter away from her and the people she hired to look after her. He said he also exhibited the wrong behavior as a father (arguing with his wife, taking drugs, etc.).\n\nHe is very proud of her. He tries to keep his ex-wife away from her. He says she is extremely talented and creative. He wishes she would open up an institute or art school for kids who cannot afford an art school. A school for the arts that includes painting/drawing, music, writing, film, theater, sculpting—all the arts.\n\nHe did not have the opportunity as a teenager and wished he had been able to attend a school that could help him develop his talent. But he was too poor and isolated. He says she can use the trust money to fund the institute, run it, and use it to develop her talents.\n\nHe said she could easily get donors and teachers to help her run it. It would give her purpose. He worries about her not having a purpose. She could call it The Cobain School for the Arts. It would also be a remarkable legacy to pass on to her children. He wants to change his legacy, help people tap into their creativity and authenticity, and live happy, healthy lives that impact the world.\n\nON CREATIVITY\n\nHe said that creativity is channeled through us and that Nevermind was a combination of his own experience and help from the other side. It was so popular because he had also channeled how we were all feeling collectively.\n\nHe is very grateful to all his fans.\n\nAnd he is grateful to Krist and Dave for their contribution and wishes he had treated them better.\n\nHe said they are very lovely people; he loves and respects them as artists and men.\n\nDEATH\n\nHe said that when he died, he was staying at a motel because he was too scared to be at his house. He intuitively knew that he was in danger but didn’t understand the gravity of the situation. His wife, record label, and management company were upset that he didn’t want to tour and had blackmailed him into going to rehab.\n\nHe just left and went back to Seattle so he could be on home turf, as he suspected his wife was using his stay in rehab as an opportunity to plot and scheme. He did not understand how far she would go. He wishes he had not flown to Seattle and had instead gone to the East Coast and then to Europe to hide away and escape while he unraveled himself from his old persona.\n\nHis wife had a network of spies, all heroin addicts surrounding him, that reported back to her. He was constantly watched and controlled. He needed to heal but wanted a different approach to healing. He said a monastery would have been nice.\n\nHe wanted to divorce his wife from a long distance if possible.\n\nHe should not have gone to Seattle.\n\nThe night he died, he was met at a motel room by a familiar person who “wanted to talk.” This person was a “friend”, but they were hired to kill him. The “friend” came into the room with some drugs that were put in a drink. They talked, and Kurt said, “I went to sleep—they put me to sleep.” He was almost dead in the motel room, but the “friend” and another man who was hired to manage the murder put him into a car and drove him back to his house. They put him in the greenhouse because it was easier to carry him from the car up there, and it was out of the house.\n\nThey shot him with heroin and then shot him in the head with the gun. They just sat him up, shot him and laid him out holding the gun.\n\nThe heroin addict nanny staying at the house helped stage the scene to look like a suicide. Three men murdered him, but others were involved and knew about it. It was arranged.\n\nHis wife was in LA manipulating the media and directing the entire operation by phone.\n\nEveryone who did it was paid.\n\nIt took a long time to find him, and he was dead for longer than they said he was.\n\nHe did not write that suicide note as a suicide note, and he wouldn’t have stabbed a pen through the center.\n\nHe says that people who know him know that he wouldn’t kill himself like that.\n\nHe says Dave (his former bandmate) has his doubts but will never say so.\n\nA lot of the biographies and books are just more media brainwashing to make it look like he was suicidal because the people involved need to cover their tracks.\n\nThere is still lots of evidence proving he was murdered, but people are not releasing it.\n\nHe says that a lot of people know he was murdered but won’t speak up because they are scared it will damage their reputations and careers.\n\nHe says that he appreciates everyone who believes he was not suicidal.\n\nHe says influential people are preventing the investigation from being reopened and adequately investigated.\n\nHe’s surprised and didn’t realize he had so few people who loved him.\n\nHis fans, not many who knew him, loved him more.\n\nHe was challenging to deal with.\n\nAUTHENTICITY\n\nHe said that being authentic and expressing your creativity is truly a gift and powerful.\n\nHe encourages everyone to tap into their creative ability and make things. Don’t expect to get famous or earn money, just make things.\n\nMaking things gives you purpose, allows energy to flow, and brings you deep satisfaction. It is healthy and healing.\n\nHe said if he were going to kill himself, he would have done it when he was a teenager because that’s when his life was the worst. But he made things, and that kept him going.\n\nHis artistic hunger and goals kept him alive. He was always excited to create things and meet other artists.\n\nArt is a channeled message but also a reflection of the unique soul of the artist.\n\nArt brings us together—it is a unifying force when used to do so.\n\nArt is so important and must be nurtured and appreciated.\n\nArtists must be cared for because they can be the healers we need.\n\nHe regrets that he could not make the art and music he wanted and says he will help those who need it. That’s his responsibility, considering what happened.\n\nHe wishes he had left his marriage sooner.\n\nAnd that he had hired different managers.\n\nAnd never signed with the record label he signed with.\n\nAll those things would have created a different outcome for him.\n\nBe careful who you hire, work with, and marry. They must earn your trust first.\n\nOn creativity, some people are suns, generating art and energy. They heal and enlighten.\n\nVampires like his wife and the entertainment industry are black holes; they suck and devour anything that comes near them.\n\nAvoid black holes. Radiate like the sun.\n\nCIA\n\nThe CIA controls everything in media & entertainment (news, film, music, celebrities, social media, internet, etc).\n\nThey are run by a shadow government formed around the 1900s prior to the WW’s.\n\nTheir agenda is mind control.\n\nThey run social media; they started Bitcoin.\n\nTheir biggest threat is people they cannot control, especially artists like Kurt Cobain and John Lennon.\n\nHis wife had connections in, or was connected to the CIA in some way.\n\nThe Kennedys, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, etc., practiced civil disobedience, authenticity and creativity.\n\nThey envisioned a better world and permitted people to create it.\n\nThey threatened the control grid and were murdered for it.\n\nHe called this the Jesus effect.\n\nSomething might come out about his death in 2024 during the 30th anniversary.\n\nREINCARNATION\n\nIn a past life, he was Leonardo DaVinci."
