        "text": "Police found a note in Kurt Cobain’s pocket after he died in which the Nirvana frontman accused his then-wife Courtney Love of “siphoning” his money.\n\nThe Seattle Police Department released the note Tuesday, in which Cobain mocked traditional wedding vows, writing “Do you Kurt Cobain take Courtney Michelle Love to be your lawful shredded wife, even when she’s a (expletive) with zits and siphoning all yr money for doping and whoring,” the National Post reported.\n\nThe note, released by police a few weeks after they made 34 previously unseen photos from Cobain’s death scene public, is written on stationery from the Phoenix Hotel in San Francisco. Cobain’s death files were released due to anticipated interest in the 20th anniversary of his death.\n\n“I’ve been a detective in homicide for 20 years and I’ve been in the cold case unit for 10 years,” said police detective Mike Ciesynski, in a statement. “Most of the cases I work on, I look for something that wasn’t done (in the investigation) in the past.”\n\nAccording to the Post, Ciesynski said police held on to the Cobain note because of the number of conspiracy theories surrounding his death.\n\nRight. Now we know … Courtney Love’s acne killed Kurt Cobain.\n\nCiesynski reportedly said Cobain’s death will remain classified as a suicide.\n\n“Sometimes people believe what they read — some of the disinformation from some of the books, that this was a conspiracy. That’s completely inaccurate,” he said in a statement. “It’s a suicide. This is a closed case.”"
