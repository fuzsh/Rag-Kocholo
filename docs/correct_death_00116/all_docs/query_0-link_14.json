        "text": "Did you know about these iconic Nirvana places in Seattle?\n\nHere we are now, entertain us!\n\nFans of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain have flocked to Seattle for years to pay homage to the band. Bars, museum exhibits, and even Cobain’s house can all be found here. This self-guided tour through Seattle will give you an intimate look into the story of the iconic grunge band, Nirvana. Local or tourist, you’ll want to stop by these historic corners that still hold an aura of talent and tragedy.\n\n1. Kurt Cobain’s house\n\nWhere: 171 Lake Washington Blvd, Seattle\n\nIn 1994, Kurt Cobain decided to settle down in a surprisingly normal and elegant residence in the affluent neighborhood of Denny-Blaine in east central Seattle. This is the place where the singer spent his last months and where he ultimately took his life. The house has been completely remodeled since and is not open to the public. However, plenty of Nirvana fans stop by anyway to pay homage and get a photo outside of the gate.\n\n2. Viretta Park\n\nWhere: 151 Lake Washington Blvd E, Seattle\n\nMake a quick visit to Viretta Park, just south of the Cobain’s former residence, where you’ll find a lonely bench covered in messages and flowers for the singer. The haunting memorial overlooks Washington Lake.\n\n3. Museum of Pop Culture\n\nWhere: 325 5th Avenue N, Seattle\n\nDon’t miss the ongoing exhibit Nirvana: Taking Punk To The Masses at Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture. It includes more than 200 rare artifacts and photographs of the band. Take a look at Kurt Cobain’s Fender Stratocaster, Dave Grohl’s drum kit and even a casting call flyer for the Smells Like Teen Spirit music video.\n\n4. Screwdriver Bar\n\nWhere: 23201st Ave\n\nAlso known as the “Rock N Roll Utopia”, Screw-Driver Bar was once a rehearsal space for the band, specifically between the release of Bleach and Nevermind. After they decided not to renew the lease, the space sat empty until a group of friends rented it with the intention of turning it into a bar where people could drink and enjoy music, which is occasionally live. They are open to this day!\n\n5. Central Saloon\n\nWhere: 207 1st Ave S\n\nNirvana played their first Seattle show at Central Saloon in 1988, which led to their relationship with Sub Pop Records. In fact, many other grunge artists played there such as Alice In Chains and Soundgarden, giving Central Saloon the right to claim the title of “the birthplace of grunge.” It’s still open today in Pioneer Square.\n\n6. Linda’s Tavern\n\nWhere: 707 E Pine St\n\nFinally, the last stop on your tour should be Linda’s Tavern. This laidback bar and restaurant in Capitol Hill was frequented often by Kurt Cobain. It was also the last place he was seen in public before his death. The so-called “grunge Cheers” is still open today and you can visit it to sit in the booth that Cobain was last seen in."
