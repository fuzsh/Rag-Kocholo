        "text": "Roborock QRevo Pro Robot Vacuum\n\nRoborock's Qrevo Pro Robot Vacuum and Mop does the work of several devices all without user intervention — the smart sensors within make it better at snuffing out the dirty areas than your naked eye. Using its unique FlexiArm Design, the machine can easily mop, dry, and vacuum, hitting both high-traffic areas and those pesky corners and edges, covering 98.8% of surfaces with a precision margin of 1.85mm. Then, when it's done, it passes over its same route using its auto-drying function, meaning you get the convenience of a clean, dry mop without the work of wringing the first one out. That said, this machine also senses when its mop water isn't running clear anymore, triggering a self-clean at its dock, which uses 140º F water to sanitize and remove the dirt and grime from the dual spinning mops, making it more efficient and your floors far cleaner. Enjoy Prime Day savings of $300 through July 20th.\n\nPresented by Roborock.\n\nPaul Brunngard Luxury Shoe Care Set\n\nBring the simple luxury of well-cared-for footwear home with this well-stocked walnut briefcase from the Swedish champion of shoe shining, Paul Brunngard. Featuring everything you need to bring a pair of dull leather shoes back to life, this all-in-one kit comes with ingredients and tools for every step of the process from restoration and cleaning, to polishing, with a Brunngard-made Sole Edge Iron for ridding the visible sole of scratches, smudges, and other blemishes. Whether you stow this briefcase away at home or take it with you on the road, it helps keep every component organized, thanks to its dedicated slogs and magnetic attachments, which ensure nothing shifts when the briefcase is in motion.\n\nPresented by Arterton\n\nNike Ja 1 Basketball Shoes\n\nHighlight plays. High-flying dunks. Ankle-breaking crossovers. Brutal blocks. Memphis Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant can do it all — and in style. Now, you can wear his signature on-court kicks, too, the Nike Ja 1, a mid-top sneaker with a bouncy forefoot Air Zoom unit for when you're taking off, a cushioned midsole for when you land, a foam collar so you don't roll an ankle, and plenty of grip and a forefoot strap so you can easily break others'. Subtle touches like Ja's custom 12 a.m. graphic, handwritten signature, hand-drawn logo, and jersey number add a truly custom feel, even if this player exclusive is up for grabs to everyone to wear their own way. These do, however, fit a bit small — so size a half-size up for the best fit and performance.\n\nPresented by Nike.\n\nNike Pegasus 41 Blueprint\n\nAn ode to Nike's original innovator, Bill Bowerman, who developed sneakers while Phil Knight ran the business, the new Nike Pegasus 41 Blueprint features nods to the former's efforts to always push the boundaries of what was possible, especially at the time. And now you can, too, whether you're committed to a high-mileage plan or you tackle your low-lift runs on cruise control. \"Bowerman Prototype\" reads on the tongue tag and the insole, while the speckled Swoosh logo represents the unfinished nature of the design. This release is fully-fledged, though, with its featherweight mesh upper for better mobility and breathability, new dual Air Zoom units and a ReactX foam midsole for improved energy return, all built around the MR-10 Last, the most consistent in terms of sizing. These sneakers do manage to look back and ahead at the same time, though, by spotlighting the signature waffle outsole developed by Bowerman and pledging commitment to Nike's Move to Zero campaign, which ensures all new products use some ratio of recycled materials from post-consumer and/or post-manufactured waste.\n\nPresented by Nike."
