One of the PDFs contains an exemption log detailing redacted and withheld content and exemptions applied.\n\nAlso as a courtesy, I have attached the Order Granting Summary Judgment, dated May 20, 2016, by King County Superior Court Judge Patrick Oishi, which permanently enjoins SPD from releasing any records from the case file regarding the death of Kurt Cobain that had not previously been disclosed; i.e., the records posted on the Blotter. I have also attached the Court of Appeals decision which upholds Judge Oishi’s decision.\n\nAs such, we will now be closing this request.\n\nThank you,\n\nNina Afereti\n\nSPD Legal Unit\n\nIf you have any questions, you may send a message using the Police Records Request Center or call the Public Disclosure Desk at 206-684-5481.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPenina Afereti\n\nSeattle Police Department\n\nLegal Unit\n\nSPD receives between 7, 000 and 8, 000 public records requests annually and is processing between 2, 500 to 3, 000 open requests at any given time.
