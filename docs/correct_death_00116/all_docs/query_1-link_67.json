        "text": "An Analysis of the Firearms Used in High-Profile Shootings, 1963 to 2001\n\nDate: April 5, 1994\n\nLocation: Seattle, Washington\n\nAlleged Shooter: Kurt Cobain\n\nPeople Killed: One (shooter committed suicide)\n\nPeople Injured: None\n\nFirearm(s): Remington Model 11 20-gauge shotgun\n\nCircumstances\n\nAfter two days in a California drug-treatment clinic, Cobain returned to his Seattle home and shot himself. Police had confiscated weapons from Cobain twice in the previous 10 months, so Cobain had a friend buy the shotgun for him.\n\nHow Firearm(s) Acquired\n\nThe firearm was legal. Cobain's best friend, Dylan Carlson, purchased the shotgun at Stan's Gun Shop in Seattle, Washington. Cobain did not want the gun to be purchased in his name because he thought the police might seize it from him for his own protection. The police had taken away his guns twice in the past 10 months. The first time was in response to a domestic disturbance at his home, but Cobain was not charged and the weapons were returned to him. On the second occasion, police seized four weapons from Cobainï¿½including the three that had been returned to himï¿½after his wife reported he was suicidal."
