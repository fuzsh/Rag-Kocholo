        "text": "A new Kurt Cobain documentary is shedding some light on conspiracy theories surrounding the death of the late Nirvana frontman.\n\nCalled \"Soaked in Bleach,\" the unauthorized doc dives into the singer's 1994 death in Seattle, which was ruled a suicide.\n\nDirector Benjamin Statler tells the story through Tom Grant, a private investigator that Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, hired to find her missing husband shortly before he was found dead at his Seattle-area home. The film also features interviews with Seattle's former police chief Norm Stamper, who served as the city's police lead from 1994-2000, including the time of Cobain's death.\n\n\"If I were the chief today, I would reopen this investigation,\" Stamper says in the film's trailer.\n\n\"We should in fact have taken steps to study patterns involved in the behavior of key individuals who had a motive to see Kurt Cobain dead,\" Stamper says in the documentary per Spin. \"If in fact Kurt Cobain was murdered, as opposed to having committed suicide, and it was possible to learn that, shame on us for not doing that. That was in fact our responsibility.\"\n\n\"Soaked in Bleach\" comes shortly after the release of \"Montage of Heck,\" a documentary, which premiered last month on HBO and was co-executive produced by Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean. The filmalso had the support of Love. But that's not the case with \"Soaked in Bleach.\" The Hole frontwoman issued cease-and-desist letters to theaters planning to show the film."
