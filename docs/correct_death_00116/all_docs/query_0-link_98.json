        "text": "The Seattle house that Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love purchased in 1994 is now up for sale. According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the couple bought the house in January 1994 and lived there until Cobain’s death on April 5 of the same year. Cobain died by suicide on the property. Love sold the 117-year-old house for $2.895 million in 1997.\n\nIn addition to four bedrooms and four full bathrooms, the home also has a wine cellar. The current asking price for the house is $7.5 million, according to a listing by the real estate agency Ewing & Clark. Though there aren’t any interior shots of the home, you can view the full listing here."
