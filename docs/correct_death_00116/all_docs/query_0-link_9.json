        "text": "The Seattle home where Kurt Cobain took his own life over 27 years ago has found a new owner, The Post can report.\n\nThe Nirvana frontman was discovered on the property, which he shared with wife Courtney Love, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 5, 1994, at 27.\n\nThree years after his death, the home sold for $2.9 million to Mr. Euyang Walter Jr., a Seattle businessman, property records show.\n\nWalter, 64, and his family would remain in the historic home for 23 years before deciding to part ways with the property, listing the residence for sale at a pricey $7.5 million in 2019.\n\nHowever, the home quietly sold on Aug. 24, 2020, for $7,050,0000 — $450,000 less than the asking price.\n\nThe new owner purchased the home under the LLC, CSK Washington Investments.\n\nWalter did not return The Post’s request for comment.\n\nThe 1990s grunge rock god and Love, now 57, had purchased the Queen Anne-style house for $1.48 million in January 1994 – three months before his death.\n\nCobain was found in the greenhouse of the estate, which Love later had demolished.\n\nIn May, the FBI and Seattle Police released never before seen photos and documents of the death scene along with details about the events and theories surrounding it.\n\nMade up of four bedrooms and five baths, the home spans over 7,000 square feet and is situated on nearly an acre of land with views of Lake Washington.\n\nBuilt in 1902, the house is in exclusive Denny Blaine, an affluent east central Seattle neighborhood on the banks of Lake Washington.\n\nFeatures include a wine cellar, walk-in closet and hardwood flooring throughout. Property records show last renovations to the home were made in July."
