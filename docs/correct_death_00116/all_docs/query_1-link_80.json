        "text": "As the 20th anniversary of Kurt Cobain’s tragic death approaches, Seattle police confirm that they have reviewed the late Nirvana front man’s file, as they are “anticipating questions surrounding the closed Cobain case.” The police department also clarified that it has not re-opened the investigation, as was erroneously reported earlier this morning.\n\nConfusion over the status of the investigation was sparked today when police spokeswoman Renee Witt alerted news organizations that a cold-case detective “dug up the files and had another look,” however the detective determined that “there was nothing new” to the case. Additionally, Witt revealed that the detective discovered rolls of undeveloped film from the death scene. However, once the film was developed, the detective determined that “[t]here was nothing earth-shattering in any of these images.” Regardless, the A.P. reports that police plan to release at least one of the recovered photos to the public later today and answer questions about Cobain’s death.\n\nThe tragic milestone arrives early next month. Cobain’s body was found inside his Seattle greenhouse on April 8, 1994. Per the A.P., “an investigation determined that days earlier Cobain had gone into the greenhouse of his large home and taken a massive dose of heroin. He then shot himself with a 20-gauge shotgun. Earlier that year Cobain had tried to kill himself in Rome by taking an overdose of tranquilizers.”\n\nIn other Cobain news, a group of fans led by journalist Jaime Dunkle are attempting to crowdsource $700,000 to purchase the late musician’s childhood home in Aberdeen, Washington, and convert it into a museum. In the same town, last month, fans were confused when Cobain was memorialized with a bizarre statue of the musician crying. On April 10 next month, the band will get a more proper tribute when it is formally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Case for Kamala Harris\n\nReplacing Joe Biden would be risky.
