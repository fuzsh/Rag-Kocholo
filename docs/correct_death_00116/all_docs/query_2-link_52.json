        "text": "As far as anyone can know, Kurt Cobain went to the room above the greenhouse in the backyard of his house at 171 Lake Washington Boulevard East in Seattle sometime on April 5, 1994. After one last hit of heroin, he shot himself in the head with a Remington shotgun.\n\nWhile other people including a private detective searched for him, his body lay in that greenhouse until Friday, April 8. That’s when we heard the news.\n\nHere are a few things about Kurt for today.\n\nFrances Bean’s message\n\nKurt’s only daughter, Frances, was 20 months old when he died. Today, she posted an emotional note: . ‘I wish I could’ve known my Dad. I wish I knew the cadence of his voice, how he liked his coffee or the way it felt to be tucked in after a bedtime story.”\n\nThe Conspiracy\n\nThere’s my brand-new Uncharted podcast that deconstructs and debunks the whole “Kurt-was-murdered” conspiracy.\n\nDuff McKagan’s Kurt Encounter\n\nThe GNR bass player found himself seated next to Kurt on a Delta flight home to Seattle after Kurt busted himself out of rehab. Here’s his account of that plane ride.\n\nKurt vs. Tool\n\nNot a fan, apparently.\n\nSinatra does Nirvana\n\nInteresting. (Via Tom)"
