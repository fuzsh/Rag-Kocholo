        "text": "nirvana\n\nNirvana played Seattle's Pier 48 on Dec. 13, 1993. The following day the band was at the Salem Armory\n\nKurt Cobain died 20 years and 10 days ago, alone in a room above the greenhouse in his Seattle home. The last music he heard was REM's \"Automatic for the People,\" the voice of his friend Michael Stipe. Maybe it was \"Man on the Moon,\" a tribute to Andy Kaufman, a comedian Cobain loved.\n\nHere's a little agit for the never-believer. Here's a little ghost for the offering.\n\n1. Krist Novoselic, Nirvana's bass player and Cobain's childhood friend, told Charles R. Cross that music is the most important thing about Cobain, not his death. \"The details of his death are just lurid.\" True, and yet, as Cross writes in \"Here We Are Now: The Lasting Impact of Kurt Cobain,\" it's also true that Cobain is the most famous suicide of the last 20 years, and his death changed the way suicides are reported in the media. Not the intrusive stuff, the photos of Cobain's body, but the reminders that if you're struggling with depression or drug addiction, help is available. You're not alone.\n\n2. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among 27-year-olds, after car accidents. Cobain was 27 when he died. The list of helpful resources usually goes at the bottom of an article, but I'm going to put some right here: Suicidepreventionlifelife.org: 1-800-273-8255. Portland Area Narcotics Anonymous: 503-345-9839.\n\n3. \"Nevermind\" was released in 1991 and sold at least 20 million copies worldwide. The album and \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" are routinely ranked among the top 10 best, most important, and most influential in one poll after another, but is \"Nevermind\" the best Nirvana album? Cobain didn't think so, and neither did Novoselic and Dave Grohl. All three band members thought \"In Utero\" was a better album. So does Cross, and so do I. Chuck Klosterman wrote in \"Fargo Rock City\" that \"It's periodically brilliant, but half of the material on 'Nevermind' is filler.\" He thinks that track for track, \"Appetite for Destruction\" by Guns n Roses is a better album. Rolling Stone gave \"Nevermind\" three stars out of five when it was released and later went back and added a star to the online review.\n\n4. Cobain was born in Aberdeen, Wash., in 1967 and spent most of his life in Grays Harbor County. He is the most famous and influential musician from the Pacific Northwest after Jimi Hendrix and like Hendrix, a Seattle native, his hometown has struggled with how to honor him. Private funds were raised to add \"Come As You Are,\" not Cobain's name, to the \"Welcome to Aberdeen\" sign outside town. A proposal to rename the Young Street Bridge, a shrine to Cobain, after him was voted down by the city council. A statue of Cobain in Aberdeen has been widely criticized because it includes a large concrete tear falling from one of his eyes.\n\n5. As Cobain became famous, he began speaking out for feminism and gay rights and never stopped. He was decades ahead of his time in standing up for women and gays in the male-dominated world of rock. \"If any of you, in any way, hate homosexuals, people of different color, or women, please do this one favor for us -- leave us ... alone,\" he wrote. \"Don't come to our shows and don't buy our records.\"\n\n6. Cross marches through the ways Cobain has influenced punk rock, high fashion and popular culture and pauses at a place that isn't so obvious: hip-hop. Cobain owned only one hip-hop album (Public Enemy's \"It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back\") and worked exclusively in a loud/soft/loud, guitar/bass/drums format, yet Nirvana's music has frequently been sampled by hip-hop artists and Cobain's name is invoked in lyrics.\n\n\"Once everyone knew Kurt's name, his insertion into the music of the moment, which happened to be hip-hop, was inevitable,\" Cross writes. \"There is at least one great truth here that many young hip-hop artists, children in 1991, will miss. But it is a fact not lost on 44-year-old Jay-Z. Hip-hop first foray into the mainstream sales charts began in the eighties, just prior to Nirvana's ascension, and Kurt, for a moment, overshadowed every other music form. 'It was weird because hip-hop was becoming this force, then Grunge music stopped it for one second, ya know?' Jay-Z told Pharrell Williams in his 2012 book 'Pharrell: Places and Spaces I've Been.' 'Those hair bands were too easy for us to take out; when Kurt Cobain came with that statement it was like, We gotta wait awhile.' \"\n\n7. \"Nevermind\" was released at a time when albums were purchased in record stores. No downloading, no MP3s, no Amazon, no streaming. It sold 10 million copies in one year; the only rock album in the Billboard top 10 in 2013, \"Night Visions\" by Imagine Dragons, sold 1.4 million copies. Much of the music Cobain listened to was on homemade cassette tapes.\n\n8. Cobain's death did not result in a spike in suicides, but the longer-term trends are scary. Suicides rates are up across the country, and heroin is cheaper and easier to obtain than ever. After I put down \"Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain\" the other night, I picked up an issue of Rolling Stone and read about the heroin epidemic in Vermont and around the country. The governor of Vermont, Peter Shumlin, devoted his entire state of the state address to the heroin crisis and what should be done about it. The governor of Oregon, or some other politician with courage, should do the same.\n\n9. Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the other night. Novoselic said \"I want to say thank you to Kurt Cobain and I wish Kurt was here tonight, OK?\" Cobain's mother said he would have been proud. \"He'd say he wasn't, but he would be. I just miss him so much.\" Grohl and Novoselic and Pat Smear played Nirvana songs and four women -- Joan Jett, Kim Gordon, Annie Clark and Lorde -- sang the leads.\n\n-- Jeff Baker"
