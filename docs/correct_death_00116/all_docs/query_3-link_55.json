        "text": "Timeline: Tracing the final days of Kurt Cobain\n\nFrom an outside perspective, 1994 was destined to be a great year for Kurt Cobain. His rock band, Nirvana, were forerunners during the mainstream explosion of grunge and were the genre’s most highly-visible band. Cobain had received critical acclaim, not just for his mix of punk attitude and pop hooks on Nevermind but also for the darker underbelly uncovered on the band’s follow-up, In Utero. Nirvana were selling out massive concerts across the world, and Cobain was already getting labelled as the voice of a generation.\n\nBut privately, Cobain was struggling. An intense undiagnosed stomach ailment had increased his heroin usage, as did his struggles with depression and overexposure. As Cobain’s physical and mental health began to deteriorate, Nirvana were only getting bigger and bigger. By the time the band recorded their sessions for MTV Unplugged at the end of 1993, Cobain had already been attempting to get himself off hard drugs, with little success.\n\nIn the middle of Nirvana’s 1994 European tour, Cobain overdosed on pills and alcohol in Rome on March 4th. The overdose caused Cobain to relapse into his heroin addiction, and in the ensuing years, Cobain’s wife Courtney Love opinioned that the overdose was his first suicide attempt. Cobain’s family had a history of suicide, with two of Cobain’s uncles committing suicide using guns.\n\nAn attempted intervention led Cobain to check into the Exodus Recovery Center in Los Angeles on March 30th. That day, he saw Love and his daughter, Frances Bean, for the last time. Less than 24 hours later, Cobain hopped the six-foot fence that surrounded the rehab centre and got on a plane to Seattle. Sat near Cobain was Duff McKagen, bassist for eternal Nirvana enemies Guns ‘N Roses. However, McKagen recalls a friendly interaction with Cobain, despite being quoted in Charles Cross’ Heavier Than Heaven as having felt from “all of my instincts that something was wrong.”\n\nAfter a week of questions surrounding Cobain’s whereabouts, an electrician entered his Seattle home to install a security system. It was then that Cobain’s body was found with a shotgun and a small pool of blood by his head. During the initial investigation, the coroner reported that Cobain had likely been dead for days when he was found, estimating the exact date of death as April 5th, 1994.\n\nHere is a timeline chronicling the final days of Kurt Cobain…"
