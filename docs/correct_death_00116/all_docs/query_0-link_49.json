        "text": "In addition to being a stunning example of Queen Anne-style architecture, one Seattle house on the market is also a piece of pop culture history. Located a block from Lake Washington, the 117-year-old residence was once home to the late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain and his wife, Courtney Love, and is now for sale for $7.5 million.\n\nThe four-bedroom, four-bath home in the Leschi neighborhood was built in 1902 and has quite a presence, with a classic shingled exterior, detailed windows, balconies, and stone accents. While the listing doesn’t reveal interior photos of the 8,212-square-foot dwelling, it does describe the property as “perfectly maintained,” “completely updated throughout,” and as having “gracious rooms enhanced by an open-floor plan and fine millwork.”\n\nThough the plot is only three-quarters of an acre large, it offers lots of greenery, a gated driveway, and incredible views of Lake Washington. The listing also mentions the serene property is located just 15 minutes from downtown Seattle and a quick stroll from bustling Madison Park. What’s not mentioned is the rock-and-roll history that made the house infamous.\n\nJoin Now\n\nSummer Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per month.\n\nArrow\n\nTroubled musicians Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain purchased the home in 1994, and resided there for just three months, before Cobain died by suicide in a room located above the detached garage, called the greenhouse. Pictures in the listing don’t show a garage, but it does note there is one with room for two cars. It was previously reported that the room where the tragedy took place was torn down shortly after Cobain's death. Love sold the property for $2.895 million in 1997. Later property records reveal that a detached garage was added in 1999, so it is likely that the remnants of the room where Cobain died are now gone.\n\nArchitecture + Design\n\nTour a Sprawling Napa Valley Estate That’s a Dream for Those of All Ages\n\nAfter buying their historic Wine Country weekend escape, a young San Francisco family enlisted interior designer Peter Dunham to translate their welcoming, informal style throughout\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nInside Russell Wilson and Ciara’s Showstopping Properties\n\nThe NFL champion and the R&B superstar maintain abodes in California, Colorado, and Washington State\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nElon Musk Now Lives in a $50,000 Prefab Tiny House in Texas\n\nAfter selling most of his real estate portfolio, the multibillionaire is now living in a 400-square-foot unit on his SpaceX Texas site\n\nArchitecture + Design\n\nTour a Hollywood Producer’s Historic LA Craftsman With Colorful French Flair\n\nDesigner Breeze Giannasio gave producer Kristin Burr a detailed roadmap for infusing her rustic new home with bold glamour"
