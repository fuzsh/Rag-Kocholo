        "text": "Dear Seattle Police Department,\n\nWe are an international group of people who come together because we disagree with the outcome of the investigation into the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994. I assure you that we are not in any way connected with the well-known people who deal with Kurt Cobain's case. Our activity is independent and civic.\n\nMr. Cobain was the lead singer of a popular grunge band from Seattle called Nirvana. They achieved a mass amount of popularity in 1991, and gained millions of fans around the world.\n\nThe official report from the Seattle police department is that he took his own life, however there are a lot of unanswered questions and inconsistencies with this.\n\nAs is widely known, Mr. Cobain's body would be discovered on the morning of April 8 in the greenhouse, which was located just next to the main residence. No legible fingerprints were discovered on the shotgun discharged into Mr. Cobain and, among numerous other questions of evidence, the results of his toxicology revealed a triple-lethal dose of heroin, suggesting he was incapacitated prior to discharge of the firearm. The official date of Mr. Cobain's death is listed as April 5.\n\nWashington State Patrol Declined to Affirm Suicide Verdict, Legal Document Indicates\n\nA legal record obtained publically through the King County Superior Court indicates that the Washington State Patrol (WSP), in 1995, declined to affirm the Seattle Police Department’s determination that Kurt Cobain committed suicide. The basis provided by the WSP for not affirming the suicide verdict is that the Patrol “lack sufficient information” to do so.\n\nsource: Cobain Evidence Blog by Kurt Fraser,\n\nLink: http://cobainevidenceblog.blogspot.cz/2016/05/washington-state-patrol-declined-to.html\n\nLink to documents: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxM8lcUQiSoJUEYzNWZGMC1rNkE/view\n\nA 2014 review by the SPD of the 1994 investigation into Mr. Cobain’s death, however, reaffirmed the suicide verdict. The full scope of that review, though, appears very limited and a number of its conclusions, arguably as a result of bias stemming from severe investigative errors committed during the 1994 investigation, appear forensically unsound.\n\nFurther information can be obtained from other sources.\n\nSince 1994, quite a few magazine and newspaper articles have been written on this information. It has also been the subject of many radio and television shows. A book entitled \"Who Killed Kurt Cobain? The Mysterious Death of an Icon\" was published in 1998. It was mentioned in a 1998 film about the couple called \"Kurt & Courtney\". Hank Harrison, Love Kills: The Assassination of Kurt Cobain was published in 2017.\n\nDear Mr. Adrian Diaz,\n\nwe founded this petition on July 13, 2015. We have sent several personal letters to the former Chief Mrs. O'Toole.\n\nCertainly there are innumerable crimes in this world every day , and there is much injustice. In case of Cobain the public awareness is much higher, because he was a publicly known person. To me it's not about obsession or fan-worshipping, it is simply to answer the many outstanding questions concerning the circumstances of his death.\n\nI hope I can motivate you with my letter and this petition to reopen the investigation in the case of Kurt Cobain . Anyway, it would be a win/win situation for the Seattle police, the public and there's just nothing left to lose.\n\nI'm writing you in hopes for your help to press for a reexamination of Mr. Cobain's death. Millions of fans around the world would like to see the inconsistencies surrounding the death cleared up once and for all.\n\nIt is sad to think that an injustice of this nature can be allowed in the United States.\n\nI hope to your gut feeling. Thank you for reading.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n*I am writing my personal statement, as the author of this petition."
