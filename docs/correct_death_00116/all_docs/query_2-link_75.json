The determination of his death was suicide, three days prior to the discovery of the body; i.e., on April 5. The Seattle Police Department officially labeled the death a suicide from the earliest hours on April 8. Cobain had left a drug rehab center in Marina Del Rey, California, on April 1, and had been struggling with depression, drug use, and a debilitating stomach/bowel illness.\n\nOn the day of his death, an electrician named Gary Smith arrived at Cobain's home to install a new security system. He found Cobain's body in an upstairs room with an overturned plant and what he thought was a mannequin lying beside it. When he noticed the blood, he called the police. Cobain had been missing for six days and had recently checked himself into the Exodus Recovery Center in Los Angeles for drug treatment.\n\nCobain's suicide note was found nearby, and it indicated that he had taken his own life. The note was written in a chaotic, disorganized manner, and the final lines appeared as an afterthought, which led some to suspect foul play. \n\nCobain's death led to numerous conspiracy theories that Courtney Love, his wife, was involved in his death. These theories were fueled by an episode of \"Unsolved Mysteries\" dedicated to Cobain's death, which aired shortly after his death. However, there is no concrete evidence to support these theories. \n\nSources:\n\nhttps://mals.camden.rutgers.edu/files/A-Denial-The-Death-of-Kurt-Cobain.pdf\n\nhttps://performingsongwriter.com/kurt-cobain-mysterious-death/\n\nhttps://allthatsinteresting.com/kurt-cobain-suicide-note\n\nhttps://scottfeero.blog/kurt-cobains-suicide-note/\n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/seattle-police-deny-kurt-cobain-death-case-was-reopened-tweet-explanation\n\nhttps://www.king5.com/article/news/local/remembering-kurt-cobain-30-years-later/281-b354c7ad-8ccd-4564-a756-13bdaf1be599\n\n#Nirvana #kurtcobain #cobain #nirvanafans #nirvanafanpage #nirvanaforever #music #musicmemes #musicmeme #musicvideo #interview #musician #musicstudio #musical #grunge #concert\".",
