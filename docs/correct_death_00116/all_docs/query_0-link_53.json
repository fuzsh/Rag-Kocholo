        "text": "Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love's former Seattle home is on the market\n\nMuch about the home is a mystery. What is clear is that this is 100% the place where Cobain died - making it a forever destination for curious Nirvana fans.\n\nFrom Curbed Seattle:\n\nCobain and Love purchased the mansion in early 1994 for $1.49 million (about $2.6 million in today’s dollars), King County property records show, and Love sold the home to a trust in 1997 for $2.9 million. It’s unclear what changes have been made since that time."
