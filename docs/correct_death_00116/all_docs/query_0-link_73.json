        "text": "Seattle. The birthplace of Grunge. So cool to be here. So, as huge Nirvana fans, one of the first things on our tourist list was a visit to Kurt Cobain’s last house on Lake Washington Boulevard.\n\nIt’s privately owned these days (it went to Courtney Love on Kurt’s death, but she stopped paying rent on it at some point), so you can only view it from afar (i.e. the street), but we managed to get a couple of snaps before quickly moving along.\n\nApparently the garage still stands, but the greenhouse where he met his end is no longer there. But overall, pretty cool to maybe stand where Kurt once stood and wonder what awesome music was once created inside.\n\nThe atmosphere was very quiet and tranquil and the whole suburb kind of feels like a serene oasis.\n\nHere’s what the street now looks like:\n\nAnd this is the park next door, with the dedicated Kurt Cobain homage seat:\n\nNeedless to say, the locale seems to be one of the most beautiful in Seattle, where all the gardens are gorgeously manicured and the road islands sport huge tulips. Here’s the bottom of Kurt’s street.\n\nAnd if you thought his house was big, that’s nothing. Every other home here is basically a stunning American mansion. Wish we could live in one of these!\n\nAfterwards, we went for a walk to another little park around the corner. Felt like a slice of wilderness.\n\nNext Nirvana Stop: Olympia – The WA capital where they (or Kurt) apparently wrote the majority of the Nevermind album."
