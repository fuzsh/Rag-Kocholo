        "text": "Kurt Cobain is ingrained in Seattle’s identity at this point which is why it’s surprising that his old home sold quietly last year for $7.1 million to a mysterious CSK Washington Investments LLC. The Denny Blaine estate is the same property where Cobain took his own life in 1994 and is somewhat of a mecca for fans. Now that it’s been almost a year since the sale, let’s take a deep dive into the property.\n\nAccording to King County records the home was built in 1902 and is considered a Grade 12 Luxury home. Those same records also state that the home was renovated in 1999, two years after Courtney Love sold the home. Other than that, you won’t find too many details on this historic home.\n\nBut it does look like there’s a bit of misinformation on the property currently circulating. Several recent articles have called the home that sold the place where Cobain took his own life. That’s actually not true. Rather, Cobain took his life in the property’s greenhouse which has since been torn down but you can see photos of it here.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nHere’s where Anthony Bourdain loved to eat (and smoke) when he visited Seattle\n\nThis interactive map shows the places in Seattle that make people the happiest\n\nSadly Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain didn’t get to enjoy their house for long as they purchased the home for $1.4 million just three months before Cobain’s death in 1994. Now you’re probably still curious about the property and we have to warn you it’s pretty tough luck. The home is located in one of Seattle’s most exclusive and swankiest neighborhoods so you won’t be getting close to the home or get a peek inside anytime soon.\n\nThe home is very much so on private property and there are no tours. The closest you can get is Viretta Park (pictured above) which is located next door to the home and is widely regarded as a park memorializing the late grunge rock singer. You can find and enjoy the bench where many Nirvana fans have sat upon and reflected. How very Seattle.\n\nPsst if you’re extra nosy, you can take a peek at the home by checking out 171 Lake Washington Blvd E on Google Maps. Have a great week folks."
