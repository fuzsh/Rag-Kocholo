        "text": "The Seattle home where 1990s grunge rock god Kurt Cobain took his own life is on the market for $7.5 million.\n\nThe lead singer of Nirvana and his wife, Courtney Love, the frontwoman for Hole, bought the Queen Anne-style house for $1.48 million in January 1994, according to The Seattle Post-Intelligencer.\n\nBut the couple, fixtures on the city’s music scene, didn’t have the opportunity for long to enjoy the 8,200-square-foot home with views of Lake Washington.\n\nCobain killed himself in the greenhouse on the property on April 5 of that year.\n\nLove had the greenhouse demolished. She later sold the four-bedroom, four-bathroom house for $2.89 million to a trust in mid-1997, according to Curbed.\n\nThis is the first time that the property, which has a shingled exterior and stone accents, has gone on the market since then.\n\nLocal luxury real estate agent Aaron Freeman doesn’t believe the home’s painful past will hurt its chances of selling — or even result in a price cut.\n\n“It will just be an interesting piece of the property’s history,” says Freeman, of Realogics Sotheby’s International Realty. He has no connection to the property. “It being in Seattle and [having a connection to Cobain], who’s an icon of the grunge era, will help it sell.”\n\nBuilt in 1902, the house is located on three-quarters of an acre in exclusive Denny Blaine, an affluent east central Seattle neighborhood on the banks of Lake Washington. It features a wine cellar and a walk-in closet.\n\nLittle is known about the interior of the home, as no inside shots were included in the listing, which is held by the real estate agency Ewing & Clark.\n\nReal estate agents for the firm didn’t immediately return calls from Realtor.com.\n\nWhat is known is that a detached garage and retaining wall were added to the property in 1999, according to property records cited by the Post-Intelligencer.\n\nProperty taxes on the property are estimated to be $52,000, according to the listing."
