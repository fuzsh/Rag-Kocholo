It has now been 30 years without Kurt Cobain, the iconic lead singer and guitarist of Nirvana.

Cobain was found dead inside his Lake Washington home by an electrician on the morning of April 8, 1994. He was 27 years old.

The Medical Examiner's office later determined that he died three days earlier on April 5.

Seattle police said he was found with a shotgun across his body and a suicide note was discovered nearby.

After the news broke of his death, fans gathered outside Cobain’s Seattle home to honor the rock musician, who helped make Seattle’s grunge scene internationally known.
