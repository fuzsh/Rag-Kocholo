Alternative Rock is a subgenre of rock music which originated in the early-to-mid '80s from genres such as Punk Rock and became extremely popular in the '90s.

In the '90s, alternative rock began to merge with other genres such as Pop to form the post-alternative genre of pop music, and with heavy metal and other genres to form Grunge.

Since the term 'alternative rock' is vague, it is sometimes used to encompass all rock bands from the '90s and 2000s and is often used today in context of any band with rock influences.

Notable Bands[]

Having all started in the late '70s or early '80s, The Cure, R.E.M., U2, and 10,000 Maniacs are some notable names which were among the first alternative rock bands, and all maintained popularity into the '90s, and even the '2000s in the case of U2.

Among the many alternative rock bands which were highly popular in the '90s include Counting Crows, Smashing Pumpkins, Matchbox 20, and Oasis.
