        "text": "The evolution of music has brought forth hundreds of music variations in so many forms to the basic music categories. This diversity in music forms have categorized in alternative music those music that come as slight style alterations to most popular music forms (i.e. alternative rock or rock-ish music for rock music that does not really fit into the mainstream genres of a particular time period).\n\nAlternative music, also known as alternative rock and alternative, started in the 1980's and became widely popular in the 1990's. The term alternative was used to describe pop punk bands on independent labels and didn't fit into the genre of their time.\n\nAlternative rock consists of many sub-genres that have emerged since its beginning such as, grunge, Britpop, Goth rock, and indie pop.\n\nAlternative music is a category coined as a sort of catch-all for those sub-genres that are unclassified but can be traced with similarities to popular genres.\n\nThese alternative music are usually those that were not released commercially and are recorded on independent labels. Some music from this category, from word of mouth, would soon find its way into the mainstream and become commercially successful.\n\nOff-Country\n\nCountry music that does not conform to the prevailing country style is generally classified as alternative music. Musicians playing alternative country music are generally those who do not subscribe to high production values and popularity concerns."
