        "text": "We all watched Rihanna light up the stage in the 2023 Super Bowl halftime show. The 2023 Grammys have just concluded and Beyonce has matched the record for the highest number of Grammy wins ever. We can also see the exploits of Afro-Pop stars like Tems and Burna Boy. The biggest music stars in the world are everywhere, supported by their record labels.\n\nOn the flip side, there's a different kind of artists out there. For decades, they struggled to shine without the backing of a record label. In the last couple of decades, however, the world has started to stop and listen. To enjoy the music these independent, or indie, artists are making. But when did indie music start? What has been the journey so far? Join me as I walk down memory lane to tell this story.\n\nWhat does it mean to be indie?\n\nI've seen people get confused over what it means to be indie. For example, if you look up Imagine Dragons, you'll find \"indie\" listed as one of their genres. When you go on to see that they're affiliated with one of the biggest labels in the world, Universal Music Group, you might start to scratch your head in confusion. Let me help you clear up the confusion. There are two ways people use the word \"indie\".\n\nThe independence\n\nFirstly, it's used to mean independent. So indie music would be music produced and distributed by an artist independently or with a small record label not affiliated to one of the big four labels, that is Universal, Warner, Sony, and EMI. This definition of indie has nothing to do with what genre the music is, but with the production and distribution process.\n\nThe genre\n\nThe second way people use the word \"indie\" is to describe a particular genre. In this case, it's used interchangeably with the word \"alternative\", which was used early on to describe a new brand of rock music. Most of the proponents of this different or \"alternative\" style were indie artists. So even now that this alternative style has become mainstream and is sponsored by record labels, the name has stuck.\n\nSo indie music is not only a reference to the means of production and distribution of a song but it's also used to describe a genre. Although I usually work with the first definition, this article is about history so both meanings will overlap at some point.\n\nHistory and Evolution\n\nNow that you know exactly what indie music means, we can effectively dive into its history.\n\nIn the beginning...\n\nIndie music started as an offshoot of rock music in the UK around the 1970s. In its earliest form, indie music featured a DIY culture and independent production and distribution of music. One moment of note, in particular, is the release of the EP called Spiral Scratch EP by the Buzzcocks in 1977. It was the first ever punk record to be independently released and went on to inspire other artists. For the first time, people believed they could release music without a record label. The effect was cataclysmic.\n\nThe 1980s\n\nArguably the most important period in the evolution of indie music, the 1980s saw a boom in the indie artist population. Several bands popped up and took the music scene by storm. One such band was called \"the Smiths\". Formed in 1982, they would go on to be one of the biggest indie artists of their time, some even say of all time. Although they split up after only five years of dominance, the Smiths inspired a new generation of indie artists. This would lead to even more success for indie artists.\n\nThe 1990s\n\nBy the 1990s, there was a new term used to describe indie artists and bands, \"Brit pop\". Indie record labels were now quite popular and continued to help artists and bands find an audience for their music. One such label, Sub Pop Records, was formed in 1988 and they signed a band called Nirvana. Two years later, Nirvana released its second record and it sold over thirty million copies. It was even more proof that success was possible without the big labels.\n\nAnother band that helped define the 1990s was a band called the Oasis. Their debut album released three years after Nirvana's massive album, shot up to the top spot in the UK Album Charts. At this point, indie music remained a thing under rock music. Some people called it alternative rock, and this is where we have an intersection between the two different definitions of the term \"indie\".\n\nThe 2000s\n\nAs more indie record labels sprung up and more indie bands achieved success, more and more people joined the indie train. In 2012, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that between 2003 and 2012, the number of indie artists had increased by a whopping seventy-one percent.\n\nBy now, indie music was no longer a rock thing. It was now a general music affair. There were indie artists from different genres, all playing their trade independently. With the arrival of the internet and social media, the indie community thrived even more.\n\nThe world today\n\nDecades ago, Marshall McLuhan referred to the world as one global village. I wonder what he would call it if he were alive today. The internet and social media have completely changed the way the world works. Indie artists can now reach thousands, even millions, of fans online from anywhere in the world.\n\nIndie music, as it came originally, is still very much a thing. It's grown so big it's almost a genre on its own. Some call it indie, others call it alternative, but it generally means the same thing. This genre has grown so big it might get an offshoot genre of its own.\n\nOur definition of indie music, however, is music that is independently produced and distributed. It's not a genre on its own, instead, it's a part of every genre.\n\nFinally...\n\nSo you learned about the two definitions of indie music. You also followed me on my journey through history to find how indie music has progressed over the years. One thing's for sure. Now, more than ever is the best time to be an indie artist. As the future beckons, what do you think is the next step for indie music?"
