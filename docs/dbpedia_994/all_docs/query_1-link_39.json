        "text": "Alternative rock and indie rock are two distinct sub-genres of rock music that have similarities but also significant differences.\n\nAlternative rock is a genre that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s as a reaction against the mainstream and commercial aspects of popular music. It encompasses a wide range of styles and influences, including punk, post-punk, new wave, college rock, and grunge. Alternative rock is characterized by a distinct sound that often features loud, distorted guitar riffs, irregular time signatures, and introspective, often politically charged lyrics.\n\nIndie rock, on the other hand, is a sub-genre of alternative rock that has developed in parallel and has its roots in the independent music scene. Indie rock is often associated with DIY (do-it-yourself) ethics and an aesthetic that prioritizes artistic integrity over commercial success. Indie rock bands often experiment with different instruments, recording techniques, and song structures to create a unique sound. Indie rock is characterized by a lo-fi production quality and a more stripped-down sound compared to alternative rock.\n\nBoth alternative rock and indie rock are known for their rejection of mainstream values and their focus on artistic expression and experimentation. However, there are also differences in terms of their cultural context and the audiences they cater to. Alternative rock has a broader appeal and is more mainstream, while indie rock has a more niche audience."
