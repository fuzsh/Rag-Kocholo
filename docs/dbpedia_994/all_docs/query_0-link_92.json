        "text": "Wilson and I can't stop arguing about \"alt rock.\" Basically, I think it's a genre and he thinks it's a corporate conspiracy ad campaign. I define it as American rock music from the early 80s or later that's guitar based; eschews hard rock, grunge, classic rock, or pure punk conventions; and is (or was) popular on college campuses and supported by independent record labels. Wilson thinks the term is hopelessly vague, and instead we should be talking about more specific genres like (say) No Wave.\n\nHow to resolve this conundrum? By countin' stuff, of course. That's what I always do. So, this time I counted the number of times the phrase \"alt rock\" was mentioned on Google-indexed web pages along with names of assorted American 80s or 90s rock bands. To make sure the pages actually were talking about those bands and not (say) the element helium or the Buddhist notion of Nirvana or some pretty flowers called posies, I required that the pages also mention the name of the frontman/leader of the band. In cases where there were two singer-songwriters (e.g., the Posies), I required both of their last names to be mentioned. I only looked at bands because names of solo acts are mentioned millions of times in passing, whereas band-frontman combinations only occur on pages that actually say something about the act. So, counts of solo act name appearances would be way too high. That caused me to leave out (say) Beck. Finally, I computed percentages by dividing the number of times the band and frontman names appeared into the number of times those words appeared along with \"alt rock.\"\n\nWe also got into a nasty internecine war over the term \"indie rock.\" I think it means 90s rock that probably would have been called alt ten years earlier, but is also set apart by a certain absurdist attitude and strong influences like Sonic Youth and the Velvet Underground. Wilson thinks it's just the same as \"alt rock,\" a hopelessly vague term that's really a marketing strategy. So, I redid the same analysis but swapped \"indie\" for \"alt\" in the search terms.

Back to numbers: if you compute what's called a \"correlation\" between the alt and indie percentages, you get +0.496. The numbers measure similarity. They can range from -1 (totally different) to +1 (exactly the same), with 0 meaning \"you can't predict one from the other.\" So, you can kind of predict but kind of can't. The two things are related, but different enough that you'd want to talk about them separately.\n\nThere is a core set of 80s rock bands with high alt scores and (often) moderately high indie scores. From the top of the list to the Posies, every single act apart from the Fountains of Wayne had an LP out circa 1986 - 1988. Despite arguable exceptions like the Smithereens, these acts are exactly the ones I thought of as \"alt\" when I was a college DJ at that time.\n\nThere is a set of Boston-area high-volume bands from the latest 80s and early 90s that falls below the Posies point: Dinosaur Jr, Lemonheads, Sebadoh, Blake Babies, Pixies. I think they deserve their own category (anyone know what it's called?). I have no idea why Throwing Muses is in the standard alt rock category instead.\n\nGrunge acts consistently have very low alt and indie scores: Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Hole, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots. Likewise don't-put-me-in-a-category rock band Living Colour. So, \"loud early 90s American rock band\" does not equal \"alt.\" These bands are clearly a well-defined genre.\n\nThe indie scores are really quite high for a set of 90s bands with unpredictable alt scores, most of which were on independent labels like Matador: Fountains of Wayne, Sebadoh, Sleater-Kinney, Blake Babies, Helium, Pavement. If you think about it, Blake Babies makes sense because leader Juliana Hatfield went on to make a bunch of non-grunge records on independent labels. The Camper Van Beethoven score is anomalous. My basic feeling is that when you say \"indie rock,\" you mean independent-label 90s bands of a certain style.\n\nI put in Van Halen and the Beatles just to confirm that the alt and indie indices are measuring something different from just being a rock band. They are.\n\nREM isn't an alt rock band. It's way too mainstream to be alt. Maybe it started out that way, but it isn't now.\n\nThe bizarre Fountains of Wayne score and the amazingly high Pixies raw hit totals really throw me. I have no idea what they mean.\n\nCount your alternatives independently.\n\nMain page\n\nNew additions\n\nPop: 00s 90s 80s 70s 60s 50s\n\nLatin/Jazz\n\nTop 20: DBW JA\n\nE-mail"
