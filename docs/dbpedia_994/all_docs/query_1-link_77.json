        "text": "I have been asked quite a couple of times, in how many music genres I have tried to write songs. I call myself a multi-genre songwriter and composer for a reason, but it has been very hard to give a number. I decided to start a list with different examples that will be maintained regularly.\n\nMy comfort zone\n\nBeing a multi-genre songwriter is hard. You find inspiration everywhere, that youâ€™re constantly dropped out of your comfort zone. Letâ€™s talk, what is easy for me in different roles. Please note that some genres are in brackets, because I cannot enjoy them for personal reasons. This list is from May 2024.\n\nAs a producer / mixing engineer, I love moody, heavy and melancholic music. I enjoy hard drums, heavy guitar riffs and multiple styles of vocals. Itâ€™s easy for me to mix a dense arrangement with vocals, guitars, piano, bass and drums. I feel best doing:\n\nAlternative Rock, Pop Rock, Progressive Metal, Progressive Rock, Blues Rock, Punk Rock, (Electro House), (Hard Trance), (Epic Trance)\n\nAs a composer, I have tons of fun with heavy melancholic and complex music. Iâ€™m a big fan of weird chord progressions and modulations, which is best in progressive genres. But I also do pop music, when Iâ€™m allowed to escape the usual 4 chord scheme. Iâ€™m still taking a break from electronic music. I feel best doing:\n\nProgressive Metal, Progressive Rock, Alternative Rock, Pop Rock, Pop Ballad, (Progressive Trance), (Epic Trance)\n\nAs a lyricist, I enjoy writing heavy lyrics and diving into shady characters. I donâ€™t mind strong language or complicated words. Storytelling ainâ€™t my thing, so I have issues with country and singer-songwriter. My way to write is quite straight and direct â€“ I am not a poet! I only write in English. I feel best doing:\n\nAlternative Rock, Alternative Metal, Nu Metal, Pop Rock, Progressive Metal, Progressive Rock\n\nMy skills as an instrumentalist are inferior, so I have to rely on mid-tempo songs with easy progressions. I hope that I can catch up on that soon and try new genres. My playing is heavy, so donâ€™t bother me with soft emotional songs. I feel best doing:\n\nPop Rock, Alternative Rock, Blues Rock\n\nAs a listener, I love heavy, fast, complex and melancholic music. This could be literally everything, but I donâ€™t enjoy electronic dance music right now. I like listening to:\n\nDjent, Metalcore, Progressive Metal, Nu Metal, Symphonic Metal, Folk Metal, Melodic Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Grunge, Stoner Rock, Indie Rock, Swing, (Aggrotech), (Future Pop), (Electro House), (Epic Trance), (Hard Trance), (Dubstep), (Trip Hop)\n\nThis is NOT for me â€“ neither as listener, musician nor producer:\n\nExperimental, Ambient, New Age, Synthwave, Schlager, Humppa, Retrowave, Future Bass, Hardstyle, Rave, Gabber, Future House, Classical (especially baroque), Neoclassical (exept metal), Bossa Nova, Latin, Free Jazz, Neurofunk, Baile Funk, Contemporary R&B (stuff in the 90s is good though), Mumble Rap, Funk, Reggae, Reggaeton, Danceholl, Grindcore, Speed Metal â€“ And Iâ€™m not a fan of the 70s!\n\nA brief overview\n\nMy list is very long, because I tried many genres. So I decided to write it down as a table. The left column is filled with an emoji, how I feel about trying this genre again. The digit tells the number of finished songs or remixes. Some songs are not online yet, which is why I wrote the numbers in brackets. The links go to YouTube, Bandcamp or SoundCloud, where you can listen to a sample.\n\nHow to interpret the emojis:\n\nðŸ˜„ = I love it and want to do more.\n\nðŸ˜Š = I will try again, when I have ideas.\n\nðŸ˜¥ = I keep on trying, but I havenâ€™t succeeded yet.\n\nðŸ˜” = I gave up, because it doesnâ€™t catch me (anymore)\n\nðŸ˜• = Never again.\n\nElectro\n\nI started writing electronic music in 1998 and producing in 2003. I have tried over 30 subgenres of electronic music and figured out that my home base is trance. Most trance related genre were easy for me, but I struggled really hard in genres that need sound design or rhythm. Electronic music is in hiatus, because I donâ€™t have fun listening, writing nor producing.\n\nPop & Hip Hop\n\nI started composing and writing pop music in 2001, but only around 2005 I was able to collaborate and produce. I need vocalists and guitarists to realize these projects. This is why I see myself as composer, but I also produce and write lyrics. I love big arrangements and acoustic instruments.\n\nRock & Metal\n\nSince 2006, I love writing rock music. After a couple of years, the connection to metal has been given. My guitar playing and singing is not good enough to record the song on my own, so I am dependent on other musicians. I am mostly composer and producer here.\n\nBlues & Jazz\n\nI must admit, that I never came to the idea of writing blues and jazz. I barely listen to this music, but it catches my interest. The more I speak about it, the more I want to try and understand.\n\nOther genres\n\nThere are some other genres that are not connected to modern music. I am sure that this is not the kind of music I want to write or produce.\n\nFinal words\n\nDid you count along? No worries, if not, I succeeded writing and producing songs in roughly 40 genres. Most songs I produced were electronic dance music, but my songwriter soul is bored. Right now I feel best with rock and metal, but I lack of experience with guitar techniques. As instrumentalist, I have no idea where my journey may take me, but as songwriter I feel best in that region in between pop â€“ rock â€“ metal â€“ electro."
