        "text": "ok. Rant time.. First Get off my lawn!!\n\ncheck out iTunes or Spotify and search music under \" Alternative\". what do you see/hear?\n\nWhen did Imagine Dragons become Alternative?? they are totally pop/indie. A good band, good songs but who ever is creating the \" Alternative \" genre these days is moving the needle on bands that should be in that category and including bands that should not be in that category.\n\nThe industry- legacy big labels, seems desperate to feed us their Ai superstars and continue neglecting real bands and real artists that still have some sort of distorted guitars and angst rock.\n\nMaybe I am getting too damn old, but what is called alternative these days is not an alternative to what the category started from.\n\nWhat sounds/bands do you assume as Alternative Genre?\n\nGenre's: What is \"Alternative music \" genre to you?\n\nFor me its music that you're somewhat unfamiliar with and may not like when you first hear it.\n\nBack in the 70;s it was anything that was an alternative to AM top 10, in the 80's anything not FM top 20,\n\n90's same as the 80's 2000'a well its anything that s in your face want on the internet and on AM.FM\n\nThe last 10 years or so, I think Austraiian bands like Northlane and Thornhill might be considered \"alternative\" these days.\n\nAs I appreciate the use of tech in live performance, what I look to get out of music and following bands has changed over the years.\n\nTo me, Alternative is rock that mixes punk influences with any number of eclectic influences. But, if the band can’t draw a line from itself to punk, at least in part, it isn’t alternative. IMHumbleO.\n\nI agree on this. I think Alternative in 90s and onward was mostly counter culture type stuff like early Cult rock, Echo & The Bunnymen, Smiths, etc and then included the \" grunge\" sound.\n\nI wonder if we all are not aware of the moving target that these genre's tend to be?\n\nThis ^. Whatever is not mainstream is 'alternative'. That may be because it's a new style, a new take on an old/existing style or it's just very 'fringe'.\n\nyou can thank Rolling Stone magazine for all the genre-twisting BS...\n\nwhen alternative was originally coined, it was a specific sound.\n\nThe 2 bands that paved the way were U2 & the Alarm...\n\nthen, when the '90s rolled along, they changed it to mean anything out of Seattle...\n\njust like R&B. (rhythm & blues), R&B used to be Chuck Berry & the like. Now it's adult contemporary black music...\n\nthe folk at RS magazine gave themselves the self-important task of defining things for you, like genre, even if they themselves are genre confused.\n\nWhen I was a kid, Jam bands were bands that went on tangents & jammed. Groups like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, UFO, etc. They'd extend their songs to 15-30 minutes, because there wasn't enough time to do all the jamming w/in the commercial constraints, so they improv'd, let loose & jammed until the song met it's ideal capacity.\n\nNow, they attribute Jam to bands that don't really jam...\n\nThese days I don't really think it means much.\n\nWhen I was younger alternative meant \"too weird for FM corporate rock stations\".\n\nBack then FM radio had gotten very stagnant and only played big name bands that were backed by big labels.\n\nSure was a welcome relief when Detroit got it's first alt/punk radio station; the funny thing was 89X was actually a Canadian station.\n\nOf course the trend had been rolling for awhile in the form of college radio stations that had tried to expose music that could not crack mainstream radio playlists.\n\njust like R&B. (rhythm & blues), R&B used to be Chuck Berry & the like. Now it's adult contemporary black music...\n\nI've heard a few people refer to the adult contemporary black music, as you so eloquently put it, as Rhythm & Bass, thus making a distinction between the two. Not sure if that's correct or commonplace, though. It seems more applicable as there sure ain't much blues in there.\n\nI agree that the critics/self-appointed \"thought leaders\" are responsible for pulling genres out of their asses, but the business end of the music biz has had a heavy hand in it too. I think it'sbecause they get a chance to \"curate\" content on streaming platforms, SiriusXM etc with the thought they are targeting consumers. Then all the up and coming bands made sure to identify their niche, enabling the labelmakers in the process. One thing I loved about radio back in the day when FM was exploding - you never knew what was coming next. Dylan followed by Albert King followed by Gabor Szabo followed by Hendrix followed by Ravi Shankar. Never happen today with all the specific, anally identified genres. I think you need tunnel vision so you can see only one at a time, because some of them sound so much alike you need an industry \"expert\" to explain to you what you're hearing.\n\nThese days I don't really think it means much.\n\nWhen I was younger alternative meant \"too weird for FM corporate rock stations\".\n\nBack then FM radio had gotten very stagnant and only played big name bands that were backed by big labels.\n\nSure was a welcome relief when Detroit got it's first alt/punk radio station; the funny thing was 89X was actually a Canadian station.\n\nOf course the trend had been rolling for awhile in the form of college radio stations that had tried to expose music that could not crack mainstream radio playlists.\n\nGreat points. REM and Dave Mathews, among others had good success on grass roots gigs and college radio to build the following and reach stations that played less corporate rock.\n\nI agree that the critics/self-appointed \"thought leaders\" are responsible for pulling genres out of their asses, but the business end of the music biz has had a heavy hand in it too.
