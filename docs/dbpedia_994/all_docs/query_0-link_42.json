        "text": "LUDWIG* CLUB DATE.\n\nThis is a ’60s Ludwig* kit with thin shells, sized 20″, 12″ and 14”. The Club Date design uses a single central lug on each shell that accepts a tension rod from each head rather than two separate lugs, so the shells have less weight and fewer mechanical attachments. Though it was designed to lower the parts count and cost, this feature makes the drums slightly more resonant and lively than shells made with separate lugs. We kept it skinned with Remo Rennaissance heads, which have an elastic bounce with fewer high overtones than other single ply heads, while still having a strong fundamental pitch and clear sustain. The toms are tuned with the bottom head slightly higher in pitch than the top heads, which causes a slight rise in the pitch as the drums sustain. The additional drums added to fill out the compliment of toms are other Ludwig* toms from the same era, tuned similarly. The bass drum features a full front (resonant) head, which provides a singing sustain with extended decay. The snare drum is a WFL 3×13” piccolo with a calfskin batter head. This drum has a short, dry and percussive midrange-voiced sound that is most expressive at the lower end of the dynamic range.\n\nDW* COLLECTOR’S SERIES.\n\nThis is a thoroughly contemporary kit made with modern materials and processes, so the tolerances and behavior of the drums are both predictable and consistent. The kit has large sizes (24″, 15″, 16″ and 18”) and Remo Emperor batter heads to control the irregular high-harmonic modes of the larger heads (and Remo Ambassador heads for the resonant side). These drums are characterized by a strong attack and fundamental tone with few overtones and a smooth fast decay. These drums are tuned with the resonant head slightly lower in pitch than the batter head, which causes a slight drop in pitch as the drum sound decays. The bass drum has a Superkick II head for strong attack with quick decay and the resonant head has a hole in it. The the decay is fast and suitable for quick patterns, despite its size. The DW* 5×14” snare drum is the same shell construction as the rest of the kit and has a Remo CS batter head and a Diplomat-weight snare bottom head with a 2″ strainer. It has a modest amount of shell tone and a quick decay.\n\nWhen and how did you realize your passion for music?\n\nI realized it when I was about five. My brother was already five years older and took a liking to playing guitar. So I would set up chairs and tape things to the ceiling as cymbals and beat along to the radio and him practicing. My favorite bands at the time, being born in 1984 and really growing up through MTV and the ’90s, were Metallica, Motley Crue, Wrathchild America and bands like that.\n\nHow come you ended up behind the kit?\n\nWell, beating on chairs in the house my drums got bigger and bigger, to a point where I beat all the cushioning out from all the seats in the house. My father had nowhere to seat company and figured it was time for real drums. A couple years down the road, I finally got a real set. Everybody else seemed to play the bass or the guitar, so we always needed someone to play drums. It just felt really comfortable and natural to me.\n\nGrowing up, what style did you start out aspiring to play?\n\nI began playing ’90s rock, anything from Damn Yankees to Pantera. Whatever Headbangers Ball was playing is what I wanted to learn. Wrathchild America’s “3-D” was a really big influence to me I knew that record from front to back at a young age, it was almost a ritual to practice to that record.\n\nHow was it working with an industry icon like Steve Albini in his own studio Electrical Audio?\n\nYeah that’s still like, did that really happen? Steve is such a professional and it was just really inspiring watching him work and see firsthand how he hooks up a drum sound. We also got to use some of the drums he’s got in the studio. The drum room was incredibly audible, so for the delicate and very controlled hits we were getting for the pack, the room was absolutely perfect. Steve is really cool about talking tech, like why he’s mixing a certain tom this way and why he likes to do it like this as opposed to other traditional ways. So that was great as I’m a recording junky and I love the whole process of it. My ears always perk up when someone’s talking about recording techniques.\n\nThere are some unique kits and instruments captured in the Alt-Rock EZX, how was the process of picking these out?\n\nYeah, those came out of the “drumgeon” Steve’s got at the studio. So again it was a lot of us picking drums out, hitting them, tuning them, hitting them again and trying out mics. The whole process was very detail oriented.\n\nLooking back on this whole project, what do you personally take away from the experience?\n\nHow lucky and blessed I am to have been drawn to playing drums at five. Music has molded and changed my life in many different ways and has given me countless amounts of lifelong memories. This experience is definitely one of the top moments especially because of how personal this project was to me. From sampling one drum and cymbal at a time on multiple kits to recording the huge library of MIDI grooves, it’s been a special project for me. It’s different from recording a couple songs on a CD that will always be the same. This is an infinite amount CDs and an endless amount of grooves.\n\nWhat do you hope end-users of the Alt-Rock EZX will take away from both your grooves and the sounds?\n\nI hope people get a lot of use from everything this pack has to offer. I’m hoping they’re able to craft cool brew out of the ingredients we’ve given them. I hope they find something in here that they’ve been searching out for months. I really hope their happy and pleased with their investment.\n\nName: Paul Szlachta\n\nLocation: Chicago, IL"
