        "text": "Welcome to the eclectic indie music world, where genre boundaries blur and creativity reigns supreme. This isn’t just about off-the-beaten-path tunes; it’s an auditory adventure across various sub-genres that shape the indie scene. Whether you’re canvassing the vibrant world of indie beats or a connoisseur looking to broaden your horizon, this guide is your backstage pass to understanding indie music’s intricate definitions and unearthing gems from some of the most compelling artists today.\n\nPlus, for indie artists aiming to climb the charts, we’ve got insights on skyrocketing your visibility in the indie music sphere.\n\nBut first, are you an indie artist looking for more ways to get your music heard by the masses? Check out Groover, one of the industry’s leading playlist submission platforms, and you can instantly supercharge your reach by exposing your music to hundreds of potential playlist curators and thousands of potential fans.\n\nPopular Indie Artists\n\nThe Strokes\n\nPhoebe Bridgers\n\nGrouplove\n\nDjo\n\nClairo\n\nWhat Does “Indie Music” Mean?\n\nTechnically, indie music isn’t a genre. It’s a business model.\n\nThe word “indie” is a shortened form of “independent.” In the music world, “indie music” refers most literally to music released independently by an artist (as opposed to through a record label).\n\nConsider the pros & cons of a major label vs. an indie label vs. staying independent\n\nIf you look at indie music this way, sonic characteristics don’t matter when determining what songs “count” as indie music. A.K.A. songs as poppy as Katy Perry’s hits or as twangy as country artist Morgan Wallen’s could still technically be indie. Again, this is because any song can be considered indie so long as it’s released independently.\n\nBut… it’s not that simple.\n\nWhat Does Indie Music Sound Like?\n\nSome argue indie music does have its sound.\n\nPeople who believe this might claim that DIY release’s artistic freedom and low-budget nature results in grittier and quirkier tracks than music produced for a major label. This implies that indie music does have its own unique set of auditory characteristics… and that it could be considered a genre.\n\nAre you looking to make some DIY tunes, too? You can even start with Garageband\n\nFor example, listen to NJ-based indie band Phoneboy’s song: “Hey, Kid!”\n\nUnlike super-smooth, ultra-produced pop tunes that sound like they’ve been infused with plastic and preservatives, “Hey, Kid!” has low-fi grit. The intro’s high-pitched, spoken call-out (“Ricky, clean your room!”) is unorthodox. It epitomizes the uniqueness and creativity that sprouts from DIY music production.\n\nIf I heard this song without context, I’d probably guess it’s indie music.\n\nBut, again… it’s not that simple.\n\nWhat Counts as Indie Music?\n\nWhen addressing “What Counts as Indie Music?”, one enters an intricate landscape that intertwines sound, production, and distribution philosophies. The term ‘indie’ has dual connotations: it denotes an aesthetic musical style characterized by a certain degree of eccentricity and homemade authenticity, as well as a mode of production and distribution outside the mainstream music industry, typically on independent labels.\n\nThe lines start to blur when an artist, celebrated for their indie sound and ethos, is signed by a major label yet continues to produce music that embodies the ‘indie’ spirit. Can they still be deemed ‘indie’? A case study for this is the band Vampire Weekend, whose journey epitomizes the blurred boundaries of indie music.\n\nVampire Weekend they have started their journey steeped in indie ethos. They collaborated with the indie label XL Recordings and garnered a considerable following for their distinct indie sound. Their music consistently featured on several indie charts, echoing the indie band archetype in terms of sound, vibe, and fanbase. Their track “A-Punk,” which was independently released, perfectly encapsulates their indie spirit.\n\nThis scenario gives rise to thought-provoking questions regarding the essence of indie music. Is it defined purely by its distinct sound and vibe? Or is it more about the independent ethos of the production process? The fluidity and evolving nature of the music industry further complicates these definitions, making indie music a fascinating, dynamic genre.\n\nThen, they signed with Columbia Records—a very non-indie label. Columbia has signed artists such as Beyonce, Journey, and Johnny Cash for reference.\n\nHere’s “Harmony Hall,” which Vampire Weekend released through Columbia. See if you hear a difference.\n\nSo… is Vampire Weekend still an indie band?\n\nIf you say indie music is a genre, yes if you define it as a business model, no.\n\nUp to you.\n\nWhat Is an Example of Indie Music?\n\nIndie music is a multi-faceted landscape, with countless hues coloring its definition. As a genre, it sprawls across numerous sub-genres, each with its unique nuances, contributing to the overall diversity of the indie music realm. Whether you are just beginning your indie music journey or have an established taste for its varied flavors, there’s a whole world of sub-genres ready to offer you something fresh and exciting.\n\nThese sub-genres range from the lo-fi intimacy of indie folk to the heavy riffs of indie rock, from the electronic undertones of indietronica to the raw energy of indie punk. Each sub-genre encapsulates a different facet of the indie music ethos, promising a rich and immersive sonic experience. So, dive into this expansive collection and discover a new indie sub-genre that resonates with your musical inclinations.\n\n7 Essential Indie Subgenres\n\nIndie Rock\n\nOne of the most popular and well-known indie subgenera is indie rock. Indie rock combines the guitar-based, driving rhythm of rock with that signature gritty indie sound. This subgenre usually follows a pop form but doesn’t try to appeal to mainstream trends or commercial demands.\n\nIndietronica (Indie Electronic)\n\nElectronic indie music (a.k.a. indietronica) got going when advanced electronic music could be made using a laptop. These tracks are usually made in DAWs (digital audio workstations) and include drum machines and synths.\n\nBefore laptops, electronic artists would fuse acoustic and electronic sounds by physically splicing and combining tapes. Modern indietronica artists: be grateful you can craft your magnum opus by tapping little plastic squares.\n\nIndie Pop\n\nAnother indie sub-genre staple, indie pop songs have upbeat melodies and pop buoyancy but don’t entirely lock into the mainstream zeitgeist. However, what separates indie pop from mainstream pop is the DIY attitude surrounding it and the slightly quirkier nature of independently produced tunes.\n\nDream Pop\n\nFuzzy, glowy, hazy, and warm, dream pop are the golden clouds of a dewy summer sunset. Okay—that’s a bit cryptic. Dream pop lies between indie and psychedelic rock, but it’s softer than both. You’ll usually find pop melodies mixed with reverb-heavy guitar.\n\nThere’s a lot of controversy over whether dream pop is the same as a genre called “shoegaze.” Shoegaze gets its funky title from the music’s tendency to lull performers and listeners into a spaced-out stare at their shoes—almost as if in a daze. People will argue both ways, but I believe they differ while there is some overlap. Dream pop encompasses more dynamically structured music; putting on an actual shoegaze album feels like listening to a wall of fuzzy sound.\n\nDream pop fans will love our recs for artists who sound like Her’s.\n\nIndie Folk\n\nAcoustic rawness is a core element of indie folk. That almost always means acoustic guitar or some similar string instrument. Vocals on indie folk music are mostly natural-sounding, and it’s not uncommon for those vocals to be soft and vibrato-heavy. Of course, indie folk has its roots in traditional folk music.\n\nIndie Rap / Indie Hip Hop\n\nThink of the 4/4 drum machine beats and sick lines that define your favorite hip-hop tracks. Now, imagine them a bit calmer (almost as if influenced by lo-fi), funkier, and more vocal about social issues and anti-commercial sentiment. That’s indie rap/hip hop.\n\nFor more fresh indie rap/hip hop, check out our hand-picked 2022 favs.\n\nChamber Pop\n\nImagine combining pop and rock with harmonies, piano, and orchestral instruments. Now, imagine weaving all that together into an intricate-yet-easily-listenable masterpiece. Chamber pop does just that, often through highly technical methods such as counterpoint. Some also refer to this sub-genre as baroque pop."
