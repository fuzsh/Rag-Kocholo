        "text": "I've played a video game Need for Speed Most Wanted, and I came across a weird trend it's it's soundtrack: there were many songs that had hip-hop/rap style, but were backed up by heavy (distorted, industrial rock) guitar chords, something we usually see in rock songs. Mind that there is no real structure of the \"rock\" part of the song, as there is no solo parts, and guitar almost never gets into focus, so I could be wrong when I label simple power chords as a defining characteristic of a rock song.\n\nSongs like Nine Thou (Styles Of Beyond), I Am Rock (Rock), Skinnyman (Static-X) all have those rock elements, while generally being rap-ish.\n\nIs such rock influence a result of the time of the making, and the culture that was dominant that time (putting rock chords may have been the trend now), or was it a completely new genre that developed on it's own?\n\nMixing rap and rock is about as old as rap. Take Run-DMC's version of Aerosmith's \"Walk this Way\", or the early Beastie Boys, or Public Enemy recording with Anthrax, or Ice-T's Body Count project.\n\nI think some people would put the groups you list in different categories. There's Rap rock and Nu Metal, and some alternative metal has rap/hip-hop components. I'm not enough of a fan to be able to make authoritative genre calls, but it seems to come down to gradations of rhythm and vocal style. Google will tell you that Static-X is nu metal and Styles of Beyond is rap rock.\n\nanswered May 10, 2015 at 16:21\n\nJoe GermuskaJoe Germuska\n\n1,40799 silver badges2020 bronze badges"
