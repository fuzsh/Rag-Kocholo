        "text": "1. ALTERNATIVE / INDIE ROCK BY HAMZA HASAN\n\n2. ALTERNATIVE ROCK Alternative rock isa genre of rock music that emerged from the underground music scene of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s. The term \"alternative\" was coined in the 1980s to describe punk rock-inspired bands on independent record labels that did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time. As a musical genre, alternative rock consists of various subgenres that have emerged from the independent music scene since the 1980s, such as grunge, Britpop, gothic rock, and indie pop. These genres are unified by their collective debt to the style and/or ethos of punk, which laid the groundwork for alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre is considered to be rock, some of its subgenres are influenced by folk music, reggae, electronic music and jazz among other genres. At times alternative rock has been used as a catch-all phrase for rock music from underground artists in the 1980s, all music descended from punk rock (including punk itself, New Wave, and post-punk), and, ironically, for rock musicin general in the 1990s and 2000s. While a few artists like R.E.M. and The Cure achieved commercial success and mainstream critical recognition, many alternative rock artists during the 1980s were cult acts that recorded on independent labels and received their exposure through college radio airplay and word-of- mouth. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the early 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became commercially successful.\n\n3. EXAMPLE:PARAMORE This is a very popular band called Paramore. They are very similar in terms of genre and what they do in their music videos. For example in this song called “ignorance” they have a mix in their video of a performance element and a spectacle element. This is what we want to do to an extent. We would like to have the performance element in the video as seen in this still. Although we also want to have a mix in the video as we want to have a narrative based story line throughout\n\n4. INDIE ROCK Many indie rock bands are characterized by the use of unique or less-popular instruments. Subjectively (since music is subjective), indie rock cds typically sound less \"perfect\" than mainstream music, which typically grabs the attention of indie rock enthusiasts. Indie rock is a mixture of many other genres, including alternative rock, folk music, electronica, even pop. It also tends to be very positive music, despite popular opinion. It is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s.Indie rock was extremely diverse, with subgenres that include indie pop and lo-fi among others."
