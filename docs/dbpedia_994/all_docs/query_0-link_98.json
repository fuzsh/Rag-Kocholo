        "text": "Recently you may have noticed a large emergence of new artists in mainstream media. Indie and Alternative musicians like Cave Town, Conan Gray, Lemon Demon, Mitski, Lana Del Ray, Marina, and the Diamonds, etc. have been popping into people’s feeds and radio stations more and more.\n\nOddly enough, alternative music is becoming the new “pop” music in a way. Now, alternative music at its core is intrinsically different from pop music, and that’s one of the genre’s defining characteristics, but in terms of popularity among younger generations, particularly Gen Z, alternative and indie styles of music are making their homes on this generation’s playlists.\n\nCurrently, Gen-Z is somewhere around the age of 12 to 22. In other words, they’re teens and young adults. Gen Z is at that special age where they begin to forge their own identities, and what better way to do so than by curating their own taste in music?\n\nWhat may be interesting to learn is how and why Gen Z is being drawn towards these alt music styles versus pop music. It is a combination of social media, pop culture, and the generations’ values.\n\nThere’s something about finding a new artist who can offer you a new sound that is very exciting, but it could also be argued that it fulfills gen Z’s craving for new content and stimuli, no doubt brought on by social media. Furthermore, social media platforms like TikTok, and now Instagram “Reels,” are known for the popularization of songs and artists through the use of specific audio clips. By using songs from artists who aren’t particularly popular to produce digital content, the songs gain popularity. This effect is only further enhanced when these types of videos go viral or even become trends.\n\nPop culture has also had a strong influence on the generations’ inclination towards more underground music. With hit shows like Stranger Things and The Umbrella Academy featuring music by more old-school alternative artists. We can thank these shows for the revival of music by artists like Talking Heads, KISS, The Cramps, They Might Be Giants and Kate Bush. The latter’s song “Running Up That Hill,” was featured in the latest season of Stranger Things and consequently went viral on social media platforms, leading to the song skyrocketing to the number one spot on the Billboard Global 200 Chart.\n\nThis generation’s shift in musical taste largely has to do with a shifting worldview and values. People are no longer seeking catchy hooks with redundant themes of youth and traditional romances but songs that can capture a wider range of emotions and tell more stories. Alternative music, with its wide range of themes from political upheaval to inclusivity, offers itself to this generation."
