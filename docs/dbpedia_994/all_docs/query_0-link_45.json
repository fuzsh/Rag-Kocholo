        "text": "Every few months, when I’ve exhausted my 105 painstakingly curated Spotify playlists, I do a deep dive through the platform’s genre tabs as well as Instagram and TikTok — the latter two often delivering fantastic results — in hopes of discovering indie newcomers as well as revisit others who have new material out or are slated to in the upcoming months.\n\nIt inspired me to create a new series for The Riff, lovingly dubbed “undercurrents,” as these artists have massive potential to rise and shape the new indie landscape (or are already on their way).\n\nWithout further ado, here are my picks for the first edition of Undercurrents:\n\n1. The Band CAMINO\n\nSince The Band CAMINO’s inception in 2015, their steady rise in the indie world cannot go unnoticed. The Memphis-originated, Nashville-based trio burst onto the scene with the heartfelt EP My Thoughts On You, a lovelorn, gut-punching set of songs inspired by ex-relationships, heartbreak, and self-discovery.\n\nThe group’s sound on their first release captured both the youthful aura of happysad indie tracks (“2/14\" and “Free of Charge”) being released by powerhouses of the early 2010s — to my ear, notably Phoenix, Vampire Weekend, and COIN — as well as the brooding piano ballads (“Black and White”) that shaped an entirely separate sector of the alt landscape (a la James Bay and Tom Odell).\n\nOver the years, their sound noticeably evolved into electric-fused-power pop, seamlessly blending anthemic rock elements with electronica, topped off with the ear-worm hooks of the late 90s and early 2000s. I credit their 2019 tryhard EP with carving out a space for that sound in modern indie. “Daphne Blue” pulls from 2000s-era bangers with the magnetism and allure of The Killers’ Mr. Brightside, while “Farsighted” and “Honest” pull more from contemporary indie pop influences like Neon Trees and The 1975.\n\nYet, influences be damned, The Band CAMINO separates themselves from their predecessors to create a sound that’s completely their own. With a strong presence in the scene for the past nine years, I’m hearing their influence in younger indie artists (spoiler alert!), and I couldn’t be happier.\n\nThis year’s release, The Dark, feels like a full realization of their sonic identity, with an unstoppable energy and urgency from start to finish. The album opens with “Told You So,” a coy revenge anthem brimming with bittersweet angst. The last track on the proverbial A-side is the delightfully juxtaposed “It’s Not Me (It’s You),” a bouncy synth-pop banger reminiscent of MIKA’s “My Interpretation” through its upbeat instrumental and depressing lyrics. The album’s closer, “Last Man In the World,” is an anthemic pop-rock effort that feels like the song equivalent to a large iced red-eye in the best possible way.\n\nLISTEN to ‘The Dark’ here:\n\n2. The Backfires\n\nHailing from both sides of the Atlantic and residing in New York City, The Backfires encapsulate a sound and aesthetic of two golden eras: post-punk indie rock of the 80s and its revival in the early 2000s-2010s.\n\nThe rockers arrived on the scene in 2021 with EP “Consider the Backfires” (a possible reference to the late writing legend David Foster Wallace’s 2004 essay collection Consider the Lobster), a collection of six songs that feel like a mid-2000s NME darling. On “Going Gets Easy,” the opening riff has a real War Pigs vibe before softening into a bouncy, nostalgic recounting of late nights and bygone times. The closer, “Before the Sunrise,” harkens back to Arctic Monkeys’ fantastically frantic tracks of their 2006 debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not, an underrated and hard-to-find replicate sound in modern indie, but these guys absolutely nailed it.\n\nTheir 2022 outing, “Blindsided,” is nothing short of alternative bliss. A bittersweet tale of a love gone sour, the lyrics pack a simple yet perfect punch:\n\nYou never really know\n\nIt’s not all just for show\n\nUntil I want you on the phone\n\nMy passenger side still\n\nSmells like Chanel you spilled\n\nI can see your lights in the mirror\n\nI’ll slow down if you come nearer\n\nIn my pocket’s a four leaf clover\n\nPull me to the side, just run me over\n\n“Joyride,” their latest single, hits all the highs and captures a unique but familiar sound. Blending the timeless, delightfully fuzzy guitar riffs ala Joy Division’s “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” and the emphatic, lovelorn lyrics of youth and loss in the vein of indie greats Catfish and The Bottlemen and Arctic Monkeys, the group seamlessly incorporates a number of influences into their work while sounding completely fresh and fun.\n\nLuckily for me, The Backfires are coming to Buffalo next month, and I can’t wait to hear them live.\n\nLISTEN to “Joyride” AND“Blindsided” HERE:\n\n3. Sid Simons\n\nAnother newcomer out of NYC is Sid Simons, whose first three (and only) releases have absolutely blown me away with his stellar production, powerful vocal performance and soul-infused instrumentals.\n\nSimons arrived on the scene in 2020 with his band GIRL SKIN, for which he was the primary singer/songwriter and producer. Now, under his own name, he’s released three singles, “Wendy,” “Three Days,” and “Dead Ringer,” all in anticipation of his upcoming record Beneath the Brightest Smiles.\n\n“Wendy,” an insanely catchy, groove-infused Songs About Jane-esque track, is, on the surface, about a girl who can’t make up her mind, always sending mixed signals. In reality, the inspiration for the song was actually about a GPS Simons and his friends dubbed ‘Wendy’ during a road trip that “malfunctioned every other hour…she’d try to send us off into a lake or drive us off a bridge.”\n\nSimons has been quite the world traveler: a native of Portland, Oregon, he’s moved everywhere from Sydney, Australia, to Shanghai, China, now residing in Brooklyn. Simons credits his global upbringing as a major inspiration for his work, namely “Dead Ringer,” a Gordon Lightfoot-meets-Elliot Smith style retrospective of shared loneliness, the human experience, and a city past its prime. Simons said the track was inspired by a recent visit he took to an unnamed place:\n\n“A little while ago I went to a new city and the experience was… kind of shocking. It was the most homogeneous, dehumanizing place I’d ever seen, he said. “It was like a repeating pattern wallpaper. Rows and rows of identical houses and identical humans in identical chinos. It looked like the future — as seen from the past.”\n\n“Dead Ringer” feels equally familiar, and like nothing else I’ve ever heard, it has the sonic earmarks of blues and classic rock with stunning lyrics that evoke the observations of a lost soul and society in decay. It packs a hard punch by asking age-old rhetorical questions— What happened here? Do the people here lead lives as rich and complicated as ours or has the monotony rotted our cores? Is shared loneliness truly a cornerstone of the human experience? Will I recognize myself in five, 10, or 20 years or become a ‘dead ringer’ to my older self?\n\nI don’t know about everyone else, but the track is a gut-punch of adult realism and youthful optimism for me. I can’t get enough of it and am beyond stoked for the forthcoming record.\n\nLISTEN TO “Dead Ringer,” “Wendy” AND “Three Days” HERE:\n\nLet me know your thoughts, musings, and any recommendations for future Undercurrents in the comments below!"
