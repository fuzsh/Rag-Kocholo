        "text": "Alternative music is a genre that has been around since the 1970s, but it gained popularity in the 1990s. It is often described as music that is produced by performers who are outside the musical mainstream. Alternative music is typically regarded as more eclectic, original, or challenging than most popular music genres such as conventional rock, pop, or country.\n\nThe term “alternative” refers to the genre’s distinction from mainstream or commercial rock or pop music. Alternative rock emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1990s. It is built on distorted guitars and rooted in generational discontent that dominated and changed rock music between 1991 and 1996. It burst into the mainstream when “Smells Like Teen Spirit” became a national hit.\n\nBeing defined as something “other” has always left alternative music with an essential identity crisis. Alternative music is often seen as a form of rebellion or a way to express oneself differently. It is a genre that is constantly evolving and pushing boundaries. In this article, we will explore the history and characteristics of alternative music, as well as some of the most influential artists in the genre.\n\nOrigins of Alternative Music\n\nAlternative music emerged in the 1970s from the punk rock movement. Punk rockers rejected the mainstream music industry and created their own independent music scene. The punk movement was characterized by fast-paced, aggressive music and lyrics that challenged societal norms.\n\nOne of the most influential bands of the punk movement was the Velvet Underground. Their music was experimental and unconventional, incorporating elements of avant-garde, rock, and pop. The Velvet Underground’s influence can be heard in many alternative genres that followed, including new wave and alternative rock.\n\nNew wave emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a subgenre of punk and post-punk. It was characterized by its use of synthesizers and electronic instruments, as well as its emphasis on fashion and style. New wave bands, such as Blondie and Talking Heads, had a more polished sound than punk rockers and often incorporated elements of pop and rock into their music.\n\nAlternative rock gained popularity in the 1990s, with bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam leading the way. Alternative rock was characterized by its rejection of the commercialism of mainstream rock and its emphasis on authenticity and raw emotion. Alternative rock also incorporated elements of punk, grunge, and indie rock.\n\nalternative music has its roots in the punk rock movement of the 1970s. It has since evolved into many different subgenres, including new wave and alternative rock. The influence of the Velvet Underground can be heard in many of these genres, and the rejection of mainstream commercialism remains a defining characteristic of alternative music to this day.\n\nDefining Alternative Music\n\nAlternative music is a genre of music that is produced by performers who are outside the musical mainstream. It is typically regarded as more eclectic, original, or challenging than most popular music such as conventional rock, pop, or country. Alternative music is often distributed by independent record labels.\n\nAlternative music emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1990s. The term “alternative” refers to the genre’s distinction from mainstream or commercial rock or pop music.\n\nAlternative music encompasses a wide range of sub-genres such as alternative rock, alternative pop, alternative country, alternative hip hop, indie, pop, rock, punk rock, new wave, indie pop, indie rock, grunge, shoegaze, post-punk, post-rock, progressive rock, hardcore punk, post-grunge, riot grrrl, and garage rock.\n\nAlternative rock is one of the most popular sub-genres of alternative music. It is characterized by distorted guitars, unconventional song structures, and lyrics that often deal with social and political issues. Alternative pop, on the other hand, is a more melodic and accessible form of alternative music that incorporates elements of pop music.\n\nIndie music is another sub-genre of alternative music that is characterized by its DIY ethos and independent spirit. Indie rock, indie pop, and indie folk are some of the most popular sub-genres of indie music.\n\nGrunge is a sub-genre of alternative rock that emerged in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in the mid-1980s. It is characterized by its heavy, distorted guitar sound and its angst-ridden lyrics.\n\nShoegaze is another sub-genre of alternative rock that emerged in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s. It is characterized by its use of heavily distorted guitars and ethereal vocals.\n\nPost-punk and post-rock are two other sub-genres of alternative music that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Post-punk is characterized by its use of angular guitar riffs and its experimental approach to songwriting. Post-rock, on the other hand, is characterized by its use of unconventional song structures and its incorporation of elements of classical music.\n\nalternative music is a diverse and eclectic genre that encompasses a wide range of sub-genres. It is often characterized by its independent spirit, unconventional song structures, and socially and politically conscious lyrics.\n\nEvolution and Subgenres\n\nAlternative music emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1990s. It is a category of rock music that is distinct from mainstream or commercial rock or pop music. Alternative music is characterized by its unconventional sound and its rejection of the traditional norms of the music industry.\n\nAs alternative music gained popularity, it developed into various subgenres. These subgenres are characterized by their unique sound and style, as well as their connection to alternative music. Some of the most notable subgenres of alternative music include:\n\nIndie rock: Indie rock is characterized by its DIY ethos and its rejection of the mainstream music industry. It often features jangly guitars and introspective lyrics.\n\nGrunge: Grunge emerged in the early 1990s and is characterized by its heavy, distorted sound and its angsty lyrics. Bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam are often associated with this subgenre.\n\nShoegaze: Shoegaze is characterized by its ethereal sound and its use of feedback and distortion. It often features dreamy vocals and hazy guitars.\n\nPost-punk: Post-punk emerged in the late 1970s and is characterized by its angular guitars and its use of synthesizers. Bands like Joy Division and Gang of Four are often associated with this subgenre.\n\nRiot grrrl: Riot grrrl emerged in the early 1990s and is characterized by its feminist lyrics and its DIY ethos. Bands like Bikini Kill and Sleater-Kinney are often associated with this subgenre.\n\nGarage rock: Garage rock is characterized by its raw sound and its use of lo-fi recording techniques. It often features simple chord progressions and catchy hooks.\n\nThese subgenres are just a few examples of the diverse range of music that falls under the umbrella of alternative music. As the genre continues to evolve, new subgenres are likely to emerge, each with its own unique sound and style.\n\nInfluence on Mainstream Music\n\nAlternative music had a significant influence on mainstream music. The genre emerged in the 1980s as a response to the commercialization of rock music. Alternative music was characterized by its DIY ethos, its focus on lyrics, and its use of unconventional instruments.\n\nBy the early 1990s, alternative music had become increasingly popular. Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” released in 1991, became an anthem for disaffected youth and helped to propel alternative music into the mainstream. The band’s album “Nevermind” sold over 30 million copies worldwide and is widely regarded as one of the most influential albums of the 1990s.\n\nAlternative music’s influence on mainstream music can be seen in the rise of pop-punk and emo in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Bands like Blink-182 and My Chemical Romance incorporated elements of alternative music into their pop-punk and emo sound, creating a new subgenre of rock music that was both accessible and emotionally raw.\n\nToday, alternative music continues to influence mainstream music. Many pop artists, such as Billie Eilish and Lorde, incorporate elements of alternative music into their sound, creating a new subgenre of pop music that is both dark and introspective.\n\nalternative music has had a significant influence on mainstream music. Its DIY ethos, focus on lyrics, and use of unconventional instruments have helped to shape the musical mainstream. From Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” to Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy,” alternative music continues to push the boundaries of pop music and inspire a new generation of musicians.\n\nAlternative Music and the Music Industry\n\nAlternative music has always been a genre that exists outside of the mainstream music industry. Independent record labels played a crucial role in the development of alternative music in the 1980s and 1990s. These labels provided a platform for artists who were not signed to major record labels and gave them a chance to have their music heard by a wider audience.\n\nCollege radio stations also played a significant role in the development of alternative music. These stations were often the first to play new and emerging artists, and their support helped to build a fan base for many alternative bands. In addition, music publications like NME and Spin Magazine helped to promote alternative music to a wider audience.\n\nDespite the success of alternative music, many independent labels struggled to compete with major record labels. The music industry is dominated by a few major players, and independent labels often struggle to get their music heard by a wider audience. However, alternative music continues to thrive, and many independent labels continue to release innovative and exciting music.\n\nIn recent years, the line between alternative and mainstream music has become increasingly blurred. Many alternative bands have found success on the mainstream charts, and some mainstream artists have incorporated elements of alternative music into their sound. As a result, the definition of alternative music has become more fluid, and the genre continues to evolve and expand.\n\nNotable Alternative Artists and Bands\n\nAlternative music has produced a number of notable artists and bands over the years.
