It includes many subcategories including but not limited to; Grunge, Hard Rock, Rock, Experimental Rock, Progressive Rock, Gothic Rock, Punk Rock, Hardcore Punk, New Wave. Their only real connection in terms of roots is the English punk movement. In the early eighties alternative music was limited to a few college radio stations. In the mid 80s as it became more popular It began to take over college radio throughout the country. In the late 80s commercial stations slowly began to embrace what up till then had been known as college rock. They never sold many albums but the influence on the music community would be felt in a big way soon when the format evolved to the next stage.\n\nAlternative Rock\n\nCollege Rock\n\nExperimental Rock\n\nGoth Rock\n\nGrunge\n\nHardcore Punk\n\nHard Rock\n\nIndie Rock\n\nNew Wave\n\nProgressive Rock\n\nPunk\n\nShoegaze (with thanks to Jackie Herrera)\n\nSteampunk (with thx to Christopher Schaeffer)\n\nAlternative Music Genre Example Bands Example Songs Art Punk Talking Heads, Wire, Devo “Psycho Killer” by Talking Heads, “Outdoor Miner” by Wire, “Whip It” by Devo Alternative Rock R.E.M., Radiohead, Nirvana “Losing My Religion” by R.E.M., “Creep” by Radiohead, “Smells Like Teen Spirit” by Nirvana Britpunk The Clash, Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks “London Calling” by The Clash, “Anarchy in the UK” by Sex Pistols, “Ever Fallen in Love” by Buzzcocks College Rock The Smiths, R.E.M., Pixies “This Charming Man” by The Smiths, “Radio Free Europe” by R.E.M., “Where Is My Mind?” by Pixies Crossover Thrash Suicidal Tendencies, Stormtroopers of Death (S.O.D.), D.R.I. “Institutionalized” by Suicidal Tendencies, “Speak English or Die” by S.O.D., “Acid Rain” by D.R.I.

However, the technical meaning is usually any rock music that descended from punk rock. A lot of rock music has been classified as alternative rock music even though some of these did not exactly fit the meaning.\n\nAlternative rock music became popular in the 1990’s but the history or alternative rock music goes back farther than that. Before Nirvana brought alternative rock music to the mainstream audience, the music genre had been gaining popularity with the college crowds and music underground.\n\nIn the 1980’s REM was making their start in alternative rock music. Most of their airtime was given by college radio stations. This is where their loyal fan base started. However, their commercial success started at about the time that alternative started to really become popular in the 1990’s.\n\nThe popularity of alternative rock music came about after the grunge period. Grunge was a type of alternative rock music that denounced commercialism. This movement started in Seattle, Washington and soon took the world by storm. This was ironic since it was this type of music that helped to create the commercial success for alternative rock music. Bands such as Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nAlternative rock music also made a big splash in Britain where punk rock was more popular. In fact, Alternative rock music entered the mainstream earlier in Britain than it did in the United States. This gave alternative bands a broader venue even before the popularity of alternative music in the United States.\n\nDuring the height of success for alternative rock music, many record companies handed out the name to bands that fit the requirements loosely at best. This was done in hopes that the label of alternative would help sales. However, looking back one can see that some of this music was more pop than alternative.\n\nSteampunk (excerpt from Tor.com)\n\n“… can there actually be a musical genre called steampunk, and more importantly, does there need to be?\n\nThis debate isn’t exactly new; cyberpunk has seen this sort of thing before. Despite its established relationship with art and cinema, most people would struggle with naming any cyberpunk bands. The genre doesn’t officially exist. However, there are bands that fit the bill. Front Line Assembly is a flagship example. Yellow Magic Orchestra is regarded by some as the original cyberpunk band. Arguably, Gary Numan counts, too. But musically speaking, these bands don’t have much in common. This is the norm in the landscape of suggested cyberpunk offerings; from Front 242 to Information Society, Queensryche’s Operation: Mindcrime to Billy Idol’s Cyberpunk, there really is no sonic cohesion.\n\nHowever, it’s no lost effort. Cyberpunk has inspired musicians to write music that is decidedly against the grain while incorporating the cutting edge into their craft. The literature provides the substance, and new technologies provide the instruments. Ultimately, the selections hardly comprise a traditional genre, but they make for a satisfying playlist of musicians who understand cyberpunk’s legacy.”\n\nBest Alternative Albums Ever?\n\nSigh No More – Mumford & Sons\n\nWhen the World Comes Down (Deluxe Edition) – The All-American Rejects\n\nMylo Xyloto – Coldplay"
