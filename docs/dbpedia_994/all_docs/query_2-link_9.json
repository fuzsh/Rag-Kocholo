        "text": "Some music genres are defined by qualities in the music itself (like reggae has a certain beat). Other music genres are defined by things outside the music itself, like the cultural context or spirit behind the music. \"Alternative rock\" falls more in the latter category.\n\nWhile \"alternative rock\" (and \"indie rock\") had a certain meaning in the 1980s and 1990s because of the cultural context of those times, I don't think the term means the same thing for a newer act in today's cultural context. Today, \"alternative rock\" or \"indie rock\" more broadly segments one category of music from other broad categories of rock, like classic rock and metal.\n\nToday, a popular rock band is more likely alternative rock than classic rock (like Greta van Fleet). It's like \"alternative rock\" today is just \"rock.\" But the term \"alternative rock\" could mean The War on Drugs, Phoebe Bridgers, Frank Ocean, all of which are much more different from each other than when it was more like R.E.M., the Replacements and the Cure. Even bands like Twenty One Pilots have been called \"alternative rock\" (or are they hip-hop? or some blend?).\n\nMusic has split into many genres in the past 20 years, and there's a lot of crossing over between genres. It's sometimes hard to chart even the influences of these band back to alternative or indie roots to make a genealogical tree. The \"alternative rock\" or \"indie rock\" labels seem to have fallen out of favor, while there are new terms that cover different segments within it: post-rock revival, garage rock revival, emo, alternative hip-hop, alternative R&B, etc. There are also terms like post-Britpop, which seem to give up on trying to define what the music sounds like, and just say it's artists of a certain time and geography.\n\nThat's the general problem with an umbrella term like \"alternative\", wouldn't you agree? Even in 1992 you would have been hard pressed to find obvious similarities between.... say Pavement or Red Hot Chili Peppers. Or Babes In Toyland and Manic Street Preachers for that matter.\n\nThe smallest common determinator in my list above is young, gifted and equipped with six strings.\n\nWell it wouldn't sound like Taylor Swift with a Metallica styled backing track which is what I'm hearing a lot of in your thread and what's been posted here.\n\nDoes anyone know what it looks like to create a piece of art in the form of music that sounds like it's off the top of the musician's head. The sound of spontaneity can be intoxicating if it doesn't sound like what came before. Alternative rock most likely requires alternative mindset and intelligence on how to express one's self with music. The videos don't help much.\n\nAgree with this. ‘Alternative’ has never been a term that I’ve used or frankly understood. It is just a ‘and everyone else’ category - I don’t think it’s a term used much in the UK.\n\nI'd suggest some current bands like Inhaler, Mo Lowda & The Humble, The Hacky Turtles, October Drift, Social Animals, The Kooks, and The Dangerous Summer would fall under the alternative umbrella currently for me. Alternative is a tough one, I've never paid a lot of attention to genres and their exact definitions so I think for me I think Alternative typically is anything that has a little too much edge or progressiveness to be considered pop but is not quite aggressive as hard rock or metal. But I'm not big on genres, to me it either connects with me or doesn't."
