        "text": "Alternative rock is a type of rock music that became popular in the 1980s and 1990's. It became widely popular in the 1990s. Alternative rock is made up of various subgenres that have come out of the indie music scene since the 1980s, such as grunge, indie rock, Britpop, gothic rock, and indie pop.\n\nThese genres are sorted by their collective types of punk, which laid the groundwork for alternative music in the 1970s.\n\nExamples of alternative rock bands include R.E.M., U2, Radiohead and Oasis.\n\nImages for kids\n\nOne of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. relied on college-radio airplay, constant touring, and a grassroots fanbase to break into the musical mainstream.\n\nKim Gordon and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth\n\nEddie Vedder of Pearl Jam\n\nThe indie rock band Pavement in 1993\n\nPost-grunge band Creed in 2002\n\nReel Big Fish performing in 2008\n\nEmo band Jimmy Eat World performing in 2007\n\nMuse performing in Melbourne, January 2010\n\nWeezer plays Musikfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, August 2019\n\nTwenty One Pilots performing at Brixton Academy in London, February 2016\n\nSee also"
