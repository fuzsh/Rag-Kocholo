        "text": "1. INDIE POP\n\n2. GENRE The term genre can be considered as an extremely brief term which in hindsight means the style or category of art, literature or music. However this term can also relate to other aspects of style such as sub genre which is a more specific categorisation of genre. There are many types of genre regarding music for example indie, R&B and rock.\n\n3. THE HISTORY OF INDIE POP The genre we are focusing on and exploring the most is alternative pop as it’s the genre of Ivy and Gold’s song ‘The Town’. Alternative pop can also be referred to as indie rock or indie pop as they come under the same category in the music industry. This genre originated from British post-punk in the late 1970’s and generated a thriving club and gig atmosphere. However, indie pop differs from this genre slightly as it is more melodic and less abrasive. Indie pop was originally inspired by punk rocks DIY ethos and the rebellious screaming of early punk. As indie pop is a mixture of two genres it not incorporates the stripped down quality of rock but the catchiness of mainstream pop also. “Indie pop is not just ‘indie’ that is ‘pop’…in short, they have their own culture” – Nitsuh Abebe\n\n4. RECURRING LYRICS AND THEMES Within indie/ alternative pop music the lyrics tend to heavily refer to the breakup of relationships or have an underlying theme of sadness which is connoted within Oasis’ ‘Wonderwall’. However, this isn’t always the case, the lyrics within the song could relate to love but not always in a negative way. For example in The Kooks ‘She Moves in Her Own Way’ which explains how the speaker is moving onto ‘better things’. The theme of love and heart break isn’t just a conventional aspect of indie pop however, as this lyrical subject is evident in other genres such as R&B. Alternative or indie bands often use derogatory terms within their music to help articulate their feelings towards a certain topic. An example of this is in Arctic Monkeys ‘Florescent Adolescent’ through the line ‘oh the boy’s a slag’. Furthermore, unrequited love can be seen as a massive theme within alternative pop music. This is connoted through the lyrics of many songs specifically explaining the love the speaker has for a woman/ man in which these feelings aren’t reciprocated. Examples of this include Scouting For Girls ‘She’s so Lovely’ and Jet’s ‘Are You Gonna Be My Girl’. Contrasting these conventions completely however is MGMT’s ‘Kids’. This song has no reference of love within a relationship as the song focuses purely on parents and children, in hind sight giving advice to over-bearing parents. Therefore, this portrays the idea that the general theme of indie pop music is love however there are no restrictions, the song can be based around any subject.\n\n5. MUSICAL STYLE AND CHARACTERISTICS Within alternative pop music there is usually a clear beat and chorus enabling a sense of catchiness regarding the track. This is incorporated in order to adhere to the stereotypical ‘pop’ conventions. This style of music often has heavy guitar or drum beats throughout in order to portray the alterative/ indie side. Indie tracks can also be classed as having a reasonably fast beat in order to make them more exciting and experimental. An example of this would be in The Wombats song ‘Lets Dance To Joy Division’ as there is an evident beat created through the use of drums making it indefinitely catchy throughout. The vocals within alternative/ indie songs can be classed as somewhat similar to those of the pop genre but arguably can be perceived as rather different. Within this genre the singing can be interpreted as more laid back in comparison to a song such as Adeles ‘Hello’. This is because the music overall has been interpreted as having a more ‘chill vibe’ therefore techniques such as talking or shouting can also be incorporated into indie tracks. This is evident in songs such as Razorlight’s ‘Golden Touch’ and Kings of Leon’s ‘Sex on Fire’. Furthermore, some tracks do in fact revolve heavily around amazingly strong vocals and less focus on the instruments included much like the pop genre for example, Florence + the Machines ‘You’ve Got The Love’.\n\n6. REPRESENTATION OF INDIE POP BANDS Alternative and indie pop bands are often represented as being somewhat retro and vintage regarding the clothes they wear and the general image they present to their audience. An example of this style would be the band ‘Sundara Karma’ as their general image is extremely alternative which is not only connoted by the style of their clothes but also their hair. The way in which their outfits can be perceived as outdated and somewhat unique indicates the indie/ alternative style of the band. All of the members within Sundara Karma evidently have long hair which can be interpreted as unusual for males. This displays a somewhat effeminate aspect of the band which in hindsight creates a divide between indie pop and regular pop.\n\n7. REPRESENTATION OF INDIE POP BANDS Another example of an alternative band would be Arctic Monkeys. They have a similar image to Sundara Karma for example they could be perceived as somewhat retro and unique. This is a recurring theme amongst bands of this genre as alternative and indie in hindsight refers to the idea of being unique and different in comparison to other musical genres such as pop. Again, the clothes they wear could be classed as somewhat outdated and vintage giving them a distinctive look. Therefore, this portrays the idea that indie/ alternative bands are represented as being original and distinctive regarding their overall band image.\n\n8. IDEOLOGIES OF THIS GENRE The ideology of alternative and indie bands usually revolves around the philosophy of being unique and distinctive. Not only does this genre of band attempt to make their image different to that of the pop genre, the sound they create can be perceived as very different also. Within their music it is very unlikely that they’ll briefly touch on a topic such as heart break similar to what pop bands they do. In contrast, they will create deep and meaningful lyrics including some raw imagery so that their music has a really distinctive meaning. Alternative bands also focus their lyrics on more taboo subjects such as drugs and drinking. An example of this would be ‘Chocolate’ by The 1975. The importance of being different is critical to alternative bands but not only do they want to be different they want to make a difference. This is evident within many lyrics and their band image as a whole, as they advise youths to be unique and embrace their differences. It’s known that these bands believe in breaking the boundaries and escaping mainstream stereotypes of today’s generation.\n\n9. TARGET AUDIENCE It can be considered hard to pin point the exact target audience of a musical genre as their audience can be so diverse, consisting of different age ranges. However, regarding indie/ alternative pop the general audience consists of 16 – 24 year olds. The reasoning behind this is because the imagery regarding alternative pop bands could be perceived as rather explicit therefore under 16’s are less likely to listen. Younger audiences are also known to be more interested in pop or current bands which indie pop artists usually aren’t. This genre of music could also be considered as popular amongst late teens and early twenties as its unique and different and at these ages young adults are perceived as being somewhat experimental within their taste, whether that’s music or fashion. A website known as ‘NME.com’ which is also a magazine created to promote indie pop bands showed that 66% of people that listened to indie pop music were male, and the remaining 34% were female listeners. This indicates that the target audience of this genre of music is 16-24 year olds which are predominantly male. Due to the age range displayed, the occupation of the indie pop target audience is most likely going to be students in secondary school or higher education such as university. It could also be said that those studying media, performing arts or music would be more interested in this musical genre as they are perceived as more extraverted. Furthermore, these students are more likely going to be discovering and exploring new media.\n\n10.
