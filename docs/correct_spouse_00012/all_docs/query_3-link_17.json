        "text": "Jessica Paré was napping at home in Los Angeles when she got the call to say she’d be marrying this century’s sexiest man. That was in 2010, towards the end of filming on season four of Mad Men, during which Paré had joined the cast as Megan Calvet, one of a string of secretaries to fall into bed with the partners of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, the show’s fictional Madison Avenue ad firm. But Megan was different, as the show’s creator Matthew Weiner informed Paré during that phone call: she would succeed where so many other women had failed, by making an honest man of Don Draper.\n\n‘It was a Friday, and the script for the next episode was due on Monday,’ Paré says. ‘My phone rang, and I was terrified because I was sure that my character was going to fall down the elevator shaft. But instead he told me Don was going to propose to Megan. I didn’t even believe it. But Monday came round and the scene was still there.’\n\nWhen Paré had first auditioned, it was for the part of a prostitute. But Weiner saw something else in her. He told the Québécoise that she looked like a French actress; in fact, she looks like several French actresses: Juliette Binoche cheekbones, Brigitte Bardot teeth. Sipping a soy hot chocolate at a French bistro in Los Feliz village, close to downtown LA, the 30-year-old is giggly, game and disarmingly frank about the difficulties of the industry.\n\nThat’s just one of a handful of life experiences she was able to bring to the part of Megan, who, like her, is a French-Canadian thesp. Megan struggled to establish herself as part of an existing family, the Drapers, just as Paré was having to hold her own alongside Jon Hamm and the rest of Mad Men’s already Emmy-laden cast. ‘I was going into a show where everyone had been nominated for every award under the sun,’ she says. In her first episode, the stakes were low — she had just one line: ‘Yes, Joan.’ But then came that proposal. ‘There’s a part of Megan that I identified quite strongly with,’ Paré says, ‘that’s very open and free and guileless and full of joy.’\n\nParé first moved to LA from Montreal nine years ago, to work on Jack & Bobby, a political TV drama that lasted for just one series. It included an inordinate number of future stars, including Bradley Cooper, Mad Men’s John Slattery, and Paré, playing Slattery’s daughter. After it ended, she stayed behind in California with her cat, who was then called Tiger, ‘but it never really suited him’. Now he’s called Black Mist.\n\n‘You have to be pretty deluded to be an actor,’ says Paré. ‘I’ve been doing it for 15 years, and it’s really hard.’ Before Mad Men, she often thought about not being one. ‘Acting was like a bad boyfriend: I’d given the best years of my life to this relationship. He called me once a week to put me down, then once a year he’d send me flowers and I’d be on my knees again. There are a lot of big cities in the world where, if you’re not feeling your best, you can have your self-esteem eroded in a moment — and LA is one of them. Right now I’m really happy. But I’m also terrified to go back.’\n\nParé’s parents were both actors before she and her three brothers were born. Her mother became a conference translator. Her father, a professor at Montreal’s McGill University, still performs now and then. Jessica got her first whiff of the grease-paint when she was 12 years old, helping him to learn his lines for a production of The Tempest. He enrolled her in acting classes, and that was that.\n\nIn 2000, still a teenager, she was plucked from obscurity by the Canadian director Denys Arcand to be the star of his film Stardom, about a teenager who is, yes, plucked from obscurity to become a star. Stardom opened the Toronto Film Festival, and was shown at Cannes. Paré was an overnight celebrity in Canada, and soon ventured south to try her luck in a series of American indies, as well as her first Hollywood film, 2004’s Wicker Park, playing Josh Hartnett’s fiancée. That same year, she also appeared in Canadian comedy See This Movie, whose co-writer and producer Joseph M Smith she reportedly wed in 2007, only to divorce in 2010.\n\nHer acting success with Mad Men has also had an unexpected side-effect: musical fame. In the first episode of season five, Megan mortified her new husband by dropping a sex-bomb rendition of the 1960s French yé-yé hit ‘Zou Bisou Bisou’ at his surprise birthday party. Paré recorded her own version of the song, which became an iTunes hit, reaching number one on the Billboard World Music chart.\n\nParé, whose previous musical accomplishments extended only as far as playing the ukulele ‘poorly’, then joined The Jesus and Mary Chain for a few dates on their 2012 North American tour, singing vocals on two of her favourite hits, ‘Just Like Honey’ and ‘Sometimes Always’, to crowds in Buffalo and Montreal. ‘Every time I had to go on stage I was like, “I can’t!” But then I thought, “These people came to see their favourite band; they got a babysitter and they made dinner reservations and they called the cab and bought tickets, so don’t f*** it up for them!” ’\n\nMegan Calvet has also made Paré a fashion icon. She has grown ‘very partial’ to Givenchy, and to Jason Wu, who made her a knockout gown to wear to last year’s Emmys. ‘I used to be more comfortable in jeans, T-shirt and sneakers,’ she insists. ‘But the other day I got out of bed at 7.30am on a Saturday to go to a photo shoot, and I slipped on a pair of stilettos, because apparently that’s who I am now! Big heels are not uncomfortable to me any more. And the height makes me feel powerful — until I have to run anywhere, that is.’"
