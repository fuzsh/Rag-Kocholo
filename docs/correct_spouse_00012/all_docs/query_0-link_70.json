        "text": "Nancy Moran\n\nPh.D., Warren J. and Viola Mae Raymer Chair in Integrative Biology, The University of Texas at Austin\n\nThe College of Natural Sciences’ 2024 commencement speaker is Dr. Nancy Moran, an award-winning biologist whose research examines the ecological and evolutionary relationships between interacting living things in a process known as symbiosis. She earned her B.A. from The University of Texas at Austin and her Ph.D. from the University of Michigan.\n\nMoran researches dynamics that affect our agricultural systems, neighborhoods and the living world, beginning with the miniscule, symbiotic bacteria that live within insects like honey bees, bumble bees, leafhoppers and aphids. Her research has uncovered strategies to help address such pressing issues as colony collapse in bees, harmful interactions between pollinators and pesticides and opportunities to develop new biomaterials of potential interest to the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nMoran is a member of the National Academy of Science (NAS), a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a MacArthur fellow and a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology. Her awards include the International Prize in Biology, the NAS’s Waksman Award in Microbiology and the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution’s inaugural Lifetime Contribution Award. She is the author of hundreds of research papers, has been the subject of celebratory feature profiles in publications including Science and Quanta Magazine. Her work also has been widely featured in the popular press in such publications as The New York Times, The Atlantic, New Scientist and Scientific American.\n\nAlexa Morton\n\n(12:00 PM)\n\nAlexa Morton is a native Austinite, graduating with an honors B.S. in biochemistry, with certificates in forensic science and pre-health professions. She served as a student leader of the 2023 UT Austin iGEM synthetic biology team, where she helped develop a project that involved engineering bacteria to secrete antimicrobial peptides to protect plants from disease. The team received a gold medal and were nominated for excellence in several categories at the iGEM Grand Jamboree in Paris. This work went on to inspire her honors thesis, “Developing a Modular Microcin Secretion System to Protect Plants from Bacterial Pathogens.” Morton has a passion for fostering community and passing on knowledge to new cohorts of students, and during her time at UT, she has served as a course assistant in molecular biology, a CNS orientation advisor, an FRI peer mentor and multiple other mentorship positions on the Forty Acres. Beyond academics, Morton has been involved in Labyrinth, a progressive Christian community on campus, and she shared her outlook as a young queer Christian in an Austin American-Statesman article in 2023. She plans to attend graduate school after conducting postbaccalaureate research.\n\nArvind Subramanian\n\n(4:00 PM)\n\nArvind Subramanian is graduating with a B.S. in public health and with a minor in business, a certificate in forensic science and College of Natural Sciences distinctions in service and leadership and in community and student engagement. During his time at UT, Subramanian has served as president of the Natural Sciences Council, the governing student organization for CNS. In his role, Subramanian served as the liaison between students and college administration to improve the CNS student experience. He has worked with the Office of Emergency Management to create a map of AEDs on campus and advocated for research equity to establish the Research Mentorship and Apprenticeship Program in collaboration with the Office of Undergraduate Research. In addition to advocacy, Subramanian has also worked as an EMT in the Austin area for the last four years and served as the chief of Longhorn EMS, working towards the presence of an on-campus emergency response team. Passionate about the intersection of policy and patient care, he is committed to continuing public health clinical research to explore policy decisions that shape healthcare accessibility and preventative care. After graduation, Subramanian will attend UT Southwestern Medical School, where he hopes to leverage his experiences to positively impact the lives of those in the community.\n\n12:00 PM\n\nEmma Catherine Babaian, B.S.
