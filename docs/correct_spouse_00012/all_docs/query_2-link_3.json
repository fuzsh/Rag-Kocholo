        "text": "Jessica Paré is expecting her first child.\n\nThe 'Mad Men' actress and her musician boyfriend John Kastner, who has a seven-year-old daughter, Summer Lee, from a previous marriage, will welcome a baby into the world next year.\n\nA spokesperson for the 33-year-old Canadian star confirmed the news to UsMagazine.com.\n\nThe couple, who started dating in 2012, are notoriously tight-lipped about their relationship, but have attended several red carpet events together in the past.\n\nThe brunette beauty was previously married to actor Joseph M. Smith for three years until 2010.\n\nJessica previously admitted landing the part of Megan Draper on the AMC series, which came to an end earlier this year, completely changed her life.\n\nShe said: ''Everything changed. Like, I was able to pay rent. And I had this old car. The engine had rusted though and the wheels were going to fall off. It was really bad...''\n\nShe added: ''It's been such a big part of my life. Before I got the role I was having a hard time getting work and just in life, so it's been such a ride.\n\n''It's a dream job for an actor. It's so well written and they are an amazing group of people to work with. We're very tight. We genuinely enjoy each other's company.''"
