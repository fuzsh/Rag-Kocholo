Mad Men star Jessica Par√© is expecting her first child with her boyfriend John Kastner.

Congratulations, guys!

The pair usually keep their relationship on the down low, occasionally attending red carpet events together, but her rep confirmed the exciting news for the couple this week.

However, eagle-eyed Instagrammers would have seen that John hinted at the news a month ago, with this not-so-cryptic photo:

This will be Jessica's first child, and the second for John, who is already father to daughter Summer Lee (the wearer of the T-shirt in the Instagram photo, of course).

The pair began dating in 2012 and were both previously married, Jessica to writer and producer Joseph M. Smith and John to actress Nicole DeBoer.

We're sure the pair are thrilled!
