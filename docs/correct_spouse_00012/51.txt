TORONTO — Canadian actress Jessica Paré is going to be a mom.

A rep for the Montreal-born Mad Men star confirmed Tuesday she is expecting with boyfriend John Kastner.

It will be the first baby for Paré, 33, and the second for Kastner, who has a 7-year-old daughter with his ex-wife, Toronto actress Nicole DeBoer (The Dead Zone).
