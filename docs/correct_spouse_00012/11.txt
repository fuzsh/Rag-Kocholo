Mad Men's Jessica Paré has welcomed a son with her rocker boyfriend John Kastner.

The 34-year-old first-time mother named her baby Blues Anthony Paré Kastner.

John, a Canadian singer and band manager, revealed the news on Friday by posting a picture of his seven-year-old daughter Summer Lee holding her newborn brother.

Proud Summer cradles the child who is sleeping blissfully. John shares the little girl with his estranged wife, actress Nicole de Boer. The couple split in 2012 after 12 years of marriage.

Jessica, who played Don Draper's wife Megan on the hit TV show, confirmed her pregnancy in October.

In preparation for the new arrival, the actress recently held a baby shower where 50-or-so guests enjoyed champagne and cupcakes with blue icing.

An insider said at the time: 'The shower was beautiful! It was a very personal day and very intimate.

'John and all of his rock and roll buds were at the party all day. It was really sweet - very personal.'

The guests didn't leave empty handed, as each was given a thoughtful party favour decorated with crystals.

The insider added: 'The party favours were little bags decorated with a crystal sash that included one piece of rose quartz, amethyst and citrine crystals.

'The rose quartz signifies love, the amethyst is for peace and protection, and the citrine is creativity and manifestation.'

The actress had previously talked of her love of children, saying she enjoyed working with child stars Kiernan Shipka and Jared Gilmore on Mad Men.

'I have an enormous family because I’m from Montréal and my family’s Catholic, so my dad has eight siblings and they all have kids and we all grew up in the same property on weekends and summers,' Jessica told AMCTV.com in 2010.

Jessica was previously married for three years to writer-producer Joseph M. Smith but the two divorced in 2010.
