“Mad Men” star Jessica Paré has a baby on the way.

The 33-year-old actress and boyfriend John Kastner are expecting their first child together, her rep told Page Six.

Paré and her beau, a Canadian musician, have kept their relationship low-profile, so much that their baby announcement last month went mostly unnoticed on Instagram.

In the post, Kastner shared a photo of his 7-year-old daughter, Summer Lee, wearing a T-shirt with the words “I’m going to be a big sister,” while he and Paré are seen hugging in the background.

Paré was married to writer-producer Joseph M. Smith from 2007-2010. Kastner split from Summer’s mom, Nicole DeBoer, in 2012.
