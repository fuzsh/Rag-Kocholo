“Mad Men” fans are gearing up for the show’s final season, but one of its stars, Jessica Paré, has already embraced a new role: mom.

The actress and partner John Kastner have welcomed their first child together, a baby boy named Blues Anthony.

Canadian rocker Kastner shared a sweet photo of the uniquely named baby Blues and 8-year-old half-sister Summer Lee, his daughter with ex-wife Nicole DeBoer, on Friday. “Please meet Blues Anthony Pare Kastner…,” he captioned the sibling pic.

Paré, 34, confirmed her pregnancy in October.

She was previously married to writer-producer Joseph M. Smith from 2007 to 2010.

A rep for Paré did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
