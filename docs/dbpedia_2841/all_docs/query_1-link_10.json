Many state-wide notables of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (U.D.C.) were in attendance along with members of the Daughters of the American Revolution and several African American citizens, whom the local newspaper account reported as a \"body servants of famous people of the Confederacy\". The United States Army was represented by Brigadier General Manus McClosky of Fort Bragg.\n\nAn “Old South” atmosphere was present throughout the proceedings with Confederate flags scattered about the grounds and young women and U.D.C. members dressed in costumes of the Old South. Mrs. Mary Bennett Little, 27-year president of the Wadesboro chapter of the U.D.C., served as mistress of the ceremony. Following the reading of the inscription by a Mr. Marshall of the Frank Bennett Chapter, Children of the Confederacy performed a musical number entitled “The Homespun Dress.” Brigadier General Manus McClosky delivered a short speech, and the salute of the Flag followed. The band played the Star Spangled Banner, and the original flag of the Anson county guards was held aloft during the ceremony. A granite vase was presented by Mr. Scoggins of Scoggins Memorial Art Shops.\n\nSubject Notes\n\nThis monument was built to recognize the efforts of Confederate women during the Civil War. The funding for the monument was left in the will of General W.A. Smith. The United Daughters of the Confederacy first organized in 1894 as the National Association of the Daughters of the Confederacy. They provided material and educational support for Civil War veterans, their families and descendants, collected historical materials, and commemorated the memory of soldiers by organizing annual ceremonies and erecting local monuments.\n\nLocation\n\nThe Confederate Women Monument is on the left from the entrance to the Anson County Courthouse in Wadesboro, NC. Multiple memorials are associated with this area. The Confederate Monument sits in front of the entrance to the building. Two bronze plaques are mounted to exterior walls of the Courthouse. One lists African American soldiers and its companion white men and women who served during the Great War. Also nearby is a Memorial Fountain dedicated to citizens of Anson County who died in World War One and to the heroes of the American Revolution."
