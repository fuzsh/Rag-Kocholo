        "text": "Historic Statue Removal – Top 3 Pros & Cons\n\nOverview\n\nPro/Con Arguments\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nTake Action\n\nWhile the debate whether Confederate statues should be taken down has been gaining momentum for years, the issue gained widespread attention after the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The shooter was said to have glorified the Confederate South, posing in Facebook photos with the Battle Flag of the Northern Virginia Army (also known now as the “Confederate flag,” though it never represented the Confederate States) and touring historical Confederate locations before the shooting.\n\nThe issue rose to prominence again in 2017 after an Aug. 12 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent and deadly. The rally protested the proposed removal of statues of Confederate Army Generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.\n\nThe Virginia statues still stood amid the protests following the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, though they were tagged with graffiti then (and later removed on July 10, 2021). During the global Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020, calls to take down the statues were met with citizens not only actively damaging or removing statues of Confederate figures, but targeting statues of slave-holding Founding Fathers in general, as well as historic monuments to Abraham Lincoln and abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass.\n\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), 59 Confederate statues and nine markers or plaques were removed from public land in 19 US states between June 17, 2015 and July 6, 2020. The SPLC reported at least 160 monuments were removed in 2020 after George Floyd’s death, more than the prior four years combined. At last count on Jan. 20, 2022, about 723 Confederate monuments remained on public land.\n\nWhile Confederate statues tend to be at the forefront of the debate, statues of Christopher Columbus and others have also been targeted for removal or defense. There were 149 monuments to Columbus, according to the Monument Lab, the third most of anyone in the United States with more than Robert E. Lee (59) and Stonewall Jackson (33) combined.\n\nIn June 2021, the US House of Representatives voted to remove all confederate statues and bust of Roger B. Taney (the US Supreme Court Chief Justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision) from the US Capitol’s Statuary Hall. Taney’s bust was replaced with one of Thurgood Marshall. On July 13, 2022, Florida erected a statue of Mary McLeod Bethune to replace their confederate soldier statue. Bethune’s is the first state-commissioned statue of a Black person to be included in Statuary Hall.\n\nShould Historic Statues Be Taken Down?\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nShould historic statues be taken down? Explain your answer with examples and reasoning.\n\nDo the statues represent or misrepresent the country’s history? How?\n\nRegardless of whether historic statues are removed or remain, what sort of statues, memorials, or other art would you like to see in public spaces? Explain your answers.\n\nTake Action\n\n1. Explore the Southern Poverty Law Center’s “Whose Heritage: Public Symbols of the Confederacy” resource, which promotes the removal of confederate statues.\n\n2. Consider the idea of placing the removed statues in museums with the American Alliance of Museums.\n\n3. Defend the existence of confederate statues as ways of honoring the past with the United Daughters of the Confederacy, an organization devoted to the memory of Confederate soldiers.\n\n4. Consider how you felt about the issue before reading this article. After reading the pros and cons on this topic, has your thinking changed? If so, how? List two to three ways. If your thoughts have not changed, list two to three ways your better understanding of the “other side of the issue” now helps you better argue your position.\n\n5. Push for the position and policies you support by writing US national senators and representatives.\n\nSources"
