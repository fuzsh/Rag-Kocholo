        "text": "Blount Street has always been a part of Raleigh—it runs straight through the original one-square-mile city plan that William Christmas drew in 1792. Today’s Blount Street extends from just south of Shaw University up to Peace Street and encompasses a great collection of nineteenth and twentieth century buildings. The southern reach has been part of an historically African-American neighborhood since at least Reconstruction. The north end, in contrast, was a white, semi-rural neighborhood even before the Civil War.\n\nOnly two antebellum buildings remain. The Greek Revival-style Lewis-Smith House was actually built on North Wilmington Street in 1854. In the 1970s, it and several other high-style, nineteenth-century houses were moved to North Blount Street to make way for the state government complex. Nearby, the Main Building of William Peace University stands on the north side of Peace Street at the terminus of North Blount Street. It is also antebellum and Greek Revival. Construction began in 1859 to house Peace College, a Methodist-run girls’ school. The Civil War interrupted the work and the building remained unfinished until the 1870s.\n\nAfter the Civil War came momentous changes to life and society in North Carolina. The influx of country residents into cities in post-war decades included the wealthy. In Raleigh, they built fashionable dwellings along North Blount and surrounding streets. Nationally popular architectural plan books presented endless variations of decorative flourish, including Eastlake-style work seen on the porches of the Hawkins-Hartness House and at the Executive Mansion.\n\nAside from decoration, the period saw a significant shift in overall architectural style. The mansard roof at the ca. 1870 Heck-Andrews House indicates its Second Empire style; look for other dwellings on surrounding streets built in this style. The 1874 Andrews-Duncan House has characteristic Italianate elements: eaves adorned with brackets, windows with elaborate molding, and overall verticality. Architect G.S.H. Appleget designed both houses.\n\nAppleget also designed Estey Hall at Shaw University. This Italianate-style building was the first erected for the higher education of African American women. Shaw founder Rev. Henry Martin Tupper, a Baptist missionary, came to Raleigh during Reconstruction to build schools for African Americans. The imposing, brick-veneered Tupper Memorial Church, built in 1903, was named for him in gratitude. Nearby stands the 1907 Masonic Temple Building, which housed Raleigh’s African American masonic lodge.\n\nAs the nineteenth century ended, new building types went up in the area, reflecting growth and industrial development. The Pilot-Crompton Mill, begun in 1893 to produce textiles, is adjacent to the corridor. The 1912 Montague Building at Moore Square is a large commercial building rendered in the Neoclassical Revival style. The Beaux Arts-style Capital Apartments was built in 1917.\n\nChange and variety have been constants along Blount Street throughout Raleigh’s history. The historic buildings you’ll see along and near the corridor offer testament to the city’s evolution."
