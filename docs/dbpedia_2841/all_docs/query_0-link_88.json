        "text": "The Capital City Trail, established in 1963, was a heritage trail highlighting 45 sites around central Raleigh. A printed guide mapped the properties, gave a thumbnail history of each, and suggested a driving route connecting them. “Capital City Trail” signage also marked each site, and the numbered signs matched numbered properties in the brochure. The Woman’s Club spearheaded the project, working with the Raleigh Historic Sites Commission (a predecessor to the RHDC), the Tourist and Convention Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the city’s Planning Department.\n\nThe State Capitol, fittingly, led off the tour. Historic sites like the 1769 Joel Lane House populated it, but the trail also noted cemeteries as well as cultural and educational institutions. The route directed sightseers past places like the N.C. Museum of Art (then located downtown) and the 1895 St. Augustine’s College Chapel. Several examples of high-style historic architecture made the cut, such as the 1879 Italianate/Second Empire-style Dodd-Hinsdale House on Hillsborough Street. The tour also noted a few examples of newer architectural gems, like the 1952 J. S. Dorton Arena at the State Fairgrounds.\n\nThe trail was an immediate and lasting hit. Nearly 20 years later, the Chamber of Commerce still got near-daily requests for the brochure. Unfortunately, it no longer worked so well. By the early 1980s, some buildings had been demolished, some roads had been re-routed. The trail needed an update.\n\nOnce again, the Woman’s Club stepped in. The second version expanded the tour to 131 sites and updated the signage. With more properties came a broader focus, highlighting more examples of high-style historic architecture. Many of the featured houses stood along N. Blount Street, like the Greek Revival-style ca. 1855 Lewis-Smith House, and in the nearby Oakwood Historic District, like the three ca. 1872 Second Empire-style Heck Houses. Other additions included buildings along Fayetteville Street, like the 1924 Neoclassical Revival-style Odd Fellows Building and other early skyscrapers. The new tour also added historic properties that reflected everyday life. It highlighted buildings related to shopping, like the Briggs Hardware Building and City Market; to transportation, such as the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Building; and to recreation, including the Chavis Park Carousel and the Pullen Park Carousel. A compact, 24-page booklet outlined the updated tour.\n\nA third version prepared by the Planning Department, completed roughly another twenty years later, updated the list again and streamlined the format, going back to a pamphlet while keeping the longer length. This version added recently designated local landmarks like the Plummer T. Hall House and N.B. Broughton High School. Still, it didn’t neglect cultural institutions like Memorial Hall or some of the city’s new museums.\n\nThis Raleigh Historic tour of the Capital City Trail includes all the local Raleigh Historic Landmarks ever included on any version of the tour that still stand. They range in age from the 1769 Joel Lane House to the International Style 1966 G. Milton Small & Associates Office Building. The properties cluster in central Raleigh, spreading out to southeast Raleigh as far as Chavis Park and across West Raleigh to the NC State Fair Commercial & Education Buildings. This listing never composed an official Capital City Tour. Nevertheless, it remains true to the original intent of the tour, which was to highlight and encourage preservation of the important sites that help tell the story of Raleigh’s history and lend texture to its future."
