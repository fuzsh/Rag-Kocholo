        "text": "Early Friday morning, May 27, 2022, unknown individuals vandalized items in the Civil War section at historic Oakland Cemetery, including the Obelisk. This is not the first time vandalism has taken place in the Civil War section of the cemetery. In an effort to address the many questions we receive, we have compiled this list of frequently asked questions and answers to fully explain the current status of the monument, the process for when vandalism occurs, and our approach to interpreting the historical and contemporary meanings of the Civil War.\n\nWho owns the Confederate Obelisk?\n\nThe Obelisk is owned and maintained by the city of Atlanta’s Department of Parks and Recreation. While Historic Oakland Foundation is a private non-profit whose mission is to preserve, restore, enhance, and share Oakland Cemetery in partnership with the City of Atlanta, the cemetery is a public City of Atlanta park and is ultimately under the care and jurisdiction of the City of Atlanta. The Confederate Burial Grounds and the Obelisk are excluded from those sections overseen by the Historic Oakland Foundation.\n\nWho is responsible for the cleaning of the monument?\n\nThe City of Atlanta oversees all upkeep of the Civil War section of the cemetery and carries out any remediation if monuments are vandalized. As a matter of public safety, the Department of Parks and Recreation, which is responsible for the Obelisk, removes vandalism containing profanity in city parks when it is brought to their attention.\n\nWhy can’t I help clean the monument?\n\nRemoving paint from granite, marble, and brick surfaces requires experienced conservation professionals along with tools, equipment, and specialized chemicals that will remove various types of paint on the surface while preserving the underlying historic materials. For this reason, it is important that unauthorized visitors do not try to assist in removing the paint or otherwise attempt to remediate the damage.\n\nWhat security measures are in place at the cemetery?\n\nAs part of the Memorandum of Understanding that governs and guides the relationship and division of responsibilities between Historic Oakland Foundation (HOF) and the City of Atlanta Department of Parks and Recreation, the security of Oakland Cemetery is within the purview of the Department of Parks and Recreation. Oakland Cemetery has a number of security cameras and motion-sensor-activated security floodlights, especially in low-trafficked areas of the cemetery. The cemetery is also patrolled overnight by a security guard contracted by the city. In the 2017 Historic Oakland Foundation Master Plan, HOF’s board of trustees committed to supporting our partners in the City of Atlanta with Oakland’s constantly evolving security infrastructure.\n\nWhat happened to the Lion of Atlanta?\n\nAt its August 16, 2021 meeting, the Atlanta City Council unanimously voted to approve the removal of the Lion of Atlanta statue from Oakland Cemetery as “necessary and appropriate for the preservation, protection, and interpretation of the monument.” The Lion was removed on Wednesday, August 18, 2021, under the direction of the Mayor’s Office of Cultural Affairs. Since Fall 2019, despite increased security at Oakland Cemetery, the Lion of Atlanta monument had been repeatedly vandalized. The City Council’s decision was in response to this continued vandalism.\n\nWhy are Confederate monuments so controversial today?\n\nWhile early Confederate monuments may have been installed sincerely as a way to mourn lost loved ones, the vast majority of Confederate monuments were installed during the period in which Jim Crow laws were enacted by white politicians to discriminate against African Americans, from the end of Reconstruction to the mid-20th century. These laws codified racial segregation and were informed by the continued presence of white supremacist thought in the United States following the end of the Civil War (1861-1865). For many, these monuments represent Lost Cause ideology, which ignores slavery as the main cause of the Civil War and commemorates a racial hierarchy where African Americans were subservient to whites. The Lost Cause remained a powerful influence in the South for generations and is still embedded in some public discourse about the Civil War.\n\nIn Georgia, the contemporary fate of confederate monuments has been an ongoing contentious political issue. Georgia state law currently prohibits the removal of Confederate monuments, though individual municipalities have circumvented this law by accepting the fines imposed on them by the state as part of the removal cost.\n\nHow has the City of Atlanta approached the controversy surrounding Confederate monuments?\n\nFollowing the appalling events of Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, the Atlanta City Council created a committee to assess city-owned Confederate monuments and street names. The Advisory Committee on City of Atlanta Street Names and Monuments Associated with the Confederacy recommended removing two Confederate monuments in Atlanta and renaming streets associated with the Confederacy and its leaders. Several streets were thus renamed. However, as Georgia state law prohibits removing or obscuring existing monuments, elected officials determined that the installation of interpretive panels at monuments, including the two at Oakland, provided an acceptable alternative.\n\nHow does Historic Oakland Foundation interpret the Confederate monuments at Oakland?\n\nHistoric Oakland Foundation, the Atlanta History Center, and the City of Atlanta collaborated to add interpretive panels at the city’s Confederate monuments. These contextual panels provide information about the monuments, the motivations behind their construction, and their social impact in the past and present. The historical panels also address the Lost Cause interpretation of the Civil War and acknowledge the struggles of African Americans experiencing and fighting against slavery and segregation. Three new interpretive panels were installed in Oakland’s Civil War Section in August 2019.\n\nWhy do the contextual panels say this?\n\nThe Confederate Obelisk was unveiled in 1874. As it does not delineate the location of any grave, it is a monument and not a grave marker. From its installation, the Obelisk was a gathering place for Confederate Memorial Day celebrations in Atlanta. These celebrations and the individuals who fought to vindicate the Confederacy helped to perpetuate Lost Cause ideology in the South and beyond.\n\nDo the meanings of monuments change or stay the same?\n\nThe meanings of all historical monuments, including Confederate monuments, reflect current times and are not static or frozen in the moment of their erection. Historic Oakland Foundation is dedicated to interpreting every era of Oakland Cemetery. Our public interpretation of the Confederate Obelisk presents the full history, and, out of a necessity to provide ethical, equitable, and accurate public interpretation, includes a discussion of how meanings and societal values can change between the time in which a monument is installed and the present day.\n\nDialogue and debate are important for civil discourse as the city continues to wrestle with its history and its history’s meaning. This is a vital, ongoing process for a vibrant civil society; it helps form a deeper, richer understanding of who we are and the values we decide to uplift or de-emphasize. Historic Oakland Foundation wants the families of those buried at Oakland and visitors to Oakland to feel welcome and safe. We are committed to providing a space for our city to hold difficult conversations as we work collectively to form a more beloved community."
