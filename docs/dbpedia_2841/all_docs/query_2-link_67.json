        "text": "The Algeria Shrine Temple seen from Hill Park, ca. 1930. In the foreground is the Confederate Fountain, donated to the City of Helena in 1916 by the Daughters of The Confederacy to commemorate Confederate Army victims of the Civil War. Until 1926, it was the northernmost Confederate memorial in the U. S., (a memorial in Seattle's Lake View Cemetery now has that distinction). The fountain underwent several repairs and restorations in the years before it was removed.\n\nIn August of 2017, following a Charlottesville, Virginia demonstration over the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, in which one person was killed and 19 others injured, eight members of the American Indian Caucus of the Montana Legislature called on the City of Helena to remove the fountain because it honored the memory of dead Confederate soldiers, and was therefore somehow racist. None of the eight members of the American Indian Caucus lived in or represented Helena.\n\nOn August 16, the City of Helena held a public hearing on the proposed removal of the fountain. Emotions were high, and the topic became quite heated on social media. State and local historians publicly opposed the fountain's removal.\n\nOn August 18 2017, workers removed the fountain to a City utility building. Several protesters were present at the removal. Two people were arrested by police at the scene, one of whom was a serious protester, the other apparently just drunk. The disassembled fountain now sits under tarps, in a field, at an undisclosed location.\n\nHandsome Fountain Given To Helena With Fitting Ceremony\n\nConfederate Daughters Present Memorial Structure.\n\nLarge Crowd Hears Talks.\n\n$2,000 Memorial Placed at Highest Point in Hill Park to Beautify Rest Spot\n\nMiss Young MakesSpeech of Presentation.\n\nWith fitting ceremony, the beautiful fountain recently placed in Hill park was presented to the city of Helena last evening by the Daughters of the Confederacy in Montana. City Attorney Edward Horsky, acting for Mayor R. R. Purcell, who was unavoidably absent, accepted the gift after an address of presentation by Miss Georgia C. Young. The emblem is a splendid contribution to the beautification of the park given to the city some years ago by the later James J. Hill.\n\nA gathering of a couple of hundred Helenaites joined about the new structure to listen to the evenings program. Several Confederate veterans were present in places of honor. A short program, with a few necessary formalities, was applauded by the patriotic crowd. When the impressive monument was unveiled a long demonstration followed, giving the fountain a most hearty welcome as one more means of beautifying the city park.\n\nThe Evenings Program. Judge R. Lee Word presided over the program. Prior to the unveiling ceremony the Helena drum corps gave several selection. Mrs. Will Aiken pulled the cord which released the flag covering the new fountain. The water was turned into the huge bowl by Mrs. F. F. Read. These women with Miss Young, who followed with the presentation speech, are the only charter members now in the city.\n\nMiss Young, in formally presenting the splendid memorial to the city, told of the history of the gift; how the Confederate Daughters seeing the need of more means of beautifying Hill park, set about on a campaign to secure funds for the work. She explained the motives of the order in planning such a gift, telling how the Confederate Daughters, desirous of making some presentation to their new residence after leaving the south, had decided upon the fountain as a fitting memorial.\n\nFormally Presented. The speaker lauded the present-day American spirit, a spirit of union with no feeling between the old north and south, which caused such bitterness and sorrow years ago. Both sides are now engaged in building up a better c ountry to live in, making their homes more comfortable, their cities more beautiful. She closed:\n\nOn behalf of the daughters of the Confederacy, I present this fountain to the city of Helena as a token of our esteem toward our new home.\n\nThe city of Helena is pleased and honored to accept this substantial and beautiful donation from the Daughters of the Confederacy. On behalf of the city I accept most heartily this splendid token Thus spoke Attorney Edward Horsky, in place of Mayor Purcell.\n\nThe city attorney, in accepting the gift, delved into the history of the city and the park, on which the monument was built. He lauded the spirit of the Confederate Daughters in making such a fitting gift. The efforts of the Daughters of the Confederacy in planning such a gift are worthy of the highest praise, said Mr. Horsky. We have several pretty parks, though they lack such fitting and substantial markings as this, it is a beautiful memorial that will long keep bright the memory of the organization that donated it.\n\nOf Native Granite. The fountain is carved from native Montana granite. It towers eight feet high and in the top a large electric globe is placed. Four streams of water pour forth into a large bowl which overflows into a basin six feet square. The structure is ornamented with pretty carvings. It was designed by Architect George H. Carsley and erected at a cost of $2,000. It was placed on the highest point in Hill park.\n\nFrom Confederate Veteran Magazine\n\nJanuary 1, 1917\n\nvia Ken Robison\n\nCONFEDERATE MEMORIAL IN HELENA, MONT.\n\nThe 5th of September, 1916, was made memorable in the\n\ncity of Helena, Mont., by the presentation of the Confed-\n\nerate memorial fountain as a gift from the Winnie Davis\n\nChapter, U. D. C. It was in 1903 that this Chapter began\n\nits work for a Confederate memorial, and in this it was aided by other Chapters of the State. So on the evening of September 5, in the glow of the long Montana twilight, an interested throng gathered to witness the unveiling ceremonies.\n\nJudge R. Lee Word, of the district court, acted as master\n\nof ceremonies. The speech of presentation was made by\n\nMiss Georgia C. Young, the veil was drawn by Mrs. Will\n\nAiken, and the water was turned into the fountain by Mrs.\n\nF. S. Read, these ladies being the only charter members of\n\nWinnie Davis Chapter now residing in Helena. On behalf of\n\nthe city the fountain was accepted by City Attorney Edward Horsky, who expressed the appreciation of the municipality for this splendid gift.\n\nThis beautiful memorial, which cost approximately two thousand dollars, stands in Great Northern Park, near the heart of the capital city, on the western rim of historic old Last Chance Gulch and near the Great Northern passenger station. The site is such that it is accessible, and the fountain fits into the landscape most charmingly.\n\nThe base upon which the fountain is placed is rectangular\n\nin form, bordered by heavy granite copings and approaches being on opposite sides, corresponding to the east-and-west axis of the park. These will be bordered by flower beds, and trees and shrubs will be placed about the fountain.\n\nOn the other sides are granite seats with supports having\n\nclassic lines. There are two basins. Bubbling drinking foun-\n\ntains at its north and south sides are so designed as to en-\n\nhance the beauty of the lines of the fountain. The upper basin is about six feet in diameter, supported on an octagonal pedestal springing from the lower basin. This pedestal is orna mented by conventional water plant leaves.\n\nRising out of the upper basin is an octagonal shaft, upon\n\nopposite sides of which are two inscriptions in cut letters,\n\nalso with panels and ornament of carved leafage. Upon one side is this inscription : \"A Loving Tribute to Our Confederate Soldiers.\" Upon the other are chiseled these words :\n\n\"By the Daughters of the Confederacy in Montana, A.D.\n\n1916.\"\n\nFour bronze spouts spill water from this pedestal into the\n\nupper basin. In addition, there are four low jets bubbling\n\nthrough the surface of water in the upper basin, which, to-\n\ngether with two overflow spouts from the drinking fountain and the water spilling from the upper into the lower basin, form pleasing lines and graceful patterns.\n\nTHE MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN.\n\nThe whole is surmounted by a bronze lantern, giving to the shaft something of the proportions of a lighthouse, the distance from platform to top of light being about nine feet. The designer, Mr. George H. Carsley, the well-known architect of Helena, was inspired somewhat by the memorial fountain erected in Washington City to the memory of Francis Davis Millett and Col. Archibald Willingham Butt, two heroes who lost their lives in the sinking of the Titanic.\n\nExcept for the bronze spouts and the floor of the platform,\n\nthe material used in the fountain is native Montana granite."
