        "text": "Introduction\n\nKehinde Wiley is a New York-based artist renowned for depicting African American people through Baroque themes of power, status and nobility. In 2016, when his major survey exhibition toured to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, he encountered Confederate monuments for the first time.\n\nThe artist was struck by the numerous statues dedicated to Confederate Civil War leaders that lined the nearby Monument Avenue, as well as in other prominent sites around the city of Richmond.\n\nThese statues have attracted growing concern from many local residents, as they memorialise figures who fought to defend slavery during the American Civil War (1861-1865). Almost half (47%) of Richmond’s residents identify as Black or African American; yet almost all its statues are of white figures.\n\nThe notable exceptions are a sculpture of tennis champion Arthur Ashe, unveiled in 1996 and the presentation of the African American banker, entrepreneur and civil rights activist, Maggie Lena Walker in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, Wiley began independently designing the Rumors of War statue as a direct response to these monuments, to prompt discussion on the controversial legacy of the Confederacy in America and the comparative lack of Black representation in Richmond’s statues.\n\nThe bronze sculpture, of an African American youth on horseback, does not portray a specific individual. It is instead intended as a commentary on violence against Black bodies, and in particular \"Black men and their place in society”, addressing their lack of representation in visual and historical narratives.\n\nThe context for reinterpretation\n\nAfter an 1808 Act of Congress abolished the international slave trade, Richmond became the largest centre in the Upper South for trade of enslaved people.\n\nThe city was then later established as the capital of the Confederate States of America throughout much of the Civil War, at which time approximately 550,000 people in Virginia – one third of its population – were enslaved people.\n\nMany of the statues were designed and installed several decades after the Civil War in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as part of a re-assertion of white supremacist values.\n\nAt the time, the planned community, Monument Avenue Park, became a segregated whites only space under Jim Crow laws, where real-estate marketers established covenants stating that: “no lots can ever be sold or rented to any person of African American descent\".\n\nSince 2010, there have been a rising number of protests in Richmond and across the USA contesting the ongoing memorialisation of Confederate leaders. This has led to disputes between residents who would like these statues to be contextualised or removed, and conservative nationalist groups who believe Confederate servicepeople should be commemorated.\n\nIn 2017, a large demonstration was held at the Richmond statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, calling for it to be removed. [See footnote 1].\n\nThis was also met by a smaller group of counter-protesters chanting ‘Heritage Not Hate’. The protests remained peaceful; yet concerns around violence were high.\n\nIn nearby Charlottesville, Virginia, separate protests at another statue of Robert E. Lee had made international headlines after a white nationalist drove into a group of demonstrators, killing a woman.\n\nWhat was done and who was involved?\n\nThe VMFA had developed a relationship with Kehinde Wiley through their early support of the artist after presenting his first major touring exhibition, ‘A New Republic’, organised by the Brooklyn Museum. In 2016, when the VMFA presented this exhibition, Wiley spent a week in Richmond studying Confederate statues around the city. Outlining his central vision for 'Rumors of War' to the Museum curatorial team, he noted that: “monuments of this ilk deserved a monumental response.”\n\nThe subsequent design of 'Rumors of War' took direct inspiration from the nearby statue of Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart on horseback, created by Frederick Moynahan in 1907. Repositioning a young African American man on the horse was intended to both contest the heroic memorialisation of leaders with connections to American slavery and also to symbolise the progress of American society towards a culture that values diversity and inclusivity, creating a monument in which diverse residents in Richmond could feel pride and ownership.\n\nIn September 2019 the statue was temporarily installed in one of the best-known public places in the USA, Times Square, New York, the artist’s hometown. A formal unveiling ceremony then took place in December 2019 outside the VMFA in Richmond, drawing a large and diverse crowd.\n\nPublic response\n\nPublic feedback on the sculpture has not been systematically recorded by the VMFA, and visitor numbers are hard to record as it is visible from the public realm outside the Museum. However, anecdotal evidence from the curatorial team at the Museum finds the response to be largely positive. The monument has, for example, attracted visits from younger generations and from African American families both from inside and outside of Richmond, who specifically travel to view the monument.\n\nThere were objections to the statue from some conservative members of the VMFA who felt the statue disrespected Confederate heritage. An estimated 3,000 people withdrew their membership (out of a total of approximately 40,000 members).\n\nThe site of the statue has not been used for any public protests. However, contestation of the Confederate statues on Monument Avenue has continued, particularly following the racial justice protests in 2020 and beyond. This has led to the de-installation of several prominent monuments, including the J.E.B Stuart statue which originally inspired 'Rumors of War'.\n\nThe warm response to the statue from local residents has encouraged further reinterpretation work in the area, including at a Confederate Memorial Chapel located on the grounds of the VMFA. Similar to the visual counter-narrative presented by Rumors of War, the Museum has opened a temporary exhibition with sound installations that have featured Donald Moffett’s Impeach (2006) and, most recently, John Sim’s 'AfroDixie Remixes' (2015) – a twelve track remix of the Confederate-era song Dixie, interpreted in a myriad of African-American musical genres."
