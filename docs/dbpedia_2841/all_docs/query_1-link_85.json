        "text": "Historic Headstones and Markers (prior to World War I)\n\nEligibility\n\nEligibility criteria for a Government-furnished headstone or marker are provided in Section 2306 of Title 38 of the United States Code (Headstones, Markers, and Burial Receptacles). The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may furnish a Government headstone or marker for eligible individuals buried in private cemeteries who died prior to November 1, 1990, if the grave is unmarked. VA may furnish a Government headstone or marker for eligible individuals buried in private cemeteries who died on or after November 1, 1990 if the grave is marked with a private headstone or marker.\n\nDocumentation\n\nVA requires detailed primary documentation for proof of military service prior to World War I. This documentation may include Compiled Military Service Records (CMSR), extracts from official State files, Federal pension documents or land warrants. You may obtain copies of CMSRs and Federal pension records through the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). You may order copies of these documents via telephone, by mail, or through the Internet. NARA may charge a fee for these records (depending on whether you request a partial or complete file), and NARA usually ships the documentation in 60–90 days. The papers provided in a partial pension file will generally contain appropriate information to document military service. Fees and time periods are subject to change. For further information, refer to NARA's web page on Pre-World War I military service records at Pre-World War I military service records or by sending the NAFT Form 86 to the addresses listed on the form.\n\nPension records for Confederate Soldiers/Sailors will not be accepted as proof, of military service.\n\nVA requires documents showing active Federal service to establish eligibility for Veterans of the Revolutionary War, Indian Wars, War of 1812, and the Mexican War. VA will only furnish a headstone or marker for eligible individuals who performed actual national (Federal) service. Members of a state militia are only eligible if their service was Federalized (i.e., called to \"active service\"). Militia members or patriots with no Federal service are not eligible to receive a Government-furnished headstone or marker.\n\nYou must provide VA with proof of burial or disposition of the Veteran's remains and the documentation must be from the Veteran's era confirming the final disposition of the remains.\n\nUnrecoverable / Unidentifiable Remains\n\nVA will provide a memorial headstone or marker as defined by 38 USC §2306(b)(2)(A). VA will inscribe \"IN MEMORY OF\" above the Veteran's name on all memorial headstone and markers.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the Veteran's death must be such to reasonably assume the body was unrecoverable or unidentifiable due to burning or drowning, or burial in a mass grave, etc. The fact that the location of the Veteran's grave is unknown is not a sufficient basis for a memorial headstone or marker.\n\nDetermining whether a Veteran will receive a memorial marker is based on documentation and evidence, not what is requested on the application.\n\nAdditional Inscriptions on Pre-WWI Headstones and Markers\n\nDue to the historic nature of the Pre-WWI headstones and markers, VA will not inscribe additional inscriptions, awards, or terms of endearment.\n\nTypes\n\nFor periods of war other than the Civil War or Spanish American War, VA will provide traditional styles of headstones and markers. Traditional styles include upright marble (U1) or granite (V1) headstones, and flat granite (G1), flat marble (F1), and flat bronze (B1) markers.\n\nReplacement\n\nVA will replace a Government-furnished headstone or marker if it meets the criteria defined in 38 CFR § 38.630(b)(3). If the grave is marked with an illegible or damaged private headstone or marker, the applicant must provide VA with military documents to determine eligibility for a Government-furnished replacement.\n\nTo request a replacement headstone or marker, the applicant must check \"Replacement\" in Block 2 and clearly state the reason for the replacement in Block 33, Remarks."
