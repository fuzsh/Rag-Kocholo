        "text": "Confederate monuments and memorials in the United States include public displays and symbols of the Confederate States of America (CSA), Confederate leaders, or Confederate soldiers of the American Civil War. Many monuments and memorials have been or will be removed under great controversy. Part of the commemoration of the American Civil War, these symbols include monuments and statues, flags, holidays and other observances, and the names of schools, roads, parks, bridges, buildings, counties, cities, lakes, dams, military bases, and other public structures.[a] In a December 2018 special report, Smithsonian Magazine stated, \"over the past ten years, taxpayers have directed at least $40 million to Confederate monuments—statues, homes, parks, museums, libraries, and cemeteries—and to Confederate heritage organizations.\"[2]\n\nThis entry does not include commemorations of pre-Civil War figures connected with the origins of the Civil War or white supremacy but not directly tied to the Confederacy, such as Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney, pro-slavery congressman Preston Brooks, North Carolina Chief Justice Thomas Ruffin,[3] or Southern politician John C. Calhoun, although Calhoun was venerated by the Confederacy and post-war segregationists, and monuments to Calhoun \"have been the most consistent targets\" of vandals.[4] It also does not include post-Civil War white supremacists, such as North Carolina Governor Charles Aycock and Mississippi Governor James K. Vardaman.\n\nMonuments and memorials are listed alphabetically by state, and by city within each state. States not listed have no known qualifying items for the list.[5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMonument building and dedications\n\n[edit]\n\nMemorials have been erected on public spaces (including on courthouse grounds) either at public expense or funded by private organizations and donors. Numerous private memorials have also been erected.\n\nAccording to Smithsonian Magazine, \"Confederate monuments aren't just heirlooms, the artifacts of a bygone era. Instead, American taxpayers are still heavily investing in these tributes today.\"[2] The report also concluded that the monuments were constructed and are regularly maintained in promotion of the Lost Cause, white supremacist mythology, and over the many decades of their establishment, African American leaders regularly protested these memorials and what they represented.[2]\n\nA small number of memorializations were made during the war, mainly as ship and place names. After the war, Robert E. Lee said on several occasions that he was opposed to any monuments, as they would, in his opinion, \"keep open the sores of war\".[7][8] Nevertheless, monuments and memorials continued to be dedicated shortly after the American Civil War.[9][1] Before 1890, most were erected in cemeteries as memorials to soldiers who died in the war.[10] Many more monuments were dedicated in the years after 1890, when Congress established the first National Military Park at Chickamauga and Chattanooga, and by the turn of the 20th century, five battlefields from the Civil War had been preserved: Chickamauga-Chattanooga, Antietam, Gettysburg, Shiloh, and Vicksburg. At Vicksburg National Military Park, more than 95% of the park's monuments were erected in the first eighteen years after the park was established in 1899.[11] But monuments began appearing in public places with the emergence of the Jim Crow South.[10]\n\nJim Crow\n\n[edit]\n\nConfederate monument-building has often been part of widespread campaigns to promote and justify Jim Crow laws in the South.[12][1][13] According to the American Historical Association (AHA), the erection of Confederate monuments during the early 20th century was \"part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South.\" According to the AHA, memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period \"were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction, and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life.\" A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the AHA \"these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes.\"[14] According to Smithsonian Magazine, \"far from simply being markers of historic events and people, as proponents argue, these memorials were created and funded by Jim Crow governments to pay homage to a slave-owning society and to serve as blunt assertions of dominance over African-Americans.\"[2]\n\nAccording to historian Jane Dailey from the University of Chicago, in many cases, the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a \"white supremacist future\".[15] Another historian, Karen L. Cox, from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, has written that the monuments are \"a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era\", and that \"the whole point of Confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy\".[13] Another historian from UNC, James Leloudis, stated that \"The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule.\"[16] They were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African Americans, who remembered the Civil War far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.[17] According to Civil War historian Judith Giesberg, professor of history at Villanova University, \"White supremacy is really what these statues represent.\"[18] Some monuments were also meant to beautify cities as part of the City Beautiful movement, although this was secondary.[19]\n\nIn a June 2018 speech, Civil War historian James I. Robertson Jr. of Virginia Tech said the monuments were not a \"Jim Crow signal of defiance\" and referred to the current trend to dismantle or destroy them as an \"age of idiocy\" motivated by \"elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of Americans have painfully constructed.\"[20] Katrina Dunn Johnson, Curator of the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum, states that \"thousands of families throughout the country were unable to reclaim their soldier's remains--many never learned their loved ones' exact fate on the battlefield or within the prison camps. The psychological impact of such a devastating loss cannot be underestimated when attempting to understand the primary motivations behind Southern memorialization.\"[21]\n\nMany Confederate monuments were dedicated in the former Confederate states and border states in the decades following the Civil War, in many instances by Ladies Memorial Associations, United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), United Confederate Veterans (UCV), Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), the Heritage Preservation Association, and other memorial organizations.[22][23][24] Other Confederate monuments are located on Civil War battlefields. Many Confederate monuments are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, either separately or as contributing objects within listings of courthouses or historic districts. Art historians Cynthia Mills and Pamela Simpson argued, in Monuments to the Lost Cause, that the majority of Confederate monuments, of the type they define, were \"commissioned by white women, in hope of preserving a positive vision of antebellum life.\"[25][26]\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, technological innovations in the granite and bronze industries helped reduce costs and made monuments more affordable for small towns. Companies looking to capitalize on this opportunity often sold nearly identical copies of monuments to both the North and South.[27]\n\nAnother wave of monument construction coincided with the Civil Rights Movement and the American Civil War Centennial.[1]: 11 At least thirty-two Confederate monuments were dedicated between 2000 and 2017, including at least 7 re-dedications.[28][29][30][31]\n\nScholarly study\n\n[edit]\n\nScholarly studies of the monuments began in the 1980s. In 1983 John J. Winberry published a study which was based on data from the work of R.W. Widener.[32][33] He estimated that the main building period for monuments was from 1889 to 1929 and that of the monuments erected in courthouse squares over half were built between 1902 and 1912. He determined four main locations for monuments; battlefields, cemeteries, county courthouse grounds, and state capitol grounds. Over a third of the courthouse monuments were dedicated to the dead. The majority of the cemetery monuments in his study were built in the pre-1900 period, while most of the courthouse monuments were erected after 1900. Of the 666 monuments in his study 55% were of Confederate soldiers, while 28% were obelisks. Soldiers dominated courthouse grounds, while obelisks account for nearly half of cemetery monuments. The idea that the soldier statues always faced north was found to be untrue and that the soldiers usually faced the same direction as the courthouse. He noted that the monuments were \"remarkably diverse\" with \"only a few instances of repetition of inscriptions\".[33]\n\nHe categorized the monuments into four types. Type 1 was a Confederate soldier on a column with his weapon at parade rest, or weaponless and gazing into the distance. These accounted for approximately half the monuments studied. They are, however, the most popular among the courthouse monuments. Type 2 was a Confederate soldier on a column with rifle ready, or carrying a flag or bugle. Type 3 was an obelisk, often covered with drapery and bearing cannonballs or an urn. This type was 28% of the monuments studied, but 48% of the monuments in cemeteries and 18% of courthouse monuments. Type 4 was a miscellaneous group, including arches, standing stones, plaques, fountains, etc. These account for 17% of the monuments studied.[33]\n\nOver a third of the courthouse monuments were specifically dedicated to the Confederate dead. The first courthouse monument was erected in Bolivar, Tennessee, in 1867. By 1880 nine courthouse monuments had been erected. Winberry noted two centers of courthouse monuments: the Potomac counties of Virginia, from which the tradition spread to North Carolina, and a larger area covering Georgia, South Carolina and northern Florida. The diffusion of courthouse monuments was aided by organizations such as the United Confederate Veterans and their publications, though other factors may also have been effective.[33]\n\nWinberry listed four reasons for the shift from cemeteries to courthouses. First was the need to preserve the memory of the Confederate dead and also recognize the veterans who returned. Second was to celebrate the rebuilding of the South after the war. Third was the romanticizing of the Lost Cause, and the fourth was to unify the white population in a common heritage against the interests of African-American Southerners. He concluded: \"No one of these four possible explanations for the Confederate monument is adequate or complete in itself. The monument is a symbol, but whether it was a memory of the past, a celebration of the present, or a portent of the future remains a difficult question to answer; monuments and symbols can be complicated and sometimes indecipherable.\"[33]\n\nThe Monument Movement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Monument Movement was a national movement of the late 19th and early 20th century. The Union and Confederate monuments were erected as community memorials. In the North and South communities came together in the time of war, contributing their men and boys (and a few documented women), then they came together again to memorialize these soldiers and their contributions to the cause as they saw it. Citizens paid subscriptions to memorials, for monument associations, taxes were issued, the GAR, Allied Orders, the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and the United Confederate Veterans all lead fundraisers.[34]\n\nThe monument to Confederate Colonel Francis S. Bartow was erected after First Manassas but was destroyed before or during Second Manassas. The other early monuments were Union monuments at Battle of Rowlett's Station in Munfordville, Kentucky in January 1862 for the men of the 32nd Indiana killed. It was removed for its own protection from the elements in 2008.[35] Other early Union monuments before the war ended were the Hazen Brigade Monument in Murfreesboro and the 1865 Ladd and Whitney Monument in Lowell, Massachusetts.[36][37][38]\n\nThe Northern memorials recorded in the survey work to date lists 11 monuments erected before 1866 including the previously mentioned monuments. Another ten monuments were documented in 1866, and 11 more in 1867 by the time the first post-war Confederate monuments were erected in Romney, Hampshire County, West Virginia and Chester, Chester County, South Carolina in 1867.[34]\n\nIn addition to monuments to the Union and Confederate honorees, the Monument Movement saw the placement of Revolutionary War Monuments for the 100th of the American Revolution from 1876 to 1883. In the W.H. Mullins Company catalog, The Blue and the Gray, it notes with Union and Confederate Monuments the company's recent installments of monuments for the Revolutionary War at Guilford Courthouse, North Carolina.[39]\n\nVandalism\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of June 19, over 12 Confederate monuments had been vandalized in 2019, usually with paint.[40][41][needs update]\n\nRemoval\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of April 2017 , at least 60 symbols of the Confederacy had been removed or renamed since 2015, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).[42] At the same time, laws in various Southern states place restrictions on, or prohibit altogether, the removal of statues and memorials and the renaming of parks, roads, and schools.[43][44][45][46][47]\n\nA 2017 Reuters poll found that 54% of adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure. The results were split along racial and political lines, with whites and Republicans preferring to keep the monuments in place, while blacks and Democrats were more likely to support their removal.[48][49] A similar 2017 poll by HuffPost/YouGov found that one-third of respondents favored removal, while 49% were opposed.[50][51]\n\nSupport for removal increased during the George Floyd protests, with 52% in favor of removal, and 44% opposed.[52][53]\n\nTime period Number of removals[54] 1865–2009 2 2009–2014 3 2015 (after Charleston church shooting) 4 2016 4 2017 (year of the Charlottesville car attack) 36 2018 8 2019 4 2020 (after murder of George Floyd) 94[55] 2021 16[56]\n\nGeographic distribution\n\n[edit]\n\nConfederate monuments are widely distributed across the southern United States.[33] The distribution pattern follows the general political boundaries of the Confederacy.[33] Of the more than 1503 public monuments and memorials to the Confederacy, more than 718 are monuments and statues. Nearly 300 monuments and statues are in Georgia, Virginia, or North Carolina. The western states that were largely settled after the Civil War have few or no memorials to the Confederacy.\n\nNational\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States Capitol\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the National Statuary Hall Collection, housed inside the United States Capitol, each state has provided statues of two citizens that the state wants to honor. Seven Confederate figures are among them, with one pending removal and replacement. The dates listed below reflect when each statue was given to the collection:[57][58]\n\nZebulon Baird Vance (North Carolina, 1916)[59]\n\nUriah M. Rose (Arkansas, 1917)[60] In 2019, the Arkansas legislature voted to replace both of its contributions to the collection, the statue of Rose and one of James Paul Clarke.[61] As of January 2023, replacement statues of Daisy Bates and Johnny Cash are being prepared for installation.[62]\n\nJoseph Wheeler (Alabama, 1925)[63]\n\nAlexander Hamilton Stephens (Georgia, 1927)[64]\n\nWade Hampton III (South Carolina, 1929)[65]\n\nJefferson Davis (Mississippi, 1931)[66]\n\nJames Zachariah George (Mississippi, 1931)[67]\n\nIn addition to these pieces, three additional sculptures of Confederate figures have been removed since the turn of the 21st century.\n\nJabez Lamar Monroe Curry (Alabama, 1908) was removed and replaced by a statue of Helen Keller in 2009.[68]\n\nRobert E. Lee (Virginia, 1909) was removed in 2020.[69] In January 2023, the design of a replacement statue of Barbara Rose Johns was revealed. At the time, sculptor Steven Weitzman stated that the statue would be ready for installation sometime in 2024.[69]\n\nEdmund Kirby Smith (Florida, 1922) was removed in 2021 and replaced by a statue of Mary McLeod Bethune in 2022.[70]\n\nArlington National Cemetery\n\n[edit]\n\nThe antebellum home of Robert E. Lee during the Civil War, Arlington House, in Arlington County, Virginia, overlooks Arlington National Cemetery. A National Park Service (NPS) memorial, the estate became the site of Arlington National Cemetery in part to ensure that Lee could never live there.[71]\n\nThe NPS describes the property as \"the nation's memorial to Robert E. Lee. It honors him for specific reasons, including his role in promoting peace and reunion after the Civil War. In a larger sense it exists as a place of study and contemplation of the meaning of some of the most difficult aspects of American History: military service; sacrifice; citizenship; duty; loyalty; slavery and freedom.\"[72]\n\nThe Confederate Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery was a project of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. authorized in 1906 by the United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft, and unveiled by President Wilson in 1914.[73] The memorial was removed in December 2023.[74]\n\nCoins and stamps\n\n[edit]\n\nRobert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson were portrayed by the US Mint on the 1925 Commemorative silver US half dollar, along with the words \"Stone Mountain\". The coin was a fundraiser for the Stone Mountain monument, which honors the Confederate Generals. The authorized issue was 5 million coins, to be sold at $1 each, but that proved overly optimistic and only 1.3 million coins were released, many of which ended up in circulation after being spent for face value.[75] The caption on the reverse reads \"Memorial to the valor of the soldier of the South\".\n\nRobert E. Lee has been commemorated on at least five US postage stamps. One 1936–37 stamp featured Generals Lee and Stonewall Jackson with Lee's home Stratford Hall.[76]\n\nUS military\n\n[edit]\n\nBases\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to 2023, there were nine major U.S. military bases named in honor of Confederate military leaders, all in former Confederate states.[1] Following nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd by a police officer, the United States Congress in 2021 created The Naming Commission in order to rename military assets with names associated with the Confederacy.[77] The United States Secretary of Defense was required to implement a plan developed by the commission and to \"remove all names, symbols, displays, monuments, and paraphernalia that honor or commemorate the Confederate States of America or any person who served voluntarily with the Confederate States of America from all assets of the Department of Defense\" within three years of the commission's creation.[78][79]\n\nBy October 2023, all nine bases had officially been redesignated under new names proposed by the commission.\n\nFort A.P.

In 1971, urban renewal led to the elimination of the Square, and the monument was moved to the east lawn of the Red Brick Courthouse (no longer in use as such), facing south.[325] In 1994 it was cleaned and waxed by the Maryland Military Monuments Commission.[321] The monument was defaced with \"Black Lives Matter\" in 2015; a wooden box was built over it to protect it.[326] The monument was removed in July 2017 from its original location outside the Old Rockville Court House to private land[324] at White's Ferry in Dickerson, Maryland.[327][328] The statue was removed from the pedestal in June 2020, but the pedestal urging people to \"Love The Thin Gray Line\" remains.\n\nInhabited places\n\n[edit]\n\nConfederate Hills: A residential community near Antietam National Battlefield where the streets are all named after Confederate generals, including: Longstreet Circle, General Anderson Court, General Branch Court, General Gordon Circle, General Hill Circle, General Lee Drive, General Stonewall Jackson Circle, and General Stuart Court.[329][330]\n\nRoads\n\n[edit]\n\nPotomac:\n\nJubal Early Court\n\nJ.
