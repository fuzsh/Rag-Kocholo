        "text": "Ongoing development in the United States\n\nThere are more than 160 monuments and memorials to the Confederate States of America (CSA; the Confederacy) and associated figures that have been removed from public spaces in the United States, all but five of which have been since 2015.[1] Some have been removed by state and local governments; others have been torn down by protestors.\n\nMore than 700 such monuments and memorials have been created on public land, the vast majority in the South during the era of Jim Crow laws from 1877 to 1964.[2] Efforts to remove them increased after the Charleston church shooting, the Unite the Right rally, and the murder of George Floyd.[3][4][5]\n\nProponents of their removal cite historical analysis that the monuments were not built as memorials, but to intimidate African Americans and reaffirm white supremacy after the Civil War;[6][7][8][9] and that they memorialize an unrecognized, treasonous[10][11] government, the Confederacy, whose founding principle was the perpetuation and expansion of slavery. They also argue that the presence of these memorials more than a hundred years after the defeat of the Confederacy continues to disenfranchise and alienate African Americans.[12][13][14][15][16]\n\nOpponents view that removing the monuments as erasing history or a sign of disrespect for heritage. Some Southern states passed state laws restricting or prohibiting the removal or alteration of public monuments.[17]\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, five Confederate monuments were removed after the Civil War, eight in the two years after the Charleston shooting, 48 in the three years after the Unite the Right rally, and 110 in the two years after George Floyd's murder.[1] In 2022, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he would order the renaming of U.S. military bases named for Confederate generals, as well as other Defense Department property that honored Confederates.[18]\n\nThe campaign to remove monuments extended beyond the United States; many statues and other public works of art related to the transatlantic slave trade and European colonialism around the world have been removed or destroyed.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nMost of the Confederate monuments on public land were built in periods of racial conflict, such as when Jim Crow laws were being introduced in the late 19th century and at the start of the 20th century or during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.[note 2][note 3] These two periods also coincided with the 50th and 100th year after the end of the Civil War, including the American Civil War Centennial.[2] The peak in construction of Civil War monuments occurred between the late 1890s up to 1920, with a second smaller peak in the late-1950s to mid-1960s.[2]\n\nIn an August 2017 statement on the monuments controversy, the American Historical Association (AHA) said that to remove a monument \"is not to erase history, but rather to alter or call attention to a previous interpretation of history.\" The AHA said that most monuments were erected \"without anything resembling a democratic process\", and recommended that it was \"time to reconsider these decisions.\" Most Confederate monuments were erected during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century, and this undertaking was \"part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South.\" Memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period \"were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction, and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life.\" A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the AHA \"these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes.\"[20]\n\nMichael J. McAfee, curator of history at the West Point Museum, said, \"There are no monuments that mention the name Benedict Arnold. What does this have to do with the Southern monuments honoring the political and military leaders of the Confederacy? They, like Arnold, were traitors. They turned their backs on their nation, their oaths, and the sacrifices of their ancestors in the War for Independence....They attempted to destroy their nation to defend chattel slavery and from a sense that as white men they were innately superior to all other races. They fought for white racial supremacy. That is why monuments glorifying them and their cause should be removed. Leave monuments marking their participation on the battlefields of the war, but tear down those that only commemorate the intolerance, violence, and hate that inspired their attempt to destroy the American nation.\"\n\nUniversity of Chicago historian Jane Dailey wrote that in many cases the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a \"white supremacist future\".[22] Civil War historian Judith Giesberg, professor of history at Villanova University agrees: \"White supremacy is really what these statues represent.\"[23]\n\nHistorian Karyn Cox of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte has written that the monuments are \"a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era\".[24] University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill historian James Leloudis wrote, \"The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule.\"[25]\n\nAdam Goodheart, Civil War author and director of the Starr Center at Washington College, told National Geographic: \"They're 20th-century artifacts in the sense that a lot of it had to do with a vision of national unity that embraced Southerners as well as Northerners, but importantly still excluded black people.\"[12] Goodheart said that the statues were meant to be symbols of white supremacy and the rallying around them by white supremacists will likely hasten their demise.[26] Eleanor Harvey, a senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and a scholar of Civil War history, said: \"If white nationalists and neo-Nazis are now claiming this as part of their heritage, they have essentially co-opted those images and those statues beyond any capacity to neutralize them again\".[12]\n\nElijah Anderson, a professor of sociology at Yale University, said the statues' continued existence \"really impacts the psyche of black people.\"[27] Harold Holzer, the director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College, argued that this was intentional: the statues were designed to belittle African Americans.[28] Dell Upton, chair of the Department of Art History at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote that \"the monuments were not intended as public art\", but rather were installed \"as affirmations that the American polity was a white polity\", and that because of their explicitly white supremacist intent, their removal from civic spaces was a matter \"of justice, equity, and civic values.\"[8]\n\nCivil War historian David Blight asked: \"Why, in the year [2016], should communal spaces in the South continue to be sullied by tributes to those who defended slavery? How can Americans ignore the pain that black citizens, especially, must feel when they walk by the [John C.] Calhoun monument, or any similar statues, on their way to work, school or Bible study?\"[29]\n\nIn a 1993 book on the issue in Georgia, author Frank McKenney argued otherwise; \"These monuments were communal efforts, public art, and social history\", he wrote.[30] Ex-soldiers and politicians had difficult time raising funds to erect monuments so the task mostly fell to the women, the \"mothers widows, and orphans, the bereaved fiancees and sisters\" of the soldiers who had died. Many ladies' memorial associations were formed in the decades following the end of the Civil War, most of them joining the United Daughters of the Confederacy following its inception in 1894. The women were advised to \"remember that they were buying art, not metal and stone.\"\n\nCheryl Benard, president of the Alliance for the Restoration of Cultural Heritage,[33] argued against the removal of Confederate war monuments in an op-ed written for The National Interest: \"From my vantage point, the idea that the way to deal with history is to destroy any relics that remind you of something you don't like, is highly alarming.\"[34]\n\nCivil War historian James I. Robertson Jr. said that the monuments were not a \"Jim Crow signal of defiance\". He called the current climate to dismantle or destroy Confederate monuments as an \"age of idiocy\", motivated by \"elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of Americans have painfully constructed\".[35]\n\nBut Upton argues that the monuments celebrated only one side of the story, one that was \"openly pro-Confederate\". The monuments were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African-Americans, who remembered the Civil War far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.[8] Robert Seigler, who documented more than 170 Confederate monuments in South Carolina, found only five dedicated to the African Americans who had been used by the Confederacy to build fortifications or \"had served as musicians, teamsters, cooks, servants, and in other capacities.\" Four of those were to slaves and one to a musician, Henry Brown.[36]\n\nAlfred Brophy, a professor of law at the University of Alabama, argued the removal of the Confederate statues \"facilitates forgetting\", although these statues were \"re-inscribed images of white supremacy\". Brophy said that the Lee statue in Charlottesville should be removed.[27]\n\nJulian Hayter, a historian at the University of Richmond, supports a different approach for the statues: re-contextualization. He supports adding a \"footnote of epic proportions\" such as a prominent historical sign or marker that explains the context in which they were built to help people see old monuments in a new light. \"I'm suggesting we use the scale and grandeur of those monuments against themselves. I think we lack imagination when we talk about memorials. It's all or nothin'.... As if there's nothin' in between that we could do to tell a more enriching story about American history.[37][38]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nJust five Confederate memorials were removed in the century-and-a-half after the Civil War. The modern effort to remove them was sparked by the Charleston church shooting of 2015. In the two years that followed, eight memorials were removed. In the city of New Orleans, a crane had to be brought in from an unidentified out-of-state company as no local company wanted the business.[40]\n\nThe removal movement was further galvanized by the August 2017 Unite the Right rally, which gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest the proposed removal of its Robert Edward Lee statue.[41] The rally saw deadly violence and the public display of white supremacist symbols. Within days, other cities moved to remove similar memorials. In Baltimore, for example, the city's Confederate statues were removed on the night of August 15–16, 2017. Mayor Catherine Pugh said that she ordered the overnight removals to preserve public safety.[42][43] Similarly, in Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray asked the city council on August 16, 2017, to approve the removal of two statues from a courthouse.[44][45]\n\nWithin three years of the Charleston shooting, at least 114 Confederate monuments were removed from public spaces, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which published an extensive report in 2016 of Confederate memorials in public spaces[2] and keeps an up-to-date list online.[46][47] Texas removed 31, more than any other state.[48]\n\nA 2017 Reuters poll found that 54% of American adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure. According to Reuters, \"responses to the poll were sharply split along racial and party lines, however, with whites and Republicans largely supportive of preservation. Democrats and minorities were more likely to support removal.\"[49][50] Another 2017 poll, by HuffPost/YouGov, found that 48% of respondents favored the \"remain\" option, 33% favored removal, and 18% were unsure.[51][52] An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll released in 2017 found that most Americans, including 44% of African Americans, believe that statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy should remain in place.[53]\n\nIn 2017, Jason Spencer, a white member of the Georgia legislature, told an African-American colleague that if she continued calling for removal of Confederate monuments, she wouldn't be \"met with torches but something a lot more definitive\", and that people who want the statues gone \"will go missing in the Okefenokee....Don't say I didn't warn you.\"[54][55]\n\nVarious groups of proponents met March 22–24, 2018, in New Orleans \"to commemorate, celebrate and strategically align Take 'Em Down efforts.\" A second such conference was held March 22–24, 2019, in Jacksonville, Florida.[56]\n\nIn April 2020, a study found that Confederate monuments were more likely to be removed in localities that had a large black and Democratic population, a chapter of the NAACP, and Southern state legislatures that have the power to decree removal.[57] Public support for removal increased during the George Floyd protests, with 52% in favor of removal, and 44% opposed.[58][59]\n\nMost of the removals have been undertaken by state and local governments, while a relative few memorials were pulled down by protestors. For example, the bust of Robert E. Lee in Fort Myers, Florida, was toppled by unknown parties during the night of March 11–12, 2019. At least three were demolished by protestors in states that had passed laws to make it more difficult to legally remove them: Silent Sam, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina; the Confederate Soldiers Monument in Durham, North Carolina; and the Screven County Confederate Dead Monument, in Sylvania, Georgia. The latter two were damaged beyond repair, while Silent Sam, which was not seriously damaged, was placed in storage, awaiting a political decision on its fate. The \"Confederate Dead Monument\" was replaced through funds raised by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy.[60]\n\nYears Removals[1] 1865–2009 2 2009–2014 3 2015 (after Charleston church shooting) 4 2016 4 2017 (year of the Unite the Right rally) 36 2018 8 2019 4 2020 (after murder of George Floyd) 94[61] 2021 17[62] 2022 16[63]\n\nLegal impediments\n\n[edit]\n\nSeven states have passed laws that impede or forbid the removal or alteration of public Confederate monuments. Laws in Georgia (early 20th century),[64] North Carolina (2015),[65] and Alabama (2017)[66] prohibit removal or alteration.[67] Laws in South Carolina (2000), Mississippi (2004), and Tennessee (2013, updated 2016) impede such actions.\n\nA 1902 law in Virginia was repealed in 2020; other attempts to repeal state laws have not been successful.\n\nIn 2023 Florida Republican Dean Black filed legislation that would punish any lawmakers who vote to remove \"historical monuments and memorials.\"[68] Under this bill, if local lawmakers vote in favor of the removal of Confederate statues, they may be fined or removed from office by the governor.\n\nTennessee law\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2016, Tennessee passed its Tennessee Heritage Protection Act, which requires a two-thirds majority of the Tennessee Historical Commission to rename, remove, or move any public statue, monument, or memorial.[69] A 2018 amendment passed in response to events in Memphis (see below) prohibits municipalities from selling or transferring ownership of memorials without a waiver, and \"allows any entity, group or individual with an interest in a Confederate memorial to seek an injunction to preserve the memorial in question.\"[70] The New York Times wrote in 2018 that the Tennessee act shows \"an express intent to prevent municipalities in Tennessee from taking down Confederate memorials.\"[71]\n\nAs of 2022, the Tennessee Historical Commission has considered seven petitions to remove a Confederate monument and approved just one: for the Forrest bust in the state capitol.[72]\n\nSouth Carolina law\n\n[edit]\n\nThe removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol required a two-thirds vote of both houses of the legislature, as would the removal of any other Confederate monument in South Carolina.[73]\n\nNorth Carolina law\n\n[edit]\n\nA state law, the Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act of 2015,[74][75] prevents local governments from removing monuments on public property, and places limits on their movement within the property.[76] In August 2017, Governor Roy Cooper asked the North Carolina Legislature to repeal the law, writing: \"I don't pretend to know what it's like for a person of color to pass by one of these monuments and consider that those memorialized in stone and metal did not value my freedom or humanity. Unlike an African-American father, I'll never have to explain to my daughters why there exists an exalted monument for those who wished to keep her and her ancestors in chains...We cannot continue to glorify a war against the United States of America fought in the defense of slavery. These monuments should come down.\" He also asked the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to \"determine the cost and logistics of removing Confederate monuments from state property.\"[77][78][79][80] Cooper later removed, on the grounds of public safety, three Confederate monuments at the North Carolina Capitol that the legislature had in effect made illegal to remove.\n\nAfter the University of North Carolina renamed Saunders Hall in 2014 (see below), its Board of Trustees prohibited further renamings for 16 years.[81]\n\nIn 2019, North Carolina's law prohibiting monument removal was challenged indirectly. The Confederate Soldiers Monument in Winston-Salem was removed as a public nuisance, and a similar monument in Pittsboro was removed after a court ruled that it had never become county property, so the statute did not apply.[82]\n\nVirginia law\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 8, 2020, the Virginia legislature \"passed measures that would undo an existing state law that protects the monuments and instead let local governments decide their fate.\"[83] On April 11, 2020, Governor Ralph Northam signed the bill into law,[84] which went into effect on July 1. Previously, the state law had prohibited local governments from taking the monuments down, moving them, or even adding placards explaining why they were erected.[85]\n\nAlabama law\n\n[edit]\n\nAlabama's law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act, was passed in May 2017. On January 14, 2019, a circuit judge ruled that the law is an un-Constitutional infringement on the City of Birmingham's right to free speech, and cannot be enforced.[86][87] On November 27, 2019, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed that ruling by a vote of nine to zero. In their decision, the court stated that \"a municipality has no individual, substantive constitutional rights and that the trial court erred by holding that the City has constitutional rights to free speech.\"[88][89]\n\nUnsuccessful federal legislation\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 22, 2020, amid the George Floyd protests, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 305–113 to remove a bust of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney from the old robing room next to the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the Capitol Building. The bill (H.R. 7573[90]) would also have removed statues honoring Confederate figures and create a \"process to obtain a bust of [Justice Thurgood] Marshall...and place it there within a minimum of two years.\"[91] The bill reached the Republican-led Senate on July 30, 2020 (S.4382) and was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration, which took no further action on it.[92]\n\nVestigial pedestals\n\n[edit]\n\nThe empty pedestals or plinths left after monument removal have met various fates.\n\nIn Baltimore, one of the four empty plinths was used in 2017 for a statue of a pregnant black woman, naked from the waist up, holding a baby in a brightly-covered sling on her back, with a raised golden fist: Madre Luz (Mother Light). The statue was first placed in front of the monument before its removal, then raised to the pedestal. Artist Pablo Machioli said \"his original idea was to construct a pregnant mother as a symbol of life. 'I feel like people would understand and respect that'\". The statue was vandalized several times before it was removed by the city.[93][94]\n\nFor the toppled Silent Sam monument at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, two scholars proposed leaving the \"empty pedestal — shorn all original images and inscriptions — [which] eliminates the offending tribute while still preserving a record of what these communities did and where they did it.... The most effective way to commemorate the rise and fall of white supremacist monument-building is to preserve unoccupied pedestals as the ruins that they are — broken tributes to a morally bankrupt cause.\"[95] Instead, the plinth and its plaques were removed on January 14, 2019, at the direction of university Chancellor Carol Folt.\n\nThe plinths of the statues in Richmond, Virginia, were removed in 2022.[96] In some of Richmond's Monument Avenue intersections, the spotlights remain —pointed upward toward now-empty space.\n\nList of removals\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nNational\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. Army renamed Forrest Road - named for Confederate general and Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest - at Fort Bliss after receiving complaints. The road was renamed Cassidy Road after Lt. Gen. Richard T. Cassidy, a former post commander.[97]\n\nIn February 2020, the commandant of the Marine Corps, General David H. Berger, ordered \"the removal of all Confederate-related paraphernalia from Marine Corps installations\", including Confederate flags, bumper stickers, and \"similar items\".[98]\n\nThe U.S. Navy has similarly prohibited the display of the Confederate flag, including as bumper stickers on private cars on base; a wave of corporate product re-branding has also ensued.\n\nIn 2021, Congress ordered the Defense Department to establish a commission to consider whether to rename various bases, ships, buildings, streets, and other things named to honor Confederate figures. In 2022, this Naming Commission recommended changing the names of nine Army bases, two Navy ships, and other items.[99] Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to follow the commission's recommendations.[18]\n\nIn May 2022, the first part of the Naming Commission's report recommended changing the names of nine Army bases:\n\nFort Benning, Georgia, was renamed Fort Moore, in honor of Lt.

Renamed \"Confederate Park\" in 1923 at the request of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. A Confederate soldier statue was erected in 1910 at the intersection of North Main Avenue and West Capital Street adjacent to the Park.

The organization that owned it, the Confederate Memorial Association, keeps active the 1997 web page that lists paintings and artifacts at this self-designated \"Confederate Embassy\". The building was seized and sold in 1997 to pay $500,000 in contempt-of-court fines imposed by District of Columbia courts on association president John Edward Hurley.[143] It then became a private residence.[144][145]\n\nIn 2016, Washington National Cathedral removed small Confederate flags from stained-glass windows honoring Robert E.

On October 19, 2015, the Senate agreed to change the seal so as to remove the Confederate battle flag from it.[151] The new (2016) Senate seal has only the flags of the United States and Florida.[152]\n\nBradenton\n\nOn August 22, 2017, the Manatee County Commission voted 4–3 to move the Confederate monument in front of the county courthouse to storage.[153] This granite obelisk was dedicated on June 22, 1924, by the Judah P. Benjamin Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. It commemorates Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, and Jefferson Davis, and the \"Memory of Our Confederate Soldiers.\"[154] On August 24, while being moved (at 3 AM), the spire toppled and broke. The clean break is repairable, but the County recommends it not be repaired until a new home is found.[155][156]: 32 No final decision has been made as of September 2018, but the Gamble Plantation Historic State Park has been suggested as a possible new home for it.[157]\n\nCrestview\n\nFlorida's Last Confederate Veteran Memorial, City Park (1958). In 2015, ownership was transferred to trustees of Lundy's family and the memorial was moved to private property.[156][158] Soon after, research determined the memorialized man had not been a veteran but had falsified his age to get veteran benefits.[159] After the removal of the Confederate monument and flag, the park is now referred to as the \"former Confederate Park.\"[159]\n\nDaytona Beach\n\nIn August 2017, the Daytona Beach city manager made the decision to remove three plaques from Riverfront Park that honored Confederate veterans.[160][161][162]\n\nFort Myers\n\nThe bust of Robert E.

The city chipped in $200.\"[177] In May 2018, the Lakeland City Commission approved unanimously the removal of the statue to Veterans Park. However, they specified that private funds would have to cover the costs.[178] In six months, only $26,209 was raised, so commissioners voted in November \"to use $225,000 in red light camera citation money to pay for the move\".[179] A coalition of individuals and groups opposed to the move, including the Sons of Confederate Veterans, filed suit in federal court alleging that the money being used was public money, but the suit was dismissed in January 2019 \"as a matter of law\",[177] and the city proceeded, noting that it will be moved in the daytime.[180] The move started on March 21, 2019.[181]\n\nOrlando\n\nConfederate \"Johnny Reb\" monument, Lake Eola Park.

The funds were raised within 24 hours. The following day Save Southern Heritage, Veterans' Monuments of America, and United Daughters of the Confederacy filed a lawsuit attempting to prevent the statue's move.[199] On September 5, 2017, a Hillsborough administrative judge denied their request for an injunction. Removal of the monument, which took several days, began the same day.[198] It was cut into 26 pieces to enable its removal.[198] It was moved on September 5, 2017, to the Brandon Family Cemetery; the county paid half the $285,000 cost.[196][200]\n\nA 60 feet (18 m) x 30 feet (9.1 m) Confederate flag—when erected, the largest such flag ever made—at the privately-owned Confederate Memorial Park, placed so as to be visible at the intersection of I-4 and I-75, just east of Tampa (actually Seffner, Florida), was removed on June 1, 2020, by its owner, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, after threats to burn it were made on social media.[201]\n\nWest Palm Beach\n\nConfederate monument, Woodlawn Cemetery (1941), located at the front gate, directly behind an American flag. \"The only one south of St. Augustine, likely the only Confederate statue in Palm Beach and Broward counties, said historian Janet DeVries, who leads cemetery tours at Woodlawn.\" Vandalized several times.

The monument had been erected on Confederate Memorial Day, April 26, 1909, and moved to the city cemetery in the 1950s when the city turned the downtown Main Street park – where the monument was originally located – into a parking lot. The Georgia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans is offering a $2,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of those involved; the reward was subsequently increased to $10,000.[218] A photo of the destroyed monument shows a flagpole with a Confederate flag.[219]\n\nIndiana\n\n[edit]\n\nIndianapolis: On June 8, 2020, following the protests in response to the murder of George Floyd, the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument was removed from Garfield Park and dismantled.

Sports teams, formerly Rebels, are now Patriots.[236]\n\nNew Orleans: The first Confederate monuments removed in 2017 were those of New Orleans, although it was in 2015 that the City Council ordered their removal. Court challenges were unsuccessful. The workers who moved the monuments were dressed in bullet-proof vests, helmets, and masks to conceal their identities because of concerns about their safety.[237][238] According to Mayor Landrieu, \"The original firm we'd hired to remove the monuments backed out after receiving death threats and having one of his cars set ablaze.\"[239] \"Opponents at one point found their way to one of our machines and poured sand in the gas tank. Other protesters flew drones at the contractors to thwart their work.\"[240] The city said it was weighing where to display the monuments so they could be \"placed in their proper historical context from a dark period of American history.\"[241] On May 19, 2017, the Monumental Task Committee,[242] an organization that maintains monuments and plaques across the city, commented on the removal of the statues: \"Mayor Landrieu and the City Council have stripped New Orleans of nationally recognized historic landmarks. With the removal of four of our century-plus aged landmarks, at 299 years old, New Orleans now heads into our Tricentennial more divided and less historic.\" Landrieu replied on the same day: \"These statues are not just stone and metal. They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for.\"[243]\n\nA seven-person Monument Relocation Committee was set up by Mayor LaToya Cantrell to advise on what to do with the removed monuments. The statue of Jefferson Davis, if their recommendation is implemented, will be moved to Beauvoir, his former estate in Biloxi, Mississippi, that is now a presidential library and museum.[244] The Committee recommended that the statues of Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard be placed in Greenwood Cemetery, near City Park Avenue and Interstate 10 (where three other Confederate generals are entombed). However, this conflicts with a policy of former mayor Mitch Landrieu, who had directed that they never again be on public display in Orleans Parish.

In July, the monument was removed from its location at the northwest corner of the Old City Hall for cleaning. Later that same month, the \"Historic Artifact Management and Patriotism Act\" became law while the monument was still located in a city-owned warehouse. With a technicality, city manager Ron Carlee informed the City Council that he was moving the monument to the Confederate section of city-owned Elmwood Cemetery.

The proposal would leave the statue's pedestal in place and add outdoor markers honoring Union soldiers and enslaved people.\" The proposal needs approval from the Durham County Commission. Durham County maintains that the Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act of 2015 does not apply, since the law does not address damaged monuments.[332] On August 11, 2020, contractors removed the stone pedestal and moved it to a secure location following the recommendation of the City-County Committee on Confederate Monuments and Memorials.[333]\n\nStatue of Robert E.

Churton St., was built in 1934 and housed the (whites only) public library. The UDC donated $7,000 towards its construction, and it was named the Confederate Memorial Library. In 1983, after the library (now the Orange County Public Library) moved into a larger facility, the Museum moved in.

The Granville Board of Commissioners made the decision as they believed there was a credible threat that it would be forcibly removed and possible violent protest. The monument was placed in storage until a new location was determined. This was the second location of the monument; it was first located in front of the Granville County Courthouse till 1971, when it was moved to the library as a compromise from the Oxford Race Riot.[354]\n\nPittsboro: Confederate Soldiers Monument (1907), Old Chatham County Courthouse; erected by Winnie Davis Chapter, UDC.[355] In 2019, there were \"months\" of discussion about what to do with it, including \"multiple late-night Chatham County Board of Commissioners meetings\". There were citizens' groups calling for its removal (\"Chatham for All\") and for leaving it alone. As it is privately owned (by the UDC), the statute protecting public Civil War monuments does not apply, said the County. In July 2019, the local UDC chapter and the county \"signed a memorandum of understanding, agreeing to 'meet, cooperate, and work together in good faith to develop a mutually agreeable framework for \"reimagining\" the monument.'\" In an August 12 statement, the UDC said the statue was given by the UDC to the county, which now owns it, \"notwithstanding the statement on the south side of the statue carved in granite\", the state statute does apply, and \"is inappropriate that we re-imagine the statue in any way\".[356][357] After a court ruled that the statue belonged to the UDC and not the county, it was removed on November 20, 2019.[358]\n\nRaleigh:\n\nA Confederate battle flag hanging in the Old North Carolina State Capitol was removed in 2013.[359]\n\nOn June 19, 2020, protesters pulled down two of the three bronze soldiers on the 75-foot (23 m) Confederate monument at the state Capitol, with one of the statues hung by its neck from the streetlight.[360] The following day, Governor Cooper gave the orders that all three Confederate monuments, located on the Capitol grounds, to be removed for public safety. Two of the three monuments, the Women of the Confederacy (1914) and a statue of Henry Lawson Wyatt (1912), were removed that day and moved into storage.[361][362] The third, what remains of the monument to fallen Confederate soldiers (1895) was removed from June 21–23. Governor Cooper laid blame to the 2015 law as creating legal roadblocks to removal that eventually led to the dangerous incidents that happened.[363][364] The two cannons that flanked 75-foot Confederate monument were moved to Fort Fisher on June 28.[365]\n\nReidsville: From 1910 to 2011, the monument stood in Reidsville's downtown area.

In June 2016 the pedestal had been spray painted with the words \"Black Lives Matter\",[489] and overnight between July 7 and 8, 2017, it was vandalized by being daubed in red paint.[490] On August 20, 2017, the City Council unanimously voted to shroud the statue, and that of Stonewall Jackson, in black.
