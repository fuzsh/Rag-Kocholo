        "text": "Monument Avenue, a national historic landmark in Richmond, Virginia, has long been famous for its grand portrait monuments honouring local Civil War “heroes.” In 1996, the memorial landscape changed radically with the addition of a bronze portrait statue of Arthur Ashe, a black American who was honoured for his accomplishments as an international tennis star, an author, and a humanitarian. The location and the design of Ashe’s portrait monument generated heated debate, and its ultimate inclusion on Monument Avenue was an attempt to challenge the traditional meaning of the space as a memorial to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. In this article I trace how the racialised narrative of Monument Avenue has been constructed, challenged, upheld, and mediated throughout its long and troubled history. I begin by looking to antiquity both as a framework for understanding how statues have historically worked to construct and challenge cultural narratives and as a means of placing viewer reactions to portrait monuments in a broader historical context. Against this background, I argue that the portrait statue of Arthur Ashe ultimately failed to establish an effective counter-narrative to the traditional interpretation of Monument Avenue as a celebration of a white, Confederate past. Finally, I suggest that repeated small-scale interventions, often in the form of graffiti, have been more successful in confronting, mediating, and challenging the visual message Confederate monuments continue to embody."
