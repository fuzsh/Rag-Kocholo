        "text": "Update: On Tuesday, a judge allowed the removal to go ahead.\n\nHours after workers began removing a towering Confederate memorial from Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, a federal judge issued an order temporarily halting the effort to dismantle one of the country’s most prominent monuments to the Confederacy on public land.\n\nThe memorial has been criticized for its sanitized depiction of slavery, and the plan to remove it from the country’s most famous cemetery is part of a militarywide effort to take down Confederate symbols from bases, ships and other facilities. Dozens of Republican lawmakers have opposed removing the memorial.\n\nOn Monday, as the work to remove the monument was getting underway, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that had been requested by a group called Defend Arlington.\n\nThe group, which is affiliated with an organization called Save Southern Heritage Florida, sued the Defense Department in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on Sunday, arguing that the Pentagon had rushed its decision to take down the monument and that it had circumvented federal law by not preparing an environmental-impact statement. It also said that the work would damage the surrounding graves and headstones. A hearing on the matter was scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nSafety fencing was installed around the memorial over the weekend, and a spokeswoman for the cemetery said the disassembly work, which was expected to take several days, began on Monday morning before it was halted when the judge’s order was issued.\n\n“The Army is complying with the restraining order and has ceased the work begun this morning,” the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
