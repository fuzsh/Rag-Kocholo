        "text": "Paul Atreides is the central character of the first three books in Frank Herbert’s Dune Saga: Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune. And though he is not technically a character in God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune, his life and memory are a strong influence on the actions of his son, Leto, and the empire he comes to rule. Paul also appears in two stories (Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune) that were written by Frank Herbert’s son, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Alexander to conclude the series. In these installments, Paul and his beloved Chani are brought back to life thousands of years after their deaths as gholas—essentially a blend of a golem and a clone. And so, for the character of Paul Atreides, the Dune Saga resounds in its myriad experiences—a coming-of-age journey, a messianic movement, an imperial legacy, and eventually, a happily-ever-after story.\n\nWhat happens to Paul in Dune?\n\nWhen listeners first meet Paul Atreides in Dune, he’s 15 years old. He is preparing to live on the desert planet Arrakis after having lived his entire life on a planet covered in water. As the story opens, Paul has just woken up from a dream. He’s confused because the person speaking to him in his sleep referred to him as “Usul.\" Though unfamiliar to the young Paul, it's the first of many names people will know him by throughout his life.\n\nHis mother, Lady Jessica, raised by the Bene Gesserit warrior nuns and trained in the skills of many kinds of combat, believes that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach, the whirlwind—the only man capable of tapping into his female ancestors’ memories the way women of the Bene Gesserit can. It is prophesied that such a person will bring lasting change to the universe. After Paul survives a painful encounter with the Gom Jabbar, a tool to determine a future Bene Gesserit’s worth, Jessica granted permission to begin his training. He is already in the process of learning combat skills from Gurney Halleck in addition to learning the Weirding Way from his mother. These skills come in handy when House Atreides is attacked by the Harkonnens with the support of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. While his father, Leto, is killed by Baron Harkonnen, Paul manages to escape into the desert with his mother.\n\nFollowing the attack on their House, Paul and Jessica are taken in by a group of Fremen, led by the chief, Naib Stilgar. When Paul tries to hide from the Fremen hunting party that comes across Jessica, he is found by Chani, a girl he recognizes from his dreams. Chani will prove a key part of Paul’s destiny, eventually becoming his wife and companion. Paul begins to learn the Fremen way and later drinks from the water of life. After this ritual, Paul truly takes on the role of the Kwisatz Haderach.\n\nHe marries Chani in a Fremen ceremony while continuing to train in the ways of the Bene Gesserit. He and Chani have a son, Leto II, who is killed in an attack on the Fremen oasis, Sietch Tab'r. He eventually returns to the palace in Arrakeen, where he challenges House Harkonnen and the Emperor. After defeating the Harkonnen champion, he forces the Emperor to step down, leaving control of the Empire in Paul’s hands. With this agreement, he also takes the Emperor’s daughter, Princess Irulan, as his wife, though he ends the book promising Chani that it is in name only—she is the wife of his heart.\n\nWhat happens to Paul in Dune Messiah?\n\nWhen Dune Messiah opens, several years have passed since the events of Dune, and Paul is not only leading as the Emperor but also as the central figure of a religion known as Muad’Dib. His following has spread across the Empire, but the excessive violence many do in his name is crushing to Paul. While his external place as Emperor has never been more secure, he has still not had an heir—by choice with his wife, Irulan, and less so with his Fremen lover, Chani. Driven by jealousy, Irulan has been feeding Chani contraceptives. Paul is fully aware of this, and allows it to continue to protect his beloved. He has foreseen that with the birth of his child, Chani will die.\n\nWhen an attack on his household leaves him blind, Paul shocks his followers and enemies alike by effectively continuing to see by using his prescience to guide his actions. As a result, the Fremen deem him a god. After Chani gives birth to twins (much to Paul’s surprise, as he had only seen a daughter in his visions), she dies. Paul has to overcome his grief to protect his children, who are threatened by an agent of the Spice Merchants, a group that believes he has too much power. A deal that sets the universe on a different path than expected leaves Paul completely blind, but he uses the eyes of his son, who will become Leto II Atreides, to kill the betrayer. Now fully blind, he goes off alone into the desert as Fremen tradition decrees, leaving his younger sister Alia as regent to the twins and leader of the Empire.\n\nWhat happens to Paul in Children of Dune?\n\nIn Children of Dune, a man known as “The Preacher” appears, speaking against the Empire and the way its practices are changing the planet and its people. He stirs up trouble speaking of the horrors committed by the government, which is being led by a possessed Alia, whose grandfather, Baron Harkonnen, has taken over her body. When an attack on the twins causes Leto to flee into the desert, he meets The Preacher in an abandoned Fremen Sietch and discovers that this man is indeed his father. But when Paul returns to the capital to help Leto to take his rightful place, he is brutally murdered by agents of the crown—who, as listeners know, are really working for the ghost of Vladimir Harkonnen. Leto goes on to take over the Empire and Alia takes her own life to ensure Harkonnen does not return. Thus concludes the life of Paul Muad’Dib Atreides as a living human in the Dune Saga.\n\nWhat happens to Paul after Children of Dune?\n\nLeto has enormous power and goes on to live for thousands of years, eventually turning into a sandworm, known as Shai Hulud Sandworm King. Using his own Kwisatz Haderach-like abilities to access the memories of his ancestors, he often calls upon the memory-self of Paul to provide guidance and companionship during his extensive life. During Children of Dune, Leto uses this power to call upon Paul’s Voice—a Bene Gesserit trick of persuasion—to keep Chani from possessing his sister, Ghanima.\n\nIn Hunters of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, Paul and Chani are brought back as gholas 5,000 years in the future. Though been brought back as part of a plot to take over the universe, even an unawakened Paul will not be twisted in such a way. He takes an overdose of spice and gains his namesake’s prescience, becoming awakened. He sees a vision of himself being attacked by an evil version of himself, who, it turns out, is an unawakened ghola named Paolo. In Sandworms of Dune, it is revealed that dark forces plan to use the power of the Kwisatz Haderach to take over the universe. As such, Paul and Paolo must fight for domination. A battle ensues, but by the epilogue, Paul and Chani, now awakened, go back to the ways of the Fremen of their time and finally find the happy ever after they deserve.\n\nWhat names are Paul Atreides known by?\n\nOver the course of the Dune Saga, Paul Atreides is known by the following titles: Duke of Arrakis, the Kwisatz Haderach, Paul Muad’Dib, Muad’Dib, Emperor Paul Atreides, The Preacher, and simply, Paul.\n\nPaul begins the Dune Saga with just one name—Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides and his concubine, Jessica. After his father dies, Paul claims his position and title as Duke of Arrakis, drawing the Fremen to his cause. When he first joins the Fremen after fleeing the Atreides palace, he takes on the name Muad’Dib. Stilgar gives him the name Usul, to be used solely by the people closest to him in the Fremen community. In some situations, he is referred to as Paul Muad’Dib, but as his following as a prophet grows, it is often shortened solely to Muad’Dib. And of course, after the abdication of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, he becomes Emperor Paul Atreides. After he disappears at the end of Dune Messiah, he appears in Children of Dune as The Preacher. And it’s only when he’s an awakened ghola in Sandworms of Dune that he is once again known as Paul.\n\nWho are Paul Atreides’s allies and enemies?\n\nLady Jessica Atreides is Paul’s mother. She was raised in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, and trains Paul in their powerful, mystic ways.\n\nDuke Leto Atreides is Paul’s father. He serves as a role model to Paul, a noble man who tries to do what is right.\n\nGurney Halleck is an advisor and mentor to Paul. He is his instructor in martial arts and other practices, but eventually, Gurney will come to betray Atreides.\n\nDuncan Idaho is a friend and mentor to Paul. He is killed but later brought back as a ghola.\n\nStilgar is the leader of the Fremen group that takes in Lady Jessica and Paul. He too becomes a friend and advisor to Paul.\n\nChani Kynes is a Fremen warrior woman who first appears in Paul’s dreams. Over time, Chani becomes his close friend and romantic companion, as well as the mother to three of his children, two of whom live to adulthood.\n\nAlia Atreides is Paul’s sister. She is born after Jessica partakes of the waters of life and possesses many mystical abilities.\n\nBaron Vladimir Harkonnen is the leader of the blood rivals of House Atreides. He is also the father of Lady Jessica and therefore Paul’s maternal grandfather.\n\nFeyd-Rautha is the nephew of Baron Harkonnen. He is the chosen champion of House Harkonnen in one-on-one combat with Paul.\n\nPrincess Irulan is the daughter of the Padishah Emperor and eventual wife to Paul. She writes The History of Muad'Dib, a text that is quoted in various Dune books. She is also trained in the Bene Gesserit ways.\n\nEmperor Shaddam IV is the leader of the Padishah Empire and House Corrino. He is an ally to Baron Harkonnen and defeated challenger of Paul Atreides.\n\nGhanima Atreides is the daughter of Paul and Chani. She is the sister of Leto II.\n\nLeto II Atreides is the son of Paul and Chani. He is the inheritor of the Empire and possessor of the same Kwisatz Haderach powers.\n\nHow is Paul Atreides portrayed on screen?\n\nInstallments of the Dune Saga have been adapted for the screen three times—first in 1984 in David Lynch’s feature film Dune; then in 2000 and 2003 with the SyFy Channel’s Frank Herbert’s Dune and Frank Herbert’s Children of Dune; and finally in 2021 with Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One and in March 2024 with Dune: Part Two. The first person to portray Paul Atreides was Kyle McLaughlin, followed by Alec Newman in both Frank Herbert’s Dune and Frank Herbert’s Children of Dune, and Timothée Chalamet in Villeneuve’s ongoing series. The Paul portrayed by both McLaughlin and Chalamet are both slight and dark haired, while Alec Newman’s has light hair and eyes. Notably, while many elements of the SyFy series stay accurate to the books, Paul is indeed described as having dark hair and eyes—at least until he drinks from the waters of life and his eyes become Fremen blue.\n\nMemorable Paul Atreides quotes"
