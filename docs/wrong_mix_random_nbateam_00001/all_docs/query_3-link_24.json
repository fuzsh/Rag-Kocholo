        "text": "Multiverses are a distinct possibility in Dune. From Chapterhouse, we have Bellonda talking about the Golden path. She says this:\n\n\"These speculations are useless,\" Bellonda muttered. \"We don't even know if Foldspace introduces us to one universe or many... or even an infinite number of expanding and collapsing bubbles.\"\n\nSo it may be that there are other parallel universes and realities. Nobody in Dune appears to know.\n\nHowever I think that when they say \"other universes\" they mean other empires. As in the planets that the Tleilaxu control being the \"Tleilaxu universe\". From Heretics of Dune:\n\nTaraza's communication burned in Odrade's awareness: \"The Tleilaxu plan is transparent: Ascendancy. The human universe must be made into a Tleilaxu universe.\n\nSo maybe universe is occasionally just a shorthand for saying \"everything group X controls\"."
