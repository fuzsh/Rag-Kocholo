        "text": "Need more spice from the fascinating universe of Dune after watching Dune: Part Two once or twice (or more) in IMAX? Well, you're in luck, as Warner Bros. Discovery and Legendary are bringing a Dune television series to stream later this year. Here's everything we know so far about Dune: Prophecy.\n\nFollowing the success of massive sci-fi series like For All Mankind and Foundation, you might be looking desperately for the next big thing in that space. Since FX's upcoming Alien TV series is further away than we'd like, Dune: Prophecy seems like the next best bet for fans of hard science fiction.\n\nNow is the perfect time to get into all things Dune, whether that means reading through Frank Herbert's novels, rewatching David Lynch's divisive movie, or playing one of the many Dune board games available at the moment. Moreover, Dune: Awakening could be the MMO that fans of this universe were waiting for.\n\nFall 2024\n\nThe \"late 2024\" window was announced by HBO and Max themselves in November 2023. While there's no specific release date set for Dune: Prophecy right now, it shouldn't be long before we find out so watch this space!\n\nWith House of the Dragon (the platform's other huge 2024 show) slated to drop in June, Max will probably want to give this show some room to breath before they release their next big hit. Plus, chatter from the Warner Bros. Discovery bosses has only further confirmed we should be looking at the later months of 2024 for Dune's return to screens.\n\nWhere to stream Dune: Prophecy?\n\nDune: Prophecy will stream exclusively on Max when it arrives in late 2024. Whether Warner Bros. Discovery will explore other watch options (or even a physical release) for the long-anticipated series remains to be seen, but we wouldn't count on alternatives during its initial streaming run.\n\nTo scratch that Dune itch in the meantime, check out our Dune streaming guide.\n\nDune: Prophecy trailers\n\nWe've just had our short teaser trailer for Dune: Prophecy drop on May 15th. The trailer gives the basic premise of the show and showcases the cast, and flashy effects that we'll be getting in the show.\n\nAs we approach the late spring and early summer season, we could be getting a more in-depth look at the series, though we're expecting Max's marketing efforts to firmly focus on House of the Dragon for the next few months.\n\nWhat is the plot of Dune: Prophecy?\n\nPlot details are being kept tightly under wraps. What we do know is that Dune: Prophecy (previously titled Dune: The Sisterhood) is set in the same continuity as Denis Villeneuve's movies and takes place roughly 10,000 years before the ascension of Paul Atreides. This'll give showrunner Alison Schapker and the writing team enough room to give the series a distinct voice and style that complements the movies, whilst still standing on its own.\n\nLike the original title suggested, the show reportedly follows the Harkonnen Sisters as they \"combat the forces that threaten the future of humankind\" and establish the long-lasting, all-female sect known as the Bene Gesserit. But, of course, political intrigue and events larger than any of them will unfold before they can gain complete control over humankind's destiny – we're expecting a sort of \"Game of Thrones in space\" vibe, which sounds awesome if the creative team can pull it off.\n\nThe recent title change to Dune: Prophecy suggests the overall story might be sticking closer to Villeneuve's movies following their big success (and ex-director Johan Renck confirmed as much). However, we shouldn't forget that the plot still takes place thousands of years prior to the events that reshape Arrakis and the Corrino Imperium, so it's a bit unreasonable to expect more than small connections and some foreshadowing here and there.\n\nDune: Prophecy cast\n\nDune: Prophecy's stellar cast highlights that this is a huge bet for Warner Bros. and Legendary. Aimed at both fans of the series and prestige T.V. lovers, viewers can look forward to seeing:\n\nEmily Watson as Valya Harkonnen\n\nOlivia Williams (previously Shirley Henderson) as Tula Harkonnen\n\nMark Strong as Emperor Javicco Corrino\n\nTravis Fimmel as Desmond Hart\n\nJodhi May (previously Indira Varma) as Natalya\n\nCamilla Beeput as Reverend Mother Dorotea\n\nSarah Lam as Hagal Truthsayer\n\nSarah-Sofie Boussnina as Princess Ynez\n\nJosh Heuston as Constantine\n\nChloe Lea as Lila\n\nJade Anouka as Sister Theodosia\n\nFaoileann Cunningham as Sister Jen\n\nAoife Hinds as Sister Emeline\n\nChris Mason as Keiran Atreides\n\nShalom Brune-Franklin as Mikaela\n\nFlora Montgomery as Truthsayer Vera\n\nTessa Bonham Jones as Lady Shannon\n\nLaura Howard as Orla Richese\n\nDune: Prophecy director, writers, & crew\n\nDune: Prophecy faced some creative shake-ups last year, before and during the writers and actors strikes. Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, both co-writers on the Dune movies, were originally part of the creative team for Dune: Prophecy, but had to step away to focus on the big-screen adaptations. However, some of their DNA and creative direction might still be found in the final series, especially as Warner Bros. and Legendary have chosen to follow the path marked by Dune: Part One and Two.\n\nCreator, co-showrunner, and pilot writer Diane Ademu-John (The Haunting of Bly Manor) was replaced by Alison Schapker (Westworld) as solo showrunner in 2023, though the former's writing was reportedly kept around and used during production. Likewise, Johan Renck (Chernobyl) departed following the creative changes and was replaced by Anna Foerster (Outlander) as the director of at least three episodes. There are reports that Westworld veteran Richard J. Lewis and John Cameron (Legion) are also part of the final directing team.\n\nBesides Diane Ademu John, we don't know much about the scribes that worked on the final version of Dune: Prophecy, though there are reports of Jordan Goldberg (also of Westworld fame) being involved in some capacity. Of course, material is being drawn from Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's 2012 novel Sisterhood of Dune. As for the music, Oscar-winner (for 2022’s All Quiet on the Western Front) Volker Bertelmann (aka Hauschka) will follow in Hans Zimmer's footsteps."
