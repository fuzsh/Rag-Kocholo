        "text": "Allow me to start by saying thank you for staying with me even when it has been a little while since my last post. Life has been a bit busy! A few months back my wife and I welcomed our beautifully amazing daughter into our lives and I also started a new position at work. Both of these life changing events have reduced my reading and writing time, but both have also been very rewarding. One day I‚Äôll post more on being a father but today I can say there is nothing more amazing that holding your child in your hands. It is as if you are holding your heart in your hands. Simply amazing. But this post is about books isn‚Äôt it? On to the post!\n\nOnce upon a time when I was a young lad with a library card I discovered a few authors who managed to capture my attention and fire up my imagination! Robert Jordan was one such author. Wheel Of Time has just reached its fifth volume (The Fires Of Heaven) and I devoured the series! I read through the first five books three times before book six had a chance to be published and then with each new release I would reread the entire series. I loved it. I discovered friends in the pages of those books that I identified with more than I did the people around me. As a result those first five books are intensely special to me and I‚Äôll forever be thankful to Robert Jordan for them.\n\nAround that same time I also discovered an author by the name of Tad Williams and I leapt into his Memory Sorrow And Thorn trilogy! I was young so I thought I identified with young Seoman Snowlock and I sadly rushed through the trilogy trying to get past all the other bits to enjoy the adventures of Seoman. I loved the story, and I know I appreciated it at the time in my limited way, but just this past year I returned to Osten Ard (the land the books are set in) with a reread of the trilogy. My first time returning to those books in about 25 years! What did I discover? Beauty. This trilogy is a beautiful work of marvelous art and I can‚Äôt sing its praises enough! I truly identify with the side characters. The ones whose stories I couldn‚Äôt get past quickly enough to get back to what I thought was the main story. Now I see the beauty in their inner struggles and understand how very human they are and how amazing of a work Tad Williams created.\n\nYou never know what treasures you might find when you open a book, even if you‚Äôve read that book before! Rereading Dune Messiah gave me a deeper appreciation for Frank Herbert because when you realize just how much he packed into this tiny book you are amazed! Such a short work yet so powerful!\n\nThose are my bookish musings for the moment. I wanted to say hi to everyone and to continue our conversations on books! I intend to be a little more present here but I know you‚Äôll understand if the posts aren‚Äôt as frequent as we‚Äôd all like. However I do intend to announce something here soon so do keep checking RedStarReviews for some fun upcoming news! üòä I appreciate you all so much!\n\nAs y‚Äôall already surely know if you‚Äôve been following me for any amount of time: January is always Vintage SciFi Month and this January‚Äôs reading was incredible! Let‚Äôs take a look at the three books I read this year.\n\nTactics Of Mistake by Gordon R Dickson is the fourth book of The Childe Cycle which I‚Äôm working my way through bit by bit each January. While it isn‚Äôt the best book in the series it is really good! It is a strong addition to an excellent series. If you‚Äôve read Dorsai and wanted to know how the Dorsai became the most badass soldiers in the known universe then this is the book for you! If you‚Äôve never wondered that but you still enjoy Military SciFi combined with Vintage Philosophy then this is still the book for you!\n\nUp next was Philip K Dick‚Äôs classic of SciFi: Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep and it was an excellent story! I watched Blade Runner as a kid but I had never made time for the story it was based upon. I am glad I finally did! It was a very subtle story with a slow burn that once lit wouldn‚Äôt go out. Very enjoyable and easy to lose yourself in the story.\n\nThis January close to fifty people joined me for the #ReadDune Group Read, several of them reading Frank Herbert‚Äôs Dune for the first time! The good news is that almost everyone loved it! I mean how could you not love this book? This was either my fourth or fifth time to read it and I enjoyed it yet again! Getting to see everyone‚Äôs reaction to it was so much fun. Dune will always be special to me and I‚Äôm happy to report that it gets better with each reread!\n\nI hope to see y‚Äôall join in on Vintage SciFi Month next January!\n\nWe recently announced the #ReadDune Group Read and now that we‚Äôre only a week away from starting we wanted to share the weekly target reading goals! This is a little tricky as there are so many different editions and each has its own page count. So it makes sense to do this by chapter, right? Right! Only‚Ä¶ Frank Herbert didn‚Äôt number or name his damn chapters! The NERVE of that author! üòÇ\n\nSo everyone will need to keep count of the chapters they‚Äôve read because we‚Äôre going to read a certain number each week. As this can get tricky we have another visual aide: each chapter starts with a section from fictitious history books and we‚Äôll watch for specific chapter openings! This will (hopefully) work!\n\nJanuary week one we will read chapters one through fifteen and stop at the start of chapter sixteen you see pictured here! When you read ‚ÄúGreatness is a transitory experience.‚Äù you will have reached stopping point one. Everyone should be here by Saturday January the sixth. Next stopping point:\n\nWe will read chapters sixteen through the end of twenty-six and stop at the start of twenty-seven when you read: ‚ÄúAt the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.‚Äù This will be the stopping point on Saturday January the 13th. The next stopping point is fun:\n\nThat‚Äôs right! We stop at Book Three The Prophet! Frank Herbert came through for us on this split! Everyone should strive to be at The Prophet by Saturday January the twentieth.\n\nThe last week we shall read to the end of the story. With this pace we will all finish on Saturday January the twenty-seventh and then we‚Äôll all hit play on the cheesy 80‚Äôs film adaptation and enjoy!\n\nRead at your own pace but be aware that the conversations will include possible spoilers once we hit a Saturday goal as discussing anything from the week‚Äôs reading is fair game on a Saturday and beyond. Above all else please have fun!\n\nOfficially announcing the #ReadDune GroupRead I‚Äôll be hosting for #VintageSciFiMonth this January!\n\nWe‚Äôll be using the #ReadDune hashtag to help keep track and follow along of each other‚Äôs posts and be able to enjoy more discussions on it! So break out your copies of Dune by Frank Herbert and let‚Äôs start spreading the word!\n\nFor those new to how I handle GroupReads here are some details:\n\nEach week we have a target page/location goal in the book. We don‚Äôt discuss in detail anything that takes place in the book until we reach that Saturday Goal, and then we discuss only the sections we‚Äôve read so far. You‚Äôll find it works really well. The Group DMs are normally very fun and respectful, and allow for discussing shared emotional reactions, general observations, and encouragement to reach the goal. Once we‚Äôve reached a goal we discuss things that happened in detail and have fun with it. If anyone hasn‚Äôt reached the goal they‚Äôll need to be careful about the Group DMs on the weekends as that‚Äôs when a lot of specifics get discussed. I‚Äôll be looking into the page counts of the common versions but it‚Äôll probably be between 130-150 pages a week of reading.\n\nWhat are Group DMs? Everyone who wants to participate will be invited into a group DM on Instagram or on Twitter (whichever social network you prefer). There‚Äôs a limit on how many can join so there‚Äôll be a few group DMs created. I‚Äôll be in each one to help moderate and help keep spoilers to a minimum. We‚Äôve got several first time readers joining in so everyone needs to be conscious about posting spoilers! That‚Äôs where the page goals will come in to play.\n\nSince we tend to have more than one Group DM I‚Äôll also post a #ReadDune Instagram post and Twitter Post every Saturday Morning so that everyone can publicly discuss the book (up to that page goal) with everyone else easily.\n\nReady for the cheesy fun part? At the end of it all on either Saturday the 27th or Sunday the 28th depending on people‚Äôs schedules we‚Äôll all hit play at the same time on the fun and cheesy 80‚Äôs movie edition of Dune and have fun watching the movie together to celebrate finishing the book!\n\nPosting photos of your reading of Dune is highly encouraged! Please post away and use the #ReadDune hashtag and we‚Äôd love if you used the #VintageSciFiMonth hashtag too! Above all have fun! This is one of my favorite books, and I think it has a broad appeal. I‚Äôm hopeful you‚Äôll like it, but there is no pressure to like it! If you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs really ok as I‚Äôm not the author, just a fan.\n\nLet me know on Twitter or on Instagram if you‚Äôll be joining in! Check out my latest post on Instagram or my pinned tweet on Twitter to respond and let me know if you‚Äôre joining!\n\nAnnouncing the first ever giveaway for Vintage SciFi Month!

Sorry international readers!\n\nWe are so excited to be able to host this giveaway and this wonderful month of reading! Thank you all for joining in! Now let‚Äôs start reading, posting, and talking about all of those amazing Vintage SciFi Books! üöÄüí´\n\nThis past February I decided to clean up my currently reading list. The goal was to finish the books I had started in 2015. It was a great goal yet it was a little ambitious for such a short month. So now I‚Äôve decided to try something different and set December aside as the month to attack my currently reading stack!\n\nThis means I‚Äôll attempt to work through these seven books in December! I fully expect to fall short and probably to start reading an extra book or two alongside these seven, but it‚Äôs nice to have goals! I figure that with December being such a busy month it is a better time to try and finish books I‚Äôve already started rather than start new books. We‚Äôll see how it goes!\n\nBetrayer by Aaron Dembski-Bowden is the 24th book of the ongoing Horus Heresy series I love so much. Always good to have some GrimDark Military SciFi on hand!\n\nThe Worlds Of Frank Herbert is a short story collection from the master of SciFi and a good way to prepare me for January‚Äôs Vintage SciFi Month!\n\nAwakenings by Edward Lazellari is an Urban Fantasy that is starting off in a very kick ass grab your attention fashion.\n\nGene Wolfe‚Äôs Book Of The New Sun series is a masterpiece of SciFi and I‚Äôm loving it. The goal is to complete the second book The Claw Of The Conciliator.\n\nGail Z Martin‚Äôs War Of Shadows is the third book of her awesome Ascendent Kingdoms saga. Post magic apocalypitic fantasy? With good characters? Easy to enjoy!\n\nThese last two are the long reads that I doubt I‚Äôll complete in December and expect to be reading into 2017.\n\nBloodheir by Brian Ruckley is the second book of The Godless World trilogy and I couldn‚Äôt keep myself from starting it after I finished Winterbirth.\n\nHouse Of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewski is off to a creepy start and I know this one will take me a while.\n\nSo that‚Äôs my December Reading Plans! Finishing up 2016 and getting ready for new reads in 2017!\n\nWhen you hear the name of Frank Herbert you instantly think Dune, and rightly so! Dune is a masterpiece and is extremely influential in a way that most authors can only dream of. However if you stop at Dune you do yourself an injustice as Frank Herbert wrote several other amazing works.\n\nFrank Herbert wrote the ConSentient Series consisting of Whipping Star and The Dosadi Experiment along with a couple of short stories. This series never gained the fame or acclaim of his Dune Saga, but it is an incredible work nonetheless.\n\nWhipping Star is a strange name for a novel but soon after starting this book you realize it makes sense! This book is more dialogue and philosophy than action, but Herbert demonstrates his ability to weave action into his dialogue. This book (and the overall series) examines morality, justice, law, and truth. In this story we are face to face with an intelligence much greater and more ancient than our own. You are left asking what is the value of life when viewed through an ancient lense. What is it when viewed through a personal viewpoint? What is the value of all life in the galaxy? This story involves a lot of thinking and reasoning on the part of the reader, and I loved it. Very well executed.\n\nThe Dosadi Experiment is gripping and fast paced, but again it hides its action within the dialogue. In this we examine evolution (a common theme in FH‚Äôs works) and not only how environment can cause evolutionary change, but also the proximity of alien life can drastically alter how a species evolves. The stakes in this novel are high and the tension is constant from start to finish. An amazing work of art.\n\nI‚Äôm writing this because a few years back I decided to branch out into the writings of Frank Herbert, to go further than his Dune Saga. I‚Äôve been thankful for that choice and I‚Äôll be sharing more on his other writings over time. I hope these posts encourage you to seek out his other works and join me in exploring them!"
