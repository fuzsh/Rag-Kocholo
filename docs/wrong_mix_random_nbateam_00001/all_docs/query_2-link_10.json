You might think this is a description of the original Star Wars film, but these plot points belong to a different work altogether.\n\nFrank Herbert’s Dune was published in 1965 and is widely regarded as a masterpiece of the science fiction genre. Herbert (Oct 8, 1920-February 11, 1986) was a visionary author who also published many other novels and short stories within the science fiction genre.\n\nA former journalist, Herbert’s vision of a desert planet began when he was researching the formation of sand dunes in Oregon and took shape when Herbert began including complex social, political, and religious concepts. Herbert would write five sequels to the original Dune influencing a generation of science fiction creators including George Lucas with Star Wars.The Dune Saga would see a rebirth under Herbert’s son, Brian, who would expand the Dune mythos with a series of prequels and original novels in collaboration with noted science fiction author Kevin Anderson.\n\nWhether you are an experienced Herbert reader or if you’re new to the writer, here is a list of must-read and must-see works:\n\nReccomended Reading and Viewing"
