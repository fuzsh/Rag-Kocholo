        "text": "Frank Herbert’s science fiction masterpiece, Dune, first published in 1965, is a monumental work in the genre, captivating readers over the years with its intricate plot, richly imagined universe, and profound themes. At least, it captured my imagination when I first read it, back when I was in Seattle, growing up under the flightpath of the planes zooming overhead.\n\nOne of the lesser-known but perhaps most significant influence on Herbert’s sci-fi world is the North African country of Morocco. While specific dates of his time in Morocco are not widely documented, it is known that Herbert visited the country in the early 1960s as part of his research and exploration for a project that became Dune. During this period, Herbert immersed himself in Moroccan culture, landscapes, and society, gathering inspiration that would later manifest in the intricate world-building and thematic depth of Dune.\n\nThe influence of Morocco’s culture, geography, and history is perhaps best seen through Herbert’s planet Arrakis, the central planet involved in his Dune trilogy. An argument can be made that not only did Herbert’s time in the Moroccan Sahara enrich the Dune world in terms of narrative and adding layers of depth to its fictional universe, but that without the success of Dune, at the risk of being too sci-fi nerdy, we might not have had Tatooine, the desert world of Star Wars (1979), also greatly influenced by Saharan culture.\n\nBut I digress… as it is, Herbert vividly describes Arrakis as a harsh and unforgiving environment, where water is scarce, and life is adapted to extreme conditions. The imagery of vast desert expanses, towering sand dunes, and fierce sandstorms in Dune echoes Herbert’s experiences of the Moroccan Sahara, where he witnessed the raw power and beauty of desert landscapes.\n\nThe Influence of Morocco on Dune: Culture, Politics and Religion\n\nFrank Herbert’s journey to Morocco was not merely a physical voyage but also a profound exploration of cultural diversity, environmental dynamics, and political intricacies. Immersing himself in the complexity of Moroccan life, Herbert encountered a society deeply rooted in traditions yet dynamically evolving amidst modernization and globalization. The sights, sounds, and scents of Moroccan cities, bustling markets, desert landscapes, and ancient ruins couldn’t help but to awaken Herbert’s senses and stimulate his creative faculties.\n\nMorocco’s cultural is an amalgamation of Berber, Arab, and African traditions, infused with centuries of history and influenced by diverse civilizations. This cultural mosaic finds echoes in the world of “Dune,” where Herbert masterfully weaves together various cultural elements to create the fictional universe of Arrakis and its inhabitants, the Fremen.\n\n“The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o’-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate.”\n\nFrank Herbert, Dune\n\nOne of the most striking parallels between Morocco and Dune is the portrayal of desert cultures. The harsh yet captivating landscapes of the Sahara Desert, with its vast dunes and arid expanses, bear a resemblance to the desert planet of Arrakis. Herbert’s descriptions of Arrakis, its nomadic tribes, and their struggle for survival evoke images of the Berber nomads, known for their resilience and adaptability in the face of harsh desert conditions. It’s no coincidence that Herbert borrows the Moroccan terms of ¨caïd” and “bashar” — both official titles of government authorities in Morocco — to add textual nuance, to harken directly back to his time in Morocco and the politics, factions, and people he met in his travels.\n\nAnd is it only coincidence that the name Herbert gives the people of Arrakis, “Fremen,” is the very meaning of the Amazigh, the Berbers of Morocco?\n\nMoreover, Morocco’s rich tradition of storytelling and oral literature (check out Richard Hamilton’s The Last Storyteller!) finds expression in Dune through its intricate mythology and folklore. The Fremen’s deep reverence for water, their oral traditions, and the mystical aura surrounding the planet’s indigenous culture mirror aspects of Moroccan folklore, where stories of djinns, desert spirits, and heroic legends abound.\n\nFurthermore, Morocco’s Islamic heritage permeates Dune, as seen in the spiritual practices and religious symbolism embedded within the narrative. The Fremen’s religious fervor, centered around the concept of the “Lisan al-Gaib” or “Voice from the Outer World,” draws parallels to Sufi mysticism and Islamic eschatology, reflecting Herbert’s fascination with religious themes and his exploration of messianic narratives.\n\nThe Influence of Morocco on Dune: Geography and History\n\nMorocco’s diverse geography, ranging from rugged mountains to sprawling deserts, serves as a backdrop for Dune’s epic saga of politics, power, and ecology. The towering Atlas Mountains, with their snow-capped peaks and rocky terrain, find echoes in the Shield Wall of Arrakis, a massive mountain range that serves as a natural barrier against the encroaching desert.\n\nLikewise, Morocco’s coastal regions, with their bustling ports and ancient cities, provide inspiration for the cosmopolitan city of Arrakeen, the capital of Arrakis. Herbert’s descriptions of Arrakeen’s bustling markets, labyrinthine streets, and diverse population evoke the sensory overload of Moroccan medinas, such as Marrakesh and Fez, where vibrant colors, exotic scents, and the clamor of street vendors are the norm. Furthermore, Morocco’s unique ecosystem, characterized by oases, date palm groves, and desert flora and fauna, serves as a model for the ecological intricacies of Arrakis. The desert planet’s intricate web of life, centered around the giant sandworms and the precious spice melange, reflects Herbert’s ecological concerns and his exploration of humanity’s relationship with the natural world.\n\nMorocco’s rich history, marked by centuries of conquest, trade, and cultural exchange, has left a lasting imprint on Dune, shaping its political landscape and narrative dynamics. The legacy of ancient empires such as the Carthaginians, Romans, and Arabs finds resonance in the complex geopolitics of Herbert’s universe, where powerful noble houses vie for control of the spice trade and influence the fate of entire planets.\n\nMoreover, Morocco’s status as a crossroads of civilizations, bridging the gap between Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, mirrors the cosmopolitan nature of the Imperium in Dune. Just take a look at the all of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites that bear this out!. Just as Morocco served as a hub for trade and cultural exchange along the ancient caravan routes, so too does Arrakis occupy a pivotal role in the interstellar economy, its spice melange coveted by powers across the galaxy.\n\nAdditionally, Morocco’s history of resistance against colonial powers, particularly during the era of European imperialism, resonates with the themes of rebellion and liberation in Dune. The Fremen’s struggle against the oppressive rule of the Harkonnens and their quest for freedom and self-determination parallel Morocco’s own fight for independence and sovereignty.\n\nBy drawing inspiration from Morocco’s rich heritage, Frank Herbert enriched his fictional universe with depth, authenticity, and a sense of wonder, inviting readers on an epic journey through the sands of Arrakis and the corridors of the human imagination.\n\nAs we delve deeper into the world of Dune, we discover not only a compelling work of science fiction but also an homage to the enduring legacy of Morocco’s cultural influence.\n\n… but maybe that’s just me? What do you think? Have you read any of the Herbert’s Dune books or seen the latest movie adaptations? Have you visited Morocco?\n\n“Dreams make good stories. But everything important happens when we’re awake.Because that’s when we make things happen.”\n\nFrank Herbert, Dune\n\nI’ll see you awake, breathing dreams to life, in Morocco!"
