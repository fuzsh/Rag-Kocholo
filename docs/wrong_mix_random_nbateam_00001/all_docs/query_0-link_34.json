        "text": "\"To the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.\"\n\n―Frank Herbert\n\nDune is a science fiction novel written by Frank Herbert and published in 1965. A winner of the Hugo Award and Nebula Award for outstanding science fiction, Dune is popularly considered one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time, and is frequently cited as the best-selling science fiction novel in history. Dune spawned five sequels written by Herbert, and inspired a film adaptation by David Lynch, two miniseries made by the United States-based Sci-Fi Channel, computer games, another adaptation by Denis Villeneuve (Part One released in 2021, Part Two in 2024) as well as a series of prequels, interquels, and sequels co-written by Brian Herbert, the author's son, and Kevin J. Anderson.\n\nDune is set far in the future, amidst a sprawling feudal intergalactic empire, where planetary fiefdoms are controlled by Noble Houses that owe allegiance to the Imperial House Corrino. The novel tells the story of young Paul Atreides, heir apparent to Duke Leto Atreides I and scion of House Atreides, as he and his family relocate to the planet Arrakis, the universe's only source of the spice melange. In a story that explores the complex interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, the fate of Paul, his family, his new planet and its native inhabitants, as well as the Padishah Emperor, the powerful Spacing Guild, and the secretive female order of the Bene Gesserit, are all drawn together into a confrontation that will change the course of humanity.\n\nThe novel was originally serialised in the magazine, Analog, from 1963 to 1965 as two shorter works: Dune World and The Prophet of Dune.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nPolitical backdrop of Dune[]\n\nOpening twenty-thousand years into the future, the human race has scattered throughout the galaxy, populating multiple planets ruled by aristocratic Houses who themselves answer to the galaxy's Imperial family House Corrino. Key is the control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the valuable spice melange, which gives those who ingest it extended life and prescient awareness. Melange is crucial as it enables space travel, which in turn is monopolized by the Spacing Guild; its Navigators use the spice to safely plot a course for the Guild ships via prescience using \"foldspace\" technology, which allows instantaneous travel to anywhere in the galaxy.\n\nTen thousand years before the beginning of the story, the human race had purged all machines that had replicated many of the functions of the human mind. This event, known as the Butlerian Jihad, resulted in the destruction of all the robots, computers, “thinking machines,” and - significantly - the computer navigator. Subsequently, it was necessary to replace spaceship computers with the spice-addicted Guild Navigators to allow ships to travel safely through space. The functions of the logical computers were replaced by the Mentats, humans who, through intensive training, learned to enter a heightened mental state in which they could perform complex logical computations.\n\nThe spice is also crucial to the powerful matriarchal order called the Bene Gesserit. The secretive Bene Gesserit, often referred to as \"witches\", possess mental and physical powers developed through a combination of thousands of generations of genetic selection and years of physical and mental conditioning. When a Bene Gesserit acolyte becomes a full Reverend Mother by undergoing a massive overdose of specific narcotics (called \"The Agony\"), she gains access to her \"ancestral memories\" — the complete life experiences of all her female ancestors back to the point of conception. Only women have been able to survive the transformation. However, the Bene Gesserit have a secret, centuries-old breeding program to create a prescient superhuman — and male equivalent of a Reverend Mother — called the Kwisatz Haderach, who would not only be able to survive The Agony, but whose “organic mental powers would bridge space and time”.\n\nThe planet Arrakis itself is completely covered in a desert ecosystem, hostile to most organic life. It is also sparsely settled by a human population of native Fremen tribes. Tribal leaders are selected by defeating the former leader in combat. The Fremen also have complex rituals and systems focusing on the value and conservation of water on their arid planet. They conserve the water distilled from their dead, consider spitting an honorable greeting, and value tears as the greatest gift one can give to the dead. Their culture also revolves around the spice, which is created as part of the life cycle of the giant sandworms who dominate the deserts. Bene Gesserit missionary efforts have implanted a belief in a male Messiah who will one day come and transform Arrakis into a world more hospitable to humans.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nPadishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV has come to fear House Atreides, partly due to the growing popularity of Duke Leto Atreides I and also because the talent of Leto's fighting force is beginning to rival the effectiveness of the Emperor's own dreaded Imperial Sardaukar guard. Shaddam decides that House Atreides must be destroyed, but cannot risk an attack on a single House, which would, by necessity, unite the other Houses against him. The Emperor instead uses the centuries-old feud between House Atreides and House Harkonnen to disguise his assault, enlisting the brilliant and power-hungry Baron Vladimir Harkonnen in his plan to trap and eliminate the Atreides. Shaddam forces Leto to accept the lucrative fief of the desert planet Arrakis, the only known source of the spice melange, previously controlled by the Harkonnens. Enter into this conflict the Bene Gesserit. Their ancient breeding program, now only one generation from completion, has suddenly become horribly jeopardized: They had planned to breed an Atreides daughter with a Harkonnen son to unite the two bloodlines and produce their long-awaited superbeing, the Kwisatz Haderach. However fate would decide otherwise and instead of bearing a daughter, the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica (the Duke’s Concubine) fulfilled her beloved Duke's wishes for a son and bore Paul.\n\nShortly after arriving on Arrakis, the Atreides are unable to withstand a devastating Harkonnen attack, supported by Imperial Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnen troops. Betrayed by Dr. Yueh, Duke Leto dies in a failed attempt to assassinate Baron Harkonnen; Paul and Jessica escape into the deep desert, their exit from the city guaranteed by Yueh himself. They manage to join a band of Fremen, ferocious fighters who ride the giant sandworms of Arrakis and can survive in the hostile desert environment of the planet. Paul and his mother quickly learn the ways of the Fremen, while teaching them the Bene Gesserit methods, particularly their style of combat. Paul leads armies of Fremen in a guerilla campaign, nearly halting spice mining on Arrakis.\n\nJessica becomes a Reverend Mother, taking the Water of Life, poison derived from juvenile sandworms, while pregnant with her Duke’s second child. Her daughter Alia experiences all that her mother does from the poison, gaining wisdom even prior to her birth. Living on the spice diet of the Fremen, Paul's prescience increases dramatically, enabling him to foresee future events and gaining him a religious respect from the Fremen, who regard him as their prophesied Messiah. As Paul grows in influence, he begins to plot revenge against the Harkonnen rule of the planet under his new Fremen name, Muad'Dib.\n\nDisturbed by his lack of complete prescience Paul decides to take the Water of Life, an act that could kill him. After three weeks in a near-death state, Paul emerges as the Kwisatz Haderach, with the power to see both the past, the present and the future clearly. Looking into space, he sees that the Emperor and the Harkonnens have amassed a huge armada to invade the planet and regain control. Paul also discovers the way to control spice production on Arrakis. Alia is captured by Sardaukar and brought to the planet's capital Arrakeen by the Emperor himself. At that moment, under cover of a gigantic sandstorm, Paul and his army of Fremen attack the city. Alia kills the Baron with a poisoned needle during the confusion. Paul quickly overcomes the city's defenses and confronts the Emperor, threatening to destroy the spice and thereby effectively end space travel and cripple both the Imperial power and Bene Gesserit in one shot. Realizing that Paul is capable of doing all he has threatened, the Emperor is forced to abdicate and to promise his daughter in marriage to Paul. Paul ascends the throne, his control of Arrakis and the spice establishing a new kind of power over the Empire which will change the face of the known universe.\n\nDetailed Plot Summary[]\n\nThe central figure of the book is Paul, son and heir presumptive to Duke Leto Atreides, head of the House Atreides, and Leto's concubine, Jessica, a Bene Gesserit. The Bene Gesserit perform many functions in the Empire, as Truthsayers (human lie detectors), negotiators, advisors, and teachers, but all these functions serve one deeper purpose: for at least ten thousand years, they have been selectively breeding humans trying to improve humanity.\n\nThe goal of their breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach, a human being who will be aware of both maternal and paternal ancestral memories, and have prescient abilities greater than those of the Guild's navigators. The Bene Gesserit are close, they believe, to the fruition of their plan, and Paul Atreides is at the heart of it. Jessica, his mother, disobeyed Bene Gesserit orders out of attachment to Leto Atreides, and gave birth to a boy, Paul. Her express orders had been to produce a girl, whom the Bene Gesserit would have mated with a Harkonnen, and they hoped from this union they would produce the Kwisatz Haderach. Ultimately, the change in plan causes Paul Atreides to exhibit unexpected resources, and possibilities that were unforeseen by the Bene Gesserit plan.\n\nWith House Atreides becoming increasingly more powerful within the Landsraad, the Padishah Emperor concocts a plan to rid the Imperium of the great house under the guise of a Harkonnen attack. The emperor awards House Atreides with the stewardship of Arrakis, a desert planet and the only source of the most valuable substance in the universe, spice melange. Whilst Leto is aware that the Emperor is out to betray him, he sees Arrakis as a way to prove himself within the Landsraad and grow in power by turning around Arrakis — a feat that had not been acomplished by the Harkonnens in eight decades.\n\nThe move to Arrakis is difficult for the Atreides, and they find that the equipment left by the Harkonnens has been deliberately sabotaged in order to increase their chances of failing. Navigating the complex relationships on Arrakis too proves difficult, and it is often unknown where alliances lie. It quickly becomes clear to Jessica and the other members of the Atreides house that there are several stakeholders at play on Arrakis, among them, the powerful Spacing Guild whom have been taking bribes from the Fremen to keep Arrakis clear of satellites.\n\nThe Harkonnen attack is more diabolical, more powerful, and comes more quickly than the Atreides expect, however The Harkonnens manage to gain a spy in the Atreides inner household, and in doing so achieve something unique in Imperial history: they break the \"imperial conditioning\" of a Suk doctor, which had been universally believed to make a person incapable of consciously causing physical harm. The Harkonnens bend the Atreides doctor – Yueh – to their will by promising to release his wife from prolonged imprisonment and torture.\n\nWhen the Harkonnens attack, Yueh lowers the defensive house shields and uses sedative drugs to disable Leto, Paul, and Jessica, leaving the Atreides leaderless and disorganized under the Harkonnen and Sardaukar military onslaught. The Atreides army is crushed, with only a few remnants managing to escape.\n\nPaul and Jessica are sent into the desert to die. Because of the use of truthsayers in the Empire, the Baron Harkonnen needs to be able to say truthfully that he was not (directly) responsible for their deaths. However, this plan is foiled by arrangements made by Yueh and Paul and Jessica manage to kill their captors and escape into the desert.\n\nYueh, eager for a shot at killing the Baron he so deeply despises and knowing he won't have the chance himself, implants a fake tooth in Leto's mouth. When bitten, the tooth emits a poison that will be fatal to both Leto, and hopefully, the Baron Harkonnen. When Yueh hands over Leto, Baron Harkonnen kills Yueh. Leto, still paralyzed, but conscious, attempts to kill the Baron by breaking the gas capsule, but misjudges his moment, and is only successful in killing the Baron's adviser and Mentat, Piter de Vries.\n\nPaul and Jessica initially met up with planetologist Liet Kynes and Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, hiding in a botanical testing station abandoned long ago. However, they are not there long before the station is attacked by Sardaukar, who kill Duncan. Paul and Jessica flee to the deep desert in an ornithopter, parting ways with Dr Kynes. They let the Harkonnens think they have died from a Coriolis storm.\n\nIn the deep desert, under the pressure of extreme circumstances and the increased doses of Spice that he has been ingesting simply by living on Arrakis, some of Paul's powers come into fruition, and his ability to see possible futures explodes into awareness. He sees many things, a way out of his situation, and the restoration of the Atreides, if only he can make contact with the native Fremen and survive.\n\nAfter a dangerous crossing of the desert, Paul and Jessica manage to meet up with a troop of Fremen. Paul and Jessica prove their worth by disarming Fremen in unarmed combat, aided by Bene Gesserit prana-bindu tralietining – the \"Weirding Way\" – and the Fremen leader Stilgar gladly accepts them into his troop because he would like to add that skill to the Fremen people. Paul also meets a young woman, Chani, daughter of Liet Kynes, who himself dies in a spice blow after wandering through the desert having hallucinations of his father. Paul has long seen Chani in his dreams. During this scuffle, Paul disarms a proud Fremen, Jamis, who takes offence at this \"presumptuous\" youth, and challenges Paul to a fight to the death. Superficially, this contest between a grown man and an untried fifteen-year-old boy would seem grossly unfair. But Paul having been trained by masters of the sword, and although at first unwilling to kill, triumphs easily, making his name in the tribe, and also succeeding to the position of head of the household of the dead man. At the same time, Paul and Jessica are introduced to the deadly harshness of the Fremen lifestyle, as the Fremen ritually and literally render Jamis down to his water because it is so precious to them. Stilgar gives Paul the name Usul – meaning \"the strong base of a pillar\" – as his private name within the troop; Paul gives himself the name \"Paul Muad'dib\" as his public Fremen name.\n\nWhen they return to the troop's hidden cave dwelling, known as a sietch, they discover the Fremen Reverend Mother is near death, and with the fortuitous arrival of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, they make Jessica their Sayyadina. The Fremen have been so influenced by the Bene Gesserit that they attempt to emulate many of their actions with some success including the creation of Reverend Mothers. Jessica, not realizing the consequences of what the Fremen are about to do, accepts to cement her place in the tribe. Halfway through the process she realizes she has made a mistake, that she is involved in a similar process to how the Bene Gesserit make their own Reverend Mothers who can see genetic memories, and realizes that the baby in her womb, fathered by Leto before his death, will also go through the process. This has truly unfortunate consequences, because it is a Bene Gesserit teaching that any such baby will not have the strength to withstand the memories of its ancestors.\n\nYears pass. Paul Muad'dib learns to be a Fremen, and becomes something of a religious leader among the Fremen. Chani becomes his lover (but not his wife, as will become significant later) and bears him a son, whom he calls Leto. He and his mother train the Fremen of Sietch Tabr and other Fremen who seek out Paul in his religious guise, in the Weirding Way, the Bene Gesserit's prana-bindu fighting techniques. Under his leadership his \"Fedaykin\" experience victory after victory against the Harkonnens, and Paul's prestige and aura among the Fremen grow.\n\nIn order to be truly accepted by the Fremen he must become a sandrider. The Fremen have a great secret: they have learned to control the giant sandworms native to Arrakis. Through the use of \"maker hooks\", they have learned to climb aboard the worms and take control of their course, enabling them to quickly move around the desert. This has given the Fremen better mobility than any of the series of occupying armies of Arrakis, as air power cannot be projected in the face of common Coriolis storms. Obviously riding a giant sandworm is not the safest of tasks, but Paul attempts it and succeeds, becoming a full member of the sietch.\n\nThe same day, a band of smugglers sought melange too deep in the desert, and the Fremen of Sietch Tabr spring a trap. In the middle of the battle Paul recognises his weapons teacher, Gurney Halleck, and calls on him and his men to surrender. Gurney is overjoyed and overwhelmed in equal measure. He surrenders his men, and joins Paul's service. Among Gurney's men, however, are some Imperial spies who attempt to kill Muad'dib. They are unsuccessful, and they are captured by the Fedaykin. Paul gives secret orders for the spies to be allowed to escape, so that they would reveal that Paul Atreides still lives on Arrakis. Taking advantage of recruiting Gurney Halleck, Paul uses the moment to solve his leadership problem. Since he has become a wormrider many of his followers have expected Muad'dib to challenge Stilgar, his greatest friend among the Fremen, in order to take control of Sietch Tabr. But Paul breaks tradition and in doing so forces Stilgar to do the same, managing to sidestep this issue by proclaiming himself the ruling Duke of Arrakis, and thus taking power without killing his friend.\n\nThey return to Sietch Tabr. Gurney is shocked to discover Jessica is still alive, because he believes she was the one who betrayed the Atreides and that Paul does not know. Gurney is about to kill her when Paul walks in, manages to stop him, and explains that Yueh was the traitor. Gurney is almost broken by his nearly fatal and tragic error, but Jessica forgives him and he is bound even further into Atreides and Jessica's service.\n\nPaul's power among the Fremen grows, but he is still frustrated. He is not all he could be: he cannot control his journeys into the future, and much of it is still blank to him. He takes a truly risky step and consumes a tiny amount of a concentrated form of melange called spice essence, and so attempts to perform the male equivalent of the Reverend Mother ceremony. Previously to this no man has survived this experience, and it seems he fails also, as he sinks into a coma.\n\nPaul neglects to tell anyone what he is doing; many people think he is dead, although others, primarily the Fedaykin, believe he is in a religious trance. His mother, Jessica, does all she can to wake him but fails, so out of desperation she calls Chani from the deep desert to help. Chani, through her more personal knowledge of Paul's dreams and desires, realises what a mad thing Paul has done, and uses spice essence converted by Jessica using her powers as a Reverend Mother to bring him out of his trance. For Paul no time has passed, and he glories in his new memories and powers — he tells his mother and Chani immediately that the Emperor himself is currently orbiting the planet with many Sardaukar, ready to attack. He has proven the Bene Gesserit wrong: he is the Kwisatz Haderach, appearing one generation ahead of the prediction. He declares that it is now time to destroy the Harkonnens.\n\nFremen attacks on the Harkonnens had already managed to almost entirely stop the flow of the spice from Arrakis. This forced the Emperor to act, and he comes to Arrakis with all his Sardaukar, and also levies of all the other noble houses, to annihilate the Fremen if necessary in order to get the spice flowing again.\n\nBy now the Emperor is aware of who Muad'dib is. In advance of his arrival, he sends a large Sardaukar force into the deep desert for information. Attacking a sietch, they manage to kill Paul's son, and capture Alia – Paul's sister – but are driven off by Fremen children, old people and women.\n\nAfter the Emperor himself has landed, Paul launches the final attack. Using the House Atriedes' family atomics (nuclear weapons) that his men managed to retrieve after the Harkonnen attack, he blows a hole in the Shield Wall (a mountain/rock wall) that protects the capital of Dune, Arrakeen, from the surrounding desert and its fierce storms. By using the weapons this way, he narrowly avoids contravening the universal ban against using atomics on people, which would have required the other noble houses to retaliate with \"planetary annihilation\". The Fremen attack under cover of a huge desert storm, riding sandworms from the desert through the hole in the Shield Wall. The great static force of the sandstorm then shorts out all of the Sardaukar's defensive shields. The Sardaukar are unable to withstand the full force of the Fremen, caught as they are in total surprise, and the Emperor is forced to surrender. The combined forces of the Landsraad still loom in orbit around the planet, but Paul threatens to destroy the Spice if any of them try to land, and they back off. In the surprise of Muad'dib's attack, Alia manages to escape, and in the process kills Baron Harkonnen, by now revealed to be hers and Paul's grandfather, having illegitimately sired Jessica.\n\nRealizing that Muad'dib is not some mad Fremen religious leader changes the situation dramatically for the Emperor. Feyd-Rautha, the Baron's nephew, an acclaimed gladiator, challenges Paul to single combat; claiming rights of kanly as had been declared by Paul's father Leto. Kanly is a formal feud or vendetta under the rules of the Great Convention carried on according to the strictest limitations. Paul agrees even knowing that it is possible he will die, but after a difficult fight during which Feyd-Rautha attempts treachery in the form of a poisoned knife and needle, Paul eventually triumphs.\n\nPaul refuses to take any more nonsense. He forces the Emperor from the throne by the simple expedience of taking power from the real rulers of the Empire – the Spacing Guild – who control space travel. He again threatens to destroy the spice if they do not ship all the troops home. The Spacing Guild have no choice – their limited powers of prophecy show Paul is capable of it – and they send everyone home. The Emperor abdicates and retires to Salusa Secundus. Paul marries the Emperor's eldest daughter, Irulan (in name only; Chani remains his close companion and mother of his heirs, as Jessica did for Leto), and assumes control of the Empire. Irulan later writes extensively on the subject of Muad'Dib, having nothing of him but knowledge of his lifestyle and patterns of thought.\n\nPaul promises the Fremen that he will turn Arrakis into a garden planet, while permitting that the deserts remain so that the sandworms (and consequently the melange) will survive; and all seems well in the real life of Paul Atreides.\n\nSetting[]\n\nAt the time of the novel, advanced computers have long been forbidden due to an event known as the Butlerian Jihad, and the ensuing commandment of the Orange Catholic Bible: \"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind,\" with the penalty of being sentenced to death. In lieu of computer assistance, human skills have been developed to an astonishing degree:\n\nMentats through intensive training learn to enter a heightened mental state in which they can perform complex logical computations. Most of the best Mentats, and all of the popular \"twisted Mentats,\" are trained/grown by the Bene Tleilax, although Paul Atreides is not, having been trained by the Master of Assassins, Thufir Hawat as well as his own mother the Lady Jessica Atreides. Mentats are also used in lesser extent by the Bene Gesserit.\n\nThe Spacing Guild holds a monopoly on interstellar transport. Its navigators use the spice/drug melange to gain limited prescient abilities, enabling them to safely use the \"fold space\" technology — guiding Guild Heighliner ships safely to their destination by using a Holtzman engine, which allows instantaneous travel to anywhere in the galaxy.\n\nThe Bene Gesserit is a secretive female society, often referred to as \"witches,\" with mental and physical powers developed through thousands of generations of controlled gene lines and many years of physical and mental conditioning called prana-bindu training. When a Bene Gesserit acolyte becomes a full Reverend Mother, by undergoing the Agony she gains her \"ancestral memories\" — the complete life experience of an infinite line of female ancestors (she cannot recall the memories of her male ancestors, and is terrified by the psychic space within her that the masculine memories inhabit). The Agony is caused by taking the bile of a dying sandworm, a poison that they must metabolically render benign within their bodies, or else they would fail the trial, and die from its lethal toxicity.\n\nOn the fringes of the Galaxy are the geneticist Tleilaxu, who create shape shifters, reincarnated gholas, and Mentats, and Ix, a planet whose history is lost in the mists of time and whose society is dominated by technology. The CHOAM corporation is the major underpinning of the Imperial economy, with shares and directorships determining each House's income and financial leverage.\n\nThe universe's entire power structure, including the financial and military power of the Imperium and the Great Houses, the Guild's control of interstellar travel, and the Bene Gesserit's special powers, are all subject to the availability of Melange. The control of Melange by a single group is a sociopolitical condition known as hydraulic despotism (utilizing control of a commodity with a single source to hold power over others).\n\nA prominent feature of the setting is the use of evolved languages and linguistic traits, just as J.R.R. Tolkien developed ancient languages and linguistic traits in The Lord of the Rings.\n\nThemes[]\n\nThe consequences of the actions of superheroes, and humanity's responses, form an overarching theme in the Dune series. In an interview with Frank Herbert published in Omni Magazine in July 1980, the author said:\n\n\"Enormous problems arise when human mistakes are made on the grand scale available to a superhero... Heroes are painful, superheroes are a catastrophe. The mistakes of superheroes involve too many of us in disaster.\" [1]\n\nAlso:\n\n\"I had this theory that superheroes were disastrous for humans, that even if you postulated an infallible hero, the things this hero set in motion fell eventually into the hands of fallible mortals. What better way to destroy a civilization, society or a race than to set people into the wild oscillations which follow their turning over their critical judgment and decision-making faculties to a superhero?\"\n\nThe emphasis on ecological and religious ideas and the use of many cultural themes made the novel a provocative departure from previous science fiction.\n\nPolitical themes in the Dune series include human beings' susceptibility to mass manipulation by political propaganda, religious dogma (e.g., The Missionaria Protectiva), and sexual temptation, and the importance of self-awareness and self-mastery in resisting these types of control, as well as the study of power and control.\n\nContinuity[]\n\nCharacters[]\n\nAbulurd Harkonnen (Mentioned only)\n\nAbulurd Rabban (Mentioned only)\n\nAli Ben Ohashi (Mentioned only)\n\nAlia Atreides\n\nAnirul Corrino (Mentioned only)\n\nAramsham\n\nArkie\n\nChalice Corrino (Mentioned only)\n\nChani Kynes\n\nChatt\n\nCoss\n\nCzigo\n\nDrisq\n\nDuncan Idaho\n\nElrood Corrino IX (Mentioned only)\n\nEsmar Tuek\n\nFarok\n\nFarrukh\n\nFedor\n\nFeyd-Rautha Harkonnen\n\nFeyd-Rautha's chief Handler\n\nGaius Helen Mohiam\n\nGeoff\n\nGlossu Rabban Harkonnen\n\nGurney Halleck\n\nHalleck's Lieutenant\n\nHarah\n\nHasimir Fenring\n\nHawat's lieutenant\n\nIakin Nefud\n\nIrulan Corrino\n\nJamis\n\nJessica Atreides\n\nJosifa Corrino (Mentioned only)\n\nKaleff\n\nKinet\n\nKorba\n\nLarus\n\nLemil\n\nLeto Atreides I\n\nLiet Kynes\n\nLingar Bewt\n\nMaometh (Mentioned only)\n\nMapes\n\nMargot Fenring\n\nMattai\n\nMitha\n\nNisai (Mentioned only)\n\nOrlop\n\nOtheym\n\nPardee\n\nPardot Kynes (Mentioned only)\n\nPiter de Vries\n\nRamallo\n\nRugi Corrino (Mentioned only)\n\nShaddam Corrino IV\n\nShimoon\n\nShishakli\n\nShoab\n\n\"Soo-Soo\"\n\nStaban Tuek\n\nStilgar\n\nsubiay\n\nTharthar\n\nThufir Hawat\n\nTurok\n\nUliet\n\nUmman Kudu\n\nUnnamed Atreides Gladiator\n\nUnnamed Atreides Trooper\n\nUnnamed Escort Service Woman\n\nUnnamed Escort Whore\n\nUnnamed Factory Commander\n\nUnnamed Fremen Leader\n\nUnnamed Harkonnen Assassin\n\nUnnamed Sand Worker\n\nUnnamed Gamont Slave-boy\n\nUnnamed Guild Bank Agent\n\nUnnamed Guildsman\n\nUnnamed Harkonnen Slavemaster\n\nUnnamed Manufacturer's Companion\n\nunnamed Manufacturer's daughter\n\nUnnamed replacement parts dealer\n\nUnnamed Slave-Concubine\n\nUnnamed Spacing Guild Mentat\n\nUnnamed Sardaukar Commander\n\nUnnamed Sardaukar Officer\n\nUnnamed Sardaukar Soldier\n\nUnnamed Stillsuit Manufacturer\n\nVladimir Harkonnen\n\nWanna Marcus (Mentioned only)\n\nWensicia Corrino (Mentioned only)\n\nPlanets and locations[]\n\nArrakis\n\nArrakeen\n\nSietch Tabr\n\nGreat Flat\n\nImperial Basin\n\nCave of Riches\n\nHarg Pass\n\nMount Idaho\n\nMinor Erg\n\nTuck’s Sietch\n\nTuono Basin\n\nHagga Basin\n\nRed Chasm\n\nSihaya Ridge\n\nCaladan\n\nGiedi Prime\n\nSalusa Secundus\n\nBela Tegeuse\n\nChusuk\n\nEcaz\n\nGrumman\n\nHagal\n\nPoritrin\n\nRichese\n\nTleilax\n\nTupile\n\nWallach IX\n\nOrganizations[]\n\nCorrino Empire\n\nBene Gesserit\n\nC.H.O.A.M.\n\nSpacing Guild\n\nCommission of Ecumenical Translators\n\nTitles[]\n\nPadishah Emperor\n\nDuke\n\nBaron\n\nReverend Mother\n\nBashar\n\nSaint\n\nSayyadina\n\nEvents[]\n\nArrakis Revolt\n\nBattle of Corrin (Mentioned only)\n\nButlerian Jihad (Mentioned only)\n\nDesert War\n\nWar of Assassins of Houses Ginaz and Moritani (Mentioned only)\n\nThe Houses[]\n\nHouse Atreides\n\nHouse Harkonnen\n\nHouse Corrino\n\nReferences to the real world[]\n\nA From a historical perspective, many have noted similarities between the events of Dune, in which a foreign-born son of an old colonial order unites disparate and warring tribes of religious desert nomads to win freedom from a decaying Imperial power, and the Arab Revolt of early 20th century Middle Eastern history, in which the British liaison officer T.E. Lawrence mobilized Arab fighters to break the power of the Ottoman Turks in the Arabian peninsula. While there are many striking parallels, one of the most trivial and bizarre may be that in the film adaptations Dune (1984) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962), both characters representing the old Imperial order (Emperor Shaddam IV and the Turkish Bey, respectively), are played by the actor José Ferrer. In his interview with OMNI, Herbert explicitly identified CHOAM with OPEC, equating the spice melange to oil (it should be noted that OPEC did not become notable as a political power until after the publication of the first novel). Parallels can also be drawn to the European/Asian spice trade of early modern Europe and later eras, in particular between the Spacing Guild and the Dutch East India Company.\n\nAnother parallel story can be found in Basil Dearden's film Khartoum (1965), with Charlton Heston as General Gordon. The baroque, stylish and brocaded uniforms are very reminiscent of the Caladan ducal-court uniforms used in the first Dune movie. The British Empire sends out Gordon to administer Sudan and its capital Khartoum on behalf of Egypt, aware that this is virtually a suicide mission. Like Leto Atreides, General Gordon, a legendary and formidable warrior of the Empire, goes willingly to his demise. The historical basis of this film lies in the story of the Sudanese supposed Mahdi, Muhammad Ahmad, an Islamic messianic figure that rose to power in the late 19th century. Paul Atreides is referred to as \"Mahdi\" at one point in the novel and in later novels, particularly Dune Messiah. The Mahdi's jihadist army prevails over the technologically superior British army in Sudan, just as the inspired Fremen defeat the Harkonnen forces and imperial troops.\n\nAnother connection exists between the name of house Atreides and the name of the legendary Greek house of Atreus, whose members figure prominently in many Greek tragedies.\n\nThese parallels can be pushed too far. In particular, none of them has rebels dethroning the emperor, any parallel to the Bene Gesserit and its program, or to the ecological aspects of the Dune story.\n\nDune was written shortly after LSD appeared in America as a recreational drug. The psychedelic experience of LSD can be directly related to the altered states of consciousness that the spice Melange can induce.\n\nAllusions/references from other works[]\n\nAfter its release, Dune has influenced many other SF works.\n\nIn the Japanese anime Last Exile, the theme of nations waging war with a supposedly neutral arbiter strikes a similar parallel to the Dune series. Also, the Claudia fluid and high value of water can also said to be inspired by Dune. More interestingly is the Guild in the series, which bears a similarity (in name and some characteristics) to the Spacing Guild of Dune.\n\nIn the science fiction MMORPG Anarchy Online, a hypercorporation called Omni-Tek was granted control of a seemingly useless desert planet called Rubi-Ka. However, Rubi-Ka is the only known source of notum - an extremely valuable mineral. This situation is very similar to that in the Dune novels. There are also Krys knives and giant sandworms in the game.\n\nThe song \"To Tame a Land\" by the heavy metal band Iron Maiden from the album Piece of Mind is based on the novel. Originally, it was going to be called Dune. According to the band's fansite, Frank Herbert's agent relayed his refusal stating that \"Frank Herbert doesn't like rock groups. Especially hard rock and especially groups like Iron Maiden.\"\n\nVarious work by heavy metal band Fear Factory contain titles and themes related to Dune, including the song Hunter-Killer on Demanufacture album and the remix album Fear is The Mind Killer.\n\nComedian Dane Cook references Dune being like Nestlé Nesquik on his cd Harmful If Swallowed on the track Hopped Up On the Q.\n\nThe metal band Shai Hulud drew their name from the Fremen word for the sandworms.\n\nThe planet Tatooine in the Film series Star Wars is a planet completely covered by desert, and one of the species on the planet, the Tusken Raiders, share some traits with the Fremen (wearing moisture-retaining clothing and masks, living a semi-primitive existence in the desert)\n\nThe cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants has an episode referencing Dune where SpongeBob and Sandy track down a ravenous \"Alaskan Bull Worm\" that is massive in size and length. Near the end of the episode, the two characters ride on the worm's back and at one point, Sandy even mentions finding a \"Worm-sign\" (Which turns out to be a palm-sized picket sign with the word \"worm\" written on it).\n\nThe song 'Traveler In Time' by the power metal band Blind Guardian from the album Tales from the Twilight World starts with the lyrics 'The Morning Sun of Dune'.\n\nIn the video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, one of the optional missions takes place on a desert-like world with giant worms — much like the planet Dune.\n\nOn an episode of Futurama, Al Gore claims to have ridden the \"Moon Worm.\"\n\nIn the 519th episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 Crow says \"we have worm-sign\" when a scene with a desert appears on screen. And then later, in the same episode, says \"Arrakis, Dune, Desert Planet\" the exact words used in the novel.\n\nThe heavy metal band Star One released a song on their album Space Metal called \"Sandrider\".\n\nThe song \"Painamplifier\" by Swedish synthpop band Covenant from the U.S. version of the album Dreams of a Cryotank references the 1984 Dune movie and includes 2 samples from the movie.\n\nThe Warhammer 40,000 universe has been heavily inspired by Dune, including references and influences that include:\n\nA weapon called a Lasgun\n\nA guild of psychic, mutated navigators known as the \"Navis Nobilite\"\n\nA religious prohibition on robotics and artificial intelligence\n\nA galaxy-spanning empire known as \"The Imperium\", ruled over by a psychic, immortal monarch with the title of \"God Emperor\" that protects mankind as a whole\n\nAn all-female army zealously devoted to said God Emperor\n\nDune is also thought to be an example of the \"Hero's Journey\" (or \"Monomyth\") as described by Joseph Campbell.\n\nCanadian musician Grimes released album called Geidi Primes which contains songs with Dune references, such as \"Caladan\", \"Sardaukar Levenbrech\", \"Feyd Rautha Dark Heart\" and \"Shadout Mapes\".\n\nThe British goa-trance project Juno Reactor used several samples from the 1984 Dune movie in the song Rotorblade.\n\nThe track 'Weapon of Choice' by the artist Fatboy Slim features the lyrics \"Walk without rhythm,\n\nit won't attract the worm\", apparently referencing the sand worms of Dune.\n\nAwards and nominations[]\n\nNebula award for best novel in 1965\n\nHugo award for best novel 1966 in literature. Joint first place with ...And Call Me Conrad by Roger Zelazny\n\nFilm, TV or theatrical adaptations[]\n\nDune (1984 film) film adaptation by David Lynch\n\nFrank Herbert's Dune made by the Sci Fi Channel (United States)\n\nDune (2021 film)\n\nDune: Part Two second film directed by Denis Villeneuve\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe original novel, Dune, was rejected by twenty publishers; it has since become the bestselling science fiction novel of all time, selling more than twelve million copies, including millions more of the five sequels.\n\nReferences[]"
