There, a Harkonnen general is being held captive by Atreides forces in an imposing base high in the icy mountains. The audacious plan calls for Rabban and seven troopers to parachute into the mountains wearing Areides disguises, penetrate the base, and rescue the general before the enemy extracts vital information from him. Their mission changes when Rabban discovers a traitor in their midst.\n\nTrapped inside an enemy stronghold, Rabban must find the Beast within himself... or perish.\n\nReading a story in which Rabban employs subterfuge to solve a problem instead of brute force makes for a unique read. He is surprisingly adept at it, deploying the same level of weapons-grade deception as I do in posting about books that do not exist.\n\n#duneseries #dune #frankherbert #frankherbertdune #dunemovie #scifi #frankherbertsdune #sciencefiction #bookstagram #books #arrakis #atreides #dunebooks #hereticsofdune #posterart #dunemessiah #bookcover #childrenofdune #illustration #stellanskarsgard #dunequotes #beast #davebautista #illustrator #design #bookcoverart #movies #scifiart #sciencefictionart #fantasyart\".",
