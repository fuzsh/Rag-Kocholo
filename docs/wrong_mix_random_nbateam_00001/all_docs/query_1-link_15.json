        "text": "Author: Frank Herbert\n\nTitle: Dune Messiah\n\nFormat: paperback\n\nPages: 331\n\nSeries: Dune #2\n\nI’ve been dragging my feet while writing this review, because I’m a bit conflicted about Dune Messiah. The long and short of it is that Herbert in this follow up to Dune enters into a veritable quagmire of conflicting ideas, and like Baron Münchhausen tries to get himself out of the mud by his own hair. But let’s dive with Herbert into the mud, and see if we can find some treasures.\n\nDune Messiah deftly omits the Jihad and the bloody, brutal genocide it entailed. We only see reminders of the galactic war that still devours some distant planets, in the form of veterans coming home – changed, embittered, disillusioned. I would like to have seen more of the terrible war engendered by the Atreides, but the main conflict in the second Dune installment is played out in airy chambers, opulent throne rooms, cavernous temples and secret meeting rooms of conspirators as all players vie for power embodied by the new emperor. It’s all pretty cozy, with a severely limited cast and choice of actions, all muted by the mood of impending doom. Herbert instead focuses on the tragedy of Paul – a prescient apex of human evolution, a god to the faithful of the religion he started on the foundations built by Bene Gesserit, a tyrant emperor eradicating dissent with the rabid ranks of his followers. A person plagued by what others see as a gift and he sees as an affliction, besieged on all sides by his enemies and pushing away those closest to him, Paul lives in constant grief over the future and constant guilt over the past. A tragic hero, or perhaps an anti-hero, conflicted and torn – after all, in the end Paul refuses his birthright, denies his destiny, and attempts to erase himself from history – but not before he ensures the continuous existence of his line.\n\nPaul’s prescience is one of the many thorny issues Herbert tries to solve in Dune Messiah – whether successfully, I have my doubts. Because Paul’s powers are shown to be so immense in Dune, nearly omniscient, in Dune Messiah Herbert attempts to water them down, through the use of various underdeveloped tools: Dune Tarot, a set of divination cards very popular on the planet and apparently fogging the visions of the future, is the most glaring one; but the dumb Guild navigator swimming in his tank and creating blind spots in prescience is not far behind – that’s basically his entire purpose in the book. Both Paul and Alia struggle here to find their way out of the multitudes of unwanted futures they see in front of them – acting seemingly irrationally, secretively, or even without all necessary information. The path blurs and twists, and the apparent certainty of Dune suddenly evaporates as other players and forces are introduced by Herbert.\n\nIn Dune Messiah Herbert changes his perspective on destiny and makes Paul a subject, and not an agent, of the flow of events. Many passages here suggest that the only way for Paul to escape the destiny would be to find another focus for it – and he finds it in his and Chani’s children. Was Herbert looking for a way out for Paul that would allow him to keep his conscience, to end on the good end of the hero-villain spectrum? This would be my interpretation – Chani’s drive to have children first resisted and then indulged by fore-grieving Paul seems to be the main reason for their appearance, and not a long-term plan of shifting the burden of responsibility to a younger set of arms. And the lucky strike of the existence of Leto, hidden from Paul’s awareness by the child’s own budding Kwisatz Haderach powers, seems too much of a coincidence as Paul initially envisioned Ghanima, his more “normal” offspring, as his heir. We see their innate, fateful connection when Paul accesses the newborn Leto’s sense of sight – Leto lends him his own ocular powers, temporarily eradicating the boundaries between himself and his father.\n\nDune Messiah reads like a much more typical sf, with more streamlined plot and more personal stakes, as well as fast flowing action. There are conspiracies, dwarfs, hidden attacks, returns from the dead – the whole gamut of tropes, some used straight from the package, some deftly twisted and turned. It is a very entertaining book, if, as I have mentioned earlier, a deeply unhappy one, filled with a sense of foreboding that indeed bears the foreshadowed poisoned fruit. Is Paul’s final decision a cop out, a personal, perhaps slightly selfish choice, or is it a predestined, predetermined course of action he could not influence at all? It is interesting that Herbert deprives his exalted Kwisatz Haderach of his powers on the eve of that decision – perhaps there can be only one Kwisatz Haderach at a time, and Leto already takes this mantle? Or maybe these powers are indeed an expression of deeper psychophysiological processes and Paul loses them as a result of the personal trauma. Herbert definitely borrows some of the Tarot symbolic imagery here, rendering his Emperor a Fool, not looking/blindfolded and dancing on the edge of precipice – and confirmation can be found in the Epilogue, in which in The Ghola’s Hymn Paul is called the fool saint, “the golden stranger living forever on the edge of reason”.\n\nSpeaking of gholas, I am still not entirely convinced of the necessity of the appearance of Duncan Idaho as one. While it definitely enriches the lore, allowing for a new set of players to enter the field – the Bene Tleilax and the Face Dancers form formidable factions – Duncan’s arc seems for now as more of an indulgence on Herbert’s part, a McGuffin sort of device there only to prove a point and put the climactic choice in a starker emotional contrast. Perhaps he is there to ensure continuity of the character cast, since at the end of Dune Messiah so many of the original characters are no longer around, but the vapid pseudo philosophical blabbering coming from the supposedly enlightened Zenni mentat was at times quite irksome. He is supposed to serve as a catalyst, but in the predetermined universe of Dune he only confirms pre-existing assumptions, which renders him nothing more than a curiosity, a mirror to other characters – redundant but undoubtedly flashy.\n\nYet Idaho was not half as irksome as the treatment of women in Dune Messiah. With the ruthless and power-hungry Jessica out of the picture we encounter a new set of troubling stereotypes – the most concerning of which is Alia. Alia, the virgin whore, Alia, reckless and self-destructive, irresponsible and overly emotional, Alia, precocious and panting with lust. Man, I only vaguely remembered those passages from my previous read, and I wish it was still the case. While in Dune Alia’s existence seemed like a proof of guilt of the ever-meddling and manipulative Bene Gesserit, here she serves as a counterpoint to Paul – reckless where he is cautious, rebellious where Paul is resigned to his fate. Paul is the voice of reason to Alia’s shout of madness.\n\nBut surely, there are other women there? Alia’s destiny was created by Jessica, and she cannot be judged by the sins of her mother. Well, we have Irulan, as ambitious as she is obsolete, a uniquely dumb Bene Gesserit, uncomprehending of the events around her, driven by her urges disguised as rationales, easily influenced and serving only as a glorified secretary. There is also Chani, the reliable, feisty Chani, here turned into a walking womb and a source of grief. Throughout the book I kept wondering why Paul would not share what he knew with her. Why would he keep the agency away from her? Has her judgement suddenly become less reliable? Could she not decide her own fate? This entire plot line seems like Herbert’s own cop out, keeping everybody but Paul and Alia in the dark just to deliver a stronger gut-punch at the end. In a way, this is Herbert’s betrayal of Chani who becomes just another pawn in the game of shadows, in a very 1950’s US housewife way. The only formidable woman in Dune Messiah is Gaius Helen Mohiam, the Reverend Mother from Dune, the secret mover and shaker behind the scenes who here serves only as a footnote to Paul’s overwhelming if temporary control.\n\nBut I’ve written enough. Despite my criticisms above, Dune Messiah is an intriguing, engrossing and multi-layered novel which verges closer to traditional SF and becomes more accessible in the process. The pall of tragedy hangs above everything, and it speaks of Herbert’s skill that you can almost taste the peril and the exhausting grief in the sands of Dune. It is written skillfully and with elegance of thought, and while much less ambitious than Dune it still stands head and shoulders above the majority of the genre’s offerings. While it is not a perfect book, it is certainly worth reading, especially for the conflicted ambivalence of its central figure, Paul Atreides.
