        "text": "Frank Herbert (born October 8, 1920, Tacoma, Washington, U.S.—died February 11, 1986, Madison, Wisconsin) was an American science-fiction writer noted as the author of the best-selling Dune series of futuristic novels, a group of highly complex works that explore such themes as ecology, human evolution, the consequences of genetic manipulation, and mystical and psychic possibilities.\n\nUntil 1972, when he began to write full-time, Herbert held a variety of jobs while writing socially engaged science fiction. He was working as a journalist when his reputation was made with the publication of the epic Dune (1965), which follows the young nobleman Paul Atreides through adversity to his destiny as a messianic leader on the arid desert planet Arrakis. Dune has been translated into more than 20 languages and sold some 20 million copies, more than any other science-fiction book in history; ironically, Dune had been rejected by 20 publishers before it was published.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFantasy Lands\n\nHerbert wrote five more books in the Dune series: Dune Messiah (1969), Children of Dune (1976), God-Emperor of Dune (1981), Heretics of Dune (1984), and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985). These books followed Paul Atreides and House Atreides through future millennia. In the late 1990s Herbert’s son Brian began collaborating with Kevin J. Anderson on books set in the world of Dune, employing some of the elder Herbert’s notes. The first, Dune: House Atreides, was released in 1999, and many more followed.\n\nAn abortive film version of Dune was attempted in 1975 by Chilean-French director Alejandro Jodorowsky; that effort was chronicled in the documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune (2013). Dino De Laurentiis purchased the rights in 1976, and an adaptation was filmed by David Lynch (1984). A television miniseries aired in 2000, followed by another miniseries (2003), which covered the events in the second and third Dune books. In 2021 French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve released another film adaptation, which was based on the first half of Dune, and the sequel Dune: Part Two followed in 2024.\n\nIncluded among Herbert’s more than two dozen novels are the highly acclaimed Dragon in the Sea (1956), The Green Brain (1966), The Santaroga Barrier (1968), The Heaven Makers (1968), The God Makers (1972), and The Dosadi Experiment (1977)."
