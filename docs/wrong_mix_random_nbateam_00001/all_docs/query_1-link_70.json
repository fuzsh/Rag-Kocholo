        "text": "The Influence of Islam\n\nSince its inception, Frank Herbert’s Dune series has captivated audiences with its intricate worlds, compelling characters, and thought-provoking themes. One of the most intriguing aspects of the franchise is its profound reliance on Islamic theology and cultural practices, which permeate the narrative and contribute to its richness and depth – a motif that resonates in Denis Villeneuve’s cinematic reiterations.\n\nConcept of jihad\n\nAt the heart of the Dune universe or Duniverse lies the concept of Jihad, an event of paramount importance that shapes the course of history. In Jihad, humanity rises against the encroaching dominance of artificial intelligence, symbolizing a struggle to preserve human intellect and ingenuity. The term “jihad,” derived from Arabic, translates to “struggle,” echoing its traditional connotations of personal and collective endeavor.\n\nDenis Villeneuve’s first film hinted at this jihad when House Atreides was tasked with taking over the planet Arrakis. As the protagonist Paul Atreides descends on the soil of the desert planet, hushed whispers liken him to a promised messiah – a prophet who will lead the original inhabitants of Arrakis in a war against the intruders.\n\nIn the second movie, the whispers gain traction as Paul Atreides leads the Fremen into battle against the powerful House Harkonnen and the Padishah Emperor.\n\nRejection of technology\n\nA central tenet of the Jihad is the admonition: “Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.” This directive reflects the reverence for human potential and the rejection of reliance on technology. It is enshrined in the Orange Catholic Bible, the sacred text of the Dune universe, which blends elements from various faiths.\n\nPart two of the Dune movie series references to these belief systems re-emerge in a heated debate between the Northern and Southern Fremen on whether Paul Atreides is the promised Messiah. How the Southern Fremen pay obeisance to him is reminiscent of Islamic practices.\n\nIslamic motifs\n\nThroughout the Dune movies, Islamic motifs manifest in subtle yet significant ways, enriching the film’s narrative. While the film adaptation, directed by Denis Villeneuve, strives to sensitively portray religious and cultural elements, it struggles with interpretation and representation.\n\nVilleneuve’s ambitious adaptation faced criticism for diluting Herbert’s nuanced exploration of Islam and the Middle East. It avoids overt references and imagery associated with Islamic culture, but in doing so the film tends to oversimplify cultural references to the veil, religious practices and the holy war of the prophecy.\n\nThe cinematic version of Dune employs the term “holy war” instead of “jihad,” in an effort to disassociate jihad from its common association with Islamic extremism. This divergence highlights the complexities of adaptation and the delicate balance between homage and appropriation.\n\nDilution\n\nHerbert’s narrative in Dune was intended to be provocative. However the film dilutes its religious, ecological, and socio-political themes in cinematic abstraction. It favors binary representations and conventional tropes that don’t do justice to the nuanced commentary on imperialism, colonialism, and resistance embedded within the original text.\n\nStill, in both the book and the movie, fans will discern themes that explore the multifaceted role of religion as both a unifying force and a political instrument. Religion is deeply ingrained among the Fremen of Arrakis in their culture, shaping both their beliefs and way of life. Their religious practices which are integral to their identity, draw inspiration from the Sunni sect of Islam and the traditions of Zen Buddhism. The Fremen bow while praying, have faith in Shamans, and even believe in the greater cause of their faith.\n\nReligious rhetoric\n\nVilleneuve’s interpretation is more successful in his portrayal of factions like the Bene Gesserit, who wield religion as a means of manipulation and control. The Bene Gesserit do not adhere to traditional religious doctrines but strategically employ religious rhetoric to further their own agendas and ambitions, leveraging faith as a tool for their pursuit of power. It is they in the movies, who depict Paul Atreides as a messiah through hushed whispers and tall tales.\n\nThe Islamic motif in the Dune films encourages viewers to contemplate the complex themes of identity, power, and belief and offers a platform for dialog and understanding across diverse audiences."
