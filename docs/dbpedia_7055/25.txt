The Museum of Costume of Madrid is a young and modern institution that offers, within its permanent exhibition, a magnificent trip through the History of Fashion and Costume (traje in Spanish), from the most ancient times up to the present.

The Museum of Costume, or Museo del Traje, was founded in 2004, although the history of its collections goes back to 1925. The Museum is located in a modern building, created by the architects Jaime LÃ³pez de AsiaÃ­n and Ãngel DÃ­az DomÃ­nguez, and surrounded by magnificent gardens.

The Museum has reached an optimal position at Madrid's cultural landscape, thanks to its vitality and the quality of its collections.

These collections are wide and varied, as they include historical, contemporary and traditional clothing, jewellery and accessories, and a vast amount of items related to our Ethnological Heritage.
