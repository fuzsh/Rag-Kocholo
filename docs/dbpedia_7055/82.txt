The Museum of Costume, or Museo del Traje, was founded in 2004, although the history of its collections goes back to 1925. The Museum is located in a modern building, created by the architects Jaime López de Asiaín and Ángel Díaz Domínguez, and surrounded by magnificent gardens. www.gomadrid.com/museums/museo-traje.html

The building was built between 1971 and 1973 and inaugurated in 1975 as the Spanish Museum of Contemporary Art. No photos permitted inside,; It's interesting. Not just haute couture crap but histories of textiles and such.
