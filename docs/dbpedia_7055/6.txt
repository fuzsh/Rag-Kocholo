Despite being a little bit off the beaten path, about a 15-minute walk from the Moncloa metro station, a visit to the Museo del Traje is a must for anyone who loves fashion. Built between 1971 and 1973, the immense building which houses the Museo del Traje showcases a vast collection of clothing, costume, accessories, and objects dating all the way back to the 16th century.

From marveling at the intricate embroidery on a gorgeous ball gown from the 19th century to admiring the modern work of Spanish designer Cristóbal Balenciaga, the Museo del Traje took me on a journey through the evolution of fashion throughout Spain and Europe.

However, the Museo del Traje is not just a superficial fashion show, but the perfect place for a history lesson. Through costume and clothing, visitors get a unique glimpse into Spanish customs and behaviors, class structures, and how clothing changed and evolved to accommodate the circumstances of the time.

Every inch of the Museo del Traje is enjoyable, but my favourite part is their magnificent display of traditional Spanish costumes. You don't have to leave Madrid to go on a tour of the country and learn about life in Galicia, Cantabria, Aragón and Andalucía. This museum is big, so after a visit here, you might need to sit and relax for a while. Have a drink at their lovely restaurant and enjoy the surroundings of nearby Parque Oeste.

The Museo del Traje is one of Madrid's most unique museums and will not disappoint.
