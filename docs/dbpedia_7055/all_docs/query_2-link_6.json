        "text": "The Meadows Museum in Dallas, which specialises in Spanish art, has teamed up with the Museo del Traje, a fashion and textiles museum in Madrid, for this exhibition that pairs artworks with examples of historic dress (19 September–9 January 2022). With pairings spanning from the 18th century to the present day, the exhibition sheds light on the important role that fashion has played in visual art across time. Highlights include a portrait from 1918 of the Duchess of Arión, displayed alongside an embroidered silk shawl from the same period that is similar to the example carried by the duchess in her portrait. Find out more from the Meadows’ website.\n\nPreview below | View Apollo’s Art Diary here"
