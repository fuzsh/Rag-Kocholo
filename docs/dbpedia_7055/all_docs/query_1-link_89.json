        "text": "In a typical building built in 1907 where everything is still original, this institution houses a collection of 9,000 pieces ranging from simple clothing to shoes and jewellery. A testimony of a Buenos Aires with different influences, this museum demonstrates the subtle link between clothing and society: how a pair of shoes, a style of trousers or a neckline placed individuals in a social hierarchy. Although little visited, the museum has an impressive compilation of Argentine fashion from the 17th century to the present day and offers new thematic exhibitions as the year progresses, such as \"The vibrant 1920s\", \"Swimsuits from 1980 to the present day\", \"Shoes over the centuries and around the world\"... In the summer of 2018, the museum honored Mary Tapia, a true Argentine Coco Chanel, who revolutionized the Argentine fashion world in the 1960s. Inspired by indigenous motifs from the north of the country and \"European-style\" glamour, it has strongly influenced the world of ready-to-wear. Finally, the architecture of the building contributes to the pleasant side of the visit. Woodwork, ornaments, stained glass windows and mouldings made of angel heads are a clear reminder of the Italian architecture imported to Buenos Aires at the end of the 19th century"
