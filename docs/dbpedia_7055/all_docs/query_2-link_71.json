        "text": "The “Golden Triangle of Art” is home to three of Madrid’s major museums and treats tourists to masterpieces of art and architecture, located close to each other in Madrid city’s center. The Prado, Reina Sofia, and Thyssen museums all make their home on this emblematic area of Madrid.\n\nThe Prado National Museum holds the world’s greatest collection of Spanish art. It was founded with the aim of showing the world that Spanish art is on the same level as and of equal merit to other national art schools. Visitors can view masterpieces by El Greco, Velaszquez, and Goya as well as fine examples of artists from the Flemish School, such as Van der Weyden and Heronymous Bosch. The great artists of the Siglo del Oro (Golden Century)- Murillo, Zuberon, and Ribera- are represented as well.\n\nCreated in 1988, The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museumaims to involve every kind of audience and complements the Prado by showcasing what the other museum lacks. The Thyssen has works in its permanent collection fro the 13th through 20th centuries. Visitors can view works by Italian and Dutch artists, as well as works from the German Renaissance.\n\nThe Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, housed in a renovated 18th century hospital, showcases artwork from the mid-19th century to the present. Visitors will find works by Picasso, Dali, and Miro among others. Picasso’s “Woman in Blue” and “Guernica” belong to the Reina Sofia’s permanent collection. The Reina Sofia’s library specializes in 20th centuy art and archives with over 10,000 volumes and 1,000 periodicals. The Reina Sofia frequently dedicates special exhibits to important contemporary artists.\n\nFor art lovers aiming to improve their Spanish skills while visiting Madrid’s museums, we created the courses Spanish and a passion for art, and Spanish and a passion for little museums. Through these courses we guide students on many aspects of arts during visits to these museums, with Spanish classes focused on related vocabulary and activities. We also include visits to these museums in our TANDEM Cultural Program.\n\nOther important Madrid’s Museums are:\n\nMuseo Sorolla\n\nGeneral Martínez Campos, 37, 28010 Madrid\n\nMuseo de Cera – The Wax Museum\n\nPaseo de Recoletos 41. 28004 Madrid\n\nMuseo Arqueológico Nacional\n\nCalle de Serrano, 13 28001-MADRID\n\nMuseo de América\n\nAvda Reyes Católicos, 6 28040-MADRID\n\nMuseo del Ferrocarril\n\nPaseo de las Delicias, 61 28045 MADRID\n\nThe Caixa Forum Museum in Madrid\n\nPaseo del Prado, 36, 28014 Madrid\n\nMuseo de la Fundación Lázaro Galdiano\n\nSerrano 122, 28006 Madrid\n\nCasa Museo Lope de Vega\n\nCalle Cervantes 11, 28014 Madrid\n\nReal Academia de Bellas Artes\n\nAlcalá, 13, 28014 Madrid\n\nMuseo del Romanticismo\n\nSan Mateo, 13, 28004 Madrid\n\nMuseo Naval Madrid\n\nPaseo del Prado, 5, 28005 Madrid\n\nMuseo del Traje\n\nAvenida de Juan de Herrera, 2.
