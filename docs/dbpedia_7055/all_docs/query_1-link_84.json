        "text": "Madrid is the perfect destination for culture vultures; I was shocked to discover how many museums and cultural centres the city has to offer.\n\nDuring my pre-trip research I came across more and more great spots and so thought I’d put together this little guide to provide travellers with a one-stop shop for info on Madrid’s museums.\n\nThere’s something for everyone, whether you’re into fine art or niche subjects, but the entry price for some of the museums are quite steep. Maybe that’s just my view, having grown up with free access to London’s amazing selection of museums, but further research led me to discover that many of the venues have set days and times when visitors can enter for free.\n\nCity trips can be costly, especially capital cities, so I loved that this option was available, but you’ll need to plan your itinerary accordingly. Also, keep in mind that these free entry time slots are unsurprisingly busy, so be prepared to queue and aim to get there around half hour beforehand in order to ensure you can get in.\n\nSo, without further ado, here’s my guide to Madrid’s museums, including opening times, entry costs and information on if and when they offer free entry!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCaixaForum\n\nThis cultural centre is always home to a selection of exhibitions – during my visit there was a great show on Disney’s Art of Storytelling, with cartoons playing and stills from some of my favourite Disney movies.\n\nIt’s worth a visit just to see it’s quirky external design, shiny staircase and ‘green wall’.\n\nOpen Mon-Sun 10am-8pm\n\nExhibition entry fee is usually €4\n\nhttps://caixaforum.es/es/madrid/home\n\nGeomineral Museum\n\nThe Geominero Museum has an insane collection of minerals, rocks and fossils from all across the different Spanish regions and former colonies, as well as from sites around the world.
