        "meta_description": "If you crave fashion and fabrics more than ice cream, then a visit to Museo del Traje is a must.  Madrid is home to a world renowned Fashion Week … but it is also home to a museum with a fascinating collection of over 160,000 pieces that range from Middle Age clothing up to the au courant styles of today.From a few extremely rare and fragile fragments of Coptic cloth to every little girl’s dream of a Cinderella dress; from flowing Grecian styled wedding gowns to the miniscule corseted waist ones of later years, Museo Traje is made for dreamers.  Men are definitely not ignored with the once dapper 18th century calf-length pants on display along with much more. Like your guy in a tux? There are a number of variations on display; always on the arm of a stunningly attired woman.There are also pieces from couture designers such as Versace, Dior, Chanel, Balenciaga, Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood and Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo, Isadora Duncan’s designer. Appropriate jewelry, undergarments, purses, gloves, shoes, furs and stoles, parasols – all the accessories imaginable – are on display with each period piece.Museo del Traje’s collection covers everything from royal wear to infant clothing; day and evening clothing to nursemaid and valet costumes through the ages.Founded in 2004, the museum is in a stunningly well designed modern building and surrounded by magnificent gardens.Museum hours of operation: Tuesday to Saturday: 9:30am - 7pm (19.00); Sundays and public holidays: 10am to 5pm (17.00).
