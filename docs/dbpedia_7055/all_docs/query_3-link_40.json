        "text": "THE PARODI COSTUME COLLECTION PRESENTS ITS LATEST EXHIBITION, MARGIELA: IN THE VOID, IN COLLABORATION WITH BYRONESQUE.\n\nOpens Dec 12th, 2023, until April 5th, 2024, at 276 NE 27th St, Miami, FL 33137, United States.\n\nBy appointment only, via: www.parodicostumecollection.com (VISITS menu); via Instagram @parodicostumecollection; or by email: appointments@parodicostumecollection.com\n\nStep into the enigmatic realm of ‘MARGIELA: IN THE VOID,’ a co-curated exhibition with the contemporary vintage brand, Byronesque. Delve into the essence of Margiela’s iconic pieces from the Parodi Costume Collection archives while unraveling the narrative surrounding the voids – the absent elements that complete full looks.\n\nAccessible to the public by appointment only until April 5th, 2024, this exhibition offers a privileged glimpse into the journey of museums acquiring complete vintage runway ensembles.\n\nWith a steadfast mission to illuminate the extraordinary creativity embedded in fashion history, visitors are encouraged to explore the narratives and theories underpinning these full looks as Parodi enriches its extensive archive. Across 13 of Martin Margiela’s seminal designs, artists and designers from diverse corners of the globe breathe life into the concept of voids.\n\nThe introduction, penned by Alexandre Samson, esteemed author of “Martin Margiela, the Women Collections,” and curator at the prestigious Palais Galliera, the Fashion Museum of Paris, delves into the myriad ways Martin Margiela filled creative voids within his oeuvre. Poignantly, the exhibition culminates with a poetic tribute to Martin, authored by Byronesque, serving as a fitting finale to the exploration of emptiness and essence within Margiela’s visionary creations.\n\nThe Parodi Costume Collection, conceived by Francisca Parodi in the mid-1960s, epitomizes a profound dedication to preserving, restoring, exhibiting, researching, and educating about the history of fashion design.\n\nOriginating from a rich private collection, this institution has blossomed into a comprehensive archive, showcasing fashion from the mid-1800s to the late 20th century. Spanning 3500 square feet of exhibition space, the collection actively collaborates with major universities and high schools, providing workshops, lectures, and internships, thus enriching the vibrant landscape of fashion education in Miami.\n\nWith a global outlook, the Parodi Costume Collection collaborates with esteemed institutions worldwide, lending pieces to renowned museums such as the Museo del Traje in Madrid, Spain, the Balenciaga Foundation in Getaria, Spain, and the SCAD Fashion Museum in Atlanta. Notable collaborations extend to the Balenciaga Archives and The Azzedine Alaia Foundation in Paris. Presently, the collection hosts exhibitions like ‘Margiela: In the Void’ for Winter 23-Spring 24 and plans to explore the works of Issey Miyake, Carolina Herrera, and a captivating 1960s showcase (featuring Cardin, Rabanne, Courreges) in Summer 2024.\n\nFor further information and updates on programming, please visit our Instagram page @parodicostumecollection or our website: www.parodicostumecollection.com.\n\nThe Parodi Costume Institute, the non-profit arm of the Parodi Costume Collection, drives all programming and educational activities.\n\nTogether, these entities serve as the central hub for interactive initiatives in the history of fashion design in Miami. The Institute conducts workshops, lectures, and collaborations, offering a comprehensive learning experience for students and enthusiasts alike. Their dedication to collection management, restoration skills, and exhibition staging fosters a dynamic environment for education and exploration.\n\nAbout Byronesque\n\nFounded in 2013, Byronesque is an editorial-based retail brand born out of a desire to counteract the banality and waste in fashion. Their mission is to modernize the past, preserve independent creativity, and advocate for environmental sustainability. Byronesque doesn’t cater to beginners nor does it aim to spoon-feed its audience. Instead, it tells stories and offers clothing for those who resist categorization.\n\nBeginning with punk ethos, Byronesque reissues overlooked and sought-after pieces with irreverence. They believe that age doesn’t necessarily equate to quality and their curation is uncompromising. Rejecting outdated nostalgia, Byronesque embraces an obscure connection to the past while championing a polarizing and enduring present. Their philosophy of ‘contemporary vintage’ ensures a future-proof approach to fashion.\n\nFor more information, visit Byronesque.com\n\nAll pictures by David Gary Lloyd @DavidGaryLloyd\n\nOther Parodi Costume Collection current collaborations to follow:\n\nJust opened last week: a collaboration with SCAD FASH, the Azzedine Alaia Foundation, and the Balenciaga Archives\n\n​It will be opened Feb 2: A collaboration with SCAD and curators Stefano Tonchi and Marta Franceschini."
