        "text": "Church of Santa Maria de Belém, Lisbon, Portugal\n\nThe church of Santa Maria de Belém originated from the expansion, ordered by Henry the Navigator in the 15th century, of a previous hermitage built on the site. The new church was trusted to the Order of Christ- of which Henry the Navigator was the Grand Master- to help the seamen that passed by Belém, as the hermitage had done before. In 1501, by order of King D. Manuel I, the Monastery of the Hieronymites started being built and the small church was totally remodelled in the Manueline and Renaissance styles. It was the king's wish that the church should become a pantheon for the dynasty (Avis-Beja) started by him, and that it continued to help the travellers passing through Belém. Like the Monastery, the church was significantly restored in the 19th century. Inside the church are the tombs of several historical figures: Luís de Camões, one of Portugal's greatest poets who lived in the 16th century, Vasco da Gama, the first navigator to go to India by sea, King D. Sebast\n\nThe Gates of Mdina, Malta\n\nMdina walls have three gates: the Mdina Gate, the Greeks Gate and the Gharreqin Gate. The Main Gate, also known as Vilhena gate, was built in 1724, under Grandmaster Antonio Manoel de Vilhena, who in 1722 ordered the renovation and restoration of Mdina. The courtyard behind the main gate was demolished to make way for the Vilhena Palace and a new gate had to be built, a few meters to the left of the old one, which was walled up. The Gate has reliefs of Saint Agatha, Saint Paul and Saint Publius, the three patron saints of Malta. The Greeks Gate is the oldest of the three Gates, dating back to medieval times. It was also renovated in 1724 when an outer portal was built in the baroque style. It is known as the Greeks Gate because a small community of Greeks once lived by the gate. For many years it was the only gate by which the slaves were allowed to enter Mdina. The Gharreqin Gate is the less known and most recent of the three Gates. It was excavated in the city\n\nCathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp, Belgium\n\nThe Cathedral of Our Lady was built on top of a small chapel, also dedicated to Our Lady, that existed from the 9th to the 12th century. In the 12th century, after acquiring the status of Parish, the chapel was replaced by a larger church. Construction of the Cathedral seen today, which would become the largest Gothic church in Belgium, started in 1352. It was finally completed in 1521 but in 1533 a fire destroyed it inside. In the next centuries, the church was several times damaged and plundered and it was only in the 19th century that it was completely restored and refurbished. It was also in the 19th century that three Rubens' masterpices, taken away by the French revolutionaries in 1794, were returned from Paris. The belfry of the cathedral is included in the Belfries of Belgium and France, classified as World Heritage by UNESCO. Opening hours: Mon. to Fri. 10 am to 5 pm; Sat 10 am to 3 pm; Sun. 1 pm to 4 pm Entrance fee: €6"
