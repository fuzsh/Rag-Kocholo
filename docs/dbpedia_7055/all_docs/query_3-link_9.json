        "text": "Dialogue of the past with the present\n\nAnother novelty that incorporates this new approach to the collection is to show the evolution of fashion through anachronistic leaps, to different moments in history. At the beginning of the show, we can see an Oteyza design that talks to the fashion of the Habsburgs of dark tones and solemnity. You can also see original bullfighting shoes in contrast to the work of Manolo Blahnik that shows a current reinterpretation with his flats created with the same colors of the capote.\n\nMuseum documentary and research center\n\nThe new configuration of the Museo del Traje not only invites the visitor to take a trip through the history of clothing in our country, but also to discover the important documentary collections that the museum has. The museum continues to hold the work of being the Ethnographic Heritage Research Center and has an extensive collection of books, toilets, brochures, artistic and advertising pieces that have come out of its warehouses so that all who come to know it can also discover them and also visit its library.\n\nAs the deputy director Paula Ramírez Jimeno explains, fashion has a lot to do with who we are, because we all dress and we can understand that dressing has many implications on how we represent ourselves and how we show ourselves to others.\n\nThis is the idea on which they have reflected and that has made this beautiful rethinking of the collection a way of helping the public to know the past and the present.Discover the new Costume Museum and start by taking a look in our photo gallery."
