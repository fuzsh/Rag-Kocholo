        "text": "This cultural instalation owes its name to one of Tijarafe’s favorite sons, who died prematurely in 1999. His selfless devotion to the preservation of local traditions was expressed most clearly in the traditional costumes of the island. In the museum, which is located on the second floor of the public library, traditional vestments from different municipalities are on display. The collections contains both the formal dress as well as the garments worn during agricultural labour and fishing. It should be noted that the exhibition is rotary, and that not all costumes are being shown at the same time.\n\nVirtual tour"
