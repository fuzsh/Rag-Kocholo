        "text": "The spread across Europe of the modes of dress adopted at the Spanish court was a major cultural phenomenon that reached its height between 1550 and 1650 as a result of the world hegemony enjoyed by the Habsburgs. This unique book is the first interdisciplinary study to examine the distinguishing features of Spanish fashion, as well as the various political, ceremonial and protocol factors that exported this model to the rest of the continent.\n\nSome thirty international experts guide readers through the history of costume and textiles during the period Spanish fashion enjoyed influence within and beyond the boundaries of the Spanish Monarchy. This profusely illustrated collection of essays makes a highly significant contribution to the study of the history of fashion in the West, as it analyses modes of dress at the Spanish court and the spread of the Spanish model to the European courts through historical and literary sources, pieces preserved in different countries’ museums and depictions of costume in portraits of the period.\n\nJosé Luis Colomer holds a doctorate in Comparative Literature from Bologna University and a degree in Art History from the Sorbonne. He currently directs the Centro de Estudios Europa Hispánica (CEEH) and the Center for Spain in America (CSA). His research is focused, among other subjects, on cultural relations between Spain and Italy in the seventeenth century."
