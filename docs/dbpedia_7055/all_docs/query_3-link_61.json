        "text": "In Madrid there are a variety of museums and exhibitions that represent the rich history as well as new trends and tendencies of the Spanish capital. Museums and exhibitions allow people both local and foreign to get to know different aspects of society and the world, proving to be a valuable resource of knowledge, artifacts and history.\n\nOf course, there are a variety of more typical museums in Madrid, such as those concerning history, art, music, science and film, but there are also more unique and original museums that are lesser-known.\n\nToday in this article from ShMadrid we want to let you get to know the most surprising and underground museums in the city that contain stunning, fascinating items and history. Everything has its own story and reason for existing, and these little-known museums in Madrid focus on the history of the uncommon and surprising.\n\nRelated article: Museum of Thyssen-Bornemisza\n\nIndex\n\nDiscover the city’s lesser-known museums\n\nMuseums can be an amazing resource to learn about a variety of different topics within the realm of culture, history, art, and innovation, and provide the opportunity to learn more about specific subjects that especially capture our interest. There is much to gain from visiting museums; they provide a sort of cultural revenue that deepens our understanding of the world around us, the history behind us and the future ahead.\n\nMuseo del Ferrocarril de Madrid\n\nThe invention of locomotion systems over the years are one topic of interest for many people, with transportation systems such as trains drawing in those with an affinity for engineering feats and projects throughout history.\n\nThe Museo del Ferrocarril de Madrid, or Madrid Railroad Museum, is an example of a museum with a very specific focus, geared towards those that are passionate about locomotion as well as those who are simply interested in learning more about Madrid’s engineering history.\n\nThe railroad museum houses a number of collections, permanent exhibitions, and temporary exhibits, as well as a fascinating historical archive that highlights featured pieces of railroad history.\n\nThe museum is located in the neighbourhood of Delicias.\n\nMuseo Cerralbo\n\nIf you are interested in architecture history and visiting beautiful buildings where you can admire the stunning interior design, then you won’t want to miss out on the Museo Cerralbo in the neighbourhood of Argüelles, originally an aristocratic home from the end of the 19th century that was fully redesigned at the start of the 21st century.\n\nIt belongs to the marquis of Cerralbo, Don Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa. The project lasted eight years, from 1885 to 1893 and was built by the architects Sureda and Cabello Asó and Cabella Asó’s son, Cabello Lapiedra, always protected and oriented by the demands of the marquis himself.\n\nRelated article: Scientific Museums in Madrid\n\nMuseo del Traje\n\nAnother Madrid museum that fits the description of unique historical focus is the Museo del Traje, or Costume Museum, a place that seeks to understand, preserve and teach about the collections of attire that they possess in their exhibitions.\n\nThis museum – in Moncloa-Aravaca – is ideal for people interested in fashion, as well as students and those interested in the history of fashion and attire and its influence over the centuries.\n\nMuseo del Romanticismo\n\nRomanticism isn’t limited to just romance films and the Venezuelan telenovelas. Nor is it limited just to those in relationships and who wish to express love for their partner.\n\nRomanticism was also a cultural movement that took place at the ends of the 18th century, whose main characteristic was the search for liberty and the breaking of stereotypical ideas that prevailed during the time period.\n\nYou can explore the history of this movement at the Museo del Romanticismo, or Romanticism Museum, founded by Benigno de la Vega Inclán, II marquis de la Vega Inclán.\n\nYou can visit this museum while you’re in the neighbourhood of Chueca.\n\n*Main photo by Son of Groucho via VisualHunt"
