Plus, there’s also an extensive Salvador Dalí collection, featuring his most famous paintings like those dripping clocks, alongside many paintings by Joan Miró.\n\nMuseo Thyssen-Bornemisza\n\nMuseum\n\nThe Thyssen Museum has a fancy permanent collection, featuring works by Caravaggio, Rubens and Rembrandt as well as many cool special exhibits that change throughout the year. Much of the collection is actually private, owned by the Baroness Thyssen.\n\nMuseo Sorolla\n\nMuseum\n\nHoused in the former mansion of the artist Joaquín Sorolla, the Museo Sorolla gives a beautiful glimpse into the painter’s works and life. The little outdoor garden is a charming place to breathe in the scents of spring.\n\nMuseo Arqueológico Nacional: MAN\n\nMuseum\n\nThe Museo Arqueológico Nacional, also know as the MAN, recently underwent a huge renovation and has an enormous space dedicated to the famous prehistoric Cuevas de Altamira.
