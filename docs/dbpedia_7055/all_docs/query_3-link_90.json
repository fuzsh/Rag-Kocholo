        "text": "I hadn’t heard of the filmÂ The Liberator until I came across that image of actress MarÃ­a Valverde (The Limehouse Golem, The Load, Exodus: Gods and Kings) — who I’ve recently developed a crush on — wearing a dress recycled fromÂ Marie Antoinette (2006) and a crapton of flowers on her hat… and once I saw that pic, I knew I had to check it out! I’m ashamed to say I didn’t actually know anything about SimÃ³n BolÃ­var, theÂ Venezuelan military and political leader who led Venezuela,Â Bolivia,Â Colombia,Â Ecuador,Â Peru, andÂ PanamaÂ to independence from theÂ Spanish Empire. In the end, I think I enjoyed the film more for BolÃ­var (played by hottie ÃdgarÂ RamÃ­rez) and learning a history I didn’t know than for the costumes, but the costumes were nicely done, even if I have a few fabric and period quibbles.\n\nThe film starts withÂ BolÃ­var meeting his wife,Â Maria Teresa RodrÃ­guez del Toro, in Spain, then bringing her back to Venezuela. Sadly she dies not too long after their marriage, and then BolÃ­var travels to France and eventually gets politically and militarily involved in the independence movement. Everyone puts on good performances, there aren’t TOO many battle scenes, and all in all, it’s an interesting and enjoyable watch.\n\nThe costumes were designed byÂ Sonia Grande (Magic in the Moonlight,Â Midnight in Paris,Â A Matador’s Mistress), and overall I thought they were well done.\n\nThe men are in late 18th-century/early 19th-century frock coats, with the giant collars of the era. There’s a nice range of classes shown on screen:\n\nFor the ladies, I definitely enjoyed what I saw on screen, with a few quibbles — the main one being thatÂ BolÃ­var goes to Spain in 1799, where he courts Maria for two years, and the two marry in 1802.Â BolÃ­var meets Maria AT court, playing tennis with the king, and the court ladies are dressed in 1780s costumes:\n\nWhat should they be wearing? Here’s a mix of various images of very late 1790s Spanish upper-class women’s wear:\n\nAnd what about that totally gorgeous, excessively floral hat?\n\nHere’s a few other extras, just to give you an overall look at the scene:\n\nSome more courting happens in what-is-the-same-time-period, and Maria wears an outfit that made me 75% happy:\n\nBecause what she’s wearing is called “maja” dress. As I wrote in my review of El Ministerio del Tiempo, “The majo (men) and maja (women) were a very typical and unique look worn by the working/lower classes, particularly in Madrid. For women, thereâs a lot of jackets, and details on the sleeves. It was an over-the-top look that was very swagger-y.”\n\nAs it became tied to a sense of Spanish nationalism, upper-class women and men sometimes embraced it, particularly for fancy dress:\n\nThe short spencer jacket over the longer corseted figure is something I’ve seen in southern French regional dress, so I can imagine it extending to Spain:\n\nWhat doesn’t work is the fabric, which is SO modern chinoiserie:\n\nThe ball fringe snood is a current style of “traditional Spanish dress,” called a “mantilla madronos,” which appears to date to at least the late 19th century:\n\nThe ball fringe WAS a frequent design element of maja dress:\n\nBut all of the images I’ve looked at of late 18th/early 19th century show women in maja dress wearing bags made of fabric, not pompoms:\n\nI have now spent way too long researching and writing this post, so now I’m going to get a little less in-depth. BolÃ­var and Maria arrive in South America, and suddenly Maria’s wardrobe has realized it’s the 19th century:\n\nLater she gets confused, wearing this sort of art nouveau number with yet another super-modern print:\n\nLater in the film, BolÃ­var hooks up withÂ Manuela SÃ¡enz, an Ecuadoran revolutionary who seems pretty badass. She starts off in standard “Regency” wear, with a great shawl:\n\nAnd later gets to wear a man’s suit, which looks fabulous on her:\n\nCheck out The Liberator, you’ll be glad you did!"
