        "text": "MADRID | Unless you’re enrolled in summer school at the Complutense University, you might not otherwise find yourself strolling about the campus periphery at the northern end of Avenida Princesa where Madrid’s fabulous costume and fashion museum, the Museo del Traje (Avenuida Juan de Herrera 2; 34-91-550-4700; museodeltraje.mcu.es) is located. Since opening in 2004, the museum has been such a critical success that both locals and visitors alike have found their way to it. It’s a pity, then, that the government has recently decided to shut the museum down by 2013, find a new location, and reconfigure the collection for seems like the umpteenth time in the museum’s 80-year history.\n\nBut while the recession slows down such drastic measures for the moment, the summer is a great time to visit the museum, particularly on Thursday evenings, when it stays open until 10:30 p.m., through the end of August. Admission is free on these evenings and the lush tree-shaded garden that surrounds the museum offers cooling breezes, cold beers from the museum cafe, and a soundtrack of tweeting birds. Those with deeper pockets can also book a table on the terrace at Bokado, among the city’s finest eateries.\n\nBut the real draws are in the galleries, starting with a permanent collection that takes in the sweep of fashion history from early tunics, doublets, and delicately embroidered accessories of the 16th century through the French influence of the Bourbon and Napoleonic eras of the 18th and 19th centuries, up to great 20th-century couturiers like Fortuny, Balenciaga, and Dior, and finally contemporary designers like Montana and Miyake.\n\nThe museum features hands-on fabric displays and clever body-distorting mirrors and also offer the opportunity to try on modern reproductions of corsets, hoops skirts, clunky boots, and the like making it fun destination for anyone traveling with kids.\n\nTwo current exhibitions have also been a big hit. The first, “Stiletto Heels: Charm and Fascination,” on view through August 30, traces the evolution of spike heels from their birth in the early 1950s in the town of Vigevano, Italy, and reveals that just about anything designers might want to do with a shoe had already been done in the town of Vigevano by 1960. The craftsmanship and mechanics of these early heels (a bit of aluminum was the trick in keeping the wooden heels from breaking) are extraordinary.\n\nThe second exhibition, “100% 20th Century” is an indulgent run through the museum’s closet of 20th-century couture, from Paul Poiret to Tom Ford. It remains on view through January 3, 2010."
