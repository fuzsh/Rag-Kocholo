In 1924, Bix and a group of musicians known as the Wolverines Orchestra recorded their first music at a small studio in Richmond, IN named Gennett Records. As the recording branch of the Starr Piano Company, this studio produced some of the earliest recordings by music greats such as Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, and Hoagy Carmichael, and produced for others such as Jelly Roll Morton, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Charley Patton, and Gene Autry. Join Dr. Charlie Dahan and Bob Jacobsen as they discuss the little-known history of this important company and its mark on American culture.\n\nDr. Charlie Dahan is a professor in the Recording Industry Department at Middle Tennessee State University. He has co-authored two books on Gennett Records, including the soon-to-be-released discography through UCSB’s Discography of American Historical Records and three successful National Register for Historic Places nominations: FAME Studios, Hank Snow’s Rainbow Ranch, and the King Records Buildings. His book Don’t Lose Your Good Thing: Saving America’s Historic Recording Places will be released by SUNY Press in 2024. He serves on the boards of the King Records Legacy Foundation, the Starr-Gennett Foundation (Advisory), and Sweet Relief Musicians Fund. Previously he was the A&R Director at Shanachie Records and a talent agent with the Roots Agency.\n\nBob Jacobsen is the former President and current board member of the Starr-Gennett Foundation and has lived in Richmond since 1986. He has spent his life studying the history of Richmond and the importance of the Starr Piano Company in his community and the history of American music. As a fan of Bix and Hoagy Carmichael, Bob is an advocate for the legacy of these musicians and all of the Gennett Records Walk of Fame inductees that the Starr-Gennett Foundation maintains.\n\nView Event →\n\nKirkwood Community College Tours\n\nThe Bix Museum is hosting a private tour for a group from Kirkwood Community College\n\nView Event →\n\nBix Beiderbecke Birthday Party\n\nWhen: Sunday, March 12th, 3:00-5:30 pm\n\nWhere: Columbus Club, 1111 W 35th St., Davenport, IA\n\nCost: Free admittance; optional dinner $10\n\nThe Catfish Jazz Society with a grant from the QC Plus 60 Club and in collaboration with the Bix Jazz Society and Bix Beiderbecke Museum presents Alan Knapper's Five Bridges Jazz Band playing two special sets to celebrate Bix's 120th birthday.

Since the release of his debut trio album, Instead (4 stars, Downbeat), Rosenblum has toured extensively with his trio and sextet throughout the United States, including multiple trips to the Northeast, Midwest, South and West Coast, as well as internationally in Canada, Europe and Japan. He was a featured soloist at Carnegie Hall's Stern-Perelman Auditorium – with Reona Ito's New York Harmonic Band – and has appeared at prestigious venues throughout the world, including at the Appel Room at Lincoln Center, Kuumbwa Jazz Center, Ravinia, Himawari-No-Sato Concert Hall in Yokohama, Bird's Eye in Basel and the Library of Congress. Rosenblum's second trio album in 2018, River City, was called “richly romantic” and “well-realized” by JAZZIZ Magazine, which featured the title track as part of their Best of Fall 2018 CD. Most recently, Rosenblum released his third album, Kites and Strings, which is the first to feature him on both piano and accordion alongside his new sextet, the Nebula Project. In 2020, the Nebula Project was voted runner-up for Best New Artist in JazzTimes' Readers' Poll. Rosenblum has been privileged to share the stage with many highly acclaimed jazz musicians, including extensive work with Curtis Lundy, Winard Harper, Deborah Davis and Chris Washburne, as well as appearances with Bobby Watson, Sean Jones, TS Monk, Warren Wolf, Eliot Zigmund, and many others. Rosenblum's musical interests also extend beyond jazz to include work in numerous world music scenes, including musical styles from Brazil, Peru, Croatia, Bulgaria, India, Ireland, Jewish traditions and more.\n\nCOMMON CHORD POLICIES:\n\n*Ticket Disclaimer*\n\nAll tickets for Common Chord events are sold via Eventbrite and carry applicable transaction fees.

He was 28.\n\nUsing archival photographs and rare footage (including the three sole momentary fragments capturing Bix on film) and interviews with friends and colleagues (including jazz greats Hoagy Carmichael, Doc Cheatham, Artie Shaw, et al.), Oscar® winner Brigitte Berman's acclaimed documentary paints a vivid portrait of a vanished era and brings to life the only trumpeter Louis Armstrong regarded as an equal (the quotation in the film's title was once spoken by Armstrong).\n\nRestored in 4K in 2020 by filmmaker Brigitte Berman.\n\n\"The best film ever made about a jazz musician.\"\n\n- Bruce Goldstein, Director of Repertory Programming, Film Forum\n\n*Ticket Disclaimer*\n\nTickets for this event are sold via Eventbrite and carry applicable transaction fees.

They have also played numerous festivals across Iowa and the Midwest, and are highly sought after for larger private events in the Des Moines area. The band also continues to build their reputation regionally and across the U.S.\n\nBand members have shared the stage with jazz greats and have been inducted into the Iowa Jazz and Rock & Roll Halls of Fame. They have also played at well-known Jazz clubs such as Spotted Cat in New Orleans and the Iridium and Smalls in New York City. Recent musical groups and artists the band has played with include:\n\nDavina & the Vagabonds (Minneapolis)\n\nBria Skonberg – rising star jazz trumpet player and singer (New York City)\n\nMarla Dixon and The Shotgun Jazz Band (New Orleans)\n\nDom Flemons – bluegrass/roots/Americana artist, formerly of the Carolina Chocolate Drops\n\nAll band members have a common love for the “feel” of both traditional and current New Orleans based music – real, gutsy, raw, heartfelt, and entertaining. The band truly enjoys playing this fun music together and sees their audiences as part of their “family living room experience” for each performance.\n\nThe NOLA Jazz Band loves to expose audiences to this traditional jazz music, its history, and emotion. One of the best compliments we’ve received from a number of audience members is “I don’t find myself liking jazz – however I LOVE whatever it is that you play!” Yes we’ve actually heard that same quote many times and it warms our hearts to know people truly enjoy our playing. Just as traditional jazz was built on collaboration and diversity so is our band. The eight members of the band are represented by five generations ranging from their early 20s to mid-60s – each with their own unique experiences and musical talents.\n\nThe Band released their first album in March, 2016 – NOLA Jazz Band Vol. 1 “Genesis – Live from the ARK”.

Despite this, one of the most influential jazz musicians of the early 20th century, Bix Beiderbecke, grew up here. A question that gets asked is how could a small river city like Davenport raise such a significant figure in American history unless by coincidence. Perhaps Davenport was the perfect place for a young musician to thrive all along. Bix Museum Director Nathaniel Kraft dives into the history of Davenport, Bix's childhood, and what connection the Mississippi River could have in the meteoric rise of America's young man with a horn.\n\nDate: Thursday, April 7, 2022\n\nTime: 6:30pm - 8:00pm\n\nLocation: 3000 N Fairmount St, Davenport, IA 52804\n\nThis program is best suited for adults. Seating is limited so registration is required. This program is offered in person or virtually. Masks are recommended at the library. Please observe social distancing and follow local COVID-19 safety recommendations. This program is subject to COVID-19 safety protocol updates.

They have also played numerous festivals across Iowa and the Midwest, and are highly sought after for larger private events in the Des Moines area. The band also continues to build their reputation regionally and across the U.S.\n\nBand members have shared the stage with jazz greats and have been inducted into the Iowa Jazz and Rock & Roll Halls of Fame. They have also played at well-known Jazz clubs such as Spotted Cat in New Orleans and the Iridium and Smalls in New York City. Recent musical groups and artists the band has played with include:\n\nDavina & the Vagabonds (Minneapolis)\n\nBria Skonberg – rising star jazz trumpet player and singer (New York City)\n\nMarla Dixon and The Shotgun Jazz Band (New Orleans)\n\nDom Flemons – bluegrass/roots/Americana artist, formerly of the Carolina Chocolate Drops\n\nAll band members have a common love for the “feel” of both traditional and current New Orleans based music – real, gutsy, raw, heartfelt, and entertaining. The band truly enjoys playing this fun music together and sees their audiences as part of their “family living room experience” for each performance.\n\nThe NOLA Jazz Band loves to expose audiences to this traditional jazz music, its history, and emotion. One of the best compliments we’ve received from a number of audience members is “I don’t find myself liking jazz – however I LOVE whatever it is that you play!” Yes we’ve actually heard that same quote many times and it warms our hearts to know people truly enjoy our playing. Just as traditional jazz was built on collaboration and diversity so is our band. The eight members of the band are represented by five generations ranging from their early 20s to mid-60s – each with their own unique experiences and musical talents.\n\nThe Band released their first album in March, 2016 – NOLA Jazz Band Vol. 1 “Genesis – Live from the ARK”. CD’s are available at shows, online at iTunes and CD Baby as well as streaming on Spotify. Their second CD “NOLA Jazz Band – Fat Tuesday LIVE” will be coming out in fall 2018.\n\nDoors: 6pm / Show: 7pm\n\nOpening Act: None\n\nAge Restriction: All Ages\n\nCost: $15.00 - $60.00\n\nWeb: https://www.nolajazzband.org/\n\nGenre: Jazz\n\nAll tickets are general admission.
