        "text": "You don't achieve icon status with unanimity.\n\nThe biggest legends in this Timeless Tickets series have been polarizers. Bands worth picketing outside for. Songwriters worth defending in a stiff letter to the editor.\n\nThey say history is written by the winners. But music history has just as often been written by those willing to lose. In the early '90s, there was no genre more prominent than grunge. And grunge bands were so anti-fame that they were practically begging to lose.\n\nNot quite punk, not quite metal, not quite pop, but somewhere in between, the scene rose from the Pacific northwest in the late-'80s and took a 100-meter sprint into the cultural zeitgeist.\n\nBy 1993, grunge was everywhere, even if it didn't want to be. So of course, there were critics. They pointed out the obscenity in the lyrics and the non-political nihilism. They parodied the outfits: flannel shirts, baggy tees, black, black and more black.\n\nWe've heard the story before. The new guard takes over, the old guard takes offense. And the new guard, Nirvana, came to Davenport to play a show at Palmer Auditorium on October 22, 1993.\n\nHere we are now, entertain us\n\nAt that time, Nirvana was arguably the most important band in the world.\n\nThey were two years removed from then-quadruple-platinum album \"Nevermind.\" They had just released \"In Utero,\" which was, by all forecasts, on its way to similar success. And they were relentlessly touring the country.\n\nOn that October night, the Moline Dispatch called it the biggest punk show to ever hit the Quad-Cities. The show started at 7:30 p.m. and tickets sold for $18.50 ran out of stock.\n\nBut isn't a sold-out punk show an oxymoron? Local reviewers pointed that out. Apparently the band did, too.\n\n\"(Bass guitarist Krist) Novoselic played the wry commentator, mocking fans for throwing their shirts at the stage in acts of homage,\" wrote Moline Dispatch reviewer Amy Argetsinger. \"He introduced their first big hit, the over-played 'Smells Like Teen Spirit,' as 'the soundtrack of our new infomercial.'\"\n\nBehind Novoselic was drummer Dave Grohl. In front of him, the Seattle group was led by enigmatic frontman Kurt Cobain, a mysterious and skilled guitarist with a slacker façade and a penchant for stirring controversy.\n\n\"The guys in the band ... are studies in dysfunction,\" wrote Finn Bullers in the Quad-City Times.\n\nBullers was a bit more cynical about the concert. He called the band an \"acquired taste\" and the concert a \"bizarre trip.\" He examined the crowd, harkening back to the pop days of old to recognize how far music (and fashion) had come.\n\n\"Steve and Eydie's fans may have thought Halloween came early if they were at Friday's show,\" Bullers wrote. \"There were shaved heads, nose earrings, bare male chests and tattoos on these folks — all stomping around in a soupy mix of cigarette butts and spilled beer.\"\n\nNirvana played songs like \"In Bloom,\" \"Rape Me,\" \"Come As You Are\" and \"Lithium.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nThe opening bands for the show were Mudhoney and Jawbreaker. The former: a fellow Seattle hardcore band with a cult following of their own. The latter: an early catalyst for the rising genre of emo, which will see its mainstream heyday begin a decade later with acts like blink-182.\n\nLife after Cobain\n\nBut Nirvana was the crowd-drawer. All discussion of their fame — and of their peers, Pearl Jam — was had with permanence.\n\n\"Sales suggest Pearl Jam, Nirvana aren't flashes in the pan,\" read the headline on a Billboard-syndicated story that ran in the Quad-City Times in 1993.\n\nIn the story, rock radio stations predicted grunge's demise. But they insisted Nirvana were exceptions. They were forever.\n\n\"You can refer to any trend when there are a batch of artists that are momentarily successful, but only a couple emerge with the quality and depth to sustain a career after the trend has gone away,\" Geffen Records head of marketing Robert Smith told Billboard.\n\nBut all discussion of grunge changed six months later, in April 1994, when Cobain died in an apparent suicide.\n\nThe man dubbed the voice of a generation became the news story of a generation. Cultural critics labeled the day of his death as a \"where were you when\" moment. But even in death, Cobain was divisive.\n\n\"Unfortunately for Kurt, stupid was the word, and his dues were paid in full,\" concluded Phillip Terzian, in a syndicated column published in the Quad-City Times opinion section.\n\nA Davenport psychologist rebutted in the next week's paper: \"...suicides can be prevented and treated. Calling it stupid renders it uninteresting or untouchable — thus uncurable.\"\n\nConversations like this were had in cities across America. But music moved on.\n\nIn the underground, audio engineer Steve Albini — who produced Nirvana's final album \"In Utero\" — helped shape the future of indie rock, all the way up until his passing this week at the age of 61.\n\nIn the rock mainstream, grunge gave way to post-grunge, which gave way to pop-punk, which is back again now.\n\nStill, the prognosticators were right about a few grunge acts surviving the fall. The Smashing Pumpkins played to thousands in Moline in 1996, at the Quad-Cities' brand new venue The MARK, which opened in 1993. Grohl founded the Foo Fighters, who played the arena in 2000. Pearl Jam also played The MARK, decades later in 2014.\n\nAnd in many ways, Cobain's mythology somehow grew posthumously. The singer was treated like a martyr for rock and roll. Artists like Neil Young, Jay-Z and Sheryl Crow invoked Cobain's name in lyrics.\n\nHe was named the last true rockstar and the latest member of the \"27 Club,\" a list of gone-too-young celebs like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. There were books, essays and documentaries written about his influence. There will certainly be more.\n\nIt's true, history is written by those with something to lose. But even more often, it's written about those who were lost.\n\nThis story is part of a series called \"Timeless Tickets,\" where we're aiming to find the most notable concert in the Quad-Cities, every year from 1960 to today.
