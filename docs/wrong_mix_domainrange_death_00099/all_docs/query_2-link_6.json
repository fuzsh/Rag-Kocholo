        "text": "30 Years Ago Today: Nirvana Plays Final Concert 30 years ago today, Nirvana took the stage for what turned out to be the last time.\n\nOn March 1st, 1994, the band played a 23-song set at Terminal 1 in Munich, Germany. The show didn’t go well – Kurt Cobain had been dealing with a bout of bronchitis, and the power briefly went out during “Come As You Are”.\n\nNirvana would end up canceling the rest of their European tour due to Cobain’s health issues. A little over a month later, on April 5th, Cobain was found dead by suicide at his home in Seattle. What would Nirvana’s career have looked like if Cobain hadn’t died? What would he be doing now?"
