Born in Davenport, Iowa into an upper middle-class family, Beiderbecke became a legend even in his short lifetime, bringing an amazing new energy and unprecedented maturity to the music and influencing generations of musicians. After years of battling alcoholism, Bix died in Sunnyside, Queens on August 6, 1931. The cause of death was given as lobar pneumonia. He was 28.\n\nUsing archival photographs and rare footage (including the three sole momentary fragments capturing Bix on film) and interviews with friends and colleagues (including jazz greats Hoagy Carmichael, Doc Cheatham, Artie Shaw, et al.), Oscar® winner Brigitte Berman's acclaimed documentary paints a vivid portrait of a vanished era and brings to life the only trumpeter Louis Armstrong regarded as an equal (the quotation in the film's title was once spoken by Armstrong).\n\nRestored in 4K in 2020 by filmmaker Brigitte Berman.\n\n\"The best film ever made about a jazz musician.\"\n\n- Bruce Goldstein, Director of Repertory Programming, Film Forum\n\n*Ticket Disclaimer*\n\nTickets for this event are sold via Eventbrite and carry applicable transaction fees.
