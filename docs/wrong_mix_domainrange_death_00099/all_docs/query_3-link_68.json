        "text": "After the shocking news that Soundgarden lead singer Chris Cornell hung himself in Room 1136 at the MGM Grand Detroit after playing a sold-out show at the Fox Theatre, the hotel was flooded with calls.\n\nFans wanted to book the room.\n\nRelated:\n\nChris Cornell’s family plans public memorial for fans\n\nChris Cornell's final performance: Something clearly wasn’t right\n\nChris Cornell dies in Detroit, leaves behind rich rock legacy\n\nThat won't be happening in the near future, according to hotel officials grappling with publicity in the aftermath of Cornell's death.\n\nRegardless, Cornell’s death — now a part of Detroit music history — brings to the city a new avenue of dark tourism, a burgeoning area of travel that centers on the macabre.\n\nFrom natural disasters to the death trail of serial killers, dark tourism borders curiosity, morbidity and exploitation.\n\n“Ghost and sinister history tour offerings have exploded in recent years and are popular worldwide,” says Karin Risko, director of City Tour Detroit. “Detroit is a latecomer to this genre, which is surprising, considering Detroit is older than the also French-founded New Orleans, considered by many to be the most haunted city in the United States, and we've had more than our share of tragedies and misfortunes.”\n\nRisko's company offers the Notorious 313 Sinister History Tour, which rivals the regular city tours in popularity.\n\nShe says Cornell’s death may be an inclusion this year.\n\n\"While I try not to cover recent tragedies on the Notorious 313 tours out of respect for surviving family members, I do deviate from this if the death or tragic incident is high-profile in nature, which Chris Cornell's death is.”\n\nBut whether the room, cited in a police report obtained by the Detroit News, will be available is unclear. Initially, MGM corporate declined to comment on it.\n\nOn Monday, the Free Press called the hotel front desk and requested to book Room 1136 and was granted the reservation. But a reporter trying to check in the following afternoon was told the room was unavailable and was offered a different room instead. A front desk representative said the room could not be guaranteed at any time.\n\nIt is not unusual for hotels to keep unavailable rooms where celebrities have died. When singer Whitney Houston was found dead in her hotel suite at the Beverly Hilton, the room was taken out of rotation following requests from guests and fans to stay there.\n\nIt was eventually reinstated, but with new furnishings and content.\n\n'An enduring fascination'\n\nMany big cities like Seattle and Detroit offer ghost and similar dark tourism tours, for which people visit paranormal and tragic landmarks.\n\n“There would appear to be an enduring fascination we have as humans in the evil we are capable of a species,” says professor John Lennon of Glasgow Caledonian University, who is an expert and lecturer in the matter. “This is not a new phenomenon; there are elements of the ancient, modern and post-modern here.”\n\nSites like concentration camps, he says, attract a large number of visitors annually. “Visitors stare fixedly at evidence of the very worst we are capable of.”\n\nIn Seattle, for instance, a popular dark tourism site is a former gambling den in Chinatown where 13 Chinese Americans were killed.\n\nAnother Seattle tour, Stalking Seattle, revisits grunge landmarks and history, including that of Soundgarden. A stop includes Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's former house, where he was found dead above his garage, which is no longer there.\n\nWhat draws fans to visit spots connected to their favorite artists, but also sadness and death?\n\n“That’s how they can get as close as possible to that rock star of theirs who meant so much to them, and was singing directly to them,” says Charity Drewery, operator and owner of Stalking Seattle. “A lot of these people never saw Nirvana live, but they remember seeing Kurt’s house on MTV (after he died). It’s these things you see on TV and where these people you admire have been.”\n\nMost people who take her tour, she says, are from outside of the Puget Sound area — people who are traveling and taking time during their trips to see these landmarks. In the summer, Stalking Seattle tours are often sold-out months in advance.\n\nInterest is growing\n\nWhile many cities around the world, like older European cities, have offered such tours for decades, Detroit’s pocket of dark tourism is still developing but on the rise.\n\nFamous dark tourism spots include Historic Ft. Wayne, which offers guided tours of places where soldiers and servants have passed away. The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant has ghost tours around Halloween, and there are a number of cemetery tours that explore the likes of Elmwood and Woodlawn.\n\nOften, people explore Detroit cemeteries on their own because of their historic nature and architecture.\n\nThe Leland Hotel, where people claim to experience paranormal activity — especially around the abandoned fourth floor — also draws guests hoping to experience something out of the ordinary. When mobster Jimmy Hoffa disappeared, crews searched the basement for his body.\n\nSame goes for Detroit’s Masonic Temple. Many times, dark tourism is an attempt to witness a spirit or experience the environment surrounding a person or group’s final moments.\n\nThen there’s the myth of the Nain Rouge, or “red dwarf,” which people claim to have spotted before tragic events in Detroit. It is said to haunt the city. Nain Rouge supposedly was spotted before the 1805 fire, which destroyed most of the city, before the 1763 Battle of Bloody Run and before the 1967 riot/rebellion. The story has prompted the tradition of the Marche du Nain Rouge, where Detroiters gather to “banish” the evil creature.\n\nOutside of Detroit, dark tourism brings people to the Traverse City State Hospital, a former psychiatric asylum, Mackinac Island — which has a stark history — and the historic Holly Hotel.\n\nRoyal Oak resident Jessica Knapik is a fan of dark tourism and has traveled throughout the country visiting sites. So far, she has visited the Villisca Axe Murder House in Iowa, the Lizzie Borden Bed & Breakfast in Massachusetts and the haunted Mount Washington Hotel in New Hampshire, among other places.\n\nKnapik has also done several \"escapes\" and weekend trips.\n\n\"I definitely gravitate toward offbeat or haunted places,\" she says. \"Why sit in a bar or restaurant you've been to a million times when you could get the adrenaline rush or thrill of touring a place that is possibly haunted.\"\n\nWhile the MGM Grand is the latest site to spark interest in dark tourism, the city is no stranger to celebrity deaths.\n\nIn 1926, illusionist and stunt performer Harry Houdini was said to give one of his final performances at the Majestic Theater on Halloween, making the venue another dark tourism landmark. The performance was actually at the Garrick Theatre, but fans still gravitate toward the Majestic."
