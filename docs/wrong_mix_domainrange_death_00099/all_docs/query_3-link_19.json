By January 1994, they settled on a 90-year-old home with a gated entrance overlooking Seattle's Lake Washington that they purchased for just under $1.5 million. But no one would have a chance to move in. That February, Cobain and Nirvana embarked on a European tour while Love temporarily stayed at a hotel in Los Angeles before joining him in Rome. And by April, when Cobain escaped to the house for solitude, the family still had yet to move in. But when he killed himself on the property days later, the house and the adjacent park became a shrine to his memory — despite never having lived there.
