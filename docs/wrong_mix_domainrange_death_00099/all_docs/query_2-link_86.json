        "text": "after Nirvana ended, Nirvana's bassist and co-founder is doing something new: launching a new political party.\n\n\"I've always been a music fan,\" said Nirvana co-founder Krist Novoselic. \"I would listen to eight-track tapes with my dad since I can remember, and I would listen to all the great rock-and-roll music.\n\n\"Then I started making music, and then we started this band, and it was called 'Nirvana,' and we just wanted to make music and not be mainstream to do something new and something different,\" Novoselic continued. \"We took the influences that we grew up with, and we made this new kind of music.\"\n\nNovoselic said Nirvana's history mirrors the goals of his new\n\n\"It's not just a run-of-the-mill party,\" Novoselic said. \"We're trying to do something different we're trying to be seminal, we're trying to break ground I'm also looking for something like that.\"\n\nNovoselic said he's the party chair and part of the requirements to have a party is to host conventions and run a presidential ticket. To draw people to those conventions, he tapped his resources and started a new band called \"The Bona Fide Band.\"\n\n\"Need to get 1,000 valid signatures to qualify as a bona fide party, so these shows are actually political conventions, but there's not going to be hardly any speeches from the stage,\" said Novoselic. \"We're not going to go up there and clobber people with a bunch of rhetoric. Basically please sign the petition if you want to see a new party in Washington State.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to the presidential ticket, Novoselic is trying to get the rule changed.\n\n\"At this point, the rules say that we need to have a presidential ticket,\" he said. \"We're determined not to be on the 2024 ballot and if that takes litigation we've got it all lined up.\"\n\nWe've done the research and we have the course of law behind us this is for speech, there's no statutory authority for this rule,\" Novoselic added. \"That's another accomplishment that the Cascade Party seeks to do is to get rid of this rule. If this rule is gone then we've done a service to the voters in the state of Washington.\"\n\nThe Bona Fide band's first show is on June 20th at Easy Street Records in West Seattle. Then on June 21, the Bona Fide Band will play at World Music Day in Aberdeen.\n\n\"It's moving,\" said Novoselic. \"I'm really looking forward to playing in Aberdeen and that's on June 21st on World Music Day. We're just going to make music and try to make people happy and entertain people.\"\n\n\"If it brings back memories and feelings for people, that's the magic of music,\" he added. \"We're not going to contaminate that with politics. We're not going to make these political speeches.\"\n\nThis year of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain.\n\n\"It's bittersweet,\" Novoselic said when asked what it's like looking back on that time of his life. \"When I think of when 'Nevermind' came out in 1991 and when Kurt died in 1994, that was like three years. It seems like that time span was 10 years there was so much going on it was so intense and then the way it ended it was devastating.\"\n\n\"There are the blessings: the music,\" Novoselic added. \"The band just keeps getting more popular and there are Nirvana t-shirts everywhere. It's amazing.\"\n\nOn the anniversary of Cobain's death, Novoselic said he connected with former band members and Cobain's daughter, Frances."
