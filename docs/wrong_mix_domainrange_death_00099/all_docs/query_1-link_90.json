There’s just something so wholesome about it.”\n\nKurt Cobain interview with Kurt Saint Thomas\n\nWho knows how long this will last\n\nNow we’ve come so far, so fast\n\nBut, somewhere back there in the dust\n\nThat same small town in each of us\n\nThe End of the Innocence\n\nWritten by Don Henley and Bruce Hornsby\n\nI always enjoy hearing from people who’ve been to the top of the mountain. Their experiences and stories help give one perspective on life. Just a few months before Rod Serling died he was asked, “If you could live in another time, another era, what period would that be?”\n\n“That’s a good one. Well, if I had the means, I think I would like to be in Victorian times. Small town. Bandstands. Summer. That kind of thing. Without disease. I think that’s what I would crave, a simpler form of existence. When you walked to a store and sat on the front porch.”\n\nRod Serling\n\nRod Serling’s Final Interview\n\nRelated posts:\n\nRod Serling’s Binghamton Roots\n\nMovies from Main Street\n\nScott W.

Soon, everybody be singing to chase away those blues.”\n\nJames “T-Model” Ford\n\nWhen I was a little bitty baby\n\nMy mama would rock me in the cradle\n\nIn them old cotton fields back home\n\nCotton Fields by Lead Belly\n\nYou may have never seen cotton fields in the south, or heard of Huddie Ledbetter—who is better known as Lead Belly. But the two came together in 1940 when Lead Belly recorded a song he wrote called Cotton Fields. As you can see from the links below the song found its way into the world via a variety of musicians including Johnny Cash, The Beach Boys, Harry Belafonte, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Elvis— along with Lead Belly’s original version.\n\nLead Belly was a blues musician born in 1888 on a plantation in Louisiana. He was one of those great musicians that led a tumultuous life. One that included prison time, as well as playing in clubs in New York City. Lead Belly died in 1949, but his influence has carried on well after his death. Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain said Lead Belly was his favorite performer just before playing Lead Belly’s Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Cotton Fields was featured on the TV programs The Muppet Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, and in the movies Elvis: That’s the Way It Is and Cool Hand Luke.\n\nAnd for what it’s worth, I didn’t take that cotton field photo above in Mississippi or Louisiana, but outside Mobile, Alabama.\n\nScott W.
