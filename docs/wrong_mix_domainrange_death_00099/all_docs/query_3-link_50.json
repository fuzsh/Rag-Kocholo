        "text": "In May 2021, more than 27 years after the death of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, the FBI released a 10-page file that included letters from fans urging the agency to investigate Cobain's death as a possible homicide. The FBI concluded, \"We are unable to identify any violation of federal law within the investigative jurisdiction of the FBI,\" adding that, \"Most homicide/death investigations generally fall within the jurisdiction of state and local authorities.\"\n\nThe Seattle Police Department, which ran the case, actually did re-examine the evidence in the music star's death investigation back in 2014. During this process, the department released a cache of never-before-seen photos from the 1994 death scene. According to police, this examination of the evidence confirmed Cobain's death was a suicide.\n\nMore images were also released in March of 2016, depicting the shotgun police say Cobain used to kill himself.\n\nIn this photo, Kurt Cobain's arm shows his medical bracelet from a drug rehab center in LA that he checked out of days before returning to Seattle, where the Seattle Police Department says, he committed suicide.\n\nKurt Cobain Death Scene Photos\n\nThe box of shotgun shells recovered at the scene.

However many remain convinced the evidence in the case points to foul play.\n\nRead more: Cops: New photos show Kurt Cobain suicide gun\n\nNever-before-seen\n\nThis photograph, released on March 17, 2016, shows Seattle Police cold case Detective Michael Ciesynski holding the shotgun police say Kurt Cobain used to kill himself.
