        "text": "I remember seeing it on the news the night it happened. Iirc it was a Friday as there was an 'indie' club I used to go to on Friday nights but unusually I hadn't gone that night. I'm sure it would have been a really weird atmosphere.\n\nThe news came as no shock to me whatsoever. I was reading NME, Sounds, etc during that era and it had been on the cards for a while that something bad - worse than usual - was coming.\n\nPoor kid. The fame he achieved was far too much for someone of his personality. He was in no way cut out for it. It's such a shame because he wasn't looking for that level of success. There were a ton of other slacker bands around at the time and none of them seemed to have a ton of ambition - they were just making music for themselves, their friends, and their small local fanbase. Nirvana was in the right/wrong place at the right/wrong time and as the best of their breed, they got signed, promoted, and became THE band of the scene and the era. Add to that Kurt's talent as a songwriter, a killer track like Teen Spirit, an iconic video and all the stars aligned. Tragically. It was all just too much for him.\n\nIt was a day a lot like today, sunny and warm, and I was in the tractor when the news came over the radio. I recall the DJ talking a little bit about what Cobain meant to him, and it even seems they may have taken a few calls from listeners.\n\nCobain/Nirvana, for me, were not the life changing band of which so many speak so eloquently. But I really liked what he did and to some degree I felt I knew him- we were born within a month of each other, we were both scruffy kids from scruffy towns, but that is where any similarities end. It was a real pleasure to see one of \"us\" make it big, and his efforts to promote other bands, particularly if they featured women, were worthy of respect. But as time went on, and his struggles with all the different forces pulling on him from so many directions seemed to only worsen, it became clear to me his story was more likely than not to end badly and early. So, in a way, I felt relief as much as anything else.\n\nI vividly remember Courtney's reading of the suicide note. It was heartbreaking. She wasn't a perfect enough victim. No one would have been under those circumstances.\n\nIt was a watershed moment in pop culture history, a big deal. I came home from high school and watched Kurt Loder's special report on MTV.\n\nI felt bad for his little girl, in particular, and his widow, his family. Nirvana seemed to be on the verge of flaming out, so musically, I don't think about what could have been. I didn't love their studio work. But Unplugged is on another level. In hindsight, its feels like a requiem.\n\nI was 29 when Kurt died. He was two years younger than me.\n\nBy that time, I was married, had a kid, etc etc.\n\nAlso I was still playing in an all-originals band. We rehearsed 4-5 times a week. We tried to gig a few times a month and did a lot of the necessary schmoozing. I still had 'the dream'. But was fairly realistic about it all.\n\nI understood Nirvana and was absolutely blown away by them in 1991. Nothing sounded like them- that I was aware of, anyway! I was in a club/restaurant having a drink when Teen Spirit suddenly blasted its way thru the PA. I could not believe the rawness of it all! They played it twice, and I was glad they did. It's all I talked about for the next few days.\n\nNow, I was never much of a punk fan- I liked it and understood the intensity- but what attracted me to Nirvana was the musicality and melodies. AND the intensity! I bought Nevermind and kept up with them. The band I was in became a little harder-edged as a result!\n\nI also knew that time was quickly running out for Hair and Glam Metal. (Grunge had it's own \"Glam\"....)\n\nWithin a year or so, like everyone else, I started to worry about Kurt. I'd always felt that he was taking the notion of \"selling out\" way too seriously.\n\nI figured with a new-ish family, he should take some time off, regroup and redefine what he needed and wanted out of his \"star\" position.\n\nI had a hard time getting into \"In Utero\" besides the 'hits'. It was relentlessly bleak and much less melodic than its predecessor.\n\nThe day he died, my wife called me with the news, and we both were stunned that a major icon died like he did- but mostly saddened for his daughter.\n\nI truly think with some time off and heavy therapy, he would have made it and would still be around. Maybe not making music, but something having to do with art.\n\nAnd that is why Nirvana is so important in the history of American music and culture. I said this in another thread somewhere, but before 1991 pop music was dominated by larger than life godlike performers like Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna, etc. Rock music was full of phony macho, misogynistic hair metal and such. Nirvana peeled the cover off of an underground where any weirdos could make music in any way they wanted, and for a brief beautiful moment, that was mainstreamed. They didn’t originate this movement, but they were the culmination of it.\n\nGuns N’ Roses said “Back Off Bitch!” Nirvana said “Come As You Are.” That’s a colossal, spiritual shift in popular culture. Come be weird and vulnerable and scream it out with us. We’re not Gods, we’re your friends from next door. Everyone is welcome, queers, women, disabled people, etc. They weren’t the voice of a generation, they were the voice of reason, kindness and acceptance. And of course they were one of the ass kickingest live bands ever.\n\nThat’s what Cobain should be remembered for, IMHO.\n\nThe discussions about mental health, the impact of childhood trauma (which loomed large over Kurt's life), the effects of not having economic and cultural capital in a time of recessions - compared to what we now know, back then was a dark hole. Many of us came out of bad situations and put in the coordinates for self destruct. When yr in the grips of addiction and severe depression and chronic pain, its impossible to see the impact your pain is having on others and paradoxically you can see so clearly how miserable \"you're\" making them. I'm not justifying or encouraging anything, just trying to shed light for those who might not have experienced these things.\n\nIt is an incredible \"shame\" what happened in the sense of loss, pain, trauma and so much else that Kurt's actions caused for Courtney, Francis, Kurt's mum and many others. I know Courtney, in the depths of her grief, called him selfish.\n\nMay we use what we have learnt in the last 30 years to help ourselves, those around us, the community and the general conversation by seeing things differently, and creating other options that are visible to those in that deep pit."
