        "text": "Katie Monks and Liz Ball are members of an explosive Toronto-based rock band called Dilly Dally. High school friends, Monks and Ball grew up loving Nirvana, Pixies, Sonic Youth, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs among others, eventually honing their own chops as guitarists and songwriters and forming Dilly Dally. In the fall of 2015, the band released its critically-acclaimed album Sore, via the Toronto label Buzz Records, and have been touring steadily ever since with forthcoming dates at Arboretum Festival in Ottawa on August 17 and many European and American shows, beginning at the end of August and leading into September and October . Here, Katie and I discuss the fact that Liz is probably sleeping, setting the record straight about info in the ‘official’ Dilly Dally bio, things from the past get soupy, why her and friends gravitated towards sad, junkie, self-destructive artist boys like Kurt Cobain, Christopher Owens, and Pete Doherty, kill yr idols, maternal instincts, getting it together, bowing down to nobody and respecting life, compassion, owing your fans, Toronto hype, the mythology around tortured artists and success, the music industry, Kurt Cobain was likely smart, a switch, being a woman and helping other women, growing up in Newmarket, living the dream, seeking chaos, the Toronto real estate-related arts exodus, 2013 Toronto, construction in the city, Drake, Rob Ford, Fucked Up, the Blue Jays, and the Raptors and Toronto getting more worldwide attention, the Dilly Dally song “Purple Rage” and the Prince song “Purple Rain,” loving problematic Prince and Purple Rain, her brother Dave who plays in Tokyo Police Club and what their musical upbringing was like, a Beatles chord book, older sibling shop talk, safe European flights, a Dublin family reunion, touring the U.S. during the actual presidential election this fall, the unmediated truth, the future of Dilly Dally and the song “The Touch,” a postcard of a dead cat, and that was that.\n\nRelated links: dillydallyband.com buzzrecords.ca vishkhanna.com\n\nListen, subscribe, rate/review on iTunes.\n\nBob Nastanovich is an American musician who currently lives in Des Moines, Iowa. Though best known for playing keyboards, auxiliary drums, and shouting in the hugely significant and influential rock band Pavement, Nastanovich also co-founded another immensely important band called the Silver Jews. Highlighting the inimitable songwriting and singing of the American poet David Berman, Silver Jews called it a day in 2009 after a remarkable 20-year run. In the past few months, after cryptic social media posts and photographs, there seems to be something stirring in Silver Jews land and the band seems to be active again in some capacity. Here, Bob and I discuss repping Des Moines, dogs and kids, Pavement’s juvenile sound, Stephen Malkmus’ attitude towards reunion tours, how the Pavement reunion tour ended, a failed pitch to get the band going again, the history of Bob, Stephen, and David and the NYC scene of the early 1990s, an infamous Nirvana show that Bob and David disrupted by heckling the band and angering Krist Novoselic, Kim and Thurston’s home phone number, when Kurt Cobain asked Pavement to play the Reading Festival, recording horse racing calls utilizing the same technology as the Silver Jews on their early releases, Drag City might be magic, David’s new obsession with making unique sculptures, the times David has kicked members of Pavement out of the Silver Jews, Harmony Korine and David are close friends now, David is writing new songs and it sounds like he’s going to record them, Cassie Berman and therapy for horses, wi-fi addiction, funny people on the internet, Tanglewood Numbers, when David feels like things are getting too Pavement-y, not talking to David for over a year, why Bob is releasing little tidbits about this new Silver Jews activity, music for sculptures and people, pushing Brian Kotzur, Searching for Berman, the night owl, @silverjews, @dronecoma, @bnastanowich, the song “New Orleans,” and that was all.\n\nRelated links: mentholmountains.blogspot.com vishkhanna.com\n\nListen, subscribe, rate/review on iTunes.\n\nHari Kondabolu is a very funny and incisive stand-up comedian who hails from Queens, New York. He has written for shows like Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell and appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, Conan, and John Oliver’s New York Stand-Up Show among others. Earlier this year, Kill Rock Stars released his highly acclaimed and hilarious stand-up album, Waiting for 2042, which is out on vinyl December 2. On Friday December 5, he headlines a show at the Biltmore Cabaret in Vancouver and here, Hari and I discuss Queens New York not Seattle Washington, how Canada’s not so great, cowardly Americans, indigenous eradication and white demonry, fighting not fleeing, agreeable Canadians, how Stephen Harper might be slicker than George W. Bush, the downfall and terrible truth of Jian Ghomeshi, being on Q, knowing Jian and how he used to always call me ‘buddy,’ Jian’s aggressive egotism, comedy and show biz power dynamics, Hari’s mom doesn’t think he listens anymore, people who think I should have a shot at hosting Q, people who think brown people can replace other brown people, Hari’s #vishonQ campaign, accusations of race obsession in observational comedy, Aziz Ansari’s take on mining one’s cultural heritage in their work versus someone like Russell Peters who does accents in his act, how Peters has galvanized South Asian communities, whitewashed accents and losing our parents’ voices, the situation in Ferguson and what it says about our social progress, white demonry, the remorseless Darren Wilson, people who actually listen, the Terry Gross interview might’ve been a little too great, #vishonQ, Back to the Future and the way forward to politely colonizing Mars, CIA seed money, Weezer’s decline and my lapsed membership (#1234) in their fan club, the Pixies have also been a let-down, more empathy for artistic evolution, really obsessing over Weezer’s trajectory, how and why we measure artists’ creative output, Radiohead, Fugazi, Shellac, the Beatles and others who have created an interesting, nearly flawless body of work, Weezer’s time and place post-Kurt Cobain/at the dawn of widespread internet use in the mid-90s, Pinkerton is messed up, “El Scorcho” and “Across the Sea” are both racist, taking online flak, how Hari’s completion of a B.A. in Comparative Politics and a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics somehow led him to comedy, Paul Mooney, following his passion, you have to laugh when you want to cry, addressing the diaspora and telling his parents’ stories, my dad came here with nothing and now I’m an asshole, coming to Canada more, Sled Island, Northwest Canada and Vancouver, Todd Barry’s Crowd Work movie is great, #toddbarryonQ, Waiting for 2042 is on vinyl via Kill Rock Stars, and pandering to white people, not appreciating our parents’ cooking until white people tell us it’s good, “What’s that smell?,” thanks mom and dad, google.com, the comedy bit “Moving to Canada,” and also #vishonQ.\n\nRelated links: harikondabolu.com killrockstars.com vishkhanna.com\n\nListen, subscribe, rate/review on iTunes."
