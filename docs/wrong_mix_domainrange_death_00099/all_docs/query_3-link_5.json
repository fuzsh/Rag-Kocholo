        "text": "Federal authorities believe a man who used an assault rifle to rob a credit union in Iowa is the \"AK-47 Bandit\" believed to have held up banks in several states, including Idaho, and wounded a police officer in California.\n\nThe FBI says the \"AK-47 Bandit\" robbed banks in Idaho and Washington in 2012 and a Nebraska bank last year.Au\n\nthorities say a man entered the Iowa Heartland Credit Union in Mason City wearing a black ski mask. He was armed with an AK-47 and left with an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nA robber matching that description shot and seriously wounded a police officer during a holdup in Chino, California, in February 2012.\n\nThe FBI is offering up to $100,000 for information leading to an arrest in that case.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. — An inmate is suing the New Mexico Corrections Department, claiming that he was shot in the foot by officers who participated in target practice near the cells.\n\nRobert Vasquez filed the lawsuit Wednesday in state District Court in Santa Fe. He alleges that prison officers at Western New Mexico Correctional Facility fired their guns, which had been loaded with bean-bag pellets, at several cells during training exercises in July 2013.\n\nAlex Tomlin, spokeswoman for the department, said prison officials had held a \"nonlethal training exercise\" and that inmates had the option to leave the area. She claims Vasquez had said that something happened to his foot but not that he had been shot, reported The Santa Fe New Mexican reports.\n\n\"We maintain that he wasn't injured in this incident,\" Tomlin said.\n\nBut Vasquez, who claims the shooting \"constitutes cruel and unusual punishment,\" is seeking compensatory damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress. He is also seeking punitive damages.\n\nAccording to state Corrections Department records, Vasquez has been an inmate at four of the state's prisons and two county jails.\n\nHe pleaded guilty in 2008 to multiple charges, including armed robbery with a deadly weapon and assault with the intention to commit a violent felony upon a peace officer.\n\nVasquez was transferred from the Western New Mexico prison to another prison in 2013.\n\nHELENA, Mont. — The Montana Supreme Court upheld the state's 24/7 Sobriety Program in a ruling Thursday, saying charging associated fees for alcohol monitoring is not pretrial punishment in violation of the Constitution.\n\nThe high court said breath testing can be appropriate as a condition of pretrial release. But, they likened the testing fees to bail and said a judge must do an individual assessment to determine whether the program is appropriate for a defendant.\n\nUnder the program, a judge can order people charged with a second or subsequent drunken driving offense to pay for twice-daily breathalyzer tests or an alcohol monitoring bracelet as a condition of their pretrial release.\n\nThe court's decision comes after the state appealed a lower court ruling that said fees charged for the state's 24/7 Sobriety Program amount to unconstitutional pretrial punishment. The case involved Robert Spady, who had a 2006 DUI conviction and was arrested for DUI in April 2013. He participated in the program for 113 days and paid $452 in fees.\n\nSpady missed or was late for three breath tests and was charged with contempt of court in each case. He appealed his contempt convictions, arguing the 24/7 law was unconstitutional. The high court on Thursday directed a lower court to dismiss Spady's contempt charges because no assessment had been done to determine whether it was appropriate for him to participate in the program.\n\nAttorney General Tim Fox said Thursday in a statement the ruling is a victory because 24/7 is a proven accountability tool.\n\n\"Driving under the influence of alcohol is a significant problem here, and we in the law enforcement community are delighted that the court recognized both the constitutionality and effectiveness of the program,\" he said.\n\nCounty sheriffs can choose whether to participate. Currently, 24 counties are running the program and six more are in the process of starting their own, according to the Attorney General's office.\n\nA new law created the program in 2011 with the goal of reducing the number of people who drive under the influence of alcohol or dangerous drugs.\n\nGov. Steve Bullock said in a statement Thursday he helped lead the effort when he was attorney general to build the 24/7 program with lawmakers and law enforcement.\n\n\"When it came to repeat DUI offenders, Montana had been doing the same thing for decades and expecting different results,\" he said. \"Today's ruling will ensure that this program continues to save lives, make our highways safer, and hold drunk drivers accountable for their actions.\""
