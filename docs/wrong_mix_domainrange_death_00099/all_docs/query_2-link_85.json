        "text": "Facebook has been exploding with people excited about an event coming to the area, and after doing some digging, it feels like the next type of deal like that Glasgow Willy Wonka thing.\n\nSo this new event that shows up as a sponsored post targeted to us because we live in Iowa, and it's called The Oz Escape by Questo.\n\nThe photo just shows a dark AI generated photo of a twister taking out a house in the middle of nowhere.\n\nEvery event for basically every major city across the US is on the website saying \"Almost Sold Out\" and is listed as taking place on June 1st. The location? Well, this is where things get kind of weird.\n\nThe locations in Iowa it's \"Almost Sold Out\" for include:\n\nCedar Falls\n\nCedar Rapids\n\nDavenport\n\nDes Moines\n\nDubuque\n\nIowa City\n\nSioux City\n\nThere is no actual location for the event. One team ticket admits 2-6 adults, and kids \"go for free,\" but there is no real building. You'll be “guided solely by our immersive mobile app,\" which gives clues that you have to type into the app.\n\nWe've found a video from someone in Seattle who bit on this one about 5 months ago, getting in full costume for the event.\n\nNow, keep in mind, you're walking around a 4 block area of your town in full costume, for... something you do on your phone.\n\nThey didn't quite finish the game - if you watch at the 7 minute mark of this video. She says it was super fun. However, if you look through the comments - the Wizard of Oz theme starts and stops at you dressing the part.\n\nA Reddit thread asking about the \"event\" revealed that the company recently did an Alice in Wonderland version of it.\n\nu/CaptainLittleFish said \"There was an Alice in wonderland event like this in other cities seems very similar and overall was considered a scam at worst and a let down at best. It was put on by clued up and included no actual real life things/props, photo stops, or actors supplied by the company. Just groups that decided to dress up on their own. it was just the app with games for you to play which is very hard to play with multiple people and I believe was mostly reading. I get the idea if you and your friends are into D&D and somebody wants to essentially DM this game and you all enjoy dressing up this could be an okay experience.\"\n\nu/tga110 said \"Yes it's real. Myself and a bunch of friends good the Alice in wonderland last summer. It is more of a mini games on the phone with having to be in certain spots around about 4 blocks. It was fun\"\n\nIt's your call if you want to take part in this - just know it's not 100% what it seems, and it could have you upset you spent $40 on it.\n\nJust do your research before you decide to do it."
