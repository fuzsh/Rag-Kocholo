        "text": "FALL, 2000 — Mid to late September.\n\nIowa City, Iowa.\n\nGabe’s Oasis.\n\nAlto Heceta.\n\nJoan of Arc.\n\nJets to Brazil.\n\nBlake set up his equipment. I wondered, Is his cactus tattoo an homage to the southwest? He asked, before they played, “What is your town about? Why are there so many girls in spaghetti straps?”\n\nThen he shred it up. He sang with excellent diction.\n\nSeth was there with me. I walked him to his car so he could trek it back to Rockford.\n\nI returned to Gabe’s. The show was over. Blake wore a hoodie and drank a bottle of Budweiser. Nervously, I told him I saw him 7 years before in Iowa when he played in another band that started with the letter “J”. I thanked him for all the music.\n\nHe asked, “What’s your name, man?”\n\nHe said those shows with NIRVANA were “huge” and “scary”. I asked why they were scary and he said because they (JAWBREAKER) had never played in front of such big crowds before. The next night Jets played the Metro and I wanted to ask Blake what he thought of Chicago, but I just thanked him again and bought copies of Orange Rhyming Dictionary and Four Cornered Night.\n\nI fell in love with Orange Rhyming Dictionary. I listen to it now as I write this. It defined my first semester in college. I remember listening to it as I toiled away at trigonometry, under my lofted bed, at my desk in room N115 of Currier Hall.\n\n………………..\n\nNEARLY SIX MONTHS after the NIRVANA tour, JAWBREAKER headlined a show at the Beloit Sports Arena, in Beloit, Wisconsin. The show was moved from the legendary Alumni House (where Green Day had played!) to a larger venue. HORACE PINKER opened and I became an immediate fan and befriended the band. This show was also the day before my 16th birthday. I thought I was hot shit because I scored SMASHING PUMPKINS tickets that day, but what really made me hot shit was seeing and meeting JAWBREAKER! I don’t remember what songs were played, but I remember Blake seemed an expert at breaking strings. After the show I bought a 24 Hour Revenge Therapy CD whose songs would define my high school years and make me recollect the NIRVANA shows. But the plot thickens!\n\nAfter the show as Blake put his guitar away, I asked for his autograph. He was cordial and signed it and shook my hand. I told Chris I saw them with NIRVANA in Davenport, Iowa and he was like, “Ohhh, the Davenport show. So many people were like, ‘I don’t have tickets’ and someone would say, ‘come with me.'” According to Blake: “We scammed lots of people in free and they gave us a weight-lifting room as backstage space.” (http://www.flexmyhead.com/Jawbreaker/jaw102293.html). When I met Adam he told me Kurt Cobain phoned them personally and asked them to open on the In Utero tour and they thought it was one of their friends putting them on. He also talked about the answering machine intro to “Incomplete.”\n\nI had attended the show with my boyhood friend Mike. My Dad was really late picking us up and for a while we were stranded and Adam Pfahler offered us a ride home! For a while I stood by JAWBREAKER’S tour van and Blake’s two left handed Les Paul’s were left in their cases, unattended, on the sidewalk. I was able to use a phone to call my Dad for a ride. I told Adam I had a ride home and he said, “I know how it is. Being stranded sucks.” Blake went into the bathroom and changed his shirt then they walked past and left.\n\nShoulda got a ride home from JAWBREAKER.\n\nTHIS WOULD BE JAWBREAKER’S final show with NIRVANA. My Old Man offered to take me to this show too but I felt getting to see NIRVANA twice was more than generous so I said no. :(. During the show Kurt Cobain thanked JAWBREAKER and MUDHONEY for playing with them.\n\nLuckily I was able to procure a bootleg of JAWBREAKER’s set from a guy I met through MRR who had bootlegs to trade. It sounds great, like you’re there! I vow to put it up on YouTube for all to enjoy when I get it transferred from cassette to mp3. I don’t think many, if any, JAWBREAKER recordings from the NIRVANA tour surfaced or exist, so I’m delighted to have it. Their set that night was as follows:\n\n1.) Donatello\n\n2.) Ashtray Monument\n\n3.) Shield Your Eyes\n\n4.) Chesterfield King\n\n5.) Outpatient\n\n6.) Boxcar\n\n7.) The Boat Dreams From the Hill\n\n8.) Bivouac\n\nNIRVANA PLAYED TWO SHOWS in Chicago during their In Utero tour in 1993: one on Saturday, October 23, and then on Monday, October 25. I had to decide. There was a brief period where I had Ticketmaster (1-312-559-1212) on the line to purchase tickets for the Saturday show. I waffled. I lost. The show would sell out and NIRVANA would premier its only ever performance of “You Know You’re Right”. I was lucky to attend the October 25th show.\n\nIn 1993 at the time of the show, the Aragon’s marquee was not electric and the bands’ names were put up letter by letter. JAWBREAKER were listed on the Marquee, I remember, as JAW BREAKER. We arrived late and JAWBREAKER were already playing. They looked tiny on stage of the gallant and cavernous Aragon Ballroom. The stage wasn’t congested with a lot of amplifiers; Blake just had a Marshall half stack. The only song I remember them playing was “Outpatient”.\n\nSadly, NIRVANA was beleaguered by sound problems all night. Rolling Stone journalist David Fricke was also in attendance to review the show for the magazine’s January 27, 1994 issue. Kurt Cobain would refer to it as the “shittiest show of the tour.”\n\nI had never heard of JAWBREAKER before this date–one of six shows they played with NIRVANA–a show I caught wind of from Kevin Deal–Kim’s brother–and mistook them for THE WIPERS (who were originally slated to open and had to cancel) the entire time they played. In fact, I thought they were a local band from Davenport who got lucky to open for NIRVANA and were in high school themselves, they were so young. I noted that Blake was left handed like Kurt Cobain. I particularly remember the strings of his guitar, waving like silver tentacles from the headstock of his Les Paul. Alas, for songs, I can’t be to certain what was played; (I think–think–Ashtray Monument and Shield Your Eyes) but a one–Boxcar–that Blake introduced as a song about drinking [beer] down at the railroad tracks with your friends.\n\nAfter the show, I bought a Jawbreaker T-Shirt in the lobby from one of their merch guys. I still have it to this day. It’s their most recognizable and iconic one, yellow on green, featuring the Morton Salt Girl with the play on words “When it pains, it roars” of its slogan."
