IS -\n\nIntroduction\n\nJuly 1994, Ian Halperin was on a West Coast tour with his band State of\n\nEmergency. As a longtime musician who played all over the world, Ian knew many figures from the Seattle music scene. During the nine days Ian spent in Seattle, he talked to several musicians who related their doubts over the suicide of Kurt Cobain three months earlier. “Kurt was definitely not suicidal at the time of his death,” said one friend, who boasted that he had used the same heroin dealer as Cobain. “Something else happened; he may have been killed.” By the end of the trip, Ian had heard a number of similar stories from people who had a nagging sense of unease about the official version. Ian had worked as a journalist for more than ten years before becoming a full-time musician. At first the stories sounded like they had all the elements of a classic conspiracy theory. Rumors of Courtney Love’s involvement made the story sound all the more far-fetched. Courtneybashing, it seemed, had become a national sport. People were always\n\nwilling to believe the worst about Courtney, much like her predecessor as America’s most famous rock widow, Yoko Ono. But among the myriad unsubstantiated rumours was a report that Courtneys own private detective believed Kurt was murdered. Ian’s journalistic instincts immediately took over. Ian had met Kurt in Montreal in 1990 when Nirvana played for about two hundred people at the small alternative music club Foufounes\n\nElectrique. Ian, like Kurt, frequently wrote lyrics about oppression and suicide. “So you play sax,” Kurt said during their conversation a few minutes before Nirvana's set. “Man, I've thought about using some horns in our band, but in a bit of a tweaked-out way.” “How's the band doing?” Ian asked. “It’s tough, but things have been\n\nvill\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\npicking up lately,” Kurt said. “We're starting to get more gigs....Hey, man, ya know where I can score some smack?” “Don’t ask me, I’m not into it,” Ian replied. “I have a couple of Bulgarian friends who are musicians. If they show, I'm sure they can help you.” Krist Novoselic then came up and told Kurt that there were only a couple of minutes to go before they would go on. “See ya later,” Kurt said. Ian left midway through the set. He never talked to Kurt Cobain again. After Ian returned from Seattle in the summer of 1994, he contacted his old writing partner Max Wallace. The two once shared a Rolling Stone magazine award for investigative journalism. Wallace was station manager of Ottawa's CKCU-FM—North America’s oldest alternative radio station—and had good connections in alternative music circles. After Ian told him what he had heard in Seattle, the two agreed it might be an interesting story and decided to do further research, which led to the publication of a somewhat skeptical article in the June 1995 issue of Canadian Disk magazine.\n\nHalperin and Wallace were subsequently commissioned to turn the article into a video documentary, and in late 1995 they traveled to California and Seattle to investigate the case. They spent several months on the road\n\nand interviewed more than one hundred people who knew the Cobains or were familiar with the case. All of this led to the idea of a book after their investigation yielded better results than they had anticipated. Two years later the world continues to believe Kurt Cobain put a gun to his head and ended his angst-ridden life. Courtney Love has emerged as one of the world’s most celebrated figures, shedding tears at will for reporters and fans when she talks about her husband's death while she catapults from tragic rock widow to a full-fledged star in her own right. But as she signs autographs and revels in her never-ending publicity, one man—L.A. private investigator Tom Grant—has vowed to reveal the\n\ntruth about what really happened in early April of 1994, by proving Kurt Cobain was murdered and possibly rewriting the annals of music history. Who Killed Kurt Cobain? sheds a critical light on Grant's investigation, brings forward new information about Cobain’s life and death, reveals many unanswered questions, and argues that the case must be reopened so the world can learn the truth. —Montreal, August 1997\n\nAcknowledgments ©\n\nIn acknowledging the many people who made this book possible, it is important to first note that not everybody who cooperated with our project was fully aware of the book’s subject matter. In fact, many of the interviews were conducted before the idea of a book was even contemplated. Before we thank those who assisted us on our two-year odyssey, we must acknowledge the many people who asked that their names not be used for personal reasons but who were nevertheless committed to the truth. These include friends of Kurt and Courtney; members of the music industry; mainstays of the Portland, Seattle, Olympia, and Los Angeles scene; and two brave members of the Seattle police force.

On her back is a knapsack which resembles a teddy bear. As she goes through customs, an officer asks to inspect the knapsack. She removes it from her shoulder and hands it over. As he unzips the curiously shaped travel bag, a puff of ashes flies up toward the airport's ventilation system. “What's that?” asks the customs official. “That's my husband,” comes the reply.\n\nEight weeks earlier, at 9:40 A.M. on the morning of April 8, 1994, the phone rang in the studio of Seattle's KXRX radio. DJ Marty Reimer picked up the phone and was greeted by the words, “You're going to owe\n\nme\n\nsome\n\npretty good Pink Floyd tickets for this one.” It was the\n\ndispatcher for a local security firm with the news that his employee Gary Smith had just caught a glimpse through a window of the body of Kurt Cobain sprawled on the floor in a room at his Madrona, Washington,\n\nestate, where Smith was installing a security system. The dispatcher had phoned the radio station before notifying the police, and minutes later the world heard the news: The voice of a generation was dead. Thus was the world ushered into a world without Kurt Cobain. For millions, April 8, 1994, became a day as indelibly branded into their memories as Novem-\n\n4\n\nWHO\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nber 22, 1963, August 16, 1977, and December 8, 1980—the deathdates of JFK, Elvis, and John Lennon. The body Smith found that day had come into the world twenty-seven years earlier, on February 20, 1967. Although Aberdeen, Washington, claims (not brags) to be the birthplace of Kurt Cobain, he was actually born to Donald Cobain and Wendy F radenburg in the bleak logging town of Hoquiam, which is separated from Aberdeen by a street. While Wendy took care of the baby at their small rental house, Don supported the family as a mechanic at the Aberdeen Chevron station. When they had scraped up enough for a down payment, the Cobains bought a house on East First Street near Don’s workplace, and little Kurt moved to the town he would later describe as “white-trash hell.” Much has been written about the depressed state of the little logging town which spawned the future rock legend; journalists have described the boarded-up storefronts; bumper stickers with recipes for cooking the spotted owl—the creature whose endangered status residents blame for the faltering logging industry; rampant alcoholism; and a suicide rate double the national average. It is said that because Kurt grew up in this setting, his eventual fate is no real surprise. But in 1967, Aberdeen was a very different town than it is today. Its lifeblood, the logging industry, was still thriving, and unemployment was fairly low. Its legendary red-light district—at one point sporting more than fifty brothels servicing the sailors and loggers—had been shut down by a police crackdown during a wave of morality which had swept the town during the fifties. While the nation was caught up in the Summer of Love, Aberdeen was having none of it. You went off to Vietnam to fight for\n\nyour country, you went to church, you kept your hair short, and you saluted the flag. If any of those hippie freaks from Seattle or Portland came through town, God help them, they'd get their ass kicked. In later years, Kurt and his Aberdeen friends loved to tell horror stories about their hometown. Kurt's friend Dale Crover summed it up: “There\n\nwas nothing to do there but smoke dope and worship Satan.” As Kurt's\n\nonstage antics became more and more outrageous in later years, he would admit that most of his shock tactics were aimed at the Aberdeen rednecks of his youth. What he never talked about publicly was that some of those rednecks were related to him. : Every Christmas, Wendy's extended family gathered for a big dinner.\n\nKURT: THE LOST BOY\n\n5\n\nThose dinners featured the usual laughter, arguments, and discussion which characterize any family dinner. Laced in the conversation, however, was a remarkable amount of good old-fashioned white supremacism. “Niggers and immigrants” were frequently lambasted because they were supposedly taking the jobs away from decent white folk. Says one family friend, “Not everybody in the family subscribed to that way of thinking, but nobody ever put up an argument. In those parts, that’s the way people talked.” Wendy in particular liked to believe she had risen above her own whitetrash surroundings. She refused to live in one of the many trailer parks which dotted the Aberdeen landscape, and scrimped and saved Don’s earnings to ensure she could bring up her children in their own house—a\n\nbadge of respectability signifying arrival into the middle class. Indeed, she wanted better things for her son and daughter, Kimberly, who was born when Kurt was three, and envisioned the day they would escape and make something out of themselves. In later interviews, Cobain would portray\n\nhis early childhood years as fairly idyllic. Lavished with attention by his many aunts and uncles, he was by all accounts an extroverted kid who would display his enthusiasm to anybody who paid attention. But there were several incidents that gave his parents cause for concern: When Kurt was only two, a seventy-eight-year-old man next door complained to Wendy that the little boy had tried to bite his ear off. A year later, an Aberdeen police officer came to the door informing the Cobains that a neighbor's cat had been tortured and their son was the prime suspect.\n\nDuring the late sixties and early seventies, pharmaceutical companies spent millions of dollars distributing medical pamphlets urging pediatricians to liberally prescribe a drug called Ritalin—basically, speed—to children displaying signs of “hyperactivity —the new medical buzzword. Any child who was a bit too raucous was considered a good candidate for the drug. The Cobains didn’t argue when their pediatrician wrote a\n\nprescription for little Kurt. (Ironically, Courtney Love was also prescribed Ritalin as a child.) Children on Ritalin would often become so keyed up that they couldn't\n\nsleep, necessitating another prescription for calming sedatives. Kurt was luckier than most. The sedatives were making him fall asleep in school, so\n\nhe was taken off the drugs and subjected to another recent fad cure for\n\n6\n\nWHO KILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nhyperactivity, the elimination of sugar from the diet. It seemed to do the trick. There was probably nothing wrong with him in the first place, but from then on his family accepted his outgoing personality. His cousin Beverly later claimed that she remembered the phrase “attention deficit” being chanted like a mantra to describe his condition, but this is fairly unlikely since attention deficit disorder (ADD) didn’t become a recognized psychological condition until 1980, many years later. Today doctors indeed prescribe the drug for ADD rather than hyperactivity, although they are sometimes thought of as the same thing. Attempts have been made by journalists and even family members to link his early Ritalin prescription to his later chronic drug use, but this seems to be stretching things, especially since he was taken off Ritalin less than three months after being started on the drug. It was around this time in his early childhood that Kurt introduced the family to his invisible friend “Bodah.” He liked to blame his own mischievous activities on his new friend, and he even had Wendy set an extra place at the table for him. “I was an extremely happy child,” Kurt told his official biographer, Michael Azzerad. “I was constantly screaming and singing. I didn’t know when to quit. I'd eventually get beaten up by kids because I'd get so\n\nexcited about wanting to play. I took play very seriously. I was just really\n\nhappy.’ In one of Kurt's typical contradictions, he would also tell the Los Angeles Times that he was a “seriously depressed kid,” but that was probably just one of his many press-baiting remarks in which he took such great delight. The constant singing may have had something to do with his muchdiscussed musical roots. Wendy's family had always been immersed in music. When she was growing up, her uncle Delbert had enjoyed some\n\nrecording success in the style of the legendary tenor Mario Lanza after\n\nmoving to California and changing his name to Dale Arden. Wendy’s sister Mary had her own country band and played the local honky-tonks, even recording a self-financed single at one point.\n\nAlthough accounts differ, it was probably Mary who first introduced Kurt to the guitar. She later said she tried to teach him but he didn’t have the patience on account of his hyperactivity. Others say she never really made an effort but would occasionally hand him her guitar and he would\n\nfool around on the strings the way any child would. It was Mary, however, who instilled in Kurt a lifelong love of pop music which he would never\n\nKURT: THE LOST BOY\n\nyi\n\nlose, even after pop music was decidedly uncool in the punk rock circles he traveled in.\n\nWhen Kurt came over to visit, Mary would play records for him on her\n\nHi-Fi—especially the Beatles, who were Kurt’s favorites until his death. When he was seven, she gave him some of his favorite recordings, including the Beatles, the Mamas and the Papas, and the Monkees. Around that time, she also gave him his first musical instrument, a bass drum. His constant beating would drive his parents crazy and he would be\n\nbanished outdoors to annoy the neighbors. Years later his drum-banging\n\nexperience came in handy when he joined his junior high school band,\n\nplaying the snare drum. Walking through the streets of Aberdeen banging his drum, Kurt engaged in the first act in what would become his favorite hobby—pissing off Aberdonians. Even his grandmother acknowledged the boy’s perverse\n\njoy at annoying the neighbors. As Kurt would later tell people, “It’s hard to believe their necks could become a darker shade of red, but they did.”\n\nKurt would stroll the streets of Aberdeen battling the townspeople with his sardonic tongue. “Hey, what the fuck are you looking at,” he once yelled at a middle-aged man who was staring at Kurt on the sidewalk while stopped in his Chevy Impala at a red light. “Get a life, bastard. You got a staring problem or something?” When the light changed to green and the car began to speed away, Kurt grabbed an empty Coke bottle from the ground and hurled it at the car. It hit the side of the Chevy and shattered into small pieces. “Next time I'll throw it through your window, you fucker,” Kurt yelled out.\n\nAround 1973, family members started paying more attention to the little drawings Kurt would do whenever he ran out of energy. Although his artistic talent was still unrefined, his renderings displayed a definite flair\n\n(one of his drawings appeared on the front page of the school newspaper when he was six), and his parents began to seriously encourage his artistic side, signing him up for both art and music (drum) lessons. Although he showed much more artistic ability, music was all that really\n\nmattered to him. He told everybody who would listen that he was going to be a “big rock star” one day—which would remain his goal until a couple of years later when he saw Evel Knievel on television and decided he was going to be a stuntman. Cobain mythology attributes Kurt’s sudden turnaround from happy\n\nchild to disturbed pre-adolescent to his parents’ divorce in 1975 when he\n\n8\n\nWHO\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nwas eight years old. His mother Wendy in particular paints family life as fairly rosy until she and Don split. A number of incidents, however, would seem to suggest a downward\n\nspiral that began much earlier. Kurt was fond of telling the possibly apocryphal story of Christmas 1974, when he was seven and wanted a toy Starsky and Hutch gun. Early Christmas morning, Kurt and his sister raced downstairs to find their presents. Kurt was devastated to look in his stocking and discover only a large lump of coal. Family members also recall Wendy constantly blowing up at Kurt for the littlest things and Kurt running up to his room in tears. Don was a less imposing figure in Kurt's life. Although he had a quick temper, he was rarely at home (Wendy later claimed Don once threw Kurt across a room, though Don and Kurt denied it). On weekends, he would try to play with Kurt, who showed little interest in sports but would sometimes play ball with his father because he knew it pleased Don, who was an avid jock and coached a number of neighborhood teams. Wendy was unquestionably the authority figure with the children and tried to be a good mother, nurturing Kurt's interests in art and music, but was often frustrated by his independent streak and manic tendencies. Then there was Kimberly, whom Kurt regarded as the typical pesky sister, three years younger than her brother and seemingly always underfoot. Wendy had to be particularly adept to guard against the usual sibling rivalry ever since three-year-old Kurt ran away from home two days after Kim was born and was found crying under a nearby bridge. At first Wendy seemed content to play mother and wife, but around 1974 she began to display an obvious unhappiness with her life. When she wasnt yelling at the kids, she was sounding off at Don, and when the divorce came, it was no surprise to anyone except, as Cobain lore goes, little Kurt. Until Wendy moved out of her Aberdeen home in 1995, the wall of Kurt's old bedroom was covered in graffiti written in his childish scrawl. Among the rock band logos were these words: “I hate mom, I hate Dad.\n\nDad hates mom, mom hates dad. It simply makes you want to feel so sad.\n\nMom sucks. Dad sucks.” Wendy liked to point to these words to illustrate the devastating effect the divorce had on young Kurt. In fact, Kurt wrote these sentiments months before the divorce, when:he heard one of the\n\nmany shouting matches his parents engaged in during those days.\n\nDon finally moved his stuff out on March 1, 1976, a week after Kurt’s\n\nKURT: THE LOST BOY\n\n2\n\nninth birthday, and took an apartment in Hoquiam. Wendy was allowed to keep the house and their 1968 Camaro, while Don got the Ford truck. Don received visitation rights and was ordered to pay $150 a month in child support to Wendy, who got full custody of the children. Almost everything written about Kurt after his death—most of it using Wendy as a source—portrays the emotional devastation his parents’ breakup had on the nine-year-old boy. “Tt just destroyed his life,” Wendy told Rolling Stone in 1992. “He changed completely. I think he was ashamed. And he became very inward—he just held everything. He became real shy.” She believes the resulting trauma is what destroyed his life and set the stage for his eventual fate. There is no question the divorce had an impact on Kurt. “I just remember all of a sudden not being the same person, feeling like I wasn't worthy anymore,” he would recall. But it was other events following the divorce that would prove to have a much stronger effect on his life. Wendy's official version of why she divorced Don was that he was hardly ever around, that he was either working, playing sports, or coaching. Wendy's new boyfriend moved in soon after Don moved out. Kurt still wasnt quite over the shock of his parents’ split when this new man— whom he would later call a “mean, huge wife-beater’—suddenly appeared on the scene. Almost right away the boyfriend took on the father role, with Wendy's full blessing. He would give Kurt orders and expect to be obeyed. Used to Don’s rather laissez-faire attitude toward parenting, the boy wouldn't always react with enthusiasm. That usually earned him a\n\nsmack. Kurt's protests to his mother almost always fell on deaf ears. (Years later Wendy admitted that the man was “nuts—a paranoid schizophrenic.”) Enraged by the brutality of this man and his mother’s refusal to protect him, Kurt began to withdraw into his own little world. He was terrified in the boyfriend’s presence, never knowing when the man’s powerful hand would be directed at his head. For the first time, he felt completely\n\npowerless and alone. Wendy attributed her son’s morose behavior to jealousy. Kurt once told his friend Dylan Carlson that living with this man\n\nwas much more psychologically damaging than the divorce itself. Kurt began to get into trouble at school and at home. One night, in a\n\nscene reminiscent of the popular comic “Calvin and Hobbes,” he locked\n\n10\n\nWHO KILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nhis babysitter out of the house when she was taking out the garbage. And often, when his mother went out to a local bar with her new boyfriend, Kurt would call Don, begging his father to let him live with him. His mother's boyfriend was all too anxious to get rid of the young pest and convinced Wendy to let Kurt stay with his father. Although Wendy claims Kurt lived with her for a year after the divorce, in reality he remained with her for only a little more than three months. By this time, Don had taken a job with a lumber company and moved to the nearby logging town Montesano, a twenty-minute drive east of Aberdeen. Despite or because of her own origins, Wendy had always tried to protect Kurt from “white trash,” specifically prohibiting him from playing with “poor kids.” She must have had mixed feelings when Kurt moved into Don's new home, located in the middle of a Montesano trailer park. Although Don had never been particularly close to his son as a young child, he was particularly touched that Kurt wanted to live with him, and resolved to be a good dad. The first thing he did was buy his son a new minibike—the envy of the neighborhood kids. He took him camping or on outings every weekend, and the two almost bonded. Kurt was beginning to come out of the shell he had built around himself after the divorce and return to his old self.\n\n“He seemed pretty happy that year,” recalls a trailer park neighbor, Shelley Renfrew. “You could tell Don really loved his son and was always showing him off to everybody.” Kurt's uncle Larry Smith later remembered a particular incident around that time when Kurt still seemed in good spirits: “A wonderful picture comes to mind of a rare, sunny day when I peeked out the window into the yard. There was Kurt with some kind of contraption on his head. It resembled a tinfoil hat. He was sneaking around the yard, followed by about half a dozen laughing toddlers. Kurt had the million-dollar grin on his face, and I could tell he was definitely in ‘nirvana.’ I guess you could say he was the pied piper of compassion.” In September, Kurt transferred to Beacon Elementary in Montesano\n\nand seemed to thrive that year, even getting involved in a number of school activities. Things were going along well until just before Kurt’s eleventh birthday,\n\nwhen Don announced he was remarrying. Kurt immediately displayed his displeasure at someone usurping his father’s affections. To make matters\n\nKURT: THE LOST BOY\n\nTh\n\nworse, Kurt's stepmother came with two children of her own. The whole family moved to a real house in Montesano to begin their new life, but Kurt only went reluctantly. The trailer park was where he had been happy,\n\nand he didn’t want to leave. By all accounts, his new stepmother did everything she could to win\n\nKurt's affection, but to no avail. At the same time, Don was anxious to win over his own new stepchildren, and Kurt was bitterly resentful at all the attention going to the newcomers. It was around this time that Kurt first began to display the ugly side of his personality; the bully. He would mercilessly torment his new step-\n\nbrother and stepsister and treat them much like his mother’s boyfriend treated him. He also liked to provoke some of the neighboring trailer park kids, recalling years later, “My mom thought that I was better than those kids, so I picked on them every once in a while—the scummy kids, the dirty\n\nkids. I just remember there were a couple of kids that stunk like pee all the time and I would bully them around and get in fights with them.” Although rarely reported, Kurt’s dark side would manifest itself time and again throughout his life. Increasingly frustrated by Kurt’s behavior, Don and his wife tried everything they could think of doing to placate the boy, but he refused to adjust to his new environment and became increasingly difficult, often resorting to full-scale tantrums over the smallest incidents. According to almost everybody who knew the family, Don’s wife was no wicked\n\nstepmother. She bent over backwards to get Kurt to like her but was constantly rebuffed.\n\nOne Saturday afternoon the whole family went shopping at a nearby shopping mall: Kurt chose to forgo the outing and sulk alone in his\n\nbasement room. When they returned a few hours later laden with new toys, Kurt took his stepsister’s new doll and cut off her head—an act which presaged his later hobby of collecting dismembered doll figures. Several months after Don remarried, Kurt demanded he be allowed to go back to live with Wendy. Don had no objections, but Wendy was still living with her deranged boyfriend and refused to allow Kurt to come\n\nback. Pleading calls from Kurt couldn't persuade her to change her mind, although he frequently visited his mother. On June 14, 1979—when Kurt was twelve years old—Don filed a court petition to gain official custody of his son. At the time, he was at his wits’\n\nZz\n\nWHO KILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nend trying to figure out a way to gain the acceptance of his son again. Technically, because of the divorce agreement, Wendy still had official custody of Kurt even though he hadn't lived with her for almost three years. “I did it to make him feel a part of the family,” Don later said. Kurt didn't take well to his father's gesture, screaming, “That bitch isn't my family,” referring to his stepmother. When he wasn't in school, Kurt spent all his time in his room drawing, watching television, and listening to his records, including his current\n\nfavorites Queen and of course the Beatles. Across the ocean, a band called the Sex Pistols had begun a musical revolution which would one day change his life. But in Aberdeen, that music was still considered noise.\n\nProgressive rock and heavy metal ruled. That’s what the cool kids listened to. Because of Kurt's reputation as a bully, a group of these teenagers took notice of twelve-year-old Kurt and invited him to hang out with them after school. “They were way older than me,’ Kurt told his biographer. “They must have been in junior high. They were smoking pot and I just thought they were cooler than my geeky fourth-grade friends who watched Happy Days. I just let them come over to my house and eat my food, just to have friends.” Don, who was a big rock-n-roll fan, had recently sent away to Columbia Music House for one of their “Get twelve records for only one cent” offers. Kurt's new friends noticed all the great records—Kiss, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath—in Don’s collection and insisted Kurt play them. This was Kurt’s first introduction to a heavier sound than he had been used to. He liked it. “After they turned me on to that music,” Kurt recalled, “I started turning into this little stoner kid.” In fact, Kurt was at first reluctant to smoke pot with his new friends. They didn't really push it on him because of his age. He did acquire a taste for beer, however. A thirty-one-year-old man who lived a couple of blocks away sparked his interest in the brew. Jim Randall concocted home brew in his basement and would regularly invite Kurt over for a pint or two. In exchange, Kurt would convince his friends to buy their beer from Randall whenever they had parties. Randall was unemployed and he sold brew to\n\nearn some cash. The Aberdeen teenage rebels were a perfect market for him because he treated them like adults, which gave them a more\n\nKURT: THE LOST BOY\n\n13\n\nconfident and less passive attitude at being regarded as the town’s\n\noutcasts.\n\nL Fetend\n\n“Randall liked Kurt a lot,” said Kevin Smiley, an oldGried of Kurt’s.\n\n“Sometimes he would give Kurt a special bottle if Kurt was able to sell a\n\nlot of beer for him.” The special bottle, which Randall would always mark with the letters “PB” (the letters stood for Potent Brew) contained about 14 percent alcohol. Then one weekend, one of his friends asked Kurt if he wanted to come to Seattle to a Sammy Hagar concert. They went with the friend’s older sister. Don agreed to let his son go, pleased that Kurt seemed to be emerging from his cloud. “On the way to the concert,” Kurt recalled years later, “we drank a case of beer and we were stuck in traffic and I had to go so bad I peed in my pants. And when we got there, people were passing pipes of marijuana around and I'd never smoked pot before and I got really high. I had a Bic lighter in my shirt and I took it out for one of those lighter tributes at the end of the show and I was tripping out and the next thing I knew I had lit myself on fire.” Meanwhile, back home, the more attention he saw Don give to his new family, the more angry Kurt became. He was so anxious to win back his\n\nfather's affection that he agreed to his father’s suggestion that he join the school wrestling team despite his disgust at team sports. Don thought this would be the perfect release for his increasing aggression. Indeed, Kurt seemed to have found a niche, showing a remarkable talent for lunging on other boys and pinning them to the mat for three seconds, although he later told people he had hated it, especially having to hang out with jocks. Don never expected his son to show any athletic talent and was thrilled that Kurt seemed to excel at wrestling. He bragged to his friends and coworkers, especially when he received the news that Kurt had reached\n\nthe finals in his school’s wrestling championship for his weight category. Don the proud father was sitting in the gym bleachers the day of the big match, certain his son would be bringing home the handsome trophy. Kurt, however, had other ideas. At last, he had seized upon the perfect\n\nway to pay his father back for the betrayal of marrying “that bitch.” As Kurt squared off with his opponent, he looked up at Don in the stands and gave him a sly grin. He kept the grin on his face as the whistle blew and he went limp, deliberately letting himself be pinned.\n\n14\n\nWHO\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\n“You should have seen the look on his face,” Kurt told Michael Azzerad. “He actually walked out halfway through the match because I did it... four times in a row. For Don, that was the final straw. Wendy refused to take him in, so he was sent to live with an aunt and uncle. Between 1979 and 1981, Kurt was shuttled back and forth between relatives, with periodic returns to his father’s house before he was thrown out again. According to Don, this period marked an almost friendless existence for Kurt, who spent most of his spare time in the library. Hilary Richrod was the reference librarian at Aberdeen’s Timberland Library. She remembers Kurt sitting reading for hours at a time. “It was hard to miss him,” she recalls. “He usually had multicolored hair, and that kind of stuck out in a town like Aberdeen.” One of his junior high school classmates told writer Christopher Sandford that Kurt was “drowning in a tidal wave of self-hate” during this period. Kurt's uncle Larry Smith also remembers this bleak period of his nephew's life and the way the boy coped with his troubles, which he\n\nrecalled in a letter to the editor of the local Aberdeen newspaper after Kurt died. “My grandfather comprehended the intelligence and individuality in Kurt at a time when Kurt was being beaten down mentally and physically. ‘Gramps often told me of his respect for Kurt's tenacity and compassion even though he was in emotional pain. Shortly before Gramps died, he had been talking about Kurt. He looked at me and said words to the effect that he could see a nobility about Kurt that he had never seen in anyone in all his seventy years. “One time, Gramps invited Kurt along on one of our steelhead fishing trips. We were spread out a few hundred feet apart along the Wynooche River. All of a sudden, we heard this horrendous combination of screaming, warbling, and yodeling from Kurt, who was upstream and out of sight. Gramps told me to run up there and help Kurt, who must have hooked a big fish. When I reached Kurt, he didn’t even have his line in the water. When I asked him what was going on, he just looked at me with those piercing eyes and huge grin. He said, ‘Oh, I'm just trying to thicken my vocal cords so I can scream better!’ “When I went back to Gramps to tell him, he just grinned and said, ‘It figures. We'll just let him be. We can now say, “Thank you, Kurt, for\n\nthickening your vocal cords!”\n\nKURT: THE LOST BOY\n\nis\n\nRelatives from both sides of the family remember one thing in particular about this time—huge fights between Don and Wendy about their son whenever they saw each other. Wendy was becoming increasingly concerned about Kurt's deepening malaise, and she insisted he go to a psychiatrist, which he did for more than a year. But it didn’t do much to change the boy, who continued to retreat inward.\n\nAt the end of 1980, Wendy finally broke up with her boyfriend after enduring years of physical and mental abuse. She had also just lost her job\n\nand she wasn't quite ready for the commitment of caring for Kurt, so she asked her brother Chuck F radenburg to take him in for a while. Uncle Chuck was one of the few relatives whom Kurt admired. A musician in the Aberdeen cover band Fat Chance, Chuck knew everything there was to know about music, and Kurt loved listening to his giant record collection. Soon after Kurt moved in, Chuck reminded him that his fourteenth birthday was fast approaching and offered to buy him either a bicycle or a guitar. Kurt had fooled around with some of his stoner friends’ guitars when he was younger, but he couldn't really play. He jumped at the chance to get a cool instrument so he could give up the decidedly uncool bass drum which he still played in his junior high school band. Chuck asked his group’s guitarist, Warren Mason, to find a guitar in time for Kurt's birthday in February. Warren obtained a six-string used Lindell from a local electrician friend—who later described it as a “piece of crap” —for $125. Kurt loved his new guitar and spent all his spare time playing it in his room. Chuck was so impressed by Kurt's passion for the instrument that he asked Mason to give his nephew lessons. Cobain later described the effect of getting his first guitar: “It was definitely a good release. I thought of it as a job. It was my mission. ..as soon as I got the Lindell I just became obsessed with it.”\n\nLike most teenage guitarists of the early eighties, Kurt was determined to learn to play Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” as well as his then guitar idol Jimmy Page. Although Kurt later denied ever liking Zeppelin,\n\nMason later described his new student as playing the song with dazzling speed over and over.\n\n“He wasn't the most technically gifted kid in the world,” Mason remembers, “but he had a genuine feel for timing and phrasing. Kurt\n\nknew that the gaps between the notes are as important as the music. He\n\nhad an intuitive grasp of what would and wouldn't work in a given song.”\n\nWhen Kurt was very young, his father noticed that he was left-handed.\n\n16\n\nWHO\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nAlthough by the seventies this was no longer considered unacceptable, Don was determined his son would grow up right-handed, and he used some of the same methods his own father had used on him. These included slapping Kurt's wrist every time he used his left hand. This wasn't entirely effective but it did make Kurt ambidextrous. Although\n\nmost guitars are made for right-handers—and Kurt’s Lindell was no exception—he chose to play it as a lefty, which presented a number of difficulties but gave him a distinctive style. Wendy ordered Chuck to put a stop to Kurt's lessons only three months after they began them, which caused bitter resentment in young Kurt. He had finally found a sense of purpose and his mother had to go and interfere. This setback, however, didn’t keep Kurt away from his guitar, which Mason described as his “best and only friend.” In downtown Aberdeen there was a music store called Rosevear's which sold instruments and had rooms upstairs which it rented out as rehearsal space. Unbeknownst to Wendy, Chuck gave Kurt money so he could rehearse whenever he wanted at Rosevear’s, which became his home away from home. Once again, Kurt revived his childhood dream of becoming a rock star. He began to devour music magazines like Creem and Rolling Stone. Although his musical tastes still ran to mainstream rock—he had\n\nmastered Queen’s “Another One Bites the Dust” and the Cars’ “Best\n\nFriend’s Girl’—he had seen the B-52s on Saturday Night Live and fell in love with the New Wave style. In fact, shortly after the broadcast he painted black and white squares on his sneakers in imitation of vocalist Fred Schneider's checkerboard Vans. In Creem he constantly read about the exploits of Johnny Rotten and the Sex Pistols and loved the pictures of punk rockers, but he had no idea what punk sounded like and didn’t know anybody with a punk record he could listen to. Instead, he started to play his guitar the way he thought punk would sound. He described his music at the time as “really raunch riff rock... it\n\nwas like Led Zeppelin but it was raunchy and I was trying to make it as aggressive and mean as I could.” When he finally listened to his first punk record, the Clash’s Sandinista, he was disappointed because it wasn't the way he had imagined punk would sound.\n\nDuring one of his sojourns shuttling back and forth between relatives,\n\nhe had stayed for a time with Don’s parents, who were fairly religious and\n\nKURT: THE LOST BOY\n\n7\n\nregularly attended church, bringing Kurt with them. He became enam-\n\nored of the church choir and decided to try out. The choirm aster was impressed by the boy's unique but untrained voice, which showed significantly more promise than his guitar playing. Because he was constantly being praised for his vocal abilities and he thought he was a good guitarist, Kurt believed the time was right to start a band, although he later said he had abandoned the idea of becomi ng a rock star. “T was so self-conscious at that time,” he told Michael Azzerad, “and I had such a small amount of self-esteem that I couldn't even think of actually becoming a rock star, never mind dealing with what they would expect a rock star to be. I couldn't imagine being on television or doing interviews or anything like that. Stuff like that didn’t even seep into my mind at that time.” By the time he was fifteen, he had moved back in with Wendy, who had\n\nalso taken in Rick Hansen, a local teenage boy whose mother had died. Rick also played guitar and the two would jam together for hours, sometimes with Rick’s stoner friends, hatching plans to form a band but somehow never quite getting it together. As usual when he would live with one parent, Kurt would become closer to the other parent. After several months with Wendy and her constant nagging, Kurt was anxious to win Don’s favor again in the hopes of maybe returning to live with his father one day. He even agreed to play on a Little League baseball team coached by Don, who, despite the wrestling incident years before, still harbored hopes for Kurt as a jock.\n\nKurt didn't take the team very seriously, deliberately striking out each\n\ntime he came to bat, but it was during his brief baseball sojourn that he made a new friend named Matt Lukin. Lukin played the bass for the Melvins, a local Aberdeen rock band.\n\nMore than a year before, Kurt had actually attended a Melvins rehearsal\n\nwith a friend of his who knew the drummer. At that time, when Kurt was in ninth grade, the band was still a cover band specializing in the Who and Jimi Hendrix. In awe at being in the presence of a real live band, Kurt— who later claimed he was drunk on wine—made a fool of himself, telling\n\nthe band members how great they were. After an hour of Kurt's effusive behavior, he and his friend were politely asked to leave.\n\nBut since that incident, the Melvins had discovered punk rock, and Kurt was excited to be friends with one of their members. While he and\n\nWHO\n\n18\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nLukin sat on the bench, they talked nonstop about music, although they\n\nweren't really friends outside the team that summer. Kurt’s real connection to the Melvins came during the previous school year, when he was in the same art class as Melvins leader Buzz Osbourne.\n\nHe and Osbourne struck up a friendship and the two began to hang out. Osbourne was still heavily into the Who, but midway through the year he and the Melvins discovered punk and made plans to transform the band. He lent Kurt one of his new treasures, a photo book on the Sex Pistols, and passed on his newly acquired punk and New Wave tapes for Kurt to listen to. These tapes were a revelation to fifteen-year-old Kurt, who began dressing punk and attending Melvins rehearsals. Everywhere he went, he would draw the Sex Pistols logo. According to Warren Mason and others, however, he was still listening to mainstream radio and to records by his favorite guitar influences, Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix. Mason believes\n\nKurt’s new image may have been contrived to fit in with his new friends. Still, it is easy to imagine the appeal of punk—the music of rage and rebellion—to Kurt at that time. In their new incarnation, the Melvins began to attract a lot of attention, and they regularly played in Seattle and Olympia. Kurt began to tag along as a roadie, and he was in awe of their success. Adhering to punk’s do-it-yourself ethos, Kurt started recording some of his own music on a portable Toshiba tape recorder that he bought at Woolworth’s for $14.99. “If you have something to say, pick up a guitar, write a song, and say it,” Buzz Osbourne once told Kurt. Kurt would record a few chords and improvise lyrics. When he played\n\nit back, he would usually think of a few more lyrics and then rerecord the song. The first time Kurt got the courage to play one of his tunes for Buzz, his friend was stoned and listened disinterestedly. “Not bad, needs a bit of work,” he told Kurt of “Creation,” a tune that had taken Kurt about an hour to write and record. Kurt knew, however, that Buzz was just being polite. He decided not to let anybody listen to his music again until it was more polished. “That's all I ever wanted to do at that point,’ Kurt would later say. “T\n\ndidn’t have any high expectations of my music at all. I just wanted to have the chance to play in front of some people in Seattle. The thought of being in a band that was successful enough to go on tour was too much to ask at\n\nthat time.”\n\n.\n\nAberdeen didn’t have much of a punk rock club scene, although the\n\nKURT: THE LOST BOY\n\n19\n\nRamones had passed through town when Kurt was ten and too young to care, but he was determined to experience the scene for himself . When Kurt heard that his favorite punk band, Black F lag, was coming to Seattle,\n\nhe had to go. Wendy had forbidden Chuck to give Kurt any more money\n\nto indulge his music habit, so he sold his entire music collection to raise enough money for the ticket at Seattle’s Mountaineer club and an ounce of pot for the road. Together with Buzz, Kurt spent the night slamda ncing, and that night he made the fateful decision that he was going to be a punk rocker. The day after the Black F lag show, Kurt got a punk haircut and embarked on what was to become his favorite endeavor, spray-painting cars with punk rock slogans. Kurt's nearly three-year sojourn living with his mother came to an abrupt end when he was seventeen, in May 1984, when she married a longshoreman named Pat O’Connor, who Kurt later claimed was even\n\nworse than her previous psychotic boyfriend.\n\nHis new stepfather had no patience for the rebellious freak Kurt had become and made it clear he wasn’t welcome under his roof. Once again Kurt was shuttled back and forth between relatives in Montesano,\n\nAberdeen, and Hoquiam, most of whom also had no patience for the\n\ntroublesome teenager. Kurt's nomadic existence was miserable and he bitterly resented not being allowed to move back with his mother, with whom he had achieved\n\na relatively peaceful coexistence in the days before she married Pat. Every\n\nnight, Kurt would call up Wendy, sometimes in tears, begging to move back in. Finally, after being unceremoniously told by one of his aunts to vacate her house, Kurt phoned his mother to tell her he had run out of relatives willing to take him in. She convinced Pat he would stay only until\n\nhe could find another place to live and told Kurt to come over.\n\nThis arrangement went fairly smoothly for a while as Kurt tried to be\n\non his best behavior out of fear of another eviction. One day during this period, Pat returned home from one of his frequent drunken binges. From his room Kurt heard a vicious argument ensue, with Wendy accusing her husband of cheating on her. Moments later Wendy stormed out of the house to get drunk. She returned several hours later with a determined look on her face. She headed for Pat’s gun rack, which held a sizable collection of hunting rifles, and gathered up as many as she could. Unable to carry them all, she\n\n20\n\nWHO KILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\ncalled for Kurt’s sister, Kim, to take the rest along with a bag of ammunition and together they headed for the nearby Wishkah River, where they dumped the whole lot. Watching his mother dump the guns, Kurt hatched a plan. Always on the lookout for ways to get dope money, Kurt brought a friend to the river that evening and they dredged the bottom until they had found nearly all the guns. They dragged the haul to town and sold them for enough money to buy Kurt a used amplifier. His friend used his share to buy an ounce of pot, and together they got very stoned to celebrate their good fortune. Not long after this incident, Kurt returned home from practicing with the Melvins to find all his clothes and belongings packed in a box outside his room. Wendy had recently become pregnant and she didn't need the stress of her son’s erratic behavior adding to her many existing problems. Kurt moved into a small apartment with a friend, Jesse Reed, whose born-again-Christian parents had once taken him in, only to toss him out soon afterward because they thought he was a bad influence on their son. Kurt was used to having other people clean up after him and wasnt particularly into domestic life. He liked to indulge in his hobby of dismembering dolls, covering them in fake blood, and hanging them in little nooses all over the apartment, which he later described as filled with “beer and puke and blood. ..garbage stacked up for months. I never did do the dishes. Jesse and I cooked food for about a week and then put all our greasy hamburger dishes in the sink and filled it up full of water and it sat there for the entire five months I was there.”\n\n2 Sex and Drugs and Rock ‘n’ Roll\n\nWhen he wasn't brooding in his room or at the library, Kurt was busy discovering girls. Cobain mythology has it that Kurt was a bisexual, actively pursuing relationships with both boys and girls. This misconception may have dated back to when Kurt was fifteen and befriended a boy named Myer Loftin, whom he met in one of his art classes. (Of course, Courtney's press-baiting comment that “Kurt fucked half the guys in Seattle” may have had something to do with it.) When Kurt first met Loftin, he was unaware his new friend was gay. When Kurt was informed this was so a few weeks later, his friend’s homosexuality didn’t bother him.\n\nHe and Loftin were almost inseparable. This didn’t sit too well with the rednecks\n\nof Aberdeen,\n\nwho didn’t have a whole lot of tolerance for\n\nhomosexuality. “I started to realize that people were\n\nlooking at me\n\neven\n\nmore\n\npeculiarly than usual,” Kurt later recalled, describing countless incidents\n\nin school, especially after gym class, where he would be harassed and\n\ncalled “faggot.” “They felt threatened because they were naked and I was supposedly gay so they either better cover up their penises or punch me. Or both.” At first, Kurt wore the distinction as a badge of honor and secretly\n\ndelighted at pissing off these kids. “I started being proud of the fact that I was gay even though I wasn't. I really enjoyed the conflict. It was pretty 21\n\nWHO\n\nPD:\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nexciting because I almost found my identity. I was a special geek. I wasn't quite the punk rocker I was looking for but at least it was better than being the average geek.” The fun soon wore off, however, as jocks started to turn from verbal to physical abuse, beating up Kurt almost every day after school. And then one day, in an act he would remember with shame for the rest of his life, he told Loftin that he couldn’t hang around with him anymore. The abuse was too much to bear. “He simply appeared one day and said he was getting too much grief for being the friend of a faggot,” Loftin told Christopher Sandford. “He used the word ‘faggot. Then he gave me a stiff little hug, turned on his heel and walked away.” Kurt’s uncle Larry later recalled what Kurt was going through. “Kurt didn’t fit the general mold of society in a logging town, and so he was beaten up on by people who didn’t understand him. One day I heard that he was in a fight a few blocks away. When I ran to the scene, the fight was over. However, I heard from a friend that Kurt was assaulted by a burly, 250-pound logger type. Evidently, Kurt did not even fight; he just presented the bully with the appropriate hand gesture every time he was knocked down until the bully gave up. To top it all off, Kurt just had that usual grin on his face!” Years later, after he was successful, Kurt would delight in dressing up in women’s clothes in public or French-kissing his fellow band members on live TV, confident that it would enrage his old neighbors in Aberdeen who were already talking about how they used to know Kurt in the old days.\n\nIn an attempt to redeem his reputation, he actively sought out girls, but he remained a virgin until he met a stoner girl named Jackie when he was seventeen. His first attempt at sex was thwarted when, just before consummation, Wendy burst into the room and shouted “Get that slut out of here.” He continued to have short flings, but by all accounts, he preferred pornography to live girls as an adolescent. While living in his first apartment with Jesse Reed, he had built up quite a collection—not the\n\nusual Penthouse and Playboy magazines but very hard-core titles with, among other things, women having sex with farm animals. He was also quite a voyeur.\n\n;\n\nOne woman whom he and Reed had once hired to clean their apartment in exchange for drugs described Polaroids of women mastur-\n\nSEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK ‘N’ ROLL\n\nDS)\n\nbating strewn around his bedroom. Much later Kurt would admit that he was “never sexually normal.” When Kurt moved back to Aberdeen to live with Wendy, he also switched high schools from Montesano High to Aberdeen High. He had long since stopped hanging around with his old Melvins friends, who were back in Montesano, and he was anxious to join some crowd. “I wanted to fit in somewhere, but not with the average kid, not with the popular kids at school. I wanted to fit in with the geeks, but the geeks were sub-geeks,” he told Michael Azzerad. “They weren't the average geek. They weren't the type of kid who would listen to Devo. They were just usually deformed.” There was one clique at the school with whom he was familiar—the stoners. Although he had long since rejected their mentality, he shared their taste in drugs and, secretly, in their music. “Although I hated them, they were at least into rock ’n’ roll,” he said. While he hung out with the stoners at the smokers’ shed behind the school, Kurt struck up a friendship with Dale Crover, who had just joined the Melvins as their drummer. Crover, who lived in Aberdeen with his parents, had an attic room which he offered the Melvins as a rehearsal space. Kurt once again had an excuse to hang out with his old friends. Kurt had long since decided that he was going to form a punk band, and spent long hours in the Aberdeen public library writing original material for the band he would someday have. Many of Kurt's new music friends were intrigued that he wrote his own stuff. Almost everybody at\n\nthat time was content to play covers, but Kurt knew he would never be a rock star playing other people's material. He convinced Crover and a friend named Greg Hokanson to start rehearsing some of his material, and the three were impressed by the results. When Buzz Osbourne heard the three rehearse one day, he\n\ninvited them to open for the Melvins at an upcoming gig in nearby Moclips. Calling themselves Fecal Matter, the trio performed what Kurt\n\nwould later call “a pretty lame effort.” Buoyed by their gig, the trio decided to take the next necessary step to rock stardom and record a demo tape. Kurt's aunt Mary offered to let them use her equipment. Kurt began to circulate the results of this session to the assorted hangers-on who congregated at Melvins rehearsals. One of these regulars was a giant of a fellow named Krist Novoselic. A few years earlier, Krist\n\nWHO KILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\n24\n\nhad moved with his family—Croatian-born immigrants—from California to Aberdeen. Krist was a good friend of Dale Crover and would often bring his girlfriend Shelli to the rehearsals. Describing his attraction to punk years later, Krist said, “Punk rock\n\nkind of:galvanized people in Aberdeen. It brought us together and we got our own little scene after a while and we all hung out. Punk rock had this cool, political personal message. It was a bit more cerebral than just stupid cock rock, you know.”\n\nWhen Krist heard Kurt’s demo tape, he was blown away by the sound and right away knew this guy was going places. Kurt had ditched Greg Hokanson from his band by this point and recruited Buzz Osbourne to play with him and Crover at assorted gigs under the name Brown Towel (misspelled on some posters as Brown Cow). Krist was also a musician whose mother owned a beauty shop in\n\nAberdeen. Above the shop was an empty room, perfect for a rehearsal space—a\n\nvaluable commodity for musicians in those parts. Krist had once\n\nsung in a Melvins offshoot called the Stiff Woodies which played a few _ parties around town (Kurt even played drums with them once). Krist offered the space to Kurt if he would form a band, and that winter the seeds of Nirvana began to take root. Every afternoon, Krist, Kurt, and Bob McFadden, a local jock they had recruited because he owned his own\n\ndrums, would head up to the rehearsal space and jam. Their sessions soon began to attract the same kind of hangers-on as the Melvins rehearsals, until Krist one day posted a sign which read, “This is not a big crash pad. So just get out of here because we want to rehearse.” Meanwhile, Kurt had been evicted from his apartment. He was more ghan five months overdue on the rent. Wendy refused to take him in,\n\nbecause she had just read a book on a new way of dealing with problem kids, called “tough love.” She was quite alarmed at his behavior by this\n\npoint and figured he had to do something to straighten himself out. This time Kurt was determined not to do the relative shuffle again, and instead he moved between friends’ couches and even for a while to the back of Krist’s van. During this period, Kurt was living on a monthly ration of forty dollars’\n\nworth of food stamps. In later years, Kurt would tell people about the months he spent homeless living under the Wishkah Bridge. In fact, this was one of his favorite places to go and be alone to write poetry, but he\n\nSEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK ‘N’ ROLL\n\n25\n\nnever really lived there, according to his friend Rick Hansen, who said he\n\nreally only spent one full night under the bridge. In true punk rock fashion, Kurt loved to go out every night with a couple of friends and spray-paint slogans all over the town. Each morning\n\nthe residents of Aberdeen would wake up to find “God Is Gay” or “Abort\n\nChrist” sprayed on their walls and pickup trucks. One day, when Kurt was out on an excursion with Buzz and Krist, a\n\npolice cruiser pulled up just as they had finished painting “Homosex\n\nRules” on the side of a bank. The other two fled and hid in a garbage\n\ndumpster, leaving Kurt to take the rap. Ironically, when the cops brought him in and forced him to empty his pockets, out came a cassette of the punk group Millions of Dead Cops. Kurt was fined $180 and given a\n\nthirty-day suspended sentence. Wendy had by this time abandoned her tough love experiment and rented a little shack, for one hundred dollars per month, where Kurt could live. He moved into the crude space with Matt Lukin of the Melvins. He was still tight with the Melvins even though they had rejected his attempt to join the band a few months earlier. He had assembled his best material and was furiously rehearsing every day in hopes of joining his idols. But when the big audition came, Kurt was so nervous, he blew it. He forgot the words, forgot the chords, and just stood there, emitting feedback from his guitar. A fortuitous failure, as events turned out. Although Seattle was still another world to Kurt’s friends, Olympia was the happening place. Home of Evergreen College and a burgeoning alternative music scene, Olympia—the state capital—was a forty-fiveminute drive from Aberdeen, and Kurt started making the trip with Krist almost every weekend, usually to see shows at Evergreen. On one of these trips, they ran into Buzz Osbourne, who introduced Kurt to an Olympia woman named Tracy Marander. Tracy had once seen\n\nFecal Matter perform and was impressed by Kurt’s deep blue eyes and brooding personality.\n\nFrom their first meeting, Kurt was hooked, and he began to spend every weekend in Olympia at Marander’s apartment. During the week, he continued to practice with Novoselic and a new drummer, Aaron Burckhard. The mustachioed Burckhard was more of a metalhead than a punker, but Kurt and Krist needed a drummer and he was all they could find. Kurt was starting to take his music more seriously and drove his fellow\n\n26\n\nWHO\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nband members hard, insisting they practice constantly. Fueled by the compliments of their assorted friends and groupies, Kurt believed he was close to achieving his dream. The trio had yet to play live together and were anxious to get a gig. But this was easier said than done for a band that played original material. “We just had to play a show,” Kurt remembered. “God, if we could just play a show, it would be great.” Finally, a friend of Tracy’s got them on the bill for a party in Olympia.\n\nAn excited Kurt, Krist, and Aaron arrived ready to perform, only to discover that the party had been shut down by the police because of excessive noise.\n\nA couple of weeks later, they finally got their chance when they were booked to play a house party in Raymond, Washington, opening for a metal band. Their brand of showmanship, which included spreading fake vampire blood all over the house, didn’t go over too well with the staid crowd of rich kids who Kurt later recalled “were so scared that they were in the kitchen hiding from us.” They also weren't impressed by the original material, which included the first live performance of many future Nirvana staples, including “Floyd the Barber,” “Beeswax,” and “Hairspray\n\nQueen.” A few real gigs followed, and finally the band was hired one night to play the Community World Theatre in Tacoma, just outside Seattle. Until then, the band hadn't bothered giving themselves a name. When the promoter pressed Kurt for something to put up on the marquee, he came up with “Skid Row’ on the spur of the moment.\n\nPeople in the audience that night remember a fairly polished performance highlighted by Kurt’s onstage antics, which included jumping five feet in the air and landing in a split. As word spread and the band began to get more gigs, they seemed to constantly change their name, which went from Skid Row to Ted Ed Fred to Pen Cap Chew to Throat Oyster to Bliss to Windowpane.\n\nDuring this period, Kurt was taking the money Wendy gave him for the rent on his shack and spending it on other things, usually drugs. Once again he was evicted for failing to pay the rent, but this time he had\n\nsomewhere to go. Tracy had already invited him ‘to move in with her in Olympia, and his eviction provided the perfect excuse. It was time to leave Aberdeen for good.\n\n3 The Road to Nirvana\n\nKi had mixed feelings about his new hometown. On the one hand, it was much more exciting than Aberdeen, with something to do almost every night and a thriving music scene. But Kurt kind of missed the rednecks and the feeling that he was different. In Olympia, his brand of angry rebel was a dime a dozen. In Olympia, the main feeding ground for these rebels was the ultrahip Evergreen College, which was known for its mix of bohemians, progressive politics, alternative music, and feminists. Kurt had little patience\n\nfor the latter group, and despite his later professions of sympathy toward women's issues, he would call feminists “angry bitches.” It was during his first few months in Olympia that Kurt first experienced the agonizing stomach pain which would haunt him for nearly the rest of his life. Years later he would describe the pain to Details\n\nmagazine: “Imagine the worst stomach flu you've ever had, every single day. And it was worse when J ate, because once the meal would touch that red area, I would hyperventilate, my arms would turn numb, and I would vomit.” Doctor after doctor was puzzled by this ailment and couldn't diagnose\n\nwhat was causing it. Kurt had never been particularly healthy, suffering recurring bronchitis since he was a child. He also suffered from scoliosis (curvature of the spine) and a number of other minor ailments. In later years, when Cobain’s heroin addiction was first revealed, he\n\noa\n\n28\n\nWHO KILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nand his publicists fell back on this stomach ailment as the source of his heroin use, claiming he did heroin only to ease the pain. In fact, Kurt had first shot up nearly a year before, after he met a dealer named “Grunt” on one of his trips to Olympia. By this time, he was a regular user of pot, LSD, Percodans, and magic mushrooms. “He was just about always high on something,” says his friend Rick Hansen. “But that wasn’t exactly uncommon in Aberdeen. The jocks did sports and the stoners did drugs, that’s all there was to do.” His aunt Beverly Cobain says Kurt had an extremely addictive personality and would take large doses of aspirin or cough syrup whenever he wasn't feeling well. “From early childhood it was a religion for Kurt that everything could be cured by drugs,” she told reporters after his death. But the first time Kurt injected heroin into his arm, he knew he was taking his drug use to a different level. He had been offered the drug a number of times before and had always refused, but “Grant” was always anxious to share the exhilaration he felt when he did smack, and told him what a great feeling it was. Kurt finally succumbed. That night Kurt sold his soul to what would become his own personal devil. Kurt and Tracy were living in a tiny apartment at 114 North Pear Street. Visitors to the apartment were intrigued by the bizarre decor. On the refrigerator door was a collage Kurt made out of pictures of diseased vaginas he had found in a medical textbook. And on the shelves were nativity scenes he had constructed full of decayed bodies, skeletons, and demons. He had continued his fascination with dolls and had begun to make his own out of clay in all kinds of strange shapes. All over the walls were his most recent paintings, which often consisted of surreal landscapes peopled by fetuses or mangled animals. From the ceilings in every room hung fly strips covered with dead insects, which stemmed from an obsession of Kurt's. “T have this weird magnetic attraction to flies,” he would explain. “Or flies [are attracted] to me, actually. 'd wake up in the morning and these flies would keep me awake for hours, buzzing and bouncing off my face.\n\nTheyd just attack me and this has happened over and over in my life.” This is hardly surprising considering the squalor of his surroundings. The band would still occasionally perform, bringing in a little income, but not enough to keep Kurt in drugs. Tracy had a decent job at the Boeing plant in Seattle, but she was reluctant to finance Kurt's habit and\n\nTHE ROAD TO NIRVANA\n\n29\n\nconstantly nagged him to get a job, threatening to kick him out if he didn’t. Only after he moved out and slept in the car for two nights did she stop criticizing him, afraid she would lose him. Kurt later included the line “I cant see you every night for free” in his song “About a Girl,” in reference to Tracy's demands that he be responsible for his share. The only work he\n\ncould find was for a janitorial company, earning four dollars an hour. He later recalled driving around town from job to job with “two coworkers\n\nfrom hell worse than your typical brain-dead Aberdonian.” The job of traveling janitor did have its fringe benefits, however. Many of the company's clients were dentists, and Kurt learned how to inhale nitrous oxide (laughing gas), which became one of his favorite highs. Although Kurt should have thrived in the bohemian atmosphere of Olympia, he detested the pretentiousness of the scene, which was dominated by the alternative music label K Records and its head, Calvin Johnson. Kurt contemptuously labeled Johnson's followers “Calvinists,” but he thought the label was pretty cool, and one night in a drug-induced stupor, he went to a tattoo parlor with Dylan Carlson and had the K Records “K” logo tattooed on his forearm. Kurt had his sights set on his\n\nown record deal and began to save up his janitor money to record a demo.\n\nBy this time the band had finally settled on a name Kurt liked, Nirvana. “I wanted a name that was beautiful and nice and pretty instead of a mean, raunchy punk name like the Angry Samoans,” he explained to Michael Azzerad. “I wanted something different.” Little did he know at the time that there were already two other groups named Nirvana—one a sixties psychedelic rock group from England, the other a Christian rock band. Both groups would surface after Kurt hit it big, and they had to be paid off not to sue.\n\nKrist and Shelli had also moved to Olympia, staying with Kurt and Tracy in their cramped apartment for several weeks before getting their own place in Tacoma. Burckhard wasn't taking the band very seriously. He was turned off by the punk rock crowd, recalling, “I'm not that much into that kind of scene where your hair is all different colors and whatnot.” Kurt and Krist\n\nwerent amused when Burckhard frequently failed to show up for their nightly practices, preferring to party with his friends. He never believed the band was going anywhere, and for him it was all just for fun.\n\nKurt had other ideas and finally made the decision to invite his old Melvins buddy Dale Crover to practice with him and Krist as they\n\n30\n\nWHO KILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nprepared to record their demo. With a loan from Tracy, they finally had enough money to go into the recording studio, and chose Reciprocal Records because, according to Kurt, it was the most happening studio in Seattle. Actually, it was the cheapest, which is why it was so popular among fledgling bands. The head of Reciprocal was a former Navy engineer named Jack Endino. The day Nirvana came in to lay down their tracks, he happened to be the only one around, so he ended up producing the group. Endino didn’t believe in sophisticated production techniques. His philosophy was to record groups exactly the way they sounded on stage, which became Endino’s trademark and earned him the title “father of the Seattle sound.” Nirvana spent a little more than six hours in the studio that day, mixing a total of ten songs. The total bill was $152.44. One thing in particular impressed Endino about this session—Kurt’s distinctive vocals. Endino had seen just about every Seattle band come through his studio and usually didn’t pay a lot of attention to the finished product after he delivered the master to the group. But that night Endino made himself a mix and dubbed a cassette, which he gave to his friend Jonathan Poneman of the new label Sub Pop records. Poneman and Bruce Pavitt had founded the small indie music label three years earlier and it quickly built a reputation for its distinct sound, which would become better known as grunge. When Kurt himself heard the tape, he knew it was good and set out to get himself a record deal with any indie label which would accept him, sending out cassettes to a handful of his favorite labels. Enclosed with the demo was always some little gimmick to attract attention, such as a used condom filled with plastic ants. His secret ambition was to be signed to Chicago's Touch & Go records, home of Kurt's idols the Butthole Surfers. Ironically, he never sent one to Sub Pop because he didn't have their address, so he was surprised several days later when he got a call from Jonathan Poneman, who set up a meeting with the band at Seattle’s Cafe Roma. At this meeting—attended by Kurt and a drunken Krist, who was already showing signs of becoming an alcoholic—Poneman expressed interest in putting out a Nirvana single.\n\nSoon after, Sub Pop arranged for Nirvana to play their first Seattle show at the Vogue club in a Sub Pop Sunday showease. Most of the twenty people in attendance weren't very impressed by their lackluster performance, of which Kurt later said, “We sucked. We totally fucked it up.”\n\nTHE ROAD TO NIRVANA\n\n3]\n\nNevertheless, the demo had been circulating around Seattle and was starting to cause a buzz. Crover had left the band by this point, to be replaced by a number of\n\ndrummers who didn’t fit in very well with Kurt and Krist’s ambitions. One\n\nbrief replacement was their old drummer Aaron Burckhard, until he missed a rehearsal and was thrown out of the band for good. (Burckhard later compared himself to Pete Best, the Beatles’ original drummer, who was thrown out of the band just before they made it big.) Finally, Kurt recruited Chad Channing—a drummer he remembered from a band called Tick Dolly Row, who had once opened for Nirvana when they were called Bliss. This combination finally seemed to click. Around this time, Nirvana received their first newspaper review in the free Seattle music fanzine Backlash. In this article, Kurt expressed the fear that people might think Nirvana was just a rip-off of the Melvins, who by then were a huge name in the burgeoning grunge scene. But the reviewer, Dawn Anderson, concluded her piece with the words, “With enough practice, Nirvana could become better than the Melvins.” Kurt\n\nwas ecstatic and soon his legendary ego began to manifest itself. Music writer Christopher Sandford recalls an interview he did around that time in which Kurt called Nirvana “the best fucking band since the Beatles.” Preparing for success, Kurt wrote a bio of the band which he gave to Sub Pop: NIRVANA is a three-piece from the outskirts of Seattle, WA. Kurdt\n\n[sic|—guitar/voice and Chris—bass have struggled with too many\n\nundedicated drummers for the past 3 years...for the last 9 months we have had the pleasure to take Chad—drums under our wings\n\nand develop what we are now and always will be NIRVANA. Willing to compromise our material (some of this shit is pretty\n\nold). Tour any time forever. Hopefully the music will speak for itself. Kurt, Krist, and Chad went back into the studio with Endino to record the single. After recording a number of tracks, they finally settled on “Love Buzz,” with “Big Cheese” (written about Jonathan Poneman) on the flip side. Kurt and the others were excited about the single which they\n\nthought was their big break. Months passed, however, and nothing happened. Kurt had been telling everybody he knew that he had a record and he was getting pretty pissed off at Sub Pop’s inaction. What he didn’t\n\now\n\nWHO KILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nrealize was the precarious financial situation of the then struggling label, which was deep in debt and operating from day to day. This hit home one day when Kurt received a call from Pavitt asking for a two-hundred-dollar loan so they could press the single. Kurt hung up on him, shattered. He had known it was too good to be true. For the next three weeks, Krist and Kurt went on a massive drug and alcohol binge, emerging only\n\nperiodically to spray-paint “Sub Pop Sucks” all over town. Just as the band decided to seek out another label, they got another call in November from Pavitt, informing them Sub Pop had scraped up the\n\nmoney and was releasing the single that month. When he heard the news, Kurt went crazy, running out into the street screaming, “I’m going to be a rock star! Nirvana rules!” When the single finally came out, his enthusiasm was dampened somewhat when he learned of Sub Pop’s plans for it. Pavitt and Poneman had devised a marketing scheme called “Sub Pop Single of the Month,” whereby subscribers would pay a fee to receive one of one thousand handnumbered limited-edition singles. Nirvana’s single was going to inaugurate the scheme, which didn’t go over too well with the band members. “We were really burned out about that,” said Krist. “We put a single out and nobody could buy it.” The Sub Pop catalogue described the “Love Buzz” single as “heavy pop sludge from these untamed Olympia drop-ins.” The group was appeased somewhat when Sub Pop promised them it\n\nwould be sent out to campus and community radio stations (which could make or break alternative music groups) with heavy promotion. Indeed, Kurt heard that Seattle’s University of Washington station, KCMU, started the single on heavy rotation soon after they received it. When he heard the news, he drove with Tracy into the station’s listening range and listened to the radio hoping he would hear the song. After they failed to play it, he went to a phone booth and called the station requesting the single. Twenty minutes later his unmistakable voice came out of the\n\nradio—an event which Kurt would call the happiest moment of his life.\n\n“Tt was amazing,” he told Michael Azzerad. “I never thought Id get to that point. I just thought I'd be in a band and maybe make a demo, but for them to play it on the radio was just too much to ask for at that time. It was\n\nreally great. It was instant success and fame beyond my wildest dreams.\n\nMore than I ever wanted. But once I got a taste of it, I really thought it\n\nwas cool and I thought I would definitely like to hear my future recordings\n\nTHE ROAD TO NIRVANA\n\n33\n\non the radio. And to be able to pay my rent with this band, it would be really great. It made us step up mentally to another level where it was a reality that we could actually live off of this. I didn’t think anywhere past ever being able to afford more than a hundred-dollar apartment. That was going to be the rest of my life—to be in a band and tour and play clubs and hear my songs on the radio once in a while.” If the band had rehearsed hard before the single, their labor could not compare to the grueling practices Kurt forced on them after its release. The buzz from “Love Buzz” was so positive that Sub Pop had mentioned the possibility of an album, although they said an EP was more realistic. Kurt began to refine some of the songs he had written years before and even penned some new ones when he wasn't practicing. Sub Pop had booked the group into Endino’s studio to record but, because of cash flow problems, told them they would have to pay for the studio time themselves. Shortly before they went into the studio—on December 21, 1988, two months before Kurt’s twenty-second birthday—Nirvana was booked for a show at the Hoquiam Eagles Lodge, the not quite prodigal son returning to his birthplace. In honor of the occasion that night, Krist played in his underwear and Kurt painted his neck red—the first of many onstage digs he would direct at his childhood roots. On Christmas Eve, three days later, the band went into the studio to lay down the first tracks on the album which would become Bleach (named for the bleach junkies used to clean their needles). One month and thirty studio hours later, the album was finished. Endino calculated the time and sent out the most famous bill in music history—$606.17—a price tag which the Nirvana publicity machine would tout repeatedly after they hit\n\nit big.\n\nKurt was spending all his spare money on drugs and Krist was unemployed, so they didn’t know how they could pay the bill, until Dylan Carlson introduced Kurt to a friend of his named Jason Everman, who had made a lot of money as a commercial fisherman in Alaska. Everman gave them a loan, and in gratitude the group listed him in the credits as a\n\nguitarist on Bleach, even though he never played on the album. He was a competent guitarist, which the band sorely needed so that Kurt could spend more time on his trademark vocals, and Everman was invited to join the group on their upcoming tour of the West Coast. Around the time Bleach was released in 1989, alternative music was still\n\n34\n\nWHO\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\na relatively fringe music movement, confined to college radio stations and church basements. Poneman and Pavitt knew their rock history and were acutely aware that many American musicians, including Seattle's Jimi Hendrix, had hit it big only after they created a buzz in the United Kingdom. A number of Seattle bands, including Mudhoney and Soundgarden, had already hit the U.K. indie charts, and Sub Pop was anxious to . capitalize on this success. The British saw in Seattle music a regional identity and _ flavor, explained Pavitt, likening it to the success of Motown in the sixties. “The history of rock music is broken down that way—it comes down to labels or scenes. We understood this from the beginning.” With this in mind, Poneman and Pavitt went deeper into debt to bring to the United States Everett True of the influential London music paper Melody Maker. Their investment worked. When True returned, he wrote a series of articles about the Seattle music scene (he even falsely claims to have coined the word “grunge’”). The most important article True wrote as far as Nirvana's career went was titled “Seattle’s New Generation of Thrash Metal Merchants.” The\n\narticle praised groups such as Green River and Beat Happening before focusing on Nirvana: Basically, this is the real thing. No rock star contrivance, no intellectual perspective, no master plan for world domination. You're talking about four guys in their early twenties from rural Washington who wanna rock, who, if they weren't doing this, would be working in a supermarket or lumberyard, or fixing cars. Kurdt Kobain is a great tunesmith, although still a relatively young songwriter. He wields a riff with passion.\n\nAt the time, nobody could anticipate the effect these articles would have on Seattle, the world of music, or Kurt Cobain. What followed was nothing short of an invasion. First, the rest of the British rock press descended on the city to see for themselves what all the fuss was about,\n\nand soon the American music media picked up the theme, trumpeting the\n\narrival of the “Seattle sound” and setting the stage for the eventual day that, as Veronika Kalmar of The Rocket described it, “grunge surpassed the status of a happening regional scene to become a worldwide fashion craze. The American music press were not as unanimous in their enthusiasm\n\nTHE ROAD TO NIRVANA\n\n35\n\nfor Nirvana and Bleach as the British. Rolling Stone labeled the album “undistinguished... .relying on warmed over 70's riffs” (which may have\n\naccounted for Cobain’s lifelong contempt for the magazine). The Conflict\n\nwas even harsher, writing, “If you're going to be a simpleton rock band, then at least be more entertaining than this shit.” Sub Pop moved immediately to capitalize on the attention Nirvana was commanding, organizing a major tour of the United States and Europe. The U.S. leg consisted of twenty-six dates all over the country. Conditions were hardly ideal, as the band piled into a cramped Dodge van, played in small bars, and slept on floors if they were lucky. But most of the band had never been farther than Seattle, and they were thrilled to see all these new places. As the tour progressed, word of mouth started to spread about\n\nBleach thanks to heavy college radio play, and attendance picked up significantly. By the end of the tour, Krist’s increasingly heavy drinking and the dissension between Jason and the other band members had taken their toll. At several shows, Kurt took to smashing his guitar on stage, which earned him several unfavorable comparisons to Pete Townshend by reviewers. Kurt would later say he didn't smash his guitar out of showmanship but to express his disgust with the way the show was going. If the band wasn't playing well or the sound was bad, down would come his guitar, splintering into a hundred pieces and often forcing a premature\n\nend to the show. Kurt's stomach problems continued to plague him, and at one point early in the tour he even collapsed and had to be taken to the hospital. At the end of the tour, Jason was asked to leave the band, never having been repaid the six-hundred-dollar loan which made Bleach possible. Kurt\n\nwould claim he withheld the money for “mental damages.” As the year progressed, Bleach continued to sell steadily and Nirvana attracted more and more attention on the eve of their European tour. In September, they went into the studio to record an EP, which became\n\nBlew. Kurt was determined to record some catchy material in tribute to the pop music he still loved, telling Krist at one point, “Goddammit, I want something I can hum.” When the EP was released, it was criticized by one reviewer who said it sounded too much like the Beatles. Their arrival in Newcastle, England, that fall for their first show in a\n\nthirty-six-show/forty-two-day European tour signaled the first hint of the eventual Nirvanamania which would sweep the world a couple of years\n\n36\n\nWHO\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nlater. Unlike America, where they were lucky if the club was half full, in Europe almost every show was sold out and they were treated like celebrities. At first they reveled in the adulation, but the grueling tour schedule began to take its toll. Once again Kurt started to smash his guitar after only a few songs and walk off the stage. Four songs into their Rome show, where the sound system was particularly bad, Kurt had what Bruce Pavitt called “a nervous breakdown on stage.” He climbed onto a speaker stack high above the stage and hovered above the crowd. Then, just as it was about to collapse, he climbed up into the rafters and held up a chair, threatening to throw it\n\ndown into the stunned crowd below. Finally, after he was subdued, he went backstage and broke two microphones before announcing in tears that he was quitting the band and going home. Poneman, who had flown in with Pavitt for the show, calmed him down and talked him out of it. Kurt was already becoming disenchanted by Sub Pop. Theories abound about the roots of his unhappiness. Kurt and the others weren't particularly impressed when, midway through the European tour, the two label executives flew in first class and booked themselves into a nice hotel while the band had to suffer through what Kurt called “shitola surroundings. ” The Sub Pop publicity machine, anxious to capitalize on Nirvana’s humble beginnings, pushed the image of their white-trash roots on the\n\nBritish press. One profile read: “They're a little bit gross and they're a little bit awesome. What else would you be if you grew up in the backwoods redneck helltown of Aberdeen?” Kurt found these kind of descriptions extremely condescending: “To be thought of as this stump-dumb rocker dude from Aberdeen who just blindly found his way up to Seattle and this hip label,” he recalled. “It just felt kind of degrading to be thought of as someone like that when that was something I was fighting against all my life.” When the band returned from their European tour, they were almost immediately booked for another tour to take advantage of the increasing sales of Bleach, which was starting to create as much of a buzz in the U.S. as in England. Yet, Sub Pop still didn’t have much of a distribution network, and the record was hard to find outside big cities. Nirvana was disenchanted and knew it was time to start shopping around for a real record deal. “When we went on tour,” Kurt later explained, “kids would come up to us in flocks going, ‘Where can we find\n\nTHE ROAD TO NIRVANA\n\nof\n\nthe record? We can't find it.’ That’s the only reason we went with a major is just the assurance of getting our records into small towns like Aberdeen.”\n\nThe group had already recorded some material for what was supposed to be their second Sub Pop album, but unbeknownst\n\nto Pavitt and\n\nPoneman, they started shopping this material as a demo tape to major\n\nlabels. Meanwhile, Kurt had become increasingly unhappy with the drumming of Chad Channing, whose bad timing and lack of power had never really impressed Kurt, who believed good drumming was essential to a\n\ngroups sound. He later told Michael Azzerad that Chad was the reason he smashed his instruments at shows.\n\n“I got so pissed off at Chad that I'd jump into the drum set, then smash my guitar,” he said. Kurt had always put up with Chad in the band because the two got along so well, unlike Jason Everman, whom Kurt despised. Finally, he took the step he thought the band needed if it was going to move to the next level. He reluctantly told Chad he was through. When Chad was fired, Kurt had nobody in mind to replace him and decided to cancel a planned U.K. tour so that he could find a new\n\ndrummer. Dale Crover was temporarily recruited for a short West Coast tour after Kurt agreed to his only condition—not to jump into his drum set under any circumstances. When the band returned from touring, Sub Pop requested another single, and Dan Peters of Mudhoney was asked to sit in on the session which became “Sliver.” Peters also played with the band at their biggest Seattle gig to date, the Motor Sports International, in front of 1,500 people. After the show, Buzz Osbourne introduced Kurt to his friend\n\nDave Grohl, who had just played a gig in Olympia with his Washington, D.C., hard-core band Scream. Osbourne was impressed by Grohl's style and thought he would be perfect for Nirvana, who arranged an audition\n\nthat week. Dave passed the audition and the final edition of Nirvana was born. They knew they had finally found the drummer who was going to take them places. “Kurt and Krist knew—and everybody else knew who saw them play— that they were only a hint of what they could be until Dave joined the\n\nband,” says Slim Moon, Kurt's old neighbor in Olympia and head of Kill\n\n38\n\nWHO\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nRock Stars Records. “He just knew how to play drums and he understood their music.” Soon after Dave joined the band, Nirvana headed back to England to promote the new “Sliver” single, although it still hadn't been released. This time the horrible conditions of their previous tour were just a bad\n\nmemory. Their success warranted a complete entourage, including a soundman, a tour manager, and a monitor man, and, best of all, their own tour bus! They played thousand-seat venues instead of midsize clubs and attracted glowing reviews wherever they played. This time there was no smashing of guitars and walking off the stage. Kurt was exhilarated by the group’s success and the comfortable conditions, and he made sure to reward the crowds who came to see him. When Kurt returned from touring, he headed back to his old apartment in Olympia, where he continued to live after breaking up with Tracy earlier that year. She could no longer tolerate his selfish behavior, she would tell friends. Years later, Courtney Love was going through Kurt's belongings and found some old notes which Tracy liked to post\n\naround the house. They are a good example of Tracy's household style: “1. Good morning. 2. Will you fill up my car with unleaded gas? 3. Sweep kitchen floor. 4. Clean tub. 5. Go to K mart. 6. Get one dollar in quarters.” Kurt never did any of those things.\n\nHe then dated Tobi Vail, an Olympia musician who was later credited with helping found the riot grrrl movement, a feminist offshoot of punk. While dating Tobi, Kurt first started to espouse the prowoman sentiments\n\nwhich would become evident on some of his later songs like “Rape Me.”\n\nBut according to his friend Dylan Carlson, “Kurt could talk the talk but in\n\nprivate he still referred to women as bitches and continued to collect some pretty sick porn.” Years later, Courtney Love told journalist Kim Neely, “Kurt's one of the most liberal people I know, but he looked at me one day and said, ‘I hate it when you read those fucking feminist books.” The band had finally told Sub Pop it was leaving to look for a major record deal. Poneman and Pavitt, who must have known the split was inevitable, felt betrayed but could do little. Shortly after returning from the U.K. tour, Kurt received several phone calls from Danny Goldberg of Gold Mountain, an L.A.-based manage-\n\nment company keen on handling Nirvana’s career. Goldberg assured Kurt\n\nhe could make him a millionaire by securing the group a major deal. The\n\ndollar figures Goldberg was throwing around definitely piqued Kurt's\n\nTHE ROAD TO NIRVANA\n\n39\n\nattention, but he wasn't sure if he trusted this “slick corporate sleazebag, ”\n\nas Kurt described Goldberg to one friend. At first he figured he could negotiate his own deal with a major label without the middleman and their huge commissions. But Gold Mountain persisted. They assigned John Silva, who had indie rock connections, to. convince the band. Silva assured Kurt he had connections with Geffen Records, which he knew was Kurt's first choice. In November 1990, Gold Mountain flew the entire band to Los Angeles first-class to meet with Goldberg and Silva. After this meeting the\n\nband agreed to a management deal. It turned out to be a smart move. Within weeks virtually every major label was involved in a bidding war to see who could sign Nirvana, wining and dining the group in fancy restaurants while Kurt, Krist, and Dave savored the attention. Sonic Youth, whom Kurt revered, had already signed to Geffen, and the\n\nband’s Kim Gordon was calling up Kurt every day, trying to persuade him that Geffen would allow them total artistic freedom, which belied the reputation of major labels for insisting on full creative control. Although the label wasn't offering as much as some of the other majors (rumored to be dangling million-dollar offers), Kurt credited the sealing of the deal to Gordon’s persuasive powers. The deal called for an advance of only $287,000. Even this figure was significantly reduced by taxes, manage-\n\nment fees, and the money needed to buy out Nirvana's contract from Sub Pop. But more important than the money to Kurt was the artistic freedom the band insisted on. “We have one of the best contracts any band has ever had,” Kurt said at the time. “We have complete control over what we do, and what we release, which literally means that if we handed in a sixty-minute tape of us defecating, they would have to release and promote it.” Pavitt and Poneman didn’t know how much leverage their contract with\n\nNirvana gave them—a contract they had signed at the band’s insistence two years earlier. They knew they were losing a gold mine, but they didn't have the heart or the resources for a lengthy legal battle. Geffen offered a $75,000 buyout fee plus 2 percent of sales on the next two Nirvana records. It was this percentage that single-handedly rescued the label from the verge of bankruptcy after the success of Nevermind, although reports\n\nlater indicated Geffen would have gone as high as $1 million to buy out the contract.\n\nAlthough the advance from Geffen was relatively low, Gold Mountain\n\n40\n\nWHO\n\nKILLED KURT COBAIN?\n\nadvised them to take it because it came with a very strong royalty package that would pay off if they succeeded, which, by then, few doubted. Kurt, Krist, and Dave signed their names on the dotted line on April 30, 1991, two months after Kurt's twenty-fourth b: thday. Signing with a major label was not part of the punk ethic, as Kurt was acutely aware. Already his old punk friends were referring to him as a sellout, and Kurt seemed to step up his drug use as his fits of guilt intensified. In attempting to rationalize his decision, Kurt later made up a story for Michael Azerad’s authorized biography, Come as You Are, about how he originally planned what he called a “great rock ’n’ roll swindle.” He claimed that he had contemplated signing with Geffen, taking the money, and then breaking up and signing with the small Olympia punk label K Records. According to Dylan Carlson, Kurt never thought of any such thing. “He was anxious to sign with Geffen,” he recalls. “He knew there would be a lot of resentment by his old friends and he felt a bit guilty but he basically said, ‘Fuck ‘em, they're just jealous.” A few months earlier, Krist and Dave had begun to realize that Kurt was doing heroin fairly regularly—a fact he had tried to keep secret from his bandmates. When Dave asked him what it was like, Kurt replied, “It sucked, it’s stupid. It makes you feel gross and bad. I just wanted to try it.” He told them he wouldn't do it again, but Krist didn’t believe him. He was hardly in a position to lecture Kurt, as he himself was an obvious alcoholic. Soon after the band signed, Nirvana toured Canada, where almost every show was completely sold out, before returning to Seattle, where\n\nthey played one date in which they debuted a new song called “Smells\n\nLike Teen Spirit.” At the time, nobody thought the song was anything special. Geffen brought them to Sound City studios in Los Angeles to record their first album, which the label wanted out as soon as possible. For six weeks the group rehearsed the material and perfected the sound that their new producer, Butch Vig, was searching for. Finally they laid down the tracks and everybody knew they had something big—but nobody could have anticipated just how big. Everybody seems to have a theory about wh"
