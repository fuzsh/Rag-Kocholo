        "text": "Next week, Nirvana’s “MTV Unplugged” performance will be released in visual format for the first time, almost 14 years to the day. I’ve been looking forward to an official release to replace the bootleg I found on the Internet, which is the equivalent of it being taped.\n\nI would consider myself an above-average Nirvana fan. I know a lot of useless trivia about the band and Kurt Cobain, and I migrate to any new news like a fly on fresh feces.\n\nJimi Hendrix was quoted as saying “Once you’re dead, you’re set for life.” A truer statement couldn’t be made about Kurt and the widow Cobain, Courtney Love. Kurt is now the richest dead man – he beat Elvis, John Lennon and James Dean to take that spot.\n\nBeing a rich dead man does have its costs, though – a spoiled legacy, conspiracy theories and a wife who uses you to say how much she can’t stand Dave Grohl (It’s OK, Dave, the Foo Fighters aren’t that bad).\n\nWhat made Cobain so special was that he was the leader of a new generation with one song. He refused to sell out that one song, and he gained cred. He was even afraid he lost all that cred when he signed to Geffen. So I find it funny when Love, the wife of a man who was so anti-establishment and anti-selling-out, sells 25 percent of her stock in the Nirvana catalog, all three albums worth, and she continues to sell and license Cobain’s image at whim.\n\nKurt Cobain has been in more mainstream ads and other media since he died than when he was alive. Doc Marten, Electronic Arts, CBS – those are only a few of the corporations that have taken a bite at the cake of Cobain in recent months.\n\nI enjoy hearing music I like on television and in video games, but I don’t like hearing music that doesn’t belong in anyway. What does the song “Breed” have to do with baseball? Is it to get me pumped to go have sex? I have to finish my game first. That’s bad marketing on EA’s part.\n\nCobain didn’t like the idea of putting his music in commercials; however, he did want to put a song in “Pulp Fiction.” Quentin Tarantino and Cobain became friends in 1993-ish. Here’s a bit of trivia – Cobain was originally planned to be the drug dealer in “Pulp Fiction” and Courtney Love was supposed to be the wife. He couldn’t do it, but Tarantino is still thanked in the “In Utero” booklet. His name is spelled wrong, though.\n\nSince Cobain’s death, we’ve seen and heard him in so many other ways: albums, countless books, DVDs, his personal journals, films and a biopic in the works. And since people like me will always be wanting more, you have to wonder when it stops. It was said there were more than 600 tapes of demos made, and only about 60 tracks were released on the boxset.\n\nI’ll give it a few years before there is another album released of Kurt Cobain demos or the like. Courtney Love can only live on the $50 million she got for selling that 25 percent for so long (she’s already bought a Southern California house big enough for her, her daughter and former Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan each to have their own wing). She has now officially made more from Nirvana than Kurt, Dave and Krist combined.\n\nI will buy “Unplugged” when it comes out on DVD. Not just to work on my collection – I still haven’t bought “Live! Tonight! Sold Out!” I will buy it because I think it is one of the masterpieces of modern music.\n\nI also hold a little bit of hope that Cobain’s daughter Frances can benefit from my spent $14. It’s horrible that her dad became a crazy, shrew-like psychopath late in his life, but more so that her mom still is one."
