        "text": "SEATTLE -- The Seattle Police Department has released new photos of the gun that Seattle music legend Kurt Cobain used to take his own life more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe photos, were released as part of a public records request, show Seattle Police Department Cold Case Detective Mike Ciesynski holding the shotgun. The photos were taken last June and added to the department's investigative file this month, according to police.\n\nThe photos dispel \"a rumor propagated by conspiracy theorists that the shotgun had been melted down to hide evidence in a supposed SPD cover up of a potential murder,\" .\n\nConspiracy theorist Richard Lee has repeatedly tried to get access to photos taken of the Nirvana frontman after his April 1994 death. Lee contends the photos will prove an elaborate conspiracy was behind Cobain's death.\n\nThe department released 35 crime scene photos last year, but Lee's lawsuit attempting to get access to the more graphic photos was thrown out of court last August.\n\nA Seattle detective reviewed all the Cobain case files last year, including evidence photos and statements. He found no new information to change the police conclusion that Cobain took his own life."
