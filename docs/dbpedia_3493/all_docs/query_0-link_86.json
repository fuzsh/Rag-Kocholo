        "text": "There must be something in the water in Georgia. If you look over a list of some of country’s biggest names, the number who are from the Peach state is really astonishing!\n\nSo, on this August 3, which is National Georgia Day. let’s recognize some of the best known artists from the state which is the number-one producer of peanuts. pecans, vidalia onions, and country music stars!\n\n1. Luke Bryan\n\nLuke was born and raised in Leesburg, Georgia, to LeClaire and Tommy Bryan, a peanut farmer. He wrote a song about his hometown called, “Born Here Live Here Die Here, which is the title track of his latest album.”\n\n2. Jason Aldean\n\nJason is from Macon, GA. He was raised by his mother there, but in the summers would visit his dad in Florida. One of his biggest hits, “Dirt Road Anthem,” was actually written by 2 other well known Georgians, Brantley Gilbert and Colt Ford. Take it a step further… It was even written at Gilbert’s house in Georgia, and references Potts Farm which was a hang out for him growing up.\n\n3. Lady A\n\n2 out of the 3 members of this multi Grammy Award winning trio are from Georgia. And their original name was taken from a style of home in the area. Charles Kelley and Dave Hayward are both from the East Georgia area of Evans, which is just outside of Augusta. (That could explain their love of golf). Hillary grew up in Nashville, and met her Georgia bandmates there. Back in 2018 the 2 guys even sang the classic “Georgia On My Mind” during the University of Georgia commencement ceremony.\n\n4. Sam Hunt\n\nThis talented singer-songwriter grew up in the small northwestern Georgia town of Cedartown. It’s there where he developed a love of country music and football. He played for his high school and even went on to play in college, before packing it up and moving to Nashville. His 2013 hit, “Raised On It” is about his roots and his youth.\n\n5. Zac Brown Band\n\nZac proudly touts his home state in a few of his biggest hits. He was born in Atlanta, and grew up in the Lake Lanier region of the north Georgia mountains. In 2004, Zac and his dad opened a music club and restaurant in the Lake Oconee area of Georgia, called “Zac’s Place.” They served southern-style food and eventually sold the business. That’s when Zac decided to buy a tour bus and make music full time. In “Toes,” he mention “leaving Georgia” to dip his toes in the water in more tropical surroundings. “Highway 20 Ride” is a reference to a highway in Georgia that runs between Atlanta and the Georgia/South Carolina state line. “Homegrown” hits the Georgia nail on the head with the lyrics; “I got a piece of land out in the country side, Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine.”\n\n6. Thomas Rhett\n\nEven though Thomas’ dad was a hit country music songwriter and singer, Thomas was raised in Valdosta, GA. His parents are Paige Braswell and Rhett Akins. He learned to play drums in middle school, and had a band in high school, before moving to Nashville. Thomas revisits his country roots in his latest hit, “Country Again.”\n\n7. Alan Jackson\n\nOne of country music’s most famous songs with a Georgia reference has to be “Chattahochee.” Alan Jackson said, ” It’s a song about having fun, growing up, and coming of age in a small town – which really applies to anyone across the country, not just by the Chattahoochee.” Alan was born and raised in Newnan, GA, about 40 miles southwest of Atlanta. He and his immediate family lived in a small home built around his grandfather’s old toolshed. Now that’s country.\n\n8. Cole Swindell\n\nTalk about your small town… Cole grew up in the tiny town of Bronwood, GA. Population 225. The video for one of his biggest hits, “You Should Be Here” was shot in Glennville, Georgia, and follows Swindell’s musical break out, mixed in with his touching homecoming to visit the cemetery where his Dad is buried. The song was inspired by his father, and actually written in the parking lot at Gillette Stadium, where Cole was performing on Luke Bryan’s tour.\n\n9. Trisha Yearwood\n\nThis talented singer, best-selling author, TV host, cook and wife of Garth Brooks grew up in Monticello, Georgia. where her mom was a school teacher and her dad a local banker. Trisha attended 2 colleges in Georgia, Young Harris College (earning an associates degree) and University of Georgia, before dropping out there to move to Nashville. The video to his 2005 top 15 hit, “Georgia Rain,” was shot near her hometown.\n\n10. Brantley Gilbert\n\nThis singer, songwriter and record producer is from Jefferson, GA. He was originally signed to fellow Georgian Colt Ford’s label Average Joes Entertainment, and the 2 wrote “Dirt Road Anthem” together. Brantley’s song “More Than Miles” became a hit in 2013 and featured the lyrics:\n\n“Cause I’m on my way to Tennessee\n\nSingin’ Georgia on my mind\n\nChasin’ what they say’s a dream”\n\n11. Kip Moore\n\nAlthough often seen surfing in Hawaii, Kip is from Tifton, GA. His musical career started while he was going to community college. That’s where he picked up the guitar. Moore played in public for the first time at a restaurant in Valdosta, Georgia, called The Mellow Mushroom. This Georgia country boy had his first #1 hit in 2012. And what’s more country than a song about a truck in a farmer’s field, a girl and some cold beer?\n\nBorn and raised at Country 1025. Carolyn is a concert-lovin’ country music fan.
