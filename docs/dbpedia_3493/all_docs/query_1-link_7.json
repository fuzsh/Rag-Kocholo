        "text": "This article is a part of #KanvasLive, an interactive, cross-platform content series brought to life on the Kanvas app and AOL.com. See more coverage here.\n\nOne of the best kept secrets in the music festival scene is by far Tortuga Music Festival. The country jam takes place on the beach (yes, on the beach!) in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and is all about soaking up the sun and listening to good music.\n\nAOL.com traveled to this hidden gem down south to chat with some up-and-coming and established country music artists that performed at the festival.\n\nOne of the musicians we chatted with was none other than Kip Moore. He's been big in the country music scene since he released his debut album \"Up All Night\" in 2012. Born in Georgia, you can tell where Moore gets his smooth southern accent and charm.\n\nCheck out all of the stars we chatted with at Tortuga:\n\n%vine-url=\"https://vine.co/v/itxIeT0jQ3w\"%\n\nIn the video above, Moore speaks about his most memorable moment with a fan -- one thta's sure to bring tears to your eyes.\n\n\"The most memorable interaction I've had with a fan was with a soldier,\" Moore says. \"He was hiding out, they were being attacked by people over in the Middle East. They were hiding out in a bunker, and they had been there for over 24 hours, and the \"Up All Night\" record was on his iPod and he listened to the record over and over and that's what kept his sanity.\"\n\nTalk about a meaningful moment.\n\nMoore also talked about what the moment meant to him: \"It was a powerful moment for me. That's when you realize the weight of your words\"\n\nWatch the video above to see Moore's full interview.\n\nClick through the gallery below for photos from Tortuga:\n\nThe Tortuga Music Festival took place next to the picturesque B Ocean Hotel & Resort in Fort Lauderdale.
