        "text": "Kip Moore is and has been one of my preferred country music artists for quite some time now. He has and incredibly unique voice and is furthermore extremely talented, and his music has always been something that pleases me.\n\nThe following biographical information comes from Wikipedia.com.\n\nKip Christian Moore is thirty-six years old, born on April 2nd, 1980 in Tifton, Georgia. He attended Wallace State Community College in Alabama where he first began experimenting with the guitar, and gave his first public performance at a restaurant in Valdosta, Alabama titled the Mellow Mushroom. Once he completed his college education he travelled to Hawaii and lived, in his words, in a “little hut” where he learned how to surf and became involved with backpacking. After his Hawaiian getaway he moved to Nashville and in 2004 he signed a publishing deal with the assistance of songwriter and producer Brett James.\n\nMoore has been nominated for several different awards within the country music scene, some examples being New Artist of the Year, Single by a New Artist, Music Video by a New Artist, Breakthrough Video of the Year and New Artist of the Year.\n\nHe released his newest single, “Girls Like You” in early February, and I have been listening to it continuously since I first heard it. Some of my favourite songs by Moore include “Something ‘Bout A Truck”, “Hey Pretty Girl”, “Comeback Kid”, “Wild Ones”, “Beer Money” and “I’m to Blame”. Moore’s music is definitely country, however I find it to have a bit of a rock and roll vibe to it, which is arguably why I enjoy it so much.\n\nAside from being a talented musician and performer, Moore is also a songwriter and has written songs for country music duo Thompson Square and furthermore country musician Frankie Ballard.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with Moore and his incredible music, please check him out. I would be surprised if you’re disappointed."
