        "text": "Donavon Frankenreiter\n\nwith Goodnight, Texas\n\nFor nearly four decades Donavon Frankenreiter has been traveling the globe, first as a professional surfer and now as a musician. Born in Southern California, Donavon spent most of his youth chasing waves, turning pro at the age of 16. These days instead of surf competitions, it’s concert halls that bring Frankenreiter to town, where he entertains audiences with his unique blend of laid-back grooves, philosophical lyrics and soulful delivery. This year, Frankenreiter is releasing his first studio effort in nine years, out Sept. 20, 2024. The album, entitled Get Outta Your Mind, marks the 20-year anniversary of his self-titled debut album.\n\nDoors: 7pm\n\nShow: 8pm\n\nTickets: $30 in advance (plus applicable surcharges), $35 at the door\n\nDavid Bryan and Friends\n\nA Stone Pony 50th Anniversary Event\n\nfeaturing Matt O’Ree Band\n\nDavid Bryan is best known as a founding member, keyboardist and Rock N Roll Hall of Fame inductee with Bon Jovi. David has also worked on scoring music for numerous Broadway projects including earning three Tony awards for his work on “Memphis.” David has also been a longtime collaborator with Matt O’Ree.\n\nMatt’s band will serve as the house band for this show. Matt O’Ree Band will be playing a full opening set followed by David and Friends joining them for the second set. With this show David is celebrating the 50th anniversary of The Stone Pony and his playing in Asbury Park for many years. Join us for what’s going to be a memorable night at the Pony!\n\nMark Weiss will be on hand exhiboting some of his early Bon Jovi photography.\n\nDoors 6:30 pm\n\nEarly show starts at 7:30\n\nTickets: $30 in advance (plus applicable surcharges), $35 at the door\n\nSOMETHING CORPORATE\n\nOut of Office Tour 2024\n\non The Stone Pony Summer Stage\n\nwith Hidden In Plain View\n\n“The band and I couldn’t be more excited for these upcoming dates,” shares front man Andrew McMahon. “We’re having more fun together than ever and the generosity of the fans, both online and at last year’s shows, made it impossible not to come back and do a few more. We hope to see you there!”\n\nThe core members of the Orange County, California quintet – Andrew McMahon(vocals, piano), Josh Partington (guitar), Kevin “Clutch” Page (bass), Brian Ireland (drums), and William Tell (guitar) – reunited in 2023 for main stage performances at the When We Were Young festival and three sold-out headlining shows in Las Vegas and Anaheim. These five special gigs, their first official shows together in 20 years, left their dedicated fanbase clamoring for more. The reunion performances also saw McMahon debut a one-of-a-kind upright piano fully wrapped in Christie MicroTiles LED displaying images and lyrics from throughout the band’s catalog, slated to be front and center once again on the Out Of Office Tour.\n\nSomething Corporate first formed in 1998 when its members were in high school and in a short period of time created quite the stir before going on hiatus in 2005. During its tenure, the highly adored SoCal band released multiple albums, including their major label debut, Leaving Through The Window, in 2002 via MCA Records/Drive-Thru Records, which premiered at the top of the Billboard Heatseekers Chart, and 2003’s North, which entered the Billboard 200 at #24. During its heyday, the band toured extensively worldwide, including a summer on the Vans Warped Tour, graced the cover of Alternative Press magazine, and performed on late-night TV including an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Collectively, Something Corporate – hailed as “one of the most respected groups in the scene with their incredible hooks and emotionally transparent music” (Alternative Press) – has sold more than 1 million total records.\n\n$1 per ticket goes towards The Dear Jack Foundation, which provides impactful programming that directly benefits adolescents and young adults diagnosed with cancer in order to improve their quality of life and create positive health outcomes from treatment to survivorship for patients and their families.

Nielsen will perform the album from start to finish (and then some) this fall at 26 very special North American shows.\n\nChinese Fountain is The Growlers’ fourth studio album and sees the band evolve from a psych-circus, while remaining true to the band’s “beach goth” essence. It is blessedly direct, with razor sharp songwriting and engaging melodies at the center of every song; “Big Toe,” “Going Gets Tough,” “Love Test,” “Rare Hearts” and or course, the disco-punk and synth-splashed title track. It was that track that signaled the band’s move from the dive bar to the dance floor–a precursor of sorts to the band’s follow-up, the Julian Casablancas-produced City Club.\n\nUncompromising, enigmatic, and wildly ambitious, Nielsen isn’t tiptoeing into his solo career. The energetic singer has had a busy couple of years, embarking on headline tours where he regularly performs more than two hours each night, sometimes stretching his show past the three-hour mark.\n\nHis latest singles “Tropical Cowboy” and “Chew My Heart Out,” function as a duo. A couple. A gemini gesture to herald his upcoming second solo album, A Ride I’m Waiting For. Originally written in 2014 for Chinese Fountain, the songs are a sneaky flashback to a different era when The Growlers released tracks as “couples.” Not singles, but two songs together, intertwined in thought and expression.\n\nYou can hear the new tracks live at the upcoming Chinese Fountain 10th Anniversary Shows as well as songs from Nielsen’s 20-track solo debut One Match Left and subsequent The Circle and Psycho EPs. Nielsen’s dynamic set lists have been loaded with Growlers’ classics, deep cuts, choice covers, and stripped-down, unplugged mini-sets.\n\nAided by a live band that includes Growlers drummer Richard Gowen, bassist Brogan Dutcher, keyboardist Cole Riddle, and guitarists J.D. Carrera and Elyadeen Anbar, Nielsen melds the live spontaneity of the improv-driven rock scene with the energy of his punk peers.\n\nNectar’s Presents\n\nDaniel Donato’s Cosmic Country\n\nThere are a lot of musical influences and sources that Daniel Donato has drawn on during his career and that inform his latest album, Reflector, his first all-original album. But within those, Donato has carved out a unique and individualized spot for himself, one that speaks to the deep American music heritage that inspires him — and that he’s pushing towards the future with inspired, intentional vigor.\n\nHe calls it Cosmic Country, a moniker that’s both self-descriptive and a statement of purpose. It’s an organic rock band aesthetic with plenty of roadhouse twang; a showcase for Donato’s instrumental virtuosity and facility for melodically infectious songcraft. Bridging Nashville and the Great West, Kentucky and mid-60s northern California, tie-dye and plaid, it’s a world of his own, and a wide world of musical adventure at that.\n\nWhile growing up in Nashville his father, who turned his young son on to music of all genres, suggested the fledgling and industriously minded (even at just 14) artist start busking in Nashville’s lower Broadway area and outside concerts, for eight hours at a time on the weekends. One night, the two happened by Robert’s Western World where legendary honky-tonk local mainstay the Don Kelly Band were performing. “Their songbook was that of my main influences still to this day — Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Bob Wills, Marty Robbins, Bill Monroe, traditional bluegrass music, Hank Williams Sr. — old-timey music with real stories and emotions that everybody has. It just hooked me right away.” Donato eventually became a member of the band, playing four hours a night at Robert’s (464 shows in total).\n\nAnother piece of the puzzle came through later in Donato’s teenage years — the Grateful Dead, thanks to a high school American History teacher who gave him a pile of bootleg recordings when he was 18. “When I discovered Jerry Garcia, there’s really never been anyone who writes like that,” says Donato. “From there I went on to discover Bob Dylan and all the great writers and made me want to make that part of what I did as well.”\n\nThe whole package of player, singer, writer and band leader was in place. Two albums in, Daniel Donato and Cosmic Country, featuring Nathan Aronowitz (keyboards/guitars/vocals), Will McGee (bass/vocals) and Will Clark (drums, percussion/vocals) are selling out venues throughout the country and bringing their brand of Cosmic Country to an ever growing, passionate fanbase.\n\nDoor 7:00 PM\n\nShow 8:00 PM\n\nTickets: $25 advance (plus applicable service charges), $30 at the door\n\nFantastic Cat\n\nFantastic Cat returns to Asbury Park for a headline show at the Pony!\n\nHailed by Rolling Stone as “the supergroup you need to know,” Fantastic Cat released their debut, The Very Best of Fantastic Cat, in 2022. The collection earned the vocal-trading, instrument-swapping collective their national TV debut, sold out headline dates around the U.S. and Europe, a performance at the Sundance Film Festival, and a song in the Paramount+ series Tulsa King. In 2023, the velvet-suited four-piece teamed up with all-star producer Butch Walker for a 50th anniversary take on Band on the Run,” which reportedly prompted Paul McCartney to question his entire life’s work.\n\nIndividually, each member of Fantastic Cat boasts their own impressive resume along with appearances everywhere from the New York Times and the Tiny Desk to Bonnaroo and Cayamo. NPR said Anthony D’Amato “sings and writes in the tradition of Bruce Springsteen or Josh Ritter.” Paste declared Don DiLego’s latest album a “stunner.” Rolling Stone called Brian Dunne’s new record “the sleeper album of the year” and praised Mike Montali’s band, Hollis Brown, as “the soundtrack for a late-night drive through the American heartland.”\n\nWhere the band’s debut showcased the quartet as individual songwriters, their latest, Now That’s What I Call Fantastic Cat, finds the group writing collectively for the first time, leaning into their respective strengths to craft an alternately poignant and absurdist portrait of a modern world populated by disgraced heroes, disenchanted dreamers, and dead end jobs. The songs are at once hopeful and mordant, reckoning with a reality less shiny than it once seemed by refusing to succumb to the weight of disillusionment, and the performances are relentlessly buoyant to match, fueled by infectious hooks, lush harmonies, and gleefully unpredictable arrangements. Think CSNY if none of them were famous, or The Traveling Wilburys if none of them were famous, or the Eagles if they really didn’t get along.\n\n“A wildly satisfying collection of folk-rock, country, Americana, and good old rock & roll…equal doses of Dylan and Springsteen,” says Rolling Stone\n\nDoor 7:00, Show 8:00 to 11:30\n\nTickets: $30 Adv plus applicable surcharges/ $35 dos\n\nKIP MOORE\n\nNomad Tour\n\nwith Hannah McFarland\n\nHailed as “an uncompromising, genre-defying artist firing on all cylinders” (Vice/Noisey) and “one of country’s more thoughtful artists” (Billboard), multi-platinum selling singer/songwriter Kip Moore has blazed his own trail and cemented his place as one of music’s most beloved artists. Beginning with his auspicious debut in 2012, Moore has since released five critically acclaimed albums and penned over a dozen chart-topping singles, including the multi-platinum hits “Something’ ‘Bout a Truck,” “Hey Pretty Girl,” “Beer Money,” and “More Girls Like You.” With over 1 billion streams and 2.5 million monthly listeners, he’s performed sold-out headline shows in stadiums around the world including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, The U.K., Europe, and the U.S., leading to a nomination for CMA’s International Artist Achievement Award. His most recent album Damn Love was praised by Holler as “the best album of Kip Moore’s career” while earning further acclaim from Billboard, Music Row, and American Songwriter. Moore also appeared on Good Morning America to perform the album’s lead single and title track.\n\nTickets: $35 in advance (plus applicable surcharges), $40 at the door\n\nVIP packages available\n\nKIP MOORE\n\nNomad Tour\n\nwith Hannah McFarland\n\nHailed as “an uncompromising, genre-defying artist firing on all cylinders” (Vice/Noisey) and “one of country’s more thoughtful artists” (Billboard), multi-platinum selling singer/songwriter Kip Moore has blazed his own trail and cemented his place as one of music’s most beloved artists.

Fronting Alter Bridge, his soaring vocals, open-hearted lyrics, and airtight riffs have fueled the group’s global impact as a critically acclaimed, arena-filling force of nature over two decades-plus.\n\nOn the microphone for Slash and The Conspirators, his towering range and magnetic stage presence has consistently stunned audiences since 2010. Becoming a celebrated collaborator, he’s the rare presence just as comfortable on a track with Disturbed, Halestorm, and Sevendust as he is with Gov’t Mule and Darryl “DMC” McDaniels. It’s why he’s generated over 1 billion cumulative streams, earned gold and platinum certifications worldwide, uplifted countless fans, and KERRANG! christened him “one of rock’s finest vocalists.” It’s also why he’s carved out his own lane.\n\nWith two solo efforts under his belt and sold out headline tours in the rearview, a sense of keenly honed intuition guides his third full-length LP, The Art of Letting Go [Napalm Records]. “I’ve been going through a massive Bruce Lee kick, no pun intended,” he smiles. “His quote, ‘Be water, my friend’, always stuck with me. On a grander scale, it represents the record. It’s an exercise in removing prior restrictions and shattering the parameters I set up for myself as a solo artist. This is a rock record. In the past, I thought rock might be a little too close to the other projects. Instead, I just let go and embraced my essence as a singer, guitar player, and writer. This is who I am. This is my DNA. Instead of being apologetic and shying away from it, I’m letting go and being myself.”\n\nTickets: $29.50 in advance (plus applicable surcharges), $35 at the door\n\nDEAN LEWIS\n\nThe Epilogue World Tour\n\nDEAN LEWIS, an Australian singer-songwriter, is renowned for his heartfelt lyrics and emotive voice. Born on October 21, 1987, in Sydney, Australia, he gained international fame with his hit single “Waves” in 2016, celebrated for its raw emotional depth. His debut album, “A Place We Knew,” released in 2019, solidified his status in the music industry with hits like “Be Alright” and “7 Minutes.”\n\nInspired by the British rock band Oasis, Dean’s musical style and passion for songwriting reflect their influence. His music often delves into themes of love, loss, and personal growth, resonating deeply with audiences worldwide.\n\nIn 2023, Lewis performed over 100 shows across Australia, Europe, and the US. He recently concluded a series of global tour dates, including supporting slots for AJR Brothers on their US arena tour and James Arthur on his UK arena tour.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, Dean released his new single “All I Ever Wanted.” This latest release follows the success of “Memories,” which arrived in February. “Memories” has achieved notable milestones, including 35 million streams, inclusion in Hot Hits Australia, and reaching the Top 25 on the AU Radio Chart and Top 20 on the AU Shazam chart.\n\nHe has received several nominations and awards, including ARIA Music Awards and APRA Awards, highlighting his significant impact on the contemporary music scene.

Released on the heels of his 717 Tapes compilation, Pretty Little Poison positioned Zeiders as Nashville’s newest headliner at just 24 years old.
