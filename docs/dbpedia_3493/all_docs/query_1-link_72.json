        "text": "My first trip to Nashville, and to the Mother Church of Songwriting, meant so much more than a show to me. I kept it a secret beforehand because it felt so personal, so deep and so necessary, not just for the music or for book research but because something inside me needed everything this experience could give me. I learned more than I thought possible in one night—about myself, the songwriter’s life, and the light and dark faces of Nashville. My experience on that Friday night went beyond music. I had a front row seat to the highs and the lows, the raw emotion and grit and elation and heartbreak of choosing a life you love that lifts you up and beats you down in the same breath. What I saw on the artists’ faces and what I felt in that room will stay with me for a long, long time.\n\nWhen I chose to set Guitar Man in Nashville, I hadn’t been there but felt a pull—I’ve been searching for so long for a place that feels like home. I wanted Nashville to feel like that; more than anything I ache to find a place that embraces me. As fate would have it, in November Mumford & Sons posted a concert date—April 15th—so I bought my tickets and made plans for my first visit. The Universe laughed at those plans.\n\nIn mid-March, after I booked my flight, hotel and car, I read that Kip Moore would be playing at the iconic Bluebird Café with none other than his mentor, frequent co-writer and co-producer of his albums, Brett James…on the Friday before my trip!\n\nI moped. Cried a little. Took a deep breath and…\n\nBought another plane ticket, rented another hotel room and reserved another car. Because once I made up my mind, I knew it was something I needed to do—for ME.\n\nAfter a little research, I discovered that I couldn’t get reservations for one of only ninety available seats until four days before the show—and that my odds of actually getting in were slightly higher than being struck by lightning while cashing in my Powerball winnings. After an aborted attempt to get a pre-reservation on March 28th (a calendar-related mistake) that resulted in me almost canceling my plans and staying home, I asked myself the question I would ask over and over again while in the city: In the future, do I want to tell people the story about the adventure I didn’t take??\n\nWell, of course not!\n\nThis visit felt like fate. A promise formed in the back of my mind: a resolution to meet the “Real Nashville.” Whatever that meant, I knew I wanted it. I would go—even if it meant camping out on the sidewalk for six hours with the chance of being turned away at the door. I trusted that if it was meant to be, I’d get in.\n\nOn Monday, April 4th, thanks to a series of small miracles, I got the second-to-last seat in the house. The show sold out in minutes.\n\nHeading out of the airport on an unseasonably chilly Friday, I set my GPS and made the Bluebird Café my first stop. Unassuming and faded, that dusty blue awning in a tiny strip mall doesn’t give a clue to the magic inside.\n\nFueled now with anticipation on the way to my hotel, I caught my first glimpse of Nashville itself! The skyline is breathtaking and my first view of the AT&T (aka Batman) Building—with which I’ve developed an obsession thanks to the TV show Nashville—delighted me into laughter. Happiness turned to elation at hearing Running For You on the radio for the first time just as I crossed Demonbreun Street, headed for Broadway.\n\nBroadway really was as bright and flashy as I’d pictured, even in the daytime. Honky tonks, bars, boot and hat shops all butted shoulders with souvenir stores, westernwear boutiques and museums. A cold breeze, laden with the scents of barbecue, beer and an undercurrent whiff of humanity, reddened my nose. Live music spilled from every doorway. A sexy poster of Charles Esten (Deacon from Nashville) decorated a window. The added influx attending the Tin Pan South songwriter’s showcase meant that the normally busy streets crawled with people like a musical anthill.\n\nI drove the Broadway circuit three times and, intimidated even by the smallest crowd of strangers in a big city, almost—almost—pointed the car back to the hotel. Instead, I asked myself The Question, found a parking space and chose the adventure. After a stomach-brain fueled stop in at Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville for live music, an adult beverage and Volcano Nachos, I waded into the hustle and bustle.\n\nIn the end, I found some breathing room by crossing to the far side of the Cumberland River on the Shelby Street Pedestrian Bridge—close to downtown but just far enough away to feel some space around me. Whatever else I may feel about being alone in a strange city, Nashville is beautiful—a cross between heart-stopping and “my parachute won’t open but it sure is a pretty way to die.”\n\nThe time came at last for my Bluebird evening. Despite the party atmosphere at the door, a hush falls when you walk in and the intimate setting wraps you in warm light and history. Hundreds of songwriters watch from every wall. All the greats have played here—Dylan and Springsteen among them. For in-the-round performances, the tables sit inches from the artists’ chairs and strangers become friends in a shoulder-to-shoulder, knee-to-knee communion. My seat was the best at the bar, directly across from Kip’s chair, with a clear line of sight over the heads of the packed house. Also, the lack of reservations didn’t dampen the spirits of those left outside, many of whom simply hunkered down on the sidewalk in the cold night air and listened to the entire show on outdoor speakers. That’s how much people love this music!\n\nAs I sat at the bar, nursing a hard cider and soaking up the atmosphere, a man with instrument case in hand caught my eye and I turned to find Kip walking past! After dropping his guitar in the corner, he ordered a Stella (that very beer bottle now sits on my writing desk!), checked out the crowd and then nodded and said hello to me. It feels good to be a familiar face after just three shows!\n\nAll the performers that night, including those in the earlier show, belong to Brett James’s publishing house, Cornman Music. Our group, consisting of Kip, Justin Weaver and Caitlyn Smith, were his original writers; Kip was his first. The chemistry reminded me of family—sharing tales, tall and otherwise, accompanied by relentless teasing colored with genuine love and respect. I laughed out loud at the banter between Kip and Brett—priceless stories of friendship and sometimes tough times. That’s the love of brothers right there—unconditional. There’s a side to songwriting and music that connects people in ways that other careers just can’t. Music is a thread of emotion that runs through life and those who weave those threads share a bond that frays or twists sometimes but never really breaks.\n\nKip started the show with Crazy One More Time, after which the spotlight passed to Justin, then Caitlyn and finally Brett as each chose from their personal songwriting catalog before returning once again to Kip to begin the cycle once more. Kip played and told the stories of his own songs, giving us My Baby’s Gone (a bluesy deep track), a new song, Fast Women (upbeat but somehow sad), the exquisite Motown-inspired That Was Us and finally, universal love song Hey Pretty Girl. We heard a host of radio hits from Justin and Caitlyn, including Justin’s version of his Kip co-write, I’m To Blame, which wouldn’t have been the same if Kip hadn’t joined in and rocked the house! Brett performed hits he wrote for American Idol performers, including a rousing version of Something in the Water where he encouraged all of us to sing along to Amazing Grace. Talk about CHURCH! We sang; Brett sang; Kip closed his eyes and swayed to the music.\n\nThis night of communion introduced me to the darker, grittier side to the life of a songwriter/artist as well; it was written in stark relief on Kip’s face as I watched him react to the music, the audience and the stories. Though I witnessed plenty of joy and laughter that evening, I also saw pain and anxiety, uncertainty and weariness. He spoke of having the jitters in the intimate setting and I felt it—you’re on naked display without a bombastic stage show behind you. Something very vulnerable and empathetic flowered inside the creative part of me, being that close and seeing the emotions wash across Kip’s face. And oh, that last song of the night…\n\nCaitlyn sang This Town Is Killing Me, a plaintive, haunting ballad about the songwriter’s life in Nashville. The room shrank to the size of music and a hundred hearts beating. Caitlyn’s voice cracked. Justin hung his head. Brett’s eyes misted. Kip went…somewhere far away, face shadowed under his cap. Then he raised his head; in a flash of blue, Kip’s eyes met mine and what I saw there tore my heart open and stole my breath. This life…it looks like one big party from the outside but remember—these are real people with real fear and hurt, loss and struggle, just like the rest of us. Poignant reminders of humanity on a special night.\n\nAs always, I felt grateful to get some face time with the artists after the show, including a picture with Brett James, who is on my list of inspirations now that I know how much his work has colored my world all these years. Plus, Kip hugged me and said, “It’s good to see you again!” (That recognition means a lot to me, considering how many thousands of people he meets in a week.) He then signed my I’m To Blame shirt for the fourth time and even stopped, guitar in hand, on his way out the door to take a picture with my friends and me.\n\nThere’s a reason Kip’s fans are so loyal and die-hard. The exhaustion and jet-lag were written in the slump of his shoulders and shadows under his eyes but he still gave it his best, then stayed to sign autographs and take pictures and give hugs with a smile on his face. Lately, I feel guilty because Kip gives so much so often and people—including me—always seem to want something from him, only now I know the cost of that. I wonder what I have to give that could possibly compare. Right now it’s appreciation; I tell him “thank you” every time I see him. My heart is filled with good feelings for these folks who make the music that weaves in and out of my life—and for Kip, for the inspiration that lights my own creative fire.\n\nThere’s something so fitting about seeing Nashville in the dark at the end of the day through bleary, enlightened eyes. I went in looking for the joy and the inspiration and I found them. I also found the pain, the grind and the reality of what it feels like to choose a life of music. Maybe I had never gotten close enough to see it and taste it and smell it and even touch that grit and rough texture of life behind the scenes. Maybe my own lack of sleep gave me perspective—experiencing how much MORE you feel and want to put it down on paper when you’re weary and haunted. I left with a whole new point of view for my book and new way of seeing Nashville and songwriting and music. I want to write about what I found out, once it untangles itself from the piece of my heart that’s still missing. I may not have gone home feeling a certainty that Nashville is the home I’m looking for, but when that plane took off, I felt the ache—the hole—that leaving left behind.\n\nTo be continued…\n\nOn October 8th, I made a pilgrimage. To Bethlehem. To see a star.\n\nYes, it was Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and yes, it was a country music star, but considering that music is my religion and listening to Faith When I Fall is a spiritual experience bar none, seeing Kip Moore in concert was pretty much the equivalent of going to church on a Thursday night. Come to think of it, if the preacher’s wearing a backwards trucker cap and a T-shirt with the sleeves cut out and can sing like a whiskey-soaked archangel, well, that’ll get me in the door of any church!\n\nThis house of worship may have been the Sands Bethlehem Event Center and right next door to a casino, but that’s a trifling detail. I made the two-hour drive (well, three hours—thanks, traffic!) through the Poconos on a gorgeous fall day. The changing leaves and blue skies couldn’t have made things any more perfect since I was already primed to immerse myself in the music that saved my life, my heart—and maybe my soul, too. It’s hard to describe the feeling of knowing that finally—FINALLY—I was going to get to see Kip perform in person. To be surrounded by the songs. To feel the heat of the lights and the press of the crowd and be a part of something that’s felt bigger than me since the first day and the first downloaded song.\n\nI arrived two hours early, which is pretty late for me! Not that it hurt me any—I was still fourth in line at the VIP entrance after taking a brief detour to take pictures of the Wild Ones semi and the tour buses. I spent most of my time in line peering around at the scenery and in the process (while everyone else was talking or texting and not looking) saw Kip walking away from the bus and later, Dave and Erich doing the same. Amazing what you miss when you’ve got your face in a phone, right? That’s something Kip’s always saying and I’d learned myself at other shows, so I promised myself I’d take one picture of each performance and then put the phone away. (As it turned out, my phone battery died during the acoustic performance so I just enjoyed the show from that point on!)\n\nI’ve been front row plenty and had quite a few VIP experiences, but this one topped them all! You’ve got to know that I’ve met a couple famous folks and I relate to them as people. No pedestals. I pride myself on being pretty casual during meet and greets. I’m not a total geek. Not usually. Then again, before Bethlehem, I’d never met one of my inspirations. So, in line at the Sands, I’m leaning against the wall staring out at the stage when it suddenly hit me that behind that curtain RIGHT OVER THERE is…KIP MOORE! And I’m getting closer to the curtain by the minute. I mean, this is the man who sings the songs that have been my lifeline for the the last five months and for that entire time, all I could think is how much I wanted to thank him. And he’s RIGHT OVER THERE! I barely had time to recover from that thought when I rounded the corner to see Kip standing right in front of me. Not a video; not a picture; not on a screen. I’m so proud of myself—I didn’t drool; I didn’t stammer or sweat or faint. I shook his hand, introduced myself, told him it was a true pleasure to meet him and they took the picture and sent me off to the stage. It was fast, short and very sweet. Kip’s very down-to-earth and he has a warm smile. Um…and really nice arms. Just sayin’. Going in, I maybe wanted to pose for the picture so I’d look all sexy on Facebook but instead I could only bust out my biggest ear-to-ear grin because happy can’t begin to describe…\n\nGeeked. Yup.\n\nWhat came next lives on in my memory as an experience I’ve never had before and can’t WAIT to have again! I took my position on the rail, just about fifteen feet to the left of Kip’s mic (and made friends with a cool gal named Maria), the spotlight clicked on and the man himself came out with his acoustic guitar and sat down to play a few for us. (It was billed as a two-song performance. Fortunately Kip wasn’t one to stick to the program.) I can only imagine what it must feel like—the first night of a new headlining tour, facing down a hundred people in the VIP and wondering if it’s going to be all you want it to be. I can say it was more than I could have imagined so I hope it felt as good to Kip as it obviously did to all of us!\n\nHe took requests, so I got to hear some of my playlist favorites. The very first song was Tough Enough, which I’ve listened to so many times that the words just flowed: Baby I’m tough enough, Baby I’m rough enough to fight for your love, to take on your love… I love that song in all its Springsteeny goodness. Any girl wants to hear that their man’s sticking in no matter what! Next, he played my request! I really wanted to hear Hang A While, and after some banter, he gave it a go for me—he managed to like Kentucky bourbon, smoke weed, like crazy women and deal with someone’s idea of sin; then when he forgot the next line, the chorus of shouts from the audience had me giggling. (Oh hey Kip: I was the only one who shouted the right line—I like the feel of leaving—while everyone else drowned me out and skipped to the end and I like being single. Yup.) Feels like something’s happenin’, I ain’t sure what to do, no I ain’t quite ready to say goodnight to you… No, neither am I, Kip. Thank goodness there was more. He treated us to an alternative version of Everything But You—took us down that pathway to the ocean. I swear I could smell the sea breeze, taste the wine (and I don’t even LIKE wine!) and see those stars against that midnight sky. We got a preview of Girl of the Summer next. The acoustic twist added just the right touch of longing for the one that got away.\n\nAnd then—a treat! Kip said he was going to play us a brand new song; one he’d just written and never played for anyone before. He made everyone put their phones away, saying that everything doesn’t need to be documented and that this song was for us and only us. A hush fell over the crowd as Kip struck up a swaying beat. The song? It was Guitar Man. And it was PERFECTION. EXQUISITE. By the end, I was humming along, exuberantly la-da-da-ing and singing the chorus, knowing in my heart of hearts that Kip’s got another hit on his hands and I’ve got another favorite. Yeah, the fruits of my labor’s when the crowd sings along/nothing short of a savior, still I go home alone/I’m an empty, faceless spotlight mic stand/I’ll get ya high, I’ll get ya low, I’m a guitar man.\n\nConcert? What Concert? Oh, you mean there’s MORE??? Or Moore… <grin>\n\nI’ve never understood why people don’t show up for the opening acts. They’re such a great part of the concert experience and Kip picked a couple true wild ones for this tour! Chris Cavanaugh was first and a complete natural onstage. He knew how to get the audience going—had us all singing along and waving our beers—his songs were excellent and he left me wanting more so I bought his CD. I never saw Kip perform at the start of his journey, but I bet Chris is a lot like that. He’s got chemistry and I figure I’ll be hearing a lot more about him in the next few years. He’s Baby Kip Moore. Maybe needs to work on the arms, though. <grin> Michael Ray put on a dynamic show—tons of energy, big smile, and an epic jump off the stage and climb into the audience (I got to slap hands with him and pat him on the back) that damn near gave the head of Sands security a freaking heart attack. (Also basically rock-blocked us when Kip went to try the same thing and the Gestapo came running out waving his arms to stop him. C’mon dude! Lighten up already!) The high point of Michael’s show was a cover of Dust on the Bottle that had everyone in the Event Center on their feet singing along. Definitely worth anyone’s time and got us hyped for the main event!\n\nYou know how that in-between time is like murder, waiting for the show to start? Well, I was too busy chatting with Maria, making friends with Jerry the security guard (NOT the Gestapo, and Jerry’s the one who fetched me Adam’s guitar pick when it landed in no man’s land between me and the stage. It pays to play nice!) and laughing at the scuffling drunken catfight behind me. You’ve got to have a sense of humor, people. Get a grip; this shit is supposed to be FUN!\n\nAnd then? The lights went blue and and the humming refrain of Muse’s “Madness” crept over the audience. The crowd hushed; then the murmur began, a buzz that got louder and louder and turned into a roar as the room went black, the lights came up and The Slow Hearts—Adam and Erich, Dave and Manny—poured onto the stage, striking up a tribal drumbeat with pulsing bass, ushering in a triumphant Kip Moore—Everybody raise your glass!\n\nFrom the opening thump of Wild Ones through twenty-four songs to the last closing chord, this show had an energy and spirit different from anything I’ve ever felt at a concert. Underlying every song was a heartbeat that drew the audience together, playing our emotions as effortlessly as any guitar. Kip tickled and teased, brought us up, up, up to a resounding crescendo and then slid us effortlessly down into a smooth, soft acoustic set before starting the rollercoaster climb once again. The entire experience was breathtaking and mind-blowing and the aftermath left me feeling like I needed a cigarette and a few Hail Marys. If you think music can’t be as good as the best sex you’ve ever had, well, you haven’t seen Kip Moore in concert!\n\nAfter Wild Ones got us all begging for a little loving, a little touching, a little kissing and a-hugging and we were all bumpin’ to the beat, Kip busted out one of my all-time favorites, What I Do. From the first minute I heard I’m a midnight lover on the loose/I’m a wild card baby, through and through/Gimme a guitar and I’ll pick some sings for you/’Cause that’s what I want and that’s who I am/That’s what I do, I could have about jumped Kip in all that glorious authenticity. Still could, really. <grin> Next came Girl of the Summer—a second time for us VIPs. There’s something so tough-guy plaintive and stark about I see I was just another sunset fading in your eyes/I may never love another like my girl of the summer, sung with that touch of gravel. The perfect lead-in to the rebellious bravado of Reckless (Still Growin’ Up)—Maybe I’m reckless/Maybe bad luck/Hell, maybe I’m way too much about having fun… Adam tossed his pick during this song and lucky for me, in the scuffle it bounced into no man’s land. Thanks to Maria’s eagle eye and my buddy Jerry the security guard, I scored it a couple songs later when he grabbed it for me.\n\nAt this point things started to ramp up and get raucous—perfect timing for the crowd-pleaser Beer Money. With a rousing chorus of C’mon c’mon, baby I’m buying/I’ve got enough to last us all night and you’ve got the kiss that tastes like honey/and I’ve got a little beer money! Kip played both sides of the audience off one another in a bid to see who could sing loudest. Our side lost but I think it was rigged. Just sayin’.\n\nAfter a quick trip through Jimmy Eat World’s The Middle, the banjo jangled and drums pounded into the song that started it all for me—I’m To Blame. No, they don’t make guys like me/You get exactly what you see/I come from a long line of bloodline that ain’t gonna change/So take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger/I know where to aim, hell I’m to blame. The crowd surged forward, pistol-pointing fingers at the ready while Kip danced his boots off on top of the risers. Without so much as a chance to catch our breath, we were then swept up in the pounding intro of Come and Get It, inciting the audience into a floor-shaking stompfest—Girl, what’s the matter with you? Can’t you see it when it’s standing right in front of you—come and get it! Hell, I’ve never been so tempted to risk ejection from a show and make a flying leap for the stage, and I’m sure I wasn’t alone! After the energy of the crowd hit a fever pitch, the lights turned red and Kip struck the first chord of Backseat. The place went NUTS. Like BATSHIT. Like, Kip’s up there singing the two of us in the backseat, surfing a wave of pure estrogen while every guy in the audience is enjoying a contact buzz. I wouldn’t want to be the guy mopping the floor at the end of the night and that’s all I’m saying about that!\n\nAt the point where every last one of us was hot and bothered (not to mention hot and sweaty), the first acoustic set was a sweet, sweet cool down. I was just about undone in the first minute by five seconds of eye contact when Kip sang Hey Pretty Girl, can I have this dance? That’s what you call a moment. By the way, Mr. Moore, the answer’s always going to be yes. Ask me again. I got my breath back just in time to have it taken away by a heart-stoppingly gravel-laced belting of the first verse and chorus of Lean On Me. It’s like that song was written just so Kip could come along and sing it. I’d give a body part—maybe even an important one—to hear him do the whole thing.\n\nTime for another trip up the coaster with That’s Alright With Me. Starts off slow and easy and bumps right over the top into my favorite party anthem for unapologetic individuality—I like whiskey and tight denim on good hearted women and for that I make no apologies/They call me country, call me hippie, the Wildcat from Dixie/And if you do or don’t like what you see, that’s alright with me. Me too! Once everyone was back in dance mode, the hoedown reached new heights during Burn the Whole World Down, a stomping, clapping country middle finger to the doubters, wet blankets and dream-killers in our lives. You said it’s hard to say I love you but it’s hard to say I don’t/And that ain’t enough to keep me hangin’ around/If your daddy tries to stop me I’m gonna make damn sure he don’t/I’m gonna get out of this town and burn the whole world down! A perfect segue into the defiant Dirt Road. This song is powerful. Like Kip, I’ve never been nothing, nothing more than what you see and I’ll stick to simple faith and leave the brimstone behind. The critics can say what they want about the song but then again, they didn’t hear the entire audience singing along. Hearts took wing.\n\nThen another quiet moment, starting with an acoustic rendition of Complicated. There’s a lot of REAL in the song and just about anyone who’s been there understands that sometimes you love it, sometimes you hate it/But what good’s love if it ain’t a little complicated? After all, sometimes complicated’s pretty damn good. The next treat was a sing-along to Kip’s first radio single, Mary Was the Marrying Kind. Mary, Mary, couldn’t see it at the time/Mary, Mary, how could I have been so blind? I’ll bet it’s a trip all these years later to hear people shouting for “Mary Mary!” from the audience. The set finished up with a sublime moment during one of my all-time favorite grooves—Heart’s Desire. That beat is so sexy and the lyrics are hypnotic. For me the best part was during the outro when Kip took a sip of Evan Williams, came and sat on the riser in front of me, closed his eyes and disappeared into his own world, swaying back and forth with a Mona Lisa smile on his face as the band played on. Pure sweetness. Intimate. Perfect.\n\nAnother climb through the rollercoaster loop started with That Was Us. My favorite part of the song is singing the countermelody that backs up the third chorus. I like it so much that when I’m in my car I’ll usually sing it behind the second chorus too. Reminds me of a lot of good times in my own car as a teenager, because that was then, and that was us. After that mellow Motown groove, Kip jumped right into the very danceable What Ya Got On Tonight and got the whole audience hopping. Hey, what can I say? Every song doesn’t gotta be deep! I’m still laughing over the knee-high hot pink argyle socks. Of all the images that stick in my head, that one takes the cake!\n\nWhen that nasty slide guitar ground into the moan of Somethin’ ‘Bout A Truck, the crowd EXPLODED. Every person on every level, in every corner singing along to every word as Kip danced and grinned his way from one end of the stage to the other. In that moment we were all hanging out in our Fords and Chevys in that field, or down by that creek, having a beer and letting nature take its course, because, as you all know…ain’t nothin’ ‘bout it luck/There’s somethin’ ‘bout a truck! If it seemed like a laugh to hear the Celtic lilt of Magic pipe up after Truck, that was lost in the enthusiastic singalong. Your hand does something to my skin/Makes me want you more and believe again/Oh, gimme some of that magic, magic…\n\nThe real magic for me was in the sweetest moment after that song ended. Kip sat down and said, “To everybody’s who’s down and out—in life, in your job…this is yours.” Comeback Kid. Baby, all life’s bullets I took to the chest should have buried me alive/Should have left me dead/But when I reach for that white flag you won’t let me quit/And you call me the Comeback Kid. We all sang along. All of us. Like a hymn. Like church. Like a prayer. Communion. I’m glad that you never did lose faith in this Comeback Kid. Thank you, Kip.\n\nBefore leaving the stage, Kip gave us a thank you in the form of Lipstick. I love this wide open, achy road song with its atlas of favorite places to play. I’ve rolled a lot of miles just to see your smile… I guess that’s true for me too. It’s exactly what I did that day and will do again. And of course we couldn’t let our guitar man leave without a final goodbye so after some stomping and chanting, we received our final gift of the night—a real Kip and crowd favorite—and we all went Crazy One More Time.\n\nIf it had all ended right then, in that moment, it would have been a perfect night. A memory for the books. Instead, there was one more postscript—Kip announced that he’d be signing autographs in the bar for anyone who wanted them. That’s just who he is. He knows and loves his fan base. His growing, loyal-to-a-fault fan base. I’d brought my I’m To Blame tank top with me so I joined the line with one thought foremost on my mind—I hadn’t thanked him yet. How much does it matter to know that what you’re doing is making a real difference to people? Kip’s music changed the course of my life and brought me back to writing. Inspired by his story, I revived my life in so many ways that the desire to thank him was more like a need. The line was long and that gave me time—and courage. When my turn came, time stopped once more. I took a deep breath and told him that I’d only just discovered him in May but I’m one of his biggest fans and that his music and his story changed my life.\n\nKip hugged me.\n\nNOW it was perfect.\n\nYeah, I’m a Wild One for life.\n\nExquisite.\n\nI know, I know; there are a lot of adjectives available to describe a song—especially a country song. Probably some of those adjectives would be more humble, or folksy, or down-home than the one I came up with. You know—more country.\n\nI woke to the rise of the sun going down\n\nStale taste of whiskey fresh on my mouth\n\nHot cup of coffee, smoke in my hand\n\nAnother day in the life of the guitar man…la da da\n\n*\n\nLast night was a good night, as I reach in my jeans\n\nFound some crumpled-up ones, a few tens in between\n\nAnd a redhead named Annie, she’s still fast asleep\n\nMade me make her a promise she knows I can’t keep…la da da\n\nI’m not at a loss for words here. I’ve got words like a beach has sand. My body is eighty-five percent words. That said, the first and best word that came to mind when I heard Guitar Man by Kip Moore—when he performed it for the first time for the lucky few of us at the VIP in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on the opening night of the Wild Ones Tour—was exquisite.\n\nTime to fire up that two-tone old bucket of rust\n\nThrow my amp and my case in the back of my truck\n\nI breathe in my freedom with the windows rolled down\n\nForty-six miles till the next nameless town…la da da\n\n*\n\nThe place is still empty when I walk in the door\n\nThe stench from the beer spilling up through the floor\n\nI give a nod to sweet Lisa, she mixes the drinks\n\nLife’s been hard on her but she’s been good to me…la da da\n\nOne of the things I love the most about great storytelling is that it engages all my senses and pulls me into the story. I’m there. My emotions kick into high gear. I FEEL something. I want MORE. That’s how you connect!\n\nOff in the shadows stands a stool and a stage\n\nWhere many souls before me were put on display\n\nI take one last breath; time to pay some old dues\n\nThat won’t add up to nothin’ but some tips and cheap booze\n\n*\n\nYeah, the fruits of my labor’s when the crowd sings along\n\nNothing short of a savior; I go home alone\n\nI’m an empty, faceless, spotlight mic stand\n\nI’ll get ya high, I’ll get ya low, I’m a guitar man\n\nBOOM. Well done, Kip, sir.\n\nThey’ll ask for more love songs and I’ll play with a smile\n\nTo help them hold on or forget for a while\n\nThey can fill up that jukebox with a week’s worth of pay\n\nBut it can’t feel their happy and it can’t feel their pain…la da da\n\n*\n\nNo drums, no pianos, no sweet harmonies\n\nIt’s all in a song and it’s all on me\n\nYou won’t find nothin’ fancy, I’m a tired one-man band\n\nI’m a pickin’ and a grinnin’ guitar man\n\nSometimes when I tell people I wrote a novel, I get an expression of awe in response. You know—“Oh, wow, I could never do that! Too hard! So many words!” I’d like to give credit where credit is due here. Writing a novel isn’t easy, but I’ve got a hundred thousand words or so to get it all across to you—the plot, the players, the pictures in your mind’s eye. I get to pluck your heartstrings for three hundred-plus pages. Imagine doing the same thing in less than five hundred perfectly crafted words and setting it to music that squeezes your heart. Now you can see the scope of Kip Moore’s songwriting talent—and my choice of adjectives.\n\nYeah, the fruits of my labor’s when the crowd sings along\n\nNothing short of a savior till I go home alone\n\nI’m an empty, faceless, spotlight mic stand\n\nI’ll get ya high, I’ll get ya low, I’m a guitar man\n\nGuitar Man paints a picture much more intricate than its five hundred words. Like a good novelist, Kip develops his character so well that you KNOW him. You know him well enough to read between the lines and see, hear and feel the details the songwriter didn’t include. Can you feel his aching head along with the the taste of the whiskey when he rolls out of his rumpled bed, his hair standing up in an oily mohawk? Can’t you just see the flakes of rust that fall off his truck door when he has to pull twice to yank it open—and smell the exhaust, hear the squeak of old shocks and the grinding of gears? How about his shoes sticking to the floor of the bar? Or the flickering neon in cloudy windows, the dark corners, the ancient miasma of old smoke and every nick and scratch on the wobbly tables? And finally, the crowning glory—can you feel the communion? Can you feel what it means to him on his lonely road, to connect for a few hours with the people who love him for what his music can do? Do you love the guitar man too?\n\nI had me a pretty baby, thought she was the one\n\nBut she soon grew tired of this love on the run\n\nShe said she felt second, told me I had to choose\n\nShe’s back in Georgia and I’m here with you\n\n*\n\nAt the end of the night we’ll all be best friends\n\nThen strangers till I roll through town again\n\nI’ll yell out, “Hey Lisa, something cold in a can!”\n\nOne for the road for the guitar man\n\nI’m there. I’m right there in that bar—in so many bars and venues I’ve sat in since I discovered guitar and music and songwriting, watching all the guitar men in my life reach out for that savior of connection and love. I’ve reached out for it myself at open mics, facing down strangers and stage fright with my only weapon, an original song—and I remember the first moment when I saw someone singing along. There’s a word for that feeling. I already said it.\n\nYeah, the fruits of my labor’s when the crowd sings along\n\nNothing short of a savior, still I go home alone\n\nI’m an empty, faceless, spotlight mic stand\n\nI’ll get ya high, I’ll get ya low, I’m a guitar man\n\nI’ll play ’em fast, play ’em slow, I’m a guitar man\n\nGuitar Man is a masterpiece, not just of songcraft but of writing craft in any form. It’s pure Kip Moore, channeling the spirits of Dylan and Billy Joel and every weary, hopeful soul hungry for the salvation of music. I’ve listened to it a hundred times already and in it I hear the progression of one singer/songwriter’s passion and maturity to a level that can only touch hearts in a way that every guitar man prays for.\n\nAs I said—EXQUISITE\n\n*****\n\nIn a time in music where everything’s changing, lines are being crossed everywhere, genre’s been dumped on its ass, and the album is dying in favor of the downloaded single, Kip Moore stands out as someone who can deliver what we die-hard music lovers are still looking for—the real thing. The total package. An album with a story. Songs that stand alone but stand stronger together. Note for note, word for word, this is one of the best albums I’ve ever had the pleasure of listening to over and over and over, and let me tell you something: I’m a writer. Words matter. Lyrics matter. Stories matter.\n\nWild Ones isn’t just an album; it’s an experience. A delicious emotional rollercoaster ride through a fascinating mind.\n\nThis ain’t your mama’s country music. This is…roots rock combined with country combined with a haunted soulfulness that goes miles beyond what’s playing on the radio today. Seeger meets Springsteen meets South Georgia back road gravel. Like no one else. Kip’s his own artist with his own sound and it doesn’t just cross genres—it defies them. Kicks them down and rolls right through. In a truck.\n\nThere are going to be plenty of reviews out there that deal directly in breakdowns of the songs. Instrumentation. Genre. Somebody’s opinion on radio-readiness. That’s not my style. When I listen to music, it’s about whether it makes me feel something. If I need to take a long walk after listening, or curl up under a blanket to stop the shaking; if my shirt is wet from wiping tears; if I pound the steering wheel so hard the car swerves, or wake the neighbors; if I punch the air with my fist and laugh out loud—well, then, that’s the music I NEED in my life! And Wild Ones has all of that.\n\nSo here it is—the album that grabbed me right in the feels and just keeps holding on (and a few of the videos to go with it). Welcome to the musical feast!\n\nTrack 1: Wild Ones – “Everybody get a little lovin’, a little touchin’, a little kissin’ and a-huggin’…’cause we’re the Wild Ones!” When the drumbeat starts up, I can feel the power oozing out of the ground, creeping up into my legs, begging for a stomp; a dance—and not just any dance. Sensual Wild Ones is a Beltane feast of rhythm. Jump the fire, grab someone and start the party!\n\nTrack 2: Come and Get It – “Girl, what’s the matter with you, can’t you see it when it’s standing right in front of you? Come and get it!” Yes, please. Everything about this song is pure sexy, from the throbbing bass drum to the driving rhythm to the lyrics that literally beg you to open your eyes AND your heart to what’s right here, right now, in this moment!\n\nTrack 3: Girl of the Summer – “I see I was just another sunset fading in your eyes; I may never love another like my girl of the summer.” We all have one—the one that got away; the one that we loved more than he/she loved us back. I sure do, and the vulnerable, tough-guy longing in this song pulls me right back into those memories.\n\nTrack 4: Magic – “Now your hand does something to my skin, makes me want you more and believe again…” Kip doesn’t believe in fairy-tale romance; he has said this. Leave it to him to wind a song about the magic of touching and kissing around a lilting Celtic intro plus a steady heartbeat and have it weave a spell as potent as this song!\n\nTrack 5: That Was Us – “If we got high, we got stoned; if there was a fight, we got it on; if there was a backseat, we made love; that was then and that was us.” The final choruses of this song have a countermelody—a smooth Motown groove that I love to sing. And there’s something else about this song—a soulful nostalgia for a time when life was as simple as doing what feels right in the moment.\n\nTrack 6: Lipstick – “I’ve rolled a lot of miles just to feel your smile. Girl, I want to touch you while I kiss your lipstick.” Well, yeah…that sounds good to me! This is really a road song, though, and there’s something big and hollow about the music that echoes that empty, lonely space between gigs on the road when all you ache for is a familiar touch. Sigh.\n\nTrack 7: What Ya Got On Tonight – “I miss you baby; it’s driving me crazy. All I think about lately is…what ya got on tonight.” Fun! This song is just plain fun. The riff’s straight up Tom Petty and the lyrics make me laugh. Clever, goofy and paints a colorful picture of a guy on the road begging for a photo from home to give him something to smile about.\n\nTrack 8: Heart’s Desire – “I’m a raging fire; you’re my heart’s desire…” A masterpiece of emotional and lyrical craft. God, this song gets me going! Something about the stark, aching, lonely edge of loss that might have been avoided, combined with the rolling sexy groove, makes me want to break that lion out of his rusted-out circus cage and soothe his broken heart.\n\nTrack 9: Complicated – “All I know is sometimes you love it; sometimes you hate it, but what good’s love if it ain’t a little complicated?” Kip writes love songs that break out of the radio mold. He sings with raw emotion (and a little irony) about what goes right and wrong in real relationships—and the work it takes to keep a good one going. I can sure relate.\n\nTrack 10: I’m To Blame – “Take your pistol-pointing finger right off of the trigger; I know where to aim, hell, I’m to blame!” The kick-ass anthem to taking responsibility for your own mistakes that started me on this Kip Moore journey. This song makes me OWN MY LIFE. Just try it all, fuck it up, take the hit, suck it up and keep going forward. OH, YES!\n\nTrack 11: That’s Alright With Me – “They call me country, call me hippie, the wildcat from Dixie, and if you do or don’t like what you see, hell, that’s alright with me!” Oh HELL YEAH. This is one of my new theme songs. Seriously. It makes me want to punch my fist in the air, cuss (I love to swear) and go do everything I’ve always wanted to do, MY WAY.\n\nTrack 12: Running For You – “Even though you won’t be in my arms, you’ll be right where you belong so go girl, go girl, go on!” We’ve already established that this is my favorite song, since I dedicated an entire blog post to it. (Please check out that post for audio/video.) This is a delicious, inspiring, uplifting, bittersweet salute to unconditional love. This is how it’s done, gentlemen. Enough said.\n\nTrack 13: Comeback Kid – “Don’t ever do what you never did; don’t give up on this comeback kid.” Just one vision comes to mind—Kip Moore singing this. I feel like I get a secret glimpse into his songwriter’s heart with each replay, and the ache catches me by surprise every time. I’ve been there. I’m there now. I know what he’s saying. I’m a comeback kid too.\n\nTrack 14: What I Do – “I’m a midnight lover on the loose; I’m a wild card, baby, through and through; gimme a guitar and I’ll pick some songs for you, ‘cause that’s what I want and that’s who I am; that’s what I do!” First time I heard this song, I wanted to jump Kip in all his glorious authenticity and do unprintable things with him. Kinda still do. <grin>\n\nTrack 15: Backseat – “The two of us in the backseat…” This is a Kip Moore staple—as the story goes, fans pretty much riot in the aisles if he doesn’t play it at a show. The obvious sexual vibe of the song is fueled by the uncertainty in the lyrics, the tense, choppy chords and a masterful guitar crescendo at just the right moment. You never forget your first time!\n\nTrack 16: Burn the Whole World Down – “You said it’s hard to say I love you but it’s hard to say I don’t, and that ain’t enough to keep me hangin’ around…” When I heard this song, I did a fist pump! It’s a stompin’, upbeat, country F-you to anyone who just won’t support their lover’s dreams. And is Kip set to burn the whole world down??\n\nHell yeah, he is!"
