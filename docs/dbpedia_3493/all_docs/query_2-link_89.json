        "text": "Depending on how you look at it, a musician’s dreams are not complex. In fact, it’s quite simple – sell out massive theaters, double the size of the audience once in a while, and establish a solid bond with a multitude of fans who would shout your name andto singscream with you every time you get to play live. Kip Moore lived this dream and according to him, that’s it!\n\nCounting on his huge fanbase and support, Moore believes he’s established a deep-rooted music career that won’t fall apart any time soon. He once expressed that he was proud of the trust he had established and nurtured between himself and his audience. Claiming he has a genuine fanbase, the musician explained that he believes they will stick with him as he reveals it has given him a sense of peace.\n\nThe American singer-songwriter took the music industry by storm in April 2012 when his debut album Up All Night, expanded Mary’s hits Was The Kind Of Wedding and Something Like A Truck, The two singles he originally released. While Mary was the Marrying Kind to reach No. 45 on Billboard’s country singles charts, the latter rose to No. 1 a few weeks after Kip debuted on the album.\n\nIt was a perfect start for Kip, beyond the fact that he emerged and was celebrated as the male artist with the best-selling album in 2012 and the following year he was nominated for several awards. Although he was nominated for the Country Music Association Awards in the New Artist of the Year category in 2014, he was also nominated for the CMT Music Awards the previous year. The nomination went to Breakthrough Video of The Year and was for Beer Money, the second single from her debut album.\n\nThat’s not all, in 2012 the country music artist received three nominations for the American Country Awards. He was nominated to be honored as New Artist of the Year and also recommended receiving the Designated Honors for Music Video and Single by New Artist. It was both for Somethin’ ‘Bout A Truck, the lead single from his 2012 album.\n\nAge – How old is Kip Moore?\n\nIt was on April 1 and in 1980 that the musician was born and his name is Kip Christian Moore. His birthplace was in Tifton, Georgia. Although nothing very significant is known about the woman who gave birth to Kip, Bonnie Mann Moore; it is known that his father, Stanley (Stan) Thomas Moore was a professional golfer and, that Kip initially wanted to be like his father.\n\nEven, he bagged a golf scholarship to pursue his education at a public university in Georgia – Valdosta State. Nevertheless, his passion for music held him captive. He soon began touring with a band and eventually moved to Nashville, Tennessee in order to intensify the pursuit of his musical career; that was in 2004. As fate would have it, Kip met Brett James and the producer facilitated him a record deal with MCA Nashville.\n\nIs Kip Moore married, who is his wife?\n\nKip has been skeptical about romantic affairs and marriage regardless of the fact that a good number of women would love to have him as a life partner. In fact, it’s previously been rumored that a mother of two has filed for divorce from her husband of eight years, insisting she’s in love with Kip and would love to be his wife.\n\nAnyway, Kip, to the best of our knowledge is not a husband to anyone and, it’s hard to say if the artist is romantically attached to anyone at this time. Nonetheless, the star has repeatedly revealed he’s been in a relationship, just as he’s hinted he should keep a romantic affair going if he has to.\n\nDoes he have a girlfriend?\n\nNo one knows if Kip Moore is anyone’s love of life. Despite the fact that the musician is widely believed to be still single, it’s possible he’s found a mate and just isn’t ready to make it a public affair.\n\nA few years ago, Kip shared that he had been avoiding getting a girlfriend because he needed to give his full attention to music. But then he clarified that he was looking forward to being in a relationship."
