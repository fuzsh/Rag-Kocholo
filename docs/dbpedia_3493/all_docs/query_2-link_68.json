        "text": "Multi-Platinum singer/songwriter Kip Moore has released the official music video for his fan-favorite track and current single “Crazy One More Time (Revisited).” The clip gives fans a look behind the curtain at Moore’s creative process in the studio, and spotlights a powerful performance from the “uncompromising, genre-defying artist firing on all cylinders.” (Noisey).\n\nMaking good on a long-time back and forth with his loyal fanbase, Moore hit the studio to put a 2022 update on the track originally featured on his widely celebrated debut album UP ALL NIGHT. The song has gone on to grow a life of its own over the past ten years, becoming one of the most requested songs during Moore’s signature live show. “Crazy One More Time” was co-written by Moore with Chris Lindsey and Aimee Mayo.\n\nRecently making his long-anticipated return to C2C: Country to Country Festival, Moore’s set was praised as “nothing short of masterful” (Your Life In A Song), as he proved again, “Kip was born to be on the stage.” (Building Our Own Nashville). Next up, he will crisscross the US on the road this spring and summer for headlining shows and high-profile festival appearances.
