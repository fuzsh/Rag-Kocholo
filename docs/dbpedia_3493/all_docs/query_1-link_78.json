Co-written by Moore, his current Top 10 single and the lead track “More Girls Like You,” is the fastest rising single of his career so far and is receiving praise from critics such as Entertainment Weekly declaring he “has made a name for himself weaving vignettes of Southern, blue-collar life and love into rollicking country anthems.” The release of “More Girls Like You” follows the acclaim that surrounded his sophomore album WILD ONES heralded as “an impressively singular release from Music Row” by The Guardian. Moore first turned heads with his debut album UP ALL NIGHT which was certified GOLD by the RIAA and spawned three No. One hit singles including GOLD certified “Beer Money,” PLATINUM certified “Hey Pretty Girl,” and the DOUBLE PLATINUM breakout hit “Somethin’ ‘Bout A Truck.” Moore’s “Comeback Kid Skatepark Project” raising funds for “Kip’s Kids Fund” was born as a passion project, with the goal of finding an outlet to showcase Moore’s love for the alternative sports lifestyle, and his desire to help inner city children. Phase one cities of the project included building and developing skateparks in Nashville, TN; Boston, MA; San Marcos, TX; Cincinnati, OH and Annapolis, MD. The “Comeback Kid Skatepark Project” is the first initiative of “Kip’s Kids Fund,” a donor-advised fund through The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee (CFMT) focused on youth and teens. As a result, the “Kip’s Kid Fund” provides alternative outlets for youth to engage in healthy habits and physical activities like skateboarding, in addition to the traditional sports offerings where they live.
