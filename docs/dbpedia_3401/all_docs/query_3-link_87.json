        "text": "Welcome to the Court lab at MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nOur main focus is the Radiation Planning Assistant (RPA), an automated contouring and treatment planning tool that we aim to offer as a very low-cost cloud-based service to radiotherapy clinics in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This work makes extensive use of deep learning and other artificial intelligence tools, with a strong emphasis on clinical validation.\n\nOur lab is funded by grants and contracts from the NCI, Wellcome Trust, industry (Varian Medical Systems), CPRIT and MD Anderson. Our group has 40+ members which is composed of faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, computational scientists, dosimetrists, research engineers and research assistants.\n\nWe are also involved in radiomics research, using imaging to prove the tumor phenotype. The goal of this work is to develop imaging signatures that can support clinical decision making.\n\nPlease view our other pages to learn more about the work we do."
