        "text": "Civil & General Forms\n\nThe library is unable to determine what form you should use and we cannot assist you in filling out any form.\n\nLearn about legal forms\n\nAbout legal forms\n\nThis research guide links you to resources where you may find commonly used legal forms for free. These are usually created by legal aid organizations, nonprofit groups, or may be offered by county or district clerks' offices. You will not always find a downloadable, fill-in-the-blank form for your situation. If you cannot find a form online, you may need to look at legal practice guides either at a law library in person or via our Digital Collection. If you still cannot find a form, one may not exist and you or your attorney may need to create a custom form.\n\nHow do I use these forms?\n\nThe library cannot advise you on how to use a form or whether a form is appropriate for your situation. An attorney or a legal aid organization could advise you on how to use a form, what to include, or help you determine which form is appropriate.\n\nWhy can't I find the legal form I'm looking for?\n\nThe state publishes very few legal forms for use in legal proceedings. Because each lawsuit is different, it is difficult to create standard fill-in-the-blank forms. Instead, many private publishers create drafting guides or templates that are commonly referred to as \"legal forms.\" Depending on the specifics of your situation, a drafting guide may need to be customized for your specific set of facts.\n\nHow can the library help me?\n\nThe library can help you determine if a form by a specific name is located online or in a library resource. We may also point you to library resources or other websites that discuss a specific legal topic and may contain drafting guides or templates. We cannot help you determine what form you need or assist you in filling out a form. We cannot tell you if a form is appropriate for your situation.\n\nMany of the e-books available through the State Law Library contain forms or drafting guides. To access, first get a free library account online with the Texas State Law Library."
