        "text": "The Criminal Division is made up of four seasoned and experienced trial attorneys supervised by Division Chief Assistant Prosecutor Scott Salisbury.\n\nThe primary focus of the criminal division is to bring those who break the law to justice in order to protect the public. The division handles the most serious criminal cases in the County. Murder, sexual assaults, and drug cases are among some of the most common types of cases handled by this division.\n\nThis division works closely with all Federal, State, and Local law enforcement agencies in order to successfully prosecute the cases their investigations identify.\n\nThe Juvenile Division is made up of two experienced attorneys supervised by Chief Assistant Prosecutor, Scott Salisbury.\n\nThe Juvenile Division is charged with the difficult, dual responsibilities of prosecuting juvenile offenders in a wide variety of cases ranging from minor traffic infractions, to conduct which would lead to the most serious felony charges if committed by an adult. ​\n\nBecause both punishment and rehabilitation of the offender are given equal focus under the law, these cases provide unique and often difficult decisions not seen in any other court room.\n\nThe Civil Division is made up of four seasoned and experienced attorneys supervised by Division Chief Assistant Prosecutor, Michael Lyons.\n\nThis division of the Prosecutor's office is charged with the responsibilities of providing legal advice and representation to every office and agency in the county from the County Commissioners to every one of the 17 townships in the County to each of the Counties Elected Officials.\n\nThe Civil Division handles the most diverse number of legal issues whether drafting multi-million dollar contracts or addressing an issue raised by a Township Trustee. The attorneys and staff of the civil division provide timely and accurate legal advice.\n\nThe Child Support Division is made up of two experienced attorneys supervised by Assistant Prosecutor, Lisa Williams.\n\nThis division is charged with the duties to advise and represent the Office of Job and Family Services, in collection efforts in both Domestic Relations court and Juvenile Court.\n\nThese same attorneys indict and prosecute cases of Felony Non-Support in the Court of Common Pleas when the circumstances require it.\n\nStarting in January of 2017 the Medina County Prosecutor's Office has made aggressive prosecution of felony non-support cases a top priority, tripling the number of indictments from the previous year. The goal of every attorney in the Child Support Division is to increase collection of child support owed and hold non-payers responsible for their failure to pay.\n\nSuzanne DeSantis\n\n​Head of Victim/Witness Division"
