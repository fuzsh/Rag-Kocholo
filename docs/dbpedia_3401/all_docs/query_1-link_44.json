        "text": "In the federal system, the Supreme Court of the United States promulgates court rules for itself and the lower federal courts under the authority of 28 U.S.C. § 2072. As a matter of practice, rules are drafted by committees of the Judicial Conference of the United States, approved by the Judicial Conference and then submitted to the Supreme Court for adoption. Rules must be submitted to Congress by May 1 in order to become effective on December 1; however, Congress need not take action for the rules to become effective. Courts of appeals and the federal district courts have been empowered by 28 U.S.C. § 2071 to make their own separate rules, which must be consistent with the general rules developed for them by the Supreme Court.\n\nA. Locating Federal Rules: General Sources\n\nThere are several general sources that contain the text of most of the federal rules described below. The unannotated texts (referred to as the “general sources” in the remainder of this guide) are:\n\nCyclopedia of Federal Procedure (online in Westlaw)\n\nFederal Procedure Rules Service (Practice & Procedure KF8835 .F431)\n\nWest's Federal Civil Judicial Procedure and Rules (Reserves KF8816 .A19)\n\nWest's Federal Criminal Code and Rules (Reserves KF9606 .U57)\n\nThe above are listings for the most current year of these annual handbook titles. Prior editions can be found in the library stacks (Level 2) at the same call numbers.\n\nThe text and annotations for most of the rules are available online through the legal research services Lexis Advance, Westlaw, and Bloomberg Law. On Lexis Advance, the rules of all types of federal courts can be found by following the path Statutes & Legislation > Court Rules. On Westlaw, browse the Statutes & Court Rules database, which is linked on the research homepage. On Bloomberg Law, follow the navigation path Browse All Content > Litigation & Dockets > Court Rules.\n\nOther online sources for federal rules include the Federal Judiciary, and Cornell's Legal Information Institute.\n\n1. Rules of General Application (F.R.C.P., F.R. App. P., F.R. Crim. P., F.R.E.)\n\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (F.R.C.P.), the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (F.R. App. P.), and the Federal Rules of Evidence (F.R.E.) are published in the official U.S. Code (Federal Area & online), in the appendix to Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (F.R. Crim. P.) are published in the U.S. Code's appendix to Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure.\n\nAnnotated versions of these rules are available in both unofficial versions of the Code, United States Code Annotated (Federal Area & online in Westlaw) and United States Code Service (Federal Area & online in Lexis Advance). In the print U.S.C.A., rules appear in the appendix following the title; in the print U.S.C.S., rules are housed in separate volumes near the end of the set.\n\nIn addition to the general sources listed above, these rules are all reprinted in Moore's Federal Rules Pamphlet (Practice & Procedure KF8816 .M66 & online in Lexis Advance) and U.S. Supreme Court Digest, L.Ed., vols. 17-22 (Federal Reporters & Digests). These sources contain historical notes, Advisory Committee comments and annotations to the federal civil and criminal rules.\n\n2. Rules for the U.S. Supreme Court\n\nThe rules of the U.S. Supreme Court can be found in many places, including the general sources noted above in Section A. The rules are published in Title 28, Appendix of the official U.S. Code. The annotated rules are in Title 28 of U.S.C.A., in a separate \"Court Rules\" volume at the end of U.S.C.S., and in volume 17 of U.S. Supreme Court Digest, L.Ed. Current rules are also available at the Court's website.\n\n3. Local Court Rules for Federal Courts\n\nIndividual lower federal courts issue their own rules governing local practice. These rules generally concern the operation of the court and often supplement the rules of general application. Some courts of appeal also have internal operating procedures that supplement their local court rules.\n\nCourt rule handbooks published for individual states will include the local rules of the federal district courts in that state, as well as the circuit court of appeals for that jurisdiction. Annual handbooks are published for selected states. These are located with the state codes (Level 3). For example, North Carolina Rules of Court (State Codes & NC Alcove), published by West, is divided into two volumes -- one for rules of the North Carolina state courts and one for the local rules of the federal district courts in North Carolina and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. North Carolina General Statutes, Annotated Rules (State Codes & NC Alcove) published by Lexis, contains annotated state court rules and unannotated federal rules for these same courts.\n\nCourt rules are also frequently published on the websites of the individual court or court systems. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts maintains a federal court locator site with links to the websites of individual courts.\n\n4. Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction and Special Proceedings\n\nCongress has established several federal courts with limited jurisdiction in specific subject areas, such as the Tax Court, the Court of Federal Claims, and the Court of International Trade. Their rules of court are published in the U.S.C., U.S.C.A., and U.S.C.S. The court rules volumes of U.S.C.S. (in print or online in Lexis Advance) are probably the most convenient source.\n\nRules for courts of limited jurisdictions are also frequently published on the website of the individual court. Use the Court Locator to locate the site for a particular court.\n\nRules of procedure for the trial of misdemeanors before U.S. magistrates, supplemental rules for admiralty and maritime claims, rules governing multi-district litigation, and rules governing habeas corpus proceedings are included in the West federal handbooks and other general sources listed above.\n\n5. Rules of Practice for Quasi-Judicial Agencies\n\nRules of practice before federal agencies are published in the Federal Register (available online; previous years on microfiche & in HeinOnline). Eventually the Federal Register is compiled into the Code of Federal Regulations (Federal Area; prior years in Documents AE 2.106/3, on microfiche & in HeinOnline).\n\nU.S.C.S. Administrative Rules of Procedure, a five-volume unit of U.S.C.S. (Federal Area & online in Lexis Advance), contains rules for the conduct of proceedings before the major federal agencies.\n\nCommercially published looseleaf or electronic services (see Bluebook Table 15 for a representative list) are another source for agency rules and regulations. Both substantive regulations and rules of practice and procedure are usually included.\n\nAgency websites frequently contain relevant rules. To locate an agency website, visit the USA.gov A-Z Index of U.S. Government Departments and Agencies.\n\nB. Researching Federal Rules\n\n1. Proposed Amendments\n\nThe text of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court with Judicial Conference Advisory Committee notes can be found in the advance sheets to the West Supreme Court Reporter, Federal Reporter, Federal Supplement and Federal Rules Decisions (Federal Reporters, Level 3), and also in U.S. Law Week (Periodicals & in Bloomberg Law & Bloomberg BNA). The monthly pamphlets for United States Code Congressional & Administrative News (Federal Area & online in Westlaw) also include amendments for specialized federal courts and administrative tribunals.\n\n2. Locating Decisions Construing Court Rules\n\nThe text of court decisions construing rules of procedure are usually printed in the same reports that cover court decisions generally, and can be found using traditional case-finding research methods online and in print. Two additional sources for decisions construing federal court rules are:\n\nFederal Rules Decisions (F.R.D.) (Level 3 & online in Westlaw). This unit of West's National Reporter System contains decisions of the federal district courts since 1940 construing rules of civil procedure, and decisions since 1946 construing rules of criminal procedure. Decisions printed are only those not already printed in the Federal Reporter or the Federal Supplement. Articles about the courts and federal procedure are also included.\n\nFederal Rules Service (KF8816 .A198, updated through February 2015). This looseleaf service focuses entirely on decisions construing rules of civil procedure. It includes three useful sections: (1) Federal Rules Service volumes contain the text of all federal court decisions construing federal rules of civil procedure. Indexing is from the beginning of the service in 1939. Since 1968, cases construing rules of appellate procedure are also included; (2) Federal Rules Digest contains digests of the decisions in an arrangement based on the official rule numbers, and editorial comments; (3) the Finding Aids volume includes the text of the rules, a subject index, and a table of cases.\n\nCitations to decisions can also be found: (1) in annotated rules compilations such as U.S.C.A. and U.S.C.S.; (2) as references in secondary sources such as Wright and Miller's Federal Practice and Procedure described below; and (3) by updating citations using a citator service such as Shepard's or KeyCite.\n\n3. Updating Court Rules\n\nCourt rule citations are treated as statutes in the legal research citator services, allowing researchers to locate citing decisions as well as information about amendments and repeals to individual rules. Current members of the Duke Law community may update court rules online in Lexis Advance (Shepardize This Document for citing decisions and history), Westlaw (KeyCite tabs for History and Citing References), and Bloomberg Law (SmartCode tab for citing decisions).\n\nUpdating court rules is more challenging outside the premium legal research services. LexisNexis Academic, the campus-wide version of Lexis Advance, contains Shepard’s for case law, but does not allow users to update federal or state court rule citations. However, the Law Library owns updated print copies of the state Shepard’s North Carolina Citations (NC Alcove, Level 3), which include citing references for both federal and state court rules.\n\n4. Finding Discussion of the Federal Rules\n\nSeveral multi-volume sets discuss the practice and procedure of federal courts. They usually contain the text of the rules followed by analysis and citations to court decisions. Often they are cross-referenced to companion sets of form books.\n\nTwo well-respected treatises are: Wright and Miller's Federal Practice and Procedure (Practice & Procedure KF 9619.W7 & online in Westlaw) and Moore's Federal Practice (Practice & Procedure KF8840 .M663 & online in Lexis Advance). These multi-volume sets include textual commentary on the rules and on practice under the rules, numerous case and law review citations, forms, as well as detailed indexing and other finding aids. Both sets are arranged basically in rule number order. Even though these commentaries are secondary sources, they are widely cited in cases, in addition to serving as research tools.\n\nOther useful sets for commentary on federal practice are: Federal Procedure Lawyers Edition (Practice & Procedure KF8835 .F43 1981 & online in Westlaw) and its companion set Federal Procedural Forms, Lawyers Edition (Practice & Procedure KF8836 .F4); and Cyclopedia of Federal Procedure (online in Westlaw) and its companion set Nichol's Cyclopedia of Federal Procedure Forms (KF8716.4 .C951 & online in Westlaw).\n\nFor a guide to the jurisdictional and procedural operations of the Supreme Court use the one-volume treatise by Gressman, Supreme Court Practice, 10th ed. (KF9057 .S8 2013 & online in Bloomberg Law). It includes checklists, sample forms, and pertinent rules and statutes. West's Federal Forms, Supreme Court vols. (Practice & Procedure KF8836 .W4 & online in Westlaw) is another useful source.\n\nFor discussion of the Federal Rules of Evidence, try the general federal practice sources above. Weinstein's Federal Evidence: Commentary on Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts (no longer updated in print in the library but current online in Lexis Advance) is an electronic service including commentary on each rule. There is also a version of Weinstein's Evidence for student use that can be found online as Weinstein's Evidence Manual in Lexis Advance. Other major treatises on the law of evidence are The New Wigmore: A Treatise on Evidence (library call number varies by subtopic) and McCormick on Evidence, 7th ed.(Reserves KF8935 .M131 2013). Although it is no longer updated in the library's print collection, the Federal Rules of Evidence Service (KF8933 .F42) reporter volumes contain decisions of federal courts and agencies interpreting the rules, up to volume 95 (2015)."
