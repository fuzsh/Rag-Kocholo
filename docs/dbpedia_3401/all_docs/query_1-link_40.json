        "text": "Glossary of terms\n\nAcquittal\n\nThis is a judgment that a defendant is not guilty of a crime or charges as charged.\n\nAddress for filing\n\nThe address of the registry where documents can be taken or sent.\n\nAddress for service\n\nAn address of a place in New Zealand where all documents for the prosecution or the defence can be taken or sent.\n\nAdjourn\n\nTo postpone a court sitting, or any meeting, to another date and/or location.\n\nAdmissible\n\nEvidence is admissible if it is of such a character that the court is bound to accept it during the trial so that it may be evaluated by the judge or jury.\n\nAffirm\n\nA solemn and formal declaration of the truth of a statement, such as an Affidavit.\n\nAffirmation\n\nA solemn and formal declaration of the truth of a statement. The same as an oath, but without the religious implications.\n\nBail\n\nIf you are charged with an offence, you may apply for bail. Bail is when you are released from court or Police custody most likely on conditions, including that you return to court for their next required appearance. For more information see the Bail Act 2000(external link) and the Community Law website(external link).\n\nBurden of proof\n\nRefers to the responsibility of proving a disputed charge or allegation.\n\nIn criminal cases, the prosecution has this responsibility and the standard of proof that applies is beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that it is the prosecutor’s role to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (you) is guilty of committing the alleged offence(s); the defendant does not have to prove their innocence.\n\nCall-over\n\nA call-over is a meeting where the judge and the lawyers for both sides discuss any pre-trial issues. If you are an unrepresented litigant, you must attend.\n\nCase Review Hearing\n\nA case review hearing is held to examine whether a charge can be resolved without the need for a trial. For example, if the prosecution withdraws the charges against you, or if you plead guilty to the charges, there would be no trial.\n\nIf a trial is to occur, the case review hearing is also an opportunity for either party to highlight any matters that need to be resolved before the trial takes place.\n\nCharge\n\nIs a formal accusation brought to the court that a person or organisation has committed a criminal offence.\n\nContempt of court\n\nIs the offence of being disobedient to, or disrespectful towards, a court of law and its officers.\n\nCRI\n\nIs a system generated unique reference number assigned to a proceeding that can contain numerous CRNs belonging to any number of defendants.\n\nA CRI is distinct from a CRN because a CRN is a unique number assigned to a specific and singular charge, not a proceeding.\n\nCriminal proceeding\n\nAction taken in a court to bring a criminal prosecution against someone.\n\nCriminal Trial\n\nA proceeding in which opposing parties present evidence and make arguments on the application of the law before a judge or jury. After both sides have presented their arguments, a judge or jury finds the defendant guilty or not guilty of the crime(s) charged.\n\nCRN\n\nA Court Record Number (CRN) is a unique number assigned to a specific and singular charge laid by the prosecutor.\n\nA CRN is distinct from a CRI because a CRI is a system generated unique reference number assigned to a proceeding, not a specific and singular charge. A CRI can contain numerous CRNs belonging to any number of defendants.\n\nCross-examination\n\nFollowing an examination-in-chief, this is when the lawyer for the opposing side has an opportunity to ask the witness questions to challenge the other side’s case.\n\nDefendant\n\nSomeone charged with a criminal offence.\n\nTo deliberate\n\nTo consider the facts, law and other matters, particularly by members of a jury.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclosure(external link) is a copy of the evidence(external link) that the Crown(external link) and police have collected to prosecute(external link) your case. For more information see the Criminal Disclosure Act 2008(external link).\n\nEvidence\n\nThe various things presented in court to prove alleged facts, including written or spoken testimony from witnesses, and other material such as documents, maps etc.\n\nEvidence-in-chief\n\nThis is when you testify as witness for the defence.\n\nExamination-in-chief\n\nThis is when the lawyer for one side calls their witnesses and asks them questions in court to support their case.\n\nExpert witness\n\nA person who is a specialist in a subject who may present his or her expert opinion, without having witnessed the actual criminal event.\n\nFile\n\nTo file a document with a registry of the High Court.\n\nFirst appeal\n\nThe first time you appeal a decision of a court.\n\nFirst appeal court\n\nThe level of court that decides the first appeal.\n\nFurther appeal\n\nWhen you appeal the decision made by the court that heard the first appeal. For example, if you appealed the decision of a Community Magistrate to the District Court (a first appeal), you may then be able to appeal that District Court decision to the High Court (further appeal). You must always seek leave to bring a further appeal.\n\nInadmissible evidence\n\nEvidence that is not admissible. In other words, evidence that cannot be received into evidence at a trial for consideration by the judge and/or jury. For example, irrelevant evidence. More information about admissibility of evidence can be found in the Evidence Act 2006(external link).\n\nJudgment\n\nA formal decision given by a court, including the reasons the judge gives for his or her decision.\n\nJudicial decision\n\nA decision made by a judicial officer, such as a Justice of the Peace, Community Magistrate or judge.\n\nLeave\n\nPermission obtained from the court to take some action which, without such permission, would not be allowed.\n\nLeave to appeal\n\nPermission obtained from the court you are appealing to before that court will consider your appeal.\n\nLegal aid\n\nLegal aid is government funding to pay for legal help for people who cannot afford a lawyer.

For example, suggesting questions to put to a witness.\n\nName suppression\n\nIn most cases, the media has the right to publish a person’s name if that person has been charged with an offence. In cases where publication of a person’s name might lead to undue hardship for that person or another person, the Court can grant either interim or permanent name suppression. More information is available in section 200(external link) the Act and on the Community Law website(external link).\n\nOath\n\nA declaration made according to the law to tell the truth. The oath is taken on the Bible.\n\nOffender\n\nA person convicted of a criminal offence.\n\nPlea\n\nA plea is a defendant’s response to the charge before the court – namely guilty or not guilty.\n\nPresumption of innocence\n\nThe presumption of innocence is a basic right under New Zealand’s criminal justice system. If you are charged with a crime, you have the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.\n\nProsecution\n\nThe party taking the case against the defendant. This can either be the police, Crown solicitor or private prosecutor. In the High Court the prosecutor will always be either a Crown solicitor or private prosecutor.\n\nRe-examination\n\nThis is when the lawyer who carried out the examination-in-chief gets a chance to question their own witnesses again to clarify points arising out of the cross-examination.\n\nRegistrar\n\nA court official who makes sure that the formal processes of the court are followed and that accurate records of hearings are kept, and who gives effect to any direction from the judge.\n\nRemanded\n\nAfter one court appearance you will be “remanded” to your next appearance. This means you will either be:\n\nremanded at large, which means you are free to go until your next appearance; or\n\nremanded on bail, which means you are released on bail. There are usually conditions that you must comply with (such as having to live at a particular place, having no contact with the victim, or having to report to police regularly); or\n\nremanded in custody, which means you are held in prison until your next court date.\n\nFollowing your court appearance, you will usually need to stay in court until the appropriate paperwork has been prepared for you to be remanded.\n\nReserved decision\n\nFollowing the hearing of a case the judge may reserve their decision. This is when the judge defers giving the decision to a later date or time.\n\nRestorative justice\n\nRefers to a voluntary meeting between a victim and offender, and their respective support people, before sentencing.\n\nThe aim of these meetings is to allow victims to have a say and focus on their needs, while offenders can take responsibility for their actions and for putting things right.\n\nA report of the meeting, and any recommendations arising out of it, go to the judge and are taken into account at sentencing.\n\nNot all courts offer access to restorative justice and it is not suitable for all offences.\n\nSentence indication\n\nA statement by the court that provides you with an idea of the type and quantum (amount) of sentence you would be likely to receive for a charge(s), if you pleaded guilty to that charge.\n\nServe\n\nTo give a copy of a document to every other person or organisation that is part of the proceeding and also to every other person that the court directs to be served.\n\nSubmission\n\nAn argument that is presented to the court in support of an application.
