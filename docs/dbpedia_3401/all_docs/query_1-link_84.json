The office shall be closed on all Georgia State holidays and when otherwise ordered; such orders will be posted on the Court’s website.

See Rule 2. The Court’s website is www.gasupreme.us.\n\nRule 2. FILING BY FACSIMILE. No filing, except requests for an extension of time, oral argument, extra time, or extra pages, will be accepted by facsimile without the prior permission of the Court. When such permission is granted, a filing received by facsimile will be filed as of the date of receipt of the facsimile, but only after the original has been received by mail. An original need not be provided for the 4 requests listed above. Service upon the opposing party must be shown on the facsimile. See Rule 14.\n\nThe Clerk’s office will not transmit documents by facsimile, except when ordered by the Court.\n\nRule 3. TERMS OF COURT. The Supreme Court has three terms each year as follows:\n\n(1) December term beginning the first Monday in December\n\n(2) April term beginning the first Monday in April; and\n\n(3) August term beginning the first Monday in August.\n\nRule 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR ATTORNEYS PRACTICING BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT.\n\nAn attorney must be in good standing and admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court in order to make an appearance. An attorney who is not admitted to practice in Georgia but who is admitted and authorized to practice law in the highest court in another state, the District of Columbia, or a territory of the United States may appear pro hac vice in a particular case with permission of the Court as provided in paragraph (h) below. A law student or a law school graduate authorized to practice under the Student Practice Rules or the Law School Graduate Rules may appear in a particular case with the permission of the Court as provided in Rule 96.\n\na. Application and Oath. Any active member of the State Bar of Georgia may be admitted to practice in this Court upon written application, and the certificate of at least two members of the Bar of this Court, attesting that the applicant is of good private and professional character.\n\nThe oath, which is required to be taken in open Court or before a Justice (see Rule 55 (2) regarding proper attire), and which shall be subscribed in a book to be kept by the Clerk and known as the “Roll Book,” is as follows:\n\n“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will conduct myself as an attorney or counselor of this Court, truly and honestly, justly and uprightly, and according to law; and that I will support the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the Constitution of the United States. So help me God.”\n\nb. Fee. The non-refundable fee for admission is $30, payable to the Clerk, Supreme Court of Georgia, who will issue a license under the seal of the Court.\n\nc. Admission In Absentia. The Court allows active members of the State Bar of Georgia who reside out of the state to be admitted in absentia. Two items are required: the Application for Admission and the Oath to be administered by an appellate judge or a judge of a court of record, with the admittee’s signed affirmation and the judge’s attestation. Mail the original forms to the Clerk. Upon receipt and verification of the original documents, the Clerk will mail the admittee a license evidencing admission to the Bar of this Court. The admittee must make an appointment with the Clerk’s office to sign the attorney Roll Book upon return to Georgia.\n\nd. Certificate of Good Standing. A certificate of good standing will be issued to members of the Supreme Court Bar upon written request if accompanied by payment of $10. Instructions for ordering a certificate of good standing are located on the Court’s website at https://www.gasupreme.us/court-information/purchase/.\n\ne. Withdrawal or Substitution of Counsel. Any withdrawal, discharge, or substitution of attorneys of record in the Court shall be communicated to the Court in writing via the e-file system and shall include the name and number of the case in this Court and the name and address of counsel’s client. Telephonic or other immediate notification to the Court, in addition to written notification, is required where the withdrawal, discharge, or substitution occurs prior to oral argument in cases where oral argument has been requested. Counsel shall provide a copy of the notification to the client, substituted counsel, and opposing counsel, including the Attorney General where required by law.\n\nf. Change of Contact Information. If during the pendency of any proceeding, counsel of record for any party change their business address, e-mail address, or telephone number, they shall update the information on the e-file system in “Update My Profile” and notify the Clerk by e-filed letter of this change and show service on opposing counsel. Upon receipt of the notification, the Clerk will confirm that the Court’s docket has been updated. Failure of counsel to receive notice of Court action shall not be grounds to reinstate or reconsider any matter adverse to counsel or their party if counsel failed to properly update the e-file system and to notify the Court of any change of business address, e-mail address, or telephone number.\n\ng. Pro Se Parties. The words “counsel” and “attorney” as used in these rules include pro se parties.\n\nh. Pro Hac Vice Appearance. An attorney desiring to appear pro hac vice in a single case shall file an Application for Admission Pro Hac Vice before making an appearance in the case.\n\n(1) The application, which shall be served on all parties, shall contain the following information:\n\n(a) a current certificate of good standing from the highest court of the out-of-state lawyer’s jurisdiction;\n\n(b) the applicant’s business address, e-mail address, and telephone number; and\n\n(c) the name of the party or parties sought to be represented.\n\n(2) The application may be made by the attorney requesting pro hac vice appearance or a member of the Bar of this Court on behalf of the attorney requesting pro hac vice appearance.\n\n(3) Each time an Application for Admission Pro Hac Vice is submitted under this rule, the applicant shall send a check for $200 payable to “IOLTA/Georgia Bar Foundation.” The check must be mailed directly to “The Georgia Bar Foundation, 104 Marietta Street, Suite 610, Atlanta, GA 30303.” The applicant must include a certification with their application stating, “I have submitted a check for $200 to the Georgia Bar Foundation.”\n\n(4) Persons seeking to represent an indigent party may qualify for a waiver of the fee, if at the time of filing the application, counsel files a statement that counsel is representing the client pro bono because of indigency.\n\n(5) The Court will provide electronic filing access to attorneys granted pro hac vice admission.\n\ni. Reserved.\n\nj. Absences. Unlike the Uniform Rules for other courts, this Court does not grant leaves of absence. Counsel should make arrangements to monitor the case while absent. If appropriate to the pending matter, counsel may request an extension of time.\n\nk. Appearances by Former Attorneys or Justices of the Court. An attorney who was an employee of this Court or a former Justice of this Court may not enter an appearance in any case during the six months after his or her service at the Court or in any case that was pending before the Court during his or her service.\n\nRule 5. COSTS.\n\nCosts are $80 in all criminal cases and in habeas corpus cases for persons whose liberty is being restrained by virtue of a sentence imposed against them by a state court. Costs are $300 in all other civil cases.\n\nCosts shall be paid at the time of filing of the case in this Court except in direct appeals, where costs accrue on docketing but shall be paid at the time of filing of the appellant’s brief.\n\nCosts need not be paid again where a petition for certiorari or an application for discretionary or interlocutory appeal, for interim review, or for a certificate of probable cause has been granted. Costs are not required for certified questions, disciplinary cases, or State Bar or Office of Bar Admissions matters.\n\nCosts shall not be required where at the time the same are due:\n\n(1) the applicant or appellant is pro se (not represented by counsel) and incarcerated at the time of filing;\n\n(2) counsel for the applicant or appellant was appointed to represent the applicant or appellant in the trial court because of indigency and, at the time costs would be due, counsel files a statement that counsel was so appointed by the trial court; or\n\n(3) the applicant, appellant, or counsel for the applicant or appellant files an affidavit of indigency that includes an original signature and a proper jurat.\n\nThe Clerk is prohibited from receiving or filing an application, petition for certiorari, or the appellant’s brief in a direct appeal unless the costs have been paid or the provisions of (1)-(3) above have been satisfied.\n\nRule 6. FRIVOLOUS APPEAL. The Court may, with or without a motion, impose a penalty not to exceed $2,500 against any party and/or party’s counsel in any civil case in which there is a direct appeal, application for discretionary appeal, application for interlocutory appeal, petition for certiorari, or motion which the Court determines to be frivolous. The party or party’s counsel may respond to such a motion within 10 days or, if no motion was filed, file a motion for reconsideration within 10 days of receipt of the order. The imposition of such penalty shall constitute a money judgment in favor of appellee against appellant or appellants counsel or in favor of appellant against appellee or appellee’s counsel, as the Court directs. Upon filing of the remittitur in the trial court, the penalty may be collected as are other money judgments.\n\nRule 7. SANCTIONS. Breach of any of these rules may subject the offender to contempt and revocation of the license to practice in the Supreme Court.\n\nII. FILINGS\n\nRule 8. NOTICE OF DOCKETING. The Clerk shall notify all attorneys and all pro se parties of the docketing dates of all appeals, petitions for certiorari, and applications for appeal.\n\nRule 9. SUPERSEDEAS. The Court may issue supersedeas or other orders whenever deemed necessary. Service of motions for supersedeas shall be made on the opposing party or attorney before filing and so certified. A copy of the order being appealed and a copy of the Notice of Appeal must be included with the motion.\n\nRule 10. BRIEFS: TIME OF FILING. Appellant’s and cross-appellant’s briefs shall be filed within 20 days after the case is docketed (see also Rules 50 and 51, regarding requests for oral argument). Appellee’s and cross appellee’s briefs shall be filed within 40 days after the case is docketed or 20 days after the filing of appellant’s or cross appellant’s briefs, whichever is later. Appeal and cross appeal may be argued in one brief, but this shall not extend the time for filing.\n\nFailure to comply with an order of the Court directing the filing of a brief may cause the appeal to be dismissed and may subject the offender to sanctions. See Rule 7.\n\nRule 10. BRIEFS OF THE PARTIES: TIME OF FILING. – Effective as to cases that docket on or after December 2, 2019\n\n(1) Principal brief. The appellant shall file a principal brief within 20 days after the appeal is docketed.\n\n(2) Response brief. The appellee shall file a response brief within 40 days after the appeal is docketed or 20 days after the filing of the principal brief of the appellant, whichever is later.\n\n(3) Reply brief. The appellant may file a reply brief within 50 days after the appeal is docketed or within 10 days after the filing of the response brief of the appellee, whichever is later.\n\n(4) Cross-appeals. The cross-appellant shall file a principal brief within 20 days after the cross-appeal is docketed. The cross-appellee shall file a response brief within 40 days after the cross-appeal is docketed or 20 days after the filing of the principal brief of the crossappellant, whichever is later. The cross appellant may file a reply brief within 50 days after the cross-appeal is docketed or within 10 days after the filing of the response brief of the cross-appellee, whichever is later. Appeals and cross-appeals may be argued in one brief, but this shall not extend the time for filing or the page limits except by leave of the Court.\n\n(5) Failure to file briefs. A failure to comply with an order of the Court directing a party to file a brief may cause the filing to be rejected, and the appeal to be dismissed, and may subject a party and its counsel to sanctions under Rule 7.\n\nRule 11. DUE DATE. To determine the due date for filing, start counting with the day after docketing, including weekends and holidays. When an expiration date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, an official State or federal holiday, or a day when the Clerk’s office has been closed per order posted on the Court’s website, the time for filing is extended to the next business day.\n\nRule 11.1. FILINGS AFFECTED BY JUDICIAL EMERGENCY ORDERS. Effective May 28, 2020\n\nFor appeals, petitions for certiorari, applications, motions, disciplinary proceedings, and other proceedings for which any filing deadlines have been suspended by any order declaring a statewide judicial emergency (such as Chief Justice Melton’s March 14, 2020 Order), as extended by subsequent orders, or by a local judicial emergency order entered by the chief judge of a superior court, parties shall, when submitting any filing so affected, attach to the end of such filing a separate “Certificate of Timeliness.” Such certificate shall not be counted toward the applicable page limitation, see Rule 20 (5), and shall state the following:\n\n(a) the date the filing was due before the deadline for the filing was suspended (without regard to any non-emergency-related extensions previously granted, and without the application of OCGA § 1-3-1 (d) (3) where the filing deadline would have fallen on a weekend or legal holiday);\n\n(b) the number of days that remained before the date specified in (a), as of suspension of the deadline; and\n\n(c) that the filing being submitted is timely because it is being filed within the number of days calculated under (b), counting from the date the suspension is lifted (subject to OCGA § 1-3-1 (d) (3) if this new filing deadline falls on a weekend or legal holiday).\n\nIn the event a party’s filing deadline has been affected by any local judicial emergency order entered by the chief judge of a superior court or by any case-specific trial court order, a copy of each such order shall be attached to the party’s Certificate of Timeliness.\n\nThe Certificate of Timeliness should be in substantially this form.\n\nRule 12. EXTENSION OF TIME. Extensions of time for filing petitions for certiorari, applications, and motions for reconsideration will be granted only in unusual circumstances and only if the request is filed before the time for filing the pleading has expired.\n\nRequests for extension of time for filing briefs should be filed sufficiently in advance of the due date so that if the request is denied the briefs can still be filed within the time fixed by these rules.\n\nRequests not showing service on the opposing party will not be honored.\n\nA copy of the order granting the extension must be included as an exhibit to the document for which the extension was granted.\n\nRule 13. DETERMINATION OF FILING DATE. Except as otherwise provided in this rule, a document will be deemed filed in the Supreme Court of Georgia on the date it is electronically filed or physically received in the Supreme Court Clerk’s office and stamped filed by the Clerk’s office staff.\n\nElectronic Filing. Attorneys are required to file documents electronically with the Court and shall follow the policies and procedures governing electronic filing as set out in the Court’s electronic filing instructions at www.gasupreme.us/sced, unless the Court determines in a particular case that the filing shall be limited to conventional paper filing or unless the Court grants a request for exemption from mandatory electronic filing for good cause shown.\n\nConventional Paper Filing.\n\n(1) Filing by Mail or Commercial Delivery. A document transmitted by priority, express, or first-class (including certified or registered) mail via the United States Postal Service, or by a third-party commercial carrier for delivery to the Supreme Court Clerk within three days, shall be deemed filed on the date shown by the official postmark affixed by the United States Postal Service (not a private or commercial postage meter) or the commercial carrier’s transmittal form on the envelope or package containing the document, but only if the envelope or package is properly addressed, postage is prepaid, and the postmark or transmittal date is legible.\n\n(2) Filings by Pro Se Prisoners. A document submitted by a prisoner who is not represented by counsel shall be deemed filed on the date the prisoner delivers the document to prison officials for forwarding to the Supreme Court Clerk. In the absence of an official United States Postal Service postmark showing a date on or before the filing deadline, such delivery shall be shown by the date on the certificate of service or on an affidavit submitted by the prisoner with the document stating that the prisoner is giving the document to prison officials with sufficient prepaid postage for first-class mail. Such a certificate or affidavit will give rise to a presumption that the date of filing reflected therein is accurate, but the State may rebut the presumption with evidence that the document was given to prison officials after the filing deadline or with insufficient postage. If the institution has a system designed for legal mail, the prisoner must use it to benefit from this rule.\n\nMotions for Reconsideration. Except when otherwise ordered, all motions for reconsideration, see Rule 27, must be physically received or electronically filed in the Clerk’s office within 10 days of the order or judgment for which reconsideration is sought.\n\nRule 14. SERVICE. Prior to filing, including filing by facsimile, service on opposing attorneys or pro se parties, stating their names and addresses, shall be certified. Briefs, petitions for certiorari, applications for appeal, and all motions and requests not so certified will not be accepted for filing.\n\nIn appeals involving death penalties, murder, aircraft hijacking, and treason, copies of the notice of appeal, briefs, motions, and all other filings must be served on the Attorney General, the District Attorney, and the attorney for the accused.\n\nRule 15. NUMBER OF COPIES.\n\nElectronic Transmission. Electronic filing of an electronic document in conformity with the Court’s e-filing standards is in lieu of a paper original and copy.\n\nNumber of Paper Copies. When the filer is a self-represented party or an attorney exempted from the e-file requirements, see Rule 13, an original and one copy of every document shall be filed.\n\nRule 16. TYPE. All filings shall be printed or typed with not less than double-spacing between the lines, except in block quotations or footnotes. Margins shall be no less than one inch at the top, bottom and sides. The type size shall not be smaller than 12-point courier font or 14-point Times New Roman.\n\nRule 17. DOCUMENTS: FORMAT. Except for requests which should be made by letter to the Clerk, see Rules 12, 20 and 51, petitions, applications and motions shall be on letter size (8 1/2″ x 11″) paper with a back cover of recyclable paper that is heavier than regular stationery and shall be STAPLED at the top.\n\nResponses should be filed as briefs, see Rule 18.\n\nRule 18. BRIEFS: FORMAT. All briefs and responses shall be typed or printed on letter size (8 1/2″x 11″) paper with covers on the front and back, STAPLED on the left-hand side in booklet form. Covers shall be of recyclable paper, heavier than regular stationery, and shall bear the style of the case, the case number, and the name or names of the persons preparing the brief, along with their bar numbers, if attorneys.\n\nRule 19. BRIEFS: ENUMERATION OF ERRORS. The enumeration of errors (which shall contain a statement of jurisdiction as to why the Supreme Court, and not the Court of Appeals, has jurisdiction) shall be stated as a separate part of, and shall be incorporated in, the brief.(1)\n\n[Footnote]\n\n(1) The Court prescribes no particular arrangement for briefs, motions, applications for appeal, petitions for certiorari, or other papers. However, Rules specifying certain paper, size, and spacing must be complied with and page references to the record (R-) and transcript (T-) are essential. The volume of cases necessarily requires that all matters be presented succinctly. Inclusion of extraneous facts and frivolous issues tends to obscure critical issues.\n\nGenerally, a presentation by the moving party in the following order, where applicable, is the most efficient: Type of case showing Supreme Court jurisdiction, the judgment appealed, and date of entry; a brief statement of the facts showing the general nature of the case; the enumeration of errors; the argument in sequence with the enumeration of errors, including additional facts where essential, and citation of authorities; and the certification of service. Replies in the same order as presented by appellant are desirable.\n\nRule 19. BRIEFS: ENUMERATION OF ERRORS. – Effective as to cases that docket on or after November 29, 2021\n\nThe enumeration of errors (which shall contain a statement of jurisdiction as to why the Supreme Court, and not the Court of Appeals, has jurisdiction) shall be stated as a separate part of, and shall be incorporated in, the brief. (1) If a party contends that this Court has appellate jurisdiction because of a constitutional question, see Ga. Const. of 1983, Art. VI, Sec. VI, Par. II (1), its jurisdictional statement shall contain record citations to show where the constitutional question was raised below and where the trial court ruled on it.\n\n[Footnote]\n\n(1)The Court prescribes no particular arrangement for briefs, motions, applications for appeal, petitions for certiorari, or other papers. However, Rules specifying certain paper, size, and spacing must be complied with, and page references to the record (R-) and transcript (T-) are essential. The volume of cases necessarily requires that all matters be presented succinctly. Inclusion of extraneous facts and frivolous issues tends to obscure critical issues.\n\nGenerally, a presentation by the moving party in the following order, where applicable, is the most efficient: Type of case showing Supreme Court jurisdiction, the judgment appealed, and date of entry; a brief statement of the facts showing the general nature of the case; the enumeration of errors; the argument in sequence with the enumeration of errors, including additional facts where essential, and citation of authorities; and the certification of service. Replies in the same order as presented by appellant are desirable.\n\nRule 20. BRIEFS: PAGE LIMITATION. Briefs, petitions for certiorari, applications for appeal, motions, and responses shall be limited to 30 pages in civil cases, except upon written request filed in and authorized by the Court prior to the due date of the filing. In all criminal cases, except those in which the State is pursuing the death penalty or in which the death penalty has been imposed, briefs, petitions for certiorari, applications for appeal, motions, and responses shall be limited to 50 pages, except upon written request filed in and authorized by the Court prior to the due date of the filing. With respect to all of the aforementioned filings, tables of contents, tables of citations, appendices and certificates of service shall not be counted toward the applicable page limit.\n\nRule 20. BRIEFS: PAGE LIMITATIONS. – Effective as to cases that docket on or after December 2, 2019\n\n(1) Civil cases. In civil cases, principal briefs, petitions for certiorari, applications for appeal, motions, and responses are limited to 30 pages, and reply briefs are limited to 15 pages, except by leave of the Court.\n\n(2) Criminal cases generally.

However, the Court will allow all photographers and television stations to pool or divide the time, so that all will be allowed to participate.

STUDENT PRACTICE RULE\n\nRule 91. Purpose. The purpose of this Rule is to recognize and support experiential learning opportunities that currently exist for law students in Georgia and to broaden the potential range of such opportunities, thereby expanding access to justice through the work of properly qualified and supervised law students who are permitted, as if admitted and licensed to practice law, to represent and appear on behalf of units of government and persons unable to afford legal services. By expanding the range of work that law students may do as if admitted to practice, this Rule does not, however, address nor intend in any way to restrict the wide variety of activities in which law students currently assist lawyers in their practice of law, including both law school educational programs and traditional work as law clerks.\n\nRule 92. Activities Permitted by a Registered Law Student. An eligible law student registered for student practice pursuant to this Rule, when under the supervision of a member of the State Bar of Georgia, may, as if admitted and licensed to practice law in Georgia, advise, prepare legal instruments, appear before courts and administrative agencies and otherwise take action on behalf of:\n\n(1) any state, local, or other government unit or agency;\n\n(2) any person who is unable financially to pay for the legal services of an attorney; or\n\n(3) any non-profit organization the purpose of which is to assist low or moderate income persons.\n\nWhen a registered law student appears before a court or agency, the judge or presiding officer has authority to prescribe the form and manner by which such student may participate in proceedings. A registered law student may neither ask for nor receive any compensation or remuneration of any kind from any client for whom the student renders services; but this shall not prevent the student from receiving compensation, or a scholarship, stipend or other remuneration from a law school, governmental entity, or other non-profit agency in acknowledgment of the services the student is performing. Nothing in this Rule prohibits a supervising attorney, or organization employing such supervising attorney, from applying for, charging, or collecting a fee relating to activities of the registered law student authorized by this Rule that the attorney or organization otherwise may properly apply for, charge, or collect. Communications between the client of a supervising attorney and a registered law student shall be privileged to the same extent as communications protected by attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine and protected as confidential under the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct, and the presence of a registered law student during communications between the supervising attorney and the client shall not waive any otherwise applicable evidentiary privilege or duty of confidentiality.\n\nNothing contained in this Rule shall affect the right of any person who is not admitted to practice law to do anything that he or she might lawfully do prior to the adoption of this Rule nor the right of lawyers to use assistants in their practice as permitted by the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nRule 93. Requirements for Registration. A law student is eligible for registration if the student:\n\n(1) is enrolled at the time of original registration in a school of law approved by the American Bar Association; and\n\n(2) has completed at the time of original registration legal studies equivalent to at least two semesters of full-time study.\n\nRule 94. Procedure for Registration. To register an eligible law student under this Rule, the student’s law school must file with the Office of Bar Admissions the following:\n\n(1) certification by the law school dean that:\n\n(a) the student has completed legal studies equivalent to at least two semesters of full-time study,\n\n(b) the student is currently in good academic standing, and\n\n(c) to the best of the knowledge of the dean, the student is of good moral character and is prepared to begin the work described under this Rule;\n\n(2) certification by the law student that the student has read and is familiar with the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct and that the student will comply with all provisions of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct applicable to activities undertaken by the student pursuant to this Rule; and\n\n(3) an oath signed by the student including at a minimum the following affirmations or equivalent statements:\n\n(a) “I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Georgia.”\n\n(b) “I will maintain the respect due to courts of justice and judicial officers.”\n\n(c) “I will employ such means only as are consistent with truth and honor, and will never seek to mislead by any artifice or false statement of fact or law.”\n\n(d) “I will maintain and protect all confidences entrusted to me.”\n\n(e) “I will in all other respects conduct myself personally and professionally in conformity with the high standards of conduct imposed upon members of the State Bar of Georgia.”\n\nThe registration shall remain in effect until the student’s graduation from law school unless terminated.\n\nUpon determining that a student has complied with the above requirements for registration, the Office of Bar Admissions shall assign a number identifying the registered student and provide to the student evidence of registration, which may be in either electronic or printed form. The registered student shall include this identifying number on the signature line of any document prepared pursuant to Rule 95(4), and shall produce evidence of registration upon request when appearing before any court or tribunal of this state.\n\nThe Director of the Office of Bar Admissions may terminate registration at any time without prior notice or hearing and without any showing of cause. The Director of the Office of Bar Admissions shall terminate registration upon receipt of notice from the law school dean that:\n\n(1) the student has been placed on academic probation;\n\n(2) the student is no longer enrolled at the law school; or\n\n(3) the dean has determined to terminate the dean’s prior certification, which the dean may do at any time without prior notice or hearing and without any showing of cause.\n\nThe dean of the student’s law school may designate an associate or assistant dean or other appropriate law school official to file certifications and notices under this provision on the dean’s behalf.\n\nRule 95. Supervision of a Registered Law Student. An attorney who supervises a registered law student shall:\n\n(1) confirm that the certifications required by this Rule have been filed with the Office of Bar Admissions and that registration has not been terminated;\n\n(2) have personal and professional responsibility for all activities of the student registered pursuant to this Rule and ensure that the student is covered by an adequate amount of malpractice insurance unless the supervising attorney is a public prosecutor or otherwise an official protected by governmental immunity;\n\n(3) counsel and assist the student, and in particular provide guidance in matters of professional responsibility and legal ethics, in order to assure proper practical training of the student and effective representation of the person or entity receiving services in relation to activities of the student registered pursuant to this Rule;\n\n(4) review, approve and personally sign any document prepared by a student that is filed in any court or tribunal, and review and approve any document prepared by a student that would have binding legal effect on a person or entity receiving services in relation to activities of the student registered pursuant to this Rule, and require that any document signed by a law student states that the student is acting as a registered law student pursuant to this Rule;\n\n(5) obtain a signed consent from a person or entity being represented acknowledging that the supervising attorney is being assisted by the registered law student; and\n\n(6) be physically present during the conduct of any grand jury investigation, administrative proceeding, hearing, trial, or other proceeding in which the registered law student appears unless the judicial officer of the court or tribunal in which the student is appearing determines that the physical presence of the supervising attorney is not necessary.\n\nRule 96. Appearance and Argument before the Georgia Supreme Court. Law students authorized to practice under the Student Practice Rules, see Rules 91-96, or the Law School Graduate Rules, see Rules 97-103, may co-author briefs, indicating their status on the signature line. A law student participating in a clinical program at a Georgia law school may be authorized to make oral argument if the supervising attorney of the program files a motion to authorize the law student to argue and includes in the motion the name of the student seeking to argue, the extent of the attorney supervision to prepare the student for argument, and a statement that the supervising attorney will be personally present and prepared to supplement any oral statement made by the student. The Court must give specific approval for the law student’s participation in the argument. Law students and recent law school graduates are not eligible to present oral argument based on their participation in legal training programs organized in the offices of governments and non-profit organizations.\n\nXVI.

An eligible law-school graduate is a recent graduate of a Georgia law school or of an accredited law school from another state who has not yet received the results of his or her first taking of any bar examination. Such graduate shall file a petition to practice as a law-school graduate with the Clerk of the Supreme Court, setting out the graduate’s name, address, the name of the law school from which he or she graduated and the date thereof, and the name, title and signature of the Attorney General, district attorney, solicitor general, solicitor, public defender, or licensed practicing attorney as described in Rule 97, whom the graduate intends to assist. If available, evidence of certification of fitness to practice law from the Board to Determine Fitness of Bar Applicants issued under Part A, Section 11 of the Rules Governing Admission to the Practice of Law, or similar certification from another state, shall be attached to the petition. If not available, the status of the graduate’s fitness application in Georgia or any other state, if any, shall be set out in the petition. A graduate who has been denied or tentatively denied certification of fitness to practice law in Georgia, or any other state, shall not be eligible to practice under this Rule.\n\nApplication for a certificate of fitness to take the bar examination is not a prerequisite to eligibility to practice as a graduate.\n\nAny graduate eligible to assist the Attorney General, a district attorney, solicitor general, solicitor, or public defender under this Rule is not required to possess the qualifications for appointment to the office of Attorney General, district attorney, solicitor general, solicitor, public defender, or assistant attorney general, assistant district attorney, assistant solicitor general, assistant solicitor, or assistant public defender.\n\nRule 100.
