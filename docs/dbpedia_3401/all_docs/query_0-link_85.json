Assistant Regulation Counsel attorneys in the Intake Division act as the officeâs triage unit. Its six attorneys are the front line for all complaints, deciding how a case is handled and whether it moves forward.

Diversion agreements and probation conditions protect the public while allowing an otherwise competent attorney to continue practicing. The officeâs full-time case monitor ensures compliance with the conditions of probation and diversion programs.
