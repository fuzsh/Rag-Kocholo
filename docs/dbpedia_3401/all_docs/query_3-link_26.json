        "text": "To set a hearing, please call the Judge’s office at 772-288-5556 .\n\nSmall claims Pretrial Conferences and dockets will occur on Tuesday mornings and will be scheduled by the Clerk. Trials from those dockets shall be set at the pretrial conference.\n\nAll mandatory traffic, non-criminal citations, etc., will be scheduled on the first Wednesday of the month.\n\nJudge Waters is restricted by principles of Judicial Ethics from communicating about pending cases outside of hearings. Communication to the judge without prior notice to opposing party is “ex parte” and improper except in certain specific circumstances. Judge Waters is generally not permitted to read or consider ex parte communications. Therefore, the opposing party MUST be copied on any and all documents submitted to the Judge.\n\nNeither the Judge, nor her Judicial Assistant may provide any party with legal advice."
