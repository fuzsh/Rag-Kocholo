        "text": "When the evidence matches the elements of a crime as described in the law and is, in the view of our attorneys, sufficient to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, indicted cases are presented to the grand jury in the county where the alleged offense occurred. The grand jury is a panel of 18 citizens who review these cases. Unlike a trial jury, which is chosen for a single term of court, grand jurors serve one-year terms and meet monthly.\n\nTo secure a “true-bill” indictment, our solicitors most prove probable cause, although as a matter of office policy, they will only present cases they believe they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt. The solicitor cannot act as a witness or be present during deliberations, which are secret and may not be inquired into.\n\nThe defendant has no right to be present and is not permitted to present evidence to the grand jury.\n\nOnce presented with evidence, the grand jury can vote to “true-bill” the indictment, “no-bill” the indictment, or take no action. Unlike juries in a trial, grand juries do not need to reach unanimous decisions. A “true-billed” indictment means that at least 12 of the 18 members have determined the state met its burden and can proceed to trial. A “no-bill” indictment means probable cause was not established and fewer than 12 of 18 voted to true-bill the charge. A grand jury may elect to take no action if they need more evidence to decide, though this is rare.\n\nIn some states, local grand juries have investigative powers. That is not the case with county-level grand juries in South Carolina. However, a state grand jury with such powers can be empaneled under certain circumstances.\n\nA grand jury hearing is a right guaranteed by both the state constitution and the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in cases involving General Sessions-level charges. However, a defendant will sometimes waive indictment, bypassing the grand jury altogether – usually to expedite the process when they intend to enter a guilty plea.\n\nThe American Bar Association’s Standard 3-3.9, Discretion in the Charging Decision states that a prosecutor should neither make a charge nor permit the continued pendency of a criminal charge for which there is a lack of admissible evidence to support a conviction. This means our attorneys are sometimes ethically obligated to dismiss charges brought by law enforcement, even if they believe officers probably arrested the guilty party. “Probably” simply isn’t good enough in our world.\n\nWith that in mind, a dismissal does not necessarily mean that law enforcement acted improperly or made a “bad” arrest. Rather, a dismissal is most typically a consequence of two considerations. First, it is understood that officers must often make charging decisions in the interest of public safety before all evidence can be collected and analyzed. Second, prosecutors must meet a higher standard of proof than law enforcement. So if a key witness recants, a victim does not cooperate in the investigation or a lab test returns an exculpatory result not available at the time of arrest, a prosecutor might have no ethical alternative but to dismiss a charge, even if the initial arrest was perfectly justified under the “probable cause” standard.\n\nCases can be dismissed for other reasons and is not necessarily an indication that the Solicitor’s Office did not pursue prosecution or will not do so in the future. Among other reasons a case might be dismissed:\n\nIt is remanded for further investigation: Sometimes, when evidence is insufficient to prove a charge beyond a reasonable doubt, the Solicitor’s Office asks the law enforcement agency that brought it to investigate further. The S.C. Supreme Court issued an docket order on May 24, 2023, effective July 3, 2023, that, among other things, requires law enforcement to provide prosecutors with all available evidence within 30 days of arrest. If the agency fails to do so, the solicitor can my remand the case. If 30 more days pass without the solicitor receiving adequate evidence, the solicitor has 10 days to “administratively dismiss” the charge. The order created a new category for such dismissals, which as of July 3, 2023, are to be labeled “dismissed: returned to law enforcement for further investigation” and removed from the public index of pending cases. (Previously, such cases were simply marked “dismissed.”) This does not necessarily mean the defendant will not eventually be prosecuted for the charge, however. There is no statute of limitations in South Carolina, and prosecution can resume if new evidence supporting the charge comes to light.\n\nIt is dismissed by a judge: As described in a preceding section about preliminary hearings, a magistrate can determine that law enforcement did not have probable cause to make an arrest and dismiss a charge. However, even when this occurs, a solicitor can still seek a direct indictment from the grand jury and proceed with prosecution.\n\nA defendant enters a diversion program: Defendants who are eligible for Pretrial Intervention can have their records expunged upon completion of the program. (In such instances, expungements are not automatic, however; defendants still must follow a separate process for removing offenses from their criminal records.) Under such circumstances, the original charge is recorded as “dismissed,” even though prosecution was pursued and the defendant faced consequences. (The law does not allow the Solicitor’s Office to publicly confirm or acknowledge that a defendant has completed PTI or even that he or she has entered into the program.)\n\nA judge grants a conditional discharge: This means that the court offered the defendant certain conditions, such as treatment and rehabilitation, instead of being found guilty. As with PTI, the charge is dismissed, even though prosecution was pursued by the Solicitor’s Office and consequences faced by the defendant.\n\nThe defendant’s case is moved to federal court: The 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office has a unique relationship with the U.S. Department of Justice, in which an assistant solicitor is embedded with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and authorized to pursue federal charges against 14th Circuit offenders whose crimes meet certain criteria. Usually, these are gun or drug charges for which federal penalties are stronger than those in the state system and more appropriate for the offender. When cases are moved into the federal system, the original state charges are typically dismissed.\n\nDefendant’s charges are remanded to a lower court: Sometimes, after analyzing a General Sessions-level charge, the Solicitor’s Office determines that the evidence supports only a lower-level charge. For instance, a defendant originally charged with first- or second-degree assault and battery has actually committed a third-degree assault and battery. Though still a crime, this offense carries a lesser penalty and is not prosecuted in General Sessions Court. In such a case, the Solicitor’s Office would file a dismissal and remand the charge to law enforcement for prosecution in Magistrate or Municipal court.\n\nThe defendant fails to appear for trial: Sometimes, defendants do not show up for trial or a mandatory hearing. When this happens, a bench warrant is typically issued for the defendant’s arrest. These cases can remain in administrative limbo until the defendant is apprehended. For recordkeeping purposes, some agencies mark these cases as dismissed, even though the Solicitor’s Office stands ready to proceed with the prosecution.\n\nThe charge is extraneous or unlikely to result in additional prison time: Often, a case consists of multiple charges that arose as part of the same criminal incident. To secure convictions, a prosecutor must prove each element of each charge. Sometimes, that is worthwhile and will result in a longer prison term. In other instances, additional charges aren’t likely to add to the penalty – the defendant would most likely serve concurrent sentences even if convicted. By pursuing such charges, the prosecutor risks confusing the jury or jeopardizing a conviction on the most serious offenses. In other instances, proving one of a large set of charges might require a victim to testify and be retraumatized in the process. In either of these circumstances, a solicitor might determine it is prudent to dismiss some charges and let others stand. If this decision is made after indictments are already secured, these dismissals will likely be marked as “nolle prossed,” which is legal term that means the charge has been abandoned by the prosecutor. Again, however, South Carolina has no statute of limitations, and prosecutors might have the option of reindicting for the offense if circumstances change.\n\nDefendant dies awaiting trial: It’s rare, but it happens. When it does, the Solicitor’s Office will officially close out the case by filing a dismissal.\n\nAll defendants are entitled to a trial before a jury of their peers. In fact, defendants have additional rights that affect the conduct of those trials – for instance, the presumption of innocence and the protection against self-incrimination. As such, defendants have the option, but are not required, to submit evidence or call witnesses. If the defendant chooses not to testify, the judge will instruct the jury that it cannot consider this fact during deliberations. It is not uncommon for the defense to rest without presenting any case at all, relying instead on cross-examination of prosecution witnesses and the closing argument of the defense attorney.\n\nThe burden of proof is squarely on the state – that’s the Solicitor’s Office – to prove charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, prosecutors do not have carte blanche in arguing their case. Under most circumstances, for instance, the state cannot mention the defendant’s criminal history in front of the jury or submit hearsay evidence – that is, statements supposedly made by one person that are entered into the record through testimony of another person.\n\nThe judge is the sole interpreter of the law and the admissibility of evidence. However, it is improper for the judge to offer an opinion about the facts in front of the jury.\n\nAfter the prosecution and defense have opportunities to make opening statements, present evidence and testimony, and make closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law. Jurors then retire to the jury room for deliberations. All 12 jurors must agree on the verdict. If there are multiple charges, they must consider each charge separately. Occasionally, a jury cannot reach a decision, resulting in a “hung jury” and a mistrial. In that event, the Solicitor’s Office will decide whether to try the case again in front of a new jury.\n\nIf the defendant is convicted on one or more charges, the jury is dismissed, and the judge begins sentencing proceedings. (The exception is when capital punishment is a possibility; in that case, a second phase of the trial begins, in which the jury determines whether the defendant should receive the death penalty.) In South Carolina, sentencing usually follows immediately after the reading of the verdict but can be conducted at a later date, too.\n\nThere is no set timeframe for the duration of a jury trial or of a jury’s deliberations, although most trials range from one to three days."
