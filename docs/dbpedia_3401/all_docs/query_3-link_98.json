        "text": "Child Guidance Clinic and Doctoral Psychology Externship\n\nOVERVIEW:\n\nThe Child Guidance Clinic (CGC) has an externship program that offers training in both assessment and therapy, with a primary focus on assessment. The CGC has full-year and summer practicum placements for graduate students enrolled in doctoral psychology programs. The CGC has been a clinical training site for over 20 years. We are a staff of five licensed clinical psychologists, including specialists in forensic psychology and neuropsychology, with a multitude of assessment, therapy, and research experience. There are also two deputy clerks who assist the clinical staff and trainees by scheduling appointments, finalizing reports, and helping our youth and families feel welcome and comfortable.\n\nThe CGC is a unit within the DC Superior Court’s Social Services Division. The mission of the Court Social Services Division (CSSD) is to assist the Court in the administration of justice and serve court-involved youth. The CGC provides clinical and forensic evaluations, and individual and group treatment for youth through various diagnostic and treatment processes. These clinical services assist the Court in making decisions in the juvenile case process. The youth served by the CGC typically range from age 12 to age 18. Many of them come from underserved communities and have histories of academic difficulties, family conflict, and exposure to trauma. Charges faced by the youth most often include assault, possession of a weapon, unauthorized use of a vehicle, substance use or possession, truancy, runaway, theft, or robbery. Parent/guardian involvement is necessary for all clinical services provided.\n\nAn externship placement with the CGC is an opportunity for students to sharpen their clinical assessment and integrative report writing skills. It is also an opportunity for students to enhance their psychotherapy skills and clinical interviewing techniques, and gain experience in a forensic setting.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n\nThe primary focus of the CGC’s externship program is psychological assessment. Practicum students perform comprehensive psychoeducational and psychological evaluations of court-involved youth, which include intellectual, academic, adaptive, personality, socioemotional, and/or diagnostic measures, as well as clinical interviews, collateral interviews, and court document review. All evaluations are court-ordered by a judge. The data gathered during these evaluations are integrated into a comprehensive evaluation report written by the student. These reports are given to court personnel involved in the youth’s case (e.g., probation officer, defense attorney) in order to assist the Court with better understanding the youth’s psychosocial functioning, placing the youth’s misbehavior within the context of his or her life and developmental level, recommending appropriate placement and interventions, and assisting with treatment planning.\n\nThis placement is an opportunity for students to sharpen their clinical assessment skills. Therefore, students are expected to possess thorough working knowledge and skills in clinical and diagnostic interviewing of clients and relevant collateral informants. Students should also be proficient in psychological testing, scoring, interpretation of test data, and report writing, which includes recommendations. Standard psychological tests include: WISC-V, WAIS-IV, WJ-IV, PAI-A, BASC-3, and Conners CBRS. Students will also have the opportunity to learn and utilize a broader array of assessment measures.\n\nPSYCHOTHERAPY:\n\nPracticum students provide individual and/or group therapy services to the youth. In-person treatment services are conducted on court premises, which may include the CGC or one of the Court’s satellite offices offering after-school programming. As our clients are juveniles, on-site therapy takes place after school Monday through Thursday between 4:00 to 8:00 pm, with 7:00 pm being the last appointment time. Virtual, remote, and/or telehealth therapy is conducted via phone or video chat during normal business hours (8:30 am to 5:00 pm).\n\nExterns and interns also participate in a weekly 2-hour didactic seminar on Thursday afternoons. Seminars typically consist of a 1-hour workshop facilitated by a CGC staffmember or external specialist, followed by one hour of group supervision or student case presentations. On a rotating basis, students present an individual case for exploration and discussion and receive feedback from staff and student colleagues. Students follow therapy cases throughout their training and supervision tenure to monitor ongoing dynamics and longitudinal progress of clients.\n\nStudents are expected to have successfully taken basic courses in psychotherapy and acquired curricula should include materials on ethics and multicultural considerations. Students should have experience with maintaining progress/process notes and other relevant documentation.\n\nGUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS:\n\nStudents in placement at the CGC are required to be advanced doctoral students enrolled in an American Psychological Association (APA) accredited, accreditation-eligible, or provisionally accredited doctoral program in clinical or counseling psychology. Full-year practicum students are expected to remain in placement for one academic year and no less than eight months. The training year typically runs from August 1 through June 30, though there is flexibility regarding end dates and the exact time frame may be negotiated with CGC training faculty. Full-year students are required to attend a multi-day orientation event which typically takes place during the last week of July or first week of August. Summer practicum students typically train at the CGC from June to August. There is flexibility regarding start and end dates for summer externs and the exact time frame may be negotiated with CGC training faculty. Summer students are required to attend a one-day orientation event which typically takes place in mid-May.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\n\nStudents are expected to spend no less than 16 hours weekly attending to their duties regarding the CGC. The exact number of hours spent on site can vary according to the criteria of the students’ school and scheduling. Some of the weekly hours are spent writing evaluation reports, which can take place at home. Students can expect to complete an evaluation and report every one to two weeks, though the specific number of evaluations per week will be determined by the student, his or her supervisor, and the needs of the Court.\n\nSUPERVISION:\n\nStudents will be assigned an individual supervisor who is a licensed psychologist. The student’s supervisor will direct the work and provide one-on-one feedback on a weekly basis. Students will be expected to conceptualize assessment cases during supervision and provide clinical progress notes for therapy sessions. Students are also able to receive group supervision during Thursday seminar. In addition, each Court-designated site has a site supervisor. Site supervisors are members of the Court Social Services Division and provide administrative assistance, logistical guidance, and mentorship. Site supervisors will be responsible for ensuring that service delivery is in compliance with Court rules.\n\nThe student’s individual supervisor will complete periodic written evaluations of the student, using forms either sent by the student’s school program or the CGC’s own forms. Some schools may request both forms. A copy of the CGC’s form will be kept on record for future reference. The CGC and the DC Superior Court reserve the right to remove any student for substandard performance.\n\nStudents will receive supervised experience in: (a) clinical assessment techniques, (b) expanding knowledge and experience with an array of assessment tools, (c) integrative report writing, (d) increasing awareness of cultural diversity and its role in clinical processes, (e) providing culturally sensitive clinical services, (f) establishing and maintaining rapport and therapeutic relationships with clients, (g) developing knowledge and skill in therapy tools, theories, and techniques, (h) adapting professional behavior and competence to meet different needs (intake interviewing, crisis intervention, etc), (i) ethical practice and decision-making, (j) developing insights into one’s own clinical identity and the impact of one’s behavior upon clients and (k) expanding knowledge of current literature regarding effective assessment and therapy skills, theories, and implementation.\n\nPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT:\n\nAll students are expected to maintain ethical and professional conduct in accordance with APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct. Students should be familiar with the APA Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology. Students will adhere to the guidelines set forth by the Court. Students will receive information about these standards during Orientation at the Court. Additionally, all clinical materials will remain the property of the Clinic and the DC Superior Court.\n\nAPPLICATION PROCEDURES:\n\nTo apply for an externship placement, please send a current curriculum vitae (CV), a letter of introduction stating your interest, two letters of recommendation from persons responsible for your training to date and/or familiar with your clinical skills, a redacted evaluation report (including multiple assessment instruments; preferably of a juvenile), and a redacted therapy conceptualization report or clinical progress note, via email to the CGC’s Deputy Clerks Ms. Terri Strickland at Terri.Strickland [at] dcsc.gov (Terri[dot]Strickland[at]dcsc[dot]gov) and Ms. Daniuska Ruiz at Daniuska.Ruiz [at] dcsc.gov (Daniuska[dot]Ruiz[at]dcsc[dot]gov), as well as the training coordinator Dr. Jennifer Christman at Jennifer.Christman.Training [at] dcsc.gov (Jennifer[dot]Christman[dot]Training[at]dcsc[dot]gov).\n\nDEADLINES:\n\nApplications are due at the ClGC by close of business on the first Friday in February. Decisions made about interviews shortly follow. After applications are reviewed, a decision will be made whether or not an interview offer will be extended to the applicant. The ultimate decision regarding an externship offer will be made by the CGC after completion of interviews. As noted, attending orientation events is mandatory for all students. Dates for orientation will be provided as soon available. Please plan accordingly."
