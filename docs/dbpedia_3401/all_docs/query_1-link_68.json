        "text": "Sealing Records\n\nIf the court grants your expungement request, the court will seal all of the related records. If anyone asks about the expunged case, court staff will say the case does not exist.\n\nBCI is responsible for telling all state agencies that your records are sealed. BCI will also forward a copy of the order to the FBI. Unless there is a specific law that says something different or the court orders something different, government agencies who receive an expungement order will tell anyone who asks that your arrest or conviction did not happen. A government agency who has received an expungement order may not give out any information identifying you.\n\nIf your records are expunged you may respond to an inquiry as though that arrest or conviction did not occur.\n\nHow to expunge appellate records\n\nIf a defendant in a criminal case appealed their case to the Utah Court of Appeals or Utah Supreme Court, they may also want to expunge their appellate records. This requires a separate process and does not happen automatically just because the trial court expunged its records.\n\nTo do this, the defendant must file a petition with the Utah Supreme Court. This process is governed by Supreme Court Standing Order No. 12.\n\nContinued Use of Sealed Records\n\nAfter sealing, BCI continues to index and maintain all expunged records of arrests and convictions, but the records will not be released to the public. BCI will not divulge any information contained in the expunged records to any person or agency without a court order, unless authorized by statute to do so. Upon request, the following organizations may receive information contained in expunged records:\n\nthe Board of Pardons and Parole;\n\nPeace Officer Standards and Training;\n\nfederal authorities, unless prohibited by federal law;\n\nthe Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing; and\n\nthe State Office of Education.\n\nWhen considering whether to issue a permit to carry a concealed firearm, BCI may use the information in expunged records in determining whether the applicant or permit holder has been or is a danger to self or others.\n\nExpunged records may be released to or viewed by the petitioner if they show identification at the courthouse. Expunged records may also be released to or viewed by parties to a civil action arising out of the incident, including a law enforcement officer in the officer's defense of a civil action. These parties must first obtain a court order to unseal the record. The information must be kept confidential and used only in the civil action.\n\nUtah Code 77-40a-404\n\nIf the petitioner is later charged with a felony, the state may petition the court to open expunged records. A court may order expunged records to be opened and admitted into evidence for sentencing. The expunged records are confidential and are available for inspection only by the court, parties, counsel for the parties, and any other person authorized by the court. At the end of the proceeding, the court will order the records resealed.\n\nForms\n\nRequired forms"
