        "text": "The State Court Traffic Division of the DeKalb Solicitor-General’s office has many responsibilities. While our primary focus is upon the prosecution of Title 40 traffic citations issued in DeKalb County, we are also responsible for two sections of the Magistrate Court where citations for violations of DeKalb County Ordinances and Animal Control Ordinances are prosecuted. Traffic and Magistrate Court cases are separate and distinct jurisdictions. Neither Court has jurisdiction over cases properly heard in the other Court.\n\nThe Assistant Solicitors in our office have duties and responsibilities that include the review & assessment of all cases in the Courts to which they are assigned, including contact with the court, defense attorneys, defendants, witnesses and victims. Attorneys at Traffic Division are in court daily. This unit is led by our Supervising Assistant Solicitor Roberta Dural."
