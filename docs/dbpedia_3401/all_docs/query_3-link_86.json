        "text": "When an adult is unable to care for himself, or a child’s parents are unable to care for the child, a guardianship may be needed. Read on for more information about the purpose and types of guardianship and where to file for guardianship.\n\nWhat is Guardianship?\n\nWhy Might a Guardianship Be Needed?\n\nWhere to File for Guardianship\n\nTypes of Guardianship\n\nHow Long Does a Guardianship Last?\n\nWhat is Guardianship?\n\nGuardianship means obtaining the legal authority to make decisions for another person. A “guardian” is the person appointed by the court to make decisions on behalf of someone else. The person over whom the guardianship is granted (the child or the adult) is referred to as the “protected person.”\n\nWhy Might a Guardianship Be Needed?\n\nNormally, parents have the legal right to make decisions for their children, and adults have the legal right to make decisions for themselves. Sometimes this is not possible, and someone else needs to step in to take care of a child or an adult.\n\nA guardianship may be needed over a child if there is no parent available to care for a child. A guardian over the child's estate may be needed if the child inherited assets (for instance, life insurance or cash accounts). This protects the assets until the child is an adult.\n\nA guardianship may be needed over an adult if the adult is incapacitated, meaning the person is unable to take care of himself or herself due to mental illness, mental deficiency, disease, or mental incapacity. There are a number of alternatives to guardianship that may work better than a court-ordered guardianship.\n\nWhere to File for Guardianship\n\nA guardianship case usually must be filed in the county where the proposed protected person has been living for the past six months. There are some exceptions to this general rule. Legal advice is strongly recommended when deciding where to file for guardianship over a person who has not been in Nevada for six months or more. See Lawyers & Legal Help for information on where to get legal advice.\n\nTypes of Guardianship\n\nThere are three different types of guardianship in Nevada:\n\nGuardianship over the Person: this type of guardianship means the guardian is responsible for the well-being and care of the protected person. The guardian will be able to make personal and medical decisions for the person, including healthcare decisions, decisions about where the person will live, and in the case of children, decisions regarding school.\n\nGuardianship over the Estate: this type of guardianship allows the guardian to make financial decisions for the person. Court approval is typically needed to spend or sell any of the person’s assets, even after a guardianship is granted.\n\nGuardianship over the Person and Estate: this type of guardianship allows the guardian to make personal, medical, and financial decisions for the protected person.\n\nHow Long Does a Guardianship Last?\n\nA guardianship over an adult lasts until the adult regains the ability to care for himself, or until the adult passes away.\n\nA court-ordered guardianship over a child lasts until the child turns 18. If the child will not graduate high school until the age of 19, the child and the guardian can ask that the guardianship continue until the child graduates high school or turns 19, whichever happens first. The request to continue the guardianship must be made at least 2 weeks before the child turns 18."
