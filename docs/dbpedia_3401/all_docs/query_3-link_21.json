(Flyer)\n\nWelcome:\n\nThe Ingham County Friend of the Court (FOC) developed this website in year 2000 to bring you information about the Ingham County Circuit Court, Family Division, and specifically the operations of the Friend of the Court office. The Friend of the Court was created by statute to assist the Family Court in establishing, enforcing and modifying orders regarding:\n\nChild Custody\n\nParenting Time\n\nDomicile/Legal Residency\n\nChild Support\n\nChild Care Expenses\n\nUninsured Medical Expenses\n\nDomestic disputes are often difficult and challenging for parties to resolve. However, the major focal point of judicial concern, as well as the concern of the Ingham County Friend of the Court, is the minor children of the parties involved in the dispute. Our goal is to help parties work together to serve the best interest of the children. The Friend of Court provides various services in an effort to reach this goal that includes providing Facilitative and Information Gathering Conferences, FOC Investigations regarding child custody, parenting time and child support, child support reviews, child support enforcement, medical enforcement, and enforcement regarding custody and parenting time related provisions in orders. The Ingham County Friend of Court can also refer cases to an outside agency for mediation services. When a dispute cannot be resolved between the parties, cases may need to be scheduled for hearing before a FOC Referee or the Judge assigned to the case.\n\nThe Friend of Court staff understands that you and your children may be going through a difficult time. We also understand that we may be dealing with sensitive issues involving you, your children, your family and your finances. If you are involved in a domestic dispute, the Judges of Ingham County have adopted procedures to insure full compliance with the law and help guarantee fairness to the parties involved.\n\nWe hope that you find this website to be helpful. If you believe that there is information on the website that needs to be updated or changed, please feel free to contact your caseworker.\n\nSincerely,"
