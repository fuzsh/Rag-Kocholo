A separate court of \"equity\" could order someone to do something or to cease to do something (e.g., injunction). In American jurisprudence, the federal courts have both legal and equitable power, but the distinction is still an important one. For example, a trial by jury is normally available in \"law\" cases but not in \"equity\" cases.\n\nEquity\n\nThe value of a debtor's interest in property that remains after liens and other creditors' interests are considered. (Example: If a house valued at $60,000 is subject to a $30,000 mortgage, there is $30,000 of equity.)\n\nEvidence\n\nInformation presented in testimony or in documents that is used to persuade the fact finder (judge or jury) to decide the case in favor of one side or the other.\n\nEx parte\n\nA proceeding brought before a court by one party only, without notice to or challenge by the other side.\n\nExclusionary rule\n\nDoctrine that says evidence obtained in violation of a criminal defendant's constitutional or statutory rights is not admissible at trial.\n\nExculpatory evidence\n\nEvidence indicating that a defendant did not commit the crime.\n\nExecutory contracts\n\nContracts or leases under which both parties to the agreement have duties remaining to be performed.

For example, in some states the debtor may be able to exempt all or a portion of the equity in the debtor's primary residence (homestead exemption), or some or all \"tools of the trade\" used by the debtor to make a living (i.e., auto tools for an auto mechanic or dental tools for a dentist). The availability and amount of property the debtor may exempt depends on the state the debtor lives in.\n\nImpeachment\n\n1. The process of calling a witness's testimony into doubt.

The disputed point between parties in a lawsuit; 2. To send out officially, as in a court issuing an order.\n\nMagistrate judge\n\nA judicial officer of a district court who conducts initial proceedings in criminal cases, decides criminal misdemeanor cases, conducts many pretrial civil and criminal matters on behalf of district judges, and decides civil cases with the consent of the parties.\n\nMeans test\n\nSection 707(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code applies a \"means test\" to determine whether an individual debtor's chapter 7 filing is presumed to be an abuse of the Bankruptcy Code requiring dismissal or conversion of the case (generally to chapter 13).

Judges will generally \"follow precedent\" - meaning that they use the principles established in earlier cases to decide new cases that have similar facts and raise similar legal issues.

Typically, the judge and the parties also discuss the possibility of settlement of the case.\n\nPretrial services\n\nA function of the federal courts that takes place at the very start of the criminal justice process – after a person has been arrested and charged with a federal crime and before he or she goes to trial. Pretrial services officers focus on investigating the backgrounds of these persons to help the court determine whether to release or detain them while they await trial. The decision is based on whether these individuals are likely to flee or pose a threat to the community. If the court orders release, a pretrial services officer supervises the person in the community until he or she returns to court.\n\nPriority\n\nThe Bankruptcy Code's statutory ranking of unsecured claims that determines the order in which unsecured claims will be paid if there is not enough money to pay all unsecured claims in full.\n\nPriority claim\n\nAn unsecured claim that is entitled to be paid ahead of other unsecured claims that are not entitled to priority status.
