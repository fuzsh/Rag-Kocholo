        "text": "Who They Are\n\nU.S. probation and pretrial services officers and officer assistants:\n\nProvide services that protect the community;\n\nHelp the federal courts ensure the fair administration of justice; and\n\nInvestigate and supervise persons charged with and convicted of crimes against the United States.\n\nWhat They Do\n\nContribute to the justice process\n\nPretrial services officers\n\nWork with defendants \"pre-trial,\" after they're charged with federal crimes and while they're awaiting trial.\n\nHelp ensure that defendants released to the community before trial commit no crime while awaiting trial and return to court as required.\n\nProbation officers\n\nWork with offenders \"post-conviction,\" after they're tried and found guilty of federal crimes and after they're released from prison.\n\nHelp ensure that offenders released to the community obey the law rather than commit further crimes.\n\nOfficer assistants\n\nHelp probation and pretrial services officers carry out investigation and supervision duties, providing assistance and technical support in a wide range of areas.\n\nPerform such tasks as gathering information, preparing reports, and drafting correspondence related to cases.\n\nSupervise low-risk defendants and offenders, performing some of the same duties as officers, only under closer supervision.\n\nConduct investigations for the court\n\nOfficers investigate defendants and offenders for the court by gathering and verifying information about them. Investigations include:\n\ninterviews with defendants and offenders to find out about their backgrounds, including family, education, employment, finances, physical and mental health, and alcohol or drug abuse.\n\ncriminal history record checks.\n\ninterviews with other people who can provide helpful information, such as family members, employers, and law enforcement officials.\n\nreviews of records, such as court records, school records, military records, financial records, and employment records.\n\nThe pretrial services investigation\n\nis conducted before a person's initial appearance in court.\n\npresumes the defendant is innocent until proven guilty. The officer doesn't discuss the alleged offense or the defendant's guilt or innocence during the interview, or give the defendant legal advice or recommend an attorney.\n\nThe presentence investigation\n\nis conducted when a person enters a guilty plea or receives a guilty verdict following a trial.\n\nrequires the officer to assess the offender's living conditions, family relationships, community ties, and drug use.\n\nPrepare reports for the court\n\nBased on their investigations, officers prepare reports that the court relies on to make informed release decisions and choose fair sentences.\n\nThe pretrial services report\n\nrecommends whether to release or detain the defendant before trial.\n\naddresses whether the defendant is likely to stay out of trouble and return to court as required.\n\nrecommends release conditions for the court to impose if the defendant is released rather than detained. These must be the least restrictive conditions that will reasonably assure that the defendant appears in court and poses no danger to the community. Release conditions are tailored to the individual. For example, they may require that the defendant get drug testing and treatment, find and keep a job, or be placed on location monitoring.\n\nThe presentence report\n\nrecommends sentencing options under the federal sentencing guidelines.\n\naddresses the offense's impact on the victim and the offender's ability to pay fines and restitution.\n\nrecommends release conditions for the court to impose to help structure the offender's movement and behavior in the community. Release conditions are tailored to the individual. For example, they may require that the offender get drug testing and treatment, find and keep a job, or be placed on location monitoring.\n\nSupervise defendants and offenders in the community\n\nOfficers supervise defendants and offenders in the community to reduce the risk they pose to the public. Pretrial services officers supervise defendants released pending trial. Probation officers supervise offenders who are sentenced to a term of probation by the court or who are on parole or supervised release after they're released from prison. In supervising defendants and offenders, officers\n\nmake sure they comply with the release conditions set by the court and address any issues that affect their ability to comply.\n\nmonitor them through phone calls and personal contacts, including meeting with them in the probation or pretrial services office and at their homes or jobs.\n\nmonitor them through contacting others, including family members, employers, and treatment providers.\n\ndirect them to services to help them – such as substance abuse or mental health treatment, medical care, training, or employment assistance – as ordered by the court.\n\nmanage any risk they pose to individuals or the community by verifying their employment, monitoring their associates, restricting their travel, and taking other actions to make sure they're obeying the law.\n\nWhat Professional Standards Apply to Them\n\nOfficers and officer assistants do a job that presents unique demands and challenges. They work every day with people who may pose a threat to the community and to the officers and officer assistants themselves. They have access to confidential, sensitive, and private information. Officers also may carry firearms on duty in some districts. Officers and officer assistants must accept the seriousness of their responsibilities and carry out their duties with integrity. They also must be able to perform essential job functions that are critical to the safe and effective performance of the job. Officer and Officer Assistant Essential Job Functions.\n\nTo help ensure that persons who apply for judiciary law enforcement positions and individuals already performing the job are fit to serve, the U.S. probation and pretrial services system has put in place professional standards. These include\n\nbackground investigations for job applicants as a pre-employment condition. Also, individuals who are on the job must undergo 5-year reinvestigations.\n\nworkplace drug testing for job applicants as a pre-employment condition. Also, individuals who are on the job are subject to random and reasonable suspicion workplace drug tests, which are conducted to enforce zero tolerance for any use of illegal drugs.\n\nmedical standards for job applicants as a pre-employment condition. Also, individuals who are on the job may be subject to medical assessment as a condition of continued employment. Officer and Officer Assistant Medical Requirements.\n\nHow They Are Trained\n\nOfficers receive training on the job in their districts and may receive training from training programs offered nationally. Training begins when an officer is hired and continues throughout the officer's career. Training teaches new officers how to handle their responsibilities, enhances the skills of seasoned and supervising officers, and allows specialists to develop expertise in certain areas.\n\nFederal Probation and Pretrial Services Training Academy\n\nThe Federal Probation and Pretrial Services Training Academy, located at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Charleston, South Carolina, provides:\n\nNew officer orientation.
