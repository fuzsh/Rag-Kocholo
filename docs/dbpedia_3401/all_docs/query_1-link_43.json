        "text": "Facts\n\nCharged with capital murder in Florida, David Washington pleaded guilty and told the judge that he was under extreme stress at the time because of his inability to support his family. The judge sounded sympathetic, but Washington's defense counsel did not collect character evidence or request a psychiatric examination before the sentencing hearing. He made this decision so that the prosecution could not cross-examine Washington and use its own psychiatric report. He also did not seek a presentence report because he wanted to reduce the possibility that Washington's criminal record could be introduced, since this was related to an aggravating factor that would make the death penalty more likely.\n\nAfter the sentencing hearing, the trial judge found that the death penalty was appropriate because of the lack of mitigating factors and presence of several aggravating factors. Once the sentence was affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court, Washington sought to argue that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel based on the decisions by his lawyer outlined above. He was denied at the trial level and by the state Supreme Court, so he then sought habeas corpus relief in federal court. However, the district court found that the lawyer's decisions, which they agreed were mistaken, did not materially affect the outcome in the case. In other words, there was no reason to think that Washington would not have received the death penalty if the lawyer had taken more steps in collecting evidence.\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nSandra Day O'Connor (Author)\n\nWarren Earl Burger\n\nByron Raymond White\n\nHarry Andrew Blackmun\n\nLewis Franklin Powell, Jr.\n\nWilliam Hubbs Rehnquist\n\nJohn Paul Stevens\n\nThe majority found that the purpose of the right to effective assistance of counsel is tied to the right to a fair trial but does not extend beyond it. Counsel cannot be ineffective unless the mistakes were so objectively serious that they violated the defendant's right to a fair trial by causing a breakdown in the adversarial process. In measuring whether a lawyer's action met the standard of objective deficiency, the majority noted the ethical duties within the legal profession, such as zealous advocacy without conflicts of interest. However, it also observed that, while counsel must comply with all of those rules, they are not the limit of what can be expected, and this will vary according to the situation. Lawyers at least need to engage in a reasonable investigation of the case so that they have an understanding on which to base their strategies. An investigation sometimes can involve merely talking to a client, or it may require more substantial efforts. On the other hand, the range of strategies available to lawyers is broad, and many justifiable options may be available at any given time. This means that courts should refrain from using hindsight to evaluate whether a decision was objectively deficient if it might have potentially made sense at the time. Even if a decision is objectively deficient, moreover, prejudice cannot be presumed in most situations unless there is a conflict of interest. The defendant must show a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different if not for the deficiency. In the context of a conviction, this means that the deficient representation prevented the jury from having a reasonable doubt. In the context of the sentencing phase of a capital trial, it means that the deficient representation prevented the judge or jury from properly balancing aggravating and mitigating factors. As the court acknowledged, this evaluation depends in large part on the overall strength of the prosecution's case, since a conviction or death penalty that seems implausible is less likely to have happened without deficient counsel. In this particular situation, the majority felt that Washington's lawyer made a rational choice based on his conversations with Washington and the judge to avoid using psychiatric evidence or the presentence report and to avoid putting Washington in a position where he could be cross-examined. O'Connor found no evidence suggesting that Washington would have been sentenced to life in prison if the absent materials had been introduced.\n\nConcurrence\n\nWilliam Joseph Brennan, Jr. (Author)\n\nBrennan agreed with the majority's standard for evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel, since he did not envision it restricting defendants from presenting mitigating evidence. He opposed the death penalty in all forms and situations, however, believing that it violates the Eighth Amendment. Thus, Brennan did not agree with the portion of the majority's opinon that affirmed Washington's sentence.\n\nDissent\n\nThurgood Marshall (Author)\n\nMarshall found that the standard articulated by the majority was overly nebulous and subject to creating unpredictable outcomes. He pointed out that views of what is objectively deficient can vary according to the type of lawyer and the proceeding. Rather than tying the evaluation so tightly to the outcome, Marshall would have examined the impact of the deficiencies on procedural aspects and other phases earlier in the trial, since they can have a domino effect on the outcome. He did not feel that lawyers should be granted such broad discretion in their decision-making. In an intriguing observation on the uniqueness of death penalty trials, Marshall argued that defendants should be held to a lower standard in claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel in this context than in an ordinary trial. He found that certainty and the avoidance of any doubt is critical when imposing capital punishment, since it cannot be undone. This means that asking a defendant to show a reasonable probability that a death sentence would not have been imposed is unnecessarily stringent.\n\nCase Commentary"
