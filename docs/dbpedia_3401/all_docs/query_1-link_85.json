        "text": "This guidance remains in effect only to the extent that it is consistent with the court’s order in Ciox Health, LLC v. Azar, No. 18-cv-0040 (D.D.C. January 23, 2020), which may be found at https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2018cv0040-51. More information about the order is available at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/court-order-right-of-access/index.html. Any provision within this guidance that has been vacated by the Ciox Health decision is rescinded.\n\nYouTube embedded video: HIPAA: Your Health Information, Your Rights.\n\nMost of us believe that our medical and other health information is private and should be protected, and we want to know who has this information. The Privacy Rule, a Federal law, gives you rights over your health information and sets rules and limits on who can look at and receive your health information. The Privacy Rule applies to all forms of individuals' protected health information, whether electronic, written, or oral. The Security Rule is a Federal law that requires security for health information in electronic form.\n\nHIPAA Right of Access Videos\n\nOCR has teamed up with the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT to create Your Health Information, Your Rights!, a series of three short, educational videos (in English and option for Spanish captions) to help you understand your right under HIPAA to access and receive a copy of your health information.\n\nIndividual’s Right under HIPAA to Access their Health Information\n\nHIPAA Access Associated Fees and Timing\n\nHIPAA Access and Third Parties\n\nHIPAA Right of Access Infographic\n\nOCR has teamed up with the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT to create this one-page fact sheet, with illustrations, that provides an overall summary of your rights under HIPAA:\n\nYour Health Information, Your Rights!\n\nHIPAA General Fact Sheets\n\nYour Health Information Privacy Rights\n\nPrivacy, Security, and Electronic Health Records\n\nSharing Health Information with Family Members and Friends\n\nWho Must Follow These Laws\n\nWe call the entities that must follow the HIPAA regulations \"covered entities.\"\n\nCovered entities include:\n\nHealth Plans, including health insurance companies, HMOs, company health plans, and certain government programs that pay for health care, such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nMost Health Care Providers—those that conduct certain business electronically, such as electronically billing your health insurance—including most doctors, clinics, hospitals, psychologists, chiropractors, nursing homes, pharmacies, and dentists.\n\nHealth Care Clearinghouses—entities that process nonstandard health information they receive from another entity into a standard (i.e., standard electronic format or data content), or vice versa.\n\nIn addition, business associates of covered entities must follow parts of the HIPAA regulations.\n\nOften, contractors, subcontractors, and other outside persons and companies that are not employees of a covered entity will need to have access to your health information when providing services to the covered entity. We call these entities “business associates.” Examples of business associates include:\n\nCompanies that help your doctors get paid for providing health care, including billing companies and companies that process your health care claims\n\nCompanies that help administer health plans\n\nPeople like outside lawyers, accountants, and IT specialists\n\nCompanies that store or destroy medical records\n\nCovered entities must have contracts in place with their business associates, ensuring that they use and disclose your health information properly and safeguard it appropriately. Business associates must also have similar contracts with subcontractors. Business associates (including subcontractors) must follow the use and disclosure provisions of their contracts and the Privacy Rule, and the safeguard requirements of the Security Rule.\n\nWho Is Not Required to Follow These Laws\n\nMany organizations that have health information about you do not have to follow these laws.\n\nExamples of organizations that do not have to follow the Privacy and Security Rules include:\n\nLife insurers\n\nEmployers\n\nWorkers compensation carriers\n\nMost schools and school districts\n\nMany state agencies like child protective service agencies\n\nMost law enforcement agencies\n\nMany municipal offices\n\nWhat Information Is Protected\n\nInformation your doctors, nurses, and other health care providers put in your medical record\n\nConversations your doctor has about your care or treatment with nurses and others\n\nInformation about you in your health insurer’s computer system\n\nBilling information about you at your clinic\n\nMost other health information about you held by those who must follow these laws\n\nHow This Information Is Protected\n\nCovered entities must put in place safeguards to protect your health information and ensure they do not use or disclose your health information improperly.\n\nCovered entities must reasonably limit uses and disclosures to the minimum necessary to accomplish their intended purpose.\n\nCovered entities must have procedures in place to limit who can view and access your health information as well as implement training programs for employees about how to protect your health information.\n\nBusiness associates also must put in place safeguards to protect your health information and ensure they do not use or disclose your health information improperly.\n\nWhat Rights Does the Privacy Rule Give Me over My Health Information?\n\nHealth insurers and providers who are covered entities must comply with your right to:\n\nAsk to see and get a copy of your health records\n\nHave corrections added to your health information\n\nReceive a notice that tells you how your health information may be used and shared\n\nDecide if you want to give your permission before your health information can be used or shared for certain purposes, such as for marketing\n\nRequest that a covered entity restrict how it uses or discloses your health information\n\nGet a report on when and why your health information was shared for certain purposes\n\nIf you believe your rights are being denied or your health information isn’t being protected, you can\n\nFile a complaint with your provider or health insurer\n\nFile a complaint with HHS\n\nYou should get to know these important rights, which help you protect your health information.\n\nYou can ask your provider or health insurer questions about your rights.\n\nLearn more about your health information privacy rights.\n\nWho Can Look at and Receive Your Health Information\n\nThe Privacy Rule sets rules and limits on who can look at and receive your health information\n\nTo make sure that your health information is protected in a way that does not interfere with your health care, your information can be used and shared:\n\nFor your treatment and care coordination\n\nTo pay doctors and hospitals for your health care and to help run their businesses\n\nWith your family, relatives, friends, or others you identify who are involved with your health care or your health care bills, unless you object\n\nTo make sure doctors give good care and nursing homes are clean and safe\n\nTo protect the public's health, such as by reporting when the flu is in your area\n\nTo make required reports to the police, such as reporting gunshot wounds\n\nYour health information cannot be used or shared without your written permission unless this law allows it. For example, without your authorization, your provider generally cannot:"
