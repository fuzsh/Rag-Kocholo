        "text": "Litigation\n\nThe Civil Division attorneys represent the County, its elected officials and its employees (including its law enforcement officers) in all civil (non-criminal) lawsuits and claims involving the County or its elected officials and employees in their official capacities. Attorneys appear in many federal and state courts ranging from the local Justices of the Peace to the United States Supreme Court.\n\nCivil Division attorneys regularly represent the County and elected and appointed law enforcement officers in federal lawsuits filed by jail prisoners & detainees and others against claims of excessive force or other “violations of constitutional rights”. The attorneys vigorously defend such lawsuits by seeking dismissal of the lawsuits at the earliest possible stage in order to prevent the waste of valuable time, effort and money of County law enforcement officers and officials.\n\nThe Civil Division handles other civil claims filed by and against the County such as automobile collisions, personal injuries, property damage, employment disputes, challenges to County ordinances and all other matters in which the County or its elected officials are sued or required to appear in court.\n\nAttorneys in the Civil Division regularly work with law enforcement to seize and remove animals from situations where the animals are being mistreated. In most instances, the seizure and removals involve many animals from a single site or owner. In the past, Civil Division attorneys worked with other departments to successfully seize and remove more than 200 horses from a site and on another occasion over 200 cats from a residence. The Civil Division also represents the County Animal Control Department to remove dangerous dogs and other animals from the community.\n\nCivil Division attorneys also represent the County in involuntary mental health commitment proceedings in order to obtain treatment for individuals needing mental health treatment. Additionally, the attorneys represent individuals seeking protective orders in situations where family violence has occurred.\n\nBack to Top\n\nReal Property\n\nThe Civil Division attorneys assist and advise the County Commissioners and many County departments with regard to real estate issues and the acquisition, use, maintenance and disposition of real estate owned by Montgomery County.\n\nAttorneys in the Civil Division represent the County in acquiring road right-of-ways for improving transportation and real estate for use by the County for its various departments and elected offices. When right-of-way or other real estate cannot be acquired by agreement, the attorneys in the Civil Division represent the County in acquiring the property by eminent domain proceedings.\n\nIn addition to property acquisitions, the attorneys with the Civil Division review and approve subdivision plats for accuracy and compliance with state laws and the County’s ordinances. The attorneys prepare leases and conveyances for County owned property and property leased by Montgomery County. Attorneys in the Civil Division prepare and review agreements between Montgomery County and other political subdivisions such as cities, road districts and drainage districts to expand roadways or governmental services. The attorneys prepare and review easements, right-of-ways, dedication instruments, deeds and other documents by which the County acquires or uses real estate. The Civil Division attorneys also enforce the flood plain regulations and pursue environmental health nuisance abatements, and building & septic permit violations. The attorneys work closely with the County Engineer’s department in seeking compliance with standards for construction of roads and in bringing roads into the County road maintenance system.\n\nThe Civil Division attorneys also work with County officials regarding specific County projects and related entities such as the Mental Health Treatment Facility and the Montgomery County Toll Road Authority.\n\nCHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES\n\nThe Child Protective Services (“CPS”) Section of the Montgomery County Attorney’s Office is committed to ensuring the protection of our most vulnerable citizens, the children of Montgomery County. The attorneys serve as legal advisors to the local Texas Department of Family & Protective Services (TDFPS) office and provide civil legal litigation services every day. The CPS section attorneys are highly involved in all aspects of a CPS case, from the filing of the paperwork necessary to remove a child from an unsafe environment, to attending hearings, trials, mediation, depositions, answering and responding to discovery, and multiple meetings with caseworkers and experts in preparation of going to Court. Timely filed pleadings and hearings are extremely important as failure to do so could result in an abused child not being removed from an abusive situation as soon as possible.\n\nThe number one priority of the CPS section is to act in the best interest of the children. The CPS section team works closely with the local TDFPS to jointly detect, investigate, and prosecute offending parties that have engaged in the abuse of a child. When a case is initiated, the CPS team closely monitors the offending party to ensure that they are in compliance with the required services and assistance that the TDFPS requires. Compliance monitoring is important as failure to closely monitor compliance could result in a child being returned home where abuse is likely to continue or even escalate. Every child deserves to be raised in a home with love, understanding, patience, and security."
