        "text": "Hearings in court – commonly used words\n\nGeneral Legal Terms\n\nAdjournment: When a hearing is delayed until a later date. An adjournment will not automatically be granted.\n\nAffidavit: A written statement of facts made under oath or affirmed before a notary public, justice of the peace, lawyer or other authorised officer. An affidavit can be used to support an application or can be used as evidence in court.\n\nAffirmation: To confirm a legal decision, particularly (of an appeal court) to confirm a judgment made in a lower court.\n\nAlternative dispute resolution: Various methods of resolving civil disputes otherwise than through the normal trial process. The court will encourage the parties to use an alternative dispute resolution procedure if the court considers this appropriate and should facilitate the use of such procedures.\n\nAppearance: Coming to the court as a party, either in person or through a representative (i.e. a barrister). The judge will often state “I will take appearances” at the start of a hearing. The word “appearance” may also refer to a Notice of Intention to Defend (see below).\n\nArbitration: In arbitration, a dispute between two or more people will be decided by an impartial third party (called an arbitrator). Arbitration occurs outside the court process but is still binding on the parties. Arbitration may be agreed to by the parties, may be required by a provision in a contract for settling disputes, or may be provided for under statute.\n\nBarrister: A legal practitioner specialising in court work, admitted to plead at the Bar.\n\nCause of action: A cause of action is the “legal wrong” that entitles a party brings a case to court, e.g. negligence, breach of contract, defamation. Without a cause of action you should not commence a court case because you cannot be successful.\n\nCallover: A court procedure which involves numerous cases being listed before a judge or registrar and each being given a chance to advise the court of the progress of the case. As part of this process, the names of the parties involved in the case are called out. Those parties are then able to directly address the judge or registrar. It is then up to the judge or registrar to determine whether the case is ready for hearing and to provide parties with a hearing date.\n\nCivil law: A broad division of the law that encompasses, among other things, the law governing business, contracts, estates, domestic (family) relations, accidents, negligence. Civil law is to be distinguished from criminal law (see below).\n\nConciliation: A process where an independent person meets with parties to a dispute in an attempt to assist in them coming to an agreement. The outcomes of a conciliation process will not be legally binding on the parties.\n\nContempt of court: Contempt of court is an offence resulting out of disturbance to the orderly administration of justice. Contempt typically occurs in one of two ways:\n\nWhere a person is rude or disrespectful to a judge or causes a disturbance in the courtroom;\n\nWhere a party wilfully fails to obey an order of the court.\n\nCosts: The legal fees or expenses of a party to matter in the court. A court may order one party to pay all or part the costs of another party.\n\nCosts order: When you engage a solicitor, you pay for their services in the same way that you pay for a plumber’s or computer repairer’s services. When the legal work includes litigation – taking or defending court action – then legal costs can be substantial, because there are many steps involved such as drafting the court documents, disclosing evidence and then the costs of the trial. In our legal system, the usual rule is that “costs follow the event” which means that the losing party pays the costs of the winning party. The law gives the judge the power to decide and order which party pays the costs, and judges can order a party that delays court proceedings or who unduly increases costs to pay them.\n\nCourt: A body established by law for the administration of justice by judges or magistrates.\n\nDamages: Monetary compensation ordered by a court in response to a wrong committed by one party against another.\n\nDebt or liquidated demand: A liquidated demand is a claim for a fixed amount, usually under a contract.\n\nDeclaration: A written statement made a person (the declarant). If the statement contained in a declaration is knowingly false, the declarant may be liable to punishment for perjury.\n\nDefence: The case presented by or on behalf of the party being accused of a crime or sued in a civil lawsuit.\n\nDefendant: The party sued in a civil lawsuit or the charged with a crime. In some types of cases (such as divorce proceedings) a defendant may be called a respondent.\n\nDefault judgment: A judgment that a court makes when a defendant who has been properly served with a claim and statement of claim fails to file a notice of intention to defend and a defence within 20 days.\n\nDirections: Instructions given by a judge before the trial or hearing to assist the parties to properly prepare for the hearing.\n\nDisclosure: The process by which parties to civil litigation are required to provide the other party access to any documents that may be relevant to the particular case.\n\nDiscontinuance: Occurs when a party who has started legal proceedings elects to abandon proceedings.\n\nEvidence material: Evidence material, such as the statements of witnesses or contents of documents, that can be used by a party to support a claim made in court.
