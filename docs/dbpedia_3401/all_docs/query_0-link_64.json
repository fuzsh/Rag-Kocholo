        "text": "Judge Carmen E. Bosch has been a judge since 2003, first as a District Judge and then as a Circuit Judge, the position she now holds. Judge Bosch is the Senior Family Court Judge in Baldwin County, hearing primarily Divorce and Juvenile matters.\n\nJudge Bosch is a graduate of the University of South Alabama, where she earned a BS degree (1988) and the University of Alabama School of Law, where she earned a JD degree (1992). She practiced law in Covington County for a year, and was then employed as an Assistant District Attorney from 1993-2002 in Baldwin County.\n\nJudge Bosch was raised in Baldwin County, and has supported local civic ventures since returning to the area in 1993. She is a member of the Foley Rotary Club, a Past President of the Fairhope Kiwanis Club, a Past President of the Baldwin County Chapter of the University of Alabama Alumni, and an active volunteer with Distinguished Young Women of Baldwin County (formerly Junior Miss).\n\nJudge Bosch’s dedication to young people is also at the heart of her professional accomplishments as Juvenile Judge. Since becoming the Juvenile Judge in 2003, she has worked together with the Baldwin County Commission and the Alabama Department of Youth Services to open local residential programs for boys and girls at Camp Horizon in north Baldwin County, so that young people in need of correctional and rehabilitative services may remain in the area to work toward success. She has also worked through the Juvenile Probation Office to create a mentoring program for court-involved youth in conjunction with Youth Advocate Programs. Judge Bosch has also served as the President of the Alabama Juvenile and Family Court Judges’ Association."
