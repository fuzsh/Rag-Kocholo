        "text": "Felony First Appearance Hearings (FFAH)\n\nPretrial Court Officers present bond assessments that provide background information about the defendants. Using the bond assessments and information from state and national crime databases, the Court Officers provide the Court with personal and criminal history information. They then make recommendations for an Unsecured Judicial Release (UJR) for some defendants to be released from custody and placed under the supervision of Pretrial Services or UJR through the Jail.\n\nFelony First Appearance Hearings are scheduled Monday through Saturday. After a person is arrested, and within seventy-two hours, a person must go before a judge at a hearing known as a First Appearance Hearing. The purpose of a first appearance hearing is to notify an arrested person of the charge(s) being brought against them. Also, the judge will consider bail and whether to impose any conditions of release. If the judge is not authorized to set bail or declines to set bail, the defendant will be notified. The defendant will be provided information regarding the right to legal representation and how to apply for the assistance of appointed counsel if financially unable to hire an attorney. The judge will not consider the dismissal of any of the charges at this hearing and the defendant will not be asked any questions about the facts of the case.\n\nState Expedited Accusations Calendar (SEA)\n\nThe Pretrial Court Officers review the defendant’s bond assessment and their criminal history from the state and national crime databases with the judge, along with the prosecuting and defense attorneys, so that the judge can make an informed decision for a bond. In addition, the Court Officers make recommendations for Unsecured Judicial Release (UJR) for some defendants to be released from custody and placed under the supervision of Pretrial Services or UJR through the Jail.\n\nState Expedited Accusations Calendars are scheduled Monday through Saturday. After a person is arrested and within seventy-two hours, that person must go before a judge at a hearing known as a First Appearance Hearing. The Solicitor General’s Office accuses these cases before the hearing. The purpose of the State Expedited Accusations Calendar is to notify an arrested person of the charge(s) being brought against them. Also, the judge will consider bail and whether to impose any conditions of release. If the judge is not authorized to set bail or declines to set bail, the defendant will be notified. The defendant will be provided information regarding the right to legal representation and how to apply for the assistance of appointed counsel if financially unable to hire an attorney. The judge will not consider the dismissal of any of the charges at this hearing. The defendant will not be asked any questions about the facts of the case.\n\nPreliminary Hearings\n\nPretrial Court Services provides detailed criminal history information, conducts status research, and makes release recommendations as requested. In addition, the Court Officer is responsible for interviewing defendants the judge decides to release them to Pretrial Services.\n\nThe purpose of a preliminary hearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason (probable cause) to believe the defendant committed the crime(s) alleged in the warrant(s) that have been issued against the defendant. If probable cause exists, the case is sent to either the Complex or Non-Complex Division of Superior Court. This court does not determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Defendants are entitled to be represented by a private attorney of their choosing or may be represented by an attorney from Public Defender's Office. The judge may also reconsider the defendant's bond, as appropriate.\n\nState All-Purpose Hearings\n\nPretrial Court Services provides detailed criminal history information, conducts status research, and makes release recommendations. The Court Officer is also responsible for interviewing defendants the judge decides to release them to Pretrial Services.\n\nThe purpose of the State All-Purpose Hearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason (probable cause) to believe the defendant committed the crime(s) alleged in the warrant(s) that have been issued against the defendant. If probable cause exists the case is sent to State Court. Defendants are entitled to be represented by a private attorney of their choosing or may be represented by an attorney from the Public Defender's Office. The judge may also reconsider the defendant's bond, as appropriate.\n\nNon-Complex Case Hearings\n\nFor all of these hearings, Pretrial Court Services provides detailed criminal history information, conducts status research, and makes release recommendations. The Court Officer is also responsible for interviewing defendants the judge decides to release them to Pretrial Services.\n\nCases that are accused or indicted are randomly assigned to a judge within the NonComplex Division. In these hearings, the defendant is informed of his/her charges, and the parties are prepared to discuss discovery issues and expected motions practice. Each defendant will receive and acknowledge in open court written notice of his/her next court date before being excused by the Court. This written notice will be filed with the Clerk’s office. Unless excused by the Court, all defendants must appear at all calendar calls and hearing dates even if the defendant’s attorney has a properly filed conflict letter, leave of absence, or other excused absence. Please note that failure to appear will result in forfeiture of any bond and a bench warrant will be issued for the defendant.\n\nComplex Case Hearings\n\nPretrial Court Officers gather all pertinent information and report to the Judge. The Court Officer is also responsible for interviewing defendants the judge decides to release them to Pretrial Services.\n\nComplex cases are assigned to a sitting judge (elected judge) in Superior Court. Sometimes the judge needs updated information on defendants who are not in custody. This information may be for one or two defendants or it may be for everyone on a particular calendar. If a defendant has not yet been sentenced and is still in the Fulton County Jail because they have not yet made a bond, the judge may want to review their bond and/or the possibility of the defendant being released on an Unsecured Judicial Release.\n\nBond Hearings\n\nThe Pretrial Court Officers review the defendant’s bond assessment and their criminal history from the state and national crime databases with the judge, along with the prosecution and defense attorneys, so that the judge can make an informed decision for a bond. Bonds are reviewed for defendants who are still in jail because they have not made bail. In addition, the Court Officers make recommendations for Unsecured Judicial Release (UJR) for some defendants to be released from custody and placed under the supervision of Pretrial Services or UJR through the Jail.\n\nMisdemeanor Mental Health Court\n\nThe Misdemeanor Mental Health Court is a voluntary court program to divert and support eligible misdemeanor citizen-defendants with mental health concerns who are arrested. As Justice Partners, we recognize our duty to:\n\nProtect public safety through intensive supervision by the courts;\n\nReduce the incarceration and recidivism of individuals with serious mental illness;\n\nLink mentally ill persons with needed mental health services;\n\nExpect participants to adhere to all program conditions and requirements;\n\nImprove the likelihood of ongoing success with treatment, access to housing or shelter, and connections with critical supports for the mentally ill.\n\nWarrant Application Hearings\n\nAt the warrant application hearing, the judge will decide whether there is enough evidence to make an arrest. If the judge finds that probable cause exists, the warrant may be issued at the hearing. If the judge issues a warrant for an individual in the courtroom and decides to release them to Pretrial Services, the Pretrial Court Officer is also responsible for interviewing the defendant.\n\nAn individual who believes he/she has been a victim of a crime, and the police have not taken an arrest warrant for the accused, may file a complaint requesting a warrant for the arrest of another person. File the warrant application at 136 Pryor Street, Suite C-103 Atlanta, GA 30303. Please see the Magistrate Court website for filing procedures (https://www.magistratefulton.org/).\n\nTraffic Court (Traffic Violations Bureau)\n\nJust as criminal histories are presented in criminal hearings, Pretrial Court Officers provide driving histories so the judge can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Traffic Violations Bureau processes traffic citations issued by law enforcement officers around Fulton County. Traffic Court is held downtown at 136 Pryor Street on the 1st and 3rd Tuesday of the month. In addition, Traffic Court is also held at the Fulton County North and South Annexes. Please see the Traffic Court website for more information (https://fultonstate.org/traffic-citations/).\n\nEnvironmental Court\n\nEnvironmental Court is designed to adjudicate cases concerning animal welfare charges, ordinance violations, property maintenance, charges environmental, and MARTA violations. If requested by the judge, the Pretrial Court Officer presents the defendant’s criminal history from the state and national crime databases. Should the judge issue a warrant for the defendant in court and release them to Pretrial Services, the Pretrial Court Officer is also responsible for interviewing the defendant.\n\nCopy of Charges Calendar\n\nThe Copy of Charges Calendar adjudicates cases for which an individual was issued a citation (not a traffic citation) to appear in court. If requested by the judge, the Pretrial Court Officer presents the defendant’s criminal history from the state and national crime databases. Should the judge issue a warrant for the defendant in court and release them to Pretrial Services, the Pretrial Court Officer is also responsible for interviewing the defendant.\n\nContact Staff:\n\nPretrial Court Services Unit Management Staff Directory\n\nValerie B.
