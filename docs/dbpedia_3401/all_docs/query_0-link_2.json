        "text": "a. Screening\n\nThe first set of tasks through which judicial assistants may wield influence is found in a screening duty, for instance regarding the selection of cases to be reviewed by a court. Many higher and/or constitutional courts have systems of discretionary review, granting only small percentages of requests for review. For example, the US Supreme Court only grants 1–2% of all requests for review, and the German Federal Constitutional Court similarly only accepts about 2–3%. With the enormous load of petitions for review, memos (or reports) prepared by assistants are indispensable for handling these requests. In a survey (N = 133) conducted by Ward and Weiden, former US Supreme Court law clerks self-reported this stage as the one in which they are most influential.\n\nThe process of selecting cases for judicial review at the US Supreme Court (also known as ‘examining to grant or reject writs of certiorari’) has been studied extensively. Stras examined the agreement of Supreme Court Justices with the proposed way of handling petitions for certiorari (requests for review) by the law clerks in four different years. He found the level of agreement to be 98 to 99% in all decisions to grant or deny a petition for certiorari, depending on the year, and the level of agreement in granted cases was 66–74%, depending on the year. Building on the work of Stras, Black and Boyd also found influence of the certiorari memo on judges’ voting when controlling for the judges’ likely action in the absence of a clerk’s advice. Additionally, they found that the greater the distance was between the political attitudes of a judge and the clerk who wrote the certiorari memo, the smaller the likelihood was of the judge following the recommendations of the clerk.\n\nMany lower courts (and also some highest courts, such as the Dutch Supreme Court) do not have a system of discretionary review. Hence, judicial assistants in these courts do not participate in selecting cases for review. However, when a case is filed at these courts, various other screening decisions must be made, such as whether a case is referred to a specialised court and whether it will be handled by a single judge, a jury or a judicial panel. Through these screening decisions, judicial assistants can indirectly influence the manner in which cases are handled by the court, e.g. by determining how much time the court takes to hear a case or by deciding how many judges are involved in the decision making.\n\nThus, several studies indicate that screening influences judicial decision making at the US Supreme Court. There are indications that screening also occurs at other courts, but sound empirical evidence for influence on the outcome of cases in those settings is lacking.\n\nc. Preparing bench memos\n\nA third duty through which judicial assistants can wield influence is by assisting judges in their preparations for hearing a case. Various US states’ high court judges note that conducting research on the case records and on the law is the most important task of judicial assistants. Documents in which judicial assistants report their findings of this research are in the US commonly referred to as ‘bench memoranda’. Various judges qualify these memos as ‘a roadmap to the case’. Some memos mainly summarise the legal facts of a case, whereas others include suggestions for questions to ask during a hearing, advice on how to handle the procedural aspects of a case and/or advice on how to decide a case.\n\nResearch on cognitive heuristics and biases in (judicial) decision making has revealed that judges are influenced by information that is presented to them prior to a hearing even if that information is completely irrelevant to the outcome of a case. Holvast argues that a bench memo can also function as an anchor (a, sometimes unconscious reference point for the judgment) in the decision making of the judge. The extent to which this occurs depends on how the bench memo is used. An anchoring effect is particularly expected when the memo is used as a roadmap for understanding the case. Cohen, who studied the interaction between US appellate judges and their clerks, makes a distinction between judges who are front-loaders and those that are back-loaders. Front-loaders are highly involved in the preparations of the bench memo. Conversely, back-loaders characteristically get truly involved in cases only after the oral argument and thus rely predominantly on the bench memo for the preparation of the oral argument. In a study on Dutch district judges, Holvast finds that some judges can – at times – be classified as front-loaders. Judges mentioned that they occasionally consciously decided to first read the court files before reading the memo to avoid becoming biased. Yet, most respondents fell into the category of back-loaders. They started their preparation with reading the memo, using it as a roadmap for reading the case files.\n\nStudying the influence of judicial assistants via bench memos is challenging as these memos are generally not made public. An exception are the memos written by law clerks of Justice Blackmun, who, after his retirement from the bench, opened his archive to the public. In a small sample of 40 of Blackmun’s cases, Johnson, Stras and Black examined whether the questions that law clerks proposed to ask during the oral argument in their bench memos were asked by Justice Blackmun. Of all 230 proposed questions, the justice had asked 94 (40.9%). He only occasionally added additional questions of his own. This small sample suggests that judges (or at least this judge) use the bench memo to prepare for a hearing and that their behaviour during a hearing might be influenced by it.\n\nThus, judges self-report that they use bench memos as ‘roadmaps to cases’. The research on bench memo usage by Justice Blackmun also suggests that memos influence judges’ behaviour in court. Yet, a systematic test of the prevailing idea that bench memos influence judges’ decisions is lacking.\n\nd. Drafting judgments/opinions\n\nProbably the most controversial duty of judicial assistants is their role as drafters of judicial decisions and opinions. It has become common practice for judges in different jurisdictions (e.g. US, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland) to delegate to their judicial assistants the duty of writing a first draft. Two large surveys conducted by Peppers, Giles and Tainer-Parkins found that, respectively, 97.4% of US federal district judges and 94.9% of US federal appellate court judges delegate the drafting of judicial opinions. In Holvast’s study on Dutch district courts, all of the 62 studied judgments had been drafted by an assistant. However, this delegation is not common practice in all courts. In some jurisdictions it appears to be considered improper to do so.\n\nRosenthal and Yoon as well as Carlson, Livermore and Rockmore studied the writing style of large numbers of judicial opinions by US Supreme Court Justices spanning the entire history of the Supreme Court. They found that the writing style of judicial opinions varied more as the number of law clerks that justices had at their disposal grew. This variation in writing style indicates that opinions have multiple authors, thereby suggesting that justices delegate at least parts of the opinion writing to their clerks. Similar results were found by Bodwin, Rosenthal and Yoon in a study on the Canadian Supreme Court. However, the fact that judicial assistants prepare a first draft of a judgment does not automatically imply that they also influence the outcome of cases.\n\nThe extent to which judicial assistants wield influence through the drafting of judgments also depends on the interaction between judges and their assistants during the writing process. Do judges, for instance, provide detailed instructions for writing the draft? And/or do they drastically revise the first draft of an assistant, turning it truly into their own judgment? Holvast showed that Dutch district court judges differ greatly in how much instruction they provide to judicial assistants and how much they revise their drafts. Ward and Weiden distinguish the following three types of opinion writing at the US Supreme Court: 1) retention – the justice writes the opinion, and the clerk provides citations, footnotes and editing; 2) collaboration – the justice and clerk work in a tandem towards the constitution of a single opinion; 3) delegation – the justice delegates the task of writing the opinion to the clerk and revises the draft. In their study from 2006, Ward and Weiden find that delegation has surpassed retention in being the most common way of drafting opinions at the US Supreme Court. This suggests that by taking the lead in drafting opinions the opportunities for assistants to influence the opinions have increased.\n\nHence, in various jurisdictions, assistants seem to have important responsibilities in drafting judgments or opinions. It is expected that drafting judgments influences the content thereof. Research reveals that the writing style does seem to be affected by the involvement of assistants in drafting judgments or opinions. However, whether the drafting also affects the outcome of court cases is currently unstudied.\n\ne. The overall influence of judicial assistants\n\nSeveral surveys among judges and/or judicial assistants focus on the perceived overall influence of judicial assistants on the outcome of court cases. Swanson and Wasby conducted a survey among US state high court judges (N = 81), in which most judges reported that law clerks influence adjudication: 28.4% of judges consider law clerks’ influence to be important/substantial, 49.4% reported some/moderate influence, 11.1% a little and 4.9% none. Swanson and Wasby (2008) also asked in what percentage of cases the judicial assistant changed the judge’s views on the outcome of a case. Most judges reported that judicial assistants had at some point changed their views (12.9% said the clerks never changed their views). The average mentioned percentage of cases in which they changed their views is 10%. In a survey among former US Supreme Court clerks (N = 123) by Ward and Weiden, 24% reported that they sometimes changed their judges’ minds about a particular case or issue.\n\nThere is also some indirect evidence that law clerks influence the outcome of judicial decisions that is not based on judges’ perceptions. Drawing on a survey of the political ideology of 532 former Supreme Court law clerks, Peppers and Zorn studied the influence of clerks on voting on the merits of a case by taking into account the political attitudes of both the law clerks and the judges. They found an independent effect of the political attitude of the law clerk on the votes of the justice, which is about one-third to one-half of the effect of the judges’ political attitudes. Also focusing on the influence of the political ideology of US Supreme Court law clerks, Bonica, Chilton, Goldin, Rozema and Sen provide evidence for a modest effect of clerks’ ideology on justices voting on cases. They found that ‘replacing a judicial chambers composed of the justice’s annual set of most liberal clerks with a judicial chambers composed of the justice’s annual set of the conservative clerks would result in a 4% increase in the number of conservative votes by the justice during the term’. This influence, however, varies per case and is larger when it concerns high profile and legally significant cases.\n\nThis means that there is some evidence that assistants influence judicial decisions. However, this evidence is either based on judges’ self-reporting or derived indirectly from the impact of the political attitude of the assistant. What is missing, is a direct assessment of assistants’ influence that is independent from the self-reporting of judges and does not derive from the assistant’s political attitude.\n\nAlthough sound evidence is scarce, the existing research provides various indications that judicial assistants may wield influence on adjudication via a multitude of duties. Based on these findings we test the role and influence of judicial assistants in adjudication in three consecutive steps. In the first step, we distinguish the involvement that judges report assistants to have via performing their universal duties. However, the reported involvement in these different duties does not reveal the influence of assistants on the outcome of court cases. This is why, in step 2, we measure the extent to which judges attribute influence to assistants in a concrete court case. However, since the measurement in step 2 is based on self-reported influence, the results may be distorted by judges’ ideas regarding the level of influence they deem appropriate. Furthermore, it does not capture influences of which judges are not self-aware. For this reason, in step 3, we measure the influence by means of an experiment in which we test the influence of bench memos on the judges’ decision.\n\nMeasurement\n\nJudicial assistants’ role in adjudication was measured in three steps. First, we measured the involvement that judges attribute to judicial assistants in performing different duties that are related to the decision making process. In the survey, judges were asked about nine different aspects of their duties. Given that sound boarding is the most varied duty, four of the questions relate to that duty. Preparing bench memos and drafting judgments are more straightforward duties. Hence, only two questions relate to the duty of preparing bench memos and three to the duty of drafting judgments. No questions were included to measure the screening duty as most judges are not involved in the screening of cases and, therefore, cannot report on judicial assistants’ influence in this part of the decision making process. Each question consisted of a statement on the perceived judicial assistant’s involvement. Judges had to indicate the percentage of their cases in which that type of involvement actually occurred. The percentages were divided into the following five categories: 1) 0–20%, 2) 21–40%, 3) 41–60%, 4) 61–80% and 5) 81–100%.\n\nSecond, the overall influence that judges attribute to assistants in the outcome of a concrete court case was measured. Judges were asked to recall a recent court case in which they had collaborated with a judicial assistant and to report the extent to which the assistant had contributed to the outcome of the court case. The answer categories were the following: 1) ‘none’, 2) ‘very inconsiderable’, 3) ‘inconsiderable’, 4) ‘considerable’ and 5) ‘very considerable’. The court cases vary in content and pertain, for example, to family reunion, real estate appraisal, denial of social welfare payments and the licensing of electric vehicle charging posts.\n\nThird, the extent to which judges’ decisions are influenced by judicial assistants’ bench memos was measured. Judges were asked to read one of three versions of a fictional but realistic court case and bench memo and to determine an outcome for the case. The bench memos were composed in collaboration with an experienced administrative law judge and judicial assistant. With their input, we created a vignette that offered a certain amount of discretion on how to judge the case.\n\nThe court case for this experiment concerned a preliminary injunction case regarding an eviction order of a mother with three children by a mayor because drugs were found in the woman’s home. A preliminary injunction case was selected as, in those cases, judges have to reach a decision that is important for the civil litigant in a short amount of time and based on relatively little information. Such cases are well suited for a survey which aims to include a short but realistic case. The case description was identical in all versions, but the input of the judicial assistant via the bench memo was manipulated. In one version, the control version, no bench memo was included. In the two other versions the judicial assistant either provided suggestions to uphold the mayor’s decision to evict the family from their home or to suspend the mayor’s decision by imposing a preliminary injunction. This was established by emphasising different elements of the case in the two memos. These elements strengthened the argument to either uphold or to suspend the mayor’s decision. We decided to contrast the versions on these more subtle aspects rather than have assistants give concrete recommendations to the judge about what to decide in the memo because the latter is not common in practice. Furthermore, judges were aware of the subject of the survey. We wanted to prevent them from adjusting their behaviour by, for instance, altering their judgment in order to avoid the appearance of being influenced by the assistant. Therefore, a randomiser in the online survey program Qualtrics was used to assign respondents to one of the three versions of the vignette. In total, 30.4% of the judges responded to the version of the vignette that did not contain a bench memo, 38.0% responded to the version wherein the judicial assistant suggested to suspend the municipality’s decision to evict the family and 31.6% responded to the version wherein the judicial assistant suggested to uphold the municipality’s decision to evict the family. Respondents were asked: ‘How likely is it that you would suspend the decision of the mayor to evict the mother and her children from their home?’ The answer categories ranged from 1 to 10.\n\nEven though respondents were randomly assigned to one of the three versions, we included several control variables in the analysis due to the modest size of the sample. Without these controls, the outcome of the judicial decisions might have been affected by differences between the categories of judges who responded to the three versions. In a preliminary analysis, we controlled for a substantial number of factors that have been linked to the influence of judicial assistants on judicial decision making in previous research. As we describe in a separate article, these factors pertain either to judges’ perceived risks of involving judicial assistants in judicial decision making or to contextual factors. In the final analysis, we included only the control variables that correlated significantly with judges’ decisions about the vignette and excluded those that did not correlate significantly with their decisions. In the following, we report how we measured the control variables which we included in the final analysis.\n\nThe first control variable pertains to the perceived risks and benefits accompanied by involving judicial assistants in the decision making process. This variable was included based on the expectation that assistants have more influence on judges’ decisions when judges are more convinced that the benefits of involving assistants in the decision making process outweigh the risks of doing so. Respondents were asked, for instance, whether the contribution of judicial assistants to judicial decision making ‘Harms the reputation of the judiciary’, ‘Enables the judge to focus on his/her core tasks’ or ‘Dilutes the ultimate responsibility of the judge for decision making’. This risk-benefit perception was measured with nine Likert items, with answer categories ranging from ‘disagree strongly’ to ‘agree strongly’. Together they constitute a reliable scale (Cronbach’s α = 0.70).\n\nThe second control variable concerns a rule-of-law role orientation. This variable captures a role orientation by judges in which they consider judges to be the personification of the judiciary – the adjudicative branch of government. Judges who adhere to this role orientation emphasise that judges are entrusted to adjudicate due to the unique safeguards related to their function which assure their independence, impartiality, integrity and competence. This control variable was included due to our expectation that the more judges have internalised a rule-of-law role orientation, the less influence they will allow judicial assistants in the decision making process given that the latter do not possess the same level of training and safeguards as judges do. The rule-of-law role orientation is measured with eight Likert items with the following answer categories: 1) ‘disagree strongly’, 2) ‘disagree’, 3) ‘neither disagree nor agree’, 4) ‘agree’, 5) ‘agree strongly’ and 6) ‘don’t know’. Examples of the items measuring the rule-of-law role orientation are ‘The use of algorithms in judicial decision making jeopardises the quality of the judiciary’, ‘Politicians interfere too much with individual court cases’ and ‘Judgment by lay people is undesirable because it undermines the quality of the judiciary’. The reliability of the scale for the rule-of-law role orientation is sufficient (Cronbach’s α = 0.69).\n\nThe last control variable concerns the courts in which respondents were employed. This characteristic may affect the influence of judicial assistants because of differences in interaction patterns between assistants and judges in the various courts. Employment in the different courts was categorised as follows: 1) Amsterdam (13.2%), 2) Gelderland/Overijssel (25.0%), 3) Limburg/East-Brabant/Zeeland-West-Brabant (6.6%), 4) Middle-Netherlands (14.5%), 5) North-Holland/North Netherlands (21.1%) and 6) Rotterdam (19.7%)."
