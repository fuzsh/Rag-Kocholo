        "text": "A priceless collection of Kahlil Gibran most notable works including 37 original illustrations. Books included in this collection:\n\nThe Prophet\n\nThe Madman\n\nSand and Foam\n\nThe Broken Wings\n\nA Tear and a Smile\n\nTwenty Drawings\n\nThe Forerunner\n\nSpirits Rebellious\n\nKahlil Gibran is the third-best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.\n\nKahlil Gibran was a Lebanese author, philosopher, poet and artist.\n\nThough he considered himself to be mainly a painter, lived most of his life in the United States, and wrote his best-known works in English, Kahlil Gibran was the key figure in a Romantic movement that transformed Arabic literature in the first half of the twentieth century. Educated in Beirut, Boston, and Paris, Gibran was influenced by the European modernists of the late nineteenth century. His early works were sketches, short stories, poems, and prose poems written in simple language for Arabic newspapers in the United States. In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero."
