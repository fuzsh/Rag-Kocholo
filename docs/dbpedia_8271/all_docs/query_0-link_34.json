        "text": "Kahlil Gibran was a Lebanese-American writer and poet. Even though Gibran was considered a literary and political rebel, his works are still celebrated throughout the world. Gibran’s most famous work is The Prophet.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nKhalil Gibran (January 6, 1883 – April 10, 1931) was a Lebanese-American artist, poet, and writer of the New York Pen League. Born in the town of Bsharri in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Ottoman Empire (north of modern-day Lebanon), as a young man he immigrated with his family to the United States, where he studied art and began his literary career, writing in both English and Arabic. In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero. He is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book The Prophet, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose.\n\n\"About this title\" may belong to another edition of this title."
