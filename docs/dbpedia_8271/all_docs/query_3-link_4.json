        "text": "Suddenly I SeeKT Tunstall\n\nKT Tunstall's \"Suddenly I See\" was inspired by Robert Mapplethorpe's photograph of Patti Smith on the cover of her album Horses.\n\nKung Fu FightingCarl Douglas\n\nKung Fu was big in 1974, with movies by Bruce Lee and a TV series called Kung Fu. Carl Douglas brought it to the dance floor that year with \"Kung Fu Fighting,\" a #1 hit.\n\nHeroesDavid Bowie\n\nDavid Bowie's \"Heroes\" was about his producer Tony Visconti and his girlfriend, but Bowie didn't admit this until the '00s, since Visconti was married at the time.\n\nO.P.P.Naughty by Nature\n\nThe Naughty by Nature hit \"O.P.P.\" doesn't have any curse words, but many oversensitive radio stations played a \"clean\" version with the word \"kitten\" edited out, surely the first time that word was censured.\n\nGangnam StylePsy\n\nYouTube were forced into an upgrade after PSY's \"Gangnam Style\" broke the video-sharing website's hit counter. Once the tune reached 2,147,483,647 views, the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing, the view-counter could no longer work.\n\nDisco LadyJohnnie Taylor\n\nEven though Johnnie Taylor's \"Disco Lady\" was the first US #1 with the word \"disco\" in its title, it wasn't a disco tune. He was just singing about disco.\n\nStrange MagneticsSong Writing\n\nHow Bing Crosby, Les Paul, a US Army Signal Corps Officer, and the Nazis helped shape rock and Roll.\n\nMovie Stars In Music VideosSong Writing\n\nJohnny Depp, Angelina Jolie, Mila Kunis and John Malkovich are just a few of the film stars who have moonlighted in music videos.\n\nDeconstructing Doors Songs With The Author Of The Doors ExaminedSong Writing\n\nDoors expert Jim Cherry, author of The Doors Examined, talks about some of their defining songs and exposes some Jim Morrison myths.\n\nJesus Thinks You're a Jerk: Rock vs. TelevangelistsSong Writing\n\nWhen televangelists like Jimmy Swaggart took on rockers like Ozzy Osbourne and Metallica, the rockers retaliated. Bono could even be seen mocking the preachers.\n\nAmerican Hits With Foreign TitlesSong Writing\n\nWhat are the biggest US hits with French, Spanish (not \"Rico Suave\"), Italian, Scottish, Greek, and Japanese titles?"
