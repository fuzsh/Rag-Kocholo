For other uses, see The Broken Wing.\n\n1997 single by Martina McBride\n\n\"A Broken Wing\"Single by Martina McBridefrom the album Evolution B-sideValentine\"[1]ReleasedSeptember 8, 1997GenreLength3:35LabelRCA NashvilleSongwriter(s)Phil Barnhart, Sam Hogin, James HouseProducer(s)Paul Worley, Ed SeayMartina McBride singles chronologyMusic video\"A Broken Wing\" at CMT.com\n\n\"A Broken Wing\" is a song written by James House, Sam Hogin and Phil Barnhart, and recorded by American country music singer Martina McBride. It was released in September 1997 as the second single from McBride's album Evolution. In January 1998, \"A Broken Wing\" became McBride's second Number One single.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sheet music for the song is in the key of C major, though McBride sings in the key of B major in the studio recording and live performances. It has a 12\n\n8 time signature.[2] The verses use a chord progression of I–ii–IV–I three times, followed by I–ii7–IV–V–I; the refrain uses vi–iii7–ii7–I followed by I–ii7–IV–V–I.[2] Instrumentally, McBride's 1998 version features acoustic guitar, electric guitar, pedal steel guitar, piano, bass guitar and drums.\n\nContent\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the song, the narrator recounts a young woman escaping from an emotionally abusive relationship.[3] Regarding the second verse, wherein the husband finds \"a note by the window / and the curtains blowin' in the breeze,\" the authors of the book My Country Roots wrote the song's conclusion could be interpreted to indicate the woman either escaped or committed suicide.[4]\n\nProducer Paul Worley told Billboard magazine in 1998 the track, except for the backing vocals, was recorded in one day, while other tracks on the album were recorded in pieces over time.[5]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music video was directed by Robert Deaton III and George Flanigen IV, also collectively known as Deaton-Flanigen Productions. The video features McBride singing the song at the Croft House in the Nashville Zoo at Grassmere. Interspersed throughout the clip is a woman locked in an abusive relationship with her husband. While making dinner, the husband complains about the salad she made for him. Later, when the woman is on the phone, her husband interrupts the call. Eventually, the wife gets up out of the bed and the husband goes upstairs, only to find a note left by the disappeared wife.\n\nIt was nominated for Music Video of the Year at the 1998 Country Music Association awards.[6]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nBob Bailey – backing vocals\n\nJoe Chemay – bass guitar\n\nDan Dugmore – pedal steel guitar\n\nKim Fleming – backing vocals\n\nVicki Hampton – backing vocals\n\nDann Huff – electric guitar\n\nMartina McBride – lead and backing vocals, tambourine\n\nBiff Watson – acoustic guitar\n\nBilly Joe Walker Jr. – acoustic guitar\n\nLonnie Wilson – drums\n\nOther versions\n\n[edit]\n\nJordin Sparks covered the song on her 2007 EP Jordin Sparks.
