I had never heard of him before, but then again I wasn’t much aware of any authors from classical literature at that stage.\n\nOnce I started reading The Prophet and partaking in the wisdom of Almustafa’s words, I fell in love with the style of writing that Gibran had portrayed. This was many years ago.\n\nSince I started writing on Medium not too long ago, I felt it would be a good idea to revisit some of my earlier readings—the forerunners to my proficiency as a writer — and share my thoughts about those books in the form of casual reviews.\n\nI am not a critic by profession, and I am sure if a critic stumbles upon my reviews, they’ll be quick to reprimand me on the principles of criticism.\n\nBut that’s not my purpose. I intend to share my genuine conviction about the materials I have absorbed and hope that its voice finds listeners on a teeming platform such as Medium.\n\nSo, here goes.\n\nIn the Footsteps of Kahlil Gibran"
