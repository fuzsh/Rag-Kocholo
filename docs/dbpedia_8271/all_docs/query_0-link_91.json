        "meta_description": "Reading level: 12 - 16 years Publisher: Educational Book House Language: English ISBN-13: 9789937551403 \"The Broken Wings\" is a wonderful short story by Kahlil Gibran (1883 - 1931). Gibran was a Lebanese writer, poet, and visual artist best known for \"The Prophet\" (1923), a book of fables that has been translated into over 40 languages. Other notable works by this author include: \"Sand and Foam\" (1936), \"Mirrors of the Soul\" (1965), and \"The Beloved\" (1994). Contents include: \"Silent Sorrow\", \"The hand of Destiny\", \"Entrance to the Shrine\", \"The White Torch\", \"The Tempest\", \"The Lake of Fire\", \"Before the throne of Death\", \"Between Christ and Ishtar\", \"The Sacrifice\", \"The Rescuer\", etc. Many vintage books such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive. It is with this in mind that we are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially-commissioned new biography of the author.",
