        "text": "Introduction\n\nKahlil Gibran, Sufi Mystic, Poet, Artist and Philosopher was born in the hills of Lebanon amongst the famed cedar trees, Educated in both Lebanon and the west Gibran was able to absorb the best of both the Occident and the Orient.\n\nFeeling the suffocation of the Turkish Ottoman Earlier he found the west a more fertile ground that allowed his artistic talents to bloom and blossom into one of the most renowned writers of his time.\n\nHis various works are famous the world over. His thoughts relate to each and every age. His words of wisdom a salve to sooth the wounded and troubled soul.\n\nGibran saw most of his family members die at an early age from the ravages oftuberculosis and he personally suffered much sadness realising that all his family members had made sacrifices so that he might get the best education available.\n\nHis words move the reader's most inner soul and cause one to reflect in depth upon the mysteries of life. His prose and poetry contain the wisdom of the east expressed in the eloquence of the west. His art reflecting the innermost feelings of his soul.\n\nForeword\n\nI was eighteen years of age when love opened my eyes with its magic rays and touched my spirit for the first time with its fiery fingers, and Selma Karamy was the first woman who awakened my spirit with her beauty and led me into the garden of high affection, where days pass like dreams and nights like weddings.\n\nSelma Karamy was the one who taught me to worship beauty by the example of her own beauty and revealed to me the secret of love by her affection; she was the one who first sang to me the poetry of real life.\n\nEvery young man remembers his first love and tries to recapture that strange hour, the memory of which changes his deepest feeling and makes him so happy in spite of all the bitterness of its mystery.\n\nIn every young man's life there is a \"Selma\" who appears to him suddenly while in the spring of life and transforms his solitude into happy moments and fills the silence of his nights with music.\n\nI was deeply engrossed in thought and contemplation and seeking to understand the meaning of nature and the revelation of books and scriptures when I heard LOVE whispered into my ears through Selma's lips. My life was a coma, empty like that of Adam's in Paradise, when I saw Selma standing before me like a column of light. She was the Eve of my heart who filled it with secrets and wonders and made me understand the meaning of life.\n\nThe first Eve led Adam out of Paradise by her own will, while Selma made me enter willingly into the paradise of pure love and virtue by her sweetness and love; but what happened to the first man also happened to me, and the fiery sword which chased Adamout of Paradise was like the one which frightened me by its glittering edge and forced me away from the paradise of my love without having disobeyed any order or tasted the fruit of the forbidden tree.\n\nToday, after many years passed. I have nothing left out of that beautiful dream except painful memories flapping like invisible wings around me, filling the depths of my heart with sorrow, and bringing tears to my eyes; and my beloved, beautiful Selma is dead and nothing is left to commemorate her except my broken heart and a tomb surrounded by cypress trees. That tomb and this heart are all that is left to bear witness of Selma.\n\nThe silence that guards the tomb does not reveal God's secret in the obscurity of the coffin, and the rustling of the branches whose roots suck the body's elements do not tell the mysteries of the grave, but the agonized sighs of my heart announce to theliving the drama which love, beauty and death have performed.\n\nOh, friends of my youth who are scattered in the city of Beirut, when you pass by that cemetery near the pine forest, enter it silently and walk slowly so the tramping of your feet will not disturb the slumber of the dead, and stop humbly by Selma's tomb and greet the earth that encloses her corpse and mention my name with a deep sigh and say to yourself, \"Here, all the hopes of Gibran, who is living as a prisoner of love beyond the seas, were buried. On this spot he lost his happiness, drained his tears, and forgot his smile.\"\n\nBy that tomb grows Gibran's sorrow together with the cypress trees, and above the tomb his spirit flickers every night commemorating Selma joining the branches of the trees in sorrowful wailing, mourning and lamenting the going of Selma, who, yesterday, was a beautiful tune on the lips\n\n**Contents and Sample Pages**"
