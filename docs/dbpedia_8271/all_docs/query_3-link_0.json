It was released in June 1985 as the lead single from their second album Welcome to the Real World. The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1985, where it remained for two weeks. It was released as the band was just about to embark on a US tour opening for Tina Turner. \"Broken Wings\" became the first of two consecutive number ones of the band on the American charts, the other chart-topper being \"Kyrie\". Outside of the United States, \"Broken Wings\" topped the charts in Canada, peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium (Flanders), the Netherlands, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and West Germany, and the top twenty of the charts in Austria, New Zealand, Spain and Sweden.\n\nBackground and music\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ballad[2] was co-written with lyricist John Lang, who was inspired by Kahlil Gibran's novel Broken Wings.[3] The song is a mix of synth, digitally delayed guitar, bass and drums. The song's hissing intro was an effect created by the sound of a crash cymbal played in reverse.[3]\n\nAlthough the 1968 Beatles song \"Blackbird\" contains an identical lyric, \"Take these broken wings and learn to fly\", Richard Page has described this as \"a mindless unintentional reference\" attributable to both compositions being influenced by the Gibran novel.[4]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music video for \"Broken Wings\" was directed by Oley Sassone and filmed in black and white.[5] It features lead vocalist/bassist Richard Page driving through the desert in a classic Ford Thunderbird, the first allusion to birds. There is a scene where Page is sitting in a church when a Harris's Hawk flies in through the window and lands next to him on the pew and they exchange a gaze. The full band is also featured in performance scenes. Also appearing in the video are an unknown man and woman dancing tango. They are only shown from the waist down. At the end of the video Page is seen next to the Thunderbird with the vehicle's hood open.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nStereogum wrote about the song:[6]\n\nLyrically, \"Broken Wings\" is an attempt to keep a relationship together through the magic of flowery language: \"Take these broken wings/ And learn to fly again, learn to live so free/ When we hear the voices sing/ The book of love will open up and let us in.\" Those words are grandiloquent enough to be self-parody, but Page delivers them all perfectly straight-faced. He means every bit of it. In Page's mouth, the word \"take\" becomes a desperate animal yelp. I love it. I also love how overproduced \"Broken Wings\" is. The song is all ominous churn, and it never really kicks in. Instead, it captures a state of sustained anticipation.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\n7\" single[7]\n\n\"Broken Wings\" (single edit) – 4:29\n\n\"Uniform of Youth\" – 4:25\n\n12\" maxi single[7]\n\n\"Broken Wings\" (album version) – 5:45\n\n\"Uniform of Youth\" – 4:25\n\n\"Welcome to the Real World\" – 4:18\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications for \"Broken Wings\"\n\nK'Lee version\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand pop singer K'Lee covered \"Broken Wings\" and released it as a single on June 11, 2001.[45] Her version peaked at number two on the New Zealand Singles Chart, becoming her highest-charting single there along with 2002's \"Can You Feel Me?\"[46]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart performance for \"Broken Wings\" Chart (2001) Peak\n\nposition New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ)[46] 2\n\nSamples\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Broken Wings\" was sampled in the posthumous Tupac song \"Until the End of Time\".[47] The song reached No. 4 in the UK.[48]"
