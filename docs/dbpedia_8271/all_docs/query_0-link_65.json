        "text": "When I was a teenager, I had downloaded a free copy of Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet, but like the many books I have lying on my TBR, I never read it. I have never said anything like this before, but I am glad I didn’t read it then. I firmly believe that like the wand chooses the wizard, sometimes, the book chooses the reader. Some books just come to you at the right time. The Prophet is one of those books for me. I don’t know what I would have understood had I read it as a teenager, but when I read it now, I could connect to the book.\n\nOne of the most beautifully written and lyrical works, reading The Prophet is like meeting a part of yourself that you seem to have lost somewhere. Gibran, although a Christian, was influenced by Islam because of his fellow countrymen, which worked wonderfully for me, because I am quite inclined towards reading and understanding Islam in general. Not a religious book by any means, The Prophet in more spiritual in its essence, in that it gives the reader a deeper understanding of something simple, but it has so much clarity, meaning and truth to it that your perspective towards a bunch of things is bound to take a leap.\n\nConsidering where I am on my personal journey right now, The Prophet is a book I will henceforth hold dear and might even refer to here and there. The other works are just as amazing- if not more. Some of the lines from the poems and stories are going to stay with me for a long time to come. I am glad I waited to read Kahlil Gibran and I’m even more glad that the marvel has lived up to the expectations and hype surrounding it. I would definitely recommend this edition published by @srishtipub as you get a lot more than just The Prophet, it is easy to read and full of significance, it’s easily available in India and you’re bound to learn something new for sure."
