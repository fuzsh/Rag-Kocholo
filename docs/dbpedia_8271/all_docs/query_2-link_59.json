        "text": "Almustafa, the chosen and the beloved, who was a dawn onto his own day, had waited twelve years in the city of Orphalese for his ship that was to return and bear him back to the isle of his birth. – The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran\n\nThis sentence is the opening line of one of the most famous books in human history. Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet was published in 1923 and has sold more than 100 million copies.\n\nAlmustafa has lived in Orphalese long enough. He is a well-loved spiritual leader but he must sail back to his birthplace. However, his followers cannot let him go; they are too attached to him and hence, heartbroken.\n\nThe book turns into a series of questions from the crowd and answers from the prophet. Each chapter focuses on a particular topic: love, marriage, children, work, death, time, prayer, beauty, religion, laws, freedom, etc.\n\n“And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, “Speak to us of Children.”\n\nAnd he said:\n\nYour children are not your children.\n\nThey are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.\n\nThey come through you but not from you,\n\nAnd though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.\n\nYou may give them your love but not your thoughts.\n\nFor they have their own thoughts.\n\nYou may house their bodies but not their souls,\n\nFor their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.\n\nYou may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.\n\nFor life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.\n\nYou are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.\n\nThe archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.\n\nLet your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;\n\nFor even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.” – Chapter on Children, The Prophet, Khalil Gibran\n\nAlmustafa offers friendly and compassionate answers. He invites those present to explore their own hearts and souls to find truth. Once all the questions are answered, he says his final farewell.\n\nThe beauty of The Prophet is multifold. The writing style transports the mind to a place that transcends time and human beings’ limited understanding of anything spiritual. Considered as the epitomy of mysticism, the book provides pearls of wisdom on every page, as well as hope and comfort in times of sadness. The Prophet will change your conception of life and death.\n\nThis post is part of the “After the Fires of Day” Series, which celebrates the upcoming release of After the Fires of Day: Haiku Inspired by Kahlil Gibran & Alphonse de Lamartine."
