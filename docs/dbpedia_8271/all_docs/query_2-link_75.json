Although many critics thought Gibran’s poetry mediocre, The Prophet achieved cult status among American youth for several generations.\n\nGibran’s narrative frame relates that the Prophet, about to board a ship that will take him home after 12 years in a foreign city, is stopped by a group of the city’s inhabitants, who ask him to speak to them about the mysteries of life. He does so, discussing love, marriage, beauty, reason and passion, and death, among other topics."
