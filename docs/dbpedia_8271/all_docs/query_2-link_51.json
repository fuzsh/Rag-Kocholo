        "text": "“We can count on so few people to go that hard way with us,” the poet Adrienne Rich observed as she contemplated the art of honorable human relationships on the cusp of the Internet revolution that furnished the commodification of the word friend. “Ponder for a long time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship,” Seneca counseled two millennia earlier in his meditation on true and false friendship, “but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul.” But how does one refine the ponderation sieve through which one admits into one’s soul the few who count?\n\nPerched in time and sensibility between Seneca and Rich, the Lebanese-American poet, painter, and philosopher Kahlil Gibran (January 6, 1883–April 10, 1931) examined this question in a few short, exquisitely insightful verses from The Prophet (public library) — the 1923 classic that also gave us Gibran on the courage to weather the uncertainties of love and what may be the finest advice ever offered on the balance of intimacy and independence in healthy relationships.\n\nIn his narrative poem, when a youth inquires about the essence of friendship, Gibran’s prophet answers:\n\nYour friend is your needs answered.\n\nHe is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.\n\nAnd he is your board and your fireside. For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.\n\nWhen your friend speaks his mind you fear not the “nay” in your own mind, nor do you withhold the “ay.”\n\nAnd when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;\n\nFor without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.\n\nMore than a decade before the brilliant and underappreciated French philosopher Simone Weil considered the paradox of friendship and separation, Gibran offers assurance that absence is only a clarifying and fortifying force for the bond:\n\nWhen you part from your friend, you grieve not;\n\nFor that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.\n\nIn a sentiment C.S. Lewis would come to echo in his poetic insistence that friendship “has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival,” Gibran adds:\n\nAnd let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.\n\nFor love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.\n\nGibran ends the fragment on friendship with a vital reminder that the measure of closeness is not the magnitude of intensity and the heaviness two people entrust in one another but the ability to dance across the entire spectrum of being with equal ease:\n\nIn the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.\n\nFor in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."
