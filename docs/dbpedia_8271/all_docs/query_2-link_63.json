        "text": "Paperback: 220 pages\n\nPublisher: Amaryllis (15 July 2019)\n\nLanguage: English\n\n‘Everything in existence resides in your core, and all of what is in your core resides in existence.’\n\nKahlil Gibran is considered to be one of the most profound writers of all times. He is well-known for his seminal work The Prophet. These new “little book” collections take a fresh look at Gibran’s words and wisdom, taking into account the major influences in his life: his middle eastern culture, nature mysticism, and the Arabic language in which he thought.\n\nThe Little Book of Secrets collects his writings on practical wisdom for daily life, both in community and solitude. Throughout Gibran’s writings, we find his yearning for the permanent, something that can be relied upon. His words though simple take us on a ride to life’s hidden aspects for us to unravel them on our own.\n\nGibran is a seeker musing about life’s paradoxes and its games of hide-and-seek. Gibran’s deepest-felt words point us towards answers to life’s biggest questions, answers that cannot be spoken aloud but only recognized and confirmed in our own unique life experiences.\n\nThe riddles of life both bedevil and bemuse us. Without these puzzles, these games of hide and seek, would we find any interest in life, any reason to continue moving ahead towards life’s purpose?\n\nGibran has the ability to see the extraordinary in the disguise of mundane. He has the prowess to express it in a manner that would definitely strike a chord with our hearts. He brings out the truth of life in this book in a subtle manner.\n\nI would be the least among people with dreams and the desire to fulfill them rather than the greatest with no dreams and no desires.\n\nI would highly recommend this book to anyone who desires to read philosophy. Also, a few stanzas and snippets were a bit complicated so pick this book once you are comfortable with reading difficult prose.\n\nMY RATING: 4/ 5"
