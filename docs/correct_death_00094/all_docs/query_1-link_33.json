        "text": "Timeline\n\nAn illustrated chronology of key events in the life of William Henry Harrison (1773-1841), ninth president of the United States.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison (1773-1841)\n\n1773 Feb. 9\n\nBorn, Charles City County, Virginia. His parents were Elizabeth Bassett Harrison and planter, merchant, and prominent politician Benjamin Harrison V (1726-1791). He was the youngest child and third son in a family of three boys and four girls. His wealthy slave-holding family owned Berkeley Plantation, a prosperous estate on the James River. His father Benjamin Harrison V served as Virginia delegate to both the first and second Continental Congresses.\n\n1774\n\nFirst Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and the American Revolution began, pitting the American colonies against Great Britain.\n\n1776, Aug. 2\n\nFather Benjamin Harrison V signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence as a member of the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia and became known within his family as “The Signer.” His son, William Henry Harrison, and his great-grandson, Benjamin Harrison (1833-1901), later became presidents of the United States.\n\n1781\n\nDuring the American Revolution, the Harrison family home in Virginia was looted of valuables and sacked, but left standing, by the British.\n\n1781-84\n\nFather Benjamin Harrison V served as governor of Virginia.\n\n1783, Sept. 3\n\nTreaty of Paris officially ended the American Revolution.\n\n1787\n\nEducated at home until the age of 14 when he entered Hampden-Sidney College. Enjoyed the study of Greek and Roman history.\n\n1787, July\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance, an act of the Confederation Congress, provided for government of the Northwest Territory. Bordering the Great Lakes and Canada, the territory encompassed parts of what became the future states of Ohio (1803), Indiana (1816), Illinois (1818), Michigan (1837), Wisconsin (1848), and Minnesota (1858).\n\n1788, July\n\nArthur St. Clair (1737-1818), former president of the Continental Congress and an aide-de-camp to George Washington during the American Revolution, was appointed the Northwest Territory’s first governor. He served until 1802.\n\n1788\n\nFather Benjamin Harrison V was a delegate to the Virginia convention called to ratify the Federal Constitution. He decried the lack of a Bill of Rights.\n\n1789\n\nGeorge Washington became the first president of the U.S.\n\n1790\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison studied medicine with Dr. Andrew Leiper in Richmond, Virginia.\n\n1791\n\nLearned of his father’s sudden April 1791 death back home, soon after arriving in Philadelphia to study at the Medical School of Pennsylvania. With his financial status altered, Harrison arranged a commission into the Army infantry, aided by his father’s friends and President George Washington.\n\n1791, Nov.\n\nIn the Battle of the Wabash (also known as St. Clair’s Defeat) U.S. army forces under the command of Major General Arthur St. Clair were decisively defeated by a confederation of Indians led by Miami chief LittleTurtle and Shawnee chief Blue Jacket.\n\n1791, Fall\n\nStationed at Fort Washington, a western stockade located at what would become Cincinnati, Ohio, in the Northwest Territory. Criticized the high rates of intoxication observed among U.S. troops.\n\n1792-93\n\nBecame a lieutenant, then captain, and aide-de-camp and protégé under Revolutionary War hero General (“Mad Anthony”) Anthony Wayne (1745-1796). Wayne’s forces opposed the pan-tribal Western Indian Confederacy led by Shawnee chief Blue Jacket.\n\n1794, Aug. 20\n\nFought in the Battle of Fallen Timbers, which ended the Northwest Indian War.\n\n1795, Aug. 3\n\nPresent at negotiations of the Treaty of Greenville, a peace treaty with Indian leaders conducted at Fort Greenville. The treaty established a boundary line between Native American and Anglo-American settlement by which Indian signers ceded much of the modern-day state of Ohio to white control. Shawnee leader Tecumseh (1768-1813) boycotted the agreement and began to organize a pan-tribal confederation of Indians opposed to white encroachment and fostering retention of traditional Native American cultural and religious practices and ways of life.\n\nc. 1795\n\nTraded family land held in Virginia for title to land in Kentucky. This transaction signified a shift in regional identification from southerner to westerner.\n\n1795, Nov.\n\nMarried Anna Tuthill Symmes (1775-1864), the well-read, boarding-school educated, daughter of wealthy western-land speculator Colonel John Cleves Symmes. An excellent horsewoman, Anna was well suited to frontier and military life. The couple first met in Lexington, Kentucky. The match was supported by Anthony Wayne. The Harrisons moved to a log-cabin home on a farm outside the village of North Bend (near Cincinnati), purchased from the bride’s father.\n\n1796\n\nEldest daughter Elizabeth born, the first of ten children.\n\n1796-97\n\nInvested in business, including a gristmill, whiskey distillery, and sawmill, in Indiana Territory. None of the ventures proved profitable. Meanwhile, commanded the quiet outpost of Fort Washington.\n\n1798\n\nBecame secretary of Indiana Territory.\n\n1799-1800\n\nAs a delegate from the Northwest Territory to Congress, in Philadelphia, Harrison penned the Land Act of 1800. It reduced the size of tracts of federal land available to western white settlers and made land available on credit, increasing white settlement but also raising the number of foreclosures. The sociable Harrison enjoyed evenings at President John Quincy Adams’s residence.\n\n1800, May-July\n\nAppointed by President John Quincy Adams the first governor of the Indiana Territory, created when Congress subdivided the Northwest Territory. Served as governor of Indiana Territory for twelve years.\n\n1800-11\n\nTook up residence at Vincennes, a French and Indian settlement some 200 miles from Cincinnati. As governor, supported the creation of an agricultural society, circulating library, and a Vincennes college, the latter to be supported by public lottery, and encouraged founding of the Indiana Gazette. Indian policies superseded resident Native American populations in favor of white settlement and statehood. Elite whites prospered from land speculation. Shawnee leader Tecumseh and his brother The Prophet led an Indian confederation that opposed further succession of lands and resisted assimilation by Indians to hegemonic Anglo-American religious beliefs and cultural practices.\n\n1803\n\nOhio became the 17th state of the United States.\n\n1804, Aug.\n\nTreaty of Vincennes.\n\n1804\n\nGubernatorial mansion, Grouseland, completed. The well-constructed two-story brick home was a sensation in Vincennes.\n\n1805\n\nTreaty of Grouseland negotiated on behalf of the United States with Native American military leaders Miami chief Little Turtle and Lenape chief Buckongahelas.\n\n1809\n\nTreaty of Fort Wayne (the Twelve Mile Line Treaty) opened vast acreage to white settlement and sparked what became known as Tecumseh’s War.\n\n1811, Nov. 7\n\nIn Tecumseh’s absence, Harrison’s U.S. soldiers overcame supporters of Tecumseh’s brother, Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) at the Battle of Tippecanoe (near present-day Lafayette, Indiana, and the confluence of the Wabash and Tippecanoe rivers). The battle resulted in the temporary destruction of Prophetstown, the encampment and headquarters of the spiritual followers of Tenskwatawa , a setback for the Indian confederation. Indian resistance continued into the War of 1812.\n\n1812\n\nCommissioned as a general in the War of 1812. Took command of American forces in the northwest. Resigned as territorial governor of Indiana Territory.\n\n1813, Sept.\n\nAmerican troops were victorious over the British and their allies at Detroit.\n\n1813, Oct. 5\n\nBattle of the Thames in Upper Canada pitted Harrison’s U.S. cavalry and infantry against the British and their Indian allies. The British retreated. Shawnee political and military leader Tecumseh was killed in battle, severely weakening the Indian alliance he headed. The U.S. army victory secured white control of the northwest frontier.\n\n1814, July 22\n\nWon pledges of support for the U.S. cause from pan-tribal Indian leaders in the Second Treaty of Greenville, with Governor Lewis Cass.\n\n1814, Dec.\n\nTreaty of Ghent officially ended the War of 1812.\n\n1815-18\n\nMember, U.S. House of Representatives, from Ohio.\n\n1819-21\n\nElected to the Ohio state Senate and served two terms.\n\n1820\n\nUnsuccessful candidate for governor of Ohio.\n\n1822\n\nUnsuccessful candidate for U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n1825-28\n\nMember, U.S. Senate, from Ohio (until May 1828).\n\n1828-29\n\nU.S. envoy to Colombia.\n\n1829\n\nEntrepreneur and businessman in Ohio.\n\n1831\n\nFailed in a new election bid for the U.S. Senate.\n\n1836-40\n\nCounty court clerk, Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\n1836\n\nUnsuccessful Whig Party candidate for the presidency of the U.S. The successful Democratic party opponent was Andrew Jackson’s political favorite son, Martin Van Buren of New York.\n\n1839, Dec.\n\nNominated for president at the Whig Party convention in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. John Tyler nominated for vice president. Henry Clay had garnered the most votes in early balloting, but did not win a majority. Behind-the-scenes politicking led to a compromise Harrison-Tyler ticket, with Tyler of Virginia a pro-Clay delegate.\n\n1840\n\nThe campaign of 1840 was a rematch between Harrison, the Whig of Ohio, versus Martin Van Buren, Democrat of New York and the incumbent president of the U.S. Van Buren was nominated unanimously at the Democratic National Convention, but Democrats balked at backing controversial incumbent Richard M. Johnson as vice president. Harrison’s campaign, meanwhile, was heavily infused by popular songs and by frontier iconography, including images of log cabins, coonskin caps, hard cider, and yeoman farmers at their plows. Harrison’s political nickname “Tippecanoe” appeared in lyrics of the Whig Log Cabin Song Book, and the Harrison campaign slogan remained famous into modern times: “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too.”\n\n1841, Mar. 4\n\nSworn into office as president of the U.S. Harrison gave a long inaugural address, speaking for an hour and forty minutes and putting his interest in Roman history to good use in the speech. Harrison, at age 68, remained the eldest person inaugurated as president until 1981, when Ronald Reagan took office at age 69.\n\n1841, April 4\n\nAfter a short acute illness, the previously hearty president died only weeks after taking office, in Washington, D.C. Interned in William Henry Harrison State Memorial Park, adjacent to Congress Green Cemetery in North Bend, Ohio. Vice President John Tyler succeeded as U.S. president, quickly alienating Whig supporters.\n\n1841, May 14\n\nNational day of mourning for the late president.\n\n1864\n\nWidow Anna T. S. Harrison, died while the American Civil War was still in progress. Her grandson, Benjamin, became president of the U.S. in 1889."
