        "text": "My “Greatest” Aunt Natalie was instrumental in piquing my interest in genealogy and most recently entrusted me with her work of 30+ years. When she passed, exactly a year ago today, I wrote “Rest in Peace my Greatest Aunt Natalie and thanks for the wonderful legacy….AND if you can hear me, please send a SIGN to help us FINALLY find Jennie Ferguson’s parents John and Elizabeth!!!!” (click here for post about Aunt Natalie).\n\nThis post tells what I know of Jennie Ferguson’s life (click here).\n\nIn a nutshell, Jennie might have been born in the area near Richibucto, Kent, New Brunswick, Canada (according to daughter Jennie Haines Johnson’s 1919 death certificate, informant was her husband Ernest Johnson; other records specify a generic birthplace of New Brunswick) likely about 1858, records place her birth between 1856 and 1864**.\n\n** Jennie’s birth year ?\n\nThe Boston Globe death notice lists her as age 82 (b. abt 1856) Her death certificate puts her age at 74 (b. 1864);\n\nHer gravestone reads 1858-1938;\n\nthe 1880 census puts her age at 22, b. abt 1858 (assuming it is really her and not someone of the same name – she is working as a domestic);\n\nShe is listed as age 23 when she married in 1882 (b. abt 1859);\n\nthe 1900 census lists a birth date of Jun 1866, age 33 and says she was married 18 years. If correct, this would put her age 15 at marriage;\n\nthe 1910 census gives her age as 51 (b. 1859);\n\n1930 census, there is a woman of the same name as an inmate at a hospital in Boston, age 73, b. 1857 – not sure if this is her as she supposedly owned and was living in a house in Billerica (no records in Billerica have been located – land deeds of Middlesex North are not online and I have not had the opportunity to visit)\n\nIf she is really the Jane Ferguson in the 1861 Canadian census (mentioned herein), her age was 4, thus she was b. abt 1857\n\nJennie relocated to Boston in the late 1870’s or early 1880’s where she likely was employed as a servant. She married there on 7 March 1882. Her husband was William John “John” Haines, born 7 Mar 1856 in Richibucto, son of John Haines/Hains and Alice Edith Childs. They likely knew each other before arrival in Boston, from Richibucto, as Jennie was a best friend to John’s sister Mary Haines (according to Mary’s diary). The marriage record names Jennie’s parents as John and Elizabeth. The Rev. John Hood, who married them, is listed in Boston City Directories in that time period at United Presbyterian, corner of Berkeley and Chandler Streets (the church record of this marriage has not been located).\n\nAn entry in Mary Haines’s diary reads:\n\n26 January 1882: “John came over from Chelsea this evening. We had a lovely time together. Jenny Ferguson my dear friend came down from Richibucto. She was here tonight. Just came on the boat today. I am so glad to see her. She is my dearest friend” [ship manifest not located].\n\nAll available birth, marriage and death records for Jennie, John and their eight children have been reviewed. She is named as Jennie or Jennie Ferguson in all except one – her daughter Margaret Elizabeth’s marriage in 1909 names her as Jennie Garfield. Garfield might be a typo or a clue….\n\nAnother “clue”might be the name Glatis/Galatis. Jennie named her first son John Glatis Haines. Glatis is not a name of the Haines family, so perhaps it is linked to the Fergusons.\n\nRecords were examined in New Brunswick and no individuals with a surname similiar to “Garfield” or “Glatis/Galatis” seemed to be associated with Fergusons. Both names were uncommon in that area.\n\nOther children’s names may offer clues: Ella May, Margaret Elizabeth, Minnie and Jennie (Edith, Alexander, John and Joseph are Haines family names). Mary Haines’ diary mentions her closest friend besides Jennie is Minnie Gordon, was Jennie’s daughter named after this Minnie? Minnie has not been identified in records, but there was a Gordon family who resided near or next door to Elizabeth (Potts) Ferguson, Jennie’s probable grandmother, in 1861 in Weldford, Kent New Brunswick.\n\nJennie was Aunt Natalie’s (and my grandmother Edith’s) paternal grandmother, thus my paternal gg-grandmother.\n\n1861 Ferguson Family\n\nIn Weldford Parish, Kent, New Brunswick, 1861 (census page 27), an Elizabeth Ferguson was enumerated with her “brother” Archibald and his two nieces, 4-year old Jane (a common nickname for Jennie) and infant Jepie (perhaps Jessie). Further research places the family in South Branch, a village about twelve miles from Richibucto. Mary Haines’ diary circa 1880-1883 mentions her visit home to Weldford.\n\nRight next door to Archibald Ferguson is James Alexander Clare. John Hains (Jennie Ferguson’s father-in-law) married a Jane Clare in 1865; online trees name James and Jane as siblings. Thus a potential connection as neighbors, between the Ferguson and Haines families.\n\nTwo pages away, and thus likely nearby, in this same census (page 25), listed just after the family of Thomas Gordon, is Elizabeth Ferguson, of the age to be Elizabeth and Archibald’s mother, with her children Agnes, Robert, Andrew, Mary and granddaughter Mary, age 6 [this granddaughter is listed as age 21 in 1871, then is not found marrying or in later censuses – who are her parents? – could this be Jennie listed by a middle name? or her sister?]. There is also a John Graham listed as Elizabeth’s son. The census is unclear, but further analysis indicates this may be her son from a prior relationship.\n\nThe Robert Ferguson named in this census as a son of Elizabeth Ferguson, filed a delayed birth record in 1932 where he names his parents as William Ferguson and Betsy Potts, he writes that his mother had 6 children, all of whom were living. If Elizabeth had eight children, he would have been Elizabeth’s 6th child in birth order: (1) John Graham, (2) Jane, (3) Elizabeth, (4) Archibald, (5) Agnes, (6) Robert, (7) Andrew, (8) Mary. Or if his statement is accurate, it is possible two of these children were not born to Elizabeth (a land deed, discussed later in this narrative, names children 2-8 as heirs of William Ferguson).\n\nSide note: Robert named children Jennie and Jessie (perhaps family names?)\n\nThe marriage of this couple was published:\n\nPANB, Daniel F. Johnson. Date December 28 1830, County Northumberland, Place Chatham, Newspaper The Gleaner and Northumberland:\n\nm. Thursday 10th, by John Jardine, William FERGUSON, Esq. / Elizabeth POTTS, Harcourt (Kent Co.)\n\nLand deeds further connect the Ferguson, Potts and Graham families.\n\nFor example, in 1856 Archibald Ferguson, Andrew Ferguson and John Graham all of Weldford jointly buy land of John Potts of Wellington.\n\nA cemetery transcription at GALLOWAY CEMETERY in Rexton (formerly Kingston, just south of Richibucto) reads:\n\nFERGUSON, William died Apr 19 1844 aged 59\n\nnative of Dumfrieshire, Scotland\n\nWilliam Ferguson and Elizabeth Potts’s apparent last child, Mary was born in 1841. The 1851 census for Kent County did not survive. Elizabeth is widowed by 1861 and the census offers a race/where born of “Scotch Newcastle Dumfries”. Thus, this grave transcription could be her husbands (although there was a land deed filed in Weldford, 18 October 1844 where William Ferguson and his wife Betty sell land to John Graham – the deed reads that William appear on this date, if accurate he could not have passed six months prior to his appearance). Jannet (Dunn) Childs, mother to Alice Edith Childs and James Childs, grandmother to William John Hains was also said to be of Dumfriesshire, Scotland. Perhaps a connection between the families.\n\nElizabeth is buried at St. Andrews in Rexton next to Captain Simon Graham’s second wife Mabel Plume. Was Simon related?\n\nFERGUSON, Elizabeth died Jan 16 1872 age 72\n\nwife of William FERGUSON\n\nElizabeth’s grave states that she is of New Castle on Liddesdale, Rocborough Shire [Newcastleton, is a village in the Scottish Borders and within the historic boundaries of Roxburghshire, a few miles from the border of Scotland with England. The village is in Liddesdale and is on the Liddel Water, and the site of Hermitage Castle. The planned village of Newcastleton locally titled “Copshawholm” was founded by Henry Scott the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch on the 4th March 1793 taking the place of the original village of Castleton as a centre of development for flax, wool and cotton handloom weaving].\n\nKent County probate records were destroyed by fire, however an 1869 a deed was filed that names the heirs of William Ferguson:\n\nAndrew Ferguson, Archibald Ferguson of Weldford….Agnes Ferguson, Elizabeth Ferguson and Mary Ferguson, all of the same place spinsters. Jane Evans, wife of John Evans of the same place, all heirs of the late William Ferguson deceased. It then goes on to name Eliza Ferguson wife of Archibald Ferguson and Robert Ferguson also heirs.\n\nMarriage\n\nWhile it is possible that Elizabeth Ferguson had two children out of wedlock, she may have also have been widowed and thus Archibald’s sister-in-law. However, she is named as a heir to William Ferguson and a “spinster” indicating that perhaps she never married. Since Elizabeth Potts named a son John Graham, she likely did not name a subsequent son John Ferguson. This might indicate that although Jennie’s father may have been named John, his surname would not likely have been Ferguson.\n\nIn 1871, Elizabeth, a servant, and Jessie Ferguson were enumerated in Richibucto Parish (Jennie/Jane was not found this census year); given the age variations for Jennie in various documents, it is also possible that she was “Jessie” and her name was misinterpreted by the census enumerator:\n\nWilliam Fitzgerald (widower, wives were Honora Hickey/Jean Potts)- 78\n\nElizabeth Ferguson – 32\n\nJessie Ferguson – 9\n\nJohn McWilliams – 4\n\nThat year’s city directory places Fitzgerald in Weldford, South Branch.\n\nWilliam Fitzgerald was likely related through his marriage to Jean Potts, probably a sister to Elizabeth Ferguson’s mother, thus William was probably an uncle. In 1871 there was an exchange of land between William Fitzgerald and Robert & Andrew Ferguson, his likely nephews. Fitzgerald’s will is found in December 1875 New Brunswick land deeds; assets are left to his son-in-law and daughter, Richard English and wife Mary.\n\nNo definitive connection has been found between the Fergusons and John McWilliams, but he could be a relative. There was a John Childs, age 14 enumerated with Elizabeth in 1881. This could be John McWilliams enumerated with another surname in error. He was not found under either surname after this date. In 1871 there is a McWilliams family near Elizabeth (Potts) Ferguson in Weldford: William (63, b. Scotland), Christine (58, b. Scotland), Alexander (30), David (22), Janet (24), Anne (20), Christina (18), John (18), Archibald (10).\n\nElizabeth Ferguson married James Childs, son of Joseph Childs and Jannet Dunn, 28 January 1875; both were of Richibucto. The marriage was solemnized by Rev. James Law (1822 – 1882) minister of St Andrews Church, Rexton for 32 years from 1845 to 1877 – the church yard where Jannet Dunn and Alice Edith Childs are buried). More of the church and it’s origins here – A-historical-account-of-St-Andrews-Church. Witnesses were Nicholas Childs (James’s sister) and William English.\n\nNote: In the 1871 census, Elizabeth Ferguson was enumerated as family #155; James Childs’s with his father and siblings are listed on the prior census page, families #147 & 148 – this is also where Mary Haines was enumerated in 1861, she and Jennie Ferguson might have crossed paths and become friends while neighbors between 1861 and 1871.\n\nAn entry in Mary’s diary dated 1 Dec 1881 reads: Seven years ago today [1874] dear Joseph [her brother] and I left Weldford for Nova Scotia. Confirmation that both Haines and this Ferguson family were residing in Weldford.\n\nA witness to Elizabeth and James’ marriage, William English (son of Richard English and Nancy May Fitzgerald, daughter of the William Fitzgerald with whom Elizabeth resided in 1871), was part of family #149. There were also several land transactions recorded between William Fitzgerald and William English.\n\nJames Childs was brother to Alice Edith Childs, who was mother to Jennie Ferguson’s husband John Haines and her best friend, Mary Haines!! This seems to be another connection between the Haines and Ferguson families!!!!!! (more details on the Childs’ family here).\n\nIn 1881 and 1891, James and Elizabeth were enumerated in Weldford Parish. They had two sons, James and William Joseph (neither seemed to marry or have children).\n\nThere was a John Childs, age 14 enumerated with them in 1881 (possibly the John McWilliams listed in 1871). It appears this John died in 1888. The newspapers reports: “John CHILDS of New Brunswick, while at work in a gravel pit on Sourdinahunk stream, Maine [Nesowadnehunk, Northern Maine near Mt Katahdin] was killed last Friday by the bank caving in on him. He lived a few hours”. He is buried at St Andrews near James’s mother Jannet and sister Edith. Death records list cause as an accident, his age as 22 but a residence of New Hampshire.\n\nBy 1901 James and Elizabeth relocated to British Columbia, where Elizabeth died 31 July 1913.\n\nIn 1915, James next married his g-grand niece, Elizabeth Mitchell, who was 20 years his junior (widow of Adam Stothart; daughter of James Walter Mitchell and Elizabeth Mary Haywood), with whom he had four children – Janet Bertha (1915-1922), William Albion (1916-1976), Sarah Jean (1919-1930) and Hattie (1922-2011) before he died in 1923. Elizabeth Mitchell mother, Elizabeth Mary Haywood was the daughter of James Childs’ sister, Jane Childs.\n\nJennie’s best friend, Mary Haines’s grandson Ralph Stevens, inherited a photo from Mary’s collection. Mary kept in touch with her uncle James and his wife, the photo was included with a letter by Elizabeth (Mitchell) Childs. The photo reads: These are Bertha and Billy Childs my half bro. + sis. Don’t you like my little Billy boy? Yes, he is a little darling + mouse.\n\nTo date, I have only located Hattie Childs’s obituary and it it has no mention of Jennie. If a Stothart descendant wrote the obituary they may not have been aware of a relationship if there were one.\n\nMaps\n\nA map of the area and the 1865/6 Kingston (now Rexton) directory further connects families. William Ferguson is in RED. Nearby in GREEN are the following connected families:\n\nJames A. Clare – father of Jane Clare, second wife of John Hains (m. 1865) and step-mother of Jennie Ferguson’s husband John and best friend Mary Haines.\n\nJoseph Childs – Grandfather of William John Haines, Jennie Ferguson’s husband.\n\nRichard English – son in law of William Fitzgerald, likely his wife is 1st cousin to Elizabeth Ferguson.\n\nSimon Graham – Elizabeth Ferguson seems to have had a child named John Graham and she is buried next to Simon’s second wife Mabel Plume. They could be related.\n\nJames Morton – father of Alexander Morton who married Mary Childs, sister to James Childs (husband of Elizabeth Ferguson) and daughter of Joseph Childs and Janet Dunn\n\nWilliam Fitzgerald – likely family with whom Elizabeth Ferguson was living in 1871, likely a maternal uncle.\n\nJohn Potts, Jr. – likely relation to Elizabeth Potts, wife of William Ferguson.\n\nPotential Jessie connection (likely not accurate if Elizabeth Ferguson was a biological daughter of William)\n\nA search of the 1871 New Brunswick census reveals only one Jessie Ferguson born between 1855 and 1865 in New Brunswick (using search criteria Jes* F*s*n – where * is a wildcard). There is one other enumerated in New Brunswick as Jessie C Furgusson who was born in PEI abt 1857. Her parents seem to be John and Sharleen. The same search in the United States, in 1870 with a birth place of Canada (and Maine), yielded no matches.\n\nA Jessie Ferguson of the correct age to be Elizabeth’s daughter, born in New Brunswick, is found in 1880 working as a servant in Portland, Maine.\n\nOn 07 Nov 1882 in Portland, Cumberland, Maine, she married George W. Johnston. The couple relocated to Wisconsin and then to Washington State. Children included Ernest, Ada, Sarah, Gordon and Bernice. Most census records list Jessie’s birthplace as Maine, only the 1880 census lists New Brunswick.\n\nJessie died 17 Oct 1934, Port Angeles, Clallam, Washington. Her death record names her parents:\n\nJennie Ferguson’s parents were also named as John and Elizabeth! Could Jessie be a sister and Elizabeth’s maiden name Wallace? Or did Jennie’s sister die young and Elizabeth Ferguson daughter of William have two children out of wedlock?\n\nConclusion\n\nI am still searching! But this information is intriguing…Aunt Natalie, are you listening? – send me a sign!!\n\nA few last notes: The only other Ferguson family in the area of Richibucto was that of Jacob Ferguson (first wife Elizabeth McNarin , second wife Agnes Dickie). I took a photo of his grave at Saint Andrews, Rexton cemetery when I visited in 2014. His stone states that he was a native of Wallace, N.S. (census record also list a Nova Scotia place of birth about 1824 – 6 years prior to the Ferguson/Potts marriage). Descendants of this Ferguson family appear in the Drouin Collection of Catholic Church records, Richibucto; the Ferguson family I’ve outlined and Jennie were likely Presbyterian.\n\nThus Jacob is probably not a member of William Ferguson’s family. Although he is buried in the same churchyard and both of his marriages were also performed by the Rev. James Law….\n\nUPDATE October 2016 – We have a DNA match!!!!!! The tree of a 94 year old tester, J.F., states he is the grandson of Archibald Ferguson, son of William Ferguson and Elizabeth Potts!!! We mutually match four testers who have not responded to my inquiries (one with a 56 CM match and three in the 20-27 cM range), three of them have no family tree and the fourth has a sparse tree with no similar surnames or locations.\n\nThe largest shared match (56 cM) has an Acadian screen name. When I select “in common with” I get 10 pages of Ancestry matches (thus a connection to my mother and not Jennie who is on my dad’s side)! Same with one of the other smaller matches. The other two matches and I only have J.F. in common.\n\nJ.F. shares 68 cMs with me across 4 segments on Ancestry.com, thus about 1% (he is not on GEDMATCH so I have been unable to identify specific segments). A match of this size would predict us being about third cousins, so second cousins three times removed essentially falls into this range.\n\nJ.F.’s other lines were reviewed. He does have a number of French surnames, many of which are likely Acadian. We do not have any common matches back 5 generations on those lines. My mother is 50% Acadian, it is possible that we have common ancestors many generations back. Given that we only have matches in common with four other testers (and I have about 1,400 Acadian 4th cousin or closer matches on Ancestry.com), despite endogamy, it is unlikely that Acadian ancestors back more than 5 generations could contribute such a high percentage of DNA and if it did, we might expect to see a number of smaller segments vs. just matching on four.\n\nI have hopes that the tester will eventually upload to GEDMATCH (my mother’s results are there) so that I can further prove or disprove matches to my maternal Acadian line, and perhaps increase confidence this is a true Ferguson match.\n\nUPDATE March 2017: My paternal uncle’s results are in!! He would be a second cousin 2x removed to this tester if my theory is correct. My uncle shares 183 centimorgans across 7 DNA segments. Second cousins 2x removed on average share 81 cMs, but the range (according to Blaine Bettenger) is 0-201.\n\nThe testers grandson also tested (thus my 4th cousin 1x removed and my uncle’s 4th cousin). I do not share any DNA with the grandson, however my uncle shares 39 centimorgans across 3 DNA segments (average is typically 31 with a range of 0-90 according to Blaine’s chart).\n\nAnother Ancestry.com tester, bwest984, matches my uncle at 26.8 cMs and me at 19.6cMs. She is a 2nd g-grandaughter of William Ferguson and Betsey Potts, thus my uncle’s 3rd cousin 1x removed (they should share 0-156 cMs) and my 3rd cousin 2x removed (we should share 0-82 cMs) .\n\nOne of Jennie’s grandchildren has also tested and results are pending.\n\nIn summary, Jennie’s grandparents were most likely William Ferguson and Elizabeth Potts and Archibald was likely her uncle. One of William and Elizabeth’s children was likely a parent to Jennie. Although not proven, information seems to suggest that her mother might have been Elizabeth.\n\nI recently attended the Salt Lake Institute of Genealogy Problem Solving Course. The abridge course description:\n\nChoose a project focus, ancestor, time period, geographical area, and research questions.\n\nUnder guidance from professional consultants, student’s will use a group collaborative approach to discuss research progress each day, utilizing the combined knowledge and experience of the group to solve problems.\n\nAlthough I am “more organized”, I did not solve the mystery. If you want to help, here’s the abridged version!\n\nRESEARCH QUESTION:\n\nWho are the parents of Lt. Brian/Briant Hall, my 5th-great grandfather?\n\nLt. Brian/Briant Hall, a soldier in the Revolution, was born about 9 Jul 1727, perhaps in Taunton (later Raynham), Bristol, Massachusetts. He married, 14 Nov 1751, Abiah Crossman, daughter of Samuel Crossman and Joanna Leonard and died about 13 Dec 1778 in Norton, Bristol, Massachusetts. He is buried with Abiah at Norton Common Cemetery who died 15 Feb 1814.\n\nKnown children: Isaac, Nancy/Anna, Prudence, John, Brian, Abiah & Silas\n\nBIRTH RECORDED:\n\nThe First Book of Raynham (Massachusetts) Records 1700–1835 (Online database: NewEnglandAncestors.org, New England Historic Genealogical Society, 2003), (Handwritten unpublished transcription, transcriber unknown, “First Book of Raynham Records,” donated to NEHGS in 1897) lists:\n\nBirth: 9 July 1727 – Brian son of John Hall 3d of Taunton & Mary his wife\n\nSee Ancestry.com: http://tinyurl.com/q9a3ddk\n\nThe eastern end of Taunton, was incorporated as Raynham when Brian was about four, on April 2, 1731. The entries around his birth record date circa 1752/3. The entry is surrounded by other Hall families. Brian was married in August 1751. Thus, Brian perhaps reported the birth himself, about the time of his marriage.\n\nAs one is unable to recollect their own birth and because the records appear to be in the same handwriting (perhaps copied from an earlier book), the source and reliability of this information is unknown.\n\nThe 1733 Raynham tax list shows only one John Hall.\n\nThe 1757 Raynham tax list shows a Brian Hall with a John Hall 3rd as the following entry.\n\nPUBLISHED WORKS:\n\nUnsourced publications assert that Brian Hall was the son of John Hall and Mary (unknown) and name him as a descendant of George Hall, an early settler of Taunton, Massachusetts through:\n\nGeorge’s son John m. Hannah Penniman,\n\nGeorge’s grandson John m. Elizabeth King and\n\nGeorge’s g-grandson John m. (1) Mary and (2) Hannah Williams\n\nThe earliest of these (likely the source of all others) appears to be “The Halls of New England. Genealogical and biographical”. By David B. Hall, published Albany, N.Y., Printed for the author by J. Munsell’s Sons, 1883. George’s ancestry is found on pages 567-648, with Brian named on pages 574, 580 & 581 (screen shot below) – http://hdl.handle.net/2027/yale.39002005232799\n\nIn his preface, the author writes, “…My first intention was to compile only my own line, the Halls of Medford, but afterwards I concluded to embrace in the work all the records that I could find. And I have found much more than I then supposed was in existence, and still the work is far from containing all that might be obtained….” Perhaps less effort was given to unrelated Hall families.\n\nI surmise that much of this genealogy was crafted through letters from Hall families residing in New England in 1883 vs. use of original sources.\n\nRichard Henry Hall, a great-grandson of Brian Hall, in December 1886 became the mayor of Taunton, Massachusetts. The election may have given him reason to name himself (and thus Brian) as a direct descendant of George Hall (See page 730 – Our Country and Its People: A Descriptive and Biographical Record of Bristol County, Massachusetts, Part 2) or perhaps he really believed that he decended from George as did all other Halls in the Taunton area.\n\nThe concept of “John 3rd” likely had different meaning in the 1700’s vs. current day, and should not be interpreted as the third generation of John in that particular family. It may mean there were at least three John Hall’s in the area from same or different families, and Brian’s father John was the youngest of the three.\n\n2. Excerpt from George Hall and his Descendants (1603-1669) compiled by Robert Leo Hall, published in 1998 [copy in my private collection]:\n\nJohn Hall born 1694, in Taunton, Bristol County, MA; died 1766 in Raynham, MA. First married Mary (Ukn) and had children Freelove and Brian. He second married Hannah Williams and had children John, Hannah, Elkanah, Elisha, Joseph and Noah.\n\nHis source: ALLRED RECORDS in the home of Marcella G. Allred, 349 W. 3rd St., Lovell, WY 82431. I have been unsuccessful in tracking her work.\n\nRobert Leo Hall is deceased and his descendants do not know what became of this cited source.\n\nIn 2009, a descendant of Marcella wrote to me: Aunt Marcella Allred passed away a number of years ago. I am not sure where any of her living children are, possibly in Utah. Aunt Marcella was famous in this area for the amount of genealogy work that she did. Her maiden name was Graham. I am assuming that she must have been related to your ancestors.\n\n3. In “Brian Pendleton and his Descendants, 1599-1910”, Everett Hall Pendleton, asserts that Brian’s mother was Mary Brettun/Britton, daughter of William Brettun and granddaughter of Mary (Pendleton) Brettun Cross Morey, who married (1) Joseph Hall and (2) John Hall, descendant of Brian Pendleton, born about 1599, one of the early settlers of Watertown and Sudbury, Massachusetts who owned land the Maine and New Hampshire. http://hdl.handle.net/2027/wu.89069624344\n\nMary Morey left a will recorded 10 Jan 1732/3. It is indexed under the name “Marcy Morey” in ”Abstracts of Bristol County, Massachusetts Probate Records, 1687-1745″ H. L. Peter Rounds. In it she names her father, grandfather, husbands and grandchildren.\n\nThe actual will (copy in my files) reads:\n\n….Item – I Give and Bequeath to my Grand Children William Brettun, Abiale Brettun, Ebenezer Brettun, Pendleton Brettun, Mary Hall, Lydia Brettun, Sarah Brettun, Elizabeth Brettun, & Abigail Brettun, all the remaining three quarters of my Real Estate lands Meadows & ____ which belong to me to be equally divided between them Only that my granddaughter Mary Hall is to enjoy her part during her life and after her deceased her children to enjoy her part equally between them and their heirs….\n\nTHEORIES\n\nIs Brian’s father John Hall, g-grandson of George who married 2nd Hannah Williams?\n\nBrian Hall, son of John (with Mary) and John Hall, son of John (with Hannah) were born within 7 months of one another, if the Rayhnam records of birth are accurate, and the pregnancies were full term – either John Hall got two women pregnant at the same time or there were two John Hall’s in Taunton/Raynham in 1727 (John Hall, son of John Hall and Hannah is born January 26, 1728. Date based on the birth record in the original Raynham Vital Records, he was conceived around May of 1727, Brian was born two months later).\n\nBrian Hall is not mentioned in John Hall of Raynham’s will of 1766. All 6 of his children by Hannah are mentioned (including those who got nothing):\n\nHe left of to John Hall eldest son of the deceased all the aforesaid of five lots of land one small right in the old iron works in Raynham and two seventh parts….\n\nIt is stated in the will “Nothing is left to Joseph Hall son of deceased because he already got a gift in his lifetime of 95 acres estimated at 3 quid and 50 pounds”. and “Nothing is left to Noah Hall son of the deceased because he already got a gift in his lifetime of four pieces of land which are estimated at three hundred pounds the land being about 84 acres”\n\nAll land deeds in Bristol County were examined (by me) for Brian Hall. There was no land exchanged between the two men during their lifetime.\n\nNone of Brian’s children followed the naming patterns of the John who married Hannah’s parents/grandparents.\n\nA number of errors have been discovered by other researchers in the “Halls of New England”, most of which were repeated in the book “George Hall and his Descendants (1603-1669)”. One example is “A Maze of Halls in Taunton, Massachusetts: Correlating Land Description to Prove Identity” written by Marsha Hoffman Rising, and originally published in National Genealogical Society Quarterly in 1993 which sorts the Samuel Halls of George of Taunton and Edward of Rehoboth.\n\nY-DNA evidence suggests there is no relationship between the two men. As of today, there are four testers through George Hall’s son Samuel. One from Samuel’s son Ebenezer and three from Samuel’s son Samuel. None of these match the DNA of three of Brian’s descendants, one through Brian’s son Brian and two through Brian’s son Silas. As of Jan 2016 one of George’s son Joseph’s likely descendants has tested and we are awaiting results. If he matches Samuel this will further support the theory that Brian does NOT decend from George. No living male Hall descendants have been located for George’s son John and thus that line remains untested. Y-DNA of Brian’s descendant do not match that of Edward Hall of Rehobeth either.\n\nResults here: https://www.familytreedna.com/public/hall/default.aspx?section=yresults Brian is family #47, George is family #24 and Edward family #6\n\nIs Brian’s mother Mary Brettun/Britton, descendant of Brian Pendleton?\n\nIn 1727, the name “Brian/Briant/Bryant” was quite uncommon. It is plausible that Brian was named after Brian Pendleton. Many years later, the 1790 census on Ancestry.com lists just thirteen Brian/Briant’s as head of households in the United States (even with indexing errors and the fact that other household members are not listed, this seems low and indicates the name uncommon). *Note that on a 1728 map of Taunton (available for purchase at Old Colony Historical Society), in the area which is now Raynham, there was a Briant/Bryant family residing next to the Crossman/Britton families could Brian instead be a family surname?\n\nMary Morey’s will is very detailed. Mary Hall is the only grandchild called out separately in the will: “Mary Hall is to enjoy her part during her lifetime but after her deceased her children to enjoy her part equally between them and their heirs” Although not direct evidence, this seems to imply that perhaps Mary already had children in 1732.\n\nThere is record in Bristol County of Pendleton Britton and Brian Hall owning land together implying the two were associates and perhaps cousins?\n\nBrian was recorded as a cordwainer (shoemaker) in land deeds and Iron Works records beginning when he was 23. Mary Britton’s brother, Ebenizier, also of Raynham, was a cordwainer. Perhaps Brian was raised by the Britton’s and apprenticed with his uncle as a young man.\n\nIn Raynham, 1731, a John Hall and William Britton are paid for supplying pine boards to the town. This suggests a relationship between the two – Brian’s supposed mother was Mary Britton, William Britton’s daughter. If John was a Miller with William Britton, maybe their kids married?\n\nPOTENTIAL THEORY\n\nThere is a John Hall who got land near Cobbler’s Corner (book 9, page 72 – an area which is now Mansfield) in 1715 it seems with Mill rights*. He might be the same John Hall listed as an early Norton church member (a member of the First Church of Norton and witnessed the ordination of its first Minister, Joseph Avery in 1714). Wife of John Hall, Bethiah joined in 1716.\n\nThen John Hall and wife Ruth record births of Bethiah 1 Dec 1721 and Benjamin 10 Aug 1720 in Norton (at that time Mansfield was part of Norton). So maybe Bethiah died, he married Ruth and named a child after his deceased wife? In 1723 (not filed until 1735) there is a deed where a John Hall is selling land near Cobbler’s Corner, with Ruth his wife (book 23 page 494)\n\nIn Raynham, 1731, a John Hall and William Britton are paid for supplying pine boards to the town. This suggests a relationship between the two – Brian’s supposed mother was Mary Britton, William Britton’s daughter. If John was a Miller with William Britton, maybe their kids married?\n\nThere is also a marriage recorded of John Hall to Sarah Wellman both of Norton 7 March 1726/7. Then in 1730, there is a deed for purchase of land in Raynham by Samual Wellman of “John Hall of Norton, Miller” he also mentions his Mill, with a Sarah Hall as wife (book 25, page 116). Other witnesses include Benjamin Wellman, Isaac & Isaac jr Wellman***.\n\nThere is a John Hall, husband of Sarah who died intestate in 1736 in Raynham. Others mentioned James Hall & John Hall yeomen.\n\nNone of these “Johns” appear to be listed in the “Halls of New England” book… Unfortunately none of the John Hall wives were named Mary.\n\nA Mary Hall who was born in 1699/1700 and is buried in Mansfield Cemetery called Happy Hollow Cemetery on York Street (Mansfield Vital Records). She is called a widow when she died February 20, 1760 and her gravestone gives her age as being in her 60th Year.\n\n**Halls of New England claims John Hall (a descendant of George) who married Esther Bell was the John who received the mill privilege in 1714 in Norton (which is modern day Mansfield) and that he lived at a place called Cobblers Corner…based on a review of land deeds this seems inaccurate.\n\n*** Isaac Wellman died intestate before 1743 his heirs are listed as the widow Mary, sons Isaac, Ebenezer and Timothy and daughter Hannah. A “deceased child” is also mentioned, it seems the other siblings are splitting her share – this might be Sarah.\n\nTIMELINE\n\nNote: Brian recorded 63 land transactions in Bristol County and several in North Providence, Rhode Island in his lifetime, all have been examined but not all have been added to this timeline yet.\n\n9 July 1727 born to John 3rd and Mary (thus conceived around October/November 1726 – Brian’s birth record was recorded about 1752) – record indicates a Raynham birth, however Raynham was not broken off from Taunton until 1731.\n\nSept & Oct 1747 – Hewing Timber and working with the carpenters at the forge (one of them being Thomas Crossman) – Account Book [Old Colony Historical Society], Iron Works records for the Taunton/Raynham area.\n\n1750 – Land purchased of Solomon Printice for 80 pounds by Pendelton Bretton of Easton and Briant Hall of Raynham; land in Easton containing 40 acres that was laid out 30 Sept 1713 to James Phillips of Taunton on the 50 acre division that lies near the land of John Selleson [?] also another tract of land that lies next to this land in whole 90 acres; land conveyed to Printice as warranted by heirs of James Phillips – witnesses Abigail & Katherine Leonard [Bristol Deeds 37:536]\n\n1750 – Living next to Elijah Leonard in Raynham, MA – Account Book [Old Colony Historical Society]\n\n1751 – Owns a Shop – Account Book [Old Colony Historical Society] Several entries 1750 – 2 in regards to services as a cordwainer.\n\n1751 – Account book kept by the Leonard Family of Norton; References a brother several times, Brian receives credit for the services of the brother, no name given. – Account Book [Old Colony Historical Society]\n\nAugust 1751 – married Abiah Crossman (Abiah Crossman; Female; Birth: 28 AUG 1726 Taunton , Bristol, Massachusetts; Death: 15 FEB 1814; Father: Thomas Crossman; Mother: Johanna; (Joannah Crossman has a sister Alice Leonard and parents are Thomas Leonard and Joanna all of Raynham – per probate records) Spouse: Brian Hall; Marriage: 1751; Sealing to Spouse: 01 OCT 1953; Film Number: 458137)\n\nOctober 1751 – Signs a petition against a new road in Raynham, MA – Raynham Town Records\n\n18 May 1752 – Brian Hall saw that the 2 calves skins and one dog skin which he brought from Swanzey today comes to 4-10-00 at tenor [Old Colony Historical Society, Iron Works Account Book]\n\nSeptember 26, 1752 – child of Brian Hall died in Raynham, MA – Vital Records\n\n1752- Brian Hall – Distribution of Iron Shares [Old Colony Historical Society]\n\nDecember 9, 1752 – Pendleton Britton and Brian Hall buy land in Easton, MA.\n\nApril 1753 – Brian Hall buys land in Raynham, MA from Alice Leonard, give several names including land bordered by Nehimiah and Nathanial Hall, filed 1758 [Bristol Deeds 43:115]\n\nAugust 16, 1753 – son Isaac Hall born in Boston according to historical accounts – birth not located in Vital Records.

His father moved to Norton before Isaac entered college, and ever after resided there. Mr. Hall studied law, and died soon after entering upon his professional career. For more particulars of him, see Funeral Sermon by Rev. Sylvester Holmes. His tombstone, in the ” Norton common graveyard,” informs us that he was an attorney-at-law, and that he died Dec. 14, 1779, aged twenty six. In the Providence Gazette of January 29 1780, may be seen a notice of him which says: “His learning, abilities as a lawyer, and strict adherence to the principles of virtue, rendered him dear to his friends, an honor to his profession, and highly esteemed by all his acquaintance.”\n\nHistorical accounts read: A year or more after their marriage and the death of their first child, they moved to Boston (WHY??), living there a few years, during which time their eldest son Isaac was supposedly born (no birth record located).

Is there any evidence of this other than historical town/county histories and published genealogies?\n\nWho is Silence Hall? “1758 – Sale of Pew in Raynham Church, Brian Hall sells to Elijah Leonard his pew in Westward part of the church. Witnesses: Thomas Crossman and Silence Hall”. Could she be the wife of Jacob Woodward named as “brother in law” in Brian’s will and Brian’s biological sister?\n\nI leave to my brother in law Jacob Woodward and Silence [?] his wife to them their heirs an assigns forever real estate lying in North Providence in the state of Rhode Island excepting only ten acres to be measured of according to Quantity & Quatily [?] which I have herein given to my son Issac.\n\nBrian’s wife Abiah Crossman was a 2nd cousin of Jacob Woodward – Robert Crossman was their g-grandfather. Would this cause Brian to refer to Jacob as brother-in-law?\n\nMary Britton’s brother William Britton jr. married Sarah Woodward (daughter of Robert Woodward and Hannah Briggs) who was a first cousin to Jacob Woodward (son of Ezekial Woodward and Sarah____). Would this cause Brian to refer to Jacob as brother-in-law?\n\nWho is the Brian Hall Woodward b. 1778 (year of Brian Hall’s death); d. 1798 and buried North Providence at Hopkins burial ground (grave #35) next to Capt Richard Hutchins (grave #36)? All other surrounding stones blank. (Rhode Island Roots, Volumes 13-15 – Rhode Island Genealogical Society, 1987 – Registers of births, etc) – could this be a child of Silence and Jacob?\n\nNorth Providence land deeds for the Halls and Woodwards were examined the only connection seems to be:\n\nRuth Woodward in N. Providence deeds pg 199 (1748 or 1768?) mentions brothers Jacob & Paul Woodward and father Ezekiel (will A774, 1760 N Prov.). One of the witnesses signs as Mary Hall. Brian did not have any children named Mary.\n\nA Providence deed from 1821 [book 5 pg 86] mentions a Jacob Woodward, Mary Woodward and Henrietta Hutchins selling land. Brian Hall (Brian’s grandson through his son Brian) signs as a witness. He later marries Henrietta Hutchins daughter of Capt. Richard Hutchins (the man buried with Brian Hall Woodward) and Henrietta Woodward. Could Henrietta Woodward also be a daughter of Jacob and Silence?\n\nAccording to death indexes for Silence & Jacob – Silence was born abt 1740 – 13 years younger than Brian. So John 3rd would still be alive in 1740 if she is a sister! If correct, the age difference is further evidence that the John Hall who fathered Brian could not be the John Hall who married Hannah Williams!\n\nWOODWARD Jacob, in 85th year, at Providence, Aug. 5, 1822 (birth about 1737).\n\nWOODWARD Silence, wife of Jacob, at North Providence, in 76th year, Nov. 26, 1816 (birth abt 1740).\n\n*** Update 22 January 2022 – “The First Congregational Church History, Volume 1” has been digitized by the Raynham Public Library. A baptism for Silence Hall is on page 160 :“September 27, 1741 Silence Dean the daughter of Mr. Abiel Dean was baptized the same day Silence Hall the daughter of Mary Hall was baptized.” But…it raises more questions – Why isn’t her father listed? – was he dead, or was she illegitimate born to a widowed Mary, or was he simply not a church member, or did he run off…..\n\nWho is Brian’s “brother” listed in Leonard’s account books? Full brother? Half brother? Husband of Brian’s sister?\n\nWhen Brian died, why was Ephraim Burr of Norton selected as guardian to Brian’s minor children, Brian and Silas? How was he related or associated with Brian (or Abiah)? partial probate transcription here: will\n\nThe Legal Genealogist’s blog tells us that Burr was likely not a close relative of Brian’s:\n\n…..But when property was involved, the preference was overwhelmingly for the nearest male relative who couldn’t inherit from the child to serve as guardian.

He appears to be a Yale graduate and the son of Amos Hall and Betty Briant. It is unclear if he is the same man who participated in the war of 1812.\n\nWhen my g-grandmother Georgianna (Hughes/Clough) Hall passed in 1964, a Cecelia Stevenson sent condolences from Indianapolis, Indiana. Next to her name, in my grandmother’s handwriting, was written “relative”. Something about this intrigued me. I searched for cousin Cecelia “Celia” Perry/Parry for years and am finally able to share a small part of her story.\n\nIn Georgianna’s address book was written:\n\n• Mrs. L.A. Stevenson – Celia Cynthia [address crossed off] Indiana.\n\n• C.K. Stevenson – 1320 N. Delaware Indianapolis Indiana\n\nI never put two and two together! I hadn’t realized this was my missing Celia Parry!\n\nCecelia “Celia” was born 12 August 1899 in Galeton, Pennslyvania to George Perry/Parry and Elizabeth “Lizzie” Phillips. She was a first cousin to my g-grandmother, Georgianna. Georgianna’s mom, Kittie (Perry) Hughes/Clough/Shipman, and Celia’s father George were siblings.\n\nLizzie (Phillips) Parry\n\nCelia’s mother, Lizzie, gave birth to at least eight children (censuses indicate nine), three of whom died in 1891 of diphtheria. At the time of their illness/death, Celia’s father, George, had deserted the family, to marry another woman (story here). Her mother’s sister, Miss Alice Phillips, chanced exposing herself to the illness and cared for the family. Lizzie and her eldest son Daniel, age eight, recovered, but the younger children—George, Alice, and Arthur—died. When George’s second wife learned he was a bigamist, he disappeared.\n\nBy 1893, George and Lizzie reunited and relocated to Minneapolis, Minnesota where their children William “Will” and Elizabeth “Bessie” were born. George’s mother Ann (Jones) Perry Evans passed in 1896 and her obituary places George in Oregon (no other evidence places the family there). By 1897 the family removed to Galeton, Pennsylvania, near George’s sister Cordelia (Perry) Palmer/Spoor, where their last two children, Celia and Frederick “Fred” were born.\n\nBy 1910, they were living in Westmoreland, Oneida, New York. When Celia was thirteen (5 April 1913), her 50 year old mom died in Oriskany, Oneida, New York, cause unknown. It seems the family then returned to Pennsylvania.\n\nOn 30 March 1916, at age sixteen, Celia gave birth to baby boy in Williamsport, Lycoming, Pennsylvania. She named him Richard [my Autosomal DNA matches that of Richard’s daughter]. The name of the boy’s father is unknown, but based on family lore, it is possibly something like “Schwartz”.\n\nThe boy was adopted by Henry and Jennie (Dykeman) Seltz of Galeton, Pennsylvania. Perhaps Celia selected the adoptive family; they were neighbors of her aunt Cordelia’s step-son, Leland Spoor (she likely thought of Leland as a first cousin; his mother died when he was two and Aunt Cordelia raised him).\n\nCelia’s photo album (now with her granddaughter) includes photos of little Richard and Mrs Seltz. The Seltzs must have kept in touch!\n\nBy 1920, Celia was a “roomer” in the home of Eugene and Laura McKee in Jamestown, Chautauqua, New York. She was employed at a garment factory as a machine sewer. On 1 March 1920, she married her fellow roomer, Phillip Lee Kessler, a street car railroad conductor, later a mechanic, son of Charles Kessler and Nellie Phillips (no known relation to Celia’s mother). At that time Celia worked at a glove factory. The marriage was short lived; the pair divorced 12 Aug 1921. Despite the divorce, Celia’s nickname “Kess”, stuck for the remainder of her life.\n\nWhen Celia’s dad passed in 1923, she signed as the informant on his death certificate, listing her residence as Galeton, Pennsylvania.\n\nHer father’s obituary, lists Cincinnati, Ohio as her place of residence. She was enrolled at the Good Samaritan Nursing School in Cincinnati, Ohio, and graduated in 1924. After graduation, she took a position in the same town as a nurse for a private family, rooming with fellow classmate and good friend, Marie Barlow and a 59-year old widow named Mary Sohngen. The three paid a total of $75/month rent.\n\nCelia next married Lincoln Augustus Stevenson, son of Frank Stevenson and Catherine Freil. In 1932 they were living in Columbia, South Carolina. They had a daughter, Mary Cynthia “Cynthia” Stevenson, born 12 Sept 1933 in Indiana. She was likely close to Lincoln’s 10 year old son by a prior marriage, Richard Lincoln Stevenson, as he was named in her obituary. Cynthia’s birth certificate mistakenly lists her mother’s maiden name as Kessler.\n\nAlthough Celia and Lincoln were divorced by 1940, she continued to use the name Mrs. Celia K. Stevenson for the remainder of her life; Celia appears in the 1940 census as a nurse at St. Francis Hospital in Beech Grove, Marion, Indiana. She worked 48 weeks that year and made a total of $660 (she also received more than $50 from other unnamed sources). Eight year old Mary Cynthia was not found in 1940, but when her father died in 1950, she was listed as resident of Indianapolis.\n\nCynthia’s daughter offers the following detail:\n\nDue to WWII, my mom Cynthia “Cindy” was sent to a Catholic boarding school, St. Joseph’s Academy, in Tipton, Indiana. She became a Nun but never did her final vows. She went to St Mary ‘s Notre Dame and then to St Louis University where she met her husband (“my dad”).\n\n.\n\nCindy has another half brother- Young Stevenson, of Montgomery Alabama. He has five kids and lots of Grandkids!\n\nCecelia never drove a car and lived for years at 1320 N. Delaware, Indianapolis ( I still remember that address); a studio apartment. She inspired me to become a nurse.\n\nWellsville, Allegany, New York.\n\nIn 1947 Celia’s aunt Alice E. Phillips (her mother Lizzie’s sister) died. Alice had never married and did not have children. There was a four year court proceeding over her will – numerous newspaper notices offer details of her sister and brother arguing over the inheritance – A number of them named “Cecelia Parry Stevenson” as a heir (she was not one of those directly involved in the suit).\n\nIn Summary:\n\nCelia’s mother Lizzie (Parry) had siblings Alice, Arthur, Lena (Hatcliffe), Mary Ann (Valentine), Rose (McBride) and Fred. At the time of the trial, only Lena and Fred were living. Alice never married, worked hard, lived frugally and left a sizable estate. She had changed her original will, which was essentially a 50/50 split between Arthur and Lena (with Arthur’s portion in a trust, paying him income for life) to one which left the majority of the estate to Arthur.\n\n.\n\nLena contested this, saying he forced Alice to revise the will, utilizing his attorney (just six months after the initial will was written) and supplying his own associates as witnesses. She further claimed Arthur was a drunk who rarely worked, who physically and orally abused Alice, forged signatures on checks to draw money from her bank account and threatened her with “the bug house” if she didn’t modify the will to be in his favor. Alice feared him; he kept her isolated from friends and family as she was not mobile in her last years.\n\n.\n\nThe testimony of the witnesses tended to prove these facts. Arthur admitted that he threatened Alice with the “bug house”. Lena won the case, the jury having found that the will was procured through undue influence. Arthur appealed and lost. According to newspapers, the case was settled in 1951.\n\n.\n\nRead details here, type Alice Phillips in the search box\n\n.\n\nIn 1953, Celia served on a panel at St. Vincent’s entitled “The Nurse as the Priest’s Assistant in the Spiritual Care of the Sick”.\n\nIn 1954, Celia’s picture was in the local paper, as an attendee at a private duty nurse’s brunch (likely on the far right).\n\nIn 1968, she was a prize winner at the Grand Opening of a local shopping center!\n\nOn 1 May 1977, Celia’s brother Fred died in Conneaut Lake (shore), Pennsylvania. She never mentioned other siblings to her grandchildren. Although one grandchild, while in college was in touch with her brother Daniel’s daughter, Elizabeth I. “Bette” (Parry) VanDurme in New York.\n\nThe whereabouts of Celia’s sister Elizabeth “Bessie” Parry (who married John Burge) and brother William “Will” Parry are unknown. The last source mentioning them was in probate notices, related to their Aunt Alice, in 1951. Her sister might be the Elizabeth Burge who died 8 Dec 1966 and is buried with John Burge (d. 1978), at Pleasant Valley Cemetery, Hammondsport, Steuben County, New York.\n\nCelia died 2 December 1997 in Greenwood, Johnson, Indiana at the age of 98. The inscription on her tombstone reads: “MRS SANTA CLAUS”. The cemetery office and local historical society could not provide further information about this title.\n\n.\n\nUPDATE: Celia’s granddaughter writes: “We called her Grandma Cel”….”By the way, ” Mrs. Santa Claus” was because she always sent cards at Christmas signed that way. I think I was a teenager before I realized it was her!”\n\nCelia’s children\n\nSon Richard Dykeman Seltz, who she gave up for adoption, married Mary Johnson and had four children. He died 12 March 1996 in Kissimmee, Polk, Florida.\n\nRichard Dykeman Seltz, 79, of 728 Yucatan Court, Poinciana, died March 12. Born in Williamsport, Pa., he moved to Poinciana from Galeton, Pa., in 1986. He was a self-employed glove manufacturer and a member of the Masonic Lodge of Couldersport, Pa., and the Elks Club of Kissimmee. Survivors include his wife, Mary; sons, Richard H., Houston, Texas, Scott J., Chatham, N.J.; daughter, Jeanne Wenzel, Jacksonville, Anne Seltz, Rockville, Md.; eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Fisk Funeral Home, St. Cloud, was in charge of arrangements.\n\nDaughter, Mary Cynthia Stevenson, married a man named Charles Ford and had three children. She died 9 July 1989 in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nMary Cynthia Ford, 55, Sarasota, died July 8, 1989. She was born Sept. 12, 1933 in Fort Benjamin Harrison, Ind. and came to this are three years ago from Pelham, NY. Survivors include two sons, Christopher of Northport, Conn., and Carl of Westport, Conn., a daughter, Cathleen of Richmond, Va., two brothers, Richard Stevenson of Sarasota and Young Stevenson of Montgomery, Ala., her mother Cecelia Stevenson of Indianapolis, and a granddaughter. Services will be at 11 a.m. today at Toale Brothers Funeral Home, Gulf Gate Chapel. Memorial donations may be made to The American Cancer Society, 3807 Bond Place, Sarasota, 34232.\n\nStepson Richard Lincoln Stevenson died 19 April 2010 in Sarasota, Florida\n\nRichard Lincoln Stevenson, 87, of Sarasota, formerly of Fort Wayne, Ind., died April 19, 2010. Services will be at 1 p.m. Thursday at Sarasota National Cemetery.\n\nHe is survived by his son, Alan; children by marriage Mark and Marian Kennell, Karl and Becky Kennell and Kathleen and Jon Sutter; grandchildren Lydia Mortensen, Michelle Sexton, Erin Stevenson, Alex, Katie and Trevor Kennell; four great-grandchildren, sister Patricia and Ed Epperson, brother Young and Susan Stevenson; and several nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his loving wife, Shirley; a son David; a sister, Cynthia Ford; and a brother, Sherrad Denley.\n\nRichard was just 19 when he enlisted in cadet school and became a World War II pilot flying in the Pacific. He flew a C-47 called “Gooney Bird” as a member of the legendary Jungle Skippers in the 317th Troop Carrier Group, which later became the 375th. He followed his retirement from the Air Force Reserves in 1956 with a 30-year career as an accomplished jeweler and gemologist. He was also an award-winning gardener, who could literally make anything grow, especially his beloved orchids. He will forever be remembered for his stories that touched the hearts of so many.\n\nMemories\n\nCelia kept in touch with her college roommate, Marie. Marie’s son recently shared his memories and photos:\n\nI knew her (1950s – 1990s) as a very caring, wonderful person. She was very close friend, originally to my parents. Kess trained with my mother, Marie Barlow (her maiden name), at The Good Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing in Cincinnati, OH.\n\n.\n\nMy mother, before she met my father, came from Grafton West Virginia, to Cincinnati to become a nurse. Kess, my mother and another nurse actually shared an apartment near the Hospital/ school for several years in the 1920s.\n\n.\n\nUnfortunately, much of my info about her is from memories now. My older brothers, who have all passed, may have had pictures and a more complete history of her. But the pictures they had did not survive the years. I have little knowledge of the marriages, or children. (Back in the 30, 40s and 50s, children did not talk unless a parent said okay) So the adults kept private issues among themselves. Later in life, she did talk about a daughter and son-in-law and their children, but I don’t recall details now. I believe Kess actually survived her daughter by a year or so. The daughter had a difficult medical condition, I believe. Kess died at a Convalescent Retirement home near Indianapolis.\n\n.\n\nOver the years, Kess came to visit when she could, but the last 20 – 30 years of her life were very difficult. Her mobility was very difficult due the pain, arthritis, I think. From about 1940s to 1990s, she lived in a modest apartment on N. Delaware Ave in Indianapolis, IN with a major hospital nearby. She worked there at one time, I think. I visited her a few time over the years. She came to Cincinnati for various holidays and events, including the funerals of my mother and father, for my college graduation, 1968, and later for my wedding in 1978.\n\nShe is buried in Section J, Lot 576, grave #8, Washington Park East Cemetery.\n\nKess’ grand-children could be still living. I am thinking also that they are part of the reason for Mrs Santa Claus. I believe, there were times when Kess would send small gifts or notes to children and others, anonymously.\n\n.\n\nAnother thought about Kess, relates to her Garden. I believe she was a volunteer at the President Harrison Home. Volunteers would help with the Gardens, among other things, there. That home was nearby on N Delaware Ave. – http://www.bhpsite.org\n\nUPDATE: And the COOLEST part of this whole story??? After this was posted, Celia’s six grandchildren, three by her son Richard “Dick” who she gave up for adoption and three by her daughter Cynthia “Cindy” have met online!! Happy dance! The best part of genealogy – connecting cousins!!\n\nError in Online Trees and FindAGrave\n\nSeveral online trees have Celia linked to Curt Stevenson and Lydia Fullmer. These are the wrong parents! This Celia’s maiden name was Stevenson. She married Frank Meals and died in 1978 in Pennsylvania.\n\nCensuses (right click and open image in another tab to see a larger version)\n\n1900\n\n1910\n\n1920\n\n1930\n\n1940\n\nNo Story Too Small has issued a New Year’s Challenge: “Have one blog post each week devoted to a specific ancestor. It could be a story, a biography, a photograph, an outline of a research problem — anything that focuses on one ancestor.”\n\nMy genealogical journey began in 2008, with my g-grandmother Georgianna Hall (her married name), who died in 1964, at 82. All that was known of her was that she was born in Rome, Oneida, New York, about 1882. New York did not require birth registration until 1882, and full compliance was not reached until 1915. The Municipal Archives believes that up to 25% of pre-1910 births were never registered.\n\nI hired a professional researcher in New York, but no birth record was found; her 1904 marriage record does place her birth about 1882 in Rome, NY and names her parents as Kitty Perry and Frank D. Clough.\n\nHer Social Security Application (SS-5), completed in her own handwriting, 58 years later, offers a birth date of 13 Oct 1881, and names the same birth place and parents [except mom is Kittie E. vs Kitty].\n\nHer obituary, published in the Malden Evening News, after her 12 Feb 1964 death, concurs.\n\nThings began to fall into place. I easily traced the Welsh origins of her mom, Kittie Perry, locating hundreds of records & ancestors through the guidance of cousins, who I met through the Ancestry.com online tree message service.\n\nBut her dad, Frank D. Clough, was a mystery and my first “brick wall”.\n\nKittie and Frank’s marriage was registered in Frankfort, Herkimer County, New York on 18 Feb 1889 [anybody thinking, that is seven years after Georgianna’s reported birth? – I will admit, as a genealogy “newbie”, I didn’t, it was my first experience contacting a town clerk, and I was excited to get a response with the information I was seeking – Frank’s place of birth and parent’s names!!! – other details were insignificant].\n\n* When you order a vital record from a town clerk’s office, many times they transcribe the information from the original books on to a form. These days, I always ask for a copy of the original, town clerks are human and can make transcription errors (especially when it comes to interpreting old handwritten records). In this case, I ordered the record in 2009 and hadn’t known to ask for the original. Thanks to Gina Bellino, at the Frankfort, New York town clerk’s office, for taking the photos below with her iPhone.\n\nFrank was listed as a mechanic and resident of Frankfort, born in Bath, New York to R.C. Clough and Ellen Colburn about 1858. “Number of marriages” was left blank.\n\nHe was listed in the 1899 Frankfort City Directory as a Carpenter.\n\nMy next discovery was a notice published seven years later in the Lowell Sun [Massachusetts] dated Saturday, 14 March 1896:\n\nTHE LOWELL DAILY SUN:\n\nTo the Honorable Justices of the Superior court within and for the County of Middlesex: Respectfully libels and represent Kittie E. Clough of Lowell. In said county, that she was married in form of law not in legal effect to Frank Clough now of Seattle, Wash., and there afterwards your libellant and the said Frank Clough lived together as husband and wife afterwards until she learned and was informed that said Frank Clough at the time he married your petitioner had another wife living from whom he was never divorced, thus rendering his marriage to your petitioner void. Wherefore your petitioner prays that, a decree be entered declaring said marriage between her and said Frank Clough null and void from the beginning. Dated this first day of November A.D. 1895.\n\nKITTIE E. CLOUGH\n\nBack in 2009, I emailed Elizabeth Bouvier, Head of Archives, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, seeking more information. She responded “Kittie filed a libel #1706 at Middlesex County Superior Court in 1896, it was continued to Dec 27, 1897 and dismissed on call without prejudice, I checked the Indices up to 1910 and there is no further entry”.\n\nDead end.\n\nOn FamilySearch.org, I located an unnamed child, born 11 Sept 1856, in Bath, New Hampshire [not New York as the marriage record indicated] to R. Clement Clough and Ellen Colburn and recorded in 1906 [50 years after the birth]. I suspect this is the record of Frank’s birth.\n\nIn 1860 & 1870 Frank was enumerated in Bath, New Hampshire as a member of the family of Richard Clement and Ellen Clough. He is not with them in 1880. He appears to have had four brothers Eugene, Squires, Harry and Richard Clement Jr.\n\nTurns out, prior to 1880, Frank, a House Carpenter, had married Lucy Elizabeth Chase, daughter of Moses Chase and Sarah, and was living nearby in Bath. I have not located a marriage or divorce record.\n\nOn 23 July 1880, Lucy gave birth to their first child, Bert Squires Clough. The second child, Ira “Harry” Moses Clough followed on 16 June 1882.\n\nThat’s when it hit me. It’s unlikely that Frank was the father of Georgianna, born 13 Oct 1881, in Rome, New York if he had children in 1880 and 1882 in Bath, New Hampshire, 270 miles away, in an era before the automobile! Then I realized Georgianna was seven when he married Kittie!\n\nSure enough, Kittie was previously married. The 11 Aug 1880 edition of the Herkimer Democrat reports that on 4 Aug 1880, Kitty Perry, of Rome, married John Hughes of Ilion, at the residence of officiating clergyman Reverend Albert F. Lyle, in German Flatts.\n\nGeorgianna was enumerated in the 1892 New York State census as Georgia A. Hughes, age 11, living in Frankfort with her grandmother and step-grandfather James and Ann (Jones) Perry Evans.\n\nShe appears in several newspaper articles as Georgianna Hughes [W. C. Perry is Kittie’s brother, Kittie May Palmer is Kittie’s niece, daughter of her sister Cordelia]:\n\nUtica Morning Herald, August 24 1896: Miss Georgiana Hughes of Frankfort, who has been visiting her mother at Lowell, Mass., has returned, and accompanied by Miss Kittie May Palmer of Frankfort, is a guest of Mr. and Mrs. W[illiam] C. Perry of 414 West Dominick Street [Rome].\n\nRome Semi Weekly Citizen, September 1, 1896: Miss Georgianna Hughes of Lowell, Mass., and Miss Kittie M. Palmer of Frankfort, NY , are visiting their uncle, W. C. Perry, 414 West Dominick street.\n\nRome Daily Sentinel, October 1, 1902 – Mrs. Georgianna Hughes who has been visiting at the home of W.C. Perry has returned to her home in Boston.\n\nSomething didn’t add up. On 1 October 1902, Georgianna is still using the surname Hughes, a few days before Kittie married her 3rd husband Frank Shipman, so presumably, Clough is long gone from their lives. But in 1904, Georgianna reports her maiden name as Clough when she marries.\n\nWhat became of her father Hughes [death or divorce?] If Clough was a bigamist, and no longer with Kittie, why would she begin using his name long after the break up? If she wanted a new surname, why not Shipman?\n\nKittie’s bigamy/annulment case of 1896 was dismissed. I have been unable to locate Clough in the 1900 census. Frank’s first wife remarried William C. Austin in 1886. In 1900, the pair was residing in Bath, with Frank’s sons Burt and Ira, and two daughters fathered by Austin. Frank’s parents were still in Bath. His mother, Ellen, reported that she had given birth to five children and that three were living. Siblings Squires and Harry were deceased, so technically Frank should be alive. I searched city directories across the US. Nothing.\n\nI made my first genealogy trip to Bath (a charming town with one of New Hampshire’s few remaining covered bridges).\n\nFrank’s parents and brothers are all buried in Bath, I found their graves (my first FindAGrave posting). No Frank. I did learn from the town clerk that Clough is pronounced “Cluff” in Bath [note that in other parts, some do pronounce it as “Clow”]. When I returned home, I searched the various databases again using Cluff and Cl*u* (Cl*u* should pick up Clough and Cluff in databases that use a “*” as a wildcard symbol). I searched online death records between 1896 and 1900. Nothing.\n\nI found Kittie in Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1900, living with several male boarders (her soon to be third husband among them), reported as “widowed”.\n\nIgnoring all conflicting information, I used this one fact to conclude that Clough had died between 1896 and 1900, perhaps on the West Coast, as Kittie’s 1896 case claimed a Seattle residence. The death just wasn’t available in indexes or records online.\n\nHis son Ira married on 28 April 1900. Frank was listed as father and a Carpenter, but his residence was left blank [the residence of the three remaining parents was identified].\n\nMy theory was that Frank and Kittie reconciled, she dropped the case, then he died tragically, leaving her a widow. His parents and children were perhaps unaware, which is why his mother reported him to be living in 1900 and Ira left his residence blank on the marriage record. I surmised that Georgianna took the surname Clough as a gesture of remembrance and respect (since she likely never knew her birth father).\n\nIt bothered me that I hadn’t located the death record, but it could have occurred anywhere! I added the note to my Ancestry.com tree, and 650 other folks promptly copied the death range and added my theory as “fact” to their own trees [okay so I am exaggerating a little]. “Case Closed” – 5 years ago.\n\nThen I decided to take on the “52 Ancestors Challenge”. I had planned my ancestor of week #10 to be Kittie (Perry) Hughes Clough Shipman. As I began to write, I realized how many details were missing. As part of the process, I reopened my “Frank Clough file”.\n\nI began by emailing Elizabeth Bouvier, at the Supreme Judicial Court again, this time requesting copies of the actual documentation related to Kittie’s case in Middlesex County. The response was shocking! “Kittie filed a libel at Essex County Superior Court on grounds of desertion – 1902 divorce final.\n\nWhat? I knew Kittie moved to another county, but I never thought to search Essex County for a divorce, I just assumed all records were held in Middlesex, their residence when Frank disappears! In any case, you don’t divorce a dead guy! She presumed Frank was living in 1902!\n\nI reviewed the records I had collected. In 1902, when Kittie married Shipman, she specified it was her 3rd marriage. I didn’t notice the “(D)” on the record indicating she was divorced. The register header instructed the registrar to record those divorced or widowed. All individuals with more than one marriage, were marked with either “(W)” or “(D)”. Of course she would tell the 1900 census enumerator that she was a widow. Divorce/abandonment was embarrassing and none of his business!\n\nI follow the Legal Genealogist’s blog (http://www.legalgenealogist.com/), and now I realize the importance of understanding the terms used in our ancestor’s records. The case regarding the annulment was “dismissed on call without prejudice” – “without prejudice” means that Kittie could reopen the case at some point in the future. If Frank were dead, the option wouldn’t be necessary, right? The case would have been “dismissed on call with prejudice”.\n\nI searched for a Frank Clough/Cluff born between 1850 and 1860 in New Hampshire, in the 1860-1900 censuses, vitals, the online city directories and other records. There were at least 8 individuals of the same name, but one stood out. Frank D. Clough, a carpenter, born in Sept 1858/9 in New Hampshire, with parents born in New Hampshire.\n\nThis particular Frank D. Clough, born about Sept 1858, married around 1892, possibly in San Francisco, California [according to a son’s marriage record], Frederika “Freida” Martins/Martens born about 1862 in Germany. No marriage record has been found there or elsewhere, using online sources. Many San Francisco records were destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire. While some were rerecorded at a later date, names similar to Clough/Martens were not located in online indexes, the pair likely had relocated to New Jersey. (http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/sfdata.htm#vindex)\n\nThe couple had two children, said to be born in Jersey City, New Jersey, John Martin/Marten Clough born 29 Aug 1895 and George Clough born about Jan 1898.\n\nFindings include (from Ancestry.com unless noted otherwise):\n\n1895 Jersey City, New Jersey, City Directory – Frank D. Cluff, carpenter, 840 Bramhall av, Jersey City.\n\n1895 Birth Record, DELAYED filing, (email from the New Jersey State Archives), Child: John Clough; Date of Birth: Aug. 29, 1895; Place of Birth: Jersey City, Hudson County Parents: Frank Clough & Friedericke Martens. [The delayed birth record states that his parents were married in San Francisco, CA.]\n\n1898 Jersey City, New Jersey, City Directory – Frank D. Cluff, carpenter, 43 Myrtle av, Jersey City.\n\n1899 Jersey City, New Jersey, City Directory – Frank D. Cluff, carpenter, 164 Fulton av, Jersey City.\n\n1900 census – Frank Cluff, 703 Ave D, Bayonne Ward 2, Hudson, New Jersey, born Sept 1859, married 8 years, carpenter born Massachusetts (parents born Massachusetts) living with wife Freda (37; born Germany; immigrated about 1881; has given birth to two children, both living), sons John (5) and George (2). They rent a home.\n\n1901 Jersey City, New Jersey, City Directory – Frank D. Cluff, carpenter, 154 Fulton av, Jersey City.\n\n1910 census – Frank D. Cluff, boarder at 1541 Broadway, Oakland, California; age 52; widowed; self employed carpenter (houses, etc.); born New Hampshire (parents born New Hampshire). The next two entries are boarders John (14) and George Cluff (12) born New Jersey (parents born New Hampshire/Germany).\n\n1920 census – Frank Clough, First Street, renters above the bakery, Bandon, Coos, Oregon; age 63; widowed; self employed house carpenter; born New Hampshire (parents born New Hampshire). Living with son George (22) who is a cook is a restaurant; born New Jersey (parents born New Hampshire/Germany).\n\n1923 Marriage Record (email from the New Jersey State Archives): John M. Clough to Dora H. Drewes: Date of Marriage: 10 Oct. 1923; Place of Marriage: Jersey City, Hudson Co. Parents: Frank D. Clough & Frieda Martens.\n\n1930 census – Frank B. Clough, Riverside Drive, Bandon, Coos, Oregon; age 72; widowed; no occupation; owns the home valued at $1,250; born New Hampshire (parents born New Hampshire).\n\n1940 census – Frank D. Clough, Riverside Drive, Bandon, Coos, Oregon; age 82; widowed; attended school to 8th grade; no occupation and “unable to work”; owns the home valued at $50; born New Hampshire; lived in the same place 5 years ago. Frank himself spoke with the census taker [the 1940 census specifies which household member spoke to the enumerator, likely meaning the information is correct].\n\n1941 Death indexes – Frank Clough, death date 18 Mar 1941, Coos County, Oregon.\n\n1941 FindAGrave.com – Obituary originally copied from the Western World by Paul and Jewell Shelton and shared here courtesy of the Bandon Museum and Historical Society.\n\n1941 Burial: Frank B. Clough, Father, IOOF Cemetery, Bandon, Coos County, Oregon, USA\n\n1946 Death Record (email from the New Jersey State Archives): Deceased: John Clough; age: 51 yrs; Date of Death: Nov. 8, 1946; Place of Death: St. Barnabas Hospital; Newark, Essex Co. Parents: Frank D. Clough & Fredericka Marten, Burial: Rosehill Crematory, Linden, NJ\n\nThere are a few inconsistencies. The 1900 census offers a Massachusetts birthplace (perhaps the informant knew he had relocated from Lowell, Massachusetts and assumed it to be his place of birth). The obituary lists a birthplace of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on 5 Sept 1858 [vs. 11 Sept 1856] . The obituary is a transcription. The birth record was created 50 years after the birth. Either could be mistaken. Frank was deceased; the writer may not have known the correct birth date and place. This same Frank, in 1940, self-reported a New Hampshire birth place. Whomever spoke with the census taker in 1910, 1920 and 1930 (likely Frank) reported New Hampshire. The gravestone and obituary lists a middle initial of “B”, many other records concur that his middle initial was “D”.\n\nThen there is still the mystery of Georgianna reporting a maiden name of Clough. In speaking to professional genealogist, Georgianna may have used the name Clough simply to gain a job and avoid discrimination. Clough was more “American” than Hughes. She may have been trying to separate herself from the family, attracted a better husband or job.\n\nPROBABLE FRANK CLOUGH AND KITTIE PERRY MARRIAGES, PARENTS, CHILDREN\n\nNow what….\n\n(1) Wait two weeks for the dismissed annulment and divorce case files (from Elizabeth Bouvier) – hopefully there are more clues to Frank’s whereabouts!\n\nUPDATE – “No file has been found for the Clough divorce – grounds of desertion. You may want to search the local Lynn newspapers for a notice of the case. Katherine would have had to file a notice in the local paper three times (December 1901) notifying Frank – whose residence was unknown – of the divorce libel. Then she would have gone back to court with the proof of the 3 notices and been granted the divorce — which was in January 1902.”\n\n(2) Search for a marriage between Frank D. Clough and Frederika “Freida” Martins/Martens, around 1892, possibly in New Jersey, California, Washington or Oregon; locations with which I am not familiar; Cyndi’s List (http://www.cyndislist.com/us/) and the Family Search Wiki (https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Main_Page) and A Genealogy Guide to Death Indexes (http://www.deathindexes.com/) will hopefully point me to the right direction. If Frank’s parents are named on the record, that will confirm he is “our guy”.\n\n(3) Request a copy of Frank’s original obituary from the Bandon Museum and Historical Society (to ensure it was transcribed properly); perhaps they have additional information.\n\n(4) Order a copy of Frank’s death certificate from Coos County, Oregon (I suspect the informant may not have known his parents names and birth location – but you never know). He was buried in the Odd Fellows Cemetery, implying he may have been a member of the Odd Fellows – I need to contact the cemetery as well as the local Odd Fellows Chapter to request historical records. The Presbyterian Church mentioned in the obituary may also be a source.\n\nUPDATE – the death certificate arrived and offers no additional information, the informant (who may not have known) reported a Pennsylvania birth.\n\n(5) Contact the Bath, New Hampshire town clerk to discover why the birth returns are dated 1906. Likely there are original record books that were transcribed 50 years later. If the original books exist, perhaps they could look to see if the transcription of the birth date is correct. Remember that the name on the birth record was blank. Unlikely, but Ellen may have had a sixth child, who coincidentally was born in September, two years earlier, and died soon after death (when reporting the number of children born to the census taker, children who died within a few days were sometimes not reported).\n\nUPDATE – The bath Town clerk had no further information.\n\n(6) Locate Frederika “Freida” Martins/Martens death certificate (likely between 1900-1910).\n\n(7) Seek out additional city directories to place Frank in the years from 1890-1920.\n\n(8) Look for land deeds and probate records for Frank (likely Georgianna is not named, but you never know).\n\n(9) Find descendants of Frank’s sons – one East Coast and one West Coast and compare their DNA.\n\nUPDATE – I am seeking an East Coast descendant of Frank’s sons Bert Squire Clough or Ira “Harry” Moses Clough or one of his uncle Henry Dearborn Clough or Carleton H Clough. Frank’s g-grandson on the West Coast agreed to test and his results are back! The 37 marker Y-DNA test matched several Clough testers with a genetic distance of 2-4 (likely not close enough to confirm that the same Frank fathered the East and West Coast boys).\n\nThe closest match (genetic distance of 2), shared his Ancestry.com tree with me here. If this tree is correct, the match is Thomas Clough born 29 May 1651 in Salisbury, Essex, Massachusetts, a son to John Clough (read of him here) who was the first to come here from England. It seems that Frank Clough who died in Oregon also descends from Thomas. This doesn’t “prove” that East Coast and West Coast Frank are one in the same, there could be two Franks born about the same year in New Hampshire who both descend from John, but it doesn’t disprove my theory!\n\nUPDATE 10 April 2017\n\nAs there appears to be no male East Coast descendant of Frank, who still holds the surname Clough, I turned to Autosomal DNA. I currently have two testers:\n\nThe first, Ken W., a great grandson of Frank D. Clough and Lucy Elizabeth Chase (the Frank born in Bath, New Hampshire).\n\nThe second, Robert C. a grandson of Frank D. Clough and Fredericka “Frieda” Martens (the Frank who died in Oregon).\n\nIf my theory is correct, Ken W. and Robert C. would be Half 1st cousins 1x removed. The ISOGG Wiki claims that with this type of relationship, they would be expected to match in the range of 75-360 cMs (centimorgans) or 212.50 cMs on average (3.125%) of their DNA (https://isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA_statistics)\n\nThe results are in, and Robert and Ken share 286 cMs!! This is well within the range. Of course there is always the possibility that they are related on a different ancestral line, but given that they were born and reside on opposite coasts, unlikely.\n\nNeither tester matches me or my uncle, thus offering credence to my theory that although my g-grandmother Georgianna used the surname Clough, Frank Clough was her stepfather and not bio-father.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n(1) When looking at a new record, transcribe it – notice and question every detail. Remember that all records may have misinformation because of a clerk error, someone remembering something wrong or intentionally lying to protect themselves or their privacy.\n\n(2) If you don’t understand something on a record (like “dismissed on call without prejudice”), figure out what it means – consider the year it was utilized – the 1882 definition may differ from the 2014 definition.\n\n(3) I only looked for Frank in the 1900 census. I never considered looking for him in 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940, since I assumed he was dead. At RootsTech a few weeks ago, Tom Jones advised us to look at the censuses for our ancestors in the census year before their birth (to place their parents)…in this case I should have searched records after 1900, since I had no direct evidence of death.\n\n(4) Always request the “original record”. In this case, Frank and Kittie’s marriage record was transcribed by the town clerk correctly, but that is not always the case. Transcriptions may be incorrect or incomplete.\n\n(5) Periodically review all the records you have for your “brick wall” ancestors. As your genealogy skills evolve, you will notice things that you hadn’t thought of 1, 2 or 5 years ago.\n\n(6) Keep a research log for each ancestor, so you recall where you looked and where you didn’t and when, so that you do not duplicate efforts or miss a record set that may name your ancestor.\n\n(7) Don’t just copy “facts” from other online Family Trees unless a source is attached. All those folks who copied Frank D. Clough’s death between 1896 and 1900 from my tree have it wrong! What are the chances that they will return and see my revised tree or this blog post?\n\n(8) Write about your ancestors; join the “52 week challenge” even if you do not post your story online. It is easy to collect records. Writing forces you to correlate, develop new theories and think about what you might be missing.\n\nHappy Hunting!!\n\nI will begin with my actual ancestry (in my opinion) based on the paper trail I have uncovered (using 32 3rd g-grandparents, sort of; I am making an educated guess on four of them and of course my DNA goes a lot further back than a 4-generation paper trail):\n\nIreland 6.25% Scotland 1.56% Wales 18.75% England 12.50% Canada (English) 9.38% Lithuania 25.00% France 1.56% Acadia (France) 25.00%\n\nIn summary: 75% Northern European (48.4% UK & 26.6% France) and 25% Eastern European (Lithuania).\n\nLast year, my mother, a cousin (a child of my paternal grandmother’s sister) and I tested our DNA at 23andme.\n\nThe surprise?? Add “trace of Native American” to the list!\n\nMy mother’s results: 0.2% East Asian & Native American on chromosome 14.\n\nMy cousin’s results: 0.2% East Asian & Native American (which could be on my side of the family or her father’s side to whom I am unrelated) on chromosome 9 and 14.\n\nMy results: 0.4% East Asian & Native American on chromosome 6 and 14.\n\nI will admit that I know very little about DNA, but it appears that I got .2% East Asian & Native American from my mother and .2% from my father. Since “cousins” don’t get the same DNA, it is difficult to assess if the Native American on my dad’s side is from his maternal or paternal line, without having other cousins test. Although my cousin and I match on chromosome 14, it happens to be within the same area that I match my mom. We don’t match on chromosomes 6 and 9, but it could be that we both inherited different DNA from our common Native ancestors.\n\nMy Ancestry.com DNA is a bit different, showing <1% Asia\n\nFTDNA shows 100% European +/- .01%\n\nDifferences with AncestryDNA might be due to their matching base pairs while FTDNA and 23andMe match using centiMorgans. 23andMe and FTDNA use different minimums for cutoffs which explains the differences between them and 23andme. The differences usually don’t occur between close relations, so perhaps I do have Native American Ancestry on both sides but back many generations.\n\nThen there is GEDMATCH (a free site where you can upload your DNA from any of the three testing companies to help get more matches – and it has some pretty neat comparison tools)- lots of choices, none of which I understand. I need fit in some study time! Here is one of the charts I created there.\n\nNext, I read Judy Russell’s blog post about DNA percentages, http://www.legalgenealogist.com/blog/2013/10/27/those-pesky-percentages/.\n\nShe says:\n\n“Forget them. They’re cocktail party conversation pieces — and little more. The science just isn’t there yet to back them up”.\n\nBummer. It would be fun to claim some Native American DNA. Luckily I found her blog post AFTER I went in search of my Native American Ancestry. My mother is 50% Acadian. I had “heard” that many Acadians married Mi’kmaq Indians. I hadn’t found any in my line, and hadn’t contemplated that we might have a Native American grandmother, but based on the DNA results, decided to work on expanding those lines.\n\nI do believe that I have found at least one Native American on my mother’s side.\n\nMy mother’s maternal grandfather was an Acadian, Pius (Paul) Roy(Roi/King). The line descends from Jean Roy (Roye/LeRoy) dit Laliberte born in St-Malo, France about 1648 and Marie Aubois, half Indian. They were married about 1686 in Acadie.\n\nThere is quite a bit of controversy among her descendants as to whether we can claim to be of Mi’kmaq descent. Her daughter Ann’s marriage record names her as Marie “Sauvagesse” (feminine form of sauvage, which translates to indian) and doesn’t specifically state that she was a Mi’kmaq.\n\nOne of my Acadian cousins had a great point, he surmises (shared with his permission): “Marie was married in Acadie and is presumed to be Mi’kmaq, as that was the tribe controlling that area around Port Royal, and because she is on that list of Mi’kmaq marriages. It is not absolute proof; she could have been a Huron, or even a captured Mohawk, who was integrated into the Mi’kmaq tribe, but even then she would be considered Mi’kmaq, as much as immigrants to the U.S. are thereafter considered Americans”.\n\nI am still learning, but there are many blog posts and books discussing the relationships between the Mi’kmaq and Acadians, Wikiedia offers some history: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi’kmaq\n\nMaybe a post for another day, but I find it interesting that many of my ancestors are intertwined throughout history.\n\nThe census of 1707 as per Delabat allowed the creation of a map that depicted the early families of the Melanson Settlement, along the Annapolis River, in Port Royal, Acadie , where Charles Melanson and Marie Dugas were the first to settle. Six farms were included, residents of five were Melanson descendants [note: Jean Belliveau married Melanson’s daughter Madeline and Alexandre Robichaud married daughter Ann*].\n\nMy Jean Roy dit Laliberte was the head of household of the 6th home. He and sauvagesse, Marie Aubois, lived in a home that was set back, near the forest’s edge, away from the rest. Roy was not a member of the Melanson family nor related to it by marriage. How he ended up as part of the settlement remains a mystery.\n\nFast forward 200 years and 5 generations to 27 December 1910, Gardner, Massachusetts. My mother’s grandfather Pius Roy married Laura Marie Melanson – their 5th g-grandparents were neighbors Jean & Marie (Aubois) Roy and Charles & Marie (Dugas) Melanson!\n\nThe two lines follow (click to view a larger version):\n\nPerhaps not all that unusual. Pius and Laura would each have 256 5th g-grandparents (128 pairs) and for many years Acadians typically intermarried. But unusual enough given the millions of people in the world. The Melanson Settlement is 512 miles from Gardner and the marriages occurred in a time period when transportation had not evolved!\n\nNotes:\n\n*Research Bulletin #250, “The Melanson Settlement (1664-1755) published by Canadian Minister of Environment.
