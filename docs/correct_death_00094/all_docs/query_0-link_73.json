He married (1) LUCY UTLEY 25 Dec 1815 in Jessamine County, Kentucky, daughter of WILLIAM UTLEY and MARY RAGLAND. She was born Abt. 1799 in Goochland County, Virginia, and Aft. 1860 in Missouri. He married (2) CHARLOTTE. She was born in Arkansas. He married (3) NANCY ELEANOR BURKE 24 Jul 1826 in Claiborne, OuachitaParish, Louisiana. She was born Abt. 1798 in South Carolina, and died Abt. 1870 in Farmerville, Union Parish, Louisiana.\n\nNotes for POWHATAN VALENTINE BOATRIGHT:\n\nPowhatan Valentine Boatright was born in Amherst Co VA on 13 July 1790, the son of John Joseph Boatright and Frances Elizabeth Tinsley. He had little or no education as a child, for later in life he could not sign his name.\n\nHe served in the army during the War of 1812, with his service being in the year 1814. Later in life he received a pension based upon this service. By 1815, he was in Jessamine County, Kentucky, where he married Lucy Utley on December 23. She was the daughter of William Utley. The next year she published a newspaper ad indicating that he had abandoned her. She stated that she would not be responsible for his debts and warned other women to beware of him.\n\nIn 1816, Lucy \"Boteright\" advertised for her missing husband, Powhatan \"Boteright\", and later she again advertised that she would not be responsible for the debts of her missing husband. It is not known if Powhatan deserted her, or, if perhaps he had traveled west of the Mississippi River after his marriage, looking for a place to settle, and remained gone for longer than expected.\n\nIn any case, by 1818 Powhatan Boatright was living in what later became Lawrence County, AR, and his eldest child, John Boatright, was born there in that year. As a resident of Lawrence County, Powhatan was commissioned as an ensign in the Third Arkansas Militia on 10 July 1820. Shortly afterwards, he moved to Independence County, for he was commissioned as a First Lieutenant in the Seventh Regiment of Arkansas Militia on 21 September 1824. By 1826, he had moved to north Louisiana, settling in the area that became Claiborne Parish in 1828. He married Mrs. Nancy Eleanor Burke, a widow, there on 24 July 1826.\n\nPowhatan Boatright bought government land in northern Ouachita Parish Louisiana on 3 November 1836, and over the next 20 years, he gradually bought adjoining tracts from the government. He had moved from Claiborne Parish to his new plantation by 1839. In that year Union Parish was created from Ouachita, and Powhatan's new farm was in central Union Parish, near the present-day community of Zion Hill.\n\nPowhatan seems to have been quite a character. He came from Virginia to Arkansas and stayed there awhile including enlisting 21 Sep 1824, Commissioned as 1st Lt, Arkansas State Militia. 1830 he was in the Census for Claiborne, Louisiana, and on 14 Oct 1835 purchased land near Calhoun, Louisiana and on 3 NOV 1836 Purchased land at Zion Hill, Louisiana. August 1845, Powhatan Boatright was on a committee of members of the Zion Hill Baptist Church in Union Parish, Louisiana to select a sight for the construction of a new church building. This committee reported their choice in September 1845. The church and cemetery are located near Powhatan's farm. Powhatan Boatright had five sons to loose their lives in southern rebellion.\n\nThere is some uncertainty as to whether Powhatan was the son of John James and Elizabeth Boatwright, but both William E. Boatright and Norman Hurd Ricker support the fact that he was.\n\nHe enlisted in Captain Parke Bailey's company of the Virginia Militia on 02/28/1814 in Cumberland County. He transferred to Captain John Cole's company on 03/25/1814 and was discharged on 06/29/1814. He applied for and received a Pension on October 3, 1873. He was also commissioned a 1st Lt. in the 7th Regiment, Arkansas Militia on September 21, 1824.\n\nIn 1836 he owned 500 acres of land in Union Parish, Louisiana, near the Arkansas line. Records indicate that he was an elected Police Juryman (County Commissioner) in 1841 and was one of the men selected to pick a church site for the Zion Hill Baptist Church in 1845. In 1860 his real estate property was assessed at $2,700 and his personal property at $790.\n\nHe is buried at the Boatright Cemetery 9 miles north of Farmerville, Louisiana.\n\nREFN: 8053\n\n28 Feb 1814 Enlisted in military, Camp Beach Orchard, Cumberland Co.,\n\nVA@S12819@p.105\n\n1830 Recorded in Census, Claiborne, LA\n\n14 Oct 1835 Purchased land near Calhoun, LA\n\n3 Nov 1836 Purchased land at Zion Hill, LA\n\nREFN: 121 3\n\nInformation recorded in \"Index and Outline of Boat(w)rights of SE USA\", compiled by Norman Ricker, St. Petersburg, FL (1989)..(.see: LDS microfilm #1597 678, item #7):\n\na. Believed to run a trading post near present day Calhoun, Louisiana.\n\nb. 1870 Census lists real estate value of $2700.\n\nc. Family legend holds that Powhatan was a descendant of 'Pocahontis'; however, there is no documentation to support this. Such legends abound for many different family lines.\n\nHe believed to be the son John b 1764 & Elizabeth Tinsley. Wm E. Boatright believed he was Powhatan V. (1790-1880) and if so was born 7-13-1790 Virginia; records at Union Parish, Louisiana. show he died 12-21-1880 at age 90 yrs 5 mo 8 days, at Farmersville Union Parish, buried in Boatright Cemetery - 9 miles north of Farmersville.

He married (1) MARGARET WHEELER 13 Dec 1821. She was born Abt. 1803, and died 24 Aug 1824 in Kanawha County, Virginia. He married (2) MARGARET JENKINS 03 May 1824 in Loup Creek, Kanawha County, Virginia, daughter of ISSAC JENKINS and NANCY MARTIN. She was born 1810 in Virginia, and died 23 Nov 1828 in Kanawha County, Virginia. He married (3) HARRIET BOONE STARKE 13 Dec 1828 in Cabin Creek, Kanawha County, Virginia, daughter of JOHN STARKE and SALLIE WHITESIDE. She was born 30 Dec 1812 in Cabin Creek, Kanawha County, Virginia, and died 13 May 1832 in Kanawha County, Virginia. He married (4) DORCAS PUGH 17 May 1834 in Marion County, Indiana, daughter of JACOB PUGH and DORCAS GLASGOW. She was born 10 Jan 1812 in North Carolina, and died Dec 1834 in Marion County, Indiana. He married (5) SARAH CULE 06 Nov 1836 in Marion County, Indiana, daughter of WILLIAM CULE and POLLY. She was born 1814 in Pennsylvania, and died 1883 in Marion County, Indiana. He married (6) MARY HINSLEY 09 Sep 1837 in Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. She died Abt. 1847 in Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. He married (7) ELIZABETH MCNITT 27 May 1847 in Marion County, Indiana, divorced in Jun 1848 in Marion County, Indiana, no children. She was born Abt. 1811. He married (8) MARGARET THORNTON 22 Nov 1848 in Marion County, Indiana, divorced in June, 1851 in Marion County, Indiana, no children.

He married (10) ELSEY BOLES 29 Jan 1860 in Missouri, no children.\n\nNotes for CARY HARRISON BOATRIGHT:\n\nCary was buried in the Boatright family cemetery, located on the just outside of Otterville, Cooper County, Missouri. The cemetery was originally part of a land parcel owned by Cary Harrison Boatright. In later years the cemetery became known as Pleasant Grove Cemetery. There is no marker in the cemetery for Cary Boatright.\n\nThe following was written by William E. Boatright in 1964 and published as a book, �The Boat(w)right and Allied Families�, with some corrections from Rick McNutt. Genealogical Society of Marion County, Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nCary Harrison Boatright emigrated from Prince Edward County, Virginia to Kanawha County, Virginia probably about 1820 or 1821. Nothing is known about why he made this trip, or how, the first record so far available shows him there for his first marriage. There was a boat works at Kanawha Falls, and it may be that he went there to work. He apparently purchased some land at Beard�s Fork on Loup Creek which is now located in Fayette County, West Virginia. Mr. Charles Henry Settle (1859 � 1949) of Fayetteville, West Virginia in a letter to Laura Kincaid Blake of Kincaid said that Grandfather and Grandmother Boatright were early land owners on Loup Creek at Beard�s Fork.\n\nIn 1842 Cary Harrison purchased a bible which was published in 1839. Apparently from memory, which at times was faulty, he entered names and dates. Several dates prior to 1842 have been proven faulty; therefore, all dates before 1842 are suspect, especially when they do not correlate properly. Most of the dates given are taken from Cary Harrison�s bible.\n\nCary Harrison was married 10 times. Actually he had only four children who lived to be married and begin families.\n\nHis first marriage was to Melinda Wheeler, entered in his Bible as Melindy Wheler. They were married on 13 December 1821 according to the Kanawha County records, or 13 December 1822 according to his Bible entry. They were married in Kanawha County, Virginia. Neither Melinda Wheeler�s parents nor her birth date are known.\n\nCary Harrison and Melinda had two children:\n\n- Frances Boatright, born 5 January 1823 in Kanawha County, Virginia. She died 10 August 1824, also in Kanawha County, Virginia.\n\n- A stillborn child, 20 August 1824.\n\nCary Harrison�s first wife, Melinda, apparently died at the birth of their stillborn child on 20 August 1824. (Note: In the span of 10 days, Cary lost his wife and two children)\n\nCary Harrison Boatright�s second marriage was to Margaret Jenkins, daughter of Isaac and Nancy Jenkins, who were large landowners at Loup Creek, Kanawha County, Virginia, on 3 May 1824 according to Kanawha County records but on 13 May 1824 according to Cary�s bible. (Note: second marriage date conflicts with death dates of first wife and children) It is believed that Cary and Margaret were the grandfather and grandmother Boatright at Beard�s Fork on Loup Creek that Charles Kerry Settle wrote about, for they were actually his grandparents.\n\nIt is not known when Margaret was born, but she died on 23 November 1828, probably at her parents home on Loup Creek (now Deepwater). She is buried at Deepwater, Fayette County, West Virginia in the Settle Family Cemetery on a high hill overlooking the Kanawha River.\n\nCary Harrison and Margaret had two children:\n\n- Minerva Frances Boatright, born in January 1826 in Kanawha County, Virginia. She died 1 October 1915 at Deepwater, Fayette County, West Virginia, and is buried there in the Settle Family Cemetery. She married Francis Asbury Settle (1812 � 1893) at Loup Creek, on 2 September 1842, and they had seven children.\n\n- Nancy Boatright, born in September 1827 and died in November or December 1827 at Loup Creek, or Beard�s Fork on Loup Creek, Kanawha County, Virginia. She is also buried in the Settle Family Cemetery.\n\nAfter the death of his second wife, Margaret Jenkins, Cary Harrison Boatright apparently left Beard�s Fork and Loup Creek, and went on down the Kanawha River about 20 or 30 miles to Cabin Creek, Kanawha County, Virginia where he married his third wife, Harriet Starke, daughter of Colonel John Starke III (1777 � 1833) and Sallie Whiteside (1782 � 1852).\n\nCary Harrison and Harriet Starke were married 13 December 1828 at Cabin Creek, Kanawha County, Virginia (now West Virginia). Harriet was born 30 December 1812 probably at Cabin Creek. She died 13 May 1832 also probably at Cabin Creek, although this is not known for certain.\n\nCary Harrison and Harriet had two children:\n\n- Dorcas Boatright, born 12 May 1829 at Cabin Creek, Kanawha County, Virginia. She died 11 February 1834 probably also at Cabin Creek.\n\n- Charles Franklin Boatright, born 26 June 1831 according to his Bible and gravestone, or in December 1831 according to Cary Harrison�s Bible, at Cabin Creek, Kanawha County, Virginia (now West Virginia). Charles Franklin was married twice; first to Susan M. Butler (1831 � 1854); second time to Susan�s sister Sarah Frances Butler (1834 � 1899). Charles Franklin and Susan had one child, and he and Sarah Frances had seven children.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Cary Harrison had probably become acquainted with Harriet Starke through her father sometime prior to their marriage. Colonel John Starke III was the District Commissioner, also a �Gentleman Justice� of Kanawha County at that time, and records show that Cary Harrison paid personal property taxes to him as follows:\n\n- In 1822 for one horse, 13 � cents\n\n- In 1823 for one horse, 12 cents\n\n- In 1824 for one slave and one horse, 47 cents\n\n- In 1825 nothing\n\n- In 1826 for two horses, 24 cents\n\n- In 1827 for one horse, 12 cents\n\n- In 1828 nothing\n\n- In 1829 for one horse, 10 cents\n\nThere is no record of him paying personal property taxes in 1830, 1831 or 1832 in Kanawha County.\n\nAfter the death of Harriet in 1832, Cary Harrison apparently decided to start traveling again, and must have gone down the Kanawha River to the Ohio River, then down the Ohio River perhaps to either Cincinnati or Louisville and then overland to Indianapolis, Indiana where we next find him. Or perhaps he visited his brother Powhatan Boatright on the way. Powhatan married Lucy Utley in Jessamine County, Kentucky in 1815, and Cary Harrison may have known where he was. It would be interesting to have an account of this trip.\n\nCary Harrison Boatright�s fourth marriage was to Dorcas Pugh on 17 May 1834 (this date is from the Marion County, Indiana records versus an incorrect Bible date) at Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. Dorcas was born 10 Jan 1812 in North Carolina, daughter of JACOB PUGH and DORCAS GLASGOW. They had a stillborn child in December 1834, and it is believed that Dorcas died at this time.\n\nCary Harrison Boatright�s fifth marriage was to Sarah Cule (may have been Cool), daughter of William Cule, on 06 Nov 1836 at or near Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. Sarah was born 1814 in Pennsylvania, daughter of WILLIAM CULE and POLLY. She died at or near Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana in 1883, and is buried in the old Greenlawn Cemetery in Indianapolis. Sarah and Cary Harrison were divorced during the spring term of court in 1836 according to his Bible (must have been in 1837 as they were not married until November 1836) � this being his first divorce. Note that the 1860,-70,-80 Census' still shows Sarah listed as \"Boatright\" although her 1850 census shows Sarah Call (Cule). Cary and Sarah had two children:\n\n- Mary Boatright, who was born Abt. 1836, exact date unknown, and who died 01 Apr 1847.\n\n- William Boatright, born in September 1836 according to Cary�s Bible, or on 16 Sept 1837 according to his descendents. William was born in Wayne Township, Marion County, Indiana; he died in 1911 at Indianapolis, and is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery there. William Boatright married Eliza Jane Roberson (1840 � 1881), daughter of Charles Roberson and Mary Ann Johnson, on 9 November 1865, probably at or near Indianapolis, Indiana. Eliza Jane Roberson was born in 1840 and died in 1881, both events taking place in Marion County, Indiana. She also is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. William Boatright and Eliza Jane had seven children and began another branch of the Boatright family.\n\nCary Harrison Boatright�s sixth marriage was to Mary Hinsley in 09 Sep 1837, probably at or near Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. Nothing is known about Mary Hinsley�s parents, birth date, etc. She died Abt. 1847, exact date unknown.\n\nCary Harrison and Mary had five children:\n\n- Stofan A. Boatright, as it was entered in Cary�s Bible, Stoughten Auphen Boatright as he himself wrote it all his life, was born 28 April 1838 probably at or near Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. He died at Lewis Station, Henry County, Missouri date unknown. Stoughten married Margaret Jane (maiden last name unknown), and they had one child, Mary Ellen Boatright.\n\n- Cary Harrison Boatright Jr., born 15 July 1841, died 22 October 1841, both probably at or near Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\n- A stillborn male on 11 May 1843, probably at or near Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\n- Stillborn twin girls on 7 June 1844, also probably at or near Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\n- Mary Frances Boatright, born 1 June 1845, died in 1846, probably at or near Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nCary Harrison Boatright�s seventh marriage was to Elizabeth McNitt in 27 May 1847, probably at or near Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. Nothing is known about Elizabeth McNitt�s parents, birth date, death date, etc. Cary Harrison and Elizabeth were divorced in June 1848 in Marion County, Indiana.\n\nCary Harrison Boatright�s eighth marriage was to Margaret Thornton on 22 November 1848, in Marion County, Indiana. Nothing is known about Margaret Thornton, her parents, birth date, etc. Cary Harrison and Margaret were divorced in June of 1851 in Marion County, Indiana. They had no children.\n\nCary Harrison Boatright�s ninth marriage was to Lusindy Harmon on 31 July 1853 in Marion County, Indiana. Nothing is known about Lusindy, her parents, birth date, etc. They were divorced in 1855, Marion County, Indiana. They had no children.\n\nCary Harrison Boatright�s tenth marriage was to Elsey Boles on 29 January 1860, location unknown, although it is believed this probably took place somewhere in Missouri. Nothing is known about Elsey Boles, her parents, birth date, etc. Insofar as is known they were not divorced and she may have been with him when he died in Otterville, Cooper County, Missouri on 18 March 1870.\n\nCary Harrison�s Bible, as of February 1965 is in the possession of the compiler (William E. Boatright) at Cabool, Missouri.\n\nOf interest is the inscription on the fly leaf of the Bible, written in Cary Harrison�s handwriting�\n\n�Cary H. Boatright Bible bought April 6, 1842. Quit the use of spiritual liquor 22 February 1842. Joined the Washingtonian Society 28th of February, same instant.�\n\n�C.H. Boatright joining the Sons of Temperance in 1847, soon withdrew from that Society because they did not live according to their profession, after a while beginning to become intemperate.�\n\n�Quit the use of spirits of liquor the 2nd time on the 22nd of February 1852 as a beverage or as a social drink.�\n\nC. H. Boatright\n\nFrank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper: 03/24/1860 Volume: 1860 Issue: 03/24 Page Range: 0257c-0257c\n\nNEWS OF THE WEEK: Some men find one wife enough for a lifetime, but a man named BOATRIGHT, in [text is unclear], Missouri, has recently married his tenth wife.\n\nCary Harrison Sr. son of John Boatwright and Elizabeth Tinsley. He was born 12-3-1800 in Virginia. He died age 69 years, 3 months and 15 days on 3-18-1870 at Otterville, Cooper County, Missouri. Otterville was called Elkton at that time. From a family record by his Grandson, Erasmus Franklin Boatright (1856-1932), Cary and his brothers were tall (6'2\" to 6'4\"). He left his parents age 21 migrated to Kanawha County in western Virginia where he married. His wife died and he moved down the river and remarried, continued moves down the river and remarrying until he got to the Ohio River, then down to Cincinnati, Ohio, then overland to Indianapolis Indiana, then through Illinois into Missouri where he died.\n\n1830 Census: Name: Boatwright, Carey H Township: Center County: Wayne State: Indiana Year: 1830 Roll: 29 Page: 142 Household: 1 male: 20 - 30, 1 female: 0 - 5, 1 female: 15 - 20, 3 total 1840 Census: Name: Kary Boatright Township: Lawrence Ward 5 County: Marion State: Indiana Roll: 88 Page: 296 Household: 1 male: 0 - 5, 1 male: 15 - 20, 1 male: 30 - 40, 1 female: 0 - 5, 1 female: 20 - 30, 5 total 1850 Census: Name: Cary Boatwright Date: August 29, 1850 Age: 49 Estimated birth year: abt 1801 Birth place: Virginia Gender: Male Home in 1850 (City,County,State): Center, Marion County, Indiana Page: 190 Roll: M432_159\n\nBurial: Otterville, Cooper County, Missouri\n\nNotes for MARGARET JENKINS:\n\nBurial: Settle Family Cemetery, Deepwater, Fayette County, Virginia (now West Virginia)\n\nNotes for DORCAS PUGH:\n\nDorcas is believed to have died giving birth to their first child, who was stillborn.\n\nBurial: Old Union Cemetery, Speedway, Marion County, Indiana\n\nNotes for SARAH CULE:\n\nLast name was possibly spelled Cool\n\n1850 Census: Name: Sarah Call Date: September 4, 1850 Age: 36 Estimated birth year: abt 1814 Birth place: Indiana Gender: Female Home in 1850 (City,County,State): Wayne, Marion, Indiana Page: 311 Roll: M432_159 1860 Census: Name: Sarah Boatright Date: June 7, 1860 Age in 1860: 45 Birthplace: Pennsylvania Home in 1860: Wayne, Marion, Indiana Gender: Female Value of real estate: $0 Post Office: Indianapolis Roll: M653_280 Page: 635 Year: 1860 Head of Household: Sarah Boatright 1870 Census: Name: Sarah Boatright Date: August 4, 1870 Estimated Birth Year: abt 1813 Age in 1870: 57 Birthplace: Pennsylvania Home in 1870: Indianapolis Ward 9 (2nd Enum), Marion, Indiana Occupation: Keeping House Race: White Gender: Female Value of real estate: $0 Post Office: Indianapolis Roll: M593_339 Page: 589 Image: 612 Year: 1870 1880 Census: Name: Sarah BOATRIGHT Date: June 1, 1880 Age: 65 Estimated birth year: <1815> Birthplace: Pennsylvania Occupation: Keeping House Relationship to head-of-household: Self Home in 1880: West Newton, Marion, Indiana Marital status: Widowed Race: White Gender: Female Father's birthplace: PA Mother's birthplace: PA Census Place: West Newton, Marion, Indiana; Roll: T9_294; Family History Film: 1254294; Page: 512B; Enumeration District: 101; Image: 0207.\n\nChild of CARY BOATRIGHT and MELINDA WHEELER is:\n\n8-220. i.
