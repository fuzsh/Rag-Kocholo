(1) 1. Benjamin COOPER I - 3783 ************************************************** Birth Date: Circa 1680 Death Date: 1761 Death Place: Granville Co., NC Residence: Surry Co., VA > Granville Co. NC Sources: 89 Notes: At the beginning of 1760 Granville County NC was a large county that bordered VA. At the beginning of 1775 Granville County was divided in two parts; one part became Bute Co., western part was Granville, at the beginning of 1780. Bute County was divided in two parts-Warren County to the North, that part bordered VA. The southern half became Franklin County. In 1912 a part became Vance. Today we have Granville Vance, Warren and Franklin Counties. One could have lived in Granville Co. in 1775 and would have lived in Granville, Bute, and Warren counties and never had to move from the original spot and if they lived long enough they could also have lived in Vance County.245 Spouse: Elizabeth CANNON - 3784 Residence: Surry Co.

SC Sources: 14 (3) 1.1.3 Elijah COOPER - 3326 ************************************************** Death Date: 1797 Residence: Union Co. SC Sources: 14 Notes: Elijah Cooper and his wife lived the first year on the property of his uncle, James Harrison. A short time afterward Elijah Cooper bought a tract of land not far from his uncle and his father-in-law, Thomas Greer. On the road leading to Adam's Ford on Tyger River. Thomas Greer was an important man in the Rev. War and in SC. 247 One of the sons of Elijah H. Cooper and S. Greer was James William Cooper who went by the initials, J.W.. One of J.W.'s sons wrote him in 1856 and asked about his heritage. This 6 page letter can be found in the Book of Greer and Related Families. This six page letter he recalls, to the best of his knowledge, the off-spring of William Cooper and Mary Polly Harrison. He makes one terrible omission. He omits William Cooper II, he lists Elijah H. Cooper, John, Andrew, Abner, Richard, Sarah, Mary, Elizabeth. This omission has been the genesis of a lot of errors eg. Tennessee Cousins. Spouse: Susannah GREER - 4543 Residence: Union Co.

SC Sources: 14 (3) 1.1.9 William COOPER II - 4545 ************************************************** Residence: Union Co. SC; Giles Co. TN Sources: 89 Notes: William Cooper I, did indeed, have a son named William Cooper as well as Elijah H., et. al. and J.W. probably did not know anything about him since he had already left the area, or his memory failed him when he wrote the letter which was written 50-60 years after William II left.248 In the Union County Deed Book H pp 135-136 there is a deed of gift recorded 5 May 1804. The original Deed of Gift and William Cooper I had a son William Cooper II that he left one bed and furniture and sted and cord etc. William II went on to Giles County, Tennessee.

If the money was not used for schooling the money was to go back to the estate. Well, either 20 shillings was not enough money to become literate or they spent the money unwisely, because Cannon Cooper could never write his name and other people spelled it like it sounded.
