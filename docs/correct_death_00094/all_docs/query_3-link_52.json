        "text": "Description After Benjamin Harrison's wife Caroline died and he lost his 2nd presidential bid in 1892, he returned to Indianapolis to his Delaware Street home. Four years later he married the 37-year old widowed Mary Scott Lord Dimmick (1858-1948), niece and former assistant to his first wife. Although his adult children disapproved of the May-December relationship, the couple had a daughter when Benjamin was age 63 and remained together until Harrison's death in 1901. Mary Harrison helped start the Benjamin Harrison Memorial Home in Indianapolis. She remained in Indianapolis until 1913 and later settled in New York City where she died in 1948.
