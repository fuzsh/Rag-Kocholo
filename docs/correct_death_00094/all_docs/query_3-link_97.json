He married Anne Carter about 1722. She was born 1696 in Corotoman (Lancaster County) Virginia, and died in 1743 at Berkeley Plantation (Charles City County) Virginia. She was the daughter of Robert Carter of Lancaster County Virginia and Judith Armistead. Benjamin (IV) inherited Berkeley upon the death of his father, Benjamin (III) Harrison, and was the builder of the present house. Benjamin (IV) was killed by lightning and died along with his two daughters. He died leaving Berkeley to his son Benjamin (V). He served in the House of Burgesses, and was the High Sheriff of Charles City County, Virginia.\n\n________________________________\n\nBenjamin Harrison was born in 1695 in Charles City County, Virginia, to Benjamin Harrison (1673-1710) and Elizabeth Burwell Harrison (1677-1734). He attended the College of William and Mary. Harrison represented Charles City County in the House of Burgesses from 1736 to 1742. Harrison was a large landholder, owning land in Charles City, Prince George, Surry, Sussex, Brunswick, and Amelia Counties, and Petersburg, Virginia. Harrison built the plantation house \"Berkeley.\" He married Anne Carter in 1722 and they had 10 children, including Benjamin Harrison (1726-1791) who served as governor of Virginia and signed the Declaration of Independence. Harrison and two of his daughters were killed 12 July 1744 by a lightning strike at Berkeley and were buried there.\n\nNotes\n\nSome sources say he was born in 1702.\n\nThe DAR's \"Lineage Book of the Charter Members\" by Mary S Lockwood published in 1895 states he \"was sheriff and a member of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, and died in 1744, and was father of the signer of the Declaration of Independence.\"\n\nHarrison family\n\nEncyclopedia of Virginia Biography, Under the Editorial ..., Volume 4 By Lyon Gardiner Tyler. Page 473-474 GoogleBooks\n\nThe Harrison family is one of the oldest of the state, and was founded by Benjamin Harrison, who came from England at a very early date, and settled in Virginia. In 1634 he received from John Davis a deed of two hundred acres of land on Warresquioake creek, and subsequently received patents of land. He was clerk of the council of the colony, and a member of the house of burgesses in 1642. He died March 21, 1643. His widow Mary subsequently married Benjamin Sidway. He left two sons. Benjamin and Peter, of whom the latter had no issue.\n\n(I) Benjamin Harrison, probably a grandson of Benjamin and Mary Harrison, was born September 20, 1645, in Southwark parish. Surry county, Virginia, died January 30, 1713. He was sent as a commissioner from the colony to England, and was a member of the colonial council in 1699. His wife Hannah was born February 13, 1652, and died February 16, 1699, as shown by her tombstone. They had children: Sarah, Benjamin, of whom further, Nathaniel and Hannah.\n\n(II) Benjamin Harrison, son of Benjamin and Hannah Harrison, was born about 1673, and resided at Berkeley on the James river, where he died April 10, 1710. He was speaker of the house of burgesses, attorney general and treasurer of the colony, and had begun writing a history of the colony at the time of his death. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Lewis and Abigail (Smith) Burwell, and they were the parents of Benjamin, of whom further.\n\n(III) Benjamin Harrison, son of Benjamin and Elizabeth (Burwell) Harrison, was sheriff of Charles City county, and a member of the house of burgesses. He married, about 1722, Anne Carter, daughter of Robert and Betty (Landon) Carter, the last' ter a daughter of Thomas Landon, of Credenhill, county of Hereford, England, the former a son of John Carter. They had children : Anne, Elizabeth, Benjamin ( signer of the Declaration of Independence, and ancestor of the presidents). Carter Henry, Henry, died in infancy, Charles, Nathaniel, of whom further.\n\n=================================================================================================================================================\n\nBirth: 1694 Charles City County Virginia, USA Death: Jul. 12, 1745 Charles City County Virginia, USA\n\nHe was married in 1722. He lived at \"Berkley Plantation\"\n\nHe was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the son of Benjamin Harrison III, and the father of Benjamin Harrison V, who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the fifth Governor of Virginia.\n\nHarrison is also known as the builder of \"Berkeley\" which is believed to be the oldest three-story brick mansion in Virginia and is the ancestral home to two Presidents of the United States: William Henry Harrison, his grandson, and Benjamin Harrison his great-great-grandson.\n\nTwo powerful and influential families in colonial Virginia, the Harrison family and the Carter family, were united when Harrison married Anne Carter, the daughter of Robert \"King\" Carter.\n\nHis family also forged ties to the Randolph family as four of his children married four grandchildren of William Randolph.\n\nBenjamin Harrison IV was born in a small house on the plantation named \"Berkeley Hundred\" or \"Berkeley Plantation\". Upon completion of his studies at The College of William & Mary, he became the Harrison family's first college graduate.\n\nHarrison settled on his family estate and like his predecessors, he increased his land holdings.\n\nAround 1722, Harrison married Anne Carter, whom William Byrd II had described as \"a very agreeable girl\". As part of a dowry from Robert Carter, Harrison managed and received profits from land that was technically owned by his father-in-law. This land was entailed by Carter to Harrison's son, Carter Henry Harrison. Using bricks fired on the Berkeley plantation, Harrison built a Georgian-style three-story brick mansion on a hill overlooking the James River in 1726.\n\nBerkeley would later earn a distinction shared only with Peacefield in Quincy, Massachusetts as the ancestral home for two United States Presidents.\n\nIn 1729, Harrison purchased 200 acres of the Bradford plantation from Richard Branford III.\n\nFrom 1736 to 1742, he represented Charles City County, Virginia in the House of Burgesses.\n\nFamily\n\nBenjamin and his wife had eleven children:\n\nElizabeth Harrison (born ~1723)[1] married Peyton Randolph, the son of Sir John Randolph, the grandson of William Randolph I, and the first President of the Continental Congress.\n\nAnne Harrison (born 1724) married William Randolph III, the son of William Randolph II and the grandson of William Randolph I, and had five children.\n\nBenjamin Harrison V (born 1726) married Elizabeth Bassett.\n\nHis third son was William Henry Harrison, the ninth President of the United States.\n\nHis descendants include Congressman John Scott Harrison and Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd President of the United States.Lucy Harrison (born 1728) married Edward Randolph Jr., the son of Edward Randolph Sr. and the grandson of William Randolph I, and the couple had two children.\n\nHannah Harrison (born 1730 – 1745)\n\nCarter Henry Harrison I (born 1732) married Susannah Randolph, the daughter of Isham Randolph and the granddaughter of William Randolph I, and had six children.\n\nHis descendants include two mayors of Chicago: Carter Henry Harrison III and his son Carter Henry Harrison IV.\n\nHenry Harrison (1734 – 1736) who died in infancy.\n\nHenry Harrison (born 1736-1772) Stationed at Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War, he served as a Captain under Major General Edward Braddock and later under Lieutenant Colonel George Washington. Builder of Hunting Quarter in Sussex County, Virginia.\n\nRobert Harrison (born 1738)\n\nCharles Harrison (b. 1740 – d. 1793) who was colonel of the 1st Continental Artillery Regiment.\n\nNathaniel Harrison (born September 30, 1742)\n\nAnne Carter is thought to have preceded Harrison in death.\n\nIn 1745, he and his \"two youngest daughters\" (one of which was very likely Hannah) were killed when lightning struck his house.\n\nHarrison's Will expressed his intent to be buried near his son, Henry, and it broke with the British tradition of primogeniture by leaving large amounts of wealth to all of his children. The six plantations that comprised Berkeley, along with the manor house, equipment, stock, and slaves, became the responsibility of Benjamin Harrison V, the oldest son.
