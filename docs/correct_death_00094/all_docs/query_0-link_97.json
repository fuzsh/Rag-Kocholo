Witthoft, Sr.\n\nHerman, married to Doris DeVane, is in his 70s now with five children. Herman�s Shafer connection comes through his mother�s side of the family, Florence Zula Shafer, the daughter of Wellington Shafer. He became interested in computers and genealogy at the same time in early 1990, the year of his retirement after 31 years employed by the State of New York. His mother was an avid genealogist for over 60 years. With what she passed along to Herman plus what he gathered on his own he now has a GEDCOM of over 58,000 people.\n\nHerman specializes in three separate lines of the Schaeffers of Schoharie Co. and Delaware Co., New York. These three lines are descended from [1] Maria Elizabeth Schaefferin (1665-1749); [2] George Shaver and Jane Mulford, Town of Fulton, Schoharie Co., NY; and [3] descendants of Jost Hendrick Schaeffer, Shavertown, Town of Andes, Delaware Co., NY. To date they remain separate lines with no connections by marriage or blood.\n\nOn line [1] Herman has over 6439 descendants and counting spouses over 9615.\n\nOn line [2] Herman has over 768 descendants and counting spouses over 1145.\n\nOn line [3] Herman has over 1048 descendants and counting spouses over 1515.\n\nOf course it takes a lot of leg work not to mention finger work and eye work to compile so many names but Herman does mention several books that have been helpful.

Shaffer [email protected]\n\n***The Shaffer Family Website***\n\n*Shaffer Family History*\n\nThe Shaffer family first started with three brothers and their families immigrating from Germany in June 1710. Their names were Johann nicolaus schaeffer, his wife Maria catharina suder; their daughter Anna margaretha, and five sons, michael, caspar, peter, nicolaus and Jacob.\n\nThe other two families were Johann Michael and his wife Anna Christina schehrer, and johann friederich and his wife Anna rosina. Discouraged, and dissatisfied with their treatment after their arrival, the families left in the late fall of 1712 for schoharie valley, some 60 miles from Livingston manor, NY., Where they remained there for 10 years.\n\nEarly in 1723, the 3 families left schoharie and settled tulpehocken, in southeastern Pennsylvania. Johann nicolaus schaeffer and his family were the earliest settlers to tulpehocken. His brother johann friederich also settled the same area. Johann nicolaus' son, johann nicolaus jr., Who!was born Jan. 21, 17o6 in relsberg, Germany had a son named Johannes.\n\nJohannes was born in tulpehocken in 1728. Johannes was raised near rehersburg in berks county, and later, he met and married Maria Eva Saab in 1749. Their first son, johan Nicholas was born on new years day in 1750, in berks county.\n\nTwo years later on October 31, 1752, my great, great, great, great grandfather john Adam Schaffer was born. Johannes and his family, wife Eva, five sons and three daughters moved northwest to Mahanoy Township in Northumberland County. In April 1775, when the colonies started getting mad at king George iii in England, and declared\n\nTheir independence, the two oldest Shaffer boys went off to fight for liberty and freedom. John Adam was a lieutenant and his brother Nicholas was a private in a company called \"the associators.\" They both fought in the battles of Trenton and Princeton during the cold winter of 1776-1777. Their enlistment commitment ended in 1779 and john Adam mustered out at York County he married a York county girl named Elizabeth Klinefelder. After eleven children, (6 boys and 5 girls) john Adam and Elizabeth moved their family to centre county in 1801. Nicholas and his wife Juliana brosius had moved to that area nine years earlier and produced 14 kids in 22 years. John Adam was the patriarch of his day, lived to be 87 years old when he passed away in madisonburg, in 1840. His wife Elizabeth died 5 years earlier and his brother Nicholas died in 1825. All are buried in the Lutheran and reformed church cemetery in madisonburg.\n\nHERE ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF JOHN ADAM SHAFFER\n\n6th Generation\n\nJACOB SHAFFER, the 3rd son of John Adam, born October 29, 1785;\n\nDied November 17, 1850. Jacob married Mary Walborn from Dauphin County. They moved from Centre County in 1823, on land obtained from Mary Walborn's brother Henry Walborn. The new land was located in Jefferson County, just two counties west of Centre County. Jacob and Mary had nine children, two girls and seven boys.\n\n7th Generation\n\nHENRY SHAFFER, the 2nd son of Jacob Shaffer, born May 9, 1813;\n\nDied December 18, 1877. Henry changed the spelling of \"SHAFER\" with two \"F's\" before moving to Jefferson County. He married Phoebe Pendleton from New York State on Jan. 20, 1842. They had four boys and one girl from their union.\n\n8th Generation\n\nJACOB PENDLETON SHAFFER, the 2nd son of Henry, born Feb. 8, 1846; died February 24, 1936. Jacob stayed on the Shaffer homestead and he and his wife Martha Smith married on February 11, 1873. They had six children, 3 boys and 3 girls. Jacob lived to the age of 90 and furnished a lot of this information to my father before 1930.\n\n9th Generation\n\nWILLIAM CLARENCE SHAFFER, the 1st son of Jacob P., born December 3, 1875; died June 9, 1946. William stayed on the Shaffer farm and married twice. William's first wife, Alice Wells died in 1903 and they had a set of twins; a boy and a girl, named Roland and Rosmond. They had another girl named Erma born in 1902. William married a widow named Lydia Anderson/McKee in Niagara Falls, on July 16, 1905.\n\nWilliam and his new bride moved to nearby Elk County. Another set of twins was born from this marriage. My father Leroy L. Shaffer and his twin Leigh was born on August 14, 1906. Leigh didn't survive past his first year and died of pneumonia in 1907.\n\n10th Generation\n\nLEROY LUCIUS SHAFFER, the 2nd son of William C., born August 14, 1906;\n\ndied June 28,1971. Leroy married my mother Valla Pauline Strong from Maroa, Illinois, on Oct. 26, 1930. The first of 4 children was Dorothy Jane, born in 1933; followed by my sister Rose Marie, born in 1936; my brother Thomas Leroy, born in 1940; and then I was born last in 1945.\n\n11th Generation\n\nRICHARD WADE SHAFFER, the 2nd Son of Leroy L., born August 27, 1945.\n\nI married and have three children, 2 boys and one girl.\n\nShaffer Genealogy\n\nPosted by Robert Shaffer on February 26, 1998 at 08:02:38:\n\nI am researching Shaffers in Somerset Co., PA from abt 1795 until about 1870.

My name is Don Shaffer, I'm looking for info on the SHAFFER family that lived or lives in or around Cameron County, PA.\n\nMy Grandad said \"I was borned on Christmas day 1871, in Cameron, Cameron County, PA.\" That's what we want to find out. We would like to know a little about his family. His Name was Joseph (James)Melvin Shaffer. He always said his name was Joseph, BUT, his headstone in Crosby, PA says James. So which was it Joseph or James? He also said \"his mother died while giving him birth.\" He had a sister named Jennie or Jane E., she traveled with his father; who was a woodmans, traveling camp to camp. Jennie (Jane E.) married a man named Fauver and moved somewhere in or around Buffalo, NY. My Grandad was raised by various families in and around Cameron County. Around the turn of the Century he married Eunice Deliah Rosier. (we believe they were married in Portville, NY) They had several children :\n\nAntoinette\n\nJames\n\nEthel\n\nFloyd\n\nLewis (this is my dad)\n\nRobert\n\nJohn\n\nTwins Doris & Donald.\n\nThey lived in and around Cameron County, and Crosby town. Around 1916-19 they migrated to NYS, settled in Caton, NY then moved to Corning, NY. The rest we know. My uncle Don is the last living child, he is 76 years old, and would like to find out a little about his parents and where they came from, before he passes on. Any info we receive, would make a old man very happy. Thanks\n\nUncle Don passed away on June 6th 1998.

I don't know anything about my GGrandmother Elizabeth SHAFFER (no N maiden name), except that she married David SHAFFNER on 2 Oct 1851 in Preble Co OH, and that the 1850 census shows an Elizabeth Shaffer as part of the household of Valentine SNYDER in Preble Co. When I ran across the SHAFFER/SNYDER marriage in the appropriate time frame I figured maybe Henry and Nancy were her parents and that she was living with Grandparents or an Uncle just before her marriage. I don't see a connection with your folks but there very well could be siblings involved.

We are from Ohio also but are now living in El Paso, Texas. Planning on retirement next year. Moving back to great state of Ohio. We have some good friends that came from C.M.A. in northern Ohio. Served with Word of Life in Brazil. Keith and Lois Jean Britton. We used to run Christian Bookstore for Radio Station W.E.E.C. in Springfield, Ohio. Then we purchased it from them and owned it for about 14 years.\n\nEnough trivia. We have been searching for years for my gggrandfather's wife. Nancy Shaffer married in 1827 to Alexander Henderson maybe Indiana Co., Penn.

That is where you need to start. You should be able to find him as an 8 year old boy with his father and that will tell you where John Seth Shaffer was born and what year. Also will tell you all his children's names. Then you should work backwards from 1920 (1910,1900, 1880) and see what you find. The 1890 census burned and will not be accessible for the most part. Do you live near a library that has this info. If you don't let me know and I'll at least check a couple of census years for you next time I'm there. My SHAFFER's were farmers in MO also. WILLIAM SHAFFER born in 1868 in Indiana, moved to Caldwell Co. MO (just north of Kansas City) as a boy and had his 11 children there between 1890-1912.

My ggrandfather was Joseph Schaefer b. 1851 in Nassau, Germany. He had a brother \"Jake\" and a sister Margaret who married a Liser (Lizer?). Based on the birth date of my ggrandfather, his parents may have been born about 1825-1830 or so. The religion was Catholic. Joseph immigrated about 1870. (Don't know when \"Jake\" and Margaret immigrated). Joseph, Jake and Margaret lived in Chicago area at first. Joseph moved to Iowa after three years (1874?) and farmed and relatives visited him there. No one remembers where exactly in Illinois the relatives lived. Hopefully the above info will ring a bell with someone, but I'm not holding my breath here.

My gggrandfather was George Shaffer who lived & died in Waynesville Illinois. His son Aaron H Shaffr was my ggrandfather. Aaron had several brothers-one of whom was John Shaffer. They all migrated to Fulton, Ks. after they were married. Approximate date was 1884 or 85. I have info on all of them except John.

Shaffer\n\nFrom: \"Pat Frappier\" [email protected]\n\nI am searching for info on John W. Shaffer b. 1820 in Lancaster Co. PA. Circa 1848 he married Nancy Shallenberger, a Mennonite and in 1850 they were living in W. Donegal Twp., Lancaster Co. PA. In 1860 they were living in New Carlisle area, Clark County, Ohio. There is a possibility John was\n\nthe brother of Anthony W. Shaffer who was born 1810 in Lancaster or York County. Anthony was the son of John Shaffer and E. Willes. My best lead right now is that John and siblings may descend from Anthony or John Anthony Shaffer who died in 1820 in Donegal Twp, Lancaster Co and left wife Barbara (Meyer) and issue: John b 31 Jul 1791, Jacob b. 18 Dec 1793, Susanna b. 28 Aug 1795 m.
