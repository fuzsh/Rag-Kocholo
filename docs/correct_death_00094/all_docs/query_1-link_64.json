        "text": "Mr. President: A Life of Benjamin Harrison, the thirteenth volume in the Indiana Historical Society Press' youth biography series, examines Harrison's rise to political prominence after his service as a Union army general during the Civil War. Although he served only one term, defeated for re-election by Cleveland in 1892, Harrison had some impressive achievements during his four years in the White House. His administration worked to have Congress pass the Sherman Antitrust Act to limit business monopolies, fought to protect voting rights for African American citizens in the South, preserved millions of acres for forest reserves and national parks, modernized the American navy, and negotiated several successful trade agreements with other countries in the Western Hemisphere. After losing the White House, Harrison returned to Indianapolis, once again becoming one of the city's leading citizens. He died from pneumonia on March 13, 1901, in his home on North Delaware Street, today open to the public as the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site.\n\nHardcover. 202 pages. 2018 Indiana Historical Society Press. by Ray E. Boomhower."
