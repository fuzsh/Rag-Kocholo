        "text": "We can celebrate five U.S. presidents from the area for Presidents Day.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison is buried 15 miles downriver from Cincinnati in North Bend. Ulysses S. Grant’s birthplace is 25 miles east in Point Pleasant. William Howard Taft grew up in Mount Auburn. Rutherford B. Hayes was married here.\n\nBenjamin Harrison, the ninth president’s grandson, was born and raised in North Bend, but is usually associated with Indianapolis, where he spent his career.\n\nHis Hoosier heritage is emphasized in the new book, “Mr. President: A Life of Benjamin Harrison” by Ray E. Boomhower, a concise yet comprehensive biography of the 23rd president published by the Indiana Historical Society Press.\n\nPresidents' Day deal: Get three months of unlimited access for $1\n\nBut make no mistake, Harrison was born and bred a Buckeye.\n\nYet, even in his hometown he is overshadowed by his family. Born in 1833, he was 7 years old when his grandfather became president. His great-grandfather, Benjamin Harrison V, was a Founding Father and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His father, John Scott Harrison, was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nDespite an impressive political pedigree, Harrison believed in earning his way on his own merits, Boomhower notes.\n\nHarrison studied at Farmers' College in College Hill, then at Miami University in Oxford, graduating at age 19. He returned to Cincinnati to study law under Bellamy Storer, passed the bar in 1854 and chose to practice law in Indianapolis.\n\nHe was a brigadier general in the Civil War, a U.S. senator, and a gifted attorney and orator. Just as important politically, he was from Indiana, a crucial battleground state, and so was tabbed as the Republican candidate to run against President Grover Cleveland in 1888.\n\nHarrison lost the popular vote by more than 90,000 votes, but won 233 electoral votes to Cleveland’s 168. The devoutly religious Harrison gave credit to God, while others pointed to election fraud with Republicans bribing “floater” voters for their support. Harrison appeared to be oblivious and untouched by the voting scandal.\n\nHistorians rate Harrison’s presidency as rather ordinary, but he had some notable successes. The Sherman Anti-Trust Act against business monopolies and the McKinley Tariff Act passed, six new states joined the Union, 13 million acres were preserved as national forest reserves and the Navy was modernized.\n\nHarrison also sought to guarantee African-American voting rights, asking Congress:\n\n“When and under what conditions is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored?”\n\nAlthough his efforts were not successful, escaped slave, abolitionist and statesman Frederick Douglass said his efforts “should endear him to the colored people as long as he lives.”\n\nYet, he struggled to win over voters. “Although admired for his faith and honesty,” Boomhower wrote, “Harrison sometimes was viewed by even his supporters as reserved and aloof, while his opponents referred to him as a ‘human iceberg.’ ”\n\nHarrison lost the 1892 rematch with Cleveland, who became the only president to serve two nonconsecutive terms. A bigger blow was the death of Harrison’s wife a few weeks before the election. Harrison was welcomed back to Indiana, where he lived out his days.\n\nIt is interesting to note that The Enquirer revealed a different side of Harrison upon his death in 1901. He had wed again, and left behind a 4-year-old daughter, Elizabeth. Rather than a declaration of the death of the former president, the newspaper’s front-page headline read, “Baby’s Loving Playmate Is No More.”\n\nReporting that the child had planted a last kiss on her father’s lips before he died, The Enquirer added, “He had been the ruler of a great nation, soldier, jurist, President, but the playmate of a little child.”"
