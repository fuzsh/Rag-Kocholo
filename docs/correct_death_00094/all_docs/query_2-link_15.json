        "text": "Benjamin Harrison (August 20, 1833 â€“ March 13, 1901) was the 23rd president of the United States (1889-1893). He was the grandson of President William Henry Harrison and the only grandson of a president to himself become president. His home was in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was a member of the Republican party and was elected to the White House in 1888, beating the incumbent, Grover Cleveland. He was the first president of the United States to use electricity in the White House.[1] After Harrison served one full four-year term as president, Cleveland ran again. This time, he beat Harrison.\n\nHarrison's first wife was Carrie Harrison. After she died, he married Mary Dimmick Harrison. During the American Civil War Harrison was a colonel in the Union Army (later a brevet brigadier general). He was also a successful lawyer, arguing many cases before the United States Supreme Court. he died of influenza related pneumonia at age 67 in Indianapolis Indiana\n\nPresidency[change | change source]\n\nBenjamin Harrison as president wanted to increase tariffs (a tax on goods that come into the country) for two reasons:\n\nFirst, it gave more money to the U.S. government, so it could fund important things.\n\nSecond, because he believed in protectionism. He thought a high tariff would encourage Americans to make more of their own things instead of buying them from foreign countries.\n\nHarrison spent the money received from the tariffs to give money to injured American Civil War veterans.\n\nHarrison was the first president to have a billion dollar budget for the government. People criticized him for that.\n\nHe also signed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act which gave the U.S. government the power to regulate big businesses.\n\nReferences[change | change source]\n\nOther websites[change | change source]"
