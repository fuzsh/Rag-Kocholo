        "text": "On July 1, 1862, a full year after the bombardment of Fort Sumter, President Abraham Lincoln appealed for an additional 300,000 men in the Union Army. Along with 17 other governors, Governor Oliver P. Morton of Indiana pledged to aid in the call for reinforcements. Morton was having difficulty filling the Indiana quota of troops. It was during this period of time that Benjamin Harrison and a friend found themselves in the Governor’s office on business. Morton asked the men to join him in his inner room at the conclusion of their business.\n\nMorton shared his concerns about raising troops; he was quite depressed at the people’s slow response. Harrison felt that he was addressing him personally. Harrison was so moved that he offered: “Governor, if I can be of any service, I will go.” Morton immediately asked him to raise a regiment, but felt that it was asking too much for Harrison to go into the field of battle and offered that they would find someone to command the regiment. Harrison had just been elected Reporter of the Supreme Court.\n\nHarrison, however, rejected the idea of asking men to join a regiment and then staying home himself. Harrison answered that if he made any speeches, and asked men to go, he proposed to go along with them, and stay as long as they did, if he lived that long. However, he did not feel that he should be in command of the regiment, as he did not have any military background.\n\nIn response to this pledge, Harrison volunteered to raise a regiment. The new soldiers put into camp on the west side of Indianapolis and began their drills. Harrison employed a drill master from Chicago using his own funds to train the men. Harrison was given a commission as Second Lieutenant, and two weeks later was promoted to captain.\n\nThe men remained in camp drilling for about a month. When the regiment was complete Governor Morton gave Harrison the commission of Colonel. By August 8, 1862, the newly appointed Colonel Harrison raised 1000 recruits.\n\nOn August 15, the 70th Indiana arrived in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where Harrison faced the task of turning raw recruits into seasoned troops. By day, he marched and drilled his men; by night, long after taps had sounded, he studied and perfected himself in the tactics of war.\n\nDiscipline would prove to be one of Harrison’s most arduous tasks. Company E, led by Captain Meredith, was especially challenging. Harrison wrote to his law partner, William Fishback, that two corporals had been “broken,” with one lieutenant arrested, and many of the squad in the guardhouse. “They are beginning to know me now.”\n\nCaptain Meredith was anxious to reform and Harrison gave him the chance. Meredith served with distinction for the duration of the war. Harrison’s reputation became that of a strong leader. He earned the respect of his men and did not leave them in battle. The men learned that he stood by his word and was always concerned with their well-being. Harrison knew that they would have to be disciplined to survive battle.\n\nHarrison did not ask more of his men than he did of himself. Mr. Richard Smock remembered an incident while they were camped near Nashville during a very cold winter. Men on the picket line were nearly frozen to death, and Colonel Harrison fixed coffee and took it to them in the middle of the night. Harrison always led the men saying “Come on, boys!” as he took the lead.\n\nThe 70th Indiana was assigned to guard the railroads in Tennessee until February 1863. They then served picket duty at Gallatin. In August 1863, they moved to Nashville to guard trains to Chattanooga and provided picket duty, leaving in February 1864 to join the Atlanta Campaign.\n\nIn May 1864, Colonel Harrison and the regiment joined General Sherman’s Atlanta campaign in the Army of the Cumberland. For Harrison’s achievements at the battles of Resaca and Peachtree Creek, he was promoted to Brigadier General."
