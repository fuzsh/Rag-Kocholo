        "text": "Benjamin Harrison was the grandson of a president, the great-grandson of a signer of the Declaration of Independence and an acclaimed Civil War hero. In 1888, he was elected the 23rd president of the United States.\n\nBenjamin Harrison was born Aug. 20, 1833 in Ohio where he grew up and attended college. As a young man, he came to Indianapolis in 1854 to start his career as an attorney. His family was already well known in the city. His grandfather, William Henry Harrison, had been governor of the Indiana Territory before statehood. (One of his first law partners was Lew Wallace, who became famous in his own right as author of \"Ben-Hur.\")\n\nDuring the Civil War, Harrison trained and led the Seventieth Indiana Regiment, returning to the city a brigadier general commended for valor. Harrison had already been involved in local politics before the war and was a protege of Gov. Oliver P. Morton. As a bona fide war hero and successful courtroom attorney, Harrison became an attractive national candidate.\n\nHarrison unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1876, but was then elected to the U.S. Senate in 1881 and became the Republican Party candidate for president in 1888. In the general election, he received 100,000 fewer votes than incumbent President Grover Cleveland but won the electoral vote 233 to 168. An audio recording of Harrison's inaugural address is believed to be the earliest recording of a president's voice.\n\nHe served one term, defeated by Cleveland in 1892.\n\nHis wife, Caroline, died a few days before the election. After his presidency, Harrison retired to Indianapolis where, a few years later, he created a stir by choosing a new wife -- Caroline's niece and a one-time White House social secretary. He lived with her the rest of his life at the home he he built at 1230 N. Delaware Street in Indianapolis.\n\nThe marriage caused rift between Harrison and his adult children. His son, Russell, cut off all communication with his father and the two were still estranged in 1901 when the elder Harrison fell ill with influenza and did not recover. The former president died\n\non March 13, 1901. He is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery.\n\nAlthough Russell Harrison played a key role in convincing the U.S. War Department to build a U.S. Army base in Marion County, it was others who lobbied to name it Fort Benjamin Harrison."
