        "text": "The scion of a political dynasty ushers in the era of big government\n\nAn engrossing ferry to 19th century America, Benjamin Harrison is sure to capture every political enthusiast's attention. Join Charles W. Calhoun as he renders a fresh perspective on one of America's most controversial leaders.\n\nThe book serves as an insightful biography of Harrison, a prominent Indiana attorney and Republican champion, considered by some as the harbinger of big government. A politically gifted progeny, our protagonist's DNA carries signatures of greats like William Henry Harrison, the ninth president, and a signer of the Declaration.\n\nDespite losing the popular vote, Harrison managed to inflict a crushing defeat on the incumbent, Grover Cleveland, in the electoral college in the historic election of 1888. A fertile blend of political tumult, personal tribulations, and unprecedented events, this narrative vividly unravels the anxious race for a second term and the culminating silence of Harrison to the beat of Cleveland at their fabled rematch.\n\nThe vibrant backdrop of the Gilded Age coupled with the intricate detailing of Harrison's life and times makes this rendition instrumental for every American history aficionado.\n\nThe book uncovers rich facets of the enigmatic Harrison while confronting under-explored themes like the Sherman Antitrust Act, McKinley Tariff, and the Panic of 1893. Calhoun's captivating storytelling delivers an intimate account of presidential dynamics in 19th-century America."
