        "text": "The Lawyer\n\nIn 1860, Benjamin Harrison was elected Supreme Court reporter, and according to his own account, the only political office he ever voluntarily sought. He valued the information he gained from his position and considered it equivalent to a postgraduate education in law. Returning to Indianapolis after his service in the Civil War, Harrison was filled with plans for renewing family relationships, re-establishing his law practice and returning to his office of Supreme Court reporter. The firm of Porter, Harrison, & Fishback was formed."
