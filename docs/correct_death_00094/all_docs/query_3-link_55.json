        "text": "Descendants of Benjamin and Henrietta (Simms) Harrison The Benjamin Harrison family data is based on the DAR application of Martha (Harrison) Harper and data complied by Sue Countryman. Benjamin was the oldest son of Ephraim Harrison. In 2000 three students complied a family photo essay/research project on the Benjamin and Henrietta (Simms) Harrison family. Sue Countryman has also compiled a great photo collection of the family at ImageStation (requires signing up for a free membership to view the photo album).\n\nIn the 1850 Federal Census, of the Town of Metomen, Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, page 190, the household of Ephraim Harrison listed (living in the household next door was the Clark and Mary Gardiner, brother of Maria (Gardiner) Harrison, the second wife of Ephraim's brother Elias Stillwell Harrison):\n\n#1367 1386 Harrison, Ephraim 57 m Joiner Maryland 200\n\nBenjamin 22 m Mich\n\nHenry 13 m Mich\n\nJohn S. 18 m Mich\n\nRussell 15 m Ill\n\nData collected concerning Benjamin Harrison (son of Ephraim Harrison) from \"An Illustrated History of Nobles County Minnesota\", by Arthur P. Rose, Northern History Publishing Company, Worthington, Minnesota, 1908, Page 53:\n\n\"Among the first comer of the year were two parties from Rochester, Minn. both of whom arrived at Graham lakes on May 15. The parties were composed of J. H. Cunningham, E. W. Hesselroth, Richman Morton, Chet. Cutting, Stephen Howell and a Mr. Stanfield. These men were on their way to Sioux Falls, looking for homes in the new western country, and were traveling over the old trail. When Jack creek was reached they party was met by H. C. Hallett (?), who advised them that they could do no better than cast their lot with the people about Graham lakes. Mr. Hallett (?), himself, had arrived only a short time before. The new arrivals decided to take a look at the country. They did so, and all except Stanfield took claims in what later became Graham Lakes Township. He remained in the settlement about a month and then returned to his old home. Capt. J. W. Miller came in June and settled near Graham lakes. A man named Bent came in the fall and located on section 10 of the same township. Other settlers of that year were Benjamin Harrison, S. R. Harris, Wm. II Brown, W. G. Brown, J. W. Palmer and John Hart. Nearly all these brought families with them. Three settlers, one of whom was (page 54) Wm. W. Cosper, arrived in the fall and took claims in Seward township. Edward Berreau took up a residence in Hersey township that year.\n\nTo the southeastern portion of the county in 1870 also came quite a number of settlers, many of whom were Scandinavians. The first of these were Ole Ellingson and John Christ Johnson, who came in the spring. Closely following these were two brothers, Ole Fauskee and Ole A. Fauskee, who filed on claims June 8. The former selected land on the north shore of Ocheyda lake (the northwest quarter of section 6); the latter took a preemption claim on the same section. The brothers walked into Nobles county from a point in Northern Iowa, where they had left their families, then walked to Jackson, where they made their filings, and from there back to where their families had been left. They constructed a combination log, sod and hay shanty, in which they lived five years.\n\nHenry Haggard arrived in the same neighborhood on June 10, and became a permanent resident. Erick B. Paul came to the county in May, and in August took up land. Nelson Coyour located at the south end of Indian lake on section 34. John Brown took up land in section 26, where he lived until about 1874. Gundro Joul homesteaded on section 18, and lived there until the late seventies. Grove Lummis a single man, located on the southwest quarter of section 26, built a cabin, but soon after departed. A. A. Abbott took as his claim the northeast quarter of section 28 and became a permanent settler. Samuel Barnes took land in the vicinity. Nels Gilson settled just over the line Bigelow township. A. M. McCollum and two boys located at lake Ocheyda, just south of the isthmus, and lived in a dug-out. Nearly all of these settlers in the Indian lake and Ocheyda Lake countries brought families with them and became permanent settlers. Many of them are today living upon the land they took in that early day.\n\nThe census taken in the spring of 1870 had shown a population of only 117 people, but during the remainder of the year the emigration had been large, and by fall the population had very nearly doubled. This large increase and the prospects of very rapid settlement in the near future, due to knowledge that the railroad was coming, brought up the question of county organization. The act of 1857 creating the county was still in force, and all that was necessary to bring about the organization was to secure the appointment of three commissioners by the governor.\n\nThe matter was first discussed by the settlers during the first few days of October. Nearly all of the householders of the Graham lakes community had gathered at the home H. C. Hallett, who was conduction a \"house raising.\" There for the first time the matter was discussed. There was no formal meeting no \"whereases\" and \"therefores;\" the question was talked over, and afterwards a vote on the question was taken. There was no opposition, and the settlers then named Chas. H. Drury, B. W. Woolstencroft and Benjamin Harrison commissioners, who should take the necessary steps to bring about the organization. Mr. Woolstencroft wrote to Gov. Horace Austin, stating the facts and asking that official to name commissioner who should be empowered to set the machinery of county government in motion.\"\n\nFrom Chapter IX Political 1870-1874, page 123:\n\n\"The political history of Nobles county dated from the fall of the year 1870. When the settlers residing in the vicinity of Graham lakes determined that their needs warranted the organization of the county they asked Governor Horace Austin to appoint commissioners, who should perfect the organization under the provisions of the act of May 23, 1857,--the act of the legislature creating the county. The governor complied with the request of the settlers, and in September, 1870 appointed Benjamin W. Woolstencroft, Charles H. Drury and Benjamin Harrison commissioners, giving them authority to name the other county officials.\"\n\nIn May 1853 Benjamin married Calista Ruth Walton in Laporte County, Indiana (marriage record). Benjamin later married Henrietta M. Simms on 21 December 1862 in Nelson, Buffalo County, Wisconsin (marriage record). Benjamin and his first wife, \"Ruth\" had at least one daughter:\n\n13.4.1.1 Caroline Rebecca \"Calle\" Harrison was born on 17 April 1854 in Indiana and died on 3 February 1927 in Portland, Oregon. She is buried in City View Cemetery, Salem, Marion County, Oregon with her sister, Mary Rose (Harrison) Stiff. Caroline Harrison, daughter of Benjamin Harrison, was mentioned in the History of Nobles County, page 295:\n\nTHE WILD GIRL\n\n\"The history of Nobles county would be incomplete without a word about Caroline Harrison, \"the wild girl,\" who came to the Graham Lakes county with the early settlers and there lived the rude life of the trappers for a few years. Many stories of her doings --most of them of imaginative origin--have been told, to the effect that she was in reality a wild girl, that she lived alone in the timber on the lake, and that on one occasion she drove a party of surveyors out of the country at the point of a rifle.\n\nMiss Harrison was the eldest daughter of Benjamin Harrison, one of the commissioners appointed by Governor Horace Austin to organized Nobles county. Her mother died when she was quite young and Caroline became the companion of her father. Hunting and trapping, living on the frontier and denied the society of her own sex, she was at home in the company of the frontiersman. She could play the violin, shoot, trap, chew tobacco and occasionally swear. While she was short in stature she weighed perhaps 180 pounds, and, notwithstanding her weight, could walk thirty or thirty-five miles in a day, lift a twenty-five pound sack of shot from one shoulder to the other, swim a mile or more without apparent fatigue, and was in fact an athlete of no mean proportion .\n\nHer rough manners were the result of her association, as was demonstrated when she began her association with the neighbor women. She then began to check her rude habits, and before she left the county she had given up all except the violin. She afterward fell heir to a small sum of money and had the good sense to use it in obtaining an education.\"\n\nIn the 1860 Federal Census of the town of Nelson, Post Office Alma, Buffalo County, Wisconsin, page #43, Caroline is living with the Wilcox family:\n\n#406 348 E.D.

Their daughter, Rowena was living with Marius in 1900; in 1910 Rowena was living with Caroline. Sue has not located Marius in the 1910 census. Marius died in 1912 in Memphis, Shelby Co., Tennessee and his body was shipped to Beebe, Arkansas. His death record listed his parents as Samuel and Cynthia Thompson. He was was a riverman with the title of Captain, he died at the Marine Hospital in Memphis.\n\n1900 Census: Burlington Township, Becker County, Minnesota Microfilm roll number 1240756, ED 3, Vol. 2, Sheet 4, lines 48 through 52.

There was also another Harrison family in Mazeppa, James M. Harrison, the son of Ephraim's brother, Elias Stillwell Harrison, also resided there.\n\nIn the 1885 Minnesota State Census, the family was living in Osakis, Douglas County, Minnesota, family #51:\n\nHarrison, Benjamin male white 58 yr. old Indiana\n\nH.

On the 2nd of August the Judge ordered that Benjamin appear and also ordered Benjamin to be \"restrained from molesting or in any manner interfering with plaintiffs person or estate.\" A week later on 8 August 1901, Benjamin gave his deposition. Their divorce was declared final and the marriage dissolved on the 24th day of January 1902.\n\nAfter the divorce, Benjamin traveled into Alberta, Canada as did his youngest son George Harrison. Henrietta traveled a different path, she went west to Oregon with her daughters. Henrietta was remarried to Charles Bowers in Brainerd, Minnesota, on 14 February 1902. Sue Countryman contributed copies of their marriage record. Charles Bowers was living with his step-daughter, Mary (Harrison) Stiff in the 1920 Census (see below) after Henrietta's death. Benjamin Franklin Harrison died on 9 November 1908, in Foreman, Alberta, Canada according to his death certificate.
