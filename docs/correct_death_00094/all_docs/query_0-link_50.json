Mathes: I will now inform you of the death of my Father Joel COOMBS who died June 16, 1853, aged 73 years 11 months and 12 days. He moved to the Indiana territory when he was a young man, where he has resided ever since. He suffered a great deal of hardship and fatigue on the frontiers of Indiana; he was also one of the soldiers at the battle of Tippecanoe. He spent the prime of his days in folly and the vain things of this world. He was a member of the Christian Church for about nine or ten years, in the latter part of his life. he was not in his right mind for the last two years, and in a manner helpless.
