        "text": "President Benjamin Harrison\n\nKnown to some as the ''Human Iceberg,'' Benjamin Harrison was not the warmest of politicians. Though he was known as a great orator when it came to giving speeches, Harrison struggled with communicating on a personal level. He was stiff and reserved, but also smart and well-accomplished. His one term as president left a lasting impact on a country transitioning away from isolationism.\n\nEarly Life and Political Start\n\nBenjamin Harrison was born on August 20, 1833, in Ohio. He grew up in North Bend, Ohio, next to his grandfather's estate. As a child Harrison showed a profound interest in reading, a hobby he would carry with him his whole life. This carried over into his education, where he excelled. Harrison graduated close to the top of his class at the University of Miami, Ohio in 1852. The following year he got married to Caroline Scott, a woman he had known from his youth. Together they moved to Cincinnati where he studied law at the firm Storer and Gwynne. He passed the bar exam in 1854 and then moved his family to Indianapolis where he opened his own practice. It was at this time that Harrison became a member of the Republican Party.\n\nIn 1862, Harrison joined Seventieth Indiana Infantry Regiment to fight in the Civil War. Harrison quickly rose up the ranks, peaking at that of brigadier general. He served under General Sherman in his famous Atlanta Campaign, also known as ''Sherman's March to the Sea''. Sherman had high praise for Harrison, remarking well on his discipline and foresight.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Harrison returned to his legal career. In 1872 he made a failed attempt at Indiana's gubernatorial election, and he tried once more four years later. This time he succeeded at becoming the Republican nominee but lost the general election. Harrison was not dissuaded from a political career and soon turned his attention to the national stage. In the election of 1880, he was voted in as a US Senator by the Indiana State legislature. At the time senators were chosen by the state representatives instead of being directly elected by the people. Meaning, he never successfully won an election via a direct vote from the people until he ran for president eight years later.\n\nPresident Harrison\n\nHarrison announced his bid for the Republican nomination for president during the election of 1888. While he wasn't anyone's first choice as the nominee, he seemed to be everybody's second choice, making him a compromise candidate. Harrison was given the nomination on the 8th ballot of the Republican National Convention in Chicago. He ran his campaign under the slogan ''Rejuvenated Republicanism.'' The general election on the whole was a relatively mild affair. President Grover Cleveland only made one public appearance, and Harrison did not do much more than that. Instead, the candidates left the campaigning to their respective parties. Harrison ran on a platform that supported high protective tariffs and was strongly in favor of pensions for Civil War veterans. In a historic outcome, Benjamin Harrison would become the first president to win an outright majority of the electoral college but lose the popular vote. Since then this has only ever happened on two other occasions: during the election of 2000 by President George W. Bush and in 2016 by President Donald Trump.\n\nHis year as president in 1890 was his most accomplished year. He signed several bills into law including the Dependent Pension Bill, which had personal importance to Harrison. This bill gave pensions to all who served in the Union Army for longer than 90 days. Harrison had been pushing for pensions for Union soldiers since his days in the Senate. In the same year, he also signed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act into law. This law attempted to restrict robber barons' abilities to create monopolies. It didn't have the immediate effect that the president or congress had hoped, but it would be strengthened by later presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt, who used it to great effect.\n\nElectoral Map of 1888\n\nLater Life and Death\n\nHarrison lost his bid for re-election in 1892 to President Grover Cleveland, the president who he had previously beaten. This marks the first and only time a president has ever returned to office in such a manner. Some sought to nominate him again in 1896, but Harrison declined in support of William McKinley who would go on the win the election that year. He spent his later years serving on the board of trustees at Purdue University, passing away in the year 1901 of pneumonia\n\nRoots in the Midwest\n\nBenjamin Harrison was born on August 20, 1833, just north of Cincinnati, Ohio. His family had a political legacy dating back to the 1770s. He attended college in Ohio and studied law, entering the profession after graduation and moving to Indiana. Holding a number of local government positions, such as court reporter and county clerk, he enlisted in the Civil War and raised his own regiment to serve his country.\n\nThough successful at the local level, Harrison was defeated in his first large-scale election, in which he ran for governor of Indiana. He would be elected to the US Senate in 1880, and in 1888 he declared his intention to run for president as a Republican. He used a front porch approach to campaigning to win the White House. This meant he remained in Indiana and made campaign speeches to those who came to see him, versus travelling the country to campaign. Totally different than today, don't you think?\n\nHarrison's Presidency\n\nWhen Harrison entered the White House, he was faced with many domestic and foreign policy issues that would define his presidency. Lasting from 1889-1893, Harrison's term saw moderate success and left an enduring legacy that would benefit future leaders more than it benefited him.\n\nThough fought more than 20 years prior, the Civil War and its outcome plunged the nation into a long period of economic rebuilding. Harrison felt that international help was the best way to fully restart the American economy, given the Industrial Revolution that was improving the production of goods and services and making businesses a lot of money across the globe. And don't forget, money is a huge motivator!\n\nHarrison pushed international cooperation to help the US recover and focused on two areas. First, pirates and other bandits threatened shipping routes, so Harrison built up the U.S. Navy into a fleet of mighty battleships for protection and to send a message. Second, he supported the 1890 McKinley Tariff Act, a law that heavily taxed imports from other countries and made the U.S. a significant amount of money.\n\nHarrison used these two successes to create positive relationships with other nations in the Western Hemisphere, especially those in Latin America. This strong cooperation would enable future presidents to better protect American interests.\n\nThere were also domestic issues during Harrison's term. For example, immigration of foreigners to the U.S. was beginning to increase significantly. In fact, it would be this way for the next forty years, and many of us come from families that emigrated during that time.\n\nBut there was no consistent policy as to who was allowed in, where they entered the U.S., and what was done after they arrived. Harrison created standards for immigration that led to a consistent approach for entry into the U.S., one that would be continued under future presidents.\n\nPlace and location of arrival was one such standard. In 1892, Harrison opened Ellis Island as the main point of entry for those coming to the U.S. The reception center would see millions of immigrants pass through its gates and leave a lasting legacy of the American experience long past Harrison's term.\n\nTwo additional accomplishments would mark the legacy of Harrison domestically. The first involves National Parks that we know and enjoy today. Harrison pioneered the creation of such places as Casa Grande in Arizona, Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks in California, and Sitka National Historical Park in Alaska. Though Teddy Roosevelt, the 26th President, is known for his work with protected lands and parks, his success can be traced to Harrison's efforts."
