        "text": "First opened in 1966, Harrison Hall was named after Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd president of the United States and the most famous man to have served on the Board of Trustees of Purdue University.\n\nHaving been born on August 20, 1833 in North Bend, Ohio, Benjamin Harrison was the grandson of the ninth United States president, William Henry Harrison. Benjamin Harrison was a student at Cary Farmer's College near Cincinnati and later at Miami University in Ohio. Having graduated from Miami University in 1852, Harrison read law in Cincinnati. He then moved to Indianapolis, where he practiced law and campaigned for the Republic Party.\n\nWith the advent of the Civil War, he organized a regiment of volunteers of which he became the Colonel. At the end of the war, he held the rank brevet brigadier general.\n\nAfter his service as a Union officer Harrison returned to practicing law and political interest. He was elected to the United States Senate from Indiana in 1881. Then, in 1888 he was elected President of the United States. During his term as president, Harrison's administration was marked by an innovative foreign policy and expanding U.S. influence abroad. In 1890, due to an economic depression in the agrarian west and south, the Democrats were able to recapture the House of Representatives by a large majority. Thus, during the remaining two years of his term Harrison had little influence on legislation. In 1892, Harrison was defeated for re-election by Governor Grover Cleveland. After this election, Harrison returned to his law practice in Indianapolis.\n\nDespite the high office that he held and the many duties of a busy life, Mr. Harrison maintained his interest in youth and education. During his tenure as a trustee, July 1895 to March 1901, Harrison gave the benefit of his vast experience in public life and world affairs. Benjamin Harrison died in Indianapolis on March 13, 1901.\n\nAdam Brooks"
