He has won numerous teaching awards. Before joining the Honors program he was interim dean and assistant dean for undergraduate affairs in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. Among other things, he was instrumental in the design and implementation of the Residential Honors College at Hume Hall.\n\nDr. Drummond can answer questions regarding: The Honors Program, Advising in Hume and Hume Technical Assistance.\" [University of Florida website, 2007]\n\nFrom email of May 2007: Ray and Velma Foor Drummond are my paternal grandparents. Ray was a Methodist minister who worked in northern Colorado and Wyoming going into communities where there was no church and establishing one. As he got the congregation established, they moved on to another unserved community. One of those communities was Lander, Wyoming (not Leander). Several years ago my father went to a high school reunion there, so they were there in the early 1930's.\n\nI think (I will check it out with the authority) that my father was born on June 8, 1916 in Xenia , Ohio . He is one of four sons Ray and Velma had-Don, Harold, Wendell, and William in that order. Wendell and William live here in Gainesville , so at the next visit I will get full names, birthplace and date. They married a pair of sisters-Shirley and Venus. The latter passed away this past fall when we were on sabbatical in sourthwest China .\n\nMy father married Erma Catherine Street (Drummond) on Aug. 31, 1939. I was born in Salt Lake City , Utah a true war-baby as my father was in the South Pacific. My mother welded Liberty ships up through six months when he left. I was 23 months when he returned. My mother died in the 1980's and my father has remarried to Josephine. They live in Albuquerque . I will try to get more specific information.\n\nI am married to Mary Ellen Glenn (Drummond). She was born on June 2, 1946 in Normal , Illinois and we were married on April 5, 1969. We have two kids-Laura Katherine Drummond Lozada, born May 7, 1973 in Stillwater, OK and Eric Glenn Drummond born May 4, 1977 in Edmund, OK (I will check dates with my wife this evening).\n\nI am going to check with both of our kids to get all of the correct facts on that piece of the family and will convey it to you.\n\nRay died in about 1951 and Velma was killed in an auto accident outside of Van Wert in 1967 or 68. After Ray's death, she moved to Bowling Green and I visited her frequently when I was a graduate student at Purdue. I remember one Thanksgiving gathering in Van Wert getting into a strong argument with some of Velma's relatives because of my anti-war ( Viet Nam ) sentiments. Ray and Velma are burried in Greeley , Colorado .\n\nHOME\n\nHTML created by GED2HTML v3.5e-WIN95 (Sep 26 1998) on 11/07/2015 05:14:53 .\n\nJulie Anne DUBAY\n\n[29258]\n\n16 Jul 1974 - ____\n\nBIRTH: 16 Jul 1974\n\nFather: Timothy Leroy DUBAY\n\nMother: Jackie WILLIAMS\n\n_Timothy Leroy DUBAY _+ | |--Julie Anne DUBAY | |_Jackie WILLIAMS _____\n\nINDEX\n\n[29258] NAME/DOB: From Nicole Foor via Nov. 2007 email.\n\nHOME\n\nHTML created by GED2HTML v3.5e-WIN95 (Sep 26 1998) on 11/07/2015 05:14:53 .\n\nOrchid ELIAS\n\n[11819]\n\n18 Apr 1961 - ____\n\nBIRTH: 18 Apr 1961\n\nDEATH: of Grover Beach,San Luis Obispo Co.,Ca\n\nFamily 1 : Bobby Dean FOOR\n\nMARRIAGE: Feb 1984\n\n+Elizabeth Marie FOOR\n\nChristina Rose FOOR\n\n__ | |--Orchid ELIAS | |__\n\nINDEX\n\n[11819] NAME/DOM: Via Annette FOOR, email, June 2000.\n\nDOB: from anybirthday.com\n\nHOME\n\nHTML created by GED2HTML v3.5e-WIN95 (Sep 26 1998) on 11/07/2015 05:14:53 .\n\nWillis M.
