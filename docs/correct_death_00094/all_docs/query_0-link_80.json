        "text": "All of us have a \"brick wall\" somewhere in our research! It's that elusive ancestor that just doesn't seem to exist! I will be posting emailed queries sent to me by people who are searching for their \"brick wall\" ancestors. Please take time to look them over and if you have info that could help these folks, please let them know!\n\nPosted 04/13/2015 Surnames: McEndre\n\nI'm searching for information about the parents of my 3rd Great Grandfather born around 1808. His name is Robert McEndre. I've searched using Ancestry.com and seen the family name spelled in a variety of ways through the generations: McEndree/McAndre/McCandree. Any of these might be used for Robert's name. Robert married Catherine Dunn in Henry Co. in 1831, and fathered George M McEndre (b. 1833), John Ruben McEndre (b. 1835), James D McEndre (b. 1841), and several more children subsequently. John Ruben, my 2nd Great Grandfather, fathered a son named Robert Layton McEndre (b. 1862). I have found records of a Bunyan McAndre (b. 1765) in the area that I am hopeful may be connected. Bunyan fathered Reuben McAndre (b. 1780), John McAndre (b. 1784), and several more children subsequently. Reuben married Elizabeth Sullinger in 1800, and fathered Layton McAndre (b. 1805). I have not been able to find any records that connect Robert to this family. But Robert's birth date would fit easily into Reuben's family. Furthermore, it's very interesting that the names Ruben, John, and Layton appear in the names of my ancestors as well as in the names of the Bunyan McAndre family.\n\nThere is a death record in the \"Kentucky Death Records, 1852-1953\" for a man named Robt McEndre, which is the basis for the death date you cited: 29 May 1856. I've not seen any other source for his death date. The death record shows very little about Robt McEndre - nothing about his age, occupation, cause of death, place of birth or residence Place of death is Carroll Co. But of the few things it recorded about him, it included a name for Parent: \"Wm Winan\" which creates more questions than it answers... The death date 1856 fits the census records: Robert is listed with his wife and children in the 1850 census, and he is not included with his wife and children in the 1860 census. Any help with this would be very appreciated, thanks, Chris, chrisolga@gmail.com\n\nPosted 04/12/15 Surnames: Roberts\n\nI'm trying to find a marriage record for John T. Roberts (1814-1850) and Amanda Smith Roberts (1816-1901). I believe John T. is the son of James and Betsy Roberts. James was a wealthy land/ slave owner in Henry County. He had a son, John T., who inherited one of his farms. Family Search indicates that John and Amanda were married on September 26, 1837. I cannot find a marriage record for them. I'm hoping that if it turns up, it will list John's parents. Can anyone help me find this document? Thanks! Diane Steiner, disteiner@gmail.com\n\nPosted 01/11/15 Surnames: Wells\n\nI am searching for my ancestor Littleberry Wells who was born 3 Apr 1762 in Dinwiddie, Virginia. He was in the VA Militia during the Revolutionary War. He later moved to Henry County, Kentucky. He apparently passed in 1848 and his will was probated in Henry County that same year. I found a record saying that he was buried in Steverson Cemetery in Bethlehem, KY. My problem now is that I cannot find any record of the cemetery. I would appreciate any help in finding the cemetery and if any trace of his grave still exists a photo of the site. I know that a lot changes in 150 years but I would love to find this burial site. Thank you for any help, Reba Wells Corley, rjcorley161@yahoo.com\n\nPosted 11/24/14 Surnames: Hardin\n\nDANIEL HARDIN (c1789-c1856), son of Benjamin Hardin(g) and Nancy Routt, husband of Rebecca Kelly Hardin. Daniel served in the War of 1812 at the Battle of the Thames. Searching for his place of burial in Henry or Owen Countiies; his father, wife and at least one child are buried at O'Nan-Hardin Cemetery. Also trying to locate the Hardin family bible. Daniel is my 4th great-grandfather through daughter Nancy. I would love to contact other direct descendants. Please send emails to rpvpaula@gmail.com. Thank you for any help.\n\nPosted 05/08/14 Surnames: Robinson\n\nLooking for the parents of my grandfather on my motherï¿½s side. His name was James Lewis Robinson and he was born June 20, 1904 in Eminence, KY. and passed away September 10, 1965 in Indianapolis, IN. He was an African-American male. He had four children with two different wives- Jesse Lee (surname?) and Mary Eleanor Bryant. Childrenï¿½sï¿½ names are James Lewis Robinson, Jr., Margaret Frances Robinson, Ivalue Robinson and Lucia Emma Robinson. I am also told he had a step-brother named Owen Robinson and two step-sisters named Lizzie Mae Smith and Rosa Lee Walker. Also had an aunt named Daisy Barnhill who he stayed with for a short while in Indianapolis, IN. I have also started a family tree online at ancestry.com and have tried to do some research on the website but have not had any luck in finding out who his parents were and who his (blood) siblings were, if he had any. I do not live in KY so physically visiting there to do some research is not possible at this time. I would appreciate any and all leads/information you might be able to share in helping me continue my family research. Any help with my family would be greatly appreciated! Wayne A. Wellington, well7440@bellsouth.net\n\nPosted 06/20/2011 Surnames: Adams / Kirkwood / Jackson\n\nIn the Oldham, Henry, Jefferson County area there were 3 KIRKWOOD siblings married to 3 ADAMS siblings. The ADAMS siblings were children of William and Nancy ___ ADAMS of York County, PA and Henry County, Kentucky. There were no KIRKWOOD elders in the area so their father must have been deceased and the mother remarried or also dead. On Oct 9 1796 in Jefferson Co. MARTHA KIRKWOOD md MARTIN ADAMS bondsman was JOHN JACKSON, Jr. This couple seems to have disappeared from Kentucky. On 21 Jan 1800 MARY KIRKWOOD b 10 May 1776 d 12 Oct 1850 md FRANCIS ADAMS b 15 Apr 1776 d 10 Jun 1834. Bondsman was JOHN JACKSON. Mary and Francis lived and died just over the Jefferson Co line in Oldham Co. off the old River Road. On 5 Jul 1810 WILLIAM KIRKWOOD md Naomi Morrison d of Hugh wit was Levi Tyler. He married 2ndon 28 Aug 1820 to NANCY ADAMS d of FRANCIS ADAMS. FRANCIS ADAMS was bondman. It appears William married his niece. The only reference I have found to the origin of the KIRKWOOD family was the 1850 census for Mary Kirkwood Adams says she was born Virginia. There were KIRKWOODï¿½S in York Co Pa. but no connection has been found. Since JOHN JACKSON was bondsman for both girlsï¿½ marriages I assume there is a family tie. Any information on any these people could be a help and will be appreciated. Thanks,\n\nMartha Easter measter@cfl.rr.com\n\nPosted 05/02/2011 Surnames: Thompson\n\nNelson P. Thompson was born in what is now Oldham CO., KY, Jan 1812. I have seen estimates as late as 1814. He died, I believe some time between 1 Jun 1885 and 1897 in Bent CO., Colorado. Both his parents were born in VA. He married 20 Sep 1833, Telitha P. Van Cleave d/o David and Rachel Sweringen Van Cleave, in Decatur CO.,IN. Telitha was born 14 Feb 1810, Shelby CO., KY but by 1933 her family had moved to Decatur CO., IN. Nelson and Telitha may have stayed in Indiana maybe long enough to have at least there first child James C. Thompson but by the time of the 1840 census they were in Western Div., Henry CO., KY. By 1850,Clay CO., ILL. 1860,Bates CO., MO. 1870,Not Found, 1880,Bates CO., MO. 1 Jun 1885, enumeration dist. 2,Bent CO., Colorado. with his son Archibald H.M. Thompson and his family. Telitha died 24 Oct 1861, Bates CO., MO. His son Archibald was in Los Angeles by at least 1897. As far as I have been able to find, Nelson never made it to Los Angeles. Children of Nelson P. and Telitha P. Van Cleave Thompson: CH: 1) James C. Thompson M: Mary Elizabeth Thacker. 2) Rachel Amanda Thompson M: David Landreth 3) Elizabeth C. Thompson M: William Alexander Drake 4) David Edmond Thompson M: Lucinda Abigail Drake 5) Archibald H.M. Thompson M: Sarah Elizabeth Cohee 6) Van G.S. Thompson: Seems to have died young.\n\n\" 7) Mary Drusilla Thompson M: Nathaniel Anderson Griffitts. Nelson named his first daughter Rachel after Telithas' mother Rachel Swaringen. I believe He may have named his first son James C. Thompson or his second son David Edmond Thompson after his Own Father. I Have found James', Davids' and Archibalds' in that area of Kentucky. Also I believe there is a good chance that he named his second daughter Elizabeth C. Thompson after his mother. All this of course is speculation, but may give clues to his parents. Nelson P. Thompson is my wifes' gggrandfather. Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated. You may contact me at the following email wparham@bak.rr.com. Thank You So Much, Walt Parham\n\nPosted 03/24/2011 Surnames: Glenn / Knuckles\n\nI am conducting genealogical research into my Great-great Grandparents, John F. Glenn & Mary E. Knuckles, of Newcastle, Henry County, Kentucky. My research indicates that John served in the Company A, of the 5 U.S. Colored Calvary. John enlisted in 1864. Further, my research indicates that John married Mary in 1864. I'm seeking in obtaining information about their marriage, and the birth of their children. I'm interested to know if Negros/Blacks were allowed to marry in Kentucky, 1864? If so, were they allowed to marry in a church, or was there some sort of Freedman's Bureau in operation to conduct the wedding? Or is it possible that the Army conducted the wedding? John & Mary had four children born in Henry County, are there any records of negro births in the county? Thank you for taking time to answer my question, and I'm sure your responses will help me in my research. Thank you in advance Rodney B. Caulton, caulton@att.net\n\nPosted 03/20/2011 Surnames: Lindsey\n\nI am of the Lindsey/Devine family from Smithfield. I used to live in Eminence as a child. I am trying to submit a DAR application with John Charles Lindsey as my patriot. My grandfather is Claude Lindsey married Clella O'Nan. I can not connect John Lindsey 1758-1838 who resided in Henry County and has a court document for his pension from the\n\nRevolutionary War to John Lindsey 1794-1861 who married Harriet Basey in Henry County in 1816. Their son David Oliver Lindsey is my great-great grandfather. At some point John Jr would have moved to Scott Co as I\n\nthink David was born there and John Jr died there. Do you have any documents or ideas to help in my search? Thank you, Kathy Lindsey Miller, tkmiller1215@earthlink.net\n\nPosted 03/05/2011 Surnames: Jackson\n\nI'm looking for more info. about Simion Jackson b. 1844, married Margret in Guestville, Ky. 1880.\n\nWho were his parents? Any help appreciated, Ronnie Jackson, waterboy1968@gmail.com\n\nPosted 03/03/2011 Surnames: Roberts\n\nI'm trying to find the parents of John Noble Roberts, b. 1827 in Henry Co., Ky. John is my g-g-grandfather. John married Sarah Ann Shuck in 1849 (Henry Co., Ky.). There is a connection to Hiram Roberts. Hiram signed the marriage bond between John Roberts and Sarah Ann Shuck. I'm not sure if Hiram is related to John or to Sarah Ann, since both John and Hiram signed the bond. John Roberts and Sarah Ann Shuck had the following children: Sarah Elizabeth, John David, Wm. Preston, Edmond Thomas, Hannah Margaret, Lorenzo Dow (there are two in Henry at the same time; very confusing, but\n\nI've figured out this is my g-grandfather who married Lydia Shuck), Mary Francis, and James Roberts. Any help is appreciated. Or if you have a family connection, I'd love to\n\nsee what you know. Thanks, Tammy Shaw, hubert@bluegrass.net\n\nPosted 03/01/2011 Surnames: Cook\n\nAccording to Kentucky death records, my grandmother, Lena Cook (married name Kinman) was born in Henry County on 5/25/1902. I believe her father's name was Levy or Levi Cook (born 1879 in Owen County). The 1900 census shows him single and living in Port Royal as a hired hand for the Castleman family. Then the 1910 census shows him living back in Owen County. It shows his status as divorced. It appears that between 1900 and 1910, he was married, had a child (Lena Cook) and was divorced all in Henry County. I have been unable to find any of these records. A divorce during that time would have been scandalous I am sure. I would just like the know my great-grandmother's name and what happened to her. Thanks for any help, Karen Frans, karen_frans356@hotmail.com\n\nPosted 02/27/2011 Surnames: Long\n\nI am looking for the death record of Willis Long, b. 1825 or 1826, Franklin Co., KY.

Our name is currently spelled \"Mellons,\" but it may have varied long ago. Some of my family members still spell it without the \"s\" on the end. I have traced back to my fourth-great grandfather, Jacob, born in 1798, supposedly in the District of Columbia area. I have received new information that a woman named Cythia Mellon(s) was born in Culpeper County, VA, in the 1750s. She married a man named Warner Ford and they moved to Henry County. My source tells me that she would guess my fifth-great grandfather (Jacob's father) may be the brother or nephew of this woman, Cythia. It had been rumored that Jacob's father may have been from Kentucky. I hope I am on my way to tying in this missing link.

I believe his parents were Samuel W. and Nancy Kitson Adams, but as I can't find this family in the 1880 census, I can't prove this. Also, Earnest M. may have had a prior marriage to his marriage to Ida Belle Adams (daughter of Isaac and Martha Ann Adams) in 1896. I think Earnest had a son, Lee Roy Adams, from this first marriage.

His father died in 1891 and his mother died in 1883. Richard told his family that he had ridden the Orphan Train and we do believe he did, even though so far no record has been found (and evidence points to his not being adopted out) so he ended up back in Henry County. He had a guardian, James RODGERS and was listed\n\nin the 1897 School Census for Blackwell in Henry County. Richard told the family that his sister and brother rode with him. On the 1880 census for Pleasureville, Henry County, Richard's siblings that were at home are\n\nlisted: Isaiah VEST, age 6 and Sarah Christina VEST, age 3. These children would have had to been the ones that rode the train with him. No one knows what happened to them. Did they ride or did they die? We\n\nwould like to have closure on them since this has been a brick wall for some time. Can anyone help with this???

The reference I have is 1803-1824 FHL US/CAN Film 828254, Henry County KY Court Orders 3:1 and begins \"At court held 19 Jan 1808, Sarah Stark widow and relict of Joseph Stark......\" The children in the record fit the Joseph Stark I'm trying to research, but his wife's name should be Hannah. I've been in touch with some Stark researchers like Gwen Bjorkman and she wondered if someone had copied the record incorrectly, having not seen the original. (Joseph and Hannah Stark had a daughter Anna who married, 19 Jan 1812, Henry Co., Samuel Hayes. His father Samuel may have come directly from Ireland to Henry Co.)
