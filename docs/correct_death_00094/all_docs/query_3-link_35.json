        "text": "In the 1850s, a young man from Ohio, ready to begin his career as a lawyer, pondered where to practice his new profession, considering Cincinnati, Chicago, and Indianapolis. The attorney, Benjamin Harrison, visited Indianapolis in March 1854 and decided to make the city home. The choice pleased his father, who wrote that the Harrison name would be enough to pave his way and the citizens would love him as they loved his grandfather, William Henry Harrison.\n\nIn 1888 Harrison beat incumbent Grover Cleveland, becoming the twenty-third U.S. president. Although he served only one term, defeated for re-election by Cleveland in 1892, Harrison had some impressive achievements during his four years in the White House. His administration worked to have Congress pass the Sherman Antitrust Act to limit business monopolies, fought to protect voting rights for African American citizens in the South, preserved millions of acres for forest reserves and national parks, modernized the American navy, and negotiated several successful trade agreements with other countries in the Western Hemisphere. As First Lady, Caroline Harrison also added luster to the administration, fighting to improve a White House that had fallen into disrepair, advocating on behalf of fine arts, and serving as the first president-general of the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nAfter losing the White House, Harrison returned to Indianapolis, once again becoming one of the city s leading citizens. He died from pneumonia on March 13, 1901, in his home on North Delaware Street.\n\nMr. President: A Life of Benjamin Harrison, is part of the multivolume Indiana Historical Society Press youth biography series."
