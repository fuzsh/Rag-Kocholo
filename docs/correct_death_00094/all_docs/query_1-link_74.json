        "text": "NORTH BEND, Ohio – President William Henry Harrison is buried in North Bend. His grandson and the country's 23rd President Benjamin Harrison was born here.\n\nThe gravesite of President William Henry Harrison sits on a hill in the small, southwest Ohio town.\n\nThe Harrison-Symmes Memorial Foundaiton Museum takes care of the gravesite with assistance from the Ohio History Connection\n\nNorth Bend is home to more than just U.S. Presidents\n\nOf Ohio's claim to eight U.S. presidents the small town of North Bend claims two.\n\nThe town of roughly 800 people is 15 miles west of Cincinnati and about five miles east of the Indiana border. Nestled on the northern banks of the Ohio River it is home to some important figures in U.S. History.\n\nFour generals hail from the North Bend area.\n\nJohn Cleves Symmes, a judge of the Northwest Territory called North Bend home after leaving New Jersey as a member of the Continental Congress. Symmes helped found North Bend and was the father-in-law of President William Henry Harrison.\n\nPresident William Henry Harrison, actually born in Virginia, moved to North Bend in the 1790s while still serving in the military. He met his wife, Anna Tuthill Symmes, and they had ten children.\n\nHarrison died just one month after taking the Oath of Office. His gravesite sits on a hill in North Bend that was once a part of his large estate.\n\nHis grandson, Benjamin Harrison, was elected president and took office in 1889. After living parts of his childhood in North Bend, he attended Miami University in nearby Oxford. After studying law in southwest Ohio he eventually moved to Indianapolis. President Benjamin Harrison was buried in Indianapolis at the Crown Hill Cemetery.\n\nNorth Bend is a small town. There is no grocery store or gas station. The adjoining town of Cleves is home to the Harrison-Symmes Memorial Foundation Museum. It has been run by a group of volunteers since the mid-90s to assist the Ohio History Connection with preservation of Harrison's tomb.\n\n“There's 11 people in the tomb, but they're all relatives of the Harrison's,” said Beverly Meyers, president of the foundation. “President Harrison's there, Mrs. Harrison is there, John Scott Harrison is there. Some of them are in unmarked graves. Some of them are grandchildren.”\n\nThe foundation museum only receives about $10,000 a year in funding from the Ohio History Connection. Enough to keep the lights on and undertake light maintenance projects. Bigger projects are handled by the state, but those are far-and-few between.\n\nMeyers said the group of volunteers is beginning to explore what it might take to get federal designation.\n\nAs for the museum, it contains artifacts the group purchases around the country. It contains historic information, pictures, and information about not just President William Henry Harrison, but other famous residents of Miami Township – for which North Bend is a part of.\n\n“We see a lot of visitors. We have probably 2,500 people that come to the tomb a year, they sign in. And most of them probably don't sign in.”\n\nThroughout North Bend, there are subtle signs of its presidential history.\n\nAmerican Flags wave in the wind perched outside a number of homes. The Presidential Community Park boasts colorful flowers, a picnic area, and a playground. Appropriately named streets like Washington and Taylor carry drivers to-and-from the post office or the village offices.\n\nAnother interesting historic note about North Bend (and Cleves) is the Cincinnati and Whitewater Canal.\n\n“It's the longest canal tunnel built in the United States west of the Allegheny Mountains,” Meyers said. “It was 1,700 feet long and it was an engineering feat.”\n\nThe North Bend end of the canal, once on the property of President William Henry Harrison, is no longer visible. On the Cleves end, tucked away in the woods, is a peek of the canal.\n\nThe opening is overgrown with weeds and trees and filled with silt.\n\nIt was used to transport goods into Cincinnati. After the canal was built in 1838 it was only operational until 1856. The railroad used it until 1884 but it has been abandoned ever since.\n\n“It's on the national historic register,” Meyers said. “But it has never been cleaned out.”\n\nNorth Bend is also home to the Congress Green Cemetery, once on the Harrison property. It contains rare Buffalo Clover, according to the town's website.\n\nSara Piatt, a famous 19th century poet, lived in North bend.\n\nSo did John Aston Warder, a Brigade Surgeon of the First Brigade during the Civil War. His love of horticulture saw him appointed as the U.S. Commissioner to the Vienna World's Exposition and his experience helped launch the American Forestry Association, now known as American Forests and the longest-serving forest conservation non-profit group in the U.S.\n\nNorth Bend was also the birthplace of Eliza Hendricks, the wife of Vice President Thomas Hendricks.\n\nMeyers said every year on President William Henry Harrison's birthday a wreath is sent to the town by the current President of the United States. A tradition that started with President Gerald Ford.\n\nA U.S. military general accompanies the wreath and there is usually a stop at the nearby Three Rivers schools followed by a ceremony at the tomb."
