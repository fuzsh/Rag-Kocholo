His father, John Scott Harrison, was a U.S. Representative from Ohio, and his grandfather was William Henry Harrison, ninth President of the United States. Benjamin Harrison was raised in Ohio and attended Miami University (Oxford, Ohio). After graduating in 1852, Harrison studied law for two years at a Cincinnati law firm. In 1853, he married Caroline Scott with whom he had two children, Russell and Mary.\n\nAfter a year of marriage, the Harrisons moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where Benjamin Harrison established a law firm. In 1855, he joined the practice of William Wallace (father of Lew Wallace). He was elected Indianapolis City Attorney in 1857. He also served as reporter for the Indiana Supreme Court. In 1862, Oliver P. Morton asked Harrison to recruit men for the 70th Indiana Volunteers. Harrison served throughout the Civil War and reached the rank of Brigadier General. From 1874 to 1889, he was the law partner of William Henry Harrison Miller. Harrison was narrowly defeated in the 1876 gubernatorial election by James Williams. In 1879, he was appointed a member of the Mississippi River Commission. He served three terms as a U.S. Senator (1881-1887).\n\nIn 1888, he was elected President of the United States. Among his accomplishments were the first Pan American Congress and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Towards the end of his term, his wife Caroline died of tuberculosis. Harrison failed to win reelection in 1892, perhaps partially due to his distraction from the campaign when his wife died. After leaving office, he returned to Indianapolis and his law practice. In 1896, he married Caroline’s niece, Mary Lord Dimmick. He served as senior counsel for Venezuela in its boundary dispute with Great Britain before an arbitration tribunal in Paris (1899). He remained an active writer and lecturer until his death on March 13, 1901, of pneumonia.\n\nSources:\n\nAmerican President: Benjamin Harrison.

United States Congress. 2 Mar. 2006.\n\n\"Harrison Family.\" President Benjamin Harrison Home. 2 Mar. 2006.\n\nScope and Content Note:\n\nThe bulk of the collection consists of invoices and receipts for Harrison’s personal and household expenses in Indianapolis (1893-1897) and for expenses incurred in the construction of his Indianapolis home (1874-1875).\n\nThe correspondence includes Harrison’s letter (1896-1900) to his law partner, W. H. H. Miller, regarding Republican Party politics, Harrison’s work in the Venezuelan boundary dispute, investments, and family and personal matters; letters regarding a federal appointment for his son, Russell B. Harrison (1875-1881); letters and invitations relating to the Harrison’s social life in Washington, D.C. (1889-1893); copies of letters to Judge R. S. Taylor; and scattered letters regarding politics and Harrison’s writings.\n\nOther items include notebooks containing names and notes on political supporters (1881); campaign materials and programs from Harrison’s presidential campaign and inauguration (1888-1889); two articles written by Harrison about life in the White House (1897); biographical pamphlets printed during his presidential campaign and shortly after he was elected (1888-1889); and the “Catalogue of Library and Index to Vocal and Instrumental Music” by Lizzie S. Lord, Caroline Scott Harrison’s niece (1866).\n\nThe collection is organized into correspondence, speeches, other printed materials, and financial records. The correspondence, speeches, and financial records are organized chronologically as is each type of printed material.\n\nBox and Folder Listing:\n\nBox 1, Folder 1.
