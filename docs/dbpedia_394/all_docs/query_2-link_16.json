Roach's Rascals or The Little Rascals).\n\nHe had operated as an independent since 1918 with a Path√© distribution deal. In the 1930s, as his short subjects kingdom was threatened by double features and block booking, he sold his backlog of independently-produced shorts to his distributor MGM in order to convert to feature filmmaking with films like the Topper trilogy. In 1938 Roach moved his production company to United Artists, and produced Of Mice and Men (1939) and One Million B.C. (1940).\n\nSOURCES:\n\nMaltin and Bann, Our Gang; Dardis, Harold Lloyd, pp. 54-55"
