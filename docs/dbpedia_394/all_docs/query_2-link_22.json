        "text": "Hal Roach Hal Roach was an American producer and director who created some of the most successful and long lasting comedy series in movie history. He is best known today for first recognising the comic potential of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and for then producing the Laurel and Hardy and Our Gang film comedy series.\n\nHis Laurel and Hardy short 'The Music Box' won the first ever Academy Award for Best Comedy Short but at the time Oscar statuettes were not presented for this category so instead a Certificate was presented. Later Hal gave this to Stan Laurel.\n\nIn 1984, Roach, then aged 92,was presented with an honorary Academy Award to honour his \"unparalleled record of distinguished contributions to the motion picture art form.\"\n\nBiography\n\nHe was born Harry Eugene Roach in Elmira, New York on January 14, 1892. His father was of Irish ancestry and his mother from Swiss stock.\n\nHe left home in his teens and became a gold prospector and mule skinner in Alaska until, at age twenty in 1912, he spotted an ad placed by Hollywood's Universal Pictures offering a dollar a day for genuine cowboys to act as western technical advisers. According to his own account, he was a terrible actor but he spent the next year as a stunt man and extra, during which time he made the acquaintance of another young actor called Harold Lloyd.\n\nHarold Lloyd\n\nIn 1914 Roach received a small inheritance and he used it to start a film production business. He bought an office in Los Angeles' Bradbury Mansion, and using the name Phun Philms, began producing, directing and writing a series of short film comedies starring Lloyd, who portrayed a character called Lonesome Luke. For 2 years from 1916 the \"Luke\" comedies were released through PathÃ© and became very popular. Late in 1917 Lloyd started to play himself in his \"glasses\" character. Roach ensured a top quality product by setting up a preview system, screening the movies before a test audience and then editing them as necessary for full comic impact. The result was that Harold Lloyd became the most popular movie comedian in America.\n\nThe Hal Roach Studios\n\nRoach purchased what became the Hal Roach Studios from Harry Culver in Culver City, California and in 1919 expanded his comedy team, adding actors such as Snub Pollard, \"Sunshine\" Sammy Morrison and a certain Stan Laurel. He was also very astute in giving opportunity to creative non actors such as writers and directors as Charley Chase, Alf Goulding, and Fred Newmeyer, who controlled the output while Roach concentrated on administrative duties.\n\nLaurel and Hardy\n\nIn 1924, and already a well known face in silent movies, comic actor Oliver Hardy signed with the Hal Roach studios, working with such headline acts as Our Gang and Charley Chase. He appeared in the 'Comedy All-Stars' series, and he came into contact with the young British comic, Stan Laurel, who had also signed with Roach as a writer and director. Stan directed Oliver in the movie 'Yes, Yes Nanette' in 1925.\n\nDuring 1926 Laurel became a regular and important part of the Hal Roach All-Stars and was given more performing roles by Roach. It gradually became obvious that whenever he and Oliver were in the same scene together, some special comic spark was ignited. At first there was no real effort to make them a team but as they appeared in more films together, their partnership became inevitable. Roach's supervising director was future Academy Award-winning director, Leo McCarey, and he began teaming them together deliberately. Gradually the comedians began to develop the characters and interaction which have become so familiar today.\n\nTheir first film as a comedy team was 1927's \"Putting Pants on Philip\". Together they began producing a large number of short brilliant comic films. The team of Laurel and Hardy was born.\n\nOur Gang\n\nRoach and Harold Lloyd had a volatile relationship and they went their separate ways in 1924, when Lloyd became the independent producer of his own films. Despite losing his biggest earner, Roach was already preoccupied with building his new comedy series, 'Our Gang', a comedy series about and starring a group of young children. The series was notable for the naturalness of the children's acting and for being one of the first in cinema history in which coloured and white Americans were portrayed as equals. The show became a big hit with the public, particularly so after the introduction of sound which Roach began to introduce after 1927.\n\nThe Mussolini Connection\n\nIn 1938, Roach ended his distribution contract with MGM, replacing them with United Artists. The change was partly due to Roach's embarrassing joint business venture in 1937 with Vittorio Mussolini, son of fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, in which he tried to form a production company called \"R.A.M\" (Roach and Mussolini). He was universally condemned by his peers but stubbornly refused to change his stance. He even proudly displayed an autographed portrait of Mussolini in his home up until his death.\n\nAfter joining United Artists, Roach had several hits with 'Topper' in 1937, 'Of Mice and Men' in 1939 and 'One Million B.C.' in 1940\n\nWWII\n\n. Roach had been commissioned in the US Army Signal Reserve Corps in 1927 and was called back for active duty in the Signal Corps in June 1942, at age 50. The output he oversaw primarily featured military training films and his studios were leased to the American armed forces. The studios were returned to him after the war with millions of dollars of improvements.\n\nTelevision\n\n. After the war Roach resumed making movies and was one of the first producers to change to an all colour schedule. He was also one of the first to go into television. From 1948 his son, Hal Roach Jr., produced numerous popular television series including 'The Stu Irwin Show', 'The Public Defender', 'Rocky Jones, Space Ranger' and 'My Little Margie'. BY 1951 the studio's output was 1500 hours of television a year.\n\nRoach also licensed revivals of his Laurel and Hardy and Our Gang series for the small screen with highly successful results.\n\nLater Career\n\nIn 1955, Roach retired from active film production and sold his interests to his son, Hal Roach Jr.. The son lost the studio to creditors and it was shut down in 1961. Roach Sr. continued to work as a consultant on movie projects for two decades, well into his nineties.\n\nPersonal\n\nRoach was married twice. His first marriage, in 1916 was to actress Marguerite Nichols. They had two children, Hal Jr. who followed his father as a producer and director, and Margaret who worked as an actress in the 1930's and 1940's. The marriage ended with her death in 1941.\n\nIn 1942 he married a second time to Lucille Prin, a Los Angeles secretary.They had four daughters and the marriage ended with her death in 1981.\n\nHal Roach died at his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, from pneumonia, on November 2, 1992, at the age of 100 years. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira, New York.\n\nHal Roach Filmography"
