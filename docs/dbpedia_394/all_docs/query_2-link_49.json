Pre-production planning on McLaurel and McHardy resumed, and a HR news item noted that Horne and Laurel were working with Charles Rogers and Albert Austin on the script. Although many modern sources credit Laurel with working on the comedy team's screenplays, the contribution of Rogers and Austin to the completed film has not been confirmed. HR news items reported that William Janney replaced Barry Norton in the role of Alan Douglas, and that the Scottish scenes were filmed on the set built in Laurel Canyon, CA by RKO for their 1934 film The Little Minister. HR production charts include Gilbert Emery and Monte Blue in the cast, but their participation in the final film has not been confirmed. According to the Call Bureau Cast Service, the Scottish soldiers were played by members of the American Legion, and the Scottish pipers were under the care of John Sutherland. According to a 23 Jul 1935 HR news item, after the film had its preview, the studio decided to \"re-shoot about 1,000 feet of the picture, in an effort to eliminate some of the plot, which interfered with the Laurel and Hardy comedy.\"\n\nAlthough other contemporary sources list the picture's running time as 80 or 82 min., the Var review commented: \"Preview was 90 minutes on the Coast, and by best eastern daylight saving time, at theater caught, it clocks 70.\" A number of the reviews noted that Bonnie Scotland was a spoof of Paramount's 1935 picture The Lives of a Bengal Lancer, which also employed Col. W. E. Wynn as a technical advisor. Modern sources state that Wilson Collison contributed to the script and that Roy Seawright drew the cartoon bees in the ending sequence. Modern sources complete the character identifications for Claude King (General Fletcher), Carlos J. de Valdez (Hindu) and Clive Morgan (English officer), and include the following actors in the cast: Jack Hill (Hotel lobby extra/Newly drafted soldier/Native henchman); Sam Lufkin, Leo Willis Charlie Hall and Bob O'Conor (Native henchmen); Bobby Dunn (Native henchman/Man handing out flyers for the Twiddle Tweed Co.); Marvin Hatley (Soldier with accordian); Anthony Francis, Raizada Devinder and Nath Bali (Hindus); William Moore , Arthur Rowlands , Frances Morris and Mary McLaren.

In India, Lorna has been misled by the fortune-hunting Lady Ormsby into thinking Alan no longer cares for her, and so she is being courted by McGregor. After their arrival, Stan and Ollie have a trick played upon them by the veteran soldiers, while Alan overhears the announcement of Lorna's engagement to McGregor. After discovering that Alan is at the fort, Lorna meets him that night and is heartbroken when he castigates her for never writing to him. The next day, Millie, Lady Ormsby's dismissed maid, gives Lorna Alan's letters, which Lady Ormsby had intercepted. Lorna rushes off to find Alan, but he is on a dangerous mission to impersonate McGregor and his officers at a meeting with Khan Mir Jutra, a native rebel who intends to ambush the fort while the officers are absent. Stan and Ollie have also gone along under the impression that they are attending a luncheon. While Jutra entertains the impersonators, he learns that his rebels are attacking the fort, and, assuming victory, he attempts to make his captives commit suicide. He finds out, however, that the real McGregor was prepared for the attack and captured all the rebels. Stan and Ollie accidentally engineer their escape and run into bee hives in the courtyard. They throw the hives at the natives, who run away at the approach of McGregor's troops, who are in turn covered in bees themselves as Stan and Ollie run toward them.\n\nLess"
