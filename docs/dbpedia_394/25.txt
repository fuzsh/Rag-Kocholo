The Short[]

Plot: Whenever the gang needs advice or help, they always turn to Grandma. Mickey, Farina and Joe are having problems of the heart in their love matches. Pineapple, meanwhile, works at the local beauty salon, and while everyone is out, he lets his pals in the gang explore the cosmetics and devices. Mickey gives himself a mudpack, Farina gets a permanent wave and Jackie releases steam, air and water out of various tubes. The boss comes round to call a cop to chase the kids off, but Grandma shooes the kids off before that happens and then takes off herself.
