        "text": "The Acute Psychiatry Service (APS) in the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital has provided consultation to emergency patients since the 1950s. Our service is equipped to handle psychiatric emergencies around the clock and we typically see more than 6,000 patients a year.\n\nThe Mass General Emergency Department also serves as one of three designated hospital emergency departments for the Boston Emergency Services Team (BEST).\n\nOur main objective when providing consultations is to stabilize the individual and then refer him or her for appropriate follow-up treatment, either within Mass General or elsewhere.\n\nThe APS is staffed by attending psychiatrists with expertise that includes addiction treatment, child psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. Our multidisciplinary team also includes other professionals who help assess and determine the best treatment plan for each patient:\n\nPsychiatric residents\n\nPsychology interns\n\nNurse practitioners\n\nChild & adolescent psychiatry fellows\n\nClinical nurse specialists\n\nSocial workers\n\nSecurity personnel\n\nTreatment at the Acute Psychiatry Service\n\nPlease be aware that we are unable to provide treatment by phone or by appointment. All care takes place face-to-face in our dedicated area within the Emergency Department at Mass General.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to the high volume of emergency patients at Mass General, we encourage you to access other resources if you do not need emergency psychiatric care. Learn more about clinical care and check your eligibility.\n\nEmergency Services: Boston Emergency Services Team (BEST)\n\nBoston Emergency Services Team (BEST) sends mobile crisis clinicians to homes, schools, outpatient clinics and other community locations.\n\nLead Agency: Boston Medical Center\n\nPartners: Massachusetts General Hospital, Bay Cove Human Services and North Suffolk Mental Health Association\n\nBEST provides 24-hour response to adults and youth in need of crisis intervention for mental health and substance use concerns. The BEST team is made up of experienced, masterâ€™s-level clinicians, psychiatrists, family partners, certified peer specialists, advanced practice nurses, registered nurses and mental health workers.\n\nHow to Access BEST\n\nPhone: 800-981-HELP (800-981-4357)\n\nThe BEST toll-free number can be used 24 hours a day to initiate services. Call center clinicians provide information and referral options or arrange an in-person evaluation. BEST was created to serve people with no insurance or with Mass Health, however, more commercial insurances are starting to support mobile/urgent care emergency services.\n\nPlease call BEST to find out whether your insurance covers our services.\n\nBEST Services\n\nImmediate information & referrals\n\nPsychiatric evaluation\n\nPeer-to-peer support\n\nReferrals for ongoing treatment\n\nCrisis intervention and treatment (including psychopharmacology)\n\nShort-term community crisis stabilization\n\nMobile Crisis Intervention\n\nMobile Crisis Intervention (known as MCI) is the youth-serving component of BEST (serving patients under the age 21). MCI provides up to seven days of crisis intervention services that include mobile, onsite, face-to-face therapeutic response to youth and family caregivers experiencing a behavioral health crisis. MCI identifies the problems involved, assesses needs and begins to treat and stabilize the situation in order to reduce immediate risk of danger to youth or others.\n\nCommunity Crisis Stabilization Units (CCS)\n\nThe adult Community Crisis Stabilization program serves patient 18 years and older, providing short-term crisis intervention over a three-to-five-day stay. The CCS can be a successful alternative to inpatient hospitalization, providing a safe, staff-secured treatment program.\n\nUrgent Care Centers\n\nIn addition to the hospitals, BEST includes a number of associated urgent care centers. These urgent care centers offer a timely and convenient option for patients who need an office-based evaluation. These centers are located at:\n\nDr. Solomon Carter Fuller Mental Health Center, Boston Medical Center\n\nEric Lindemann Mental Health Center, Boston Health Care for the Homeless\n\nIt is strongly advised that you call the urgent care center prior to your arrival at 800-981-4357."
