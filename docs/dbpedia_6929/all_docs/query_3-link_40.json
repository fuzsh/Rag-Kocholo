        "text": "Qualifying for a Disability Retirement\n\nYour disability percentage, which will be assigned by the Physical Evaluation Board, will determine whether your disability qualifies you for retirement or separation:\n\nIf you have less than 20 years of active service a disability rating of 30 percent or higher will qualify you for retirement, and a disability rating below 30 percent will result in separation.\n\nIf you have 20 or more years of active service, retirement will be recommended regardless of your disability rating.\n\nIf your disability existed before you entered the armed forces you will be recommended for discharge without benefits.\n\nYour Branch of Service may place you on either the Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL) or the Permanent Disability Retired List (PDRL).\n\nA member of the TDRL or the PDRL is a retired member of the armed forces. You are entitled to all rights and privileges of a military retiree, which may include:\n\nParticipation in Survivor Benefit Plans\n\nVoluntary/involuntary allotments from your retired pay\n\nDisability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nIf you meet additional requirements you may also qualify for Combat-Related Special Compensation or Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay.\n\nTemporary Disability Retirement List\n\nIf you are found unfit to perform your duties because of a disability that may not be permanent, you may be placed on the Temporary Disability List (TDRL).\n\nYour retired pay will be computed using one of two methods:\n\nyour disability percentage (using a minimum of 50 percent for payment purposes while on the TDRL), referred to as Method A, or\n\nyour years of active service, referred to as Method B.\n\nYour pay will be computed based on whichever is more beneficial for you.\n\nWhile on the TDRL, a physical examination is required at least once every 18 months. If you fail to report for your physical examination, your Branch of Service will remove you from the TDRL list and your retired pay will be suspended until your examination has been completed.\n\nIf you were placed on the TDRL prior to January 1, 2017, you may remain on the TDRL for up to five years, providing your condition does not change during that time. If you were placed on the TDRL on or after January 1, 2017, you will remain on that list for up to three years providing you condition does not change during that time. If at any time you are found fit for duty, you may be removed from the TDRL and returned to active duty.\n\nIf your disability stabilizes and is rated at 30 percent or greater, you will be transferred to the Permanent Disability Retired List (PDRL). If your disability stabilizes and is rated at less than 30 percent and you do not have 20 years of service, you will be discharged from the TDRL with severance pay.\n\nPermanent Disability Retired List\n\nIf your disability is found to be permanent and is rated at 30 percent or greater, or you have 20 or more years of service, you will be placed on the Permanent Disability Retired List (PDRL).\n\nYour retired pay will be computed using one of two methods.\n\nYour disability percentage, referred to as Method A.\n\nYour years of active service, referred to as Method B.\n\nYour pay will be computed based on whichever method is more beneficial for you.\n\nIf you have been transferred from the TDRL to the PDRL, your retired pay will be recalculated using your most current disability rating.\n\nFor more information, submit your question online or call 800-321-1080 to speak to a Customer Service Representative.\n\nIf you have concerns about your VA disability rating, please contact the VA at 800-827-1000.\n\nNote: The information on this website is provided to explain typical situations regarding retiree and annuitant benefits. For details and exceptions, please see applicable laws, financial management regulations, and instructions.\n\nPage Updated June 25 2024"
