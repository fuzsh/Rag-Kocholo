        "text": "Sometimes NPCs fail to spawn, or spawn on the opposite side of the map. I've found, though, if you quick save right in front of where the person is supposed to be, then reload, they'll usually spawn on reload.\n\nI'm playing through on my ps4 ATM and have the same problem as everyone else. Played through it when the game launched on my PC and didn't have this problem. Anyone know if it's been fixed?\n\n@ladylily1 is correct. Servis sometimes fails to spawn, or spawns \"invisibly\" at his spot on (in?) the wall at the top of the stairs in the Echoback Fort.\n\nAFAIK, after over two-dozen playthroughs on PC, re-loading a save from right before or after the battle is the only way to overcome this bug. (And no, it will never get fixed by the devs. All support work on DAI ceased with Patch 11 after the last DLC was released in 2015.)\n\nBad news, there is a common bug (patched on pc not console) where he simply won't spawn. The best method is to go back to camp rest and come back if he still isn't there you have to reload from an earlier point and hope the buh doesn't happen again, Unfortunately I had the latter and had to do the dungeon crawl 4 times before he finally spawned, hope this helps!"
