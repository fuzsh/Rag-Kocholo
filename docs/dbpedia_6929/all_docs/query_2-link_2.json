        "text": "Servis doesn't necessarily share the Venatori's views and treats his role as supervisor of the Venatori's projects in the Western Approach as just another job. The various projects include hunting a high dragon, red lyrium mining, and investigating the Tevinter ruins scattered throughout the desert. He mostly leads through letters, which can be found scattered throughout.\n\nTo bolster their numbers in the area, Servis hires raiders called the White Claws. He promises them high pay and outlines their general duties, as well as areas off limits. He orders them to focus on investigating the Abyssal High Dragon by stealing the research notes of Frederic of Serault's team. He also assigns them to the Red Templars conducting red lyrium mining operations, and the Venatori's excavations. He bars them from interfering with the Grey Wardens present in the wastes.\n\nHowever, the White Claws don't prove to be a worthy investment as, to the dislike of the area's high-ranking Venatori, they kill Frederic's team despite being warned not to, and in order to lure the high dragon, spring traps all over the desert, proving their lack of knowledge on dragon hunting.\n\nAfter the Red Templars conclude their mining operations, he focuses on investigations of the Still Ruins and Coracavus.\n\nHe was hired by a third party to smuggle ancient magical artifacts out of the Western Approach, right underneath the Venatori's noses, and against the will of Corypheus, proving he will do anything for money.\n\nAs the Inquisition pushes further into the Western Approach, Servis assigns Prelate Macrinus as leader of Griffon Wing Keep and orders his men to continue investigating the ancient prison of Coracavus, while relocating himself to the Echoback Fort. Feeling the tightening grasp of the Inquisition's hand on his throat, he intends to abandon the Venatori and writes a résumé addressed to the Praetor of Vyrantium, Magister Nanterius, who is looking for someone to lead mining operations."
