        "text": "Windsor fire station is located in Tinkers Lane, Windsor. It is a new building and firefighters began using it in November 2014. It replaces the former site in St Mark’s Road.\n\nThe station is the result of a jointly-funded collaboration between the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead and Royal Berkshire Fire Authority. The site and building are owned by the Royal Borough whilst the staffing, equipment and operational management are provided by Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service.\n\nThe two-storey station sits at the front of the council’s operations and streetcare depot, adjacent to the Fairacres Industrial Estate."
