        "text": "The Trouble with Darkspawn is triggered after capturing Griffon Wing Keep and speaking to the Knight-Captain there. After accepting the quest, you'll find a large search area adjacent to the keep. Head to the very center, go north. You'll find some green smoke and won't be allowed to cross forward. Plant your banner at the dock, and you'll gain a new mission at the war map.\n\nThe mission in question is called “Find the Source of Darkspawn,” and it's located right near the Western Approach on the Orlais side of the war map. (It's almost against the western edge of the whole map.) It's an instant-complete mission that will cost you 5 units of power. You'll have to follow up with another instant-complete mission called “Crossing the Sulphur Pits,” which will cost an additional 5 units of power. This opens up a sub-area in the Western Approach called the Tevinter Ruin.\n\nThe entrance to the Tevinter Ruin is located northeast of the Griffon Wing Keep. You need to head north across the wooden bridge across the sulfur pits. Keep going north, and you'll head up some dirt ramps, ladders, and fight through some enemies. You'll curve back east, then south up some more steps into some collapsed building. The entrance to the ruins, specifically called Coracavus, is in the center. Interact with it to enter.\n\nThe ruins are linear, and you'll see a large hole in the wall after a few fights. Use a mage to energize the broken gate and seal the hole, then turn left and continue through the ruins. The path remains linear.\n\nYou'll come to a locked door, but a dead body next to it contains the key. You'll gain some information with the key as well. Through the door and down the hall, you'll encounter a giant. As usual when you attack them, aim for the legs first to bring him down to minimize his offense.\n\nContinue beyond him and you'll find a door that leads back out to the Western Approach and the Echo Back Canyon Camp. The fight with the giant probably have you some damage, so this is a good time to heal and resupply. Continue southeast in the direction of the mission mark and you'll find another bit of outdoor ruins. A man named Servis operates in the ruins with some friends.\n\nThey all need to be defeated, but Servis himself won't quite die once he's taken down. Clear the area, then interact with Servis, who will lay wounded on his back. He may not be lying right at the quest marker, but he'll be easy to find since he won't move after he's taken down. Interact with him, and you'll get to choose whether to kill them or let him live. The quest will resolve once you make your decision. If you let him live, you can sit in judgment of Servis later in Skyhold."
