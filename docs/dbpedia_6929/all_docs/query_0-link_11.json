A professionally trained live in carer will live with you in your own home available to provide round the clock one to one care and support whenever you need it. Live in care is a fantastic and safe alternative to residential care with no disruption to your routine allowing you to stay close to friends and pets whilst being supported in a familiar environment.\n\nYou can have a live in carer for as long as you like, whether it’s two weeks, a month or even just a respite break to cover whilst the family carer is on holiday.\n\nMany primary carers take pride in looking after a loved one but without support providing care on a full time basis can be over whelming and lonely. Having respite care allows the primary carer to take a break, to ‘recharge their batteries’ whilst the person they care for is looked after by someone else."
