        "text": "About this church\n\nSt George's Chapel is one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture in England and is particularly noted for its magnificent stone fan vaulting. It is the spiritual home of the Order of the Garter, the senior order of British Chivalry established in 1348 by Edward III. Within the chapel are the tombs of ten sovereigns, including Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, and Charles I.\n\nEvensong is sung daily (apart from Wednesdays when the service is said) at 5.15pm during term-time.\n\nAbout the choir\n\nThe choir comprises up to 23 boy choristers and twelve Lay Clerks singing alto, tenor and bass. The boys are educated at St George's School in the Castle grounds, and the Lay Clerks live in the Horseshoe Cloister, just to the west of the Chapel, and on Denton's Commons. Services are sung during term time.\n\nPhotographs Â© The Dean and Canons of Windsor"
