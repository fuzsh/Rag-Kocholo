        "text": "Unincorporated Areas\n\nMore than 65 percent of the County — 2,653.5 square miles — is unincorporated. For the 1 million people living in those areas, the Board of Supervisors is their “city council” and the supervisor representing the area the “mayor.” County departments provide the municipal services. There are approximately 120-125 unincorporated areas (depending on how you define them), with the largest number located in the northern part of the County. The listings below are intended to help those living and working in the unincorporated areas locate the municipal services available to them and their elected representatives. An alphabetical listing is provided of unincorporated areas and the districts in which they are located."
