        "text": "Documentation\n\nPost-visit documentation must be as thorough as possible to ensure prompt reimbursement.\n\nWhile there are many similarities between documenting in-person visits and telehealth visits, there are some key factors to keep in mind.\n\nPatient consent\n\nMake a note of whether the patient gave you verbal or written consent to conduct a virtual appointment.\n\nCode categories\n\nTelephone codes are required for audio-only appointments, while office codes are for audio and video visits.\n\nTime of visit\n\nA common mistake made by health care providers is billing time a patient spent with clinical staff. Providers should only bill for the time that they spent with the patient.\n\nStore-and-forward\n\nMany states require telehealth services to be delivered in “real-time”, which means that store-and-forward activities are unlikely to be reimbursed. You can find information about store-and-forward rules in your state here .\n\nOriginating sites and distant sites"
