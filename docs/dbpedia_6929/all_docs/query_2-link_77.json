Technicians are responsible for conducting security sweeps of the grounds, responding to and neutralizing threats from organized groups or individuals.

This coverage includes security sweeps, bomb threats and suspicious packages, as well as vehicle and other material examinations. The canine team provides this coverage twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, throughout the White House complex, around Foreign Missions, and at the Vice President's Residence. Our canine team also travels in support of Secret Service protective details worldwide and supports our law enforcement partners on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Airspace Security Branch (ASB) develops and implements security plans to monitor and control the airspace surrounding locations visited by the president and vice president of the United States, National Special Security Events and other designated major events. ASB members work with a variety of technologies and government agencies to monitor air traffic and coordinate defensive responses in the event of an intrusion.\n\nOur Hazardous Agent Mitigation Medical Emergency Response Team (HAMMER) supports the agencyâ€™s protective mission through chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) detection and intervention, emergency medical support and rescue/extrication capabilities. HAMMER members receive extensive training in emergency medicine and CBRN hazards. To accomplish their mission, HAMMER personnel utilize the latest technology to monitor for potential threats."
