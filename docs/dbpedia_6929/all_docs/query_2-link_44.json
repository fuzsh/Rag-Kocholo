Please read the Regional Data Hosting Policy here to read about the exceptions to this commitment.\n\nTo balance demand, improve performance, and provide the best service, we may move account data between regions without notice. If an account has purchased the Data Location Add-On, we will ensure that regional moves stay within the required country or legal boundaries.\n\nObtaining the physical address where your Service Data is hosted\n\nUpon request, we can communicate the Amazon Web Services (AWS) region (a general area which may be described by AWS as a country, geographic region within a country, a state, and/or a city) where we host your Service Data.\n\nWe are unable to give exact physical addresses where your Service Data is hosted due to the way AWS operates at a technical level. This is based on the architecture of AWS itself. AWS has \"regions\" around the globe. Within these regions exists the concept of “availability zones” or \"AZ's\". When creating an asset in AWS, it is located in one or more AZ's in a particular region. Regardless of the asset owner's choice to replicate data within a region or across regions, AWS itself may replicate data within the region to other AZ's. The result is that Zendesk Subscriber Service Data exists within numerous facilities within a given region. Additionally, for security purposes, AWS does not officially sanction the communication of the specific location of their data center buildings or associated facilities.\n\nIf you need to know which AWS region your Zendesk subdomain is hosted in, contact Zendesk Customer Support.\n\nCHANGE LOG:\n\nApril 2024 - Addition of caveat for Zendesk WFM (Tymeshift) and Zendesk QA (Klaus)\n\nJuly 2024 - Addition of caveat for Ultimate\n\nJuly 2024 - Addition of two new hosting locations: UK (London), Asia-Pacific (Osaka)"
