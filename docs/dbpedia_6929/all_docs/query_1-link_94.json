        "text": "Inflation-linked broadband, mobile and TV price hikes to be banned from next year\n\nBroadband, mobile and pay TV firms will no longer be able to hit customers with inflation-linked price hikes mid-contract from January 2025, regulator Ofcom has confirmed. But, as MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) founder Martin Lewis has warned, the new rules will still allow for above-inflation price rises.\n\nMartin Lewis: Confused by the difference between the 'two-child benefit cap' and limits on Child Benefit? An explainer\n\nConfused about the 'two-child benefit cap' and what it really means? MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis has a quick and simple video briefing to clear up some of the misinformation. It takes you through Child Benefit rules, the two-child limit for Universal Credit and the benefits cap.\n\nBuy now, pay later regulation confirmed by new Government – but timeline remains unclear\n\nRegulation of the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector WILL go ahead, the new Government has confirmed. It means consumers will finally get much-needed safeguards on BNPL purchases, as well as protection from unsustainable borrowing – something MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) and its founder Martin Lewis have long campaigned for. Though we still don't know when any new rules will take force.\n\nMartin Lewis: The Chancellor is restricting Winter Fuel Payment to just those on benefits – that’s too narrow a group\n\nWinter Fuel Payments – a tax-free payment made to all pensioners to help with winter energy bills – are to be restricted to those on benefits and Pension Credit, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced. But MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis has urged the Government to include a wider group, and to leave no stone unturned ensuring the 800,000 eligible who miss out on Pension Credit get it.\n\nCarer's Allowance overhaul urgently needed to prevent 1,000s being chased for overpayments, says charity\n\nDemands to repay Carer's Allowance overpayments are having a \"shocking\" impact on unpaid carers' lives, according to a new report from Carers UK. The charity has called for urgent action to prevent carers from unwittingly building up huge debts – an issue MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) founder Martin Lewis has also raised with the Government.\n\nMartin Lewis: Can online retailers refuse returns? Your rights explained\n\nCan online retailers refuse returns, particularly if they decide you've made too many in the past? MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis answers this question, and talks you through your rights, in a recent episode of the BBC's The Martin Lewis Podcast.\n\nRoyal Mail launches 'fake stamp scanner' – here's how it works\n\nRoyal Mail has introduced a 'fake stamp scanner' that enables you to check whether a stamp is legitimate or not. It will also continue to waive its £5 penalty fee charged to anyone who receives a letter with a fake stamp on it for the time being.\n\nWarning: Lloyds, Halifax or Bank of Scotland customer? Your overdraft fees may be rising from TODAY – full help and who's affected\n\nIf you're a Lloyds, Halifax or Bank of Scotland customer, the interest rate you're charged for using your overdraft could be going up from today (Friday 2 August). The Lloyds Banking Group, which owns all three brands, says most customers will be charged the same or less after its shake-up – but others will pay more, and some Club Lloyds customers will see their rate nearly double, from 27.5% to 49.9%.\n\nMortgage rates drop below 4% for the first time since April – but will they get any cheaper?\n\nFixed-rate mortgage deals have dropped below 4% for the first time since April – though only for those with at least a 40% deposit or equity in their home. However, mortgage brokers say rates could continue to fall as the year goes on – so what, if anything, should you do about it?"
