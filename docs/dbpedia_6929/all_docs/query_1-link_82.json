        "text": "by Pat McKenna and Mark Bardack\n\nThe New York Racing Association, Inc. will welcome the return of Berkshire Bank Family Mondays for the 2017 summer meet at Saratoga Race Course. The first edition of the series will be held on Monday, July 24.\n\nThe weekly family festival, held each Monday of the meet from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the Berkshire Bank Saratoga Pavilion, invites families and children to experience and enjoy a wide array of free games, attractions and educational activities, including the opportunity to pet a retired thoroughbred, all against the backdrop of historic Saratoga Race Course.\n\nBerkshire Bank Family Mondays will be held near the newly revitalized playground, which will offer families a smoke- and alcohol-free interactive area. New features of the playground include an oval multi-lane running track surrounding the playscape, a miniature replica starting gate, a “selfie” photo station, spring horses, and educational panels designed to teach children about the life of a race horse.\n\n\"Saratoga Race Course is a true family destination, and our Berkshire Bank Family Mondays series provides a great way for the next generation of racing fans to experience an afternoon at the Spa. We look forward to continuing this tradition in partnership with Berkshire Bank as we help our youngest fan base discover the excitement of thoroughbred racing and the history of Saratoga Race Course,” said New York Racing Association Senior Vice President and Chief Experience Officer Lynn LaRocca.\n\nThe Berkshire Bank Family Monday series will also provide local schools and PTAs with an opportunity to fundraise for their operations by hosting a designated activity which carries a suggested donation. Funds raised throughout the afternoon will be supplemented with additional grants from the New York Racing Association and Berkshire Bank.\n\nSchools and PTAs to be hosted throughout the 2017 season include Brown School on July 24; Stevens Elementary School on July 31; Skano Elementary School on August 7; Chango Elementary School on August 21; Scotia-Glenville Education Foundation on August 28; and Lisha Kill Middle School on September 4.\n\nFamilies in attendance on Berkshire Bank Family Mondays can enjoy the comfort and convenience of a reserved picnic table in the backyard of Saratoga Race Course.\n\nReserved tables in the backyard are available for $60 (including admission). The tables seat six guests and are located adjacent to the Paddock where fans can watch the horses being saddled before each race.\n\nFamilies can also take advantage of a new offering for the 2017 season. The “Family Fun Four Pack” includes four Grandstand reserved seats (including admission), four hot dogs, and four 12 oz. beverages for $44. The offer is subject to availability. To purchase, contact the NYRA Box Office by phone at (844) NYRA-TIX or via email at [email protected].\n\nThe summer racing season will begin on Friday, July 21 and continue through Labor Day, Monday, September 4.\n\nFor more information about Saratoga Race Course, visit www.NYRA.com/Saratoga."
