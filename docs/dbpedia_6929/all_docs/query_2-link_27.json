        "text": "Mission Statement\n\nThe mission of the U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) is to support and protect U.S. Coast Guard personnel, operations, integrity and assets worldwide. We prevent and defeat criminal threats through objective and independent investigations.\n\nAuthority\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) is a federal law enforcement agency whose law enforcement authority is derived from Title 14 of the United States Code. This authority provides for Coast Guard special agents to conduct investigations of actual, alleged or suspected criminal activity; carry firearms; execute and serve warrants; and make arrests.\n\nCommitment\n\nToday CGIS is comprised of a mix of active duty military special agents (enlisted, warrant officer and officer), civilian special agents (1811 series), and special agents who are members of the Coast Guard Reserve. These agents along with support personnel are spread out across the United States in eight regional offices and 35 Resident Agent offices along with CGIS-HQ located in Washington, DC."
