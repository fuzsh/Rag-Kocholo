        "text": "Purchase Service Frequently Asked Questions\n\nTab/Accordion Items\n\nState law specifies how the cost of each type of creditable service that may be purchased is calculated.\n\nIndividual forms for each type of eligible retirement service purchase are located on our website. Each purchase form includes a description of the cost calculation method used for that individual type of purchase.\n\nCarefully study the impact this purchase may have on your retirement benefit. Running an estimate through ORBIT will assist you in making this decision. After the Retirement System receives your properly completed service purchase form, the Retirement System will officially calculate your purchase cost and mail you an official purchase cost statement letter. If you choose to make the purchase, you may use pre-tax money from an eligible retirement plan or IRA to make the purchase (see and prepare Form 398 available in ORBIT).\n\nIn that case, your plan administrator will give you a check to forward to the Retirement Systems Division. Otherwise, you will provide a check to the Retirement Systems Division. All checks for one purchase must be received together. Under certain and limited circumstances, your beneficiary(ies) may complete the purchase process if your death occurs while you are waiting for or evaluating a cost statement.\n\nAll cost statements have an expiration date. If you do not make the purchase by that date, the cost of the purchase will have to be recalculated based on the cost method specified by law for the purchase.\n\nIf you make a purchase, you are guaranteed that the cost of the purchase (less the $25 administrative fee for making the purchase) will be refunded to you if you decide to withdraw all of your service and contributions from the Retirement System at a later date.\n\nIf you die before retiring, or you die in retirement but before receiving benefits equaling the contributions and purchases you made, your beneficiary(ies) will be entitled to the undistributed contributions and purchases. (No contributions or purchase amounts provided by your employer will be refunded to you.)\n\nNorth Carolina retirement law recognizes that you, a participant in one of North Carolina's Retirement Systems, may not have had the opportunity to make contributions and receive credit for certain periods in your public service career. The following list generally describes other circumstances for which a purchase may be allowed. This is not the complete list of all purchase types available in all systems. Check with your employer to see if you qualify.\n\nYour employer was not eligible to participate in a Retirement System, but you have public service (federal, federally-funded, military, or out-of-state service) that you may be eligible to purchase.\n\nYour employer did not participate in a System, although it was eligible.\n\nYour employer did participate in a Retirement System, but your position was not eligible for participation at the time.\n\nYou are or were participating in the Retirement System with your employer, but a life or career event caused your service to be interrupted over a period during which you did not work and make contributions.\n\nYou withdrew your service credit and contributions from the Retirement System, but you wish to restore that credit following a return to contributing service for five years.\n\nVisit ORBIT to run a Service Purchase estimate, download the appropriate form, or contact us at the address or telephone number below for further guidance.\n\nContact the Retirement Systems Division at (919) 814-4590."
