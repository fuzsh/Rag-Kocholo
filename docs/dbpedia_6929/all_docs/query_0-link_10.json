        "text": "Visiting St George’s Chapel\n\nSt George’s Chapel is open to visitors from 10am to 4pm via the Windsor Castle admission centre on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Access to the Chapel may be limited after 2.30pm due to the current high number of visitors. Spending time soaking in the atmosphere of this wonderful building can be a very rewarding experience. Why not attend our Chapel services often accompanied by marvellous music. Services are free and no ticket is required. Please be at King Henry VIII gate (the visitor exit from the Castle) no later than 15 minutes before the Service is due to start. For more information please see the diary page here and for a list of the music at services in the next few days here"
