        "text": "The Grand Seiko Standard is a Seiko-exclusive accuracy standard for mechanical watches which has been established to ensure superior performance of Grand Seiko mechanical watches irrespective of the differences in environmental conditions in which a watch is used. \"Grand Seiko Standard Inspection,\" which measures gain / loss (daily rate) under various environments, is carried out at the manufacturing plant for 17 days in total, and only mechanical watches that satisfy the standard are given the title of \"Grand Seiko.\"\n\nThe Grand Seiko Standard differs from the other recognised chronometer standards in two important respects. While most accuracy standard testing is done for five positions at two temperatures, the Grand Seiko Standard tests six positions at three temperatures. This is because the Grand Seiko Standard seeks to replicate real world conditions. The sixth position, namely the 12 o’clock upright position, is the way many people place their watch when not wearing it. In addition, the extra temperature rating is closer to body temperature. The idea is simple - to test the watch under conditions similar to actual use.\n\nThe accuracy of Grand Seiko differs according to the mechanism and caliber of your watch. For details on your watch, please refer to the instruction that came with your watch at the time of purchase.\n\nGuidelines for the accuracy of Grand Seiko while in use:\n\nQUARTZ : The annual accuracy is ±10 seconds when worn on the wrist within a normal temperature range (between 5 ºC and 35 ºC) for approximately 8 hours per day.\n\nSPRING DRIVE : Average monthly loss / gain is ±15 seconds when worn on the wrist within a normal temperature range (between 5 ºC and 35 ºC）.\n\nMECHANICAL : Accuracy of Grand Seiko mechanical watches when worn is specified within the target range of -1 to +10 seconds per day. To properly judge the accuracy under normal use conditions, check the mean value of gain / loss over a period of seven to ten days.\n\nThe accuracy of mechanical watches varies slightly from day to day, depending on various conditions. Therefore, the loss / gain of mechanical watches is not measured by a daily rate, but by an average daily rate over a period of 7 to 10 days. For this reason, the accuracy of mechanical watches is indicated by \"the mean daily rate.\"\n\nThe accuracy of the mechanical watch in use\n\nThe accuracy of a mechanical watch varies slightly depending on individual user conditions such as winding state of the mainspring due to movement of the users’ arm, ambient temperature, and posture (direction of the watch). Accordingly, actual accuracy of a watch in use may differ from specifications in the \"Grand Seiko Standard.\"\n\nThe target accuracy range of Grand Seiko mechanical watches in use is -1 to +10 seconds per day. To determine accuracy in use, measure loss / gain under normal use conditions for\n\napproximately 7 to 10 days and calculate the average loss / gain per day.\n\nThe accuracy of the mechanical watch movement at rest\n\nTo establish a benchmark accuracy of a mechanical watch which does not depend on usage environment, loss / gain of a mechanical watch is measured before the movement is assembled in the case. The accuracy of the movement is measured under controlled conditions over a certain number of days, and the result is called \"the accuracy of a mechanical watch movement at rest.\"\n\nThe measurement result for each watch is written in the \"Grand Seiko Standard Inspection Certificate,\" which is provided with the watch by the retailer at time of purchase. This result is an average loss / gain of time over a 17 day period, which was measured in the factory where the temperature and position of the movement are controlled in accordance with the \"Grand Seiko Standard.\"\n\nThe accuracy written on the Grand Seiko Standard Inspection Certificate is the accuracy of the Grand Seiko mechanical watch movement at rest, which is measured before the inside movement of the watch is assembled in the case. Since the accuracy of a mechanical watch varies slightly depending on individual user conditions, the actual accuracy during use may differ from the numerical value specified in the certificate. The accuracy is affected by conditions such as winding state of the mainspring due to movement of the users’ arm, ambient temperature, and posture (direction of the watch).\n\nThe target accuracy range of Grand Seiko mechanical watches in use is -1 to +10 seconds per day. To determine accuracy in use, measure loss / gain under normal use conditions for approximately 7 to 10 days and calculate the average loss / gain per day.\n\nAs time goes by, it is possible that you may scratch your watch slightly. We hope this never happens, but if it does, we have a special polishing service available.\n\nYou might like to have your watch polished when it is with us for a normal service. Please consult your Grand Seiko retailer for details.\n\nThis Grand Seiko polishing service is performed by our very best craftsmen and women. Please take note of the following points:\n\nPolishing of certain parts may not be possible due to their special construction or material.\n\nIf the damage is severe, it may not be possible to remove it by polishing alone.\n\nThe finish may be very slightly different from the original, as the polishing is done by hand.\n\nThe crown, pushers, case back and the emblem on the band cannot be polished."
