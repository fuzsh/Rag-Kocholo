        "text": "Hi everyone. I bought a Servis M6011 washing machine and used it twice an now it has stopped working.\n\nIt exhibited the following symptoms:\n\nStart --> Fill --> Stop\n\nPower On --> Spin --> power lights flicker --> Stop\n\nPower On --> Spin --> power lights flicker --> Stop\n\nand full program.\n\nSecond wash was the same process.\n\nNow the spin cycle won't begin.\n\nI've checked: motor brushes, door lock, pump filter. Everything works fine (fill, drain, cycle timer etc) except the spin. The motor looks good and most of the parts look quite new. Would this likely to be the power module?\n\nThanks,\n\nAndrew\n\nHi, I bought it second hand. I'm not so worried about the parts, since QER repair PCB's quite cheaply (found on ebay) and I've seen other reasonably priced parts around the internet.\n\nI'd like to follow the PCB route if I can get enough information. Judging by the powering off and power light flickering when starting the spin before it stopped working, I'm trying to work out the specifics of this symptom. It's power related, but would it be the power module, motor or something else? Is there a large capacitor that needs replacing, a speed control module? or something else that typically goes in these machines?\n\nThanks,\n\nAndrew\n\nThanks, I'll have a look around.\n\nI'm not quite a beginner with electronics but I've always stayed away from capacitors. Other than the main board, are there any others I should watch out for?\n\nI have two leads with discolouration near the device for the power module.\n\nLooks like a little burning around there.\n\nWould it contain any caps in this part?\n\nThanks,\n\nAndrew\n\nHi, I've located the problem. The motherboard has a bit of burning on the back. Looks fixable. I want to get the board off to one of the companies that repair the boards.\n\nAll of the cables have come out except the data cable connecting to the front panel. Does anyone know how to remove these cables? Are the plug/or soldered on?\n\nThanks,\n\nAndrew\n\nAs you have partially removed the board, you tell us if it's soldered or socketed! If its a socket, they usually have a clip to hold it in place, or look at the other end of the lead, to see if that's removable.\n\nSounds like a faulty thyristor, or voltage regulator, they can dry out capacitors near to them, so see if there is any ballooning on nearby caps, to prevent you being shocked by one.\n\nThe high value caps 400-600v, if there was a primary psu fault, and they couldn't be trusted not to hold a charge, we used to short them out with an insulated screwdriver, got some mighty cracks, as they discharged, better a screwdriver than me! There is a tool available that plugs into the mains, and you touch the caps legs, and it discharges, the device used to vibrate when it discharged them."
