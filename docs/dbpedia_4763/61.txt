The library and information science field has come to rely on IFLA Standards as an international measure of excellence.

Each IFLA standard reflects consensus on up-to-date principles, guidelines and best practice for a particular library or information-related activity or service. Standards are developed by IFLA’s Professional Units, Special Programmes and Review Groups, often in collaboration with other international organisations.

A thorough peer-review process ensures the quality and relevance of IFLA-endorsed standards, as part of IFLA’s wider mission of guiding the implementation of high-quality services and practices throughout the global library field.

See our list of Guidelines, technical standards, toolkits, statements and manifestos for more information.
