ISBN/ISSN

International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)

An ISBN is a 13-digit code which identifies one title or edition of a title from one specific publisher and is unique to that title or edition.

ISBNs for British and Irish publishers are issued (for a charge) by the UK International Standard Book Numbering Agency.

An ISBN for a print publication produced by any department within Trinity College Dublin may be obtained (for free) from the Library by contacting libraryaccessions@tcd.ie .

International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs)

An ISSN is an 8-digit code which identifies a journal or other serial publication, i.e., a publication issued in successive parts, having a common title, and intended to be continued indefinitely.

ISSNs in Ireland are issued by the Irish ISSN Centre in the National Library of Ireland.
