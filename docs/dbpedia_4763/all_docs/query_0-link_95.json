The purpose of this list is to identify the vocabulary used in records. For code assignment, general structure, usage, and maintenance guidelines see Introduction.\n\nNote: These sources are general subject heading and thesauri, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, along with a number of focused subject term lists like Medical Subject Headings or Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. Additional specialized lists are provided with source codes in\n\nGenre/Form Code and Term Source Codes\n\nOccupation Term Source Codes\n\nFunction Term Source Codes\n\nTemporal Term Source Codes\n\nSince general thesauri often contain a broad spectrum of terms, including genre, forms, occupations, functions, and time periods, the source codes in this list may be used in the metadata elements identified for each of the specialized source lists. Likewise, the special thesauri listed there may also be used in the metadata elements identified below under usage.\n\nSome subject heading lists incorporate names and titles and others employ independent name and title lists for parts of a subject heading. Thus the lists assigned source codes in Name and Title Authority Source Codes may also be used in the metadata elements identified below under usage.\n\nClassification schemes and subject category codes include caption terms and, frequently, index terms that identify the classes in the scheme and the category codes. Some systems use those caption and index terms as subject terms in bibliographic records. Thus the lists assigned source codes in Classification Scheme Source Codes and Subject Category Code Source Codes may also be used in the metadata elements identified below under usage, when the terms from those classification schemes and subject category codes are used as subject terms.\n\nArrangement of the list\n\nEntries in the list are arranged in alphabetical order by the code and consist of the source code followed by the bibliographic citation for the source documentation. The citations are linked to the online source for some codes.\n\nCode structure\n\nEach code consists of a maximum of 12 lowercase alphabetic characters. Possible additions to codes are described in Source Code Maintenance.\n\nSubject Heading and Term Source Codes\n\nUsage in MARC 21\n\nBibliographic records\n\n033 $2 (Date/Time and Place of an Event / Source of place term)\n\n257 $2 (Country of Producing Entity / Source)\n\n380 $2 (Form of Work / Source of term)\n\n381 $2 (Other Distinguishing Characteristics of Work or Expression / Source of term)\n\n518 $2 (Date/Time and Place of Event Note / Source of term)\n\n600-651 $2 (Subject Added Entry - Name, Corporate, Meeting, Uniform Title, Chronological, Topical, Geographic / Source of heading or term)\n\n654 $2 (Subject Added Entry - Faceted Topical Term / Source of heading or term)\n\n662 $2 (Subject Added Entry - Hierarchical Place Name / Source of heading or term)\n\n751 $2 (Added Entry - Geographical Name / Source of heading or term)\n\n752 $2 (Added Entry - Hierarchical Place Name / Source of heading or term)\n\nAuthority records\n\n040 $f (Cataloging Source / Subject heading or thesaurus conventions\n\n700-788 $2 (Heading Linking Entries / Source of heading or term)\n\n370 $2 (Associated Place / Source of term)\n\n372 $2 (Field of Activity / Source of term)\n\n373 $2 (Affiliation / Source of term)\n\n376 $2 (Family Information / Source of term)\n\n380 $2 (Form of Work / Source of term)\n\n381 $2 (Other Distinguishing Characteristics of Work or Expression / Source of term)\n\nClassification records\n\n700-711, 730-751, 754 $2 (Index Term - Name, Corporate, Meeting, Uniform Title, Chronological, Topical, Geographic, Faceted Topical / Source of heading or term)\n\nCommunity Information records\n\n600-651 $2 (Subject Added Entry - Name, Corporate, Meeting, Uniform Title, Chronological, Topical, Geographic / Source of heading or term)\n\n654 $2 (Subject Added Entry - Faceted Topical Term / Source of heading or term)\n\nMODS/MADS Elements\n\nmods: subject @authority\n\nmads: authority / topic @authority\n\nmads: authority / temporal @authority\n\nmads: authority / geographic @authority\n\nmads: authority / hierarchicalGeographic @authority\n\nmads: related / topic @authority\n\nmads: related / temporal @authority\n\nmads: related / geographic @authority\n\nmads: related / hierarchicalGeographic @authority\n\nmads: variant / topic @authority\n\nmads: variant / temporal @authority\n\nmads: variant / geographic @authority\n\nmads: variant / hierarchicalGeographic @authority\n\nSee also:"
