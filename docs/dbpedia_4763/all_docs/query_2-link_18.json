        "text": "@ noksagt\n\nThus, ISSN may apply to a report. DOI may apply to a book (or to report). These cases are not typical, therefore not included (yet, at least) - but they make sense.\n\nTo your objections.\n\ncould confuse users who inadvertently added fields\n\nYou can't protect any user from inadvertently adding whatever rubbish. And it's really easy in Zotero to inadvertently add some improper reference to a wrong library. On the other side, even if there would appear some \"wrong\" field in a reference, and the user didn't know what it's good for - he/she would just left it empty. You could also add a warning dialogue before adding a field.\n\ncould confuse other users who obtained the reference from a zotero group or export\n\nWould DOI on a book or ISSN on a report really confuse other users? Normally, if somebody would add a non-standard field, then in a case making sense to him - and probably, to others as well.\n\ndata export would either have to omit these or would mindlessly dump them, confusing other programs\n\nWell, it's a legitimate argument. Probably, leaving these non-standard data out on export is the easiest solution.\n\nsome fields just don't make sense & will never be used in citations for some types\n\nSure. So no problems - they will be probably never used. But others could be used in less-then-typical situation.\n\nAnd therefore my suggestion - do not try to foresee every possible situation, but include a default set of fields for every citation type - and let the user add more in few special cases, if necessary.\n\nA patent number assigned to an interview would, I think, confuse most other users. Perhaps it would make sense (in some convoluted way) to a person who added it (well, it was an interview about this patent....)\n\nIf you can structure an argument for why we'd ever want a patent number on the interview type, you'd probably have the most compelling argument for allowing any field to be assigned to any type. But \"let it be his responsibility\" is less compelling than the arguments for a simple interface.\n\nProbably, leaving these non-standard data out on export is the easiest solution.\n\nBut then some users would, doubtlessly, complain. Why let people input what will NEVER be output?\n\nAllowing all fields on all types is not even good at solving a majority of the kinds of edge cases that you hope to fix. It seems more common to have some other tidbit of information that is not recorded for ANY type that people want to keep track of that is useful for a source. This is why other programs often have more-than-one \"extra\" or user-defined field (not that this is an ideal solution either)."
