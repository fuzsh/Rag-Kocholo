The next comprehensive review visit is scheduled for Fall 2026. It is the only Minnesota-based library and information science program. See the ALA website for Directory Information: http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/directory.\n\nContact information for the American Library Association (ALA): 225 N Michigan Ave, Suite 1300; phone: (800) 545-2433.\n\nIncomplete Grades\n\nNo more than six credits of incomplete grades may be accumulated at one time. If incomplete grades exceed this level, students will be restricted from further registration until incomplete course work is completed.\n\nYears to Complete the Program\n\nThe degree program must be completed within five years.\n\nTransfer of Credit\n\nNon-matriculated students may transfer a maximum of nine semester graduate credits or 20.25 quarter graduate credits from an accredited MLIS program. The program director will decide whether to accept transfer credit upon admission based on a review of the applicant's transcript(s). Only courses with a letter grade of B or better will be accepted, assuming the course(s) meets the program's criteria for relevancy and accreditation standards. The student must provide a course description and a syllabus comparable to a course in the university catalog.\n\nNon-matriculated students seeking the Library Media Specialist initial licensure without a current Tier 3 or 4 teaching license and who need to complete the additional foundational teaching courses listed under their requirements can transfer in credits for these courses outside of the MLIS credit limit. These courses will be determined by either the course transfer system or by evaluating each course for meeting the licensure objectives.\n\nCurrent students may transfer a maximum of six semester graduate credits or 13.5 quarter graduate credits from another regionally accredited institution or another program at St. Catherine University to apply to the 36 credits of the MLIS degree. The course must be relevant to the student’s chosen career path and may not be identical to a course offered in the MLIS Program of St Catherine University. Students must receive approval from their academic advisor and the MLIS Program Director prior to taking the course they wish to transfer in. Sufficient evidence for the advisor to make a decision will be provided by the student requesting a transfer.\n\nConditions for Probation and Dismissal\n\nStudents are expected to make appropriate academic progress leading to the successful completion of their degrees. Students are expected to maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 (B) throughout the program. MLIS students must have a final GPA of 3.0 in order for the degree to be awarded. Students who do not maintain a B average or who earn more than one grade of C or lower may be asked to withdraw from the program.\n\nIf the GPA falls below 3.0 upon taking nine semester credits, students are placed on probation. If placed on probation, they must achieve a 3.0 cumulative GPA by the end of the term when the total credits taken equal or exceed 18.\n\nStudents not achieving the minimum GPA after taking 18 credits will be dismissed from the program. St. Catherine University’s MLIS program reserves the right to deny registration to any student who, in the opinion of the Program, is not progressing satisfactorily toward a degree.\n\nStudents must receive a grade of B- or greater in the following MLIS core courses or must retake the course.\n\nCourse List Code Title Credits LIS 7010Introduction to Library and Information Science3 LIS 7030Organization of Knowledge3 LIS 7040Information Access Services3 LIS 7050Research Methods for Library Information Science3 3 Management of Libraries and Information Centers (Required for MLIS) School Libraries (Required for SLMS) 3 Total Credits18\n\nOpportunities for Work Experience and Independent Study\n\nPracticum\n\nPracticum is a supervised, student work experience of 120 hours (generally 10 hours x 12 weeks) in an approved library or information center under the direction of a MLIS faculty member. Students meet with the faculty member in a seminar setting. Certain key assignments must be completed.\n\nStudents enrolling in the Practicum should have completed the core courses and have approval from the instructor or MLIS Program Director. Students are encouraged to register for a practicum after completing 24 credits or higher. Academic credit is received for this course.\n\nIndependent Study\n\nStudents wishing to research a topic that is related to library and information science that is not covered in the MLIS curriculum may register for independent study (LIS 6953 Independent Study), working closely with a faculty member whose expertise and interests lie within the proposed research area.\n\nIndependent studies are designed for students who have completed eight courses of their program and have a grade point average of 3.3 or better or with the permission of the MLIS Program Director. The form for submission of an independent study proposal is available online on the Registrar's Forms page. No student may complete more than two independent studies.\n\nStudents must have sufficient background to work independently and must develop a proposal for independent study that meets the approval of the faculty supervisor and/or the MLIS Program Director. The independent study should be of sufficient academic and scholarly substance and merit to be worthy of at least three credits, and it should result in a product that will document both the substance and merit of the study. An independent study is not a substitute for taking a class.\n\nInternship\n\nNo academic credit is given for an internship. An internship is a student work experience in a library or information center for which the sponsoring institution may or may not pay the student for hours worked. The sponsoring institution sets the hours, interviews the student, and provides any job training required. The MLIS office posts notices of internships.\n\nDual Degree Programs for MLIS\n\nSt. Catherine University offers a fast track, \"3+2\" dual degree option for MLIS for a limited number of St. Kate's students enrolled as bachelor's degree-seeking students in the following majors. Refer to the Pre-Library and Information Science (Masters) section of the undergraduate catalog for details.\n\nCommunication Studies\n\nCritical Studies of Race and Ethnicity\n\nEconomics\n\nEnglish\n\nHistory\n\nPolitical Science\n\nPublic Policy\n\nSociology\n\nWomen’s Studies\n\nQualifying students will complete their undergraduate major in three years. In their fourth year - while still enrolled at the undergraduate level - students will begin taking MLIS courses while completing remaining undergraduate courses. In their fifth year, students will complete the MLIS degree while enrolled as graduate students. Eligible students must meet all MLIS admission requirements.\n\nProgram for St. Catherine Undergraduate Seniors Taking MLIS Courses\n\nQualified seniors enrolled at St. Catherine University have the opportunity to take 1-3 courses (up to 9 credits) in the MLIS program while completing their undergraduate degree. These graduate credits count as electives toward the bachelor’s degree, or (with approval) as course replacements within the student’s major in the undergraduate program. Additionally, the credits apply toward the graduate degree if the student is admitted into the MLIS program after completing the bachelor’s degree.\n\nEligibility\n\nUndergraduate students must meet the following conditions to be eligible for the Program:\n\nCurrent enrollment in a St. Catherine bachelor’s degree program (CFW or CFA)\n\nCompletion of at least 90 semester credits by the first day of the graduate class\n\nCompletion of at least 16 credits in residence in the CFW or CFA bachelor’s program\n\nAn institutional cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher\n\nIn need of elective credits (or approved course replacement within the major) to complete their bachelor’s degree requirements\n\nApproval from the Academic Advising Office\n\nPlease note: being eligible for the program (based on the above criteria) does not guarantee approval by the MLIS program director to enroll in a graduate-level course.\n\nApplication\n\nInterested students must meet with Academic Advising to confirm eligibility and to obtain guidance in completing the following application requirements for MLIS consideration:\n\nPersonal statement indicating professional background and personal goals (one page)\n\nCurrent résumé\n\nOne recommendation completed by a St. Kate’s faculty member, attesting to the student’s readiness for graduate academic rigor\n\nStudents who are eligible for the Program will submit the above required documents to their academic advisor, who will forward the material (along with a copy of the student’s current St. Catherine University transcript) to the MLIS Program Director for review. If the Program Director approves the request for graduate-level enrollment, the director and student will discuss course options for the upcoming semester(s). The student then works with her academic advisor to register for the graduate course(s) during the upcoming registration period.\n\nBoth the Academic Advising Office and the MLIS program reserve the right to limit the number of undergraduate students in the graduate courses. Students who receive approval for graduate enrollment will be registered for specific graduate courses on a first-come, first-served basis. Undergraduate students must complete all of the course work and meet the same academic expectations required of the graduate students in the MLIS classes.\n\nAcceptance to the Program and enrollment in a graduate-level course does not guarantee admission into the full MLIS degree program (or other St. Catherine University graduate programs) if the student applies for graduate admission in the future.\n\nNon-Degree Seeking Students\n\nApplicants in the following categories may be admitted as non-degree seeking students:\n\nstudents in other graduate library and information science programs, if the institution in which they are enrolled will accept credit earned at St. Catherine University as part of the requirements for their graduate degree\n\nstudents enrolled in other graduate degree programs needing a course to complete certification requirements for a specific degree, and with permission of the MLIS Program Director\n\nstudents with a previously earned MLIS degree\n\nTuition for a graduate non-degree seeking student is the same as for degree-seeking students. Non-degree seeking students are limited to two MLIS courses for a total of six semester credits, and are not eligible for financial aid.\n\nMAOL Certificates\n\nThe online Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership (MAOL) program offers two graduate specialty certificates that include LIS courses: (1) Information Services and Technology Leadership certificate and (2) Library Leadership certificate. Students in another graduate degree program at St. Catherine may pursue a certificate.\n\nSee the Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership section of this catalog for more information.\n\nMaster of Library and Information Science Program\n\nThe MLIS program is designed to educate entry-level librarians and information specialists and provide the educational foundations for lifelong professional development. Students may prepare for positions in public and academic libraries, schools or specialized libraries in the public and private sectors.\n\nThe 36-credit curriculum is composed of a range of courses to prepare students for professional responsibilities in a diverse spectrum of libraries and information organizations. There is no thesis requirement.\n\nThe maximum load is nine credit hours per semester and six credit hours in the summer session.\n\nDegree Requirements: MLIS\n\nThe degree of Master of Library and Information Science is conferred upon candidates who have met the following requirements:\n\ncompletion of a minimum of 36 graduate semester credits in Library and Information Science, with a minimum of 27-30 credits completed in St. Catherine University’s MLIS program\n\nattainment of a minimum grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale\n\nsatisfactory completion of the required courses\n\nStudents in the MLIS/SLMS track must complete a pre-student teaching interview, student teaching experience and an approved ePortfolio\n\ncompletion of the degree program within five years\n\nfiling an Intent to Graduate form with the Office of the Registrar in the semester before the anticipated graduation date\n\ncurrent resume submitted to the MLIS program office during the last semester (required as part of the ePortfolio)\n\nStudents graduating also are asked to complete the graduating student survey.\n\nCurriculum\n\nCourse List Code Title Credits LIS 7010Introduction to Library and Information Science3 LIS 7030Organization of Knowledge3 LIS 7040Information Access Services3 LIS 7050Research Methods for Library Information Science3 LIS 7700Management of Libraries and Information Centers3 3 LIS 8900ePortfolio0 18 Total Credits36\n\nAll courses require LIS 7010 Introduction to Library and Information Science as a prerequisite, and therefore LIS 7010 Introduction to Library and Information Science is the recommended first course for all MLIS students. Students should schedule the other core courses as early in their program of study as possible.\n\nThe majority of the elective courses require one or more courses as prerequisites. Prerequisites may be waived by the instructor. Students should contact the instructor if requesting a prerequisite waiver.\n\nMaster of Library and Information Science with School Library Media Specialist License Program\n\nThis option within the Master of Library and Information Science degree program is designed to educate students wishing to become school librarians and technology integration specialists. The prescribed course sequence fulfills the requirements for the Minnesota license for K-12 Library Media Specialist.\n\nBy pursuing this option, students learn the principles of librarianship in general and service to children and young adults in particular. Developmental psychology of the child, pre-adolescent, and adolescent is woven into the literature courses. The philosophy of education for elementary, middle and secondary school levels is an integral part of the curriculum.\n\nSome of the topics in the curriculum include\n\ninformation literacy\n\neducator collaboration\n\nintegration of the library media program into school curriculum\n\ninstructional technology\n\nliterature-based curriculum\n\nprogram administration\n\ncommunication\n\nprofessional development\n\nStudents graduate from this program with a firm understanding of the roles of the school librarian and the library media program within the school context and the extended school learning community. Graduates become educational leaders in their schools and school districts.\n\nDegree Requirements: MLIS with SLMS Licensure\n\nTo fulfill the requirements for the MLIS degree with the Minnesota School Library Media Specialist licensure, students must:\n\nfulfill all the requirements for the MLIS Degree substituting LIS 7730 for LIS 7700\n\ncomplete the prescribed SLMS sequence of ten courses plus two electives (36 semester credits)\n\nsuccessfully complete the clinical experience/student teaching\n\nif you do not hold a Minnesota Tier 3 or 4 teaching license:\n\nsuccessfully complete the pre-student teaching interview in the semester before student teaching\n\nmeet the general education and professional education requirements of the State of Minnesota by completing the additional required courses\n\ncomplete an edTPA (Teacher Performance Assessment) portfolio\n\nIn order to receive their teaching license, teacher candidates must complete the licensure application process.

These experiences are designed to meet the Minnesota licensure requirements.\n\nFor field experiences:\n\nInitial license candidates complete 100 hours of fieldwork in elementary, middle, and high schools before student teaching. These are embedded in course requirements\n\nAdditional license candidates complete 40 hours of fieldwork at elementary, middle, and high schools prior to their practicum. These are embedded in course requirements\n\nUpon completion of the required course work, students register for LIS 7283 Clinical Experience/Student Teaching or LIS 7286 Clinical Experience/Student Teaching.\n\nLIS 7283 Clinical Experience/Student Teaching (3 credits) is for educators with a current Minnesota teaching license. This is a minimum of 80 hours of clinical observations, as determined by the program to address gaps in experience, and supervised practicum.\n\nLIS 7286 Clinical Experience/Student Teaching (6 credits) is for students who do not possess Minnesota teaching credentials. This is 12 weeks, full time of clinical observations and supervised student teaching. Requests for alternative arrangements must still meet the equivalent of 12 full time weeks and should be discussed with the St. Kate’s School Library Media Program Coordinator. Such requests must ultimately be approved by the Minnesota Professional Educator Standards and Licensing Board (PELSB).\n\nInitial Licensure Candidates\n\nIf students do not already hold a Minnesota Tier 3 or 4 teaching license, they must complete the following courses to meet the remaining Minnesota state licensing requirements for the Standards of Effective Practice.
