        "text": "SCOAP3 — Open Access in High-Energy Physics\n\nAPS participates in SCOAP3 (Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics), an international coalition of more than 3,000 libraries and research institutions from over 45 participating countries. Managed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), it funds open access publishing in high-energy physics research.\n\nUnder the SCOAP3 model, high-energy physics papers posted to the arXiv and published in Physical Review Letters (PRL), Physical Review C (PRC), and Physical Review D (PRD) can be published open access, without any article publication charges (APCs) to authors.\n\nAPS has been participating in SCOAP3 since Jan. 1, 2018 and the current arrangement extends to articles published through 2027.\n\nHow It Works\n\nPost your high-energy physics (hep) paper to the arXiv with a primary category of hep-ex, hep-th, hep-ph, or hep-lat.*\n\nNote arXiv moderators have the right to review and change categorization if it is deemed incorrect.\n\nSubmit your article to PRL , PRC , or PRD .\n\nProvide your arXiv ID to APS during submission, or as soon as possible afterwards. It must be received before publication. Delays may occur if the arXiv ID is received after the article is accepted for publication.\n\nAPS will automatically check eligibility with the arXiv\n\nAuthors must agree to publish their article with a CC-BY license .\n\nArticles will be published open access, without any cost to authors, and include the text ‘Funded by SCOAP3’.\n\nSUBMIT YOUR ARTICLE\n\n*Articles must be posted to the appropriate category. arXiv.org is a fully independent service and neither APS nor the SCOAP3 collaboration can challenge the decision of arXiv moderators regarding a possible reclassification of an article."
