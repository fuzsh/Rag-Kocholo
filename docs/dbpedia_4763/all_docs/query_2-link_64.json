        "text": "FAQ(English)\n\nOPAC is not operating normally. (OPAC recommended browsers and Notice)\n\nRecommended browsers\n\nWe recommend using the latest versions of the following browsers so that OPAC is easy to use:\n\nWindows\n\nInternet Explorer\n\nMozilla Firefox\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\nMacintosh\n\nSafari\n\nNotice\n\nThese browsers do not operate normally with the following settings. Change these settings when applicable.\n\nCookies setting: Disable\n\nCompatibility View setting: Enable (Internet Explorer)\n\nReferer setting: Disable\n\n* If the Referer setting in your browser is Disable, the browser does not operate normally. After enabling Referer, access OPAC again.\n\n* It is possible for the content to be displayed as follows when the compatibility view is turned on with Internet Explorer8.\n\nThe column width of specific items in the bibliography details holdings list narrows drastically.\n\nA gray line borders each bibliography in the search result list.\n\n★What can I find with OPAC?\n\nOPAC has tabs with various search targets. You can search for the following on the respective tabs:\n\nBib Search: Books and serials in our collection\n\nArticle Search: Articles, etc. accessible domestically\n\nOther Univ.: Books, serials, etc. in the possession of university libraries, etc. nationwide\n\nCross Search: Materials in the possession of national universities, the National Diet Library, bookstores, etc.\n\nSwitch to and use the tab appropriate to the search target and materials.\n\nFor details, see the respective tab.\n\n★I would like an explanation of matters such as how to use each database, how to find materials, and how to use the library effectively.\n\nAn answer is currently being prepared.\n\nI'm looking for a material titled _____. How should I begin?\n\n1. To search materials for a book\n\n[Bib Search] allows you to perform a search.\n\nPerform your search from the [Bib Search] tab.\n\nIf you do not find the material with [Bib Search], you may get it from another university library for a fee.\n\nYou can search other universities from the [Other Univ.] tab and the [Cross Search] tab.\n\nThe Cross Search can search the National Diet Library and local library book collections.\n\nThe National Diet Library is struggling to store all the books published in Japan.\n\n2. To search materials for a serial\n\nSerials are basically the same as books.\n\nHowever, our serials consist of the printed versions held in the library and the electronic journals provided through agreement with the publishers and others. You can check the electronic journals from your personal computer.\n\n[Article Search] makes it convenient to search for an electronic journal.\n\n3. To search materials for an article\n\nPerform a search from the [Article Search] tab.\n\nFrom Basic Search on [Article Search], you can perform a search without specifying a specific search site.\n\nTo perform a search specifying a specific search site, do so from Advanced Search.\n\nThe pop-up blocker appears when I reserve or copy materials or apply for an inter-library loan.\n\nDepending on the settings of your browser, an action such as reserving or copying materials or applying for an inter-library loan (ILL) will trigger the pop-up blocker, which will prevent you from proceeding any further.\n\n* The screenshot is from Internet Explorer 9. The pop-up blocker appears in different locations depending on your browser and version. For details, see the help of the respective browser.\n\nThe pop-up screen is used for all applications from OPAC, such as for a reservation, ILL, or new arrival alert. Therefore, enable pop-ups by using the following method. (The descriptions apply to Internet Explorer 9.)\n\nTemporarily allowing the pop-up blocker\n\nClick [Allow once] on the pop-up blocker notification bar.\n\n(Depending on the browser version, select \"Temporarily Allow Pop-ups.\")\n\n* However, with this method, if the browser is closed once, the pop-up blocker is enabled when the browser is started again. Consequently, the same work will need to be repeated to apply for a reservation or ILL in OPAC.\n\nAlways allowing the pop-up blocker\n\nClick \"Always allow\" from [Options for this site] on the pop-up blocker notification bar.\n\n(Depending on the browser version, click the notification bar, and select \"Always Allow Pop-ups from This Site.\")\n\n* Even with the pop-up blocker enabled, some notification bars may not appear. In such cases, select [Tools] -> [Pop-up Blocker] -> [Pop-up Blocker Settings] from the browser menu. Then, enter the website address to be unblocked in \"Address of website to allow,\" and click [Add]. Click [Close] to exit the screen.\n\n* Safari users are requested to go to Security in the browser settings menu to confirm that no check mark is entered in the \"Block Pop-up Windows\" check box.\n\n* If you are a Google Chrome user, click here.\n\nAfter enabling pop-ups as described above, repeat the procedure for your application from the beginning.\n\nWhat should I do if I know only part of the title of the material?\n\nOnce you enter part of a keyword on the [Bib Search] tab, the suggestion function displays materials whose titles begin with your entered character string in a list of potential matches.\n\nSelect one from the displayed potential matches and press the [Search] button to start the search.\n\nHow do I search with an ISBN or ISSN (number)?\n\nYou can perform a search simply by entering the ISBN or ISSN (number) on the search bar of the [Bib Search] tab.\n\nYou can also perform a search from the advanced search screen by clicking the [Advanced Search] button on the [Bib Search] tab.\n\nYou can perform the search by filling in the ISBN/ISSN field.\n\nISBN (International Standard Book Number): This number identifies a book.\n\nISSN (International Standard Serial Number): This number identifies a serial.\n\nHow do I search for materials when I don't remember the title?\n\nThink about keywords about the materials. Then, try a search by switching to Advanced Search on the [Bib Search] tab and entering the keywords.\n\nIf the search has an excessive number of hits, you can narrow it down with the [Classification] item from the [Refine Your Search] menu displayed on the left side of the search result list screen. In addition to using the classification item, you can also narrow down your search by material type, holding library, author, publication year, classification, subject, publisher, language, etc.\n\nIf the keyword search is unsuccessful, try using Search by Classification in the lower part of the [Bib Search] tab.\n\nFor example, suppose you are searching for statistics-related materials. From Search by Classification, you can narrow down the search to the materials in the following fields by selecting and performing the search with\n\n\"4: Natural science -> 41: Mathematics -> 417: Probabilities. Mathematical statistics.\"\n\nWhat should I do if I want to use a combination of multiple search conditions (such as one including x or y)?\n\nYou can perform the following three searches by entering multiple conditions in a single search field or filling in multiple search fields (logical operation).\n\nEntering multiple search values in one search field (enabled on the basic search screen and advanced search screen)\n\nLogical AND search: Search for materials that simultaneously satisfy two or more search valuesEntry method: Connect all search values with \" \" (blank).Example: Search for materials containing both \"Japan\" and \"America\"\"Japan America\"Logical OR search: Search for materials that satisfy any one of two or more search valuesEntry method: Connect all search values with \"+\" (plus sign).Example: Search for materials containing either \"Japan\" or \"America\"\"Japan+America\"Logical NOT search: Search for materials that satisfy certain conditions and do not satisfy other corresponding conditionsEntry method: Connect all search values with \"^\" (caret).Example: Search for materials containing \"Japan\" but not \"America\"\"Japan^America\"\n\nEntering multiple search values in multiple search fields (enabled on the advanced search screen)\n\nLogical AND search: Search for materials that simultaneously satisfy two or more search valuesEntry method: Enter search values in multiple fields, and select \"AND\" from the pull-down menu between the fields.Example: Search for materials containing \"Japan\" in the title and \"Tokyo\" in the author's nameTitle: Japan\n\nPull-down menu: ANDAuthor: TokyoLogical NOT search: Search for materials that satisfy certain items and do not satisfy other itemsEntry method: Enter search values in multiple fields, and select \"NOT\" from the pull-down menu between the fields.Example: Search for materials that contain \"Japan\" in the title and do not contain \"Tokyo\" in the author's nameTitle: Japan\n\nPull-down menu: NOTAuthor: Tokyo\n\nPrimary search items and secondary search items\n\nThe following search items are called primary search items. You can perform searches independently with their search values alone.\n\nKeyword\n\nTitle\n\nAuthor\n\nPublisher\n\nSubject\n\nReview\n\nTag\n\nClassification\n\nISBN/ISSN\n\nNCID\n\nBibliography ID\n\nRegistration No.\n\nMaterial ID\n\nCall No.\n\nThe following search items are called secondary search items. You cannot perform a search with a secondary search item unless it is combined with at least one primary search item. The search screen displays * in front of the item names.\n\nMaterial type\n\nHolding library\n\nPublication year\n\nCountry code\n\nLanguage code\n\nLocation\n\nMaterial format\n\nSection\n\nWhen I search for materials whose title starts with _____, or ends with _____.\n\nThere are two search methods: keyword search and literal search.\n\nThe keyword search is a search of materials to find those containing the entered search value as a word (i.e., keyword).\n\nThe literal search is a search of materials to find those containing the entered search value as a simple character string (i.e., literal).\n\nFor the literal search, you can specify the following search methods.\n\nSearch methodDescriptionEntry exampleExample of hitExact matchRetrieves the materials that have a complete match to the character string entered as a search condition.endend END EndPrefix searchRetrieves the materials that have a character string matching the prefix entered as a search condition.end*ending\n\nLeft/right truncation searchRetrieves the materials that have a character string matching the left/right truncation entered as a search condition.*end*weekends\n\nSuffix searchRetrieves the materials that have a character string matching the suffix entered as a search condition.*endweekend\n\nSearches for the following search items are normal keyword searches.

Note that the borrowing period is not an added period from the due date.\n\nRenewal is not possible in the following cases:\n\nMaterials for \"holiday loan\"\n\nMaterials already reserved by another user\n\nOverdue materials and materials in a restricted borrowing period\n\nWhere update may not be possible depending on the material type (textbooks, serials, etc.)\n\nHow do I cancel a reservation?\n\nWhen you want to cancel a reserved material, you can delete the reservation from OPAC.\n\n1.

Click [OK] in the pop-up.\n\n5. \"Canceled\" appears under Status upon the completion of the reservation cancellation.\n\n★What happens when materials become overdue or have borrowing restrictions?\n\nIf you do not return library materials even after their due dates have passed, borrowing is restricted on your account until you return the materials whose due dates have passed. Meanwhile, with materials overdue or penalties incurred, the account cannot reserve or renew any of the library materials.\n\nBe sure to return all materials within their borrowing period.\n\n[Notice]\n\nCancellation of a borrowing restriction takes effect on OPAC at about 6:00 a.m. on the cancellation date.\n\nIf you are a user whose borrowing is restricted but you want to renew or reserve different materials currently checked out from the same library/room, do so after 6:00 a.m. on the borrowing restriction cancellation date.\n\nLibraries/rooms have book drops. Any materials returned after hours to the book drop of a library are basically considered returned on the previous business day with the return processed on the next business day.\n\nLibrary/room use privileges may be suspended for long overdue accounts.\n\nOverdue materials and materials with penalties incurred at a library/room can be borrowed from another library/room. They can also be reserved and renewed from OPAC.\n\nEven if your account still had overdue materials and a borrowing restriction, you could apply from OPAC to copy a book (get a copy from another library) and borrow a book (back-order the actual book). You could also make a library purchase request (* Being prepared).\n\nWhat is [Reserve Book] in the catalog search menu under the keyword input box on the [Bib Search] tab?\n\nReserve Book enables you to view a list of syllabuses, instructor-specified textbooks, reference books, etc.\n\nYou can change the display target from the pull-down menu.\n\nWhat are the reviews displayed on the review list screen?\n\nOn the Review List screen, you can check a list of bibliographies that have reviews.\n\nBy clicking the RSS icon , you can check newly registered reviews in the RSS reader you normally use.\n\nYou can register a review from the bibliography details screen.\n\nWhat are the tags displayed on the tag search screen?\n\nYou can group multiple materials by adding a tag to the materials.\n\nYou can search for a tag on the tag search screen to display a list of materials that have this tag.\n\nSuppose you add a tag such as the following: \"_____ seminar reference book\" or \"A must read for _____ class.\" Then, after a tag search, anyone can bring up the same list of materials.\n\nFor example, try clicking a tag in \"New tags,\" \"Recent tags,\" or \"Popular tags.\" Then, materials that have these tags are displayed.\n\nYou can register tags on the search result list screen and the bibliography details screen.\n\nWhat should I do if I want to search reviews and tags?\n\nYou can search the title or full text of reviews and tags in any of the following five ways.\n\nSee \" New Tags\" and \" New Reviews\" on the top page.\n\nSelect \"Review List\" or \"Search Tags\" under the search bar on the [Bib Search] tab.\n\nIn [Basic Search] on the [Bib Search] tab, enter a check mark for \"Contains review and tag.\"\n\nIn [Advanced Search] on the [Bib Search] tab, select \"Review\" or \"Tag\" from the pull-down menu and search the materials.\n\n(In contrast to the basic search, you can perform a search with multiple conditions.)\n\nSelect \"Review List\" or \"Search Tags\" from the catalog search menu.\n\nHow do I return to the original search result list after a refined search from the left menu on the search result list display screen?\n\nThe following screen appears when you have entered a keyword and performed a refined search from the left menu on the Bib Search result list screen.\n\nIn the example, the material type is limited to \"books.\"\n\nCancel the search conditions for this holding library. Then, to return to the original search result list, click the red x button in the blank area under \"Selecting conditions.\"\n\nEven if you have performed multiple refined searches, you can cancel any narrow-down search condition by using the above method, regardless of the order of the searches.\n\nSuppose that you perform a refined search of a holding library, select a bibliography on the bibliography search result list screen, and then move to the bibliography details screen.
