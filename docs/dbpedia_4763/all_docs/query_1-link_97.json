Core courses completed with a grade of less than \"B-\" (e.g., C+, C) will not be counted toward the program course requirements, but the grade will be calculated in the program and overall graduate grade point average.\n\nElective courses completed with a grade of less than \"C\" will not be counted toward the program course requirements, but the grade will be calculated in the program and overall graduate grade point average.\n\n*If a student were in a Dual Program (MLIS + SLMS), ILS 545 replaces ILS 509.\n\nProgram Assessment\n\n1.
