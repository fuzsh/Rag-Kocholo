        "text": "The 5 Laws of Library Science is a theory proposed by S. R. Ranganathan in 1931, detailing the principles of operating a library system. Five laws of library science are called the set of norms, percepts, and guides to good practice in librarianship. Many librarians worldwide accept them as the foundations of their philosophy. Dr. S.R. Ranganathan conceived the Five Laws of Library Science in 1924. The statements embodying these laws were formulated in 1928. These laws were first published in Ranganathan's classic book entitled Five Laws of Library Science in 1931.\n\nThese laws are:\n\n1. Books Are For Use\n\n2. Every Reader His/Her Book\n\n3. Every Book Its Reader\n\n4. Save The Time Of The Reader\n\n5. The Library Is A Growing Organism\n\nThese laws of Library Science are the \"fundamental laws\" of Library Science. These are applicable to any problem in the areas of library science, library service, and library practice. These laws are like pot containing oceans. Prior to their enunciation, the subject of Library Science had no philosophy. These laws gave a philosophical base, guaranteeing an everlasting future to the subject of library science, the profession of librarianship, and the use of libraries. These laws have provided a scientific approach to the subject of library science. Even though S.R. Ranganathan proposed the Five Laws of Library Science before the advent of the digital age, they are still valid and equally relevant today.¹\n\nNote\n\nA corollary of the Fourth Law of Library Science is \"Save the time of the staff\"\n\nIn the present day context, the term \"book\" should be used in a broader context to mean a \"Resource\".\n\nContents\n\nFirst Law: Books Are For Use\n\nImplications\n\nOpen Access\n\nLocation\n\nLibrary Hours\n\nLibrary Building and Furniture\n\nBook Selection Policy\n\nLibrary Techniques\n\nPublicity\n\nLibrary Staff\n\nReference Service\n\nSecond Law: Every Reader His/Her Book\n\nImplications / Obligations\n\nObligations of the State\n\nObligations of the Library Authority\n\nObligations of Library Staff\n\nObligations of the Reader\n\nThird Law: Every Book Its Reader\n\nImplications\n\nOpen Access\n\nBook Selection\n\nShelf Arrangement\n\nEasy Accessibility\n\nCataloging\n\nReference Service\n\nPublicity\n\nExtension Service\n\nFourth Law: Save The Time Of The Reader\n\nImplications\n\nOpen Access\n\nLocation\n\nShelf Arrangement, Classification, and Cataloging\n\nStack-Room Guides\n\nIssue and Return\n\nReference Service\n\nDocumentation Service\n\nLibrary Staff\n\nFifth Law: The Library Is A Growing Organism\n\nImplications\n\nBalanced Growth\n\nCasting Off the Old (Obsolete) and Preserving Valuable Books\n\nChoice of a Classification Scheme\n\nChoice of a Catalog Code\n\nModernization\n\nStaff\n\nLibrary Building - Provision for Future\n\nSafeguards\n\nVariants of Five Laws of Library Science\n\nFive Laws of Library Science Articles and News\n\nFive Laws of Library Science Book by S.R. Ranganathan (Digitized Book)\n\nFive Laws of Library Science Infographic\n\nFive Laws of Library Science Quiz\n\nFIRST LAW: BOOKS ARE FOR USE\n\nA book is a guide, a friend, and a philosopher. A writer writes a book to communicate his thoughts. The primary purpose of writing, therefore, is that the thought it contains should be communicated. To do so it is necessary to put the books for use. The first law, therefore, truly demands that all efforts should be made to ensure that all the books kept in the library are used because it is created for use. The first law \"Books are for use\" places emphasis on the use of books rather than storage. Books were once kept in closed access in order to prevent theft, but this discouraged free use and prevented loaning. The first law of library science \"books are for use\" means that books in libraries are not meant to be shut away from its users.\n\nThe first law constitutes the basis for library services. Dr. Ranganathan observed that books were often chained to prevent their removal and that the emphasis was on storage and preservation rather than use. He did not reject the notion that preservation and storage were important, but he asserted that the purpose of such activities was to promote use. Without user access to materials, there is little value in these items. By emphasizing use, Dr. Ranganathan refocused the attention of the field to access-related issues, such as the library's location, loan policies, hours and days of operation, as well as the quality of staffing and mundane matters like library furniture, temperature control, and lighting.\n\nFirst Law - Books are for Use is the ones of the Five Laws of Library Science that Ranganathan remarked as ‘trivial truism’ in his writing “Library Science and Scientific Method.”⁷ Trivial Truism refers to a statement of little value or importance that is obviously true and says nothing new or interesting. So here Dr. S. R. Rangangathan means to say that the First Law - Books are for Use is obviously true and understood. Ranganathan says in this work:\n\nBefore dealing with these factors, a word should be said about the remark that the First Law - Books are for Use - is a trivial truism. The first law of most of the science is equally so. For example, Newton’s first law of motion reads, “Every body preserves in its state of rest unless it is compelled to change that state by impressed forces.” Is this not a truism?\n\nImplications\n\nOpen Access - Open access of books enhance their use. In this system, every reader is allowed to go to the shelves and choose the book of his interest. In case he does not find the desired book of his interest, he can choose some other from the shelves.\n\nLocation - A library should be situated near the central place. If it as an institutional library, then it should be situated near the center of the institutional complex. If it is a public library then it should be in the center of the city.\n\nLibrary Hours - The first law demands that a library should be kept open for long hours, and during the hours which suits to its patrons most.\n\nLibrary Building and Furniture - There should be a functional library building with pleasant, natural, and electrical light, soothing interior, good looking furniture, comfortable chairs, etc.\n\nBook Selection Policy - Books should be purchased which are relevant to the needs of the readers. Books should be attractive such as it fills the reader with pleasure.\n\nLibrary Techniques - Proper cataloging and classification of books are essential for promoting the use of books.\n\nPublicity - The First Law demands wide publicity of each and every book of the library. For example, the librarian can bring out the list of new additions and latest arrivals through the Current Awareness Service (CAS) or Selective Dissemination of Information Services (SDI).\n\nLibrary Staff - A library cannot come up to the expectation of the first law unless its staff is attentive and cheerful, and cares for the books and readers. Readers should be looked upon as customers. Some readers are shy and are not informed about the complex library techniques. The library staff should help such users to find their desired book. It will not only satisfy readers but also enhance library's use.\n\nReference Service - Reference service aims to establish the right contact between the right reader and right book at the right time. A collection of library resources would not be used fully unless the reference librarian makes effort to help the users to exploit the resources of the library. This personal service will lead to the greater use of books.\n\nSECOND LAW: EVERY READER HIS / HER BOOK\n\nThe second law of library science is \"Every Reader His / Her Book\". This law implies that the \"books are for use of all\" or \"books for all.\" The Second Law stressed on the democratization of the library where every reader has the equal right to get the book of his / her interest. The second law fixed some responsibilities or obligations of the state, the library authority, the library staff, and the readers. A library should serve all patrons, no matter their age, race, or economic status.\n\nThis law suggests that every member of the community should be able to obtain materials needed. Dr. Ranganathan felt that all individuals from all social environments were entitled to library service and that the basis of library use was education, to which all were entitled. These entitlements were not without some important obligations for both libraries/librarians and library patrons. Librarians should have excellent first-hand knowledge of the people to be served. Collections should meet the special interests of the community, and libraries should promote and advertise their services extensively to attract a wide range of readers.\n\nThe second law of library science \"every reader his/her book\" means that librarians serve a wide collection of patrons, acquire literature to fit a vast collection of needs, do not judge what specific patrons choose to read. Everyone has different tastes and differences and we should respect that.\n\nThe possible absence of a physical knowledge storage object doesn’t dilute the power of Ranganathan’s second principle; it is certainly relevant to media in all forms including the Internet.\n\nImplications / Obligations\n\nObligations of the State - When we say \"Every Reader His / Her Book\" or \"Books for All\", the state or government automatically comes in picture. The state has a certain obligation to its citizens and one of these is to provide equal opportunity to read. Ranganathan has discussed obligations of the state under three head. (i) Finance--providing finance by giving grants and by levying library cess (Ranganathan's choice), (ii) Legislation--enacting library legislation, and (iii) Coordination--of activities to ensure \"Books for All\"\n\nObligations of the Library Authority - The second law has something to say to library authorities in respect to the selection of books and staff. A library has limited finance. It is therefore desirable to know the requirements of the readers before selecting the books. Similarly, library authority should select staff for their library with professional competence and missionary zeal.\n\nObligations of Library Staff - Library staff should be cooperative and service minded. Library staff should form a bridge between readers and books, only then every reader will have his/her book. When a reader enters a library, the library staff should approach him with a helping hand. Second Law strongly advocates user education program in libraries.\n\nObligations of the Reader - The Second Law expects the readers also to discharge some responsibilities. Readers should be disciplined and follow rules and regulations. Readers should restrain from cutting pages from books, keeping books beyond the due date, etc. All such acts amount to keeping other readers away from their books.\n\nTHIRD LAW: EVERY BOOK ITS READER\n\nThe Third Law prescribes Every Book its Reader. The emphasis is on the book. This law desires that every book in a library must find its reader. It implies that there should be maximum use of books by their users.\n\nThis principle is closely related to the second law, but it focuses on the item itself, suggesting that each item in a library has an individual or individuals who would find that item useful. Dr. Ranganathan argued that the library could devise many methods to ensure that each item finds its appropriate reader. One method involved the basic rules for access to the collection, most notably the need for open shelving.\n\nThe third law of library science \"every book its reader\" means a library's books have a place in the library even if a smaller demographic might choose to read it.\n\nIt is, therefore, necessary to adopt measures to ensure successful implementation of the demand of the Third Law. The factors that may be kept in view in this regard have been discussed below:\n\nImplications\n\nOpen Access - It is one of the most effective ways to ensure that the maximum number of books are seen by the readers. It also happens sometimes that the reader to the shelves in search of a book and in the process of search select many more books.\n\nBook Selection - Give full weightage to the tastes and requirements of the clientele of the library. Difficulties of the Third Law can be minimized by adopting a well-balanced book selection policy. If the right books are selected it will definitely find its readers\n\nShelf Arrangement - If the books are arranged so that the subjects get arranged according to the degree of mutual relationship, then each book would have a higher probability of getting its readers.\n\nEasy Accessibility - Books should be placed within easy reach of the readers. It has been observed that the books within the comfortable reach of the readers are most frequently used. For easy accessibility, shelves should not be higher than 6.5 ft.\n\nCataloging - Proper cataloging of books is very important as even though there may be well planned and arranged books on the shelves but they are incapable merely by itself. Series entry and cross-reference entries are highly useful in drawing the attention of the readers. Analytical entries increase the chance of a composite book getting its reader.\n\nReference Service - A reference librarian should know about the world of books and try to find out a reader for every one of these. The reference librarian should act as a canvassing agent for each book.\n\nPublicity - Publicity is a very powerful weapon to attract readers to the library and thereby to increase the chances of every book to find its reader. For example, the arrival of new books may be brought to the notice of the readers by displaying them, near the entrance of the library, or by communicating the readers through an e-newsletter or broadcasting information about them through the Twitter handle of the library.\n\nExtension Service - The library attract readers by converting itself into a cultural and social center. A library does this by organizing exhibitions, musical concerts, a magic show, celebration of local and national festivals, etc. Once the people come to these functions, then the library can make an attempt to bring books and readers together.\n\nFOURTH LAW: SAVE THE TIME OF THE READER\n\nThe Fourth Law says \"Save the Time of the Reader.\" A library user must be assumed a busy person. It is essential to keep the reader satisfied and a reader is satisfied most if his/her time is saved, i.e., if he gets the needed service in minimum possible time.\n\nThis law is a recognition that part of the excellence of library service is its ability to meet the needs of the library user efficiently. To this end, Dr. S.R. Ranganathan recommended the use of appropriate business methods to improve library management. He observed that centralizing the library collection in one location provided distinct advantages. He also noted that excellent staff would not only include those who possess strong reference skills, but also strong technical skills in cataloging, cross-referencing, ordering, accessioning, and the circulation of materials.\n\nThe fourth law of library science \"save the time of the user\" means that all patrons should be able to easily locate the material they desire quickly and efficiently.\n\nImplications\n\nOpen Access - In a closed access of books time is wasted unnecessarily. In open access, the time of the readers is saved. If open access is not there then the reader has to make the choice of the books through the searching of the library catalog. Then the reader requests the library staff the book which he has searched in the catalog. The staff searches the required book and if the staff is not able to trace the book, then the reader again needs to search the catalog. These problems can be avoided if open access is provided where the readers can themselves go to the shelves to search their book.\n\nLocation - The location of the library is of great importance. It must be centrally located so that it is conveniently accessible to the community served. For an institutional library, it should be in the center of the institution, for a public library it should be in the center of the city. Centrally located library saves the times of the users in visiting it.\n\nShelf Arrangement, Classification, and Cataloging - Proper classification schemes should be used in the library. Books should be arranged on shelves according to the classification number. Regular shelf rectification is also essential. In order to save the time of the readers, the library catalog should aim to provide different approaches to the users. It should include analytical entries for composite books.\n\nStack-Room Guides - To save the time of the reader, the library should provide an efficient system of stack room guides. It may be quite useful to keep it at the entrance of the stack room, the whole plan of the room indicating the position of the book racks and classes of books in them.\n\nIssue and Return - Most readers want to read the book at home. For this, the library has to issue the books to the readers. Time-saving techniques for circulation to books should be used so that the user has not to spend more time in getting the book issued (or returned).\n\nReference Service - The reference staff establishes a contact between the book and the reader by providing Reference Service and Long Range Reference Services, thereby saving the time of the reader.\n\nDocumentation Service - A substantial time of readers is wasted in the literature search. The library should, therefore, undertake comprehensive or selective, as needed be, documentation services including SDI service to save the time of the reader.\n\nLibrary Staff - Library staff should be cooperative. They should help the readers to find their document keeping in mind the message of the Fourth Law, i.e., to Save the Time of the Reader.\n\nFIFTH LAW: THE LIBRARY IS A GROWING ORGANISM\n\nThe Fifth Law is \"The Library is a Growing Organism.\" A library is a social institution and it will keep growing like an organism. A library will grow in terms of documents, readers, and staff. The nature of organic growth can be either growth as a body of a child or growth as of the body of an adult. The growth of a new library will correspond to that of a child growing in all aspects. In case of a service library, once its growth has reached the adult stage, the growth would be in terms of replacing old books by new books and new users will continuously replace old users.\n\nThis law focused more on the need for internal change than on changes in the environment itself. Dr. Ranganathan argued that library organizations must accommodate growth in staff, the physical collection, and patron use. This involved allowing for growth in the physical building, reading areas, shelving, and in space for the catalog.\n\nThe fifth law of library science \"the library is a growing organism\" means that a library should be a continually changing institution, never static in its outlook. Books, methods, and the physical library should be updated over time.\n\nImplications\n\nBalanced Growth - The collection should grow in all the areas of subjects keeping in view the needs and requirements of all the readers, as far as possible.\n\nCasting Off the Old (Obsolete) and Preserving Valuable Books - Weed out old, obsolete, and unused books in order to provide space for new additions. However, librarians should take necessary steps to preserve valuable materials.\n\nChoice of a Classification Scheme - We should use a scheme of classification, which is able to meet the onslaught of knowledge reasonably well.\n\nChoice of a Catalog Code - We should use a catalog code which is able to provide treatment to all kinds of library materials yet acquired as well as new materials likely to be acquired in future.\n\nModernization - Libraries may have to think of computerization of the various housekeeping jobs like the acquisition, circulation, cataloging, etc.\n\nStaff - When a library grows, the sanctioned staff at some stage become inadequate. So at that time an increase of staff should be considered. Any standard for staffing should be accepted by the libraries, then the library would be able to get the requisite staff.\n\nLibrary Building -- Provision for Future - While planning and designing a library building, there should be a provision for the expansion of the building, both horizontally as well as vertically. The library should provide adequate space for the present as well as the future.\n\nSafeguards - As the number of readers increase, the problem of theft of books from the library becomes acute, especially in the open access system. So, it necessitates some safeguards, such as entrance and exit should be from one gate, windows should be grilled, and all readers should be checked before leaving.\n\nVARIANTS OF FIVE LAWS OF LIBRARY SCIENCE\n\nLibrarian Michael Gorman (born 6 March 1941, Witney, Oxfordshire) a British-born librarian, library scholar and editor/writer past president of the American Library Association, 2005–2006, and editor of AACR2), and Walt Crawford recommended the following laws in addition to Ranganathan's five in Future Libraries: Dreams, Madness, and Realities [American Library Association, 1995], (p. 8) Gorman later repeated them in his small book, Our Singular Strengths [American Library Association, 1998].\n\n1. Libraries serve humanity.\n\n2. Respect all forms by which knowledge is communicated.\n\n3. Use technology intelligently to enhance service.\n\n4. Protect free access to knowledge.\n\n5. Honor the past and create the future.\n\nIn 2004, librarian Alireza Noruzi recommended applying Ranganathan's laws to the Web in his paper, \"Application of Ranganathan's Laws to the Web\":\n\n1. Web resources are for use.\n\n2. Every user has his or her web resource.\n\n3. Every web resource its user.\n\n4 Save the time of the user.\n\n5. The Web is a growing organism.\n\nIn 2008, librarian Carol Simpson recommended that editing be done to Ranganathan's law due to media richness. The following were:\n\n1. Media are for use.\n\n2. Every patron his information.\n\n3. Every medium its user.\n\n4. Save the time of the patron.\n\n5. The library is a growing organism.\n\nFIVE LAWS OF LIBRARY SCIENCE ARTICLES AND NEWS\n\nList of articles and news on Five Laws of Library Science from Library and Information Science Articles and News.\n\nReordering Ranganathan: Shifting User Behaviors, Shifting Priorities⁴\n\nAn OCLC Research Report by Lynn Silipigni Connaway, Ph.D., and Ixchel Faniel, Ph.D.\n\nThis report suggests that Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan's Five Laws of Library Science can be reordered and reinterpreted to reflect today's library resources and services, as well as the behaviors that people demonstrate when engaging with them.\n\nAlthough authors Senior Research Scientist Lynn Silipigni Connaway and Associate Research Scientist Ixchel Faniel believe Ranganathan's five laws are still relevant today, their intent is to help evolve both the work done by librarians and the perceptions of libraries and librarians. By changing how we think about the five laws in terms of interpretation and order of importance, Lynn and Ixchel hope to reflect the current resources and services available for use and the behaviors that people demonstrate when engaging with them.\n\nThe objective of this publication is to provide a timely and relevant context for Ranganathan’s laws that today’s librarians, library researchers, and information scientists can refer to as they think about making changes in practice and developing agendas for future research.\n\nHighlights\n\nToday's library users challenge librarians to move from the simple declaration of \"save the time of the reader\"; meeting today's users' needs requires embedding library systems and services into their existing workflows\n\nOur modern-day rephrasing of \"every person his or her book\" is know your community and its needs\n\nThe core meaning of \"books are for use\" is still about access; however, our interpretation focuses on developing the physical and technical infrastructure needed to deliver materials\n\nOur interpretation of \"every book its reader\" focuses on increasing the discoverability, access, and use of resources within users’ existing workflows\n\nWe agree that \"a library is a growing organism\" and propose growing users' share of attention\n\nFIVE LAWS OF LIBRARY SCIENCE BOOK BY S.
