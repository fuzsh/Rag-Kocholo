        "text": "Presentation Guidelines for Serial Publications\n\nBrought to you by: The Serials Section of the Association for Library Collections Technical Services (ALCTS), A Division of the American Library Association.\n\nWhat is a Serial?\n\nSerials are print or non-print publications issued in parts, usually bearing issue numbers, issue dates, or both. A serial is expected to continue indefinitely. Serials include magazines, newsletters, newspapers, annuals (such as reports, yearbooks, and directories), journals, memoirs, proceedings, transactions of societies and numbered series.\n\nWhy is Presentation of My Serial Important?\n\nYour publication has a wider audience than you think. Besides your subscribers, other readers want to find your publication in libraries or order it from a subscription service. Directory publishers and abstracting and indexing services might want to include your title in their directory or product. Readers might want to cite your publication or articles from it in their writing. In all of these cases, having a clear and consistent title, a unique numerical identifier, and clearly presented publication information will make these tasks much easier.\n\nWhat Should I Consider in Choosing a Title?\n\nYour title should:\n\nBe unique to avoid confusion with other publications\n\nBe distinctive\n\nBe concise\n\nHave important identifying words at the beginning to help readers find your title in large files and catalogs\n\nAvoid words indicating frequency, since frequency can change\n\nAvoid initialisms or acronyms; their filing location is unpredictable\n\nHow Should I Present My Title?\n\nUse unambiguous typography\n\nClearly separate any logos from the title\n\nPlace the organization's name in a different location from your title\n\nClearly distinguish your title from any subtitles\n\nPresent your title in the same way everywhere on an issue and from one issue to another\n\nDo not modify your title in any way unless you intend a deliberate title change. (A change of typography or addition of cover wording may be misinterpreted by a library as a title change.)\n\nWhy are Title Changes a Problem?\n\nYour hard-earned identity may be lost\n\nTitle changes cost libraries money to recatalog and reshelve the title\n\nIn collections which are shelved by title, your publication may be split up among its various titles\n\nBy calling attention to your title, a title change may trigger a library to reevaluate its need for your serial\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat if I Still Want to Change the Title?\n\nMake the change at the beginning of a volume-this helps with reshelving and binding\n\nExplain the change to your readers in advance, if possible\n\nRequest a new ISSN (see section following on standard numbers)\n\nKeep the same numbering scheme unless you change the scope of the publication\n\nAvoid incremental changes; for example gradually shrinking the old title while gradually enlarging the new title over a series of issues; instead, make a clean break\n\nWhat if My Publication Merges with Another Serial?\n\nMerge at the beginning of a volume\n\nOnly begin the numbering again if a new title results from the merger\n\nTell your readers what is happening\n\nWhy Should I Number My Serial and How?\n\nA consecutive number, issue date, or both, are very important for identification, recording issues in a check-in system, claiming, etc.\n\nA numbering system is required to obtain an ISSN\n\nUse Arabic numbers, not Roman numerals. A commonly-used scheme consists of volume and issue numbers, e.g. Vol. 1, no. 1\n\nAvoid double numbering schemes, e.g. Vol. 3, issue I and no. 9\n\nWhat Should I Do About Supplements and Special Issues?\n\nSize them the same as the parent publication\n\nIndicate whether they update or are to be used with the parent publication\n\nIndicate whether they are part of the subscription\n\nCheck with your ISSN center; they may or may not be assigned the same ISSN as the parent publication, depending on their nature\n\nWhat is the ISSN and How Do I Get One?\n\nThe ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) is a unique, internationally used identification number for serial publications. It can be thought of as the social security number of the serials world. It looks like this: ISSN 1234-5672. ISSNs are assigned by a network of over 60 centers world-wide. Contact the ISSN Center responsible for assigning ISSN to serials published in your country. The International Centre's web site provides contact information for the ISSN Centers.\n\nWhy Would I Want an ISSN?\n\nTo distinguish your title from any others with which it might be confused\n\nTo help libraries and others who handle large numbers of serials to check in your title so it can get to users more quickly\n\nTo help users search automated files\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat are Some Other Standard Codes Used on Serials?\n\nISBN (International Standard Book Number)\n\nBook counterpart of the ISSN\n\nISSN and ISBN can both be used on annuals and on books in series (ISSN identifies the overall serial; ISBN identifies the particular year or monograph in the ongoing serial or series.)\n\nISBN Agency, R.R. Bowker\n\nBar Codes\n\nUsed on serials to enable scanned check-in and inventory control\n\nUPC code (Universal Product Code): found on supermarket products, including mass market magazines. Does not incorporate the ISSN.\n\nEAN (International Article Number)\n\nUsed in the U.S. by major bookstore chains for trade and other book publications. Used extensively in the U.K . for magazines. Its use is encouraged by the Periodicals Barcoding Association. Incorporates the ISSN as its second element. The Uniform Code Council is the U.S. EAN agency:\n\nUniform Code Council,\n\n8163 Old Yankee Rd.,\n\nDayton OH, (800) 543-8137\n\nHow Can I Learn More About How to Present My Serial?\n\nThe National Information Standards Organization (NISO) publishes voluntary standards in the area of libraries, information science, and publishing. This brochure is based on a draft of Standard Z39.1, Periodicals: Format and Arrangement.\n\nFor a thorough treatment of the issues highlighted in this brochure, see Serial Publications: Guidelines for Good Practice in Publishing Printed Journals and Other Serials Publications. Published by the United Kingdom Serials Group. Order address:\n\nUSKG,\n\nII 4 Woodstock Road,\n\nWhitney, OX8 6DY, England\n\n(Fax: 0993 778879).\n\nPrice: Â£l6 (approx. U.S. $25.00)\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis publication was inspired by earlier brochures created in Australia and Canada, especially the booklet entitled \"You Name It!\" published by the National Library of Canada.\n\nSince 1986, numerous individuals within RTSD (and later ALCTS) have endeavored to create a similar publication to send to a wider audience. Thanks to the following people for their past efforts and continued support: Janet Arcand, Alex Bloss, Valerie Bross, Karen Darling, Karen Muller, Anne Piternick and Ann Vidor. Thanks to the following Serials Section Committees: Committee to Study Serials Cataloging, Committee to Study Serials Standards, Serials Section Executive Committee, and the Worst Serial Title Change of the Year Committee.\n\nThis brochure was created by the Serials Section's Task Force on Serial Title Publication: Eleanor I. Cook, Serials Librarian, Appalachian State University; Regina Reynolds, Head, National Serials Data Program, Library of Congress, Phoebe Timberlake, Chair Library Resource Coordination Dept., University of New Orleans ."
