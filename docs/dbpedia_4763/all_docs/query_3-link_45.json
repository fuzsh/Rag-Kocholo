The journal aims at reporting new theories, new technologies, and new methods in the field of library and information science (LIS) from home and abroad and new application in agricultural field, as well as promoting the development of the discipline of LIS. The journal focuses on tracking and reporting the latest technologies and methods and the best practice in the LIS field.

Journal of Library and Information Science in Agriculture was published on the fifth day monthly, with 16 mo, 80 pages. An official website (http://nytsqb.aiijournal.com) was launched in 2014 to make it convenient for authors to submit papers, improve editorial and review efficiency, reduce the time needed for publication, and improve the journal’s impact. Since then, authors can submit papers and check the status of their papers online, reviewers complete peer review online and editors process manuscripts online. The website was upgraded in 2019. Authors are encouraged to participate actively in paper review and editorial process and make suggestions and communicate with the editorial office efficiently. The journal insists on “quality strategy”, setting a high standard in manuscript solicitation, review, editorial and proofreading process, and printing and distribution, and striving for improvement of journal quality and aiming at specialization and international standard. An official Wechat account “LIS in Agriculture” was launched with an aim at hot spots and frontier in the field, and it has published the latest experts’ reports and academic conferences news, serving for researchers to trace the trends in frontier research and for the journal to guide the development of the academic discipline."
