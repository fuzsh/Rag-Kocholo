        "text": "The ALA-accredited master's degree at the Information School (iSchool) prepares graduates to develop, provide, and assess information services that create, collect, organize, store, analyze, find, distribute, and use information in a diverse, technological, and global society. The program prepares information professionals to work in multiple areas of the information professions, including libraries (public, university and college, youth services, special, and government), archives, digital librarianship (which includes user experience and data analytics/management), and information organization. Students can tailor their program to include other emphases such as Tribal Libraries, Archives and Museums, social justice, and digital humanities.\n\nLibrarianship: Graduates obtain employment in college and university librarianship, public librarianship, youth and young adult librarianship, electronic collections management, science and health librarianship, research data management, and school library media centers.\n\nArchives in a Digital Age: Graduates obtain employment in digital asset management, digital preservation and curation, digital archives, corporate archives, government archives, special collections, and tribal libraries archives and museums.\n\nDigital Libraries: Design, develop, and manage information technologies with a focus on the user. Potential jobs include user experience and web design, digital humanities, digital asset management and curation, database and data management, and IT training/instruction.\n\nOrganization of Information: Graduates obtain employment in metadata management, taxonomy and ontology development and implementation, digital asset management, cataloging, XML and linked data, and database management.\n\nFull-time students generally complete the master's program in two academic years; part-time students complete it in three to four years. Students gain hands-on experience as part of their degree through the school’s required field practicum. Students may choose practicum settings based on their career goals.\n\nNamed Options\n\nStudents interested in the Master of Arts in Library and Information Studies should refer to one of the named options:\n\nCampus Program\n\nOnline Program\n\nOptional Specializations\n\nThe Information School hosts several specializations that require specific coursework from other departments or other requirements.\n\nBusiness School Graduate/Professional Certificate in Strategic Innovation: The Information School offers a specialization in information innovation and organizational change in conjunction with the School of Business graduate/professional certificate which can be completed as part of the school's MA degree (on-campus program only).\n\nCertificate in Leadership: iSchool students can earn the UW–Madison Certificate in Leadership as part of their Information School MA degree (on-campus and online programs).\n\nDouble degrees: The iSchool offers double degrees with the UW Law School, the School of Music, and the Department of Art History. These require separate admissions and additional coursework. (on-campus program only)\n\nSchool Library Media Specialist License: The School Library Media Specialist License in the State of Wisconsin is a stand-alone teaching license. The iSchool MA program can be modified to provide candidates with the educational requirements for the license taken in addition to the MA courses. Candidates already holding a valid Wisconsin teaching license can be endorsed for the School Library Media Specialist through the iSchool MA program. UW–Madison is part of the UW System School Library Education Consortium (UWSSLEC), which is a certification-only program. Because each state has its own regulations for teacher licenses, this specialization is available to Wisconsin residents or those who will be working in Wisconsin schools only.\n\nOnline students (distance degree option) should note: Specialized courses in art, music, law, and school library media specialist, as well as courses offered outside the Information School that may be part of concentrations, specializations, or double degrees, are generally not available online. For a distance student with academic background in one of these areas, combining the general Information School degree with the specialized background may be the best preparation.\n\nThe Information School master's program is accredited by the American Library Association, recognized by the Wisconsin Division for Libraries, Technology, and Community Learning for certification of public librarians, and recognized by the state's Department of Public Instruction for preparation of school library media specialists.\n\nAbout the Information School\n\nPrograms\n\nThe UW–Madison Information School, \"the iSchool,\" is a professional school offering several degrees and non-credit education that prepare students for careers in the information professions:\n\nThe iSchool MA degree is a professional master's that prepares information professionals to work in multiple areas of the information professions, including libraries (public, university and college, youth services, special, and government), archives, digital librarianship (which includes user experience and data analytics/management), and information organization.
