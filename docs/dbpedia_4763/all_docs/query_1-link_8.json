        "text": "By The ALA/ACRL/STS Task Force on Information Literacy for Science and Technology\n\nIntroduction\n\nInformation literacy competency and the purpose of information literacy competency standards are fully described in the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education. This document states (page 4, Section 1:2) that information literacy \"is common to all disciplines, to all learning environments, and to all levels of education.\" Information literacy in science, engineering, and technology disciplines is defined as a set of abilities to identify the need for information, procure the information, evaluate the information and subsequently revise the strategy for obtaining the information, to use the information and to use it in an ethical and legal manner, and to engage in lifelong learning. Information literacy competency is highly important for students in science and engineering/technology disciplines who must access a wide variety of information sources and formats that carry the body of knowledge in their fields. These disciplines are rapidly changing and it is vital to the practicing scientist and engineer that they know how to keep up with new developments and new sources of experimental/research data.\n\nScience, engineering, and technology disciplines pose unique challenges in identifying, evaluating, acquiring and using information. Peer reviewed articles are generally published in more costly journals and, therefore, not always available. Gray literature requires knowledge of the agency/organization publishing the information. Much of science, engineering and technology is now interdisciplinary and, therefore, requires knowledge of information resources in more than one discipline. Information can be in various formats (e.g. multimedia, database, website, data set, patent, Geographic Information System, 3-D technology, open file report, audio/visual, book, graph, map) and, therefore, may often require manipulation and a working knowledge of specialized software.\n\nScience, engineering, and technology disciplines require that students demonstrate competency not only in written assignments and research papers but also in unique areas such as experimentation, laboratory research, and mechanical drawing. Our objective is to provide a set of standards that can be used by science and engineering/technology educators, in the context of their institution's mission, to help guide their information literacy-related instruction and to assess student progress. The field of mathematics is not included in the standards.\n\nBased on the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, five standards and twenty-five performance indicators were developed for information literacy in Science & Engineering/Technology. Each performance indicator is accompanied by one or more outcomes for assessing the progress toward information literacy of students of science and engineering or technology at all levels of higher education.\n\nThis is intended to be a living document with future opportunities for input from the community and will undergo periodic review and revision.\n\nStandard One\n\nThe information literate student determines the nature and extent of the information needed.\n\nPerformance Indicators\n\nThe information literate student:\n\nDefines and articulates the need for information.\n\nOutcomes include that the student:\n\nIdentifies and/or paraphrases a research topic, or other information need such as that resulting from an assigned lab exercise or project.\n\nConsults with instructor/advisor for appropriateness of topic, research project, or laboratory exercise question.\n\nDevelops a hypothesis or thesis statement and formulates questions based on the information need.\n\nExplores general information sources to increase familiarity with current knowledge of the topic.\n\nDefines or modifies the information need to achieve a manageable focus.\n\nIdentifies key concepts and terms that describe the information need.\n\nIdentifies a variety of types and formats of potential sources for information.\n\nOutcomes include that the student:\n\nIdentifies the purpose and audience of potential resources (e.g. popular vs. scholarly, current vs. historical, external vs. internal, primary vs. secondary vs. tertiary).\n\nConsiders experts or other researchers as potential information resources.\n\nIdentifies the value and differences of potential resources in a variety of formats (e.g., multimedia, database, website, data set, patent, Geographic Information Systems, 3-D technology, open file report, audio/visual, book, graph, map).\n\nRealizes that information may need to be constructed with raw data from primary sources or by experimentation.\n\nRecognizes that potentially useful information or data in a variety of formats may be proprietary, have limited access, or may be freely available online.\n\nRecognizes that potentially useful information may require specific data management expertise and that an understanding of the structure of organizations involved in producing the information aids in the identification of that information.\n\nHas a working knowledge of the literature of the field and how it is produced.\n\nOutcomes include that the student:\n\nKnows how scientific, technical, and related information is formally and informally produced, organized, and disseminated.\n\nRecognizes that primary, secondary, and tertiary sources vary in importance and use with each discipline.\n\nIs aware of the professional associations of the field and their literature.\n\nIs knowledgeable of sources that are specific to the field, e.g. manuals, handbooks, patents, standards, material/equipment specifications, current rules and regulations, reference material routinely used in industry, manuals of industrial processes and practices, and product literature.\n\nRecognizes that knowledge can be organized into disciplines and combinations of disciplines (multidisciplinary) that influence the way information is accessed and considers the possibility that the literature of other disciplines may be relevant to the information need.\n\nRecognizes the value of archival information, recognizes how its use and importance may vary with each discipline, and recognizes the importance of preservation of information.\n\nConsiders the costs and benefits of acquiring the needed information.\n\nOutcomes include that the student:\n\nDetermines the availability of needed information and makes decisions on broadening the information seeking process beyond locally held resources.
