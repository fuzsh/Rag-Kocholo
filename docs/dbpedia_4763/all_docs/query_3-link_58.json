        "text": "Anthropology & Aging is the official journal of the Association for Anthropology & Gerontology (AAGE), a nonprofit organization established in 1978 as a multidisciplinary group dedicated to the exploration and understanding of aging within and across the diversity of human cultures.\n\nFeminist Asylum offers asylum to feminists in exile and marginalized feminist works. It welcomes non-conventional academic works, notes on ongoing and/or finished research works, feminist accounts of women’s struggles, commentaries, and diverse/fragmental forms of feminist everyday history-writing. Feminism in exile might manifest in different ways such as exile from nation, exile from society, exile from different social spheres, exile from mind to body, exile from reason to emotions, exile of feminist knowledge practices from academic spaces, to name a few. Asylum on the other hand, hints at the transitivity of knowing through experience, and thus situatedness of knowledge claims.\n\nGA is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal seeking to promote academic work that engages Classicists, Ancient Historians, and Archaeologists in dialogue about global issues, both historical and contemporary. Poverty, war, xenophobia, nationalism, migration, terrorism, imperialism, racism: these are major issues in global history shaped powerfully by the contexts in which they occur. GA publishes original research, book reviews, translations, and commentaries by scholars seeking to understand and illuminate global issues through time, from antiquity to the present day.\n\nNames: A Journal of Onomastics is one of the world’s leading scholarly journals devoted to the study of onomastics. Since the first issue in 1952, this scientific quarterly has published cutting-edge, original articles, notes, and book reviews that investigate the derivation, function, and impact of names and naming in North America and around the world.\n\nPhilosophy of Medicine is an open-access journal that publishes exceptional original philosophical research and perspectives on all aspects of medicine, including medical research and practices. Through its public-facing section The Examination Room, it also publishes content for the wider public, including health professionals and health scientists.\n\nGLPC is an international research initiative investigating the central role played by concepts in Goethe’s development as a philosopher. As a dynamic reference work that will produce more than 300 entries over the next decade, the GLPC will help literary and cultural critics, philosophers, and scholars working in the digital humanities map Goethe’s philosophical heterodoxies.\n\nPUR provides undergraduate students at the University of Pittsburgh with an interdisciplinary, peer-reviewed, online forum to publish their research and creative scholarship. Sponsored by the University Honors College, PUR strives to build an integrative community of undergraduate scholars to showcase the work done under the mentorship of Pitt faculty researchers. Our submissions fall under four categories: research, creative writing, visual arts, and review."
