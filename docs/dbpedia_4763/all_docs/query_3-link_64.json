        "text": "Over the years, thanks to the generosity of our donors, the Strauss Health Sciences Library has received numerous donations of historical medical artifacts. Occasionally, these items arrive without clear descriptions of their purpose or use, necessitating some investigative work. Many of our contemporary medical devices have evolved from these earlier artifacts, and while some designs exhibit recognizable similarities, others do not.\n\nExciting news! To better support open access, CU Anschutz affiliates* get a 10% discount for APCs for publishing in select Elsevier fully gold open access journals. Use the Colorado Alliance's interactive journal finder to see which journals qualify."
