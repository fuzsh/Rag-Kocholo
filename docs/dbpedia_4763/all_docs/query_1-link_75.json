Powers and duties of state librarian.\n\nBack to the Library Law Contents Page\n\n24-90-105.5. Radio reading services.\n\n(1) The general assembly hereby declares that there is a growing need for reading services in Colorado to serve the citizens of the state. The general assembly recognizes that the state has numerous citizens who are blind or visually impaired or who have physical impairments which make the use of printed materials difficult or impossible and further recognizes that the aging of the population of Colorado is increasing the number of such citizens. Because of the need for reading assistance to inform and inspire individuals who cannot use printed materials and because of the unique ability of radio reading services to reach individuals in every corner of the state who require reading services, the general assembly finds that radio reading services should be encouraged and should be made available throughout the state.\n\n(2) In addition to any other powers granted to the state librarian under this article, the state librarian shall have the power with respect to the state library to contract with entities for the furnishing of radio reading services to individuals who are blind or visually impaired or who have physical disabilities which impair their use of printed materials.\n\n(3) The furnishing of radio reading services shall include, but shall not be limited to, the production of reading service radio programs, the broadcast of reading services over a subcarrier frequency, and the provision of radio receivers to listeners for use in receiving reading service broadcasts.\n\n(4) The reading materials for radio reading services shall include, but shall not be limited to, newspapers, periodicals, local calendars of events, consumer information, best seller books, and information concerning pending legislative matters.\n\n5) The general assembly recognizes the importance of privately operated reading services to enable persons who are blind or print-disabled to gain access to otherwise inaccessible print materials. The state librarian has the authority to administer money in the reading services for the blind cash fund, which is created in the state treasury, for the support of privately operated reading services. The fund consists of any public or private money transferred, appropriated, or otherwise credited to the fund. All money credited to the fund and all interest earned on the investment of money in the fund is a part of the fund and must not be transferred or credited to the general fund or to any other fund except as directed by the general assembly acting by bill. The general assembly shall make annual appropriations from the reading services for the blind cash fund to the state librarian to carry out the purposes of this section (5).\n\n(6) The services available through providers of on-demand news and information services to Coloradans who are blind or print-disabled must be expanded to enhance the ability of Coloradans who are blind or print-disabled to use the on-demand information services, and to increase the number of Coloradans who are Blind or print-disabled who are aware of such services. The on-damand news and information services must be expanded to include an enlarged array of information and literacy support services throughout the state, such as the provision of information about a variety of communication-related assistive tehcnologies and blindness-related services, introductory training, and methods to find and use additional resources in or near communities where a person lives. The expanded services may include, but are not limited to:\n\na) information sharing, marketing of expanded services, and other methods for informing persons who are blind or print-disabled about the availability of these services;\n\n(b) support services for users to resolve technical questions about the services or the devices that might be used to access the information available through these services; and\n\n(c) the provision of information about communication-related assistive technologies.\n\nBack to the Library Law Contents Page\n\n24-90-106.

If participation in the county library or library district is to be funded by any amount of tax levy not previously established by resolution or ordinance nor previously approved by the electors, the resolution or ordinance shall state that the electors of the library district or governmental unit must approve that levy before participation can be effected. Written notice of a decision not to participate shall be filed with the board of county commissioners in the case of a proposed county library or with the boards of county commissioners of each county having territory within the library's legal service area in the case of a proposed library district.

If the tax levy imposed by the district pursuant to section 24-90-112 has not been previously approved by the registered electors of the governmental unit, the electors shall approve the levy before the governmental unit may be included in the district.
