        "text": "The Orderline tab values that display for an order are comprehensive. Any value that can be selected in reports is displayed in the orderline, even if the value is not available when the order is created or modified.\n\nThe Display Order wizard is designed so that you can print all of the information associated with an orderline at once using the Print button.\n\nWhen an orderline is created or modified, the similar fields display across the Title Info, Orderline, and Segments tabs. Orderline information is grouped into the following sections. Click the section headings to view the orderline information specific to that section.\n\nâ¢ Bibliographic Info\n\nâ¢ Additional Orderline Information\n\nâ¢ Dates\n\nâ¢ Price and Quantity\n\nâ¢ Quantities Summary\n\nâ¢ Amounts Summary\n\nâ¢ Claims and Cancellations\n\nâ¢ Fundings and Distributions\n\nBibliographic Info\n\nThe Bibliographic Info section contains information about the title in your catalog associated with the particular orderline. If more than one orderline is associated with the order, the title information that displays is associated with the orderline that was selected on the Orderlines tab, before displaying or modifying the orderline.\n\nAside from the call number, material type, and ISBN/ISSN, the information in the Bibliographic Info is supplied based on the entries in the ACQ catalog purpose format synonym list. By default, the following fields appear. Click a field to view its definition.\n\nâ¢ Call Number\n\nâ¢ ISBN/ISSN\n\nâ¢ Material Type\n\nâ¢ Author\n\nâ¢ Title\n\nâ¢ ISBN\n\nâ¢ ISSN\n\nâ¢ Edition\n\nâ¢ Publication Information\n\nFor UNIMARC formats, you will need to modify the ACQ entry list to include the UNIMARC entries for author, title, edition, and publication information.\n\nIf the orderline selected was created using the Skip Item Lookup/Add step, the Bibliographic Info section does not display.\n\nAdditional Orderline Information\n\nAny Additional Orderline Information entries that have been entered appear in this section. The area does not appear if no values were entered in the Additional Orderline Information.\n\nIf the orderline you are displaying was created using the Skip Item Lookup/Add step, the Additional Orderline Information Description field is displayed instead of Bibliographic Info entries. If no data is typed in the DESC field, the Additional Orderline Information heading does not display, and the orderline is unassociated with an object. If neither the Bibliographic Info or Additional Orderline Information is displayed, the orderline may require modification.\n\nDates\n\nBy default, the following fields appear. Click a field to view its definition.\n\nâ¢ Date Ordered\n\nâ¢ Date Mailed\n\nPrice and Quantity\n\nBy default, the following fields appear. Click a field to view its definition.\n\nâ¢ Unit Price\n\nâ¢ Quantity\n\nâ¢ Multi Parts\n\nâ¢ Parts in Set\n\nIf your Enter Requisition in Order Session Setting is selected, the Requisition Number value also appears.\n\nIf your Order in Foreign Currencies Session Setting is selected, the following values also display.\n\nâ¢ Exchange Rate\n\nâ¢ Currency\n\nâ¢ Native\n\nIf your Specify Discount in Order Session Setting is selected, the Discount value also appears.\n\nIf your Enter Requestor ID Session Setting is selected, the following values also display.\n\nâ¢ Requestor User ID\n\nâ¢ Name\n\nIf your Enter Extended Price Session Setting is selected, the Extended Price value also appears.\n\nIf the order is a dated function order type, these additional fields display.\n\nâ¢ Days in Subscription Period\n\nâ¢ Renewal Date\n\nQuantities Summary\n\nBy default, the following fields appear. Click a field to view its definition.\n\nâ¢ Quantity Ordered\n\nâ¢ Quantity Received\n\nâ¢ Quantity Invoiced\n\nâ¢ Quantity Paid\n\nâ¢ Quantity Funded\n\nâ¢ Quantity Loaded\n\nAmounts Summary\n\nBy default, the following fields appear. Click a field to view its definition.\n\nâ¢ Ordered/Not Funded\n\nâ¢ Funded/Not Invoiced\n\nâ¢ Invoiced/Not Paid\n\nâ¢ Amount Paid\n\nClaims and Cancellations\n\nIf any claims or cancellations have been entered on an orderline, either manually, with reports, or automatically from a partial receipt, this information displays above the fundings and distributions orderline in the Claims and Cancellations sections.\n\nOrderline Claiming Information\n\nWhen an order passes its Date to Claim, the Create Late Order Claims report can automatically add a claim segment to the appropriate outstanding line items on that order. SirsiDynix Symphony automatically creates a claim segment if, for a multipart or multicopy line item, some, but not all, of the parts or items are received. You may create a claim segments as well at the workstation.\n\nEach claim segment includes the following fields. Click a field to view its definition.\n\nâ¢ Claim Reason\n\nâ¢ Claim On\n\nâ¢ Claimed Quantity\n\nâ¢ Number of Claims\n\nâ¢ Parts in Set\n\nâ¢ Date Mailed\n\nâ¢ Response\n\nâ¢ Date (Claimed)\n\nâ¢ Status\n\nOrderline Canceling Information\n\nYou may enter a cancel segment when one or more items on a line item must be canceled. The cancel reason identifies the origin of the cancellation as the library, a user, or the vendor. If the cancel reason is VENDOR, then the vendor cycle record is updated with the number of items canceled. Insert the cancel segment directly below the funding and distribution segments affected by the cancellation.\n\nThe funding and distribution segments must be corrected to note which items have been canceled and how many items are still to be funded/distributed.\n\nBy default, the following fields appear. Click a field to view its definition.\n\nâ¢ Cancel Reason\n\nâ¢ Date (Canceled)\n\nâ¢ Parts in Set\n\nâ¢ Canceled Quantity\n\nâ¢ Date Mailed\n\nFundings and Distributions\n\nFundings and Distributions sections contain information about funds, payments, and processing segments of an orderline.\n\nOrderline Funding Information\n\nAlthough the basic funding segment includes the Fund ID and Funded Quantity, the funding segment is also used to identify record payment information. Each funding segment may include the following information.\n\nâ¢ Fund ID\n\nâ¢ Funded Quantity\n\nâ¢ Amount\n\nâ¢ Percent\n\nâ¢ Date Paid\n\nIf the orderline is linked to an invoice, these additional fields display as part of the funding segment.\n\nâ¢ Paid Quantity\n\nâ¢ Amount Invoiced\n\nâ¢ Invoiced Quantity\n\nOrderline Distribution Information\n\nAlthough the basic funding segment includes the Holding Code and Distributed Quantity, a distribution segment may be used by the library in multiple ways to process funded items to their eventual destination. Ordered material may be assigned a library holding code or may be routed to an external agency or user. Distribution segments belong to a funding segment. Several distribution segments can belong to a single funding segment.\n\nThe following fields may display for all types of distributions. Click a field to view its definition.\n\nâ¢ Ship\n\nâ¢ Distributed Quantity\n\nâ¢ Date Received\n\nâ¢ Packing\n\nThere are three kinds of distribution.\n\nâ¢ A Holding Distribution allows you to designate the location to which the items should be distributed. A holding distribution segment contains the following special fields.\n\nâ Holding Code\n\nâ Loaded\n\nâ¢ A User Distribution segment allows you to specify a user ID send the received materials to a designated department or person. A user distribution segment contains the following special fields.\n\nâ Dist User ID\n\nâ Delivered\n\nâ¢ A Volume Distribution segment always belongs to another distribution segment, either User Distribution or Holding Distribution. It allows you to receive partial sets by volume or part name. These distribution segments are typically generated automatically by SirsiDynix Symphony when a partial order of volumes is received. A partial receipt of multipart set can also be noted manually by the entry of a Volume Distribution segment. A volume distribution segment contains only one special field, Parts in Set .\n\nThe following fields are defined for the Orderline tab.\n\nCall Number\n\nThe call number links the current orderline to a title in the catalog. You may type up to 40 characters in this field to identify an existing call number you want associated with this line item. (You can also link to an item ID.) The Call Number and Item ID fields are mutually exclusive. Either a call number or an item ID may be identified, but not both. You may delete an existing call number or item ID to break the link between the current orderline and the title in the catalog. You may type a different call number or item ID to re-link the order to a different title, or leave the order unlinked. Do not unlink/re-link a title and an order unless the Loaded field in the Segments section is set to NEVER.\n\nISBN/ISSN\n\nA standard title ID field, the ISBN/ISSN, displays in orderlines when an orderline is created or modified. The ISBN/ISSN values are provided by default from the corresponding tags in the bibliographic record in the catalog, with the ISBN coming from the 020 and the ISSN coming from the 022. The ISBN is displayed as a 10 character string with no spaces or punctuation. The ISSN is displayed as a pair of four character strings separated by a hyphen.\n\nFor example:\n\nISBN: 0345026713\n\nISSN: 0095-7119\n\nWorkFlows validates ISBNs and ISSNs in orderline records. Anytime you type an ISBN or ISSN that contains invalid characters, or whose digits do not pass the validation calculation as described in the standard for these numbers, WorkFlows displays a warning. However, you are not prevented from saving an invalid ISBN or ISSN to the orderline record.\n\nWhen an orderline is created, the first ISBN or ISSN found in the bibliographic record is inserted in the ISBN/ISSN field according to the following rules. For dated orders, the ISSN will be used first, and the ISBN will be used if no ISSN is available. For all other orders, the ISBN will be used first, and the ISSN will be used if no ISBN is available. For orderlines not linked to the catalog, the ISBN/ISSN field will be empty.\n\nNote: If a title is added for ordering using SmartPort, the ISBN/ISSN is not available in the orderline at the time of creation, although it does display in the orderline when the orderline is later modified.\n\nWhen an order is received, ISBN/ISSN is displayed as Orderline ISXN.\n\nMaterial Type\n\nThis optional field displays the acquisitions material type of the orderline item. The acquisitions material type specifies the itemâs material characteristics. This designation is useful when running reports that select orderlines and orders.\n\nAuthor\n\nThis field contains the itemâs author. This field is cataloged using the 1XX field and can be a personal, corporate, or government name. Added or secondary authors display in 7XX fields.\n\nTitle\n\nTitles related to orderlines may be hyperlinked to more detailed bibliographic, volume, and item information. The information that displays is the same information that prints on the purchase order.\n\nISBN\n\nThe International Standard Book Number (ISBN) consists of 10 digits; the last digit may be an âX.â The digits together represent the language or country of origin, the publisher, and a book identification number. The ISBN, and possibly the price of the book, may be included in the 020 tag of a MARC record. Each volume of a title may have a different ISBNs, but a true reprint will not receive a new ISBN. The equivalent for serial publications is the ISSN.\n\nWorkFlows validates ISBN (020) entries. Anytime you type an ISBN that contains invalid characters, or whose digits do not pass the validation calculation as described in the standard for this number, WorkFlows displays a warning. However, you are not prevented from saving an invalid ISBN to the bibliographic record.\n\nISSN\n\nThe International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) consists of eight digits in two groups of four separated by a hyphen. The last digit may be an âX.â The ISSN is recorded in the 022 tag of a MARC record. The equivalent for monograph publications is the ISBN.\n\nWorkFlows validates ISSN (022) entries. Anytime an ISSN is entered that contains invalid characters, or whose digits do not pass the validation calculation as described in the standard for this number, WorkFlows displays a warning. However, an invalid ISSN is not prevented from being saved to the bibliographic or serial control record.\n\nEdition\n\nThe edition contains information relating to a particular edition of a title. It is recorded in the 250 tag of a MARC record.\n\nPublication Information\n\nThis field contains the publication location, publisher name, and the publication year. To learn more about how this field is cataloged, see Searching by Publication Year.\n\nDate Ordered\n\nThe Date Ordered is the date a particular orderline is added to an order. The date the order was created (Date Created) may be earlier than the date the orderline was created.\n\nDate Mailed\n\nThe Date Mailed field contains the date the completed order was sent to the vendor. The value NEVER is the default on a new order. If the vendor has already been notified of the libraryâs order, this field should be set to a specific date. Typically, the Date Mailed is set to the date a purchase order notice was generated by a purchase order report in which the notice was counted as mailed. This date can also be updated manually, or a default value for Date Mailed (such as TODAY) may be set when using order wizards, or a date may be selected using the Calendar gadget. This default property allows you to consider the order mailed as soon as the order is created, and is useful primarily for libraries that place online or phone orders and do not produce printed purchase orders.\n\nIf your library uses the Print Ready Purchase Orders report, this value should be NEVER for any order that you want to select for printing. NEVER is the default selection and cannot be modified. It is not possible to print a purchase order using this report if the Date Mailed contains a non-NEVER value.\n\nIn the claim segment of an orderline, the Date Mailed is the date that the Vendor Acquisition Claim report was generated for that line with the Count as a Notice Sent option set to Yes. In the cancel segment of an orderline, the Date Mailed is the date that the Print Cancellation Notices report was generated for that line with the Count as a Notice Mailed option set to Yes. Until a notice is generated for a claim or cancellation, the Date Mailed remains NEVER, unless a date is entered manually.\n\nUnit Price\n\nThe Unit Price field contains the price the vendor wants you to pay for the orderline item in the vendorâs currency. It is for only one copy, prior to discount. It does not matter if the unit price is in dollars or in another currency. The application of any TABLE discount by the vendor, any foreign currency exchange rate, and the multiplication by the number entered into the Quantity field occurs automatically to provide the extended price. A Unit Price default value may be entered in the order wizard default properties. If you are entering a unit price, type it without any symbol, such as a dollar sign.\n\nFor example, type 25.00 not $25.00\n\nWhen a standing or blanket recurring order is created or modified, the Unit Price field of the first orderline cannot be modified. These order types represent an open order, for which the initial price may not be known.\n\nQuantity\n\nThis value refers to the number of items of the title or the quantity of supplies that you want to order on this particular orderline. When creating an orderline, if you do not put anything in this field, the default is 1.\n\nMulti Parts\n\nThe Multi Parts check box indicates whether items ordered come in multiple physical parts like volumes. This field is cleared by default, indicating that the line item does not have any accompanying material or is not a set of volumes. If a single copy is, for example, a book/tape/filmstrip combination, select this field. Multiple items of the same single bibliographic entity do not count as multiple parts. Subscriptions do not count as multipart orders. When displayed, Y or N appears instead of the check box.\n\nIn order creation wizards, this field does not display. The accompanying Parts in Set field is all that is needed to indicate a multi-part field.\n\nParts in Set\n\nIf the orderline represents a multi-part work, such as a kit or a set, the part or volume names are recorded this field. When you receive the set, the parts that were received are listed together in a holdings statement in the order record, and the unreceived volumes are listed in a different holdings statement. This allows you to keep track of what volumes you did not receive, if any. Parts in Set can also be used when call number records are created using the Add Ordered Items to Catalog wizard. The special syntax of Parts in Set is used to add analytics to a base call number.\n\nIf available, you may use the Parts in Set Gadget to select the proper parts syntax. If the gadget does not display, type parts according to the syntax defined in FAQs: Typing Orderline Parts.\n\nRequisition Number\n\nMany librariesâ acquisitions processes use a formal purchase request form often needing supervisory approval. If this is a pre-printed, numbered form, the requisition number may be entered in this optional 1â10 character field. The requisition number acts as an alternative access point to this orderline item. The number can be used later if you want to track down the status of various orders originating from a single requisition. You may type alphabetic characters as well as numbers, but they are automatically converted to uppercase letters.\n\nExchange Rate\n\nThis field is used in invoice or orderlines to calculate a foreign currency purchase in native currency. The exchange rate is the number of foreign currency units in a single native currency unit. If the Order in Foreign Currencies field is not selected in Session Settings for acquisitions wizards, this field does not display. The default for Exchange Rate field is TABLE, which references the exchange rate table defined in the Currency policy. As the Currency policy is updated with different exchange rates, the cost of the line item in native currency changes. If you want to freeze the exchange rate so that it does not fluctuate as the Currency policy changes, you may change TABLE to a specific exchange rate. If you are freezing an exchange rate, you must type the value as a decimal, in the form 99.00, instead of a ratio. An exchange rate takes the form 99.00, meaning the number of foreign currency units in a single native currency unit.\n\nFor example, if the price of an item is 25.00, and the currency is Canadian dollars, the amount required in the libraryâs native currency is calculated internally by identifying the Canadian currency in the exchange rate table and applying ratio of foreign units to local United States units to the Canadian price. If the ratio is 150 to 100, the native currency value would be $16.67. If the Currency policy indicates that the foreign policy is 150 per 100 units and you want to freeze that rate, you would type 1.50.\n\nIf the exchange rate at which the order is being invoiced is different from the exchange rate the library ordered under, you may type a different exchange rate directly into this field on the order.\n\nWhen you pay an invoice, this field gives you one last chance to change the exchange rate for this invoice line(s). If the invoice includes a prorated line and you change the exchange rate, the orders and funds affected are updated with a new proration amount based on the new exchange rate.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe currency used to pay the vendor displays in this field. When you order or invoice material, the vendorâs default currency appears. The default currency is the native currency of the vendor, which is specified in the Currency field of the vendor record. If no currency is entered for the vendor, the native currency of your library is the default.\n\nThe vendor currency cannot be changed after orders or invoices have been placed with the vendor, but each orderline may have its own currency specified. However, once an orderline is created using a particular currency, the currency may no longer be modified.\n\nNative\n\nThe currency values are defined by your SirsiDynix Symphony administrator using the Currency wizard in Acquisition Configuration. A Currency policy is created for each of the potential currencies that will be used to pay vendors. Select the Native option check box in only one of the Currency policies; this is the libraryâs native currency.\n\nFor example, a public library in Washington, DC contains materials from several different nations. The library creates currencies for Canadian dollars (CAN), Mexican pesos (PESO), British pounds (UK), etc. Materials are still primarily ordered in the same currency that is used in the country where the library resides. So the native currency of the library is still United States dollars (US). Only the US currency would contain Yes in the Native option, making US the libraryâs native currency.\n\nDiscount\n\nThe Discount field in an order record contains the discount on an item, if any. Valid values for this field are NONE, meaning no discount (0.00 and blank are also accepted for the None value), and TABLE, meaning that the system should use the discount table in the vendor record, or a percentage expressed as a whole number with two decimal places. For example, 15% would be expressed as 15.00. The default value is TABLE.\n\nFor example, if a vendor that typically provides a discount, but does not offer a discount on a certain type of material, such as booksâonâtape, you may change TABLE to 0.00, because the library will not get the vendorâs standard 10% discount.\n\nRequestor User ID\n\nIf this orderline has been ordered at the request of a library patron, you may type the requesting userâs ID. This allows you to track the order easily for the user and notify the user when the material has been ordered and later when the material is available. Or, you may use this field to record the user ID of the library staff selector, the library itself, or, if the order is for supplies, the supervisor who authorized the purchase.\n\nName\n\nThis field contains the userâs name. This value should be in the form last name, first name, then initial, such as Smith, Joe H. The label for this field may be changed by the library.\n\nExtended Price\n\nThe Extended Price field contains the total cost of the line item. It represents the unit price multiplied by the number of items with any discounts figured in the vendorâs currency.\n\nFor example, the library orders two copies of a book from a Japanese publisher with a unit price Y2300. The library gets a 10% discount on all orders. The extended price produced by SirsiDynix Symphony is, therefore, Y4554 (2 x 2300 with a 10% discount).\n\nAfter SirsiDynix Symphony calculates the extended price, you may still change it when modifying an order. If you change the unit price, SirsiDynix Symphony recalculates the extended price. If the vendor cycle record is updated with a different discount table, the extended price of the line item changes.\n\nDays in Subscription Period\n\nThis field represents the period that the subscription (or possibly membership) covers. It is expressed in number of days.\n\nFor example, a single year subscription would cover a 365-day period, so you would type 365 in the Days in Subscription Period field.\n\nNote: The Days in Subscription Period field automatically updates the Renewal Date field in the orderline when the dated order is rolled over to the next fiscal year.\n\nRenewal Date\n\nThe Renewal Date field contains the date that a subscription or membership order is to be renewed. You may use the Calendar gadget to enter a renewal date in your libraryâs format. Typically, the renew date is the order date plus the number of days in the subscription period field.\n\nNote: When rolling over dated orders, the Renewal Date field is used to select which orders are to be rolled over.\n\nQuantity Ordered\n\nIn vendors, this field displays the total number of items ordered for all the vendors or all the cycles. Canceled items and removed line items are automatically deducted from this figure.\n\nQuantity Received\n\nWhen an orderline is displayed individually, this field represents the number of items received for that particular orderline. In a summary, this number is the total for the list of orderlines.\n\nQuantity Invoiced\n\nSirsiDynix Symphony tracks the total number of items entered on invoice records, but not yet paid. If the library does not link invoices to orders, this field remains empty. This field may display for the entire order or a particular orderline. In a summary, this number is the total for the list of orderlines.\n\nQuantity Paid\n\nIn vendors, this field displays the total number of items paid for all the vendors or all the cycles. SirsiDynix Symphony automatically maintains the count as orders are placed, removed, and paid.\n\nQuantity Funded\n\nThis field indicates the total quantity from all funding segments for the order or orderline. When an orderline is displayed individually, this field represents the quantity funded for that particular orderline. In a summary, this number is the total for the list of orderlines.\n\nQuantity Loaded\n\nWhen an orderline is displayed individually, this field represents the items loaded into the catalog for that particular orderline. In a summary, this number is the total for the list of orderlines. This quantity could be updated by either setting the Date Loaded to a value other than NEVER, or by using the Add Ordered Items to Catalog wizard.\n\nOrdered/Not Funded\n\nThis field displays the cost of all ordered items that have not been assigned a fund in the funding segments. When an orderline is displayed individually, this field represents the amount not funded for that particular orderline.\n\nFunded/Not Invoiced\n\nThis field displays the total amount encumbered for funds specified in all the orderlines. When an orderline is displayed individually, this field represents the amount encumbered for that particular orderline.\n\nInvoiced/Not Paid\n\nThis field displays the total amount that the vendor has invoiced for items on this orderline.\n\nAmount Paid\n\nWhen an orderline is displayed individually, this field represents the amount paid for that particular orderline. In a summary, this number is the total for the list of orderlines.\n\nClaim Reason\n\nThe Claim Reason policy value from Acquisition Configuration describes why the item received is wrong, or the circumstances surrounding an expected item that was not received, such as DAMAGED. This field remains blank if you type nothing.\n\nClaim On\n\nThe Claim On field contains the date you are making the claim. You can enter the word TODAY or a date in MM/DD/YYYY form. This date may be modified as necessary. If you do not type text in this field, NEVER is the default. When SirsiDynix Symphony creates claims upon receipt, or through the Create Late Order Claims report, this date is automatically calculated.\n\nClaimed Quantity\n\nIn a claim segment, this Claimed Quantity field contains the quantity claimed for the current claim reason. If one item was damaged and one was the wrong title, you would need two different claim segments, each claiming one item. If you do not type text this field, 0 is the default.\n\nNumber of Claims\n\nSirsiDynix Symphony updates this field with the number of claim notices generated through the Vendor Acquisition Claim report. Until a notice is generated, this field remains 0.\n\nResponse\n\nThis field contains a policy name for a vendor response that briefly describes how the vendor excuses the wrong or missing item, and what the vendor plans to do to satisfy the claim. You may have this information right away if, for example, on a packing slip the vendor specified a list of items that are back-ordered or out of stock. Or, you may receive an explanation by letter or phone. This field remains blank if you type nothing in it.\n\nDate (Claimed)\n\nThis date should be the actual date the issue or copies of the issue are being claimed with the vendor. When creating a claim, you may manually define and insert a date into this field using the Calendar gadget, but a date of NEVER cannot be typed manually into this field. If you do not select a specific date, the date you create the claim will be used as the Date Claimed. When an INSUFFICIENT claim record is created automatically by the system from a partial receipt, or the Prediction As Late report is run to create ISSUELATE claim records, the default date in this field is NEVER. A real date value is automatically entered into this field by the system when either the Serial Claim Notices Report or X12 Serial Claim Transactions Report has been run.\n\nStatus\n\nIn an order claim segment, the status may be OPEN, RECEIVED, or CANCELLED. The default is OPEN.\n\nCancel Reason\n\nThis field contains the origin of the cancellation, which may be either the VENDOR, a USER, or the LIBRARY. When an orderline is canceled because a notice was received from the vendor indicating that the item is no longer available, it is typically a vendor cancellation. When an orderline is canceled because a user to whom it was being distributed no longer needs it, or can no longer afford to pay for it, it is typically a user cancellation. When an orderline is canceled because it will be on backorder too long, or because of a sudden budget cut, it is typically a library cancellation. If the cancel reason is set to VENDOR, then the Copies Canceled field in vendor performance increments appropriately. If you leave this field blank, LIBRARY is the default.\n\nDate (Canceled)\n\nThis field contains the date the cancellation decision was made, or the date the library was notified of the vendorâs inability to supply the specified title or items. The date should be in the form MM/DD/YYYY or the word âTODAY.â If you leave this field blank, NEVER is the default.\n\nWhen a Print Cancellation Notices report is run, the Date Mailed field will be updated. If you do not want to generate a cancellation notice, leave the Date Canceled field as NEVER and type an explanation of the cancellation in the additional line item information text entries.\n\nCanceled Quantity\n\nIn a cancel segment, the Canceled Quantity field contains the number of items canceled for this orderline. If you do not type text this field, 0 is the default.\n\nFund ID\n\nEach master fund record must be assigned a unique identifier. You may modify the master fund recordâs unique ID using this field. The fund ID is basically a short fund name. The maximum length for this field is 20 characters.\n\nNote: Fund IDs must not contain spaces.\n\nâ¢ When Placing OrdersâThe fund ID in each funding segment field identifies the fund from which costs are to be encumbered and paid. For Single Fundings, the required fund ID is assigned to all items. You may modify this field as necessary. For Multiple Fundings, the fund ID field contains the word âMultiple,â not a real fund ID. You may then enter specific fund IDs in subordinate segments added below the Multiple line.\n\nâ¢ When InvoicingâIf an invoice line is linked to an order, this field shows what fund ID is used by the funding. If the line is linked directly to a fund, this field shows the fund ID assigned to the cost of this invoice line. This directly links the invoice to the fund. When an invoice is created, if you do not want to link the invoice link to the fund at the time of creation, you should clear the fund ID.\n\nFunded Quantity\n\nIn a funding segment, this field contains the number of items being funded by the fund account named in the Fund ID field. The full quantity of items ordered for that orderline is the default when creating a new orderline. If additional funding segments are added or if items are canceled, this value must be changed to include only the number of items paid from that fund for the orderline. SirsiDynix Symphony displays the âSEGMENTS NOT CORRECTLY BALANCEDâ warning if each single funding line does not have a distribution segment describing the destination of the items funded.\n\nAmount\n\nWhen working with orders, this field is blank on an unpaid funding segment; otherwise, this field displays the amount paid for each funded item, whether paid through an invoice or directly. The Amount field is also a required field for the amount invoiced for each invoice line, if paying by invoice. When an order is modified, this field only displays if the Pay option is selected. When an order is created, this field only displays if the Prepay option is selected. This value cannot be modified if the orderline is invoiced.\n\nOn an Amount Split funding, the default is REST, meaning all or the balance of the orderline item cost. If you leave the value REST in this field, and press ENTER, SirsiDynix Symphony updates this field with the actual line item price. You can modify this field with that portion of the price that should be assigned to the specified fund.\n\nPercent\n\nIn a Percent Split funding statement, the default is 100, meaning all of the orderline item cost. You may modify this field with that percentage of the price that should be assigned to the specified fund. SirsiDynix Symphony automatically calculates the correct remaining percentage each time you insert a new percent split funding entry.\n\nDate Paid\n\nOn an unpaid funding segment, this field is either blank or contains a default value of NEVER. Otherwise, this field displays the date these funded items were paid, either through an invoice or directly. In an order, this field appears only if the Pay or Prepay option is selected. It cannot be modified if this orderline is invoiced.\n\nThe Date Paid is entered on an invoice when Pay Invoice is used, and displays the date the invoice and any linked records should be marked as paid. This default is to TODAY, but you may change this to any MM/DD/YYYY date or select NEVER from the if payment is not ready yet.\n\nPaid Quantity\n\nThe Paid Quantity field contains the number of items invoiced and paid for that particular orderline.\n\nAmount Invoiced\n\nIf this orderline is invoiced, this field displays the amount the vendor has invoiced the library. This may be different from the encumbered cost of the order. Once the entire amount invoiced is paid, this field is blank, or $0.00.\n\nInvoiced Quantity\n\nIf this order is invoiced, this field displays the number of invoiced items. This may be different from the number of funded copies. Once all the invoiced items are paid, this field is blank.\n\nShip\n\nThis field may be used to specify shipping instructions that are printed on the purchase order notice. A message, the name and address of the library or user, and notice text other than the purchase order text may be included based on the libraryâs Shipping policies. The Shipping policy entered in the Ship field refers only to the item(s) in this distribution segment. If a holding distribution is specified, the user record of the library for which the material is ordered is used to supply name and address information. If a user distribution is specified, the user record is used.\n\nDistributed Quantity\n\nIn a distribution segment, the Distributed Quantity field contains the number of items (quantity) associated with this holding code or user distribution.\n\nDate Received\n\nIn a distribution segment, this field contains the date that the specified number of items were received. You may select the word âTODAYâ or âNEVER,â or type any date in the correct format. When this field is set to anything but NEVER (or blank) the line item is marked as received.\n\nWhen this default property is set to TODAY in the Receive Orders wizard, the current date is always automatically assigned as the date received for each list of receipts. When this property is not set to TODAY, the date received must be assigned in the first step of the wizard. If a specific date or NEVER is entered into the default field, that is the default value displayed in the first step. However, if the TODAY default is cleared, TODAY is still the default value that displays, but you have the option to change the value.\n\nNote: The first step of the wizard displays only if this property contains a value other than TODAY (or the Auto-generate Packing List Numbers behavior property is cleared).\n\nPacking\n\nThe vendor packing list number or name goes in this optional 1â20 character field. The packing list may have a number in some vendor scheme, but if it doesnât, SirsiDynix Symphony can generate a unique number automatically if AUTO is selected for this field when an order is received. You may display all items that arrived in the same shipment (on the same packing list). This field remains blank if the Date Received field contains NEVER.\n\nHolding Code\n\nOn the Fundings and Distributions tab, selecting a holding code designates holding characteristics to be assigned to the item when you load the line item in the catalog. A Holding Code policy can define the owning library, the item type, the location, the item categories, permanence, and circulating permissions. The default holding code that automatically displays in this field may be set in the wizardâs properties. The orderline may be distributed to more than one holding code using the tab tools.\n\nWhen orderlines are loaded into the catalog with the Add Ordered Items to Catalog wizard, the holding code assigned to the holding distribution segment at the time the item is ordered appears. Cataloging staff have the option to use the to select a more appropriate holding code for each distribution before loading them into the catalog.\n\nLoaded\n\nThis field is used to note the date that this holding distribution was loaded into the catalog. When this field is set to anything but NEVER, the line item is marked as loaded into the catalog. If all items are loaded, then the ON ORDER message disappears from the catalog.\n\nSetting this date does not add call number and item holdings to the catalog. Changing the date loaded from NEVER to a real date only marks a distribution segment as âclosedâ so the catalog no longer displays the ON ORDER message. You can reopen the order by setting the Loaded field back to NEVER.\n\nDist User ID\n\nThe Dist User ID field contains a user ID that designates a user or department (with an associated user ID) to whom the library will distribute the items. This field displays when a User Distribution (USER_DISTRIBUTION) segment is inserted into an orderline.\n\nDelivered\n\nThis field is used to note the date that this user distribution was marked as delivered to the user. When this field is set to anything but NEVER, and the record is updated, the line item is marked as delivered to the user. If all items are delivered, then no open distributions appears in the user record. You can reopen the order by setting the Delivered field back to NEVER."
