        "text": "for the degree of Master of Science in Library & Information Science (on campus & online)\n\nThe MS in LIS is accredited by the American Library Association (ALA). Two scheduling options are available to students pursuing the MS degree.\n\nOn-campus or Online\n\nThe on-campus option serves students who are in residence at Urbana-Champaign, as well as part-time, commuting students. The online scheduling option is an online education option that uses the Internet and other information technologies for delivery.\n\nA thesis is not required but is available as an option. Students prepare for careers in all types of information organizations. Examples of the professional positions graduates hold include: Internet trainer, webmaster, and knowledge manager, as well as work in reference, automated systems, cataloging, youth services, school media, and other positions in public, academic, school, and special libraries.\n\nThe School of Information Sciences (iSchool) offers programs of study leading to the Master of Science (M.S.), the Certificate of Advanced Study (C.A.S), and the Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Three Master of Science (M.S.) degrees are available. The M.S. in Library and Information Science (L.I.S.) prepares students for professional careers in all types of information organizations, including libraries. The M.S. in Information Management (I.M.) will prepare the students for information-intensive professional roles in a broad range of sectors. The Library and Information Sciences concentration of the campus-wide M.S. in bioinformatics program emphasizes multidisciplinary skills that are required for a career developing and managing information systems for the biological sciences community. The C.A.S. program provides the opportunity\n\nto study an aspect of information sciences in greater depth than is possible in the M.S. program,\n\nto refresh and upgrade one's professional training several years after completing a M.S. program, or\n\nto redirect one's career into a different area of library and information science.\n\nSchool Librarian Licensure is available in conjunction with both the M.S. in L.I.S. and C.A.S. The Ph.D. is a research degree program.\n\nAdmission\n\nThe general admission requirements of the Graduate College apply. Consideration is also given to language study and computer skills, relevant work experience, letters of reference, and evidence of leadership. International students must score at least 620 on the paper-based Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) (260 on the computer-based test; 104 on the iBT version); or 7 on each section of the IELTS. The M.S. in bioinformatics requires a strong background in information science including undergraduate-level computing and mathematics. The C.A.S. requires a master's degree in library and information science and a grade point average of at least 3.0 (A = 4.0) in the master's program.\n\nSchool Librarian Licensure\n\nCandidates interested in the School Librarian Licensure program must first be admitted and enrolled as a degree-seeking student within the School of Information Sciences before their application to the School Librarian Licensure program is reviewed. Accepted students must successfully pass two Illinois State Board of Education testing requirements prior to registration for the final fieldwork experience.\n\nGraduate Teaching Experience\n\nAlthough teaching is not a general Graduate College requirement, experience in teaching is considered an important part of the graduate experience in the Ph.D. program for those interested in faculty careers.\n\nFacilities and Resources\n\nAmong the major areas of faculty research are:\n\ncommunity informatics\n\ndata analytics\n\ndata curation\n\ndigital humanities\n\ndigital libraries\n\nhistory of information\n\ninformation retrieval\n\norganization of knowledge and information\n\nprivacy, security, and trust\n\nethics and values for information\n\nyouth literature, culture, and services\n\nThe iSchool's Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS) conducts research on information problems that impact scientific and scholarly inquiry. The Center for Children's Books (CCB) provides a review and research collection of the newest literature for children and young adults. The Communications Office produces two high-quality publications, Library Trends and The Bulletin of the Center for Childrenâ€™s Books. The staff of each of these units is available to students and faculty for consultation and guidance. A computer network with Internet connectivity is integral to teaching and learning activities. The University Library provides a vast reservoir of resources for all types of study and research in library and information science.\n\nThe School maintains an ongoing commitment to continuing education through conferences, institutes, workshops, and course offerings."
