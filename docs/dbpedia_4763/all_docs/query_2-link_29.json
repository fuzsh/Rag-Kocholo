For example, a search on 'sprin*' will return spring, Springer, springs, sprint, sprints, sprinted, etc., anywhere in the field searched. The asterisk may not be used as the first character of a search.\n\n? (question mark) is the wildcard that replaces a specific character in a search term. For example, a search on 'basi?' will return basic and basis, but will not find the plural cases of these words or words that start with these letters.\n\n~ (tilde) is the wildcard that can be used at the end of a word to match similar terms.
