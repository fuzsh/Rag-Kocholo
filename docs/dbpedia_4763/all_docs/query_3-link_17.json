Abstract: Ever since the libraries came to being, subject access has had been a problem. More often than not, subject searches result either in no retrievals or too many records, discouraging users to proceed further. Solutions to these problems were found in improving search methods, indexing techniques, developing user-friendly novel interfaces and other methods. \"The present work attempts to tackle the problems of subject access using an experimental online catalogue by designing a graphic front end user interface, wherein an enhanced indexing technique that is traditional classification system coupled with improved search method by providing end user thesaurus were incorporated by using Macintosh compatible software package called FileMaker Pro. The system provides subject access by three methods i.e. Class Number Search (CNS), Subject Heading Search (SHS) and Keyword Search (KWS) to cater to the needs of two different levels of users i.e. naive or ordinary level and another for the experienced or advanced level users. A cross section of the searchers were invited to evaluate the interface. On the basis of their reactions, certain recommendations were made for the improvement of the system. In the process the capabilities and limitations of FileMaker Pro were assessed and suggestions were given for its further improvement. Certain points pertaining to the further research on the subject were also recommended.\n\nStatement of International Cataloguing Principles (ICP)\n\nResource Description and Access (RDA) - including RDA Frequently Asked Questions\n\n3R Project Frequently Asked Questions - The RDA Toolkit Restructure and Redesign (3R) Project\n\nRDA Bibliography - Articles, Books, Presentations, Thesis, and Videos on Resource Description and Access (RDA) and Cataloging\n\nYour Browser doen't support for Iframe !\n\nLibrary of Congress Classification\n\nLibrary of Congress Discontinues NACO Literary Author Number Program (July 1, 2018) - All works by or about an individual literary author are generally classified together in the same number or span of numbers in class P, although multiple numbers or spans of numbers may be established for authors who write in more than one language. To allow for a high level of consistency, the classification number assigned to an author may be recorded in the author’s name authority record. In the past, the Library of Congress has accepted suggestions for literary author numbers from NACO members; those suggestions would be reviewed by LC staff and included in the name authority record as “LC‐verified.” The program by which NACO members could suggest literary author numbers to LC has been discontinued.\n\nLibrary of Congress Classification training materials in OCLC WebJunction Course Catalog - the presently available courses and webinars are listed below:\n\nLibrary of Congress Classification (LCC): Intermediate (Webinar - Self enrollment) - This session will focus on the selection and construction of LC Classification (LCC) call numbers for literature, maps and atlases, and moving images, including the construction of cutters for literary works and juvenile belle lettres.\n\nLibrary of Congress Classification (LCC): Introduction (Webinar - Self enrollment) - This session will briefly introduce the history of LC Classification (LCC) and the general principles of classification.
