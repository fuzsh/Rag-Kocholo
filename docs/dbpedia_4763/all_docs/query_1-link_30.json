Curricula vary by program, institution, and degree level. For example, associate degrees prepare learners for roles as library assistants and technicians, while bachelor’s programs train individuals to work in entry-level librarian positions. Certificate programs in library science also build the foundational skills relevant for library settings.\n\nTo become an actual librarian, individuals usually need a graduate degree in library and information science. Online master’s degrees in library science covers advanced aspects of library operations, information management, and information studies. Doctorates in library science allows students to specialize in areas like leadership, curation, archives, or health information and education.\n\nWe explore these degrees and programs in more detail below.\n\nCertificate Program in Library Science\n\nA certificate in library science is an entry into the library and information science profession. Certificate programs usually last between one semester and two years, covering fundamental information about the tools and techniques librarians use.\n\nWith a certificate in library science, graduates can become library assistants at public, private, and school libraries. A certificate in library science can also lead to careers in data entry, research, and material collection at businesses and nonprofit organizations.\n\nAssociate Degree in Library Science\n\nAssociate degrees in library science usually take two years of full-time study. Learners complete general education coursework in English, the humanities, and natural sciences alongside introductory classes in library and information sciences. An associate degree in this field can lead to entry-level roles or set the foundation for continued study in a bachelor’s program.\n\nA library science associate program can benefit students already working in a library by qualifying them for more specialized roles. With this educational credential, professionals can become library assistants, research technicians, and curatorial aides.\n\nBachelor’s Degree in Library Science\n\nA bachelor’s in library science — which typically takes four years of full-time study — incorporates general education coursework with library and information science fundamentals. Students study cataloging and technical processes, library management, and information literacy as they work toward a career in a library setting. Classes may also include information technology, literary studies, and research methods.\n\nA bachelor’s degree in library science prepares learners to become library assistants, data curators, and research technicians. With a bachelor’s degree in this discipline, individuals can also pursue a graduate program in library and information science. A master’s degree in library science is the standard level of education required for professional librarians.\n\nMaster’s Degree in Library Science\n\nCoursework in a master’s degree in library science builds on library and information science fundamentals with specialized coursework. Students explore advanced aspects of library management, operations, and information science. Often, programs include concentrations that let learners specialize their knowledge in fields like youth library services, digital media, information architecture, and archival records management.\n\nTo pursue a master’s degree in library science, students usually need a bachelor’s degree. Graduates can qualify for jobs like librarian, archivist, and library director — many libraries require a library science master’s degree as a minimum for these roles.\n\nDoctoral Degree in Library Science\n\nA doctorate in library science can lead to advanced careers in academic and archival settings. Professionals with a doctoral degree in library science can find work as library directors, college and university instructors, and data managers.\n\nTypically, learners finish these programs in 3-5 years. The curricula for Ph.D.s in library science blend lecture and research coursework, often incorporating practical experience and teaching. Doctoral students also conduct research and produce dissertations about niche subfields of library and information science.\n\nAccreditation for Library Science Programs\n\nBefore choosing a program, students should consider the accreditation status of a library science degree. Library science students should only consider schools with active, valid institutional accreditation.\n\nIndividual degrees can also hold programmatic accreditation. The accrediting body for library science is the American Library Association (ALA). Accreditation from ALA is a voluntary process that involves self- and peer evaluation of curricula, instruction, and program outcomes. Librarian jobs and other advanced roles typically require an ALA-accredited library science master’s degree.\n\nPaying for a Library Science Degree\n\nCollege can be expensive, especially since costs keep rising. The National Center for Education Statistics reported the following nationwide average tuition rates for the 2021-22 school year:\n\nTwo-year degree (in-state public institution): $3,564\n\nFour-year degree (in-state public institution): $9,596\n\nFour-year degree (out-of-state public institution): $27,457\n\nFour-year degree (private nonprofit institution): $34,041\n\nGraduate school (overall average among public and private institutions): $20,513\n\nFor students who need help paying for their degrees, research financial aid options. Generally, you should prioritize funding sources like scholarships and grants, as these do not require repayment, while loans typically require repayment with interest.\n\nFill out your FAFSA application to determine your eligibility for financial aid. A filed FAFSA means you receive automatic consideration for the federal student funding programs for which you qualify, including grants and loans. We explore financial aid below.\n\nScholarships\n\nScholarships deliver one-time or renewable awards in the form of direct financial aid. Schools and organizations award scholarships on the basis of need, merit, or demographics. Winners don’t repay the funds they receive, which means scholarships can be competitive.\n\nALA’s scholarship program offers financial support to underrepresented groups and other qualified students in need of aid. ALA also maintains a directory of agencies and organizations that provide aid to library science program enrollees.\n\nGrants\n\nGrants are similar to scholarships, though they emphasize financial need more heavily. While grants specifically for library science students are rare, the Institute of Museum and Library Services runs funding programs specifically for indigenous, Black, and Latino/a applicants.\n\nFederal Loans\n\nIf scholarships, grants, gifts, and savings aren’t enough to meet your education expenses, consider federal student loans. Generally, all loans require repayment, but federal loans usually offer lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options than private loans.\n\nPrivate Loans\n\nAs a last resort, look into student loans from private lenders. These are especially useful if you’re an international student and you don’t qualify for federal aid from the U.S. government. To reduce your debt, review all terms and conditions of loans closely, and keep your borrowing to a minimum.\n\nJobs for Library Science Graduates\n\nSalaries for workers with library science degrees vary by career, education level, and location.
