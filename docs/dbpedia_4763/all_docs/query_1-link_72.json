The curriculum offers an overview of book arts as a basis for the integration of material book studies into outside areas of study and/or creative specializations. As a complement to a primary field of study, the minor provides the background necessary to begin to produce and critically examine creative book work within a historical context and contemporary framework. Please see the undergraduate catalog for more information about the minor.\n\nAs information technologies such as social media, artificial intelligence (AI), and interactive media have moved from the periphery to center stage, there is increased need for professionals who can accurately assess their impact and realize their potential to enhance our lives, work, and well-being. The Informatics minor approaches information technology from a user-centered perspective with a focus on the analysis and design of socio-technical systems that store, process, and communicate information. The Informatics minor is designed for students who are interested in assessing information technology impacts and designing information structures and technology to solve complex social and organizational problems. The Informatics minor provides students with a curriculum that combines foundational knowledge and practical skills. Please see the undergraduate catalog for more information about this minor.\n\nSLIS is building a new undergraduate major – a B.S. in Informatics.

We value your experiences and perspectives in furthering the mission of our school, and we offer a variety of ways for you to stay involved after graduation or give back later in your career.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of the School of Library and Information Studies (SLIS) began in 1929 when the university instituted an academic program in school librarianship within the College of Education. In the 1960s, leaders of the Alabama Library Association sought to establish in Tuscaloosa a general purpose graduate school of library service. An Alabama Senate joint resolution in 1969 authorized the Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama to establish the Graduate School of Library Service. Students were first accepted in 1970. SLIS’s founding dean, Dr. James D. Ramer, was appointed in 1971 to develop the curriculum, recruit faculty and students, and plan for the school’s quarters. In 1972, the Graduate School of Library Service received full accreditation of its Master of Library Service (MLS) degree program from the American Library Association.\n\nIn the intervening years, the school pursued a mission to provide students with skills and knowledge required to meet the information needs of a diverse population. It also grew substantially. In 1985, the school began to offer a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree through its Book Arts program, including specializations in printing and binding. Since then the MFA program in The Book Arts has established itself as an international leader in the field.\n\nIn 1988, faculty member Dr. Philip M. Turner was selected to serve as the school’s second dean. The PhD program was first offered by the school in 1988, and, one year later, the school was renamed the School of Library and Information Studies, reflecting the increasing academic and professional emphasis on emerging technologies. Early in 1997, SLIS programs were merged into the renamed College of Communication and Information Sciences. At this point, Dr. Joan Atkinson became director of the school.\n\nIn 2003, Dr. Elizabeth Aversa was named director of the school, and by 2005, under her leadership, SLIS launched a fully online, synchronous distance education MLIS program, one of the forerunners in the nation. The first class had forty-three students, representing Alabama and 14 other states. Over the next three years, SLIS moved up eight places in the US News national rankings for Library and Information Studies programs from 30th position to 22nd.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, Dr. Heidi Julien served as director, and under her leadership, the SLIS research mission was re-charged and several international initiatives were developed. By 2013, the program made another jump in the US News rankings, up to 18th position. Under the leadership of Dr. Ann Prentice (2014-2017), SLIS continued its academic tradition of preparing the next generation of library and information professionals and formalized its archival program with a specialization and certificate. Later in August 2017, Dr. Jim Elmborg became SLIS’s director and lead the school in starting the SLIS EBSCO Scholars Program in audio-visual preservation and archiving. In Fall 2021, Dr. Jamie Campbell Naidoo took over leadership of SLIS where the program continues to prepare professionals specializing in the creation and stewardship of traditional and emergent forms of information, while also demonstrating a strong commitment to intellectual freedom, access to all, and the tenets of social justice. Presently, we are planning new minors in Informatics and Book Arts, as well as a full major in Informatics and a Graduate Certificate in Youth Services.\n\nSLIS Listservs\n\nSLIS has a variety of listservs to keep our students, alumni, and the profession connected.\n\nSLIS-A\n\nThe Friends of UA SLIS Network is a community of alumni, current students, faculty, and supporters of UA SLIS.
