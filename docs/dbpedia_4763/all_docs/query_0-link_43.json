Read More Mega journals are growing rapidly, and nowadays, they have become new portals for the publication of scientific outputs. The purpose of this study is to analyze the citations of the scientific outputs of Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in eight mega journals. This applied research, which is a descriptive-analytical study, was conducted by employing a scientometric approach. In this study, eight mega journals were identified and selected based on Bjork's criteria. In each journal, the studies conducted by the researchers of selected countries of the Middle East, and indexed in the Scopus database were searched and extracted from the time the journal was launched as a mega journal to the end of 2019. The total number of studies imported to Excel, SPSS, and VosViewer software for analysis and illustration of the data was 10935. The results showed that approximately 84 percent of the studies performed by the researchers of the selected countries were published in PLOS ONE and Scientific Reports, and the share of the publication for the other six journals accounted for only six percent of the articles. Of the 262696 citations received by these articles, 57.86 percent belonged to the studies published in PLOS ONE. Moreover, PLOS ONE and Scientific Reports were among the most cited sources of the studies carried out in the Middle East. The most active institutes of the Middle East in the eight selected mega journals were Tel Aviv University, King Saud University, Cairo University, and Tehran University of Medical Sciences, respectively. Most of the international collaborations of the selected countries for publication of studies were with the researchers of Medical Sciences of the USA, the UK, and Germany. A considerable share of publications of the selected Middle East countries in the mega journals belonged to PLOS ONE and Scientific Reports. Although the trend of publication in the other journals is also rising, they are not comparable with those two journals. As conducting international studies could increase the rate of citations, it is recommended that researchers increase the impact of their publications via international collaboration.\n\nView Article\n\nPDF 517.77 K\n\nCitation Analysis\n\nCitation Analysis of Review Studies on Iranian Retracted Articles in Medical and Health Sciences in Scopus\n\nShiva Malgard; Shahram Sedghi; Shadi Asadzandi\n\nVolume 22, Issue 3 , July 2024, Pages 19-37\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.22034/ijism.2024.1998765.1074\n\nAbstract\n\nThe present study examined review articles in medical sciences and analyzed their citations of retracted Iranian papers.

Read More The present study examined review articles in medical sciences and analyzed their citations of retracted Iranian papers. This was a quantitative and applied study using scientometrics and descriptive cross-sectional approaches. Review articles' citation trends of retracted studies were investigated using the quantitative method, and the status of the mentioned citations was determined using the descriptive method. The study population comprised 53 review studies that cited 28 retracted Iranian articles. The current study on review articles citing retracted papers revealed that most citations in 2019 were in the form of systematic reviews and meta-analyses by Iranian authors. These articles were occasionally published in journals with a high credibility and impact factor. Although the most frequent reasons for article retraction in the present study were scientific misconduct, most of the citing review articles did not mention this issue. Further research is required to determine the impact of referencing retracted articles on the results of review articles, especially systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized clinical trials (RCTs), regarding the reasons for retraction.\n\nView Article\n\nPDF 525.75 K\n\nSocial Networks\n\nExploring Social Networks and Conceptual Structure in Accounting Research: A Study of Scientific Collaboration and Word Co-occurrence\n\nAmeneh Maleki; Zahra Dianiti Deilami; Davoud Haseli\n\nVolume 22, Issue 3 , July 2024, Pages 39-61\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.22034/ijism.2024.2005663.1163\n\nAbstract\n\nThis research analyzed the accounting field's scientific collaboration network and conceptual structure.

Read More This research analyzed the accounting field's scientific collaboration network and conceptual structure. All documents published in core accounting journals from 2006-2022 in Scopus with over 9 citations were examined. Scientific collaboration and co-occurrence networks were analyzed and visualized using VOSviewer software. The publishing of accounting documents is primarily led by three major countries: The United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Authors and institutions from these nations actively contribute to the publications in this field. Additionally, recent studies have shown a notable rise in research output in accounting from Malaysia, Germany, China, Italy, and Indonesia. The word co-occurrence revealed six subject areas within the field of accounting. These areas encompass emerging accounting and management control trends, financial reporting and market dynamics, sustainability reporting, corporate social responsibility, international financial reporting standards and accounting regulation, corporate governance, and firm performance, and audit quality and assurance. By tracking significant developments in accounting research, it becomes evident that the discipline has evolved from establishing foundational concepts and practices to focusing on financial reporting, auditing, corporate governance, international accounting, social and environmental considerations, technology integration, and specialized areas of interest.\n\nView Article\n\nPDF 1.21 M\n\nScientometrics\n\nFaculty Members’ Performance Appraisal System: A Bibliometric Analysis of the Scientific Literature\n\nElmira Janavi; Sadjedeh Abdi\n\nVolume 22, Issue 3 , July 2024, Pages 63-83\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.22034/ijism.2024.2013962.1281\n\nAbstract\n\nAbstractDeciding upon faculty members’ promotion or tenure is one of the most important tasks in higher education, and it has piqued the interest of researchers from different fields.

Read More AbstractDeciding upon faculty members’ promotion or tenure is one of the most important tasks in higher education, and it has piqued the interest of researchers from different fields. This has led to an increased number of deep studies in recent years and resulted in an increasing publication growth rate. So, it seems essential that a comprehensive analytical study be done in this field with a bibliometrics approach aiming to identify research trends and patterns in the field of faculty members’ appraisal systems. The Web of Science was utilized for data collection through a search process on August 2, 2022, in which terms related to promotion, evaluation, and faculty members were searched in the topic section of all databases. By identifying research evolution (word and thematic evolution), core journals (Scientometrics), active countries (USA, United Kingdom, and China), types of research collaboration, and leading institutions in this field, policymakers can gain insights into the current state of research in this area and make informed decisions about future directions for faculty evaluations. Policymakers can use the study's findings to identify which institutions are leading the way in faculty appraisal research and collaborate with them to share best practices. Thematic mapping also allows for the identification of emerging research areas and helps researchers develop effective research strategies. Overall, this study's findings can help universities and policymakers develop more evidence-based and effective faculty member evaluation policies that promote academic excellence and contribute to the overall success of higher education institutions.\n\nView Article\n\nPDF 887.24 K\n\nLibrary and Information Science\n\nAnalyzing Review Studies and Bibliometrics of University-Industry Interaction Using Scoping Review1\n\nFarzaneh Ghanadinezhad; Mohammad Reza Ghane\n\nVolume 22, Issue 3 , July 2024, Pages 85-110\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.22034/ijism.2024.2022906.1400\n\nAbstract\n\nWith the increase of studies in the field of university-industry cooperation, the need to integrate studies that have investigated the research process of this interaction has become more apparent.

Read More With the increase of studies in the field of university-industry cooperation, the need to integrate studies that have investigated the research process of this interaction has become more apparent. In this regard, the present research analyzed the review and bibliometric studies of the interaction between university and industry using a scoping review. The guide provided by Daudt, Van Mossel and Scott (2013) is the basis for conducting the scoping review. We used international databases, and 2,590 articles were retrieved. After sampling based on the PRISMA diagram and using the JBI institute for the quality of the selected sources, 64 articles were selected for the final analysis. A review of studies analyzing university-industry interaction showed that research publications in this field have grown despite random fluctuations. Various factors account for the growth of studies in this field, including transforming the missions and activities of universities by moving towards entrepreneurship and commercialization of research and the formation of entrepreneurial universities, increasing technology transfer offices, the growth of inventions in universities, and expanding research collaborations. The most crucial obstacle to university-industry alliances is the difference in their goals and missions. Intermediary institutions, especially science parks, and incubators, are essential for effective communication between universities and industry. Some of the most critical topics in University-Industry Interaction are innovation, economic development, sustainable development, science parks and incubators, start-ups, spin-offs, knowledge transfer, technology transfer, entrepreneurship, and research commercialization.\n\nView Article\n\nPDF 680.67 K\n\nLibrary Services in the Context of Modern Requirements of Information Society\n\nLidiya Kurmysheva; Evgeniya Pshenichnaya\n\nVolume 22, Issue 3 , July 2024, Pages 111-122\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.22034/ijism.2024.1977908.0\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study considers a wide range of services provided by the largest Russian and foreign to their users.

To meet this end, a survey approach was employed, and a questionnaire was used to collect the data. The statistical sample size was determined as 95 librarians from Tehran University, 48 librarians from Allameh Tabataba’i University, and 35 librarians from Tarbiat Modares University. According to the results, the respondents believe that the main problems for implementing RDA in academic libraries in Iran are, in turn: “problems in switching to new library software\", \"problems of not having enough information and knowledge to implement RDA\", \"problems in the internal communication of libraries\", \"data incompatibility\", \"lack of a trustee to apply the RDA rules\", and \"problem with library users\". Therefore, using a correspondence table and designing a comprehensive manual in library software is needed to guide the librarians and catalogers in implementing RDA.\n\nView Article\n\nPDF 306.57 K\n\nLibrary and Information Science\n\nUse of Reference Management Software among Students: Experiences from Ghana’s Technical Universities\n\nDonus W.

Further, it sought to determine the role of training and support in using Reference Management Software in the two technical universities selected for the study. The explanatory sequential design was used for this study. Data was collected purposively from Accra Technical University, and convenience sampling was used for Takoradi Technical University. 210 copies of the questionnaire were distributed to final-year Bachelor of Technology students from both universities. Interviews were conducted with six information literacy instructors in both institutions. From the findings, Mendeley was the most used Reference Management Software among students of the two universities; Accra Technical University students were more aware of Reference Management Software than Takoradi Technical University students; Accra Technical University students used Reference Management Software more and were more confident in its usage than Takoradi Technical University students; but had challenges that were more fundamental than Takoradi Technical University such as inadequate basic infrastructure for training and support. From the results, training, and support rendered to students in Accra Technical University had a bearing on their awareness and usage of Reference Management Software.

It is applied research in terms of purpose and correlation-descriptive research in terms of the data collection method. The research statistical population included all library and information science experts in Mashhad city, which were selected as research samples using random sampling. The questionnaire was used as a data collection tool. The average variance extracted (AVE) was used to assess the validity of the questionnaire, and the composite reliability (CR) coefficient and Cronbach's alpha coefficient were used to assess the reliability of the questionnaire. The structural equation modeling method (partial least squares method) was used with Smart PLS software to test the research hypotheses and the research conceptual model. According to the results, it can be stated that the variable of organizational maturity has a significant and positive effect on the components of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, including performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, purposeful behavior, but this variable does not have a significant and positive effect on the effort expectancy. Organizational maturity affects the acceptance and use of technology by public library librarians.\n\nView Article\n\nPDF 532.21 K\n\nLibrary and Information Science\n\nOnline Voluntary Activities at Public Libraries: Identification and Classification\n\nHassan Behzadi; Marzieh Golabian Moghadam; Azar Khabiri; Fatemeh Shafiee Neizar\n\nVolume 22, Issue 3 , July 2024, Pages 211-232\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.22034/ijism.2024.2003351.1125\n\nAbstract\n\nDevelopments in information and communication technologies have created a new type of voluntary activity called online volunteering, in which volunteers fulfill their duties from outside the workplace.

Read More Developments in information and communication technologies have created a new type of voluntary activity called online volunteering, in which volunteers fulfill their duties from outside the workplace. Therefore, this study aims to identify and categorize online voluntary activities available to public libraries and information centers. This applied research was conducted using the survey method. Data collection was performed using observation and Delphi method. The participants in the Delphi survey rounds included 15 experts in the field of information and knowledge science (faculty members, library managers, and library sections' directors) who were interviewed in two rounds, and their opinions were used to conclude. The present study's findings suggest that 33 different voluntary activities can be performed as virtual volunteering in public libraries. These services can be divided into three general categories: content development, training/counseling, and promoting/informing. Among these, content development with 22 different activities has the most possibility of online volunteering activities, training/counseling with six activities, and promoting/informing with five activities are the following categories, respectively. In addition, for each of these three categories, relevant general competencies are presented separately, while for 33 voluntary activities, specialized goals and competencies are suggested by experts. Considering the variety of activities that public libraries can perform virtually through their volunteers, it seems necessary to identify the capacities and capabilities of libraries and volunteers so that the maximum efficiency of volunteers is achieved in reaching the library's goals. No study on identifying and categorizing voluntary activities in public libraries and information centers is available. While identifying and categorizing these activities, the present research mentions the goals for each activity and specifies general and specialized conditions for volunteers to perform the same activity.\n\nView Article\n\nPDF 418.02 K\n\nLibrary and Information Science\n\nThe Relationship between Media Literacy and the Ability to Detect Fake News in COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nZohre Azizi\n\nVolume 22, Issue 3 , July 2024, Pages 233-245\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.22034/ijism.2024.1999655.1086\n\nAbstract\n\nFollowing the increase of false news about the COVID-19 disease and the psychological and social effects that have resulted, detecting fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the critical things that can be effective in this field.

Read More Following the increase of false news about the COVID-19 disease and the psychological and social effects that have resulted, detecting fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the critical things that can be effective in this field. Therefore, the current study investigated the relationship and role of media literacy in predicting students' ability to detect fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research was applied using a descriptive survey method. The statistical population of this research consists of all the students of Razi University; 371 students were selected as the sample population by stratified random sampling. A standard media literacy questionnaire with 20 questions was used to collect data and a researcher-made questionnaire on the ability to detect fake news in the COVID-19 pandemic based on the eight components of the IFLA notification in 34 questions. The results showed that the level of media literacy and the ability to detect fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic is average. Media literacy, with a correlation coefficient of 0.56, has a positive and significant relationship with the ability to detect fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, with a path coefficient of 0.64, the predictive power detects fake news in the COVID-19 pandemic more than students. Training and measures should be taken to improve students' media literacy skills and increase their ability to deal with fake news.\n\nView Article\n\nPDF 416.91 K\n\nInformation Management\n\nThe Challenging Triangle: Online Health Information Seeking, Uncertainty, and Cyberchondria\n\nShahnaz Khademizadeh; Fatemeh Rafieinasab; Natarajan Radhakrishnan\n\nVolume 22, Issue 3 , July 2024, Pages 247-259\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.22034/ijism.2024.2003265.1122\n\nAbstract\n\nOnline health information seeking can be related to various factors.

Read More Online health information seeking can be related to various factors. Past studies have shown that two factors of uncertainty and cyberchondria can play a role in this regard. In this regard, the present research was designed to investigate online health information seeking with uncertainty and other criteria using a descriptive survey method. It was carried out in the research community of Ahvaz health network clients. The data collection tool was three questionnaires, and the findings were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. The findings showed that in the sample of 260 people under investigation, the mean of online health information seeking in the group of women was higher than that of men, but no significant difference was reported. In examining the average uncertainty and cyberchondria in gender groups, uncertainty was reported higher in women than men (significant difference). However, cyberchondria was not significantly different in the groups of men and women. No significant difference was observed regarding the educational level. Among the research variables, the uncertainty and doubt in facing the information have increased online health information seeking among the visitors to the health centers of Ahvaz City. According to the current research results, planning and training in health information search and making valid health information accessible in various information platforms by the policymakers and managers of the country's health system is necessary and inevitable.\n\nView Article\n\nPDF 300.98 K"
