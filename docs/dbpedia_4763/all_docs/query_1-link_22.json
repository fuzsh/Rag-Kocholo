They help students research topics related to their coursework and teach students how to access information. They also assist faculty and staff in locating resources related to their research projects or studies. Some campuses have multiple libraries, and librarians may specialize in a particular subject.\n\nAdministrative services librarians manage libraries, prepare budgets, and negotiate contracts for library materials and equipment. Some conduct public relations or fundraising activities for the library.\n\nPublic librarians work in their communities to serve all members of the public. They help patrons find books to read for pleasure; conduct research for schoolwork, business, or personal interest; and learn how to access the library’s resources.

They arrange materials for patrons’ ease in finding information. They are also responsible for ordering new library materials and archiving to preserve older items.\n\nUser services librarians help patrons conduct research using both electronic and print resources. They teach patrons how to use library resources to find information on their own. This may include familiarizing patrons with catalogs of print materials, helping them access and search digital libraries, or educating them on Internet search techniques. Some user services librarians work with a particular audience, such as children or young adults.\n\nHow to Become a Librarian or Library Media Specialist About this section\n\nLibrarians typically need a master’s degree in library science (MLS).

Some employers require special librarians to have a master’s degree, a professional degree, or a Ph.D. in that subject. For example, a law librarian may be required to have a law degree.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nPublic school librarians and library media specialists typically need a teacher’s certification.
