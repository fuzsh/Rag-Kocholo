Standards are developed by IFLA’s Professional Units, Special Programmes and Review Groups, often in collaboration with other international organisations.\n\nA thorough peer-review process ensures the quality and relevance of IFLA-endorsed standards, as part of IFLA’s wider mission of guiding the implementation of high-quality services and practices throughout the global library field.\n\nSee our list of Guidelines, technical standards, toolkits, statements and manifestos for more information."
