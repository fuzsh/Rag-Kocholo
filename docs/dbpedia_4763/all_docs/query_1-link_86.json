        "text": "Degree Requirements\n\nSchool of Information Master’s/Specialist Graduate Student Handbook\n\nThe Master of Science in Information (MSI) requires 36 semester hours, including four required core courses and one technology skills requirement course. Students should fill in their Advising Worksheet using the Course Rotation Schedule linked at the top of the Graduate Course Descriptions page.\n\nMaster of Science in Information with a Major in Information Courses\n\nRequired Core Courses (12 credits)\n\nLIS 5271 Research Methods in Information Studies (3 credits)\n\nLIS 5411 Introduction to Information Policy (3 credits)\n\nLIS 5408 Management of Information Organizations (3 credits)\n\nLIS 5703 Information Organization (3 credits)\n\nTechnology Skills Requirement (3 credits)\n\nThe FSU iSchool is committed to educating students to have the technology skills necessary to be successful information professionals. Accordingly, all MSI students are required to take at least one technology-focused course prior to completion of the degree.\n\nLIS 5485 Introduction to Information Technologies (strongly recommended for students with no prior IT background)\n\nLIS 5255 Information, Technology, and Older Adults\n\nLIS 5275 Usability Analysis\n\nLIS 5313 Digital Media: Concepts and Production\n\nLIS 5362 Design and Production of Networked Multimedia\n\nLIS 5472 Digital Libraries\n\nLIS 5484 Introduction to Data Networks\n\nLIS 5486 Managing Makerspaces\n\nLIS 5489 Network Administration\n\nLIS 5765 Data Mining and Analytics\n\nLIS 5775 Organizational Information Security\n\nLIS 5782 Database Management Systems\n\nElective Courses\n\nThe remaining credits may be taken from among any LIS-5000 level course and are selected depending on the needs of the student, the current technology skill level, and the foundation needs to support the student’s professional goals. View a list of our course offerings and course descriptions.\n\nTime to Completion\n\nCourse work for the Master degree must be completed within 7 years from the time the student first registers for graduate credit.\n\nAny graduate work transferred from another institution must have commenced not more than 7 years prior to completion of the degree for the credits to be applicable to the Master’s degree.\n\nExceptions may be appealed through the School of Information.\n\nPrograms of Study\n\nTo help facilitate course selection, courses have been organized into programs of study along general and specialized areas of interest. These programs of study are not required for graduation and do not result in any further notation on the diploma or transcripts, but rather function as a planning and advising tool for the students. Programs of study may help to guide your course selection in order to facilitate achievement of your career goals. They include:\n\nCultural Informatics\n\nGeneral Librarianship\n\nHealth Informatics\n\nInformation Organization\n\nLeadership & Management\n\nPublic, Academic, and Special Libraries\n\nReference Services\n\nSchool Libraries\n\nTechnology & Networking\n\nWeb Design\n\nYouth Services\n\nCertificates Programs\n\nCertificate Programs are also available while pursuing a Master of Science degree within the School of Information. Certificate programs are designed to provide an opportunity for professional development and result in an award separate from the diploma with the successful completion of select coursework for the certificate. Learn more about the types of certificates offered at the School, as well as certificate program requirements.\n\nThesis Option\n\nStudents pursuing the Master of Science in Information or the Master of Arts in Information (see MA Degree Requirements below) have the option to complete a thesis as part of their curriculum. The subject of the thesis must be within the major field and must reveal independent investigation and knowledge of the methods of scholarship.\n\nTo complete the thesis-type program, a student must complete all requirements for the master’s degree. Six hours of the required 36 degree hours must be thesis hours (LIS 5971 – 3 hours per semester over two semesters). A student must officially declare that he/she wants to pursue a thesis-type program by emailing School of Information Graduate Student Services requesting a change to thesis-type track and identifying the major professor who will supervise the thesis. The student, in coordination with the major professor, must complete the necessary paperwork to appoint a supervisory committee. The Supervisory Committee consists of at least three members: the major professor; the minor professor (if the student has a minor area); and one or two additional members from the major department. Additional members may be appointed if deemed desirable. All members of the committee must hold Graduate Faculty Status.\n\nStudents must also follow the University guidelines for completion of a thesis-type program as listed in the University Graduate Student Handbook as well as all requirements for manuscript clearance.\n\nMA Degree Requirements\n\nA Master of Arts (M. A.) degree may be earned by students who opt to complete 6 or more semester hours of graduate credit in one or more of the following fields: art, classical language, literature, and civilization; communication (not to include speech correction); English; history; humanities; modern languages and linguistics; music; philosophy; religion; and theatre. In addition, they must demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language.\n\nProficiency in foreign language may be demonstrated by:\n\nCertification by the appropriate language department, or\n\nCompletion of 12 semester hours in a foreign language with an average grade of at least 3.0 (B), or\n\nFour years of a single language in high school.\n\nIf you are interested in switching from the MS in Information to the MA in Information, please contact iSchool Student Services.\n\nJuris Doctor/Master of Science Joint Pathway Degree Requirements\n\nThe Juris Doctor/MS joint pathway leads to both a Juris Doctor (JD) Degree from the FSU College of Law and a Master of Science Degree from the FSU School of Information. Graduates who complete this joint pathway will be particularly suited to work in law libraries and other organizations involved with the creation and dissemination of legal information. Students in the joint pathway will receive academic advising from both the College of Law and the School of Information. Students interested in pursuing the J.D./M.S.I. joint pathway must apply to and be accepted by both the College of Law and the School of Information according to each school’s admission criteria. Students pursuing the joint pathway must first begin their study at the College of Law. Contact the FSU College of Law Admissions Office for application information.\n\nHours\n\nTotal of 109 hours from both programs:\n\n79 hours of Law courses\n\n30 hours of LIS courses\n\nIn effect, 9 hours of graduate course work in Information Studies are credited toward the 88 hours normally required for the Juris Doctor Degree, and 6 hours of LAW are credited toward the 36 hours normally required for the MS degree. This will save the joint pathway student 15 credit hours of coursework which would otherwise be required to complete both degrees separately.\n\nTime to Completion\n\nAll coursework for both degrees must be completed within a five-year period and both degrees will be awarded at the same time. With the exception of the 15 special credit hours described above, students will be expected to fulfill all requirements of both degrees."
