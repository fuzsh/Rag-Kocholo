        "text": "The last rites of child artist Taruni Sachdev, who died in a plane crash in Nepal, were performed here Wednesday evening.\n\nHer body was brought to Mumbai from Kathmandu through cargo along with her mother's body at 3 p.m. The funeral took place at Santa Cruz (West) cremation ground at 5.30 p.m. Her mother was also cremated at the same time.\n\n\"Woh bhagwan ki beti thi, bhagwan ke paas chali gayi (She was god's daughter, she has gone to god),\" Taruni's father told reporters here.\n\nHer maternal uncle said: \"Apni maa ke saath teerth yatra par gayi thi aur yeh sab ho gaya (She had gone on a pilgrimage with her mother). We are still in state of shock.\"\n\nTaruni was among 13 Indians who were killed when an aircraft crashed into a hill while coming in to land at Jomsom in western Nepal.\n\nAt 14, she had already featured in almost 50 ads, including a commercial for Rasna, and did a cameo in \"Paa\", apart from featuring in Malayalam films \"Vellinakshtram\" and \"Sathyam\"."
