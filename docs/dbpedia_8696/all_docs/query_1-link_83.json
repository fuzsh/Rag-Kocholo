        "text": "NEW DELHI: Indian child artist Taruni Sachdev was among those who died in the Nepal plane crash on Monday. The 14-year-old had a cameo in the Amitabh Bachchan-starrer 'Paa' and acted in numerous films in the South.\n\nShe had also featured in over 50 commercials, including one with Karishma Kapoor. Taruni's mother who was accompanying her on the flight also died in the crash.\n\nThirteen Indians among 15 people died in the Nepal air crash on Monday. The small Dornier aircraft carrying 21 people crashed in the country's mountanious region on Monday morning. The plane belonging to Agni Air had 21 people on board including three crew members. The local police said that it crashed while trying to land at the high altitude Jomsom Airport, which is a gateway to a popular tourist and trekking destination.\n\nThe plane turned into pieces but did not caught fire. The bodies of Pilot Prabhu Sharan Pathak and Co-pilot JD Maharjan were also recovered.\n\nThe Indian Embassy officials who were at the mortuary, where the bodies were brought, said that the identification of some of the victims may be a difficult task because the bodies were very badly mutilated or their faces were very badly wounded.\n\nOnce the identification process and the post-mortem will be completed, the bodies will be handed over. There is a 24/7 control room set up by the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu that was overlooking the entire process."
