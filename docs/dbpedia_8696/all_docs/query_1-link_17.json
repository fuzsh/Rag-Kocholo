        "text": "Taruni Sachdev was an Indian child actress and model who is best remembered for her appearance in the Rasna advertisements. She had worked in many films and television commercials. She garnered much praise in the entertainment world and became popular as the Rasna girl. Her role as a classmate of Amitabh Bachchan in the Bollywood flick Paa also received appreciations.\n\nTaruni had dreamt of becoming a heroine. In 2004, she made her debut in Vinayan’s comedy-horror Vellinakshatram .Vinayan said Vellinakshatram endeared Taruni to Malayalam audiences. The same year, she appeared in the action thriller Sathyam.\n\nDirector Vinayan had spotted Taruni in an advertisement with Amitabh Bachchan and contacted Bachchan’s manager to cast her in his films. He recalls: “We were all amazed by the manner in which she performed. She was just five then and could render Malayalam dialogues after listening to it for a couple of times. I still remember the intensity with which she performed in the climax of the film, where even senior actors found it difficult to work against high-speed propellers”."
