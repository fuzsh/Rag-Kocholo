        "text": "Sometimes life plays shocking games on the innocent... Child artiste Taruni Sachdev, the cute talent who is seen following Amitabh Bachchan in 'Paa', then in Rasna and several other ad commercials, is now no more....\n\nThe 14-year old kid died in a plane crash on Monday morning along with 14 other passengers in Nepal. As a tragic twist to a happy picnic, Taruni's mom who was accompanying her also passed away in the accident. According to sources, the Agni Air Dornier aircraft crashed while trying to land at the high altitude Jomsom Airport, an entry to a popular tourist and trekking locale.\n\nTaruni was last seen on small screen in Shah Rukh Khan's show 'Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?'. Besides Hindi, she had been a popular face in Malayalam films and other regional commercials.\n\nWe at IndiaGlitz pray for the soul of the pretty angel and extend heartfelt condolences to her near and dear ones√Ç ."
