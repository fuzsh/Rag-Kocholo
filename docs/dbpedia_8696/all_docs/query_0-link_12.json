        "text": "R Balki, Nikhil Advani and Priyadarshan who fondly remember her as one of the most talented child artists.\n\nA grief-stricken Balki said: “I can’t believe Taruni is gone. She was quite simply the most versatile actor I have ever worked with. Taruni was like Sridevi. She would have a number of expressions to offer for every scene, and each one was more perfect than the\n\nprevious one. Also, she was the leader among the kids on the sets of Paa... Without fuss, she could deliver her lines perfectly.”\n\nAt 14, Tarini had already featured in almost 50 ads apart from working in movies in Malayalam and Hindi languages.\n\nFilmmaker Nikhil Advani, who shot an ad with Taruni, remembers her as a very professional girl: “I shot with her four years ago. She was very professional.\n\nVery clued in about camera angles, etc. It’s tragic that she had to go so early.” Priyadarshan says he treated Taruni like his daughter. “I just can’t believe she’s gone! I have shot two or three ads with her... She was a very obedient child and a disciplined actor."
