        "text": "One of the most popular child artists of the Indian film industry was actress Taruni Sachdev. She was famous for being the face of Rasna, and was popularly called the ‘Rasna girl’. Unfortunately, she died in a tragic plane crash in 2012, when she was only 14. Even her mother, Geetha Sachdev, who was on the flight with her passed away in the crash. Sadly enough, the day she breathed her last was actually her birthday as well.\n\nHer sudden demise left the entire film industry in shock. Many prominent members of the film fraternity including Amitabh Bachchan and Karisma Kapoor, mourned her loss. As per the reports, there was something else more shocking than her sudden demise. Taruni Sachdev apparently had an intuition of her own death moments before boarding what would be her last flight ever.\n\nALSO READ | Ekta Kapoor’s posh bungalow will blow you away\n\nALSO READ | Where Is Bollywood’s Tarzan, Hemant Birje?\n\nAbout the plane crash\n\nOn 14 May 2012, a 20-seater plane scheduled from Pokhara to Jomsom crashed near Jomsom in Nepal. There were 16 Indians on board, including Taruni Sachdev and her mother Geetha Sachdev. The crash happened minutes before landing after the plane collided with a nearby hill, killing 15 people.\n\nTaruni Sachdev Career\n\nTaruni started working in Indian films at a very young age. She rose to fame after appearing in a Rasna ad campaign alongside actress Karishma Kapoor. She then went on to star in Paa and became one of the highest-paid child celebrities of Bollywood. She even appeared in ad campaigns of several popular brands such as Colgate, Saffola, LG, Reliance, ICICI bank and more."
