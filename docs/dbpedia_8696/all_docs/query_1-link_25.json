        "text": "The mortal remains of child artist Taruni Sachdev and her mother Geeta, who were killed in the Nepal plane crash, were consigned to flames at a crematorium in Mumbai.\n\nThe deceased duo were brought here from Kathmandu last afternoon following which the last rites took place at the Santa Cruz cremation ground, in suburban Mumbai, at around 5.30 pm.\n\nThe 14-year-old artist is best remembered for her role as Auro's (Amitabh Bachchan) friend in the National Award-winning film Paa.\n\nTaruni was also popularly known as the Rasna girl.\n\nThough no celebrities attended the funeral, Vidya Balan, who essayed the role of Bachchan's mother in Paa, said, \"I don't know how to react to this...to wake up to a news of Taruni passing away. It is very unfortunate for any parent to lose their child. I really pray to God to give strength to her father to cope with this.\n\n\"I remember Balki (director of Paa) used to say that she (Taruni) is like a mature actor and you put her in any situation she will manage it,\" the actress said.\n\nBoth Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan had worked with Taruni in Paa, and both of them tweeted their condolences and shock.\n\nAmitabh even wrote a letter of comfort to Taruni's father."
