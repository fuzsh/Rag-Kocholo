        "text": "A child actress, who starred in the Bollywood film Paa with superstar Amitabh Bachchan, was killed in Monday's plane crash in northern Nepal.\n\nTaruni Sachdev, 14, played Bachchan's friend in the award-winning film about progeria, a rare genetic condition.\n\nShe and her mother were among the 13 Indians killed in the crash.\n\nThe plane was carrying 21 people and hit a hillside as it tried to land at Jomsom airport. Six people survived the crash.\n\n\"Just reading that Taruni Sachdev, the girl child artist in Paa, has perished in Nepal plane crash... Please God may this not be true,\" Bachchan tweeted.\n\nHis son Abhishek, who too had a leading role in the film, also tweeted about Sachdev's death.\n\n\"SHOCKED and very saddened to hear about the Nepal plane crash. Lost one of my cutest co-stars. Little Taruni Sachdev from Paa. Speechless,\" he wrote.\n\nSachdev became famous after doing a commercial for Rasna soft drink and featured in almost 50 other commercials.\n\nShe also acted in two regional Malayalam language films and appeared in a quiz show hosted by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan."
