        "text": "Here is the list of top 10 Bollywood celebrities who died young age ,This stars start their careers at a very young age and go on to become legendary actors. But some of them leave us ahead of their time at a young age. Dealing with showbiz is not that simple, and sometimes it takes the toll on these artists. Let’s take a look at 10 such Bollywood stars who died at a young age:\n\n1. Jiah Khan\n\nThe death of the actress sent the film fraternity in shock. She hanged herself in her Juhu residence, when her mother and sister were not at home. Allegedly her crumbling love affair with Sooraj Pancholi, made her commit suicide. Later on a suicide note was surfaced, mentioning about her recent abortion as well.\n\n2 . Taruni Sachdev\n\nThe Agni Air Dornier aircraft which crashed close to Nepal's Jomson airport claimed the lives of child actor Taruni Sachdev and mother Geeta Sachdev among its other victims,The sad part is she hugged all her friends, saying, “I’m meeting you guys for the last time”.Though it was a light-hearted joke, according to her classmates, Taruni had “never hugged her friends or sent them goodbye messages before leaving for any of her earlier trips…” The last message Taruni sent to her best friend before boarding the flight was jokingly asking what would happen if the plane crashed, followed by “I love you”.\n\n3. Divya Bharti\n\nThe cutest actress of her time, the actress came to limelight with her very first Bollywood outing Vishwatma, notably for the song “Saat Samundar”. The actress fell from her 5 storey building and died before reaching the hospital, whether it was a murder, suicide or accidental death, never came out in open. Just 11 months after marriage to Sajid Naidawala, the actress who was in peak of her career, was no more.\n\n4. Meena Kumari\n\nWith just a short span of 30 years, the actress appeared in more than ninety films. One of the most prominent face of yesteryear. After divorcing her husband in 1964, her addiction to alcohol became stronger, and she often dulled her senses with liquor, which severely damaged her liver. Just 3 weeks after the release of her highly acclaimed movie, Pakeezah, she succumbed to death.\n\n5. Smita Patil\n\nThe dusky actress was regarded as one of the finest and veteran in her times.she died due to complications following childbirth on December 13, 1986, at the age of 31.\n\n6. Madhubala\n\nOnce the heart throb of nation and also to be featured in American magazine Theatre Arts with the title,\n\n“The Biggest Star in the World – and she’s not in Beverly Hills”. But as life would have it, the serene beauty was diagnosed with a hole in her heart, and was confined to bed for nine years and was reduced to just bones and skin. She tried to fulfill her commitments and tried to make a comeback, but life did not gave her that golden opportunity.\n\n7. Geeta Bali\n\nOne of the most unfortunate death, the actress contracted small pox while shooting for a Punjabi film, Rano, based on a novel Eik Chadar Maili Si. It is said, the director was so devastated by her untimely death that he had put the novel on her burning funeral pyre.\n\n8. Guru Dutt\n\nThe legendary actor was a distressed soul, who attempted suicide three times. And, his death is either accidental or intentional case, which is still a mystery. Guru Dutt was found dead in his bed in his rented apartment, it is said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills. His death may have been suicide, or just an accidental overdose..\n\n9. Sanjeev Kumar\n\nHowever, on November 6, 1985, at the age of 47, he suffered a massive heart attack, which resulted in his death. His younger brother Nikul died before him, while the other brother Kishore died six months later. Ironically for an actor who had played many elderly roles, he died at less than 50 years of age.\n\n10. Silk Smitha\n\nHer affair with the scandalous headlines never seized, nor her fame for the same. Better known for her bold and erotic characters, Silk Smitha broke all the stereotypes and proved her mantle. But as soon the fame started fading so was her will to live, she was found dead in her apartment, and perhaps financial problems, a disillusionment in love and an alcohol dependency which led to depression were her reasons to end the life.\n\nAbout admin\n\nJohn is the Owner and Editor of storymaza.
