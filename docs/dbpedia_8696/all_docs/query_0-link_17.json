She died at the age of 14. The coincidence is that her date of birth and death day was the same. She was born on 14 May 1998 and she died on May 14, 2012.\n\nSoundarya\n\nOn April 17, 2004, actress Soundarya was on her way to Karimnagar to campaign for a BJP candidate. The helicopter crashed at a height of 100 feet after takeoff from Jakkur airfield in Bengaluru.\n\nAaliyah\n\nActress Aaliyah died on August 25, 2001, at age 22, in a plane crash in the Abaco Islands, Bahamas.

His wife, Carolyn, and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, also died in the crash.\n\nYS Rajasekhar Reddy\n\nYS Rajasekhar Reddy was the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He died in a 2009 plane crash involving a Bell 430 twin-engine helicopter in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh. An investigation into the crash later determined that the helicopter was not airworthy. The helicopter was being flown due to the pilots’ poor decisions and crashed."
