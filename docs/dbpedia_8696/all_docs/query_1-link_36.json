Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as this nomination's talk page, the article's talk page or Wikipedia talk:Did you know), unless there is consensus to re-open the discussion at this page. No further edits should be made to this page.\n\nThe result was: promoted by Yoninah (talk) 23:18, 9 May 2020 (UTC)\n\nTaruni Sachdev\n\n... that Indian child actress Taruni Sachdev has appeared in more than fifty commercials? Source: Taruni Sachdev died on her 14th birthday \"She became a popular child artiste with over 50 commercials to her credit\".\n\nReviewed: Not My Baby (Inna song)\n\nComment: I don't know if mentioning her death is a good idea? Can this be saved for 14 May for her 22th birthday.\n\nImproved to Good Article status by CAPTAIN MEDUSA (talk). Self-nominated at 12:20, 5 May 2020 (UTC).\n\nSad interesting short life, short GA on plenty of sources. I agree not to mention her death, but should commercials be all we mention? ...instead of - at least also - a serious film? - I wonder about the picture, which I can't find on the commons. It has a bad title. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 08:13, 8 May 2020 (UTC)\n\nALT1:... that Indian child actress Taruni Sachdev had dreamt of becoming a heroine?\n\nALT2:... that Indian child actress Taruni Sachdev was nicknamed \"Rasna girl\" after appearing in several Rasna commercials?\n\nGerda Arendt, Maybe this could work? The image was deleted from Commons and was moved to enwiki as fair use rationale. ~~ CAPTAIN MEDUSAtalk 11:56, 9 May 2020 (UTC)\n\nBetter, thank you. \"heroine\" is a word of too many meanings, and many dream that, so nothing specific to her. Do you think we could shorten ALT2, cut after \"girl\", perhaps link ro Rasna, - somehow I try to avoid \"commercials\" to not appear commercial ;) --Gerda Arendt (talk) 12:12, 9 May 2020 (UTC)\n\nALT2a: ... that Indian child actress Taruni Sachdev was nicknamed \"Rasna girl\"?\n\nGerda Arendt Simply this? ~~ CAPTAIN MEDUSAtalk 12:22, 9 May 2020 (UTC)\n\nfine! I approve the other also but prefer this. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 12:24, 9 May 2020 (UTC)"
