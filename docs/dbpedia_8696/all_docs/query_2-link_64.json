        "text": "It's fascinating how certain concepts remain abstract until they happen in our lives. For instance, take 'Missing-a-train\", I knew people missed their trains for various reasons and it could happen to anyone, but I thought I would never miss one, Why ? Because (until it happened, which it did, when I was 29) for 29 years I have never missed a Train. Its amazing, how our brains intertwine these two overlapping concepts of 'Has-Never-Happened' and 'Will-Never-Happen' synonyms. I have been working for 10 years now. Even before the college farewell wishes and tears could dry up, I got the call letter from Infosys, which was my campus placement. From there on, it has been a linear graph upward. Opportunities just came my way and I just went ahead with them and they definitely have been rewarding. Then the UNTIL phrase got added. Another abstract concept became a reality. LAYOFF. Ironically, I have received my first offer letter and termination letter exactly on the same date May16, ten years apart. As I type this post reminiscing the highs and lows of my career, I feel oddly optimistic that, this couldnt have happened at a better timing, if it had to happen. I deem myself to be one of the fortunate ones, who can consider this period as a break, an extended vacation and rebuild as I navigate through this job hunt mid career. One month of job hunt has taught me that this is a very tough market to crack and you need to be unique, to even be looked at. I intend to do so, by sharing my knowledge here as Byte sized videos. I request you guys to support me in this new journey of mine.

When I graduated college, I had 3 offers in hand - Infosys, Cognizant and‚Ä¶ ShopG. You‚Äôve probably never heard of the last, and I hadn‚Äôt either. So I must have chosen it for the pay, right? Not quite. The tech giants were offering full time roles at Rs 40k / month, whereas ShopG offered me an internship at Rs 15k / month. So when I made my choice, everyone thought I was making a huge mistake and would regret my decision sooner or later. They even tried to convince me against it. But I stood my ground for 1 simple reason: I knew that I didn‚Äôt want to get into the IT space. I wanted to be an entrepreneur. So working at a startup in an e-commerce space would help me learn a lot more about it than IT MNCs. Luckily, I was right. At ShopG, I was a category manager, handling 2 top verticals - men‚Äôs fashion and kitchen products. I got a lot of exposure, made my own decisions, and felt more like an entrepreneur than a corporate employee. But even though I loved the work, the stipend wasn‚Äôt enough to get me by in a city like Bangalore. I cut down expenses to basically 0 and made it work somehow. There was one light at the end of the tunnel. After 3 months of internship, I was promised a full-time role with a raise to 25k / month. But this raise never came. I kept asking, and they kept extending my internship. 3 months became 6, and soon 12. Eventually, I realised they were playing me - so I quit. But not before I‚Äôd learnt everything I could about running my own company. For a bit, I regretted taking this role (like everyone said I would), because it didn‚Äôt lead anywhere. But I realised that the exposure I‚Äôd received, would make building my own business easier. And that‚Äôs exactly what it did! Today, I‚Äôm glad that I rejected those job offers because they would‚Äôve taken me towards a career I never wanted. So remember - a small step in the right direction is better than a big one in the wrong direction. Do you think I made the right choice? #placement #job #career\n\nTata Consultancy Services recently announced 80,000 vacancies they can't fill due to a skill gap. This shows an important issue: The need for consulting. Amar Shetye, who leads global operations at TCS's Resource Management Group (RMG), announced that the company currently has 80,000 job openings. But since there‚Äôs a skill mismatch among existing employees, RMG is forced to depend on contractors to bridge these gaps. I feel this gap isn‚Äôt just about lacking certain technical abilities, but also a gap between education, young businesses, and strategic vision. It's not enough to train employees in specific tasks; they need to understand and align with management's vision. That‚Äôs where the real impact happens. A good mentor can help new hires see the bigger picture. They can show how individual roles contribute to overall goals. This creates a sense of purpose and direction, making employees more engaged and effective. Consulting helps with the mindset and ability to relate to management's vision, which is beneficial to both parties. You can learn technical aspects, but skills other than those will help you sustain the job for a longer time. Skills like communication, leadership, and adaptability ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction. Consulting can help in achieving that. Also, TCS isn‚Äôt the only one struggling with hiring. Companies like Wipro and Infosys are in the line too. And due to that, potential employees are struggling as well. We need to rethink our approach to hiring and training. While the reference here is taken from the IT sector, it applies across all sectors‚Äîbe it manufacturing or service industry. Invest in mentorship programs that emphasize alignment with the company's vision.Use practical workshops, shadowing, and regular feedback to build this connection. Even the leaders and ability to mentor and the alignment of the vision plays a major role here. If we want to see hiring and joining done right, we must make these necessary changes. With the right consulting, we can develop a workforce that's not only skilled but also deeply connected to the company's mission. The future of work can‚Äôt be just about filling roles. We need aligned, visionary teams to benefit both parties‚Äîemployees and employers. #VijaySays #mentorship #mentors #skill #skillgap #training #leadership #vision #StanfordSeed #TCS #Infosys #Wipro #india #hiring #training #consulting #DalyCollege #IIT #IIM #AscentFoundation #VMManagementConsultingAndAdvisory\n\nTo the Final-Year Students Without Campus Jobs Yet ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚úä I still remember those days vividly‚Äî10 years ago, I had just completed my B-Tech. Despite my degree from a government college, I didn't secure a job through campus placements. While others were practicing their reasoning skills, I had been focusing on developing real-life skills. Even though I was selected for a job at Syntel, no offer letter ever came. I found myself in a challenging situation: jobless and feeling the weight of uncertainty. But it was during these tough times that I learned the most valuable lessons. Together with my friends Goutam Show and Debasish Halder, we decided to take a leap of faith and head to Bangalore in search of opportunities. I didn't even have the money for a train ticket, but with the support of my friends and the hope that we could make something of ourselves, we set off. My connections with seniors‚Äîbuilt through developing a hostel web application and alumni ecosystem‚Äîproved invaluable. When we reached Bangalore, Kajal Singha Mahata da, one of my seniors, called me with an offer to join his startup in Hyderabad. The catch was that for the first three months, there would be no pay. However, after that period, I would earn 10K per month. I agreed on the condition that he would also hire my two friends. I convinced my friends that gaining experience at the startup would be more valuable than struggling in Bangalore for a year. Both sides agreed. We went to Hyderabad from Bangalore to start our corporate journey. Looking back now, all of us are in good positions, and those initial struggles feel like distant memories. To all the final-year students out there who haven't secured a job yet‚Äîdon't lose hope. Your journey is just beginning. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn, grow, and eventually succeed. Keep pushing forward, believe in yourself, and seize every opportunity that comes your way. Your perseverance and hard work will pay off, and you'll find yourself in a place you never imagined. Stay strong, stay focused, and never stop believing in your potential. Your success story is just around the corner. Comment your story if you have also gone through a similar situation.üôÇ\n\nDear Learner, Infosys #hiring #internship #tech We are delighted to inform you that our Infosys Springboard Pragati: Path to Future Cohort 1 is nearing its conclusion, and we are thrilled to announce the opening of registrations for the July-September cohort.

Analysts predict a similar outcome in 2024, with estimations suggesting only 40% will find jobs. This coincides with industry shifts, exemplified by recent IT sector layoffs at Infosys and Wipro. Furthermore, only 27% of graduates find roles directly aligned with their field of study, highlighting a concerning disconnect between graduate skillsets and industry requirements. Why is this happening at esteemed institutions like IITs? The culprit lies in the pervasive skills gap between graduates and employers. Traditional, theory-heavy curriculums fail to equip students with the practical and interpersonal skills (soft skills) sought after by today's workforce. This lack of industry exposure hinders graduates' ability to adapt to real-world scenarios, leading to feelings of unpreparedness and a struggle for companies to find qualified talent. So, what's the solution? The answer lies in bridging this critical skills gap by offering a unique learning experience that equips graduates with the practical tools employers require. Skolar emerges as a frontrunner in this domain, transcending theory-based lectures and fostering real-world application through hands-on training and project-based learning. This approach empowers graduates to confidently enter the workforce, armed with the expertise to thrive. The burning question: Will the onus of bridging this gap fall on external resources like Skolar, or will educational institutions adapt their curriculums to align with industry needs? #Skolar #SkillTech #FutureofWork #Education #WorkforceDevelopment Courtesy - News18 , IndiaToday, Wasingtonpost"
