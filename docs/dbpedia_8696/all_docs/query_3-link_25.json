        "text": "Why I Declined an offer from EY Some of you might be thinking, \"Is she out of her mind?\" Well, let me explain. I know most of you might think, am I even in my senses to decline an offer from Big4 where people are dying to go. I did but there were sort of genuine reasons I could list - 1) The role was of Talent Acquisition, I wanted to go for Audit and Assurance role. 2) The first 2 months were unpaid, it was an internship based role then I was offered to convert it full time. Being a graduate I won't find it suitable to go for an Internship, that too out of my domain interests. Many a times we reject offers because it doesn't fit our brackets. It's better to fetch good hands, rather than planning aimlessly. I believe rather than saying yes to everything, aim for roles that truly fit your skills and ambitions. After all, it‚Äôs better to be in the right role than just any role! PS -Have you occured such instances too where you needed to decline offers from big brands?

It's been more than a month since I started working with EY, and I have accomplished something that I believe 18 year old Aditya, back in 2022, would never have thought of when he entered college. I started everything from scratch, and I still remember a girl in my college said in our class group, 'Ki isko koi company Placement toh chhodo Internship bhi nahi degi,' and now it's been more than a month in the big 4. Here are the corrected learnings:- 1. Always ask questions if you want to become a better version of yourself because continuously acquiring knowledge is the key to that. 2. Time management will lead to great productivity, but for that, you have to be dedicated. 3. Transparency is something that defines you as a human in the corporate world. 4. Your hunger will give you the appreciation you deserve and help you be experimental with yourself. 5. Challenges help you set benchmarks and take you to a good place outside your comfort zone. I know many of you are currently in your first year, or maybe second or final year. Just remember one thing: belief is everything. I used to be an average student in my 11th grade, and from there, I managed to secure a place in a top college and a good firm as well, and I will continue to do so. I just want to say that don't be someone who reads about achievements, be someone who writes about their own achievements. What do you think is the biggest problem that is stopping you from achieving big things in life? ‚û°Ô∏èLet me know in the comments. #eyindia #experience #belivemakeseverything LinkedIn for Creators\n\nYesterday, I visited my EY office to meet my Director. I believe that EY changed my life because EY gave me those connections that helped me grow in my professional and personal life. He was my Director, or you can say a mentor or a friend. I have never seen anyone with this much humbleness. When I completed my internship in November last year. He said to me, \"Tujhe iss Internship ke baad kabhi bhi agar help chahiye hogi toh just give me a call dw.\" He helped me multiple times. I have one rule in my life: I don't make connections, I make bonds with people. You can network with 1000 people, but the way you manage your bonding is something valuable. My director told me one thing yesterday: \"Always consider your inner voice because it helps you get clarity.\" - Be Honest - Be Helpful - Be Oriented Three rules if you want to help someone grow. Life is all about \"How you help your Inferior when you are at your highest.

It's just not an option.\" Month 2: People 2 through 30 said, \"Unfortunately, you don't really have the type of background we're looking for.\" Month 3: Finally got in front of the right person, who said, \"Your background is perfect for our GPS team. Let's set up an interview.\" Month 5: After 10 interviews, a partner called me and said, \"We'd love to have you intern with us this summer.\" Month 8: After the internship the CPO said, \"We really want you to join us full-time. Here's the highest-paying offer and signing bonus we've given any intern this year. And we'll pay for the second year of your MBA tuition.\" Keep networking, keep learning, and never take no for an answer. #coaching #jobseekers\n\nHere's how I got into Deloitte as a Senior Consultant having NEVER even worked in an office environment before: Month 1: The first person I could get ahold of said, \"We don't hire people from your school to join our GPS team.
