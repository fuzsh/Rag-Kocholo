        "text": "Today, November 14, as the nation celebrates the day dedicated to the innocence and joy around the wondrous phenomenon of childhood, let's drown ourselves into nostalgia and remember some child artists that will always remain etched into our memory even after years of their first appearance on screen.\n\nMaster Raju\n\nActor Raju Shreshtha, better known as Master Raju ruled the 70s with his impressive performances as a child actor in movies like Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Bawarchi, Basu Chatterjee's Chitchor and Gulzar's Kitaab. Raju also went on to win the National Film Award for Best Child Artist for his role in Chitchor, post which he's appeared in several television shows and movies. He also lent his voice to Suraj Sharma's role in the Hindi dubbed version of the film, Life of Pi.\n\nImage courtesy: YouTube\n\nAditya Narayan\n\nadvertisement\n\nNot submitting to his father, Udit Narayan's stardom, Aditya Narayan decided to carve a niche in the industry for himself. An established child actor, Aditya appeared in movies like Pardes, Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai but his ultimate moment of glory was when he lent his voice to the track Chhota Baccha Jaan Ke from Masoom which also went on to win him a Screen Award (1997) in the critics' Best Child Singer category.\n\nImage courtesy: YouTube\n\nParzan Dastur\n\nWho doesn't remember the adorable little kid from the much-loved Dhara commercial? He rekindled our love for jalebis, and made us believe that counting stars is completely normal. His \"Tussi ja rahe ho? Tussi na jao\" remains in our memory till date\n\nSana Saeed\n\nFrom one Kuch Kuch Hota Hai child actor to another. Sana Saeed's transformation from the adorable Anjali in the Shah Rukh Khan blockbuster to the ravishing Tanya in Student Of The Year, has been a rather impressive one.\n\nImage courtesy: YouTube\n\nHansika Motwani"
