        "text": "Will Forte is returning to Netflix and reuniting with his former Saturday Night Live colleague Tina Fey for her new series, Four Seasons. The series, based on the 1981 film of the same name, was co-created by Fey with the cast featuring Steve Carell, Colman Domingo, Kerri Kenney-Silver and Erika Henningsen. Forte and Fey were castmates on SNL for four years (2002-06) and Forte later had a recurring part on Fey’s series, 30 Rock.\n\nThe 1981 film Four Seasons was written and directed by Alan Alda, and centered on three couples who vacation together each season and the changes in the group dynamic when one of couples splits up and the man brings a much younger woman on subsequent trips. Alda also starred in the movie alongside Carol Burnett, Len Cariou, Rita Moreno, Jack Weston, Sandy Dennis and Bess Armstrong.\n\nEditorial credit: DFree / Shutterstock.com"
