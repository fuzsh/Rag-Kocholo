        "text": "Though a successful stage and film actor, Alan Alda made his most lasting impact playing Hawkeye Pierce, the suave but goofy surgeon fond of homemade martinis and chasing after nurses on the classic television series \"M*A*S*H\" (CBS, 1972-1983). Because of his long, successful stint on what many considered the greatest show of all time, Alda managed to branch out of acting into writing and directing, becoming the only creative personality to have won Emmy awards in all three categories. Prior to \"M*A*S*H,\" Alda was an acclaimed actor on stage and in films, making notable performances in \"Purlie Victorious\" (1961-62), \"The Apple Tree\" (1966-67) and \"Paper Lion\" (1968). After directing the last episode of \"M*A*S*H,\" the most watched series finale in history, Alda went on to further success, both in front of and behind the camera, directing and starring in \"The Four Seasons\" (1981), \"Sweet Liberty\" (1986) and \"A New Life\" (1988). He delivered strong, acclaimed performances in \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" (1989) and \"And the Band Played On\" (HBO, 1993), both of which turned his nice guy persona on its head. By the time he won an Emmy for playing a Republican presidential candidate on \"The West Wing\" (NBC, 1999-2006), Alda was revered for being one of the most accomplished and versatile actors in the business. Though he continued working into his 80s, a diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease slowed his productivity."
