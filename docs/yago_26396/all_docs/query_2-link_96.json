        "text": "Transcript\n\nLYNN SHERR: And speaking of the human side, Richard Feynman famously played the bongo drums.\n\nALAN ALDA: Yeah. I had to learn how to do that.\n\nSHERR: So there's Richard Feynman. So was this also a way into his character? And by the way, you say you also had to learn?\n\nALDA: I had to learn how to do it. And I foolishly made the mistake of saying to Peter, how about if he delivers this whole monologue while he's drumming? You know that's like doing this, you know?\n\nSHERR: Did you feel that you needed, wanted to do that to show his humanity or to reach the audience?\n\nALDA: Well, it was part of how he was so many different people.\n\nSHERR: Right.\n\nALDA: He was a safecracker. At Los Alamos, he would break into people's safes and leave a little note-- safecracker's struck again, because he wanted to show them--\n\nSHERR: He could do it.\n\nALDA: It's the way people hack into companies now and say, see? You're vulnerable.\n\nSHERR: Right.\n\nALDA: So he wanted to show them they were vulnerable. But meanwhile, he was cracking into safes and driving people crazy."
