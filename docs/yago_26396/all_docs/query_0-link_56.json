        "text": "Steve Carell is set to star opposite Tina Fey in the upcoming Netflix comedy series “The Four Seasons,” Variety has learned.\n\nThe series is based on the 1981 film of the same name that was directed by and starred Alan Alda with Carol Burnett, Rita Moreno, Sandy Dennis, and Len Cariou also among the cast members. The series was first announced in January with an eight-episode order and is slated to begin production later this year.\n\nIn the film, three married couples take vacations together each season, but things are thrown for a loop when one of the husbands leaves his wife and begins bringing a younger woman with him. It was previously adapted into a 1984 TV series for CBS.\n\nThis will not be the first time Carell and Fey have appeared together onscreen. They previously played a married couple in the hit 2010 comedy feature “Date Night.” This is also not Carell’s first Netflix series, as he previously led the comedy series “Space Force” at the streamer.\n\nCarell is best known for his time on the hit NBC comedy “The Office,” for which he received six consecutive Emmy nominations for best actor in a comedy series. He also won a Golden Globe for the series in 2006. Carell is an Oscar nominee as well, receiving the nod for best actor for his role in the 2014 film “Foxcatcher.” He has also starred in films like “The 40 Year Old Virgin,” “The Big Short,” and the “Despicable Me” franchise. His recent TV credits include the FX limited series “The Patient” and “The Morning Show” at Apple TV+.\n\nHe is repped by WME, MediaFour Management, and Johnson, Shapiro, Slewett, Kole.\n\nIn addition to starring, Fey co-created the series along with Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield. All three previously worked together on the beloved NBC sitcom “30 Rock.” All three also executive produce along with David Miner, Eric Gurian and Jeff Richmond. Alda and Marissa Bregman, whose father produced the film, will also produce the series. Universal Television, where Fey and her Little Stranger, Inc. banner are set up under an overall deal, will produce."
