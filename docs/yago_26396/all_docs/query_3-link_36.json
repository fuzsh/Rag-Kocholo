        "text": "Although Alda is best known for his award-winning work in movies, theater and television, he has an equally distinguished record in public communication of science. For 14 years he was the host of the PBS series “Scientific American Frontiers,” a television show that investigated scientific and technological advancements. He also joined Stony Brook University as a visiting professor and helped create the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science (CCS) in 2009, which is focused on helping current and future scientists learn to communicate more clearly and vividly with the public.\n\nDuring Alda’s Montgomery Fellowship, Dartmouth joined the CCS to help students and faculty communicate about their research more effectively, and Alda nurtured that partnership."
