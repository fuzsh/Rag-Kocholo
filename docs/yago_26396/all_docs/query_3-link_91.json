        "text": "ALAN ALDA'S Joe Tynan isn't altogether believable as a politician, but he's a warm, sensitive, intelligent character, around whom an uncommonly well-meaning movie has been fashioned. Mr. Alda's screenplay for \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan,\" which opens at the Gemini 2 and other theaters today, is ambitious enough to touch on even more aspects of this man's life than it can comfortably handle â€” especially because Tynan's main problem is how to keep his wife, children, mistress and dizzying career from running away from him. The film, like Senator Tynan, is in danger of being spread too thin.But Mr. Alda offers someone who genuinely cares about his diverse interests, even when they conflict, and who has a natural talent for making sound choices. The title is a bit misleading, and so is any notion that the film is about politics. For one thing, Mr. Alda's Tynan, while certainly human enough to have his head turned by sufficient flattery, isn't passive enough to be seduced. For another, he isn't chilly enough to pay single-minded attention to political life. Mr. Alda plays Tynan's professional smoothness to the hilt, but he never gives the man enough ruthlessness to match his alleged charisma, or enough charisma to explain his status as a budding national hero.A crucial scene at the end of the movie shows Tynan, about to make a nominating speech at the Democratic National Convention, more eager to have a heart-to-heart talk with his wife than to make the speech. Indeed, as he steps out before an auditorium full of cheering delegates, the thing that gives him the greatest satisfaction is his wife's smile. Implausible as this may be in the arena of national politics, it seems applicable enough to a more generalized kind of fame, which is perhaps what Mr. Alda meant to consider in the first place. In any case, Tynan's colleagues in the Senate are so well played that the film's wheeler-dealer scenes work nicely enough on the level of simple character study. And his complicated home life could just as well be that of any man who is suddenly more celebrated than he ever expected to be.Barbara Harris plays Tynan's bright, pretty, admirably self-sufficient wife, with whom he is very evidently in love. Meryl Streep, more stunning with each new appearance on the screen, has an equally tangible hold on him as a cool, clever, irresistible labor lawyer with whom he is thrown into professional contact. It can't remain strictly business for long. But Miss Streep's remarkable accomplishment is to keep both Tynan and the audience perpetually off balance, to turn a predictable affair into a source of constant surprise.The director, Jerry Schatzberg, achieves the most subtly impressive scene in the film when, as Miss Streep realizes during a private conference in the Senator's office that their flirtation is about to become something more, he simply trains the camera in closely on her astonishingly versatile face.\"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" bends over backwards too far to make sense of this romance. Miss Streep, who is supposed to be married, is given an unnecessary scene with a husband who's always traveling and altogether neglectful of her; however, she has already made her character too alluring for this to make sense. Similarly, Mr. Alda is able to decide, with unconvincing ease, how to solve the problem of having two marvelous women in his life.Midway through the movie, once the conflicting forces at work on Joe Tynan have been explained, the whole thing switches into too high a gear, rushing through solutions that are simpler than the problems at hand. In a quick and mystifying montage, Tynan is seen gearing up for a possible Presidential campaign; then, just as abruptly, he's back home in Westchester County, trying to cheer up his troubled teen-age daughter. The optimism of Mr. Alda's screenplay is surely admirable, but by this stage of the story something more complex is called for. Joe Tynan, after digging himself into what ought to be a gigantic hole, suddenly sprouts wings and flies away.The principal thing that keeps \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" engrossing is the level of acting it sustains throughout. Rip Torn brings a new dimension to political sleaziness in the role of a skirt-chasing (and catching) Southern Senator, and Melvyn Douglas is suitably alarming as an elder statesman on the verge of senility. Miss Harris is particularly graceful in avoiding the stereotype of the politician's wife. Just as Miss Streep does, she shows the audience something new.\n\nCoping With Fame\n\nTHE SEDUCTION OF JOE TYNAN, directed by Jerry Schatzberg; written by Alan Alda; director of photography, Adam Holender; film editor, Evan Lottman; music by Bill Conti; produced by Martin Bregman; released by Universal Pictures.
