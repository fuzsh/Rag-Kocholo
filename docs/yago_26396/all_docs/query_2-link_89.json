        "text": "The show marks a return to work for Caldwell, who has not been seen in the New York area as actor or director in recent years, aside from a March 14, 2003, guest appearance in the Broadway comedy The Play What I Wrote. She had been announced to direct Cat on a Hot Tin Roof at the Kennedy Center this summer, but withdrew for \"personal reasons.\" Her past directing credits include Vita and Virginia and Park Your Car in Harvard Yard. Still, it is as an actress that she is best known. She has won four Tony Awards, most recently for playing Maria Callas in Terrence McNally's Master Class.\n\nAlda has appeared on Broadway in The Apple Tree, Jake's Women, Art, and QED.\n\nMee's work, typically addressing the topic of love and its many manifestations, includes such titles as Wintertime, True Love and Big Love.\n\nBay Street production have often transferred to New York. With the involvement of Caldwell and Alda, there's a good change Manhattan producers will be visiting Sag Harbor to view the show.\n\n* As for the rest of the season, Christine Ebersole, Dylan Baker, Edward Hibbert, Richard Kind and Tony Roberts will star in the Bay Street presentation of Rough Crossing by Tom Stoppard. Bay Street favorite, actor-director Daniel Gerroll (Accomplice, Blithe Spirit) will stage Rough Crossing. Dates are June 15 through July 4.\n\nEbersole won a Tony Award for 42nd Street. She also starred in Dinner at Eight at Lincoln Center. Baker was this season seen at the Atlantic Theatre Company in Howard Korder's Sea of Tranquility. Hibbert acted in the recent Broadway revival of Noises Off. Kind starred in the Chicago and D.C. Productions of Stephen Sondheim's Bounce.\n\nCharles Busch's turn in the title role of Auntie Mame will fill the number three spot, July 13-August 1. Richard Sabellico directs Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee's play. Also in the cast are Tolan Aman, Kerrie Blaisdell, Jennifer Harmon, Michael McCormick, Gordana Rashovich, Victor Slezak, Patrick Ryan Sullivan, Max Von Essen\n\nThe fateful match of play and actor will first take place this summer at Maine's storied summer stock landmark, the Ogunquit Playhouse, as previously reported by Playbill On-Line. Dates are June 28-July 10. The set and costume design will be handled by Busch's longtime designers Michael Bottari and Ronald Case.\n\nBusch will play the larger than life madcap Mame, who famously lives her life as a banquet and charges his impressionable orphaned nephew to \"Live!\" The show was a hit in 1956 for playwrights Lawrence and Lee, who adapted the work from the novel by Patrick Dennis, and has since become a camp classic with a passionately worshipful following. It inspired both a movie, with Rosalind Russell, and the Jerry Herman musical Mame.\n\nRounding out the season is Marcia Milgrom Dodge's treatment of Lynn Ahrens and music by Stephen Flaherty early success, Once on this Island, Aug. 10-Sept. 5."
