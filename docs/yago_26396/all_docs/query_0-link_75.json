        "text": "Steve Carell has joined Netflix’s new comedy series The Four Seasons opposite Tina Fey. It will mark a reunion for the two actors after starring in the 2010 romantic comedy Date Night together.\n\nBased on the 1981 film of the same name, The Four Seasons will serve as Fey’s first starring role since 30 Rock, which concluded its seven-season run in 2013, and her first original show for Netflix since the premiere of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt in 2015.\n\nThe Four Seasons has received an initial eight-episode order, with production set to begin later this year. The series was co-created by Fey with fellow 30 Rock writers Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield.\n\nRelated Video\n\nThe original Four Seasons film was written and directed by Alan Alda in his directorial debut. It starred Alda, Carol Burnett, Rita Moreno, Sandy Dennis, and Len Cariou. The story follows three middle-aged New York City couples who vacation together each season. When one husband divorces his wife for a much younger woman, however, the sextet is thrown for a loop. The title is derived from the Vivaldi suite The Four Seasons, which served as the film’s score.\n\nThe upcoming Netflix adaptation will be executive produced by Fey, Fisher, and Wigfield, as well as David Miner, Eric Gurian, and Fey’s husband and frequent collaborator, Jeff Richmond. Alda and Marissa Bregman, whose father Martin produced the original film, will also produce the series.\n\nFey’s acting roles since 30 Rock have been limited, but she did appear in last fall’s A Haunting in Venice and as a guest star in three seasons of Hulu’s murder mystery comedy Only Murders in the Building. Next, she’ll appear in the upcoming theatrical adaptation of the Mean Girls musical, which is set to hit theaters this Friday, January 12th.\n\nEditor’s Note: This article has been updated with news of Steve Carell joining the cast."
