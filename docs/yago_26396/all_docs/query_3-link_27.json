        "text": "01 of 10\n\nFilm and TV Legend\n\nWhile it was a “wonderful surprise” for Alan Alda to learn that he would receive the Life Achievement Award at the Screen Actors Guild Awards (Jan. 27 on TBS/TNT), the 82-year-old vet of film and TV feels like it’s still a little early to celebrate his 60-plus year-old career. “I’m still a kid!” he insists. “They don’t know that.” But EW convinced him to reflect on his past six decades in Hollywood, anyway. Alda looks back at some of his greatest roles.\n\n02 of 10\n\nPaper Lion (1968)\n\nAfter graduating with an English degree from Fordham University in the Bronx and completing a tour of duty in Korea, the New York native established himself as a stage actor (most notably acting on Broadway opposite Barbara Harris in 1966’s The Apple Tree) before booking his first major film role: the lead in the adaptation of George Plimpton’s nonfiction account of his time as a rookie quarterback for the Detroit Lions. “It was fun making the movie because I didn’t know anything about football,” the actor says of filming Paper Lion, which also stars Lauren Hutton. “By the time I finished, I could throw a football 50 yards and hit the receiver. Every time I did it, I had to sleep with my arm in ice all night. I could hardly lift a spoon.”\n\n03 of 10\n\nThe Mephisto Waltz (1971)\n\nAlda felt like he was following in the footsteps of his father, The Girl Who Knew Too Much actor Robert Alda, when he scored the chance to portray a pianist–turned–music journalist in this occult-horror film that costarred Jacqueline Bisset. “I had to play a few bars of the Mephisto Waltz. To do that, I had to learn where to put my fingers with a piano teacher for about three weeks, six hours a day,” Alda recalls of preparing to work on the film, which was based on a novel of the same title. “That’s what my father [who died in 1986] did in his first movie when he played George Gershwin in Rhapsody in Blue. I was repeating his same thing, decades later.”\n\n04 of 10\n\nSame Time, Next Year (1978)\n\nAn adaptation of the 1975 Bernard Slade play of the same name, this film — which earned an Oscar nomination for Alda’s costar Ellen Burstyn — is a big fan favorite, which continues to puzzle Alda. “Women come up to me in airports and say it’s their favorite movie. Then they get a little closer and say, ‘It’s my life story,’ ” says the actor, who has been married since 1957 to wife Arlene, a photographer/author with whom he raised three daughters in New Jersey. “It’s the story of two people who are married to other people who get together every year for a tryst! Why would you come up to a stranger and tell them it’s your life story?”\n\n05 of 10\n\nThe Four Seasons (1981)\n\nAlda wrote, directed, and starred in this movie about a trio of couples (Alda and Carol Burnett, Jack Weston and Rita Moreno, and Len Cariou and Sandy Dennis) who routinely vacation together. His younger daughters, Elizabeth and Beatrice, also appear in the film. “We had three weeks to rehearse, which you ordinarily don’t get,” Alda recalls of filming The Four Seasons. “I told everybody our primary objective was to be close friends, because that’s what we had to be in the film. It would show if we really were friends. Everybody devoted themselves to that, and to telling embarrassing stories about themselves. It got copied a little on television, I think, in series that just concentrated on friends—thirtysomething used the style a lot.”\n\n06 of 10\n\nM*A*S*H* (1972-1983)\n\nAfter 11 seasons of playing Capt. Hawkeye Pierce on this ensemble CBS comedy—which also starred Loretta Swit and Gary Burghoff—Alda is surprised that most people want to talk about a moment from the 1983 two-and-a-half-hour series finale: Hawkeye recalls a formerly repressed memory of seeing a refugee smother her baby\n\nto avoid detection by an enemy patrol. The memory is so traumatic for Hawkeye that he initially confuses the baby for a chicken. “A lot of people bring up the dead chicken,” Alda says of the episode, which he also co-wrote and directed. “I wrote that into the script because I had heard the story from two different wars. It probably happens in every war where civilians are hiding from enemy troops and you can’t control a crying baby except to maybe put your hand over his or her mouth. It can end tragically. People are moved by it. It’s a traumatic thing to hear about, to see depicted.“\n\n07 of 10\n\nBetsy's Wedding (1990)\n\nAlda wrote and starred in this romantic comedy, which features Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy as his daughters. It’s also the last project he directed. “I haven’t been interested in directing since then,” he explains. “One of the things I learned is that if you take on the job of directing, that’s your life for the next year or two. It has to be worth that much of your life to do.” Alda says the movie was based, in part, on the wedding of one of his daughters. “There was a beautiful tent and a terrible thunderstorm. I just took it further! Anthony LaPaglia was so good in that movie [as a loan shark’s henchman who falls for Sheedy]. At the first table read, instead of saying ‘Lutèce,’ the correct name of a restaurant, he said, ‘I have reservations at La Toose.’ He was talking as a not-very-well-educated Mafia guy. He was so good, I didn’t realize he was acting.”\n\n08 of 10\n\nWhat Women Want (2000)\n\nAlda’s memories of playing an ad agency boss to Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt aren’t very fond. “Mel got together with the writer and started cutting all my lines. Right in front of me! Mel thought the scene was too long but I explained to them a few minutes later you are cutting all the straight lines so the funny lines won’t be funny. You can’t just put a pencil through everything. But I didn’t argue about it. I just said, 'I’ll be in my f--king trailer.’\"\n\n09 of 10\n\nTower Heist (2011)\n\nWhile filming this Brett Ratner comedy—about employees of an apartment building (including Ben Stiller) looking to recoup their losses from the greedy architect of a Ponzi scheme (Alda)—the actor spent an unfortunate amount of time either locked in a truck or lying facedown on the pavement. “Every time I pass a spot in the street in Columbus Circle, I say to my wife, ‘That’s where I was facedown on the pavement for eight hours,’ ” says Alda,\n\nwho had one particularly harrowing day on set when things did not go according to plan. “I’m filming this scene where I’m in the back of a truck that turns over and I’m trying to escape,” he explains of what turned into an on-set mishap. “They got me in the truck, but then they couldn’t get the door back open. They had to take a welding device to try to make a hole in the screen between the cab and the back of the truck. Sparks flew into the back where there were all these oily rags; I thought I was going to blow up! They finally got the door open, and then I lied facedown on the pavement to play out the rest of the scene. This is the glamorous life of movie stars.\"\n\n10 of 10\n\nThe Good Fight (2018)\n\nGood news! We haven’t seen the last of Solomon Waltzer,\n\na legendary and very confident defense attorney who clashed with Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) and her firm’s lawyers for two episodes in the second season of Michelle and Robert Kings’ CBS All Access drama. “The character is trying to take over their business by\n\nstealing their clients,” explains Alda. “They asked me to come back to shoot something in February, but I haven’t seen a script yet.” One of Alda’s strengths is knowing you can count on him to deliver a great performance, regardless."
