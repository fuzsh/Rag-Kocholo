        "text": "What is Alan Alda's Net Worth and Salary?\n\nAlan Alda is an American actor, director, and writer who has a net worth of $50 million. Alda has earned his net worth through his many acting roles in stage, film, and television projects. He is also a voice actor and has written the books \"Never Have Your Dog Stuffed\" (2006), \"Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself\" (2007), and \"If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look on My Face?\" (2017).\n\nBest known for playing Hawkeye Pierce on the CBS series \"M*A*S*H\" (1972–1983), Alan has appeared in 65+ films and television series, including \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\" (1993), \"Canadian Bacon\" (1995), \"Everyone Says I Love You\" (1996), \"Tower Heist\" (2011), \"ER\" (1999), and \"The West Wing\" (2004–2006). Alda wrote numerous episodes of \"M*A*S*H\" as well as the films \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" (1979), \"The Four Seasons\" (1981), \"Sweet Liberty\" (1986), \"A New Life\" (1988), and \"Betsy's Wedding\" (1990), and he directed \"The Four Seasons,\" \"Sweet Liberty,\" \"A New Life,\" and more than 30 episodes of \"M*A*S*H.\" He has appeared in over a dozen Broadway productions, such as \"The Apple Tree\" (1966–1967), \"Jake's Women\" (1992), \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (2005), and \"Love Letters\" (2014).\n\nEarly Life\n\nAlan Alda was born Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo on January 28, 1936, in New York City. His father, Robert, was a singer and actor, and his mother, Joan, was a former beauty-pageant winner and a homemaker. Robert was born Alfonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D'Abruzzo, but he used the stage name Robert Alda, which he came up with by combining the first two letters of Alfonso and D'Abruzzo. As a child, Alan traveled around the country due to his father's job as a burlesque theatre performer. At age 7, Alan contracted polio, and for six months, he underwent treatment in which his parents wrapped \"scalding blankets…around his limbs every hour.\" He attended Archbishop Stepinac High School, and as a junior, he studied in Paris, appeared in a stage production in Rome, and performed on a televion show in Amsterdam with his father. Alda then enrolled at Fordham University, where he joined the ROTC, and he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1956. After college, he spent six months serving in the U.S. Army Reserve and was deployed to Korea. Alan's parents divorced in 1946, and Robert later married actress Flora Marino; Alda's half-brother, Anthony, was born in 1956.\n\nCareer\n\nIn the 1950s, Alan was a member of the improvisational comedy revue the Compass Players, and he joined the Cleveland Play House's acting company during the 1958–1959 season, appearing in productions of \"Heaven Come Wednesday,\" To Dorothy a Son,\" and \"Job.\" He made his television debut on a 1958 episode of \"The Phil Silvers Show\" and appeared in his first Broadway play, \"Only in America,\" in 1959.

He then appeared in the films \"Paper Lion\" (1968), \"The Extraordinary Seaman\" (1969), \"The Moonshine War\" (1970), \"The Mephisto Waltz\" (1971), and \"To Kill a Clown\" (1972). Alan's big break came in 1972 when he was cast as Captain Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce on \"M*A*S*H.\" He appeared in all 256 episodes of the series and earned numerous awards for his contributions as an actor, writer, and director. The 1983 series finale, which he wrote and directed, was the most-watched episode of any American TV series. While starring on \"M*A*S*H,\" Alda also appeared in several films, including \"Same Time, Next Year\" (1978) and \"California Suite\" (1978), as well as the television films \"Isn't It Shocking?\" (1973) and \"Kill Me If You Can\" (1977).\n\nAfter \"M*A*S*H\" ended, Alan wrote, directed, and starred in 1986's \"Sweet Liberty\" and 1988's \"A New Life,\" then appeared in the films \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" (1989) and \"Whispers in the Dark\" (1992) and the TV movie \"And the Band Played On\" (1993).

In 2000, he appeared in the film \"What Women Want,\" then portrayed Republican politician Owen Brewster in 2004's \"The Aviator\" and received an Oscar nomination for his performance. From 2004 to 2006, Alan appeared as Senator Arnold Vinick on 28 episodes of NBC's \"The West Wing,\" a role that earned him an Emmy.\n\nAlda then appeared in the films \"Resurrecting the Champ\" (2007), \"Flash of Genius\" (2008), and \"Nothing but the Truth\" (2008) and guest-starred on \"30 Rock\" in 2009 and 2010.
