For a century now, Taps has attempted to put into print the meaning and the ephemeral experience of a few short years spent at the finest school in South Carolina. The technology may have changed drastically, but the ritual of scrambling to produce photographs and copy remains constant. Many staffers have faced the conundrum of having to study for exams while meeting deadlines, but they always graduate and get a book out anyway. The successes have overwhelmed the few failures, and hopefully Taps' unending contributions to our beloved school's historical record will continue even a century from now. |VOLUME 55 T A P I 6 \\>*\\j T P i - i-r VOLUME 5* CLEMSON COLLEGE Jonathan Jordan Clemson University 2 0 0 8 HARDIN HALL Volume y8 * I TA'A 315 Hendrix Center Clemson, SC 29634 www.tapsyearbook.com i:siiT. liil — ii!Si!SW!B !IU!iM!M»lM; tfWvi* * Student Life Academics .■■*■■■ PI«IM!

When meeting with their advisors, students have to read and under- stand lots of forms that explain the suggested curriculum require- ments and the prerequisites. During orientation, students receive a lot of information and handouts, but they also have time for fun with social events planned in the evenings. \"Orientation was good because I was able to actually meet my advisor before registering for classes.\" -Sadie Cooke, freshman The Orientation Ambassadors are there to answer any questions students may have, including logistical questions about class registration, such as \"Is it possible to get from P&A to Tillman during class change?\" With many student organization representatives available to answer any questions or concerns, orientation is a great opportunity for parents and students to talk to someone who is \"in the know.\" Registering for classes is one of the biggest activities at Orienta- tion. Students meet with their advi- sors before registering in one of the on-campus computer labs. You could definitely feel it in the air, and you could almost touch it: the excite- ment of the class of 2011 to finally be at Clemson University as undergraduates. Orientation is always an exciting experience and this year was no different. Fresh- men and transfer students came from all over the country and world to get their first taste of college life. One of the highlights of the weekend came at the beginning of the sessions with the Orientation Ambassadors performing currently popular songs with the words switched up to reflect life at Clemson University. Each evening included social events for the students to hang out away from the always-present watchful eyes of the parents. For many present this was a chance to get to know the Clemson campus that is not seen on game days. At Orientation, one way to assuage freshman fears was with small group sessions facilitated by the Orientation Ambassadors— students were able to get to know each other and see familiar faces on campus when they moved in on August 18th. Another rite of passage occurred at Orientation: registering for classes. Each student met with his or her advisor and selected the classes that would best fulfill the degree plan without overwhelming the student.

It was long, but fun, and at the end of the day, I really felt like I had just moved into my new home.\" Sallie Anna Barton, freshman August 18th marked the start of a new experience for many students. At eight in the morning, 2,866 freshman, transfer, and international students began moving in to their newhome-away-from-home. It was a warm, sunny day, but despite the heat, energetic students and parents unpacked carloads of dorm room essentials. The First Year Experience (FYE) dorms the freshmen moved into were Lever, Man- ning, Byrnes, and Mauldin on east campus, and Johnstone, Geer, Cope, Benet, Young, and Sanders on west campus. FYE dorms are communities built to enhance the ex- perience of first-year students. Through the FYE program, students can find ways to get involved and make an easy transi- tion into college. Freshmen were not the only students involved with move-in. Residence hall staffers had returned to campus ten days prior to prepare for the students' arrival. Many cam- pus organizations were volunteering their time to help the students get all of their stuff up to their room. Move-in day ended with the first freshman social event: Freshman Frenzy on Bowman Field, which was a chance for new students to take a break from unpacking, get some food, and meet some of their new peers.

There is the stress of ■ .eaving home, moving in, starting classes, meeting new people, and recruitment. Recruitment is the process that stu- \\ dents undergo when they choose to rush a fraternity or sorority. About twenty percent of Clemson's undergraduates participate in Greek Life. Clemson's Greek community consists of three councils. The Interfraternity Council consists of 21 fraternities. The National Pan-Hellenic Council consists of 10 sororities. The College Pan-Hellenic Council consists of 9 sororities and fraternities. Through participation in a fraternity or sorority at Clemson University, students are able to learn leadership, academic, financial and philanthropic skills that they can take with them after graduation, in addition to the life-long friendship of their brothers and sisters. For the 2007 fall academic semester, 591 women and 587 men participated in recruitment. During the sorority recruitment process, women go through a selection process in which they visit all ten sorori- ties on the first day. \"The first day of rush is very hectic. We had to wake up very early and all ten sororities were in Littlejohn yelling and cheering. It was a very exhausting day,\" says Meghan Joseph, a junior, who went through the stressful week just two years ago. \"It's still very exhausting and stressful even after you join a sorority,\" she adds. As the week progresses, the women narrow down their decision until Bid Day, when the long wait is finally over and they become part of a new family. The men's recruitment week is a little less stressful. The week after sorority recruitment sees Bowman Field covered in fraternity tents as the men go from one to the other signing up to rush. Just like sorority recruit- ment, the men go to different \"parties\" all week, narrowing their decision. On Friday, the men receive their bid and celebrate with all the new broth- ers with Rush Blowout.

First Friday Parade has always been known for its floats and this year was no exception. 4. Sororities always partici- pate in the parade by build- ing floats around the year's theme and marching behind them during the parade. 5. This year's Miss First Friday was a representative from Alpha Delta Pi. The history of the First Friday parade began in 1974. Every year Central Spirit hosts the parade to celebrate the beginning of football season, but also to mark a tradition that has been a part of many memories over the years. This year the First Friday Parade was held on Sunday due to the televising of the Bowden Bowl on ESPN on Monday night. Students, parents, and local-area residents, came out to watch the parade make its way down Highway 93. Floats, designed by the sororities, were featured ie the Tiger Band, Rally Cats, Clemson cheerleaders, and many participating fans. At 3 end of the parade, fans gathered at Riggs Field for a school-wide pep rally, when everyone found out the winner of the title, Miss First Friday.

The rivalry between Clemson and the University of South Carolina has endured for over a hundred years, and will not be slowing down any time soon. Clemson continues to dominate their in-state rivals with a 64-37-4 record. Held at each school on alternate seasons, this year's game was a home game for USC, who hoped to win at Williams-Brice Stadium following four consecutive defeats. However, the Tigers managed two spectacular blocked kicks during the game, and kicker Mark Buchholz, despite missing two kicks earlier in the game, made a 35-yard kick as time expired to secure a 23-21 victory for Clemson. No matter if the rivalry game is held at home or away, Clemson fans show up in large numbers for the game. When it comes to fans, there is nothing quite like a Clemson Tiger.

Exam time on campus brings long nights i the library, cup after cup of caffeine, and the occasional much needed tudy break. Exams are the last obstacle students must endure before winter break and holiday fun. There are many ways students cope with tudying, which enables them to do their best.

It featured movies, speakers, and a Tunnel of Oppression, a dramatization of what some groups are exposed to. The week ended with a candlelight vigil. The week also included \"Green I Shoes,\" where green shoes were scattered around campus with notes attached, raising awareness about mental health issues. One World also hosts fund-rais- ers like Up 'Til Dawn, sponsoring St. Jude's Children Hospital and Relay-for-Life, raising money for the American Cancer Society.

Mardi Gras Traditions • French for \"Fat Tuesday,\" Mardi Gras is the last day of Carnival, the three days preceding Lent, taking place the day before Ash Wednesday. The most popular celebration of this day in the United States is in New Orleans. This celebration features music, parades, floats, and other celebratory events to squeeze in before the start of Lent. If you are one to attend Mardi Gras, you will be surrounded by green, gold, and purple (the official colors of Mardi Gras), people in costumes, and of course, beads thrown from the floats that spectators catch and bring home as a memory of a great celebration. ^^ tf ^^- ^T^JB Two girls are advised about the future by the fortune teller.

No more sweating in the summer and freezing in the winter! The advantages of riding a motorcycle or moped: - Parking convenience is second to none. - Easy to navigate tight spots around campus. Navigating around Clemson campus can be tricky, especially on crowded home football game days in the fall. Depending on a student's needs, means of transportation may differ. For students living on campus, walking is the most popular way to go. However, some who live in dorms or in campus apartments often need a quick way to class in the morning and choose to ride bikes to class. Those riding bikes are notorious for side-swiping innocent bystanders during the fifteen minute scramble between classes. An equally convenient but less common way of getting around is on motorcycle or moped. Many buildings on campus have special parking spaces practically at their front doors purely for those who choose to get to class this way. For students living off campus or in Lightsey Bridge, the CAT bus system is a life saver. The system saw a huge increase in the number of riders this year, as the Red Route from Central was expanded. Students lined up waiting for the Orange Route to the parking lots or the Blue Route to Seneca are also a common sight. Whether on campus or off, students were provided with several choices for making it to classes on time. They have no excuses for being late!

Lots of rituals have grown up around the tailgating institution, like the increasingly popular \"Cornhole.\" The objective is to toss a bag of corn through a hole in a wooden box twenty feet away. Since people are waiting for kickoff, tossing a football around is a logical component of tailgating on game days.

Jones. Named for legendary Coach Frank Howard, the rock was placed atop a pedestal on September 24, 1966. Before the Clemson-Wake Forest game on Sep- tember 23, 1967, Howard told his players they were oil able to rub the rock if they were going to give him 1 1(| percent in the game. After a 23-6 victory over Wake Forest, a tradition was born. Story by Elizabeth Ingr< Traditions Ring Ceremony Clemson is steeped in tradition, be it running down the Hill into Death Valley or he annual construction of Homecoming displays, but one of the most notable is he ring ceremony. The ceremony is co-sponsored by the Clemson University Alumni Association and the Student Alumni Association. University rings are offered only to students who have completed ninety credit hours. At the ceremony, students hear from alumni whose rings have meant much to them and also learn the detailed history Df the ring's elements. Though Clemson rings date to the 1890s. the modern ring comes from 1940. A | group of architecture seniors decided at that time to design a ring that would be seen and recognized by Clemson students and alumni from all over the world. In uly of that year, their design was adopted as the official Clemson University ring. Z When women were admitted in 1955. another style of ring was designed and ^ accepted for the women in time for the first female graduates in 1957.

These projects are necessary to improve the condition of Clemson's campus. Whether it is makin an older building look new, adapting old technology to keep up with today's demands, or making a librar more comfortable for hard-working Clemson students, keeping the campus up-to-date is a key ste to fulfill President Barker's goal of becoming a Top 20 school. Story by Tyler LaCross Construction This year, several major Clemson landmarks underwent much-needed construction and renovation. Among the buildings chosen for construction projects are the Cooper Library, the steam plant in the University Facility Operations building, and Riggs Hall. Since students arrived on campus this fall, the Cooper Library lawn has been partially covered with construction materials and equipment for an overhaul of the library's HVAC system. Upon its completion, the library will be a more comfortable place for hard- working students to study. The steam plant next to the stadium is also receiving some upgrades. The baghouse, a filter that removes excess coal from the plant's exhaust, is being replaced. The new baghouse will remove 100% of the unburned coal from the plant's exhaust, which is equal to the removal of several tons of coal particulate daily from the plant's exhaust. This $3.2 million project is scheduled to be completed in March of 2008.

After polling many students regarding the best places to eat, live, and spend free time, it is apparent Clemson has many bests. The most popular places to eat are Mac's Drive-In, Pot-Belly Deli, Calhoun Corners, and Sonic Drive-In. Many students believe University Ridge, Crawford Falls, and The Retreat are the best places to live, while the best places to spend free time are Bowman Field and Larry W. Abernathy Waterfront Park.

But as soon as school is in session, the itch returns for a break from the long nights of studying that run into early mornings, the endless hours in Cooper library, and the pages of mind-numbing reading for class. Breaks give students a chance to let loose and travel. Some go home and visit their parents and relatives, some opt for a mission trip or a convention for a club, while others go for a weekend hiking and camping in the Blue Ridge mountains. Some take trips to visit friends at other universities, some take trips without set destinations. However they use their time, students know that they have an opportunity to relax, cool off, and take a badly needed break from the burden of classes, projects, presentations, and tests. Even if the summer is spent working, a three-month hiatus from schoolwork can still be refreshing.

The efforts of faculty and staff have already improved the quality of undergraduate and graduate programs, but despite the impressive achievements, there remains more work ahead. Some of the initiative's goals already fulfilled include the establishment of a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, which will ncrease the value of a Clemson degree. Physical improvements for the Cooper library, better the resources available :o students and the community. A capital campaign raising $250 million allowed Clemson to commission more research n every department. Clemson is attracting more top students, therefore achieving higher graduating averages. \"In order to maintain the momentum that has brought us from 74th nine years ago to 27th today in the US news ankings,\" said President Barker, \"we need to continue to attract the brightest and best students, to increase resources o attract the best faculty, and to improve academic support services to help students stay in school and graduate.\" Future goals for the school include producing a Rhodes Scholar and perhaps a national championship football team, rhe University plans to build a new Academic Success Center, in order to improve academic support services, bolster students' grades, and help them to graduate on time. Why is Clemson so committed to this initiative? Students from a higher ranked universities are proven to be more ikely to graduate on time, earn higher starting salaries, and to be admitted to the best graduate programs and professional schools. Top universities are better able to generate external funding, more spin-off and start-up :ompanies, and attract more knowledge-based industries to cluster around them. This allows for increases in the economic support and per capita income in the university's state and region. President Barker said, \"It is a win-win-win situation for the university, its students and alumni, and its region.\" As Clemson continues this difficult, but rewarding journey, students, faculty, staff, and the whole community are jenefiting. Clemson is the midst of a great change that will increase the value of being a student and the value of being in alumni. Ik to, Story by April Wade t_a 1 1 • - ,^m ■ ^i US >WJ / 6.

Due to Johnson's address, they began to understand why the book was chosen and started to appreciate and comprehend their reading. Clemson's administration and organizers of the Summer Reading Program wanted to stimulate questions and conversations amongst the incoming class. It is very important for students to not only interact with one another socially and academically, but also interact with the Clemson faculty. Clemson University President, James Baker commented in his letter to 2007 freshmen, \"The Summer Reading Program activities are the types of activi- ties that are valued in college courses: critically reading a text, forming ideas based on your reading, discussing those ideas with faculty and other students, and writing about the ideas that grow out of your reading, talking, and listening The close faculty-student interaction is at the heart of what it means to be a university.\" ^ ' Story by Jessica Davis Most students brought their copies host Map with them.
