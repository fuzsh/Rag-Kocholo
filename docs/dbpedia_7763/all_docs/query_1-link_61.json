        "text": "The Gaza Nazi \"I wish we had video footage in Auschwitz,\" is a sentiment echoed by many a survivor. I am not so sure. Consider what Eichmann would say to Wolf Blitzer: \"The Jews gas themselves so that Churchill has an excuse to bomb our cities.\" Meanwhile young Nazis parade through Berlin to the slogan, \"From the river (Danube) to the (Black) sea, Austria will be free.\" It's not just Jews, most everyone at the Washington Post believe that exposing evil will naturally make it disappear. But just like physical illness, diseases of the mind don't wash away through good wishes. In fact, the Talmud explains that the hardest thing to understand is hate (Avoda Zora 4a). For over 70 years the Western World has been desperately trying to wash away hate. The communists thought they could do it by eliminating money. You can laugh now, but at the time a lot of people took it seriously. The Western World bought into a philosophy that has gone through various iterations (think DEI), that by eliminating racism, bigotry and discrimination, we can all live as one. The fall of the Berlin Wall put a nail in the Communist Manifesto, similarly on October 7th, Hamas ruined many a Harvard PhD thesis. Why hasn't the multitude of anti-bigotry Hollywood movies, books and articles resulted in a single march by non-Jews against the obscene hatred running rampant throughout the world? Of the 8 billion people, is no one outraged?!!!! Didn't white people march for black people? Straight people protest for gays? And didn't everyone stand up for women's rights? So why is no one marching for the Jews? The answer is easy to understand. We cannot remove hatred by attacking those that hate. It's simply exchanging one hatred for another. It might be justified, but by the laws of spiritual physics it's no more elevating to the human condition. If you want humanity to treat people with love, there really is only one way, teach them to love. Obviously. Duh! So if it's so obvious, why isn't it being done? It is. Everyone thinks they are doing that very thing! Abusive people don't think they are abusive. The co-worker who is always putting you down would be shocked and deny any abusive intent. That goes for your sibling, neighbor and sometimes even your parent. They think they are being good, righteous and even loving. Listen to the rhetoric coming out of Hamas. It's filled with righteousness. The very difficult conclusion is that if you feel you have been mistreated or abused, then all the \"love\" you are giving is really just more abuse. You cannot erase hate EXCEPT with true love. And the only people who can give true love are those that truly believe they have been loved, and have always been loved. The reason Israel specifically, and Jews in general, give out love instead of hate, is because to be a Jew means you know in your bones you are loved. And that is why they hate us.\n\nIn the last few weeks, we have seen our Israeli unity cracking and crumbling due to irresponsibility, all for the sake of the Gods of the like and the share. The skit \"Eretz Nehederet\" shows two casualty officers who come to report on an IDF fallen, only to accidentally arrive at the home of a man who complains about them for disturbing his rest or his religious studies. The image of an IDF soldier wearing the Chasidic clothing evoked feelings of fusion and connection, but immediately jumped some \"good hearts\" people who had to emphasize that he is a repentant 'kibbutznik' and not ultra-orthodox by birth. What hurts is not only the sadness that those good souls form our strong nuclear force, the unity around sacrifice out of mutual guarantee, but that it violates the most basic principles of negotiation - the same negotiation that the secular sector conducts with the ultra-orthodox sector and vice versa around the issue of conscription. 1. Focus on Interests, Not Positions In the book \"Getting to Yes\" by Prof. Roger Fisher and Prof. William Yuri from Harvard, they describe the importance of looking beyond the statements made by both sides and focusing on their interests. What is important to them, what motivates them, and what they are willing to die for. What is their fifth \"why\" according to Toyota's method. This is a method whose goal is to understand the other party's real needs in the negotiation, and it simply needs to sit around one table over a cup of coffee and ask him \"What are the things that are most important to you?\" Then five times \"Why?\". The last answer is the deepest need of that person. 2. Another principle Fischer and Yuri raise in their book is separating people from the Problem. Focus on the problem to be solved and not on personality or emotional differences between the parties. In \"Eretz Nehederet's\" video, there is a complete focus on the difference, on the infuriating dissonance between the parties, which is reflected in their different moods, which emphasizes the connection to the plight of those wearing the uniforms compared to the disconnection on the ultra-Orthodox side wearing the black ones. There is a complete disregard for the interest of all of us - to bring about equality in the burden and move towards a more united and healthy society. In an argument, both sides are almost always right. Is it more critical today than ever to integrate ultra-orthodox into the IDF? The answer is yes. Is sticking fingers in each other's eyes in prime time or on the networks the way? No. So, allow me to put aside the honorable Prof. Fischer and Prof. Yuri for just a moment and quote one of the greats of our generation, Idan Amedi, saying - \"He who has nothing good to say should shut his mouth.\" It's time for a change. The desire is on both sides. Let's do it with a hug, understanding, guarantee, unity. Let's not give our enemies the pleasure of seeing us move away, again. We were already in this movie.\n\nIn the last few weeks, we have seen our Israeli unity cracking and crumbling due to irresponsibility, all for the sake of the Gods of the like and the share.

The series \"A Small Light\" delves deeply into the turmoil and fear of this period, particularly highlighting the immense sacrifices Jews made for survival and their indomitable spirit. In this historical context, the Nazis established various types of concentration camps, including labor camps, work camps, and extermination camps. The primary aim of these camps was to implement the Nazis' \"Final Solution,\" systematically exterminating Jews and other groups deemed \"inferior.\" Many Jews were forced to leave their homes, enduring inhumane conditions, starvation, disease, and the constant threat of death. \"A Small Light\" is set against the backdrop of Vienna and Amsterdam, narrating the story of Miep Gies and how she helped Otto Frank and his family evade Nazi capture. Otto Frank was the father of Anne Frank, the famous diarist. Although they hid during the war, they ultimately could not escape being caught. This historical account not only reveals the brutality of the Nazis but also showcases the kindness and courage inherent in humanity. Throughout this ordeal, many ordinary Europeans risked their lives to provide Jews with food, shelter, and forged documents, aiding their escape from Nazi persecution. From this history, we can discern significant flaws in human civilization. The society of that time was rife with prejudice and ignorance, leading to large-scale genocide. However, this dark history also illuminates the brighter side of human nature, demonstrating that even under extreme oppression, kindness and courage can shine through. This spirit of mutual aid is a cornerstone of social progress, deserving of our contemplation and appreciation. Comparing the World War II era with modern society, we can see that the advancement of civilization and scientific development has gradually eradicated many past prejudices and ignorance. Our society has made remarkable progress in terms of law, morality, and human rights. Nevertheless, modern society still faces numerous challenges, such as racial discrimination, religious conflicts, and social injustice. The progress of civilization is not achieved overnight; it requires continuous effort to promote social progress and fairness. \"A Small Light\" not only helps us understand historical truths but also teaches us valuable lessons. This history tells us that human civilization needs to endure hardships to truly progress. We should cherish the peace and freedom we have now while reflecting on our society, striving to eliminate all forms of prejudice and discrimination, and letting the light of civilization shine on every corner.\n\n“PALESTINE” IS THE NAZI WEAPON THAT SEEKS TO FINISH HITLER’S FINAL SOLUTION – part 2 written by David Mark January 10, 2024 The Mufti’s alliance with the Nazis at the start of World War Two is well documented. In the summer of 1940 and again in February 1941, al-Husseini submitted to the Nazi German Government a draft declaration of German-Arab cooperation, containing a clause Germany and Italy recognize the right of the Arab countries to solve the question of the Jewish elements, which exist in Palestine and in the other Arab countries, as required by the national and ethnic (völkisch) interests of the Arabs, and as the Jewish question was solved in Germany and Italy. He asked Adolf Hitler for a public declaration that “recognized and sympathized with the Arab struggles for independence and liberation, and that would support the elimination of a national Jewish homeland”. Hitler refused to make such a public announcement, but asked al-Husseini “to lock …deep in his heart” the following points, which Christopher Browning who is considered a specialist on the Holocaust summarizes as follows, that Germany has resolved, step by step, to ask one European nation after the other to solve its Jewish problem, and at the proper time, direct a similar appeal to non-European nations as well. When Germany had defeated Russia and broken through the Caucasus into the Middle East, it would have no further imperial goals of its own and would support Arab liberation… But Hitler did have one goal. “Germany’s objective would then be solely the destruction of the Jewish element residing in the Arab sphere under the protection of British power”. (Das deutsche Ziel würde dann lediglich die Vernichtung des im arabischen Raum unter der Protektion der britischen Macht lebenden Judentums sein). In short, Jews were not simply to be driven out of the German sphere but would be hunted down and destroyed even beyond it. The injection of Nazi ideology into the “palestinian” national movement explains the obsession the “palestinian” leadership and the common people below them have with hunting down and killing Jews wherever they are. None of this is about having a state of their own. After all the Mufti supported a greater Syria, which would have meant no “palestinian” state. And when they were offered a “palesitnian” state – he and others rejected it. What is clear is the “palestinians” entire goal is the finishing of Hitler’s Final Solution. Peace will only come to the Middle East when the Nazis who reside in it are completely wiped out. Until then the genocide against the Jews will continue.\n\nNot a long, long time ago, Nazi Germany came to power and wreaked havoc and devastation on the world. If you learned some of the history of Nazi Germany, you may have come across the term “Mischlinge”. Mischlinge was a term that denoted hybrid, mongrel or half breed. It referred to those who were part Jewish and part \"Aryan\", a race concept in the obsolete racial grouping dogma of the time. The Nuremberg racial laws of 1935 used this classification to isolate and exclude Jews from the rest of German society. At first, those who were classified as Mischlinge were “only” discriminated against, and not sent to the gas chambers. But it was not long before all persons having at least one Jewish grandparent were classified as completely Jewish and were sent to extermination or forced labor in the death camps. Just to point out, this was not about being religious, or observant. There were people in Nazi Germany who did not consider themselves Jewish at all and some considered themselves to be anything but. Some of those people did not even know they had any Jewish lineage. That did not matter. The Nazis dug up history records and ancestry records and found out. Many of those people ended up in the death camps. One Jewish grandparent is all it took. Why am I telling you this? I am a proud Jew and a proud Zionist, and I wouldn’t have it any other way or trade that for the world. Someone like me already knows the bad guys are out to get us regardless. If you are not Jewish or a Zionist, however, you may find it interesting to know that under a certain ideology, under a certain government rule, not too long ago, you may have been considered to be Jewish too. #StandwithIsrael #StopAntisemitism #ProudZionist I stand with Israel.
