How about West River Overlooks, the Bicentennial Park, Beaver Island, \"the fort\" we never needed a reason to party just a place to do it. How about midnight raccoon hunting expositions to Navy Island in November? Oh yeh, that's Canadian land, isn't it? Waking up on Bruce Allen's couch in the morning to be greeted by his mother's smile. Looking for trouble with Lefty, Gieser, Pumpkinhead and the boys. Can't forget diving from the top of the first arch of the Grand Island bridge. I guess it was some kind of male bonding thing. Today it all seems insane. First loves, first broken hearts, and just about first everything. I have been around the world and talked to many people, yet I have never found a place or people that could compare with you. Got bless and keep you safe.\"\n\n11/28/99 : Suzie (Burk) Ryan Resident 1951-99, Class of '66\n\n11/28/99 : Kristina Tetkowski Resident 1983 to present, Class of 2001 comments: \"Well, at this point in life, I'm stuck on this random piece of land surrounded by this mote.

I just wanted to say hello to everyone. I recently moved away from NY. I was in Albany for 10 years and now I find myself living in the land of rednecks and Confederate flags. My family and I moved to Waycross, GA, so if any Islanders get down south and need a rest, just stop on by and say Howdy! Oh yeah, it is 65 degrees here and it is 10 p.m. on the 21st of November.

In case you were wondering, we did not move until after the Blizzard of '77. I went to St. Stephen's through 3rd grade. I used to enjoy fishing in the river and going to Beaver Island Park. I also enjoyed playing football and baseball in the G.I. little leagues. I played on the G. I. Falcons and the Cubs. I still have a lot of relatives in the area and visit Buffalo regularly. Send me an email if you remember myself or my family. My siblings are Bob, Sue and Pat Doran. For you sports fans who have been through the four Super Bowls and now a Stanley loss, I feel your pain. I am still a big fan of the Buffalo teams. I am also now a fan of the Atlanta teams. So between the Bills, Sabres, Braves and now the Falcons, I am 1-10 in the big championship game and or series.

My best memories are of the great teachers I had at Sidway --especially when one considers the state of public education today. I felt fortunate to be able to send my daughter to private school, although I know that the education she received was in no way superior to my experience. She still thinks that I am \"her smartest mother.\" Having lived south of the Mason-Dixon line for lmost 30 years, I can't imaging living through another Grand Island winter, although the thoughts of moderate summer temperatures (compared to DC) are most appealing. We come back once or twice a year and I am constantly amazed at the changes.
