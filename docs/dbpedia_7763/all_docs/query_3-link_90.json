        "text": "The article below uses “Three Close Reads”. If you want to learn more about this strategy, click here.\n\nFirst read: preview and skimming for gist\n\nBefore you read the article, you should skim it first. The skim should be very quick and give you the gist (general idea) of what the article is about. You should be looking at the title, author, headings, pictures, and opening sentences of paragraphs for the gist.\n\nSecond read: key ideas and understanding content\n\nNow that you’ve skimmed the article, you should preview the questions you will be answering. These questions will help you get a better understanding of the concepts and arguments that are presented in the article. Keep in mind that when you read the article, it is a good idea to write down any vocab you see in the article that is unfamiliar to you.\n\nBy the end of the second close read, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n\nDescribe the Italian peninsula before 1800. How were political communities organized?\n\nHow did Napoleon help start Italian nationalism?\n\nWhy did the revolutions of 1848 fail to create a unified Italy?\n\nWhat helped Count Cavour succeed in defeating the Austrians and establishing the Kingdom of Italy in 1861?\n\nThird read: evaluating and corroborating\n\nFinally, here are some questions that will help you focus on why this article matters and how it connects to other content you’ve studied.\n\nAt the end of the third read, you should be able to respond to these questions:\n\nMost nationalist histories are told from the perspective of great men. How do you think the story is different when told from the perspective of a common woman?\n\nThe woman in this narrative experienced a lot in her lifetime. Using the communities frame, make a list of the different identities she might have had and the different communities of which she was a part.\n\nNow that you know what to look for, it’s time to read! Remember to return to these questions once you’ve finished reading.\n\nA Risorgimento life\n\nYour unpublicized political life was shaped by three famous men. They disagreed on ideology, but united under the cause of Italian unification—or Risorgimento, meaning \"revival.\" They were:\n\nCount Cavour – a liberal monarchist who wanted a united Italy ruled under a constitution by the king of Piedmont-Sardinia.\n\nGiuseppe Mazzini – a republican who refused to compromise on his ideals. He wanted the end of monarchy and an Italian republic.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi – a true radical. After a failed 1834 uprising in Genoa he was sentenced to death, but didn't like that idea much so he fled to South America and fought in Uruguay and Brazil. A brilliant general and guerilla fighter, Garibaldi became an international celebrity. He died in his bed in 1882 at the age of 74.\n\nThree different men, all Italian nationalists. Across Italy, men and women of every political ideology took up the tri-color flag of Italian nationalism. Conservative Catholics, monarchists, liberals, republicans, and socialists all called themselves nationalists.\n\nWhen you were a young girl, your father joined the Carbonari, a secret society devoted to revolutionary ideals and resistance to Austrian control. In 1820, revolts in the south inspired uprisings in northern Italy. Your father and other Carbonari headed to Milan, where he died on an Austrian bayonet in 1821. Several years later, you met your husband and moved to Genoa (a city in the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia). Your late father would not have approved.\n\nDuring the 1830s, new rebellions erupted all over Europe. You first saw Garibaldi in Genoa during his failed uprising. The march of the Austrian army soon crushed the dream of a united Italy. Yet, the nationalist fervor that these years had sparked didn't die. You, your friends, and many others were convinced that Risorgimento was not some fantasy. It would happen, and you would help make it happen.\n\nThese failed revolutions meant that a bunch of Italian nationalists went into exile, either in the Americas or in Europe. There, figures like Mazzini lived comfortable lives as celebrities. There, they plotted with each other about their revenge, safe from Austrian bayonets. You stayed in Italy.\n\nA fire across Europe\n\nIn 1848, Europe erupted in revolution. In Rome and Palermo, Tuscany and Naples, Milan and Venice, revolutionaries took to the streets, demanding constitutions. Charles Albert, king of Piedmont-Sardinia, marched to the aid of Milan and Venice and waged war against Austria, hoping to unite northern Italy under a Sardinian flag. This was what convinced you to sign on with Garibaldi.\n\nIn the autumn of 1848, you joined Garibaldi's volunteer army as they fought a guerilla war on their way from Venice to Rome. Soon after your arrival, the revolutionaries—including Mazzini—declared a new Roman Republic. It was in Rome, during a few shining months of revolutionary victory, that you met Anita. She was Garibaldi's wife, a Brazilian, whom he had met in South America. A fearless fighter, Anita taught Garibaldi to ride a horse and became his comrade in arms.\n\nThe Roman Republic lasted a glorious few months. But—as was the case in all the 1848 revolutions across Europe—the disunity of the Italian revolutionaries was their downfall. Florentines failed to cooperate with Romans, and republicans failed to cooperate with monarchists. The dream of a united Italy crumbled. In the north, the Austrians defeated Charles Albert and he was replaced by his son, Victor Emmanuel. The Austrian army once again marched across Italy, crushing the rebellions. The last two cities to remain free were Venice and Rome.\n\nAfter pressure from French Catholics, the French army marched to Rome to put the Pope back in control. Garibaldi's army, which included you, won two brilliant victories against larger armies. But the counter-revolutionary forces were too many. The republic fell, and you fled the city with Garibaldi and a few hundred others. Two months later, Venice fell to the Austrians. As you fled Rome in 1849, Anita, who was pregnant, died of malaria shortly before she would have been 28. The rest of you made it to safety in Genoa and Garibaldi fled to exile in New York, Mazzini to Switzerland. You stayed in Italy."
