        "text": "It’s a medical mystery: Why are most people born with two kidneys when it is possible to live a full, healthy life with only one of these blood-filtering organs?\n\n“Nobody knows why most people are born with two kidneys when we really only need one,” says Christina Klein, M.D., a transplant nephrologist at Piedmont Transplant Institute.\n\nDr. Klein says she likes to use percentages when describing normal kidney function in different patient groups:\n\nPeople born with both kidneys: 100 percent\n\nPeople born with only one kidney: 75 percent\n\n“Before they were born, [a person with only one kidney] developed more kidney tissue than you would have expected with just one kidney,” explains Dr. Klein.\n\nPatients who had a kidney removed for health reasons or organ donation: Initially 50 percent post-surgery, but increases to 75 percent over time.\n\nStudies show that when someone donates a kidney or has one surgically removed, their initial function post-surgery is 50 percent. However, over time, thanks to a hyperfiltration process and tissue growth, function increases to 75 percent.\n\nLiving kidney donation\n\n“When we counsel people who are interested in donating a kidney, we stress to them the importance of a healthy lifestyle long-term to preserve the function of the kidney they have left,” she says.\n\nPeople interested in donating a kidney must go through a rigorous screening process for pre-existing kidney disease and risk factors for future kidney disease.\n\nDr. Klein recommends the following for patients to maximize their health with only one kidney:\n\nMaintain a healthy weight\n\nGet regular exercise\n\nFollow a nutritious diet low in salt and fat\n\nLife after living kidney donation\n\n“I don’t understand why people are born with two kidneys, but I’m very grateful we are able to live with one kidney because it not only enables us to do kidney transplants successfully, but it also enables us to do kidney transplants from living donors,” says Dr. Klein.\n\nNot only is it possible to donate a kidney to someone else, but most donors do not have to worry about long-term health consequences.\n\n“We know that someone who passes the donor screening and is able to donate a kidney to a loved one can live a nice, healthy, long life with just one remaining kidney,” she says.\n\nTo learn more about living kidney donation, visit Piedmont Transplant Institute."
