        "text": "Barolo, giving the region and Piedmont wine much of its fame, will make anyone fall in love. It is home to some of the most romantic, picturesque panoramas of vines which look like a seamlessly woven tapestry, where not a single stitch has been missed.\n\nPiedmont literally translates to the foot of the mountains, the Alps specifically, and the panoramas and 360 degree views are breathtaking in this zone. When it's foggy, as often happens, the hilltop watchtowers and castles emerge like little islands in the clouds.\n\nEvery square inch is covered with vines in this land, where a hectare will set you back well over a million dollars these days - one of the only places in the world where vines yield more money than construction of buildings.\n\nWith a history of more than 2,500 years, we'll stick to the more famous versions of Barolo, like 1268, when we find the first written notes stored in the castle of Rivoli, of “Nibiol\", which starts to put Nebbiolo and this zone on the map. Through the Renaissance, this grape will grow in extensively in popularity.\n\nThe word \"Barol\" is put on the map in 1751 (also when the first cru of Barolo is named - Cannubi) when a group of diplomats send barrels of wine named as such, which makes such an impact that it inspires Thomas Jefferson to make beautiful notes in his diary, albeit for a wine which at that time was sweet and sparkling and not the one we are familiar with today.\n\nThe French Influence\n\nThe \"modern\" Barolo we consume today - modern simply meaning dry, red wine - was born around 1830, and the credit is very likely due to the Marquis Falletti's marriage to Juliette Colbert or the Marquesa del Barolo, Louis Oudart and Count Camillo Benso di Cavour. Marquis Carlo Tancredi Falletti married a French noblewoman whose palate had been refined by the best (and dry wines) of France, meaning Bordeaux and Burgundy. With the passing of her husband, she inherited the vineyards and invited Louis Oudart, famous French enologist, to refine the wines to her liking. Even the Count of Cavour had asked Oudart to assist in winemaking for his family estates, and from this point the French traditions and culture forever permeated the area, blending two exceptional heritages.\n\nThe cliché phrase of a 'Wine for the Kings and King of the Wines' has been attached to this wine and often gives the assumption that Barolo is the king and Barbaresco is the queen, or less powerful and lighter than Barolo. Fortunately this concept is not being spoken about as much anymore (in fact most winemakers in the area roll their eyes when asked about it), as it is well-known that there are plenty of Barbarescos which are more powerful than Barolos (think Gaja for example). This is especially the case with wines which come from the north of Barolo, where you find more of a presence of sandstone versus the famous blue marl clay, which tends to make for more powerful, austere wines.\n\nThe immensity of food culture cannot be properly summed up here, but there's just enough in this guide to get the taste buds dancing and set the stage for a future organoleptic epiphany when you visit.\n\nLocal Cheeses - A few traditional cheeses standing out in this region are the Montebore, made from raw cow and sheep's milk and one of the most quintessential pairings to Timorasso, Castelmagno, made in the mountain pastures and often used in risotto or gnocchi, and Robiola del Roccaverano, which is made of a mix of goat, sheep and cow's milk, only available in the winter when goats are producing milk, soft and firm and ideal to compliment Arneis or other acidic white wines.\n\nPastas - Tajarin al ragu, or with the famous white truffles of Alba which cost their weight in gold (literally) is a dish I eat 5 times in 5 days when in Piedmont. One must be oblivious to the fact that 40 egg yolks are used per kilo of pasta, otherwise, it would be incomprehensible to consume (or bring your Lipitor). Ironically, this pasta is so delicate and angelic that you never feel heavy after it, even if the famous salsiccia di Bra is used in the ragù. The other dish is Agnolotti del plin made with folded, flattened pasta and stuffed with roasted meats, decadently dressed with butter and sage (other versions exist). I often say \"how do people not get tired of eating the same traditional foods?\" but I could easily eat these plates every night of the week for years with no trouble - they're exquisitely delicious!\n\nMeats - Fassona, the famous Piemontese beef, will commonly be found as beef tartare or vitello tonnato - thin slices of veal served chilled with a tuna-flavored mayonnaise sauce, which may sound like an odd coupling but is stunningly elegant.\n\nLast to mention are the famous hazelnuts which grow in lower elevations not suitable for the vines, in an ideal terroir with perfect temperatures, on the low part of the slopes which help drain the soils. Yes, this is the home of the famous Nutella, but try the more artisan hazelnut spreads when you are in this zone!"
