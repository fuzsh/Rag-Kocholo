I have been thinking about Kafka and Italian literature since I wrote my dissertation, although the book is completely distinct from it. Mark M. Anderson and his vast Kafka knowledge were inspirational from the beginning. His focus on thorough research and emphasis on historical context prompted me to follow Kafka’s Italian trails in ­detail. Martin Puchner’s insightful questions about the particularities of ­Italian literary history have repeatedly led me to reconsider the framework of the project. His advice and intellectual generosity have been guiding forces. Italianist friends from graduate school, Stephen Twilley, Lillyrose Veneziano Broccia, Juliet Nusbaum, Susanne Knittel, Rebecca Bauman, Vlad Vintila, and Gabrielle Elissa Popoff have probably all heard more about Kafka and Italy than they wanted to over the years. I am grateful to have been with them during a formative time and to continue to learn from them. The two years spent in the company of Barbara Spackman, Mia Fuller, Albert Ascoli, and the late Steven Botterill at the University of California at Berkeley offered me the chance to have valuable conversations, teach productive courses, and present my research to them and their great graduate students. They created a welcoming space for the book to develop. Mia also, this time in Durham, was especially encouraging during the final stages of the book. I am grateful to my colleagues at Duke, Roberto Dainotto, Luciana Fellin, Kata Gellen, Martin Eisner, Helen Solterer, Matteo Gilebbi, Laura Lieber, Michael Valdes Moses, Malachi Hacohen, Norman Keul, Toril Moi, Richard Rosa, and Gennifer Weisenfeld, who have supported me and my work in various ways. Thank you for your conversations, comments, and understanding. Thank you also to the exemplary librarians\n\nviii Acknowledgments\n\nof Perkins, Lilly, and interlibrary loan for making my research possible. I am especially fortunate to have at Duke my Kafka friend, Kata G ­ ellen, who read the entire manuscript, was always available to talk (often about Kafka), and co-directed the 2014–15 Franklin Humanities Center and Philosophy, Arts, and Literature Mellon seminar, “Whose Kafka,” with me. This seminar also led to having productive conversations with several scholars, including Ruth V. Gross, Vivian Liska, J­ean-Michel Rabaté, Davide Stimilli, and John Zilcosky, whose thoughts and work have been fundamental to my concept of Kafka. Especially since there are not many scholars who study German and Italian literature, it has been a pleasure to encounter several g ­ enerous and friendly scholars in this comparative field. The perspectives of Thomas Harrison, Elena Coda, Elizabeth Schächter, and Salvatore ­Pappalardo have all been motivating. Because comparative work requires thinking about different ­audiences, I am grateful for the conferences and invited lectures where I have spoken about parts of my book. Mimmo Cangiano’s intellectual energy, whether from afar or in person in Durham or ­Jerusalem, is ­ always appreciated. The research group Storia e mappe digitali della ­letteratura tedesca in Italia nel Novecento: editoria, campo letterario, ­interferenza gave me a chance to speak to its especially knowledgeable members, including Michele Sisto, Daria Biagi, Anna Baldini, and Irene Fantappiè, about my project in Rome in 2014. A few ideas from the introduction and chapter 5 have appeared in ­edited volumes and journals: “Kafka and Italy: A New Perspective on the Italian Literary Landscape” in Franz Kafka for the ­Twenty-First ­Century (Rochester, NY: Camden House, 2011), edited by Ruth V. Gross and ­Stanley Corngold; “Primo Levi and Jewish Kafka in ­Italy” in the ­special issue, “Kafka and the Holocaust,” of the ­Journal of the Kafka ­Society of America, vol. 35/36 (2012), edited by Maria Luise C ­ aputo-Mayr; “­Svevo’s Dogs: Kafka and the Importance of Svevo’s Animals” in Italo Svevo and His Legacy for the Third Millennium, vol. 2 (Leicester, UK: Troubador, 2014), edited by Giuseppe Stellardi and ­Emanuela ­Tandello Cooper; and “­Morante and Kafka: The Gothic W ­ alking Dead and ­Talking ­Animals” in Elsa Morante’s Politics of W ­ riting: ­Rethinking ­Subjectivity, History and the Power of Art (Madison, NJ: ­Fairleigh ­Dickinson ­University Press, 2015), edited by Stefania ­ Lucamante. These scholars’ conferences, ­panels, and editing raised questions that I continued to consider as I developed the book. For the last stages of the book, I have been grateful to find such a ­responsive and thoughtful editor in Mark Thompson at the U ­ niversity of Toronto Press. The two anonymous readers offered generous, thorough,\n\nAcknowledgments ix\n\nand productive feedback that greatly improved the book manuscript. I very much appreciate their time and kind consideration. The copy editor, Stephanie Stone, has been both a pleasure to work with and thorough. The kind individuals who read chapters, Roberto Dainotto, Kata Gellen, Gabrielle Elissa Popoff, Juliet Nusbaum, Martin Eisner, ­ ­Elizabeth Ziolkowski, Jan Ziolkowski, and Theodore Ziolkowski, provided crucial feedback. These people come from my current institution, my graduate school, and my family. I am very lucky to have family members willing to read my work. It is impossible to recognize fully how my family has shaped me. I would most likely not know Italian had my parents, Elizabeth and Jan Ziolkowski, not bravely taken a family of five to Florence and put their three children, including my lovely sisters, Ada and Yetta, in Italian schools. I probably would not have pursued German if my parents had not used it as their secret language when I was a child. I know I would know much less German if it were not for my grandparents, Yetta and Theodore Ziolkowski, who have provided so many entries into German culture, history, and literature. Martin’s always valuable suggestions have come at every stage of my work. He has listened to innumerable tales about my authors and their works, including many things that did not make it into the book. His conversations have been fundamental not only because of how they have helped me form Kafka’s Italian Progeny but also because of the joy they bring. Our children, Nola and Tullia, similarly bring much happiness, even if their thoughts on literature are at this point less extensive. Their patience while I work is much appreciated, and their distractions, which bring so much light into my life, even more so. I will refrain from playing on the title of the book, which is dedicated to Martin.\n\nKAFKA’S ITALIAN PROGENY\n\nIntroduction\n\nKafka, World Literature, and the Italian Literary Landscape\n\nIf I am not mistaken the heterogeneous selections I have mentioned resemble Kafka’s work: if I am not mistaken, not all of them resemble each other, and this fact is the significant one. Kafka’s idiosyncrasy, in greater or lesser degree, is present in each of these writings, but if Kafka had not written we would not perceive it; that is to say, it would not exist. – Jorge Luis Borges, “Kafka and His Precursors”\n\nWhereas Kafka has been mobilized and deployed in discourses on ­minor literature, as formulated by Deleuze and Guattari, and world literature, as examined by Damrosch and Casanova, Kafka’s Italian ­Progeny uses him to examine the dimensions of the questioned and, at times, ignored modern literature of one national assignation, Italy.1 Through an exploration of a distinct but hitherto unexamined K ­ afkan tradition in Italy, this study brings together disparate but well-­ defined groups to fill gaps left by previous methods of organization. ­Revisiting canonical authors such as Italo Svevo and Italo Calvino, as well as investigating lesser-known authors such as Tommaso Landolfi and Lalla Romano, Kafka’s Italian Progeny analyses many figures who have been described as isolated from the Italian literary scene and, therefore, hard to place. In addition to adding to the critical view of these writers, this book ­integrates new combinations of Italian authors into significant d ­ ebates, an examination that, in turn, contributes to these discourses. Because\n\n1 See Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka; Damrosch, What Is World Literature?; and ­Casanova, The World Republic of Letters.\n\n4\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nmost important critical discussions of twentieth- and twenty-first-century ­literature include Kafka, but not the literature of m ­ odern Italy, one goal is to bring the richness of Italian fiction to a larger ­audience by way of the German-language author. These l­iterary-critical motivations are complemented by the historical fact of K ­ afka’s remarkable, but f­requently overlooked, Italian reception.2 The first section of this ­ ­ introduction ­addresses the larger literary-critical stakes before ­describing Kafka’s ­distinctive reception in Italy. The Place of Italian Literature in World-Literature Debates While one line of world literature studies has proceeded on the assumption that national literatures are fixed, Kafka’s Italian Progeny reveals how complex the notion of a national literature is. Wai Chee Dimock and Lawrence Buell’s Shades of the Planet: American Literature as World Literature questioned the category of American literature within global, transnational, and international perspectives, showing the difficulties of defining a national literary tradition. American, like any national, literature presents its own challenges and opportunities (the pervasiveness of the English language, the prominence of the United States in the global economy, etc.). At first glance, the Italian case may appear simpler: a peninsula with borders seemingly predetermined by geography and geology; no other dominant, same-language literary ­tradition; a long history emphasizing Italian-ness; and a strong medieval ­literary tradition. Many of Italy’s best-known authors knew each other. In ­contrast to the cultural contexts described in Shades of the Planet, the Italian literary world can seem extremely small. Nonetheless, American and Italian studies share at least one quality, although it stems from different factors. In Shades of the Planet, Jonathan Arac comments on the resistance Americanists face when engaged in comparative work: “In the United States all forms of comparative and international study always carry an implicit critique of the continental insularity that marks this country.”3 Comparative work on the ­literature of Italy faces similar challenges, in part because of peninsularity and an apparent need to protect the debated modern tradition from o ­ utside influences. Because critics often avoid putting Italian ­ ­ authors into conversation with non-Italian ones, like Kafka, some of their exciting 2 For more on Kafka’s Italian reception, see Hösle, “Italien”; Cusatelli, “Kafka e i suoi lettori italiani”; Caputo-Mayr, “Kafka and Romance Languages”; Ziolkowski, “Primo Levi and Jewish Kafka in Italy”; and Ziolkowski, “Kafka and Italy.” 3 Arac, “Global and Babel,” 23.\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nqualities have been overlooked. The comparisons of these authors with Kafka offered here aim to shed new light on them. Italy’s twentieth-century literary scene is both expansive in terms of who is considered significant and, at the same time, often (relatedly) isolated from other literary discussions. The modern canon of Italy is more debated than are those of (for instance) France, Germany, and England. Many have been called Italy’s most important or greatest modern author: Gabriele D’Annunzio, Luigi Pirandello, Italo Svevo, Elsa Morante, Alberto Moravia, Carlo Emilio Gadda, Eugenio Montale, Italo Calvino, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Because of the long-standing idea that Italian literature defines Italy, determining an Italian author’s significance may be particularly vital. While not having a nation has been proposed as one of the reasons for Goethe’s promotion of Weltliteratur, one can see the opposite tendency among the Italian intellectuals who looked to their own unique linguistic-literary traditions to see their national future. In response to Klemens von Metternich’s jab at the Congress of Vienna that Italy was a “geographical expression,” Giosuè Carducci claimed that it was ­instead “a literary expression, a poetic tradition.”4 The sense that ­Italy and her literature were one and the same continued well after the ­Risorgimento.5 In 1960, Carlo Levi characterized the relationship ­between Italy and her literature in a similar manner: “All of her artists and poets have, in describing the country, determined it.”6 Strategies for approaching and trying to describe the Italian scene more broadly than examinations of individual authors include ­attention to ­regional differences, literary journals, and literary ­movements or groups, such as frammetismo, ermetismo, novecentismo, futurismo, ­crepuscolarismo, neorealismo, and neo-sperimentalismo. As with the journals (La voce, L ­ acerba, La ronda, Il Baretti, 900, Solaria, Il selvaggio, ­Letteratura, La riforma letteraria, Il Frontespizio, Primato, Il Politecnico, ­Officina, and Il menabò di letteratura), many of these groups and terms, these various ismi, are specific to the Italian literary landscape. Although 4 “Un’espressione letteraria, una tradizione poetica” (Carducci, quoted in Jossa, ­L’Italia letteraria, 20). In 1847, Francesco De Sanctis’s student Luigi La Vista ­expressed an analogous sentiment: “A history of Italian literature would be a ­history of Italy” (“Una storia della letteratura italiana sarebbe una storia d’Italia”; La Vista, quoted in Jossa, 21.) Unless otherwise noted (with page numbers), ­translations into English are my own. 5 Stefano Jossa’s L’Italia letteraria [Literary Italy, 2006] explores how Italy’s late founding and literary history gave its literature a large role in the country’s perception of itself. 6 “Tutti i suoi artisti e i suoi poeti l’hanno, descrivendola, determinata” (Levi, Un volto che ci somiglia, viii).\n\n6\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nthe ­description of any modern literature confronts numerous issues, modern ­Italian literature is particularly problematic. Several challenges owe not only to the subject matter and the qualities of modern Italian ­ authors but also to how Italian literature has tended to be examined. As the lists above attest, Italy is notable for the number of its movements. One history of Italian literature proclaims, “Since the death of Pascoli the century has hardly witnessed two consecutive years without the creation of some new literary movement, formalized or otherwise, the publication of new cultural journals or the growth of affiliations of littérateurs loosely classifiable in ‘schools.’”7 Since many of these terms and journals are relevant only or primarily to Italy, numerous studies that concentrate on them, like those that concentrate on individual ­authors, add a great deal to the critical details of the Italian literary l­ andscape, but often do not bring Italian literature into broader conversations. There are, of course, exceptions, including several works on the journals that aimed to bring broader literary traditions to Italy, such as Solaria and ­Botteghe oscure, and studies like those of Francesca Billiani, who put these journals into transnational contexts.8 In general, however, by concentrating on local trends, particular figures, or regional clusters of authors, critics of Italian literature have developed refined understandings of ­Italy’s authors and movements, but have tended to isolate Italian literature from international perspectives. Breaking up the categories that prevent some authors from being compared, since they have been classified using different, specific, terms, will highlight new c­onnections among several works, such as those of Lalla Romano, ­Giorgio ­Manganelli, and Antonio Tabucchi, discussed in the second chapter. Studies of European or world literature often relegate modern Italian literature to a brief mention.9 Although Italy’s strong medieval tradition guarantees that Italian works have a prominent place in discussions of world literature, W.H. Auden declared Kafka, not a modern Italian author, the Dante of our time.10 Whenever Italian authors are mentioned, they are regularly compared, generally to their disadvantage, with French- and English-language ones. Authors from Italy, even Italo Svevo, Carlo Emilio Gadda, and Luigi Pirandello, are frequently 7 Woodhouse, “The Fascist Era,” 289. 8 See Billiani, Modes of Censorship and Translation; and Billiani, la Penna, and Milani, special issue, Modern Italy. 9 See Dainotto, “World Literature and European Literature,” on the complex relationship between European literature and world literature. 10 See W.H. Auden: “Had one to name the artist who comes nearest to bearing the same kind of relation to our age that Dante, Shakespeare and Goethe bore to theirs, Kafka is the first one would think of” (Auden, Prose, 2:110).\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nomitted from the canon of modern writers, where James Joyce, Marcel Proust, and Franz Kafka reside.11 The modern Italian literary tradition is often described as in the shadow of, or overshadowed by, the corresponding French one. In their analysis of Émile Zola’s role in Italy, Ann Hallamore Caesar and Michael Caesar point out that French authors are seen both as the primary influencers of, and also as more modern than, Italian authors, who have been recognized, but not necessarily embraced, by the Italian public.12 Pascale Casanova affirms and codifies the capital city of France as the centre of literary relations in The World Republic of Letters: “And so it was that Paris became the capital of the literary world, the city endowed with the greatest literary prestige on earth.”13 Since critics often assume the centrality of Paris, they at times overlook the cultural, historical, and intellectual connections between Italy and other nations. Examining a German-language author against Italian ones complements the more numerous studies that concentrate on Italy’s literary connections to France.14 While the relationships between French and ­Italian literatures are undeniably multiple and important, the focus on this geographical, cultural, and literary association has, at times, ­obscured other significant relationships. In 1910: The Emancipation of ­Dissonance, Thomas Harrison draws attention to this problem: he examines how 11 For works on Kafka and world literature, see Engel and Lamping, Franz Kafka und die Weltliteratur; Damrosch’s chapter, “Kafka Comes Home,” in What Is World Literature?; and Zyla, Franz Kafka. 12 “The critical reception of Zola in Italy was a microcosm of the establishment’s views of French culture and its influence on the Italian public in general. He was held in high esteem by literary critics and was a literary model for writers who later acquired a canonical status in Italy. But at the same time he was the scourge of clerics and commentators, who felt he and alongside him many other French writers were a nefarious influence on susceptible readers” (Caesar and Caesar, Modern Italian Literature, 125). 13 Casanova, The World Republic of Letters, 24. As Ram has stated, “In its evident ­Gallocentrism, Casanova’s theory can certainly be faulted for perpetuating the very logic it seeks to expose” (Ram, “Futurist Geographies,” 319). Casanova’s examination of Paris as the model is both convincing and, at the same time, makes for some awkward observations about Italy. She calls attention to this issue, which she in part explores, however generally, from a French vantage point (Casanova, 23). In her description, French humanists aimed to challenge the power of Italy, a country that would not exist for centuries (Casanova, 49). For her, “Italy” failed to produce a literary capital, despite Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch, and Machiavelli, because it was not a country (Casanova, 81). Meanwhile, Italy’s sense of unity was in large part based on its literary (non-national) past, and the medieval tradition continues to have a stronger presence than the modern one that arose during nationalism. 14 This critical tendency is present in the broader discussion of Italian literature as much as in individual studies – say, on Proust.\n\n8\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nthe scholarly emphasis on Dino Campana’s French, symbolic lineage “­obscured a proper view of the more raw, ‘Teutonic,’ expressionistic ­dimensions of his verse.”15 By taking a German-language author as the point of comparison, Kafka’s Italian Progeny approaches Italian literature from a different vantage point. For instance, this book does not focus on existentialism and surrealism, although these terms have been discussed in ­regard to Kafka, since concentrating on them would put Kafka and Italian literature onto French terrain without necessarily changing the perspective on the Italian literary landscape. Even though several ­authors discussed in Kafka’s Italian Progeny, including Moravia, Vittorini, ­Ginzburg, Pavese, and Buzzati, have been examined in light of existentialism, the category can be awkward in the Italian context, revealing how using critical ­categories can determine the parameters of a discussion.16 In contrast to early French writers, Italian critics, in fact, repeatedly discussed why Kafka was not an existential or surrealist author, and proposed their own views of him, in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Discussions of Italian modernism exemplify the often difficult relationship between Italian literary traditions and broadly international ones. While romanticism and existentialism appear in the index of The Cambridge History of Italian Literature, revised in 1999, modernism does not. This absence, which would be unimaginable in a similar reference work for many other national literatures, reveals how little critical traction the term has had in Italian studies, a fact that has contributed to its relative isolation. The study of Italian modernism has been partially hindered by the association between early avant-garde movements, or early modernist groups, and fascism. Italy has often been treated as if it had an avant-garde, futurism, subsequently linked to fascism, but no modernism.17 Indeed, modernism has been consistently used to describe 15 Harrison, 1910, 36. Ragusa comments on how the Italian “habit of self-­denigration” began to extend itself beyond just comparison with French culture to include ­Anglo-Saxon and Germanic (Ragusa, Narrative and Drama, 4). 16 “Every reader with even the slightest knowledge of Italian literature is well aware that, unlike France, Italy does not claim in its roster of writers any names that could match those of such distinguished, articulate and highly vocal personalities as Jean-Paul Sartre, Gabriel Marcel, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty who, along with a score of novelists and essayists, are mainly responsible for the ­popularity and fame currently being enjoyed by Existentialism” (Pacifici, “­Existentialism and Italian Literature,” 79). 17 Emilio Gentile, Walter L. Adamson, and Martin Puchner have pointed to the ­limitations of making this sharp distinction since there are “alliances and shared projects across the presumed line separating high modernism and manifesto-driven or avant-garde Modernism” (Puchner, Poetry of the Revolution, 7). Ram puts the ­Italian movement in its international context (Ram, “Futurist Geographies”).\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nmodern Italian literature only since the beginning of this century, with Luca Somigli and Mario Moroni’s field-changing edited volume, Italian Modernism (2004).18 Accommodating modernism to the Italian literary landscape can be a struggle. The problems of applying it in discussions of Italian literature are evidenced by the fact that one of the primary ways to bring many authors of modernism together is to comment on how different they are, as in Robert Dombroski’s “The Foundations of Italian ­Modernism,” which summarizes the situation: “Geography played a crucial role in defining the Italian experience of ‘modernity.’ ... Pirandello, Svevo, and Gadda represent three different stages and ways of portraying and interpreting reality.”19 In addition, a modernism that not only encompasses but even begins with Svevo’s and Gadda’s novels (Senilità, 1898; La coscienza di Zeno, 1923; Quer pasticciaccio brutto de via Merulana, 1957; and La cognizione del dolore, 1963) is less chronologically concentrated than most other modernisms. Modernism, a much-debated term in general, can become particularly vague when applied to ­Italy’s chronologically diffuse and geographically diverse literary scene. While several of my chapters will comment on the modernist qualities of Italian authors, my analysis is not intended to fit all the authors discussed into the category of modernism. The awkwardness of Italian modernism potentially prompts new ways to bring together a variety of important modern Italian authors. I propose a Kafkan perspective on Italian literature as an alternative approach, one that allows for a diverse and complex portrait of the ­Italian literary landscape, but that also brings Italian literature into broader conversations. The comparison with Kafka, who came from a multilingual, contested area and whose works have been seen as, in part, a result of these conflicts, sheds light on Italian authors’ multilingual, marginal, and contested contexts.20 From representations of crises, animal imagery, and oppressive familial relations to extremely short fiction and literary detective novels, the disparate elements of Kafka’s work are reflected throughout modern Italian literature. This Kafkan tradition encompasses a more diverse group of authors than headings\n\n18 Since Somigli and Moroni’s collection appeared, a series of other critics, notably Roberto Luperini and Massimiliano Tortora, have engaged in a sustained consideration of what modernism means in the Italian context. 19 Dombroski, “The Foundations of Italian Modernism,” 102. 20 See, in particular, chaps. 4 and 5. Multilingual in the Italian context refers primarily to the prominence of dialects (which are often further from Italian, linguistically, than Spanish is), although many Italian authors also knew French, English, German, etc.\n\n10\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nsuch as frammentismo allow, without assimilating the particularity of the Italian scene into one larger modernist movement. David Damrosch has analysed how a viewer’s origins change the picture of any literary scene: “For any given observer, even a ­genuinely global perspective remains a perspective from somewhere, and global patterns of circulation of world literature take shape in their l­ocal manifestations.”21 His quote addresses a problem he saw in Franco M ­ oretti’s characterization of world literature.22 Moretti claimed a d ­ ivision b ­ etween seeing “trees” and “waves” for scholars working on national and world literature: “national literature, for ­people who see trees; world literature, for people who see waves.”23 One of the issues with this formulation is that of perspective. We ­create our trees; they are not solid and unchanging.24 While not ­discounting the many other “trees” that have been discussed, this book offers a new ­perspective and proposes that those of national literature are frequently more fluid, or rhizomatic in the Deleuze and G ­ uattarian sense, than rooted.25 Kafka’s Italian Reception: An Overview Critics generally characterize Kafka as “barely known to his contemporaries” at the time of his death in 1924, and they describe his fame as a post–Second World War phenomenon.26 While French, German, ­American, and British studies tend to credit the French, Germans, Americans, and British for bringing Kafka to the world’s attention, he had a strong presence in Italy even before the Second World War. I­ talian 21 Damrosch, What Is World Literature?, 27. 22 Damrosch, 25. 23 Moretti, Distant Reading, 61. 24 Apter has clarified how a nation acts as the proprietor of its literary tradition in a way that is analogous to an author’s own works: “Literary communities are gated: according to Western law and international statute, authors have texts, publishers have a universal right to translate (as long as they pay), and nations own literary patrimony as cultural inheritance” (Apter, Against World Literature, 15). We critics describe these gated communities and, in part, decide how the outside world views them. 25 This continues with a critical trend that Saussy, in “Exquisite Cadavers Stitched from Fresh Nightmares,” and Jonathan Culler note, that comparative literature suggests approaches that national literature and culture departments should also consider (Culler, “Comparative Literature, at Last,” 237). 26 This quote is from Caputo-Mayr, “Introduction,” 331. She has written several other articles on Kafka’s reception (for his reception in Italy, see, in particular, ­Caputo-Mayr, “Kafka and Romance Languages”) and is the co-editor, with Julius M. Herz, of Franz Kafka.\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nauthors such as Carlo Emilio Gadda, Natalia Ginzburg, Tommaso ­Landolfi, Eugenio Montale, Elsa Morante, Alberto Moravia, C ­ esare Pavese, Italo Svevo, and Elio Vittorini mention Kafka’s ­importance ­before 1945. L ­ avinia Mazzucchetti states that the “first non-­German notice” of Kafka came from Italians, and she herself wrote of Kafka in 1926.27 The Italian translations of “Ein Brudermord” (“Un f­ ratricidio”), “Ein altes Blatt” (“Un vecchio foglietto”), “Vor dem Gesetz” (“­Davanti alla legge”), and “Der neue Advokat” (“Il nuovo avvocato”) in 1928 were prefaced with the translator’s remark that he worried about daring to present an a­ uthor of Kafka’s stature.28 This comment comes not long after the posthumous publication in German of Kafka’s three novels, Der Prozess, 1925 (The Trial); Das Schloss, 1926 (The Castle); and A ­ merika, later Der Verschollene, 1927 (Amerika, or The Man Who ­Disappeared), which had yet to gain much notice. Kafka’s precocious appearance in the Italian literary landscape was due, in part, to the Austro-Hungarian and later Italian city of Trieste. ­Under Habsburg rule, Trieste was not allowed a university, so many of its citizens went to universities in Florence, Vienna, and Prague, ­returning with a deeper interest in the literature of those cities. B ­ ecause many Triestines knew German, in addition to Triestine, Italian, and ­Slovene, a number of them could read Kafka in the original, even ­before he was translated.29 The labours of the Triestine Roberto “Bobi” Bazlen exemplify the city’s role in spreading recognition of Kafka. Bazlen ­recommended Kafka’s works to Italians who wanted to improve their German as early as 1919 and to notable Italian authors, such as the poet Eugenio Montale in 1924.30 For most of Kafka’s life, Trieste was the major port of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Even after its fall in 1918, many of the cultural connections among Trieste, Prague, Vienna, and the rest of the Habsburg territories remained. Kafka’s own experiences reflect the connections between Prague and Trieste. Kafka began studying Italian in 1907, when he considered moving to Trieste since he worked for the insurance company Assicurazioni Generali, whose headquarters were located in the port city. Many Triestine authors, including Italo Svevo,\n\n27 See the citation in Mazzuchetti, Novecento in Germania, 188. See also Mazzuchetti, “Franz Kafka e il Novecento.” 28 See Kafka and Menassé, “Franz Kafka,” 383. 29 For examinations of the category and works of Triestine authors, see Ara and Magris, Trieste; Pizzi, A City in Search of an Author; and Klopp, Bele Antiche Stòríe. 30 See Mattioni, Storia di Umberto Saba, 82; La Ferla, Diritto al silenzio; and Montale, Lettere Italo Svevo, 178.\n\n12\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nGiani Stuparich, Alberto Spaini, Stelio Mattioni, Susanna Tamaro, and Claudio Magris, draw on Kafka in their literary works.31 After the Second World War, Kafka remained a prominent figure, ­especially as Italian authors considered what foreign novels could add to Italian literature. Especially since many Italians read Kafka not only in Italian translation but also in French and German, among other versions, some early Italian criticism of Kafka mirrors that of other countries.32 In keeping with other critics, when they first encountered Kafka, Italian writers often used the terms labyrinthine, mystical, and ­metaphysical to describe him. Calvino saw learning from Kafka as an ­important step for Italians to become world authors. Calvino was drawn to Kafka, in part, out of a desire to rejuvenate Italian literature: “With this meagre assortment of values to save from our own recent tradition, we threw ourselves with impatience into the crucible of the world ­literature of our century: Proust, Joyce, Kafka.”33 The hope that Kafka’s work would help revive Italian prose more generally relates to a long tradition of Italian authors (not just translators) who brought German, French, and Anglo-American works to the Italian public. From the 1930s (Alberto Spaini) to today (Paola Capriolo), several ­notable Italian authors have dedicated their time to translating Kafka. At times, authors were drawn to Kafka on their own; in other cases, publishers (such as Primo L ­ evi’s) facilitated a connection between the German-language author and an Italian one. In the 1980s, Einaudi’s Authors Translated by Authors ­series published both Levi’s translation of The Trial (1983) and Franco ­Fortini’s translation of K ­ afka’s short stories (1986).34\n\n31 While not all of them make it into Kafka’s Italian Progeny, all would be productive to discuss with regard to Kafka. However, the existing category, Triestine authors, is often considered somewhat foreign to the Italian literary landscape, and this book aims to show how Kafka suggests new groups of authors rather than modifying ­existing ones. 32 Svevo, who called Kafka his last literary love, read the Prague author in German. See Ziolkowski, “Svevo’s Dogs.” 33 “Con questo scarno bagaglio di valori da salvare della nostra ultima tradizione, ci buttavamo con impazienza nel crogiuolo della letteratura mondiale del nostro secolo: Proust, Joyce, Kafka” (Calvino, Saggi, 65). This quote is from a version of a talk published in Italian (“Tre correnti del romanzo italiano d’oggi,” 1960). The ­earlier English talk, given at Columbia University in 1959 and then published in 1960 (“Main Currents in Italian Fiction Today”), does not contain this sentence. 34 See Mauro’s discussion of Franco Fortini’s translation in Mauro, Il ponte di Glienicke, 111–24.\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nEmily Apter has argued that world literature relies on a “translatability assumption” (often into English), ignoring the untranslatability of works and phrases.35 Complementing her arguments about untranslatability, Kafka’s Italian reception shows the specificity of ­ translation from one tradition to another. The presentation of a work and the t­exture of its text changes depending, in part, on the culture of the t­arget audience. For instance, Kafka’s early translator, Alberto Spaini, not only chose which of Kafka’s novels to translate first due to his specific reading of Kafka’s realism, but his views also affected his translation practices. Translations have a specificity that is sometimes overlooked in discussions of world literature.36 Many studies on Kafka and his ­influence concentrate on him and English-language authors, just as many works on Kafka’s world reception focus on works originally written in, or translated into, English.37 I argue that the unique relationship ­between Kafka and Italian literature offers another way to complicate the dominance of global English in literary studies. Italian critics, in fact, have a notable tradition of contributing to Kafka criticism.38 As Italian reviewers of Angel Flores’s 1946 E ­ nglish-language collection The Kafka Problem pointed out, it contained two translations of Italian essays, Renato Poggioli’s “Kafka and Dostoevsky” and ­Alberto Spaini’s introduction to The Trial. Roberto Calasso’s introduction to and edition of Zürau Aphorisms, originally in Italian, has been used for ­German, English, French, Spanish, Polish, and other editions of the work. In a 2013 review of Reiner Stach’s Kafka: The Decisive Years and Kafka: The Years of Insight,39 as well as Saul Friedländer’s Franz Kafka: The Poet of Shame and Guilt, John Banville singles out both P ­ ietro Citati\n\n35 “In a counter-move, I invoke untranslatability as a deflationary gesture toward the expansionism and gargantuan scale of world-literary endeavors. A primary argument of this book is that many recent efforts to revive World Literature rely on a translatability assumption” (Apter, Against World Literature, 3). 36 See Woods, Kafka Translated. See Sofri, Una variazione di Kafka, for a discussion of the interpretative difference that one word can make. 37 See the impressive online project, “Kafka Atlas,” which documents Kafka’s reception in numerous countries (Russia, China, Brazil, India, and Canada, etc.): Haring, “Kafka-Atlas.” 38 Italians who travelled to other countries also often introduced others to his work. Lorenza Mazzetti recalls that her London colleagues had not heard of Kafka before she started making a film based on The Metamorphosis, and Viktor Nekrasov recounts that Alberto Moravia was the first to mention Kafka to him and several of his fellow Russian writers. 39 The review is of the two English translations by Shelley Frisch.\n\n14\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nand Roberto Calasso: “In the matter of originality one should mention Pietro Citati’s Kafka (English translation 1990) and Roberto Calasso’s K. (English translation 2005). These are not biographies but deeply ­perceptive and poetic meditations on the unique phenomenon that Kafka represented.”40 The fact that the two works Banville mentions are Italian suggests how Italy’s position in the critical landscape can lend itself to creating unusual, provocative works.41 The Italian background of these works is rarely mentioned: Italian criticism is not far enough from the primary Western critical tradition for it to be of note (were Citati and Calasso both Japanese, their nationality would probably have been mentioned), but it is also not dominant enough (unlike French- or English-language writers) for Italian critics to be considered central to the critical discussion. Relatedly, while Agamben’s writing on Kafka has had a strong international fortuna, critics often overlook the importance of his Italian background in shaping his views. Primo Levi’s translation of The Trial and his subsequent reflection on the idea of shame in the novel significantly informed Agamben’s concept of Kafka.42 To give a sense of the extent of Kafka’s influence in Italy, I offer an example from each decade since the 1940s, in which significant I­ talian intellectuals refer to and use Kafka directly in their work.43 In 1942, Tommaso Landolfi publishes the story “Il babbo di Kafka” (“Kafka’s Dad”), in which Kafka encounters a large spider with the head of his father. In 1953, Italian author and director Lorenza Mazzetti produces a cinematic version of “Die Verwandlung” (“The Metamorphosis”) in England, called K. She discusses the process of making the film in Diario londinese (London Diary) and notes the appeal of Kafka to someone, like her, who felt like an outsider. A notable number of other Italian works on Kafka are called “K,” including Edoardo Sanguineti’s dramatic\n\n40 Banville, “A Different Kafka.” 41 In addition to Levi, Elsa Morante, Massimo Cacciari, and Davide Stimilli are all important points of reference in his discussions of Kafka. Agamben’s piece, “K.,” in Nudities reflects on the idea that K. in Der Process stands for kalumniator, an idea he expands from Davide Stimilli’s analysis of Kafka. 42 Snoek argues that while the fascination with Agamben and Kafka is rooted in their “seemingly gloomy political world views” (Snoek, Agamben’s Joyful Kafka, 1), Agamben, in fact, uses Kafka as an exit strategy from unbearable political situations. 43 While Kafka’s Italian Progeny engages Kafka’s reception to analyse groups of Italian authors, this method is not the only way to combine Kafka and Italy or Kafka and Italian literature. Italian Kafka is a rich source for study. While direct references to Kafka in Italian literature, film, and art guide the readings in several chapters in this book, there are many more examples of Kafka’s influence in Italy.\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nrendering of Kafka’s purported conversations with Gustav Janouch, ­Calasso’s book, and Agamben’s piece in Nudità (Nudities). Since K is not part of the standard Italian alphabet, the use of this letter immediately marks the upcoming reading as foreign and is perhaps even more closely linked to Kafka than it is in German or English. In 1964, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s “Progetto di opere future” (“Plan for ­Future Works”) includes the lines “oh Kafka – tutto è terrore”44 (“oh Kafka – everything is terror”). Nobel prize-winner Eugenio ­Montale i­ ncludes a poem, “Verboten,” in the Diaries from 1971 and 1972 that ­begins by describing Kafka’s grammar as missing the future. One of the premises of Federico Fellini’s Intervista (1987) is that the f­ amous director is finally realizing his dream of filming Kafka’s ­ ­ Amerika. ­Claudio Magris describes a visit to the room where Kafka died in ­Danubio (Danube, 1990). Cristian Martini’s travel story draws on Kafka in content and title: La vendetta di Kafka (Kafka’s Revenge, 2005). In 2015 at Italy’s ­Embassy in Washington, DC, Francesco Nonino showed his series of photographs, “Come se la vergogna” / “As If the Shame of It,” inspired by Kafka’s The Trial. One of the photographs from this series provides this book’s cover image. The early fascination of Italian readers with Kafka stems, in part, from the numerous references to Italian names, characters, and ­locations in his oeuvre.45 Italian consistently appears in Kafka’s works, partially ­because of his travels. He travelled to Italian locations on multiple o ­ ccasions, visiting Trieste, Lugano, Milan, Stresa, Brescia, Verona, ­Venice, Desenzano, Merano, and Riva on Lake Garda. Kafka’s experience in Brescia, analysed in Peter Demetz’s The Air Show at Brescia, 1909, led to his first published article, which included a couple of not very ­flattering comments about D’Annunzio: “Gabriele d’Annunzio, short and fragile, dances about in an apparently bashful way in front of the Count Oldofredi, one of the most important gentlemen of the Committee. Looking out over the rail of the stand is the strong face of Puccini, with a nose that might be called the nose of a drinker.”46 ­Curzio ­Malaparte discusses D’Annunzio’s annoyance at the description ­during a 1928 visit, during which the authors looked at an Italian translation of the article: “‘Look,’ he said to me, ‘even him! Would you have imagined it? He comes to Italy, and cannot find anything better 44 Pasolini, Poesia in forma di rosa, 204. 45 For more on Kafka’s Italian journeys, see Caputo-Mayr, “Kafka and Romance Languages”; Demetz, The Air Show at Brescia, 1909; Crespi, “Kafka e l’Italia,” 107–12; and Stach, Kafka. 46 Kafka, The Transformation, 7.\n\n16\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nto do but insult me. He was a miserable office worker, in an insurance company for Prague, but he was a great artist, with a noble mind. And look who comes forward to talk about me, the poor office worker.’ I read the name: it was Kafka’s.”47 Because Kafka had written about D’Annunzio (even if in a critical manner), the Italian author was interested in Kafka. The early Italian view of Kafka was distinct from other national ­traditions in several ways and continues to affect the view of him in Italy today.48 In 1954, Ladislao Mittner published “Kafka senza ­kafkaismi” (Kafka without Kafkaisms), in which he argued that the time to ­reassess Kafka had finally come because Kafka’s fame had moved beyond its apex. Italian Germanists, such as Mittner, often resisted the more ­popular ideas of Kafka as existentialist, surrealist, or a religious prophet.49 Kafka’s strong presence among Italian authors and intellectuals, ­before he was internationally famous, affected the course of his Italian reception: Italian criticism was at the forefront of calling attention to the ­significance of Prague, Jewish culture, Austria-Hungary, and humour for understanding Kafka.50 Multiple factors contribute to these noticeable elements of Italian criticism of Kafka. From before the Jewish periodical La rassegna mensile di Israel (Monthly Review of Israel) published an overview in 1936 to De Angelis’s Qualcosa 47 “‘Guarda,’ mi disse, ‘anche lui! Lo avresti immaginato? Viene in Italia, e non trova di meglio da fare che insultar me. Era un misero impiegatuccio, in una società di assicurazioni di Praga, ma era un grande artista, una nobile mente. E guarda chi vien fuori, per parla di me: l’impiegatuccio.’ Io lessi il nome: era quello di Kafka” (Malaparte, Battibecco, 101–2). 48 The particular Italian context also affects which works of Kafka’s are taught in schools. For instance, Panebianco, Seminara, and Gineprini’s “Percorso Tema” gives a selection of texts that are connected to the students inspired by Marco Polo’s ­Milione, including selections from Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan,” Kafka’s “Un messsaggio dell’imperatore,” and Calvino’s Le città invisibili. Calvino’s introduction to Le città invisibili, in fact, suggested this connection. 49 Mittner began his 1954 article, “Camus, in a kafkaesquely vivid style, wrote regarding The Castle, ‘The destiny and perhaps the greatness of this work consists of offering everything and confirming nothing.’ Kafkomania has been in definite ­decline for the past ten years, and perhaps it has reached the ideal moment to liberate Kafka from the various kafkismi” (Mittner, La letteratura tedesca del Novecento, 249). 50 Although it is now a commonplace to claim that Kafka’s humour is overlooked, Renato Barilli (1982) and Guido Crespi (1983) dedicated entire books to the issue of Kafka’s humour over a decade before David Foster Wallace’s better known “Laughing with Kafka” (1998). My chapter on the Italian understanding of Kafka as a realist and the significance of Amerika, or Der Verschollene (Amerika, or The Man Who Disappeared) in Italy goes into the background of this in the greatest detail since Kafka’s humour and realism are related.\n\nIntroduction 17\n\ndi più intimo, 2006 (Something More Intimate) and beyond, Kafka’s Jewish heritage has been a point of focus and a significant reference point in discussions of Jewishness in Italy.51 In the 1920s and 1930s major ­Italian authors, such as Svevo and Ginzburg, remarked on the importance of Kafka’s Jewishness. For many Italian authors, Kafka helped them to define elements of their own Jewish heritage. Kafka’s appeal as a ­Jewish author to many Italian authors with Jewish backgrounds also highlights the prominence of these authors in modern Italian literature. In certain areas of Italy, interest in Kafka and his Jewishness really grew after the racial laws were instituted in 1938. These laws forced people of Jewish background out of the main school system and caused them to run their own middle and high schools, often with Jewish ­instructors who had been professors at universities. This separation promoted an interest in Judaism and in the meaning of being Jewish. Kafka was a significant part of the schools’ program of Jewish discovery. Much of the Italian reception of Kafka’s Jewishness reflects past studies of Jewishness in Italy: attraction to Kafka’s Jewish heritage, negative feelings related to his Jewish background, and ignorance of Kafka’s Jewishness occurred simultaneously and reflect the various responses of Italians more generally to Italians of Jewish background before, during, and soon after the Second World War.52 Whereas Kafka’s background and context are now considered central for understanding the author, this shift took place at a broader level over fifty years after his death. Franz Kafka: International ­Bibliography of Primary and Secondary Literature lists Giuliano Baioni’s Kafka: ­Romanzo e parabola, 1962 (Kafka: Novel and Parable) first in its summary of works dedicated to Kafka’s Jewishness and “affinity to Eastern European culture.”53 Trieste’s strong connections to the Austro-Hungarian world contribute to the important role that Italian critics have played in understanding the importance of Prague and Austria-Hungary to K ­ afka’s work. Jacques Le Rider characterizes the German translation of Claudio Magris’s Il mito absburgico nella letteratura austriaca moderna (The Habsburg Myth in Modern Austrian Literature; Der habsburgische Mythos in der\n\n51 See Luzzatto’s piece on Kafka (“Franz Kafka”) in La Rassegna Mensile di Israel. 52 I have discussed elsewhere, in more detail, Svevo’s, Ginzburg’s, and Primo Levi’s comments on Kafka’s Jewishness (Ziolkowski, “Primo Levi and Jewish Kafka in Italy”). Kafka’s early reception reflects the difficulty of trying to define the existence and character of Italian Jewishness as well as Italian anti-Semitism. For works that explore Italian authors with Jewish background as modern Italian Jewish authors, see, e.g., Hughes, Prisoners of Hope; and De Angelis, Qualcosa di più intimo. 53 Caputo-Mayr and Herz, Franz Kafka, xxxvii.\n\n18\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nösterreichischen Literatur), which includes discussions of Kafka, as marking the “early beginning of the rediscovery of ‘Viennese modernity.’”54 Even before Magris and Baioni, in a review of the first Italian edition of The Castle (1948), Giovanni Papini proposed that it made no sense to read the novel as an allegory about God or a search, but that, if it had meaning, it was about Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy: “The Castle would be, in this way, a gray and bitter parody of the Habsburg administration, or even of the imperial government, which for the Slavs of Prague, was a foreign government and, therefore, even more r­idiculous and odious. But this contingent symbolism will seem too modest to the abstracters of sleep-walking criticism.”55 Like many Italian writers, Papini took issue with how his contemporaries tended to read Kafka, even though, unlike most Italian critics and authors, he reached fairly negative conclusions about Kafka’s work. Attention to Kafka’s cultural contexts, humour, and realism are interrelated. The Castle, for instance, is more likely to seem amusing if it is read as a realistic parody of Habsburg bureaucracy. Papini’s view contrasts with the world-literature perspective of his time.56 David Damrosch, in his chapter, “Kafka Comes Home,” in What Is World Literature? describes the shift from viewing Kafka as a ­ universal author in most of the twentieth century to considering him a ­representative of a “marginal” culture in this century: “­ Following Brod’s lead, the Muirs and their publisher Schocken, worked to p ­ roduce a ­universalist Kafka, a creator of symbolic quests for spiritual meaning, a writer who could become a central figure for modern self-understanding rather than someone who needed to be 54 Le Rider, Modernity and Crises of Identity, xxxvii. Magris provided one explanation for the Italian sense of Austro-Hungarian contemporaneity: “Habsburg civilization is fashionable because it highlights the irreality that has taken over the world.” (“La civiltà asburgica è di moda perché ha posto in evidenza l’irrealtà che ha investito il mondo”; Magris, Itaca e oltre, 42.) Magris commented that journeying to another part of the Italian peninsula was necessary to realize the Austro-Hungarian nature of his Italian home (Magris, “Genesi di un ‘mito,’” 15). 55 “Il Castello sarebbe, così, una grigia e amara parodia dell’amministrazione ­absburgica, o addirittura del governo imperiale, che per gli slavi di Praga, era un governo straniero epperciò ancor più ridicolo e odioso. Ma questo simbolo ­contingente sembrerà troppo modesto agli strologatori della critica sonnambula” (Papini, La loggia dei busti, 255). 56 Papini is not the only early reviewer to find the work boring – a piece in the New Yorker informed the reader, “I warn you that the book is dull. I also warn you that the allegory is often obscured and fogged beyond all reason” (Smith, “The C ­ astle,” 106) – but he can be distinguished as seeing the relationship between The Castle and Austro-Hungarian culture at this point, whereas the New Yorker reviewer, Agnes W. Smith, follows the Muirs in her interpretation and frames the work as an allegory.\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nread in the context of turn-of-the-century Prague or even of German culture at large.”57 Damrosch’s narrative represents well the Anglo-­ American, German, and French reception of Kafka, but, as discussed, Italians ­underscored the significance of Kafka’s cultural background and ­Jewish heritage earlier and more often than other critics. Do the differences between the Italian situation and Damrosch’s description mean that Italian Kafka is not part of world-literature ­ Kafka? Damrosch asks, “If we now see a Prague Jew where an earlier generation saw an international modernist, are we getting closer to the essence of the writer and his work, or simply projecting our ­current ­interests into both?”58 One might also ask, does the “we” exclude ­Italian authors and critics? Anglophone critics are at times stuck within their own perspective, that the world-literature view of Kafka is the Kafka whom we, English speakers, know. This view shifts over time, but is especially recognizable to the American or British scholar, even though Kafka is a widely accepted world author, in part, because of his strong receptions in places that are frequently considered more peripheral, like Japan, Argentina, and Israel. Also changing with time, Russian Kafka, Chinese Kafka, Spanish Kafka, and Italian Kafka are all a little different. These various Kafkas are significant for adding to the critical understanding of Kafka and his reception as well as to help reconsider what is meant by the world-literature view of an author. In a discussion of world literature, centres, and peripheries, Martin Puchner remarks upon “the provincialism of the centre as a feeling that the world comes to you anyway, a provincialism associated with cultural (as well as political) hegemony.”59 This provincialism of the centre is often true not only of individual authors, like Ibsen, whom Puchner analyses, but also of reception. World-literature Kafka tends to describe the Kafka of the centre, whereas Italian, Russian, and Japanese Kafka can be seen as peripheral and, therefore, offering something new. Modifying Heinz Politzer’s earlier comment that Kafka’s work is like a Rorschach test for the critics, Stephen Dowden posits that\n\n57 Damrosch, What Is World Literature?, 189. He provides an important, often-used reference to world literature: “I take world literature to encompass all literary works that circulate beyond their culture of origin, either in translation or in their original language” (Damrosch, 4). He describes how Brod and the Muirs framed The Castle, quoting Brod’s description of it as a “book in which everyone recognizes his own experience” before moving to more culturally specific interpretations of the work. 58 Damrosch, 198. 59 Puchner, “Goethe, Marx, Ibsen and the Creation of a World Literature,” 5.\n\n20\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nKafka criticism itself now looks like a “vast and shapeless Rorschach blotch.”60 World-literature discussions give shape to the blotch, but ­often ­minimize, distil, and flatten it, while revealing which countries are ­considered part of world literature. Altering this view can help change the Rorschach blotch of Kafka, add to the critical understanding of Kafka, complicate world-literature narratives like those of ­Damrosch, and give a different shape to the Italian modern literary tradition. Morante and Buzzati: Two Cases of Kafka Reception Morante and Buzzati offer two examples of Kafka’s early Italian reception and what it can reveal about both Italian literature and its study. Morante was at the forefront of Kafka reception, and she comments on one of the first visual representations of Kafka’s work, Max Ernst’s depiction of Odradek in the French journal Minotaure (1937), which accompanied André Breton’s surrealist description of Kafka.61 This ­ ­image prompted Morante to dream of Kafka’s death as well as associate herself and Moravia with the author from Prague. In her note to her collection Lo scialle andaluso (The Andalusian Shawl), Morante claims that Kafka was the only author to influence her: “This however was the first and last time that E.M. – it is to be said in all fairness – was i­nfluenced by any other author in the world.”62 Moravia referred to Kafka as ­Morante’s “master” and “religion.”63 Morante’s consideration of Kafka and playing with Kafkan modes of narration were fundamental to the Italian author’s process of creating her n ­ arrative style.64 She saw K ­ afka’s stories as more truthful, more real, than attempts to represent reality naturalistically or documentarily: “Kafka writes surreal f­ables: and yet no photographic or documented report ­expresses ­certain atrocious truths of this century, as his surreal fables.”65 ­Morante’s ­interest in and 60 Dowden, Kafka’s Castle and the Critical Imagination, 1. Dowden used The Castle to give shape to the immense, seemingly blotch-like criticism. 61 For Morante’s comments on Odradek, see Diario 1938, 32; for my discussion of the relationship between her comments on Kafka and her own work, see Ziolkowski, “Morante and Kafka.” 62 “Questa però fu la prima e l’ultima che E.M. – sia detto a sua giustizia – risentì ­l ’influsso di un qualsiasi altro autore al mondo” (Morante, Lo scialle andaluso, 215). This is, of course, arguable; see, e.g., Lucamante, Elsa Morante e l’eredità proustiana. 63 See Moravia’s “master” comment (Life of Moravia, 190) and “religion” comment (Paris, 50). 64 See Ziolkowski, “Morante and Kafka.” 65 “Kafka scrive delle favole surreali: eppure nessun resoconto fotografico e ­documentato esprime certe atroci verità del presente secolo, come le sue favole ­surreali” (­Morante, Opere, 2:1511). See Leavitt, “Una seconda fase del realismo,” for a discussion of Morante and realism.\n\nIntroduction 21\n\nconnections with Kafka’s work are multiple. The two authors could be read together in terms of Jewish identity, realism, and the gothic, among other topics. In this book, M ­ orante’s work plays an i­mportant role in chapter 4 on the family and chapter 5 on the h ­ uman-animal boundary. Morante focused particularly on Kafka in the 1930s, when his ­important collection Il messaggio dell’imperatore (The Imperial Message) was published. This short story collection brought together most of Kafka’s short works (thirty-nine of them), including “The Hunter ­Gracchus.” Set in Riva, which Kafka visited in 1909 and 1913, “The Hunter G ­ racchus” features the “only geographically specific setting in any of Kafka’s short fiction.”66 Revealing how Kafka’s settings could shape Italian ­authors’ views of their own country, Kafka’s description of an Italian city ­influenced Morante’s experience of another Italian coastal city. She sees the story of the Hunter Gracchus reflected in her trip to Cefalù in 1937: “Windows closed, it makes one think about death. It seems like the boat of a dead pagan, tired of wandering and come ashore (Kafka’s ‘The Hunter Gracchus’).”67 Kafka was in Morante’s dreams, her mind as she travelled, and her thoughts as she wrote. Many other Italian authors, such as Lalla Romano and Cesare Pavese, discuss the significance of their encounters with Kafka’s work in 1935, the year Il messaggio dell’imperatore was published. In his 1945 introduction to America (The Man Who Disappeared, originally published as Amerika), Alberto Spaini insinuated that certain Italian authors had made Kafka-like literature popular before he was well known in Italy, and he dated the beginning of this influence to 1935: “For ten years we have been invaded by Kafkaini and by a Kafkaismo that so far the critics have not identified, perhaps because his name would not have meant anything to anyone, but which has made Kafka more popular in Italy than one can imagine.”68 Critics often read this comment as referencing Buzzati.69 The potential Buzzati-Kafka connection is a long-standing issue in Buzzati criticism.70 In 1947, Montale wanted to meet Buzzati, partly because so many had associated him with Kafka, revealing both 66 Gross, “Hunting Kafka,” 249. 67 “Finestre chiuse, fa pensare alla morte. Sembra una barca di un morto pagano, stanca di errare e approdata a questa riva (‘Il cacciattore gracco’ di Kafka)” (Morante, Opere, 1:xxix). 68 “Da dieci anni siamo invasi da kafkiani e da un kafkismo che la critica non ha finora identificato, forse perché il nome non avrebbe dette nulla a nessuno, ma che hanno reso Kafka assai più popolare in Italia di quanto di immagini” (Spaini, “Prefazione,” vii). 69 See, e.g., Cusatelli, “Kafka e i suoi lettori italiani,” 3. 70 See, e.g., Baumann’s “Buzzati: Ein ‘Kafka italiano’?” in Dino Buzzati, 215–20. In a review of The Tartar Steppe, Tim Parks argues, “Much, far too much, has been made of Buzzati’s debt to Kafka” (Parks, “Throwing Down a Gauntlet”).\n\n22\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nhis own continued interest in Kafka and the prominence of questions about Kafka’s influence on Buzzati.71 Critics often compared B ­ uzzati’s early works to Kafka’s in an unflattering manner.72 Moravia, for ­instance, suggested that Buzzati’s work was unoriginal and derivative of Kafka’s: “The book [Buzzati’s The Tartar Steppe] enjoyed a popularity precisely because the success of Kafka, a true writer, had prepared the ground for the work of his imitator.”73 Showing that he thought as little of Moravia’s work as Moravia did of his, Buzzati posited Kafka as a model for literary production, in contrast to the type of fiction Moravia wrote: “I have the distinct i­mpression that all veristic literature that is being written today, from the classic novels of love to stories like Moravia’s, really have no reason to exist. One should write something about which the public cannot help but be interested in, even if, in the case of Kafka, the public does not read it.”74 In this letter from 1935, Buzzati, who often aimed for the same effect in his own work, categorizes Kafka’s as a new kind of writing that offers a denaturalizing perspective. He read Kafka in both Italian and ­German, highlighting Kafka as one of the German authors whose works he chose to read in the original on account of the accessibility of Kafka’s language: “Because Kafka’s German is very limpid, very easy.”75 The Longanesi publishers asked Buzzati to change the originally ­proposed title of his Tartar novel from “La fortezza” (The fortress), with its strong military connotations, in part perhaps because it would ­recall Kafka’s The Castle, which Buzzati discussed reading, again in 1935: “I read 140 pages of The Castle and then I stopped, although it is ­impressive. But in this period, I need to read stupid and gay books like those of Wodehouse. Write me what you think of The Castle. It seems 71 Montale, quoted in Arslan, Invito alla lettura, 19. 72 See, e.g., Bárberi Squarotti, Dal tramonto, 56. For an overview of the Kafka-Buzzati relationship with regard to the broader issues of intertextuality in Buzzati, see ­Polcini, Dino Buzzati and Anglo-American Culture, 9–33. 73 Moravia and Elkann, Life of Moravia, 269. (“Il libro ha avuto una diffusione dovuta proprio al fatto che il successo di Kafka, scrittore autentico, aveva preparato il terreno all’opera del suo imitatore”; Moravia and Elkann, Vita di Moravia, 223.) While Moravia accused Buzzati of being successful merely because Kafka was, other critics commented that Buzzati drew on Kafka before Kafka was popular, even before many of his works had been translated into Italian. 74 “Ho la netta impressione che tutta la letteratura veristica, quale oggi si va praticando, dal classico romanzo d’amore ai racconti tipo Moravia, non abbia una vera ragione di esistere.... Bisognerebbe scrivere qualcosa di cui il pubblico non possa non interessarsi, anche se, come nel caso di Kafka, non la legge” (Buzzati, Lettere a Brambilla, 230). 75 “Perché è un tedesco molto limpido, molto facile, quello di Kafka” (Buzzati and Panafieu, Dino Buzzati, 29).\n\nIntroduction 23\n\nto me it is even more Kafkaesque than The Trial.”76 Buzzati’s proposed alternative titles, “Il messaggio del Nord” (The message from the north) and “Il deserto dei Tartari” (The desert of the Tartars), also recall works by Kafka.77 ­Adriano Buzzati mentioned giving Il messaggio dell’imperatore (A Message from the Emperor, or The Imperial Message) to his famous brother.78 Linked by their titles and content, both the collection’s titular story and Buzzati’s “I sette messaggeri” (“The Seven Messengers”) highlight the theme of hoped-for occurrences that are doomed to failure.79 In “The Seven Messengers,” a king’s son sets out to reach the frontier beyond his kingdom, but never arrives. Similarly, Kafka’s “The Imperial Message” narrates an ongoing, hopeless process: “No one can force his way through here, least of all with a message from a dead man. – But you sit at your window and dream up that message when evening falls.”80 Of Buzzati’s three proposed titles, the final one, Il deserto dei ­Tartari (The Tartar Steppe) reflects the most subtle connection to Kafka.81 In ­Kafka’s “Before the Law,” which has also been associated with ­Buzzati’s novel, the man from the country notes the doorkeeper’s “long thin black Tartar beard.”82 In part because he closely observes the doorkeeper’s appearance, the man “decides that it would be better, after all, to wait until he has permission to enter,”83 suggesting that the 76 “Ho letto 140 pagine del Castello poi mi sono fermato, benché sia una cosa ­impressionante. Ma in questo periodo ho bisogno di leggere libri stupidi e gai come quelli di Wodehouse. Scrivimi cosa ti sembra il Castello. È più Kafkiano ancora del Processo, mi sembra” (Buzzati, 230–1). For a discussion of the title change, see ­Nerenberg, Prison Terms, 33. For more on the history of the original title and the ­production of the manuscript, see Germani, L’attesa e l’ignoto, 92. 77 Viganò, Album Buzzati, 157. 78 Ioli, Dino Buzzati, 86. See also Asquer, La grande torre, 83–4. 79 Lazzarin refers to “The Imperial Message” as the Kafka text that Buzzati had “best memorized” (Lazzarin, “Note sulla contaminazione delle fonti nella narrativa breve di Buzzati,” 11). See Bárberi Squarotti for an analysis of the two stories (“Forme simboliche,” 115–17). 80 Kafka, The Transformation, 175. “Niemand dringt durch und gar mit der Botschaft eines Toten. – Du aber sitzt an Deinem Fenster und erträumst sie Dir, wenn der Abend kommt” (Kafka, Erzählungen, 306). 81 Giulio Savelli has read “Before the Law” as the model parable for tracing the theme of destiny in Buzzati’s work, especially in his famous novel (Savelli, “Una struttura del destino in Buzzati,” 126). 82 Kafka, Kafka’s Selected Stories (hereafter cited as KSS), 68 (“den langen, dünnen, schawrzen tatrischen Bart”; Kafka, Erzählungen, 162). 83 KSS, 68. (“Das Gesetz soll doch jedem und immer zugänglich sein, denkt er, aber als er jetzt den Türhüter in seinem Pelzmantel genauer ansieht, seine große Spitznase, den langen, dünnen, schwarzen tatarischen Bart, entschließt er sich, doch lieber zu warten, bis er die Erlaubnis zum Eintritt bekommt”; Kafka, Erzählungen, 162.)\n\n24\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nbeard contributes to the man’s decision to wait forever by the door. The unusual detail of the Tartar beard raises the question of where this door is located, suggesting the work’s “transnational” character.84 Similar to how the meaning of the guardian’s strange, specifically described beard remains a point of examination, the Tartars in Buzzati’s novel prompt various theories about its setting. The protagonist himself wonders about the desert’s unusual name: “‘That’s right – a desert. Stones and parched earth – they call it the Tartar steppe.’ ‘Why Tartar?,’ asked Drogo. ‘Were there ever Tartars there?’ ‘Long, long ago, I believe. But it is a legend more than anything else.’”85 The double answer to Drogo’s question about the Tartars, that the desert’s name is inspired both by fiction and by history, provides one answer to the debate about whether Kafka’s literature or Buzzati’s ­experience inspired Buzzati’s novel. Both led to it, and it is difficult to know the comparative degrees of their influence. At the same time, the novel is separate from them as the desert exists regardless of the origins of its name. Although reading Kafka influenced Buzzati, ­Buzzati’s work is not derivative. Comparing Kafka and Buzzati will also put into relief elements of Buzzati’s fiction that distinguish his work from Kafka’s. Since some critics used Kafka to degrade Buzzati, Buzzati and some of his supporters responded by proclaiming that there his writings show few similarities to Kafka’s. Buzzati goes so far as to claim that he had not read Kafka until after having written his most Kafkaesque works, although, as mentioned, his personal correspondence reveals that he had read Kafka in the 1930s, before writing The Tartar Steppe.86 ­Following in the footsteps not only of Kafka but also of past Italian authors like Renato Poggioli and Italo Calvino, who looked for traces of Kafka in 84 Suchoff, Kafka’s Jewish Languages, 43. 85 Buzzati, The Tartar, 11. (“‘Un deserto effettivamente, pietre e terra secca, lo chiamano il deserto dei Tartari.’ Drogo domandò: ‘Perché dei Tartari? C’erano dei Tartari?’ ‘Anticamente, credo. Ma più che altro una leggenda’”; Buzzati, Il deserto, 13.) 86 Following Buzzati’s suggestion, his friend Indro Montanelli argues that Buzzati’s The Tartar Steppe was inspired by his experiences at Il Corriere della Sera, not Kafka (­Montanelli, “Nella malattia,” 75). The relationship between Kafka and Buzzati ­became a point of debate not only for Italian authors discussing Buzzati’s literary m ­ erits and inspirations but also for critics discussing Kafkaesque literature, what this category could mean, and intertextuality. Kafka is a starting point in Valentina Polcini’s broader discussion of Buzzati and intertextuality, Dino Buzzati and Anglo-American Culture. ­Joseph Strelka summarizes the public debates about Kafka and Buzzati: “When the Italian writer Dino Buzzati, whose novel Il deserto dei Tartari (The Tartar Steppe) ­appeared in 1940, received the high literary award, Premio Strega, in 1958, the jury was accused of having wasted the prize on an author who had achieved nothing but to popularize a difficult author, namely Kafka” (Strelka, “Kafkaesque Elements,” 439).\n\nIntroduction 25\n\nPrague, Buzzati journeyed to the northern European city and then wrote about the experience.87 He reflected on his reaction to being constantly compared with Kafka in the resulting piece in Corriere della Sera: From the very beginning of my writing career, Kafka has been my cross. I have not written a story, novel, or play in which someone has not perceived resemblances, derivations, imitations or simply shameless plagiarisms at the Czech writer’s expense. Several critics proclaimed ­ guilty analogies even when I sent a telegram or filled out official forms. All this has determined my attitude toward Kafka for many years: I have suffered not from an inferiority complex but from an annoyance complex. The result has been that I have lost any desire to read his work, as well as biographies and essays that deal with him.88\n\nFinding the constant comparison to Kafka irritating, Buzzati suggests that if a critic is looking for Kafka’s influence, it can be seen everywhere, even in routine communications. Is there anything in the modern world that is not Kafkaesque? In “Le case di Kafka” (“Kafka’s Houses”), ­Buzzati humorously points to the danger of over-identifying his work with Kafka’s. Throughout much of his life, he campaigned to distance himself from Kafka as much as possible. The critical focus on how much Buzzati was perhaps influenced by Kafka contrasts with Morante’s open dedication to Kafka, which critics generally ignore. Both authors read Kafka in the 1930s and discussed in personal correspondence the influence of his prose.89 Morante also publicly related Kafka’s effect on her. The potential reasons that ­Kafka’s significance to Morante’s development have often been overlooked are numerous, including her less familiar conception of Kafka’s work, her putative distance from literary scenes, and the fact that she is a woman.\n\n87 Renato Poggioli went to Prague to discuss Kafka with Max Brod and then published an article on him in Solaria in 1934. Calvino commented on looking for Kafka’s ghost during his 1947 trip to Prague. 88 Buzzati, “Kafka’s Houses,” 143; trans. modified. (“Da quando ho cominciato a scrivere, Kafka è stato la mia croce. Non c’è stato mio racconto, romanzo, commedia dove qualcuno non ravvisasse somiglianze, derivazioni, imitazioni o addirittura sfrontati plagi a spese dello scrittore boemo. Alcuni critici denunciavano colpevoli analogie con Kafka anche quando spedivo un telegramma o compilavo il modulo Vanoni. Tutto questo da molti anni ha determinato in me, nei riguardi di Franz Kafka, non un complesso di inferiorità ma un complesso di fastidio. Da allora non ho voluto più leggere cose sue, né biografie, né saggi che lo riguardavano”; Buzzati, “Le case di Kafka.”) 89 Lazzarin and Zangrilli have discussed this; see, e.g., Lazzarin, Il Buzzati “secondo,” 92–3.\n\n26\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny complements the field-changing studies by ­Sharon Wood, Adalgisa Giorgio, Stefania Lucamante, Danielle Hipkins, and Laura Lazzari, which concentrate on women authors, by putting these authors in a different genealogy.90 Both Lalla Romano, discussed in the second chapter, and Paola Capriolo, analysed in the third chapter, have been compared to Kafka in a pejorative manner. While Italian and non-Italian male authors have also been framed as sub-par ­Kafkas or poor Kafka imitators, the comparison of female Italian authors with Kafka has on more than one occasion suggested misogynistically that they dared to compare themselves with Kafka or write like him. The modern Italian canon itself is debated, and the place of women ­writers in it is even more varied. This book puts Italian ­female ­writers into conversation with Kafka and male co-nationals, with the aim of showing how Kafka’s work, and critical studies on him, can reveal less noted elements of Italian fiction, including certain women writers.91 ­Although ­Natalia Ginzburg, Elsa Morante, Lalla Romano, Paola C ­ apriolo, and Elena ­Ferrante will be discussed, and while issues of gender are ­significant in several of the examinations, the primary aim is to rethink the categories in which Italian authors are placed, including “women writers.” Kafka’s Italian Progeny: An Overview In “Kafka and His Precursors,” Jorge Luis Borges discusses recognizing Kafka in writers that came before him, including Han Yu, Kierkegaard, Browning, Léon Bloy, and Lord Dunsany.92 Borges’s project can be distinguished from the idea of influence since, first of all, the authors he mentions were not ones whom Kafka necessarily read. Like any ­author’s personal list (one need think only of Calvino’s examples in Six Memos), Borges’s precursors for Kafka appear idiosyncratic, which is part of his point. He proposes that Kafka’s body of work means that other authors are read differently in light of it. Just as every powerful author creates his or her own precursors, so an author creates his or her own successors. Kafka’s Italian Progeny draws on the Borgesian idea of Kafka’s successors, concentrating on one nation, Italy. 90 See Lucamante, A Multitude of Women; Giorgio, “The Passion for the Mother”; Wood, Italian Women’s Writing; and Hipkins, Contemporary Italian Women Writers. 91 Many of the authors discussed, including Ginzburg, Morante, and Capriolo, also resisted or resented being categorized as a “female” or “woman” author. 92 “Once I planned to make a survey of Kafka’s precursors. At first I thought he was as singular as the fabulous phoenix; when I knew him better I thought I recognized his voice, or his habits, in the texts of various literatures and various ages” (Borges, “Kafka and His Precursors,” 199).\n\nIntroduction 27\n\nThis book’s idiosyncrasies are primarily based on the critical r­ eception of Kafka in Italy, and each chapter groups together different authors based on their “family resemblance” to a particular element of Kafka’s work. In Borges’s words, “Not all of them resemble each other,” but all resemble Kafka. While Kafka’s reception helps guide the choice of authors, analysing the extent of Kafka’s influence is not the goal of Kafka’s Italian Progeny.93 Although many of the Italian successors I discuss mention Kafka’s impact, more significant is how putting their work into conversation with Kafka modifies the critical conception of Italian literature. Several studies explore various authors using Kafka as the particular lens. While they generally have chapters or sections dedicated to an ­individual author, such as Coetzee, Roth, Sebald, Bellow, Mailer, ­Salinger, Camus, Robbe-Grillet, Beckett, or Ionesco, my chapters treat multiple Italian authors.94 The groupings are based on readings of Kafka, and the members of each group share certain similarities, but the qualities that link the authors together will vary. Instead of focusing on direct, linear inheritances, these Italian authors are connected through Kafka and each other through family resemblances. In an exploration of how to link together all the things we call games, “board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games,”95 Ludwig Wittgenstein employs the term “family resemblances” to define the characteristics that group extremely different entities together.96 As the terms family resemblances and progeny imply, the chapters do not aim to present a uniform picture of Kafka or Italian literature; rather, they draw on the diversity of both to fill in gaps that discussions of Italy’s literary movements, regions, and authors have left. Drawing attention to unnoted aspects of well-known Italian authors and some lesser-studied ones, this investigation of a Kafkan tradition suggests one way to construct an identity of modern Italian literature that is not primarily determined by chronological or geographical ­criteria. Using diverse approaches to explore the thematic, generic, 93 “The word ‘precursor’ is indispensable in the vocabulary of criticism, but one should try to purify it from every connotation of polemic or rivalry. The fact is that each writer creates his precursors. His work modifies our conception of the past, as it will modify the future” (Borges, 201). 94 See Sandbank, After Kafka; Whitlark, Behind the Great Wall; Weinberg, The New Novel in America; and Medin, Three Sons. 95 Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, 27e. 96 “I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than ‘­family resemblances’; for the various resemblances between members of a family” (­Wittgenstein, 28e).\n\n28\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nhistorical, and cultural connections between Kafka’s works and those of Italian authors, this book analyses a Kafkan tradition in Italian modern literature that encompasses a diverse group of authors, thereby complementing other works, such as Gino Tellini’s “The Wine and the ­Cellars: On the Twentieth-Century Italian Novel” and Luca Somigli’s work on modernism, both of which have put a range of Italian authors into conversation with each other and aim to reorient the critical ­perspective in Italian literary studies. While not dedicated to one methodology, since each chapter requires distinct theories, context, and critical thought, this book is based on productive comparisons and attention to the ­formation of the Italian canon. The first three chapters examine how the unique Italian readings of Kafka lead to new understandings of Italian literature. Although generally less well known in the context of Kafka’s oeuvre, the strange American landscape that Kafka describes in his novel Der ­Verschollene (The Man Who Disappeared), also entitled Amerika, has appealed to a number of Italian authors, critics, and directors, who drew on the work in their writing and films. Chapter 1, “Amerika in Italy: Kafka’s Realism, Pavese, and Calvino,” examines the convergence of factors that contributed to the novel’s popularity in Italy as well as what this particular perception of Amerika, in turn, reveals about Italian literature, especially Calvino’s and Pavese’s. The Italian tradition of reading Kafka as a realist writer helps explain the Italian fascination with ­Amerika and raises the question of how much categories guide critical readings. Revealing Kafka’s significance for Italian depictions of the United States, the chapter concludes with an examination of the commonalities between Kafka’s and Pavese’s portrayals of America. This particular Italian understanding of Kafka points to the problems of limiting which nations are examined in the reception of works and ideas, which in turn shapes how critics read literature. What Kafka means for the novel has been a source of debate for decades. Edoardo Sanguineti comments that Kafka, along with Proust and Joyce, changed our perception of the novel: “If today we speak about narration, of the novel, how can we still talk of a well-made, organically conceived form, according to solidified models, after Proust, Joyce, and Kafka?”97 While Sanguineti’s other two examples of great novelists are almost synonymous with their famous novels (In Search of Lost Time\n\n97 “Se noi oggi parliamo di narrazione, di romanzo, come possiamo parlare ancora di una forma ben fatta, organicamente pensata, secondo modelli consolidati, dopo Proust, Joyce, Kafka?” (Sanguineti and Galletta, Sanguineti/Novecento, 49–50).\n\nIntroduction 29\n\nand Ulysses), whether Kafka is more often referred to as the author of The Trial or “The Metamorphosis” is debatable.98 Indeed, in his lifetime, Kafka published primarily extremely short fiction. The second chapter asks, building on Sanguineti, “If today we speak about narrations, short stories, how can we still talk about a well-made form after Kafka?” “Dreams of Short Fiction after Kafka: Lalla Romano, Giorgio Manganelli, and Antonio Tabucchi” examines the Kafkan tradition from a formal perspective. Concentrating on a few of Kafka’s very short works, the chapter follows a different sort of Kafka, one that resonates with the dream-like, hard-to-define, short fiction of Tabucchi, Manganelli, and Romano. These authors explore different gender identities, generic possibilities, and ask the reader to imagine with them. They aim not to represent reality but to alter the reader’s view of reality. The Italian authors, pressed by readers who sometimes resisted their modes of writing, present ideas not only on how to understand their works but also on how to understand the experimental short fiction more broadly, ideas that, in turn, can help readers approaching Kafka’s very short fiction. Like chapter 2, chapter 3 concentrates, in part, on the formal ­resemblances between the works of Kafka and those of Italian ­authors. It turns from Kafka’s fragmented, lyrical, very short fiction to the more recognizable Kafka of The Trial and The Castle, and proposes how these novels can be understood within the framework of detective ­fiction. “Processi without End: The Mysteries of Dino Buzzati and Paola ­Capriolo”discusses the relationships between Kafka and Italian ­authors, such as Gadda, Camilleri, Sciascia, Tabucchi, and Eco, who wrote non-traditional detective novels, before analysing Buzzati’s Il ­deserto dei Tartari (The Tartar Steppe) and Capriolo’s Il doppio regno (The Dual Realm) in light of these considerations of Kafka and detective ­fiction. While literary detective novels often provide a critique of how society works and ask readers to question the government, ­instead of reassuring them, the works of Kafka, Buzzati, and Capriolo ask the reader to question all elements of society. The novels of Buzzati\n\n98 Sanguineti himself engaged a very different sort of Kafka, one that has a great deal in common with Kafka’s aphoristic works, the Kafka of Gustav Janouch. Janouch, whose “hagiographic” work has been shown to have numerous factual problems and to be better for inspiring fiction than using as a reliable reference, records conversations he had with Kafka when he knew him towards the end of his life. Sanguineti plays on Janouch’s material and Kafka’s works in his 1959 play, K, which stages a conversation between K (Franz K.) and J (Gustav J.), but which undercuts the seriousness with which Janouch took Kafka.\n\n30\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\nand Capriolo suggest the potential significance of literature and art in ­attempts to find community and question society. The last two chapters are based on themes and critical ­conversations. Following the theme of family throughout Kafka’s fiction and autobiographical work, chapter 4, “Kafka’s Parental Bonds: The F ­ amily as ­Institution in Italian Literature,” examines how Kafka’s work leads to a re-examination of one of the most significant parts of society, the family. The chapter complements Italian studies that concentrate on the figure of the mother in women’s writing by exploring the idea of familial o ­ ppression in Kafka and Svevo, Ginzburg, Calvino, and ­Ferrante. It then offers close readings of familial dynamics in Massimo ­Bontempelli’s Il figlio di due madri (The Son of Two Mothers, published in English with the title The Boy with Two Mothers) and Elsa Morante’s L’isola di Arturo (Arturo’s Island), which interrogate whether the family unit is ­escapable and what an escape would look like. “Kafka’s Parental Bonds” provides an example of how re-imagining critical categories – that is, the institution of motherhood versus parenthood – provides a different view of Italian authors’ works. While in chapter 4 Kafka adds to a lively debate on the family within Italian studies, the last chapter uses him to bring Italian literature into a broader discussion. Chapter 5 returns to the introduction’s discourse on world literature by calling attention to Italian talking animals, which have frequently been ignored by animal studies. “The Human-­Animal Boundary, Italian Style: Kafka’s Red Peter in Conversation with ­Svevo’s Argo, Morante’s Bella, and Landolfi’s Tombo” compares Red Peter from Kafka’s “A Report to an Academy” with some of the talking animals of Landolfi, Svevo, Morante, and Buzzati to explore how the human-­ animal boundary is expressed in twentieth-century Italian l­iterature. Following this thematic connection between Kafka’s and these Italian authors’ stories suggests a similar set of cultural problems: as multilingual, multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary and its language crisis partially explain Kafka’s Red Peter, Italy’s also complex linguistic situation can be viewed as one of the reasons for the many Italian realistically talking animals. The epilogue brings together the various threads of the chapters, with the aid of Calvino, who plays a role in every chapter. The variety of his work that can be associated with Kafka provides a lens through which to view the diversity of Kafkan-Italian encounters and how Kafka can be used to reconfigure the Italian literary landscape. ­Calvino’s readings of Kafka, discussed earlier in the book, as a realist and lyrical, also point to how the more peripheral views of Kafka can lead to a new understanding of the author as well as our concept of the\n\nIntroduction 31\n\nworld-literature views of a famous author. While Kafka’s Italian Progeny is about (roughly in order of appearance) Italo Calvino, Cesare Pavese, Amelia Rosselli, Lalla Romano, Giorgio Manganelli, Antonio Tabucchi, Paola Capriolo, Dino Buzzati, Natalia Ginzburg, Elena F ­ errante, Italo Svevo, Elsa M ­ orante, Massimo Bontempelli, and Tommaso ­Landolfi, it is also about Franz Kafka: my analysis of Italian views of Kafka aims to contribute to the international understanding of Kafka. Kafka’s ­Italian ­Progeny may also prompt a Kafka lover or two to discover some of ­Kafka’s wonderful Italian family members you never knew he had. My other intention is to advance efforts to reorient the field of modern ­Italian studies and shed light on unnoted qualities of great modern Italian literature – to reconsider, in other words, what we mean by a national literary tradition.\n\nChapter One\n\nAmerika in Italy: Kafka’s Realism, Pavese, and Calvino\n\nAmo Kafka perché è realista. I love Kafka because he is a realist. – Italo Calvino Non sarei mai arrivato a Kafka senza aver letto Pavese ... penso che si assomiglino parecchio. I would never have come to Kafka without having read Pavese ... I think that they resemble each other a great deal. – Jean-Marie Straub\n\nIn Franz Kafka’s novel, Amerika, or Der Verschollene (Amerika, or The Man who Disappeared), the protagonist’s boat sails past the Statue of Liberty, which memorably holds a sword in the air, and a bridge connects Manhattan to Boston.1 Although less well known among Kafka’s works, the strange American landscape Kafka describes has appealed to a number of Italian authors, critics, and directors, who drew on it in 1 Amerika is the title Max Brod gave to the work; Der Verschollene is a name Kafka mentioned wanting to give it. Many editions now include both titles, and some update it to just Der Verschollene. The issue is made even more complicated in E ­ nglish since “the actual title Der Verschollene defies any simple English translation” (Anderson, Kafka’s Clothes, 104). Der Verschollene has been translated as The Castaway, The Man Who Disappeared, The One Who Sank Out of Sight, The Missing Person, The Lost One, Lost without a Trace, The Man Who Was Lost Sight Of, Missing Presumed Dead, The Boy Who Was Missing, The Boy Who Was Never Heard of Again, The Boy Who Was Never More Heard Of, and The Boy Who Was Lost and Never Heard from Again. Given the growing tendency to refer to Kafka’s book using a version of “his” title (Der Verschollene) and the sheer number of English translations, I would refer to it as Der Verschollene, but the figures discussed in this chapter (Pavese, Calvino, Fortini, Fellini) knew the work as America (Amerika), and the connotations of the title remain important for this chapter.\n\nAmerika in Italy\n\n33\n\ntheir writing and films. Italo Calvino mentioned more than once that Amerika was his favourite novel: “My author is Kafka and my favorite novel is Amerika.”2 Often included with Kafka’s other short stories, the first chapter of Amerika, “Der Heizer” (“The Stoker”) has been issued repeatedly as a free-standing volume in Italy, as “The Metamorphosis” frequently is in many countries.3 The order in which Kafka’s three novels were published reveals both a reason for, and provides evidence of, Amerika’s remarkable place in the Italian literary landscape: instead of being the last of Kafka’s novels published, as it was in German, English, French, Polish, Norwegian, ­Japanese, Danish, Dutch, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, Czech, and Hungarian, it was published after The Trial and before The Castle.4 Revealing how publication order influences interpretation, Walter Benjamin calls the novel’s protagonist, Karl Rossmann, “the third and happier incarnation of K.”5 This chapter will examine the convergence of factors that contributed to the novel’s popularity in Italy as well as what this ­particular perception of Amerika reveals about Italian literature, especially Italo Calvino’s early works and Cesare Pavese’s La luna e i falò (The Moon and the Bonfires). The Italian interest in Kafka’s Amerika, published in Italian in 1945, is, in part, due to the presence of America in the Italian cultural imagination, which also relates to Italian immigration to the United States. In 1950, critic and author Giuseppe Antonio Borgese published a review of Amerika from the United States, in which he compared his experiences of the country with the America portrayed by Kafka: “After almost twenty years in this country, it is time to visit it with Kafka’s guidance.”6 2 Calvino, “The Art of Fiction.” The interview is a collage of materials from the ­interviews with Calvino owned by the Paris Review, and Calvino’s statement is a response to the question, “Were you influenced by Joyce or any of the modernists?” 3 “Il fochista” was published as “Il melangolo” (Kafka, Il fochista, 1993) and “I racconti di Repubblica” (Kafka, Il fochista, 1997). 4 Shimon Sandbank surmises, “The particular influence of The Castle (in English) may have to do with the fact this was the first work by Kafka to be published in ­English” (Sandbank, After Kafka, 116), and he examines four novels influenced by The Castle that existed before the Italian translation was available. The prefaces of the ­English-language and Italian publications of America locate The Castle in very different places within Kafka’s oeuvre. 5 Benjamin, Illuminations, 119 (emphasis added). 6 “Dopo quasi vent’anni in questo paese, è tempo di visitarlo sotto la guida di Kafka” (Borgese, “In Amerika con Kafka,” 253). Borgese left Italy because of fascist policies and married Thomas Mann’s daughter in 1939. Mann was an early supporter of Kafka as well. The circulation of Kafka among German émigrés in America is perhaps best known in the story about Thomas Mann lending Einstein Kafka. While there has been a sizeable focus on German émigrés in America and Italians in America, both in isolation, of course they also frequently interacted (and sometimes even married).\n\n34\n\nKafka’s Italian Progeny\n\n­ lthough Kafka himself had never seen America, his novel belongs to A the group of literary and cinematic works portraying America that contributed to the Italian idea of the United States. The myth of America as a land of opportunity was especially prominent in 1940s and 1950s ­Italy.7 Several Italian authors associated it with a concept of realism, especially during the fascist period.8 Many important Italian works from the 1930s to the 1950s, such as Carlo Levi’s Cristo si è fermato a Eboli (Christ Stopped at Eboli, 1945), Mario Soldati’s America primo amore (America First Love, 1935, reissued by Einaudi in 1945), and Cesare Pavese’s La luna e i falò (The Moon and the Bonfires, 1950), explore or employ this myth. S ­ tarting with his 1930 essay on Sinclair Lewis, Pavese played a particularly significant role in propagating the myth of America.9 Critical studies generally focus on three main sources for these Italian literary depictions of America: the reports, oral and written, of Italians who spent time there (such as Soldati), the Italian reception of literary works by Americans (such as Pavese’s translations and essays), and the Italian consumption of American films.10 While not arising directly out of Italian-American exchanges, other European representations of America helped shape it in the Italian literary imagination. These works are not only part of a broader European image of America; they also ­often influenced each other. Because the American-Italian relationship is usually considered to be one between two countries, the United States and Italy, Kafka’s Amerika tends to be ignored in discussions of Italian depictions of the United States, despite the novel’s presence. Given its notable Italian reception and publication date, it merits attention when examining Italian literary depictions of the United States. This chapter outlines the reasons for Amerika’s Italian reception, including the idea\n\n7 In an article from 1959, Golino notes the widespread popularity of mythic ­America in Italy: “Strange as this may seem it is even stranger to realize that until very recently this mythical concept of America has existed in Italy, not only for the peasants, but for people of all classes” (Golino, “On the Italian ‘Myth’ of America,” 19). For an interesting discussion of the role of the American west and cowboys in postwar Italy (and how these concepts intersected with Italy’s own self-conception), see Leake, Tex Willer: Un cowboy nell’Italia del dopoguerra. 8 See Cecchi, “Introduzione.” 9 Dominique Fernandez dates the beginning of the Italian intellectual myth of ­America to Pavese’s 1930 essay on Sinclair Lewis and its end to Pavese’s death in 1950. 10 See, e.g., Heiney’s discussion of Pavese’s sources for The Moon and the Bonfires, which include American films, talking to emigrants, and American literature (Heiney, A"
