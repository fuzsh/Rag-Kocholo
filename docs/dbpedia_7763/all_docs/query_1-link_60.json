        "text": "The Flower Parade returns after a 4-year hiatus, with an “Outdoor” theme this year.\n\nOn Sunday, March 24th, the highly anticipated Corso Fiorito will take place. On Saturday, March 23rd, there will be a parade of marching bands and folk groups.\n\nThe famous parade of flower floats, which revives the tradition of the Sanremo Flower Carnival that originated in the Belle Époque, will for the first time feature floats from Locarno (Switzerland) and Mentone (both will parade out of competition, as will Sanremo).\n\nAnother new feature of this edition is that after the parade, the out-of-competition floats will be positioned at Pian di Nave where they can also be admired in the afternoon.\n\nThe Corso Fiorito is recognized by the MIBACT ministerial decree as one of the most important “Historic Carnival Events”. Organized by the Tourism Department of the Municipality of Sanremo, it is a highly popular event that RAI annually dedicates a special “Linea Verde” to, with truly significant audience figures.\n\nThousands of people flock to Sanremo every year to attend the event.\n\nOn Sunday, March 24th, the parade of floats will start at 10:30 am.\n\nThe ring route will wind its way through the following city streets and squares: Lungomare Italo Calvino – Piazzale Carlo Dapporto – section of the cycle path parallel to Via Nino Bixio up to Giardini Vittorio Veneto.\n\n3 laps are scheduled: the last lap will be filmed by the cameras of Linea Verde (Rai 1).\n\nAccess to the route will be free of charge.\n\nPaid seating (stands) will be positioned on Piazzale Carlo Dapporto, at a cost of 30 euros + presale.\n\nAccess to the stands will be allowed until 9:30 am.\n\nFROM THIS LINK YOU CAN BUY TICKETS\n\nOn the occasion of the Corso Fiorito on Sunday, March 24th, the following extraordinary parking facilities for cars and buses are planned:\n\nBus park: in Via Frantoi Canai (next to the Mercato dei Fiori) for a fee of 60 euros for the whole day, with the possibility of payment on site.\n\nBus park: in Corso Marconi (bus lane) for a fee of 60 euros for the whole day, with the possibility of payment on site.\n\nCar park: in Corso Salvo D’Acquisto (South-East area) for a fee of 20 euros for the whole day, with the possibility of payment on site. Access to the area will be allowed from both Via Nobel and Corso Trento Trieste.\n\nCar park: in Via del Castillo at the “Portosole” structure, with dedicated areas, available for a fee according to the methods established by the manager.\n\nPlease note that the usual facilities at the Palafiori (Corso Garibaldi 1) and the Railway Station (Corso Cavallotti) are also available.\n\nInfo\n\nFor further information, please contact the Tourist Office at 0184/580414 or send an email to [indirizzo email rimosso]\n\nA bit of history about the Corso Fiorito\n\nThe Corso Fiorito was born in 1904 with the name “Festa della Dea Flora”. On that occasion, carriages decorated with floral compositions and products from the local area paraded through the streets of Sanremo. The success was such that it became an annual event which, after the war, took the name of “Italia in Fiore” and the flower floats were joined by marching bands and folk groups. There was then a period of interruption from 1966 to 1980, when the event resumed with renewed vigour, becoming one of the flagship events of the calendar of events of the Municipality of Sanremo with the name of “Corso Fiorito”.\n\nIn the second half of the 1990s, it experienced a new phase of success and notoriety even outside the city limits thanks to the inclusion of the parade and the award ceremony in the “Linea Verde” programme with the name of “Sanremoinfiore”, to a new and more regular format such as the assignment, each year, of a theme on which the masters of floral composition are called to compete, and to the vote of a jury, also composed of well-known personalities.\n\nORDINE DI USCITA DEI CARRI/ABBINAMENTO\n\nFuori concorso: Locarno, Mentone\n\nDA QUESTO LINK È POSSIBILE ACQUISTARE I BIGLIETTI"
