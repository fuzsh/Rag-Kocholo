        "text": "It is located in the historic and splendid Langhe region Bareu o Bareul, to put it in the manner of those who live in Piedmont. This is the splendid and historic village of Barolo, located on a small plateau. Impossible not to fall in love with the beautiful castle that stands, from which you can admire the surrounding nature and the many vineyards. These characterize the territory, where the prestigious Barolo wine is born, to be tasted necessarily if you are in the area and you are not a teetotaler.\n\nThe history of Barolo\n\nThe documents received trace the first settlements in the early Middle Ages. They would be of barbaric origin, with Berengario I responsible for the erection of the first nucleus of the castle that we admire today. Its role was defensive and the threat, at the time, was represented by the Saracens. In 1250 the history of the village changed radically with the intervention of the Falletti family. Many possessions purchased and in 1300 there were about fifty Piedmontese fiefdoms placed under their control.\n\nToday it is clear how cultivation and viticulture represent a constant commitment on the part of a large part of the local population. A huge source of income, compared to a wine famous in the world. However, there was no lack of black periods for this sector. Abandoned fields for office work and not only in the surrounding large cities. A nightmare for the area, thankfully left behind.\n\nWhat to see in Barolo\n\nWine lovers cannot fail to visit Barolo once in a lifetime. This variety somehow permeates the entire center, which boasts a placid rhythm, far removed from that of the city. An almost Spanish calm, thanks to which you can let go of an enormous dose of your stress and simply enjoy the natural landscapes and architectural beauties of the place.\n\nTo visit the Castle of the Marquises Falletti, which inside boasts the WiMu, which stands for Barolo Ethnographic and Oenological Museum. To appreciate the Barolo Chapel by Sol LeWitt and David Tremlett. An ambitious project to say the least, which now boasts more than 20 years. A work of recovery and enhancement of the environmental context, characterized by numerous interventions of contemporary art. Among the most important buildings in the area there is also the Chapel of SS. Our Lady of Grace, returned to new life in the modern era after a long period of total abandonment.\n\nWhat to eat\n\nAs mentioned, Barolo is the great protagonist of the territory. Tourists from all over the world come to this area of ​​Piedmont to appreciate its wines, the numerous varieties and perhaps discover the secrets of production by following real wine itineraries. It is surprising that only 11 municipalities in this area produce Barolo, extracted from Nebbiolo grapes. Tradition is respected and, despite being 2021 and tourism has reached incredible heights, the simplicity of the place remains and is perhaps one of the strengths of the village.\n\nIn addition to an extensive wine list, a mouth-watering gastronomic menu cannot be missing. Try the braised in Barolo or the Cisra, or a tripe and chickpea soup. A poor but exquisite dish, which is said to have been distributed to the faithful during the festivities dedicated to the saints.\n\nSource of the photo: View of Barolo - Megan Mallen BY 2.0"
