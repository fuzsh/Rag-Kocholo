        "text": "The most famous Italian is the discoverer Christopher Columbus (Italian Cristoforo Colombo), who was born in Genoa in 1451 and became famous as the discoverer of America in 1492. Marco Polo (born 1254 in Venice) became known as a world traveller and through the reports of his travels to China.\n\nGalileo Galilei became famous as an Italian universal scholar. He was a philosopher, mathematician, engineer, physicist, astronomer and cosmologist and many of his discoveries – especially in mechanics and astronomy – are still considered groundbreaking today. Leonardo Da Vinci is also considered one of the most famous universal scholars of all time. He was a painter, sculptor, architect, anatomist, mechanic, engineer and natural philosopher. His suffix da Vinci is translated “from Vinci”. He was born in 1452 in the small town west of Florence.\n\nImportant composers and musicians\n\nItalian music has played an important role in European cultural history for centuries. Famous composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini and Antonio Vivaldi and many more have shaped the music history of Italy.\n\nVerdi was born in 1813 in Le Roncole near Busseto in Italy and was a great Italian romantic composer. He composed numerous masterpieces of Italian opera literature such as “Nabucco” (1842), “Rigoletto” (1851) and “La Traviata” (1853).\n\nPuccini’s home is the city of Lucca in Tuscany, where he was born in 1858. With the successful compositions “Manon Lescaut” (1893) and “La Bohème” (1896) he achieved world fame and his works “Tosca” and “Madame Butterfly” and some more are still among the standard works of opera literature today.\n\nAntonio Vivaldi was born in Venice in 1678 and was a Baroque composer and violinist. He has written over 300 instrumental concertos for almost all instruments used in the Baroque period. His four violin concertos “Die vier Jahreszeiten” are probably his most famous work. Vivaldi is still one of the most frequently played baroque composers of our time.\n\nFamous painters and sculptors\n\nOne of Italy’s most famous sculptors and painters is undoubtedly Michelangelo Buonarroti, born in 1475 in Caprese, Tuscany.\n\nHe is considered one of the most important artists of the Italian High Renaissance. With his works such as the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel (1512) or the “David” of Florence (1504), he is still one of Italy’s most famous artists.\n\nThe universal genius Leonardo da Vinci impressed not only as a scientist and philosopher, but also with his famous paintings “The Last Supper” (1494-1498) and the “Mona Lisa” (1503-1506).\n\nRaphael da Urbino, or Raphael for short, was born in March 1483 in Urbino in the Marche. He is considered one of the most famous painters and architects of Italian art of the 15th century and was particularly impressive with his portraits of the Madonna del Granducca and the Madonna with the Stieglitz, which are now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. He also made numerous wall and ceiling paintings, such as the frescoes in the Vatican Palace.\n\nContemporary actors, musicians and fashion icons of Italy\n\nItalian cinema also has several amazing actors who are world-famous for their acting talent and comedy. For example, Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, comedians who made their audience laugh in numerous adventure and western comedies. The beautiful Sophia Loren, born in Rome in 1934, also delighted with films such as “Pride and passion” and “La ciociara”, for which she even won an Oscar.\n\nAmong the musicians Adriano Celentano with his hit “Azzurro” is considered one of Italy’s most famous. He also had some success in the film industry. Eros Ramazotti, Gianna Nannini, Zucchero and Jovanotti have also enjoyed worldwide success.\n\nItalian fashion and its designers are also well-known and successful beyond Italy’s borders. Giorgio Armani, Versace, Moschino, Dolce & Gabbana, Just Cavalli and Zegna, for example, are among Italy’s best-known fashion companies.\n\nBooking and information\n\nFollow in the footsteps of famous personalities on a round trip for groups to Italy!
