        "text": "The paper concentrates on resolving the question: is it possible today to be guided by Marxism as an instrument of social transformation, is this teaching capable of contributing to social advancement? Facts are a stubborn thing: Marxism in its completeness is refuted. But the fact of the collapse of the attempts to put Marxism into practice is not a completely convincing argument against the social doctrine of Marx. The question, ultimately, goes back to the problem of the subjective factor of the moral, theoretical, and political maturity of those who turn Marxism in actual practice.\n\nMarx is nowadays widely recognized as a lucid and useful thinker of capitalism but, at the same, his political project is declared definitively failed. Such a diagnosis is rooted in the context of retreat of socialism and the worker’s movement that goes back to the late 1970s. The “crisis of Marxism”, declared by some of the main Marxist thinkers of that time, is the theoretical reflection of that conjuncture and “Post-Marxism” its immanent development. However, a turning point is reached when it appears that the Post-Marxist constellation is unable to stand to the challenges of the new era of globalized capitalism, strengthened by decades of neoliberalism. Despite the persistent weakness of the political movements claiming its legacy, Marxism still hosts a string a ambitious research projects aiming at understanding the world in order to change it.\n\nMost individuals approach the ideas proposed by Marx in a very stagnant, robotic manner. This is a dangerous thing to do because the dynamic of our current day and age is not taken into consideration. Marx himself, on his deathbed in 1883, proclaimed that “I am not sure of many things in this life but the one thing I am sure of is that I am not a Marxist.” This shows that he wasn’t set in his ways but made space for new findings as they came along. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to briefly look at Marxism and fit it into the context of modernity. The first section will deal with a short description of Marx’s life and various works. His main ideas or propositions will be looked at with specific reference to the ones that are most popular today. The second section will deal with a criticism of Marxism and finally the conclusion will show if Marxism is even relevant in the 21st century at all."
