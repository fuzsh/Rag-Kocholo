His estate is tucked in the hills outside Monforte, in a secluded spot that suits his introspective personality perfectly. As always, the wines are unique and compelling. Roddolo tends to give his wines more time in barrel, almost all neutral than most of his colleagues.\n\nFlavio’s Barolo is brooding, deep, and full of soul. He grew up in the winery he now runs by himself. He is a quiet giant in the world of Piedmonte. He neither craves nor receives the attention he deserves. His production is very limited.\n\nFrancesco Rinaldi e Figli – a date, 1870, and a coat of arms engraved on a vault in the oldest part of the cellar in Barolo. An important starting point summarizing years of history, passion for the hills of Barolo, hard work and devotion to the land that has offered us so much. In the XIX century Giovanni Rinaldi intuitively understood the potential of this farmhouse on the hill planted with vineyards and decided to buy it. After him his children and grandchildren passionately guided the company handing it down generation after generation. The current owners are Paola and Piera Rinaldi, Giovanni’s great granddaughters.\n\nThe philosophy of their company, a blend of Barolo, history and tradition is still inspired by the hill that had charmed Giovanni Rinaldi two centuries earlier. The wines summarize the preciousness of the soil; from compact and silt clayey in the village of Castiglione to more limestoney in La Morra.

Martinetti has always approached wine with patience, knowledge and care. Choosing the ideal variety based on terrain, exposure and age; supervising pruning and thinning bunches in the vineyard; setting the date to begin the harvest; selecting the grapes and proper periods for fermentation, and ageing in casks and bottles. Each stage is carefully supervised, because every detail is fundamental to anyone who aspires to perfection. This constant search for quality is the fruit of real passion, a passion handed down to his sons Guido and Michele who have for some time worked alongside their father at the winery, Guido in oenology and Michele in sales. Visit them at Martinetti.\n\nFrancone – the magical, inimitable combination of sheer determination and a passion for winemaking, in a unique setting: this is Cantina Francone, in the village of Neive, set among the rolling hills of the Langhe area, a stone’s throw from Barbaresco.\n\nThe roots of the company lie in its family tradition, something it has consolidated over time, and its bond with the local area, but its farsighted vision looks to modernization, with great attention to customer service and special care taken over hospitality in the winery.\n\nIn the Francone family the passion for winemaking and wine is handed down from generation to generation, and the traces of the family’s past, the history of an era, are now exhibited in the winery’s museum.

The company owns four hectares of vineyards, three of which are on the sides of the Cannubi hill cultivated with Nebbiolo da Barolo grapes. In the vineyard, the changing seasons, and the character of the grape are both important factors in the cultivation. In the cellar, the vinification and aging processes are very dependent on the traditions and methods passed down to us over the generations. Visit them at Battista Borgogno.\n\nGiacomo Marengo – My family’s origins lie in the Piedmont and Tuscany regions. My father’s side of the family, which comes from La Morra, in Piedmont, has been producing Barolo for more than a century, whereas my mother’s family produced Chianti, Super Tuscans.\n\nOut of my father’s family estate I have retained around three hectares, of which two of Barolo DOCG from the Cerequio and Fontanazza vineyards. I produce my wines with my friend Roberto Voerzio, who keeps aside a small space for me in his wonderful cellar. In our cultivation operations, we go to great lengths to limit the production per vine, through various stringent bunch-thinning interventions, which are carried out manually under my supervision. Production levels sit at an average of less than 500 grams per vine, and this means that the quality of the resultant wines is practically immune to seasonal vicissitudes. Importers will, then, forgive me for the limited number of bottles that will be available for sale. Visit them at Giacomo Marengo.\n\nGiacomo Vico – the history of the “Giacomo Vico” winery can be traced back to the end of the 1800´s. The quality of the wines produced was winning widespread recognition, with the gold medal won at the International Food Fair in Paris in 1909.

The advantages of a small producer like Ramello are endless. “The first ever is to be able to see all my vineyards every day” says Gianni. Visit them at Gianni Ramello.\n\nGiribaldi – was founded at the beginning of the xx century and has now been farming for three generations. One of the main objectives for Giribaldi is to better the qualty of the grapes through a selection of the vine clones, without however leaving behind the other important factors in the vineyard. A new important novelty which has been introduced is the production of biological wine. Visit them at Giribaldi.\n\nGiulia Negri – tradition is everything in this land. I could have banked on the name Barolo and on the history of my family, which has been producing wine at Serradenari for the past 150 years. But life shouldn’t be a big yawn. I started my adventure a few years ago – “I wanted to make wine my way”. I adored my “garagiste” friends and their heretical, dogma-free wines, a handful of amazing bottles produced by forward-looking artisan winemakers. When my family made it possible for me to cultivate grapes and create a small cellar, I bet on Barolo, Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. I planted Pinot Noir and Chardonnay on very special terrain, near a forest known for its truffles, along with cherished Burgundy clones. The Barolo, on the other hand, I let grow laboriously on warmer, sandier terrain. I produce Barolo because I believe it will be the work of art of the future – a mix of ancient polish and modern harmony; a flagship in the winemaking world from America to Asia.\n\nAnd now, I have been noticed and my work has been acknowledged with awards and prizes. But there is no point in becoming bigheaded: This is a challenge that renews itself with every single vintage. The biggest mistake would be to think that going forward, it’s going to be all downhill. Nonetheless, now that the Baroloboys have grown up, time may have come for us, the Barologirls. Visit Giulia at Giulia Negri.\n\nGuasti Clemente – was founded in 1946 in Nizza Monferrato.

After a period of pause in the 90s, Sarah, daughter of Robert and Josetta, decided to devote herself to the family vineyards. Sara represents the fourth generation of farmers and with the same dedication is committed to perpetuate a tradition now over two hundred years.\n\nWhy Gnomes? Ernesto Saffirio kept a mind of a child, despite evidence that life had undergone. In the evenings, he was used to tell to her small Josetta, that he saw in the courtyard of the farmhouse of Castelletto, a gnome with a cart pulled by mice. So it was that Josetta plotting these tales to his children Sara and Alessio, dedicating wines to these characters that help the farmers of the forest taking care of the animals and checking the basement, in exchange for a little wine. The wholesomeness and sweetness which refer to these illustrations, this label is famous all over the world. Visit them at Josetta Saffirio.\n\nLa Bioca – is a small winery in the Langhe zone. Their vineyards are situated in the villages of Monforte d’Alba (Bussia, San Sebastiano subzones), Novello (Ravera), La Morra (Castagni & Croera) and Verduno.

Visit them at La Rachilana.\n\nLa Spinetta “making wines with passion” – The Rivetti family story begins in the 1890s, when Giovanni Rivetti, grandfather of the three Rivetti brothers, Carlo, Bruno and Giorgio, left Piedmont for Argentina. Like many Italians of that time, he dreamed of returning rich and a powerful man, perhaps even one day able to make a great wine in his homeland. He never did, though his son, Giuseppe (nicknamed Pin) did. Pin married Lidia, bought vineyards and began to make wine. In 1977 the family took up residence at LA SPINETTA (top of the hill) in Castagnole Lanze. In 2000 the family’s ambition of also making a Barolo became reality. The Rivettis acquired vineyards in Grinzane Cavour and built a state of the art cellar, Barolo Campè. Since 2003 visitors are welcomed to visit also Campè, outside the town of Grinzane Cavour.

The “Ginestre” vineyard in Grinzane Cavour faces south on marly-calcareous soil; the “Baudana” vineyard in Serralunga d’Alba faces south-west on sandyish calcareous soil, which gives Barolo more marked aromas; the “Sotto Castello” vineyard in Novello faces south-south-west on mainly marly soil, while the southernmost area of the vineyard is less fertile, with a higher content of tufa and limestone. Visit them at Le Ginestre.\n\nLivia Fontana – is located in the heart of the Barolo area in the community of Castiglione Falletto. Our vinery can look back to the experience of 7 generations, 200 years tradition of wine production.

It produces ancient Barolo´s, but with young and flooding sound of long and intense breath that slowly emerges. Barolo Rocche and Barolo Rocchette stands for a long time and they are bottled only after they have received Lorenzo´s placet, a year later than the other producers on average.\n\nLorenzo´s agricultural company is not that big, only a little more than 3 hectares of low range vineyard all around the house and the wine cellar, and it´s family run. The Barolo in which the Accomasso family has always trusted in comes from Rocchette, a small land in the middle of the Rocche dell`Annunziata. Lorenzo was one of the first, if not the first in absolute, in that zone to selected-variety winemaking.\n\nLuigi Oberto – is a very small vinery located in La Morra established by Luigi Oberto and his wife Silvana in 1976. Today his son Andrea is involved producing Barolo from cru Rocche Torriglione.\n\nLuigi Oddero – since 1878 the Oddero family has been synonymous with tradition and high quality Nebbiolo wines from the Langhes top vineyards and it was in 1951 when brothers Giacomo and Luigi Oddero began bottling their family’s wines.\n\nIn 2006, after fifty years of passionately tending the vine and making the wine (while Giacomo was ‘front of house’), Luigi was obliged to leave the family domaine in La Morra and create his own label. He took with him his wife Lena, their young children Giovanni and Maria, as well as 32 hectare of prime vineyards.\n\nWith Luigi’s loss in 2009, Lena Oddero is now managing the estate, aided by her faithful team of Gregorio (winemaker) and Alberto Zaccarelli (sales). Dante Scaglione, former winemaker at Bruno Giacosa, now consults. The wines are traditionally and respectfully made, aged in large Gamba oak botte, and the product of fruit grown in the villages of La Morra, Castiglione Falletto and Serralunga d’Alba.\n\nMassimo Rattalino – his aim is to realize something unique “cultivate the vines in order to obtain extraordinary grapes and produce wines of the best quality”.\n\nThe dream of dedicating my life to viticulture, the passion for prestigious wine, the fondness for the oenological tradition of the Piedmont region soon became an ambitious project: to produce wines predominantly from Nebbiolo grapes and bet on this unique, ancient vine, which is convenient for the new and more exigent international markets. Visit them at Massimo Rattalino.\n\nManzone Giovanni – Giovanni Manzone is located in MONFORTE D’ALBA, Piedmont since 1925. The entire production is focused on high quality and limited to about 50,000 bottles per year, using only estate-grown grapes. The HISTORY of this family-estate began in 1925 when Giovanni Manzone purchased “Ciabot del Preve” (the residence of the Parish of the nearby town of Castelletto). In 1965, Giovanni and Stefano Manzone bottled the first wines and they purchased important vineyards on the historic hill of “GRAMOLERE”, in Monforte d’Alba. In 2005, Mauro Manzone joined his father Giovanni in the management of the winery. Mauro graduated from the famed Oenology School of Alba. At the estate the principles of pure, natural, non-invasive agriculture are followed. No insecticides or fertilizers have ever been used. Manzone’s HIGH-ELEVATION vineyards (450 metres, 1,500 feet), their EXTREME STEEPNESS and the GREAT TERROIR foster naturally low-yielding vines which produce wines that are approachable while young, yet remain amongst the most concentrated and longest-lived of all Barolos. Visit them at Manzone Giovanni.\n\nMarchesi di Barolo – is a historical cellar located in the town of Barolo. The story begins precisely in 1807, in Paris, when the Marquis of Barolo Carlo Tancredi Falletti married Juliette Colbert de Maulévrier, a French noblewoman and the great granddaughter of the Sun King’s well-known Minister of Finance. Juliette saw the great potential of the wine made in Barolo. Juliette died in 1864, and today Marchesi di Barolo is still a family business owned by Anna and Ernesto Abbona – the 5th generation.\n\nMarchesi di Barolo controls approximately 120 hectares of vineyards and produces wines from the major indigenous varieties of Langhe, Roero and Monferrato.

These two plots have belonged to the Marengo family for three generations. The first vintage of Barolo to be bottled with Le Brunate on the label was 1974 while Barolo Bricco Viole was labelled as such starting from the 1997 vintage. Visit them at Mauro Marengo.\n\nMauro Veglio – to understand their history, you must return to the beginning of the 1900s in the village of Ciotto near La Morra. In this cluster of houses, the Veglio family has been dedicated to working the land for generations. To be a farmer in the Langhe meant bending over the vines, cultivating orchards and gardens, raising livestock, and inventing new ways of getting by every day.\n\nAngelo Veglio was born in 1928 and startet the winery. Of Angelo’s three sons, only Mauro followed in the footsteps of his father. In the 1980s, not many people were willing to bet on Barolo, even though it was the most promising challenge in winemaking. In 1986 at 25 years old, Mauro took over the management of the winery after his father came down with an illness. This was when the winery and farmhouse underwent restoration, the vineyards were renewed, and the first experiments in winemaking were carried out. Visit them at Mauro Veglio.\n\nNegretti Vini – the Negretti family’s roots have always firmly set in their passion and love for wine.

The winery is an old building in the center of the village, where, since 1870, wine and life have established a strong pair. In the winery the historical evidence is everywhere: the outdoor wall stone plaque dates the house to 1870 and tells about an 80.000 Liras bequest. This sum of money was used to start a wine production business. The cousins Maurilio and Mauro Palladino bought the winery in 1974 and started the wine production in bottles in 1978, after a renovation. Visit them at Palladino.\n\nPaolo Manzone – the estate is of approx, 10 ha. cultivating different grapes where 4 have. is Nebbiolo for Barolo.

In the early 90s Gianpaolo, Luigi’s son, started to take part in the winery management, and the wine quality became the key factor. Today Gianpaolo is flanked by his brothers Romolo and Claudio.\n\nStarting from the 90s, the winery has been refurbished to enable the production of high quality Barolo. The venues were restored and enlarged, the equipment was replaced keeping a balance between tradition and technology. Pira Luigi produces quality, thanks to the special features of the grapes cultivated in the area of Serralunga d’Alba.\n\nFermentation occurs in automatic fermentation tanks with temperature control, while for the ageing they use both small 225 or 500-l French oak barrels and large 2500-l Slavonian oak barrels, depending on the wine. Wood is skillfully used: it is a means to further enhance Barolo, but only if it is possible to achieve the correct balance between the wine, its territory, tradition and innovation. Visit them at Pira Luigi.\n\nPoderi Aldo Conterno – In the 19th century, the forefathers of Aldo Conterno emigrated to Argentina, but on account of various family vicissitudes they returned to Italy after a few years. It was then that Giovanni Conterno brought his family back to the small winemaking farm of his father Giuseppe in Monforte d’Alba and started helping him in the production of local wine. His sons Giovanni and Aldo began to assist and follow their father in running the business. In the mid-’50s Aldo decided to set out for America.\n\nThe five-year experience in the United States had kindled within Aldo a desire to establish a business of his own. It was for this reason that he decided, after working for a considerable time alongside his brother, to carry out the dream which had been interrupted in America. He bought the “Favot” farm and founded the estate “Poderi Aldo Conterno” in 1969. Today the company is run by three sons of Aldo : Franco, Stefano and Giacomo who followed in the footsteps of their father carry on the family tradition. Visit them at Aldo Conterno.\n\nPoderi Luigi Einaudi – The winery, which already in the first years of the 1920’s bottled and distributed Barolo, was completely renovated in 1993.

Please cisit them at Oddero.\n\nRivetto – The vineyards before all else. For wines to be an authentic expression of their territory, it is necessary to trust the vineyard and lead it toward self-regulation. This is why our wine-making is minimalist: sometimes we think it’s better to not take action. No synthetic chemicals for weeds, defence or fertiliser. No aggressive handling of the soil or the vines.
