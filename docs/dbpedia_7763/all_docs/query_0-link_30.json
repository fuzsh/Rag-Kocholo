        "text": "An investigation into the presence of petrol on the clothing and shoes of members of the public.\n\nPubMed\n\nCoulson, Sally; Morgan-Smith, Rian; Mitchell, Susan; McBriar, Todd\n\n2008-02-25\n\nFirst, the clothing and shoes from 29 participants who had recently filled their vehicles with petrol were analysed for any traces of petrol. No traces of petrol were found on any of these items. Secondly, the clothing and shoes from 17 participants who had recently used a petrol-powered lawn mower were also analysed for petrol. Petrol was detected on two pairs of shoes from different participants. Components of petrol were detected on a set of clothing from a third participant, however, there were insufficient components present in this sample to confirm the presence of petrol. No traces of petrol were found on the items from the remaining 14 participants. Thirdly, the clothing from a forecourt attendant, a mechanic and a professional lawn mower were analysed at the end of a number of shifts. Petrol was detected on the upper and lower clothing from the forecourt attendant at the end of one shift. No petrol residues were found on the forecourt attendant after a second shift, or on the mechanic's clothing after two separate shifts or on the professional lawn mower's clothing after three separate shifts. These results can be used to assist the forensic analyst in assessing the chance of finding traces of petrol on clothing and shoes after the wearer has performed common activities that involve petrol.\n\nSome Biochemical and Hematological Parameters among Petrol Station Attendants: A Comparative Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbou-ElWafa, Hala Samir; Albadry, Ahmed A.; Bazeed, Fagr B.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective. To describe selected biochemical and hematological parameters (blood picture, liver enzymes, and kidney functions) in petrol station attendants in Mansoura city. Methods. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. The exposed group included 102 petrol station attendants. They were compared to a matched group of healthy 102 male service and office workers at the Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University. The results of blood picture, liver enzymes, and kidney functions were compared between both groups. Results. Mean Red Blood Cells (RBCs) count, hemoglobin level, and Hematocrit (HCT) level were significantly lower in petrol station attendants than the comparison group. All other blood picture parameters showed nonsignificant difference between both groups. Liver enzymes, renal functions, serum albumin, and total protein showed statistically nonsignificant difference between both groups except for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) which was significantly higher in petrol station attendants. Conclusions. Some laboratory parameters among petrol station attendants showed changes that could be attributed to workplace exposure and should be given attention at preemployment and periodic medical examination.

While rehabilitation programs can rely on such skills to educate clients and achieve treatment outcomes, cognitive function is rarely assessed on admission. This is particularly true for Indigenous populations where standard assessments are not appropriate. This paper describes a process for assessing cognition in Indigenous Australians. Two studies investigate firstly the demographic factors impacting on cognition for healthy Indigenous Australians and secondly the utility of the assessment process for detecting petrol sniffing related cognitive impairments. Study One assessed a naturalistic sample of healthy Indigenous Australians from the Northern Territory (N = 206; mean age = 28.03) on computerised tests of psychomotor speed, visual attention, memory, learning, spatial awareness and executive functions. Multiple regression analyses determined the unique contributions of six factors (age, education, gender, familiarity with computers, regular long term cannabis use and locality) to the variance in performance for this group. Study Two examined group differences in cognitive performance on the same tests between healthy Indigenous Australians (N = 96) and Indigenous petrol sniffers (N = 50; both age restricted to < 26 years) while controlling those factors found to impact on performance from Study One. Age, computer familiarity, and education significantly contributed to the variance in performance measures. While controlling these factors, petrol abuse was associated with poorer performance on complex tasks of psychomotor, visual attention, memory, learning, spatial awareness and executive function. This assessment process is useful for detecting substance abuse related impairments in Indigenous Australians and when using this assessment process, age and computer familiarity in particular should be controlled for.\n\nExposure to chemical hazards in petrol pumps stations in Ahvaz City, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nZoleikha, Sayyahi; Mirzaei, Ramazan; Roksana, Mirkazemi\n\n2017-01-02\n\nThe objective of this study was to assess the level of exposure to BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) in petrol pump stations in Ahvaz City. Two of the biggest fuelling stations were selected randomly among total 12 fuel stations of Ahvaz City, Iran, during September 2013. Thirty air samples were taken from different positions in the fuelling stations and 15 samples were taken from the personal breathing zone of operators and of customers in fuelling stations. Measuring the ambient concentration of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes was done according to the method advised by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 1501. This study showed that the concentration of benzene was very high (compared with the Iranian occupational exposure limit [OEL] standard) in ambient air of petrol stations in Ahvaz, which is considered as a high risk to the health of workers. Controlling the level of benzene in petrol stations is necessary. A new designed petrol nozzle was proposed for this purpose.\n\nGenotoxic Effects of Exposure to Gasoline Fumes on Petrol Pump Workers.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaikh, Amrin; Barot, Darshana; Chandel, Divya\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPetrol pump workers are occupationally exposed to gasoline and its fumes consisting of several mutagenic chemicals. To evaluate the genotoxic effects of exposure to gasoline fumes on petrol pump workers. The study groups included 70 petrol pump workers (exposed group) and 70 healthy age-matched individuals with no known exposure (comparison group). Buccal micronucleus cytome assay (BMCyt) was performed to check the genotoxicity caused due to inhalation of gasoline fumes. The frequencies of micronucleated cells, nuclear bud, condensed chromatin cells, karyorrhectic cells, pyknotic cells, and karyolytic cells were significantly higher in the exposed workers compared to the comparison group. Exposure to gasoline fumes is associated with increased frequency of cell abnormalities. This may lead to various health consequences including cancer in those occupationally exposed to gasoline fumes.\n\nA comparison of exhaust emissions from vehicles fuelled with petrol, LPG and CNG\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBielaczyc, P.; Szczotka, A.; Woodburn, J.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThis paper presents an analysis of THC, NMHC, CO, NOx and CO2 emissions during testing of two bi-fuel vehicles, fuelled with petrol and gaseous fuels, on a chassis dynamometer in the context of the Euro 6 emissions requirements. The analyses were performed on one Euro 5 bi-fuel vehicle (petrol/LPG) and one Euro 5 bi-fuel vehicle (petrol/CNG), both with SI engines equipped with MPI feeding systems operating in closed-loop control, typical three-way-catalysts and heated oxygen sensors. The vehicles had been adapted by their manufacturers for fuelling with LPG or CNG by using additional special equipment mounted onto the existing petrol fuelling system. The vehicles tested featured multipoint gas injection systems. The aim of this paper was an analysis of the impact of the gaseous fuels on the exhaust emission in comparison to the emission of the vehicles fuelled with petrol. The tests subject to the analyses presented here were performed in the Engine Research Department of BOSMAL Automotive Research and Development Institute Ltd in Bielsko-Biala, Poland, within a research programme investigating the influence of alternative fuels on exhaust emissions from light duty vehicle vehicles with spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines.\n\nQuantification of atmospheric lead emissions from 70 years of leaded petrol consumption in Australia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKristensen, Louise Jane\n\n2015-06-01\n\nLead is a persistent pollutant and the subject of many environmental studies, yet, in Australia, the extent of atmospheric lead emissions from the use of leaded petrol is unquantified. This paper details the first comprehensive account of leaded petrol sales and its lead concentrations over the 70 years of use in Australia. The resulting atmospheric lead emissions are calculated to provide the most complete understanding of the volume of lead released to the Australian continent from the consumption of leaded petrol. Atmospheric emissions of lead to the entire Australian continent from leaded petrol are calculated to total 240,510 tonnes over seven decades of use, peaking at 7869 tonnes in 1974. Total emissions for individual states and territories range from 1745 to 67,893 tonnes, with New South Wales responsible for the largest emissions. The effect of regulations on allowable concentrations of tetraethyl-lead additives are observed in the reduction of lead emissions in New South Wales and Victoria. The consequences to human health and the environment of leaded petrol consumption in Australia's populous cities are examined against historical air quality data and blood lead levels.\n\nA Temporal Association between Accumulated Petrol (Gasoline) Lead Emissions and Motor Neuron Disease in Australia.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaidlaw, Mark A S; Rowe, Dominic B; Ball, Andrew S; Mielke, Howard W\n\n2015-12-19\n\nThe age standardised death rate from motor neuron disease (MND) has increased from 1.29 to 2.74 per 100,000, an increase of 112.4% between 1959 and 2013. It is clear that genetics could not have played a causal role in the increased rate of MND deaths over such a short time span. We postulate that environmental factors are responsible for this rate increase. We focus on lead additives in Australian petrol as a possible contributing environmental factor. The associations between historical petrol lead emissions and MND death trends in Australia between 1962 and 2013 were examined using linear regressions. Regression results indicate best fit correlations between a 20 year lag of petrol lead emissions and age-standardised female death rate (RÂ² = 0.86, p = 4.88 Ã 10(-23)), male age standardised death rate (RÂ² = 0.86, p = 9.4 Ã 10(-23)) and percent all cause death attributed to MND (RÂ² = 0.98, p = 2.6 Ã 10(-44)). Legacy petrol lead emissions are associated with increased MND death trends in Australia. Further examination of the 20 year lag between exposure to petrol lead and the onset of MND is warranted.\n\nEffects of Petrol Exposure on Glucose, Liver and Muscle glycogen levels in the Common African toad Bufo regularis.\n\nPubMed\n\nIsehunwa, G O; Yusuf, I O; Alada, A Ar\n\n2017-03-06\n\nThis study investigated the effects of exposure to petrol on blood glucose, liver and muscle glycogen levels in the common African toad Bufo regularis. A total of 126 adult toads of either sex weighing between 70-100g were used for this study. The experiment was divided into three phases. The phase 1 experiment the acute toxicity test consisted of animals divided into six groups of 10 toads per group and were exposed to water (H2O), H2O + Tween 80, 2ml/l, 3ml/l, 5ml/l, and 10ml/l of petrol respectively for 96 hours using the static renewal bioassay system. In the Phase 2 experiment, the animals were exposed to H2O, H2O + Tween 80, 0.14ml/l, 0.3ml/l, 0.6ml/l, and 1.13ml/l of petrol respectively for 3 days; while in phase 3 experiment they were exposed to petrol solutions for 14 days. After the various exposures, the blood glucose, liver and muscle glycogen contents were determined using standard methods. The results of the study showed that the median lethal concentration of petrol (96 hours LC50) was 4.5ml/l and sub-lethal concentration of petrol caused mortality of animals. Exposure to petrol solutions for 3 days had no significant effect on blood glucose level of the animals but caused significant decrease in the liver and muscle glycogen levels at high concentrations. In the animals exposed to petrol solutions for 14 days, there was a significant increase in glucose levels and significant reduction in liver and muscle glycogen levels at high concentrations when compared with the control. The results show that sub-lethal concentrations of petrol can cause mortality of animals, hyperglycemia and reduction in liver and muscle glycogen levels. The effects of petrol exposure on carbohydrate metabolism depend on the concentration and duration of exposure.\n\nPetrol and diesel exhaust particles accelerate the horizontal transfer of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance genes.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Ye; Gu, April Z; Cen, Tianyu; Li, Xiangyang; Li, Dan; Chen, Jianmin\n\n2018-05-01\n\nParticles exhausted from petrol and diesel consumptions are major components of urban air pollution that can be exposed to human via direct inhalation or other routes due to atmospheric deposition into water and soil. Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious threats to modern health care. However, how the petrol and diesel exhaust particles affect the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in various environments remain largely unknown. This study investigated the effects and potential mechanisms of four representative petrol and diesel exhaust particles, namely 97 octane petrol, 93 octane petrol, light diesel oil, and marine heavy diesel oil, on the horizontal transfer of ARGs between two opportunistic Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains, E. coli S17-1 (donor) and E. coli K12 (recipient). The results demonstrated that these four representative types of nano-scale particles induced concentration-dependent increases in conjugative transfer rates compared with the controls. The underlying mechanisms involved in the accelerated transfer of ARGs were also identified, including the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the consequent induction of oxidative stress, SOS response, changes in cell morphology, and the altered mRNA expression of membrane protein genes and those involved in the promotion of conjugative transfer. The findings provide new evidences and mechanistic insights into the antimicrobial resistance risks posed by petrol and diesel exhaust particles, and highlight the implications and need for stringent strategies on alternative fuels to mitigate air pollution and health risks.

LAF is used in place of unleaded petrol as a fuel for vehicles and other engines. This paper reports findings from an independent evaluation of the LAF rollout. Forty one Indigenous communities were surveyed between 2010 and 2014, with each community being visited twice at a two yearly interval. Quantitative data on prevalence of petrol sniffing were collected, as well as qualitative data on the acceptability of LAF, evidence of substitution for inhaled petrol with other drugs, and programs such as recreational, training and employment opportunities. Prevalence rates of sniffing per 1000 population for each survey year and community were calculated by dividing the total number of sniffers by the population aged 5-39Â years and multiplying by 1000. Between 2011-12 and 2013-14, the total estimated number of people sniffing petrol declined from 289 to 204, a fall of 29.4%. At both times, the median petrol sniffing prevalence rate was lower in communities with LAF than in communities without LAF. In 17 of the 41 communities, comparable data were available over a longer period, commencing in 2005-06. Fifteen of these communities stocked LAF over the entire period. In these communities, the median rate of petrol sniffing declined by 96%, from 141.6 per 1000 population in 2005-06 to 5.5 in 2013-14 (pâ<â0.05). LAF was widely accepted, although acceptance was often qualified by a belief that LAF harmed engines. Anecdotal reports suggest that the fall in petrol sniffing may have been offset by increased use of cannabis and other drugs, but the relationship is not one of simple cause-and-effect, with evidence that an increase in cannabis use in communities commenced before the LAF rollout began. Provision of services in communities has improved in recent years, but many programs\n\nThe ignitability of petrol vapours and potential for vapour phase explosion by use of TASERÂ® law enforcement electronic control device.\n\nPubMed\n\nClarke, C; Andrews, S P\n\n2014-12-01\n\nAn experimental study was made of the potential of the TASER-X26â¢ law enforcement electronic control device to ignite petrol vapours if used by an officer to incapacitate a person soaked in petrol, or within a flammable atmosphere containing petrol vapour. Bench scale tests have shown that a wooden mannequin with pig skin covering the chest was a suitable representation of a human target. Full scale tests using the mannequin have shown that the arc from a TASER-X26â¢ is capable of igniting petrol/air vapours on a petrol-soaked person. Further tests in a 1/5 scale and a full scale compartment have shown that if a TASER is used within a compartment, a petrol vapour explosion (deflagration) may be achieved. It is evident from this research that if used in a flammable vapour rich environment, the device could prove fatal not only to the target but the TASERÂ® operator as well.

Surfactants producing by plant growth promotory rhizobacteria (PGPR) can effectively rig the problem of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination and growth promotion on such contaminated soils. In the present study three Pseudomonas strains isolated from contaminated soil identified by 16S rRNA analysis were ascertained for PGPR as well as biosurfactants property. Biosurfactants produced by the strains were further characterized and essayed for rhamnolipids. Inoculation of the strains in petrol hydrocarbon contaminated soil and its interaction with Withania somnifera in presence of petrol oil hydrocarbons depict that the strains helped in growth promotion of Withania somnifera in petrol oil contaminated soil while rhamnolipids helped in lowering the toxicity of petrol oil. The study was found to be beneficial as the growth and antioxidant activity of Withania sominfera was enhanced. Hence the present study signifies that rhamnolipids producing PGPR strains could be a better measure for reclamation of petrol contaminated sites for growing medicinal plants.\n\nDetection of adulteration in diesel and petrol by kerosene using SPR based fiber optic technique\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVerma, Rajneesh K.; Suwalka, Payal; Yadav, Jatin\n\n2018-07-01\n\nIn this paper we focused on the experimental investigations for fabricating a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based fiber optic sensor for the detection of the extent of adulteration in petrochemicals: petrol and diesel by kerosene. Primarily it is observed that the refractive index of the petrol and diesel changes if we mix kerosene in it. The variation in refractive index is linear in nature. Utilizing the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance in Krestchmann configuration on optical fiber, the percentage of adulteration in petrol and diesel is detected. The detection level of adulteration is quantified systematically for both the petrol and diesel. The study carried out here explores the possibility of utilizing SPR technique for the detection of the level of adulteration in petrochemicals. The suitability of the optical fiber for remote sensing and its immunity towards electromagnetic interaction makes this probe very useful for such endeavor. High sensitivity, easy construction and its portability, makes this study important in the development of SPR based optical fiber sensors for petrochemical industries. Apart from this various aspects of environment polluting hazardous/toxic gases as an emission product of automobile fuels has also been discussed.\n\nPetrol--something nasty in the woodshed? A review of gasoline-related burns in a British burns unit.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, D I; Bailie, F B\n\n1995-11-01\n\nPetrol (gasoline) is probably the fuel most easily available and widely in use today. Indeed, most households have a can lurking in the garden shed or basement for domestic use. It's chemical properties make it a highly explosive as well as a combustible fluid, a fact that is sometimes poorly appreciated. We looked at the incidence of petrol-related burns seen in our unit over a 2-year period. Nearly 33 per cent of the adult male admissions were petrol-related and 16 per cent were in children under the age of 16 years. The commonest cause of injury was attempting to start or accelerate a bonfire (38 per cent) with only a small number of barbecue injuries (4 per cent). Petrol causes a significant number of burn injuries a year, and particularly worrying were the number of children injured. However, we feel there is a need for greater public education and perhaps stricter control of this substance.\n\nLead reduction of petrol and blood lead concentrations of athletes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMaresky, L.S.; Kotze, T.J.V.W.; Grobler, S.R.\n\nIn 1984, it was determined that the blood of long-distance runners in South Africa contained unacceptably high concentrations of lead. Subsequently, the petrol lead level in South Africa was reduced from 0.8 g/l to 0.4 g/l. In view of this reduction, a follow-up investigation of its effect on the blood lead concentration of South African runners was undertaken. Blood lead samples were analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The mean values of blood lead concentrations dropped from 52 to 13 {mu}g/dl and from 20 to 8.5 {mu}g/dl for the urban and rural trainers, respectively. A highly significant decrease inmoreÂ Â» blood lead levels was found and was mainly attributable to the reduction in the petrol lead levels. The blood lead results for rural trainers indicated that there still exists a certain degree of lead pollution in athletes from nonremote areas.Â«Â less\n\nUrban traffic pollution reduction for sedan cars using petrol engines by hydro-oxide gas inclusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Rousan, Ammar A; Alkheder, Sharaf; Musmar, Sa'ed A\n\n2015-12-01\n\nPetrol cars, in particular nonhybrid cars, contribute significantly to the pollution problem as compared with other types of cars. The originality of this article falls in the direction of using hydro-oxy gas to reduce pollution from petrol car engines. Experiments were performed in city areas at low real speeds, with constant engine speeds in the average of 2500 rpm and at variable velocity ratios (first speed was 10-20 km/hr, second speed was 20-35 km/hr, and third speed was 35-50 km/hr). Results indicated that through using hydro-oxy gas, a noticeable reduction in pollution was recorded. Oxygen (O2) percentage has increased by about 2.5%, and nitric oxide (NO) level has been reduced by about 500 ppm. Carbon monoxide (CO) has decreased by about 2.2%, and also CO2 has decreased by 2.1%. It's worth mentioning that for hybrid system in cars at speeds between 10 and 50 km/hr, the emission percentage change is zero. However, hybrid cars are less abundant than petrol cars. The originality of this paper falls in the direction of using hydro-oxy gas to reduce pollution from petrol car engines. Experiments were performed in city areas at low real speeds, with constant engine speeds in the average of 2500 rpm and at variable velocity ratios (first speed was 10-20 km/hr, second speed was 20-35 km/hr, and third speed was 35-50 km/h).\n\nEarly Liver and Kidney Dysfunction Associated with Occupational Exposure to Sub-Threshold Limit Value Levels of Benzene, Toluene, and Xylenes in Unleaded Petrol\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNeghab, Masoud; Hosseinzadeh, Kiamars; Hassanzadeh, Jafar\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Unleaded petrol contains significant amounts of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX). Toxic responses following occupational exposure to unleaded petrol have been evaluated only in limited studies. The main purpose of this study was to ascertain whether (or not) exposure to unleaded petrol, under normal working conditions, is associated with any hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic response. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which 200 employees of Shiraz petrol stations with current exposure to unleaded petrol, as well as 200 unexposed employees, were investigated. Atmospheric concentrations of BTX were measured using standard methods. Additionally, urine and fasting blood samples were taken from individuals for urinalysis and routine biochemical tests of kidney and liver function. Results The geometric means of airborne concentrations of BTX were found to be 0.8Â mgÂ mâ3, 1.4Â mgÂ mâ3, and 2.8Â mgÂ mâ3, respectively. Additionally, means of direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea and plasma creatinine were significantly higher in exposed individuals than in unexposed employees. Conversely, serum albumin, total protein, and serum concentrations of calcium and sodium were significantly lower in petrol station workers than in their unexposed counterparts. Conclusion The average exposure of petrol station workers to BTX did not exceed the current threshold limit values (TLVs) for these chemicals. However, evidence of subtle, subclinical and prepathologic early liver and kidney dysfunction was evident in exposed individuals.

Nationally, age-specific MND death rates also increased over this time period, but the rate of the rise varied considerably by age-group. The historic use of lead (Pb) additives in Australian petrol is a candidate explanation for these trends in MND mortality (International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 G12.2). Leveraging temporal and spatial variation in petrol lead exposure risk resulting from the slow rise and rapid phase-out of lead as a constituent in gasoline in Australia, we analyze relationships between (1) national age-specific MND death rates in Australia and age-specific lifetime petrol lead exposure, (2) annual between-age dispersions in age-specific MND death rates and age-specific lifetime petrol lead exposure; and (3) state-level age-standardized MND death rates as a function of age-weighted lifetime petrol lead exposure. Other things held equal, we find that a one percent increase in lifetime petrol lead exposure increases the MND death rate by about one-third of one percent in both national age-specific and state-level age-standardized models of MND mortality. Lending support to the supposition that lead exposure is a driver of MND mortality risk, we find that the annual between-age group standard deviation in age-specific MND death rates is strongly correlated with the between-age standard deviation in age-specific lifetime petrol lead exposure. Legacy petrol lead emissions are associated with age-specific MND death rates as well as state-level age-standardized MND death rates in Australia. Results indicate that we are approaching peak lead exposure-attributable MND mortality. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

M.; Ibanga, I. A.; Okon, B. O.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA population-based-cross-sectional survey was carried out to investigate the potential risk of exposure to premium motor spirit (PMS) fumes in Calabar, Nigeria, among Automobile Mechanics (AM), Petrol Station Attendants (PSA) and the general population. Structured questionnaire was administered on the randomly chosen subjects to elicit information on their exposure to PMS. Duration of exposure was taken as the length of work in their various occupations. Venous blood was taken for methaemoglobin (MetHb) and packed cells volume (PCV). Mean MetHb value was higher in AM (7.3%) and PSA (5.8%) than in the subjects from the general population (2.7%). PCV was lower in PSA (30.8%), than AM (33.3%) and the subjects from the general population (40.8%). MetHb level was directly proportional, and PCV inversely related, to the duration of exposure. The study suggested increased exposure to petrol fumes among AM, PSA, and MetHb as a useful biomarker in determining the level of exposure to benzene in petrol vapour.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the spatial distribution of various VOCs when leaked into the atmosphere in the area of a petrol station. The study is based on numerical simulations. The effect of wind speed and direction, as well as of air temperature has been studied. Gasoline components of different properties have been studied (e.g. pentane, iso-octane, o-xylene, toluene, benzene), as well as ethanol that is considered a new fuel blend component that can be found in different fractions in new gasoline blends worldwide. The area of flammable cloud near the source of the leak is investigated for various atmospheric conditions taking into account the lower and higher flammable limits of each compound. Lastly, the exposure to gasoline vapour is studied taking into consideration the recommended occupational exposure limits of various organisations. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A.\n\n2005-11-01\n\nBenefits of laser ignition over the electrical ignition system for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) engines have fuelled automobile industry and led to an extensive research on basic characteristics to switch over to the emerging technologies. This study was undertaken to determine the electrical and physical characteristics of the electric spark ignition of single cylinder petrol/CNG engine to determine minimum ignition requirements and timeline of ignition events to use in subsequent laser ignition study. This communication briefly reviews the ongoing research activities and reports the results of this experimental study. The premixed petrol and CNG mixtures were tested for variation of current and voltage characteristics of the spark with speed of engine. The current magnitude of discharge circuit was found to vary linearly over a wide range of speed but the stroke to stroke fire time was found to vary nonlinearly. The DC voltage profiles were observed to fluctuate randomly during ignition process and staying constant in rest of the combustion cycle. Fire to fire peaks of current amplitudes fluctuated up to 10% of the peak values at constant speed but increased almost linearly with increase in speed. Technical barriers of laser ignition related to threshold minimum ignition energy, inter-pulse durations and firing sequence are discussed. Present findings provide a basic initiative and background information for designing suitable timeline algorithms for laser ignited leaner direct injected CNG engines.\n\nChildhood leukemia and traffic air pollution in Taiwan: petrol station density as an indicator.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeng, Hsu-Huei; Tsai, Shang-Shyue; Chiu, Hui-Fen; Wu, Trong-Neng; Yang, Chun-Yuh\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTo investigate the relationship between traffic air pollution exposure and development of childhood leukemia (14 yr of age or younger), a matched case-control study was conducted using childhood deaths that occurred in Taiwan from 1996 through 2006. Data on all eligible childhood leukemia deaths were obtained from the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health. The control group consisted of children who died from causes other than neoplasms or diseases that were not associated with respiratory complications. The controls were pair matched to the cancer cases by gender, year of birth, and year of death. Each matched control was selected randomly from the set of possible controls for each case. Data on the number of petrol stations in study municipalities were collected from the two major petroleum supply companies, Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPCC). The petrol station density (per square kilometer) (PSD) for study municipalities was used as an indicator of a subject's exposure to benzene and other hydrocarbons present in evaporative losses of petrol or to air emissions from motor vehicles. The subjects were divided into tertiles according to PSD in their residential municipality. The results showed that there was a significant exposure-response relationship between PSD and the risk of leukemia development in young children after controlling for possible confounders. The findings of this study warrant further investigation of the role of traffic air pollution exposure in the etiology of childhood leukemia.\n\nAn update of the Pb isotope inventory in post leaded-petrol Singapore environments.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarrasco, Gonzalo; Chen, Mengli; Boyle, Edward A; Tanzil, Jani; Zhou, Kuanbo; Goodkin, Nathalie F\n\n2018-02-01\n\nPb is a trace metal that tracks anthropogenic pollution in natural environments. Despite recent leaded petrol phase out around Southeast Asia, the region's growth has resulted in continued exposure of Pb from a variety of sources. In this study, sources of Pb into Singapore, a highly urbanised city-state situated in the central axis of Southeast Asia, are investigated using isotopic ratios and concentrations. We compiled data from our previous analyses of aerosols, incineration fly ash and sediments, with new data from analyses of soil from gas stations, water from runoff and round-island coastal seawater to obtain a spatio-temporal overview of sources of Pb into the Singapore environment. Using 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratio, we identified three main Pb source origins: natural Pb (1.215Â Â±Â 0.001), historic/remnant leaded petrol (1.123Â Â±Â 0.013), and present-day industrial and incinerated waste (1.148Â Â±Â 0.005). Deep reservoir sediments bore larger traces of Pb from leaded petrol, but present-day runoff waters and coastal seawater were a mix of industrial and natural sources with somewhat variable concentrations. We found temporal variability in Pb isotopic ratio in aerosols indicating alternating transboundary Pb sources to Singapore that correspond to seasonal changes in monsoon winds. By contrast, seasonal monsoon circulation did not significantly influence isotopic ratios of coastal seawater Pb. Instead, seawater Pb was driven more by location differences, suggesting stronger local-scale drivers of Pb such as point sources, water flushing, and isotope exchange. The combination of multiple historic and current sources of Pb shown in this study highlights the need for continued monitoring of Pb in Southeast Asia, especially in light of emerging industries and potential large sources of Pb such as coal combustion.

In this study, 97 petrol station attendants (PSAs) in southern China were recruited for an assessment of the health risk associated with inhalation exposure to MTBE. The personal exposure levels of MTBE were analyzed by Head Space Solid Phase Microextraction GC/MS, and the demographic characteristics of the PSAs were investigated. Cancer and non-cancer risks were calculated with the methods recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The results showed that the exposure levels of MTBE in operating workers were much higher than among support staff (p < 0.01) and both were lower than 50 ppm (an occupational threshold limit value). The calculated cancer risks (CRs) at the investigated petrol stations was 0.170 to 0.240 per 106 for operating workers, and 0.026 to 0.049 per 106 for support staff, which are below the typical target range for risk management of 1 Ã 10â6 to 1 Ã 10â4; The hazard quotients (HQs) for all subjects were <1. In conclusion, our study indicates that the MTBE exposure of PSAs in southern China is in a low range which does not seem to be a significant health risk.

As such, there have been many concerns about the impact of exposure to diesel fuels on health. This study was conducted in Taiwan to investigate the relationship between the concentration of manganese in cord blood of Taiwanese newborns and the geographic density of petrol stations as a surrogate for determining manganese emissions from vehicular traffic. A total of 1526 full-term newborns without major congenital malformations were consecutively recruited from various medical facilities from May 2004 to July 2005. Questionnaires were completed by the newborns' mothers after delivery to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, living environment, and other factors. Cord blood samples were collected at birth and analyzed for manganese and lead using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The geographic density of petrol stations within a 10 km zone around each newborn's residence was calculated for 1343 newborns using the Arc9 Geographic Information System. The geometric means of cord blood manganese and lead concentrations were 47.0 Î¼g/L (GSD=1.42) and 12.6 Î¼g/L (GSD=1.76), respectively. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, including maternal age, and maternal education, the results of a multiple linear regression model indicated that the concentration of cord blood manganese increased monotonically with an increasing density of petrol stations. However, no such association was found for levels of lead in cord blood. Further smoothing spline model analysis indicated that a ten unit increment in petrol station density made cord blood manganese and lead levels change by factors of 1.0092 (95% CI: 1.0058, 1.0127) and 0.9994 (95% CI: 0.9890, 0.9998), respectively. This finding suggests that exposure to manganese-containing fuel from motor vehicles may result in elevated\n\nPetrol filling workers as biomonitor of PAH exposure and functional health capacity in resource-limited settings of city Rawalpindi, Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nRashid, Audil; Tao, Shu; Uddin, Ikhtiar; Kamal, Atif\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThis is the first study from Pakistan to report the exposure of petrol filling workers (nÂ =Â 120) to naphthalene (Nap) and pyrene (Pyr) in relation to their functional capacities and health outcome. A group of non-exposed subjects (controls nÂ =Â 46) was also recruited for comparison. The perceived health risk of the exposed workers was monitored using a questionnaire based on the self-reporting survey. The observed physical anomalies related to the health disorder included the acidity after meals, eye redness, appetite loss, skin lesions, and dryness of oral cavity, while those related to neurasthenic symptoms included the body aches, energy loss, twitching, fatigue, sleeplessness, fainting, and irritability. Mean Nap level observed in the exposed group (106Â Î¼gÂ L -1 ) was significantly correlated (rÂ =Â 0.49; pÂ <Â 0.01) with cigarette smoking, while the average Pyr concentration (19.18Â Î¼gÂ L -1 ) was associated with job duration. Workers exposed for 6Â h per day or more had significantly high prevalence of physical disorders (ORÂ =Â 2.79, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.28-6.09). Neurasthenic symptoms were found in 65% of the subjects and were associated with years of involvement in job. Ten years or more work duration at petrol pumps could be associated with a substantial development of neurasthenic effects (ORÂ =Â 2.80, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.23-6.34). In conclusion, the subjects ascribed the disturbances in physical and neurological behavior to their occupation (petrol filling) and also rated their overall health and functional capacity as poor. To promote health of petrol pump workers, reduction in work hours and provision of masks and gloves could be introduced as occupational health interventions.\n\nImpact of organic solvents and environmental pollutants on the physiological function in petrol filling workers.\n\nPubMed\n\nUzma, Nazia; Salar, B M Khaja Mohinuddin; Kumar, B Santhosh; Aziz, Nusrat; David, M Anthony; Reddy, V Devender\n\n2008-09-01\n\nLong term exposure to solvents and air pollutants can lead to deleterious effects on respiratory, haematological and thyroid functioning. The aim of this study was to investigate whether chronic exposure to solvents like benzene and pollutants like carbon monoxide in petrol filling workers had adverse effect on blood parameters, thyroid and respiratory functions. The study group consisted of 42 healthy, non-smoker petrol filling workers, aged 20-50 years with work (exposure) duration from 2-15 years while 36 healthy subjects of the same age group served as controls. Physical examination and measurement of pulmonary functions by portable electronic spirometer were performed. Complete blood pictures (CBP) were determined by normal haematology lab procedure and hormones by Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) light absorption techniques. There was a significant decrease in the lung volumes and capacities; the restrictive pattern was more prevalent in the workers when compared with the control groups. But in the workers exposed for long period (more than 10 years) the restrictive pattern was changed to mixed pattern. A significant increase in haemoglobin (Hb) (>16 mg %) and red blood cells (RBC) (5.4 million cells/mm3) were observed in workers with longer period of exposure when compared with the control subjects (14.483 mg% and 4.83 million cells/mm3 for Hb and RBC respectively). White blood cell count except eosinophils and platelets were significantly lower in workers compared to controls. Marked increase in the tetra iodothyroinine (T4), free thyroxine (T4F) level and significant decrease in thyroid stimulating hormones (TSH), and tri-iodothyronine (T3) were observed between long term exposed and non-exposed groups. Till now researchers focused only on the effect of solvents in workers professionally exposed to solvents without considering the effect of concomittant air pollution. The result obtained from present study indicates that there is a significant toxic\n\nExposure to BTEX and Ethers in Petrol Station Attendants and Proposal of Biological Exposure Equivalents for Urinary Benzene and MTBE.\n\nPubMed\n\nCampo, Laura; Rossella, Federica; Mercadante, Rosa; Fustinoni, Silvia\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTo assess exposure to benzene (BEN) and other aromatic compounds (toluene, ethylbenzene, m+p-xylene, o-xylene) (BTEX), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) in petrol station workers using air sampling and biological monitoring and to propose biological equivalents to occupational limit values. Eighty-nine petrol station workers and 90 control subjects were investigated. Personal exposure to airborne BTEX and ethers was assessed during a mid-week shift; urine samples were collected at the beginning of the work week, prior to and at the end of air sampling. Petrol station workers had median airborne exposures to benzene and MTBE of 59 and 408 Âµg m(-3), respectively, with urinary benzene (BEN-U) and MTBE (MTBE-U) of 339 and 780 ng l(-1), respectively. Concentrations in petrol station workers were higher than in control subjects. There were significant positive correlations between airborne exposure and the corresponding biological marker, with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.437 and 0.865 for benzene and MTBE, respectively. There was also a strong correlation between airborne benzene and urinary MTBE (r = 0.835). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the urinary levels of benzene were influenced by personal airborne exposure, urinary creatinine, and tobacco smoking [determination coefficient (R(2)) 0.572], while MTBE-U was influenced only by personal exposure (R(2) = 0.741). BEN-U and MTBE-U are sensitive and specific biomarkers of low occupational exposures. We propose using BEN-U as biomarker of exposure to benzene in nonsmokers and suggest 1457 ng l(-1) in end shift urine samples as biological exposure equivalent to the EU occupational limit value of 1 p.p.m.; for both smokers and nonsmokers, MTBE-U may be proposed as a surrogate biomarker of benzene exposure, with a biological exposure equivalent of 22 Âµg l(-1) in end shift samples. For MTBE exposure, we suggest the use of MTBE-U with a biological exposure\n\nTraffic air pollution and risk of death from bladder cancer in Taiwan using petrol station density as a pollutant indicator.\n\nPubMed\n\nHo, Chi-Kung; Peng, Chiung-Yu; Yang, Chun-Yuh\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTo investigate the relationship between air pollution and risk of death from bladder cancer, a matched cancer case-control study was conducted using deaths that occurred in Taiwan from 1997 through 2006. Data for all eligible bladder cancer deaths were obtained from the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health. The control group consisted of individuals who died from causes other than cancer or diseases associated with genitourinary problems. The controls were pair matched to the cases by gender, year of birth, and year of death. Each matched control was selected randomly from the set of possible controls for each case. Data for the number of petrol stations in study municipalities were collected from the two major petroleum supply companies, Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPCC). The petrol station density (per square kilometer) (PSD) for study municipalities was used as an indicator of a subject's exposure to benzene and other hydrocarbons present in ambient evaporative losses of petrol or to air emissions from motor vehicles. The subjects were divided into tertiles according to PSD in their residential municipality. The present study showed that individuals who resided in municipalities with high PSD levels were at an increased risk of death from bladder cancer compared to subjects living in municipalities with a low PSD level; however, the differences are not statistically significant. The findings of this study warrant further investigation of the role of vehicular air pollutant emissions in the etiology of bladder cancer development.\n\nMeasuring market share of petrol stations using conditional probability approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSharif, Shamshuritawati; Lwee, Xue Yin\n\n2017-05-01\n\nOil and gas production is the strength of Malaysia's growth over past decades. It is one of the most strategic economic branches in the world. Since the oil industry is essential for the economic growth of a country, only a few undertakings have been achieved to establish. It is a very risky business. Therefore the dealer must have some information in hand before setting up a new business plan. Understanding the current business situation is an important strategy to avoid risky ventures. In this study, the aim is to deliver a very simple but essential way to identify the market share based on customer's choice factors. This approach is presented to encourage the non-statisticians to use it easily in helping their business performance. From this study, the most important factors differ from one station to another station. The results show that the factors of customer's choice for BHPetrol, Caltex, PETRON, PETRONAS and SHELL are site location, service quality, service quality, size of the petrol station, and brand image, respectively.\n\nMeasurement of 238U and 232Th in Petrol, Gas-oil and Lubricant Samples by Using Nuclear Track Detectors and Resulting Radiation Doses to the Skin of Mechanic Workers.\n\nPubMed\n\nMisdaq, M A; Chaouqi, A; Ouguidi, J; Touti, R; Mortassim, A\n\n2015-10-01\n\nWorkers in repair shops of vehicles (cars, buses, truck, etc.) clean carburetors, check fuel distribution, and perform oil changes and greasing. To explore the exposure pathway of (238)U and (232)Th and its decay products to the skin of mechanic workers, these radionuclides were measured inside petrol, gas-oil, and lubricant material samples by means of CR-39 and LR-115 type II solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTDs), and corresponding annual committed equivalent doses to skin were determined. The maximum total equivalent effective dose to skin due to the (238)U and (232)Th series from the application of different petrol, gas-oil, and lubricant samples by mechanic workers was found equal to 1.2 mSv y(-1) cm(-2).\n\nKnock detection system to improve petrol engine performance, using microphone sensor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSujono, Agus; Santoso, Budi; Juwana, Wibawa Endra\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAn increase of power and efficiency of spark ignition engines (petrol engines) are always faced with the problem of knock. Even the characteristics of the engine itself are always determined from the occurrence of knock. Until today, this knocking problem has not been solved completely. Knock is caused by principal factors that are influenced by the engine rotation, the load or opening the throttle and spark advance (ignition timing). In this research, the engine is mounted on the engine test bed (ETB) which is equipped with the necessary sensors. Knock detection using a new method, which is based on pattern recognition, which through the knock sound detection by using a microphone sensor, active filter, the regression of the normalized envelope function, and the calculation of the Euclidean distance is used for identifying knock. This system is implemented with a microcontroller which uses fuzzy logic controller ignition (FLIC), which aims to set proper spark advance, in accordance with operating conditions. This system can improve the engine performance for approximately 15%.\n\nCost effectiveness of introducing a new European evaporative emissions test procedure for petrol vehicles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaq, Gary; Martini, Giorgio; Mellios, Giorgos\n\n2014-10-01\n\nEvaporative emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) arise from the vehicle's fuel system due to changes in ambient and vehicle temperatures, and contribute to urban smog. This paper presents an economic analysis of the societal costs and benefits of implementing a revised European evaporative emission test procedure for petrol vehicles under four scenarios for the period 2015-2040. The paper concludes that the most cost-effective option is the implementation of an aggressive purging strategy over 48 h and improved canister durability (scenario 2+). The average net benefit of implementing this scenario is â¬146,709,441 at a 6% discount rate. Per vehicle benefits range from â¬6-9 but when fuel savings benefits are added, total benefits range from â¬13-18. This is compared to average additional cost per vehicle of â¬9.\n\nBrain cancer associated with environmental lead exposure: evidence from implementation of a National Petrol-Lead Phase-Out Program (PLPOP) in Taiwan between 1979 and 2007.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Wei-Te; Lin, Yu-Jen; Liou, Saou-Hsing; Yang, Chun-Yuh; Cheng, Kuang-Fu; Tsai, Perng-Jy; Wu, Trong-Neng\n\n2012-04-01\n\nIn 1981, a Petrol-Lead Phase-Out Program (PLPOP) was launched in Taiwan for the abatement of environmental lead emissions. The present study was intended to examine whether the high Petrol-Lead Emission Areas (PLEA) would result in an increase in the incidence rate of brain cancer based on a national data bank. The national brain cancer incidence data was obtained from the Taiwan National Cancer Registry. Age standardized incidence rates were calculated based on the 2000 WHO world standard population, and gasoline consumption data was obtained from the Bureau of Energy. The differences in the trend tests for age-standardized incidence rates of brain cancer between high, median, low, and small PLEA were analyzed. A significant increase was found from small to high PLEA in age-standardized incidence rates of brain cancer. By taking six possible confounders into account, the age-standardized incidence rates for brain cancer were highly correlated with the median and high PLEA by reference to the small PLEA. After being adjusted for a number of relevant confounders, it could be concluded that high PLEA might result in an increase in the incidence rate of brain cancer resulting from high lead exposures.

To assess radiation doses due to radon short-lived progeny from the inhalation of exhaust fumes by mechanic workers, concentrations of these radionuclides were measured in petrol (gasoline) and gas-oil exhaust fumes by evaluating mean critical angles of etching of the CR-39 and LR-115 type II SSNTDs for alpha particles emitted by the radon and thoron decay series. Committed effective doses due to Â²Â¹â¸Po and Â²Â¹â´Po short-lived radon decay products from the inhalation of petrol and gas-oil exhaust fumes by workers were evaluated. A maximum value of 1.35 mSv yâ»Â¹ due to radon short-lived decay products from the inhalation of gas-oil exhaust fumes by mechanic workers was found, which is lower than the (3-10 mSv yâ»Â¹) dose limit interval for workers.\n\nSurvey on how fluctuating petrol prices are affecting Malaysian large city dwellers in changing their trip patterns\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRohani, M. M.; Pahazri, N.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nRising fuel prices shocks have a significant impact on the way of life of most Malaysians. Due to the rising of oil prices, the costs of travel for private vehicle users are therefore increasing. The study was conducted based on the objective of studying the impact of rising fuel prices on three types of trip patterns of Malaysians who are living in the city areas. The three types of trip patterns are, workplaces trip, leisure trip and personal purposes trip during the weekdays. This study was conducted by distributing questionnaires to respondents of private vehicle users in selected city such as Johor Bahru, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Melaka, Perak, Selangor and Kelantan. This study, found that the trip patterns of those who were using their own vehicles had changed after the rising of fuel prices. The changes showed that many private vehicle users were taking steps to save money on petrol by adjusting their trips.\n\nA case of acute gasoline intoxication at the scene of washing a petrol tank.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakamiya, Masataka; Niitsu, Hisae; Saigusa, Kiyoshi; Kanetake, Jun; Aoki, Yasuhiro\n\n2003-09-01\n\nWe encountered a case of acute gasoline intoxication at the scene of washing the inner wall of a petrol tank. The decedent was a 50-year-old male, who was the supervisor. Two young workers wearing mask respirators began to wash the inner wall of the gasoline tank under poor ventilation. About 1 h later, because one of the workers lost consciousness, the supervisor entered the tank, without a mask respirator, to rescue the worker. However, the supervisor immediately fainted, and died 26 h after the accident. In the autopsy, blisters were observed on the skin of the face, neck, anterior chest, upper extremities, and back. The heart contained hemolyzed blood. Histologically, hemorrhagic pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and proximal tubular necrosis were found. In the toxicological analyzes, toluene, xylene, and trimethylbenzene were detected in the blood, brain, and gastric contents. Toluene concentrations in the blood and brain were 0.3 mug/ml and 3.7 mug/g, respectively. Since pathological findings were consistent with the reported findings concerning gasoline intoxication, and constituents of gasoline were in the body, death was attributed to acute gasoline intoxication. It was considered that sufficient ventilation and proper use of a mask respirator were essential for this kind of work.\n\nWork-exposure to PM10 and aromatic volatile organic compounds, excretion of urinary biomarkers and effect on the pulmonary function and heme-metabolism: A study of petrol pump workers and traffic police personnel in Kolkata City, India.\n\nPubMed\n\nMukherjee, Ashit K; Chattopadhyay, Bhaskar P; Roy, Sanjit K; Das, Surojit; Mazumdar, Dipanjali; Roy, Moumita; Chakraborty, Rajarshi; Yadav, Anupa\n\n2016-01-28\n\nThis study focused work-exposure to particulate matter â¤ 10 Âµm (PM 10 ), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and biological monitoring of major VOCs (BTEX) to observe the significant effects of traffic related pollutants on respiratory and hematological systems of workers engaged in two occupational settings, petrol pumps and traffic areas of Kolkata metropolitan city, India. PM 10 was assessed by personal sampling and particle size distribution by 8-stage Cascade Impactor. VOCs were analysed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and five urinary metabolites, trans trans- mercapturic acid (tt-MA), S-phenyl mercapturic acid (SPMA), hippuric acid (HA), mandelic acid (MA) and methyl hippuric acid (MHA) of VOCs, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes (BTEX) by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pulmonary functions test (PFT) was measured Spirometrically. â-aminoleavulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) in lymphocytes were measured spectrophometrically following column chromatographic separation. High exposure to PM 10 , having 50% of particles, â¤ 5.0 Âµm in both the occupational settings. Exposure to toluene was highest in petrol pumps whereas benzene was highest (104.6 Â± 99.0 Î¼g m -3 ) for traffic police personnel. Workplace Benzene is found many fold higher than the National ambient standard. Air-benzene is correlated significantly with pre- and post-shift tt-MA (p < 0.001) and SPMA (p < 0.001) of exposed workers. Blood cell counts indicated benzene induced hematotoxicity. ALA and PBG accumulation in lymphocytes indicated alteration in heme-metabolism, especially among traffic police. Significant reduction of force exploratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) of fuel fillers are observed with increased tt-MA and SPMA. Study revealed PFT impairments 11.11% (6.66% restrictive and 2.22% obstructive and combined restrictive and obstructive type, each) among petrol pumps and 8\n\nDid the elimination of lead from petrol reduce crime in the USA in the 1990s?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHall, Wayne\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis article assesses the evidence for the hypothesis that a decline in all types of crime since the early 1990s in the USA was a consequence of removing lead from petrol between 1975 and 1985. It describes ecological and econometric studies that have generally but not always found correlations between lead exposures in childhood and some types of crime 20 years later; a small number of epidemiological studies that have found a dose-response relationship between lead exposure in childhood and self-reported and officially recorded criminal offences in young adulthood; and evidence for the biological plausibility of a causal relationship. Lead exposure in childhood may have played a small role in rising and falling crime rates in the USA but it is unlikely to account for the very high percentage of the decline suggested by the ecological studies. The major anomaly in the evidence is that the associations reported in ecological studies are much stronger (explaining 56-90% of the variation in crime rates) than the weaker relationships found in the cohort studies (that typically explain less than 1% of the variance in offending). Â Suggestions are made for research that will better assess the contribution that reduced lead exposure has made to declining crime rates in the USA.

Emission factors and their relative values between the two fuel types together with a statistical significance for any difference were estimated for each parameter. In general, LPG was found to be a 'cleaner' fuel, although in most cases, the differences were not statistically significant owing to the large variations between emissions from different vehicles. The particle number emission factors ranged from 10(11) to 10(13) km(-1) and was over 70% less with LPG compared to ULP. Corresponding differences in particle mass emission factor between the two fuels were small and ranged from the order of 10 microg km(-1) at 40 to about 1000 microg km(-1) at 100 km h(-1). The count median particle diameter (CMD) ranged from 20 to 35 nm and was larger with LPG than with ULP in all modes except the idle mode. Carbon dioxide emission factors ranged from about 300 to 400 g km(-1) at 40 km h(-1), falling with increasing speed to about 200 g km(-1) at 100 km h(-1). At all speeds, the values were 10% to 18% greater with ULP than with LPG.\n\nCharacterization of on-road CO, HC and NO emissions for petrol vehicle fleet in China city*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGuo, Hui; Zhang, Qing-yu; Shi, Yao; Wang, Da-hui; Ding, Shu-ying; Yan, Sha-sha\n\n2006-01-01\n\nVehicle emissions are a major source of air pollution in urban areas. The impact on urban air quality could be reduced if the trends of vehicle emissions are well understood. In the present study, the real-world emissions of vehicles were measured using a remote sensing system at five sites in Hangzhou, China from February 2004 to August 2005. More than 48000 valid gasoline powered vehicle emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxide (NO) were measured. The results show that petrol vehicle fleet in Hangzhou has considerably high CO emissions, with the average emission concentration of 2.71%Â±0.02%, while HC and NO emissions are relatively lower, with the average emission concentration of (153.72Â±1.16)Ã10â6 and (233.53Â±1.80)Ã10â6, respectively. Quintile analysis of both average emission concentration and total amount emissions by model year suggests that in-use emission differences between well maintained and badly maintained vehicles are larger than the age-dependent deterioration of emissions. In addition, relatively new high polluting vehicles are the greatest contributors to fleet emissions with, for example, 46.55% of carbon monoxide fleet emissions being produced by the top quintile high emitting vehicles from model years 2000~2004. Therefore, fleet emissions could be significantly reduced if new highly polluting vehicles were subject to effective emissions testing followed by appropriate remedial action.

Pramono\n\n2011-10-01\n\nWith the Oil and Gas Law No. 22 of 2001, national and foreign private enterprises can invest in all sectors of Oil and Gas in Indonesia. In anticipation of this free competition, Pertamina, as a state-owned enterprises, which previously had monopolized the oil and gas business activities in Indonesia, should be able to improve services as well as the efficiency in order to compete in the free market, especially in terms of cost efficiency of fuel distribution to gas station (SPBU). To optimize the distribution activity, it is necessary to design a scheduling system and its fuel delivery routes daily to every SPBU. The determination of routes and scheduling delivery of fuel to the SPBU can be modeled as a Petrol Station Replenishment Problem (PSRP) with the multi-depot, multi-product, time windows and split deliveries, which in this study will be completed by the Tabu Search algorithm (TS). This study was conducted in the area of Bandung, the capital of West Java province, which is a big city and the neighboring city of Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. By using the fuel delivery data for one day, the results showed a decrease of 16.38% of the distance of the route compared to the current conditions, which impacted on the reduction of distribution costs and decrease the number of total trips by 5.22% and 3.83%.\n\nInvestigation of gasoline distributions within petrol stations: spatial and seasonal concentrations, sources, mitigation measures, and occupationally exposed symptoms.\n\nPubMed\n\nSairat, Theerapong; Homwuttiwong, Sahalaph; Homwutthiwong, Kritsana; Ongwandee, Maneerat\n\n2015-09-01\n\nWe measured levels of VOCs and determined the distributions of benzene concentrations over the area of two petrol stations in all three seasons. Using the concentrations and sampling positions, we created isoconcentration contour maps. The average concentrations ranged 18-1288 Î¼g m(-3) for benzene and 12-81 Î¼g m(-3) for toluene. The contour maps indicate that high-level contours of benzene were found not only at the fuel dispenser areas but also at the storage tank refilling points, open drainage areas where gasoline-polluted wastewater was flowing, and the auto service center located within the station area. An assessment of the benzene to toluene ratio contour plots implicates that airborne benzene and toluene near the fuel dispenser area were attributed to gasoline evaporation although one of the studied stations may be influenced by other VOC sources besides gasoline evaporation. Additionally, during the routine refilling of the underground fuel storage tanks by a tank truck, the ambient levels of benzene and toluene increased tremendously. The implementation of source control by replacing old dispensers with new fuel dispensers that have an efficient cutoff feature and increased delivery speed can reduce spatial benzene concentrations by 77%. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey among 63 service attendants in ten stations revealed that headache was the most reported health complaint with a response rate of 32%, followed by fatigue with 20%. These prominent symptoms could be related to an exposure to high benzene concentrations.\n\nEnvironmental monitoring of adulterated gasoline with kerosene and their assessment at exhaust level.\n\nPubMed\n\nSinha, Sukesh Narayan; Shivgotra, V K\n\n2012-07-01\n\nFuel adulteration increases the emission of total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and respirable particulate matter, and thus adds to air pollution. The study examined the effects of mixing of different percentage of kerosene with petrol on the motorized rickshaw exhausts in terms of volatile organic compounds (benzene, toluene, xylene and ethyl benzene) and total suspended particulate matter (SPM). The personal sampler was used for sampling, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for quantification of compounds. Concentration of volatile organic compounds significantly decreased (p < 0.001) along with the increase in fraction of kerosene in petrol. The level of benzene in exhausts while, using petrol (100%) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of three combinations used in this study (75% petrol + 25% kerosene, 50% petrol + 50% kerosene and 25% petrol + 75% kerosene). Similar trend was observed for toluene, xylene and ethyl benzene also. The mean concentration of benzene, toluene, xylene and ethyl benzene were 31.34,160.93, 10.07 and 5.58 microg m(-3) in pure petrol, while 12.30, 51.41,4.89 and 3.16 microg m(-3) for fuel combination 75% petrol + 25% kerosene. The observed levels of benzene, toluene, xylene and ethyl benzene were 9.12, 41.04, 4.33 and 2.91 microg m(-3) for fuel mixture having 50% petrol with 50% kerosene and levels were 8.36, 20.05, 3.82 and 2.95 microg m(-3) were for 25% petrol with 75% kerosene fuel combination. The levels of suspended particulate matter (SPM) increased along with the increase in fraction of kerosene in petrol. The data generated is useful to understand the common volatile organic compounds trend with the increasing fraction of kerosene in petrol.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJacobsen, A. J.\n\nIn a method of the type where petrol is recovered from a mixture of petrol vapor and air by absorption of the petrol in a cooled petroleum distillate, a petroleum distillate having a boiling point range higher than that of the petrol is used, and this petroleum distillate is in sequence cooled by heat exchange with a cold reservoir, brought into direct contact with the petrol/air mixture to absorb petrol, transferred to a buffer tank and transferred from the buffer tank to a stripping means which may be a distillation column. By combining cooling condensation and absorption of the petrolmoreÂ Â» vapor and controlling the amount of cooled petroleum distillate brought into contact with the petrol/air mixture so that the petrol concentration in the petroleum distillate transferred to the buffer tank is substantially constant, an unprecedented optimum control of the petrol absorbing process can be obtained both in peak load and in average load operations. A system for carrying out the method is advantageous in that only the absorption means need be dimensioned for peak load operation, while the other components, such as the distillation column or a heat exchanger with associated conduits can be dimensioned for average loads, a buffer tank being provided to temporarily receive the petroleum distillate which owing to the above-mentioned control has a substantially constant, maximum petrol concentration so that the system can cope with peak loads with a surprisingly small buffer tank.Â«Â less\n\nInduction of microsomal drug metabolism in man and in the rat by exposure to petroleum.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHarman, A W; Frewin, D B; Priestly, B G\n\n1981-01-01\n\nTo determine the effect of petroleum exposure on the activity of hepatic mixed function oxidase enzymes, salivary elimination kinetics of antipyrine were determined in 19 petrol station attendants and compared with 19 controls. Antipyrine half life in petrol station attendants was shorter than in controls. Microsomal preparations (10 000 x g supernatants) were prepared from six male Porton rats exposed to petrol vapour (5 ppm at an air flow rate of 41/min for eight hours a day for three weeks) and six control rats maintained under the same conditions without exposure to petrol vapour. The rates of oxidative metabolism of antipyrine, aminopyrine, ethylmorphine, aniline, and benzo(a)pyrene were all increased by more than 45% in the petrol-exposed rats. The results indicate that petrol vapour is a moderately potent inducer of mixed function oxidase activity in rats, and that occupational exposure to petroleum may result in enhanced microsomal drug metabolism.

To describe three recent cases of severe haematological disease presumably induced by an occupational exposure to benzene. Exposure occurred as a result of contact with ordinary automobile petrol used as a solvent-degreaser for metal parts. Clinical diagnosis was performed using standard immuno-phenotypic and morphological criteria; the hypothesis of an occupational origin was derived from analysis of the occupational histories. The first case was a 59 year-old blacksmith suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) FAB M2, who had used petrol for 36 years to degrease the forged metal parts before painting them. The second was a 53 year-old mechanic with AML FAB M3 who had used petrol for 15 years to degrease mechanical parts of tanker motors. The third was an 82 year-old car mechanic suffering from idiopathic myelofibrosis since the age of 75, who had used petrol to degrease mechanical car motor parts for 42 years. In all three cases, the environmental hygiene measures necessary to limit inhalation or skin contact were not followed and, at times, in the case of the two mechanics, the petrol was siphoned by mouth; so there was substantial exposure to the 1-5% benzene present in the petrol. Latency of the disease was between 30-50 years from start of exposure, and between 3-17 years following cessation of exposure. The cases described indicate that the myelotoxic effects of benzene are still a problem. They were the consequence of improper use of petrol, due to total misinformation of the risks involved in such use. It is not possible to ascertain whether the cases presented are a casual aggregation or if the use of petrol as a solvent is more common than is normally believed; in the latter case two questions must be asked: is a \"normal\" occupational history able to discover such an uncommon\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWeeks, R.; Briggs, M.; Gyenes, L.\n\nA study carried out to assist the design of an infrastructure for refuelling battery electric cars is described.

H.; Ayoko, Godwin A.; Morawska, Lidia; Ristovski, Zoran D.; Jayaratne, E. Rohan; Kokot, Serge\n\nElements emitted from the exhausts of new Ford Falcon Forte cars powered by unleaded petrol (ULP) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were measured on a chassis dynamometer. The measurements were carried out in February, June and August 2001, and at two steady state driving conditions (60 and 80 km h -1). Thirty seven elements were quantified in the exhaust samples by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The total emission factors of the elements from the exhausts of ULP cars were higher than those of LPG cars at both engine speeds even though high variability in the exhaust emissions from different cars was noted. The effect of the operating conditions such as mileage of the cars, engine speed, fuel and lubricating oil compositions on the emissions was studied. To investigate the effects of these conditions, multivariate data analysis methods were employed including exploratory principal component analysis (PCA), and the multi-criteria decision making methods (MCDM), preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) and geometrical analysis for interactive aid (GAIA), for ranking the cars on the basis of the emission factors of the elements. PCA biplot of the complete data matrix showed a clear discrimination of the February, June and August emission test results. In addition, (i) platinum group elements (PGE) emissions were separated from each other in the three different clusters viz. Pt with February, Pd with June and Rh with August; (ii) the motor oil related elements, Zn and P, were particularly associated with the June and August tests (these vectors were also grouped with V, Al and Cu); and (iii) highest emissions of most major elements were associated with the August test after the cars have recorded their highest mileage. Extensive analysis with the aid of the MCDM ranking methods demonstrated clearly that cars powered by LPG outperform those powered by ULP.

Follow-up in the Swedish Cancer Register was carried out from 1971 to 1984. Among male petrol station attendants, 10 cases were observed versus 2.8 expected (observed/expected = 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.7--6.6). For several decades, Swedish petrol has contained 3--5% of benzene. Thus, a hypothesis was that benzene had contributed to the excess risk. The work histories of the 10 cases were reconstructed through interviews with surviving relatives and were compatible with the hypothesis. However, because the air benzenemoreÂ Â» exposures at petrol stations always have been lower than benzene exposures associated previously with an increased risk of AML, the leukemogenic effect of benzene may have been potentiated by other petrol or vehicle exhaust components. 23 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWood, R.A.; Downing, B.R.; Pearce, T.C.\n\nThe consumption of primary energy by diesel, petrol and electric versions of a light van was compared under high-density urban traffic conditions. The vehicles were driven repeatedly round a 10km route in Central London and measurements of fuel consumption, distance travelled and time were made for each route section. Multiple regression analysis established vehicle sensitivities to variations in average speed, payload, road type, regenerated energy (electric vehicle), kinetic energy, weather and driver. The diesel vehicle used primary energy more efficiently than either the petrol or the electric vehicle over the entire speed range observed, the ratio of energy consumption (diesel:petrol:electric)moreÂ Â» being 100:185:198 at the average speed during the experiment (17.58km/h). The petrol vehicle was more efficient than the electric over most of the speed range, but was less efficient at speeds below about 14km/h. It is concluded that the diesel vehicle is the most efficient for urban delivery duties.Â«Â less\n\nCharacterization of biosurfactants from indigenous soil bacteria recovered from oil contaminated sites.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumar, Govind; Kumar, Rajesh; Sharma, Anita\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThree bacterial isolates (G1, G2 and G3) characterized as Pseudomonas plecoglossicida, Lysinibacillus fusiformis and Bacillus safensis were recovered from contaminated soil of oil refinery. These bacterial isolates produced biosurfactants in MSM medium in stationary phase. Biosurfactants were characterized on the basis of their emulsifying properties with petrol, diesel, mobil oil and petrol engine oil. Reduction in surface tension (below 40 mN m(-1)) and blood hemolysis were also included in biosurfactants characterization. Emulsification indices of G1, G2 and G3 were in the range of 98.82, 23.53 and 58.82 for petrol; 29.411,1.05 and 70.588 for diesel; 35.31, 2.93 and 17.60 for mobil oil and 35.284, 58.82 and 17.647 for petrol engine oil respectively.

The urinary 8-oxodG levels in petrol filling station attendants (exposed) at various petrol bunks were estimated as well as in the unexposed (cashier) population. A total of 100 workers (79 petrol fillers and 21 cashiers) aged from 20 to 41 years participated in the study. An informed consent was taken from each participant. Information on personal habits and health was obtained through a questionnaire. After shifts, urine samples were collected analyzed for 8-oxodG using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fifty-three percent of workers were in the 21-30 years age group. The maximum level of 8-oxodG was observed in the age group â¥ 41 years and the minimum in the age group of 31-40 years. The maximum level of 8-oxodG was observed among those workers who had â¥ 21 years of experience.

Here, we show that car dealerships pose a significant barrier at the point of sale due to a perceived lack of business case viability in relation to petrol and diesel vehicles. In 126 shopping experiences at 82 car dealerships across Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, we find that dealers were dismissive of EVs, misinformed shoppers on vehicle specifications, omitted EVs from the sales conversation and strongly oriented customers towards petrol and diesel vehicle options. Dealers' technological orientation, willingness to sell and displayed knowledge of EVs were the main contributors to likely purchase intentions. These findings combined with expert interviews suggest that government and industry signalling affect sales strategies and purchasing trends. Policy and business strategies that address barriers at the point of sale are needed to accelerate EV adoption.\n\nObservation of increases in emission from modern vehicles over time in Hong Kong using remote sensing.\n\nPubMed\n\nLau, Jason; Hung, W T; Cheung, C S\n\n2012-04-01\n\nIn this study on-road gaseous emissions of vehicles are investigated using remote sensing measurements collected over three different periods. The results show that a high percentage of gaseous pollutants were emitted from a small percentage of vehicles. Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) vehicles generally have higher gaseous emissions compared to other vehicles, particularly among higher-emitting vehicles. Vehicles with high vehicle specific power (VSP) tend to have lower CO and HC emissions while petrol and LPG vehicles tend to have higher NO emissions when engine load is high. It can be observed that gaseous emission factors of petrol and LPG vehicles increase greatly within 2 years of being introduced to the vehicle fleet, suggesting that engine and catalyst performance deteriorate rapidly. It can be observed that LPG vehicles have higher levels of gaseous emissions than petrol vehicles, suggesting that proper maintenance of LPG vehicles is essential in reducing gaseous emissions from vehicles.

In order to address this data gap, wine was investigated as a potential proxy for atmospheric lead conditions. Wine spanning sixty years was collected from two wine regions proximal to the South Australian capital city, Adelaide, and analysed for lead concentration and lead and strontium isotopic composition for source apportionment. Maximum wine lead concentrations (328Â Î¼g/L) occur prior to the lead-in-air monitoring in South Australia in the later 1970s. Wine lead concentrations mirror available lead-in-air measurements and show a declining trend reflecting parallel reductions in leaded petrol emissions. Lead from petrol dominated the lead in wine ((206)Pb/(207)Pb: 1.086; (208)Pb/(207)Pb: 2.360) until the introduction of unleaded petrol, which resulted in a shift in the wine lead isotopic composition closer to vineyard soil ((206)Pb/(207)Pb: 1.137; (208)Pb/(207)Pb: 2.421). Current mining activities or vinification processes appear to have no impact with recent wine samples containing less than 4Â Î¼g/L of lead. This study demonstrates wine can be used to chronicle changes in environmental lead emissions and is an effective proxy for atmospherically sourced depositions of lead in the absence of air quality data.
