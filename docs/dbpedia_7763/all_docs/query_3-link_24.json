        "text": "Many celebrities and noteworthy individuals have called North Carolina home at some point in their lives. From actors to musicians, politicians, and athletes. And some elected for North Carolina to become their final resting place after death. In all honesty, there are way too many to name. But as we are approaching fall and spooky season (I know I know, it is a ways off but Iâ€™m ready), I figured sharing 13 of the famous people who are buried in North Carolina would be appropriate. And I have to say, some of these are people I would not have expected even had connections to North Carolina. Others make perfect sense are they were important members of the local community.\n\nOne exception was made on this list, for a noteworthy individual who technically is not buried here. Instead, his ashes are spread in a place that was special to him. Other than that, each of the other 12 individuals included on this list is buried somewhere in the state of North Carolina. Final resting sites include the mountains, the Piedmont, and on the coast. Each of these people left their mark and legacy on the world in their time. And they will forever be linked to our great state."
