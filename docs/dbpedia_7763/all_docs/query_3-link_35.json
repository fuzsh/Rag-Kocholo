        "text": "After an included breakfast at the hotel, the morning is yours to explore Turin at your leisure. At 12:30 p.m., a VBT representative will be in the lobby to meet you. Please have lunch before meeting the rest of the group.\n\nAll guests will travel to Canale (approximately one hour southeast of Turin), in Piedmont’s lovely Roero region. Arrive at your beautiful agriturismo, a country resort and working farm set on an estate of 86 acres. After a safety and bike-fitting session, don your bike gear and follow your trip leaders on a short warm-up ride through the hotel’s surroundings.\n\nYour culinary bike tour of Italy begins with truffle hunting. Join an expert farmer, or trifolao, and her dogs Alba, Teo and Edvige on the property grounds. Together, you set out in search of the precious underground fungus. During this invigorating outing, you will learn how to choose truffles and how to preserve them. Your hunt will be rewarded with a tasting.\n\nThis evening, gather for a welcome cocktail back at the hotel, sampling local wines and cheese. Your welcome dinner is at the estate’s restaurant, complemented with wines from their farm. Their delicious array of products fresh from their gardens offer a wonderful introduction to Piedmont’s locally sourced cuisine.\n\nToday's Ride Choices\n\nAfternoon: Warm-up — 11 km (7 miles)\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nAfter an initial downhill from your agriturismo, enjoy an easy ride toward Canale and into the countryside. You may tackle the steep hill on the way back or avoid it by walking a very short distance.\n\nCumulative Distance Range: 11 km (7 miles)\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Dinner\n\nThis morning’s hearty breakfast features dishes cooked with fine local ingredients.\n\nYour route today leads you through some of Piedmont’s stunning farmlands and natural beauty to the ancient Roman city of Pollenzo, today a timeless village whose architecture spans the ages. Though most of the remains of ancient Rome have been destroyed, the shape of the ancient amphitheater is still visible, as you’ll see by walking among the terraced houses built upon the site. In the town piazza, admire the neo-gothic monuments built by the Royal Savoy family, whose King Charles Albert made Pollenzo his favorite holiday resort.\n\nToday Pollenzo is home to the internationally known University of Gastronomic Sciences, established in Corte Albertina in 2004 by the Slow Food Organization. The university embraces the latest models of agriculture and the preservation of biodiversity. At the adjacent Wine Bank, more than 300 winemakers regularly select, store and preserve their best vintages, making the history of Italian wines available for future generations. Discover Pollenzo and its treasures on your own during a short stop.\n\nAfterward, shuttle across the River Tanaro, the natural northern border of the Langhe, birthplace of the great wine Barolo. The breathtaking hilly landscapes you’ll traverse, or langa, are famous for wines, cheeses and truffles. Here, the winemaking culture, traditions and terrains are among Europe’s finest examples of man’s harmonious relationship with nature and are considered an aesthetic archetype of European vineyards, earning this entire area a place as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Arrive in La Morra and enjoy lunch on your own. It is truly a privilege to cycle here.\n\nContinue cycling these gorgeously landscaped routes, mostly downhill. As you coast through the valley, you’ll savor spectacular views of the hilltop villages of Verduno and Roddi, each crowned by stately castles. Your destination is the majestic Tenuta di Fontanafredda. Spread over 296 acres (120 hectares) of vineyard-cloaked land, this sprawling estate and wine village incorporates several historical buildings, wine cellars, a beautiful park with rare plants and trees, a lovely pristine lake, and meditation zones. Browse through the hotel’s unique library or stroll the trails of its vast park, the Woods of Thoughts to relax and explore this unique place.\n\nThis evening, enjoy dinner at the hotel restaurant of Cascina Galarej, with open views of the surrounding hills. The chef is committed to using the finest Piedmont ingredients according to the Slow Food ethics.\n\nToday's Ride Choices\n\nMorning: Canale to Pollenzo — 30 km (19 miles)\n\nAfternoon: La Morra to Hotel — 14 km (9 miles)\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nDeparting from the hotel, you’ll ride into the Roero forested region on an undulating route with little car traffic, arriving in Pollenzo before lunch. In Pollenzo, we offer an 8-km (5-mile) shuttle to avoid traffic and the long uphill into La Morra, your lunch stop. The afternoon ride is mostly downhill and flat, with only one rolling hill, on paved country roads. On the final stretch you will cycle through a village with some car traffic.\n\nCumulative Distance Range: 14 – 41 km (9 – 26 miles)\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Dinner\n\nToday, ride or shuttle to the hilltop town of Roddino. Your invigorating ride, initially uphill till Roddino, will continue along an easy route, tracing a crest that offers beautiful sweeping views of manicured vineyards and farms. You will cycle though the medieval village of Monforte, worth a stop and stroll along its scenic and picturesque alleyways. En route to Barolo note the region’s rectangular cascine farmhouses, unique to Piedmont. The longer sides of these buildings face the sun for warmth in winter and are embellished with an arcaded terrace, stone floors and iron railings overflowing with colorful flowers.\n\nBefore lunch, pedal into Barolo and admire its impressive castle. This quaint medieval village gave the world-famous, light-colored red wine its name. You will have time to explore and enjoy lunch on your own at a local café. Perhaps you’ll sample wine at one of the many cantinas or stroll the cozy streets, full of little quaint shops and cafés. You may also visit the interesting WIMU, the wine museum located in the castle of Barolo.\n\nThen, cycle downhill back to your hotel or add miles for a scenic ride to Sinio in the Talloria Valley.\n\nLater today at the hotel, follow our expert guide through the underground historic wine cellars of Tenuta di Fontanafredda, among the 100 finest cellars in the world. The King of Italy Vittorio Emanuele II bought the estate in 1858 and 12 years later decided to cut most of the forest to plant the first vineyards. His son, the Prince Emanuele Alberto, later transformed the estate into a formidable wine business by partnering with the Marques Falletti and Count Cavour to create the now-famous Barolo wine.\n\nThis evening shuttle to Alba, the capital of white truffles, for a stroll or maybe some shopping before dining on your own. You must try the delicious ravioli del plin or tajarin pasta!\n\nToday's Ride Choices\n\nMorning: Fontanafredda to Barolo — 24 km (15 miles)\n\nAfternoon: Barolo to Hotel — 6 km (4 miles) OR Barolo to Sinio and Hotel — 26 km (16 miles)\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nA steady and gradual uphill takes you through the hilltop wine village of Serralunga to Roddino. To skip these first 10 km, you can ask for a van shuttle. From Roddino enjoy a panoramic ride along the crest of a hill through the village of Monforte on your way to Barolo. The afternoon short ride is easy and downhill, taking you back to your hotel. The optional longer ride in the Talloria Valley includes a long and very manageable uphill to Sinio, followed by a gradual downhill back to the hotel. All routes are well paved with little car traffic.\n\nToday may offer an additional independent ride for experienced cyclists. Ask your trip leaders for details.\n\nCumulative Distance Range: 6 – 50 km (4 – 31 miles)\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast\n\nToday your ride follows a high route into Alta Langa, a stunning patchwork of hazelnut trees, towering oaks, and wide-open views of the Alps. You cycle an ancient road that Napolean traveled during his first war campaign in the region. Later, you descend into a valley that follows the ancient Roman trade route linking France and Italy. Coastal Ligurians traded wine, cheese, honey and especially salt in Piedmont and France. Pause for lunch in one of the most beautiful villages of Italy: sleepy Millesimo, reclining on the banks of the Bormida River. Its ancient bridge dates to the 12th century, sure to be one of the best photo ops of your vacation.\n\nContinue your ride on an easy winding route along the Bormida into the Italian region of Liguria. At ride’s end, join a shuttle to our next hotel, built on the sandy beach of San Lorenzo al Mare on the Italian Riviera. Enjoy a welcome aperitivo and settle in, stroll on the beach, or swim in the azure waters of the Ligurian Sea. In 2023, the Foundation for Environmental Education awarded this stretch of sea again with the Blue Flag for the cleanliness of its beaches and seawater and its sustainable tourism.\n\nYou dine at the hotel restaurant tonight.\n\nToday's Ride Choices\n\nMorning: Bossolasco to Millesimo — 35 km (22 miles)\n\nAfternoon: Millesimo to Calizzano — 24 km (15 miles)\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nYour ride is particularly scenic this morning as you cycle an easy rolling panoramic route in Alta Langa, at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. There’ll be little traffic, with the exception of some motorbikes. After about 28 km (17 miles), you descend into the Bormida River valley and stop for lunch. The afternoon ride is almost flat or very gradually ascending as it follows the river upstream. You are picked up at the end of the ride to shuttle to your next hotel. Routes are well paved, with little car traffic.\n\nCumulative Distance Range: 24 – 59 km (15 – 37 miles)\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Dinner\n\nAfter breakfast, cycle from your hotel on an easy scenic bike path, built on former railway tracks that trace the breathtaking Ligurian coast. The path is paved and well maintained, enjoyable for fast riders, beginners, and locals.

In the town piazza, admire the neo-gothic monuments built by the Royal Savoy family, whose King Charles Albert made Pollenzo his favorite holiday resort.\n\nToday Pollenzo is home to the internationally known University of Gastronomic Sciences, established in Corte Albertina in 2004 by the Slow Food Organization.
