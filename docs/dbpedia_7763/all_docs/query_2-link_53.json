        "text": "Occasionally, exceptional people come into your life who change the trajectory of what you will become. For me, that person was Senator David Pryor, who would have turned 90 today. I spent some time this week nostalgically looking through mementos & appreciating the profound impact Senator Pryor had on my life. DP, your unmatched kindness, your humble integrity, your deep commitment to democracy & public service, & your belief in the beauty of both equality & of helping others have inspired me ‚Äî and countless others ‚Äî for 30+ years. We miss you, DP, but on your birthday, we cherish the times we had with you, remember the marvelous stories you told, & ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî honor an amazing life of truely selfless public service, wholly dedicated to the people of our home state of Arkansas. HBD, DP.\n\nWhile I'm extremely excited & proud to serve on the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund‚Äôs Campaign Board, I'm especially grateful for another volunteer role I have with this fantastic organization ‚Äî as a longtime mentor for Victory's Congressional Internship Program. What I gain from my interactions with these incredibly talented & public-service-focused students always far exceeds the time I invest in serving as a mentor. Victory's Congressional Internship Program works to develop the next generation of LGBTQ+ public leaders. Each semester, this program brings outstanding LGBTQ+ undergrads to D.C. for an intensive leadership program & provides them an opportunity to intern on Capitol Hill. Kudos to Luke McDermott for his work this summer & for a very insightful blog post! I particularly loved this point he made: \"Only through visibility & unyielding advocacy can we enact meaningful change for the millions of queer individuals we represent nationwide. Our identities aren‚Äôt hindrances; they‚Äôre guiding lights in our journey of public service.\" Here's to your continued success, Luke, & a hearty congrats to all you‚Äôve already achieved ‚Äî the fellowships & scholarships & public service programs, most recently the incredibly competitive Obama-Chesky Voyager Scholarship for Public Service! I look forward to seeing all the great things you'll do this year & for the years to come! Thanks for being a fantastic mentee!\n\nEarlier this month, I had the pleasure of chairing the National LGBTQ+ Bar Association‚Äôs annual Corporate Counsel Institute & moderating a panel on how companies & their executives can navigate through (yet another) divisive election year. My amazing panelists Adie Olson, Darrin Lim, Antonio Fern√°ndez, & Phillip J. Wallace shared practical tips on how companies can legally & responsibly engage with both employees & politicians. Two key takeaways from that discussion: (1) transparency is paramount (see Altria‚Äôs Lobbying and Political Activities Transparency & Integrity Report as an example) & (2) don‚Äôt neglect reputational risks (both inside & outside your company) when making decisions in this area. It‚Äôs not an easy time for corporate government affairs executives, but there are ways to ensure your company operates effectively, legally, & responsibly.\n\nEarlier this year, I used this OLCC ethics scandal as the topic of my plenary keynote for the NATIONAL ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL ASSOC INC‚Äôs annual conference. While the state has just announced that criminal charges will not be brought, an earlier internal investigation found that half-a-dozen government managers & executives bought bottles of rare, premium bourbons by using both their position as government employees & the information they knew because of their government jobs to gain access to the bourbon--access that the general public did not have. My view here is that this scandal occurred because the employees saw ethics only as a mere list of do's & don'ts, when they should have focused on the purpose behind the ethical requirements---the values-based duties that are the foundation for existing ethical standards. These are what I call the 5 Covenants of Government Service, & each ethical requirement for government employees is based on one of these duties: The Duty to Serve the Public Interest--which requires selfless service & loyalty; The Duty of Fairness & Impartiality--which requires objective, merit-based decision-making; The Duty of Accountability--which requires transparent, clear processes; The Duty of Integrity--which prohibits personal advantages, perks, or special privileges; & The Duty to Maintain Public Trust--which prohibits the appearance of impropriety. We need to educate government employees on these 5 Covenants, to allow them to understand the foundational elements that would have either prevented the scandal altogether or given someone the understanding to raise a concern about whether they should be engaging in such conduct.\n\nA belated thank you to the ACC National Capital Region for hosting a wonderful LGBTQ+ celebration following the National LGBTQ+ Bar Association's Lavender Law Conference & Career Fair. It was lovely to see so many longtime (and some long-lost) friends & colleagues from D.C., & it was an true honor to be recognized & celebrated alongside so many other LGBTQ+ individuals who are leaders in the D.C. area in-house bar, including amazing people like Henrique Canarim, Christopher Hopkins-Gillispie, & Kathi Westcott! While I love my bi-coastal life, I do miss the connections I've made over (so many!) years with my D.C. legal crowd! Also, thanks for your steadfast leadership at ACC NCR & for always being so kind to me, Shannon Graving!\n\nIn the last week, the internet has given me faith in the goodness of people. Truly. That may seem like an odd reaction to something that is often chock-full of trolls & haters. But, there‚Äôs an immensely kind humanity packed in there too. And, they showed up for me. Last week, my sweet Airedale Hattie died suddenly, just weeks before her 4th birthday. I work remotely, & she was my constant companion during the work day, my hiking buddy in the evenings, my errand sidekick, & my literal ride-or-die through 5 cross country trips & multiple SF-LA trips. We managed to pack a lot of adventures into her far too brief life. So, I posted about her passing in a Facebook group I follow titled ‚ÄúLife is Better with an Airedale‚Äù (because it obviously is!). Almost 1,000 strangers have so far reacted to express their sympathy, with many leaving such heartfelt condolences & expressions of grief. All for a complete stranger. It‚Äôs been astounding & heartwarming & really beautiful. J.R.R Tolkien summed it up: ‚ÄúI have found that it is the small everyday deed of ordinary folks that keep the darkness at bay. Small acts of kindness & love.‚Äù Let‚Äôs all remember the immense value of kindness, even in places that aren‚Äôt known for kindness. And if anyone asks why, tell them you‚Äôre doing it for sweet Hattie. üíï üêæ üíï üêæ üíï\n\nDuring my tenure as president of the National LGBTQ+ Bar Association, I testified before a number of legislatures to encourage them to ban the heinous LGBTQ+ \"panic\" defense. Those legislative victories are some of my proudest accomplishments as a bar leader. However, there were lots of low moments too. Immediately after my testimony at one hearing -- before a committee of the New Hampshire House -- a legislator said he opposed the bill because the state should not give \"special privileges\" to those who have \"some deviant sexuality\". Given my testimony had just concluded, it felt like an attack made directly at me, even as the Chair gaveled the legislator down & abruptly adjourned the hearing. The remark earned the legislator a place on Instinct Magazine's \"Here‚Äôs Your Bucket of Homophobes That Are in the News Today\". Not surprisingly, the bill failed in committee that year. However, good advocates never give up. And, on this day in 2023--three years after that incident--Republican Governor Sununu signed legislation enacted by the Republican-controlled House & Senate to ban the \"panic\" defense. It's the first state to pass such a ban with a trifecta of Republican-control (State House, State Senate, & Governor's Office). So, happy anniversary H.B. 315, from all of us who have \"some deviant sexuality\" because what is right, true, & just eventually prevails, as long as we collectively resist & persist.\n\nOne of my favorite events of the year starts tomorrow ‚Äî the annual Lavender Law¬Æ Conference & Career Fair, which is the largest LGBTQ+ legal conference in the country. I‚Äôm really looking forward to: ‚òëÔ∏è seeing so many great friends who I‚Äôve gotten to know at past Lav Laws; ‚òëÔ∏è networking with & meeting new LGBTQ+ legal colleagues; ‚òëÔ∏è attending incredible educational sessions & plenaries on cutting-edge LGBTQ+ legal issues; ‚òëÔ∏è leading the Corporate Counsel Institute, for in-house attorneys; & ‚òëÔ∏è moderating two panels (one on navigating political polarization & the other on GenAI) with an amazing line-up of speakers! Let me know if you‚Äôll be at Lav Law! #LavLaw #LavenderLaw"
