        "text": "When John Hartley first asked me (Patrizia) to write an appreciation for Umberto Eco, I thought that maybe it would be interesting to take a more personal point of view, although certainly a more partial one, and to offer to the readers of the International Journal of Cultural Studies the testimony of two different experiences of what it was like to work and study with Umberto: my own and that of Claudio Paolucci, a younger scholar belonging to the last generation of students who graduated with Eco. I was one of Umberto’s first collaborators and thus colleagues; and Claudio is one of his last students. We hope that our co-authored appreciation may throw light on some aspects of Umberto’s personality that are probably less well known to a larger audience, but maybe more meaningful in a personal way than his immense public biography.\n\nINTERVIEWER Many of your novels seem to rely upon clever concepts. Is that a natural way for you to bridge the chasm between theoretical work and novel writing? You once said that “those things about which we cannot theorize, we must narrate.” ECO It is a tongue-in-cheek allusion to a sentence by Wittgenstein. The truth is, I have written countless essays on semiotics, but I think I expressed my ideas better in Foucault’s Pendulum than in my essays. An idea you have might not be original – Aristotle will always have thought of it before you. But by creating a novel out of that idea you can make it original… I simply believe that at the end of the day a story is always richer – it is an idea reshaped into an event, informed by a character, and sparked by crafted language. So naturally, when an idea is transformed into a living organism, it turns into something completely different and, likely, far more expressive. (The art of fiction, 2008).\n\nIn The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco essentially presents an educative vision of some basic semiotic principles that infuse the textual form of a popular fictional genre—the detective story. In effect, it characterizes the postmodernization of the traditional “whodunnit” moving the genre from the realm of “the real” or the plausible into the realm of “the metaphysical” or the unthinkable. The Name of the Rose is a practical application in semiotics. Or, how the aesthetics of textual production as generated through the lexical signs and codes manifest the discursive text of a novel work. The semiotic twists and turns of the detective story facilitate this educational function and the purposeful transformation of the reader into an individual capable of appreciating and grasping the conflicting ideological viewpoints expressed through its dialogical structure. The detective genre enables the Umberto Eco to produce an educational narrative via the intricacies of plot in the detective story while teaching main aspects of semiotic theory.\n\nSystem is a key word for semiotics and linguistics and is a key word also in Umberto Eco's thought and philosophy. However, Eco always tries to find new words in order to express in a proper way his own idea of system. These new words are also new ways of thinking and rethinking the very core of his own philosophy and semiotics, which remains somehow stable during the years. Through these five words-summa, structure, code, encyclopaedia and rhizome-this paper aims at outlining an image of the evolution of Umberto Eco's thought and philosophy.\n\nIn this paper I analyse the results of a paradigmatic shift in the history of experimental writing. Drawing from the historiographical structure of natural sciences proposed by Thomas S. Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), I read Umberto Eco's theory of the 'open work' as a narrativisation of that shift or ‘change of paradigm’. In The Open Work (1962) Eco reads James Joyce’s Ulysses (1922) as a watershed for Western history. Joyce’s writing, according to Eco, offered a successful response to the European context of the 1920s that would change the experience of reading and writing forever, as well as the understanding of literary experimentation. This Joycean shift becomes apparent in the 1960s, when experimental publications by authors such as Italo Calvino, Julio Cortázar, B. S. Johnson and Georges Perec indicate that something characteristic was shared under this new paradigm; something that I call an experimentalism.\n\nPragmatism was one of the greatest influences on Umberto Eco’s intellectual adventure. This influence can be seen not only in his philosophical work, but also in many of the ideas hidden behind his novels, which, as Eco himself had recently admitted by authorising the Library of Living Philosophers to extensively cover such a topic in the volume dedicated to him, are an important part of his philosophy. Certainly, Eco always admitted the more than evident influence of Peirce on his semiotics and his thought. And his idea that semiotics was a decisive part of philosophy, if not the “contemporary form of philosophy” itself (Eco 1984; 2017) was influenced by Peirce’s thought. However, Eco’s relationship with pragmatism was not limited to the single relationship with an author (however decisive it may have been for his thought), to the returning to a series of topics and problems, or to the dialogue with a group of philosophers that had always had great esteem for pragmatism. Quite to the contrary, in my opinion, Eco’s thought was radically pragmatist in its ways and intentions and, on a deeper level, even in its specific style of thinking. In this paper, I try to identify three large legacies of pragmatism which were central in Eco’s thought and which shaped and influenced his philosophy to its foundations. The three of Eco’s overarching ideas that are marked in their very essence by pragmatic legacy are: i) the non-separation of semantics and pragmatics; ii) the centrality of abduction for cognition and semiotic thought; iii) synechism, or rather, the continuity between mind and world that Eco was unwilling to allow on a theoretical level, but which he explicitly puts on stage in narration.\n\nThe volume in now offered as free access by publisher Mouton de Grutyer in honour of Professor Umberto Eco who passed away a few months after its publication. This Special Edition of the journal, 'Semiotica: Journal of the International Association for Semiotic Studies', published in 2015, was read by Eco, who expressed his pleasure at the outcome - although he would have nothing to do with its production, for obvious reasons. The General Editor of the series is Marcel Danesi, University of Toronto The intention of this volume was twofold. Firstly to provide focus for an English reading public of Eco's work in Semiotic Theory without making reference to his novels, since much of the critical writing in English on Eco focuses on his novels rather than is his more influential work in interpretative semiotics. And secondly, to bring together a range of critical essays written by Eco's ex-doctorate students from Bologna University not previously available in English - thereby highlighting the role of translation in the dissemination of knowledge."
