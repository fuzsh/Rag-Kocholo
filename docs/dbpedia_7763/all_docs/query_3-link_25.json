The modern Barolos, which are mostly matured in oak barrels and show fewer tannins due to a significantly lower maceration time, can be enjoyed after the release of the vintage, even though they can still be in the cellar for more than 15 years.\n\nGrape varieties that lend Piedmont wines their distinctive style\n\nWhere are the best vineyards of Piedmont wine region?\n\nPiedmont wine region stretches between the Alps from the north and the Apennines from the south.
