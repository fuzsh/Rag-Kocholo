        "text": "The oldest hatred, now repackaged for a new era In the heart of Australia, I find myself distanced not just by kilometres, but by an aching disconnect. My children, their innocent eyes on the world, question with hurt: \"Why is there such hate towards us?\". The veil of 'liberation' and 'rights' that the world wears hides an uncomfortable truth. Today, political leaders don't whisper their prejudices in hushed corners; they parade them. Countries and communities, under the guise of activism, let loose a storm of anti-Semitic sentiments. This isn't activism. This isn't liberation. It's the oldest hatred, now repackaged for a new era. The Hamas assault, coldly cutting short the lives of 1,400 Jews, should've unleashed a tidal wave of condemnation. But, in a world where the wheels of outrage spin selectively, this act barely caused a ripple. Instead, all eyes, piercingly critical, turned to Israel's response. It's staggering how the international response reeked of bias. The UN, in its call for restraint, conveniently ignored the provocations by Hamas. The world's selective indignation towards Israel, and a troubling silence on Hamas's blatant transgressions, is a puzzle that pieces together into an uncomfortable image. Israel, a beacon of diversity and acceptance in a region often fraught with intolerance, stands judged. Women and men, regardless of their faith, find their voice and purpose within its borders. The LGBTQ+ community celebrates without fear of jail or death. So, when Israel is continually vilified, it isn't just irony, it's an orchestrated blindness. So, when the world stands up in outrage, why is its voice so inconsistent? Why does Israel's defence against aggression draw more ire than atrocities in Syria, Yemen, or the Uyghurs' plight in China? This isn't just selective; it's deeply prejudiced. The shadows of the Holocaust aren't a distant history. They loom, as the world, again, becomes a stage for anti-Semitism to flex its muscles, brazenly, openly. It's a call to arms, not of violence, but of consciousness. The world must rise, not just for Jews, but for the very soul of humanity. Because today, it's us. Tomorrow, another scapegoat might bear the brunt of global prejudice. For the sake of our children and the generations to come, let's tear away the facades, expose the raw, uncomfortable truths, and build a world that genuinely understands liberation. A New Era's Responsibility: This isn't mere activism or liberation. This is ancient hatred, clothed in modern guise. In an age where words echo endlessly in digital chambers, every retweet and share holds power. Freedom of speech isn’t a free pass to propagate hate. Disagree, debate, but don’t demonize. It's not just about taking a stand, but understanding where that stand leads us. Let's truly comprehend the repercussions of our actions, and ensure we're part of the solution, not the problem.\n\nAgainst the #war, the role of #women. My personal reflection and call to action. The women's role is to promote and insist on a global #peace conference. We represent the light for the #future of our #planet; the seed of life lives within us; we must promote calls for peace in every political sphere and contest. Let's stop this bloodshed! It's a global shame. War is everywhere; our soul is under attack, and we are losing humanity. War as a concept runs through the veins of us humans in every context and behavior; it's in every single word we use. It's part of our cells. These problems cannot be solved either with force, or with violence, or with crazy and unscrupulous actions. We only sow more seeds of hatred. The conflict can only be resolved with sincere dialogue and mediation and by finding meeting points linked to a greater why. And there is no peace if there is no collective justice and inclusion of #humanrights without autentic commitment. Women have a very important role. We must use our #feminineenergy, our interiority, to be the change we urgently ask to feel inside us first. Every woman is a spark of peace; it's a chance to transform hate into a new conversation. Women, stand up. Please share your voice in the sea of human revolution. This is our role today. All together, to support the flag of peace, a flag so big and generous can welcome flags of every color and position. War is born in the heart of every single human being, and from that small space, it breathes and spreads, fueled by our darkness. I'm Carola Salvato, a woman, mother, daughter, sister, and friend supporting life and its magnificence. We are all a miracle. We are all spectators but also actors of a planetary holocaust that sees the entire planet as a #battleground: we are all the #victims. We must protect innocents. Children first\n\nAbout a year ago, Christine Ahn and I had a conversation about the enduring legacy of war in both of our lives. Beyond the focus of my academic work, both my father and grandfather were drafted into the US Army and sent to Vietnam and Korea. Their experiences shaped my childhood and the lives of many in my family in difficult ways. Christine and I talked about how urgently we wished more feminist organizing was focused on ending war, rather than on getting more women into the military or into the same political institutions that see force as route to security. We dreamed of being with a coalition of activists, policymakers, academics, students, philanthropists, and community members to mobilize a counterweight of feminists against prevailing status quo systems that default to weaponization, punishment, and war. The Feminist Peace Summit begins today. In the months since this conversation, Israel's genocidal atrocities against Palestinians -- and the US's ongoing military support, both to Israel and against many across the US demanding change to its policies -- have made this dream more full of urgency and grief than either of us could have imagined. The Feminist Peace Initiative -- MADRE, GRASSROOTS GLOBAL JUSTICE, and Women Cross DMZ -- have been at the forefront of thinking and organizing for a feminist, movement-led approach to US policy for years. At the Sié Center, we are honored to collaborate with them to bring this Summit to reality. Over the next 3 days, more than 200 people will convene at the University of Denver - Josef Korbel School of International Studies to craft a roadmap for building a feminist peace agenda that moves the US away from militarism and war and towards policymaking grounded in justice, care, and sustainability. All of our plenary sessions are live streamed -- we invite you to join us: https://lnkd.in/g--AjdH7\n\nStudy shows right-wing extremist attitudes on the rise in Germany. BY TOBY AXELROD SEPTEMBER 26, 2023 #NeverAgainIsNow (JTA) — A new survey by a political think tank shows a major increase in right-wing extremist and #antisemitic attitudes in Germany. The study published on Thursday indicates that 8% of people in Germany have a right-wing extremist worldview, up from 2-3% in previous years. It was commissioned by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, which is associated with Germany’s center-left Social Democratic Party. An antisemitic worldview is held by 5.7% of respondents, up from 1.7% two years ago, and 3.3% in the previous survey. The number of those who totally rejected antisemitism dropped to 79.9 % from 88% and 86.8% in the previous two studies. In recent decades, many surveys of antisemitic attitudes in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have shown similar levels. Six percent of respondents liked the idea of a dictatorship, up from 2-4% in previous years. More people identify as right or right of center: 15.5 % compared to 10% in the previous two studies. https://lnkd.in/gqzsmcy5\n\nThe immense human suffering being inflicted upon the Palestinian people, especially Palestinian women, at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces and policies. The cries and shrieks of the oppressed in Palestine do indeed seem to be falling on deaf ears globally. The tragic reality - hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinian lives devastated, people killed, tortured, imprisoned, raped and displaced by indiscriminate Israeli bombings and violence. Mothers wailing inconsolably after losing their loved ones. It is an affront to humanity itself. On a day meant to celebrate the progress made on women's rights globally, we are reminded of the Palestinian mothers and women who continue to endure unconscionable trauma, oppression and injustice under the brutal occupation. Their wails of anguish should shame the world's collective conscience. The history is witnessing and recording this parallel parable - one where the world has failed miserably to protect and uphold the human rights, dignity and fundamental freedoms of the Palestinian people, especially women and children who make up a disproportionate number of the victims. The international community's apathy and inaction in confronting the grave injustices and violations by the Israeli regime enables this cyclical oppression to continue unabated. Mere platitudes and symbolic solidarity are clearly not enough. It is a moral stain that should weigh heavily on humanity that we allow such a prolonged and open injustice to persist in the 21st century. The dispossession, dehumanization and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people cannot be accepted as the status quo. The history will bear witness to these atrocities. Hopefully, this sobering re-examination on women's day will serve as a wake-up call to take concrete steps to end the repression of Palestinian women and their loved ones. Their resilience in pursuit of freedom and basic human rights deserves the world's unwavering support.\n\nWhat changed? Just names. 1939 to 1945. World War II resulted in 70 to 85 million deaths. World War II was the deadliest war in human history, with more civilian casualties than military personnel. Millions of people died from genocide (such as the Holocaust), planned starvation, massacres, and disease. A war fought on the factors that led to the start of World War II and the desired results. What we are taught as a history lesson and about subjects that are shameful for humanity. However, from what we see today, we see that the war is still not over in terms of brutality, civilian massacre, deaths of innocent people, destruction, oppression, genocide, occupation, annexation... and many other issues. World War II is what we are told about. The reasons behind the Nazis' decision to carry out genocide against the Jews, Romani (Gypsies), Disabled Individuals, Poles and Other Slavs, \"subhuman\" dark skinned (black) were complex and rooted in ideological beliefs. These reasons include racism, antisemitism, fundamental principles of Nazi ideology, and political objectives. Here are the reasons why the Nazis chose to commit genocide against: Antisemitism and Racism, Fundamental Principles of Nazi Ideology, Nazi Propaganda and Scapegoating, Nazi Political Objectives, Totalitarian Control and Systematic Genocide, Genocide emerged as a consequence of the Nazi regime's antisemitic ideology, representing one of the darkest periods in human history. These tragic events led to unprecedented humanitarian suffering and devastation throughout history. The end of World War II, marked by the victory of the Allies, indeed stood as a significant advocate for democracy, human rights, and freedom principles. However, asserting that these ideals have been fully and universally realized is challenging. In today's world, many societies still grapple with various challenges, and violations of human rights persist. Human history encompasses both progress and setbacks. Issues such as racism, societal discrimination, and religious bias continue to exist globally. Despite historical triumphs, democracy and human rights values have not been universally implemented and defended everywhere. Contemporary challenges arise from a combination of political, economic, social, and cultural factors. Nonetheless, numerous local, national, and international efforts persist in combating these issues and working towards the creation of fair and egalitarian societies. Civil society, activists, governments, and international organizations are actively striving to advance democracy and human rights values. At this juncture, when evaluating the present in comparison to a historical era, it is crucial to understand the current situation and consider what can be done now for improvement. Efforts by human rights advocates and initiatives to strengthen democracy play a critical role in societal change and progress.\n\nWW it does not matter if you have 2 followers or if you have 100,000 followers, if you have been silent on genocide, and you message me to thank me for my work, or if you message me to ask if I can use my platform to help you find a job, you will be checked because: 1. Racism: Your life and the safety of your family is not worth more than the safety and lives of brown, Black, and Indigenous Peoples, especially those being genocided. If you think your safety and comfort should be centered and valued at a higher rate, that’s racism. 2. Excuses: Our instructions from Palestinians are clear: bear witness and share their story. We are not accepting any excuses for your silence on genocide. Abdicating accountability by stating English is your second-language, especially while writing and communicating with clarity, does not hold water. 3. Receipts: We are checking receipts. If you have been doing performative nonsense like EDI work and you think you can lean on the last 10 years to defend your silence on the genocides (there are multiple, pick one), we see you and your support for colonialism and genocide. This is about here and now, and it is not too late to start.
