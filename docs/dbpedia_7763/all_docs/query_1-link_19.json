We require a minimum of 48 credits of college work, but we strongly recommend that you complete your undergraduate program.\n\nWe require a grade of C or better in all prerequisite coursework. Your required coursework includes:\n\nBiology\n\nTwo semesters of General Biology (eight semester hours) with laboratory.\n\nCell Biology or Genetics\n\nOne course (three semester hours); Lab is recommended but not required.\n\nChemistry\n\nOne semester of General Chemistry (four semester hours) with laboratory.\n\nOne semester of Organic Chemistry 1 (four semester hours) with laboratory.\n\nBiochemistry\n\nOne semester of General Biochemistry or Biochemistry 1 (three semester hours).\n\nNote: Introductory or survey courses are not acceptable.\n\nPhysics\n\nOne semester of Physics 1 (four semester hours) with laboratory.\n\nNote: Introductory or survey courses are not acceptable.\n\nMathematics\n\nOne semester of college-level mathematics (three semester hours) to be chosen among pre-calculus, calculus, and statistics.\n\nEnglish\n\nOne semester of English (at least three semester hours), preferably to include one semester of English Composition. Canadian students may satisfy English requirements in 3 possible ways: (1) 2 semesters of University humanities where essays composed at least 40% of the overall mark, (2) International Baccalaureate, and (3) Advanced Placement English.\n\nElectives/Humanities/Social Sciences\n\nNine semester hours; one of the courses to meet this requirement must be one of the following:\n\nComparative Anatomy\n\nMedical Terminology\n\nMicrobiology\n\nNutrition\n\nPhysiology\n\nSpanish (or other foreign language)\n\nPublic Speaking\n\nIntroduction to business\n\nCourse Number 902\n\nProvides the student with a clinical setting to integrate material that is taught in other Vet Prep courses. Within this clinical setting, the concepts of anatomy and physical examination will be demonstrated and then practiced by the student. This course integrates with the Case-based learning course. Clinical skills will be focused on small animals, however, other species will be introduced to emphasize comparative anatomy of common domestic species. Students will begin learning the process of acquiring information from a physical exam and applying it in order to formulate a clinical profile for an animal. Animal handling, restraint, and physical exam techniques will be demonstrated and practiced. Students are also introduced to the concepts of veterinary medical record-keeping, problem-based medical record, and the SOAP format.\n\nIndividual instructors will determine the requirements and consequences for attendance, which will be approved by Curriculum Committee and described, in writing, at the beginning of each course in the course syllabi.\n\nRUSVM is non-sectarian and does not close for the religious holidays of any specific denomination or group. Students who miss classes or laboratories without an approved excused absence will be responsible for the content of all missed course work. Examinations scheduled to occur on religious holidays will not be rescheduled.\n\nAs specified in the course syllabus at the beginning of a course, attending examinations and other required exercises is mandatory, except in the case an approved excused absence."
