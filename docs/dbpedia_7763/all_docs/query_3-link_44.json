        "text": "Famed for its truffles, and with towns like Barolo and Barbaresco, it’s easy to understand why Piedmont is a gourmand’s paradise.\n\nMany argue that Piedmont produces the best food in all of Italy. The Langa and Roero regions of Piedmont are in one of the most important wine production areas in Italy, and received UNESCO World Heritage status in 2014. The Chef Bike Tour of Piedmont will take us to the heart of these regions, over rolling hills covered with endless vineyards and past ancient castles and hidden hilltop hamlets. You’ll see how connected the local people are to the land, and how they take pride in everything they produce.\n\nVineyards cover most of the hills here and wines such as Barolo, Barbaresco, Barbera, and Nebbiolo are perfectly paired with dishes that will make each meal a gastronomic event. Towns like La Morra, Barolo, and Alba are perfect stops for a taste of what the region has to offer.\n\nIn Piedmont, exceptional wine often accompanies wonderfully paired cuisine. The culinary offerings of Piedmont fuse Northern Italian and French influences, with truffles and mushrooms taking center stage as seasonal highlights. Noteworthy Piedmontese specialties encompass \"tajarin\" (a type of fresh pasta), \"bagna cauda\" (a mild sauce featuring anchovies, olive oil, and garlic), \"risotto\" (Arborio rice cooked with diverse ingredients such as vegetables, porcini mushrooms, and cheeses), and \"agnolotti\" (local ravioli filled with a savory mixture of meat and vegetables).\n\nOn this special edition Chef Bike Tour you will visit Pollenzo where the Slow Food University of Gastronomic Science is based. You will learn about the Slow Food movement right at its birthplace.\n\nAccommodations during your journey include a UNESCO site, a family wine estate inn with a royal past, and a boutique hotel in the countryside.\n\nE-bikes (pedal-assisted system) available.\n\nOur guest chef will play an important role in understanding the local productions and the preparations that better tell the story of the territory.\n\nChef Jody Adams\n\nWe could not think of a better chef to cohost the Piedmont Chef Bike Tour than Jody Adams. The new edition of the Chef Bike Tour of Piedmont has been in the works for three years as we were waiting for the right time to bring her back on board. In the meantime, other projects came to life between Jody and her team and Beppe and Heather (Tourissimo co-founders) while the conversation on Piedmont continued, and the itinerary took shape.\n\nHer first Chef Bike Tour with Tourissimo was in 2018 when she joined the Chef Bike Tour pilot project in Emilia Romagna.\n\nIt's undeniable that Jody Adams is at ease in whatever kitchen - or country - you put her into. She is in love with Italy and has a deep knowledge of Italian cuisine that she constantly feeds.\n\nWe have lost count of how many restaurants she has opened in the last decade after the iconic Cambridge (MA) Rialto closed its doors, but it didn't stop shining a spotlight on her. And we love how she's used that well-deserved spotlight.\n\nA James Beard Award-winning Chef, she has never stopped advocating for humanitarian and social causes. Her new restaurant, La Padrona, will be opening inside the new Raffles Hotel in Boston in 2024.\n\nJody loves engaging with locals, and she always enthusiastically shares her knowledge, but also fun anecdotes and insights about being a restaurateur, with co-travelers.\n\nRead more about Jody\n\nJody in the Saline di Cervia with Tourissimo in 2018 - Photo credit Ken Rivard"
