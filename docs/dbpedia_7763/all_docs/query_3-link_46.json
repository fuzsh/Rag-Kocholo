The region also offers picture-perfect landscapes, enchanting villages, beautiful castles, top of the art wineries and world renowned local food specialties.\n\nPiedmont is the second largest of Italy’s 20 regions, after Sicily. It borders with France, Switzerland and the regions of Aosta Valley, Lombardy, Liguria and to a small extent also Emilia Romagna.\n\nThe name Piedmont stems from medieval Latin Pedemontium or Pedemontis, i. e. ad pedem montium, meaning “at the foot of the mountains”. Indeed, the region is surrounded on three sides by the Alps, including Monviso (Mont Vis), where the Po rises, and Monte Rosa.\n\nThe region has a population of about 4.4 million. The capital of Piedmont is Turin, once the first capital of the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nThe main local language is Piedmontese. Occitan and Franco-Provençal are also spoken by minorities in the Occitan Valleys and in the alpine heights of the Province of Turin respectively.\n\n2. Piedmont in 10 photos\n\n3.
