        "text": "“ITALIAN DIARY. Figures of our time\" the new book by Pier Franco Quaglieni with the profile of 29 characters who have left their mark on the country.\n\nPartly due to the repeated requests over the years from friends and readers, partly to deliver the articles published following the wave of the calendar to an organic collection, Pier Franco Quaglieni was released in bookstores on June 30th with his latest effort - one could say if the character were not armed with an indefatigable pen - with which this time he reflects on the great themes of twentieth-century ideologies. Communism, fascism, post-war and current anti-fascism, the sovereignisms of the Third Millennium.\n\nThe effort declared at the beginning of “Italian Diary” is to represent a story that does not rely on the one written by the winners alone, he quotes Norberto Bobbio and Dino Cofrancesco indicating the overcoming of the absolutist vision of good and evil.\n\nAs a historian and journalist – he is the founding president of the Mario Pannunzio Study and Research Center founded by Arrigo Olivetti and Mario Soldati with him as a young man in 1968 – accompanies the reader in revisiting the memory of our country through a long series of men and women (among these Maria Magnani Noya, Frida Malan, Bianca Montale, Carol Rama). We publish the complete list resulting from the volume's index: Giovanni Agnelli, Mario Allara, Piero Angela, Giulio Carlo Argan, Alberto Asor Rosa, Vittorio Badini Confalonieri, Manlio Brosio, Roberto Calasso, Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, Cosimo Costa, Renzo De Felice, Carlo Donat-Cattin, Luigi Firpo, Gustaw Herling, Arrigo Levi Umberto Levra, Maria Magnani Noya, Frida Malan, Giuseppe Manfredini, Bianca Montale, Oscar Navarro, Piero Ostellino, Luciano Perelli, Costanzo Preve, Carol Rama, Giulio Savelli Eugenio Scalfari , Gino Strada, Walter Tobagi.\n\n“Italian diary” closes with two chapters of reflection between past and present: \"My April 25th between memories and history\" and \"The accounts with fascism\"."
