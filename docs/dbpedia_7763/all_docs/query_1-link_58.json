Like a kite overcoming wind resistance to soar, we have\n\npushed through obstacles, constraints, and adversity to rise above\n\nand achieve our goals. The direction guided by our leadership\n\nreflects our clear planning and adaptability. Each move signifies\n\nSAFSâ ongoing pursuit of excellence, inspiring others to break\n\ntheir own barriers. This commitment embodies our dedication to\n\npersonal development, career advancement, and innovation.\n\nThank you for making 2022-2023 another memorable year for St. Anneâs.\n\nThe legacy of transforming lives is alive and well, just as it has been for\n\n115 years. I am hopeful and grateful to witness how we have evolved into the agency of\n\ntomorrow. By providing, the tools that help build and empower thriving families today,\n\nand the innovative comprehensive services, which secure brighter futures for generations\n\nto come.\n\nWe say it takes a village. Our Board members, executive leadership, dedicated staff\n\nmembers, donors, and volunteers all show up for our clients consistently. We have a strong\n\nvillage moving us into the future, bringing their best each and every day.\n\nAs I reflect, I am inspired amid new challenges and opportunities; some of which have\n\nbeen beautiful moments to assist those in need of St. Anneâs support. This annual report\n\nprovides a glimpse into our life at St. Anneâs Family Services. We hope you will continue\n\nto be a part of our journey. Thank you for being an integral part of the St. Anneâs Family\n\nServices community. Together we are making a lasting impact on the lives of children,\n\nfamilies, and individuals in need. We invite you to explore the pages of this report to learn\n\nmore about our accomplishments and the stories of those we have touched.\n\nWith heartfelt gratitude,\n\nLorna Little, MSW\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nSt. Anneâs Family Services\n\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT 3\n\nP:04\n\n4 ST. ANNEâS FAMILY SERVICES â¢ 2022 - 2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nCharting Our PATH TO SUCCESS\n\nThe pandemicâs economic impact created a\n\nlingering devastation that continues to threaten our\n\ncommunities. As it relates to programming facilitated\n\nby St. Anneâs Family Services (SAFS), data shows\n\nan increase in the number of young women who\n\nvoluntarily prolong their stay in an introductory\n\nhousing program even though they are âaging out.â\n\nTheir goal is to transition to our next program,\n\nNon-minor Dependents â Transitional Housing\n\nProgram because they fear that they wonât be able to\n\nfind affordable housing. In reference to young women\n\nbetween the ages of 18-25, they enter our three-year\n\ntransitional housing program to reduce the anxiety\n\nthat comes with searching for affordable housing for\n\nthemselves and their children.\n\nTo increase success rates, our supportive housing\n\nteams work closely with families to meet them where\n\nthey are without judgement. We provide guidance\n\nand support to help them stabilize and eventually\n\nattain self-sufficiency. By focusing on education,\n\nwe create pathways to success. During the past year,\n\nparticipants received their high school diploma,\n\ncollege degrees, and vocational certificates.\n\nWhile higher education is not the only answer, it\n\nprovides a solid foundation to start their educational\n\njourney. According to the National Center for\n\nEducation Statistics, the median earnings of those\n\nwith a bachelorâs degree were 55 percent higher\n\nthan the earnings of those who completed high\n\nschool. By providing equitable opportunities, we\n\ntackle the affordability crisis that plagues our city.\n\nFood insecurity is yet another critical\n\ncomponent of the affordability crisis. SAFS has\n\nwitnessed an increased need for basic nutritious\n\nfood items across our service lines. For some\n\nfamilies, one missed day from work has a\n\nspiraling impact on their food security,\n\nwhich directly equates to missed meals.\n\nFamilies face the heartbreaking decision of\n\nwhether to pay for rent or food. Nutrition\n\nis not a luxury. It is a basic human right to\n\nensure that children and families can thrive.\n\nP:05\n\nBREAKING BARRIERS â¢ CHARTING OUR PATH TO SUCCESS 5\n\nThanks to seed funds from the Board\n\nof Trustees and The Felician Sisters\n\nof North America, SAFS launched\n\nthe Felician Help & Hope Bank\n\nin 2022. Starting with an update to\n\nthe space on the ground floor of our\n\nAdministration building, we properly\n\noutfitted the space with shelving, and\n\nnew flooring. We then cultivated\n\nrelationships with grocers and\n\nfood distributors to stock the\n\nshelves with items for our\n\nfamilies. During our âsoft\n\nlaunch,â we distributed\n\n1,312 pounds of\n\nnon-perishable food\n\nitems, 260 packages of\n\ndiapers, and 716 items\n\nof cleaning supplies\n\nto families in all our\n\nprograms. In total, we\n\nserved more than 33 families\n\nand totaling 69 individuals\n\nduring this ramp up phase of the Help\n\n& Hope Bank.\n\nLos Angeles Unified School District\n\nofficially launched Transitional\n\nKindergarten (TK) across their\n\ncampuses changing the landscape\n\nof the Head Start program. This\n\nprogram serves 4-year-olds on their\n\nway to Kindergarten across Los Angeles\n\nproviding the fundamentals that lead\n\nto literacy and more. Demonstrating\n\nour commitment to education, SAFS\n\nhas served 124 children in the TK age\n\nrange at our onsite Early Learning\n\nCenters. Meanwhile, we began\n\nconsolidating our 4-year-old classroom\n\nofferings to one site located on our\n\nmain campus in our Bogen Early\n\nLearning Center. We immediately\n\nbegan the planning phase to transition\n\nour Head Start classrooms into Early\n\nHead Start classrooms â working with\n\ninfants and toddlers up to 3-years-old.\n\nWe also increased the parent education\n\ncurriculum to help pregnant and\n\nexpecting mothers understand early\n\nmilestones and how to instill the love\n\nof learning in their children.\n\nP:06\n\n6 ST.

ANNEâS FAMILY SERVICES â¢ 2022 - 2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nTRIUMPHS\n\nAbound\n\nCheyenne Rogers has experienced challenges\n\nand triumphs resulting in a strong, unstoppable\n\nconfidence. When she was a year old, she and her\n\nsiblings were placed into foster care. Although\n\nCheyenne was adopted when she was 6 years-old,\n\nthis stability did not stop the cycle of trauma. Fleeing\n\nfrom her abusive adoptive home, she experienced\n\nhomelessness at the age of 12 and found herself back\n\nin foster care when she was 13. Living in a group home\n\nsetting, she quickly learned the power of boundaries\n\nand exerting her own voice. Cheyenne moved all over\n\nLos Angeles, San Bernardino, and Orange Countiesâ\n\nall the while attending different schools and obtaining\n\ngood grades.\n\nWhen Cheyenne found out she was pregnant at\n\n16-years-old with her healthy and beautiful daughter,\n\nLayla, she was determined to stabilize and welcome\n\nthe child into a healthy environment. She learned\n\nabout St. Anneâs Family Services and was excited to\n\nattend school and have a safe and stable place to raise\n\nher daughter. According to the residential counselors\n\nwho worked with Cheyenne during this time, she was\n\nquick to learn the rules and advocated for herself and\n\nher peers. The boundaries and rules set at St. Anneâs\n\nhelped Cheyenne thrive, stabilize, and focus on her\n\nparenting goals toward independence.\n\nCheyenne went on to graduate from high school on\n\ntime. With good grades and the support of everyone\n\nat St. Anneâs Family Services, Cheyenne applied to\n\ncollege. The team helped move Cheyenne to the family\n\ndorms at the University of California, Riverside where\n\nshe eventually graduated with her bachelorâs\n\ndegree with Layla by her side every step of the way. She\n\nknew she wanted to study for the LSAT while working\n\nat a non-profit law firm, advocating for Transition Age\n\nYouth in Foster Care.\n\nCheyenne and Layla live in Connecticut where\n\nCheyenne attends the University of Connecticut\n\nSchool of Law. She clerked at Youth Law Center\n\nwhere she saw issues like those that she faced, which\n\ncontinue to affect Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice\n\nYouth. She is also exploring other types of law to best\n\ndetermine which area she would eventually like to\n\npractice. While not in school, she works at UConnâs\n\nLegal Clinic as a legal interpreter to low-income\n\ncommunity members seeking legal assistance.\n\nAlthough Cheyenne finds great joy in fighting for the\n\nrights of others, her favorite role is that of a proud\n\nmom to Layla who is now 11-years-old. Layla is a good\n\nstudent and very active in the competitive cheerleading\n\nworld. Like every mom, Cheyenne is often driving\n\nfrom one competition to another, while working and\n\nstudying in between car rides and practices.\n\nSAFS recognized Cheyenneâs resilience and excellence\n\nduring the Evening of Angels gala this past year. She is\n\na beautiful example of strength for her daughter and\n\nliving proof that you can achieve wonders with the\n\nsupport of a community that cares.\n\nSpotlight on the 2023\n\nTriumph Award Honoree,\n\nCheyenne Rogers\n\nP:11\n\nBREAKING BARRIERS â¢ CHARTING OUR PATH TO SUCCESS 11\n\nSt. Anneâs Family Services celebrated our 2023 Angel Award Honorees: Gina Zapanta & Mike Alder,\n\nMarsha Garnett, Terri Holoman, and Triumph honoree, Cheyenne Rogers.\n\nP:12\n\n12 ST.
