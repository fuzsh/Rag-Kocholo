I will be looking into the psychology of fear and also why dolls are such a scary element in the horror genre. Love and fear are two key emotions in my production and I will be looking into these and the relationship between them, to find out how they can add more depth into my horror film. To see what people are afraid of, I will also be looking at YouTube videos that could help me to discover more about fear and just general themes that I could add into my production to make it more effective. I want to find out about how I can create an intense atmosphere with the scenes through music and tension and maybe discover other elements that could fit in to help make my film a lot scarier. All these elements will help me when it comes to making my final production because they give me a better understanding of my topic and its themes so I can implement them cleverly into this project.\n\nFear of dolls\n\nLove and Fear\n\nChildren and their love of dolls\n\nFilmmakers that inspire me\n\nHARVARD REFERENCE: Jacob Olesen. (n/a). Fear of dolls phobia - Pediophobia. Available: https://www.fearof.net/fear-of-dolls-phobia-pediophobia/. Last accessed 4th Feb 2019.\n\nHARVARD REFERENCE: Dr Amanda Gummer. (2016). Why Children love dolls. Available: https://www.fundamentallychildren.com/2016/04/04/why-children-love-dolls/. Last accessed 5th Feb 2019.\n\nSummary\n\nLooking into why children enjoy playing with dolls has helped me to explore the innocence of the toy and what positive impacts they can have on a child's upbringing. This research is beneficial to my production because at the beginning of the short film, I want to have a scene where a child is playing with a doll. To make this scene realistic, I needed to understand the reasons to why children play with dolls. I now know that it is because they like to take control of how the dolls dress and what happens in their lives. From this research I will ensure to have the child at the beginning of the production, taking care of the dolls appearance to link in with how children behave towards dolls. The caring and compassionate nature of the child will juxtapose the museum owners brutal character traits and how he imprisions children later on in the film.\n\nMy next step was to look into finding videos that could explain the phobia of dolls to me in a more in depth way. I found this really interesting video which discusses Pediophobia and Pupa-phobia, which is the fear of puppets. It explains that humans are very good at identifying a real life human compared to an animatronic one. It also mentions that there is something people find more creepy about a doll that is sat still but it still feels like its eyes are following you or moving in a small way compared to a moving doll.\n\nSummary\n\nFrom this video I have learnt a lot about the fear of dolls and puppets and what makes them scary in different ways. This video has helped me to learn about a psychological event provoking fear compared to a physical event provoking fear. From watching this video I now know that moving and animated dolls are scary because they are physically out to kill people, but what can be more disturbing is a doll just sitting there staring at you but not doing anything. This is because the mind then creates the movement of the doll itself by tricking you into thinking its eyes are moving, or are they? These are questions that I will be giving to the audience in my production to make them feel unsettled about the dolls that I will be showing on-screen. This video has really helped me to see why people are scared of dolls like Annabelle. I now know that because of how still they are, this can make them more creepy because they are staring and not moving at all. I am going to implement the idea of stillness into my production because I now know to get lots of close ups of still dolls and close ups of their faces. This video says that people think dolls eyes are creepy because they look so vacant yet your mind can't help but think something is staring back at you. From this research, I have decided that I want one of the dolls in my production to be crying at the end. This would lead onto my next piece of research about the uncanny valley. Crying is a human thing to do, so seeing a doll with tears in its eyes could be unsettling for my audience because it crosses the barrier of being alive, but not alive enough.\n\nThe Uncanny Valley theory\n\nSummary\n\nThe uncanny valley is a very important part of my research because it has allowed me to understand how I can make dolls seem creepy to my audience. I have learnt that certain dolls and robots make people feel disturbed because they look similar to a human, yet they don't posess the same human characteristics that we find settling. I have really enjoyed researching the theory because I haven't heard about it before and it does now make sense why people find humanoid objects scary and creepy. I will be using this theory to create the fear that is necessary for a horror film. Now that I know why people find human looking objects, with non human characteristics scary, this is exactly what I will be putting into my production to provoke fear. This has really helped me to understand the psychological reasoning behind the fear of dolls so that I can cleverly scare my audience because I now have a better understanding of how and why people find these kind of objects terrifying.\n\nHARVARD REFERENCE: Masahiro Mori.

Last accessed 4th Feb 2019.\n\nAnthropomorphism\n\nThis is the behaviour of human traits and emotions shown to non human things. Anthropomorphising is when a human talks to or treats an inanimate object or non-human entity as if it had human emotions. This could be a doll or toy or even a dog because the person is still treating that thing as if it were another human. This links in well with my production because I want there to be a scene where the doll shop owner is speaking to the dolls which will create an awkward and creepy atmosphere for the audience. That compared with the doll's stillness will be what makes it unsettling and scary.\n\nHARVARD REFERENCE: Psychology Today. (n/a). Anthropomorphism .

Last accessed 8th Feb 2019.\n\nOverall Summary\n\nOverall, this research has helped me to develop my idea further through understanding the fear of dolls and the psychology behind it. I now know that having the dolls sat still and starring at the protagonist will be scary and then cutting back to the dolls having changed positions will make it unnerving for my audience. I have researched the psychology behind why young children enjoy playing with dolls to help me see the appeal of the toy. I think that this research was beneficial because seeing the innocent side will help me to make the dolls more scary. When people were younger, they might have played with dolls which would have been appealing at the time, but I want all these innocent memories to change in order to scare my audience. At the beginning of my production, I have decided to include a child playing with a doll then cut to the doll being in the museum in the present day. This will remind the audience of the innocence of dolls before I change their perception and show them children becoming trapped in dolls. I have also found out about the Uncanny Valley theory, which is very helpful when it comes to my final idea. It helps me to understand that scaring people by using dolls involves playing around with human characteristics and putting the two together to provoke fear. This theory is important for me to understand because it has helped me to see why some dolls are feared more than others.\n\nTarget Audience Research\n\nPrimary\n\nHow has this focus group helped me?\n\nCompleting this focus group has helped me to explain my idea and develop it further. I have also had the confirmation that my idea is suitable for my target audience and they have said that dolls do scare them. This is a good thing because my aim with this production is to create a scary short film, and the fact that dolls are seen as creepy by members of my target audience, suggests that I have selected a good theme to focus on. I am also glad that they like the storyline and Zara specifically mentioned that she finds dolls creepy now that she is older. This leads on from my topic research when I found out that dolls are a key part of child development and that we only find them scary when we are exposed to horror films or negative stories about them. This idea causes us to look at dolls in a different way and see them as creepy objects and this could be why my target audience are scared by dolls especially.\n\nI conducted a survey to confirm the target audience for my production. I originally planned to aim this at 15-25 year olds however; I wanted to get a second perspective to ensure that this was the right decision. This survey will be available for any age group to take because I want to see who they think that my target audience is. It also gives people an opportunity to say whether they think they are part of my target audience and why my idea appeals to them specifically.\n\nI conducted this survey to find out whether my target audience liked my production idea. I wanted to discover what they thought I could change or add to help me to develop my idea further. I posted this survey on Facebook and Instagram to get the highest amount of responses as possible. I also joined a horror Facebook group which allowed me to post my survey there and get insight from horror film lovers. Finding out about what locations my target audience want to see in my film, is also important so that I can tailor my production to suit them and what they think would make this production scary and successful.\n\nOverall Summary\n\nThis section of my research has been really beneficial for me to get a better understanding of my audience. I now know that 15-25 is a suitable age range for me to target my production. I will be aiming it at males and females because I believe that it isn't made for one specific gender. This research has improved my understanding of my target demographic and I now know more about what they want to see in my final production. I know that isolated locations are desired by my target audience and I do think that they will improve the aesthetic of my production. I have watched horror films and these types of locations are popular in the horror genre and I do want to follow the typical conventions. I have been made more aware of the elements that I can work on to create a successful production and I think that it is important to be aware of areas that I need to improve and develop more.\n\nSecondary\n\nHARVARD REFERENCE: Laura Frangi.

Back in 1975, The Texas Chainsaw Masacre was rejected to be put on film and wasn't accepted until 1999 and it was rated an 18. Nowadays, this sort of horror film would not been seen as too scary like it was back then, because people have adapted to the horror genre and they know what to expect from scary films and what they are getting themselves in for.\n\nFilms such as Coraline and Paranorman are rated a PG due to the length of the scary scenes and the frequency of them, they have been classed as appropriate for this age group.\n\nHARVARD REFERENCE: BBFC.

I find it really interesting how some of the techniques used actually don't require spending any money and they do look really professional and effective. One technique in this video that I thought was particularly impressive, was how they used reflective tape to make the eyes of the creepy woman glow slightly. This video has inspired me to think about budget ways to make my horror film successful and it has also shown me that being a filmmaker does make you critical of your own work but this does actually help you to improve more.\n\nYour browser does not support viewing this document.

I want to find out more about my genre and to do this I will be looking at some productions that have similar themes to my production. I want to look at films that have the same genre or films that contain dolls. This is because I want my research to be focused and by looking at these type of productions, I can learn more about how I can make my short film as effective as it can be for my audience. Another key part of this research is finding recurring elements that are used across all the films that I choose to watch and thinking about I could try implementing them into my own production. In each film, I will be looking at narrative structure and character profiles, alongside lighting, camerawork, mise en scene and how all of this suits the target audience. I think that looking closely at all of these elements in 4 separate productions, will really help me to understand the key horror film conventions and what effects they might have on the viewer.\n\nHorror Genre\n\nPsychological - takes something innocent and makes it disturbing and scary\n\nPossession - explores possession and has dark entities that disrupt people's lives\n\nSlasher - these are gory horrors usually with murders and bloody violence\n\nHaunted House - films involving a house that possess dark secrets\n\nHARVARD REFERENCE: Heather.

The Horror Film: An Introduction. Garsington Road, Oxford : Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p2.\n\nHow will this research benefit my final production?\n\nNow that I know what sub-genre my production fits into, I can begin exploring it further and discovering how I can make my production more engaging through research and practice. I think that psychological horror is the best sub genre because my production focuses on the innocence of dolls and making them more horrifying by personifying them through anthropomorphism. From Rick Worland's book, I have discovered that a lot of horror film conventions are developed from literature and history by filmmakers to make films. These typical conventions are twisted and changed in some way to make the stories new and more modern. The ideas that are found in post-modern literature are usually themes that are found in horror films to this day. This research is useful for me to understand so that I can take stereotypical themes such as death and curiosity and put these into my own film. I will be looking into other films that fit into this genre and filming test shoots of my own to put my findings into practice.\n\nPsychological Horror\n\nFor my film I have decided that my film fits into the psychological horror genre because it won't contain much gore but it will focus on scaring the audience mentally. With psychological horrors, the aim of them is to provoke mental fear within the viewer which is done by showing an internal battle within the protagonist. In my production this battle will be the pain of loosing a mate as well as a deep hunger for revenge. Both of these two problems when brought together should create a visual battle onscreen for the audience to become involved in. In psychological horror films,\n\nHARVARD REFERENCE: Ivy Lofberg.

Last accessed 12th Feb 2019.\n\nAnalysing productions\n\nPorcelain Rising\n\nNarrative\n\nThe narrative structure of this piece follows Todorov's Theory, because it has a very clear beginning, middle and end. At the start of the film it is clear that the young girl is afraid of something in her room because of the way she is looking. The equilibrium is the fact that she is afraid in her room and her father comes in to check that she is okay. He tells her to stop being silly and she still seems frightened. From the beginning of this short film, the audience are introduced to the idea that this girl goes to sleep at night afraid of something. The disruption in this film is when the doll comes alive and begins terrorising the young girl. This is the disruption because the girl's fear reaches its peak and something happens as a result of this fear. Then there is an attempt at a resolution when the father starts banging on the door of his daughters room. The new equilibrium is reached when there is a different girl lying on the bed and the once innocent little girl is stood by the window with a dolls mask on and a knife in her hand. There is pathetic fallacy used in this short film because there is thunder and lightening which adds to the uneasy atmosphere in the girl's room. I think overall that the narrative in this film is well thought out and it is made well and creates tension effectively.\n\nCharacter Development\n\nIn this short film there are 3 characters. The little girl, her dad and the doll. In short horror films there is only a small amount of time to show the audience the personalities of each of these characters. Propp's Theory shows that these three characters take on three specific roles. The villain is the doll because it is trying to scare the little girl. In Propp's theory, the villain is often the character that disrupts life for the other characters, and in this film, that is exactly what the doll does because she stops the girl from getting to sleep. The little girl is the character of the Princess because she is the one that needs saving and helping. The hero is the dad because at the end of the film he tries to help save his daughter. In this short film, the hero is unsuccessful meaning that the villain is victorious and becomes successful in their quest. In horror films it is often typical for the villain to achieve their aims rather than the hero being victorious.\n\nLighting\n\nThe lighting in this production is important due to the fact that it plays a part in the storyline of this film. A fear that is common with children is fear of the dark and in this short film, the father could misinterpret this as being the reason why his daughter is scared. She points to the doll to tell her father what she is afraid of but the darkness in the room does make it more eerie and stereotypical of a horror film. The weather in the film is also typical for a horror film. There is thunder and lightning outside which makes the atmosphere in the scene scary. In this film, the small amount of lighting means that there are shadows around the little girls' room and this does make everything look menacing. I think that the lighting is cleverly used in this production and it is conventional of a horror film. In my production, I will think about the use of lighting and how I can use it to my advance to create the atmosphere that suits my genre.\n\nCamera Movement\n\nThe camera movement in this short film is minimal, however; at the end when the action builds up, the camera movement becomes more erratic to represent the struggle of the little girl. I do think that small amounts of camera movement are effective in horror films because the contrast between small and large amounts of camera movement creates the jump scares and the scary moments in the film. I like the panning of the camera in this film because I think that it makes the footage look smooth and professional. I will definitely be referring back to this film and looking at the way camera movement is used so that I can use some of the panning techniques in my film and looking at having erratic camera movement in the more intense scenes.\n\nSound\n\nThe sound used in this production is very minimalistic. At first, all the viewer can hear is the sound of thunder outside which does set the scene nicely. I think that having no music in horror films is effective because it helps the audience to get their own feel from a scene rather than being influenced by the nature of the music that is being played. There is music in this piece but it only starts when the camera focuses on the doll. I really like this technique because when the unnatural entity (the creepy doll) is shown, the music starts which makes the scene seem more unnatural. I do like the music that is used in this production because it is intense and scary. The doll starts chanting some words at the end of the film which is also quite scary and a nice added extra to make the film fit in well with the genre.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nThis production would be suited for my target audience because it builds tension effectively and uses themes that would frighten them. I think the childish themes will help the audience to empathise with the little girl because they have been through childhood and experienced fears similar to what the young girl is experiencing. The fact that my target audience are 15-25 year olds, childhood was not too long ago for them which I believe makes this film more effective. The way the doll is portrayed in this film does relate back to the uncanny valley theory that I have conducted research into. The idea that dolls look quite similar to humans but they don't possess the same human characteristics does fit in well with the fear element in this video. This film has really helped me to think about my target audience more and what they would like to see in a horror film and thinks that might scare them. The most useful thing that I have taken from watching this film, is thinking about using innocence and themes of childhood to allow my audience to empathise with the characters.\n\nHARVARD REFERENCE: Empowered by Color .

Last accessed 16th Feb 2019.\n\nInsomnia\n\nNarrative\n\nInsomnia is a short film that uses the struggle of the protagonist to scare the audience. The main character is struggling with insomnia and the narrative begins when she is offered pills by her doctor to help with sleeping. The disruption in this short film is when the protagonist starts having dreams about her sister who ran away from home. Having dreams about an absent relative is a good way to introduce spirits and subconscious into horror films. I do like the idea of dreams and them disturbing the protagonist. At first these dreams that the girl has are good dreams but then they become confusing and more like nightmares. The end equilibrium is reached when the protagonist starts confusing reality with the dreams and she ends up strangling her sister in real life and not just in the dream. I think that this ending does conclude the whole film well because the tablets have had their full effect on the protagonist and made her commit a murder. This is a typical ending to a horror film where the end scenario is a lot worse than the first situation that she was in. In my production I will be keeping this in mimd because creating a horrifying new equilibrium is a convention of a horror film from what I have discovered so far.\n\nCharacter Development\n\nThe characters in this short film are not as simple to identify as the character types in the other productions that I have watched. I have decided that the main character in this film fits the role of the false hero. At first she is the victim of Insomnia and the audience are made to feel sorry for her, but towards the end she becomes a lot more violent and ends up killing her sister. Although the medication drove her to this, she still fits the role of this false hero because she starts off the film as good and ends the film as an evil character. The sister of the protagonist fits into the role of the princess because at the end of the film, she is put in a position where she needs saving and her life is at risk. Unfortunately, no one comes to help her but she is still the princess in this film because of her vulnerability. I have found that the common theme of horror films is that the princess never gets saved. This is very interesting and definitely something to think about for my final script. In my film, I am planning to have a similar outcome for the princess stereotype in order to fit the conventions of a horror film. The doctor in this film is the dispatcher because he gives the protagonist the medication to help her with her illness. At the beginning of the film he sends the patient off with the medication and organises a session for a few weeks later to discuss if it is working. He is the dispatcher because he is the one that helps the protagonist with her condition and sends her off with the tools to deal with it herself. I think that these character types are quite unconventional for a horror film but they do work well. I also think that there are multiple interpretations of these characters and which role they could fit into.\n\nLighting\n\nThe lighting in this particular film, helps the viewer to understand what time of day it is in that scene. For example, the doctors scenes are very naturally lit which almost represents exposure. The main character is visiting the doctor for help and therefore she is displaying all of her weaknesses and showing herself naturally for who she really is. At night time, there is commonly a light on in the scene inside for example a bedside lamp or the light from the TV. This is always a temporary source of light but definitely a light that the protagonist is in control of. I feel that this is very important for the scene because when she turns out the light for bed she is becoming vulnerable because sleep is where her problems occur. Darkness is a very vulnerable thing anyway because it takes away one of the 5 human senses. I think that the use of light in this respect is very effective and it shows the characters vulnerability in a different way through the lighting of a scene. I do like the overall lighting used in the productions and I feel like it complements the scenes and it is used effectively to convey the moods in the scenes.\n\nCamera Movement\n\nI feel that this production didn't really use much camera movement. I think most of the shots were still and they were actually effective for the type of short film that this was. The camera moved the most in the dream sequences and I did really like this idea. I think that the camera movement represented how the protagonist felt stuck in life with her condition and the only time she felt free was in her dreams because they were liberating and she could escape from the insomnia. The stationary representation was not only in the camera movement but also in the way the character moved too. I felt that at the beginning of the film, she was always filmed sitting down and not moving much which showed that she was so stuck with what to do. Later on in the film when she starts taking medication, she begins moving around a lot more which shows that she is becoming more free.\n\nMise en scene\n\nIn this film, the mise en scene that is used does help to portray the situations that are in the film. The clothing that is worn by the children in the girl's dream is colourful and bright in contrast to the darker clothing that is worn by the other characters. I think that costume in this film is really important to the film and it helps the audience to understand what is happening to the characters internally. For example, if a character is wearing darker clothing then it could reflect that they are feeling sad and angry. It could also represent what type of character they are in the film.\n\n​\n\nThe Quiet Zone\n\nNarrative\n\nThe narrative in this short film did follow Todorov's theory. The equilibrium at the start of the film was a lady commuting late at night on a train. She is sat in the quiet zone of this train which suggests that she needs the quiet either to relax or to focus on her work. The film begins with her looking stressed and tired while she tries to complete her work on the train which confirms her reasoning for sitting in the quiet zone. The lady then gets a text from her boyfriend asking her to have a phone call with him. She quickly responds saying that she is very busy and won't have time to talk. At this point in the film, the disruption occurs which makes the woman very distressed and uncomfortable. There is a man sitting a few seats away whistling a repetitive tune and this obviously distracts and irritates the lady so much that she blurts out; \"for god's sake be quiet!\" The whistling then abruptly stops but the woman continues to get off the train to remove herself from the situation. This makes the atmosphere in the film very uneasy and creepy which is perfect for a horror film. In my film I will be using this technique of having abrupt changes to the scene to add mystery and to maybe prepare for a jump scare if necessary, The man is not longer sat on the seat or anywhere to be seen. When the woman is off the train and she tries to get through the barriers, they start flashing and saying 'seek assistance'. In this scene there is no other people around except a woman in a red coat. The isolation is key in this film because it provokes fear in the protagonist and therefore the audience will feel this fear too. After scrambling under the barrier and encountering the whistling man in a dreadful experience, the woman wakes up back on the train. This is very clever because it is as if the situation never happened but the woman now has paranoia and scepticism as to what could happen to her. I like the idea of having the protagonist feel paranoia or distress because it then puts these emotions on the audience as well. The new equilibrium is formed when the woman calls 999 and sees the man's reflection in her phone and then at the end when the relfection is on the train window and the whistling sound is heard for the final time.\n\nCharacter Development\n\nThere are 3 characters (1 more mentioned) in this short film and they each fit into one of the roles specified in Propp's Theory. I have decided that the man in the film is obviously the villain because he is the one that wants to hurt people and mess with their thoughts. The way he is portrayed makes him look very creepy and almost not human. He is bald and veins are visible on his head. He has hollowed eyes and his mouth was turned up into a smile when he was first on-screen. This automatically makes him a creepy character because he is starting at the woman smiling and whistling. He makes the lady very distressed and uncomfortable and he does not look like a normal commuter on a train. In my production, the villain is not going to be as obvious as this one, but this has helped me to understand more about making my character types easily identifiable for the audience. I decided that the woman fits into the role of the princess, because she is in desperate need of saving but she doesn't actually get saved in this instance. Arguably, the hero in this production could potentially be her boyfriend Adam. He is mentioned in the production as the woman calls out his name when she needs help. Although Adam isn't seen, he is the first person that she thinks of to come and save her so therefore, I think that he could be the potential hero in this production. There is a woman wearing a red coat in this production and I couldn't decide what character from Propp's Theory that she fit into. In my opinion, this woman acted as a warning to the protagonist that the villain was near. She was wearing red which does symbolise danger so I deducted from this that she represents a warning sign because whenever the protagonist came into contact with the man, the woman would be seen a few seconds before.\n\nLighting\n\nIn this production the lighting on the train juxtaposes the lighting in the dream sequence. I think that the tense scenes happen mainly in the dark which is a good point to pick up on for my production. I like the idea to film in low lit scenes because I think that they increase the fear factor of the scene and make it a lot more scary. I will be keeping this in mind for my own production and how I can use dark lighting to create a more intense atmosphere.\n\nCamera Movement\n\nSimilarly to other productions that I have watched, the camerawork in this short film is minimalistic until the main disruption happens, at which point, the camera movement becomes more erratic. I think that the shots in this production, linger for a while to build up the tension and help to engage the audience. The shots that linger are the ones that create the most anticipation because the audience are waiting for something scary to happen.\n\nSound\n\nThere are some uses of sound in this film that I really like because they have been used really cleverly. The whistling is a key sound in this film because it links in with scaring the audience quite significantly. At first, the noise is portrayed as an annoyance because the man who is whistling is in the quiet zone and the whistling annoys the woman on the train who is commuting. The sound paired with the mans hand swaying creates a very strange and surreal situation. When the protagonist gets off the train, the barriers start flashing and beeping which heightens the intensity of the scene. From watching this film, I have gained a better understanding of how sound is used in productions to create an unsettling scenario. ​\n\nTarget Audience\n\nI really think that this production is suited to my target audience, because at 15-25, travelling alone becomes a new and intriguing thing for this age group. I believe that this age group are fearful of situations that they they are not too familiar with. This film is suited to my target audience because it uses their fears and innocence to scare them. The lack of expectation of a situation such as travelling alone, gives the filmmaker space to play with the audience's emotions and senses. Horror films are usually most effective when someone's biggest fear is portrayed to them. For example, if someone was terrified of travelling alone, this film would scare them more than a regular commuter who experiences travel everyday.\n\nI heard it too\n\nNarrative\n\nIn this piece, the narrative is very engaging because the audience feel the same fear that the girl and her mother are feeling. The lighting and camerawork combined with the sound, are the main elements that create the tension and the fear in this short film. This film follows Todorov's narrative theory because there is an equilibrium, disruption and then a final new equilibrium. The beginning equilibrium in this film is the most positive one that I have seen because it shows a loving mother singing to her child before she goes to sleep. The idea of having an absent father is mentioned which links into the other narratives that I have looked at where the characters start with a mediocre lifestyle. I think that this happy type start to this short film is good because it allows the audience to trust the mother in the film and see what sort of character that she is.\n\nCharacter Development\n\nThere are 3 characters in this film and they do fit into one of the 7 character profiles specified by Propp's character theory. I decided to put the character of the little girl's mother as the helper character because she helped the little girl to avoid the villain. I would say that the little girl fits into the role of the princess because she is the vulnerable character in this piece. The character of the villain is obviously the character that is revealed at the end of the short film.\n\nLighting\n\nThe use of darkness opposed to lighting in this production is very effective and helps to tell the story. Children are stereotypically more cautious when it comes to being in the dark, so it fits into the theme of the story very successfully. The film is shot mostly in the darkness of the family house. I do like the effect that it gives to the film because it makes it more eerie, especially because it is in a normal family home and the target audience will most likely be able to relate to this fear of the dark. Lighting is an element that I am looking closer at for my production, because I think that low lit scenes are the most effective in the horror genre. The use of lighting to create shadows is successful in this film because it helps to create more tension and fear. It makes the audience think that something or someone is in the house with the characters and that it is trying to hide.\n\nCamera Movement\n\nThe camera movement in this piece is typical of a horror film and the way the shots are filmed from behind walls suggests to the audience that the characters are hiding from something. I like the section in this film where the mother and daughter are hiding in a wardrobe away from the intruder because the camera movement really accentuates this scene and it adds aesthetic appeal.\n\nHow have these films helped me to plan for my own production?\n\nAfter looking at these productions, I have learnt more about shot composition and how everything in a shot contributes to the aesthetic and the meaning of the production. I have looked into 4 productions that have opened my eyes to different techniques that are used in horror films. I have looked into productions that are relevant to my genre and that also have themes that will be present in my short film too. I thought that analysing productions that contain similarities to my film would be more beneficial, because I have gained inspiration from them and learnt a lot from the way they have been edited and shot. These films have helped me to think about my own production, because I have been able to analyse each element from the films in detail and reflect on what I like about them. I have noticed a lot of key conventions that are used in horror films\n\nMy Practice Shoot section\n\nMy Practice Film\n\nHow has this practice film helped me to prepare for the final production?\n\nThis practice film has helped me significantly to develop my skills in making short films . Specifically, it has helped me to practice filming with horror genre conventions. I believe that throughout the process of making this practice film, I have been thinking about lighting and camerawork a lot more and thinking about how I can use these elements successfully in the final production. I will be using a variation of still shots and action shots to create different feelings in each of the scenes. I really want the camerawork to represent the way the characters are feeling in each scene and this practice film has helped me with this decision making process. I really enjoyed making the title of this film because it enabled me to learn a new editing technique. This has helped me for the final production because I now know how to generate this title sequence and I will hopefully be able to improve it further when it comes to putting my final film together.\n\nTechnique analysis\n\nI decided that conducting a survey at this stage might help me to reflect on my own practice and enable me to gain feedback and improve for my final piece. I think that surveys are a good way of gaining an opinion from my target audience in order to make my final production more successful. I also think that it will help me to reflect on individual techniques that I have used and it may give me feedback on ways that I can improve elements of my filmmaking. I do want to improve constantly as a filmmaker, and feedback from others will help me to hone in on areas that I need to improve on.\n\nHow will this help my final production?\n\n​This survey has helped me to reflect on my test shoots and what my target audience liked and also what they think I could improve. I think that by sending out a survey, this has helped me to gain more feedback so that I can develop my own skills. I now know that I can improve my production by including jump scares and thinking more about the music and sound. I will be looking on Sound stripe for my music because I use this all the time for my projects to get licensed songs. I think that this is a good site because it organises music into genre categories and it is easy to navigate. After completing this survey I have been able to look into the sound that I want to use in my final film and why it would be effective.\n\nThese five screenshots show my colour grading progress throughout creating this technique. When following the tutorial from YouTube, it showed the editor selecting the \"SL BLUE STEEL\" effect from the creative section of the colour grading menu, so I tried this to see how it looked on my footage. I really didn't like how this colour grade looked and therefore, I reverted the colour correction and tried to use the shadow tint instead. I much preferred how this looked on my footage than what the tutorial advised me to use. I am learning more about which colour grades I like and the ones that I don't like as much. I could have just followed this tutorial exactly and used the third screenshot as my final export, however; I felt that using my creative intuition was better and allows me to have more control over the aesthetic of my colour grading.\n\nAdded Technique - 28/03/19\n\nAfter adding in the character of Greta, I added in a scene in my piece where the lights will be turned out and her character will appear staring out of the mirror. I decided that I wanted to practice filming and editing this technique to ensure that I had the skills necessary to add it into my production.\n\nHave I found practicing my techniques helpful for my final production?\n\n​I think that my practical test shoots and practice edits have really helped me to work on techniques that I want to include in my film. I like to practice edits that I want to use in my final production, because I feel more confident with how to set up the camera correctly to make the techniques work. When I filmed the ghost effect, I knew that my camera had to be put on a tripod in order to make the effect successful. I knew this because I watched a tutorial in advance and I had a better understanding of how the technique worked and I knew it wouldn't work if the camera wasn't stable. In order ton make this edit work, I had to make one layer of the footage more transparent than the other and if the background shifted position even slightly, then the layers would overlap and the effect would not work.\n\nI am really glad that I practiced using my 50 mm lens a lot in this section because I have learnt how to focus it and I now know that I will need to check my footage after I have filmed it to ensure that it is in focus. I have been able to look more into aperture, ISO and shutter speed which has helped to improve my understanding a lot more.\n\n​\n\nTypical film conventions\n\nNarrative Theory\n\nFrom my codes and conventions research, I have been able to identify the type of narrative that horror films usually follow. Having watched and analysed 4 short horror productions, I have discovered that they all followed Todorov's narrative theory. All the films started with an equilibrium where the life of the character was mediocre and not really much happened for them. The films generally then contained a disruption where things changed and became worse. This disruption then generally led onto the new equilibrium and the character would be faced with a situation that was even worse than the one they started in. I do think that my film will definitely follow this same narrative structure as the films that I have analysed.\n\nHow does this link with productions I have watched?\n\nTodorov's Theory is a model that I have been referring to throughout my codes and conventions research and it has helped me to focus more on narrative structure and the different ways that stories are told. I think that this model is really useful to refer to when analysing films because it has helped me to pay more attention to why certain decisions may have been made. For example, in the film \"The Quiet Zone\", the disruption stage was when the woman notices the strange man sitting a few seats away from her and whistling a creepy tune. Having the sound of the whistling come in before the woman sees the man, allows the audience to empathise with her irritation because she is sat somewhere that is meant to be quiet. This must have been a key decision for the filmmaker when planning the narrative in the story because it connects the audience to the film more and provokes a different emotion than if the scary man is seen straight away, in which case, the immediate emotion would be fear which is obviously not what they are trying to portray straight away in this scene.\n\nOverall, Todorov's theory has helped me to break down a narrative in a film and look closely at turning points in a story which have helped me to understand when disruption usually occurs in my chosen genre. From these turning points I have been able to analyse character emotion and decide for myself why situations might have occurred due to the way the narrative is structured. In my film therefore, I will be conscious of when the disruption happens and consider the way my audience might feel due to the nature and timing of the disruption. I have a better understanding of the narrative used in films and how linear and non-linear narratives work for different target audiences. In my final production, my narrative will have a linear structure and contain suitable turning points that will hopefully shock and scare my audience. I feel that it is important for\n\nTarget Audience\n\nI have planned my production with my target audience in mind, and taking into consideration the productions that I have been watching, I think that I have formed a suitable narrative. From watching the 4 productions in the codes and conventions section, I have decided that a typical horror film narrative does contain an innocent idea, thing or theme and that innocence is changed into something dark. I am definitely doing this in my production because I do think that it helps to create an uncanny atmosphere and helps to make the film more scary. I have based my film on an old doll museum that I used to visit as a child. I have very happy memories of this place and I feel like making my film contrast with these happy memories, I should be able to make a scary horror film. Throughout looking at Todorov's narrative theory, I have been constantly thinking about how it will fit in with my final production. I think that my film does follow a clear beginning, middle and end and I have already established this.\n\nHow will narrative structure play a part in my final production?\n\nThe narrative structure of my story is important because it determines how the story is told to the audience. I want to have a linear narrative so that my story has a clear beginning, middle and end. I will be having flashback scenes running through the production, but predominantly the film will have a clear storyline that follows the steps of Todorov's narrative theory. My story starts with an equilibrium at the beginning where the doll shop owner is struggling with the business. The disruption will be when he murders the children and the ending will involve Abe becoming a doll himself and having to spend eternity in his own doll shop. I also think that having a clear narrative will help me when it comes to the filming process because I will be able to decide whether I film in sequential order, or if filming in a different order will be more practical.\n\nCharacter Theory\n\nThese character stereotypes are essentially classed as the 7 different types of character that fit into a film. Propp's theory suggests that every character in a film would be stereotypically one of these characters. When I was analysing productions in the codes and conventions section, I looked into these character types and labelled the characters in each film. I found this very interesting because there was usually a clear set of characters in each film except in \"The Quiet Zone\" where I found it challenging to cast the lady wearing red as one of these character types. I concluded that she was most of a warning sign to the audience because of the colours she was wearing and the moments that she appeared in the film. I have decided that character types are important to help the story to flow and to give characters a specific purpose, but sometimes I think that mise en scene can also play a part in who the characters are and what meaning they give to the film.\n\nHARVARD REFERENCE: Bitezise.

Last accessed 28th Feb 2019.\n\n​\n\nCharacter Types in my film\n\nWhilst looking into character types, I have been thinking about the characters that I am going to be using. The protagonist in my short film will be a false hero because the audience are gradually exposed to the deeper parts of his personality which make him seem more evil as the film progresses. The film starts with him being portrayed as a victim because he is in a bad situation at work and there are signs that he has lost his girlfriend too. The girlfriend turns out to be the hero of the film, because she turns him into a doll and therefore stops him from carrying out these evil acts.\n\n22/03/19\n\nAt this point of my planning I made a few changes to my characters and the script because I believed that I could make some further development to my idea. I therefore adapted my character profiles to match my new storyline and to ensure that I had a good understanding of who my characters are going to be in the film and how they impact the storyline.\n\nCharacter Profiles\n\nTarget Audience\n\n​When thinking about character profiles in my film, I have been referring back to the films that I watched in the codes and conventions section of my research. I think that looking into different roles that are commonly present in horror films, is interesting and it has made me think more about which stereotypes are in my film. From creating my character profiles and developing them to fit in with my latest script draft, I am now confident with who my characters are and how I want them to be portrayed in the film. In my film, the three main characters fit into character types that are specified in Propp's theory. I have a false hero, a princess and a villain. I think that these characters will fit into my production really well, and they are similar to the character types that are conventionally found in horror films.\n\nAuditions\n\nHow will character theory help me with my final production?\n\nLooking into character types has helped me to focus on how my characters will behave in the production and what stereotypes they fit into. I have decided that in my production, there will be a villain, princess and a false hero. All of these character types contribute to the story in some way because they have a big effect on the main storyline. This section of my research actually did allow me to develop my idea further and this involved adding a character into my production. I added the role of Greta because she will act as an evil entity that haunts the protagonist. I thought that adding a villain into my piece was a good idea to create a more intense atmosphere for the audience. The role of the princess is to give the false hero a difficult scenario to deal with. She is pushed off the bridge by Abe after they have an argument. Abe actually is the role of the false hero, but at this moment in time the wind chimes are having the dark effect on him which makes him react in this way. I think that these character types fit these characters very well and they allow them to fulfil their purpose in the film. Overall this section of research has been very helpful because it has allowed me to involve a new character and helped me to make a more developed storyline alongside this.\n\nLocation Research\n\nFor this final project, I will be filming the majority of my production in Somerset. I feel that the locations there are very aesthetically pleasing and suited to my production. I have found a variation of locations that I really like and they could be the potential locations for my final film. I will be looking at the pros and cons of each location and finally deciding on the locations that I want to use. I will be taking into consideration the storyline and which places would fit nicely into the script. I want these locations all to match each other and look like they are shot in the same village or close by, so I need to consider whether they look rural and match up when the characters are walking from location to location in the edit. ​\n\nThe beginning scene of my production is set in the past and therefore I will be using an old fashioned style little girls room. The purpose of this scene is to show that dolls are innocent for children and playing with them aids their development. In this scene my aim was also to show that the dolls in the museum have been there for many years and they come from all over the country and the world.\n\nThese three locations are the potential places for me to film my scary scenes in my production. This mise en scene of this location needs to be isolated so that it fits in with my genre and the desires of the target audience.\n\nThese are the two locations that I am considering to use for the doll museum scenes. I want the doll museum in my film to be in a remote place with not too many people and I also want it to look old fashioned. I also want the location to have a bit of history to it because then it is more likely to resemble the old village feel that I want in my production.\n\nThese are the two rooms that I have to choose from for my first scene. In this location, I really want to encapsulate the idea of being young and innocent because the aim for this scene is to show my target audience that doll's all start off as being a child's play thing but the rest of the film shows what the story behind them could be. This the beginning scene of my film and the first location that will be seen by the audience so it is important to me that I get this right.\n\nRecces\n\nLocation 1\n\nYour browser does not support viewing this document.

I wanted to approach this in a friendly manner so I decided to go in and ask the volunteers if I could film on certain days in the Easter holidays. The museum is open from 11am to 4 pm so this gives me a good amount of time to film and get everything to the standard that I want. I asked them if they would be happy to let me film there at Easter and they were happy to allow me to do this. They did say to just come in and check with the volunteer that it was okay to film on that day. After getting permission from the doll shop to film on any day in the Easter holidays, I could then plan which days were suitable for my actors and myself to film. Due to the fact that all of my actors are coming with me to the location, I know that they will also be happy with filming on any day in the Easter holidays.\n\nScript draft 1\n\nYour browser does not support viewing this document.

One significant change that I made is when I added a character into my production. This was a very good change that I made because it added a deeper element of fear and it made my script more intriguing. I think that my final draft of my script will help me to make a scary film and I am happy with the changes that I have made.\n\nMy Film Poster\n\nActor Agreements\n\nCrew list\n\nYour browser does not support viewing this document.

This really helps me to source good film music and I can always find suitable tracks for my productions. In this section of my planning, I began by looking at the playlist for horror music. This was really interesting because it allowed me to look at a variation of tracks that I could potentially use. It also helped me to consider the type of music that I wanted to use in my production. I have decided that I like the more ambient sounding tracks, but I also like the ones that have sudden jumps in too to add to a scary moment in the film.\n\nFor this project, I have created a playlist with all the tracks that I like and want to include in my film. This is open to change due to the fact that when I edit, I like to fit the visuals with the music and if I think that the visuals aren't matching, I might change the track to make it more atmospheric. I always like to consider the music that I want to use early on, because I feel that it gives me time to visualise my scenes more and it also helps to give me good ideas for the visuals that could be really aesthetic when paired with the right music.\n\nFoley needed\n\nStoryboards"
