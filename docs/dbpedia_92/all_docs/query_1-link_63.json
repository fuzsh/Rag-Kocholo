Like all punk, Desperate Teenage Lovedolls is a weird mixture of anger, trolling, nihilism, and earnest sincerity. As a movement, punk is a form of art rebellion with a long history that predates the 1970s. It’s an eruption of frustration that periodically emerges from the margins of civilization to challenge societal norms and mainstream culture. It’s a loose affiliation of outcasts who find solidarity in their pissed-off rejection of almost everything."
