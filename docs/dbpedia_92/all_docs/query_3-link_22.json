When the whole world has gone PINK, and that word — BARBIE — is on everyone’s lips — you’ve gotta get with the program and suck it up, right? Doesn’t matter how cynical you are, doesn’t matter that you’ve never owned a Barbie in your life, nor that you were ever offered one as a kid, ever — that doesn’t matter; NOT when the powers of global marketing are telling us that BARBIE is awesome and will save the world. Perhaps she is, and perhaps she will! More on that later.\n\nFor now, let’s spend a few minutes trying to understand the ultra-marketing at play in getting people to buy this pretty piece of plastic. We want to get into the psyches of the multi-millions who adore her."
