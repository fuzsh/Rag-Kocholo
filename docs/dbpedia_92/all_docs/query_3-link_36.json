        "text": "bc moon raven Oct 2018\n\nGrowling and hissing, a storm formed along the road, portending the merging of the chaos that had been gripping our minds for months. This day, this type of day, we could have dreamed up in the novel of our love affair. The conversation along our drive into the country was as full and ***** as all other tête-à-têtes shared in our two months together. We were never at a loss for words and his conversation had been more educated than the older men I had dated since the divorce. I was forever astonished at him and with him.\n\nThe first time I met him, I was sitting behind my desk and planning for another monotonous day of office politics and all the drama connected. Lost in thought, I sipped coffee and read emails until, there was - him. He opened my office door with such fervor and drama, I knew someone had just entered into my life that would leave me forever changed, and I welcomed it. A mess of auburn hair, neither combed nor styled and yet quite fitting, haloed around his head and gave the visage of an angel. He had a freckled nose and cheeks with blue eyes staring from behind all that wildness and they were the only calming feature about him. I turned my head and grimaced a bit, “how dare someone charge into my office as if to own it”. “How can I help you?” made its way from my lips with a bit of a sigh. And he smiled, that smile which would make his face even younger and more deceptively angelic.\n\n“Hello” danced off his lips and in two syllables was able to sound singsong and my anger soon turned to anticipation. He introduced himself as Parker and explained his new position as Junior Editor. He went on to say someone instructed him to introduce himself to me since I was Senior Project Manager for the organization. His fervent entrance into my office had sent a gush of wind that disheveled my tidy desk and his wide blue eyes looked around at the chaos he had rendered. He seemed unable to offer apologies, and I soon learned this was his way. His confident facade prevented admission of mistakes and the word “sorry” could not escape the tightness of his will to be correct. This was my lover’s way and it was the structure built that only wrecking ***** could destroy.\n\nAs is expected of me, I extended my hand to welcome him, overmuch aware of my grip and strength in presenting my hand, I felt the need to dominate the grip. I was a woman in a senior position inside the male dominated echelon of upper management. I took his hand and with rehearsed quickness attempted to demonstrate my dominance, my superiority. It was then, the first time I saw a devil behind his angelic face and I remember my expression churned up my secret thoughts. He saw my eyes searching those thoughts and delight shone from his blue eyes like cold fire and I was burned. Our hands soon contorted into a dance of dominance with fingers twisting as if in a finger shadow play. No time for games or plays for control, I simply took the shake he offered and turned towards my coffee, my drama, my emails and without looking at him welcomed him again and gave a wave of dismissal. He greeted my brush-off with a laugh and made his way to the chair in front of my desk. He was tall and the light from behind silhouetted his broad shoulders and upright posture. He was confident and sure. His clothes were expensive, well-tailored and not at all the measure for his age. He had a style about him and I believe it came as naturally to him as did the confidence in which he clothed himself.\n\nI wanted to be angry at his overconfidence, his interruption, his disregard. I was, instead, amused but annoyed. He sensed he was beginning to irritate me and it seemed to delight him. He would speak without taking a breath, eager to finish his thoughts, aware perhaps that time could steal the moment away and he would forever wonder. He spoke with an accent I did not fully recognize and attempted to invite me to lunch or even coffee. My lover was bold.\n\nI was succeeding in this corporate world, my world. I was not ready to lose my focus for a moment alone with the delightful creature staring back at me, awaiting the “yes” he expected would be my answer. He was a man who did not accept the “no’s”. He would get what he wanted and would wait in predator mode until his prey was wounded, weak, ready. He was not a predator in the malevolent sense, more in the need for survival mentality. He would lift the wounded and weak above the limits of their afflictions and a “yes” would flow from their lips in fond gratitude. Today I was not a “yes” and it did not feel like a final answer. Somehow, I knew one day I would be naked with this man, my lover. I knew I would take him inside me, and he would show me how to love in ways I had never known. The “no’ and the explanations of the “no” exuded from my lips, and I could see him grow even more eager to know me. He would learn the stories of my life from rumors and talk. He would learn of my divorce, of the men I dated with expensive homes and cars. He would hear about the occasional woman who would occupy my bed. I had wished all of it to be true but only the divorce was correct. I was not exceptional or exciting. I was driven and focused.\n\nHe stood there hearing my “no” with the sun behind him igniting the fire in his hair with his shoulders pinned back exposing his sculpted chest. He stood there and allowed the silence after my rejection to hover the room, and there it was. We locked eyes, and neither could emancipate from the other. I wondered who he was and what he looked like naked in the morning with his disheveled hair, and we stared, locked in our gaze until my phone rang signaling the end of round one.\n\nWrapped in my shawl, I moved between sipping coffee, as was my usual, and typing on my laptop. He was behind me in the cabin. I felt him approaching and knew he would quickly whisk me away from the overwhelming din of office emails and calls. His presence behind me now was no longer disquieting but natural.\n\nThe cabin had been his grandfathers and he had a noticeable pride about it when showing me through the door and gateway to his childhood memories. He had a smile on his face I had never seen. I delighted in how young it made his face appear, almost as if the childhood memories possessed him and he became the blithe youth here with his grandfather.\n\nIt was fall at the cabin and the smell of musk and rotting leaves and ozone from the storm, filled the cabin and each deep breath was taking in a memory from my youth. I was happy to be here with him and yet afraid. Two months we flirted and touched over our shared lunches, eager to get inside each other physically, mentally. The office was replete with stories of the happenings between the older woman executive and the younger up and coming man, how he must be using her to advance his career and how she was using him to heal the wounds of her recent divorce. We heard these stories and watched them grow to the point we ended our touching, our flirting. Soon the denial of our feelings and time apart turned to foreplay. Soon there were stares across conference rooms, perceptive smiles as we crossed paths. The total of it led us to this moment, to time alone together for the first time, this time.\n\nFall in the country was the vangaurd to a glorious death. The earth would explode with color announcing its final breath and moment upon the stage and we had arrived during the final bow and curtain call. Trees draped in gold - and red - and orange heralded the fire to come and we too were ready to pour forth in glorious blaze and inferno. During the entire ride into the country an ironical mist of dew and rain dotted the windshield as if nature attempted to douse the desires clawing to escape in each other’s arms. There was a devil sitting next to me and I had to smile as his auburn hair blended so naturally with the landscape. I was obviously lost in thought and he looked at me and asked if I was okay. Him next to me, him crookedly smiling at me.\n\n“It’s nothing. It’s just nice to see you in your element.” My replay was short but my heart was beating so hard I was almost afraid he could see it bouncing behind my blouse, so I began to cover up but was met with his hand before I even reached the edge of my coat.\n\n“No. I want to see you.” His voice was soft but demanding and strong. Often there were hints of a struggle for power between us. His youth and position within the company prevented me from accepting his seriousness and his face would ***** into a grimace. I never gave it much thought other than a bit of a nuisance. His hand led mine to my lap, and I expected him to hold it, but he let go with a smile. I enjoyed his show of power but refused to reveal a glint of it for fear I would lose the respect and control necessary over a subordinate.\n\nSoon the cabin filled with the sounds of rain and thunder and as I stared out the window jealous of the drops of rain and their randomness, he touched my shoulder and looked down at me with his eyes bluer than wild lupine. I smiled a painful smile and he knew I was overthinking the moment. Taking my hand, he brought me to his chest and into his arms, arms that would embrace all of me and at times felt as if they could wrap around me twice. I placed my head on his chest and began to reach for his belt. The *** I had known was always routine. This was expected, that was not allowed. I fell into that routine naturally and was happy to oblige his needs in order to meet mine. He kissed my forehead and still holding one hand, led me to the door of the cabin. “What are we do…” He stopped me with a single “shhh” from his lips. I followed him and felt myself shiver. I was not sure if I was shivering in fear or from the nip of fall air.\n\n“Don’t be afraid. You have nothing to fear from me. There’s no need to shiver my little poppet.” He stepped back from me and stared as if I were a tiny bird in need of nestling back into its home. “I’ve never seen you afraid.” He touched my cheek and I felt so small and helpless, lost from home, and he was the only way back. With a smile he took my hand and led me outside to the rain, lifting his face and savoring the drops bouncing off his cheeks.\n\n“W..w..what are you doing?” I was trembling now and wondered if I had misjudged this man and he was in fact a lunatic ready to strangle me to my death. My silk blouse, now drenched, clung to my ******* exposing an imprint of lace from my bra. He reached for my shawl and pulled it off my shoulders. He was looking at me so lovingly my body and mind calmed and I was once again in the moment. Our moment. This moment.\n\nHis face, stern now, official, his mouth opening with such deliberateness that I was sure he had been in this situation before. Once again my mind wanted to race to thoughts of not being good enough or that I was too old or too plain. His voice pierced my thoughts and brought me to attention. “There will be no talking unless I tell you to. Nod if you understand”\n\nMy mind wanted to slap him with reminders of my superiority to him at work, how he was MY subordinate and how dare he. My mouth would not open and my head began to nod in understanding. My body and mind were bending to his will and acting upon his orders. Shivering gave way to shaking now and I wanted to run to the warmth of the cabin and watch the fire burn the logs to a black crisp and wake up in his arms naked and giggling.\n\nHaving seen my compliant nod, he began to speak. “Undress.” One word. One word in response to the shaking mess of a woman standing in the rain, cold and afraid. My hands were barely able to form the necessary movements to reach for the top button of my blouse. I did not want to fail him or appear as if I were unfamiliar with tales of ***** men overpowering and having their way with a willing lover. My fingers moved quickly now, wanting to end the scene and move on to the *******. He stared. He did not blink. He did not nod or move. He was enjoying every subtlety of me. He was pleased. I was a willing participant in his fantasy. Nothing made me happier than to please him. I began to feel hot and something inside me broke. Was it my will, my pride, my fears? I was not sure, but I felt alive. Every thirsty pore of my skin opened up and lapped at the rain so very eager to feel it on my skin and the randomness of the drops was no longer something I envied but something in which I participated.\n\nMy hands began to tug my blouse free from my skirt and the wet silk now draped over my hips like curtains, revealing the curves I was so painfully aware of hiding to keep anyone from noticing my *** and concentrate upon my words and actions. I knew now I had one button remaining before I would, for the first time, display myself to him. He did not flinch, rather, he maintained his stare and for a second I pleaded to him with my eyes not to expect me to do this. He was resolute. I spread open the soft, wet cloth and began to drape it off my shoulders. I let it slide from my wrists, then fingertips, then to the ground blissfully unconcerned that my Hermes blouse was now draped over wet grass and mud.\n\nI looked down at my skin dripping and alive with goosebumps. I had bought this bra in anticipation of this moment, in fear of this moment. White lace bra and perfectly matched ******* were demonstrative of my control over even the small details. My skirt was loose and heavy with the rain. It was low on my waist and lay just below the navel leaving me the most exposed I had ever been with him. I reached to touch the button on the back of my skirt. Undone, I slipped my fingers along with the zipper feeling each click of the tiny teeth holding together the disguise of a powerful woman. My hands traced the banded edge of the skirt pushing it over my hips allowing it to fall to the ground.\n\nHis face looked stern but pleased, stoic and fixed. I was in my bra, ******* and stilettos now. I began to reach for the hinged part of my bra when he stopped me. “No. Stop.” He walked over to me. He was close now and I was so cold I could feel heat from his body. I wanted to kiss his lips, his full lips, but I did not move. I knew now the rules and I would do only what was asked of me. I stood rigid with no flinching. I waited for any words that would pass from lips to ear. He did not speak but leaned into me and reached over my right shoulder undoing the chignon in my hair. He draped my shoulders with strands of liquid filament. He took his time there, placing each strand in the exact order in which he was pleased. With two steps back, he looked at my wet hair with the deliberate strands, as if he had created a masterpiece and for a moment I was unsure if the artwork he saw was me or his work.\n\n“Now be still. Allow me to touch you, to admire you, my beautiful Moira.” When he said my name even after these two months, he had the ability of saying it as if he were speaking it in serenade and for the first time. He moved his hands to my back and unlinked my bra, one hook at a time with such dexterity I knew he must be a professional at *******. He, who was to be my first professional lover. He slid both straps off my shoulders, then taking my hands towards my abdomen, he slid the straps forward on my arms. Lifting my hands, he demanded I keep them out and straight. Me, the student to the professional, complied without question. He bound my wrists with the lace bra, the bra I had bought just to please him, then lifted my arms above my head. “You will keep your hands up until I tell you to move.”\n\nI had become his toy. I knew in this moment, I no longer existed for me, I was his, completely and entirely, and I abandoned myself to the rain, to the cold, to his gaze, realizing that surrendering to his urges strengthened me. He turned and walked away. He took a seat in an Adirondack chair and even it looked small in his presence. “On your elbows and knees,” he spoke matter-of-factly. Just five minutes ago, the struggle inside me to have the appearance of strength, would have denied me this happiness, this happiness to be free in his command. “Now crawl to me, please. Slowly.”\n\nI did not care to be in the mud. I wanted it. I wanted to please him. First to my knees, leaving an indention in the clay, then awkwardly at first, onto my elbows with my hands still tied at the wrist. Crawling on my elbows, my back was arched with my waist higher than my head, giving him a view of the thong I had chosen only for this moment, my succeeding moment. My position felt ungainly. I looked to his face for approval. “No. You cannot look at me”, he commanded. For a moment I felt I had lost his approval and self-doubt harried my brain. My will to please was resolute. I faced the ground, once again aware of the randomness of nature, the power of nature, how things in nature will do as they are told. The reed is told to bend. It does. It does not question why but responds in its way. Rivers do not question why they are shaped. They just continue with powerful current. I was the reed. I was the river. I did not question.\n\nFace towards the ground, I could see the mud forming on my body, molding to my shape then rinsing with the rain. It repeated. Mud. Rain. Mud. Rain. This was the cadence to my crawl. I arrived at his knees and waited there, a dog eager for a command from its master. I was content to watch the rain beat ripples around his feet, splashing and shining his shoes with glossy drops. “I cannot love you”, I thought to myself, “this is forbidden”. “Being here in this moment, is forbidden.” We would have this moment. Yes. We could create this memory and think back on it in fondness and with both heaviness and happiness. I would remember my young lover, my professional lover. He would remember the obedient executive on her knees. I would not regret our moment. I would some day write it all down in my journal and press the pen deep into the paper. It had to be etched, those words, my words, this memory.\n\nHis hand below my chin, lifted my gaze to his and he smiled, that smile, his smile, the smile that was like nature to my body, and I did not ask why. I was a river being formed. “You are so beautiful. All of you. Your skin so soft and pale. Your eyes moving from fear to acceptance. I see now you want to please me and I want you to know that I want to make you happy. I want to be your lover. I want to taste your lips kissed with rain and feel your shivering body pulled against me. You are safe. I will not hurt you. Poppet. I love you. I have for awhile now, and I think you know it. You, my wise, wise Moira.” He lifted me up and for a moment pulled my body towards him burying his face in my abdomen. He lingered there. I felt how soft his red tufts of hair were and how soft his words were against my ears. I loved him too. Genuinely. Profoundly. I was afraid.\n\nHe inhaled deeply, there against my stomach, as if he were breathing in my essence. I felt his breath turn from warm to cold against me as it mixed with rain. He stretched his arms and moved my body backwards as he extended until I was a foot away from him. “I would very much like to undress you, poppet. I’ve been imagining it, aching for it. I want to see all of you, naked and on display.” He touched my abdomen with the tips of his fingers, as if afraid the pale china of my skin would disintegrate into a misty dream. I relished it, the touch of him against parts of me he had not known. I was always able to keep him at a distance, physically. His hands traced the edge of my *******. He moved slowly, and I knew he was wanting to etch this memory into his journal. Nothing less than ink pressed hard to paper would release this memory to time. His placed his hands on my hips and spun me around, my thong lining up with his gaze. “Bend over.” His voice from sweet to demanding again.\n\nMy hands were still bound, and I stumbled at first. He seemed not to notice or to care, so I arched my back and pushed myself outward and into his view. I felt his hands move from my thighs to my hips as gentle as summer winds that in their seductiveness turn our faces towards the impact. I was in my forties and unsure how I would compare to the twenty-year-old’s he was known to date. The gossip left nothing to imagination and everything to speculation. My mind had conjured images of him, this professional lover, inside the firm thighs of a youthful companion. Thoughts transformed to pleasure as the nature that was his hands took dominance over the thin lace that hid the only piece of me left unseen. I became art in his hands, marble statue, exquisite with textures and curves wanting to be touched.\n\nThe lace scraped my skin as he slid the *******, wet and splashed with earth, over the expanse of my hips and down to the ground at my ankles. “Step out of them.” He helped free my ankles, and I saw the delicate lace become one with the earth as the rain beat it into the mud. This was freedom. This was me with nature, me with my lover. I was the reed and he was the wind.\n\nI was keenly aware of his eyes fixated on the valley of my mound, how my cheeks spread just enough to give hints of the pinkest of my flesh, now swollen and ripe. “Turn around.” I heard his voice and could tell the bombardment of rain was making it difficult to speak.\n\nI turned and began to ***** my body when I felt his hand on my back. “No, poppet. You must stay this way until I say stand.” My body ached to be touched by him, by more than fingers and hands, but this, the anticipation, the wanting of it all, this was the skill of a professional lover. I saw the earth drowned with a thick layer of rain now, and my shoes made splatters and ripples as I turned towards him. I was cold now, too cold, unaware cold, numb in my cold. I was happy to feel it. I had for too long hid from rain, this glorious rain. Now, I was one with the rain. I was the river coursing its path as commanded by nature.\n\nHe took my hands and untied them. I watched the entire progression of it and I felt his presence now even more. My hands were free, and I stared at my shoes and his shoes. I was so small in his presence. “Stand for me, poppet.” His voice diffused through the rain and seemed softer now. I stood there in my nakedness and he delighted in it. My lover was not afraid and moved his head along with his eyes. It was easy to know where upon my body his gaze had landed. He seemed to linger the most on my face, and I thought how odd it was as most men concentrated on my ******* or mound. My lover was different. My lover was professional.\n\n“Poppet, I want you to remove my shirt, but you will not toss it to the ground. You will place it on the chair. Nod if you understand me.” He knew I understood but was confirming I was still in the moment and willing. I obliged him with a nod and without looking at his face, began to unbutton each dot from its hole until he was shirtless before me. His chest was firm and hairless and dotted with unobtrusive freckles as random as the rain. I was delighted. He was beautiful. My lover was beautiful.\n\nHe placed one hand on my head, the other on my shoulder. “On your knees for me, poppet.” My knees once again bent for him, and I knelt in the rain, the thick rain and saw my knees again molded in the mud and earth. I was unsure now. Years had passed since I had taken a man inside my mouth. I felt panic, like the river, run a course through me and I started to turn away. But I was resolute. “I will make him happy in all things this day” rang in my ears like a mantra. I watched as he undid his belt and felt it as he wrapped it around my neck two times and pulled the loose end until it was taut but not constricted against my skin. I was his. I was the pet and he was the master. It was official to me now in this symbol. I was leashed and about to be tamed. My lover was going to teach me his skill. I was delighted.\n\nI watched him free the one button on his pants and move to the patterned teeth of the zipper. He rested his pants on his hips and pulled free the thing, that thing, the thing I was craving. The thing I would take inside me, deep inside wherever my master wanted it. I was the river.\n\nHe was not large, not small, but thick, surprisingly thick, he was swollen and vascular. I studied the curve of it. The tip, the head. I watched his hand grip it and move it towards my lips. I opened my mouth and took him inside me. He moved his hands to the sides of my head and began to direct me in the movement he needed from me. I studied the thrusts and followed. I moved my tongue, my eager tongue, in unison with the rain and percussion of the drops. I slid him deep inside me devouring and savoring the taste of him. The taste of my lover was satisfying, and I wanted to bring him to completion there in that moment.\n\nWe stayed in the rhythm, with the rain, both lost to the moment. He stopped his ****** and lifted my chin. “Moira. My poppet.” He led me to my feet and gave his crooked smile to me. He gave me his smile in that moment, in that second, his smile was mine.\n\n“I love you”, I whispered, unsure he heard me. He lifted me like a child and carried my nakedness to the bed. He placed me there, like a doll. He contemplated my skin in the light of the fire. My lover the wind. My lover the water.\n\nHe was soon naked and drops of rain lit up on his body like little mirrors and I could see images of the room and myself reflected in them. He removed the belt from my neck. “We won’t need this. In this moment, you know you are mine. You know I am yours.” We both wrapped our arms around the other, and I felt his skin on mine. His body was hard and moved in perfect form with each muscle flinching the way it should, each squeeze and release in harmony with the other. My pale, soft skin was beautiful contrast to his and was yin and yang. He felt hard and long inside me, so engorged each vein touched the inside of me in a different fashion. We each sealed our mouth on the other unable to drink as deeply as we wanted. We were in our moment, this moment. Alive in the seconds that passed to hours. We were ready to etch ink on the pages telling of how I was the reed and he was the wind and on this day, I did not ask why, I only did as was I was told.\n\nMichael R Burch Sep 2020\n\nSonnets\n\nFor this collection I have used the original definition of \"sonnet\" as a \"little song\" rather than sticking to rigid formulas. The sonnets here include traditional sonnets, tetrameter sonnets, hexameter sonnets, curtal sonnets, 15-line sonnets, and some that probably defy categorization, which I call free verse sonnets for want of a better term. Most of these sonnets employ meter, rhyme and form and tend to be Romantic in the spirit of the Romanticism of Blake, Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth and Dylan Thomas.\n\nAuschwitz Rose\n\nby Michael R.

Burch\n\nWhatever winds encountered soon resolved\n\nto swirling fragments, till chaotic heaps\n\nof leaves lay pulsing by the backyard wall.\n\nIn lieu of rakes, our fingers sorted each\n\ndry leaf into its place and built a high,\n\nsoft bastion against earth's gravitron―\n\na patchwork quilt, a trampoline, a bright\n\nimpediment to fling ourselves upon.\n\nAnd nothing in our laughter as we fell\n\ninto those leaves was like the autumn's cry\n\nof also falling. Nothing meant to die\n\ncould be so bright as we, so colorful―\n\nclad in our plaids, oblivious to pain\n\nwe'd feel today, should we leaf-fall again.\n\nOriginally published by The Neovictorian/Cochlea\n\nIsolde's Song\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThrough our long years of dreaming to be one\n\nwe grew toward an enigmatic light\n\nthat gently warmed our tendrils. Was it sun?\n\nWe had no eyes to tell; we loved despite\n\nthe lack of all sensation―all but one:\n\nwe felt the night's deep chill, the air so bright\n\nat dawn we quivered limply, overcome.\n\nTo touch was all we knew, and how to bask.\n\nWe knew to touch; we grew to touch; we felt\n\nspring's urgency, midsummer's heat, fall's lash,\n\nwild winter's ice and thaw and fervent melt.\n\nWe felt returning light and could not ask\n\nits meaning, or if something was withheld\n\nmore glorious. To touch seemed life's great task.\n\nAt last the petal of me learned: unfold.\n\nAnd you were there, surrounding me. We touched.\n\nThe curious golden pollens! Ah, we touched,\n\nand learned to cling and, finally, to hold.\n\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review\n\nSee\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSee how her hair has thinned: it doesn't seem\n\nlike hair at all, but like the airy moult\n\nof emus who outraced the wind and left\n\nsoft plumage in their wake. See how her eyes\n\nare gentler now; see how each wrinkle laughs,\n\nand deepens on itself, as though mirth took\n\nsome comfort there and burrowed deeply in,\n\noutlasting winter. See how very thin\n\nher features are―that time has made more spare,\n\nso that each bone shows, elegant and rare.\n\nFor loveliness remains in her grave eyes,\n\nand courage in her still-delighted looks:\n\neach face presented like a picture book's.\n\nBemused, she blows us undismayed goodbyes.\n\nOriginally published by Writer's Digest's: The Year's Best Writing 2003\n\nIn the Whispering Night\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor George King\n\nIn the whispering night, when the stars bend low\n\ntill the hills ignite to a shining flame,\n\nwhen a shower of meteors streaks the sky,\n\nand the lilies sigh in their beds, for shame,\n\nwe must steal our souls, as they once were stolen,\n\nand gather our vigor, and all our intent.\n\nWe must heave our bodies to some violent ocean\n\nand laugh as they shatter, and never repent.\n\nWe must dance in the darkness as stars dance before us,\n\nsoar, Soar! through the night on a butterfly's breeze:\n\nblown high, upward-yearning, twin spirits returning\n\nto the world of resplendence from which we were seized.\n\nPublished in Songs of Innocence, Romantics Quarterly and Poetry Life & Times. This is a sonnet I wrote for my favorite college English teacher, George King, about poetic kinship, brotherhood and romantic flights of fancy.\n\nThe Toast\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nFor longings warmed by tepid suns\n\n(brief lusts that animated clay),\n\nfor passions wilted at the bud\n\nand skies grown desolate and gray,\n\nfor stars that fell from tinseled heights\n\nand mountains bleak and scarred and lone,\n\nfor seas reflecting distant suns\n\nand weeds that thrive where seeds were sown,\n\nfor waltzes ending in a hush,\n\nfor rhymes that fade as pages close,\n\nfor flames' exhausted, drifting ash,\n\nand petals falling from the rose, ...\n\nI raise my cup before I drink,\n\nsaluting ghosts of loves long dead,\n\nand silently propose a toast―\n\nto joys set free, and those I fled.\n\nSecond Sight (II)\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n(Newborns see best at a distance of 8 to 14 inches.)\n\nWiser than we know, the newborn screams,\n\nred-faced from breath, and wonders what life means\n\nthis close to death, amid the arctic glare\n\nof warmthless lights above.\n\nBeware! Beware!―\n\nencrypted signals, codes? Or ciphers, noughts?\n\nInterpretless, almost, as his own thoughts―\n\nthe brilliant lights, the brilliant lights exist.\n\nIntruding faces ogle, gape, insist―\n\nthis madness, this soft-hissing breath, makes sense.\n\nWhy can he not float on, in dark suspense,\n\nand dream of life? Why did they rip him out?\n\nHe frowns at them―small gnomish frowns, all doubt―\n\nand with an ancient mien, O sorrowful!,\n\nre-closes eyes that saw in darkness null\n\necstatic sights, exceeding beautiful.\n\nArchaischer Torso Apollos (“Archaic Torso of Apollo”)\n\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWe cannot know the beheaded god\n\nnor his eyes' forfeited visions. But still\n\nthe figure's trunk glows with the strange vitality\n\nof a lamp lit from within, while his composed will\n\nemanates dynamism. Otherwise\n\nthe firmly muscled abdomen could not beguile us,\n\nnor the centering ***** make us smile\n\nat the thought of their generative animus.\n\nOtherwise the stone might seem deficient,\n\nunworthy of the broad shoulders, of the groin\n\nprojecting procreation's triangular spearhead upwards,\n\nunworthy of the living impulse blazing wildly within\n\nlike an inchoate star―demanding our belief.\n\nYou must change your life.\n\nTRANSLATOR'S NOTE: This is a Rilke sonnet about a major resolution: changing the very nature of one's life. While it is only my personal interpretation of the poem above, I believe Rilke was saying to himself: \"I must change my life.\" Why? Perhaps because he wanted to be a real artist, and when confronted with real, dynamic, living and breathing art of Rodin, he realized that he had to inject similar vitality, energy and muscularity into his poetry. Michelangelo said that he saw the angel in a block of marble, then freed it. Perhaps Rilke had to find the dynamic image of Apollo, the God of Poetry, in his materials, which were paper, ink and his imagination.―Michael R. Burch\n\nKomm, Du (“Come, You”)\n\nby Ranier Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThis was Rilke’s last poem, written ten days before his death. He died open-eyed in the arms of his doctor on December 29, 1926, in the Valmont Sanatorium, of leukemia and its complications. I had a friend who died of leukemia and he was burning up with fever in the end. I believe that is what Rilke was describing here: he was literally burning alive.\n\nCome, you―the last one I acknowledge; return―\n\nincurable pain searing this physical mesh.\n\nAs I burned in the spirit once, so now I burn\n\nwith you; meanwhile, you consume my flesh.\n\nThis wood that long resisted your embrace\n\nnow nourishes you; I surrender to your fury\n\nas my gentleness mutates to hellish rage―\n\nuncaged, wild, primal, mindless, outré.\n\nCompletely free, no longer future’s pawn,\n\nI clambered up this crazy pyre of pain,\n\ncertain I’d never return―my heart’s reserves gone―\n\nto become death’s nameless victim, purged by flame.\n\nNow all I ever was must be denied.\n\nI left my memories of my past elsewhere.\n\nThat life―my former life―remains outside.\n\nInside, I’m lost. Nobody knows me here.\n\nDer Panther (\"The Panther\")\n\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nHis weary vision's so overwhelmed by iron bars,\n\nhis exhausted eyes see only blank Oblivion.\n\nHis world is not our world. It has no stars.\n\nNo light. Ten thousand bars. Nothing beyond.\n\nLithe, swinging with a rhythmic easy stride,\n\nhe circles, his small orbit tightening,\n\nan electron losing power. Paralyzed,\n\nsoon regal Will stands stunned, an abject thing.\n\nOnly at times the pupils' curtains rise\n\nsilently, and then an image enters,\n\ndescends through arrested shoulders, plunges, centers\n\nsomewhere within his empty heart, and dies.\n\nLiebes-Lied (“Love Song”)\n\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nHow can I withhold my soul so that it doesn’t touch yours?\n\nHow can I lift mine gently to higher things, alone?\n\nOh, I would gladly find something lost in the dark\n\nin that inert space that fails to resonate until you vibrate.\n\nThere everything that moves us, draws us together like a bow\n\nenticing two taut strings to sing together with a simultaneous voice.\n\nWhose instrument are we becoming together?\n\nWhose, the hands that excite us?\n\nAh, sweet song!\n\nSweet Rose of Virtue\n\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\n\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\n\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\n\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\n\nand in every virtue that is held most dear―\n\nexcept only that you are merciless.\n\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\n\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\n\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\n\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently―\n\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue.\n\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\n\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\n\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\n\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again―\n\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\n\nEbb Tide\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nMassive, gray, these leaden waves\n\nbear their unchanging burden―\n\nthe sameness of each day to day\n\nwhile the wind seems to struggle to say\n\nsomething half-submerged planks at the mouth of the bay\n\nmight nuzzle limp seaweed to understand.\n\nNow collapsing dull waves drain away\n\nfrom the unenticing land;\n\nshrieking gulls shadow fish through salt spray―\n\nwhitish streaks on a fogged silver mirror.\n\nSizzling lightning impresses its brand.\n\nUnseen fingers scribble something in the wet sand.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by Southwest Review.\n\nWater and Gold\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nYou came to me as rain breaks on the desert\n\nwhen every flower springs to life at once,\n\nbut joy's a wan illusion to the expert:\n\nthe Bedouin has learned how not to want.\n\nYou came to me as riches to a miser\n\nwhen all is gold, or so his heart believes,\n\nuntil he dies much thinner and much wiser,\n\nhis gleaming bones hauled off by chortling thieves.\n\nYou gave your heart too soon, too dear, too vastly;\n\nI could not take it in; it was too much.\n\nI pledged to meet your price, but promised rashly.\n\nI died of thirst, of your bright Midas touch.\n\nI dreamed you gave me water of your lips,\n\nthen sealed my tomb with golden hieroglyphs.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nThe City Is a Garment\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nA rhinestone skein, a jeweled brocade of light,―\n\nthe city is a garment stretched so thin\n\nher festive colors bleed into the night,\n\nand everywhere bright seams, unraveling,\n\ncascade their brilliant contents out like coins\n\non motorways and esplanades; bead cars\n\ncome tumbling down long highways; at her groin\n\na railtrack like a zipper flashes sparks;\n\nher hills are haired with brush like cashmere wool\n\nand from their cleavage winking lights enlarge\n\nand travel, slender fingers ... softly pull\n\nthemselves into the semblance of a barge.\n\nWhen night becomes too chill, she softly dons\n\ngreat overcoats of warmest-colored dawn.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nThe Folly of Wisdom\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nShe is wise in the way that children are wise,\n\nlooking at me with such knowing, grave eyes\n\nI must bend down to her to understand.\n\nBut she only smiles, and takes my hand.\n\nWe are walking somewhere that her feet know to go,\n\nso I smile, and I follow ...\n\nAnd the years are dark creatures concealed in bright leaves\n\nthat flutter above us, and what she believes―\n\nI can almost remember―goes something like this:\n\nthe prince is a horned toad, awaiting her kiss.\n\nShe wiggles and giggles, and all will be well\n\nif only we find him! The woodpecker’s knell\n\nas he hammers the coffin of some dying tree\n\nthat once was a fortress to someone like me\n\nrings wildly above us. Some things that we know\n\nwe are meant to forget. Life is a bloodletting, maple-syrup-slow.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by Romantics Quarterly.\n\nThe Communion of Sighs\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere was a moment\n\nwithout the sound of trumpets or a shining light,\n\nbut with only silence and darkness and a cool mist\n\nfelt more than seen.\n\nI was eighteen,\n\nmy heart pounding wildly within me like a fist.\n\nExpectation hung like a cry in the night,\n\nand your eyes shone like the corona of a comet.\n\nThere was an instant . . .\n\nwithout words, but with a deeper communion,\n\nas clothing first, then inhibitions fell;\n\nliquidly our lips met\n\n―feverish, wet―\n\nforgotten, the tales of heaven and hell,\n\nin the immediacy of our fumbling union . . .\n\nwhen the rest of the world became distant.\n\nThen the only light was the moon on the rise,\n\nand the only sound, the communion of sighs.\n\nThis is one of my early free verse sonnets but I can’t remember exactly when I wrote it. Due to the romantic style, I believe it was probably written during my first two years in college, making me 18 or 19 at the time.\n\nAbide\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nafter Philip Larkin's \"Aubade\"\n\nIt is hard to understand or accept mortality―\n\nsuch an alien concept: not to be.\n\nPerhaps unsettling enough to spawn religion,\n\nor to scare mutant fish out of a primordial sea\n\nboiling like goopy green tea in a kettle.\n\nPerhaps a man should exhibit more mettle\n\nthan to admit such fear, denying Nirvana exists\n\nsimply because we are stuck here in such a fine fettle.\n\nAnd so we abide . . .\n\neven in life, staring out across that dark brink.\n\nAnd if the thought of death makes your questioning heart sink,\n\nit is best not to drink\n\n(or, drinking, certainly not to think).\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by Light Quarterly.\n\nFree Fall\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThese cloudless nights, the sky becomes a wheel\n\nwhere suns revolve around an axle star ...\n\nLook there, and choose. Decide which moon is yours.\n\nSink Lethe-ward, held only by a heel.\n\nAdvantage. Disadvantage. Who can tell?\n\nTo see is not to know, but you can feel\n\nthe tug sometimes―the gravity, the shell\n\nas lustrous as damp pearl. You sink, you reel\n\ntoward some draining revelation. Air―\n\ntoo thin to grasp, to breath. Such pressure. Gasp.\n\nThe stars invert, electric, everywhere.\n\nAnd so we fall, down-tumbling through night’s fissure ...\n\ntwo beings pale, intent to fall forever\n\naround each other―fumbling at love’s tether ...\n\nnow separate, now distant, now together.\n\nThis is a 15-line free verse sonnet originally published by Sonnet Scroll.\n\nOnce\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Beth\n\nOnce when her kisses were fire incarnate\n\nand left in their imprint bright lipstick, and flame,\n\nwhen her breath rose and fell over smoldering dunes,\n\nleaving me listlessly sighing her name . . .\n\nOnce when her ******* were as pale, as beguiling,\n\nas wan rivers of sand shedding heat like a mist,\n\nwhen her words would at times softly, mildly rebuke me\n\nall the while as her lips did more wildly insist . . .\n\nOnce when the thought of her echoed and whispered\n\nthrough vast wastelands of need like a Bedouin chant,\n\nI ached for the touch of her lips with such longing\n\nthat I vowed all my former vows to recant . . .\n\nOnce, only once, something bloomed, of a desiccate seed―\n\nthis implausible blossom her wild rains of kisses decreed.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nAt Once\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Beth\n\nThough she was fair,\n\nthough she sent me the epistle of her love at once\n\nand inscribed therein love’s antique prayer,\n\nI did not love her at once.\n\nThough she would dare\n\npain’s pale, clinging shadows, to approach me at once,\n\nthe dark, haggard keeper of the lair,\n\nI did not love her at once.\n\nThough she would share\n\nthe all of her being, to heal me at once,\n\nyet more than her touch I was unable bear.\n\nI did not love her at once.\n\nAnd yet she would care,\n\nand pour out her essence ...\n\nand yet―there was more!\n\nI awoke from long darkness,\n\nand yet―she was there.\n\nI loved her the longer;\n\nI loved her the more\n\nbecause I did not love her at once.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nTwice\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nNow twice she has left me\n\nand twice I have listened\n\nand taken her back, remembering days\n\nwhen love lay upon us\n\nand sparkled and glistened\n\nwith the brightness of dew through a gathering haze.\n\nBut twice she has left me\n\nto start my life over,\n\nand twice I have gathered up embers, to learn:\n\nrekindle a fire\n\nfrom ash, soot and cinder\n\nand softly it sputters, refusing to burn.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nMoments\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere were moments full of promise,\n\nlike the petal-scented rainfall of early spring,\n\nwhen to hold you in my arms and to kiss your willing lips\n\nseemed everything.\n\nThere are moments strangely empty\n\nfull of pale unearthly twilight―how the cold stars stare!―\n\nwhen to be without you is a dark enchantment\n\nthe night and I share.\n\nThe Harvest of Roses\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI have not come for the harvest of roses―\n\nthe poets' mad visions,\n\ntheir railing at rhyme ...\n\nfor I have discerned what their writing discloses:\n\nweak words wanting meaning,\n\nbeat torsioning time.\n\nNor have I come for the reaping of gossamer―\n\nimages weak,\n\ntoo forced not to fail;\n\ngathered by poets who worship their luster,\n\nthey shimmer, impendent,\n\nresplendently pale.\n\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review\n\nDistances\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nMoonbeams on water―\n\nthe reflected light\n\nof a halcyon star\n\nnow drowning in night ...\n\nSo your memories are.\n\nFootprints on beaches\n\nnow flooding with water;\n\nthe small, broken ribcage\n\nof some primitive slaughter ...\n\nSo near, yet so far.\n\nNOTE: In the first stanza the \"halcyon star\" is the sun, which has dropped below the horizon and is thus \"drowning in night.\" But its light strikes the moon, creating moonbeams which are reflected by the water. Sometimes memories seem that distant, that faint, that elusive. Footprints are being washed away, a heart is missing from its ribcage, and even things close at hand can seem infinitely beyond our reach.\n\nA Surfeit of Light\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere was always a surfeit of light in your presence.\n\nYou stood distinctly apart, not of the humdrum world―\n\na chariot of gold in a procession of plywood.\n\nWe were all pioneers of the modern expedient race,\n\nraising the ante: Home Depot to Lowe’s.\n\nYours was an antique grace―Thrace’s or Mesopotamia’s.\n\nWe were never quite sure of your silver allure,\n\nof your trillium-and-platinum diadem,\n\nof your utter lack of flatware-like utility.\n\nYou told us that night―your wound would not scar.\n\nThe black moment passed, then you were no more.\n\nThe darker the sky, how much brighter the Star!\n\nThe day of your funeral, I ripped out the crown mold.\n\nYou were this fool’s gold.\n\nSongstress\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Nadia Anjuman\n\nWithin its starkwhite ribcage, how the heart\n\nmust flutter wildly, O, and always sing\n\nagainst the pressing darkness: all it knows\n\nuntil at last it feels the numbing sting\n\nof death. Then life's brief vision swiftly passes,\n\nimposing night on one who clearly saw.\n\nDeath held your bright heart tightly, till its maw―\n\nenvenomed, fanged―could swallow, whole, your Awe.\n\nAnd yet it was not death so much as you\n\nwho sealed your doom; you could not help but sing\n\nand not be silenced. Here, behold your tomb's\n\nwhite alabaster cage: pale, wretched thing!\n\nBut you'll not be imprisoned here, wise wren!\n\nYour words soar free; rise, sing, fly, live again.\n\nA poet like Nadia Anjuman can be likened to a caged bird, deprived of flight, who somehow finds it within herself to sing of love and beauty. But when the world finally robs her of both flight and song, what is left for her but to leave the world, thus bereaving the world of herself and her song?\n\nCome Down\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Harold Bloom\n\nCome down, O, come down\n\nfrom your high mountain tower.\n\nHow coldly the wind blows,\n\nhow late this chill hour ...\n\nand I cannot wait\n\nfor a meteor shower\n\nto show you the time\n\nmust be now, or not ever.\n\nCome down, O, come down\n\nfrom the high mountain heather\n\nnow brittle and brown\n\nas fierce northern gales sever.\n\nCome down, or your heart\n\nwill grow cold as the weather\n\nwhen winter devours\n\nand spring returns never.\n\nNOTE: I dedicated this poem to Harold Bloom after reading his introduction to the Best American Poetry anthology he edited. Bloom seemed intent on claiming poetry as the province of the uber-reader (i.e., himself), but I remember reading poems by Blake, Burns, cummings, Dickinson, Frost, Housman, Eliot, Pound, Shakespeare, Whitman, Yeats, et al, and grokking them as a boy, without any “advanced” instruction from anyone.\n\nSuch Tenderness\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the mothers of Gaza and loving, compassionate mothers everywhere\n\nThere was, in your touch, such tenderness―as\n\nonly the dove on her mildest day has,\n\nwhen she shelters downed fledglings beneath a warm wing\n\nand coos to them softly, unable to sing.\n\nWhat songs long forgotten occur to you now―\n\na babe at each breast? What terrible vow\n\nripped from your throat like the thunder that day\n\ncan never hold severing lightnings at bay?\n\nTime taught you tenderness―time, oh, and love.\n\nBut love in the end is seldom enough ...\n\nand time?―insufficient to life’s brief task.\n\nI can only admire, unable to ask―\n\nwhat is the source, whence comes the desire\n\nof a woman to love as no God may require?\n\nIn this Ordinary Swoon\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIn this ordinary swoon\n\nas I pass from life to death,\n\nI feel no heat from the cold, pale moon;\n\nI feel no sympathy for breath.\n\nWho I am and why I came,\n\nI do not know; nor does it matter.\n\nThe end of every man’s the same\n\nand every god’s as mad as a hatter.\n\nI do not fear the letting go;\n\nI only fear the clinging on\n\nto hope when there’s no hope, although\n\nI lift my face to the blazing sun\n\nand feel the greater intensity\n\nof the wilder inferno within me.\n\nThis is a mostly tetrameter sonnet with shorter and longer lines.\n\nMare Clausum\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThese are the narrows of my soul―\n\ndark waters pierced by eerie, haunting screams.\n\nAnd these uncharted islands bleakly home\n\nwild nightmares and deep, strange, forbidding dreams.\n\nPlease don’t think to find pearls’ pale, unearthly glow\n\nwithin its shoals, nor corals in its reefs.\n\nFor, though you seek to salvage Love, I know\n\nthat vessel lists, and night brings no relief.\n\nPause here, and look, and know that all is lost;\n\nthen turn, and go; let salt consume, and rust.\n\nThis sea is not for sailors, but the ******\n\nwho lingered long past morning, till they learned\n\nwhy it is named:\n\nMare Clausum.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet with shorter and longer lines, originally published by Penny Dreadful. Mare Clausum is Latin for \"Closed Sea.\" I wrote the first version of this poem as a teenager.\n\nRedolence\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nNow darkness ponds upon the violet hills;\n\ncicadas sing; the tall elms gently sway;\n\nand night bends near, a deepening shade of gray;\n\nthe bass concerto of a bullfrog fills\n\nwhat silence there once was; globed searchlights play.\n\nGreen hanging ferns adorn dark window sills,\n\nall drooping fronds, awaiting morning’s flares;\n\nmosquitoes whine; the lissome moth again\n\nflits like a veiled oud-dancer, and endures\n\nthe fumblings of night’s enervate gray rain.\n\nAnd now the pact of night is made complete;\n\nthe air is fresh and cool, washed of the grime\n\nof the city’s ashen breath; and, for a time,\n\nthe fragrance of her clings, obscure and sweet.\n\nPublished by The Eclectic Muse and The Best of the Eclectic Muse 1989-2003\n\nFountainhead\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI did not delight in love so much\n\nas in a kiss like linnets' wings,\n\nthe flutterings of a pulse so soft\n\nthe heart remembers, as it sings:\n\nto bathe there was its transport, brushed\n\nby marble lips, or porcelain,―\n\none liquid kiss, one cool outburst\n\nfrom pale rosettes. What did it mean ...\n\nto float awhirl on minute tides\n\nwithin the compass of your eyes,\n\nto feel your alabaster bust\n\ngrow cold within? Ecstatic sighs\n\nseem hisses now; your eyes, serene,\n\nreflect the sun's pale tourmaline.\n\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly\n\nPan\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n... Among the shadows of the groaning elms,\n\namid the darkening oaks, we fled ourselves ...\n\n... Once there were paths that led to coracles\n\nthat clung to piers like loosening barnacles ...\n\n... where we cannot return, because we lost\n\nthe pebbles and the playthings, and the moss ...\n\n... hangs weeping gently downward, maidens’ hair\n\nwho never were enchanted, and the stairs ...\n\n... that led up to the Fortress in the trees\n\nwill not support our weight, but on our knees ...\n\n... we still might fit inside those splendid hours\n\nof damsels in distress, of rustic towers ...\n\n... of voices of the wolves’ tormented howls\n\nthat died, and live in dreams’ soft, windy vowels ...\n\nOriginally published by Sonnet Scroll\n\nThe Endeavors of Lips\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nHow sweet the endeavors of lips: to speak\n\nof the heights of those pleasures which left us weak\n\nin love’s strangely lit beds, where the cold springs creak:\n\nfor there is no illusion like love ...\n\nGrown childlike, we wish for those storied days,\n\nfor those bright sprays of flowers, those primrosed ways\n\nthat curled to the towers of Yesterdays\n\nwhere She braided illusions of love ...\n\n\"O, let down your hair!\"―we might call and call,\n\nto the dark-slatted window, the moonlit wall ...\n\nbut our love is a shadow; we watch it crawl\n\nlike a spidery illusion.

Burch\n\nIf you come to San Miguel\n\nbefore the orchids fall,\n\nwe might stroll through lengthening shadows\n\nthose deserted streets\n\nwhere love first bloomed ...\n\nYou might buy the same cheap musk\n\nfrom that mud-spattered stall\n\nwhere with furtive eyes the vendor\n\nwatched his fragrant wares\n\nperfume your ******* ...\n\nWhere lean men mend tattered nets,\n\ndisgruntled sea gulls chide;\n\nwe might find that cafetucho\n\nwhere through grimy panes\n\nsunset implodes ...\n\nWhere tall cranes spin canvassed loads,\n\nthe strange anhingas glide.\n\nGreen brine laps splintered moorings,\n\nrusted iron chains grind,\n\nweighed and anchored in the past,\n\nheld fast by luminescent tides ...\n\nShould you come to San Miguel?\n\nLet love decide.\n\nA Vain Word\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nOleanders at dawn preen extravagant whorls\n\nas I read in leaves’ Sanskrit brief moments remaining\n\ntill sunset implodes, till the moon strands grey pearls\n\nunder moss-stubbled oaks, full of whispers, complaining\n\nto the minions of autumn, how swiftly life goes\n\nas I fled before love ... Now, through leaves trodden black,\n\nshivering, I wander as winter’s first throes\n\nof cool listless snow drench my cheeks, back and neck.\n\nI discerned in one season all eternities of grief,\n\nthe specter of death sprawled out under the rose,\n\nthe last consequence of faith in the flight of one leaf,\n\nthe incontinence of age, as life’s bright torrent slows.\n\nO, where are you now?―I was timid, absurd.\n\nI would find comfort again in a vain word.\n\nPublished by Chrysanthemum and Tucumcari Literary Review\n\nChloe\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere were skies onyx at night ... moons by day ...\n\nlakes pale as her eyes ... breathless winds\n\n******* tall elms; ... she would say\n\nthat we loved, but I figured we’d sinned.\n\nSoon impatiens too fiery to stay\n\nsagged; the crocus bells drooped, golden-limned;\n\nthings of brightness, rinsed out, ran to gray ...\n\nall the light of that world softly dimmed.\n\nWhere our feet were inclined, we would stray;\n\nthere were paths where dead weeds stood untrimmed,\n\ndistant mountains that loomed in our way,\n\nthunder booming down valleys dark-hymned.\n\nWhat I found, I found lost in her face\n\nwhile yielding all my virtue to her grace.\n\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly as “A Dying Fall”\n\nAflutter\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThis rainbow is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh.―Yahweh\n\nYou are gentle now, and in your failing hour\n\nhow like the child you were, you seem again,\n\nand smile as sadly as the girl (age ten?)\n\nwho held the sparrow with the mangled wing\n\nclose to her heart. It marveled at your power\n\nbut would not mend. And so the world renews\n\nold vows it seemed to make: false promises\n\nspring whispers, as if nothing perishes\n\nthat does not resurrect to wilder hues\n\nlike rainbows’ eerie pacts we apprehend\n\nbut cannot fail to keep. Now in your eyes\n\nI see the end of life that only dies\n\nand does not care for bright, translucent lies.\n\nAre tears so precious? These few, let us spend\n\ntogether, as before, then lay to rest\n\nthese sparrows’ hearts aflutter at each breast.\n\nThis is a poem about a couple committing suicide together. The “eerie pact” refers to a Bible verse about the rainbow being a “covenant,” when the only covenant human beings can depend on is the original one that condemned us to suffer and die. That covenant is always kept perfectly.\n\nTo Flower\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhen Pentheus [\"grief'] went into the mountains in the garb of the baccae, his mother [Agave] and the other maenads, possessed by Dionysus, tore him apart (Euripides, Bacchae; Apollodorus 3.5.2; Ovid, Metamorphoses 3.511-733; Hyginus, Fabulae 184). The agave dies as soon as it blooms; the moonflower, or night-blooming cereus, is a desert plant of similar fate.\n\nWe are not long for this earth, I know―\n\nyou and I, all our petals incurled,\n\ntill a night of pale brilliance, moonflower aglow.\n\nIs there love anywhere in this strange world?\n\nThe Agave knows best when it's time to die\n\nand rages to life with such rapturous leaves\n\nher name means Illustrious. Each hour more high,\n\nshe claws toward heaven, for, if she believes\n\nin love at all, she has left it behind\n\nto flower, to flower. When darkness falls\n\nshe wilts down to meet it, where something crawls:\n\nbeheaded, bewildered. And since love is blind,\n\nshe never adored it, nor watches it go.\n\nCan we be as she is, moonflower aglow?\n\nOriginally published by The Neovictorian/Cochlea\n\nFlight 93\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI held the switch in trembling fingers, asked\n\nwhy existence felt so small, so purposeless,\n\nlike a minnow wriggling feebly in my grasp ...\n\nvibrations of huge engines thrummed my arms\n\nas, glistening with sweat, I nudged the switch\n\nto OFF ... I heard the klaxon-shrill alarms\n\nlike vultures’ shriekings ... earthward, in a stall ...\n\nwe floated ... earthward ... wings outstretched, aghast\n\nlike Icarus ... as through the void we fell ...\n\ntill nothing was so beautiful, so blue ...\n\nso vivid as that moment ... and I held\n\nan image of your face, and dreamed I flew\n\ninto your arms. The earth rushed up. I knew\n\nsuch comfort, in that moment, loving you.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by The Lyric.\n\nOasis\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI want tears to form again\n\nin the shriveled glands of these eyes\n\ndried all these long years\n\nby too much heated knowing.\n\nI want tears to course down\n\nthese parched cheeks,\n\nto star these cracked lips\n\nlike an improbable dew\n\nin the heart of a desert.\n\nI want words to burble up\n\nlike happiness, like the thought of love,\n\nlike the overwhelming, shimmering thought of you\n\nto a nomad who\n\nhas only known drought.\n\nThis is a mostly hexameter sonnet with shorter and longer lines.\n\nMelting\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nEntirely, as spring consumes the snow,\n\nthe thought of you consumes me: I am found\n\nin rivulets, dissolved to what I know\n\nof former winters’ passions. Underground,\n\nperhaps one slender icicle remains\n\nof what I was before, in some dark cave―\n\na stalactite, long calcified, now drains\n\nto sodden pools, whose milky liquid laves\n\nthe colder rock, thus washing something clean\n\nthat never saw the light, that never knew\n\nthe crust could break above, that light could stream:\n\nso luminous, so bright, so beautiful ...\n\nI lie revealed, and so I stand transformed,\n\nand all because you smiled on me, and warmed.\n\nAfterglow\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe night is full of stars. Which still exist?\n\nBefore time ends, perhaps one day we’ll know.\n\nFor now I hold your fingers to my lips\n\nand feel their pulse ... warm, palpable and slow ...\n\nonce slow to match this reckless spark in me,\n\nthis moon in ceaseless orbit I became,\n\ncompelled by wilder gravity to flee\n\nnight’s universe of suns, for one pale flame ...\n\nfor one pale flame that seemed to signify\n\nthe Zodiac of all, the meaning of\n\nlove’s wandering flight past Neptune. Now to lie\n\nin dawning recognition is enough ...\n\nenough each night to bask in you, to know\n\nthe face of love ... eyes closed ... its afterglow.\n\nAll Afterglow\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSomething remarkable, perhaps ...\n\nthe color of her eyes ... though I forget\n\nthe color of her eyes ... perhaps her hair\n\nthe way it blew about ... I do not know\n\njust what it was about her that has kept\n\nher thought lodged deep in mine ... unmelted snow\n\nthat lasted till July would be less rare,\n\nclasped in some frozen cavern where the wind\n\nsculpts bright grotesqueries, ignoring springs’\n\nand summers’ higher laws ... there thawing slow\n\nand strange by strange degrees, one tick beyond\n\nthe freezing point which keeps all things the same\n\n... till what remains is fragile and unlike\n\nthe world above, where melted snows and rains\n\nform rivulets that, inundate with sun,\n\nevaporate, and in life’s cyclic stream\n\nremake the world again ... I do not know\n\nthat we can be remade―all afterglow.\n\nThese Hallowed Halls\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\na young Romantic Poet mourns the passing of an age . . .\n\nA final stereo fades into silence\n\nand now there is seldom a murmur\n\nto trouble the slumber of these ancient halls.\n\nI stand by a window where others have watched\n\nthe passage of time alone, not untouched,\n\nand I am as they were―unsure, for the days\n\nstretch out ahead, a bewildering maze.\n\nAh, faithless lover―that I had never touched your breast,\n\nnor felt the stirrings of my heart,\n\nwhich until that moment had peacefully slept.\n\nFor now I have known the exhilaration\n\nof a heart that has leapt every pinnacle of Love,\n\nand the result of all such infatuations―\n\nthe long freefall to earth, as the moon glides above.\n\nCome!\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWill you come to visit my grave, I wonder,\n\nin the season of lightning, the season of thunder,\n\nwhen I have lain so long in the indifferent earth\n\nthat I have no girth?\n\nWhen my womb has conformed to the chastity\n\nyour anemic Messiah envisioned for me,\n\nwill you finally be pleased that my *** was thus rendered\n\nunpalatable, disengendered?\n\nAnd when those strange loathsome organs that troubled you so\n\nhave been eaten by worms, will the heavens still glow\n\nwith the approval of God that I ended a maid―\n\nthanks to a *****?\n\nAnd will you come to visit my grave, I wonder,\n\nin the season of lightning, the season of thunder?\n\nErin\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nAll that’s left of Ireland is her hair―\n\nbright carrot―and her milkmaid-pallid skin,\n\nher brilliant air of cavalier despair,\n\nher train of children―some conceived in sin,\n\nthe others to avoid it. For nowhere\n\nis evidence of thought. Devout, pale, thin,\n\ngay, nonchalant, all radiance. So fair!\n\nHow can men look upon her and not spin\n\nlike wobbly buoys churned by her skirt’s brisk air?\n\nThey buy. They ***** to pat her nyloned shin,\n\nto share her elevated, pale Despair ...\n\nto find at last two spirits ease no one’s.\n\nAll that’s left of Ireland is the Care,\n\nher impish grin, green eyes like leprechauns’.\n\nThe Composition of Shadows\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n“I made it out of a mouthful of air.”―W. B. Yeats\n\nWe breathe and so we write; the night\n\nhums softly its accompaniment.\n\nPale phosphors burn; the page we turn\n\nleads onward, and we smile, content.\n\nAnd what we mean we write to learn:\n\nthe vowels of love, the consonants’\n\nstrange golden weight, each plosive’s shape―\n\ncurved like the heart. Here, resonant,\n\nsounds’ shadows mass beneath bright glass\n\nlike singing voles curled in a maze\n\nof blank white space. We touch a face―\n\nlong-frozen words trapped in a glaze\n\nthat insulates our hearts. Nowhere\n\ncan love be found. Just shrieking air.\n\nThe Composition of Shadows (II)\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWe breathe and so we write;\n\nthe night\n\nhums softly its accompaniment.\n\nPale phosphors burn;\n\nthe page we turn\n\nleads onward, and we smile, content.\n\nAnd what we mean\n\nwe write to learn:\n\nthe vowels of love, the consonants’\n\nstrange golden weight,\n\nthe blood’s debate\n\nwithin the heart. Here, resonant,\n\nsounds’ shadows mass\n\nagainst bright glass,\n\nwithin the white Labyrinthian maze.\n\nThrough simple grace,\n\nI touch your face,\n\nah words! And I would gaze\n\nthe night’s dark length\n\nin waning strength\n\nto find the words to feel\n\nsuch light again.\n\nO, for a pen\n\nto spell love so ethereal.\n\nTo Please The Poet\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nTo please the poet, words must dance―\n\nstaccato, brisk, a two-step:\n\nso!\n\nOr waltz in elegance to time\n\nof music mild,\n\nadagio.\n\nTo please the poet, words must chance\n\nemotion in catharsis―\n\nflame.\n\nOr splash into salt seas, descend\n\nin sheets of silver-shining\n\nrain.\n\nTo please the poet, words must prance\n\nand gallop, gambol, revel,\n\nrail.\n\nOr muse upon a moment, mute,\n\nobscure, unsure, imperfect,\n\npale.\n\nTo please the poet, words must sing,\n\nor croak, wart-tongued, imagining.\n\nThe First Christmas\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n’Twas in a land so long ago . . .\n\nthe lambs lay blanketed in snow\n\nand little children everywhere\n\nsat and watched warm embers glow\n\nand dreamed (of what, we do not know).\n\nAnd THEN―a star appeared on high,\n\nThe brightest man had ever seen!\n\nIt made the children whisper low\n\nin puzzled awe (what did it mean?).\n\nIt made the wooly lambkins cry.\n\nFor far away a new-born lay,\n\nwarm-blanketed in straw and hay,\n\na lowly manger for his crib.\n\nThe cattle mooed, distraught and low,\n\nto see the child. They did not know\n\nit now was Christmas day!\n\nThis is a poem in which I tried to capture the mystery and magic of the first Christmas day. If you like my poem, you are welcome to share it, but please cite me as the author, which you can do by including the title and subheading.\n\nThe Lingering and the Unconsoled Heart\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere is a silence―\n\nthe last unspoken moment\n\nbefore death,\n\nwhen the moon,\n\ncratered and broken,\n\nis all madness and light,\n\nwhen the breath comes low and complaining,\n\nand the heart is a ruin\n\nof emptiness and night.\n\nThere is a grief―\n\nthe grief of a lover's embrace\n\nwhile faith still shimmers in a mother’s tears ...\n\nThere is no emptier time, nor place,\n\nwhile the faint glimmer of life is ours\n\nthat the lingering and the unconsoled heart fears\n\nbeyond this: seeing its own stricken face\n\nin eyes that drift toward some incomprehensible place.\n\nLozenge\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhen I was closest to love, it did not seem\n\nreal at all, but a thing of such tenuous sweetness\n\nit might dissolve in my mouth\n\nlike a lozenge of sugar.\n\nWhen I held you in my arms, I did not feel\n\nour lack of completeness,\n\nknowing how easy it was\n\nfor us to cling to each other.\n\nAnd there were nights when the clouds\n\nsped across the moon’s face,\n\nexposing such rarified brightness\n\nwe did not witness\n\nso much as embrace\n\nlove’s human appearance.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by The HyperTexts.\n\nThe Princess and the Pauper\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Norman Kraeft in memory of his beloved wife June Kysilko Kraeft\n\nHere was a woman bright, intent on life,\n\nwho did not flinch from Death, but caught his eye\n\nand drew him, powerless, into her spell\n\nof wanting her himself, so much the lie\n\nthat she was meant for him―obscene illusion!―\n\nmade him seem a monarch throned like God on high,\n\nwhen he was less than nothing; when to die\n\nmeant many stultifying, pained embraces.\n\nShe shed her gown, undid the tangled laces\n\nthat tied her to the earth: then she was his.\n\nNow all her erstwhile beauty he defaces\n\nand yet she grows in hallowed loveliness―\n\nher ghost beyond perfection―for to die\n\nwas to ascend. Now he begs, penniless.\n\nAlbum\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI caress them―trapped in brittle cellophane―\n\nand I see how young they were, and how unwise;\n\nand I remember their first flight―an old prop plane,\n\ntheir blissful arc through alien blue skies ...\n\nAnd I touch them here through leaves which―tattered, frayed―\n\nare also wings, but wings that never flew:\n\nlike insects’ wings―pinned, held. Here, time delayed,\n\ntheir features never changed, remaining two ...\n\nAnd Grief, which lurked unseen beyond the lens\n\nor in shadows where It crept on feral claws\n\nas It scratched Its way into their hearts, depends\n\non sorrows such as theirs, and works Its jaws ...\n\nand slavers for Its meat―those young, unwise,\n\nwho naively dare to dream, yet fail to see\n\nhow, lumbering sunward, Hope, ungainly, flies,\n\nclutching to Her ruffled breast what must not be.\n\nBecause You Came to Me\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nBecause you came to me with sweet compassion\n\nand kissed my furrowed brow and smoothed my hair,\n\nI do not love you after any fashion,\n\nbut wildly, in despair.\n\nBecause you came to me in my black torment\n\nand kissed me fiercely, blazing like the sun\n\nupon parched desert dunes, till in dawn’s foment\n\nthey melt, I am undone.\n\nBecause I am undone, you have remade me\n\nas suns bring life, as brilliant rains endow\n\nthe earth below with leaves, where you now shade me\n\nand bower me, somehow.\n\nBreak Time\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor those who lost loved ones on 9-11\n\nIntrude upon my grief; sit; take a spot\n\nof milk to cloud the blackness that you feel;\n\nadd artificial sweeteners to conceal\n\nthe bitter aftertaste of loss. You’ll heal\n\nif I do not. The coffee’s hot. You speak:\n\nof bundt cakes, polls, the price of eggs. You glance\n\ntwice at your watch, cough, look at me askance.\n\nThe TV drones oeuvres of high romance\n\nin syncopated lip-synch. Should I feel\n\nthe underbelly of Love’s warm Ideal,\n\nits fuzzy-wuzzy tummy, and not reel\n\ntoward some dark conclusion? Disappear\n\nto pale, dissolving atoms. Were you here?\n\nI brush you off: like saccharine, like a tear.\n\n911 Carousel\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n“And what rough beast ... slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?”―W. B. Yeats\n\nThey laugh and do not comprehend, nor ask\n\nwhich way the wind is blowing, no, nor why\n\nthe reeling azure fixture of the sky\n\ngrows pale with ash, and whispers “Holocaust.”\n\nThey think to seize the ring, life’s tinfoil prize,\n\nand, breathless with endeavor, shriek aloud.\n\nThe voice of terror thunders from a cloud\n\nthat darkens over children adult-wise,\n\nfar less inclined to error, when a step\n\nin any wrong direction is to fall\n\na JDAM short of heaven. Decoys call,\n\ntheir voices plangent, honking to be shot . . .\n\nHere, childish dreams and nightmares whirl, collide,\n\nas East and West, on slouching beasts, they ride.\n\nAt Cædmon’s Grave\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n“Cædmon’s Hymn,” composed at the Monastery of Whitby (a North Yorkshire fishing village), is one of the oldest known poems written in the English language, dating back to around 680 A.D. According to legend, Cædmon, an illiterate Anglo-Saxon cowherd, received the gift of poetic composition from an angel; he subsequently founded a school of Christian poets. Unfortunately, only nine lines of Cædmon’s verse survive, in the writings of the Venerable Bede. Whitby, tiny as it is, reappears later in the history of English literature, having been visited, in diametric contrast, by Lewis Carroll and Bram Stoker’s ghoulish yet evocative Dracula.\n\nAt the monastery of Whitby,\n\non a day when the sun sank through the sea,\n\nand the gulls shrieked wildly, jubilant, free,\n\nwhile the wind and time blew all around,\n\nI paced those dusk-enamored grounds\n\nand thought I heard the steps resound\n\nof Carroll, Stoker and good Bede\n\nwho walked there, too, their spirits freed\n\n―perhaps by God, perhaps by need―\n\nto write, and with each line, remember\n\nthe glorious light of Cædmon’s ember,\n\nscorched tongues of flame words still engender.\n\nHere, as darkness falls, at last we meet.\n\nI lay this pale garland of words at his feet.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nRadiance\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Dylan Thomas\n\nThe poet delves earth’s detritus―hard toil―\n\nfor raw-edged nouns, barbed verbs, vowels’ lush bouquet;\n\neach syllable his pen excretes―dense soil,\n\ndark images impacted, rooted clay.\n\nThe poet sees the sea but feels its meaning―\n\nthe teeming brine, the mirrored oval flame\n\nthat leashes and excites its turgid surface ...\n\nthen squanders years imagining love’s the same.\n\nBelatedly he turns to what lies broken―\n\nthe scarred and furrowed plot he fiercely sifts,\n\namong death’s sicksweet dungs and composts seeking\n\none element that scorches and uplifts.\n\nDowndraft\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Dylan Thomas\n\nWe feel rather than understand what he meant\n\nas he reveals a shattered firmament\n\nwhich before him never existed.\n\nHere, there are no images gnarled and twisted\n\nout of too many words,\n\nbut only flocks of white birds\n\nwheeling and flying.\n\nHere, as Time spins, reeling and dying,\n\nthe voice of a last gull\n\nor perhaps some spirit no longer whole,\n\nechoes its lonely madrigal\n\nand we feel its strange pull\n\non the astonished soul.\n\nO My Prodigal!\n\nThe vents of the sky, ripped asunder,\n\necho this wild, primal thunder—\n\nnow dying into undulations of vanishing wings . . .\n\nand this voice which in haggard bleak rapture still somehow downward sings.\n\nHuntress\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nafter Baudelaire\n\nLynx-eyed, cat-like and cruel, you creep\n\nacross a crevice dropping deep\n\ninto a dark and doomed domain.\n\nYour claws are sheathed. You smile, insane.\n\nRain falls upon your path, and pain\n\npours down. Your paws are pierced. You pause\n\nand heed the oft-lamented laws\n\nwhich bid you not begin again\n\ntill night returns. You wail like wind,\n\nthe sighing of a soul for sin,\n\nand give up hunting for a heart.\n\nTill sunset falls again, depart,\n\nthough hate and hunger urge you―\"On!\"\n\nHeed, hearts, your hope―the break of dawn.\n\nPublished by The HyperTexts, Dracula and His Kin and Sonnetto Poesia (Canada)\n\nHappily Never After (the Second Curse of the ***** Toad)\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nHe did not think of love of Her at all\n\nfrog-plangent nights, as moons engoldened roads\n\nthrough crumbling stonewalled provinces, where toads\n\n(nee princes) ruled in chinks and grew so small\n\nat last to be invisible. He smiled\n\n(the fables erred so curiously), and thought\n\nbemusedly of being reconciled\n\nto human flesh, because his heart was not\n\nincapable of love, but, being cursed\n\na second time, could only love a toad’s . . .\n\nand listened as inflated frogs rehearsed\n\ncheekbulging tales of anguish from green moats . . .\n\nand thought of her soft croak, her skin fine-warted,\n\nhis anemic flesh, and how true love was thwarted.\n\nBecause She Craved the Very Best\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nBecause she craved the very best,\n\nhe took her East, he took her West;\n\nhe took her where there were no wars\n\nand brought her bright bouquets of stars,\n\nthe blush and fragrances of roses,\n\nthe hush an evening sky imposes,\n\nmoonbeams pale and garlands rare,\n\nand golden combs to match her hair,\n\na nightingale to sing all night,\n\nwhite wings, to let her soul take flight ...\n\nShe stabbed him with a poisoned sting\n\nand as he lay there dying,\n\nshe screamed, \"I wanted everything!\"\n\nand started crying.\n\nCaveat\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIf only we were not so eloquent,\n\nwe might sing, and only sing, not to impress,\n\nbut only to enjoy, to be enjoyed.\n\nWe might inundate the earth with thankfulness\n\nfor light, although it dies, and make a song\n\nof night descending on the earth like bliss,\n\nwith other lights beyond―not to be known―\n\nbut only to be welcomed and enjoyed,\n\nbefore all worlds and stars are overthrown ...\n\nas a lover’s hands embrace a sleeping face\n\nand find it beautiful for emptiness\n\nof all but joy. There is no thought to love\n\nbut love itself. How senseless to redress,\n\nin darkness, such becoming nakedness . . .\n\nOriginally published by Clementine Unbound\n\nTo the Post-Modern Muse, Floundering\n\nby Michael R.

Magnified, the lens\n\nshot back absurd reflections of each face―\n\na carnival-like mirror. In the space\n\nbetween the silver backing and the glass,\n\nwe caught a glimpse of Joan, a frumpy lass\n\nwho never brushed her hair or teeth, and failed\n\nto pass on GO, and frequently was jailed\n\nfor awe’s beliefs.

Burch\n\nThe moon exposes pockmarked scars of craters;\n\nher visage, veiled by willows, palely looms.\n\nAnd we who rise each day to grind a living,\n\ndream each scented night of such perfumes\n\nas drew us to the window, to the moonlight,\n\nwhen all the earth was steeped in cobalt blue―\n\nan eerie vase of achromatic flowers\n\nbled silver by pale starlight, losing hue.\n\nThe night begins her waltz to waiting sunrise―\n\nadagio, the music she now hears;\n\nand we who in the sunlight slave for succor,\n\ndreaming, seek communion with the spheres.\n\nAnd all around the night is in crescendo,\n\nand everywhere the stars’ bright legions form,\n\nand here we hear the sweet incriminations\n\nof lovers we had once to keep us warm.\n\nAnd also here we find, like bled carnations,\n\nred lips that whitened, kisses drawn to lies,\n\nthat touched us once with fierce incantations\n\nand taught us love was prettier than wise.\n\n130 Refuted\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nMy mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;\n\nCoral is far more red than her lips' red;\n\n―Shakespeare, Sonnet 130\n\nSeas that sparkle in the sun\n\nwithout its light would have no beauty;\n\nbut the light within your eyes\n\nis theirs alone; it owes no duty.\n\nAnd their kindled flame, not half as bright,\n\nis meant for me, and brings delight.\n\nCoral formed beneath the sea,\n\nthough scarlet-tendriled, cannot warm me;\n\nwhile your lips, not half so red,\n\njust touching mine, at once inflame me.\n\nAnd the searing flames your lips arouse\n\nfathomless oceans fail to douse.\n\nBright roses’ brief affairs, declared\n\nwhen winter comes, will wither quickly.\n\nYour cheeks, though paler when compared\n\nwith them?―more lasting, never prickly.\n\nAnd your cheeks, though wan, so dear and warm,\n\nfar vaster treasures, need no thorns.\n\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly\n\nLove Sonnet LXVI\n\nby Pablo Neruda\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI love you only because I love you;\n\nI am torn between loving and not loving you,\n\nbetween apathy and desire.\n\nMy heart vacillates between ice and fire.\n\nI love you only because you’re the one I love;\n\nI hate you deeply, but hatred makes me implore you all the more\n\nso that in my inconstancy\n\nI do not see you, but love you blindly.\n\nPerhaps January’s frigid light\n\nwill consume my heart with its cruel rays,\n\nrobbing me of the key to contentment.\n\nIn this tragic plot, I ****** myself\n\nand I will die loveless because I love you,\n\nbecause I love you, my Love, in fire and in blood.\n\nLove Sonnet XI\n\nby Pablo Neruda\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.\n\nI stalk the streets, silent and starving.\n\nBread does not satisfy me; dawn does not divert me\n\nfrom my relentless pursuit of your fluid spoor.\n\nI long for your liquid laughter,\n\nfor your sunburned hands like savage harvests.\n\nI lust for your fingernails' pale marbles.\n\nI want to devour your ******* like almonds, whole.\n\nI want to ingest the sunbeams singed by your beauty,\n\nto eat the aquiline nose from your aloof face,\n\nto lick your eyelashes' flickering shade.\n\nI pursue you, snuffing the shadows,\n\nseeking your heart's scorching heat\n\nlike a puma prowling the heights of Quitratue.\n\nLove Sonnet XVII\n\nby Pablo Neruda\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI do not love you like coral or topaz,\n\nor the blazing hearth’s incandescent white flame;\n\nI love you as obscure things are embraced in the dark ...\n\nsecretly, in shadows, unguessed & unnamed.\n\nI love you like shrubs that refuse to blossom\n\nwhile pregnant with the radiance of mysterious flowers;\n\nnow, thanks to your love, an earthy fragrance\n\nlives dimly in my body’s odors.\n\nI love you without knowing―how, when, why or where;\n\nI love you forthrightly, without complications or care;\n\nI love you this way because I know no other.\n\nHere, where “I” no longer exists ... so it seems ...\n\nso close that your hand on my chest is my own,\n\nso close that your eyes close gently on my dreams.\n\nSonnet XLV\n\nby Pablo Neruda\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nDon't wander far away, not even for a day, because―\n\nhow can I explain? A day is too long ...\n\nand I’ll be waiting for you, like a man in an empty station\n\nwhere the trains all stand motionless.\n\nDon't leave me, my dear, not even for an hour, because―\n\nthen despair’s raindrops will all run blurrily together,\n\nand the smoke that drifts lazily in search of a home\n\nwill descend hazily on me, suffocating my heart.\n\nDarling, may your lovely silhouette never dissolve in the surf;\n\nmay your lashes never flutter at an indecipherable distance.\n\nPlease don't leave me for a second, my dearest,\n\nbecause then you'll have gone far too far\n\nand I'll wander aimlessly, amazed, asking all the earth:\n\nWill she ever return? Will she spurn me, dying?\n\nImperfect Sonnet\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nA word before the light is doused: the night\n\nis something wriggling through an unclean mind,\n\nas rats creep through a tenement. And loss\n\nis written cheaply with the moon’s cracked gloss\n\nlike lipstick through the infinite, to show\n\nlove’s pale yet sordid imprint on us. Go.\n\nWe have not learned love yet, except to cleave.\n\nI saw the moon rise once ... but to believe ...\n\nwas of another century ... and now ...\n\nI have the urge to love, but not the strength.\n\nDespair, once stretched out to its utmost length,\n\nlies couched in squalor, watching as the screen\n\nreveals \"love's\" damaged images: its dreams ...\n\nand ******* limply, screams and screams.\n\nOriginally published by Sonnet Scroll\n\nMayflies\n\nby Michael R.

Do stars bend down to see?\n\nDo gods commend the kindnesses of ants\n\nto aphids? Does one eel impress the sea?\n\nAre mayflies missed by mountains? Do the stars\n\nregret the glowworm’s stellar mimicry\n\nthe day it dies? Does not the world grind on\n\nas if it’s no great matter, not to be?\n\nLife, to be sure, is nothing much to lose.\n\nAnd yet somehow you’re everything to me.\n\nOriginally published by Clementine Unbound\n\nArtificial Smile\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI’m waiting for my artificial teeth\n\nto stretch belief, to hollow out the cob\n\nof zealous righteousness, to grasp life’s stub\n\nbetween clenched molars, and yank out the grief.\n\nMine must be art-official―zenlike Art―\n\na disembodied, white-enameled grin\n\nof Cheshire manufacture. Part by part,\n\nthe human smile becomes mock porcelain.\n\nTill in the end, the smile alone remains:\n\ntitanium-based alloys undestroyed\n\nwith graves’ worm-eaten contents, all the pains\n\nof bridgework unrecalled, and what annoyed\n\nus most about the corpses rectified\n\nto quaintest dust. The Smile winks, deified.\n\nModern Appetite\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIt grumbled low, insisting it would feast\n\non blood and flesh, etcetera, at least\n\nthree times a day. With soft lubricious grease\n\nand pale salacious oils, it would ease\n\nits way through life. Each day―an aperitif.\n\nEach night―a frothy bromide, for relief.\n\nIt lived on TV fare, wore pinafores,\n\nslurped sugar-coated gumballs, gobbled S’mores.\n\nWhen gas ensued, it burped and farted. ’Course,\n\nit thought aloud, my wife will leave me. ******\n\nare not so **** particular. Divorce\n\nis certainly a settlement, toujours!\n\nA Tums a day will keep the shrink away,\n\nrecalcify old bones, keep gas at bay.\n\nIf Simon says, etcetera, Mother, may\n\nI have my hit of calcium today?\n\nMother of Cowards\n\nby Michael R. Burch aka \"The Loyal Opposition\"\n\nSo unlike the brazen giant of Greek fame\n\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land,\n\nSpread-eagled, showering gold, a strumpet stands:\n\nA much-used trollop with a torch, whose flame\n\nHas long since been extinguished. And her name?\n\n\"Mother of Cowards!\" From her enervate hand\n\nSoft ash descends. Her furtive eyes demand\n\nAllegiance to her ****'s repulsive game.\n\n\"Keep, ancient lands, your wretched poor!\" cries she\n\nWith scarlet lips. \"Give me your hale, your whole,\n\nYour huddled tycoons, yearning to be pleased!\n\nThe wretched refuse of your toilet hole?\n\nOh, never send one unwashed child to me!\n\nI await Trump's pleasure by the gilded bowl!\"\n\nOriginally published by Light\n\nPremonition\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nNow the evening has come to a close and the party is over ...\n\nwe stand in the doorway and watch as they go―\n\neach stranger, each acquaintance, each unembraceable lover.\n\nThey walk to their cars and they laugh as they go,\n\nthough we know their warm laughter’s the wine ...\n\nthen they pause at the road where the dark asphalt flows\n\nendlessly on toward Zion ...\n\nand they kiss one another as though they were friends,\n\nand they promise to meet again “soon” ...\n\nbut the rivers of Jordan roll on without end,\n\nand the mockingbird calls to the moon ...\n\nand the katydids climb up the cropped hanging vines,\n\nand the crickets chirp on out of tune ...\n\nand their shadows, defined by the cryptic starlight,\n\nseem spirits torn loose from their tombs.\n\nAnd I know their brief lives are just eddies in time,\n\nthat their hearts are unreadable runes\n\nto be wiped clean, like slate, by the dark hand of fate\n\nwhen their corpses lie ravaged and ruined ...\n\nYou take my clenched fist and you give it a kiss\n\nas though it were something you loved,\n\nand the tears fill your eyes, brimming with the soft light\n\nof the stars winking gently above ...\n\nThen you whisper, \"It's time that we went back inside;\n\nif you'd like, we can sit and just talk for a while.\"\n\nAnd the hope in your eyes burns too deep, so I lie\n\nand I say, \"Yes, I would,\" to your small, troubled smile.\n\nI rather vividly remember writing this poem after an office party the year I co-oped with AT&T (at that time the largest company in the world, with presumably a lot of office parties). This would have been after my sophomore year in college, making me around 20 years old. The poem is “true” except that I was not the host because the party was at the house of one of the upper-level managers. Nor was I dating anyone seriously at the time.\n\nYour e-Verse\n\nby Michael R.

S. Eliot's \"Fire Sermon: (1) The Celts believed that the health of the land was tied to the health of its king. The Fisher King's land was in peril because he had a physical infirmity. One bad harvest and it was the king's fault for displeasing the gods. A religious icon (the Grail) could somehow rescue him. Strange logic! (2) The next stage brings us the saints, the Catholic church, etc. Millions are slaughtered, tortured and enslaved in the name of religion. Strange logic! (3) The next stage brings us to Darwin, modernism and \"The Waste Land.” Religion is dead. God is dead. Man is a glorified fungus! We'll evolve into something better adapted to life on Earth, someday, if we don’t destroy it. But billions continue to believe in and worship ancient “gods.” Strange logic! (4) The current stage of religion is summed up by this e-mail: the only way religion can compete today is as a form of flashy entertainment. ***** a website before it's too late.

Burch\n\nHas rhyme lost all its reason\n\nand rhythm, renascence?\n\nAre sonnets out of season\n\nand poems but poor pretense?\n\nAre poets lacking fire,\n\ntheir words too trite and forced?\n\nWhat happened to desire?\n\nHas passion been coerced?\n\nShall poetry fade slowly,\n\nlike Latin, to past tense?\n\nAre the bards too high and holy,\n\nor their readers merely dense?\n\nPlastic Art or Night Stand\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nDisclaimer: This is a poem about artificial poetry, not love dolls! The victim is the Muse.\n\nWe never questioned why “love” seemed less real\n\nthe more we touched her, and forgot her face.\n\nAbsorbed in molestation’s sticky feel,\n\nwe failed to see her staring into space,\n\nher doll-like features frozen in a smile.\n\nShe held us in her marionette’s embrace,\n\nher plastic flesh grown wet and slick and vile.\n\nWe groaned to feel our urgent fingers trace\n\nher undemanding body. All the while,\n\nshe lay and gaily bore her brief disgrace.\n\nWe loved her echoed passion’s squeaky air,\n\nher tongueless kisses’ artificial taste,\n\nthe way she matched, then raised our reckless pace,\n\nthe heart that seemed to pound, but was not there.\n\n“Whoso List to Hunt” is a famous early English sonnet written by Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503-1542) in the mid-16th century.\n\nWhoever Longs to Hunt\n\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\n\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\n\nWhoever longs to hunt, I know the deer;\n\nbut as for me, alas!, I may no more.\n\nThis vain pursuit has left me so bone-sore\n\nI'm one of those who falters, at the rear.\n\nYet friend, how can I draw my anguished mind\n\naway from the doe?\n\nThus, as she flees before\n\nme, fainting I follow.\n\nI must leave off, therefore,\n\nsince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\n\nWhoever seeks her out,\n\nI relieve of any doubt,\n\nthat he, like me, must spend his time in vain.\n\nFor graven with diamonds, set in letters plain,\n\nthese words appear, her fair neck ringed about:\n\nTouch me not, for Caesar's I am,\n\nAnd wild to hold, though I seem tame.\n\nAlien Nation\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor J. S. S., a \"Christian\" poet who believes in “hell”\n\nOn a lonely outpost on Mars\n\nthe astronaut practices “speech”\n\nas alien to primates below\n\nas mute stars winking high, out of reach.\n\nAnd his words fall as bright and as chill\n\nas ice crystals on Kilimanjaro―\n\nfar colder than Jesus’s words\n\nover the “fortunate” sparrow.\n\nAnd I understand how gentle Emily\n\nfelt, when all comfort had flown,\n\ngazing into those inhuman eyes,\n\nfeeling zero at the bone.\n\nOh, how can I grok his arctic thought?\n\nFor if he is human, I am not.\n\nKeywords/Tags: sonnet, sonnets, meter, rhythm, music, musical, rhyme, form, formal verse, formalist, tradition, traditional, romantic, romanticism, rose, fire, passion, desire, love, heart, number, numbers, mrbson"
