        "text": "In this paper we present three artists of Brazilian experimental music scene, working with women's inclusion in the field. Natacha Maurer and Renata Roman produce, since December 2015, a series of concerts called Dissonant, where female participation has to be at least fifty per cent of all artists. Vanessa de Michelis ministers since 2013 workshops for \"stage assembly do-it-yourself\" for women and lesbians. We try to point the profile of this field, demonstrating the importance of the work that these three artists / composers have developed especially through the launch of other women in this, but also for its own artistic and pedagogical work (in the case of Vanessa), mainly in the present political moment in Brazil, characterized by an institutional coup that was forged from old marks that are still very current in Brazilian society such as misogyny, sexism, elitism and racism. We use the notion of field developed by Pierre Bourdieu, and references as Georgina Born and Rosane Borges. For writing the paper we interviewed the composers/creators and important producers in the field. We also analysed documental sources like concert programs, CD's inserts and concerts calls on the internet.\n\nFollowing the news of the death of Prince on 21 April 2016, it was not long before iconic buildings and landmarks around the world were lit up in purple as the world mourned. It was as if the color purple had assumed a new and greater significance. We knew his music would live forever."
