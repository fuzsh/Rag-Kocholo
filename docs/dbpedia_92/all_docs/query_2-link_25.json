        "text": "\"Mockumentary\" on '60s diva Jackie Washington (Jenifer Lewis), whose ancestors were George Washington's slaves. Lewis is our leading lady with an incredible singing voice. Jackie is planning her comeback tour coinciding with Edward Whatsett St. John (Tim Curry) as her interviewer. Famous faces are dishing the dirt on her, including Bette Midler, Whoopi Goldberg, David Hyde Pierce, and Chris Rock.\n\nTwenty-six years after the release of the original Rutles documentary, famous artists, actors, and musicians speak out on how the Rutles influenced them.\n\nA guy makes a documentary of the rap band CB4 by following them. CB4 got popular by stealing Gusto's name, background and image. He wants them dead.\n\nSpinal Tap, having put Stonehenge on the map in their legendary song about the world heritage site, pay their first visit to the monument. As if drawn by some primal, magnetic force, Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins and Derek Smalls set out on a pilgrimage to this ancient site. The silent song of these mysterious lithic Sirens inspires the distinguished artistes to make a trans-generational house-call.\n\nA mockumentary chronicling the rise and fall of NWH, a not particularly talented--or particularly bright but always controversial--hip-hop group.\n\nThe band that was profiled in This Is Spinal Tap (1984) makes another final reunion. After all, it's rock'n'roll.\n\nMockumentary captures the reunion of 1960s folk trio the Folksmen as they prepare for a show at The Town Hall to memorialize a recently deceased concert promoter.\n\nA band of rogue DJs that captivated Britain, playing the music that defined a generation and standing up to a government that wanted classical music, and nothing else, on the airwaves.\n\nThe true-life story of Darby Crash, who became an L.A. punk icon after getting kicked out of high school and forming The Germs with a collection of friends who have little experience with their instruments or playing music.\n\nA rock singer is determined to rise to the top of the profession, letting nothing stand in the way of that goal.\n\nNada, a beautiful French journalist on assignment in New York, records the life and work of an up and coming punk rock star, Billy. Soon she enters into a volatile relationship with him and must decide whether to continue with it, or return to her lover, a fellow journalist trying to track down the elusive Andy Warhol.\n\nThe cream of New York new wave/punk filmed live at CBGB's when the scene was just beginning. Includes performances by Patti Smith, Blondie, Television, the Ramones, Talking Heads, the Heartbreakers, the Shirts, Wayne County, the Marbles, the Dolls, Miamis, Harry Toledo, and the Tuff Darts (w/Robert Gordon).\n\nThe media and disaffected teens mistake the acerbic rants of an obnoxious teenage punk rocker as a rallying cry for the women of America, launching her and her talentless group to national stardom.\n\nA teenage girl, with dreams of becoming a famous singer, tries to secure a spot on a local televised talent show."
