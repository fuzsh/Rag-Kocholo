        "text": "I realize that this list is going to be controversial. After all, there are hundreds of bands that could be picked for this list. Me, I’m only picking ten. Yes, I could have picked your favorite. It wasn’t with any bad intent. It may have even been ignorance on my part. Actually, make your own list. Send it to me. I’d be happy to feature it here on the site.\n\n1. The Hong Kong Cavaliers from The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension: Few movies have made as big an impact on me as this one. There’s such a great scene in this movie where the band is playing and Buckaroo halts their raucous rock and roll to ask, “Is there somebody crying?” That’s a rock star. It’s even better that Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno Nevada, Pecos and New Jersey (he doesn’t perform in the movie, but claims to “play a mean piano”) all double as adventurers.\n\n2. Eddie & The Cruisers from Eddie & The Cruisers and Eddie & The Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!: The movie of Eddie Wilson’s band flopped on release, but found new life on cable and thanks to the success of John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band’s song “On the Dark Side.” It’s a tribute to what director Martin Davidson feelings on the last thirty years of rock and roll. Let’s forget that this late 50’s band sounds like Bruce Springsteen and concentrate on how great this movie — and their music within it — is.\n\n3. Dragon Sound from Miami Connection: Has there ever been a better brand of multiethnic orphans who all do martial arts and then play synth rock? No. There has not.\n\nFriends through eternity, loyalty, honesty.\n\nWe’ll stay together, through thick or thin.\n\nFriends forever, we’ll be together.\n\nWe’re on top ’cause we play to win.\n\n4. Sing Street from Sing Street: I haven’t seen a movie — nor a band within — that best expresses the 1980’s longing for love and music video fame so perfectly as Sing Street. Of course, Conor starts a band to impress a girl. But he also grows closer to his brother, learns about music beyond just what is on Top of the Pops and finds his own confidence and rebellion. And yeah — he gets the girl.\n\n5. Steel Dragon in Rock Star: Yeah, this retelling of Tim “Ripper” Owens joining Judas Priest is only so-so. But the band — made up of Jeff Pilson from Dokken, Jason Bonham and Zakk Wylde can’t be beat. Oh yeah — McNulty from The Wire is in it too!\n\n6. The Carrie Nations from Beyond the Valley of the Dolls: Quite literally the very first band I put on this list, the band that Russ Meyer and Roger Ebert batshit insane not-a-legal-sequel revolves around is my favorite movie band of all time. “The oft-times nightmarish world of Show Business” is tough. But it ain’t as tough as The Carrie Nations.\n\n7. The Blues Brothers from The Blues Brothers: Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi went from blues rock dilettantes before they debuted this act on Saturday Night Live. By the time their album, Briefcase Full of Blues, and John Landis directed comedy hit the big screen, they’d formed a legit supergroup with members of Booker T and the MGs, the Bar-Kays and Blood, Sweat and Tears, with guest appearances by Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles.\n\n8. The Fabulous Stains from Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains: There are movie punks. And then there are The Fabulous Stains, rising up against the bitter nothingness of their Pennsylvania steel town only to learn that it’s really no fun to be a rock band on the road. Sure the ending is way too bright, but this movie is everything. Oh, and let’s not forget the Looters, with actor Ray Winstone, which is actually the Professionals, featuring guys from the Clash. Oh, and Metal Corpses, which is actually Fee Waybill and the Tubes.\n\n9. DEATHGASM from Deathgasm: Much like Sammi Curr in Trick or Treat, for the members of DETHGASM, Rikki Daggers is the key to the dark powers of Hell. As a metalhead who repeatedly endured torture in grade and middle school, this movie speaks to me on a level that I can’t even convey. This is why you really start a band — to get eldritch abilities.\n\n10. The Juicy Fruits/The Beach Bums/The Undeads in Phantom of the Paradise: Crossing through each decade of pop music, this same band keeps appearing in DePalma’s masterstroke. Their song “Goodbye, Eddie, Goodbye” is a savage indictment of the music industry and its stars, like little Eddie Mitty who killed himself to not only save his sister’s life, but to become an angel in the eyes of the record buying public. It’s also catchy as hell.\n\nAlso, we couldn’t just keep this to ten bands.\n\n11. Spinal Tap from This Is Spinal Tap: Spinal Tap achieved the impossible. For a movie that so willingly slaughters the reputation of metal bands, it was wholeheartedly embraced by the very bands — and their audiences — that it took the piss on. I’ve watched this movie literally hundreds of times — and listened to their albums many times more — and always discover new joys within.\n\nSo many people jumped in on an initial Facebook post about this topic — 136 comments — that I decided to let them help out. Thanks to everyone for pitching in and I’ve given you credit below. Here are just a few of the bands that they mentioned.\n\n“Asian” Dan Hooven: The Lone Rangers from Airheads (also mentioned by Bill Comer). Allan Stallard also brought up The Sons of Thunder in this same movie, who were played by the band The Galactic Cowboys.\n\nBrian Lengyel: CB4 from CB4.\n\nRob Brown: Uptown Girl from Stepbrothers.\n\nAnd DuJour from Josie and The Pussycats (and yes, Adam Cicco, they count as a band too).\n\nAnd Rob was on a big roll, we so mentioned Dewey Cox from Walk Hard.\n\nKen Cellupica: Wyld Stallyns from Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure and Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey (also mentioned by Adam Cicco and Dave Sutkowski).\n\nRemy LaVey: Cassandra from One Crazy Summer.\n\nEmily Fear: The Sleez Sisters from Times Square.\n\nShe also mentioned Loveburger from Can’t Hardly Wait.\n\nDarryl Grandy: The Oneders from That Thing That You Do!\n\nHe also mentioned NWH from Fear of a Black Hat.\n\nTed Williams (who is a legit rock star and was in Pittsburgh metal legends Eviction): The Mystery from Satisfaction.\n\nHe also brought up the band in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which is Reeves Nevo & The Cinch. That’s David Brandt, the ex-husband of director Amy Heckerling, as the frontman.\n\nPS – Ted kind of goes above and beyond just writing in — he’s also an actor and has appeared on numerous TV shows like Gotham. Here he is, on the left, on the show The Outsiders as part of the Shay Mountain Band.\n\nJesse Forney: Stillwater from Almost Famous (also mentioned by Anthony Ruttgaizer).\n\nAnthony Urias: Another band from Stepbrothers, Boats ‘n’ Hoes.\n\nAnthony Ruttgaizer: The Soggy Bottom Boys from O Brother, Where Art Thou?\n\nThe Ruttles from All You Need Is Cash (also mentioned by Jesse Forney).\n\nSex Bob-omb from Scott Pilgrim vs The World.\n\nCrucial Taunt from Wayne’s World.\n\nRandy Watson and Sexual Chocolate from Coming to America (Bill DeJoseph also mentioned them).\n\nThe Barbusters from Light of Day (KenBurch also brought these guys up; look for a young Trent Renzor in the other band The Problems in this film; also Anthony raised the issue of how many fake bands Michael McKean has been in).\n\nAnd he also mentioned Otis Day and the Knights from Animal House, who went on to be a real band.\n\nAndy Stowell: The Ain’t Rights from Green Room.\n\nHe also mentioned Hedwig and the Angry Inch from the film of the same name.\n\nAnd That’s My Bike from Reality Bites.\n\nAdam Cicco: Marvin Berry & the Starlighters from Back to the Future.\n\nAnd he also brought up Citizen Dick from Singles.\n\nDave Sutkowski: Sonic Death Monkey from High Fidelity.\n\nBill DeJoseph: Jimmie Moore from The Wedding Singer.\n\nPaul Andolina: Easy Action playing Solid Gold in Blood Tracks.\n\nMike McBeth: Figrin D’an and the Modal Nodes from Star Wars.\n\nPatty Panico (Sam’s mom!): The Commitments from The Commitments.\n\nThe Sorels in Streets of Fire (you can also mention Ellen Aim and the Attackers).\n\nAnd speaking of Michael Paré from Streets of Fire, he returns from his work in Eddie and the Cruisers as religious rocker Colin Gramercy in Raging Angels.\n\nFinally, hey — I almost forgot Jesus and the Brides of Dracula from Under the Silver Lake.\n\nAnd Bogart Peter Stuyvesant (real life musician Jordan Christopher), the faux-Jim Morrison in Angel, Angel Down We Go.\n\nAnd, we can’t forget the lost Third Dimension from the lost, 1983 rock flick, Rock ‘N’ Roll Hotel featuring Judd Nelson and Rachel Sweet.\n\nDoes anyone remember the Banana Convention? It was Greg Brady’s first band — before the Silver Platters and before the Brady Six “broke up” for Greg to “fit the suit” for the new Johnny Bravo. The band never performs in the episode “Where’s There’s Smoke” (January 1971), but we do get to hear Greg’s song “Till I Met You” (yes, the clowns and beanstalks song). From left: that’s Johnny and Phil (actors Robert Jayson Kramer and Gary Marsh on guitar/bass, we think) and Tommy Johnson (drums), and Greg Brady. You need to know more? Then visit the awesome wordpress site, “Every Episode of the Brady Bunch Reviewed,” which provided the photo.\n\nDrummer Tommy Johnson, aka actor Craig Huxley, became a go-to keyboardist and synth player whose film score work includes Rocky (1976), Battlestar Galactica (1978) and Planet of the Apes (2001). Huxley’s IMDb bio makes for a fascinating read. Remember the “sound” of V’ger in Star Trek: The Motion Picture? That’s Craig . . . and his invention, known as “The Blaster Beam” (You Tube). Speaking of Star Trek: that’s Huxley acting in the third season of ST: TOS “And the Children Shall Lead.”\n\nAnd it all began with the Banana Convention. Rock, on Tommy Johnson. Rock on. And Greg Brady is still rockin’ in 2021 with the Barry Williams and the Traveliers with “My Home Town.”\n\nThe BIG ONE is . . . the infamous Sacrifyx who perished after completing their album, The Dark Book, that, when played backwards, can open the gates of hell, in The Gate.\n\nAnd our thanks to Malcolm Frank Thompson of Melbourne, Australia’s 98.7 RPP FM (be sure to check out his ’60s progressive rock retro-show “Under a Paisley Sky”), after reading our list, reminded us we forgot Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx fronting Arsenal in Rock of Ages.\n\nAnd, one of the best-written faux bands — with one of the best original soundtracks — comes courtesy of one of the first reviews R.D Francis came to write for the site: The Relentless from American Satan.\n\nThen, in the mother of all lists of fake bands from movies, I turned to my friend R.D Francis, who has written all manner of articles on metal bands in movies and 70’s soft-mainstream rock.
