Display in\n\nnine point monaco font.>\n\nFUNHOUSE! is dedicated to whatever happens to be on my mind at the time that\n\nI'm writing. The focus will tend to be on those aspects of our fun filled\n\nworld that aren't given the attention of the bland traditional media, or\n\nwhich have been woefully misinterpreted or misdiagnosed by the same.\n\nFUNHOUSE! is basically a happy place, and thus the only real criteria I will\n\ntry to meet is to refrain from rants, personal attacks, and flames - and\n\nthus FUNHOUSE! is an apolitical place. Offbeat films, music, literature,\n\nand experiences are largely covered, with the one stipulation being that\n\narticles are attempted to be detailed and well documented, although this is\n\nno guarantee of completeness or correctness, so that the interested reader\n\nmay further pursue something which may spark her interest. Correspondence\n\nand contributions are thus encouraged, and any letters will by printed in\n\nfuture issues. Please send a short message to the above address, and\n\narrangements will be made for the submission of larger items. The only\n\nother item is that FUNHOUSE! is Free-Free-Freeware! PLEASE copy and\n\ndistribute as you wish; however please do not alter any text. I will be\n\nhappy to try to clarify anything contained herein, and to provide additional\n\ninformation if I can, so don't hesitate to contact me.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n* Letters, Commentary, and Other Stuff You'll Probably Skip Over\n\n* Three Italian Masters: Mario Bava, Sergio Leone, and Dario Argento\n\nDefy Hollywood Conventions.

FUNHOUSE! introduces a\n\nnew feature with this issue. Jeff Frentzen's column \"All-Night Video\n\nDrive-In\" debuts with its first edition of video tips from the outer reaches\n\nof sleazedom. Check it out so you know which obscurity to grab off of the\n\nhorror shelf at Vids-R-Us on your next trip. Jeff was also a great help in\n\ncontributing to the editing of this issue. Our Italian maestro feature\n\ncontinues with Part II - Argento. Only it's really only part II-A this time\n\nas the thing is such a monster that it's spread over two issues. Below, the\n\nfilms The Bird With the Crystal Plumage through Suspiria are discussed along\n\nwith a complete filmography. FUNHOUSE! #5 will continue with Inferno\n\nthrough Trauma, will catalog the various video releases of Argento's films\n\n(and what is missing from them!), and will have a soundtrack discography.\n\nThis issue is rounded out with a look at the kings of trash/glam/pop/punk,\n\nthe former Red Cross and current Redd Kross. Included is an interview\n\nripped off from a 1982 issue of Flipside which shows the MacDonald bros\n\nattitude in its early stages of development, and an attempt at a (almost\n\ncertainly incomplete) discography. As there is a lot of material either in\n\nthe FUNHOUSE! can or in various stages of completion, you can count on the\n\nfollowing topics popping up sometime in the future in these electronic\n\npages: Argento part B, Sergio Leone, Davie Allan and the Arrows, Dr. Hunter\n\nS. Thompson, instro rock rundown, EC comics, sixties garage punk's greatest\n\nhits, and the FUNHOUSE! Top 100 albums of all time. And remember, if you're\n\na fan of the good not-so-clean fun found in FUNHOUSE!, make Blockbuster\n\nVideo your last resort, as once their takeover is complete they'll be making\n\nit a lot harder for you to track down the movies we hope to inspire you to\n\nsee.\n\nWhere did you get your copy of Metal Machine Music? Mine was had for $2.49\n\nfrom Peer Records in Cypress, CA sometime in 1980.\n\nFUNHOUSE! geetare player hall o' fame:\n\nLink Wray\n\nMick Jones (Clash)\n\nBob Mould (Husker Du, Sugar)\n\nJ.

I like the presentation of your entertaining, straightforward, no\n\nbullshit cyberzine. If you need a \"source\" for what's happening in the\n\nmedia, news, records, sports, film, etc. in Chicago let me know - I'd love\n\nto contribute! By the way last week we had a real humdinger of a bout! I'm\n\nsure you caught wind of it on the news - Donny vs. Danny ... Danny Bonaduce\n\ndefeated Donny Osmond in a three round decision...The rematch is in the\n\nworks!\n\nLater,\n\nBrian Mansfield\n\n[email protected]\n\n**********************************\n\nDear Jeff,\n\nThanks for FUNHOUSE #3. The Bava article is excellent, and you are right on\n\nabout Bava-Leone-Argento representing a radical break with cinematic norms,\n\nboth in terms of pure style and in the way style transforms the narrative.\n\nBava seems to me by far the most fascinating of the three directors (even\n\nthough none of his films, perhaps, is superior to ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE\n\nWEST) in exploring the way stylistic procedures affect the viewer's\n\nexperience of the film. I choose to address a marginal point. In\n\ndiscussing Bava's work on THE BATTLE/THE GIANT OF MARATHON, you imply that\n\n\"problems\" presumably attributable to Jacques Tourneur's direction led to\n\nBava's being called on to \"save\" the film. You might be interested in\n\nTourneur's version of the story. In interviews he gave to CAHIERS DU CINEMA\n\nand PRESENCE DU CINEMA, Tourneur said that he had an 8 (or 10) week contract\n\nfor the film. At the end of this period, because of the slowness of the\n\nItalian crew, all the dialogue scenes had been finished, but the underwater\n\nscenes and the race remained to be shot. Rather than pay Tourneur's\n\nexpensive day rate, the producers chose to have a second unit finish the\n\nfilm. Producer Bruno Vailati directed the race sequence, and he and Bava\n\ndirected the underwater scenes. Tourneur seems to have been ambivalent\n\nabout the whole affair - in one interview he says the results were better\n\nthan he could have done himself, but in the other he says \"Why should they\n\nhave kept me to shoot people fighting underwater or a guy running? Anybody\n\ncan shoot that.\" Incidentally, Tourneur praised Bava's photography and\n\nconsidered his miniatures the best he'd ever seen. Have you heard other\n\naccounts of the production of this film? (I know, I know - maybe it isn't\n\none of the most pressing issues confronting us, but considering all the\n\nwoodlands sacrificed to set straight who directed what part of GONE WITH THE\n\nWIND, maybe the GIANT OF MARATHON controversy is worth a kilobyte or two.)\n\nBest wishes,\n\nChris Fujiwara\n\n[email protected]\n\n**********************************\n\nHi Jeff,\n\nThanks for Funhouse #3's Bava article. As I haven't seen this mentioned\n\nanywhere before, maybe you'd like to know that the arrangement of the three\n\nstories in the German version of \"Black Sabbath\" is different from both the\n\nItalian/French and the AIP versions! In the German version the \"Wurdalak\"\n\ncomes first, the \"Drop of Water\" second and the \"Telephone\" last. I think\n\nthe underlying concept was to put the segments in chronological order: \"The\n\nWurdalak\" apparently takes place in the 18th or 19th century, \"The Drop of\n\nWater\" in the 1920s or 30s, and \"The Telephone\" in the 60s. Apart from the\n\norder there seems to be no difference between the German and the French\n\nversions (e.g. it has Nicolosi's score, Karloff's opening narration, the\n\nuncut \"gore\" in \"Wurdalak\", the uncensored dialogue in \"Telephone\", the\n\ncats' meows in \"Drop of Water\" are left intact - but there's no Karloff on\n\nhorseback at the end as in the Italian original).\n\nDave,\n\nPaul David Doherty\n\n[email protected]\n\n**********************************\n\nDear Mr. Dove:\n\n>Would someone PLEASE release Jonathan \"Silence of the Lambs\" Demme's first\n\n>movie, CAGED HEAT, on video? This film which also stars Erica \"Vixen\"\n\n>Gavin was produced by New World.\n\nIt *is* available... from Sultan Entertainment and New World Entertainment.\n\nThe Stainless Steel Moviegoer\n\n[email protected]\n\n**********************************\n\nHi there Jeff!\n\nI finally had the time to watch Baron Blood, the new uncut release. It runs\n\nabout 93,30 mins on PAL format, so add 4% to get the NTSC running time.\n\nThis version includes the original soundtrack and is Bava's original cut.\n\nPicture quality was excellent! The distributor (Redemption) is going to\n\nrelease some more Bava titles, so far they have released Mask of Satan, Five\n\nDolls for an August Moon (longer than previous releases!) and something\n\nelse. Next title will be Blood and Black Lace and then they're going to\n\nrelease at least two more titles. Rumors say that the other will be...\n\nYES! The Girl Who Knew Too Much! More details will follow, as soon as I\n\nhear something, I'm also looking for rare Bava titles from Greece, as it\n\nshould be easy to find 'em.\n\nJan Borgelin,\n\n[email protected]\n\n**********************************\n\nJeff,\n\nSome comments about your filmmography on Bava:\n\n>While THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH laid the groundwork for the giallo, the\n\n>film which most expertly introduces the elements which would come to define\n\n>that style is SEI DONNE PER L'ASSASSINO (aka BLOOD AND BLACK LACE, 1964).\n\n>Bava had previously explored the place of women in a patriarchal society in\n\n>BLACK SUNDAY, THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, and THE WHIP AND THE BODY, but the\n\n>idea of women being the objects of both a voyeuristic fetishism and the\n\n>victims of punishment for this role by men is most completely developed in\n\n>this effort.\"\n\nI guess you mean this in a narrow context of Bava's film. I may be hard put\n\nto find something as explicit and Blood and Black Lace before 1964, but\n\nwomen as \"voyeuristic fetishism and victims of punishment\", surely that was\n\nnot new to film? I mean there must be thousands of examples in film world\n\nwide before 1964. The only thing I really note that is different is Bava's\n\napproach is more like the latter day Grand Guignol theater...For instance\n\none remembers Roger Vadim's erotic violence with Brigitte Bardot in EN CASE\n\nDE MALHEUR (1957).\n\n[Indeed the comment did refer to Bava's work as he had been building to\n\nBABL's complete devotion to the theme in The Whip and the Body and Black\n\nSabbath. -JD]\n\n>He creates a series of highly developed and visually complex \"set pieces\"\n\n>where the principal function is not what will happen, but how it will be\n\n>carried out. Bava saw the story as written as a mundane crime drama, and\n\n>thus decided to use that story to convey something different altogether. If\n\n>the script as filmed were read it would still seem a bit trite, but in the\n\n>actual completed work the crimes are elevated to a level as to be the\n\n>elements around which it revolves. This is a film in which the images on\n\n>the screen far more convey the experience to the viewer than does the\n\n>narrative. The Italian title literally translates to \"Six Women for the\n\n>Murderer\", and accordingly the viewer is left with no question as to what\n\n>will happen through the first 80% of the movie. The story takes place in a\n\n>fashion salon where one of the models, who is involved in some scandalous\n\n>activities involving drugs and sex, is murdered. In the wake of the killing\n\n>it is discovered that she has kept a diary which may implicate some other\n\n>employees in various illicit activities. Their scrambling for control of\n\n>the diary allows for a background upon which one woman after another is\n\n>eliminated. Models are chosen as victims as they are beautiful and their\n\n>role in society is to be objects of adoration. While none of the victims is\n\n>herself involved in any killing, each is depicted as being tainted in some\n\n>way prior to meeting up with the villain. The story around the murderous\n\n>set pieces is intentionally bland, filmed in a straightforward fashion and\n\n>being carried by a rather uneventful police investigation.\n\nYes but then this could be the framing of almost any European film that fits\n\nthe B-film style of classification. Outside of top film artists, thrillers\n\nand horror films from Italy, France, and Spain in particular have a kind of\n\ndaffy detachment. A kind of indifference to the narrative and composition,\n\nbut still with things carried along with a degree of competence. (Here in\n\nthe US there seems to be a dichotomy, either the B film maker shows a degree\n\nof invention and skill or they seem total incompetents!) Of course, as you\n\nsay those parts of the story that excite Bava's imagination are more\n\ncreatively done.\n\n>When the set pieces begin however things shift into stylistic overload. An\n\n>opening sequence in which the credits role against a background of a skull\n\n> and flashing colored lights sets the style. When a murder scene takes place\n\n>the soundtrack heats up, the sets become complexly and colorfully lit, and\n\n>the settings used are intricately designed. The camera becomes fluid as it\n\n>lingers and then tracks and pans through the decor. Color schemes are\n\n>complex and the extended scenes are constructed to not only highlight the\n\n>beauty of the women, who are fully made up and in their best model garb, but\n\n>also to develop a sense of cinematic beauty. This is of course directly in\n\n>contrast with the fact that a violent and horrible murder is being\n\n>approached. There is no question in the audience's mind as to what will be\n\n>the end result of the scene being viewed, yet they are still asked to be\n\n>aesthetically pleased as it unfolds. After introducing this style Bava even\n\n>indulges in a bit of subterfuge with his viewers. One model enters into her\n\n>home, which has not yet been shown. As a dark coated figure is seen hunched\n\n>over the fireplace with its back to us the music becomes animated and\n\n>amplified, the room has a darkly lit look, and the camera zooms in. We are\n\n>set for violence, when the figure is revealed to be the elderly woman\n\n>housekeeper. After the false alarm the more conventional, brighter lit,\n\n>style returns. While void of any nudity or of much blood, the killings are\n\n>still carried out in gruesome and torturous fashion, and the victims are\n\n>often posed provocatively, and reveal skin and undergarments while the act\n\n>is being executed.\n\nNow what I think is the most extraordinary aspect of the film. Bava must\n\nhave gone to the Grand Guignol before it closed in Paris in 1965. One\n\nrecalls that Paris theater (dating from the 18th century!) with its stage\n\nplays of the erotic and macabre. Alas it seems to be only remembered for\n\nits invention of 'gore-gore' stage effects. (In fact it is said film put an\n\nend to the Grand Guignol because it could do it better. One excludes the\n\nfact that the Grand Guignol also did 'straight' theater too, though I am not\n\nsure that survived into the late 50's and early 60's.) Above all by the\n\n50's and 60's the theater was doing plays of irony and sly retribution, and\n\nsometimes just arbitrary mayhem that contained always a strong element of\n\nerotic violence, sometimes without any gore at all. But always with\n\nvoyeurism and a strip tease demise for the lady characters. First and\n\nforemost though, this was conceived of as >pure< fantasy, not to be taken\n\nseriously... and certainly not to be taken as being misogynistic. (I am\n\nsure this would totally blow the minds of the \"politically correct\"\n\nnowadays, or at least go way way over their heads.) So we see this in Blood\n\nand Black Lace (though I don't know if Bava was a fan of the Grand Guignol\n\nor not.) The first murder and last murder are the best examples. The lady\n\nwho gets strangled in the park is one the strongest examples to erotic\n\nviolence in all of Bava's films. The murder is quite brutal but above\n\nall...elaborated. As a technical detail it has something I have never seen\n\nbefore or after in a film. After the woman is murdered the villain drags\n\nher wide eyed corpse off by her high heeled feet. Raincoat, skirt and\n\n>slip< ride above garter hosiery way above her panties. (It has happened in\n\nother genre films but the camera either cuts to a close up of the woman's\n\nface or just cuts away altogether.) A very interesting image of almost\n\ninadvertent eroticism. (I mention the slip because, in film, I sometimes\n\nthink women never wear slips.) Its also interesting, that though she is\n\nwearing fairly high fashion, she seems to be wearing it as everyday wear.\n\nI don't think anyone exposed full fashion hosiery the way Bava did in that\n\nscene within a macabre setting.\n\nThe only other images I can think of like this are the nosy lady reporter in\n\nthe film PIECES who gets killed on the water mattress where there is a lot\n\nof slow motion raised skirt action, and the strangulation at the start of\n\nCronenberg's THEY CAME FROM WITHIN. The last murder has a cute take of its\n\nown. The actual killing is not as elaborate, but the dark haired model is\n\nwearing a towel from the waist down, as if Bava was sort of mindful of\n\npossible censorship of this scene. But no, surprise! surprise! the\n\nassailant unwraps the towel from the dead lady exposing here legs and\n\npanties. (By the by this is the closest Bava comes to nudity in the film,\n\nthe white bra and panties become somewhat translucent in the water.)\n\n[actually there is full nudity in the Twitch of the Death Nerve and Five\n\nDolls for an August Moon - JD] Though there are close ups Bava always has\n\nmid-range shots so everything can be seen. It's strange how many times I\n\nhave seen the same kind of scene set up by somebody like Franco, Fulci or\n\nsomeone like them, only to blunt the eroticism with a close up only.\n\nAnother interesting anti-cliche (though it's not unusual in the European\n\nfilm) is that the women victims are NOT prostitutes or bimbos or teenagers.\n\nThey are sophisticated mature women. How different from the tiresome lineup\n\nthat came later in the slasher films from the US. I am not sure what\n\nhappened later to Bava's sense for this kind of erotic violence. It of\n\ncourse occurs again in BAY OF BLOOD. One especially notes the lady with her\n\nwhite turtleneck, skirt and boots who gets strangled. (Though for that one\n\nI always wondered if Bava shot a more 'leg-show' version that he never\n\nused.) I don't think I have seen his last film, but I do remember being\n\ndisappointed with FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON and HATCHET FOR THE\n\nHONEYMOON, unless there exist director's cuts of these films with stronger\n\neroticism. And I am not sure I have ever seen 'euro' versions of LISA AND\n\nTHE DEVIL and BARON BLOOD so I am not sure about those. Now I like Dario\n\nArgento for different reasons but I must admit I don't recall him having the\n\nsame eye for this kind of Grand Guignol striptease eroticism in his films.\n\nThere is some, but not to the degree of elaboration that Bava used. In fact\n\nBava's eye for this was unlike anyone else.\n\nAl Jackson,\n\nal.jackson@atomiccafe.com\n\n**********************************\n\nI liked FUNHOUSE! issues #1 and #2 a lot.

The Critics Balk! Part II-A - Argento\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Simply a director of incomparable incompetence\"\n\n- Vincent Canby on Dario Argento, from a New York Times review of Deep Red\n\nDario Argento's career definitely allows for his labeling as an auteur.\n\nWith a single exception his body of work consists of horror and crime\n\nthriller films, and that is probably the primary reason for his complete\n\nrejection by the motion picture establishment (at least in America) as any\n\nkind of \"serious\" filmmaker. However, rather than just being ignored by\n\nthose who feel that no sort of aesthetic can be achieved in an exploitation\n\nmovie, Argento has instead been rather viciously lambasted by the critics,\n\ncommentators, and pundits. Similar to his countrymen Sergio Leone and Mario\n\nBava (see FUNHOUSE! #3), Argento's films, while not unusual to Europeans,\n\nare made in an unconventional style by the standards the Hollywood system\n\nand its sycophants. These director's perspectives aren't entirely guided by\n\na strict adherence to narrative, and thus reviewers who don't recognize this\n\nlabel their works with descriptions such as \"confusing, \"unfocused\", and\n\n\"muddled\". The \"spaghetti western\" is still a pejorative to most American\n\nreviewers, even if they have come to appreciate the work of Leone over the\n\nyears. This largely hasn't been true for Bava or Argento.\n\nThe genres which they have chosen to work in compound this criticism. Leone\n\nis most famous for his westerns, and Bava, who worked within a wide range of\n\nexploitation themes, for his horror titles. With the crime thrillers/murder\n\nmysteries mostly created by Argento these are all areas of film where\n\nconventions are well established and paradigms are usually strictly adhered\n\nto in any studio film. The western movie paradigm is exclusively American\n\nin origin, and while the crime and horror genres have plenty of precedent in\n\nEurope (as well as elsewhere, but these directors are Italians and so\n\nEuropean influences are of primary importance), there has been established\n\nthrough the Universal/Monogram/ Republic thrillers of the thirties and\n\nforties, and the film noir/detective stories of the forties and fifties,\n\ncertain expectations as to what is a correct methodology.\n\nThese director's films aren't motivated completely by a need to reach a\n\nconclusion which will answer some question established early in the story,\n\nand so not every scene is constructed to further the narrative in a linear\n\nfashion and in the direction of that ultimate goal. Thus when sections of a\n\nfilm are created to be pleasing in their own right, separate from the\n\nfurtherance of the story, or when they serve to add to an overall subtextual\n\nmessage, the critics respond negatively. When established routines in genre\n\nfilms are not adhered to their venom is further unleashed. The most staid\n\nof these conservative establishments, the Motion Picture Academy, seemed to\n\nbe showing signs of a changing attitude when for two years running they gave\n\ntheir best picture award to American projects which are closely related\n\nstylistically to the films of Leone and Argento. Jonathan Demme's all\n\naround excellent The Silence of the Lambs (1991) has many elements in common\n\nwith an Argento film, and while Clint Eastwood's imperfect The Unforgiven\n\n(1992) might actually be more of a lifetime achievement award for the\n\nactor/director (there's precedent for this in John Wayne's best actor award\n\nfor True Grit [1969] and Paul Newman's for The Color of Money [1986]) it's\n\nencouraging that a film of its style was recognized. As far as I'm\n\nconcerned, Eastwood's best director award is in fact an award for Leone,\n\nwhose films not only created the style mimicked by The Unforgiven (most\n\nnotably his Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo [aka The Good, The Bad, and The\n\nUgly, 1967] and C'era una Volta il West [aka Once Upon a Time in the West,\n\n1968] but made a star out of Eastwood. Those two consecutive awards were an\n\nenigma, however, for an organization which really only considers heavy\n\nhanded dramas or pseudo-historical epics for their top honor. I don't\n\ndirect the \"pseudo\" label to last year's Schindler's List, but there's\n\nplenty of evidence for its accuracy in past winners such as Amadeus, Ghandi,\n\nand The Last Emperor (made by Leone and Argento cohort Bernardo Bertolucci).\n\nNote that it took Spielberg's moving away from genre films, even if only his\n\nfairytale versions of them, and into comfortable territory for the Academy\n\nvoters before they could be persuaded to honor their top moneymaker. And\n\nDemme, the director of not only Silence of the Lambs but also Caged Heat\n\n(1974) and Stop Making Sense (1984), seems to have moved into a style more\n\nto the establishment's liking with his latest release, Philadelphia.\n\nThe subject of dubbing should also be briefly addressed. Frequently the\n\nfilms of all three men, as well as many other European directors, are\n\ncriticized for their \"bad dubbing\". All of Argento's films up to Opera\n\n(1987), and all of Leone's westerns, were filmed silent and then post-dubbed\n\nin a sound studio. This was a common practice in Italian cinema. Many of\n\nthe higher budgeted films had a mixture of American stars (Charles Bronson,\n\nKarl Malden, Jessica Harper) with a supporting cast of Italians and other\n\nEuropeans. Often the actors would not be able to speak the same language\n\nand would deliver their lines in their native tongues. This made direct\n\nsound recording impractical, and as the films needed to also be made in\n\nEnglish for foreign distribution, dubbing after shooting was already\n\nnecessary. Usually the voice you hear on the soundtrack is not that of the\n\nactor, if his or her primary language is different from that which you are\n\nhearing the film in. Many times the same voice actor provided the dialog\n\nfor a number of characters. The post-dubbing process creates a noticeably\n\ndifferent look, and as it is one not familiar to Americans used to Hollywood\n\nproduct, this often is interpreted as a quality of a bad film.\n\nDario Argento came from a filmmaking family, which was almost a necessary\n\nprerequisite for penetrating Italy's production system at the time he began.\n\nHis father Salvatore Argento was a producer, and served that function on\n\nDario's first four films. He was forced to intervene to save Argento's\n\nposition as director on the first, The Bird With the Crystal Plumage.\n\nArgento worked as a film critic for Paese Sera, a Rome newspaper, and from\n\nthere his break into the world of actual filmmaking came when he and\n\nBertolucci co-wrote the story for Once Upon a Time in the West. A prolific\n\nfew years followed as the writer on a number of Italian films in then\n\npopular genres such as western (Cimitero Senza Croci aka Cemetary Without\n\nCrosses, 1968), war (La Legione dei Dannati aka Legion of the Damned, 1969)\n\nand softcore (La Rivoluzione Sessuale aka The Love Circle, 1968). When\n\ngiven the opportunity to direct on his own, in 1970, he abandoned all of\n\nthese styles in favor of one which drew upon his literary influences, Edgar\n\nWallace, Cornell Woolrich, and especially Edgar Allan Poe, and his film\n\ninfluences, most notably Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang, and Mario Bava.\n\nBrother Claudio was brought in as producer after his father stepped aside,\n\nand he performed those duties on the films Deep Red through Tenebrae, and\n\nthen again on Two Evil Eyes. Claudio Argento's most well known work not\n\nwith his brother is as the producer and co-writer of Alejandro Jodorowsky's\n\nSanta Sangre (1990). Argento surrounds himself with regular assistants and\n\ncollaborators. Partner Daria Nicolodi co-wrote Suspiria and Inferno and\n\nappeared in Deep Red, Suspiria (very briefly), Inferno, Tenebrae, Phenomena,\n\nand Opera. Mario Bava's son Lamberto Bava carved out a directorial career\n\nof his own after assisting his father back to 1965, and then later Argento\n\nwho produced and co-wrote his Demoni (aka Demons, 1985) and Demoni 2 (aka\n\nDemons 2, 1986). The first of these features Argento's daughter Fiore, who\n\nhe utilized himself in Phenomena, while the latter stars his other daughter\n\nAsia, who later would appear in Argento's own Trauma. Michele Soavi is\n\nanother assistant director who eventually stepped out on his own as a\n\nprinciple director. He created the documentary Dario Argento's World of\n\nHorror (1985), which provides interviews with its subject and behind the\n\nscenes looks at the creation of Suspiria, Tenebrae, Phenomena, and Demons,\n\nand has footage from most of the other titles. It is a valuable source for\n\nAmericans for some scenes edited out of releases here. Soavi directed the\n\nArgento produced and co-written La Chiesa (aka The Church, 1989 - originally\n\nDemons 3!) and La Setta (aka The Sect, 1991) as well as other Argento\n\ninfluenced films such as The Bloody Bird (aka Stagefright, 1988). Luigi\n\nCozzi served as a co-writer with Argento dating back to Four Flies on Grey\n\nVelvet and also did some work as an assistant director. While none of his\n\nown projects directly involve his mentor creatively, he did create a follow\n\nup documentary to World of Horror titled Dario Argento: Master of Horror\n\n(1990), and his 1982 film The Black Cat is an homage to his pal. What began\n\nas Cozzi's attempt to complete the Three Mothers Trilogy, the first two\n\nparts being Suspiria and Inferno, shifted to a story about a director of\n\nhorror films preparing to make a film, starring his wife in her usual\n\nleading role, based on the story of the Three Mothers. A witch becomes\n\nangered by this and seeks revenge. It even contains dialog referring to\n\nArgento and Suspiria by name.\n\nMuch will be said in describing Argento's style in the discussions of\n\nindividual films that follow. There are however some common themes present\n\nthroughout. An obsession with perception permeates, both on the part of a\n\nfilm's characters and thus by extension the audience. This relationship to\n\nthe audience is more than indirect, as Argento strives to put them into a\n\nposition of participating in his films. This is accomplished most obviously\n\nthrough point of view shots which allow the viewer to psychologically assume\n\nthe role of the killer. This technique is not unfamiliar today, being\n\nutilized successfully in John Carpenter's Argento influenced Halloween\n\n(1978), which then served as the influence for many \"slasher\" films which\n\nfollowed. While Argento uses this technique successfully he also employs\n\nmore intricate methods. Subtextual elements apart from the main storyline\n\nplay on the audience's psyche to provide them with a link to the action. A\n\ncommon narrative theme has the protagonist struggling to make sense of some\n\npuzzling bit of information that he or she has glimpsed, and in parallel to\n\nthat theme the viewer is introduced to all sort of clues, messages, notions,\n\nand ideas that he is asked to evaluate, ponder, or interpret.\n\nNot only are these films complex in plot, but they are so cinematically as\n\nwell. They are all very carefully constructed, and each scene is very\n\nintricately designed. Along with Mario Bava's pioneering work on the giallo\n\nfilm in general, this is another area where the influence of his work on\n\nArgento is evident. The films are very stylistic in their execution, making\n\ngreat use of camera angle and movement, of art and set direction, of sound\n\nand score, and of editing. Bava, who was a trained painter, considered the\n\nlook of his films to be important to their overall quality, and he treated\n\nthe visual content of a narrative film as being central to its success.\n\nThis attitude was adopted by Argento. His films are loaded with elaborate\n\nshots utilizing highly mobile cameras, which often record action from very\n\nextreme or improbable positions. Argento has said that he likes to present\n\nhis audience with perspectives which couldn't be had from a person in the\n\nworld of the film, and thus the camera will explore and emphasize elements\n\nof the mise en scene from areas where no one in the film could be. By\n\nimplication a film which has been described as not being primarily motivated\n\nby narrative must rely on other factors.\n\nIn Argento's films colors, locales, and especially the soundtrack all\n\ncontribute to the message. All of these pieces are put together to create a\n\nsense of the materialization of a bad dream, and the situations which the\n\ncharacters find themselves in could be seen as a realization of their worst\n\nnightmares. Argento has stated that many of his inspirations come to him in\n\ndreams, and it is this experience that he tries to project to his audience.\n\nA curious aspect to his tactics is that the knife wielding, black gloved\n\nhands seen on camera are usually Argento's. He has said that he can best\n\nachieve the effect he desires from his images of violence. As the depth of\n\nArgento's films offer some of their most enjoyable aspects much can be said\n\nin analyzing them. As I decide to do so liberally in this article space\n\nrequires that it be divided into two parts. Section A follows and covers\n\nwork from Bird With the Crystal Plumage (1970) through Suspiria (1977).\n\nFUNHOUSE! #5 will pick up with part B, which will cover Inferno (1980)\n\nthrough Trauma (1992). Section A includes a complete filmography while\n\nsection B will be accompanied by a soundtrack discography and an American\n\nvideography, which will make an attempt to detail the extensive editing done\n\nto Argento's films here, and will provide information as to the various\n\nversions available on video. Each section is followed by the complete\n\nreference list.\n\nArgento was approached to direct a film in 1970, and with this opportunity\n\nthe former writer/critic departed from the western and war genres in which\n\nhe had been working in his previous endeavors. Instead, Argento reflected\n\nback on the personal influences previously mentioned: Edgar Allan Poe,\n\nAlfred Hitchcock, Edgar Wallace, Fritz Lang, and especially Mario Bava. The\n\nItalian take on the crime thriller was just starting to emerge as a major\n\ntheme. It was then represented by such titles as Giulio Questi's La Morte\n\nha Fatto L'Uovo (aka Death Laid an Egg, 1967), Antonio Margheriti's\n\nNude...Si Muore (aka The Young, the Evil, and the Savage, 1967), Massimo\n\nDallamano's La Morte Non ha Sesso (aka Death has No Sex, 1968), and\n\nespecially Bava, who was in the midst of creating a trio of the murderous\n\ndramas in succession. These were Il Rosso Segno Della Follia (aka A Hatchet\n\nFor the Honeymoon, 1969), Cinque Bambole Per la Luna D'Agosto (aka Five\n\nDolls For an August Moon, 1970), and Ecologia del Delitto (aka Twitch of the\n\nDeath Nerve aka Bay of Blood and numerous other retitlings, 1971). Bava had\n\ndefined this field structurally with his La Ragazza che Sapeva Troppo (aka\n\nThe Girl Who Knew too Much aka The Evil Eye, 1963) and stylistically with\n\nSei Donne per L'Assassino (aka Blood and Black Lace, 1964). All of these\n\ninfluenced the novice director's effort, and all would eventually add to\n\nArgento's own distinct, manic, style upon its reaching maturity. However\n\nhis initial effort LUUCCELLO DALLE PIUME DI CRISTALLO (aka The Bird With the\n\nCrystal Plumage, 1970) is his most conventional project.\n\nFor The Bird with the Crystal Plumage Argento surrounded himself with film\n\nveterans, including father Salvatore as producer and cinematographer\n\nVittorio Storaro. The story is a derivative of Frederic Brown's \"The\n\nScreaming Mimi,\" which it follows closely. Bird stars Tony Musante as Sam\n\nDalmas, a down on his luck American writer plodding through Rome in an\n\nattempt to regain some direction to his career. He has been undergoing\n\nextensive writer's block, and the only work he can come across is ghost\n\nwriting an ornithological text for a biologist friend. Dalmas is\n\nimmediately portrayed as a unlikeable guy. Upon being paid for his work on\n\nthe bird book he gruffly rejects a copy, stating that his check is all that\n\nhe wants. With money in hand he and his Italian girlfriend Julia (played by\n\nSuzy Kendall) prepare to leave for the US, but on his trip home from being\n\npaid he stumbles across an event that alters his plans significantly.\n\nDalmas spots a struggle inside an art gallery. It's night and thus the\n\nblack clad man and the woman grappling are clearly visible to him from\n\nacross the street. Before he can rush over to get a closer look the man\n\nflees. The woman has a stab wound to her stomach, and a large ceiling to\n\nfloor glass door blocks him from entering to help. When he pushes a button\n\nto open this door a similar outer door closes behind him, and thus he is\n\ntrapped at the scene of the crime, able to be observed from both inside and\n\noutside of the building but not able to escape. His situation is emphasized\n\nby an encounter with a man on the street. When the camera in between the\n\nglass doors we hear Dalmas' frantic screams highly amplified on the\n\nsoundtrack, however when the camera takes the spectator's point of view\n\noutside we are overcome by the quiet as Dalmas tries to communicate the need\n\nfor the police. This is a more obvious example of a reoccurring set up in\n\nArgento's films.\n\nDalmas is an interloper who becomes trapped by a situation not of his\n\nmaking, and the story which follows is just as much about the effect of this\n\nevent on the psychological stability of his unbalanced character as it is\n\nabout the final resolution of what he has seen. The resolutions are often\n\npurposefully preposterous in order to more emphasize the events up to that\n\npoint - Argento is suggesting that the conclusion is not the most important\n\npart of the film. This methodology is pointed to most obviously in the\n\n\"animal trilogy.\" (Argento's first three films also include The Cat O' Nine\n\nTails and Four Flies on Grey Velvet. These relate to animals mostly in\n\ntitle only.) In each of these films the crime is solved with the use of\n\nsome extra-logical bit of pseudoscientific technology, thus again diverting\n\nattention away from the importance of the solution by reaching it through an\n\nexaggerated means. The writer Dalmas also carries the attribute of being\n\nartistically oriented, which is something common to protagonists in all of\n\nArgento's films, as they are in certain ways created to be extensions of the\n\ndirector himself.\n\nThe stabbing victim (Eva Renzi as Monica Ranieri) does not die, and when the\n\npolice arrive and rescue the witness from his cage he becomes a suspect in\n\nwhat appears to be a failed attempt by the perpetrator of a recent string of\n\nserial murder slashings. Dalmas has his passport confiscated and, at first\n\nvery unwillingly, is forced to stay in Rome while the criminal investigation\n\ncontinues. The police in Argento's films also will match a formula set down\n\nhere. They are dull, monotonous, and the viewer is given the impression\n\nthat they are not capable of providing the deeply analytical and logical\n\nthought required to solve the crime (and they never do). That skill is\n\nreserved for the artistic protagonist, if he can first overcome his own\n\nborderline madness. As the investigation continues, Dalmas and his\n\ngirlfriend become fascinated with the case. They dig up information on the\n\npast victims and begin to trace down leads. The writer becomes obsessed\n\nwith the mystery, and in the process his mental state is uplifted and he\n\ncomments on being able to produce his first bit of original, productive\n\nwriting in a long time. The message of an artist being stimulated in his\n\nwork by violence is to some degree a commentary on Argento himself.\n\nMeanwhile the murders continue. Dalmas receives threatening phone calls,\n\nand the stone faced and antagonistic husband of the gallery victim (Umberto\n\nRaho as Alberto Ranieri) emerges as his prime suspect. Argento throws the\n\nviewer some glaring evidence by showing Dalmas to figure out that Alberto\n\nmatches the description of the black clad man by way of his height and\n\nleft-handedness, and his attitude is hostile.\n\nDalmas continues with his investigation by looking into the previous\n\nvictims' circumstances, and he uncovers a grisly, child-like painting of a\n\nwoman being stabbed to death. The painting was sold by the killer's first\n\nvictim, who was a clerk in a curio shop, just before her murder. The\n\nkiller's motivation, which is always a major factor in Argento's films, is\n\nstarting to be revealed through piecemeal clues. The case is cracked by way\n\nof one of this story's examples of curious science. A phone threat to\n\nDalmas from the killer is captured on tape, and his bird studying friend is\n\nable to identify the strange sounds in the background as the squawk of a\n\nrare species which cannot survive naturally in the climate of Rome. The\n\nonly place that this bird exists locally is the zoo (it is in fact \"The Bird\n\nWith the Crystal Plumage\") and when Dalmas, the professor, Julia, and the\n\ncops investigate, the film's resolution is set up. Their attention is drawn\n\nto a room above the bird's cage by a woman's scream. When they reach the\n\nroom they find Alberto and Monica, the husband and wife art dealers,\n\nstruggling over a knife, in an image that mirrors the opening moments of the\n\nfilm. Alberto recoils from the police, refuses to drop the blade, and\n\nfinally plunges out the open window to his death. With his last breath he\n\nconfesses to the crimes. His story is accepted by the cops but Dalmas is\n\ntroubled, and when he realized that Monica has fled with Julia and the\n\nprofessor in pursuit he chases after them.\n\nNothing is exactly as it seems, neither at this time nor in the earlier\n\nstruggle. Dalmas follows Monica back to the gallery where the film's final,\n\neerie set piece takes place. As he nervously edges through a darkened room\n\nthe camera suspensfully peers into corners and crevices. The cinematography\n\nmakes it quite clear that danger lurks, and this feeling is confirmed when\n\nwe glimpse Julia bound and gagged under a bed as Dalmas walks by. The\n\nprofessor is found with a knife buried in his back, and then the guilty\n\nMonica emerges dressed in black. Dalmas pieces together the details of what\n\nhe has been struggling to remember about the events at the art gallery.\n\nWith his mental image now clear it is revealed that in the struggle he\n\nwitnessed while trapped between the doors he actually saw Alberto attempt to\n\ntake a knife away from Monica. She is the crazed serial killer, and she was\n\ninjured accidentally in that fight. Monica now has the upper hand on\n\nDalmas, and she drops a large, spiked sculpture on top of him, pinning him\n\nto the ground between its projections. The story has circled back on itself\n\nas its protagonist is again left trapped and impotent. Monica slashes at\n\nDalmas while taunting him in a maniacal voice that he is going to die,\n\nbefore the police arrive and save him by clubbing her from behind. The cops\n\ndidn't figure out the crime - Julia was able to escape and bring them to the\n\nrescue. A second bit of scientific nonsense serves as an epilog, when on a\n\nnews show discussing the case a still befuddled police inspector hands over\n\nits explanation of motive to a stuffy psychiatrist. The psychiatrist\n\npontificates that the act pictured in the painting resurrected some previous\n\ntrauma in Monica. She recalled her own victimization of a violent crime\n\nupon spotting it in the shop, and her psychosis triggered from the repressed\n\nmemories acted so that she came to identify with her attacker.\n\nThis film is the most straightforward of all of Argento's work, and is the\n\nmost reliant on plotting. While the plot is not subjugated to the mise en\n\nscene on a large scale, there are still some very dominant stylistic\n\nelements present. The most obvious are the incidents surrounding the\n\nmurders themselves. As was the case in Bava's influential Blood and Black\n\nLace, these depictions are not necessary to further the narrative, but are\n\nnevertheless created in a meticulous and drawn out manner so as to allow\n\nthem to convey sensations to the viewer apart from the story. The point of\n\nview shot is used, as it would be quite extensively in later works. The\n\nopening scenes are from the killer's perspective, and show her (gender and\n\nidentity are not known at the time) carefully going through her pre-murder\n\nritual. Photos of the next victim are studied, a weapon is chosen from a\n\ncollection of cutlery housed in an red cloth lined drawer, and the black\n\ngloved costume is flashed. The choice of victims helps motivate certain\n\ncritic's who label Argento as misogynistic. Like Bava's targets, they are\n\nall young, female, and visually appealing. No reason is given in the story\n\nfor this demographic, and in fact it is barely acknowledged, but it does\n\nallow for the creation of some deliberate sado-sexual tension. The viewer\n\nis put into the position of killer by the editing, and thus his own sexual\n\nneuroses are played upon. In one scene, which was trimmed in the US\n\nrelease, the killer confronts a victim who is dressed for bed. While the\n\nvictim screams in terror, writhing on the sheets, the knife hovers over and\n\naround her flesh in a phallic exploration. The part of the scene cut by the\n\nUS distributor shows the woman's underwear being sliced away from her body.\n\nThis level of explicit sexual content to a murder scene is only matched, and\n\nin fact is actually exceeded, in the very erotically violent Tenebrae.\n\nThere is a good deal of fluid camerawork on display, which is unusual to\n\nviewers of more conventional fare, however the playing with notions of\n\ncinematic space and the extreme use of visual effects, color, and sounds\n\nthat would appear in later Argento films are largely absent. Several more\n\nconventions of the director's work are established. The artistic\n\nprotagonist has been mentioned. The theme of an outsider catching a\n\nfleeting glimpse of some important clue, and then struggling throughout the\n\nstory to interpret it, would become common throughout Argento's filmography.\n\nHe often interjects bizarre, and even humorous, interludes which seem to be\n\nincluded for their own sake, and are only tangential to the principal\n\nmessage. These diversions within a multi-layered film frequently employ\n\nsingular ideas away from a larger context. An example in Bird is Dalmas'\n\npursuit of Monica's accomplice into a hotel convention room. After the\n\ncamera tracks up to a door, depicting the pursuer anxiously preparing to\n\nconfront the man, the door is flung open to reveal all of the conventioneers\n\ndressed identically, thus making identification of the fleeing individual\n\nimpossible. There is also a wacky visit to the key painting's artist, an\n\noffbeat guy who makes meals of his cats. The owner of the curio shop where\n\nthe first woman killed was employed is an obvious, openly gay character\n\nwhose sexuality is not directly related to any other events. Argento\n\nfrequently uses gay characters whose orientation is only germane on a\n\nsubconscious level. The image of a killer as black gloved and black garbed\n\nis also established. This convention, another with its roots in Bava's\n\nBlood and Black Lace, immediately defined the disposition of its bearer in\n\nthe giallo genre. It was picked up by just about every director in this\n\nfield by the seventies, Argento included.\n\nBird was distributed in America by Sidney Galzier who had a huge success\n\nwith it. It was also very profitable in Europe, and thus Argento was\n\nquickly established as a commercially viable filmmaker. Italian film\n\nmaestro Ennio Morricone provided a typical score, dense and with subtle\n\neffects, as he would for the second and third \"animal\" films.\n\nIn only his second film IL GATTO A NOVE CODE (aka The Cat O' Nine Tails,\n\n1971) Argento starts to move away from a strong adherence to narrative.\n\nWhile Bird With the Crystal Plumage was derived from an existing story, and\n\nthus demanded a certain degree of fidelity to it, Cat is an original story\n\nwritten by Argento with Luigi Collo and Dardano Sacchetti. It begins a\n\ntransition from a plot driven films to those in which plot serves as a\n\nframework in which to interweave other ideas, and eventually to those in\n\nwhich plot is only a necessary device to string together disparate elements,\n\nor where it is almost non existent (Suspiria and Inferno). Coexisting with\n\nthe de-emphasis of the narrative is an increase in other elements, such as\n\nusing the cinematography and editing to play with the viewer's perceptions,\n\nand disorienting the audience through carefully positioned manipulations of\n\nspace and time. Cat O' Nine Tails contains the common components of all of\n\nhis gialli, and coming in 1971 it thus begins to establish the iconography\n\nof his style, and also to a certain extent the iconography of the genre.\n\nExpected notions which came to be attached to these icons would in fact\n\nprovide opportunities for playing on audience perceptions in later projects.\n\nCat has a protagonist who stumbles across a clue which draws him into the\n\nworld of the criminal. The twist in this film is that there come to be two\n\nmain characters obsessed with uncovering the truth, and that the puzzle come\n\nacross by one of them is aural, as he is blind. Cat O' Nine Tails also\n\nmaintains the loose theme of the animal trilogy in that its eventual\n\nmotivation is based upon a bit of exaggerated science, however its title is\n\nthe most tenuous of the three, only coming from an observation that the nine\n\nleads to follow in reaching the single truth are like \"a cat with nine\n\ntails,\" a comment which is followed with the correction \"a cat o' nine\n\ntails, like the old navy whip.\"\n\nThe twin protagonists in Cat O' Nine Tails are blind ex-newspaperman Franco\n\nArno (Karl Malden) and working reporter Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus).\n\nBoth are drawn into the suspicious activities at The Terzi Institute, a\n\nGenetic Research facility. Arno has a strong desire for puzzle solving and\n\nhe passes his time creating crosswords. While walking past a parked car\n\nwith his pre-teen niece Lori, he by chance overhears one man inside say to\n\nanother \"I have no choice, I'm not interested in blackmailing you. I have to\n\npass on the information.\" This snippet of dialog is barely audible on the\n\nsoundtrack, but it is curious enough to intrigue the sightless, and by\n\nimplication more sound cognizant, Arno. Arno lives in an apartment behind\n\nthe Institute, and becomes drawn in further when he detects a scuffle\n\noutside his window later that night. In front of Terzi the next day\n\nreporter Giordani shows up to investigate a break-in the previous night.\n\nAfter being knocked over in Giordani's haste, Arno learns of the crime from\n\nthe reporter, which furthers his curiosity. A man is killed by an oncoming\n\ntrain and it is ruled an accident, but when Lori describes his picture in\n\nthe paper to Arno as being one of the men overheard in the car he becomes\n\nsuspicious and visits the author of the piece, who is Giordani. Giordani's\n\nphotographer partner had been at the train station awaiting the arrival of a\n\nstarlet and fortuitously shot the victim just as he was being hit by the\n\noncoming locomotive. Arno, suspicious from all that he knows, has Giordani\n\nget the photographer to print the full, uncropped photo, and visible on its\n\nedge is a fuzzy image of hands pushing the man. The photographer is slashed\n\nto death just after reporting back his finding, and subsequently the\n\nphotographic evidence is snatched by a black gloved person. The head of the\n\nInstitute, Professor Terzi, reports to the police that nothing was stolen in\n\nthe break-in, but we see one of the scientists, Dr. Calabresi, brag to his\n\nfiancee Bianca that he knows what has happened and is going to profit from\n\nit. Calabressi is the man pushed in front of the train.\n\nWith two murders now centered on the break-in, Arno and Giordani join forces\n\nto investigate the crimes. They question those surrounding the case; Terzi\n\nand his daughter Anna, Bianca, the German Dr. Braun, and Dr. Casoni, who\n\ninforms Giordani of the projects being worked on at the Institute. The two\n\nmain avenues of research he explains are the development of a genetically\n\nbased \"wonder drug,\" and work with the government on \"XYY syndrome,\" a\n\nchromosomal disorder in which those males who are born with it have a\n\ngreater propensity toward violence (editor's note: XYY Syndrome has in fact\n\nbeen studied and a higher percentage of XYY men are found to be criminals\n\nthan normal, XY men. There has also been documented a higher propensity\n\ntoward aggression and self gratification in these people.). Suspicious\n\ncircumstances surround all those who are associated with the Terzi\n\nInstitute. Professor Terzi has a far too close relationship with Anna, and\n\nGiordani learns through some snooping into Terzi's journal that the now\n\ntwentyish woman was adopted at age fourteen, and that Terzi has been lusting\n\nafter her. Bianca is shown to have been engaged to Calabressi only to get\n\naccess to information on the wonder drug in order to sell it to a rival\n\npharmaceutical firm. Her partner in the scheme is Dr. Braun, a high living\n\nand arrogant homosexual who hangs out at a club populated by transvestites.\n\nBianca knows who the killer is from what she learned from Calabressi and\n\nattempts to blackmail him herself. This decision causes her to wind up\n\ndead. When her scam with Braun is learned, the police leak his name as the\n\nmurder suspect to the papers before they arrest him, but he also winds up\n\ndead while trying to flee. The curious Arno and Giordani are next\n\nthreatened, and attempted to be killed, causing Arno to send away Lori for\n\nher safety. They deduce that Bianca hid her evidence in a locket which she\n\nwas buried with, and they invade her tomb to retrieve it. The murderer\n\nconfronts Arno outside the crypt while Giordani is inside, and informs him\n\nthat he has kidnapped Lori. He demands the evidence and their silence in\n\nexchange for her safety, but Arno is able to stab him with a hidden blade in\n\nhis cane before the criminal can get away.\n\nArno and Giordani accompany the police on a search of the Terzi Institute,\n\nwhere the killer has Lori hidden. Before he can stab her with his knife,\n\nGiordani interrupts and these two engage in a dragged out battle which\n\nspills out onto the roof, and in which the killer is revealed to be Casoni.\n\nHe gets the best of Giordani, who struggles with Casoni's knife stuck in his\n\nshoulder. In a fit of madness Casoni reveals his motivation to be his own\n\ninfliction with XYY syndrome, something only Calabresi also knew. He\n\ninitially sneaked into the Institute to swap his file containing this\n\ninformation with a doctored one, but when Calabresi decided to blackmail him\n\nthe murderous chain of events began. Casoni escapes Giordani but is trapped\n\nby the blind Arno with his sword-cane. When Casoni claims to have killed\n\nLori, Arno flies into a murderous rage himself and throws the madman through\n\na skylight and into an elevator shaft, where he falls to his death while\n\nvainly trying to break his fall by gripping the cables, which only serves to\n\nflay the flesh off of his hands. As he hits bottom there is a voice over of\n\nLori calling to Arno while the credits roll. The open question is whether\n\nCasoni's condition, or just his deepening fear of it, led to his violent\n\ninsanity. Arno himself was driven to violence when told that Lori had been\n\nharmed, and thus a different motivation for killing is presented.\n\nSome of the camera effects that were explored in Bird With the Crystal\n\nPlumage are extended in Cat. There is a great fluidity and point of view\n\nshots from the killer are used throughout. There is also a step away from\n\nthe conventional is the construction of the film. The plot is only a\n\nreoccurring device, and is in fact abandoned in places only to be recalled\n\nlater when the story needed to be forwarded. The first fifteen or so\n\nminutes do almost nothing towards introducing a story, with only the brief\n\nscene of Arno overhearing something about blackmail being important to the\n\nnarrative, and this is included early on only by necessity as it is the\n\ndevice that draws Arno into the story. The largest portion of the opening\n\nis used in establishing the cinematic space, and in developing a convention\n\nwhich will be recalled. The credits are accompanied by a tracking shot\n\nwhich explores the Terzi rooftop at nighttime, and then there is a cut to\n\nArno and Lori strolling down the sidewalk which links them, and what they\n\noverhear, with the Institute. This bridges to a scene in their apartment\n\nwhere Lori goes to bed and Arno works on a puzzle. He detects something out\n\nhis window, and in an vocalization of his recollection on the soundtrack the\n\nblackmail line is clearly repeated. The camera then matches Arno's window\n\nin the background to a struggle below, outside of the Institute. Casoni is\n\nseen clubbing a guard, from his point of view, which is preceded by a close\n\nup of his eye and a flourish on the Ennio Morricone soundtrack as a signal.\n\nWhat follows is a point of view exploration of the inside of the building,\n\nin which the camera peers through its darkened corners and crevices, all\n\naccompanied by more closeups of eyeballs. Thus in this opening sequence we\n\nhave learned that Arno, the Terzi Institute, a discussion of blackmail, and\n\nthis burglary are all linked in the story, but we have know idea how, or\n\neven what that story will be. The principle of conventional narrative\n\nfilmmaking in which characters and their dilemmas are initially defined has\n\nalready been broken. A visual indication of the Casoni's presence has also\n\nbeen created, and a flash of his eyeball and accompanying Morricone music,\n\nfollowed by a point of view shot, will be used throughout Cat to signal his\n\nlurking presence. The eyeball shot is significant in another way in that it\n\ncontrasts with, and emphasizes, Arno's blindness, which in turn underlines\n\nhis high perception of the details of the case. Almost as if by necessity a\n\nbit of narrative establishment follows in which, through Giordani's\n\ninvestigation of the scene of the crime, some of the principle characters are\n\ndefined and Calabresi's plot is revealed.\n\nAfter Calabresi's murder solidifies the role that Arno and Giordani will\n\nplay together, furthering the story is again set aside as Cat explores the\n\nguilty worlds of its characters. As each one's shortcoming is revealed\n\nthere is an implicit suggestion of culpability, but equally this serves to\n\nfurther some of the subtextual messages of the film. Terzi and his daughter\n\nAnna's odd relationship is paralleled with that of Arno and Lori, who calls\n\nhim \"Cookie.\" When we cut to them in their apartment after they are\n\nintroduced, the first image is of Arno kissing Lori goodnight. At first\n\nglance this appears a bit too passionate, but when it quickly ends the image\n\nsubsides. On its own this scene doesn't mean much, but it will add to later\n\nimplications. Early on Arno tells Giordani that Lori's parents are dead,\n\nthat he has no relatives, and that they need each other. Thus like Terzi\n\nand Anna they are not truly related. At another time when Arno is saddened\n\nover having to send Lori away, Giordani describes one of their suspects as\n\n\"fishy,\" to which the melancholy Arno replies, \"but don't we all have\n\nsomething fishy in our lives\" as Giordani's face casts an awkward look\n\ntoward the blind man. The character of Dr. Braun is another whose\n\npeculiarities are explored. Argento frequently incorporates gays into his\n\nfilms, and they usually wind up killed as tragic victim's of circumstance.\n\nMake what you will of this, but he never portrays them in a negative light\n\ndue to there homosexuality, and probably uses their orientation as a device\n\nfor playing with his audience's perceptions. There is a common methodology\n\nin his films of furthering viewer's tension through manipulation of their\n\nsexual neuroses, and thus homosexuality is part of a mix of voyeurism,\n\nincest, and gender confusion.\n\nBianca's initial image as a grieving victim of Calabresi's death is also\n\nquickly set aside when her we learn that her relationship with him was a\n\nscam, and when she takes up the position of blackmailer. These character\n\nexplorations not only provide for temporary suspects, but also hint at guilt\n\nso as to frame the set pieces in which they are killed. Argento frequently\n\nincludes sequences which are tangential to the story, and which are designed\n\nto be visual experiences which can stand on their own merit apart from it.\n\nThe scenes of the killer in action are the most obvious example of this, and\n\nin Cat they take a big step forward in their depiction of gore over its\n\npredecessor. Bianca's murder is especially nasty and is one of the\n\ninterludes where the hyperviolence is used in a choreographed manner. A\n\ntight shot of her head is shown as the killer is out of frame. Her face is\n\nrepeatedly thrust into the ground, and eventually bits of blood stained\n\ndrool form a line between her mouth and the ground. This sequence provides\n\nthe clearest glimpse of the prototype black leather gloves on the fiend's\n\nhands. Calabresi's death is likewise highly stylized. In real time his body\n\nis shown making contact with the train, which is intercut with a slow motion\n\nclose up of his head upon impact, and then a return to his decapitated body\n\nrolling by the wayside.\n\nA return to narrative development sets up the film's best sequence. Arno's\n\nand Giordani's lives are threatened, and thus the mystery takes on a greater\n\nurgency for them. When they decide that Bianca's information on the killer\n\nis held inside her locket, they decide to rob her grave to get it. As we\n\ntrack them through the graveyard at night, we also see Casoni's eyeball and\n\nhis point of view shot as he follows them. With the blind Arno keeping\n\nwatch outside, Giordani opens her casket and indeed finds a folded piece of\n\npaper that he gives to Arno. Before he can re-seal the coffin, the door to\n\nthe crypt crashes closed over a last glimpse of Arno's cane outside. A\n\npanicked Giordani tries to get out, but when he realizes he can't he settles\n\ndown to ponder his position. There is some question raised as to Arno's\n\nculpability, as he was last seen just outside the door. It then opens and\n\nArno stumbles in with the blade at the end of his cane, revealed for the\n\nfirst time, soaked in blood. There is additionally some suspicious tension\n\nin Arno's voice as he calls out to Giordani. It is resolved that what\n\nhappened was that Arno was confronted by Casoni outside, who told of Lori's\n\ncapture and took the information from the locket before it could be read,\n\nbut not before Arno could inflict a wound. The irony of the ultimate\n\nsolution being in the hands of the blind man, and thus not quite being\n\nlearned, is displayed. The struggle between Giordani and Casoni on the roof\n\nis the most derivative of Leone in any Argento film. The sound of their\n\nblows are highly amplified on the soundtrack, and the image of Giordani\n\nstruggling with a dagger protruding from his shoulder is striking. There is\n\neventually a slow pan up from the ground, past a bleeding wound to the gut,\n\nand to the face of the killer as he is identified for the audience. Argento\n\nis of course familiar with Leone's work, having co-written that director's\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West, a film which like Cat opens with a drawn out\n\nsequence which isn't narrative in function, but does set a mood for what is\n\nto follow.\n\nThere is an attempt to incorporate segments of humor in Cat O' Nine Tails as\n\nwell, a strategy which moves into segments of outright slapstick in Four\n\nFlies on Grey Velvet before the comedy film Five Day in Milan placated those\n\nurges in the director for good. One of the stand alone segments has\n\nGiordani in a barber's chair getting a shave with a straight razor. He\n\nreads the paper that tells of the photographer's death. The barber, who\n\ndoesn't know that his client is the story's author, objects to the\n\nsuggestion that due to a blade being used the culprit might be a barber. He\n\ndismisses this notion by saying that a barber wouldn't be so sloppy, and\n\ndescribes the cuts a one would make as he shaves Giordani's neck. Giordani\n\ngrows nervous and eventually jumps up from the confused barber. Another\n\nsegment introduces a character called Gigi the Loser, whom we encounter\n\nengaged in an insult contest. Giordani hires him to help with the break in\n\nat Terzi's house. The use of the soundtrack is also further developed with\n\nthis film. Morricone's omnipresent strains of awkward music provide\n\nmessages, especially when they shift to emphasize the killer's presence. The\n\nmusic is so constant that it causes silence to be quite effective. The\n\nscore would eventually become a very important component to Argento's\n\noverall presentation. Here his ideas are in development, and they won't\n\nreach a high level of success until his initial collaboration with Goblin,\n\non Deep Red. Argento frequently builds the character of the protagonist\n\naround his notions of himself. He has claimed that Suspiria's Suzy Banion\n\nis the character most modeled after himself, and those of Four Flies on Grey\n\nVelvet's Roberto Tobias, Tenebrae's Peter Neal, and Opera's Marco seem\n\nobvious. One can't help but notice the relation of the blind man Arno's\n\nname to Argento, whatever message that may contain. Cat O' Nine Tails was\n\nreleased in the US by National-General, who tried to sell it with a highly\n\nexploitative campaign. It didn't reach the success of its predecessor in\n\nEurope or America.\n\nQUATTRO MOSCHE DI VELLUTO GRIGIO (aka Four Flies on Grey Velvet, 1972) is\n\nwhere Argento first begins to play with both the conventions established in\n\nhis first two films, and those of other directors working in the giallo\n\ngenre. It also contains a greater movement toward extravagant editing and\n\nstory construction techniques, and includes more attempts at humor than any\n\nof his thriller or horror films. It is one his most linear films, however\n\nwith all of the additional plot twists and filmic devices employed it\n\ndoesn't seem that way. Cat O' Nine Tails was criticized for indulging in\n\ntoo many details which veered away from a cohesive furthering of the plot;\n\nsimilarly Four Flies was criticized for its excesses, though mainly for its\n\ncinematic overindulgence. A consolidation of the best ideas from each animal\n\ntrilogy entry would come in Argento's fourth giallo and fifth film, Deep\n\nRed, making for a better overall film. These techniques, while existing in\n\na less refined manner, are still a joy to watch in his first three projects.\n\nThis is true even if the film's various subsections only succeed on an\n\nimmediate level, and apart from the whole. Few films made are so carefully\n\nconstructed from shot to shot and from scene to scene, and watching an\n\nArgento film presents the viewer with an interpretative puzzle every step of\n\nthe way.\n\nThe first and most obvious deviation of Four Flies from the paradigm of the\n\nprevious films is in the character of its protagonist. That role is filled\n\nby Roberto Tobias (Michael Brandon), whose artistic tendencies lie in his\n\nbeing a drummer in a prog-rock band. Past protagonists were innocent\n\ninterlopers, either Sam Dalmas who happened upon the struggle in the\n\ngallery, or Franco Arno and Carlo Girodani who investigate an event that\n\nhappened in their midst through either their instinct or profession. Tobias\n\nis however a guilty victim of circumstance, and it is he who is, or at least\n\nit initially seems, responsible for the film's opening murder. He is more\n\nblamable of being a dupe than viscous however, and this distances him from\n\nthe pure guilt that Peter Neal would embody in Tenebrae. The structure of\n\nthe lead character being drawn into something not of his making, and being\n\nthreatened by it, is maintained even if it is on different terms. Flies\n\nopens with a jam session by Tobias' band. This opening utilizes some\n\ndrastic contrasts in its editing. The band jams in a well-lit studio, while\n\nTobias is distracted by a man in dark hat, glasses, and coat spying in on\n\nhim. He recognizes the man as a person who has been following him for\n\nseveral days. The present action is cut into with flashbacks showing these\n\nprevious encounters, and flashforwards to just after this session where\n\nTobias is chasing after the dark glassed man. All of these action sequences\n\nare themselves interrupted by contrasting cuts to the credits, where the\n\nmusic drops out to be replaced only by the sound of a heartbeat, and the\n\ntitles are displayed against a plain black background containing the image\n\nof a beating heart. The frenzied notion of some drastic event surrounding\n\nTobias and this man is conveyed by the kinetic pacing of these scenes, and\n\nis startlingly broken with the credit sequences. The pounding heart\n\nmaintains a link to Tobias' tension over these events. Violations of\n\ncontinuity are already introduced in the temporal construction of this\n\nsequence. One popular bit of odd photography during this credit sequence\n\nshows members of the band playing in a shot bordered by a circular blocking\n\non the screen. It isn't until a hand is seen waving back and forth that the\n\nviewer realizes that this is from the point of view of the inside of an\n\nacoustic guitar.\n\nAfter the credits the pursuit resumes. Tobias chases the man into an\n\nabandoned opera house (a building with an opulent, and by association hints\n\nof decadent, look which would be utilized to a greater extent fifteen years\n\nlater in Opera) where he confronts him. The dark man's surprised and\n\nincredulous reaction draws into question Tobias' mental stability. The man\n\nremoves a knife from his pocket in a defensive gesture, Tobias grabs it from\n\nhim, and quickly the man tumbles into the orchestra pit with a bloody wound.\n\nTobias has accidentally killed his antagonist. Throughout the confrontation\n\na figure in a wickedly smiling mask has been snapping photos from an upper\n\nlevel, and this person is glimpsed just as the body is falling to the\n\nground. A twist on Argento's conventional tactic is introduced in that this\n\nfilm's central character is a killer, and it is he who has been observed by\n\nan unknown person while \"caught in the act.\" This incident is the axis on\n\nwhich the story turns. The wickedly smiling, unnerving mask worn by the\n\nphotographer provides a threatening overtone to what has happened. Its\n\nunisex quality is also important in a larger context as gender ambiguity\n\nwill come to be a central theme. The black clad man's role is also a shift\n\naway from expectations, as he is a victim rather than a perpetrator, and\n\nthus the iconography of the genre is already being played with. Tobias is\n\nthen taunted by the onlooker to his crime, causing him a great deal of\n\nanguish. The dead man's identification is mailed to him and photos taken by\n\nthe masked figure turn up in his home. A theme of the breakdown of an\n\nunstable character when thrust into a situation not of his making is\n\ndeveloped.\n\nAn important element that will serve as a reoccurring comment on Tobias'\n\nstate of mind is introduced. At a party in his home, a friend describes to\n\nTobias, his wife Nina (Mimsy Farmer), and other guests an execution\n\nwitnessed in Saudi Arabia. In detail he recalls the condemned man being\n\nbrought to a public square in front of many onlookers, and then of the\n\nexecutioner's use of a dagger to the neck followed by a sword swipe to\n\nremove the head. Recollection of this story by Tobias, in a series of\n\nprogressive and visually distinct nightmares, serves as a temporal tracking\n\nof the development of his psychosis. The first nightmare sequence is the\n\nlongest. After discovering the incriminating evidence, he dreams of the\n\nscene described. The onscreen image is quite unusual in that it is visually\n\nvery distinct from the contrasting real world depiction. The lighting is\n\nunusually bright, and there in an unnerving buzzing music on the soundtrack\n\nprovided by Ennio Morricone. The execution is unusually slow in developing,\n\nas the action is displayed with a slowed down film speed. Tobias' dream is\n\ninterrupted just as the sword is about to reach impact, and its swooshing\n\nsound is used as an overlapping sound match to his jolting awake in bed. He\n\nconfides in Nina as to his predicament, and just after his confession a\n\nnoise draws him to another room and into a direct confrontation with his\n\ntormentor. A knife is held to Tobias' throat and in a raspy whisper the\n\nintruder speaks of how easy it would be to kill him, and then disappears.\n\nNot only is he being threatened over his guilt, but this person is now\n\nthreatening his life, and Tobias has no idea who it is or why.\n\nDuring this encounter Nina remains in bed, but the maid is shown lurking in\n\nthe background. She had previously been seen observing Tobias find the\n\nplanted photos. From what she has learned the maid engages in blackmail,\n\nbut it is not made known who she is extorting. A good example of Argento's\n\ntaste for the use of unorthodox photography is observed in this exchange.\n\nThe maid uses a pay phone to deliver her threat, and she is shown claiming\n\nto someone that she knows who they are and what is going on, and that the\n\nperson on the other end of the line should meet with her in a park with a\n\npayoff. Tension is built towards the revelation of who she is talking to by\n\na tracking shot in which the camera slowly travels along the phone line\n\nwhich links the blackmailer and blackmailee. The camera follows a chord out\n\nof the booth, moves along phone lines through the city, and shows them\n\narriving at the distant building. The score builds as we are forced to wait\n\nto see this person, who most viewers probably suspect will be Tobias. The\n\nconstruction of the scene leads the viewer to think that a big revelation is\n\nbeing built to, and the maid's prior activities around him suggest we may be\n\nlearning more about his role in the affair. At the last instant however the\n\naudience is cheated, as there is a quick cut to the maid waiting in a park.\n\nThe sequence also reflects Argento's obsession with the definition of\n\ncinematic space. He is precisely describing the relative positions of these\n\ntwo people to each other. The maid is seated at midday amongst some\n\nexpected park inhabitants; playing children, young families, and a kissing\n\ncouple. In a series of jump cuts the park is shown to gradually empty as\n\nthe sky begins to darken. The environment appears continuously more hostile\n\nas the jump cuts proceed. The maid is eventually the only remaining person,\n\nand the shot from which this temporal progression is shown becomes a point\n\nof view shot of her arriving target. This person has no intention of paying\n\nhowever, and instead turns violent as is evidenced by the terrified look on\n\nthe maid's face. She is chased through the dark corners of the park, and\n\nthe maintenance of the point of view shot of the killer gives some clue as\n\nto identity, as while the thin maid struggles through a tight spot between\n\ntwo walls her attacker moves through it effortlessly. The maid re aches a\n\nhigh wall and screams frantically for help as a young couple strolls by on\n\nthe other, well lit side. Her death comes as the male passerby haplessly\n\ntries to scale the wall.\n\nThe scene that follows maintains the point of view shot momentum, and thus\n\nimplies the continued presence of the killer. A major twist is introduced\n\nthrough an encounter with the man Tobias chased into the opera house. As\n\nwith the maid, he demands a payoff, and implies that since a real murder has\n\noccurred his accomplice should give him more money. Also like the maid the\n\nblackmail causes his death, which is by hammer blows to the head. In\n\nshowing this, a flamboyant effect is used where the point of view switches\n\nfrom the killer holding the hammer to the murder weapon itself as it lands\n\non the victim's skull. All that the audience has been shown and led to\n\nbelieve to this point is revealed to be false. The viewer was under the\n\npresumption that Tobias had killed a man when in fact he did not. It was\n\nalso logical to believe that it was Tobias who was the target of the maid's\n\nblackmail attempt, and thus was also her killer. Although he doesn't know\n\nit, Tobias is innocent of any wrongdoing and the only murders committed have\n\nbeen done by this other person. A bit of explanation is given by the black\n\nclad man, before he is killed, as to the nature of their trick. During this\n\nhe displays the retractable blade that he used, complete with false blood.\n\nArgento would recycle the idea of a phony murder weapon in the hands of\n\nTenebrae's Peter Neal.\n\nAs Tobias has been the innocent victim of some malicious scam, the question\n\nbecomes one of who is responsible and why. The attentive viewer should be\n\nable to conclude now that the perpetrator has to be Nina, and by extension\n\nshe must be responsible for the two real slayings. The remainder of the\n\nfilm becomes driven by a revelation of her motive. The idea was previously\n\npresented that the technical solution of the crime is not Argento's primary\n\nfocal point. If the theory that the preposterous methods used in reaching a\n\nsolution are intended to emphasize this is correct, then Four Flies falls\n\nright in line as its methodology in drawing a conclusion is probably the\n\nmost ridiculous of all. The remainder of the film concerns itself with a\n\ngradual supplying of clues as to motivation, as none is yet apparent. It is\n\nalso concerned with Tobias' sinking mental state, as he never becomes aware\n\nof the truth of the opera house incident, and he continues to be stalked.\n\nCritics accustomed to Hollywood films frequently fault Four Flies for the\n\nobviousness of its villain, but again this more demonstrates their lack of\n\nunderstanding of the film's technique than its weakness, as this revelation\n\nis not what Four Flies is about.\n\nArgento has inserted bits of humor into all of his previous films, and in\n\nfact some of the excessive violence, broad analogies, and extreme subtexts\n\ncan be viewed as humorous in their outrageousness. In Four Flies however\n\nthere are blatant examples of slapstick and verbal silliness. A goofy\n\nmailman is verbally attacked by a neighbor of Tobias' for delivering\n\npornography to the wrong address. Tobias later physically attacks the\n\nmailman in an overdrawn manner when he mistakes him for his tormentor, and\n\nthis sets up a later comic episode where the spooked letter carrier is\n\nafraid to come too close. Spaghetti western vet Bud Spencer plays an\n\nextroverted friend of Tobias' who lives in a shack by a polluted urban\n\nriver. In an idea left over from \"The Screaming Mimi\" he is named Godfrey,\n\nbut is referred to as \"God.\" Upon his introduction Tobias calls out to God,\n\nand Morricone answers on the soundtrack with a bit of the \"Hallelujah\"\n\nchorus. God's sidekick is a nutty character called \"The Professor\" (ala\n\nHarpo Marx?) who is hired by Tobias to keep watch over his house for\n\n\"blackmailers, murderers, and the like.\" At one time when Tobias meets with\n\nGod and The Professor it is at a \"funeral arts\" exhibition. Humor is drawn\n\nin relation to the theme of death, which has increasingly surrounded the\n\nstory, but the placement of the scene provides no subtextual element or\n\nfurthering of the narrative. It is just a comic device. These humor\n\nattempts are not utilized as a strategically placed tool to lighten tension,\n\nor give a false suggestion that tension should be lightened, as is often\n\ndone in terror films. Tobias decides that a private eye can help him, and\n\nhe visits one named Arrosio. His trip to Arrosio's office provides for\n\nanother indulgence in fluid editing which is contrary to convention. Tobias\n\ndrives his car through the streets of Rome, and there is a matched point of\n\nview sequence of his traveling by foot through Arrosio's building. As the\n\ncar races forward there are intervening shots of Tobias traveling forward,\n\nfirst up some stairs, then down a hallway, and finally to the detective's\n\ndoor, which is marked by a sketch of an eye on the handle. The editing cuts\n\nback and forth between car and building, and the two environments are\n\nbridged by the continuing sound of a racing engine on the soundtrack, which\n\nlinks the events with the forward camera movement. It is another play with\n\nnon-linearity, as the events are occurring out of sequence. Other examples\n\nof non-linearity in Four Flies are the opening flashbacks and flashforwards\n\nencompassing the black coated man's interactions with Tobias, and the\n\ncontinuing dream sequence, which on each reoccurrence begins later in its\n\nprogression, carries further toward the final decapitation, and is of a\n\nshorter duration. The intensity of what is happening in the Arabian square\n\nis brought out to a greater extent with each succeeding depiction, just as\n\nthe immediacy of the dangers to Tobias are becoming more and more obvious.\n\nArrossio is this film's expected gay character, and his openness and\n\nflamboyance provide some additional bits of comic interjection. His\n\npresence also serves to underline the sexual tensions central to the film's\n\nprinciple subtext. Arrossio is hired by Tobias. He states to his patron\n\nrather brashly that he has yet to solve a case, bragging that he may be\n\nheading toward some kind of record in futility. Arrosio does eventually\n\npiece together an explanation, but is murdered before Tobias can be told.\n\nThe idea of a failed investigator achieving his first success at the expense\n\nof the story's protagonist will be utilized more subtly with Detective\n\nGiermani in Tenebrae. The episode comments negatively on Tobias, as here is\n\nanother character, along with the maid and Nina's original accomplice, who\n\nhas been able to solve the crimes. They all die with their knowledge while\n\nthe clueless Tobias continues to remain oblivious throughout. Arrossio also\n\nprovides a narrative function, as it is through his investigation that\n\nNina's motivation is revealed. In Tobias' family photos the detective\n\ncomments on a remarkable similarity. He traces Nina's history back to her\n\ninstitutionalization as a child. He uncovers the fact that her father\n\nlocked her up out of his anger over her being a girl. None of this is\n\nexplicitly spelled out, and in fact the film has yet to admit that it is\n\nNina who has done the killings, but these pieces of evidence are gradually\n\ndropped. They are mixed with flashback sequences containing more point of\n\nview shots from inside a padded cell. Over these shots a tormentor is heard\n\nto shout, \"I wanted a son, not a weakling like you!\" Arrossio's murder\n\nsignificantly is committed when he is cornered in a coed bathroom, where\n\nexplicitly shown on the door are the interlinked male and female (mars and\n\nvenus) symbols.\n\nThe allusions to gender form the main subtext of Four Flies on Grey Velvet.\n\nBoth Michael Brandon and Mimsy Farmer have somewhat androgynous appearances.\n\nHe is skinny, long haired, and wears flashy clothes, much as is to be\n\nexpected from an early seventies rock performer. She has a short haircut,\n\nis unshapely, and wears pants and button down shirts. The entire story\n\nrevolves around her motivation, which is shown to be born from a psychosis\n\ninstilled in her by her father, through his abuse due to her being born\n\nfemale. There is a definite masculine streak to her char acter (A reaction?\n\nIt's not explicitly stated). The plot reveals that she has married Tobias\n\nas he looks like her father, and she wishes to use him as the target of her\n\nrevenge. Tobias' masculinity is also presented with some question. He is\n\npropositioned by Arrossio, and subtle points such as a male friend\n\ncomforting him with an arm tightly around his shoulders are included. None\n\nof these shots by themselves are significant, but taken together they play\n\non the viewer's psychology. It is interesting to recall that Argento's\n\nartistic characters are often referred to by him as extensions of himself.\n\nWhile I know of no comments by the director as to Roberto Tobias, Michael\n\nBrandon's physical resemblance to him should be considered. Gender\n\nambiguity is also played upon in the non-specific nature of the opera house\n\nphotographer's mask (who was Nina), and the location of Arrosio's killing.\n\nTobias' is eventually confirmed as heterosexual through his liaison with\n\nNina's young cousin Dalia. She arrives to visit in the midst of the trouble\n\nand stays in the house even when Nina moves out over claimed stress from the\n\nthreats. Tobias' seduces the young girl, but her build is quite slight and\n\nboy-like, and thus still allows for some subtle suggestions of ambiguity in\n\norientation.\n\nDalia serves several other functions. One is to re-emphasize Tobias as an\n\nunlikeable character, as he is quick to lure the teenager into bed soon\n\nafter his wife has left the house. She also serves as a victim, as Nina\n\nkills her when she is found in the house instead of Tobias. Dalia's murder\n\nis the basis for Four Flies' version of weird science being used as a tool\n\nto move the story to a close. The legitimacy of the methodology in this\n\nfilm is the most outrageous of all, but as I said previously these\n\nexplanations can be seen as merely a means to an end, and in fact their\n\nfantastical nature may be a tool to de-emphasize them. After Dalia's death\n\nthe police inform Tobias of a new investigative technique and ask his\n\npermission to try it out. When he is agreeable they lead him into a room\n\nwhere Dalia's eyeball, complete with protruding optic nerve, is mounted in a\n\ncamera device. Tobias is told that this instrument can resolve the last\n\nimage seen by the person before they died, and when it is used what is\n\nprojected are four flies arranged along an arc. As offbeat as the notion\n\nis, the mounted eyeball does provide for a strange sight.\n\nThe conclusion of the film has Tobias arming himself with a gun and waiting\n\nout an eventual encounter with the killer in his house. There is a storm\n\nraging outside. As he positions himself with pistol in hand he falls asleep\n\nand the reoccurring Arabian nightmare is allowed to play out to its ending.\n\nThe final segment picks up just as the sword is descending towards the neck,\n\nand as the head is finally shown to be lopped off, the dream is interrupted\n\nby a phone call from God. As that nightmare has reached its conclusion so\n\nmust the real life one. God is cut off when the phone line is sliced, and\n\nas Tobias awaits the confrontation he is shocked when Nina walks through the\n\ndoor. He is still not able to identify her role and warns of the danger,\n\nand only upon spotting a pendant hanging from her neck containing an encased\n\nfly does he realize her culpability. The four flies in an arc seen last be\n\nDalia was the fly hanging from Nina's neck swinging on its chain. The\n\nmasculine Nina is still able to better the feminine Tobias when she wrests\n\nthe gun from him. She hits him with a non-fatal shot while screeching out\n\nher hatred. She shouts, \"You're so much like HIM!\". God charges in to\n\nrescue Tobias, but Nina is able to flee out the door. She meets her demise\n\nfittingly by decapitation, being executed for her sins by an oncoming truck\n\nher car collides with in the rain. This final shot is another bit a\n\nphotographic trickery, captured utilizing an extremely high shutter speed\n\ncamera borrowed from a university and usually used in scientific\n\nexperimentation.\n\nFour Flies on Grey Velvet offers a great deal of offbeat cinematography,\n\nplot construction, and editing, as has been described. These qualities,\n\ncoupled with the humor and manipulation of convention, make it a dense film\n\nthat can be enjoyed on many levels. The \"kitchen sink\" approach does\n\npresent some coherency problems which is reminiscent of Cat O' Nine Tails\n\nand its convoluted script. A lack of tight cohesion amongst all of these\n\ntechniques prevents Four Flies from being the complete achievement that Deep\n\nRed, Argento's next giallo, would be. Critics of the film mostly direct\n\ntheir disapproval toward the acting of Michael Brandon. While his\n\nperformance is a bit wooden and unemotional, this isn't necessarily the\n\ncatastrophe that it could be, as the nature of Four Flies isn't such that\n\nacting is the preeminent concern. A truly fine performance can improve a\n\nfilm of this sort however, as is the case with David Hemmings in his role as\n\nMarc Daly in Deep Red. Four Flies on Grey Velvet is a transitional film,\n\nespecially in its look and the manner in which it is constructed. It is a\n\nbig step forward in the maturation of the unconventional style that Argento\n\nis known for. Even with their eccentricities, Bird and Cat are still much\n\nmore conventional than this film and what is to follow. A much greater use\n\nof intricate camera movements and angles, as well as a greater use of\n\nediting and non-linearity, are utilized in Four Flies. For the first time a\n\nstrong concentration on the color composition of shots is used. Bright\n\ncolors are used to dominate scenes, and large sections of primaries are\n\nplayed off of each other. Luxuriant art direction would continue to expand\n\nin the dark world of Deep Red, but would really come to be dominant in the\n\ncarefully constructed otherworldliness of Suspiria and Inferno. A final\n\nelement to the complete Argento milieu that is still missing from Four Flies\n\nis an overwhelming score. While Morricone provides some fun flourishes,\n\neven he is too conventional for the mature Argento vehicle. It would take\n\nthe first collaboration with Goblin, again on Deep Red, for the director to\n\ntake the use of the soundtrack to new hyperkinetic levels.\n\nArgento's next project was as the producer of an Italian television show\n\ntitled LA PORTA SUL BUIO (aka The Door into Darkness, 1972), which was\n\ndesigned to capitalize on the popular giallo genre. Four hour long episodes\n\nwere made, two of which Argento directed himself. The episodes are THE TRAM\n\n(aka Il Tram) directed by Argento under the pseudonym Sirio Bernadotte,\n\nEYEWITNESS (Testimone Oculare) directed by Argento under the name of Roberto\n\nPariente, NEIGHBOUR (aka Il Vicino di Casa) directed by Luigi Cozzi, and LA\n\nBAMBOLA (aka The Doll). Argento had to take over the direction of\n\nEyewitness from his assistant Pariente, but left his name on it. He also\n\nappeared in an introduction at the beginning of each episode Hitchcock style\n\nand became a recognizable star in Italy from this. Cozzi has said that\n\nthere were plans to create two theatrical movies from the shows but nothing\n\never came of it. I haven't been able to see these and so I don't know how\n\nthey fit in with the rest of Argento's work as to style or artistic\n\nachievment.\n\nAfter the animal trilogy, Argento took an 180 degree turn away from the\n\narea in which he had been working. He and writing partner Luigi Cozzi\n\nattempted a historical comedy set during the wars over Italian unification\n\nin 1848. LE CINQUE GIORNATE (aka The Five Days of Milan, 1973) resembles\n\nthe European westerns that were reaching the end of their cycle at the\n\ntime. It most resembles Leone's Giu La Testa (aka Duck You Sucker! aka A\n\nFistful of Dynamite, 1971) in that it attempts situational humor derived\n\nfrom a couple of characters who wander through the backdrop of a chaotic\n\nrevolution. Five Days' Cainazzo (Adriano Celentano) is a similar character\n\nto Rod Steiger's Juan in Duck You Sucker. He is a small time hood who is\n\noblivious to any of the politics which surround him, and is much more\n\ninterested in scheming a fast buck from the conflict than in any sense of\n\npatriotism. Like Juan however, his scams lead him to an active interest in\n\nthe revolution. Argento takes a very liberal approach to the comedy\n\nwriting, in which he essentially includes every joke that he and Cozzi could\n\nthink up and hopes that enough of them stick. There is a lot of physical\n\ncomedy, as well as verbal and situational jokes, which obviously are very\n\nItalian in nature and are designed to appeal to their compatriots. Cainazzo\n\nbegins as a thief behind bars who is fortuitously broken out as he shares\n\nhis cell with some captured soldiers. He grows to be \"curious about this\n\nrevolution\" and eventually interjects himself into the conflict between the\n\nrepublicans, the nobility, and the Austrians. Along the way he picks up a\n\ncompletely clueless sidekick named Romolo (Enzo Cerusico) who winds up dead\n\nfrom his association with Cainazzo. The absolute chaos and the shifting\n\nallegiances seem to be used as a commentary on the modern Italian political\n\nsituation. The only Argento trademark that is apparent is fluid camera\n\nwork, and that is used in an attempt at wacky slapstick humor. A couple of\n\nthe better scenes show a mob blindly following Cainazzo as he grabs a\n\ntri-color flag (which he doesn't even recognize) for protection, and a scene\n\nwhere different characters interpret Romolo's dying words according to their\n\nown wishes. One person hears \"long live Italy\", another \"Austrians are\n\nassholes\" and a third \"long live the church.\" Five Days in Milan was never\n\nreleased outside of Italy and was not a highly successful project\n\nfinancially. Some of its comedy works for a non-Italian viewer but it is\n\nreally for Argento completists only.\n\nRosso, or red, is a shocking color which conjures up notions of perversity,\n\nsexuality, and violence. It is the classic color of the insides of whore\n\nhouses and it is the color of blood. PROFONDO ROSSO (aka Deep Red, 1975) is\n\nArgento's return to the giallo and it is so named as it is deeply involved\n\nwith themes of sexuality and violence. This film is a synthesis of ideas\n\ntoyed with in the animal trilogy, but it is also a great step forward in\n\nterms of creativity. The structural elements introduced in the early\n\nsections much rely on the iconography established in the first three films,\n\nand thus they rely on themes common to the giallo in general. The\n\nexperimentations with accepted conventions of cinema in Cat O' Nine Tails\n\nand Four Flies on Grey Velvet were exciting, but many times they detracted\n\nfrom the overall cohesiveness of those films. After a shift in style with\n\nThe Five Days of Milan and three years since the completion of his last\n\ngiallo, Argento was able to reflect on the most successful of his earlier\n\nstylistic excesses and combine them in a clear manner toward a more focused\n\nresult. Like all of Argento's work, Deep Red can be interpreted as\n\ndepiction of a nightmare. It is structured so that it could be the\n\nrealization of a particularly long"
